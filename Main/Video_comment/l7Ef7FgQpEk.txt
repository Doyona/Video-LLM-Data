Man. Bdubs is just SO good. I don't even understand how he comes up with these ideas, let alone how he executes them. The man creates such UNBELIEVABLE art in this game where I struggle to build even super basic houses. Just amazing stuff. Thanks for doing it Bdubs!
OMG the front of that dungeon gate wow. i had no idea making false shadows could have such an effect. it almost looks like a 13th century painting. unbelievable . i will have to practice this ! oh man it will be fun!
NO SUCH THING AS OVER TEXTURED
Me turning on keep inventory: "and because I don't hate myself, I'm going to cheat"
Notice the price. Very high prices.  Made me cackle
What are the cords for this place!!???
hey what are the codinates plz cant find it
This region would be more accurately called the "Sahel", south of the desert where there are more plants.
oh my god
Anyone know the coordinates?
is anyone re-watching this and thinking it's a mini decked out 2
The castle reminds me of a tuxedo shirt 😂
"A Sahara". Bdubs... HSHAHAA
Lovely build! I needed inspiration for my castle door. Although my design is completly different, i don't think it would be as nice if i didn't watch this! My kids are soo happy, they have been at me for months trying to get me to build a huge castle in our family survival world 😂
That gate is amazing!!! 🎉🎉🎉
any link for the white blocks texture pack?
When you zoomed out my mouth didn't close for quite a while.
"Because I don't hate myself, im gonna cheat!" 😂😂
The amount of exclamations of surprise and awe during the door reveal thing.... oh my goodness. I think I said woah or something adjacent, like, 7 times. This is inCREDIBLE!!!!!!
So Did Bdubs ever finish this build or? I think it’s so beautiful but now there hasn’t been anything on it in so long.
I wonder what happened to this now
That build is 😳. Holy cow!
Did anyone ever find and play this Dungeon? It's been so long lol and all the Series are blurring together as I've been rewatching Seasons 7, 8 & 9 of Tango, Mumbo, Doc, Scar, Grian & Bdubs lately 🤣
This is really historical
Where is it ...😅 Far.... Faraway 🤣😂😭
I'm in awe, that is AMAZING! Genuinely out of words, incredible!
bdubs has taught me more about light and color theory than ive ever learned in art class
I'm curious what it looks like from different angles. Like are there angles where the shade texturing doesn't work?
Whatever happened to this build? Did he come back to it?
Hello you are the best builder of the word. Can you learn mi somthing?
for the love of god, please please please bdubs, number your episodes! 😅
When you switched from the textureless view back to vanilla, my two braincells exploded. You're a mastermind. The Bob Ross of minecraft. Bob Moss, if you will.
I gasped; that dungeon looks amazing!
bdubz is the only person who builds a 5year Minecraft hardcore base for a minigame😭
These dungeons need to tell you what to do. No one is gonna figure these out.
Chekhov's gun
actually the most goated series. the build progress each vid is unmatched
amazing build babes
Dang Bdubs!👀
This is the first time I’ve watched you.  You have the best announcers voice.  You should do voiceovers.
a breadwhat trail?
reminds me a bit of lord of the rings.. Absolutely gorgeous!!
Has anyone found the The Big Gate Dungeon yet as of August 28, 2022?
Man that's really insane
ImpulseSV came across this one stream and today on accident lol
Bdubs building style just went out farther than it could and made optical illusion become a building technique
THIS IS CRAZY!! THE GRADIENT ILLUSION GOOD-A-NESSSSSS
the gradient textures are so so awesome!!! :o
WOW
Bread crumb trail WITH the compasses
Now you can take those 2D building skills over to Terraria.
Bdubs: “there’s not many flowers here in the Sahara” Also Bdubs: zooms into a huge patch of flowers   (It’s at 22:58 for anyone wondering)
That Gate and the thinking you put into the texturing is why you're the greatest Minecraft builder there is. There are so many great builders but you are a cut above all the rest.
your builds are SICK !!!
My mind is BLOWN right now with this build. I can't believe it!!! It looks AMAZING with all the gradients and I never noticed how much of a difference it would make until you showed us! I love it!❤️
Are you serious?! This texturing is crazy
this is blowing my mind
You aren’t just a builder your an ARTIST MAN
Holy hecking heck, those gradients! I have learnt so so much from this, thank you!!! Now I can do what I wanted to with my castle!
Red trum crail
I’ve enjoyed B-Dubs’s interactions with other hermits while watching their series, but this build convinced me to subscribe!
I'm watching this Bdubs video   From inside this tunnel
That gate is RIDICULOUS. Not over textured at all! It's gorgeous and perfect just like you!
you showed its right next to a pillager outpost... i think that was a big mistake unless you are 4 paraller universes ahead of everyone and built a fake pillager outpost
Who built the tree of whimsy?
Absolutely gorgeous!!!
I swear if you put curse of binding onto the crown trophy that would be hilarious....
Mojang adds new blocks to this game because what they really want is art and BDubs delivers
Bdubs its a Savanah not the Sahara  Just in case before you sell useless clues😂🤣
Even up close its stunning. SO much ideas for my world!
I forgot to comment on this when I first saw it- I'm always impressed by the amazing builds that Hermits come up with, but I think this castle gate is honestly one of the most beautiful things I've seen on the server.  When he turned off the color so that you could see how he did the texturing, I was like, stunned.  Absolutely fantastic build 👍 He doesn't even have shaders turned on, and it still looks so real, it looks like it's going to pop out of the screen.
You are unbelievably talented!
Somebody pay this man. He's a genius.
Tree of Wimpsy: Far *Me Burst out Laughing*
"Dont be like this guy" *shows himself*
I cant stop rewatching this.  I am enthralled by your texturing
Oh bdubs, genius in bulding Minecraft
You are my favorite builder when it comes to texturing. also, it kinda inspired me to add it to my drawings. with just the texturing, you can add so much details. ty! more build to come. I learned a lot.
those texture are nice : )
Hello good sir, can you do some more Bdubs perfect redstone? I've gotten my high from mumbo, tango, etho and doc but there is still a giant hole in my heart and Bdubs perfect redstone is the only thing that works. Anyway I enjoy your content !
creating depth with block shades is actual genious and works AMAZING, when you switched to the white texture, my mouth literally dropped
breadcrumb trail is honestly a jumpscare
ahahha sahara. its called a savanna
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Before you turned on the white texture pack. I knew it was flat even though it looked 3D but that is insane how flat that actually is and how much depth you pulled from that technique
Your texturing here reminds me of the rain and pollution effet on old buildings, like old churches and cathedrals
Any POV of people attempting to do this?
what blocks have you used forr the build?
That’s incredible.
TEXTURING SORCERY!
Bdubs, turn render distance all the way down when you're giving talks to us and just walking around. That's when the most information is being given away.
"One of the bigger projects I've ever done" - Did you forget the enormous mountain with a castle on top of it? O.O'
Stop flexin just build a dirt house
I’m worried that bdubs is losing motivation for hermitcraft videos😕 I hope this is not the case
I love the episode style! Your building is incredible! I love the different camera angles, it's great to see a face when you're talking ;)
I think if you sell the clue that it's in the Sahara, they'll probably want their money back when they see it's a Savanah.
i always learn something when i watch your vids.  love your work
- + are they in the right order? Who knows, boi that was worth 20 diamonds.  took a minute to recover from that one
WOW Dub's. if you had just said oh that, yeah its flat, i'd have lost real world dollars betting you were telling pork pies. just speechless, not even an intelligent comment to add.
This is officially my favorite Minecraft build ever. I knew going into it that it was flatter than it looked. But things like that top ridge, or the filigree pattern at the top? Left me with my jaw hanging open.  Please do more of this. You've just redefined building.
I did not expect the flatness of the building. Bdubs is actually cracked omg
Absolutely sensational, real texture and flavour to that one Bdouble
Damn that was a good vibrato 😳 0:09
bdubs is absolutely popping off this season holy
I am fascinated by how you build in minecraft. Unparalleled by anyone else
You could get Pearl to build a dragon for one of your dungeons
That texture stuff is actual wizardry.
I love how the ruins is designed like a Zelda game.  And also "The Last Gaurdian"
I thought the top of the door was a picture of a clock at first
btw vpns don't work that way, although they can't see what data, they 100% know it's you.
solid voice
You should do the old video game thing where if you pay too little it calls you a cheapo, if you pay a ton it makes another snarky comment, and only the mid-level actually gives you a clue 😀
I can't comprehend this man. The ultimate ,the zenith and the greatest ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
First time watching one of your videos. Amazing build! But what impressed me the most, was you switching to a blank texture pack just to show us the power of texturing.
bruh the crown was not straight it was tilted
I promise not to tell anyone it's in a Sahara...  Completely unrelated... Do you mind if I tell them you're building in a savanna?
this music makes me want to shoot myself but cool vid
That gate might literally be the best built thing I have ever seen in minecraft, it's so detailed and amazing, I love ot
Its settled. Bdubs is officially crazy. He built 2 castle like buildings on hermitcraft. In season 7 he had an entire castle as background and now he builds this. Flawless.
Make the dungeons different types of elements.
20:05 I think my brain just exploded! That's so cool omgosh!!!!!
Me: "That's insane" Bdubs 2 seconds later: "Is that not insane"
holy dang
I absolutely love this color palette it is beautiful. I can't figure for the life of me what is the most pale block he used. I can figure most of them except the really pale one.
Incredible work with the block shadow effect Bdubs!
Jealous of all the hermits skills
11:46 ADHD conveyed in video games
THAT VIBRATO
Ok so is no one gonna mention his singing voice ✨
i love ur voice, its such a The Stanley Parable experience
I really would like to see you make a world eater (as you are a redstone master 😉) then terraform the aftermath into a ravine with some nice texturing then build a beautiful bridge leading to a Castle like this one but also different as your mega base and if you have some time by the end you should also build a nice village on the other side and maybe have a nice river that turns into a water fall falling into the ravine that makes a small river with some nice large tilted taiga trees at the bottom of the ravine with some textured grass with moss, rooted dirt, coarse dirt, grass, small oaks trees, and some thing but tall birch trees as you like birch trees now 🙂Its just an idea to help give you some ideas if you ever need it and love the castle really messes with your head though
I'm speechless.
When you realize Sahara is a desert
I really love what you did with the texture based shadows, sometimes its easy to forget that you can use techniques from one medium in another. Shading in 2d drawings for 3d effects is like 2nd nature but I'm not sure I've ever used them on a flat face to mimic 3d in minecraft.
bdubs is my role modelllll
Absolutely love what you are doing this season bdubs! So inspirational and fun
Bdoubs is an absolutely amazing Hermit. I love him so much. Aaah I am almost exploding. I just absolutely love what he does with his videos. He is so amazing with and without his friends on this server. Man I am so obsessed with Hermitcraft lol.
Perhaps sell clues as individual pieces of the coordinates or "time savers" to help them figure out what to do when they're there. 😅
Bdubs playing with grey-dients this episode, love it :)
You could get someone like mumbo or tango to make the door actually open....
The scale and detail is insane
That white texture thing you did made it look like it was straight out of Dark Souls 3. Bravo 👏 maybe my favorite build I've seen you create.
Ok ok I've been really depressed lately really depressed and watching you play and just the sound of your voice actually helped a little so for that I'm grateful thank you....
The deep slate door texture is incredible!
best commercial yet. lol
BDubs you're a wizard
Anyone else get Monty Python Holy Grail vibes every time he says “THE TREE OF WIMSY”
Bdubs explaining 3D pixel art..
the amount of work put into this video.... this deserves millions of views
less payment for less efficient clues also serves more adventure
i LOVE how building in Minecraft got so simple but efficient   i've been experimenting with gradients myself and my builds turned crazy simple
time and time again, you post a video and outdo yourself. cheers on one of your most innovative and spectacular builds to date.
"Don't be like this guy, be like me",  Dude, you are that guy!😂
thats is just, jaw dropping man you are amazing!
14:01 I died of laughter, thank you bdubs for your amazing humor
I'm fall in love with you're voice
Just gotta say, well done, love the concept, personaly i would have gotten some darker blocks and make it look like entrance to hell with lava and everything, but that just a question of taste.
incredible texturing work, that texture-less resource pack (or whatever it was) felt like looking at a video game character without normal maps and then seeing the high poly detail xD; but in minecraft!!? truly incredible work
Would be awesome to see a season WITHOUT elytra... Could be way more fun watching
Awesome new dungeon! Maybe turn the render distance down to six or seven chunks, which is like the minimum to see the build?
It would be cool if there was first second and third place banners For who completed the course first second and third.
Next level.
I'm just speechless, 😦 that build is a masterpiece!
The government already knows what I'm about, it's too late for Express VPN
😵wow! you really outdone yourself!!
Bdubs that's something straight out of skyrim
Would be cool if you had banners to gather for every dungeon and parkour challenge and surround the tree with different ones, just an idea....
Y'know, sometimes the hermits scare me. What on Earth.
Ughhhh i love the depth so much♡♡♡ bdubs you're simply amazing
That’s stunning
Its so cool you went into depth and explained this one, now I totally want to try something like this!  That's such a smart idea for flat walls to look super detailed! I sort of want a castle-like build in my modded world (y'know, to keep dragons in duh) Now uh... I just need to figure out a gradient in modded minecraft (A PAIN!!! XD)
that Camera work is amazing, what it that with ?
I am feeling a Myst vibe for this build.
Bdubs I love your demonstration of how to use gradients or shadows, but I want to put this thought into your brain for you to have and use in the future, porque no los dos?
You blew my mind
Bedcum trail huh? 🤣
GREYdiant... he he
Got an idea for you (I actually had a dream about it) You could make elytra a part of it by having them glide from a high point maybe across water just out of render distance or something to a small island. (No rockets allowed) You could even make a nether portal to take them back to land and even have a part of the nether as the course. Since you like big prizes, the elytra could be a part of the reward 😉
A master piece
"I haven't done the inside yet" yeah we all know how Hermitcraft works.
Woow Bdubs, please do more of these building tip/tricks cause it is so usefull! I literally feel like Im learning so much about detailing watching your videos. So keep them up and Ill keep watching man ;)
its like erebor in the hobbits
Wow! It is amazing! Your use of blocks and shadows is mind blowing!
You have no idea how much this will help me. I always have issues detailing large projects, using textures in this manner really simplifies the process, if done right!
Was it really a good idea to build it next to the pillaged outpost that everyone uses for their raid farms?
Is this erebor ?
I'm blown away by the fact that build was like, only half of one episode?! Like clearly it was a lot of work, which just makes that all the more impressive!
Oh my God 13 year old me would’ve absolutely loved to unpiece this puzzle, this is wildly creative
Looks amazing
I laughed so hard when the "cheapskate" hint just said "far", you're a genius!
The way that you do your adds always gets me to leave a like. It’s so much more unique than other content creators. Keep up the great work!
My mind has melted. I can barely form words. 🤯🤯🤯
The basement gives me such civil war vibes
You are such an awesome person! keep it up with your content C:
We might have some amazing builders on the Hermitcraft server, but Bdubs is the one who truly amazes me. I mean, that underground sanctum? The tree of whimsy? Not to mention the ingenuity of the camouflage outfit and the artificial shading. Genius!
Gives me lord of the rings vibe
THIS IS TOO GOOD I'M LOSING MY MIND
The B of the double O.   Bruv you need a freaking award or a government contract or something 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Truly blown away!
Perhaps you should provide a tip jar in case the Hermits find all your dungeons.
Before 22:16 there's an outpost that tango has been to
omg, this as a topo to bottom master class of texturing! thank you bds =) you're a crazy genius! :D
How do you not have Grian/Mumbo levels of subscribers? Amazing content and super fun personality.
You could get a night vision potion to see better in your basement to make it easier to find eggs w/o going down there.
Mate calm down ur too good
Who drew an intrinsic pencil sketch in Minecraft 🔥
That entrance is incredible! Thank you so much for showing how you did the shading. You’re so talented!
You and scar need to do a big colab together the 2 of you are the best builders on the server you would make something amazing
Tango: heading to my storage system (but actually at BDubs’)  BDubs: heading to my storage system (but actually at Tango’s) If you watch both their episodes, you see it. This was great!
Damn, world just turned into cube world
This build is absolutely breathtaking
Dragon scale door!!
Let's fly 😌
Wow Bdubs! That use of gradients is extraordinary!
Grey-dïents :P
I’m so inspired by this! Definitely going to try and use this technique in my own builds!
Bdouble!!!!!!you are literally genius goddess mine!!this structure is amazing!!!!
FLAAAAAT xD
had to pause the video and comment that i literally  laughed out loud when you said 'what a perfect Redstone contraption.... someone else made'
those 10 first seconds of the video made me smile and you deserve a like before the video even starts :D
This should have trended on YouTube Gaming! Its just amazing!!
Wow...
Love his "flAt!!!" 🤣 and the door and the towers 😱😱
WOW, just WOW
What’s the mod that you use to get different perspectives of your character?
Incredible build. I've never seen anyone do so much with just shading  except in pencil. You're an artist for sure!
any hermit would take 2-3 episodes to build that, but chad bdubs only take half of the episode. impressive!
There are no words. I am in awe!!!
jaw drop amazing build
I love bdubs and his wild enthusiasm for everything it makes me so happy.
Nobody does it quite like B-dubs
E L D E N  R I N G  D O O R
These hidden locations are such a cool twist
The texturing reveal made my jaw drop. Wow!
Ah yes! Sing it sing it BdoubleO!
This build 😍
Frickin Legend! So cool Dubs.
Is that what they call a jump cut ha ha Ha
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT????
I love the way you do your ad breaks. Very customized!
dam bro even your ads look professional
It's official. Bdubs is a wizard!
Absolutely STUNNING build. Painting with blocks... Genius!!
You are the only person that I watch the ads you make lol
My goodness, what a beautiful build!! Really love it!
i know builds are your main focus, but i would've liked it if the timelapse build wasn't spoiled by the thumbnail.
Hello Bdubs! This is my formal request for episode numbers! Please think on this matter. Thank you - MJ
🤯🤯 BDubs went all out 🤯🤯
why does he do that voice??
bdubs can make the praying and hints giving from the tree of whimsey a bigger experience,   build some shrine like buildings, with a ceremony thing when getting clues so people feel special when they spend the diamonds to get the wish,  itd be fun for the viewers too
I knew you were a red stone genius but now a flat wall texture genius too. Amazing
14:08  Was that pun on purpose? Gradients/Grey-dients(or "gray" with American spelling) because of all the grey's you're working with.
sir- SIR-- THAT IS INSANE-
absolutely unbelievably  fantastic.   when you first  zoomed out, i said "holy s***" out loud!  you are a true artist .
Ni
Hi
BDubs, your builds this season all look amazing. Last season, I thought your building couldn’t get any better, but now it’s all amazing. The ruins look great, this new doorway, your tower and the ruins around it, and especially the basement. The basement blew me away. Your builds this season look so great!
I really enjoy your videos BD. Great job on all of it.
I am really impressed by the puzzle/parkour 'dungeon' - real clever I don't think my small brain would figure it out, not to mention the parkour skills!
That is amazing with the colours/texture..  insane
B dubs, you need to make commercials as a side gig. Yours are the only ones I don’t skip. Always clever!
Base-a-monte
I'm totally mind-blown over that amazing Gothic building! Awooow! 😍😍 You are such a fantastic builder! 🤘
i've seen and heard a lot of minecraft builders talking about using texture's for your build to more look "pop"  but Bdubs doesn't make texture's pop.... he MIND BLEW IT!!!!!
That's the best thing ever, you're the best builder in Minecraft!
A cheap clue should be: you can pay more diamonds for better clues.
Bdo breaks my brain everytime
the hobbit
THE PRICING! Cuts to the biggest smile in Minecraft 😂
If I’m completely honest, first time watching you bro. You had me dying laughing at the random screaming you did. Your voice is gold and I can’t stop laughing glad I clicked !
You should team up with Tango to make your dungeons more lively and challenging
This is what happens when you miss episodes lol
that's beautiful
Just a heads-up; you knocked the rail off (while collecting the minecart) when you were resetting the tower.
"it will take seven days." And that's coming from a guy who made an entire mountain overnight last season. Looking forward to the build.
24:28 Wow, that banner on the white of the tree... gives me the same vibes as the first time I went to The Tower in the Destiny beta
That VPN ad killed me, 2 seconds into the ad and I'm already dead
A M A Z I N G
Couldn't you make more money by having them travel through the nether? You can even make it where if they pay extra they get in a boat and ice. Or if they pay extra extra there's a magical portal that cuts the distance.
Minecraft biome: Sahara
that's what they do with makeup and shows!!! way to go :)
I love how “someone” made that basement, in perfect Bdub style 😂
It’s savanna not Sahara one of the largest deserts in the world
You are amazing
ask cub to help you make the door open PLS 😁
3:35 "Some kids call this a neo"...judging from the text chat in Tango's stream? Cub and Gem are now 'some kids'
It’s savanna not sahara
Oooowwwweeee 😍 that is a pretty gate. Makes me wanna open the game and slam down some blocks. Bdubs is the texture king.
the door to the dungeon remindes me of the old textures from old 3d games when they usind the same ways of depth by just having textrues on flat surfaces
didn’t come up in my sub area. UGH
that parkour challenge was amazing to watch tango derp on
Calling a savannah a sahara, lolo
The shadow and highlight play is beyond genius. Bdubs is inspired and inspirational.
I love how BDubs refers to the camera as us. "Lemme walk to you." I feeel so immersed!
I loved watching Tango find and work through that amazing parkour dungeon puzzle! Amazing design in terms of aesthetics, prizes, and mechanics. I wonder if there is a different way for you to share your work in your videos, though. It's super cool that you're making content opportunities for other hermits, but your POV ends up a little disjointed. Maybe Tree of Whimsy style you can show off you discovering a new dungeon, but not show any spoilers and then later weave together the winner's footage with a little commentary about lore, etc. I know it's kind of duplicate footage , but since you can't post it until after someone completes it you're not stepping on their toes so much. And if you cut their adventure down to highlights and add your commentary viewers of both channels won't get bored. But in this way your channel will get the better experience of exploring the builds in a more in-depth first-person surprising sort of way. I know tone doesn't come across well on YouTube comments, so I'll clarify this is just a thought, but I love what you're doing, amazing season!
Seeing the thumbnail: Bdubs wth? Bdubs? NO. Calm down Bdubs! Watching the video: this is bother better and worse than my expectations.
"Don't be like this guy, be like me" I love bdubs 💚
That build is so awesome
He started singing "Come Fly with me" and I immediately started singing Ren and Stimpy's version "Come Fry with me, Come Fry, Let's fry an egg" I'm done! 🤣
That’s just ridiculous!!!!! Also not over done at all!! It’s perfect!
Oh no. He's learned color theory!!
Love the optical illusion created by the block gradients.
Getting that much texture out of a flat surface is insane
With how much BDubs called the savannah “Sahara”, I have become convinced the great gate lies in the largest desert in Africa
That looks so awesome!
Who made Bdubs' basement?
Just when i get used to people texturing, Bdubz takes it to the next level. That is just... glorious
Next level
That dungeon entrance is absolutely incredible! The use of different shades to create depth and texture is really artistic, I love it!
.
This is AMAZING!!!
You should get mumbo to make the door redstone now that he’s back
That texturing and grading is like an optical illusion. You can't tell it's there unless you are up close. That's what a good illusion does to you. Excellent job Bdubs
Hold up, when I saw the thumbnail I thought this was a Building With Bdubs episode. You absolute BEAST
Dang, this world is going to be like LOTR by the end of the season.
I love how this episode started exactly like one of the Attack of the B-Team episodes. With the "Come fly with me". So nostalgic. And still a lovely voice, Bdubs. <3
I can't tell if you were planning this for a while or thought of this because of your forays into sketching on paper, but either way, this is SO COOL.
I think this goes to show how much of an effect texturing had in a build! Really impressive work! Also, I live the idea of the Tree of Whimsy acting like a sort of Shiekah Stone. (If you've played the Legend of Zelda games, you'll know what I mean.)
Oh my goodness that Dungeon is gorgeous . Thanks for showing us tips on texturing so cool. Makes you want to build the same thing
If none of the hermits pay for clues and conquer the dungeon, you could always sell tango the gate for decked out
Cool texturing
This man is so good at building, he doesnt even need optifine to create shadows Is2g
You are seriously next level bdubs! Amazing!!!
Dude that is amazing! Love your buiilds and that gate is so cool 💜
You continue to outdo yourself
Bdubs: no one knows the trick about the candle  The observer: I quite literally give everything away. Any of the hermits that's see me will know
This is absolutely insane!!! Awesome build!!
Bdubs: "I don't wanna steal diamonds" His clues: "The dungeon is in this world"  LOL man Bdubs you're the best
You’ve outdone yourself bdubs.  It’s beautiful!!
Bro, you ruined me. Now I'm watching other vids like a connoisseur of gradients. "Mmm, yes, this gradient work is from late 2021. You really should review the artist Bdubs work from '22 on. *sip*" Absolutely wonderfully done. Also, got my headphones in today, looking forward to trying em out! :D
That build is just staggering, You are head and shoulders above everyone else.
obsessed with the deepslate/cobbled deepslate pattern
Bring back the Diversity series!!
12:25 That's one fine looking GREY-dient you got there my good man. P.s. you could always change the render distance to stop people finding clues about the locations.
Ppl always saying grian is the building king but I think Bdubs could easily take that title in the near future.
Might have to steal that texturing.
This build is evidence that Minecraft can be used to make art.
Hermitcraft is really going to the next level this season
Bdubs: gradients from dark on bottom to light on top isn’t realistic Grian: *physical pain*
yooooo this texture is insane. Thank you for showing the white world so we could see how much you accomplished with color!!! Honestly so inspiring
See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.   (Deuteronomy 32:39-41) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
The build looks phenomenal!! 😍
this is art
Art 101 w bdubs: shading and shadows
Incredible. The technical aspects to your builds and how you apply art concepts is always so impressive
Absolutely stunning. Bdubs is just so talented
The door is tantalizingly delicious! And I mean that. I'm salivating over it.
Okay... Not even finished yet but had to pause to comment. When you switched to the white world I was genuinely blown away with how flat it was. Bdubs you genuinely are an artist... not just an amazing builder but someone who can use your medium to portray your vision to the fullest!   You are an inspiration to me!  Bravo
This is a work of art.
"It's in a Sahara"  I'm pretty sure the Sahara is a desert. LOL 😅
The texture swap with the white blue my mind. Amazing
this is next level building!
gray-dient. heh
Wow that is crazy.
"I don't want to steal diamonds, but I guess that's what we do"   - man of whimsy
HOly sMoKeS Bdubs!! What a true masterpiece 👏  WOW
Dang I'm loving the texture as much as the whole build! 😍😍😍
Anybody get old Yogscast vibes from that opening drumroll? Or am I just showing my age
I can't beleave it ! we got a Bduds timelaps !!! YAY !
Amazing!
Holy cow
epic
BDubs needs to stop referring to BDubs in the third person. Lol. The build is pretty mindblowing.
BDubz life skills, make flat surfaces have depth 🤔🤔🤔
does anyone know in which video tango completed the dungeon? or did he not upload it, because i can't find it
Lmao I'm a unicorn.
How about instead of a far distance for not paying very much, have the directions point to a regular diamond pickax. They pay more, they get directions to a pickax with varying levels of fortune on it. Then have one of the prizes at the end be diamond ore blocks.
Revelation: Bdoubleo100 is a spaceship 18:24
BDUBS THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILD IVE EVER SEEN I LOVE IT SO MUCH
Insane build
I think you just threw down the gauntlet to all builder types, this “gate” is next level.
This build is absolutely gorgeous and amazing
you are the inspiration to me still playing minecraft for almost a decade
literally painting with minecraft blocks
I hope you don't burn yourself out with how much building it's taking to make this dungeon... You just built a mindbogglingly big structure off camera and need to put in a huge amount of work for the interior too. Don't break your back on this
I normally hate diorite, the out door ruins make it look hella awesome, it’s a fitting colour and style
B-Dubs if u make another crown, can u put curse of binding and vanishing on it pls? That way your prizes are more coveted 😉
bdubs you have the cleanest thumbnails!!
When he said the ledge wasn't actually a ledge my brain started to explode
B-Dubs...The Bob Ross of Minecraft
Bdubs?? we left Sahara in Season 6...
That's crazy how hard it is to find you on YouTube, I don't know what kind of problem YouTube algorythm has with you but that's so weird...
This looks like a spot in the weeping peninsula in Elden Ring
That gate turned out like a real life painting! It looks insane sitting in the MC world. Wow!
That gate looks amazing!
I love your style this season. It reminds me of attack of the b team which was my favorite series you’ve done
I absolutely LOVE your castle-ish types of builds! They are ALWAYS exceptional builds! Now that you've started doing the texturing, these builds are exquisite! I both admire and envy your artistic capabilities using nothing but blocks! Always fun to watch your episodes! Love you bro! Keep up the great work!
"texturing gradients has become a trend over the past year with builders"  Proceeds to overshadow and completely destroy the competition.  I like the detail of the stone sections at the pillars. Realistically the people that built this structure would've extracted those huge blocks and transported them to the site. Otherwise, no tech would be advanced enough to move the gigantic pillar, except for in-situ carving of the mountain. Also a really good grasp on humidity stains and such. It really looks ancient
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! The man is unreal at building in Minecraft.
That build reminds me of the pictures I would stare at as a child and it would form a 3d picture. That is so awesome.
The commercial you reminds me of a young Kramer from Seinfeld.
WOW
Love how he just casually walked into tangos base and stole some of his blackstone.
It was so helpful to see the build with no texture! You can really see how much texturing can change a build! You are absolutely inspiring, crazy, and just so talented :D
The fact that this isn't even your base is so absolutely ridiculous.
These builds, only for game-purpose, put all my bases to absolute shame! so amazing!
Amazing as always bdubs!
ayo?! what kind of minecraft black building magic is this
BDub’s ily but please it’s a savannah
Bdubs, that's breathtaking.
the dungeon entrance is beautiful! i love how this season a load of hermits don’t care about diamonds as much and are just here to vibe, it’s so nice to see all the interactions
cahconponcrete powder
Tango said it best - don't let Bdubs fool you, the man is a genius.   I can't believe you made trompe l'oeil in minecraft, you crazy talented builder!
This is one of the best builds I've ever seen, wow!
Since when is BDubs a Hippie?
I used to watch all of your vids in my mc phase like 9 years ago, humbling too see you're at it with the same enthusiasm/charisma ! much respect brotha, cheers.
Super cool how you use texturing !
Bdubs isnt a builder; he's an artist.
You have just changed Minecraft wow!
this is what I was hoping the other cave based hermits were gonna do. You're the only one who served.
That's the coolest build I've seen ever. That's what gradient builds should be.
That gate is AMAZING!!  Well done BDubs, you done HC proud!
Now a BDu s perfect redstone and open up that door ;p
Speak friend and enter
mastery of texturing!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life7
That's a great build.
Duude this is Awesome!!
I just got to say your Sinatra impression is on point
Wow! I’m mesmerised by the simplicity of your complex thoughts 😁 love your work and face BDubs ♥️
sahara... oh god the season 6 memories
Love the 'pillars of creation' as your background. i love astronomy
This is amazing 👏
This is exactly the type of look impulse needs in his dwarven Imp-ire.
Bdubs just changed the entire genre of minecraft building with one video
B-dubs you need to put a tip box at each of your puzzle towers. Then even if people are not buying clues, they can leave a tip when they go to do the tower and appreciate the work you have done. It has worked well for JoehIlls at the guppy geyser
It'd be really cool if you made clues based on landmarks either being crazy land generation or some of your already found dungeons like "go to the ruins of the parkour king the banner shall lead the way" and put maybe little Easter eggs (not the hermit kind) in your future dungeons for maybe little clues that the most ambitious might be able to find
Oh BDubs! What a beautiful  build! Even after seeing  it in white my eyes told me it had textures.  You are the master builder. I bow before you.
The King of Hermitcraft has released his latest episode. Thank you your majesty
Bread WHAT trail???
You could make towers and pillars sticking out of the mountain, maybe even one with a dragon wrapped around it >:D
what camera mode do you use
Please Please let it be that BDubs built the Pillager Outpost as a red herring :)
Scared about that pillager outpost there giving away a location
Bubs should sell dungeon souvenirs, after a dungeon is completed other hermits can do the quest and buy a mini version or painting of the real prize like a tiny parkour king crown. One of the dungeons or quests could involve potion making but one or all of the ingredients are souvenir items.
Has Bdubs been playing Elden Ring? lol your builds this season are very similar to structures in that game.
honestly, that terrain is very cool
I love insane building in the mountain. 😀
Bedubs. How do you get the beautiful fog in your Wourlds?
26:15 ah yes Bdubs the bread cum trail 😂😂
That is a stunning build. The texture trick to add fake depth is genius. I'm so inspired by this one.
This concept is honestly revolutionary.
I've been following you for a long time my friend, and you always surprise me. It is very visible how other youtubers are inspired by their style
I do hope your _clue_ keeps saying Sahara instead of Savanna so the other hermits are out looking in deserts 22:59
Me: looking at hermitcraft BdoubleO100: LOOK AT MAHH MEGA GATE
Holy smokes that gate! I love it! And thank you for giving some insight on the gradients and builds. Im definately going to try some of it out. And once again, I love the whole idea of the adventures and secrets. Keep it coming 💙
I can't believe you added baking normals and bump maps to your texturing repertoire in vanilla minecraft.  That's fabulous and the results were even better than I could've expected!  Genius work for a redstoner ;)
Amazing
Someone get this man a beacon!
Bdubs talking about how to use gradients: 👑 My brain: 💥
Guys? I think Bdoubs just took building to a new level...What is the procedure?
The parkour is amazing! Edit: Omg! That portal / Entrense is pompous as fk. (Had to watch without sound)
How are you able to do such incredible builds each week? You've stepped it up so much this season and become one of my favorite builders in the entire Minecraft community. Keep up the amazing work!
I cant describe in words how beautiful that is! :')
Bdubs smahes it. Perfect Texture Stone
Love the episode and internal commercials you do.
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
'BELIEVE IT OR NOT'
All beings who have reached the God consciousness identify with the one God and share a oneness of thought. Innumerable beings in the universe share this consciousness which we seek to obtain. With every negative action, and every negative thought and feeling, you untiringly draw a new cataclysm nearer. Try to keep the state of inner peace and harmony during most of the day.
"Because I don't hate myself, I'm gonna cheat!" Genuine laugh out loud moment. :) Bdubs, never change.
sometimes I feel like hermitcraft is an art lesson!
Bdubs on trending? Yes ma' boi! You deserve this!
That texturing is god level. I love it!
I like this resident evil like puzzle you got there 👀
Absolutely amazing. Thank you for sharing that tip for the shading and showing an overhang that doesn't exist. Definitely one I will put to much use. Absolute genius!
This is an excellent optical illusion!
I'm blown away by how good bdubs has gotten at building over the years
Not only have you elevated the art of texturing, but you've also elevated the art of "I haven't done the inside yet".
Tango and Bdubs is one of the best duos ever, every time they're together it's magic 😊
You should sell 1 time use items to complete the dungeons
Someone’s been enjoying Elden Ring!
Ok bdubs jazzzzz
What an incredible build!
Whenever I'm introducing someone to minecraft, I always show them yours and Scar's builds to help them start to understand the infinite possibilities in this amazing game. ❤
Complete mad man, but.a very talented one
Bdubs, you are CHANGING the Minecraft texturing and detailing game! Revolutionary design! I'm simply blown away.
Maybe the tree of whimsi is a parkore course as well, with easier clues in easier to get to areas, hard ones in harder to get to locations. The clue difficulty being related by its availability.
Painterly BDubs...just incredibly painterly!
if (bDubsSays = "Sahara") {     return "Savana"; }
"The Pomcrete Powder" had me dying 😆
That looks like how Skyrim textures their models, like it looks 3D but then you go up to it and it’s flat. I’m sure a lot of video games do that, very smart bdubs, love the build 👍
hehe graydients 14:00
Savanna. Not Sahara ahah
I can't wait for other hermits to find this dungeon!  I can already hear them getting so excited about the texturing and shading!
that looks awesome
loving the way you do the series now epic man
Sadly they will find the location because there is an Outpost in the area
Bdubs has ascended
I can say without exaggeration that you are one of the best minecraft builders I know of
BDubs, you are a wizard.
Imagine if you put curse of binding on it XD
Is it just me or does Bdubbs ceremonial robe make him look like he should be sitting in a garbage can complaining about the giant bird. 😂 I want one of the hermits to build a giant trash can for him 😂
Thats the most gorgeous building I've ever seen in MC, I think. You are  genious, Bdubs!
Another outstanding episode with so much effort! Also, the editing is fabulous BDubs. Truly top notch. Thank you.
I am in love with this build
this. is. SO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL!!
does there happen to be a new diversity map? because that parkour dungeon just gave me PTSD flashbacks and now i want you and genny to partner again for some LOL
This is pure GENIUS !
Dude your idea for this season is so epic!!! I just watched this after finishing a 16 hour shift and it was such a joy 🥹
uhhh it is a ... GRAY-dient!
If we tell hermits its in the sahara they indeed not gonna search in savanna
That texturing is honestly extraordinary! I've never seen anything like it before. WOW!
What an inspiring build! That texturing is insane!
<3
The textures are AMAZING
Absolutely stunning build! Master texturing skills 👌👌
I am loving these new camera angles they are just enhancing Bdubs comedy
Bread cum trail
Everytime I watch U build I am more shocked. You are amazing 😄
This is the best build I have ever seen in vanilla Minecraft! It's incredible! Can't wait to see the inside!
"is that not insane?" look... I gotta admit... It's kinda insane! amazing job!
Welcome back! No pressure on videos! You are doing great! Have fun! Take breaks! We love you!
this is amazing
Bdubs is on his elden ring phase of bulding, and im loving every second of it. You sir never fail to exceed my expectations!!!
That beautiful build is just for a dungeon!?!? Your a wizard bdubs!
You mad man, this is great
smash
that's a mega base level build door😭😍and it's just for dungeon build
"Is this magic!?" "Everything in this world is magic, except for the magician."  Except Bdubs is a magical magician himself. Amazing build!
Wow. This is unfair, B-Dubs.
I am OBSESSED with this build
BDUBZ! I hope you clue is "Savanna" not sahara
the tree seems pretty whimsical about who it gives good clues to
just make it your megabase bdubs
What would be cool is if every dungeon had a different banner to collect and everytime a banner was claimed it'd be put on the tree of wymsby
Im so glad Bdubs came back to Hermitcraft.
I watch a lot of HermitCraft, but I've never watched one of budbs' videos before, but I ONLY clicked this video because of the thumbnail. THAT build is ABSOLUTELY out of the WORLD!!!!!!
So impressive
You’re bringing me joy bdubs
Gradient Goat! Really didnt expect that
Kinda got darksouls elden ring vibes
Speechless, yet again. I want to claw my own eyes out so I never see another build again because nothing will ever compare.  How do u do dis
what bdubs did here is the equvilent of a normal map in 4d art, its still flat, but it looks like there is detail!
Incredible, just....wow!
I legit dont understand how a humans brain can forumulate and craft something so perfect. I am blown away.
That build was amazing !!! It reminded me of how you make 3D models and add texture on top. Even if the base is fairly simple, it looks extremely rendered and detailed!
Wow, I'm totally in awe of BDub's texturing skills, beautiful building!
He always manages to blow us away :)
Omg, you are just on another level. I love your builds :)
My jaw is on the floor. Honestly. It dropped for the reveal. But when he showed the lack of depth mind was actually blown. Bdubs you’re a master of your craft. Sincerely.
Building, editing, entertaining. Bdubs you’re a genius.
Bdubs.. are you not using a beacon? All that digging with no beacon!?
I learned something new today !
Bdubs, if you have your flame bow with you, you can light a candle with the arrow of fire
You should rope mumbo in to make that door a huge piston door going into the floor!
I like how some hermits are starting their megabases in focused locations, but BDubs here is essentially turning the whole server into his megabase as he spreads ruins and places of interest far and wide. I feel like in a month or two some of the others will start making requests for him to add some kind of feature to their bases just so they get included in the lore of these quests.
Bdubs is an artist 🔥
He always make awesome episodes
That minecart trick reminds me of a certain Super Hostile memory
Holy cow that looks incredible. Thats easily the coolest gate ive ever seen wow
This guy loves you to death
the texture on that door blew me away it looks so good! will definintely play around more with this :)
Bdubz should really team up with some adventure map makers to make an amazing adventure!
this is the beginning of a revolution of building in minecraft
Grian is regarded as the best Minecraft builder but I think Bdubs actually holds that title. His ability to detail on such a small or large scale is crazy
how do you always outdo youself
That Gradient... I learn so much from watching your videos and well, they are entertaining as well... Your Storage Room - Tango's Storage. XD
Bdubs! This texturing was amazing, I learned so much from just you showing that off! That's incredible!
The illusion of the rims popping out when it's not even there is just, **chef's kiss**
Next level. I love it!
Savannah?
Love the build ideas/style this season.
i can't find the words to describe how good your builds are. they are just amazing!
Awesome texturing!!!
So, that Illager outpost kinda could be used to give away the location. Unless Bdubs built it just to mess with people lol
All the Hermit's are blowing me away this season!!!👍
SAHERRA!!!  Haha!  Love your vids.
this gate is incredible
This build is seriously unreal
what kinda trail bdubs?
Bdubs I'm so impressed! That looks so cool!!
This literally painting in Minecraft
everyone: build with depth if you want to improve your builds  bdubs: nah
Sahara
18:09 the way bdubs used the gradients really made the build on a whole different level
really love the customized advertisement every single time, it at least makes me want to watch the whole thing
I was kinda sad, I thought the tree of whimsy was going to be an Etho reference to his poor tree that kept getting burned down.
Bruhhhhhhh. I really thought that bdubs was tripping with this gradient thing, but when I saw the finished product from a little far away, I was blown. Damnn I am a garbage builder and I should always treat his words like facts 😂😂😂. If he says the gradient will work, then it WILL work
BDubs this is so freaking cool!! Inspiration!
I can’t get over the texturing on his big tree and now he shows up with that Caste front. Just amazed.
Looking like shadow of the colossus. Magnificent!
Bdubs:”it’s in a Sahara.” Me: HOLY MOLY he’s hidden in in season six!
That is straight up ingenious!
I would love to see this technique integrated with your normal texturing techniques that you use on a small scale to get just a phenomenal build even more than how amazing this already is.
this is one of my fav bdubs builds ever the gradient blew me away most creative builders on hermitcraft imo
23:10 Savanna
I think the texturing is pretty amazing, but just one ring of blocks to actually form a ledge would make it logical even up close.  oh also use stone buttons on the rotten patch on the tree of Whimsy to separate the tiers? it blends in a bit better.
WOW. Gorgeous build!
The “breadcrumb” mishap at the end caught me off guard and made me literally laugh out loud!
This is awesome, Bdubs!
Hermits are known for not doing the backside i know but now they're not even doing the inside
Amazing work, Bdubs! Hope you're not putting too much pressure on yourself with all this insane building! We love your videos, but make sure you take care of yourself, too.
Hermitwood set designer.
Wow! Your building has always been absolutely amazing. This season though, it's been next level. Can't wait to see more!
that texturing actually broke my brain, when you flipped to all white like HOW?!!!  its so good.
I’ve never seen a gradient used that way, what a mad lad.
good god, every episode i am absolutely awed by the monumentality and CARE you put into your builds.
Bah bah Bdubs, is your docket full? Yes sir, yes sir, 7 days of digging out this big mountain dungeon then filling it with goodies and danger and puzzles before I can sell my first clue
B dubs needs to make the entrance to decked out 2
You gotta put your creative powers to use on the server and make a Bdubs original 'optical illusion maze'
Bdubs this is actually such an eye opener. Thank you for being such an inspiration wow
minecraft is such a game for artists and you are one of the best artists around
Pure art, I love it
Oh my god he made 3rd dimension on a 2D flat surface. that literally blew my mind
Dubs is truely a magician at builds in Minecraft. I always find his so inspiring.
The illager outpost at around 22:00 in the video will make it *much* easier to find this location. Sorry but don't include generated structures in the videos for your builds.
6:58 lmao
the way he created the illusion of an extra layer of blocks on the pillar is just insane.
Please tell me this will be the next thing in building large structures.
Bdubs tunnel best tunnel 😂😂😂
Bdubs! You got me crackin up the whole time and I ain’t even halfway through! This why you’ve stayed my fave YouTuber all these years. ❤️👑
i feel that bdubs is single headedly changing the way builds will look in all of minecraft as a whole. i amongst thousands of others are absolutely going to be using that gradient trick! thank you for inspiring us all to be greater and bolder artists!
D&D feels this season
Wow. This is beautiful. It’s hard to get over the fact you did this in bloody survival
it may be a good idea to lower render distance whenever you build/visit your dungeons especially when building on the surface as opposed to building underground. Hope you sell those clues, bdubs!
Bruh! that deepslate pleated with cobbled deepslate is fire! <3
This is one of my all time favorite builds, hats off to the legend bdubs!
This is one of the craziest builds I’ve seen in a while. I can’t wait to see what else you do with this new style
For if she does not call you Lord, she is not Wife material. Saith Old Testament God of Destruction, who used the flood.
Jaw dropping
Casually revolutionizing building meta in minecraft, I can see lots of people using this technique in the future
A BDUBS TIMELAPSE?! Unheard of!
BDubs needs some kind of award these builds are chefs kiss
I think you can rent a becon from Impulse, help you with this darling build of yours. This season of hermitcraft is starting to feel very D&D
The implied cuts in the stone is masonry genius! Chef's kiss and tbh a little bit of a bottom lip bite. So good.
15:12 bdubs playing with GRAYdients
This is the most stunning thing I have ever seen built in Minecraft! Holy crap!
Bdubs is on another level <3
16:40 so basically you're combining techniques of traditional minecraft and principles of pixel art
You should wear a pumpkin when showing off the new locations! Maybe that could help Also I believe you can just right click a compass onto a banner and that will lead you to it! No netherite needed
Sadly this is the type of gate build I was hopping impulse used for his dwarvin entrance.
I always love watching your building change. I always think there’s no way he can surprise me again. But you never fail to impress me and give me inspiration. Gorgie!!!! Love it
Yesssss
this is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL build. i am astounded at how much is going on visually, when its just static and mostly flat! Bdubs this is a huge achievement.
Bdubs' Dungeons Data Pack when?
I s2g the villager texture reveal made me laugh in disbelief; that is honestly incredible
That is amazing 🤩
.
I don't comment often, but I thought that texturing was absolutely amazing. It's definitely one of my biggest struggles with building in Minecraft, and seeing it done so masterfully is really really cool.
I'm sorry... WHAT?! I knew you were a great builder but... 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
You are awesome. This's crazy. The texture's sick!!!
With the new juke box mod getting added to the server, you should make custom disks that are you saying the clues. So you could set up an Armor stand with your face and when they pay the disk is okayed but it gives the illusion of you telling them the clue. It’d be cool if you had a tavern where you were the bar tender sending them on question giving clues for a tip
Have you considered selling keys to the dungeons?
This is crazy. My brain is still trying to process that build.
Bdubs~ Can I get a Shoutout? I''m a huge fan of Hermitcraft! I'm from Philippines! <3 I love your videos! <3 ^_^ Hope you and the other hermits have more fun in this season! <3
You could have cords as a hint, and hide a chest or barrel in the bedrock, with a cpmpass or something
That is amazing!
Bdubs doing some michelangelo type work
This amazing build has me thinking, what if the hermits don't find the gate right away... what if the clues you sell have questlines...   Example A: "meet the spice trader in the savanna to learn more..." (coordinates), leading to a destroyed camp with a note from the trader that they fled to a 'mystical sanctuary protected by the spirits' in the north... and in the north is a tree with a whimsical air to it and a pond with a door at the bottom that leads to the sanctuary and there's the trader but they are injured and need the curing fruit from the sister tree in the west.... and there's a tree in the west guarded inside a pillager camp... then after giving the fruit to the trader (or dispenser) they tell you the location of the other thing which all leads to the grand reveal...    Right?
that gate could definitely pass as a megabase
Amazing!!
Videos like these just reaffirm that bdubs is the most talented builder of all time
Thoughts on the clues: If you are going to have multiple dungeons available simultaneously, you should label each clue with which dungeon it applies to (eg. dungeon #1, dungeon #2)... otherwise it will start to be a nightmare to keep track of them all for both you & the other hermits.  Thoughts on where to hide the dungeons: you actually might want to start hiding them underground, within the general play area/proximity to other hermit's bases. Not TOO close, & not within the bases themselves... as we've seen with past 'secret' builds they actually get discovered pretty quickly... but maybe something like the distance from Gary the Goat to Doc's village would remain hidden but be findable given clues.
Bdubs: Sahara Me: ... Bdubs: Saheera Me: o.O Bdubs: Sahiraiaiai Me: Savanna, you mean? 😳
You should use artifacts found at the ruins that work as keys (named objects with redstone stuff) to start the dungeons once they're found and sell them with the clues to find the dungeons.
Mr. BDubs that build is a work of art
We need an underground parkour place where you parkour down then upto a banner you can see from ground but it is caged off
Me thinking I’m good at building Bdubs building his castle me ok that’s cheating
Some hermit flew by those peaks already i swear
Pomprete powder
Actual genius damn
It looked so good I thought it was his megabase enterance
Amazing build. You’re white vs textured segment reminded me of early 2000’s game engine demos where they were showing off bump/normal mapping. Awesome stuff.  Def recommend talking to Tango for a Beacon arrangement. Sure he’d love to ‘help’ you out.  Any chance of collaborating on a few of these? Would love a BDubs/Pearl build. I’m thinking of the animals/monsters you guys could work in to the scenery. Your colour and lighting and her animal shapes? 🤩 !!
My eyebrow was up while you were explaining the shadows and I wasn't buying it but WOW! That looks amazing! Looking forward to the tutorial vid ;) 👍
wait, what kind of trail?!?
Holy moly Bdubs.... how the heck do you even? I can't even! So good!!! There's a point where it goes from "professional gamer" into "artist"... I'm comfortable with saying this is artistry, 100%
I really wish i could like the video multiple times 😂😂 gotta love bdubs✨
Lol that ad was hilarious 😂! I watch all the ads you make because they are actually good!
wow... the texturing looks so amazing. it feels like it works best for large builds so its really fitting for the dungeon structure.
Bdubs you're getting too good for your own good
What a beautiful texture!
Whaaaaaat. That textured build is epic. It's just beautiful... Impulse should have had that as a dwarven gate that lead deep into the mountain.
Another stunning build by BDubs 🤯 mans a texturing genius
I'm absolutely speechless. Great video.
Prettiest build on the server
The story you're weaving this season is really well done, I'm so excited to see what is to come!!!
I's about time somebody textured like that, used gradients to create depth.I tend to be someone who is rather hesitant to legitimately think someone did a good job with art things (I do say it more than I mean it because I still want to be supportive), but this legitimately gets some brownie points from me. Great job, Bdoubs.
Personally I would make the prices be 1 diamond block for a low level clue, 2 for a medium, and 3 for upper tier. Easier to store and people will see "3 Diamond Blocks" as being cheaper than "27 diamonds" because psychologically we prefer the lower number even if it's a larger unit
18:09 is the reason why bdubs is my fav builder
14:30 _banana_
That gate is just superb! That texturing just blows me away.
How DARE you, Bdoubs! "Much cooler than a unicorn-" unicorns are awesome!
This build is so amazing
Big level up on the textures!
That door is insane! Love the texturing!
Bdubs is becoming quite the pixel artist! The build is gorgeous and I can't wait to see what's inside (from you or from someone else!)
Holly Cow Bdubs, I am really impressed with this build, You really are a master builder.
bdubs, i really enjoy your creative vision and they way you make your videos, for people artistically challenged like me it'll always be inspiring and amazing to watch your creations
I love the elden ring influence. The verticality of it all is stunning!
my jaw actually dropped at that build reveal its so sick looking wow
Wow. Well done!
Bdubs!  That was jaw-dropping!  Amazing art!
Absolutely jaw-dropping!!!! Well done : )
The build is breathtaking... quite literally took my breath away when it was revealed. Texture King!
Love watching you build man. Building a MASSIVE BUILD myself… castlevania castle and library under it from the Netflix series Castlevania. Gonna be crazy big and my first major build as well!
Mumbo builds a simple hut and says it takes him too much time to gather resources. BDubs dig out an entire mountain and builds a mesmerizing build while not complaining one bit. I love him.
Welcome to Bump Mapping with Bdubs!
Bdubs the trendsetter!  Thx for sharing
Anyone else see a floppy eared rabbit on that facade?
Everyone: Savannah Bdubs: SAHARA
Top quality work my dude, your videos are the best
Unfortunately you left an easy clue to find the location the pillager outpost.
Tango has been Bdubbed the parkour king.
The immense stone gate build is epic ! 🙌 The texturing is amazing and the depth effect is so cool.   Massive respect for Bdubs as always for his incredible builds. Really loving the adventures he's taking us and the whole server on. The amount of love that's put into it is so appreciated. Hope Bdubs knows that he can take a break from doing these epic builds and adventures if he feels like doing so. 😊
you should have used a night vision potion down in the basement, would probably have seen any heads easily
- + & far = far northeast?
Wow, the gate design sure was genius!
You should make that giant door a piston door! Hire doc or mumbo when he returns!
Every hermit: I'm gonna start building my mega base!  Bdubs: **builds mega-base-like dungeons like a champ everywhere**
that's NUTS! please include more of these tutorial/thought processes in your videos!! absolutely amazing work, i'm going to try it out!
No words can explain how amazing the build was as always Bdubs your such a great builder I like the shadow trick you did and it gives a whole new way to do a gradient
Bdouble-anksy over here with that texturing!
I love hearing the thoughts process for the challenge, there was more hints then I thought there was.  Also, WOW the new challenge blew my mind with how the texture made the much depth
Crumbpasses?
MEGA BDUBS MONEY IDEA:  To maximize profit and replay-ability, for the hermits that don’t come in first to complete a dungeon, you could add a side shop to the tree with “Mythic Curios” fun, cool and interesting cosmetic items. These Curios would only be obtainable through Dungeon Coins. 1 coin + first completion prize to the Hermit that conquers the dungeon first. 1 coin for all other hermits that complete the dungeon. Set the price of the curios at 2-3 coins based on the number of dungeons made and set the coin limit to 1 per first individual completion of a dungeon.   Doing this will inscentive other Hermits to come out and conquer old dungeons for that sweet curio loot. While also netting more foot traffic (and diamonds) spent at the Tree of Wisdom.
"bread crumb trail with the compasses!!" LOL
I learned a lot about building from this video. You should go in depth more often!
I can't remember the last time I saw a minecraft build that blew my mind like these gates. I am in awe, just dumbfounded.
Here is my suggestion for the clues! It would involve you having specific items for each clue level's payment. I think maybe a diamond block = easy, a netherite scrap/ancient debris = medium, and a netherite ingot = best. Then, have the players do that redstone thing where you drop a specific item on the ground and it gets picked up by a hopper minecart with an item sorter. If it's the correct item, they get the corresponding clue. That way, you could be not on the server and they could still buy clues.
Bdubs, you are next level.  Amazing.
Amazing!!!!!
This use of gradients is nothing short of a new level in building! I haven't yet mastered using gradients as a baseline, but you can believe I'm bookmarking this!
"ok not derpy but cool" is so far best line of season 9.
26:14
This is art!
"boy that was good clue for 20 diamonds" 😂😂😂😂
absolutely gorgeous thumbnail
Wow sooo good bdubs!!! Keep going soooo coool!!!!
Artistic genius Bdubs
That texturing is awesome! Doing that plain pack to show how it pops was a really really good way to showcase it!
"Because I don't hate myself"...Yep, Bdubs, that sums up my take on parkour courses in general!
Bdubds.. you are AMAZING!!! love that castle so much!!!
This is actually mind blowing
I have only watch 0:01, and liked the video for the thumbnail alone.
Casually just busting out one of the most beautiful minecraft builds I think I've ever seen.  Well done my friend!
The cobble deep /deepslate scale pattern is a new favoutire!  Gonna set that up as a cathedral floor, so simple but so very standout!
Bdubs: don’t tell them where it is! Don’t look around!!! Also Bdubs: shows a pillager tower
Holy smokes this is some next-level stuff
This seed is gorgeous, who picked it?
Bdubs needs a patron to provide him with shulkers and resources.
Hahahahhaa your videos always crack me up BDubs 😂👏🏼👏🏼 coupled with your amazing builds and I know your videos are always going to be fantastic 🤗👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
That gate is gorgeous BDubs!  We’re not worthy.
DUNGEONzzzzzz!  The door turned out insane! Well done
"T I A" THIS IS ART
I love the texturing you did
Bdubs: Fun *little* adventure Also Bdubs: *builds an adventure location larger than some of the mega bases in the last seasons of hermitcraft*  Love the look though
Do I need to remind you guys that this is just a game he's making? IT IS NOT HIS BASE LIKE BRO *DAMN*
My jaw just dropped when I saw the build, so incredible!!
I finally started SEEING the depth around 20:40
Bdubs dungeons is my favourite arc this season
This is why bdubs is the best builder in minecraft to ever exist!
make all tiers of the clues essentially meaningless, t1-3 all provide a cryptic clue, then offer interpretation services for an additional fee.
goregeouss
You’re a whole movie and a half ❤️
"Don't be like this guy, be like me" Bdubs has mastered comedy
I can't say anything but... WOW! Just WoW!
Anyone know the mod or plug-in  used to change perspective like bdubs does
i have extra loved your builds and the video content this season. i’d love a 45 minute episode sprinkled in with one of the upcoming videos!
I love how your ad was like "Don't be like me, be like me!" xD
It would be really cool to make some map art that could be given out to others that also find/complete the challenges. So the first gets the crown but others still have an incentive to go complete it too.
Man Bdubs building is always next level!
It would be so cool if lego made a hermitcraft series of sets and we could collect lego versions of the hermits. Anyway....
Holy smokes man...what a build. Its beautiful.
Wow Bdubs, really truly, I bow to the king
More cheapskate clues: Go left, probably. Near some trees. Look for gray. I'm currently on break; come back later.
BDubs has seriously surprised the hell out of me when he changed it to white world. I was not expecting this at all.
Truly an artist! Gorgeous build
Great work Bdubs! Looks like the Treasury of Petra, Jordan.
20:00 Wow! I'm really impressed by the illusion of depth. That's such an awesome build.
It looks like the build gradually juts out more and more as it goes up, like there are new small incremental outward changes to the pillars, when in reality the pillars are completely flat. Bdubs is brilliant, the most talented builder I can think of with texturing, and what a gourge build too! Also, just to add on a bit, it reminds me of the entrance to the mines of Moria, I bet Impulse is wishing he was you right now!
yup..Bdubs is the best builder i've seen.
Yo Bdubs you have some talent
Of all the amazing things I've seen everyone do in Minecraft, the texturing and gradients done on this have to be hands down my absolute favorite.  I honestly didn't even think something like that was possible.    I have no words beyond amazing, but even saying that doesn't do justice to how impressed I was with that.
Dear Lord!  Your Gothic builds are absolutely incredible!!
your parcour is really awesome
What a fantastic idea for this season... Super creative and beautiful as always.
Texture Shading king Bdubs!!, dont you worry about over texturing it, it adds to the aesthetic. cant wait too see what the TSK does with the interior
That gate is absolutely incredible! Very nice work! You should try to get Mumbo involved, he's just come back and I think his mind would be absolutely blown by what you've done.
😶😳😲
so much effort went into this video!!! can’t wait until the dungeon is finished!!! take care bubbles!!
Voice of an angel
Textures are to op, you need to get nerfed
Those textures are just insane
You've outdone yourself again with the new texturing method. Would love to get a whole Building with BDubs episode exclusively on how to get various effects from this.
Strange men clothed in moss suits distributing crowns is no basis for a system of government!
Wow love that new building technique!
BDubs, that new gate is beautiful!!!
23:43 uhhhhh..... yeah........ ur storage...... huh..... not even gonna say anythn
This is amazing, can't wrap my head around the build being nearly just textures!!!!!
That dungeon is epic!!! It's insane!
This is pure magic. And you are the magician  🎩
I think one change to the clues is to switch from paper to honeycomb. It will sell the idea that the tree is bestowing sap of knowledge
That texturing is honestly insane, been playing Minecraft for almost 10 years and I’ve never seen anything like that.
Wow, beautiful build!
Love what you’re doing this season Bdubs!
what is the toggle perspective mod Bdouble100 uses?
This is insane it looks like a panting!
LMAO At "Alright have to go to my storagesystem here" hahahaha just great humor
Bdubs is flexing his build muscles so hard and I'm loving ever second of it
Wow I aspire to be this good! I can paint but transferring my creativity over is hard sometimes. This is beautiful bdubs♡
Is Budbs a magician? I mean that was literally AMAZING!!!!
I thought Iskall's base would be like this
hmmm maybe have a "door lock" on your puzzle places so the hermits have to have the 'clue key' in order to challenge it? that way you for sure get some diamonds?
Mind was blown when you showed the white vs colored. Your use of colors to add depth is insane.
Gray-dients :)
Castle fit for a giant
My dude!! Absolutely amazing! The depth on that build was phenomenal! Truly flawless.
Bdubs whattt
For Tree of Whimsy shop... avoid it blending in much. And put up signs with arrows!  The hermits probably won’t spend a lot of time on screen figuring it out, and shopping for something fun sounds like a streaming/ recording vid thing. For instance I even saw a vid of a hermit ascending to Iskall’s Elytra shop and not circling the sale platform before jumping off. Because of that only thought Iskall was selling one pair of wings instead of up to 4!
Perhaps you can set up a well near the Tree of Whimsy for Hermits to make their offering?  The Oracle's Well or some other lore...
That texture is insane
That gate looks phenomenal BDubs. Way to go! Its fun hearing how excited you are too. Great vid. Now excuse me, I got to spoil to all the hermits new build is in a desert!
What a brilliant use of white world! The gate looks AMAZING!!!!
Absolutely amazing building skills
After you showed the difference with and without textures I sat there with my mouth agape for a min
Mr B-dubble O, this is amazing.
Bdubs: is in savanna  Also Bdubs:  " *Sahara* "
Should have torn the outpost down it's gonna be easy to find now
Outta the park with that doorway. 🏆👍
Every time you build something I'm shocked. I don't know why it still shocks me. I should be used to being amazed by your builds. Amazing job Bdubs!
I’m convinced this guy would make an amazing Adventure Map
wow.. thats beautiful brother well done
this texturing is actually nuts, kinda had my mind blown
Wait....what? Most of the gate surface was flat??! Oh. My..... . Absolute texturing magic.  Bravo BDubs. That is beautiful!
Bdubs... I don't even think you can call what you do mere building anymore, it's art, truly. It's like you built a massive structure shaped canvas, then did a pixel art of the building on top of it. Hands down the most beautiful build I've seen in this game, mad props to you good sir
*Mind Blown
The texturing on this new build is incredible! It's amazing how much depth you've created using just different coloured blocks
Can't believe Bdubs is the Moss Pope
I think BDubs has been playing some elden ring. First the amazing tree/under tree and now then beautiful mountain gate.
that gate is SO GORGEOUS!! the illusions are so strong! masterful!
My jaw dropped after he zoomed out the build. Amazing!
Genuinely impressive how good that turned out. That door looks like something straight out of Elden ring
Absolutely amazing what you are doing this season bdubs
Parkour master, perfect redstone, total package
Bdubs this is my favorite of all time Minecraft build ever
This is one of the coolest things i've seen built in vanilla MC  It looks like it's came straight out of a FROMSOFT game  AMAZING🔥
That may be the most satisfying to look at build I've ever seen
Bdubs ad reads>
0:05 reminded me of the attack of the b-team episode where bdubs built his archemdes airship
B-Dubs: "Headed over to *my* storage real quick cause I need to get something" Also B-Dubs: Goes into Tango's house XD Your build is absolutely gorgeous as always B-Dubs, what you create is pure art. Much love <3
You should have a Master Class on Minecraft Building. I would pay good money to have you teach building for hours and be able to build with you. :-D
It looks amazing!! I loved hearing you talk about the texture and then showing you what you built with it!! The bars on the door really look like they protrude out!!
Its surprising how much texturing could do to your build
Probably one of the best builds to date
This is such a gorgeous build! I love it! Reminds me of something from Elden Ring :0
Dude, that build is awesome, the use of light aand dark to give the illusion of depth is awesome. Plus the darker aesthetic you are goin with this season is right up my alley. It reminds me of Elden Ring. Great job.
27:04
got to fucking love a little trompe l'oeil in a simulated 3d world on a 2d screen.
Bdubs! You could have loadstone to chests that have a map of the area it's at like the maps in shipwrecks
The adventures of Bdubs and the amazing 3d canvas
WTAF. only BDubs could build something as monumental as that gate and it just casually be for a little treasure hunt. Gobsmacked.
The Gateway is beyond amazing! What a way to trick the eye! Love it 🥰
Bdubs is a genuine artist
Another bopping BDubs episode
It's far, with dry green, it's also a hill, it has different gradients of gray, there is a pillager outpost nearby, the coordinates are positive x and negative z, where could that mighty gate be?  he gave a bit too much clues with one video...
I don't know if the scale is really big or if Bdubs is just short
Damn dude first that giant basement now this huge gate...  Etho is really pushing himself with those off camera buids. Mad respects for him what a goat.
btw, people can approximate the distance by # of rockets used ;)
Hey Bdubs,  Great work on the build! Maybe it’d be cool if every collectible from the dungeons represents some sort of power (think the rings of power from lord of the rings) which would eventually be required to be collected by one person to defeat the ancient evil (definitely not played by a certain Bdouble0 wink wink) of the white tower. The collectibles could even be combined by a mysterious blacksmith (also definitely not you) far away as part of an epic quest.  Keep up the great work!
Your a madman
That Castle almost as textured as that beautiful voice.
i can't imagine how many hours and hours this episode took to put together.. wow. fantastic job bdubs
How big is that 😳😱😮
I you don't build the entrance to decked out 2.0 I will cry! this build is insane!!!!
Holy swear-word  I'm in awe
Fantastic
Its ya boy bdubs here with another genius building tech!!!
1000th comment for the ol bdubz 😌😌
Dude, I was absolutely blown away, seeing that thumbnail!  Absolute incredible work!
Cool storage system
This build is so beautiful!  Amazing work BDubs
Oh my. Well done! Brovo!
Hot DANG, Bdubs, this is absolutely STUNNING! I'm low-key kind of obsessed with your build style! So resourceful, and your eye for color is second to none.
Why isn’t it called the “Tree of Wisdom” or the “Tree of Secrets” because it gives clues to the location of the new adventure quest?
Omg . It's really impressive 👏
B double O... Boo? AAAAAH-
Bdubs really never ceases to amaze me with how good of a builder he is
What an excellent demonstration on texturing! I'm hyped to watch the hermits get clues and go on the hunt for dungeons! 💕
This is, this is just amazing. The gradients really do work, and it's so great. So in awe
So beautiful! This way of using textures is like mixing pixel art with a simple 3D model. I don’t think I’ve seen this technique before in minecraft but now I can’t wait to experiment with it.
Bdubs doing what the wandering trader should've been
Petition for BDubs's silky vocal chords to open every episode!
What an amazing concept to literally paint in minecraft using blocks!  Why has this not been a thing already - trust Bdubs to show us how it's really done!  Amazing!
I’d love to see more tutorials of your building genius in hermit craft! Your texturing skills are unmatched! 💖😭
Pillaged outpost by gate, location located in 3...2...
Top tier outtro music!
Wow! You are painting with blocks now. That gate is phenomenal—I’m so glad you showed it off in white to compare. The towers were my favorite because they really looked like sections!
Love, love, love and love your mountain base!!!
i just recently got back into mc and watching vids of it, how... does this man causally build these things...
This is absolutely stunning! And inspiring for a newbie player like myself. I can't wait to see where you take this new build next!
Instead of near or far for more diamonds you could give an exact number of blocks from the tree of whimsy using the distance formula. That would then give whoever purchased the clue like a ring in which the location could be. Edit: you could also give like numbers or angles that if the hermit uses math they could find the cords.
Seriously i absolutely can't get enough of you and your builds!! Amazing work holy smokes!
I was just wondering, do you have an updated version of your old resource pack? That was the most beautiful thing to happen to Minecraft and I was so sad when it stopped working 😭
I swear, nobody can match your style and quality. I can't go 1 episode without watching all the way to the end!
the gatebuilding looks gorgeous! Texture an gradients are amazing!
A major award??
Looks like the mines of moria but with a grander entrance, than you know a glowing blue door
Bdubs is like the Bob Ross of Minecraft building. So instructive and always looks so boss at the end. LOVE the gate and hope to one day be as good a builder.
*sees thumbnail* bloody helll BDubs
Bdubs you should make that your base and pay Mumbo too make you a door. The gate is too beautiful to leave as just a one time thing.
Bdubs is insane at building 🤯
It seems that Bdubs played a lot of Elden Ring recently. All his builds this season remind me of the architecture in the Elden Ring world
This isn’t related to Bdubs or this video at all but oh my god if I could never watch another Amazon fresh grocery store ad ever again I would be happy with that.
Nice gradient approach. I always thoygh that the degradé dark on botttom light on top was not realistic as well.  I am enthusiastic of reinforced concrete dirtness... i see the same style in your build. Nice.
My jaw dropped when I saw the thumbnail this is crazy good. It’s like Petra it’s so cool.
Correct me if I'm wrong but you can bypass the whole minecart part of the parkour thing by just hopping up and opening the trapdoor. By landing on the edge of the open trapdoor you'd only have to jump up one block to the obsidian.
That build is gorgeous Bdubs!
First, that entrance is incredible. Just amazing.  Second, don't worry. We won't say anything about looking for savannah mountains area with an outpost next to a birch forest biome.
bdubs knew what he was doing with the crown texture..indeed
I do really like the texturing and trickery of making a flat wall look like a 3d structure.  But won't the textures only work when you're on the ground looking up?  Or does it look ok from the air as well?
Love your ad breaks
after just finishing elden ring I love the very souls inspired build style makes me super hype for every episode
My jaw just dropped. Absolutely stunning gateway!
I was hoping the entrance to Impulses Base would be this big that would have eben perfect
I was hoping the entrance to Impulses Base would be this big that would have eben perfect
I love how bdubs uses minecraft blocks as if they were charcoal it looks so freakin amazing!
BDubs can sing really good. How did I not know?
The Big Gate is absolutely stunning! It made me realize I have so much to learn about building in Minecraft
I think the size scale for bdubs is big,  mega and bdubs mega big
Most talented builder and content creator.
I can´t wrap my head around the fact that that is a flat wall!!! Those are some serious building skills!
Bruh....that building/gate is the coolest thing I ever seen! I dunno how people build so perfect in minecraft. Awesome as always bdubs!
"whoops"
I think the clue far is a little to vague, Maybe give a max distance, for example it could say: far(less than 10k blocks away) Orone that says: not south
Wow.
0:01 I felt like I was watching yogscast Episode in the golden days :D of minecraft.
this man made a normal map in Minecraft
Amazing gate
Sahara? I think you mean savanna xD
Please build a Elden Ring inspired scale world
xD very high pricing! youre the best. i wonder what magic you will accomplish once u have more experience with the texturing, and maybe combine it in interessting ways with actual depth
Loving this
Bdubs = a true inspiration for all the builders in that game, myself included :-)
Seeing the giant gate was a shock, then realising that there was no shadows but the gradients made me fall out my chair
That texturing is really really good! Now, question: How do you make the texture for a carved punkin, without the block itself changing.  I saw the eggs was carved pumpkins but when you placed them, they returned to their original texture
I cannot even with this bdubs! You are entirely too modest! This build is incredible!! That thumbnail though 😉
This use of shading is amazing
This new dungeon reminds me of the “Black Church” (Biserica Neagră) in Brașov, România, which is (in many places) stained black from soot from when the Ottomans tried to burn it down in the 1600s.
So Bdub's dungeons are pay to win, its the best plan i've ever heard.
Youre right! there are no flowers in the Sahara desert but also the savannah
What type of trail now?💀💀 felt like i was watching OOG
I don’t know if we were supposed to know this but I feel like Bdubs was the one who made the basement and the Tree of Whimsy.🤨
He has done it again😄
Too much texture??? Are you kidding me??? Holy Crap Bdubs, you absolutely nailed the texturing on this build. It. Is. Gorgeous!!!!
"Oh yea what a perfect redstone contraption... someone else made..." lmao
always happy to hear your lovely voice :)
Breadcum
Feels like D&D / Elden Ring-scale awe. Great work Bdubs!
The amount of "next levelness" you put into your builds is absolutely mind blowing. Pure genius 👏
- + , X coordinate minus range and the Y coordinate plus range.
This man successfully duped me into thinking a flat wall had 3d features. Oh my goodness.
Bdubs that gate is an apsalute master piece youre not painting in minecraft. truely beautiful
Oh my golly, this is what I need for my dwarven realms in my own little world.
Listening to the way your brain processes is crazy. I loved hearing it!
Dare you to try & convince Mumbo to redstone that door....
Soooo I wasn’t being a genius by using the bed??? Was I not supposed to break it?
11 years and you're still innovating for builders. That gate looks incredible.
You honestly remain one of my favorite Minecraft youtubers years after I found you, and if it weren't for you I never would've found Hermitcraft
White Tree of Gondor and now the Doors of Durin dude chill XD
i love the verticality in your designs
Well I can safely say that the thumbnail doesn't do your build justice! The gate was impressive, then you zoomed out again and made my jaw drop! AND THEN you switched to the white world and back, and my mind was blown! Let no-one say that you don't know your stuff Bdubs, that was amazing!
HEAIYOOYOYOYY bdubs!  how long will the deal with expressvpn last? :)  Thank you for your content. It's the most entertaining Minecaft themed Channel im watching right now <3
I love your cloak, gonna add one to my skin, your a trendsetter bdubs
every new bdubs video is a joyous event. im literally jumping back and forth in my chair smiling
Bdubs Your a MADMAN for building! Lets hope it takes a whole for the hermits to find it the gradient And texture is AWSOME
Bdubs has a few screws loose…
I can only imagine the person who designed deep slate is loving this given all the hate for deep slate. Best block imo I love it but others feel indifferent about it
HOW!! just how!!can someone be so good at buiding you bdubs are the best definition of inspiration for me,just love your builds
Don't be deceived by this man with shades of grey. He approaches with such carefree and whimsical attitudes and then astonishes with a serious and grave present. It is just an illusion. He's been talking about his life, opinion and family as an ordinal man while going incognito with VPN. It is totally a fake.  He is actually a genuine artist.
Perfect redstone that someone else built… ANYWAYS
I suggest key system that is required to open a gate, keys could be found in little special locations around the world (you could sell clues to them) also they could be bought but for very steep price. Also dungeon is such great idea every now and then you can add additional rooms and corridors to explore. Cant wait to see what beauty you will create
perfect.
that door looks awesome
I want dungeons like this to spawn in Minecraft
What BDubs is doing this season feels truly revolutionary, and a perfect match of idea and skill. The mini stories that are created by each of these adventures. Can't wait to see how each future one will unfold and how the Hermits will react to them and anticipate them as the season continues.
"In a Sahara" of course, not a savanna, but one of many places named Sahara
I love the way your thumbnails look this season they're really really pretty
Looks great!!
"Heading over to my storage system real quick" *Goes straight into Tango's house to take his blackstone* I can't 😂😂
chef's kiss, mister DoubleO, for that texture !!
I was so confused by the thumbnail cuz I thought the gate was leaning forward. That gradient is genius!!
Knowing that it is in a savannah (and not Sahara) and there is a pillager outpost nearby, I have a feeling people will find the exact spot very easily.
I have never seen such genius texturing on a build! Absolutely FLAWLESS! You keep surprising us with new and better builds everytime
You're a master of your craft,  minecraft rather 🙃
holy cow bdubs this is one of the coolest things i ever seen!!!
22:56 Sahara? From season 6?
I am amazed by the use of textures!
I genuinely enjoyed seeing collabs other hermits did with you, but never felt committed to watching and subscribing to you. This episode... this build... Anyone not subscribed to Bdubs needs to do it RIGHT NOW. He is one of a kind
It was very impressive when you showed off the all-white texture pack showing the true depth... Very Cool technique to hype up your build even more! NGL in the past you havent been one of my favorite hermits, but this season i find myself watching your vids more and more.
:O :O :O :O :O :O OK mind blown
So BDubs I love the unintentional pun you made in this video. Grey and gradients, = greydients.
It's also near a pillager outpost.
its savanna not Sahara, sorry im just picky with these things
You are incredible
The technique you have used for that build is a lot like the artistic technique trompe-l’oeil it’s an interesting optical illusion of painting designs and depth ect onto a plain surface. It’s clever and effective.
Oh wow those towers look amazing. It's hard to believe they are actually flat. That's absolutely incredible. I've never seen anything like that in minecraft
Usually hermits just dont finish the back of thier builds. Bdubs really took it to the next level. 21:10 He just did the front. <3
So ist the earth just flat with a lot of gradient textures?
Great thumbnails lately compared to last season :)
You are THE builder bdubs awesome work
Boy you're inSANE! Have you ever considered painting? You are really an artist, sir.
I'm late to the party and new to the channel. You're so amazing and creative. Your brain is beautiful bdubs. Also, that silly concrete powder pronunciation caught me so off guard. Got me so good. Lol
That is an absolutely gorgeous build, mind-blowing
OMFG, texture on another level, can't believe my eyes....
That build is insane! You sir are a master at texture
I hope he built the pillager outpost to throw people off. :)
Well Big Hint where this is near a Savanna Outpost.
You could 100% be an art teacher or architecture teacher when you are older. I don't know if you do anything else outside of youtube but architevture or interior design would be way up your alley:))) Lil project here and there - very similar to what you do in ur builds.
You know, you could do a redstone counter, and have different results depending on how many diamonds they're "giving the tree" for clues?
Ah another good example of "I did some work of camera"
You can just sell keys instead of clues
Can you bring back Red to be your "cameraman"?
Bubbles is the best!
Oh. My. Goodness. Bdubs I LOVE that build! You have built so many incredible structures over the years I've watched you, but this is on another level! Can't wait to see what you do with your megabase! ❤️
Just wanna give praise to how amazing that build was, I was a bit skeptical at first with how you explained the whole making shadows using gradients. But you weren't lying when you said seeing it in action helps with understanding it! WOWEE that looked great
You seem to be an extradimensional spirit taking over bdubds
it's in a savanna and there's a pillager out post right next to it...
BDoubs, The level of entertainment of you episodes is over the roof. I absolutely love everything you produce in HC server, the build, the entertainment and creativity. Love yaaaa
Isnt this episode 10
Oh my, that build is stunning!
Honestly, sometimes I think Minecraft is just a canvas to Bdubs
I am just absolutely blown away, Bdub's is the best builder ever
Does b-dubs really think savannas are called saharas?
I absolutely love these different camera angles and narrative style videos. bdubs you're doing an awesome job
I'm shocked at how amazing that small trick does for the build its amazing, bdubs is Def one of best builders of all times  It looks like it has so much depth
BDUBS YOU BEAUTY ! THE BUILDS AND THE TEXTURING ARE JUST GODLY
That texture lesson on that keep is a masterclass, Bdubs. I’m inspired.
I really lost for words when I saw that gate...
INSANE BDUBS YES SMART BUILDING LOVE IT
BDubs at peak game this season
Bdubs deserves every sponsor he gets. Legit fun commercials. Advertisers definitely get more than they pay for.
Bdubs: I'm not gonna reveal any details on the new location Also Bdubs: Shows 3 different recognizable biomes and a pillager outpost xD
Bdubs should put Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing on the crown. He’s the victor so long as he doesn’t die… if Tango dies, the Crown becomes available to the next one to recover the banners.
loadstones spawn in bastians
Man your my favorite hermit this season so entertaining Bdubs
That is some impressive use of visual depth. swapping back and forth to white-scale makes the "building" part look do-able, but all those different block placements.
There is no doubt for me that Bdubs is the BEST hermitcraft (maybe all of Minecraft) builder. His builds are always another level of creativity and the others sometimes ask him to build for them.😂
Jedi Master Builder BdoubleO100
that's like straight out of a dark souls game
Wow that build was actually incredible 👏👏👏
Wow it's amazing !
i love what you are doing for the hermits and for us the viewers keep up the great work x
I love your imagination. Very nice build =)
This gates are incredible, fantastic art of colors. :)
Probably should have hidden the pillager tower, somebody's going to find it in the seed
I already considered myself a good builder, but i still keep learning new stuff from bdubz's videos. Amazing video :D!!!!
The macro texturing on the gate is so ingenious, it’s such a great and new way to add depth to a flat wall.
middle earth be like
need a payment before entering the dungeon.
You'll need to have a couple of small dungeons as well- little things with just like, a trap or two that you can dot around.  And also, if you're concerned about people finding your dungeons without clues, you should hide the entrances more.  Put the entrance down within a cave, or have it be a hollow tree in a forest or something, that then grows out and branches down into a fully dungeon underneath.
That's  just absolutely amazing.
niceeeee
I've seen perspective art in person and this is a remarkable job expressing that in Minecraft.
The build is absolutely amazing!! It looks gorgeous. I can’t believe it’s just flat surfaces.
If you happened to count, how many hours went in to building that front entrance (planning, excavating, and building if you have that breakdown)? I've been practicing on a much smaller scale with some of the skills I've picked up from your videos, but would love a realistic expectation of what investment of time is needed for such madness as this.
A bread WHAT trail? 😳
Elden ring inspired?
Every builder: takes out blocks to "give it some depth". Bdubs: Hold my flat wall.
That build and the use of gradients is breathtaking. You're a master builder, good sir!
I said it on Tango's most recent video, and I'll say it here. I have watched Hermitcraft from the beginning, yes even way back when your brother was on the server. Tango's stream of doing this parkour while Hermits were joining for the sole purpose of helping/heckling him is the single greatest piece of Hermitcraft related content I have ever seen. Thank you for putting together that amazing experience, and I can't wait to see more of them!
BDUBS! You inspire me! I've learned so much from your videos. You're my favourite builder. Keep doing your thing, please.
You know BDubs, I have thought about doing this builder of secrets idea that you've picked up this season myself on an smp since I thought that it would be incredibly difficult for someone making content to do it since they have almost nothing to show the viewers without spoiling the secret, so I was happily surprised to see you pick it up! I wanted to do an egyptian themed mystery with pyramids, sphinxes, traps, puzzles and mummies, so I'm excited to see how you take the approach that you're taking on this! It is so much more fun to explore the world if you could all of a sudden stumble upon something you've never seen before that someone left behind for you to discover! :D
So so so so so good
Bdubs incredible as usual!! Keep it coming
Hey Bdubs, one way you could make money from your challenges could be to charge an admission fee. You could also hide coupons in chests and barrels for your future shops. Thx for the great content as always
You are really a good artist it is amazing
Love that bdubs is adding adventures back into the game for end-game level players. Something vanilla lacks imo
you should definitely put a tip jar near the Tree
Please tell me that the clue shop will be named: "Get a Clue"
this is amazing sutch tallent
Your building skills never cease to amaze me! Great work on that texture!
bdubs building skills have started to give me unrealistic expectations for my own building time in minecraft 😭
You are insane bdubs
Curious why Bdubs doesn’t do something like selling “dungeon passes” that allows members to actually adventure in his dungeons in order to earn the rewards. Also, since the parkour puzzle has the rule of “no elytra,” bdubs could make “dungeon gear” that adventurers are allowed to wear for his dungeons. The better the gear, the more expensive it is. Potions and buckets of milk could also be sold as items they can use in the dungeons. Basically, anything not specifically bought from bdubs is allowed to be used in the dungeons.
that thing looks amazing
Absolutely insane. The cut-away to the white world to show how little actual block depth there was blew my god damn mind - Tango may be the Parkour King, but you are the Gradient King.
The work you do with gradients is absolutely stunning bdubs!
Bdubs you are a true innovator
B-Dubs, you continue to amaze us. Every episode I think this is peak B-Dubs and then you top it! (No pressure though, chill episodes with BdoubleO are just as good)
I melt every time Bdubs says “I love you to death!”
Bdubs should hire mumbo to make the gate into a piston door when he comes back
Truly one of the craziest Bdubs builds in just one episode. I can't wait to see the interior!  Suggestion: Maybe hang banners from the branches of the tree of whimsy? The red will pop quite nicely I think on the white branches and green leaves.
Probably one of the best builds I've ever seen
you are some kind of building genius, that’s one of the coolest things i have ever seen in minecraft and it’s absolutely beautiful
Bdubs you are an ARTIST! You take building to the next level <3
Elden Rind is calling. They want their massive dungeon gate back.
Bdubs, you're really a frickin' genius!
That Design... I´m gonna steal it
What’s your types? Him: flat!
This is an absolute master class. Im in awe bdubs.
23:40 lmao "Headed over to my storage system real quick, because..." *Enters Tango's base*
This is absolutely beautiful. I love how you even created a simple design within the stone of the gate
26:15 slint reference
It was me!  I was the turkey all along!!!
You and Impulse are going to have a debate about who’s the real King Under the Mountain 😂
THIS BUILD IS HUGE!!! beautiful detail
“don’t be like me, be like ME”
How is BDubs so good at figuring out these amazing tricks like this texturing one? I have much to learn from Sensei BDubs.
It's beautiful
wow bdubs you should just sell that entrance to impulse for his dwarven city entrance i like yours alot better for the dwarven thingy
1:15 *cheerily* "...and because I don't hate myself, I'm gonna cheat!" oh Bdubs, <3
Such an inspiring builder, u and doc r my fave
this guy's building skills are lowering my self esteem ahahah
AMAZING!  You are an inspiring artist.  Thank you!
Extraordinary scale. Unfathomable detail. A legendary tale. Bdubs has prevailed.
Because I dont hate myself, I'm gonna cheat 😃 -Bdubs 2022
Omg this just looks amazing
The gradient stuff you're trying out reminds me of bump mapping in 3D modeling. There's no extra polygons being added, it's just a texture telling the lighting system where bumps and shadows should be without actually adding that much detail.
Sir. _Sir._ It's only been 5 episodes.
I haven’t watched your videos before, randomly chose to watch this one cause the gate looked cool. Your understanding of textures and explanations just earned u a sub, that was incredible!
Oh my gosh Bdubs, you've definitely outdone yourself. This video was incredible! It's so helpful and entertaining and I hope you keep at it. Good job Bdubs :D
That gate is amazing. BDubs is an artist putting paint to canvas, but it’s blocks in a Minecraft world. I’m totally floored. Absolutely beautiful.
Wow!! Please make your mega base in this style. It’s beautiful
Best builder 💯
I Loved the idea of your dungeons right when I heard and I love it only more after seeing these completed dungeons ❤️
It looks incredible! BRAVO!!
These builds this mans does is mindblowing!
Not my 4 years old absolutely wetting himself laughing at how you pronounced "concrete powder" 😂
please no one spoil this for the guys and gals
That door was ridiculous! Genuinely one of the coolest builds I've ever seen. Well, besides the mysterious perfect guerilla redstone builder that made your basement. Unfortunately, I don't know if you'll ever be able to match that but it's a close second!
That is an amazing build. You are an artist bdubs. Keep up the great work!
did he just build the Vatican in 1 episode?!?
Get this man a beacon!
That door is… wow. Bdubs, I’m speechless. That is bad ass, I hope one day all of us can rival your building skill
Please, keep on going with that Elden Ring style, it looks breathtaking!
Stunning gate man, you're a true artist! I love it
Bdubs hiding as a bush was so so funny on Tango's perspective jfhfhdjd I love our little moss boy  I'm so so loving the dungeons. What an incredible build!! I've been playing with gradients in Minecraft thanks to your builds in the past two seasons :)  18:15 🤣🤣🤣  the clues are so good ahahahaha
If there's a god-tier in Minecwaft, bdubs has moved in permanently.   ❤
Amazing!! Can't wait to see the outcome!
if it's green, it'd be erebor from the hobbit
Holy carp B-Dubs has some *pipes*.  Was not expecting Sinatra right off the bat.  Also you really outdid yourself on the massive gate
That texturing is so amazing!!! I was really staring at my screen to double check that the towers were really flat. I just didn't believe it.
Are you kidding me… that looks phenomenal. ❤️ Can you stop being so good at Minecraft Bdubs.
Poor bdubs he gave the location away
Absolutely fantastic 👍
Bdubs been playin to much elden ring
The build is one of the best I've ever seen. It's so good
When you switched to the white world it blew my mind. You are a magician wrapped in the mind of a Genius!
Has anyone heard anything about or from generikB ?? I miss him so much and i miss the B-team so damn much bdubs have you heard from genie ?
This is amazing! This is the best build of the season so far!
What about combining depth with fake shadows and highlights?
That is amazing to look at. Really, really cool build.
Bdubs is my favorite internet service provider
painting in minecraft
bdubs I have a suggestion : build a structure under the tree of Whimsy  that you can sell the clues in
I get how you made the texturing on that gorgeous mountain build.... but how does one do that??
So, we have access to the seed via expoused bedrock pattern in the nether ceiling, in  Docs video. After searching for a while and knowing where the world border is, i found out that there are only 4 places that could match the biome distribution and only 2 with the correct topography in sight. Using the rising sun as a reference,  i was sble pinpoint the right location! But i aint no snitch, so i wont tell anyone =)
Arguably the best gradient I’ve seen someone build
Whoa, that’s beautiful!
I love bdubs “new” storage system
Why am I smiling during the whole episode? Is it just me ??  Thx bdubs for the quality of content
bdubs is this racketeering? hmmmm
I have never been that into building but this ep really got me interested!! Wow! I paint irl so your texturing is really exiting to me
God deeeemn that gateway is the best 😩😩
I looooove the mountain build!
you just made the whole server look bad at building
Liked immediately just for that amazing singing intro. Well done!
You’re still such a fun guy to watch after all this time. I’ve been rewatching some of the old OOG and OOGE and was really reminiscing about the good old Minecraft days. I’ve no idea of the dynamic but I’d love to see you two get back together and do an adventure map or something. Still my favorite Minecraft content
Bdubs your voice and energy just make my day 😊😊
I'm so amazed at the gradient shading. It's so impressive and inspiring to follow your development and I especially enjoy the whole concept behind this season. It's so exciting and magical I just love everything about it. Thank you so much for your time and work bdubs! ❤️
Netherhite hunting stream?
You're a madman.
Don’t care what anyone argues. I don’t think there’s anyone else in MC who is a better builder than you!
That is AMAZING!!!!  Bdubs you outdone yourself!!!
Tango is now a Lord of Cinder.
Bdubs, I’ve decided your the best builder in Hermitcraft. You’re insane.
The texturing is amazing, but I wanna know how you did that with the game's coloring.
Just wanted to say thank you for making me smile today. We are loosing someone in our family.... we have been told he has hours to live so today kinda sucks. You and the hermits help me escape the emotions that are overwhelming me and help me calm down again. Thank you for that. I really appreciate your work.
i love the new castle in the mountain, it looks fantastic
And I love you to death, bdubs
that fucking thumbnail got my jaw dropping!
oh wow, what you did with the gradients really is amazing;  I dont think ive ever seen someone build using gradients like that
Bdubs is without a doubt one of the best builders on the server!
18:01 OHHH I absolutely LOVE the quilted-looking pattern on the gate made by the cobbled deepslate and the deepslate blocks, the two don't even look different when up close and I didn't even notice them at first, but the pattern magically appears when you zoom out- I love it!! It makes the gate look SO detailed, like it shouldn't be possible in vanilla Minecraft 😍😍 Bdubs you've done it again!!
Very smart way to make builds beautiful and also good work camera man.
Top tier season for bdubs. Such a dream world to have these secrets and lore just sprinkled out. Someone has been playing a lil too much Elden Ring
I love the art and color theory explanations to your builds. Thanks bunches.
oh sheeeet. That castle door look is magnificent
You've essentially built a normal map in Minecraft with blocks. Beautiful work.
Technically BDubz did the parkour first so he’s the parkour master of the server!!!
Lol, you did reveal wayyy too much info, took me under 30 min to get the coords and I've never tried before, but ofc I won't reveal them, that would ruin the fun and just be annoying ( I am absolutely 100% sure I found them, I loaded it in my client and went to the coords and found the pillager outpost and the unique lava and water formations on the side)
How did he do the cam when he showed the door?
It's in a hill area
Minecraft needs more warm greys. No, minecraft deserves more warm greys!
You sir... make me cry. Amazing build as always.
you have to enlist mumbo to make that door open
Bdubs your the best builder I've ever seen, we are not worthy "bows down"
Holy crap those textures look great
There's a big problem with the business strategy of these dungeons. While having hints for the location at your tree works, if you wanted to sell any hints for the puzzle itself, people would not want to fly all the way back to spawn just to buy a hint, they might buy some if they were right at the puzzle site though.
sell compass to loadstone that sells another compass and so on
It is really beautiful!
"impulseSV" I'm going to build dwarven architecture. "B-Dubs" hold my beer.
This channel is so good.
That texturing is so incredible.
Impulse - makes a nice Dwarfen city entrance  Bdoubs - Hold my beer
Best gate ever
It’s crazy how I feel like I’m actually learning painting techniques from Minecraft.
Omg 😱 I don’t know what to say! That looks amazing 🤩
"I might have played with it too much" lolol
need some vines might make it look at a little bit more natural
That thumbnail… this man is a Minecraft artist! EVERYONE on this dang server is an artist, author, engineer, or all three! Absolute masters at what they do and I’m loving every ticking second of it
There are Minecraft builders, and then there is B-Dubs.
Wow, that build was absolutely gorgeous!
Wow! Beautiful Bdubs!
Bdubs this looks like a entrance to a cave mega base. How do you grind that much in between two episodes?  I'm totally blown away!
Theres nothing quite like coming home after grocery shopping then editing your videos while watching the wonderful, Redstone Genius BDubs!!!
Bdubs is really showing us up with his building skills.
love that he's trying to hide the spot so much he even turned off clouds just so ppl cant find it
i genuinely love your ads, so great!
This build is absolutely stunning. Jaw dropping...
This episode actually ups my building skill by at least tenfold. Thank you Bdubs!
what a building genius!
"Don't be like this guy.  Be like me." - Bdubs on Bdubs
bdubs, was this inspired by jump king?
That gate looks amazing! I really thought there was a bit more 3D to it than there really was! Also the cloak looks great!
I'm speechless! It was amazing BDubs. Thank you!!!
Love your painterly approach to this build. It’s amazing how it looks close compared to far!
The reveal of the cheap clue being "far" killed me dead on the spot. I really hope they stay that useless so we can see how the hermits respond to such...insightful wisdom XD
Wow Bdubs. That looks amazing. So cool
Black button on birch log might be a nice blend! Loooooove that gate and textures <3
I think it would be super cool if you added some color gradients to your diorite tower
Impulse spent days designing a grand dwarven entrance for his mega base. Then bdubs just knocks it out of the park for a mini game. You are an animal bdubs! Great builds so far!
I feel like Elden Ring has inspired a lot BDubs builds this season.
You know, you should do a dungeon on the bottom of a well. I don't know why. You just should
This technique…. *picks up jaw*
Bdubs i am just going to go to my storage room real fast for blocks goes into Tango's base LOL
Make the dungeon your mega base because it looks INSANE!!! Or the future entrance to decked out.
When you think he can’t get any better
dude the texturing is so clever!!! and the gate is absolutely beautiful!!!!
Wow I am impressed !!
Wow bdubs i dont have words to describe how jealous im actualy am right now over your bulding skills. My buildings always look like crap. Love u and what nice content.
Haha I love these new camera angles! Seeing your face bobbing in front of the stationary camera cracked me up 😅 amazing build, as always, master. ❤️
that gate looks AMAZING!! I love how you made the false depth
omg that looks sick!
The crown matches Tango's skin so well! I love seeing the hermits doing more stuff for the comminity this season:)
I know it's been said hundreds of times in the comments, but this build is absolutely amazing! I can't wait to see what you do inside.
Bdubs texture and build skills has gone Godmode!!!
Gray concrete powder, gray wool, gray stone... playing with graydients. :)
B DUBS! MY DUDE I AM SO HAPPY I GOT UP AT 1 IN THE NIGHT TO REALISE YOU UPLOADED AND SAW THIS VIDEO AND MY GODD! GET HELP MAN, YOU CRAZY GOOD!!!!!! NEVER STOP DOING THIS
I love the texturing!! That gate was insane!! I’ll have to try it out in my own world
I always get so excited when B-Dubs posts !!
i was sure its your mega base
Absolutely amazing build as always. i do fear however that the hermits could just watch your video and get better clues XD plus they can see the paid clues for free!!! lol you may need to have them push the world borders back a bit give you more room to hide these things haha
What a wonderful parkour trials
14:01 Rrrrrapgod
Watched tango parkour stream that was great!
Craazy build man
You just keep outdoing yourself Bdubs! This is amazing.
im looking to build my first ever megabase in minecraft in a multiplayer server and your use of shading really inspires me!! using blocks as shading is soo cool and im def going to implement that. do you think youll ever do an adventure in a cave or on a snowcapped mountain?
Ur Build . The door . And all . It literally perfect mann . Soo much to be inspired of .
This build is insane…
Thank you BDubs! My day started off wonderfully. Homemade biscuits and gravy, and a beautiful BDubs build, with a few laughs along the way.  ❤️
You know how we know *you* made the basement? ....the redstone is Perfect™. 🤣
Spectacular build. Very impressive.
An absolute great journey of an episode, only one of many dungeons to come
amazing!
it's like an older game texturing technique, but because it's Minecraft it's just impresive
Watching tango do this for the first time was amazing. Absolutely great job! I can see you got inspired by watching elden ring, and I'm looking forward for more of this!
I love how you use art techniques in your builds
You are such an amazingly skilled builder Bdubs! A truly awesome build
THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE
Wow Bdubs!  You're such an inspiration, not just because of your builds, but your attitude to youtubing as a career.  Keep up the great work :D
BDubs these are amazing!! Great job with the parkour adventures
This is amazing bdubs i love it you've also showed me the Power of gradients 🔥
When I saw that thumbnail I was like damn that's cool
loved how I missed the notification for this video coming out because I was busy re-watching older Bdubs videos. <hades text> there is no escape. </hades text>
Wow, just wow, boo you are the God of textures. You are the best hermit ever. Ofcourse best after the legendary TFC
Only bdubs would create a mega base on a whim for a mini game puzzle
You know when there a small break between videos bdubs has gone and done somthing ridiculous haha love it though!
I mean it when i say the gradient idea to give depht to the building is revolutionary and mind-blowing. Forget sculpting complicated shapes into our buildings, gradient is the new thing from now on
you should get Mumbo to build a redstone door for the castle thing
the excitement when saying "tree of whimsy" makes me so happy xD
The hermits hold Scar in high regard (as they should) for his detailed builds, but I have to say that Bdubs is right there as well, with stuff like this.  The build is amazing.
Woooooaaaah! Bdubs! That build is so amazing looking!!! Goodness me!!!
Bdubs I love the different perspectives you use when recording. It dramatically improves the quality of the video and storytelling! It's awesome!
That door texture is OUT OF CONTROL good
Fantastic texturing! Gosh, that's so good. You're a wizard Bdubs.
How I wish Tangos Crown has Curse Of Binding
I feel like impulse should raid this when it’s done and claim back the dwarvish looking mountain and door
Genius
wow
"So don't be like this guy, be like me" Literally both of them are the the same person lol 13:21
It takes no more than this intro that deserves a like on the video.
I'm pretty sure bdubs built that illager outpost himself and casually let it hang in the background to throw us off the location of the gate :D
Man u r videos r geting really good
One cool dungeon could be completely underground, and people have to find the portal in the nether
“Tango Found The First One Without Buying A Hint”  Well…The Second One Is Only A Flipping Castle Gate. Surely Completely Incognito!
Man Legend at work 😶
In a Savanna next to a pillager outpost
Who needs 3D when you have shades - Bdubs
THIS IS AMAZING BDUBS WOW
This is the most amazing build I’ve ever seen on any Hermitcraft season. BDubbs, you just leveled up.
I love your builds so much bdubs! It's amazin that after all this years you're constantly getting better and better. Amazing work!
This deserve 10 million views
I must not have paid enough attention or I missed an episode, but I don't think I did I missed the basement building
Forgot how much I loved watching you play the Minecraft, Bdubs. Thanks as always for putting a smile on my face mayn!
I don't know if you have plans to make a mega base this season, but would be awesome if your big/mega base were actually a mega challenge to the hermits
BDubs adding Normal/ Bump maps in Vanilla minecraft!
Bdubs... that gate is one of the most amazing things I've seen one in Minecraft. Opens up a whole new world of building.
"Don't look for clues!"  Immediately shows us a savanna pillager outpost...
That gate really reminds me of the gate out of The Hobbit. Really impressive
Oh my gosh Bdubz, that gate is one of the most beautiful things I've seen in Minecraft.
It was really fun watching tango do it in live stream, the frustration and the excitement of what's next everything was epic
As soon as I saw the thumbnail I gasped, your building skills blow me away every time.  Also, I wouldn't worry about some people saying you built the gate in the sahara, as they'll look for it in desert biomes and not the savannah biome that it's actually in lol
Interesting, you essentially applied the CGI concept of bump mapping to Minecraft. You can also explore reflexion, refraction, and opacity.
You are an absolute master artist!!!! I'm dumbfounded on how you achive painting with mi ecraft blocks. Totally love your builds and your personality is so entertaining. Great job! Can't wait to see what you do Inside.
FLAT
Your gradient work is astonishing!! My god!
Bdubs’ texturing is really great, but the problem I have with that technique personally is that it’s just not impressive when you get close to it. It’s an illusion of depth.
I’m glad the moss is back! I’ve missed it this season!
Making another dungeon he said! Hahaha
Bdubs: “don’t look around, I won’t be able to sell clues” “don’t do it!” Also Bdubs: let me back up *real far* so y’all can get a better look at things.   Never change ❤️
I feel like the tree of whimsy should give more whimsical clues. Like riddles that don't make sense at first
Whoa
You should build one of the challanges inside of a cave that is, obviously, accessable by a natural entramce
Aww, I'm sad you skipped most of the egg finding in the video...
I am getting serious elden ring vibes from what bdubs is doing this season, and I'm loving it.
Somebody called you Monolith a Lightsaber staff.
All jokes and memes aside, in case y'all didn't already know, Bdubs is simply a MASTER at building. He constantly raises the bar of what building in minecraft should be. Anytime Bdubs goes in-depth on his process, it's always a treat.  Here's a little bit of a secret: if you want to look at minecraft in the same way Bdubs does, learn pixel art. Ever since he got back from his hiatus, I've noticed a lot of the techniques he employs is the same as how pixel artists paint their pieces. Oh yeah, pixel art is basically painting, but with a lot of limitations, and a heavy emphasis on color and shape. There's a LOT to unpack with pixel art. And it's amazing how bdubs is basically making 3D pixel art.
The texturing and the way it plays tricks in our minds to make the build look like it has so much depth... I'm obssessed
The pillars of creation background is awesome, adding some Sintra too... you truly are a man of exquisite taste.
Broooooo I thought ok ok ok then suddenly ohhh ohhh okkkkk ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😯😲😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
This is what i expected impulse's base to look like when he mentioned he's base was gonna be dwarvish.
Bdubs just built a mega base
WOW Bdubs you are so talented, AMAZING
I will never get tired of seeing the absolutely insane stuff you build!
Wow what a amazing build!
Not only is he a redstone genius, but he is also a business mastermind
Just left Scars video and he was also singing Shearnatra
The reverse gradient/shadow tech is actually mindblowing!
Hey Bdubs, if that door could open it would be so incredible! I’m sure it’s possible with a little work and maybe other hermits can help!
with that outpost u already give away the location
if you haven't already, you should look at some footage or screenshots of anor londo from dark souls, your giant gate reminded me of it.
So Bdubs the Dungeon Master, Impulse is a Dwarf, Scar is a Elf,  Welsknight is a Paladin and and ZombieCleo is a Gorgon. Now we just need a Mumbo to where his Hobbit skin. Then they can do a campaign in hermitcraft
im not gonna lie. When it comes to Gradients sir bdubs you are a freaking BEAST!!! A BEAST I SAY
😯At the end of all the challenges Bdoubs should gather all the winning hermits and do a hunger game type of deal
I loved this episode so much!
So amazing. Just gorgeous!!
That shading... utter witchcraft
Bdubs is the Bob Ross of Minecraft.
BDUBS you genius! Goodness it is STUNNING!
Your texturing made my jaw drop today Bdubs. Hope you're proud! Now I gotta find it on the floor...
Bdubs, you are always one step ahead of the game when it comes to building. That texturing is wild, and I love the concept of using blocks more as paint colors to texture the build as a whole. It's really adding an entire new dimension to building in Minecraft that hasn't been done before as far as I can tell. I mean you've been doing it for a while now, but this build is a whole new level.
I absolutely love the use of a gradient to make a flat surface look 3D. I couldn’t even tell that some areas were flat until I saw the gate with no textures. Good stuff, Bdubs!
is becoming more and more clear hermits have learned to use baratone
It will be amazing if there is clue in any of this dungeons for a very big treasure hunt. So you have to find the dungeons, to find clues, to find a big treasure !  And see all these beautiful buildings once again they have been find : )
B's texturing skill is just mind blowing....
as
as
BDubs really set the tone this season with the amazing builds! Keep doing your thing man you’re an inspiration☝️
d
zdsf
That door is like vr textures, close up everything is flat in vr
ngl i know how good of a builder bdubs is. but holy dubby the build today was extremely formidable. it puts his buildings on HC to a whole other level.
Man, I just cant understand how are u capable of doing sth like this, for me placing this mamy blocks at all would be a problem and u can do this + make those blocks create a beautiful build
This build is seriously unreal. I've never seen anything like it in a vanilla server before. Bravo!
"This is my tunnel." LMAO
Didn’t know bdubs was a quitter. Gennyb would have found them all easily :)
This build is insane 😍
"far" lmao
I need a "hermits first reaction" video to this once the others see it.
Will you sell these after the challenges are completed to hermits who will ask for them?
looked like a dark souls structure. Amazing
bdubs safely browsing looks cozy
Hey buddy. I haven't seen one of you videos for probably a few years now. It's great to see how well the channel is going. Keep up the great content. Hope the family is safe and well
bdubs I am absolutely blown away by what you've done this season and this might be the best thing you've built so far. can't wait for the interior. You said in Building with Bdubs that you've been inspired by the world design in Elden ring recently and I can totally see the influence.  I'd also recommend that you check out Darksiders 2. the dungeon design in that game is great not just visually but the puzzles and how you interact with the dungeons is super creative. I think you'd like it
Wait that dungeon is actually crazy
Bdubs is the only one who could make a flat build look that amazing lol
UX writer here: “Are they in the right order? Who knows?” is a great way to make your users go “these are troll hints, I’m not going to give BDubs even one more diamond.” Remember, rage quitting is content, and it’s not content that gives you profit. Be actually informative—make your plus and minus clue the lowest tier and guarantee they’re in the right order. Next tier up, give them a “within a thousand block radius of this spot.” Then the top tier can be the compass without the other Hermits feeling ripped off. I want them to actually discover your beautiful gradient shadow castle.
Learnt sth new. Mind blown! Take a bow Sir!
BDubs that sounded good. My favorite version of the song is written by James Darren
holy moly, that gate is magnificent. looks fit to guard the entrance to Moria...
At first, I thought season 9 will be kinda lame because bdubs won't really gave a traditional base and etho wouldn't be around till much later but i came to realize that the entire server is Bdubs' playground and i love that
Making a Moss robe this season is perfect for the parkour dungeons and the Tree of whimsy.  More “eye spy” mossy Bdubs please 👀
What a masterpiece!!! You are amazing!
This is so beautiful bdubs! making good use of gradient to show depths, specially in Minecraft, using blocks as color palette is not an easy thing to do. I've always been fascinated by how you use techniques that are commonly found in paintings and apply it in minecraft, the amount dedication and passion that went into this is more than I can imagine.
YESS the textures!!! I love your work Bdubs :D Thank you as always for the episode
Im currently having a really hard time and your vids allways makes me happy Thank you 🤍
What wizardry is this!! 😂
Bdubs is a genius. That texture work is just insane.
3:30 “oh yeaAA *screams in agony* “ made me crack up
This guy should just travel on the nether roof so people won't find it and he should charge diamonds for the locations of smaller dungeons that give a part of the coordinates upon completion because your dungeons are awesome and you aren't paid enough And he should sell a license for dungeon hunting and his custom rewards could include a very fast bred horse or some kind of item that could call you when the hertmit needs you or a knock back 1000 stick (the stick if the yeeter) or some special wrench that turns blocks like the debug stick (idk it would be fun or something probably see if you can add that stuff into the game with magic or something)
Texture wise, his is the best build I think I’ve ever seen
Dude, you´re truly a minecraft (and advertisement) master!
Bdubs is an artistist
best build by Bdubs ive seen on Hermitcraft
I feel like the yt compression algorhythm really doesn't do justice to the way builds look in reality.
The gradient on those towers, especially on the upper ledge is one of the coolest things I've seen in Minecraft; EVER!
Oh my god! That gate is beyond words
"A BDubs for scale." That's not how that works. We need a banana
BDubs, Master Builder!
It's crazy how he's taken a simple game to such an intricate level. There's always something to learn from a bdubs episode!
The hermits will never find the next area, because it's a savannah, not a (Sahara) desert. :D (Unless it's back in season 6) That epic mountainside build, though. Poor Impulse - he's trying to make a large epic Dwarven megabase, and that build is exactly the type of entrance a megabase would have. Maybe a build collab with Impulse?
BdoubleO Speaks for The trees
If the builder hermits were artists, Bdubs would be a watercolorist
I love the 'trompe-l'œil' (deceive the eye) technique you're using at the gate.
Bdubs' new technique instantly makes all other builds look like yesterday's news.
Gosh, I love that gate and the shadow technique.
with that thumbnail i thought this was a building with bdubs video
Maybe the price for the compass clue could be some netherite ingots, so it's easier to make lodestones ?
Seeing the pillars in the white world blew my mind. The artificial depth is a game changer. I'm amazed at how you keep changing the game!
You know, I would love to see a server with BDubs, Mythical Sausage, Grian, Scar and SmallishBeans (just to mention a few)… not necessarily purely survival, but somewhere, where they just build, rebuild, terraform and get up to mischief together…
OMG! My mind is blown by this texturing. Just how, he's a genius
that gate's incredible, kudos.
Amazing
16:39 /locate minecraft:pillager_outpost until you find the one with the savana lmaoo
Tango has a third eye now!
You should make it so they have to travel on horseback to get to the dungeon. Then you can add little things on the way
BDubs… Big might be an understatement when describing the Gate Ruins. A proper description would be Gigantic, Gargantuan, or Celestial. I would call you a madman for building something that enormous, but that title of “Most Insane Hermit” either belongs to DocM for bending physics to his will, or Iskall for building the largest tree I have ever seen.
Man thats a really great parkour course Etho built for the hermits. Thanks for showing us, Bdubs!
You Texture Genius!!! This build is a gorgie boi!!! 😲
The gate looks amazing; love it!
The texture is wild. I'm not a builder. More of a "been building a functional computer in Minecraft for 8 years" kind of guy. So that castle is just unbelievable.    Great build, man.
LOL.. Somebody else made it.. B bubs?  A dubs?  LOL
As much as I love it when people repeatedly misspeak. It's a savanna, not a Sahara.  Ridiculous build btw. I gasped!
Truly a next level inspirational build. Ty whacky moss man for your wisdom !!
Bdubs' builds are WILD
Why do I almost like the commercial breaks more than the rest of Bdubs video lol?
best builder in minecraft
anyone else gonna correct him calling a savannah biome the Sahara desert? ahahaha
And this is exactly why Bdubds is in a whole different level, such a great technique of building. Btw you can set up your chunks lower for when you want to reveal the area of the build you are doing!
That technique is insane
This looks like it's from LOTR. So cool so original.
Get some beacons from Tango and Impulse to save some time with the mountain carving.
The gate is just incredible
That door blew my mind so bad that I paused it, went back to look at it again, and did it for like 10 times
Savannah*
You have a nice storage
That gradient on your dungeon is like nothing I've ever seen. The build envy is real. Ima try that.
that outfit is just prep work for the next season of last-life
Go to -5500 2400 for a surprise lol Well that was easy
Hermit Ring is looking like a pretty cool open world RPG.
I love your idea of scattering quests and interesting builds far out intoyour world for others to find. It just adds so much life and interest to a world to run across something like that out in the wild
"Never make a flat wall in Minecraft" Well... :D That build is impressive, Bdubs!
bbbdubsss did u check ur yard ruins when u searched
Bdubs I have to say watching Tango live on stream do that adventure with all the hermits watching along was one of the best live stream experiences I've ever had. I would genuinely play an entire original game designed by you if it all had that left of care and imagination and aesthetic in it. Fantastic!
One of the most entertaining Hermits on the server.
It’s in a Sahara……lol savanna
Best commercials on YouTube :D  Also, I firmly believe that there is someone unknown on the Server. The Underground church and the tree of Whimsy must be build by someone else but Bdoubs^^ Maybe an ancient civilization or a ghost or something^^
Definitely gonna try the gradient... Amazing job bdubs... I cant wait to try it myself
I just wanna say you are insane bro
You can make the dungeon door a big gravel ( textured ) door so it can fully open and close with the help of pistons ?
That facade and gate blew my mind
That illusion of the band on the tower is so good :o
Just seen the first minutes. What a great dungeon! Maybe you can use armorstands for things like shovels. I've used them in my creative world and they really light up the place! Keep up the good work!
Wait the pillars are flat??? Bdubs is such a master builder omg
Sahara is my favorite biome
The natural mountain Bdubs found for the gate is astounding, Its hard to believe that Bdubs didn't build it himself
siiiiick
I cannot use words to express my amazement at the texturing on that gate, wow its amazing
Now i understand why bdubs ep might take longer this season haha its crazy how early in the season it is and he is already doing mega stuff
I’m loving the Elden Ring vibes Bdubs
soooo pretty!!
This build is amazing, Bdubs! I love so much that you treat building as an art form, and it absolutely shows in the results - and I also love that you share the thought processes with us. Great episode, cheers!
BDUBS DROPPING THE SECRET TECH ON US!!!! truly the MASTER of building!
BDUBS A CERTAIN TYPE OF BASTION HAS LODESTONES GARUNTEES so if u find one from there it'll be more efficient
Im so glad that this episode was released on my birthday, such a cool build!
You should put some ruins in the End and Neather
You should check out hue shifting in pixel art
Hey Bdubs, I love your videos and it’s fun to see you play with new camera angles, but the one that replaces third person back is more distracting than cinematic in some circumstances (imo). It sometimes feels like you’re being dragged along the ground in a sidecar of a horse lol. It might help to either move the camera back to give a greater perspective or up (for the same effect) or both! Thanks for the hard work and experimentation you’re putting into your content, it’s really paying off!
I'm absolutely loosing it at that build, it's gorgeous holy cow.  You're a wizard, Bdubs.
You should move the banners to a tree branch and have new banners for each parkour you make. Soon your branches will be laden with all the fun times you made
Beautiful build! Loving the texture work. Good choice of biome too - I love the look of trees in the savanna and also, no rain! I made a similar sized build in my SMP world and I love it.
This is easily one of my favorite minecraft builds I've ever seen, amazing work Bdubs!
Gorgeous texturing!
Not over textured. Epic!
awesome build!  amazing how flat it was
Wow!!! Amazing build as always :)
Best start to an episode ever
Hey Bdubs I wanna say that you using shading in your builds is pretty fun and kinda shows you taking in some of what you learned through drawing  just wanted to mention it
BDUBS HOW DO YOU DO THIS SO QUICKLY
I love your editing style this season. It’s so much more whimsical and really follows the bdubs brand
Damn wish I could build like that...that is amazing <3
His basement looks like it belongs in eldenring
I was expecting to be impressed but my god I’ve never seen anything like that.
Bdubs you left the woodland mansion on camera buddy... Ooops
Seriously impressed with your new building technique. Absolutely brilliant
I thought this was the beginning of the mega base OMG
Best in class encryption? I assume express is just using bog standard AES 256. Everybody uses it (because it's the best bang for the buck). To be clear AES 256 is a great encryption and they 100% should be using it. If not, I'd question the safety of using their services.   It's fast enough that it won't cause issues with your devices, but strong enough to be hard to break. But claiming they're best in class encryption makes it sound like they're using a proprietary encryption, which is a huge no-no. Standardized encryptions are standard for a really good reason. Lots of eyes have confirmed their safety.  If they are using AES256 then that's good. But it's not special. Just the basics.
This is why bdubs is my favorite builder
You are amazing😘
I think next challenge will be a flythrought challenge, but with fake caves and passages. So basicly coyote this hermitfliers
Why do you sponsor ExpressVPN? You know they got sold to Kape Tech, right? A company that's been mentioned in the same breath as Malware Distribution, the CIO and Hacking. I just wonder how much people look into the companies they sponsor and not just about how much they get paid etc.
Just that thumbnail deserves a like.... Just WOW
This is so cool with the texture
Fantastic build today. I know you're probably already mostly done with the dungeon, but for future large dungeons you could make them with multiple paths and sell keys that unlock one of the paths so you can make more back on a single dungeon.
I love this dungeon concept so much - it reminds me of shows like Adventure Time :)
This is phenomenal.
Absolutely insane bdubs!!!
That ledge looks so real!! Genius
Bdubs, is this the summer gate? I know you guys are 33s.
Bdubs I can’t express enough how beautiful and elegant your architecture is! Your thumbnails this time around are also so organic and sleek. The ancientness has so much character.
Loving all the Elden Ring inspired builds this season!
Bdubs's breadcum trail ;"D
The gate us majestic and regal as hecc, bdubs has outdone himself this season
that might be the best gradient/texture work ive seen in minecraft ever!
Have to say I haven't seen such interesting sponsor segments on any other channel :D
I'm just awestruck. This sort of stuff just makes my day :0 ❤️
wow just wow
I just love how much passion Bdubs has for building, I have a feeling this is gonna be the best Hermitcraft season so far. Also Bdubs, I've got a prank suggestion for ya. Put diorite blocks in random locations in iskall's base, just to see how long it takes him to notice.
We need Bdubs to build a Giga-base
Just wow
Jeez, Bdubs is a wizard when it comes to building. He always manages to shatter expectations.
The build looks so good!
Looooove the ruins style and the added history. It's amazing! I def need to practice. Good work!
Great, as usual Blarg gruag
Instantly Bdubs does Scar’s bit better than him xD
What about an underground dungeon!
This. This is just blew my mind. Wp
You should definetly make each of the BANNERS a different color! That way, people are enticed to scavange for ALL banners. They become like collectors items :) "Oh you only have the red parcour one? Well, I already managed to complete the yellow AND the green ones."
Awesome episode, i love what youre doing this season!!
Dang, I can't wait when after a year or so and the hermitcraft season 9 world download will be available, finding all of Bdubs structures from all over the world would be the ultimate adventure. Since Minecraft has unlimited world limit it will be the largest open world adventure game
Bdubs is on a different level
WOW! The build is absolutely beautiful! 23:40"Headed to my storage system..." lol BDubs pulled a Grian trick. 😆
What an amazing build!  The texturing is perfect, definitely not too much.  Thank you so much for the lesson, I feel so inspired!  Time to open up creative mode!
Mrs. Bdubs: Honey, what's with the couch fort? Bdubs: IT'S A TUNNEL, IT'S FOR WORK!
Incredible. Gg bdubz
The zoom out blew me away! Well done!
Bro, You Are a GENIUS. I'm so fucking impressed wid ur today's build It rly is mind-blowing.
i'm just the only one that think about the elden ring when i see that door and just a gigantic tree xD
I love how this castle looks! @BdoubleO100, the gradient is really amazing, I also very much liked seeing the monotoned comparison :) Great job.
on any normal server that would be a finished mega base
Gradients, nah, don't you mean....  gray-dients       Yes I hate myself too 😂 And your build is amazing dude
That pattern on the door makes my heart Soo GLAD!! Pardon me whilst I plaster my entire floor with it.  Brilliantly done!  So good.  Thanks for all the loveliness Lovely! ❤️
This is crazy impressive. Next level building.
the crosshatch on that door looks so dope
Truly impressive 👍😃👊
Duplicate the entire Elden Ring..🤔  🤨 Nah.
That build is incredible. Straight out of a painting
Mind is blown rn
WOW! I genuinely can't wait for the World Download in... two years or whatever. All your builds are glorious! You manage to outdo every other builder I know :D The videos are wonderful btw. Great job! So unique.
Dude, that build is absolutely beautiful! Extremely impressive!
Bdubs, you are the Michaelangelo of Minecraft!!!! this is possibly the best Minecraft build EVER and you have shown how to incorporate real world art tecniques into a silly game of blocks.
I looove the new build and texture concept!
That gate is spectacular!!! The gradient and shadows truly work magic. Also the explanation with the white world was very didactic and clear. Thanks, Bdubs!!
Bdubs, the only person whos Commmercial breaks I dont start spamming the arrow keys on.
that gate is the best minecraft build i have ever seen. absolutely insane!!
This door puts iskall and impulses cave entrances to shame, still love all of them :D
THE TREEEE OF WHIMSEEEY
yeeeae aa a a a  aa
Bdub! This is next level stuff! Wow!
The gate was breathtalking. You are amazing !
Shouldn't the clues be a bit whimsical as well?
I thought that thing that was floating on top of the mountain was a guard tower for the gates, it would of been cool if it was,m just a little detail
Now make the door open using redstone
Damn B-Dubs really is pumping out these episodes fast! So much respect!
The gate reminds me of creating low-poly models. You can't get much detail with the shape, so you do it with the texture. Excellent job as always Mr. BDoubleO
2nd try of try to find out how bdubs made he's clock smaller :) If u can help, please reply! :D
Am I the only one picking up on BDubs saying Sahara instead of Savannah?
WOW!!!
I just wish Grian didn't cheat and go on camera account and give Tango unsolicited hints
wow.. amazing again bdubs..
Impulse: I am going to build a mountainentrance! Bdubs: Hold my shulker box! :D (you bothe are awesome!)
The use of gradients as shadows is honestly next level, I'm gonna use that in my next builds!
I could watch this man watch paint dry! So good at keeping people engaged. Oh and these builds are Magnificent but we already knew that.
Absolutely brilliant gate. Cant wait to see what adventure awaits inside !!!
I laughed so much when I saw your hiding place on Tango's video 🤣 Did not see you at all!
looks really great bdubs :)   do you use any mods for designing your builds in creative mode? like doing large-scale edits across many blocks at once?
You should get mumbo to make the whole door actually open
Look at all those stacks of "cromprete prowder"™! 😂
When bdubs switched to the all white world to show how flat the build was i was shocked! Truly perfect and amazing build by bdubs as always
When Bdubs says most of his creative builds will be on his Build with Bdubs series and he builds one of the coolest gates (despite it being flat) I've seen.  Amazing what one can do with such texturing and depth tricks.
This was the best (flat) build done in survival by Bdoubs so far. It's crazy seeing your building skills evolving like this. Ps. Now I know why there is no new "building with bdubs" :D Alone this build took probably ages.
Wow. I was watching the gate segment and caught myself with my mouth half-open in awe! Great job Bdubs!
BDUBS!! WHY JUST WHY THIS IS JUST EPISODE 5!!  CALM DOWN!!  P.S. Sorry for caps
I’m gonna be obsessing over and rethinking how I use gradients now. I love it so much
Sahara is Seoson 6 shops 🤣 Savana
My..jaw dropped when I saw the Thumbnail alone, and I know that I won't have a jaw at the end of this video :D
Omg! That’d make a great entrance for a dwarven mine.
Too bad Bdubs didn't turn in his eggs in time just like Doc did -_-
Bro Bdubs is insane with these designs; by far the most talented hermit
Genius! Great use of values, you really out here painting with blocks :D that Gate is fantastic looking! This is like a minecraft tutorial for basic painting on the importance of tonal value in adding depth.
What an amazing idea and thus far even more amazing execution for this season. The lodestone and clues sound super promising. Something like the Ravens Point thing in the movie Onward or the "angels show the way" thing from Angels and Demons would be a pretty cool work-in. Have a compass with a lodestone point to the first. Tango did something similar with False's Beans copper shop for April Fools. Think it'd be even more fun to have them more spaced out with puzzle elements or secret entrances. Thanks for all the inspiring work!
Hope to see a Scar + Bdubs mega build colab in Hermitcraft
Wow, your builds are incredible..
What about a dungeon found by figuring out a string of clues? Like, you pick up the first clue at the Tree of Whimsy, and it leads you somewhere that gives you the next clue, etc, etc, etc, and you have to figure out ALL of them to find the dungeon.
Keep the cloak bc it's a good camo
That thumbnail makes clicking irresistible
I think he just discovered a primitive form of normal mapping.
Bdubs explanation of color theory and shading is amazing :D seeing how much texture you can add to a flat wall is so cool
I felt kind of burnt after last season (not by BDubs in particular, just the season as a whole) so I haven’t been closely following this season so far. But wow, this is super impressive and what I wanted to see more of last season so I will definitely keep tuning in
Amazing build designs
Holy bazooka the thumbnail is epic
Kinda crazy this videos 30 minutes long, posted 45 minutes ago and already got 30k views 200 comments
Shouldn’t have shown that raid outpost…
feels like bdubs has been playing alot of from soft games for inspiration
Should be called the Igenius store.
That texturing is crazy!
Bdubbs has become one of my fav hermit that I just started watching this season
Phenomenal build and great thumbnail.
"Not even express VPN"... Well... That's what the contract says at least. The reality is that the capability is there
At this point your building is art. Your builds belong in a museum bdubs!
This was so interesting seeing your shadow technique ! I will definitely try to implement that in my builds :O. This entrance looks amazing!
Looks wonderful
Ahahahhaahzhahahahahahah beautifules... no wordssss!!!! Inspiration ✨✨✨✨👍👍👍yessssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!
This is literally painting in minecraft. This is crazy
The Bread WHAT Trail!?!? 🤣
Build some dungeons underground underwater or super hidden so they can need the hints.
Just got Fly Boys nostalgia with that intro
You should not have shown that pillager outpost that is going to be a dead giveaway
@18:01 😱😱🤩
I honestly need to save this video as "how to create faux depth in minecraft" or something, this is so impressive
It's called a 'savanna'
bdubs you reveal that its near pillager outpost
What a build.
One of the best looking builds I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe how much detail you can get in
LOVE the timelapse! So happy you are starting to do them!
Amazing... You did kinda give it away with the - + thing... I mean it's one of two directions now. - + OR + - :D
What an insane build
... what
Redstone, singing, the most amazing building, is there anything Bdubs can’t do?
"I have to go to my storage system real quick" >casually walks into Tango's
Congratulations. You won this Season's most Epic thumbnail.
woooooaaaaaaahhhh bdubs! the built is very cool
His storage system is just Tango's chests XD
Minecraft God! 🙏🙌
Bdubs you're a frickin' genius.  That facade is amazing.  The Bdubs Gradient System might be the Etho's hopper clock of buidling.
Before season 9 started I always imagined myself if I was a hermit just building beautiful fantasy structures all over the server, each one with its one lore. That way the other hermits could actually explore the world and discover its history. Then this madman came and did exactly that but x100 times better lol.
That gate is what i imagined Impulse to build for his dwarfen impyre entrance
Bdubs building skills is out of this world.  That's basically optical illusion.
Nice job bdubs. Grtz from the netherlands
Jawdrop
So far the best content of the season is here at Bdubs.
That build is stunning!
I wish bdubs would join the homies smp for a week just to flex his huge bulging building muscles
That door gave me massive Elden Ring vibes. its insane
wouldn't it be cool if instead of it just spitting out random clues there were three faces in the tree? And the clues spit out of their mouths? I think that would be pretty neat.
Not Sahara LOL its savanah
Your best epesodse so far. You are in the next level
Bdubs is just so good at building it’s crazy. It’s been 10 years and he still amazes me every time
I love the dnd type stuff
Im just here for the weekly ExpressVPN commercial, I have no interest in minecrafts
Hey bdubs, why don’t you show us the courses/challenges in your creative world on video so the other hermits can’t use the background to determine where they are located so you make more on your clues
The door on thumbnail gives me LOTR vibes something like the door to Mines of Moria
Your builds are amazing this season. I loved seeing your parkour challenge and THAT GATE IS EPIC. 💖💗💖
I love getting notifications for new videos- I know the madman’s at it again 😁. Looks stunning!
8:12 Bdub's internal fight between narcissistic and creative. He wants to take credit for his "perfect redstone", but wants to maintain the lore that someone else made the dungeon. 🤣
Bdubs, that is insane! The texturing looks so good and smooth. It doesn’t even look like minecraft!
Sahara ? Savana ?
The thumbnail got my hyped!
"From scrayyyitch" idk if you have some sort of regional accent or your just putting on for the viewers but regardless. I love it. Never change friend ❤
Bdubs in my opinion is the best minecraft builder on hermitcraft, (one of the top builders overall), and this build is just a testament to his skill
THE GATE IS LOKKING SOO FUCKING COOL
Bdubs, got a small idea here. Instead of showing us the building process or the thought process for the dungeon, why dont you try making a small trailer/ teaser for it. That way there arent much spoilers and we get see some quality bdubs edits
The shadows with the color gradient is messing with my head in the Best possible way! 😲 so cool!
I've not watched your videos lately, but your gate reminds me very much of the gate of Erebor, and the dungeon under your base reminds me of the mines of Moria
Someone's been playing elden ring 👀👀
What a beautiful gate!  I wish i was an artist like you.
Bdubs that gate looks awesome. It looks like a painting.
I wish i could like this more than once, that build is absolutely incredible!
Bdubs you have outdone yourself! This is amazing!
Only Bdubs builds give me tears of joy this is crazy awesome.
cant wait for building with BdoubleO100!
Man oh man that is gorgeous.
Hey Bdubs, do you do pixel art? This gradient-logic is really pixelartie. Good job! :D
Just a suggestion. What if you make your "clues" that Hermits will buy, into "keys" that will be essential in completing the trials you've made. That way you wouldn't have to worry about people spoiling your build locations. You can also set it so that Hermits can still try out your trials, but without the "clues/key" inputed somewhere near the end of the trail, they won't be able to obtain the flag or items  that they need to give you. This way, you'll still be earning a decent amount of money for the clues. To make it better, you can also have  a time duration for the clues in which they'd need to find the ruin before the time limit, else they'd need to buy another clue/key (meaning, when the time limit is up, maybe like irl dayv then you'd reset the redstone or something ).   Oh! And great idea on the gradient! Didn't think gradients would give out such a fantastic illusion!
"I'm  going to my storage system real quick cos I need Blackstone"  *Goes to tango's systems and casually robs him*
The texturing on the gate is stunning!!!
Gradients are always the hot thing!
another incredible episode mr O100
You have brightened my day once again sir!
Wow that texturing blew my mind when you showed that is was all flat. Seriously you should feel proud that's probably the best building I've seen.
Bdoubs is such an insane builder bro I can't believe my eyes when he switched to the white world WOW
can anyone give this man a beacon please? this must've been very painful to do without one. anyway amazing like always! much love
Now I know why the videos take so long, waiting for the sponsor cooldown time
Bdubs is so skilled. Blows my mind. omg
That build looks absolutely marvelous!  I just parts for my PC and I'm gonna definitely try to learn from your building process; both in Minecraft and in making art. Thanks for all you do BDubs! ♥️
Hoping that BDubs didn't show too much stuff. He did show the area around the gate pretty extensively
When Bdubs says “his” storage room, it made me laugh. I am learning art and entertained at the same time. Thanks, Bdubs!
bdubs be like: i build somthing of camera…
I literally gasped in real life when he revealed that giant stone gate in the mountain. It... it's so beautiful. He's really using Minecraft to paint his world. Not only is using the gradients as shading a brilliant idea, but that texture on the door itself? Gorgeous *chef's kiss*
When you see the thumbnail picture and think that Bdubs is making an epic megabase, but it's "just" his dungeon. All hail the mighty Bdubs and his creative powers!
Nice storage system!
Bdubs : Builds more in one sittings than I do over weeks Also him : So i did a little build
only Bdubs can turn a flat wall into 3d castle
bduuubs you're insanely goood @.@ im at awe
Just figured i'd say hello. Hope life is well and you have a good week.
One of the clues: pay more diamonds this clue is a dud. And maybe: refund, give this to bdubs for a refund on diamonds. (Price negotiable)
Bdubs’ builds have inspired my entire 200 day world
That's such a huge gate for such a little guy!
The ruin is like a little minecraft escape room! I love it
those side pillar thingys are so cool, actually looks like pieces. GOOD JOB!
Any other hermit after building that castle : “so this is my mega base that I’ve been working on all season and I hope you guys like it”  Bdubs: “alright you guys, this is my dungeon that I built in my spare time so some other hermits could use it like one or two times and then we’ll move on to the next project.
"my storage system" XD
another cool build! <3
Kind of like iskall treasure hunt
So basically today BDubs is bringing Normal Maps to Vanilla Minecraft :)
I audibly gasped when you zoomed out. This gateway is absolutely gorgeous! It's so wild how much depth and detail you were able to fit in
I feel like the Bdubs base is an anti Iskall base. Fist it had the diorite monolith and now it has a giant birch tree
Everytime Bdus said gradient my brain immediately jumped to the fact that he has using grey blocks(GREY-dient, the puns are really like that sometimes)! Amazing build though:D
Hey B. you could use loadstone and sell loadstone compass to give a hint to the next clue.
That shadow technique was absolutely mindblown!!
Wow. Just… wow. That texturing is just insane, so interesting seeing the difference with no colour!   Can’t wait to see who finds the gate first. Watching Tango figure out the ruins was so much fun, loved it! Hope you sell lots of clues this time!
That looks freaking amazing. The shadows OMG BDUBS YOU GENIUS
Okay. I’m officially obsessed with Bdubs building.
23:13- Savanna. Sahara is Grian, Mumbo and Iskall's shop in season 6. Lol. Also amazing work on the gate.
Love this ep. Good work
i don't remember that storage system.... hm
Holy crap this man has become so good at texturing
Astounding, Bdubs. I’m blown away
I thought you where going to start your mega base, but no.... It's Just a BIG gate
I wish we hadn't seen that Pillager Tower
You are my favorite hermit right now, cant wait for next ep
Engaging comment becuaee I love the gate.
Best intro ever.....  Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away If you can use some exotic booze There's a bar in far Bombay Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away.....
You're just on another level man :D
I saw the thumbnail and just went, “What the hell Bdubs?!”
Me when Bdubs goes Frank Sinatra at the start.
this is crazy
Bdubs is madman !!
ive never thought about gradients being used like that! i am just mind blown. amazing work bdubs!!! thank you for showing us this wisdom; in episodes where hermits really tell us how they go about their builds, I seriously appreciate it. ill check out "building with bdouble0" when I've got the time :D
Wow it looks like a lord of the ring castle
Wow😮
It’s Savannah, not Sahara
These little (and by little i mean huge) adventures Bdubs has been making are sooo good! I love the concept and it seems like so much fun for everyone! Fun for Bdubs to build, fun for the hermits to play, and fun for the viewers to watch! ❤
Loving the story of Dungeon Quests!
Bdubs!!! This is amazing !
I too was thinking if it was possible to use darker blocks as shadows and lighter blocks as highlights for building.  Holy Jesus. What the heck did this guy just made with flats?
Beautiful content. Love the basement so much. The lore with the tree is amazing.  Such inspirational work!
Absolutely genius work with the gradient thing. Like, that's Disney Park levels of manipulation. So cool!
The amount of work you have been putting in these episodes are insane, unmatched!
"Speak friend and enter." A certain dwarf on the server seems made for this dungeon.
So it is next to a pillager outpost...
I think this new camera man needs a payrise. Some of the shots are just amazing!
Man... That build is so gorgeous! Bdubs' building prowess is always so impressive.
The door shadowing is inane great job
The giant gate is really cool. It kinda reminds me of bloodborne
"We're making ANOTHER dungeon"  LOL 8:12
jesus christ that gate looks phenomenal
That gate looks outright marvelous
I say this all the time, but I love when the hermits break their building technique down, show their process and give insights n such on how they build and whatnot. So fricken cool    Oh and PONPRETE POWDER made me laugh harder than it should've
This is so similar to the build in chill stream
sees thumbnail ....................Jeeees Bdubs you are incredible
Bdubs add some spore blossom to the whimsy tree for the particle effects
I loved the time lapse i really have learned to appreciate a bdubs timelapse when we get em!
Amazing build
gonna love seeing grian think he can land on a ledge from far away only to find there is no ledge up close. XD
Perfect parkour course I say! - LOVE the build 😍

Bdubs has outdone himself with the new dungeon, just the facade is magnificent!

Recipe for Awesome Hermitcraft: give the hermits a really short noncommittal season where they won’t want to start any of their big ideas and the ideas will just pile up. The next season will be long and overflowing with creativity and they will cling to it for as long as they can!
Honestly bdubs should make it his megabase
Get elden ring vibes from the underground. nice.
Great job bdubs
Your gothic architecture this season has been insaneeee!
Very impressed bdubs
I’ve only seen the thumbnail but O.M.G!!!
There's nothing more BDubs than a clock in one hand and a bed in the other.
I think I know where he is but I ain't go say nothing. Let's get bdub's pockets fat first 🤣😁👍
If Bdubs compliments the redstone, it's definitely his or possibly by a small chance Etho's❤️
`
bdubs commercials are some of the only ones i dont skip.. hes so creative
The moment when Bdubs recreates normal maps but in Minecraft... Normal maps are a technique used in rendering to give depth detail with shadows only (confusing to explain, look it up if you're interested)
U and Docm77 are the 2 hermits who continue to blow my mind each episode
BDUBS  my skin has ur eyes
i'd be much more dramatic if you drop the clues from the top of the tree
Every build of yours is fantastic. Reminds me of dark souls too
Bdubs, every episode, you outdo yourself. Every episode I look at the thumbnail and think, "there's no way he did that in a week."
Such a great builder. Bdoubleo, u r truly the best builder
Yo bedubs. The other day I was mowing and reminiscing about the times of viva piñata. Good series. Got the game because of it
This build is insane, I'm obsessed with the gradient
Noo, why didn't I get notified.
Thank you so much for bringing back the moss!! Honestly I was missing it
For the next course it would be cool to build it in a large cave
He was right. That is a pretty big gate.
OH HAPPY DAY!
Lol the intro
Am I late
bdubs is my favorite minecraft builder. he has a very unique style of building which makes his creations more special. gotta love that about him. ooh, and also his big eyes and big SMILE :D
Bdubs is a chad
He's done it!
Good lord BDubs CALM DOWN
This is just crazy, how much has Bdub’s built so far this season, I wonder how it will turn out in the end of the season
What a beauty of a build
Awesome video bdubs don’t know if you will see  this but love the content!
Your parkour was genius Bdubs
This is gonna be good
Tango was the perfect hermit to put your course to the test! Watching him puzzle it out was so much fun! Great job, BDubs! Quality entertainment!
OMG

BDubs is always being the change the Minecraft world wants to see

Holy mother of pog that build on the thumbnail is next level... gotta upvote even before watching the episode
😃
Finally, the return of the king!
LETSGO a new bdubs vid I know already its gonna be great!
What if you Bdoubs would build a Colosseum looking structure to match with the monolith. Maybe it would work as a mini game as well as a shop like in some football stadiums. And maybe have a changing theme at the arena area😁 ps: that face just because of Bdoubs
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
