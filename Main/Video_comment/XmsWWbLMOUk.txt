Anyone 2025?
How is he even alive omg!!!! So many close calls I’m so stressed😭😭😭
Most feared mob is a fully armored baby zombie.
11:00 I almost had a heart attack
You just killed two invisible spiders which are one of the rarest mobs in the game
Where doggo
10:57 my stomach sank omg
8:06 this reminds me sooo much of the wkuk sketch landmine factory
He is so hilarious
Scar: zombies you can’t scare me like that  Zombie: ugh
The bossiest boss of all Minecraft bosses…Le berry bush.
23:18 JUKEBOXES ARE NO MORE. VIBE MACHINES NOW RULE!
i fear whitches the most 😅
This "tree" build is so good, i built a replica in my survival world!!! :)
The casual diamond he floats past in the water elevator and the cut in clips somehow infuriates me
Did u say enchanting? At 9:19
Still stressful.😁
What’s the Seed?
I can HEAR the audience screaming "SCAR NO!", every time Scar nearly dies.
creepers they just pop out of nowhere or fall on you
nah skeletons are definitely worse😭particularly the ones in the snowy biomes with slowness☹️
me: :( "hello there my fellow miners and crafters!" me: :D
You know that all of nemos siblings were eaten before they were even hatched? so that could not have been his brother
I find skeletons easy to deal with, Creepers meanwhile are my arch nemesis
Scars British accent made me laugh so hard lights sparked behind my eyelids and I coughed. Edit: 9:20
scar ily you're my fave YouTuber
"I'm a simple man trying to make my way through the universe" Mandalorian fans: Hey, I've seen that one before!
Vindicators are so scary! And I guess Brutes too but I don't have to deal with them as much. Just the axes and the rate of attack, yipes!
Baby zombies the worst
Love everything you build and create ❤️
9:20 dihd yuoh sehy ænchanting?
21:25 “i got a bit carried away” he said as he skips forward 2,5 hours
It's 💀
How is this base so cool. From the views to the builds it’s so awesome!!
Skeletons over creepers for me. At least I can hear a creeper and have a chance to escape; many times I've been on a ledge/climbing a waterfall and a skeleton shoots me off and I die; also skeletons are in the overworld and the nether
Best hardcore base lol
10:54 that’s all I’m gonna say 😯 love u scar keep up the great work
Genuinely the most heart warming guy
Wither
Skellys! They have the zooms in hardcore!
Scar stealing the Enchanting Table is so appropriate since they're in the Last Life server
Normaly watching Scar and stressing about him diyng every 5 minutes is both entertainingand stressfull, but currently my irl is over the top stressfull, so stressing about Scar's survival feels kinds relaxing. At least here I'm not stressing about life changing decisions! Thanks for making me smile and make my brain disconnect from irl for a few minutes! Also, I love your base upgrade!
if it's minecraft hour it'll be easy
Oh OH DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON BABY ZOMBIES... WITH A IRON HELMET
“Axolotls aren’t evil, right?”  Not yet.
21:05 I am now holdin' my meat, my axe is in the off-hand, we've got pillagers roaming the land
3:31 dont click this I'm just marking my spot
Where is ur cat I saw it in last vid but no more lol
Two invis spiders luck is back up
God dammit I was SOOOO PUMPED for superfast build mode haha!
creeper when building, otherwise over all wither or multiple guardian
Creepers. I don't necessarily fear them but early game and when you're near your builds. The give me a lot of anxiety
Scars voice crack 8:09 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The mob I fear the most is the opposite of scar
This was prerecorded, but you are home, prayers for your speedy recovery much love
I fear every mob, probably because I'm just not good at fighting
So happy to see you back, pray everything is going well with you
I fear the skeleton more because he doesnt need  to be close to do damage
how are you still alive HOW HES A MAGIC MAN
Good soup
Thank you Scar for your everlasting good mood. You have no idea how much it bring me joy to hear your laughter, and you never fail to cheer me up. Life is hard right now, but with you it's a little easier. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
11:47 skeletons in soul sand biomes 💀😔
Skeleton!
scar at 3 hearts  Also scar "oh beautiful cave"
the super fast build mode music started and i got so pumped and the level of disappointment I had when the music stopped-----
10:36  *scar - you’re not you when ur hungry* pls get the snickers reference hahahah
2:30 He literally gets the option of the bright and sunny path or the dark and gloomy one. And we all know which one he chooses
Super fast build mode music is it for me
He didn't die in the pillaged mansion because he gave the pillager bread
Subscribing to car should come with health insurance because of the risk of heart attacks.
You make the best Minecraft videos
I love your videos
Captain Price to Soap : 17:50
I love the series scar you are such an inspiration! I believe in you, your getting all the way to the 100 hour mark!!!
I fear players
Witch is worst
Amazing game
Me watching scar: 😳😃😶😐😵😵‍💫🥴
17:24 That scream lol
11:49 I have to agree, skeletons are the absolute worst
At 9:45 when he talks about the "good vibrations" provided by the music, I know it's not how minecraft works but I got nervous that he would play it too loud and it would shake the platform lol
I Got 10 HEART ATACKS WATCHING THIS
Everyones talking about scar giving them heart attacks while Im getting a ocd attack over the one mis-rotated trapdoor near the plank
So no one noticed the pillager in the bottom right corner at 20:19 ……?
I knew you could do it scar
Creepers no doubt
Anyone else see the diamond enchanted mob at like 18:00
Scar sees enamy hem HaVE SoMe BrEaD!
I hope your surgery goes well and you recover soon.
Does he hum the Harry Potter theme when he says Jurassic park? 2:50
👍
I am starting to question, if this really is a hardcore world. Would scar really jump from a clif that often if that could end his series?
Ooo
14:07, probably the best scar quote of the year thus far.
10:55 THAT FALL MADE ME GAPE AT MY SCREEN SO BIG MY SISTER HAD TO ASK ME WHATS WRONG LMAO
Eat your cereal
I just found scar on my feed and his enthusiasm and overall demeanor are so infectious you can’t help but to smile and laugh along with him
Did you said enchanting? -Grian 2022
Who else forgot about how good graham crackers are
I LOVE the music at the ending! So cool
scare actually a god at minecraft comes close to death for our entertainment
Guys let's all play minecraft!
About skeletons and creepers, when I see them coming I dislike skeletons the most but when they just sneak up behind you creepers are the worst.
Ohh scar, you just stole Grian's enchanter
innn *HARDCORE* minecraftt
"wacking each other with wrapping paper sticks" -Scar  😆
I am so mad that time-lapse failed 😭 that music was jammin 😂
I want to do a hardcore world but I die stupid ways lol
Scar, call the gorge, Goodtimes Gorge
SKELETON
i think it would be cool to have a water fall come down from the top and then the water go from farm to farm as it goes down for the crops
Goodtimeswithheartattacks
Scars super power is giving us friggin heart attacks
Scar in hardcore caves is just a different kind of entertainment
10:53 got a mini heart attack
❤️ very nice builds
Yes
super hero name: best time with scar super power: making great content sorry for not changing anything you already do this
Creeeeeeeper is the worst im mean come on people you make a new minecraft hardcore world and you are 800 days in and then boom a creeper finishes your progress in a mine
The mob that scares me most? easy. Cave Spiders. I've lost so many hardcore worlds to them.
microdosing on heart attacks is good for your health right??
What are the chances of getting triple tridents
You delightful charleton, sir, stealing that enchanting table  : )
Mob that frightens me? Any kind of Jockey. Those things are rare but still horrific to encounter when your almost dead and out of food
Skeletons are 10 times worse i can tell you
„I‘d like to leave with my head still on my head“ uh yeah sure xD 17:56
Irrigation is channeling of water. Scar called ladders irrigation channels. Scar is water confirmed.
"those berry bushes are gonna BE BURNT.. for my safety" isnt fire bad too?
I absolutely love the new house! But if I were you, I would make the bridge that connect the the mountain droop down like a rope bridge as the straight bridge kinda takes away from making the house look like it’s hanging from the tree, making it seem to be anchored to the mountain. But either way you’re doing an amazing job Scar! <3
The mob I fear the most: Hoglins...
If you were to do a waterfall that Cascades down multiple spots through your farms that would make it look so amazing
WHY is it trapdoors
some watch ASMR to ease their anxiety... I watch SCAR and pour gasoline on the anxiety fire
Good news: I have a history of low blood pressure, and with this series I think I'll see improvements in my condition, because Scar constantly makes my heart race with his risks.
Skeletons are definitely the most annoying but I think the creepers are worse because sometimes you won’t even know that they’re there until they’ve exploded and you’ve died 😅
Everytime Scar jumps out of his base I forget how to breathe
whatching scar on hardcore mc has me on the edge of my seat
Scar got strike by lightning of a rod and fall damages
scar can u take care of the fox on your cliff? it's a gift from jellie lol
Maaan the old hanging platform was so good
Themob i fear the most is the wither in bedrock edition on hard difficulty
Always have blocks in your hot bar
blaze i fear them the most so much so that when ever im killing them i have a fire resistance potion with me at all time when fighting them
This episode should be called "I escape death for 24 minutes straight" The anxiety is so real...
Imagine ur last words being "did u say enchanting?"
Creeper hands down. If just one of those shows up near what I’m building i feel immense panic. 😱
Watching scar play hardcore gives me anxiety hahaha
1 day scar is going to jump of his plank and not land in that tiny.tiny.tiny lake at the bottom......... 💥
0:24 I believe in you Scar, You can do this
I mean, watching Scar deliever charged Creepers was nerve racking but fun. Watching him almost die in a hardcore world is just pain 😅
This series should be renamed "100 hours of adrenaline" for Scar. Watching these videos in the morning, I dont need any caffeine anymore!
I love those cliff farm so much
Scar i love your videos but my heart can't take you in a hard-core world 🤣🤣
21:05 ayo
This is great but like honestly my anxiety was on 10
I fear the warden the most
he almost died a cuple times!!! hahaha
Scar really is going all in on this living life on the edge metaphor
That greenhouse is missing a slab, suckers!
i wonder what goes thru this mans head...  his shield is breaking => holds shield instead of using his sword shield dies => runs with 2 hearts and FALLS (luckily into water that lead into a cave with no mobs
Why do I watch these episodes? They are quite stress inducing with all the near deaths. lol. The amount of time you dropped to 3 hearts or lower in this episode... Eef!  :-) Hardcore is not Scar-Safe.
i fear skeletons the most, i use the creepers to blow up other mobs xDD
This entire episode is Prof that scar isn't going to survive the 100 hours
(don't fear) the creeper
Did anyone else notice that the dog scar tamed just disappeared?
Ok we’re safe now…he says while on 2 hearts while being shot at by a skeleton
I have watched many minecrafters but u sir, are the most entertaining. Love your videos
For the blank flower spots, you should put those curly blue flowers from swamps
Skelly Is my most feared cause they have range and are quite difficult to hit sometimes
“Now you’re my friend, KILL THIS MAN”
This is the most imaginative and daring hardcore base. Love it.
Skeleton
Literally everyone’s base: main house the biggest.  Scar’s base: main house the smallest. Lol
Scar is crazy... But cool
this series is the first time i’ve watched scar and its so awesome!!
Oh, man...this build is great. Well done!
“I’d like to leave this place with my head still on my head.” Scar 2022
I just love how scar spent 10 minutes spear fishing and was completely unsuccessful   Cant stop laughing😂😂
Scar, try using your shield to offensivly, after you block a projectile, run towards the mob, shield again before it shoots, and then just hit it, and in between critical hits, use your shield. It will make your fights end quicker!
Grian: Got to be extra careful not to die Scar: Minecraft Hardcore is a bounce house with a low ceiling
The mob I fear the most are skeletons and magma cubes... They have killed me WAY to many times.
After all these years of playing minecraft, Scar dont know the F key to swap items between off hand and mainhand? You can swap items directly from the hotbar without using the mouse too.
just a heads up scar. you can hit the f key to swap items in your hands
Skely
Dumbledoors Doubled ores Double doors Dung bell adores
Skeletons and creepers are equal.  Skeletons are bad because they can attack at range, creepers are bad because they’re silent and they explode.
If scar survives the hundred hours, i might start to think that 2022 will be a great year
Scar call it "The Grand Scandon!" *Chef's kiss*
10:52 I felt my soul leave my body.
Ack scar why!?!?!?!?!? 😨😨😨😨😨😨 your gonna get yourself killed 😨😱
I fear skeleton the most
I am not ready for the anxiety attack of Scar in a hardcore world 😂 but I'm going to watch anyways because what's an adventure without some heart stopping moments 😁 I can't wait for you to get some diamond or netherite gear tho 😂
HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD
"Now you are my friend; Kill this man." Had me dead
2:30 This looks like grians base. It's time for some pranking.
I fear you
If you press f, the items in hands interchange
I wonder why he pinned my comment 🤨🤨
If he manages to survive the full 100 hours I swear I'm gonna learn French
Now ine balives that you had survived this long, you are definetly cheating
baby zombi the scariest
Yikes! …Ive developed a sudden desire to place fences everywhere… or slime trampolines below every cliff I encounter!
R U Apsoolootli noob for sorviving but jeases by bilding
Where is the pupper now?!?
Base Designing: Build a Waterfall it looks literally realy cool
Baby zombies by far for me, I can never hit those little bugger's.
at the end when he said "don't subscribe" NO! i think i will!  :D
Thanks!
*“Did you say enchanting—?!”* -Grian, 2022
This series is scary mainly because you die in the game the game dies as well
im a builder so creeper
Gripan is gonna be very embarrassed if scar survives longer, it will be like that moment in TBBT when raj whines that Sheldon got a girl before him. ;)
Scar reminds me of Jar Jar Binks when he tries to avoid danger😆....Love your builds! 😁
dude scar and Z1 would get together so well
WHAT?  did he say that the chain was holding the tree?
I'm convinced scar is the best minecrafter in the world simply because he forces himself to have 2 heart in every moment just to show how well he can really survive. We've never seen his true power until this hardcore series... It was simply... too much before...
Scar just standing there at 17:10 made my heart hurt
90% of this episode had me feeling the same way I felt the first time scar fell into the AHA death pit on X-life
Out of all mobs it has to be a armored baby skeleton
ROOOPE BRIDGE please XD to coneckt the 2 clives :D
If you hit a tamed dog with a stick 9 time then splash it with a healing and harming potion at the same time then log in and out of your game then your dog will be immortal and the only way to kill it is to splash it with harming potions. Spread the word about this and we can save more dogs. ( might not work in Java but worth a try)
alternate title: scar almost dies a bunch
24 minutes and 52 seconds of awesomeness, thanks
10:50 ohhhh myyy gossh….. AAAAAAAAAAAA
WHY CANT YOU DOUBLE LIKE THE VIDEO
Scar this series every time I watch your videos my anxiety really goes STONKS 💀
14:40 he's eating mutton in front of 3 sheep lol
Skeletons in caves I read the most because so many time I've died to skeletons in caves and couldn't get my stuff back and deleted the world
the lack of infinity pool during the build really made me nervous
WAIT THEYRE ON THE SAME WORLD?! i honestly thought hardcore let’s plays were just a trend rn lmao
I'm going to start a counter of how many times I yell "SCAR NO" while watching this.  Current count: lots.
The mobs are paid actors
My heart is literally racing, thanks for the entertainment/nervous breakdown Scar. Also maybe get some villagers, by the looks of things you could use some mending (or just use Grian's villlagers)
11:44 missed the diamond 😔
i think that the vex is the worst mob
At 10:53 my heart stopped for a moment
I love how "Scar-Safe" has just become a normal word for the hermits.
I swear scar knows exactly where hes walking, but he does all this just to give us anxiety 😂😂
22:33 those minecart tracks remind me of season 5
"now you're my friend, kill this man." - scar
WHAT IS IT 5:08
Do you still have a PO Box available to send letters and fan art to? Just curious if I sent you something if you would still get it? I’ve been watching older vids and really enjoying your older content that I wasn’t a subscriber for. Your GTA 5 free roam vids were hilarious. Tons of fun things to discover in the ol’ archives. Love what you do. You are a legend. Hope this finds you in good health.
this is the most stressful video ive ever seen
Hope you come take a look at my builds on insomniacs realm
Thorns and Mending on Shield
Scar would make it to 100 hours alone i bet
Oh wow ur land is looking beautiful
I love how he says hardcore
HermitCraft Nembers News:Fwip,Small,LD,The My thical!
Scar you are amazing  !
The house looks SO good!
You should make a floating island above the river, it would fit your base alot
OMG Scar my ❤ can't take the stress lol I was literally on the edge of my seat needing to breath but couldn't cuz my muscles to were so tense from hoping you didn't die. LOVE YA SCAR stay safe please
“Wonderful and lovely comments”, really scar none of them think you will get 100 hours XD and rightfully so, i have never seen anyone so prone to fall damage in all my life haha
Out of all the mobs, I'm scared of baby zombies. They are so fast and tiny that I can't hit them reliably and that's scary.
10:55 PLEASE. MY HEART.
how is he alive-
Diamond Armor!
Hands down scar is the most LUCKY player I have ever seen
21:06
Java:Creeper Bedrock:Wither
Skeletons are the scary ones,  because they will screw you from a distance, while creepers you just need a bit of distance and your fine
bro by the title i though you died
Scar, I just gotta say it. I'm so constantly blown away by your builds. They are always SO interesting, what with looking fantastic, having themes and stories behind them -- and even though they are mostly fantastical builds, you build them in a way that makes sense? Like, they seem structurally sound and are easy to read, I guess. Just, wow. Like, how do I convey this sentiment? You've got to be one of my favorite creatives on the internet. Bravo and kudos, Scar, I really really love the stuff that you do.
I think that you should build a place to entchant, then you wouldn't need to go to grians place all the time
I like scar videos, because it's so wholesome and I like that.
Oi
Unfortunately skeletons seem to have aim bot, wall hacks and sometimes rapid fire, so I'm going with that
On behalf of cow-kind, I accept your apology lol
"We're on the walking the plank thing, is that what it's called? The 'walking the plank thing'?"
wow
You should build a huge statue of yourself somewhere
Entertaining game
How are you still alive Scar? This was a near death montage 😅 really though you're doing fantastic, keep up the good work.
"I know I built this in episode 1 but it just feels dated..." *whilst literally being episode 2*   -Scar 2022
Those leaps are Hulk-fuel. Edit: it's all Hulk-fuel.
ender mite
Boating off a cliff only gives you fall damage in Bedrock
You cant die from fall damage while in a boat!
the worst mob is a Scar.... even tho in hardcore world, tht creature jumps frm high places like ravines, tree houses, and cliffs  truly frightening
Love the different build!! The last one was great too, but scar definitely seems more happy with this one and it shows!:)
Scar, for goodness sake, build a creeper farm and go get some netherite armour. We want to see you live long and prosper. You will survive!
Baby zombie
Scar can you use shaders pls I would love if u do pls 😊😇😄
The Creeper 😱😱😱😱
list of the most stressful events in a person's life: 4: moving house 3: getting married 2: getting divorced 1: watching scar play a hardcore series
"I am now holding my meat." -GoodTimesWithScar
...omg...the anxiety...
Scar! You could cut into the mountain to add a second level to each tier  on your farms. Then add a waterfall on the backside feeding irrigation water to your farms.
He is really living on the edge  Quiet literally
ghast
Skeletons don't bother me too much in hardcore, when in doubt you can always run away and dig yourself into a wall. Creepers will kill you just so immediately.
Grian: Scar!! This is not last life don't steal the enchanter Scar: *Steals The enchantment table*
3:27 mindcraft????
Scar! I just learned we have the same birthday!
Hey scar I just wanted to recommend building a few other trees around your base in the same style as your hanging tree, it would make it look like it’s part of the terrain more :)
I really dont want to see him die because the series for him will be over
I want to see Scar last longer them Joel. How did you & Joel join Grian's World with out him knowing? At least you replanted the wheat for Grian. Joel did not. How dare you still Grian's Enchantment table like that. glad you will give it back.  lol put a floor under your bass.  1 that is not Trap doors at all.
Yep
hey dude whats the seed?
my good sir, you have the self preservation of a lemming.
Any place isn’t scar safe.
Skelies for sure
Which mob i fear the most? Probably iron golems, one wrong move and you're as good as dead.
I really wished he hung his base on the tip of the tree
scer is lowkey gonna die in episode 3
Me: he is going to die…. He just wanted some cows!
I like it when he say "HARDCORE" XD
scar does feel like the person to say scolding cold
the farms have been “spruced” up slightly i see what you did there scar very clever pun indeed
I have never had more second-hand anxiety than from watching this video
20:01 was that a starwars reference?
ngl i have a weird feeling that scar’s gonna be the last of everyone doing this to die. like he’s already survived so much he can’t possibly die now.
Omg this episode! He is stressing me out
Two of my hardcores were ended by trident zombies,,, Then my current one was threatened by a baby drowned, with a trident, that followed me onto land too lol  Basically in that situation you’re better off fleeing than having any thoughts of fighting back,, less you have diamond armor
skeletons have aimbot
skeleton
Scar drip stone can kill you
I was feeling down, but this video got me on my feet.   :)
This generation is so beautiful, Scar’s gorge is amazing looking and there’s so much potential even if it is just 100 hours to play
16:35 that boat placing coming in clutch
Did you give your dog name "dog"?
i love scar's base it's beautful!! <3 <3 <3
My anxiety goes through the roof every time scar does something dangerous
Hey scar can you make a Giant  mechanical spider from the wild wild west please that would be so awesome
Can't wait for the 'Scar's hardcore near death expierences"- compilation! Really, pal, I love you deeply but I'm not sure I stand watching this new series because of all the heart attacks you give me about every 30 seconds! Could you PLEASE be more careful?!? I was "watching" this episode by only being able to peek through my fingers the whole time. XD  But I love that you are back after a long time and I absolutely adore your little house! (And the fields, and the mines, and everything!) Almost started crying when the timelaps music started because of all the joy you always provide with your quality content. So I try to keep up watching this to-my-heart-dangerous series, but PLEASE please try to be more careful!! <3<3<3 Love you, Scar!
I'm glad you enjoyed build! I love watching it!
When Scar gives the mutton to the dog instead of eating it and then goes to fight a skeleton I didn't know witch of us would die faster. Me from the hart attack he have me or he from that skeleton.
Scar when he goes to grians base: I hardly have enough food!! Scar when he sees a pillager: here have some bread.
How's going to tell Scar that the boat doesn't stop fall damage if you fall directly onto land?
I would like to see you live the hole 100 hours put that's never gana happen from what I've seen
Hi Scar! I'm a bit late, but I just wanted to say thank you for always putting a smile on our faces!
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Wither skeletons are definitely the worst.
the next time you build something can you use leaves and drape them across the valley
Your base is COOL! I like the way you build it in the mountain. That was a GOOD and BETTER tree house for me. Keep it up, bro.
I GOT MY SWAGGON SHIRT. I LOVE IT SO MUCH
I love how scar picks more of a death trap as a base since he’s in hardcore
this is the most stressful series ive ever watched
scar almost survived 1 day in hardcore minecraft i can't belive it
This is so stressful! But so so good!
I agree with Grian, you had to pick the most dangerous base for a hardcore world but I love it lol
It would be awesome if in some part of the cave there was a mini-river going through and creating a waterfall! like a waterfall inside the cave, which flows out and crashes down into the canal!
Scar just sayin you should learn a little axe and shield pvp, you could get out of a lot of situations like the one if the drownd or in the caves if you knew pvp. You don't need to master it, just to be half decent
My sister says you sound like markiplier and I cant see it.
“I would like to leave with my head still on my head.” - Scar 2022
This guy seems to have a lot of energy.
Can i build with you?
Use barrels insted of trapdoors
You know what? I’ve decided to believe in Scar. You can do it! Survive those 100 hours!
I think that you'll make it to 100 hours, Scar!
10:53 SCAHAR NO YOU’RE BEING TO RISKY YOU’RE STRESSING ME OUT PLEASE
Idea: You could make an open air water channel suspended in the air by either chains or supports, and then have that be some sort of artificial waterfall leading to the irrigation system,.
this is the most stressful series i've ever watched i think
in terms of normal enemies I fear the witch the most
Scar, as much as I love your builds, as a hardcore player myself I cannot thank you enough for getting rid of the Trapdoor Platform of Death and Doom. The new build looks much better and is much safer, although the plank still gives me mild anxiety where it's only one trapdoor thick. Maybe if you ever feel like terraforming in this world you could create a lake under it? Because right now you're one bad right click or unshift away from the end of the series.  Also that jump at 10:53 stopped my heart for a bit, oh my god that was close and you didn't even look to see if it was safe.
Am i the only one hearing alarm sound in the beginning?
im wondering how hes gonna survive those are most definitely NOT scar proof railings (/j)
Just want you to live.
Could you please go farther then only 100 hours? This is just looking so good.
Thank you for keeping my cardiovascular health in check
“Scar do you have to jump?” *jumps off cliff* *CUE THE HEART ATTACK*
Scar lived! Again!
Do you not* know you can block then hit your enemy then block again ?
Que Jurrassic park   Starts singing Harry Potter
Hi scar can you give me that seed it looks amazing
"Eat my mutton like a good boy" - Scar 2022
:D
This is like watching Final destination
how is he still alive? haha di almost died like 20 times haha
luche clushe
i get so scard when scar jumpse of his hous
Grian: Scar where is it Scar: tHeRe wAS a MaN whO CaME ThRougH
Scar literally has a great house
10:54 oh my god
SCAR STOP JUMPING OFF FROM YOUR TREEEEEEEE
Creeped def worse
What's the seed?
his channel name: “good times with scar:)” every time with scar: *PANIC*
Scar, you gotta download the world and fake your death at one point
New subscriber
How does he get the timer?
scar is the absolute pinnacle of actual skill and unmatched silliness/mindlessness for this channel, and i love it.
creeper
The wardening trader
THIS WAS SCARY SCAR!!!
10:53
this gave me anxiety
Magma cube most lethal. But creepers are also quite annoying.
these videos are making me age so much faster
I have watched for years and i just subscribed but u have to be my favourite YouTube to watch thanks for make me feel so happy when i watch ur videos
19:42 white fox on the mountain
God scar is awful at the game
if u jump off your house and land on a boat u will take fall damage
that wrong facing trap door irritates me
Proud of u scar!
We've enjoyed you along with the other Hermits so much, we've decided to start our own series! Thanks for all you've done.
Make a waterfall running through all the farms
Iron golems are the scariest mob. You can't argue until you have had that thing charging at you for a mob behind you. PURE FEAR.
whats the bet that scars second mining session was in grian and joels chests
The irrigation sounds great it would look amazing in the farm maybe add leaves hanging
Use F to swap items between main and offhand quickly
skeleton
Scar just for your info grian may or may not have killed the ender dragon already
Scar, you've been playing minecraft for years and I've been watching you for a few of them. But, there's one thing that I always thought "he is going to learn soon" but... Yeah...  So, here it goes: whenever attacking a mob, take a step back while hitting, not forwards. That way the zombies, wither skeletons, piglins, etc, can't hit you. Your sword has more than half a block of reach, dude.  Good luck on your hardcore series!
For all that is holy please scar build a actual safe pond fully under your base. You can even make it a aquarium or something if it needs to be a build. My heart cannot handle this base
Imagine if he died at the end of the vid
My heart can't handle watching this.
Please make a water slide / waterfall under your base just in case you fall you fall to safety <3
im sorry scar.. "MINDCRAFT"?!
Witches are hands down the scariest mob to me
Make more jelli plushies
An axolotl aquarium built into the cliff would look amazing!
Genius w/ Scar
You'll play in java or bed rock
Episode 2?
Out of everyone's building style, scar's steampunk builds are my favorite
I would love to see you make some sort of tavern or maybe the head of  a dragon peeking out of a hole in the cliff wall.
Nemo's brother is my favorite character
well that was heart attacks after heart attacks.
What's the Seed?
There was a diamond in the cave, check 11:45 😭😂
Hey! I have an idea for your farms , I was thinking maybe you could make mushroom platforms and put your crops on them!
A waterfall that goes over the cave path between the farms and the bridge to the house might look good, and adds the benefit of something to land in at the bottom if you fall off.
A cave full of  grandfather clocks and other types of clocks would be cool 😁💖
The most laid back 100 hour challenge.  This I shall vibe with.
Scariest mob:: Baby zombie. hands down.
Put stares alongside the farms
Creepers are hardcore world enders in my opinion
after watching this episode I contemplate everything I know about scar always dying in Minecraft just wants him to fail but scar never gives up👌👊💪but u came in so clutch with landing in the water when u ran from the drowns
Calling it here that scar will die from jumping off of his plank
Why don't you make timelapses
The new base, for some reason, really reminds me of the old Scarland.
Skeletons are the most annoying for me
Watching Scar play hardcore is so stressful! It's fantastic!
"Great. Now that you're my friend, *kill this man."*
Scar, if you place down your jukebox in the meadow biome, if you don't know it is the biome  with lots of flowers, but has tagia looking grass. When you place it down and play a disc, you get an advancement. :P
10:54 I thought was the end
10:53 I thought was the end
good to know that if he somehow dodges his inevitable fall off his base then we can count on the unavoidable small miss-click on his floor to send him to his impending doom
Hi Scar! Others may have pointed this out, but a couple of easy ways to fall-proof your base (without pouring water everywhere) are berry bushes and powdered snow. Both will eliminate fall damage from any height. Placing carpet over powdered snow will even prevent you from sinking into it or taking cold damage. :)
I run at creepers fear me
i had a literal anxiety attack watching this
I’m gonna be really surprised if Scar actually survives the whole 100 hours
PLEASE make a house for your cats!
"OOoooooOOhhhHH no! I've killed the man!....Maybe I get his enchanter!"
copper oxidizes faster if you rapidly push and pull it with a piston.
I almost had an heart attack with that jump of the plank..
Scar at three hearts: Are you okay, boy? *feeds dog instead of himself*
Please make a giant bridge crossing the gorge
He says ‘... It’s in my nature.”
Every scene, I’m literally like “how did you survive?”
Dude! I'm die of a heart attack watch this... 🙈🙉🙊
I think one of two things gonna happen. Scar will win hardcore or he will die falling off his base.
The terrible British accent mocking Grian really got me lol! This series is so great so far, I hope you live long enough to make it last! Love you Scar <3
most stressful hardcore series ever
some of the folks on the SMP I'm part of are also fans, and we're all so proud of you, Scar! <3 I believe in you! 100 hours!!
Yes
Looking good.
I miss the build time lapses. Didn’t know how much until now. I really hope Scar finds a way to allow them to happen.   I just love seeing the progression of his builds. And it helps me understand and see how he was able to build everything so that i can build them or something inspired by it easier
All of nemo’s brothers and sisters died. 18:00
those babylonian farms look really cool
scar- no scar-  noooooo dont go off the edgee  wait-
I give scare till episode 3 before he dies cause episodes 1 and 2 failed to do so but the third times the charm lol 😂 hey scare maybe add a spiral staircase all the way down to bedrock inside your base and in the center at the bottom add a block of water so that you can just mlg it down the stairs then just walk back up your doing great buddy
the amount of times i thought that scar’s series was going to be done today
Awesome, just awesome.
scar almost died 10 times and it's only half way in.
scar, the bringer of heart attacks
11:44 when scar water elevators into the cave, he misses some diamonds!!! Top left of screen!
Hi
Your not going to survive 100 hours
Dude, you look death in the face and just laugh it off.
Scar, i love the base it. Looks amazing. Keep up the good work😁
I think it would be an interesting story if the buildings on the cliffside  were built on land and then the landslide that made the ravine under you fell from under the houses. Luckily, as the people living there noticed the cliff start to crumble, they tied the house to the tree that holds it up now
scar you are not going to survrive pls dont do stupid things
a silhouette of your base hanging off the tree would make a great t-shirt/sticker design!
HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD???
creeper by far, in a hardcore world had full hp, full protection 4 armor, a shield, and full netherite gear and a creeper fell on my head in a ravine and blew me up one shot. one shot.  i had no time to react it was bad!
I don't know why but I really just want there to be a dinosaur by your base. Like maybe pressing down on the hanging tree or guarding the mines and/or farms or something. Idk i just get a dinosaur vibe. Plus you could sing the Jurassic Park as you build it.
Scar: You can't disturb a man while he's eating an apple Grian and Joel: I'll pretend I didn't see that
10:50
Scar= Shoes and a hat Minecraft= Boots and a helment
The poor little cow got hit!🐮😥
Throws bread at pillagers 😂
skellies
21:05 if get it well you are as single as I am
My swaggon merch just came in!
You didnt die. But you did slaughter the jurassic park theme...
If Scar can survive more than 10 minutes in Minecraft hardcore I can actually build a house and not live next my xp farm
sacr you missed an abandoned mineshaft above you when when you got that one diamond the deepslate cave
Scar carving in the mountain someday with the all the pets being part of it too. Maybe add a large group of carvings on a different mountain for all the players of the 100 hours hardcore series.
"it looks like an egg!"  why, in EVERY minecraft series, grian is the egg man?
"I am now holding my meat" -Scar
I fear endermen. Y’all convinced me to start my own hardcore world. Was about 8 hrs in caving. Looking around a cave and looked directly into the eyes of a endermen. The horror I felt. I knew it was over I had no where to run in that open cave in iron armor.
Please Scar, when you fight a skeleton or a trident drowned and you have your shield, don't just sit there, you gotta charge in. Right after they shoot they have to reload, use that time to get closer, get the shield up for the next arrow, repeat until you're close enough to hit. Also, use an axe when fighting together with your dog so the sweeping edge doesn't get him.
Its Hammond in juarrassic park not ham
This is the best mountain base I've ever seen
10:15 places for our WHAT!?           I know he said portal
I fear cave spider. ended my hardcore world. Wasn't careful. Be careful.
HOW is he still alive? Scar, you are so lucky! I believe that you are not going to die in this series! You have this, man!
Definitely creeper
I fear creepers the most!!!
honely i think a berry boosh is gonna kill him LOL
You could mess around with Grian and move objects in his base to other locations. That could get him confused, which would be funny.
Scar: OH NO he's dead! 2 seconds later: do I get his villagers?
14:06 "Now you're my friend, go kill this man." HAHHAHAHA
You gotta do like a little sWiMmİnG  -Scar 2022
Maybe change the bridge to your house look more like a rope bridge?
i love watching grian and yalls vids on this series
17:30 Dude, put some blocks on your inventory!
Hmm, I think probably creeps, cause their always such a pain to take care of. But both suck
#39 on trending!!!!!!! Congrats!!!
Scar is giving everyone anxiety by making his base in literally the worst place during a hardcore world. Also I love the farm design and will probably use it myself.
I fear baby zombies most! And keep up the good content
Had to take my kiddo to the PICC team and we were thinking of and praying for you. You are such a hero to medical kids, Scar. Big hugs for you and Jellie
Scar, my dear, you are the only person I know who would make Hardcore a million times more hardcore than it could have been. One hour for you is like twenty for anyone else!  “I love danger!” Hahaha!  You make us laugh so much!
This video is soooo bad for my anxiety
Skeletons are far worse than creepers. Creepers are annoying. Skellys are dangerous.  Also this man is not going to make it past episode 3 at the rate that this is going.
Feather falling please I beg u
Someone pls do a near death count
I've never more anxious in my life and I have an anxiety disorder
Can we start a counter on how many times Scar almost dies?
The walking the plank thing  You mean the plank?
Creepers are the worst mob no dought
Scar you’ve gotta stop jumping off high places you give me far too much anxiety
"Who would've thought the arch enemy of this series would be a berry bush?"  Dude, the arch enemies of season 7 were pandas
Can we get the seed?
Nothing stresses me out more than seeing Scar trying to survive in a hardcore world
17:20 This was the Scariest hardcore near death experience i have ever seen 💀
Scar, carpeting on berry bushes keep you from the pokes.
Scar every time you jump off that plank my heart just drops
10:56 bruh....
15:37 Look at that gorgeous sunset!
Grian at 8 hearts: I legit almost died right there. Whew, give me a minute to catch my breath. Scar at 2 hearts and almost starved: *Jumps toward skeletons*
There were so many close calls in this episode!
baby zombie is pure danger I fear for my life every day due to baby zombies
Make the cliff opposite your plank into Mount Rushmore except it's you, Grian, and Joel.
21.05   SCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love you Scarrrrrr <3
It is so stressful to watch scar constantly get down to 2 hearts
The one time when scar dying won't be funny😂
my heart runs 1000miles an hour whenever scars walks tat plank lol
Maybe make a deal with Grian for a feather falling book. You need it.
Creepers are the iconic Minecraft threat, but Skeletons were always the most dangerous in my eye cause they got range and that is terrifying. Then if they are on a spider it gets even worse cause they gain mobility
Scar you are such an incredible builder, and I love your base it looks amazing.
I can’t even! These builds are amazing! Also, my heart - you caving is the most stressful yet fun clips!
I find the enderman the scariest.. the amount of damage they do is crazy!
Scar you should do dis for your next episode you should make something from star wars
Out of the mobs I fear, I have to say the one I fear the most is the wither because I play on bedrock
Watching scar do hardcore is an anxiety nightmare.
this house is werrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
He found TWO invisible spiders AT THE SAME TIME.
Scar maybe you can use the leaves of the blossoming azlia trees maybe that could look good for those flower beds
Scar why? I got like- atleast 5 heart attacks  Also love this!
It would look really cool if for the farms you had water flowing through the levels to water the plants
In case this hasn't been directly addressed yet (haven't seen the episode yet)...  If you find enough powdered snow, then you could cover the floor under the base with it and put moss- and regular green carpets there for texturing. That way, you won't take fall-damage _if_ you fall off your base (regular carpets work, mossy-carpets _should_ work too)
Wither skeleton in full enchanted netherite armor with netherite sword
Yo HOOOO! Your base is coming along so nicely Scar! I love the way you took advantage of the biomes around you, but I love even more how dangerously you play--literally living on the edge every single episode. Grian's definitely has a better balance of fashion and function, but your sense of style always shines brightest. I'm so glad you two are doing the series with each other; you work so well together and you certainly bring the drama. I don't know anybody who's recorded while fighting off three tridents! Keep working hard and having fun, okay mate?
I swear sometimes scar gives me anxiety when he jumps from high places in f3
I am genuinely so proud of Scar for lasting this long.
Scar my heart can't handle this, the number of times you almost died made my hair go white.
When i first saw grian complain about the drowned trident spawn rates i thought it was because of the giant deep lake he build his base at. Now looking at scar's encounter i take my words back.
This has been the best to watch because scar is me trying to avoid death😂😭
That’s the scenario when you dig down 3 blocks and cover your head
The entire minecraft world is just trying to kill him
Me a new subscriber watching this man play hardcore: *panik* *calm* *panik*
for the farms on the side of the mountain maybe a waterfall would look cool
Dont listen to grian we r all beliving that u can make it!
I think Scar is doomed tbh.
Creepers (in my opinion) are terrifying. They dont make any noise and they just come out of nowhere
omg that reverse camera jump... :O
I never used to, but I now fear creepers after one wandered up behind me and ended my hardcore world
"Infrastructure day" Man scar really is making more adult jokes lately. First the double entendres and now a political joke!
Thanks for
I love how scar says “HARDCORE!”
Ok I'm subbing BC U keep stilling he's thing
He just loves taking the risc
Sure
Man can’t last 2 minutes on hermitcraft without dying, but somehow is a walking totem of undying in this challenge 😂😂😂😂
Love this sereies so good
21:05 me too scar, me too
that jump blind one short on the diving board gave me such anxiety pepe laugh
Skeletons always jumpscare me
Get elytra pls
Scar u should do a Collab build with big beans
Scar can you make it so there is a broken dam between the 2 mounten's? So that if you fall, you fall in the water!
21:04 you are holding your what scar?
I love cliff bases and yours is so beautiful it made me tear up! i'm glad you survived this long scar, and here's to your longevity on this server!
a giant hanging plant
Also steal grian's villagers, he said he don't want the extra, you can use if for totem
Use glow berry for lighting not only they are good for lighting but also you also get healing when you need it.
I am just saying scar will die by jumping from his home
Scar at this rate your gonna get carried throuout the series and not get to experience the best part of hardcore the bosses and the elytra collection
First thing scar should do next episode is get feather falling IV cause my heart can only take this much XD
Ok heres a build suggestion make the clear the ground and make it one giant lagoon or circualr lake where your jumping cuz we want to see you acctually complete the 100hours aslo you should light up the water my adding lanturns under lilypads so the drowned situation doesnt happen ever again
14:05 "Now you're my friend. Kill this man." Said in that neutral voice again XD
We love you scar 💕

Scar has got to be one of the loveliest people. I am consistently surprised by him, I for sure figured he would die in episode 1.
I would love to see you at least last longer than Grain, even if neither of you make it to 100 hours

I dislike creepers more because they blow up you house
Ooof! Man, how could you do that to me?! It felt like I died a thousend times just by watching this video! 😅 Concrats on surviving this episode though, from now on it should go uphill (right?)
I'm on the edge of my seat!! #GetTo100
fricking heck even though i know there's more episode runtime left, this is still STRESSFUL to watch xD
We believe in You Scar!!!!!!  You can do this!!!!! 100 hours let’s go!!!!
I fear the bedrock wither
scar when you are fighting a ranged mob with a shield you need to go closer to them not farther
Can we just admire for a second that Scar is on the first page of Youtube Trending?
The mob that I'm the most scared of in Minecraft - is GoodTimesWithScar.
Scar if you die you just have to rejoin the server and start a new hardcore spontaneously moving into your old base but changing your skin to something ever more interesting
the one with the dionsaures xD
With Scar every skeleton feels like a raid boss
The mob i fear most is the infamous Grian, who may end your hardcore series just to scare you. Also the infamous Scar, who will steal your enchanting table no matter what.
Shelton scar
The tree is going to get struck by lightning, because you use lightningrods every where, use chains instead😊
10:23 I saw something on the horizon fly up into the air and immediately thought "moon big" pretty sure it was just a bee though lol
While it is always hilarious to watch him constantly be one step away from certain death, I don't know how much more my poor heart can handle. The new base looks great though!
Branch mine
Near death at 10:55😬
One of these episodes he will do his outro like that and hit the ground
This is so stressful
i cant imagine if one day the tree just catapult the house for overweight
"you cant attack a man while he is eating an apple!!"  Rendog: "wait that's grian!"
When there's multiple Trident throwers like that, (and also with pillagers), move so that one is in the middle, and the one behind will hit the middle guy. Three, sometimes they line up, but sometimes you gotta time your escape
The base does look fabulous. How about you use glowfroot you found in that lush cave, while running from the drowns, and make the lush pathway
Just a innocent mildly violent Theif...
Creepers are the worst in big caves cuz they can fall on you and kill you before you can get your shield up. The worst mob of all mobs is the trident drowned. (Mainly cuz I don't have any water enchantments so it's veeeeery slow going to end them)
Scar  In hermitcraft only Deaths  In hadcore Minecraft on death will cost alot
Hardcore wants this man dead, but somehow he's alive.
Despite my comments on these videos about the anxiety inducing near death situations, this series is ruddy fantastic, Scar, great job! 😄
These videos need to come with a warning for anyone with high blood pressure! 😳
I always love it when Scar says “haRdcOre minecraft” :)
The ironic thing is when scar says he is gonna die which he say that every single time, he never dies but when he says hes not gonna die he dies
I LOVE the Hardcoreseries, keep it up for multiple seasons
If scar had a superhero name it would probably be Plot Armor Man
Does anyone else hear those sounds in the background of scar's mic?
Oh gosh soo much anxiety inducing in this episode
This is fake I can’t believe he survived this long
can someone make a compilation of scar almost dying??
Scar's hardcore series is 100% going to end because he jumped off that plank and missed one day lol
10 episode season?
2:35 “cue the Batman music” Not sure what I was expecting, but it had a spinning screen and cheesy 60’s sounds 🤓🤣😂
make the house a bird house
If Scar makes it the full 100 hours here then he'll end up yeeting himself into the ground episode 1 of Hermitcraft season 9 just so he can feel like himself again.
10:54 that just means this series was meant to be~  though... everything that's happened says you're in for a ride 😅  12:04 12:39 12:55 13:25 14:14 16:30
I love you and attached your face in the cliff off the mountain 🙏
21:05 You’re doing what!?
I'd say that the mob that scares me the most normally (of consistently spawning mobs anyway) id definitely say creeper, but for hard-core baby zombie all the way
I was enjoying this video very much until i heard you utter the words "hey we found nemo and his brother" this comment while creative is factually unfalse in it's statement. At the beginning of the movie Finding Nemo all of Nemo's siblings are brutally murdered and killed by a fierce barracuda. Because of this it is impossible for Nemo to have a brother swiming in the ocean with him since they were all eaten as eggs.      Nice vid, thanks
I shed a tear when super fast build mode ended
Personally I fear , ghasts and wither skeletons
the mob i'm most scared of is a baby zombie
I mean, he's a quarter of the way done.
Scar is without a doubt one of the worst Minecraft players ever 🤣🤣🤣💜💜💜
This series isn't doing my anxiety any favors.
I didn't know I could be so stressed watching a minecraft video but Scar has proven me wrong :)
Scar PLEASE make a expanded part of the river below your base so you will just fall into water you could change that part from being a mountain to climb to a slight overhanging cliff to even remove the change of falling down the mountain.
Scar somehow last 2 million hours
Scar! My heart, it can't take this!
My god man, you are such an amazing builder it's just ridiculous.
Love your original builds Scar. Best of luck. Be the last one to die.
Scar, try using the Lilac flower with your build. It goes well with fully oxidized copper
21:05      Thank me later
Omg i nearly lagged out of existence at 11:00
make your house a hanging bridge from cliff to cliff.
Wither skeletons
3378 comments and counting, so nobody's ever going to see this one, but wow are those terraced fields charming my socks off!!!  Can't wait 'til you're happy with them, and show them off, Scar!
A little crack. Some meth
Your videos make me feel better after a bad day and always give me a laugh. And calm me down when I can’t sleep. Thank you
You can do this brother! No fear just exciting decisions ahead
Instead of Jurassic Park music when you enter a cave you should do Indiana Jones
Oh my goodness, the cliffside builds are so cool!
Honestly not sure if I can keep watching. Calm down Scar, Jiminy Christmas so stressful.
Scar I'm loving this but man you know how too give us heart attacks
Sees title… IMPOSSIBLE!!        I’m glad you made it :)
That one time Scar jumped off the tree into the water not ONE BLOCK away from land and certain death. I thought my heart would come out of my chest…. 10:47
I'm only half way through the episode while writing this comment and the amount of times I've screamed or gasped in fear that you were a gonna..... You can't do this to me Scar XD
Scar your giving me anxiety.
What happened to the dog
You always make me smile when I need it. Sick in bed, I can't do what I used to but watching you makes me feel like a kid again. Miss the super fast build mode tho. 😢 Time lapses are the best!
The fact that Scar took a moment to _remember_ the name Jurassic Park... I took that _personally._
creeper definitely, they can one shot you, can mostly take at least one hit from a skeleton.
I would suggest the name "Light Blighttown"
I don't think he's surviving next episode
boy
Lol oh dear the boat off the plank
Jesus man I had anxiety stress for like 20 minutes straight
The most tense 25 minutes of my life! Anyways, very nice job on this episode and I can't wait to see how this goes in the future :) Also, your Grian accent is superb.
If scar ever gets an elytra the series goes bye bye
Skeletons, they always catch me off guard and end my Hardcore Series
I love how Grian and Joel just left Scar and went to the end!!!:(
Anyone else love scars hardcore series so far? One of my favorite things on YouTube right now. Love you man!
Ur awsome I love you I’ve watched you for ages so I made an. Account just to sub to you keep up the good work
Just make the mines of mores from the lord of the rings
SCAR! I just thought you should know that hitting F3 + H turns on advanced tooltips and will show you the durability on your armor and tools so you know how many more hits your stuff can take :)
Ok i need that seed man, it's sooo gorgeous
Love you Scar but I gotta let ya know that I can hear your computer fans in the background. (I'm assuming it's the computer fans)
I greatly enjoy all the long time players that think diamonds spawn the same way in caves. If If the diamond is touching an air block it is more likely to just be a vein of 1.
I desperately need to see philza Minecraft react to scar playing hardcore
Scar got plot armour
Everything he does gives me a heart attack. In fact, I’d say he even scarred me for life
How scar survived a triple trident attack in iron amour I will never know!
Scar, pleeeeaassee ADD RAILING!! The near misses are sooooooo scary to watch!
10:54 i do not like how close he was to landing on the ground instead of the water... jesus, scar...
It looks beautiful
This episode. This is why the "Did a bit of off camera building" meme is a thing
Could you run an autoclicker on the spectator account?
10.50 scar can you not give me a heart attck?? <3
Every waking moment is chaos
If you plan on expanding your base, I think it would be really cool if you had like floating pods or something that were connected by rope bridges. I also love this new series! I think you'll make it to hour 30, 40 if your lucky. lol
Grian and Joel: "How are you not dead?!" Scar: "I have no idea!"
You’re welcome just don’t die do you llama
Ok, just find ouy that my heart is very, very healthy. Thank you for the exam Dr. Scar, M.D.
Love Scar!  Keep adventurin!
creeper because + with selaton is death
I bet Scar makes it 48 hours near to the dot, and his demise will be Just Barely missing the water
CREEEEEEEPER!!!!
I had 50 heart attacks in the past 20 minutes
This hardcore world is out to get scar😂
Scar I know you asked this last episode, but I think your superpower might be good luck
Magma cubes are my hardcore enders
Scar replace your floor with barrels PLEASE
Scar: oh we found Nemo.. and his brother!  Me:   ….  All of Nemo’s brothers and sisters died…. Before they were even born..😕
Im calling it the bush is gonna get him
when youre fighting mobs with ranged attacks like skeletons or drowned with tridents, they shoot/throw at a set interval, so if you time your shield and attack so you drop your shield for just barely long enough to hit them, then bring your shield back up a half second before they shoot you, you can kill them without taking any damage
I love you too baby girl ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I *want* Scar to succeed... But I don't think he will :P
Scar I absolutely love your tree house base!!!! Very cool! I'm shocked your still alive after the drown/trident incident but really glad you are.  Your such a crazy daredevil and I almost feel like I'm on a ride watching you. Very fun!!!  Oh and stealing the enchanter was classic!
7:12 Scar: Were you killed? Grian: Sadly yes... Scar: Can I have his villagers? Grian: But I lived!
scars on trending!!!
Given the amount of scares he gives us I don’t think he will make it very far.
Axolotl kill drowned
I haven't watched this yet so sorry if u named ur cat already I commented a name on episode one then I saw u had episode two up but please please name your cat Tammi
Scar you can feed you dog rotten flesh
19hrs 14mins 50sec into the run and he said some choice words
Take half of Grian's villagers
scar i had so many heart attacks
If you had a good eye you would notice that there is a privileger behind scars new build house that he made at 20:19
Me, excited for Superfast Build Mode Server, kicks BadTimesWithScar account Me, DUUDE. You threw off my GROOVE!
GoodVibesWithScar
Noce
what a ride
How cool would it be if you added giant roots coming in and out of the cliff from the tree? Everything looks amazing Scar!
i swear to god this series is going to kill me before it kills scar
Amazing building but the stress of you throwing yourself at danger is horrible XDDD  Love the series and how you all have different priorities : D and play styles ^^
my bet would be that scar dies randomly at hour 99 or so
Please STOP jumping from your treehouse!! Or this project well end far to early.... P.S.: Really like the look of your base!🤩
Watching Scar in hardcore is the most anxiety inducing thing. EVER. I still can't wait for the next episode haha
get a jellie cat
Hope everyone reading this has better day
I think of scar has the ability to survive three tridents in the face and make it to 20 hours then he can totally get to 100 hours
Cannot believe you made it through! Love the series and you of course. Thanks for providing such great entertainment.
scar every time you jump off the plank i swear my lifespan is shortened ten years The new house looks great tho! It definitely fits better with the tree than the platform did. Not that the platform was terrible—the new house just feels more natural :) I can't wait to see what sort of designs you have in mind for a nether portal for this build! but for the love of everything please remember to eat because my guy you will perish without food
Where’d the dog go after the Timelapse
10:54 WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT I HAD A HEART ATTACK WATCHING IT
Guys Scar is the greatest minecraft youtuber ive ever watched, i can't believe he's not  a 10 mil because he deserves it. can we spam a famous youtubers comments to shout Scar out (such as Mr beast.)
The worst mob ever are baby zombies. Especially when they just drop out of no where.  Also, your base reminds me of the little village on the film "The time machine", but the newer version of the film.  It would be cool if you continued your base to be something like that but a scar version.  Also you had my heart pumping through that. Im so glad the morlocks, I mean drowned, didn't end the series. I honestly thought they had you.
you should make a  cliffside house for villagers
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
10:50 😳idk how you where so serious when talking
Grian: did you say enchanting? Scar: DiD yOu SAy enChANtiNG?
I bet scars guna dye next epersode falling of his plank
Gust saying you can still trap people.  Hopefully I didn't start a war.
Scar really needs to rename this series "Giving my fans anxiety for 100 hours."
Nice
this episode has taught me something about Scar. He is not good at Minecraft, but extreaaamly lucky
Axolotols  are Not Evil
Enderman
@buildidea you could have a bridge that goes across the water and build up on the other side a villager trading hall but i can imagen that you would build along the mountain edge as you slowly get closer to groins base
I don't know if i've ever seen someone be so unlucky AND so lucky all at the same time lmao!  GG on surviving all of THAT, Scar xD Great episode  Edit: I also LOVE the new build 😍👌
Baby Zombie Because They So Fast And Can Fit Through One Block
Scar is the most entertaining in this series
I don't think I'm going to survive this series... 😬  Also, "Now you are my friend! Go kill this man!"
Grians and smallishs episodes are really relaxing whilst scars is a stressfull thriller battle for life😂😂❤
I BELIEVE IN YOU BIG MAN SCARRRRR
I truly hope scar lasts the longest but oh my gosh this is stressful watching him jumping off cliffs and getting attacked by three hecking trident wielding drowned
Y: -58 is the best for diamond mining if you need some bling scar, caves arnt as efficient anymore because the vein sizes decrease when generating exposed to air blocks.
Only about 6% of drowned spawn with a trident, so for Scar to face three of them at the same time is about a .000216% chance.
Watching Scar play Hardcore Minecraft is a workout for my heart!
congrats on trending!
whats funny is nemos brother is dead
12:56 What?
Btw, it would be really cool if you could make some roots coming off the cliff just under the tree :)
The new base is STUNNING!!! :0
I think Scar is trying to live this hardcore life as dangerous as possible.... this video is giving me anxiety
WHEN DID MINECRAFT BECOME SO STRESSFUL!!!!
If scar survives this whole series, it will just be because the mobs stop attacking him out of courtesy when not if he does not realize he is on 2 hearts.
Scar please get diamond armor, you give me a heart attack every 5 minutes. Love the videos and thanks for making them
I hold my breath every time scar plays on this world
I love scar's reaction to grian dying. priceless.
Awe man, I just started playing in my first ever hardcore world but I’m sick and too afraid to play in it right now. What if I sneeze and accidentally jump off a cliff? Can’t have that happening! This series is really nice in the meantime though while I wait on recovery :D
Scar's impression of Grian using the british accent is my new favorite thing
I want to be positive and supportive, but oh man this episode was a series of frights. Please eat more food Scar! We want to see you survive to the end :)
The amount of times I yelled "EAT" at my screen in this episode is astronomical.
"now your my friend... kill this man"
i have been at war with creepers for a decade. skeleton is a close second though
I feel after all this Scar will just be invincible, he’s like those characters in movies who are super clumsy and such but at the end of the movie they figure out there super powers and become really powerful. You guys get what I mean 😂
Suggestion for your farm: maybe try a border of spruce trapdoors against the crops
Types of headaches: Migraine. Hyper Tension. Stress. Sinus. Cluster. SCAR PLAYING MINECRAFT HARDCORE.
You should try getting all the music discs
Scar, why did you steal his enchanting table?
I like your new house but have you considered a hanging rope bridge connecting your home to the cliff instead of the one you currently have? I feel like it might fit the vibe of your build a bit more. Also I love the mine tracks
You stress me out so much! Please! Stop jumping for high places!
I have never been so stressed out
U should get elytra like Grian
Honestly, this episode feels like those cartoons where you see a character just walking into deadly scenarios and somehow narrowly avoiding death at each obstacle. Anyone else feel like that?
grian and joel on 9 hearts: THAT WAS SO CLOSE, IM LITERALLY ALMOST _DEAD_  scar on two hearts: well, lookie here! it seems like i've been impaled!
the mob i fear the most is endermen :D
GG Scar you gotten real good at not dying!!
When you say "How'd I Survive This?" I was expecting a moment where we asked it. Not literally 20 the entire episode! LOL so fun, keep it up!
Watching Scar doing a hardcore serie is giving me anxiety
Oh gosh you this video woke me up. 😂
I didn't know i had anxiety until now
I fear magma cubes more than the ender dragon
Scar did better than grian on trending lol
Honestly I want you to stop jumping off cliffs, I really want to see you make it to 100hours
no way this guy isnt dying next episode
I would like to leave this area with my head still on my head
I'm not sure my heart can handle watching more of you in this series, jumping of your tree house, 3 tridents, water caves without exits, come on dude, take it easy :) :P
scar you need to find jelly
It is SO stressful to watch you play Scar
God this series is not good for my health... I love it!
This is just practice for another last life series, he seeks vengeance...
Buy armor from Grian’s villagers!
When he went to build the house its like that one meme when the youtuber says there going to do something small and then when they come back on they've made like a entire mansion lol
Baby Zombie, deals damage yet hard to hit
Boo
Scar (wholesomely) giving his viewers panic attacks every 10 seconds in this hardcore series
Can we just appreciate Scar's impression on Grian "Did you say Enchanting?"  I was laughing so hard when i saw this lol
Man I was so ready to vibe out to the super fast build music again, that was such a disappointment. Hope it gets fixed soon, that music is my jam.   I'm really delighted to see how far you've come, Scar. It's really impressive. I hope you make it to 100 hours!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.
Scar is the real Stressmonster 😨😂
I feel like Scar is doing it on purpose 🤣
Probably make the river under your base into a lake
Scar uploads a new video: Kalm  Scar doesn't say "Hello my fellow miners and crafters": Panic!
Grian and smallishbean..Make simple bases that have a low chance of death. Scar the king of death makes a high busy full of potential death spots. He loves to live life on the edge. I hope you make it to 100 hours scar.
i can't wait to see what you and the other hermits can come up with, with the new lighting mob spawning conditions.
Scar, swapping stuffs to your off hand is the f key
Creeper
Try to make a naval shipyard under the TREEBOAT and maybe add a crane?you know like a dry dock?
Scar there must be an angel looking after you and your character... im on the edge of my seat watching you do.....hard-core....
Congrats on trending dude! Frm India❤️
The pure joy I feel hearing the Super Fast Build Mode music
bruh sprint  and traveling with out a bed your just asking to die lmao
watching scar suffering in hardcore somehow annoying yet entertaining
Wow, this series is like the polar opposite of Impulse's Hardcore series :D
I always love your videos
Scar!!!! It is so scary everytime youre on the brink of death. Its honestly comparable to watching a horror movie.  I love that despite the struggle you manage to bring to life beautiful builds! <3 Im in love the the bird-house esque home hanging from the tree, and the farms look gorgeous like that on the edge of the cliff.  Everything youve done in this world so far has been wonderful! Clearly you have your priorities set straight.  Building pretty things > Better tools and armour anyday!  i support it haha
I'm sure that Scar killed some people with this episode.
Doc what have you done!!! Now that you said that all he does is jump off cliffs!! Now every time he jumps I am literally holding my breath praying for his life!!!
I don't know how many times I have re-watched this episode at this point but I basically have it on repeat.... These episodes need a warning on them lol
❤️
even though it was cut short, I got so happy hearing super fast build mode for the first time this year <3
"i am now holdin my MEAT" -scar 2022
now that's how you play a hardcore series
skeleton
Who thinks Scar is going to be done in by that plank?
What’s the seed for this world?
10:53 O_O
Most impressive  But please, don't fight any more skeletons and spiders while at 2 hearts It's not good for my 1 heart
My cheeks were clenched for 90% of the episode. 😰
Scar, please increase the amount of water under your base.
Scar, loved both the videos!! Great job. Also, *wow* that was very lucky when the Hawkeye was gonna kill you and you fell in that hole and there was water and there was a beautiful lush cave 😍.
How about you turn letter way to water lif
my poor heart cannot
What would really be cool is if he added sap leaking from the tree all down the cliff, so when he falls he has some chance of surviving the fall. If he hits one of the honey blocks.
Scar you need a windmill!!! Being in a valley like that means wind cuts through a lot! You can you that to include the idea of using wind electricity to power every thing
piglin brutes are the worst mobs
Scar you should prank Grian so when he goes through his nether portal it looks like he is still in the over world and gets really confused.
It looks so cool! Terrifying but cool! Also please for the love of all that’s holy, carry an extra shield with you. And put some railings on the path. I am a fall hazard so I always have railings. Usually.
Scar...the amount of times you almost died made me so anxious.  I am thoroughly impressed by your ability to get out of tough situations though!
Omg the build... It is amazing. Never seen anything so gorgeous. Love it.
11:00 scar!! You cant do that lol!! I really like your contents, but these moments are very scary XD
I really love your videos
Scar make a waterflow flowing down from the top of the farm to the bottom
Spiders... Poisonous spiders are the worst.
Thanks!
Gorgeous builds!
Why are you trying to give us all heart attacks, Scar? Staph! For the love of all that is good, STAPH! XD
Scar videos without super fast build mode feels naked
I think you can survive 100 hours, scar!
I’m filled with delight with the mental image of a dude breaking into his friend’s garden, stealing wheat, making bread, going back home and just yeeting one of his fruits of thievery at an evil man with a crossbow.
"Is this what it's called, the 'walking the plank thing'?" Some might dare call that: "the plank". Scar, you are incredible.
You asked what mob I fear the most?  Kinda an obscure one, but as a hardcore player also, Vexes are the absolute worst.
Me on the previous episode: i think scar it's gonna make it, when he want he can be careful Scar: *jumps of the cliff being 1 block away from dying.  Well scar, you like make me see like a fool
Fallen tree to cross from one mountain to the other?
Endermen are the worst. I've seen them end two hardcore series'. Also the sounds freak me out.
.
Scar, on behalf of literally every one, REMOVE THE LAND UNDER YOUR TREE
You are gonna make the 100 hours. I beleve in you
21:03 “What have I done with my hot bar? I’m now holding my meaat With my axe in my offhand”
Scar I still haven’t gotten my merch I bought it like 2 weeks before Christmas 😭😭😭😭
scars gona die by forgeting to hold shift when he walks up ont he plank.
11:08 You look like you are reading a magazine while sitting on the toilet.  LOL
You, sir, are a madman!
You gave me a heart attack when u jumped without looking 😂
wow! harrowing to watch you come so close to ending your 100days with twin tridents!.. or were there 3 of them? knowing from exp in mc, just one would take me out! and the cliff dives! omgosh!  your builds are totally awesome and inspiring as well! a cliff dwellers paradise! terrific episode!
nice
"I am now holding my meat"  -Scar circa. 2022
The water u forgot the water by building scar, pls don't die xD
Is it just me or is watch scar a constant heartache!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I love how the timer show how much work is in this episode, some people forget how time consuming building in survival is. The base is impressive for Hardcore and i love it <3
Scar, please don't forget to wear your pants in hardcore series
I fear the phanthoms the most
Oh for God's sake, you really need to remove that islet below your base XD You're gonna fall for your death, if you don't replace it with water! :D
get grian's feather falling
If Scar get a elitra he will die in the next 1 minute m
"Now your my friend, kill this man"
good job m8, this is very nice build
Counting the amount of times scar nearly dies would make for a great drinking game:)
fun fact: if you don't move in sveet berry bushes, you won't take damage
Scar your head looks bare 🤨
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 scar watch out of those bushes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 and please survive the 100 hours I believe in you 💖
21:06  Holding your what Scar?
Scar: “Thank you for all the kind and positive comments”  Grian: “I didn’t see a single person who said I could do it”
The intense music whenevr Sar was close to death was an awesome touch (I heard the music every 5 secs lol)! BTW congrats for surving 2 whole episodes and good luck on the 100 hours!
Did he just find two spiders with invisibility at the same time?😳
Gonna miss the Timelapse’s
"Forgiveness is divine but never pay full price for late pizza" - Michelangelo Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Not me pretending to still be asleep so that I can watch this video…
The random things you see scar say and do. “Oh look it’s neon and he’s brother” that makes scar amazing.
Admit it! You also say "Hardcore" whenever Scar says "Hardcore"
Scar loves giving us anxiety and heart attacks by risking things 💀 💀 💀
Scar is really playing with his luck rn!
"I know I shouldn't be risking this but its in my nature"
scar pro tip use ( replay mod ) it will help u alot! btw love your vedios! : )
Maybe you could put some vines or greenery of some kind hanging from your terraced farms.
Scar: almost in dies the entire episode  Me after watching the episode: wait so he did not die !?  😂😅👍Keep it up dude
I love you, Scar, but seriously! My anxiety kicks up every time I watch this series, and you've only uploaded 2 episodes. At this rate, I'm gonna die before you do! Oh, my poor heart...
Scar,  I love watching your videos you give me a great chuckle when I need it,  keep up the great work.
19:40 - "The server kicks you if you are inactive for more than 5 minutes, so spectator account got kicked"  Couldn't you use an autoclicker or something to keep the spectator account "active"?
skeletons are worse im too used to do 180° shield block to them but how did you survive that lol how are you allways like just surviving like how
20:00 l love that quote !!!!
Scar needs some kind of resource pack that colors the border of his screen red if he's below 4 hearts or something
This gives even more anxiety that pewdiepie first starting hardcore
I can't say it doesn't make for good content but the amount of times I was like "welp that's the series over in just a minute" this episode was too much for me to handle!
Skeleton= eez  Creeper= big hole
Why is scar playing without hostile sound when caving??? Scar is taking hardcore to the next level
Scar I am incredibly stressed.
I definitely fear creepers the most. I can't tell you how many times I've died because I had sound off and a creeper fell down behind me and 1 shot me without me ever having known it was there or having a chance to stop it
Can yall bump my new song, its on my page and its straight gas ⛽
dear goodness, im gonna have to wait until i get a refill on my heart meds because the way you play hardcore gives me Way too much anxiety to watch and its causing me issues LMAO  seriously tho, good job staying alive thus far
Scar is the most entertaining in this series
I say wither skeleton or ravager
My son and I must have said, “Oh god, Scar, why?” at least a dozen times each during this episode. Thank you for palpitations.
please for the love of god, my stress and receding hair line cant take you jumping off things any more. get some feather falling boots I beg you.
The smile says it all
You need to find Jellie before you die! She is vital!!
oh my god! the difference between how this man plays hardcore minecraft from others... i cannot i'm stressed. love you, scar
10:54 What the heck he just casually jumped off???!!!!
21:05  Holdin what ???!!!
Two words, Baby Zombie.
You should put mini amethyst geodes into that path you made, along with some leaves and glow berries. I love your building styles too!!
Can we get scar a couple body guards for the server. Just so the triple tridents don't kill him
It would have been hilarious for Scar to survive all three trident throwers only to die to a berry bush. That being said, I'm rooting for you to make 100 hours.
How is he still alive?
I shouldn't be alive
I feel like Scar’s last life series is kinda like Milo’s Murphy’s Law lol
Calling it next episode is the last one
Action...emotion...thrill.....heart attack scaar missed nothing...
My anxiety this entire episode: 📈 📈 📈
Loving this base. But wow that was stressful to watch!
Me Every time scar jumps off the the plank: SAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!! 😨😱😱😱😱😱😰😰
I'm going to need therapy after this series XD
Everytime I look at this series, my eyes are like O.O he gonna do it, he gonna do it, oh no ohh OOOHHHH!!!! WATCH OUT WATCH OUT!!!!! AAAAHGHHHSFJHSKFSKFJ
It always makes me smile whenever people underestimate Scar. He's a showman, he's a clown and he's a stuntman - he knows what he is doing and how to completely hustle everyone else into thinking he is a bumbling accident waiting to happen. I'm certain he has every eventuality studied and calculated long before he enters into the situations which make us panic. A true entertainer at heart! 🖤
I legitimately thought Scar  was gonna die when the third Drowned showed up....man
May i suggest for your safety that you remove that strip of land under the house? The one separating the two pieces of water
You could make a waterfall that doubles as an elevator
If he posts a 6 minutes long video, i would know exactly what happened without even watching it
Fun idea:after 100 hr mark fight each other to the death
I fear creepers. Reason? Because they can can sneak up behind you without a sound and you just suddenly hear a sssssBOOOM sound from behind.
“Scalding cold water”  - Scar 2021
I cannot believe you are still alive. Stay safe Scar!
10:56 I was so scared
Every second of watching scar on hard core is a different heart attack
I love the fact I die just playing Minecraft, but Scar jumps off planks, gets into gun fights with skeletons, and gets cornered by trident wilding Drowns and SURVIVES!!  Keep doing what you do!! P.S It would be awesome to see some custom built ships in the water below your base!!
21:26 a little bit too carried away huh? A LITTLE BIT?!?!?!
Your builds never cease to amaze me!!!
You should've just dug down during the trident drowns
why every 10 seconds you almost die!?
But I think it would be really kool if you made a bridge to the other mountain and have it held up by a crashed plane in the mountain and chains in the rock. It's an idea
I would say that skeletons are scary in certain situation such as if you are near a cliff and can easily be shot off and fall whereas a creeper is terrifying in just about any scenario. So I'd say I'm more scared of Creepers in Minecraft.
The good luck ran out
Scar is really living on the "edge"
Is hermitcraft done?
"scalding cold water" lol
Haha This series is sick but I have a feeling it won't last long considering the way Scar just jumps off things without even looking
PLEASE STOP JUMPING OFF YOUR BASE ITS GOING TO GIVE US A HEART ATTACK AAAAA
You should try to get feather falling 4 diamonds boots, so a fall from your base isn't fatal.
Im dazed by the fact that he survived that. Also scar youre legit the best builder out there, the base looks phenomenal!
Please continue to live life on the edge! Riveting
Scar your personality is so lovely
Scar has plot armour without a Plot.
I fear imbecilic politicians that might cancel Minecraft the most, then creepers sneaking up on me (they always like blowing me off mountaintops or into ravines for some unknown reason!) and finally ghasts, who always blow me to smithereens just as I'm about to exit the nether through the portal. How did they get so good at breaking those?
I have been chased through the streets of Hong Kong by insane policemen firing tear gas and rubber bullets, and yet watching THIS was the most stressful thing I've ever done!
Scar.. can you just stop jumping so are hearts can rest? HAHAH
Scar be like: ohhh copper xD
I'm calling it now. He's gonna jump off the plank at some point, not go far enough and explode into a pile of inventory.
ngl i love how you're still keeping all ur aesthetics and stories in the builds, even in a series that is seen as like the least permanent type of gameplay. this base is beauttifuull, ive never thought about actually decking out the mines :0
Grian was talking about all the tridents but I didn’t realize how right he was until seeing those three attack scar at once
If I had a penny for every time scare had a near miss… it’s so scary
I can just imagine scar like I love minecraft, I love it so much btw that build was the first build i said out loud 'woah' to your a great builder scar-lett witch
This series is going to scarrrr me for life
this is anxiety inducing
Cant believe ur still alive
After all of the dieng from spawn to my base because my bed was occupied, skeletons, definitivly skeletons. you can run form creepers, you can run from zombies, you can avoid looking at enderman and you can run from chilldren and spiders, but there is no escaping the rogue arrow from the skeleton
creeper is the worst !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
skeletons - terror for hardcore creepers - terror for builders
Hey Scar! Great video and a s lil tip, instead of that little inventory shuffle you did at 21:10 you can just press F  :)
This episode was so stressful... and I loved it ! (but please be safe)
Mr beast should add scar’s hardcore series into a near death experiences video
12:01 the irony
Yesterday I literally had a weird dream (cuz I recently watched grian’s episode and he visited scar’s base) that scar died from a lightning bolt, and I was smallishbeans watching him die
Scar please be more careful. Get a horse or something don't try flying I want you to make it all the way good luck buddy
You call this good time with scar? You literally just jump off everytime you can. The whole video give me 10 heart attack not gonna lie😀
Scar, I would suggest feeding your dog zombie flesh when you want to heal him, that way you'll have more food for yourself (especially now, when you don't have a farm yet)
I thought a really cool idea would be a big bridge going over the river connecting the top of the two mountains and having a really big tree in the middle
I fear phantoms the most
Scar is the building king
I'm pretty sure Grian edited that out, but I just KNEW you would steal that enchanter while he was getting the diamond 🤣 And that 'favour' Grian gave you the diamond for sounds more like a friendship certificate than an IOU. Very intrigued where this is going to go lol
How did u not die. That was scary all way through🙈
I  didn't wanted to be rude but You stall grian's enchanter. YOU ARE A THIEF. JUST GIVE HIM IT BACK.
I recommend building a dock! Since you usually use the rivers to travel to Grian. Anyways, I am loving the builds on the side of the mountain! It feels dwarven and stuff
20:00 JANGO FETT????
Amazing episode! Laughed so hard and almost died when you jumped off that cliff 😂
I haven't tried this myself in minecraft but if you could build a waterfall and a pond with Lilly pads on it but under the Pond you have secret nether portal or even a secret entrance to an mythical enchanting room that would look amazing
Instead of walking the plank call it boating or rowing the plank
Omg I’m so glad you survived!!
What about connecting the gorge,  like you said but with a huge hammock like structure
Just beautiful, i wish i could build like this
This video is more thrilling than the marvel end game
Scar, feather falling boots and potions of slow falling I hope will increase your life expectancy. Later of course full enchanted netherite! Thanks for another beau-tiful and heart stopping episode! More beauty and less heart stopping in future episodes please, my heart can't take much more.
Grian: makes hardcore series  Scar: it’s free content  Lol
❤️
Play with safer in Minecraft
Oh please, scar, I literally get so anxious when watching you. Just remember you can dig into a wall or into the floor if you need to escape mobs, please 😭
What if you put your spectator account with an autoclicker or something similar, so it won't kick you out
Scar, you are giving me an heart attack everytime you jump of your base or do caving! ^^
you are an awesome builder dude...what an art of building you have..
remember that scar was a last life finalist
cave spiders are the worst
scar is not unlucky... he is a death magnet
scar pls have full prot 4 diamond armor and feather falling in your boots
the design of the minecart is SOOOO COOL! always love scar's build
I think a nice detail could be if you propped the farms or some other platform up on a sort of hemisphere, sort of like the eloi houses in the time machine
grian and joel: let's fight the enderdragon and get that purple armor. scar: let's build a huge base.
Who else said general kenobi in the beginning of the video
scar you can try a dead bush with a leaf on top for your flower pots - or try an actual flower in a pot!
Watching Scar play hardcore Minecraft is like watching a slightly clumsy kitten do parkour at the top of the Chrysler building
Hey scar  I found a baby yoga’s head shaped coffee mug at Asda
Awesome Scar! You need Villagers to tend your gardens for you… great base! You truly live on the edge! Meanwhile, gear up and go get yourself a trident 🔱
how to almost kill 1.5 million viewers from a video: 10:55
the building looks soooo good!!!!!
If anxiety itself recorded a YouTube video it wouldn't hurt me the way this one did.
“Eating my mutton like a good boy” had me chuckling, loving this series !
I am waaay too sick for all the heart attacks but holy heck congrats on surviving all those skeles! And the triple tridents o.O!
Scar makes our anxiety higher
I know people said they dont believe you but You can do it Scar, I know you can!!. Just dont play with the neighboors kids aka the creepers 😂
i love how scar change voice when he is in danger
I apologize for my statement last episode, the trapdoor floor will no longer be the death of you, distractions will... IN EPISODE 5 HOUR 59
scar keeps calling it a "beautiful gorge" but personally i like "gorge-ous"
There needs to be a waterfall in ur base
I can you surviving 100 hours and being the last one standing 😊
The hanging buildings attached to the mountain looks super cool!
SCAR WILL YOU PLEASE STOP JUMPING OFF CLIFS. MY HEART CAN TAKE THIS.
I fear the thing that is most likely to kill Scar is his own panic! Just being chased by something and in the panic accidentally jump in a hole or what not. So just take a deep breath and you got this! Clap you hands if you believe!
The most intense series yet. I am healthy but im sure that my heart stopped at least 4 times
this is the single most stressfull thing I've ever watched in my life
watching this makes markiplier playing FNAF feel like a nursery rhyme/song
10:54... scar i just about had a heartattck
I fear skeletons the most
We also ask you that scar, "How'd you survive this?" Lmaoo
You should probably stripmine for diamonds right above bedrock, for me that was the most efficient way to get them … also the triple drowned with tridents, that’s ridiculously unlucky
Why will you steal the enchanter? Its not like he won't let you enchant there. Scar still hasn't cooled down from Last Life I see, so much so that he has forgot co-operation is an option and its not like you will get bookshelves
I saw in grian's vedio , its a tree of terror of some sort
11:50 Oh DEFINITELY Creepers! They be sneaking and then BOOM! and death! Skeletons are just annoying because they will see a sliver of you and then BAM! arrow in the face, or because it's Minecraft somehow in the BOTTOM of your foot lol!
That jump was so clutch !!!!.
Obsessed with how a lush cave was a life saver for him
Episode 2 and both almost died from berry bushes.  That's going to leave a Scar
Please show us the montage of your mining session That would be fun to watch😄
Ohh I just notice we are so close to 2 mil🤯😄
the "walking the plank" thing is called The Plank lol
14:40 We’ll be right back
Having to clench my butt throughout this entire series has been great for my health...(and I really do enjoy this series)
Maybe cheat death a little less often? Lol! This is a selfish request, I confess, because I’d love to see more building. Your new house is unique and a delight for the eyes. If you do get sand and make glass panes, you can make water elevators that appear to be unconfined by using the panes stacked like the normal blocks….you enter the water column diagonally. Idk if a water elevator works to hydrate crops. It would be cool, if so.
Scar really should build a small river port with some old steamboats
In hardcore a creeper is more dangerous because you don’t have time to react unlike the skeleton you can use a shield or just escape.  Actually both mobs are dangerous.
I would love to see somebody in Pro MC utilize the lichen to its full potential. After all, it is a light source, and it can be farmed as mood lighting with a bit of bone meal and shears. Creepers are the worse mob to me, but then again, I NEVER play in hardcore. Oh, ask Skizzleman how he feels about sweet berry bushes, LOL.
Creepers are worst, because it destroys what you build even if you survive. Especially when you build things with Villagers and suddenly they escape because a creeper blew up the containment. I tend to build fences all around my "construction sites" now...
Shulkers... legit the End scares me more than the Nether.
I have never been so stressed in my life.
your base looks amazing, lovin’ the details so much!! especially the spore blossoms under your house💗💗
Floating islands would look cool maybe
In the words of Grian:  "My heart, my poor little heart!"  I can't remember when he said this but it was basically the entire episode in a nutshell.
Witches and endermen are the scariest mob
A bit BORING!
Scar please be more careful, I'm going to be the one dying with a heart attack!
Scar if you don't upgrade your armour and gear next episode I'm gonna log in and end this series myself. Istg you need that extra protection
Anyone know why Smallishbeans' episode 2 is private
I fear endermen
You are amazing,  A master craftsman.    and I hope you make it through, but, I am not counting on it ...  You should have died soooo many times this episode.. LOL
You're on your way of obtaining the most "almost died" scenarios that ever existed in Minecraft 😂 10/10 would do it again. I love your style 😁
Can I last 25 minutes of consecutive heart attacks?
Scar please, everytime you are in your base please Just hold crouch so you dont fall...
When he jumped off the plank in perspective mode...that gave me a jump scare. 🤣😳
Scar, i %100 believe in your survival skills!
You should invite me to the server next episode ;)
I swear Scar chose to do this series at least PARTLY because he likes to stress us out!
Scar has some serious plot armor
This was a dangerous video...
I was really hoping that scar diesn't die!
I'm honestly loving this new series that you guys are sharing, I can't wait to see til the end lol
I live his laugh so much 😭😭
IT'S NOT LAST LIFE SCAR
I am going to have more grey hairs from watching this series, but it's worth it to see this amazing cliff/tree house and all of your shenanigans.
I'm so proud of scar doing hardcore series and facing death itself every episode xD such a thrilling series!
Im putting a bet down that scar dies to a berry bush in episode 7. of all things he hill get hit knocked down to a heart when he tries to run he walks into a berry bush
Scar this is not Last life this is hardcore why did you took grian's enchantment table
I'm new to this channel and I have never been this stressed before
I'd feel bad if any of them died before 100days. Also seeing their abadoned build on the server would feel lonely
You forgot to put ep. 2 or similar in the title.
nemo doesn’t have a brother
Scar should clear the bottom with water
you can transform the cave into overgrown and mossy with small &large dripleaf, glowberries leavesand a little pond
Maybe you could build a cable car between these two mountains.
HOW HAS THIS MAN SURVIVED THIS LONG?!?!?!?!? MY HEART CANT TAKE IT
Your plank jumps gives me multiple heart attacks
Really cool base, Scar! I love it!
Can you use glow berries at your base? I kept holding my breath this episode. Such bold moves
Here is a list of all the times Scar almost died. 7:30 10:52 12:15 12:40 13:12 14:17 16:40 17:24 (If he had landed on that grass block he would have died.)
I can't donate money right now, but I can donate my time by not skipping the ads
Your base upgrade is so gorgeous!!! ^^ I cant stop smiling looking at it all. I wish I could walk around it myself lol
Phantom
Do you reckon you could successfully team up with Smsllishbeans and kidnap Grians’ villagers?
When he tries to stay alive he dies but when he doesn’t pay attention he stays alive 😂😂
That was the most stressful episode of minecraft I've ever watched.
Watching this is almost the definition of anxiety.
Love the builds, Scar! It's so amazing to see you building such lovely things even in a Hardcore series! Definitely lots of heart-attacks from this episode, and a heartbreak from the time-lapse not working. Hopefully it'll be fixed for you soon though! I did, as always, enjoy the small bit of vibe we got from the time-lapse that was in the video though. Good luck! <3
Scar is the unluckiest luckiest man a live in 100 hours minecraft sever
It would be funny if you outlived Grian and Joel!
This is anxiety inducing but glad you survive this episode!  Literally this build is the epitome of: Living on the edge
“Shield is the most powerful item in the game” *Cries in Bedrock*
Ngl I kinda want Scar to actually die rather than survive in the series just to keep tradition
I NEED to know the seed of this world, it's so pretty
You are giving me anxiety!!! My heart stops every time you walk near an edge or the plank. But funny funny funny only you would have 3 trident mobs attack you 😂
I can bet you a dollar scar will have a longer series than grian and joel
the mob i fear the most would probably be the guardians
I bet 100 denarius that scar dies on the 3rd episode.
18:02 Scar: "we found nemo and his brother" me: "just keep swimming nemo"
Scar- "you cant disturb a man when he's eating an apple" Flashbacks to rendog seconds before an ambush collecting apples in last life
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life124
Series is great if you love experiencing anxiety!!! Scar you know how to keep an audience on edge
I Fear no man but that thing it scares me (Creeper)
Scar should get a pet baby zombie. Just to stress us all out.
the baby zombie is defenetly the worst
two videos in a row without any deaths. good on you scar!
Ohhh the anxiety… great job scar! Keep living life on the edge!!!
Why am I hearing some fans in the background
Every time you go on the plank... Its too much
they don't believe in you scar show em 😀
Scar: How do you survive hardcore minecraft? His base: That's the near part, you don't.
Scar,u missed an ore at 12:03
Scar are you okay you didn’t do your intro. Hello there my fellow miners and crafters good times with Scar here. I hurted me.
heist some more of grian stuff :3
It was so stressful 😫
SCAR I GOT THE JELLIE MERCH I LOVE IT SO MUCH
algorithm
Scar T____T you gave me multiple heart attacks please
None of us are good, nobody is better than anybody else, we are all sinners who by God’s free gift of salvation by dying on the cross for us, freed us from the pains of hell, and the human fear of death. Come to the LORD Jesus Christ, he will always love you, he will never neglect you. Come to him before it’s too late. ‘’For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life’’ John 3:16. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done (it’s not based on our performance) so none of us can boast about it. Ephesians 2:9 It is only through the grace of God are ye saved. So accept God’s Mercy repent for all of your sins, aloud to the Lord Almighty Christ Jesus, cry aloud that Jesus Christ is God, who was crucified and was raised on the third day. forsaking your sins and trusting in the rich blessings of his grace. ‘’for it is by faith that purge’s us from all sin, faith in the living God Christ Jesus’’
This is the most stressful hardcore series ever, yet I can't stop watching. My nerves will be in shambles more and more as the series continues. You're now my discomfort minecraft youtuber and I'm so proud of you for surviving THREE trident drowneds omggg???
New drinking game... take a shot any time Scar gives you a heart attack XD
Scars alive !!!!! my heart rate has been reduced until i watch this episode
I just know that the drip stone on the entrance of the mine is gonna be the killer for this series
skeliton
I say this in the my heartfelt way, you literally give people anxiety. Was there one minute you weren't trying to get killed?
Scar has the most beautiful base in this series but he also choose the most dangerous location to build a base
Worst mob... poison spiders 😰
scar you should build a simmalar tree on the other side and have a bridge spanning between them
10:53 I HAD I LITERAL HEART ATTACK
OMG HE GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK WHEN SCAR WALKED THE PLANK AND JUMPED NO NO NO
The 3 drownes almost give me a heart attack       Keep up the good work Scar👍✨
watching Scar do hardcore is like watching a horror movie
Loving the base, the farms are particularly good, they look like they are shaped like bracket fungus. The whole thing is very organic
Scar, I get that you love to build things...but maybe you should get some diamond armor before you start to build things in such dangerous location
Bruh.  Bring a BED.  When it gets dark sleep.  Know way you make it to 100 hours.  🤣.  Love ya though.   🙂
Now that Grian and Joe has basically accomplished the end of Minecraft, I really want to see how Scar can deal with the Ender Dragon alone, and at the same time, i really want to run some bets with the people of the comments on how and when Scar is gonna get oof-ed, or will he survive. who knows
Is there a Minecraft way to zip line?
Scar is the primary source of my anxiety. Lol
SCAR YOU GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK PLEASE!!!!!
This series gives me a heart attack every 30 seconds
I still laughing when scar said HARDCORE
25% there Scar! you can do it!
Please terraform the river larger. More room to not die would make me happy.
Scar if I die from a heart attack because of you, I'm gonna haunt you!  I love how this series is going
i legit thought you were gonna die with the 3 trident zombies
You should use Grian's villagers and make a pair of feather falling boots ... Just to be safe
I get panic attacks just seeing how scar has only 2 hearts and doesn't eat to regain 😅😅😅❤
can we just change the title into "100 hours of heart attack"?
Don't die. That's a good plan I think.
scar every time you jump off the plank i swear my lifespan is shortened ten years The new house looks great tho! It definitely fits better with the tree than the platform did. Not that the platform was terrible—the new house just feels more natural :) I can't wait to see what sort of designs you have in mind for a nether portal for this build! but for the love of everything please remember to eat because my guy you will perish without food
21:06 close your eyes guys
Scar's HORRIFIED GASP as he realizes that Grian jumped is the funniest thing to me rn helppp
1:45 boatem XD Scar keeping Hermitcraft things throughout his life :)
I love how your going outside your comfort with the hanging base! Show people scar can hang with the rest of them! you got 100 hours easy
24 minutes and 54 seconds of anxiety.
The singular trap door on top of the chest facing the wrong way
build a bridge build a bridge! Love the series Scar! Keep it up!
I am surprised that I am still alive because of the many times I held my breath at Scars many near demises....
Watching this is SO STREESFUL
Just wanted to say that your axe got switched with your food into the off-hand slot because you probably pressed 'F'. Pressing 'F' actually switches the item you are currently holding with the off-hand item.. It's a really handy feature you can use instead of opening your inventory. Good luck, Scar!  ( Also you should probably put a lot of water below your base, *juuust in case.* )
Can you stop jumping without looking because you can end your series but i dont want you to end your series :(
18:57 now er know würde the Name " Copperfield" comes from.....🤣😂 Dude, how can you make a Hardcore series so exciting!? What a Thriller, I never need a paytv when I can See you struggling through a Hardcore world.  Big Props to you that you are still alive. I would have died much earlier! 👍👍👍😜🤣
We make fun of scar for dying so often but I can say that I die so much more
Scar's builds always tells stories.
scar grian said u would not last but i know u can do it
Which mob I fear the most? Uhhhhh that would be the destroyer of Skizzles,  the boat vaulter extraordinaire, the aggro activated…enderman.
well done scar good job keep it going
put the farms staggered like that all the way down the valley.
Wait, Nemo has a brother? Nah, but seriously, you should link up all of your houses with dangerous walkaways.
Your base is beautiful.
Scar looks weird without his season 8 hat
Thats the funny part, *you might*
Who knew watching Scar play hardcore Minecraft would be so stressfu.l
Please stop jumping off the tree base  my hart
IT GOT AIM BOT MAN  SKELLTON Is THE WORST
congrats on the most stressful hardcore show out of all of them lmao
this series is so fun :) scar keeps terrifying me by being reckless but then he makes up for it will amazing bases!
this is plot armor levels of luck. oh my gosh, idk how scar survived those drowned attacks and then fell and somehow turned to find a lush cave to hide in.
Scar : Doesn't know if he has food for dinner Later : Throws his bread at the pillager
My anxiety can’t even right now
Heart attack: the series  This whole series is just me screaming ‘SCAR NOO!!!!’ Like grian in third life/ that one time in the boatem hole, every 30 seconds.
Scar if u boat off from exactly 49 blocks. U take damage and die
Scar... Please be safe... I want this to continue. . .
fantom
I think a huge bridge base would be super cool for a canyon like that! The middle can have a trading post with a bunch of little shops or microfarms(like sheep farms) stacked onto each other. Maybe the supports of the bridge have Jellie and Scar faces to really lay claim to the land. Then again, maybe a better idea for Hermitcraft 9 where dying is permitted 😅
This is definitely turning into Hermitcraft season 8.5.  I'm loving it!  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This video was the visual representation of stress.
This was an exceptionally funny (and stressful) episode, but by far my favorite part was at 17:51. It was just so hilariously deadpan: “Hello. We are ✨leaving✨.”
Scar!!! Your base is spectacular! The hubby and I think you'll at least make it to 50 (but we hope you make it all the way <3 )
it loocking freeking amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Scar might be the funniest hermit
Scar should make a Water boat elevator
Do you know how many heart attacks you gave me 😂 probably the same amount as you gave yourself 😂
(3:18) Did anyone else think Scar was gonna say "I'm a sucker for eggs" or was that just me?
are we gonna have magical fairy cliffs
19:22  *YESSIR!!  This is the stuff!*  _-Super-fast Build-mode abruptly ends-_  Oh... well shoot.  *"Cue Sera Sera"* Thanks lots for yet another fun video in 100 hours !HARDCORE! Minecraft.
Scar, what kind of music do you like listening to?
Scar, i believe in you. You got this. I trust that you can make it to 100 hours. If you want my help, just ask. I will always help.
You should try to raise the water level in the river some so that it will me safer if you fall, or a water fall Going under your base
The "walking the plank thing" is called a Gangplank, or just a Plank
Scar, you are just a mad man, for real you are the most talented minecrafter I know
The mob I fear the most is the Grian with End crystals...
I'm really anxious watching today episode, really love your base Scar :3
the Idea of a cliff face steampunk complex with lots of different overlapping paths and scaffolding sounds amazing
10:53 made me jumpscare
how is he still alive
This episode should be called "Two Hearts" good lord Scar! The builds are gorgeous, though! Loved hearing your time-lapse music. Warms my heart. 🥰
Day 9 of letting Scar know that he's Absolutely Brilliant!
I don’t know if its possible but i hope you add the timer to the hermicraft server I think it would be so interesting to see how much work you all put in, feel like it would really show the true dedication you all put into your work
I think out of all of the hardcore starter bases, scar's is without a doubt the coolest.
SCAR
For the farms to stay protected you can use glass the way Grian had used for his base. By the way love your videos they are awesome!
11:50 Zombie Toddlers are the WORST MOBS in the bloody game!
Yours is one of my favorite hard core series!! If that lush cave hadn't been there! My 1 heart can't take it.
skeletons and creepers are both terrible. creepers can 1 shot u if u dont hear or see them, and most of the time i dont hear them. skeletons hit every shot but i use a shield to deflect their arrows so i fear creepers more
could we take some time to appreciate on the very few best youtubers GOODTIMESWITHSCAR.......
Scar you can do it.
When scar said have some bread to the pillager, it felt like Marie Antoinette and the peasants
My heart literally stopped at 10:54 lol
Scar: We're safe now  also Scar: *on two hearts*
Just stay alive man.  Amazing builds as always. Love the series!
Scar, I love you, but _how_ are you still alive?
21:03 “I’m holding my meat” 😂😂😂 I know I’m immature
Cool builds, Scar! I'm impressed of how you managed to survive all of this. Here's an idea for the next build! Now you can build a crane above the mines down to the river, and at the bottom could be a port!
I know that this isn't a big deal, but I just noticed that the tip of scar's tree is pointing down despite nothing hanging on the tip.
The fact that Scar's base is so dangerous makes him more careful.
Scar’s videos are ao holesome, and really make me want to get better at building in this game, because at the time of saying this i’m not very good😕
He says he hopes he can keep makeing hardcore. But we all know he wont. Also bottome of your platform is a little flat.
I just nodised that you always look at your sheild
Anyone else notice somewhere between the ten and eleven minute marks the game audio just stops? It seems to have been replaced by a background buzz.
Anyone else notice somewhere between the ten and eleven minute marks the game audio just stops? It seems to have been replaced by a background buzz.
this my fave build of yours! not sure why, just everything i love about minecraft - and it was done in hardcore!
5 near deaths before the episode is at the halfway point
Scar, you almost got me a heart attack...
Please don't replicate it, but those near-death scenes are some of the best content I've seen in a while
How has the man who died to a panda survived 22.5 hours in hardcore
Scar at 100 hr done kill grian and beans by trap
THREE TRIDENTS??? the universe does NOT want you to last the longest
Am i the only person who loves his little giggle? I just found this channel and i havent stopped watching for 8 hours ._.
Scar as Professor Crystaldore would be fun in this series
U know what’s funny Scar went searching for dark oak saplings for ages but he could’ve just gone and asked Grian for some
The tables have turned, scar is stealing from grian ööö
Survival tip: use boats to trap some mobs.
No worries scar u can make it to 100 hrs. All the best!
HE'S STILL ALIVE??? 😂😂😂
Take inspiration from little nightmares
I was on the edge of my seat and laughing for most the video. Thanks for the great entertainment!
why dont you guys play it regularly instead of just for 100 hours, it will be interesting
Nice Jango/Boba reference
How you survived the drowned, I’ll never know. On a separate note, can you connect the two canyon walls via bridge?
You're such a good builder and a great person keep it up💛😊
this is so stressful to watch he keeps almost dying every few minutes
This video is pure, distilled anxiety
My heart can’t take this but I can’t stop watching.  Great and terrifying content!!
10:51 thank you
Watching Scar play hardcore is the most anxiety yet infuriating thing of all time.
The most terrifying mob in Minecraft is obviously the bunny
at 10:59 my heart literally stopped plz do not do that to me scar
I love how Scar speaks like grian:  “Did he say enchanting?”
Love you Scar, you are amazing! Thank you for the wonderful entertainment! However, I am surprised you have lasted this long. 😁
NGL, the endermen awe me and scare me at the same time
Scar is gonna die from falling off his house… I just know it.
The series is really helping me with my anxiety.  Not because it calms me or anything, but because it gives me so much anxiety that my normal amount seems more tolerable. 😂
i didn't think it could be more stressful than your last episode i completely underestimated you
scar giving me the heart attack every time he do something reckless xD
Scar, how about an arched bridge/mine track going from one side of the gorge to the other? Think it could look really cool! Love your content man, keep it up!
this man gets scared by everything but somehow manages to stand so close to falling to death like "this is fine"
good job!
Scar is giving me base envy. Your base is literally gorgeous, Scar!
This episode was pure anxiety
For the flowers on your house, I feel like sunflowers would look really cute, but it depends on the direction they face. Your base is looking so amazing!
SCAR! Can you PLEASE! Stop giving us! HEART ATTACKS!
Scar: you guys didn't think I'll make it in the first episode  Also Scar... *makes exit to base jumping 50+ blocks into river
Wow, Scar, you are a great builder! Your base is amazing, and I’m glad you had fun making it
I just like the way he steaks grian's enchantment table and runs away
Scar's going to end up dying to something small and stupid after surviving all these near death encounters.  "Well, we just survived almost getting blown up in a Desert Temple, being chased by 5 trident drowned in the river, and now, I've ran out of food, so we're heading back to base. Thankfully, my food bar is mostly full so we should be-"  *GoodTimesWithScar was pricked to death by a cactus*  "..........fine."
One of these days hes going to forget he doesnt have an elytra and just jump right off that thing
Lol! He missed a diamond in the top left corner at 11:45
Good my boi :D
Only Scar die from a very bush
Scar pro tip, magma blocks actually regenerate your oxygen meter. If you ever go underwater bring a few with you and keep moving it as you progress.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
I had like 12 heart attacks watching this video
Id decimate entire armies for his precious giggle.
the way you're going Scar you won't last too much longer..
Congrats on surviving another episode! Can't believe you've done 20 hours without dying.
Alternate title: scar almost dies for 24 minutes and 52 seconds
how r u still alive after 22h of playing? this is next level for u scar
I believe in you Scar, you CAN make it to 100 hours!
Man really wish this wasn’t going to be just 100 hours
scar I’m not saying you copied but your improved base reminds me so much of smallishbeans
creepers just scare me so creepers i guess
Literal jump scares  You need to be more careful my man😭
why did you make a wood mine cart instead of using a real mine cart?
Once again, the lush caves save Scar.  Scar, I think you have a gaurdian angel, The lush caves.
Your base reminds me of the game Blue dragon in the starting village
The build looks great!
Why do I have to choose which mob I fear the most between creepers and skeletons? I'm going to choose phantoms just to spite you
hey scar, just take our all the dirt from ground and replace with water... no need to worry about accidental falling
#1 worst common mob is baby zombies 🤬
Officially hitting 20% of the hours survived goal. You can do it scar we believe in you!
Scar is going to die from fall damage creepers or skeletons mark my words
Not sure if it’ll work in spectator, but holding left click, and hitting F3+T, and releasing the mouse before the progress bar is full is a vanilla way of setting up an auto clicker. That may keep your spectator account from going “inactive”
Hi
mob I fear the most = iron golem  gotta have at least 2 totems whenever i'm making an iron farm
Wouldn't it be sad if he died on hardcore on  99:59:58 seconds  Imagine how heartbreaking that would be🤣🤣
Not more copper 😩
scar you need to take advantage of the recharge between shots and lower your shield and get closer to the skeleton/trident drowned so you can dispatch them standing still and taking it just leads to broken shields
Now i know why he says “you may just become scarred for life.”
Creepers especially drop creepers        .
I fear Skeletons and Creepers the most because they are always my downfall, survival or hardcore. They can take me out in any order. (Creeper lowers my health, sneaky skeleton finishes me off. Or TWO skeletons fire at my from opposite sides, Creeper in the crossfire)
Hi          .
Creepers are the worst especially drop creepers
Scar did you fall asleep during the movies all of Nemo's siblings died
He should practice using his shields and learn the ai, once you know how they work they become predictable and easier to beat, if he does he could greatly reduce the panicked response to danger and more camly deal with stuff
#KeepScarAlive
If Scar leave this series without getting the habit of being ALWAYS at full hunger then there's no help for him.
Some of us want to see the caving and the finding of diamonds. Not always the building of buildings
"The walking the plank thing" otherwise known as a "plank"
I can't tell if Scar is going to die by berry bush or if he is just trolling us all in one of the greatest trolls ever.   What if all his deaths up until this point were just a long con making us think he can't do it?
i loveuh the build, its muah chef's kiss
Grian and joel having full netherite  and elytras  Scar still having iron armor
After surviving 3 trident drowned zombies, I fully expected you to die to berry bushes.
Honestly, this episode feels like those cartoons where you see a character just walking into deadly scenarios and somehow narrowly avoiding death at each obstacle. Anyone else feel like that?
They should give scar a totem
When you realise grian pay a diamond for something he already had
how this man has survived this long is a one of life's great mysteries
Please don’t die scar
Watching scar play a hardcore world is the MOST STRESSFUL THING EVER
You know, if you make a waterfall, you can have more room to be safe from falling!
what's the seed for this world?
Hey Scar build a shrine of Grain and just wait for him to find it.
Why no one is  talking about the trident 🔱 escape he did that was crazy 😧😧😧😧
How on earth did you survive this episode?! The amount of times you came seconds from dying was terrible
If You Had Killed the Drowned you coulda got a trident.... But Scar safety comes first!
It'd be cool if you kept the cartoonish aesthetic going and made all your builds a bit impossible/over-the-top in some way.   As someone who has died multiple times to Drowned, I had PTSD when the second one showed up to a world I rage quit because two Drowned spawned early game and wouldn't let me get my stuff or access the village I had just found. And when the third one appeared, I was thinking, "So this is how Scar dies." Glad I was wrong!
When I saw you almost drown in the cave then immediately dig straight up and almost get suffocated- “Out of the frying pan, and into the fire” woooo hears to episode three
I love the channel and I love the building style and skill keep mining  and crafting your way through.
Ive never been more scared
scar is living in a giant bird cage
Let me remind you all that Scar can survive a LOOOOONG time if he puts his mind to it. He was the first red life on 3rd life, and was the second last in a fight to the death with so many people actively trying to kill him. Now that's saying something
Love this series!! Keep it goin scar ❤️
I think more berry bushes and ferns would look good in the flower beds
Creeper. I fear the creeper. I honestly play in peaceful alot when I'm around my bigger builds lol
Creeper... they can sneak up behind you.  I've died many times because of them.  Skellies I can run away from, if need be.  :-)
Grian totally drove into the abis imm after chastising Scar for being too dangerous.
SCAR, just an idea, try placing half slabs undernethe the trapdoors so it will look more thick stable and it woudnt be that dangerous, try it
Can anyone tell me why scan play without  sounds ????
I can’t believe you’re still alive 😳 I’m so proud
Scar, to freak out grian, don a HEROBRINE skin and walk up behind him.
I love that the title could refer to so many different moments in this episode
SCAR WHY EVERY TIME YOU JUMP OFF THE THINGY
Scar: hears hardcore Also Scar: Now would probably be a perfect time to make a hanging tree that falling from it would kill me. Sometimes I think of the best ideas 😌
Redefining 'Scar-safe' with every episode...
“No no no, have some beef jerky, it’s zombie flavored”😂
Creeper Can make thé infrastruktur broko
all 3 of these guys have plot armor
Impressive escape!
That gave me heart attacks tbh
this is the most stressful thing i have ever watched omg
I'm slowly getting used to Scar just jumping off his base but my heart still can't take all that near-death escapes that trident boi, all those skellies, and Scar ignoring his two hearts for a bit there
scar we love you but how the hell are you still alive
Scar is an amazing builder but he also is amazing at dying
I’m honestly impressed that Scar can say A Hundred Hours in HARDCORE! Minecraft™️ with the punctuation and everything
I can't count how many time scar gimme a heart attack and anxiety
Who needs diamonds when you have plot armor. When you survived that fall and made it into the saftey of that lush cave i could not believe it. Go Scarcore!
Goals for next episode: 1. Netherite (ask for help) 2. Minecart mail system to Grian (it's tradition)
i love scars  timelapse music
Creeper because it sneaks up on you and destroys your landscape too ALSO LIKE INSTAKILL
"Now that you're my friend, kill this man" -Scar
Don't know what everyone is thinking saying scar won't survive. He's got this... Not that he won't scare us all constantly 😂
Did scar not relise grian had dark oak trees to get saplings from
Thank you scar
Scar, I love you, but my blood pressure has risen significantly in the last 25 mins
I can't stand blaze they are just the worst
Every time you fall off that plank I have a mini heart attack
He is so risky
Scar nonchalantly making me extremely nervous and building a masterpiece in the same video
I fear the green moss creeper!!! Just a little hiss click booom and you done son!
Scar please get a feather falling book.
Hey scar friendly tip for you ...        EAT!!
Scar Almost Dies, The Episode
How’d he survive for that long?! I thought he’d only survive 30 minutes or so…
you know, i almost like the big reveal instead of a timelapse. changes it up anyway.
mark my word, scar is gonna die by right clicking on one of his trap doors on his haning platform
Your base is so cool and it blends with the cliff so well
Joel: netherite  Grain: getting netherite  Scar: treeeeeeee
Scar, please for the love of god, stop almost dying. You are killing me. Your base looks great tho
Can’t tell you how many times I’ve died to a Skely boi
What about a specialized river passage? Instead of a land path, make people take the time to row through your specialized canal with all sorts of terraforming and decoration. However, infrastructure comes first. Take care of resource acquisition first - and safety. You don't want to die and lose your chance to make a Scartiful base. Have a Blessed Day! Sincerely, aмвerfℓy (Firefly)
The truly most terrifying mob in all of minecraft is hands down...... baby zombies. I cried just writing this comment.
Scar might not die in minecraft, but his monetization will if he keeps playing at risky, humming Jurassic Park music
Make a giant fallen tree across the gorge and then you can have everything hanging off of it
Gosh, Grian is peaking like crazy
Did I watch this man almost die like 20x???
SCAR if you die you should, spectate  the others as if it was a nature documentary
17:10 SAVED IN THE NICK OF TIME!!!! Omg that was a great moment, I can't believe your survived!!!
Watching Scar in hardcore is the most anxious thing ever
Every time Scar jumps off his base my anxiety just; 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
I have been chased through the streets of Hong Kong by insane policemen firing tear gas and rubber bullets, and yet watching THIS was the most stressful thing I've ever done!
New rule. Do not watch scar before bedtime!!! Heart racing!!!!
Thanks!
I love how similar and different all the builds are between Joel Scar and Grian. It really helps the world fit together and it’s beaUTiful!
Scar you can use slabs under the trap doors to make it safer
Talk about anxiety adrenaline driven episode, i almost died😆😭😵
ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE BLINDLY JUMPED OFF THE PLATFORM INTO WATER???
In the next episode Scar should get some protective armor so he doesn’t accidentally die to some berry bushes! 😂😅 (And won’t give us random heart attacks throughout the episodes)
Scar: "I'm just a simple man making his way through the universe" Me: dying when hears the star wars quotes
maybe add tailings pile under the cart in the valley
100% skeletons
10:50 bro I almost had a heart attack
i think creepers are worse ngl
Real Fear is the dreaded baby zombie 😬
scar, you're great, i love watching your content but i do not think you can do this, please prove me wrong
I wanted to relax. You're just making me stressed! lol
don't u dare jump off ur house without a boat
I discovered hermitcraft during season 8, and you’ve quickly become my favorite hermit Scar! I love your positive attitude and your beautiful and impressive building styles. Thanks for taking the time to make content for us!
SCAR you're gonna give me a heart attack.
Did he just rebuild the first hanging house without having a safety pool below?
14:25 He literally should have died there. WOW!
Hi scar you can do it :D I know you can, I tried to do a 100 hour hardcore world as well and died on the 2nd hour lol.
skeletons are the worst early game but late game creepers and baby zombies are terrifying
I'm having heart attack after heart attack
Good evening
Scar I believe in you but with everything that happened this episode I have no clue how you aren’t dead already
The minecraft lords decided that they want scar to live.
Someone needs to react to this with a heartrate monitor
Wow ya gotta be careful someone actually might get a heart attack I swear this is absolutely insane 😂
Scaar! Bring bed, always check your hunger, and upgrade your gear immediately. You give me a heart attack but you're awesome
Scar…. Has the WORST survival instincts
I like scar biulds
I fear no mob. But fall damage? Fall damage scares me.
SCAR NEVER TAKE YOUR SHIELD OUT OF YOUR OFF HAND AND CARRY EXTRAS
Of all the hardcore series going on, I think this is my favorite
"now your my friend, KILL HIM" -goodtimeswithscar 2022
Skeletons are definitely one of the most annoying mobs, but I think that’s because I play Bedrock and they have higher knockback or something
SCAR!!! WHY WOULD YOU JUST RUN OFF THE PLANK!!! like grian said… THERES A TREE THERE! And you somehow have got on your side for being ONE FRICKEN BLOCK AWAY FROM DEATH!!! why scar you are going to make me have a heart attack and I’m always anxious watching you!
I fear the warden
Skeletons are the bane of my existence personally
Amazing how scar can get so close to death but never quite going over the line, so many little heart attacks xD.    Also thought at the end how a little pond or river at the top of the mountain that goes into a small water fall would be nice, especially how scar gets to his house if there was a small waterfall blocking his view for a second would look cool. Big comment 0-0
I held my breath for like 90% of this episode. Scar in hardcore is stressful 😂
2 words: netherite grian and joel
Congrats on trending and the heart attacks!
Dang it Scar.. my heart can’t handle much more
I think he will last all the way or 53 hours
The house is so cute!
The time that scar jump off the house it's a music in my ears XP
The way he said “skeletons are scary especially in hard-core. Specifically when they shoot you off a cliff in the dark”  and then he immediately got shot off the cliff✨🤣
Well you didn't ask but I am making the super villains of this sense I did super heroes and if more come I'll add more okay so first one is  The troubling three drowns That each have a Trident one controls the luck of the victims the second control's the night and day and the third one controls the ocean and can make Evan spear fishing hard the wear ripped up shirts with little gem necklaces  The two ghostly spiders  They both can cause illusions but was are pretty weak in reality all you need is light they will  sometimes brake block's above our hero's to give them a spook they are afraid of light because ghosts  (Purposeful misspell below)  Skeletron is a skeleton that wears leather clothes with tiny diamonds on it and on top of that is a torn up purple cloak with a neon green stripes on the bottom of it fights with a diamond sword and a bow that shoots lava, cake, iron, water, and diamond arrows pretty spooky
You should make the bridge/path between the cave tunnel and your house into more like a old creaky bridge so the hanging tree makes more sense again
Scar, trigger a raid at Grian's then run away.  Just a thought for later.....
here we are on the walking the plank thing ummm... i think its a plank
With the amount of times Scar almost died in that cave, it’s good that he has a dog to help protect him. Too bad the dog can’t protect Scar from himself 😔💔
Scar running for his life to escape the drowned.  Later meets a heavenly beautiful lush caves.  (What a lucky guy)
Scar should build more trees so it looks like a cool custom forest so that there is more than one tree in the base
scarf returns.
HOW DID YOU NOT DIE!!!!!
You should make a giant beehive for part of your bace
this is a horror movie and yes scar, I'm SCARRED for life.
Hermitcraft is so wholesome
Scar: "these caves are not scar safe" Me: "this series is not scar safe"
The goats scare me the most
Fantastic!
i am slowly realizing scar is actually a master of minecraft, a savant really - he knows exactly how many blocks he'll travel by jumping, knows exactly how much damage he can take.... just extraordinarily sadistic and knows all of the ways to give us heart attacks XD okay i know he's just a goof but WHAT IF
Does anybody else think Scar should put something that looks really heavy onto the tip of the tree so it makes a bit more sense for the top to look so pulled down?
I mean.. adleast the tree is beautiful!
I fear skeleton, because creepers you can always block with a sheild, sometimes arrows get by when you try to attack
Scar you press the f button to switch items from your main hand to your offhand and vice versa
Love how you can tell Scar is a Portlander because he says gorge.
sick base
This video made my heart sink a couple times but I'm fine xD
At the drowned part i was thinking " Make one shhot the other!"  I really like the shield for those shenanigans.
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES SCAR ALMOST DIED DUE TO MOBS- I SWEAR SIR YOU NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL
Haa “oh no is he dead?!”  “Oo do I get his villagers”  Brilliant
This entire video had me terrified 😰
My man has plot armor lol
Your builds are so amazing Scar  I love how creative you get with them and I hope one day to be able to build amazing things like you hope you are having a good day and doing well 💙
10:54 WTF Scar! You scared the Sh*t out of me!
Watching Scar play hardcore is like skydiving without a parachute; it's exhilarating but there is no way this will end well.
make the bridge towards the house a rope bridge
now you should make farms that are hanged up by a hot air balloon like sugarcane
I love how the new house and mine have the slight cartoony feel, I think it’s a nice break from standard styles
Scar really loves living on the edge surprising us he's still alive like every few minutes
Loving the videos keep the amazing vids up scar!
He's not gana make it past episodes 4 is he
Scar is having too much fun giving us anxiety by diving off his base.
11:39 Just like you Scar.
Am I the only one that thinks "on death's door when we were needy" is the perfect song lyric for Scar?
10:54 My anxiety 12:56 invisible spider??? 19:35 wonk wonk wonk 22:58 those are beautiful minecart and tracks
Your giving me a heart attack when you jump SCARRRR
funniest pov by far
Scar: the walking the plank thing.  Idk what it’s called. Me: …the plank?
Definitely a skeleton is worse, creepers disappear after one explosion that you can block with a shield but skeletons have range and without armor it’s scary
Skeleton.
grian and joel killed the enderdragon and got a elytra
Scar: 3rd person jumps off his tree me: --v^v^--v^v--^v^v--^v^v^-- Scar: lands 1 block from solid land me: ----------------------------
I like that Scar always go for aesthetics over practicality XD
What a roller coaster!! So proud of you for surviving so long.
Scar my dud, feather falling 4 and projectile protection should be at the top of the list.
A Hardcore Minecraft Series demands a Hardcore Magic Crystal.
Make A Base Under Grian's Starter house
Next episode you should add osha compliance to your base
Scar’s going to survive the longest, isn’t he?
You can feed your wolf zombie flesh. It heals the dog and saves your food.        Also, me casually reporting every reply to a comment that is an ad for something inappropriate or criticizing the channel so people look at their channel.
Omg when scar is up against those drowns I got so scared
Safety just more railing
Creeper is definitely worst than the skeleton. You can lure the skeleton, one arrow is definitely not enough to kill you, even when surprised. Even worse, the creeper has you rebuild stuff when you blow it up... I remember playing with mob griefing off for years but it broke too much stuff.  If there was a command to specifically prevent creepers from griefing though, i'd use it all the time.
Everytime Scar jumps off, a part of me dies in the panic.
Haven't watched this to the end yet, but if you need ideas for your flower pots you can put azalea bushes in them! I think they would compliment your base very well :)
I don't know if Scar will survive until the end of the 100 hours, but I'm worried I won't make it to the end given how many heart attacks he's constantly giving me.
Im surprised theres an episode 2
Wow, can someone give me the probability that two invisible spiders spawned in the same cave at the same time? I’ve never seen that before
A new episode on the same day I got my swaggon hoodie?!?!?! 😍
Perhaps you could replace the bridge to your starter base with a hanging one? I think it might make it look a bit more like it's actually hanging off the tree.  Other than that, your base looks really cool!
I might die before scar gets to 100 hours geezzz repeatedly giving us heart attacks!
So cool!
Congrats scar, you made it through 2 episodes
Scar remove the boat in the river! If u jump down and land on it, u can take fall damage!
Scar “ I’m going to survive 100 hours. 2 minutes later “why not just dig up”
Scar I need to tell u sumthin!!!
You give me anxiety
scar is going to make it to 99 hours and die from 2 pieces of gravel
You could put a pile of mining debris at the bottom of the cliff
Watching you gives me anxiety 😂😂😭😭
I was very amused by your Jurrasic World theme song imitation Thank you for doing that :D
10:53 - Scar please stop doing this. My heart can't take it 😲
That is one of the most stressful pieces of video I have ever seen.  o_O
I was watching this at 4am and i never screamed that loud in my entire life... Welp i got yelled at. Jeez scar.....
On the next episode of "1000 Ways to Almost Die" with GoodTimesWithScar...
Really nice looking builds Scar. I do hope to see more of that amazing bent tree or maybe some other version of it.
One Block From Death is a good Band Name
The dripstones in your mine entrance can kill you, did you know that scar?
How about you make an animal farm? I would also like to see something on the other side of the canyon, but that could wait until a later episode too
I'm listening to you plan your base and I'm just pulling my hair out. You are totally going to fall, and everyone will be so sad for you but not really because you, chose this for yourself. This base idea is not "Scar Safe"
scar, i have a feeling that the tree at the bottom of the jorge will be the reason for your demise.
I am convinced that watching Scar cheat death a million times each episode is the sure fire way to desensitise yourself to general anxiety.
Cave spiders are my most feared mobs, although that might not count bc you’ll never see just 1
I never once thought you would die on the first episode and I am sure you will last for many more! *cheers* I love the Tree base and can't wait to see what you have planned, your are an AMAZING builder!! <3
i am in a full sweat watching this. i have never been so concerned for someone else's game. This is top level, edge of your seat entertainment!
grian and joel: do bases then  move on,  Scar; spends whole series on his starter base
I don't think you'll last 100 hours, but i do hope you late atleast 50 ^^
dont die to a llama, I believe in you (kindof)
It's still gives me heart attack, eventhough I had prepare myself.
Plz don’t die scar 🥺
I love this series
how is he not dead yet...
Idea: a wooden gondola going between both cliffs of the valley. Make it wooden to fit the tree's theme.
21:05 well that's going in a scar out of context compilation; I'm sure
If it let out an OMG everytime i saw low health on Scar it took probs around 70% of the video -_-' i felt my heart drop everytime i thought this would be the end Dx
10:53 I don't play hardcore. Don't plan to.... But I got scared.
Wither skeleton
Try roses in the flower beds.
Not even 5 minutes into the video and scar already mentioned 3 copyrighted movie franchises lol
Hey guys I came up with a fun new drinking game: take a shot every time your heart drops while watching this series as Scar inches closer and closer to his demise 😂😂
Scar, before you make your next episode, you should do a few hours of practicing water bucket and boat saves 😂😂😂. I really want to see you make it to the end, and I think you can (please DON'T get an Elytra, the kinetic energy is out to get you)
Grian and joel already beat the ender dragon and have full netherite stuff and scar is jumping from his tree with iron armor. EPIC
18:02 oh look! we found nemo! Nemos brothers and sisters died before he was born
Skeletons are the worst
thanks to this series, I have a new fave game. I call it: "Is scar trolling the viewers with possible death or is he actually about to die?"
Scarr giving me a heart attack every five seconds, haha jeeeez
Scar I am an avid horror game enthusiast. No play through, or let’s play, or whatever, has left me more anxious or scared than this one. /lh
EAT Scar!!!!
I wish your ladder was glowberries instead
enCHANting episode
Definitely skeletons are worse then creepers
You are so amazing man... I pray for your health and I hope you are well. And minecraft speaking... MAN PLEASE DO NOT DIE, that series is beautifull, the tree and your design are so incredible!! Do some branch mining for diamonds, gear up steal some featherfalling from G and liiiiive XD love from Poland, can't wait for the next ep:)
"I would like to leave this area with my head still on my head." Scar 2022 17:55
someone must make a compolation of scar near deaths
Scar is giving me anxiety levels i didnt know i had
I love how your mind works Scar! Been watching since your colab with Neebs Gaming a millennium ago
I have never seen someone take so much damage from berry bushes
I'm really surprised that you didn't die in the first fifteen minutes of this series!
Wow, that build looks awesome...   but please stop giving us anxiety, you are surviving on incredible luck alone :)
OMG!!! Scar you're an amazing builder!! That's fantastic what you done in this mountain!!!
I am unsure if scar has incredibly good luck or incredibly bad luck
I love how he says "Hardcore" like people used to say "Parkor", Its the best. Love ur vids Scar!
how r u alive
Scar is sus , vote him out.
No joke, your mine reminds me of a ride at Disney Land
I thought it was in my head last episode, but Scar saying wow really sounds like Owen Wilson
I see you have met a terrible fate, Trident River Drowned. Yes, they do spawn silly often in deep rivers, the night really brings out the green envy of the living in their eyes. Iron will not protect you.
Pretty sure that's a valley, not a gorge.
10:51 This is the *most anxiety* I have ever felt in my *_life_*
the new base looks so good!! :)
SCAR THIS WHOLE EPISODE WAS TERRIFYING
Baby zombie
At 10:55 I jumped out of my skin! SCAR!
KIDNAP HIS VILLAGERS
Scar how about a ship hanging into a tree
I think running into a horde of cave spiders in the abandoned mineshafts is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me in Minecraft, I sleep with 2 eyes open now
Baby zombie
Scar you give me a herat attack with this base sometimes T-T
I think if you added a huge waterfall behind the farms it would look really cool. Especially since you would have to walk behind it to get the house with the added bonus of it looking like your water source for the farms.
"Spearfish salmon with my bow."  I'm no linguist, but isn't that called...bowfishing? 😆
Scar and hardcore goes about as well together as Grian and finished backs of bases
Creepers
After seeing this episode I actually became scarred for life...
Scar is getting a taste of the Trident Drowned infestation in the server.
of creeper or skeleton it will be skeleton
This episode gave me so many mini heart attacks 😅 I'm going to be sad if scar doesn't make it the 100 hours
You should put your Nether portal hanging at the very end of the tree👌
I was really looking forward to that Timelapse music 😢.  I always go into a new world trying to establish infrastructure but end up being distracted with building stuff. The fact that scar is still in iron gear and already has a great build speak to me on so many levels. lol.
Skeleton
You're a mad man.. so many near deaths, that moment when you broke into the beautiful green cave haven was amazing. Like a Disney moment. Really love the cliff buildings, such a cool idea and incredibly creative build.
If Scar survives 100 hours, he’ll be until labor in HC season 9.
No messing with Joel.... yet.
you have so mutch luck
#NotScarSafe
full netherite is what u should try for next episode use beds instead of tnt
maybe line the cave path with some gemstone blocks?
scar is going to die from accidentally starting a raid, i’m calling it now
Scar is the definition of “doing it for the ✨aesthetic✨”
grian and luke in 10 hours: diamond and netherite armor scar: ''it's not much, but it's honest work''
Love it.  The 1.18 terrain is sooo inspiring.
I'm happy to see he's still using Howl by Lupus Nocte for his Super Fast build mode music. Thought that was just for Hermitcraft
man is living on the edge of life and death
10:56 WHY
WHY ARE YOU GIVING US HEART-ATTACKS!!! 🤣
I have never wanted someone to succeed so much, at something I have no real belief they can achieve
trying to appreciate my tree base-Grian
Scar should make an actual pool below his house so that it's like a diving board xD  (Definitely for aesthetic, not because it's Scar safe)
Scar : removing the trap floor in super fast build mode Me in super fast worry mode : umm scar you forgot the swimming pool thingy
Scaryest mob is the warden
Watching Scar's episode, compared to Grian's, is full on anxiety the whole time.
The fact that scar not only had THREE trident wielding zombies spawn on him, but also SURVIVED it, is amazing
Piglin brutes/ zoglins still scare me, they hit like a truck when you arent looking
You could make a bunch of small house facades in front of the farms, like a cliff city
I play 5 different games with skeletons. All those enemies have aimbot. Skeletons suck. Only thing that’s worse than Minecraft skele is flintlock skele form SoT
The most panic induced video scar made
baby zombies
10:54 that was close!
Where did scars dog go at the end after the remodel?
Since Scar didn't die in the first episode, I now owe the mafia 100k and they're going to break my kneecaps.
Scar you should double trapdoor your tree for a safety procedure
THIS IS THE MOST ANXIETY I EVER HAD WATCHING MINECRAFT, SCAR
CREEPER CREEPER CREEPER CREEPER CREEPER CREEPER
This whole video is Scar coming within millimeters of death and recovering miraculously in a dense cycle.   In usual fashion he still has something amazing to show us by the end.
Scar saying I killed a man and then immediately after asking if he gets to keep Grian’s villagers is the best! Edit: oh my god Scar! Please you are giving my anxiety anxiety.
I love this series and can't wait to continue my family's trend of having heart attacks
Creepers
scar's "oh no he's dead i killed him!" is giving me neville longbottom "i've killed harry potter!" vibes lol
Pillagers. So goddam annoying when you just want to work on building and a pack of them just walks up to you and shoots you so you kill them and then they start a freaking raid next to your villagers and kills them all.                 Yes, I am venting my anger.
This is a horror series
creeper. they sneak up on you and blow up. (maybe destroying your base.) Although all of my hardcore worlds, Ive died from a skeleton...
ngl i thought those trident bois would kill you
I just can’t believe that one you didn’t die yet, and two that you can build so well in a place like that with out dying.
Watching this series ain’t good for my heart. 😂
(10:54) Oh goodness, that could've been it.
A viaduct would fit well in between the two cliffs and would look good
Hang glow berries from your tree!!
What a ride this week was! Next on the to-do list: feather falling and protection! It’s time to bubble wrap because I don’t think my nerves can handle another encounter on Trident Island.   Speaking of, I think the “borrowed” enchanter may have cursed you. The mobs and landscape weren’t trying to kill you until after you enchanted your tools. That can’t be a coincidence!
I say creeper scar ,cause a creeper can end your hardcore world in 1 hit
so, idk who told Scar that a hardcore series would be a good idea but the level of stress that i get seeing him play this series... OMG
Scar if you lose heart and a mob is hitting you just eat, it will regenerates your hearts quickly
Axolotls are nice! If you’d have clicked one with a water bucket and set them on the drowned it would have killed them. They’re aggressive but only to hostile water mobs like guardians etc
"Hey look we just found Nemo. And his brother." Wasn't a big part of Nemo the fact that he was the only surviving egg?
Scar play Breath of the wild because your house looks like  a giant bird house.
Eyes bugged out at 21:23
Roller Coaster ride of full anxiety but with different levels
Sorry but I have a weird gut feeling that he will only make it to 300 hours but I still have faith in scar.
"what mob scares you the most? "  -    I fear no mob.  But... That man... *points at GoodTimesWithScar* That Man scares me.   Well more accurately the risks you take for no real raisin.
For now
Wither Skeleton with a bow yes it is rare but it is scary
The warden it has 500 HP
Can you make a cool place for the nether portal please.
I love Scar, but he is absolutely ngmi
24:51
Super fast build mode hype!!!  Oh.  Scar leaving me with wanting more, lol!  Loved the episode!  Super pumped and inspired.
10:53, yeah you did... stop jumping from high places Scar hahaha. Btw, skeletons is more annoying than creepers. :-D
WOW that base looks amazing!!!! but please scar stop jumping off the front it gives me a heart attack every time XD
imagine saying we found ""nimo and his brother"  even tho nemo deosnt existpl and dont have a brother
what mob .... the warden
that's the prettiest base I've seen in a while
Scar, please, i cant this series is too much
How in the world did scar leave that copper at 22:55 ?!?!?
Put guard rails everywhere, it’s stressing me out lol
No no no no no! Its not 100 hours in hardcore its 100 hours in hArDcOrE! 10:03
Skeletons kill me far more often than creepers, but maybe I'm just bad
Me:often doesnt even find one trident wielding drowned at the sunken ruins.   Scar: 3. In a river. At the same time...
Grian: How are you not dead yet Scar  Scar almost dying for several hours: I don't know
"You didnt think id survive the first episode" *numerous times he got below 2 hearts*
I know that you will find a way to survive too 100 I believe in you
I feel like that plank jump will end this series in the future.😂
This series sets buttholes to maximum clench! XD
Where did your puppy go? And I’m loving this series so far
17:20 "minecraft isnt a horror game" 👀 really? Because I've never had so much second hand fear for Scar xD
I love your builds in this series!!! Beautiful!
Scar like “eat this bread peasant “
Nice to have something to replace hermicraft  Edit: A Bridge? Creeper. Unless you're on the edge of a drop, then it's a Skeleton...   Unless you're running from a creeper.
I’m calling it now he’s dying in episode 4
Did I really hear Scar say “so we need farms, mines, places for our portal eggcetera, eggcetera” at 10:15 instead of etcetera?
petition to change this to 500 hrs in MC
You just make a giant pit with water at the bottom underneath the tip part where you jump off.  Edit: hopefully that makes sense
10:50 Scar’s decision making is far more dangerous than any mob, but we love him for it.
DUDE😲
One of my most favourite minecrafters
segu
SKELETONS are for sure the most terrifying mob to encounter in minecraft 0_o
hah
How are you alive?!!! I’m loving this series.
I fear the children
Please I will buy all the merch if you just stop jumping down like that
I think I yelled out loud, “SCAR EAT SOMETHING” At least five times this episode.
Easily the most stressed I have ever been watching minecraft... xD
Creeper ended my speedrun in hardcore soooo
how does someone play 22 hours of Minecraft and only have iron armor lmao.
Scar you need a Minecraft teacher!!
How is this man still alive.
24 minutes and 32 seconds of anxiety with Scar
just wondering, what is the background music scar plays at 12:41?
Scar: “Thank you for all the kind and positive comments”  Grian: “I didn’t see a single person who said I could do it”
Honestly give this one more episode 😂😂😂
Sad to see the original build destroyed! 😫 Would have loved to see it honored throughout the whole series 🙌
Keep up the good work I reckon you can survive the hundred hours
How to recognize a Scar base:  The PLANK is safer than the BASE
this video is art in its pure state. this man is so good at making videos, omg.
i jumped so much in this video please scar
My mind playing Dumb ways to die while watching Scar almost dying
Every time scar jumps near the edge of his base or off of his base i can feel my heart screaming
Scar, living on the windy side of careful since forever! I love how you said you were going to use "Grian's Enchanter" like you weren't already doing that! lol. Luv ya, Indiana Scar!
The music disc cat is my alarm for waking up lol
vexes/evokers
Would a wither skeleton be scary if you didn't carry a milk bucket and may die by withering
It's not spear fishing if you use a bow, it's bow fishing
Scar talking about Grians base looking like an egg was so pure to me
yes scar playing hardcore my weekly cardio
I think I hit 999 bpm while watching this, stay safe Scar!
Someone start a counter for every near death experience scar has, including scares like him barely making it into the water 😂
Scar should be allowed an elytra in this world for his own safety. Can't even count how many times I saw the phrase "GoodTimeWithScar experienced kinetic energy" in the hermitcraft chat
This series is just 100 hours of anxiety for the audience
bn
hdh
The mandolorian/book of boba reference was executed well
He needs to attach something to the tip of the tree. Otherwise the tree would stop curving after the chain that attaches the house to the tree.
it won't matter if scar makes it to 100 hours or not, I'm going to die of a heart attack long before then
Feather falling should be a priority for scar!
3 Trident Drowned? I didn't know this was a Bedrock server? Oh wait, he lived, must be Java.
21:05
even better. Try building a big statue that’s ruined and reaching out for a sword planted in the other side of the gorge
Every time he jumps off a ledge without looking down first I lose literal years of my life
People shouldn't underestimate Scar.  He's gone caving in both episodes now with very little gear, and survived!
11:50 for Java edition, a creeper, it seems like they spawn _everywhere_ But for bedrock edition, skeletons, as it's *impossible* to get close enough to hit one with a sword without a shield because of how fast they shoot And even if you do have a shield, it's going to take quite a while for the skeleton to die, as it's just going to hit itself with its own arrow and be knocked back further until you find a wall to stop it on
That feeling when Scar's hardcore series lasted longer than Pearl's...
It’s called a TRI-dent for a reason scar 😆😁
Nice Jango Fett reference! 👍
Scar please my heart
You could make a beautiful pirate ship in that water cave like its emerging from a resting place or its stranded or something maybe with broken and torn sails and such 🙂
You should use the glow berries from the lush caves.
I put this on to relax before a nap. I ended up more alert than I was going to bed. Those mining expeditions had my toes curled!
My stress levels seem to have increased after watching this episode. 😅😂 Love your work Scar. ❤️
Scar! Your base is so much better than Joel’s and Grians. I love that you are wanting to “fix” it but it’s great already
i nearly had a heart attack when he jumped off the brige
Scar dont you dare to use an Elytra. 90% of your deaths on hermitcraft are probably by flying in to structures. And oh boy, this episode gives me anxiety.
This is the most stressful series ever!
The heart attacks from this! Scar was right. I may have just become scarred for life.
If you’re ever terrified about Scar dying in this world, just remember that this man spent majority of 3rd Life as a Red Name and somehow survived to the end. He’s simply✨Built Different✨
For the spectator account just put an auto clicker on. Then it wont kick you
hey Scar, Grian has a mending vilager. Also you shoud make a hanging animal farm under the mine for good looks. Have a good time
I have been jump scared by ghast too many times
What is that terrible sound in the background?
I bet you will make it to 100 hours!!!!!
Just a normal episode with Scar.  A few minutes later.  Nooooooooooooo!!!!! Dont die! (So much heartattack moments there)
that was so close  so manny times     i keep clenching my jaw when your about to die im not going to have teeth by the end of this     pls stay safe scar
scar i think i can hear your computer fan
I am not sure if scare survies the 100 hours... but i am sure i will not
SCAR OH MY GOD 17:05 right after you block an attack, the mobs are on cooldown and cant attack for a little bit, just run towards them then sheild again, then when you are close enough, hit them during that cooldown, PLEASE FOR MY ANXIETY I BEG OF YOU
hey scar, you should take tile copper slabs and place them around the edge of your farms
My anxiety every time Scar jumps from his plank:  📈📈📈📉📉📉
I believe in you :3
good luck on your survival
who bets that scar will last the whole 100 hrs, say I :)
Scar's luck crystals survived the server reset I see. That was so intense! No one else has a hardcore series this riveting lol.
Scar you should make a hot air balloon
Those tridents break your shield so fast man... usually when I go trident hunting I bring like 1-2 backup shields just so I don't have to deal with crafting them on the fly Good job surviving that!
this is the most stressful series iv ever watched
Scar giving the villagers seeds to nibble killed me
How? freaking how?? And of course Scar of all ppl gets THREE trident lads on him! my heart man I can't take this, get some better armor PLEASE
Of course Scar goes straight for the enchanter! I guess some things never change.
bro I swear he's just trying to give is heart attacks
Skeleton is deadly creeper destroys base
I'm pretty sure Grian was the Boogeyman for this episode
Anyone else notice the pillager in the background at 20:18?
I just want to see Philza Minecraft react to the reckless way Scar plays hardcore
For the first time his name makes sense😂🤣🤣
The fact that you went down to 2-3 almost three separate times in under five minutes scares me, Scar
Literally no one believes in scar
It was worse in third and last life
Scar: Uploads Hardcore Episode My Anxiety: /  Your hardcore series is very entertaining to watch! Always has me at the edge of my seat XD
dude when he jumped at 10:53 i nearly had a heart attack   he barely made it lmao
I think this is the first time of ever seen Scar pay attention to his health bar
This was the worst video to watch to relax after work.
i think i’m understanding why grian screams SCAR so desperately all the time. i nearly had about eight heart attacks watching this, thanks
Scar in Last Life: dies by swimming up a water column.  Scar in Hardcore Minecraft: constantly cheats death
Everytime I watch Scar's 100 hours in hardcore my heart is always skipping a beat
If you don't like the way your farms are now you could make them spiral up the cliff side.
16:31 That cow took a hit for you
MY ANXIETY- THIS IS A HARDCORE WORLD SCAR YOU ARE STRESSING ME OUT DO NOT DIE
I actually think scar has a chance of surviving
The unbarrelable wall in a gorgeous gorgeous.
Scar continues to make the most chaotic decisions even in hardcore
21:03 "I am now holding my meat, and my axe is in my offhand" - Scar it just doesn't get any better than that
Scar has now officially survived hardcore longer than pearl has :D
The Three Tridents... Omg.
This is not 100 hours in hardcore is call scar make everyone stressful
Scar you should try and get a lucky rabbits foot to help you get to 100 hours
I loved it all even if it was hard to watch without having a small heart attack. Amazing Scar!
It is times like this if I wonder if scar wants to survive 100hrs in hardcor
Episode two of hardcore Minecraft with scar?? Its a miracle!
0000000:
11:02 AAAAAHHHH?????!?!?
Baby zombies are the worst!!!!!
I want this seed!! It would be so fun to play and  in this area!
The most anxiety inducing minecraft episode I've seen.
dude scar never fails to amaze me with his builds and terraforming skills like wow that cliff looks so amazing with all the farms and pathways AND THE HOUSE AS WELL like  s i r  this is so beautiful
Any good gorge needs an airship and an airship dock.
Scar should make a little village to store any villagers he has that at the top of his mountain
I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I am SWEATING
A mob of angry players is what I fear. (I am a server moderator)
Your builds take my breath away every time! I love the hanging tree it is so cool!
Ok I’ll just watch this and relax before bed, it’ll be nice and cal— OH GOD SCAAAARR
Watching scar play hardcore is stressful lol
This has been the most stress i've felt in a long time
Would love you build a fence on the path to Grian’s base. Maybe screen some of those Drowned trident throwers.
For the love of good scars, please make another shield. We all would love to see you survive this gameplay world. #manyheartattacks
Anxiety attack, panic attack, heart attack, repeat. 😩😮‍💨
Create a pond or something to do with wtaer Bellow your base, seeing scar jumling off is scary, and also make a Golden apples in case of emergency + Fire resistance potion also water buckets or snow in a bucket incase of falling and always bring them
OMG Scar that jump, I closed my eyes and all XDD
Scar is just there almost dieing with barely tools and armor while jole and grain are in full Netherite killing the ender dragon and now have elytras
We believe in you, Scar! XD Loving the series and the dynamic of the server. Please promise us that if you ever get an elytra you'll keep your eyes straight ahead XD
Nothing was more funny then when he swiped the enchanter, again, and tried to copy Grians Voice
This man's gonna give me a heart attack
I think it would be cool to add these things:  1. A large rope bridge 2. if no rope bridge, then a large train track crossing the canyon for the minecart. maybe its broken in the middle? 3. A cool cave that has some beast laying inside 4. Ballons? 5. A cool clay building city on the side of the cliff (based on pueblo)
Youre base is so lovely
Hey Scar love the video. Maybe add waterfalls going down your farms layers just to add a little bit more depth to them PS good job on surviving the drowned attack
I am most afraid of drowned zombies with tridents. *shivers*
Scar you can't keep scaring us like that
I didn't think it was possible but I do believe you just gave me 2nd hand anxiety Scar. Mah heart phew
If love to see you defeat the dragon
“Oh no! He dead! Do I get his villagers?”
This truly puts a smile on my face... Best of entertainment there is!
What do you thing will be the death of scar everyone who is reading this  Me: death of fall damage
I am convinced scar is trying to die with all the hairy situations he gets into
Goodtimeswithanxiety
yaaay hi scar i like ur voice. i bet you will die last if im honest if you beleive in yourself
The place is look is looking so cool.  100 hours, Scar - you got this!  I'm rooting for you!  <3
OMG SCAR I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT THE WHOLE EPISODE
Scar if you keep doing 10 hours per video then we can only have 10 episodes of content  please if you can do less  hours  so we can have more content please
This whole episode was just Scar taunting the grim reaper with chicken noises and then barely jumping out of the way whenever he makes a swipe at him
love the Jango Fett reference
lol the pillagers I keep seeing in the background at his base.
With the mine railway path you should put water in the andesite stairs and make the water flow off into the water below, that might look super cool.
What happened to Scar’s dog he just got at the end since last we say it was on a singular flying trapdoor just above death
Scar likes living on the wild side, the edge, one mistake and it's ALL OVER!! Now I wanna make a cliff base in a hardcore world. xD
Alternative title. Montage of scar almost dying
Grains base is sus     Of course meaning sustainable
This is my most anticipated series while hermitcraft is off season. Keep up the great work Scar!
This is scarier than any horror movie ever made
@GoodTimesWithScar If you read this, You always make me laugh and have a fun time with watching you're video's.😃 -I hope you have a nice day.😁
Your base looks amazing
You definitely have me on the edge of my seat. Keep up the amazing content!
"Not going to lie we all most died there" wow my heart whent to my feet 😬
wow, sry but like if impulse makes it I will be shocked
Creepers are terrifying, they don't just kill you, they also destroy your stuff, skeletons are chumps, just run up in their face and beat them to death with a sword.
scar, might be a good idea to remove that tree blocking part of the river below your diving board. wouldnt want to die by accidentally landing on leaf blocks
Scar: what mob scares you the most? Me: yo mama
It's not a mistake, it's ✨ A MASTERPEICE!✨
10:54 SCAR SCAR SCAR YOU ARe GOINg T O KILl ME
18:55 is it just me that feels weird when looking at scar without his hat? He just looks so bald and empty without it.
Why is the tip of the tree drooped? you should hang the house from the top of the tree so it is more realistic! either way It looks amazing
Skelllllllllllllllies are horrable
I for one fear creepers the most
I think that scar will die before 50 hours
Scar I'm thinking you would not survive ep 5 or 15 at most. But my bet is you'll die at the end of the 100 hour mark.
I’m not sure when was the last time you watched Jurassic park but your impression of the music needs a bit of work.
Welcome to part 2 of ‘Scar gives us anxiety’
The Creepers are the worst braking builds
Love you scar you'll complete the 100 hours
Please remove the land from under your house so you have more of a safe landing
21:04  why
Hey scar, can u plz start saying “hello there, miners and crafters… GoodTimesWithScar here and welcome back to another video…..” again please! I miss that intro
For stairs down to the mine you could make a big whole with a mine craft track coming out which then breaks off about 20 blocks out of the mountain and at the bottom of the gorge you could put a destroyed mine craft
Scar is the most entertaining in this series because he is constantly so close to dying
You know, i know Joel and Grian made some very competent, attractive builds, but it doesn’t have the mad genius of building a hanging platform made of trapdoors above a death drop on hardcore
Omg Scar! You're seriously stressing me out! 😂😂😂 Love your builds! They're so beautiful!
This is nearly as stressful as Breaking Bad and the Walking Dead.
why doth scar not have blocks on his hotbar?
I am not sure if I can watch this series. I really want to and I really don't want to! SOOOOO much anxiety! And all three of you are doing some risky things man! That minecart on the edge is perfect Scar! You could put a mini rock (or ressource) mountain below the minecart as if it is throwing it down while you dig deeper into the mountain. I really like that cliff build and your tiny house looks adorable! Maybe you can put some red tulips into your plantpots. I like them the most in minecraft :)
“Eat my mutton like a good boy” -Scar 2022 😂 😂
This is the most stressfull hardcore video i've seen
My anxiety levels are through the roof
The Minecraft Gods are protecting scar it is the only explanation for him lasting more then ten hours without death
Most feared; Magmacube on hard mode. Legitimately has killed me SO many times.......v.v
just a warning, sometimes boats glitch when you land and ends up killing you :((
Scar’s Grian impression cracks me up 🤣
I this point I’m just wondering how scar is still alive
Scar for the walking part where u walk on the side of the cliff u should get some of those purple crystal blocks and calcite and stuff and make a cool walk way! It would look so cool to see that “carved” into the side of the mountain!
this series stresses me out but i love it
It’s also a fjord
Id scar wouldnt accidentally placed the boat at 10:34 he would be dead, becaise the boat blocked one trident and a few seconds later he got away wirh 1.5 hearts
this is  a 24 minutes video that gives me anxiety....
Every time he jumps off that plank I get a mini heart attack
the new base looks amazing. I'd move in instantly :D the only thing I'd change is build a flimsy hanging bridge to connect the house to the mountain, instead of the one you've got, so it looks a lot more like the house is really just hanging from the tree.
You can decorate it like a hobbit hole interior
I sure love watching heart attacks with sca- I mean good times with scar of course
Scar quotes for the day Scolding cold water  They are trying to get in the door so I shall make the door not a door
bro your base looks so gosh dang cool!! I love it!  :D
Scar scar scar, what a beautiful man, charismatic, charming, a man that can take a starter base in a hardcore series put so many peoples regular builds to shame, a man so strong he went from a champion swimmer to the worlds most beloved minecrafter, a man that can make everyone around him smile with so little effort, someone who puts effort & love & care into everything they do, someone who has their own battles and will still stand by your side with the power of a billion angry suns scar, truly, is a wonderful guy  But i think we can all agree, no one thought he'd get this far into the series (/joking /teasing /affectionate)
I'm calling it now, scar is gonna die to that hanging base
i fear skeletons the most since creepers are pretty easy to escape but skeletons just shoot you constantly
Watch. Even after today Scar is going to complete this series while building absolutely beautiful structures along the way. He's gonna make us all look like chumps. Good luck Scar
"I'm now holding my meat" That's making it into the "scar is WHAT" playlist!
SCAR YOUR GIVING ME A HARD ATTACK!!!!!!
Scar: do bat man music... i mean the one with the man with the cane... i mean like Jurassic park! also scar: starts to hum harry potter
Did he say "Don't subscribe" at the end there?
Don't forget the path from Grian's base to yours.  Scar, your builds never cease to amaze me.
I think you can go up and down the glowing hanging thing wich grow in lush cave (i forget what it's call ^^') but maybe you can use it for not allways having lader
The moment I saw trident man I thought it was over, those things are terrifying.
“Did you say enchonting?” 🤣  I’d say skeletons are the most dangerous mobs (aside from enderman if agro’d). And creepers are just destructive and annoying
Some comment told me that GoodTimesWithScar's hardcore series was a nice and relaxing part to their day...I've literally been so stressed watching these last two episodes with every near death experience scar has encountered!
I LOVE this series!
Scar, you made me so tense watching you caving. Though I probably WOULD HAVE died in that position.
Scar - you are just incredible in so many ways!!! Thank you :)
Scar I have little to no hope in you for surviving    Does make it entertaining tho
Hoooh! feel like i will be having heart attack for the last few minutes of the video. What are u doin to us Scar 😕 hahahaha! 😂
I love the way he says 100 hours *pause* hardcore Minecraft
Scar is here to prove that all of his deaths in HermitCraft are intentional for comedic effect.
My man too much drip. Literally look death in the eye and spits on death's face
Just terraform my guy. Save all your viewers some heart attacks.
Give it give grand in chanting table back for your biggest hater
connect the sides with a western style mining bridges
The most feared mob...       Baby Zombie
Scar...please be more careful! You are scaring me every second of this...  I am rooting for you to make it the full 100 hours but I still feel like you could lose any second and that scares me
Me every other minute, checking how much longer is in the video to assure myself scar won't die in this moment
Scar, this is one of the most exhausting and hilarious episodes you have ever made. I was stuck between a heart attack and laughing my lungs out. Good job bro
I think it would be cool if he had a suspended cage hanging off the cliff that held villagers, like some sort of prison.
Watching Scar playing hardcore is like a rollercoaster of emotions omg
Scar u give me so many heart attacks
When that gravel fell, my heart fell with it 😂
Who would win? a) a creative genius who's survived for hours on end in a dangerous world filled with trident-wielding undead and steep cliffs                 or b) a bunch of berry boys
this server has a problem with trident drowned spawn. Grian got more than 10 tridents in his first episode because of all of the trident drowned that spawn near his base.
oh and glowberries are eatable and climbable
hes holding his WHAT....
Dude! 3 trident guys? I am seriously impressed with you escaping them. Your base is looking so amazing. You are doing great in this hardcore series.
Something has to have happened to the spawn chances because every single Drowned between Scar and Grian has had a Trident.
scar's pov can just be summed up in two words: condensed anxiety
Scar has the luck of a cartoon character i swear
Sneakiest enchantment table theft lol.
skeletons are the worst!!
As someone who often plays without audio, creepers are so scary!
Not me checking how long the episode is in the middle of it because he’s in a cave at three hearts. Na-ah. Not me.
10:42 scar didnt get achievment  for dog HMM
Each episode of this series will cost me 10 years because of the stress your causing me. You want suggestions? Sleep through the nights I beg of you. Just carry a bed around and bdubs it a lil bit. For all our sakes.
Scar if you make it 2 100 days I will buy one of each of your merch next time you drop new ones
The way Scar’s tree base has a trapdoor floor, fence gate sides, 100’s of blocks up, treacherous climb, we’re proud of you Scar 😆
drinking game where you take a shot every time scar almost dies
21:05 Scar that seemed sus...
i  may jinx it, but it feels like i could call this series "GoodTimesWithPlotArmor"
Did I just see a floating block
Watching this is the most stressful experience I have ever been through. More suspenseful than any horror movie.
Omg the jump on 11:00 killed me
Does anyone else hear that buzzing sound in the background???
to do: not die
its creeper i fear most
Scar is terrifying. I thoroughly expected him to die so many times throughout this video. My heart, y'all. 😂😅
This series is just scar gives every one anxiety and the fact that it is one life makes me more anxious and screaming scar a lot more whenever he does anything
Get an eleytra
i think u should get better armer
havent ever been this scared for someone in a hardcore series. hed make a new one if he lost right?
This episode was so bad for my heart 😂😂😂
I love your videos!
Hope you hang in there , love your vids and antics 😎👍
This episode 😅 the close calls!! But your base looks amazing
Bet on which hr scar is gonna die 1)23 hr- 32hr 2)32hr-42hr 3)42hr-52hr 4)52hr-62hr 5)62hr+ 6)He Will Complete The Challenge ❤
Scar are you going to minecon this year
I like how hardcore slows you down so I can keep up a little better.
SCAR NEED I REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS A HARDCORE WORLD PLZ STOP JUST WALKING OFF CLIFFS!
Lol.  You can always depend on Scar for a good old enchanter caper.   The scariest mob for me is witches 😵‍💫
How he's not dead, lol. Scar really loves danger!
20:53 spitting absolute BARS. Someone needs to sample that
When scar jumped off it almost gave me a heart attack. SCAR STOP IT
Is scar a bird because his house looks like a birdhouse
By far the most stressful of all the hardcore series.  The dichotomy of beautiful builds and perpetual sense of impending doom keeps me awake at night.
0:07 missed opportunity to say "gorgeous gorge"
scar, you are having a hard enough time surviving as is. please stop making unnesecary risks like jumping off your house when you can barely reach the water. hahahaha
Scar please don't let this series end. This is the most entertaining hardcore series I've seen and it's only 2 episode's in. I'll be so sad if you don't make it to 100 hours.
I think they call it 'rowing the plank?'
HOW IS HE YOU ALIVE he never looks at his health
I feel like I never appreciated how accident prone scar was until this episode. Now I fully understand y grian thought going to do stuff wo him was for his safety xD 💜
_spoiler_   I can’t believe Scar was saved by falling into a random hole. I thought that was how he would die.
you can feed the zombie flesh to the dog to get his health up (very nice use for zombie flesh)
Oh man, I don't know how many times I almost had a heart attack watching this! I really hope that Scar makes it to the 100 hour!
on grians video he was surprised you made it long enough to get full iron armor
You should extend the river to make a lake under your base
Scar, why not use this as an opportunity to learn how to replay mod works?
Scar how do you join a hardcore world, survive twenty hours when you wake up method is to jump of a cliff
Im still Surprised Scars lasted this long
Nice video
What’s the seed for this world?
i am amazed scar are alive and it makes every episode more fun to watch 👍😃
Baby zombies are the worst. And if they made baby creepers it would make me stop playing minecraft.
My gosh, my heart was in my THROAT from the triple trident threat-- I thought for sure that Scar was a goner
I think you’ll get to 99 hours and 59 minutes.                Plus one
Do you know about greens video on secret bases why not use that video to make a secret base in his bace LOL
Did anyone else miss heard the word Portal? 😅 No? Just me? I'll be going now....🤣
diD YoU sAY EnChaNtIng?
10:53 MY HEART FELL IN MY STOMACH
You need to add wooden slabs on the floor so you don’t die
"you never know when a skeleton's gonna shoot you off a cliff" *immediately gets shot off a cliff by a skeleton *
I fear wither skeletons the most
One word „anxiety“ all said 😂
When he says ‘HARDCORE minecraft’ It remind me of ‘OPERATION AQUATHUNDER’
Is Scar secretly the greatest Minecraft player?  I think he has been fooling us all this time.
Alternate title: try not to get anxious over Scar act
I believe in Scar and hope he will survive but I swear he will give me a heart attack with the way he's playing lmao
creepers are the most destructive so them
Scar: happy with his tree house Grian and Joel: Get netherite armor and defeat the ender dragon
ONE BLOCK!! ARE YOU MAD! your gonna last to ep 3 is my bet.
According my stats the mob that has killed me the most are Magma Cubes at 25 deaths... I remember this being because of the nether perimeter I was digging for my gold farm that was partially in a basalt delta. It was a battle to not forget. I basically and unintentionally made a ghast and magma cube arena while I was trying to dig it all out. Haha. I got some epic screenshots of everything on fire and me avoiding many ghast fireballs during it... noted to self... do not dig at 2am when unable to sleep. deaths will occur
you should build something with a spoopy theme like "the haunted woods" or something
That new base is so beautiful Scar!
Creeper!!
im guessing if scar dies it will be from face planting with the wings.
I fear crepers
i like its basically hermitcraft but with 3 people and hardcore
I'd love to see a pirate ship in that large cave you found
Im Building just know an Underground Red Temple with Throne Room, An you Scar gave me the Insperation of a Proper Roof for my built. The Tempel lies on Level -40 underground. IN a Deepslate Cavern. In Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
I'd liked the other house better
Always a great lunch break at work when you can watch a video from Scar during it. 🥳
Scar kept me on my toes the whole episode 😟😅  Btw Scar, thanks for your cheerful and funny content!!! I can’t wait to see your next heart racing episode!
I think some parrots would look cool on the the base
Every time I watch Scar I am immensely happy with just who he is as a person. Ya know, the type of person who when Mumbo Jumbo asks for some quick advice on building, he pulls out the art books. The reason his name is Goodtimewithscar is not because you only get one good time with Scar, but because Scar is always a good time. inb4 (is this still a thing?): not wholesome comments. Y'all know what I mean. Be civilized, there's children in this comments section.
Owen Wilson moment at 2:35
the wither on bedrock (12:00)
Idk how you do it Scar! It seems like everything you make is just so gorgeous! Great work!
So panic inducing, but keep up the good work!!
All I want is more guard rails.
I think Scar has played this game enough that he knows when to fight, hide or run.  I think this episode proves it.
"is this just what it's called, the walking the plank thing?"  the plank, scar. it's called the plank.
You did it again, you made the coolest base ever! (I might have paused the video to gush over it)
Scar: Your my friend, NOW KILL THIS MAN
Shields honestly make skeletons and creepers equally not a problem, no arrow damage, no blast damage  However skeletons can't blow up your build, so there's that
Make a axolotl Lagoon themed storage room.
Can we just appreciate that the game trys to kill scar in so many diffrernt ways but scar just survives
“Now that we’re friends, kill this man”
Theres no way scar survived those caves.  That was close.  You are improving scar.
Scars playing like it's a commitment he's trying to get out of 🤣 though sods law says he's the only one to make it to 100hrs 👍🤣
Anxiety! Look out!!! Oh no.... AHHHHH.... Eat Eat Eat!!! Don't Jump!!!! I think that was what I was thinking most of the time.
💖
How. Did. He. Survive that triple trident?!
"Oh nooo I just killed the man!!!!! Do I get his villagers????" I almost peed myself laughing 😂
scar is going to die by clipping one of those blocks next to the river when he jumps off his house. can't wait to see how long it takes before then
If you're gonna live life on the edge, may as well do it in style. Stunning builds as always.
hey Scar, remember mobs don't break blocks ^^  during that double trident incident I noticed you had no blocks on your bar :P
This is THE MOST stressful minecraft series I have ever seen
Scar! AAAAAH! The ANXIETY!!!!
Sorry I have to.... " I'm holding my meat and my axe in my off hand." - Scar 01.22  The life of every Bro i know.
baby zombies are the worst they end hardcore worlds 😅
That whole episode stressed me out
Scar.... wow, just wow. Love it man you have such a unique style of building.
The real question is not "how long will Scar last this series", but "how long will the audience survive the panic attacks everytime he's down to a few hearts"😅
a lot of people doubt scar would last the 100 hs, but he has already survived longer in a hardcore series that Pearl. Also, living by a river is the most dangerous location this update, the amount of trident drowneds is insane, i started a world this update and i already have a shulker full of tridents just because they keep attacking me when i come out of my home
Im stealing this farmland pads. Its too genious
5:00 Then Mumbo pulls out end crystals and a lava bucket
scar, you are such a menace, lol
Baby zombies are the bane of my existance, but early game Creepers is definately the thing that murders me the most. Skeletons are easy, just block and boop xD  Next episode should definately be Scar vs the Ender Dragon!
I love the swinging house.. it looks like the same style as the swagon😊
rabbits, i fear rabbits the most
21:26 YOOOOOOOOOO that looks epic!
Well hello there
Scar:  Using his cooked food to heal his dog when their was rotten flesh which was just one slot over 14:19 Me:  "sighs" ohh scar,  well thats scar for ya
the STRESS!!!
What happened to the dog
Add a withered railing on the walk way to the house I think that would look cool for late game you could add some big statues under the bace in the cliff face to look like they are holding it up or the bace is resting on it (and could u call the cat Milo plz as he looks similar to my cat and he is called milo)
Not going to be able to sleep tonight after all those close calls.
Scar needs some sort of enticing business aimed at Grian and Joel, preferably something with a sliiiiight chance of death.
episode 5 to fall damage I'm calling it.....
“Who know the archenemy of this series would be a berry bush?” Scar, the archenemy of this series is you, yourself lol
Scar dies ep 4 by fall damage
This is the definition of living life on the edge Literally
I bet scars gonna pull an underdog win and complete the 100 hours👍
This is stressed out the series. I mean, this is a completely scar unsafe series :D
omg this series is making me anxious XD
What is the timelapse song?
Yoooooooooo hiiiiiii yesssss goooooo runnnnnnn
When his shield broke in front of 2 drowned, I thought he was done for sure. Especially when then 3rd came too
Scar you got to find a Jelly cat before the end of the 100 hours!
SCAR! PLEASE TAKE A BED WITH YOU ON YOUR ADVENTURES SO YOU CAN SLEEP THE NIGHT AWAY AND NOT DIE FROM THE MOBS THAT SPAWNED THE NIGHT BEFORE, YOU WORRY ME SICK
Make a dog army so you wont have problems with mobs also u gave me a lot of heart attacks so please survive and reach 100 hours because its fun to watch
It still boggles my mind that Scar somehow survived everything that happened this episode:0
i am just dumbfounded how he survived that episode.
Epic base... Now go and steal Grian's villagers..🤣
Scar. Take all the gold and apples you have and turn them into golden apples. Keep them at the ready for when the next trident army arrives.
heres a reminder YOU ARE PLAYING HARDCORE
hardcore you gotta take your bed with you!
Grian: there is no pvp  Scar: *dying of laughter*  Also Scar: oh wait there isn’t?
Beautiful gorge? Why don't you call it... gorge-ous?
Scar my adrenaline is through the roof thanks to you
How
This was horrific to watch
Good luck with this! Your videos always make me feel da happi
When it comes to hard-core I'm afraid of the stray mainly due to the fact that it can shoot you slowing you down and shoot you more.
Superhero name: Scar Scar Sinks
Scar, I'll challenge you to steal next Hermitcraft Season everyone their enchantingtables they place
Very funny ep. 😆 Lucky too. Great builds as always. Looking forward to the next ep.
You just love making think that your gonna die
Holding my phone like a stress ball.
Managing to both survive all of that madness and build an amazing base at right after, Scar has got some unique talents!
episode 1: full iron episode 2: 1/2 iron and (because he he stole it from grian) basic enchants
You should probably remove the islands immediately below your base, so if you jump off of it again, you remove the risk of landing on very solid leaf blocks.
Since Scar asked, the worst mobs for me as skeletons sometimes, othertimes phantoms, but basically any of the baby varients of zombies. Trident throwers in general suck, but especially the baby ones do too, namely when don't have the proper gear or armor to fight them.
watching scar play hardcore must be one of the most anxiety inducing activities
That’s amazing HARDCORE Minecraft
My heart rate is SPIKING, THE DANGER
This video makes me so incredibly anxious
Trident drowneds are so nasty even with full diamond, so having to deal with them as you were would be terrifying. I'm actually impressed you survived that one!
Does anyone else see the artic fox in the background at 19:57
I almost died. Watching scar almost getting killed aaaa
So. Much. STRESS!
Wouldn’t it be cool if scar hearted my comment?
I belive in you scar, you can do it!
Standing still surely is an unusual strategy to use against a firing squad of drowned
Scar's base here reminds me of the village from "Laputa". Just me?
Prediction scar will die on episode 3 or 4
"I can show you the world, Grian!"
10:54 scar why?!
Scar secretely has no problem staying alive and is about to blow everyone's minds staying alive!
This is video is just pure anxiety and I love it 🤣
You really brought me back to when I was a kid when you said wrapping paper tubes as lightsabers. 😮😁
Lol at scar imitating Grian
regarding scariest mobs, witches terrify me  also, who would have thought the series most dangerous element was berry bushes? Maybe the same viewers who saw you feud with panda bears in S7? lol
please...just dig all the part next to the river and "enlarge" the river so you can jump (and fall) safely ahhah
Hello to you wandering through the comments
Not really sure if I am hoping for a successful 100 hours or "Scar fell from a high place" ... But I guess, no matter how the series works out, I'll win!
scar please make it past episode three i bet my friend a dollar you would. I BELIEVE IN YOU PLEASE
Scar will die on the last episode and not complete the 100 hours.
Build a huge tree with a railway going through it
There's some buzzing in the background
I love this series but I really don’t look forward to seeing it end after 1000 hours
I adore the kind of steampunk/whimsical vibe Scar's been going for lately. So much fun, and so pretty!
I had a really bad anxiety episode today, but this video really made my day. I love your videos, even in hardcore you maintain you fun and whimsical attitude.
How is someone else playing Minecraft so stressful
Your place looks amazing! Just stop taking our breath away!
Idea : if you do t want to die then make a lake under you base
Never change. You are highly entertaining.
Does anyone else hear a weird noise in the backround?
scar hardcore is tenser than 90% of the thriller/horror movies I've watched
i would love the timer for hermitcraft too because it'll show just how much time these episodes take
Idare you to make bridge to the other cliff
How this series is going to end:  _GoodTimewithScar was pricked to death by berry bush_
I used to not worry about creepers anymore. Now I fear them
Holy moly scar how can you do that.  I was literally on the edge of my seat  afraid that you would die 🤣
This man has earned an subscirber
10:30 such a Scar 32 Seconds
Loving this series so far but ngl I get soooo anxious every time there's a near-death!! Please be careful Scar! Love you <33
10:30 such a Scar 32 Seconds
Grian: Gets 5-10 good comments Scar: Gets comment section full of good comments idk what this is
Grian: there's no pvp  Scar:*waits like 10 seconds. Oh there's no pvp.
pssst scar.... use the axe when u got a dog ;) wont accidentally take your dog out of existence with the swords built in sweeping edge lol it can naturally hit more than one thing at a time where as an axe will only hit the thing you have targeted
Me this whole episode: AAAAAAAHHHH
Alternative title: A Million Ways to die in Hardcore
I'd love to watch you live stream a hardcore series like this on twitch. I bet it's hilarious :D
everytime scar says "HARD CORE" i can imagine an overly excited scar bumping his fists in the air.
If you fall into berries, STOP MOVING, it DOESN'T DAMAGE then
You know what. I think these 3 guys are going to grab hold of a miracle. And come out the other side much better at surviving this game
I think vex is worst mob
Scar, you madman, you doofus, you wonderful human being... in the name of Jellie, STOP JUMPING OFF OF CLIFFS
Good vibes with Scar and his jukebox
Scar : What mob do you fear the most? 7 year old: SCAR!!
This build is stunning! Your talent and artistry is amazing. Thank you for sharing it (and your positivity) with us.
13:00 woah, that's insane! Holy heck!!!!!
why did scar quote jango fett
Scar, hon, if your main goal cause gasps in your fandom, you're doing great!
Oh my god sir
creeper
U can try and to ur own lush cave or even do ur one cave biome.
Baby zombies are the scariest by far. Especially when in full armor!
The way you keep jumping off cliffs without looking for water is giving me *anxiety*, Scar!!!  If your luck keeps up, I believe you can make it to 100 hours. But if the recklessness keeps up, I can’t make any promises that my faith will keep up. 😅
Scar WHY
Im calling it. Scar is gonna die in his base by doing something risky
Scar your video is really good, I like it very much BUT YOURE GONNA GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK WITH THESE MOVES PLEASE
omgggggg my heart can’t take Scar playing Hardcore…… I can’t 😭😭😭 plssss Scarrrrr be carefulll
when i say that i nearly had a panic attack when Scar walked off his base-  i think you guys are underestimating him, he can do it! (those words are gonna come back and bite me-)
Do you remember when you called creepers Bob the Creeper Building Inspector?
absolut madlad you are :D
How did you survived 3 drowneds with trident
Yeah you know what, now I AM scarred for life
Put a waterfall under your base please
I love how scar treats his community so well and is one of the only content creators who do it
Those farms would look so awesome with a waterfall running through them
You're giving me heart attacks when you are in a cave with 2 hearts that is full of monsters and fight instead of running away. I wouldn't be surprised if this is how you'll die
Get the achievement caves and cliffs that would be so funny to see
me throughout this entire episode…  [grian voice]: *sCAR!!*
the only reason im tolerating the stress of watching scar do hardcore is bc hes such an amazing builder
Holy cow Scar, you're over a fifth, and nearly a quarter, of the way there 0_0
Scar: this cave is not scar safe Me; nothing is scar safe😂
I feel like you’re only going to survive 3 episodes, 4-5 episodes at MOST and even that’s a stretch…
Forget about the first episode I didn't think Scar would survive the first five minutes.
Please stop jumping off into the water. It's giving me a heart attack!
this is what I was waiting for
Please be sure to build a very "safe" path for Grian and Tiny Heinz to visit
Scar I believe in you! you will make it surprisingly far
your base is amazing. I really love that
You make me sound like im hyperventalating with how often i was gasping watching you play
If scar likes this comment... Idk And the mob I gate the most: DEFINITELY THE CREEPER
is anyone else extremely concerned with the amount of lightning rods he has used in his build??? it rains so much in the new update, i feel it's unevitable for his house to be struck - repeatedly.
This video is stressful
Scar's builds are always so magical! Loving the series so far!
pls Scar how can you survive?
Scar. I love you. I bought merch from you over alllll of the other hermits. But I am not sure I can watch this series. You are causing heart palpitations…
Let me just say WOW real quick, not only for one thing, but two. Firstly, Your base is absolutely amazing. I love the style, and added with the height and beauty of the landscape makes it look beautiful. Secondly, You love scaring the mess out of us, I sure had a few moments. Love the series, Scar! Hope you're all well!
Wait Nemo has a brother?!!
Genuinely thoroughly enjoyed this!
Scars gonna die in the 35th hour
20:00 Is that a Star Wars reference, Scar?
I had a dream that you (in game) were messing around with grian and fell of a hill and died and thats how your playthrough ended... umm so good luck!
I loved every minute of it!  My favorite was when you started a time lapse with the music and everything and then shut it down - LOL.
i cant believe how many times Scar can almost die in a single episode
Every time scar jumps I check the length of the video🤣😂🤣
❤️❤️❤️ after 20+ heart stopping moments I totally enjoyed this!
I fear creepers the most. Any other mob I can easily combat or run from, but creepers will one-shot you if they catch you off guard.
for me it's skellies because they can shoot you at a distance, sure you have shields but if there are 2 from different directions you're toast, with a creeper he has to come close and if there are more than one they have to be close enough that you can block both with your shield.
The joy that enters my heart, when hear the music to, Super Fast Build Mode!       Unfortunately this wasn’t to long. :\
First episode I thought you can make a 100h. I definetly changed my mind
Scar: How'd I survive this?!  Literally everyone: YEAH HOW?!
watching scar play hardcore is like watching a creeper slowly approach you when you're in a two-by-one hole.
Nice little upgrade... What about an Airport, or something?  ;)
I hope your series makes it to 100 hours! GL!!
SCAR! TORCHES!
build idea 💡 try to make a copper factory that makes and sells armour
I love how Scar speaks like grian:  “Did he say enchanting?”
THIS IS SO ENTERTAINING! It's like watching a suspense movie
I don’t know how you are still alive Scar but I’m loving this series 😂😂
can you please put more water at the ground ? it you will shurly save your live !
Loony should join hermitcraft
You should make the cave path to your house a lush cave
21:05 ooc scar moment lol
I need to make an appointment with a Cardiologist after watching this episode.
This is the first time Scar cares about how much life he has.
.... 14 mins in and I think my BP is up
Amazingly my Swaggon shirt arrived right in the middle of watching this video. I love it!
Scar survived 3rd Life till the last minutes, despite all odds. If he can manage 100 Days in HARDCORE! Minecraft, I'll take that as a sign he's the luckiest person on Earth.
baby zombies are more terrifying
You visualize and create such fun detailed builds.  Love the cliff base!  Don't die too soon, I want to see what else you do with it!
this whole episode gave me anxiety lol
Plot twist:  Its the start of hermitcraft season 9 and the hermits find out they are all here 👀 who knows
Did you say enchanting?
i fear creepers the most, cus they ALWAYS sneak around and skeletons dont. once i even saw one going in a full circle to jump scare me instead of just exploading in my face
I cannot explain how much I appreciate Scar's existence.
Wow what an incredibly skilled Minecraft player! I've never seen anything like it...
Don't feed pillagers it emboldens them
There is nothing better in this world than Super Fast Build Mode
Good luck scar u got this 😁
Cave spiders are the scariest. They will frick you up
In the next ep, you should add a path to grians, and Joel’s houses, and maybe do a bridge across the canyon / revean/ grove? Loved the vid btw ❤️
I’m rooting for you Scar!! I need to take an aspirin watching you.
this episode was hilarious and i feel like i went through a rollercoaster of emotions during it, also, THE BASE IS LOOKING AMAZING SCAR!!!! :D
Watching scar in hardcore mode is really stressing out
That scared me so bad 😂
Scar, you build so well in such a short amount of time! Please please please tell me there will be a world download whenever this is done??😃😃
You gottaaaaa customize the river bed and make little custom trees/booooshes around it
SCAR, FOR THE LOVE OF NOTCH, BE MORE CAREFUL, PLEASE!
Not to sound rude, but me and my friends are betting witch day you might die. So next episodes, you know.
Who else is wondering when Scar’s gonna end the series with some ‘science’.
Skeletons are bad but i think creepers are way worse since they can not only kill you but also destroy your builds
Scar is like the baby that one movie who creeps all the way on a building under construction and is somehow saved every time
This is the most stressful Minecraft video I have ever seen! I loved it but my blood pressure….. Oof!
Creeper is the worst
Heart attack time with Scar! I'm scared!!
I went on a date with DREAMS SISTER in my latest video (Dream was mad lol😂)
We want the series to continue, so enchanted diamond armor with feather falling is the only answer for the next step.
Hello Scar! I have an official thing I'd like to see you do in the next episode: I'd like to see you use Grian's villagers to get a set of Protection 4 diamond armor, and feather falling boots. (That's the suggestion.)
21:06, guess he still hasn't put on his pants from Hermitcraft season 8! LMAOI!
Scar name tag an animal “Scar” and then kill it so that it looks like you died to prank everyone
I'm not sure if my anxiety disorder to can handle all of this 2 heart business LMAO!
scar, i love you, but why do you choose a hardcore series to make things hanging off cliffs
I can't believe Scar hasn't died yet. What if they cheat?
I love this series but how is scar still alive
Scar logic:  "Its hardcore so let's have a hanging base over a cliff."  All joking aside Scar is a great builder and is a master at organic builds even though Minecraft is blocky.  Keep it up!
Me anytime Scar does anything - So this is how it ends 😱
Its not a canyon its a valley I call it the scar-ry Valley
''i'm scared of my own face''   scar 2022
why is this man such a good builder (pin this bc why not)
10:54  Scar!!!
Scar: "I feel like I'll die if I move." *while being bombarded with tridents No Scar! You'll die if you DON'T move! Also Scar, please *never* take your shield out of your hotbar, and maybe even bring a backup, or enchant your shield with Unbreaking and Mending, because it is a LIFESAVER!
so many close calls, oh my goodness! For some reason that river in the area by Grian has the Curse of the Drown. I am glad you survived that ordeal.  maybe you could tame some axolotl to help you with drown in the future?  if you want to take a break from the caves you could always get diamond armor from the villagers.
Roses are red  Apples are good  Scar yo are such a noob(but pro in building)
your so amazing
Does Scar livestream these, and if so, where can I watch the full thing?
10:49 SCARRRR
21:05 You just know that this will be taken out of context.
The way Scar deals with Pillagers makes me think he's been attacked by a lot o geese in his life.
Me at first: anxious a creeper is gunna drop on his head.  Me now: everything is dangerous, put him in a bubble. who let him build on the side of a cliff omfg
Leaving with your head on your head and saplings in your pocket. I guess you have a hard time finding your head some days.
I swear as much as I love this, It gives me so much anxiety. Oh my god please Scar stay safe.
early game skeletons are the biggest threat lol
Baby zombie
agreed - skeletons are the most troublesome mob
Scar, I really enjoy your videos, but its et cetera (pronounced T) and not egg cetera. However, keep up the good vibes
In the over world I say skeletons at first, but then endermen. In the nether, I say wither skeletons and pigeon brutes, and in the end, of course the dragon
General Kenobi.
Not going to lie- this entire series while hilarious is giving me anxiety lol All the decisions made here are dangerous
watching scar playing hardcore is very very stressful
you can use corral fans as flowers for a dash of color if normal flowers seams to small. Just need to waterlog a topslab and place them on it.
At this rate we'll die before him from all the heart attacks he's giving us
Out of all the hermits I have a feeling Scar would be the most fun to play Minecraft with
cool idea: build a windmill out the side of the mountain, that would be cool  also i love your base in the series so far, cant wait to see how it turnes out at the end of the 100 hours!!
Every jump, ever fight, just makes me feel so stressed as one wrong move and we'll you know  (Two hearts!!!!!!!!)
10:11 umm did anyone else hear that
Everyone: “How are you not dead?!” Scar: “I HAVE NO IDEA!!!”
I didn't have anxiety until I watched this episode
After every Hermitcraft season you should show your stats
Throughout the entire video, I clung to the title to calm my heart
"axolotls are dangerous" really got me after that intense triple trident showdown . XD
I think my heart stopped several times
Dude, that was the most intense video I've seen in a while lol. Be more careful haha, tbf 3 trident jerks were crazy, good job escaping :P  Absolutely brilliant though, well done man.
Hey scar, once again an amazing video. By the way, it would be really cool if you made a watchtower on top of the gorge, also a way to see your base from far away.
Scar: Exists Skeleton: …and I took that personally.
Are you going to build this entire season aswell?
Idea: The minecart track should connect to the other side of the gorge !
I started watching Scar's videos out of curiosity and now I have the feeling that seeing a new video is like having a bad day and your favorite person in the whole world comes to bring you candy to cheer you up. I don't know if this make any sense, but I much appreciate Scar's effort ♡
I think scar has thick plot armor lol
pog
Scar: steals grians wheat because he’s running low on food.  Scar: throws bread at a pillager
Youve actually survived pretty well, i think you might actually make it to 100 hours
I love how scar uses the new materials to build new building ideas and decorating them so perfectly,love to see him not dying though 😂,but if u know scar u know he always spice things up🔥
I knew you would survive
you should let a little waterflow go through the farms :)
I feel like  despite all odds scar wont die first
Three water boys?!?!??!?! Life is cruel
My heart Scar 😭 oh and I love your base !!!
Omg this was so intense!!
His plot armour is even thicker than in 3rd life!
08:08 You make a lot of vert wierd noises
My poor heart JeBuS
For the cave entrance area to get to the house you should make it look magical by using amythist and stuff like that
Scar, why must you give us heart attacks. Are you planning to play  hardcore the most dangerous way their can be.  Although it would be funny if you keep this up and be the last one of the group to die or last the 100 hours.
scar doesn't just survive, he survives with style
scar needs some GEAR
To be honest, I didn't think you were surviving the first 6 mins.
I felt my soul leave my body at least 10 times this episode
Scar: 100 hours in minecraft!!!   Everyone else: *100 HOURS OF REPEATED HEARTATTACKS!!!*
haha you scared ME watching this more than you were scared hehe :D
It's not a mistake ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
Better question- how did you survive in general?
Im jus super excited to get my swaggon merch lol
Scar, you're a delight, but I have no bloody clue how the heck you managed to survive this episode XD
so pretty
The bedrock wither
prediction: 34 hours, 48 minutes and 17 seconds.
04:17 Why did you hive your dinner to the dumbledore?
Scar your an inspiration for amateur builders
I've got a new title for you: "Goodtimeswithscar Anxiety Compilation!" 😂
You should build a bridge across the whole canyon.
23 hours in! That’s almost 25% done and still alive!
My vote on the end of the series: death by fall damage
Kill the ender_dragon
Here i m taking a week just to buil one house n then there's ya. Loved the whole thing
When i saw this video come up my face lit up in a huge smile! Love this series❤❤❤
Skeletons have probably killed me more than creepers the amount of time I've died by getting shot of a mountain or in the nether by a skeleton is unbelievable. Also loving this series ☺️
I’m scared the boat glitch where it will accidentally kill you while flying in a boat let’s hope scar does not get it
Scar's hardcore series is VERY bad for my anxiety!!
Scar as a builder, I fear creepers the most. It’s like when you finish a nice build and then they blow it up, sooo annoying!
I want to say that he'll make it all the way but he's just not careful enough, I see a creeper is more dangerous than a skeleton concerning a creeper will blow up your chest if it's outside, at least with a skeleton if there's multiple of them you can get them to fight each other pretty easily.
:D nice
I fiel like a compilation of moments where scar was close to dying wouldn't have much be cut off
When you say hardcore edit a explosion on the screen.
other people in hardcore: get diamonds, get netherite, beat the enderdragon, build a bade but it's gotta be more practical and less pretty scar in hardcore: spends multiple hours just building the most beautiful starter base ever that is dangerous as F*CK while in half a set of iron armor
“I am now holding my meat” -Scar, 2022
when I saw an impulsesv video and scar video... hardest decision of my LIFE
21:23 I think that's the definition of "so I've done some building off camera"
Scar every time you jump off the diving board I get chills down my spine
I love unconventional Minecraft series. This series and the Skizz LP are my favorites.
I know how the series will end... Joel will try to kill Grain with a trap killing them both and Scar will the only one surviving
Scar's Hardcore pack: - live off the edge - jump over deep cave - get chased by mobs - almost drown - get pricked by bushes - 1 block away from death - steal/borrow other stuffs
9:20 Scar imitating Grians British accent... Excellent
Why is Joel   video private ?
SCAR!! This is hardcore! Hahaha....  I feel like I should be reminding you every minute!
The funny thing to me is that he out survived pearl
so much pucker
Silverfish. Hit them once before you have diamonds and you get swarmed by those terds
I think that you need a phew of Grians mending books
I think I just lost half of my remaining lifespan after watching this 😂😂😂
I love that little giggle he does every now and then, it sounds like a cheery "hm-hmm!" :D
I kinda miss the danger swing :( but the farms mine and other buildings look so cool
Everytime Scar says "Hello there." i just wanna go "General Kenobi." XD
considering all the near death experiences so far, I really don't know if you can make it, but this is fun as hell to watch and I'm loving it so please try to stay alive
I can count on one hand how many times I got shot off a cliff by a skeleton ... It's not fun. Good luck friend. Signed  DavidXZ
I don't even know how many times I panicked about you dying in this episode. You need to be put in a bubble for your own safety! ._.
There we're wayyyyyy to many close calls in this video! Forget scar safe, be more safe scar!
love the boba fett quote🤣🤣
Can someone keep a count of Scars near deaths? I think he's already near 10
This is the most dangerous hardcore series ever, and I am living for it!  It looks like everyone is having a blast playing... especially Scar.
Grian and Joel have netherite.
What about setting up some safe havens in surrounding areas eg by lush cave, on the other side of the gorge, wherever you may want to explore, so if you ever get low again you have some to escape. Mini tree houses in the forests/jungles?... Love you building! 💚
22:05 Skizzleman, that's who.
Please don't die.
I want to see you install functional railings on your farms, lol. I worry for you Scar, I worry.
Your gonna die next episode
I fear creepers every time I build a pause to get snack i  look be[!!!Giant explosion!!!] that took  five minutes to build!!!!!! >:(
A skeleton followed by a drop creeper (drop creeper when they fall from a ledge)
We found Nemo! and his brother!
It's scary watching Scar playing in a hardcore world.
While in a boat you take zero fall damage.
Scaaar, why not steal some cows from joel or grian? :)
I feel like this ep should start with a warning for those with a weak heart lol
I love how scar's house is basically a death trap. The man is living on the edge. It gives me anxiety, but I love it.
Scar, I love the series, but quit scaring us! I don't want to see you die in this series!
You could just speed up the footage of you placing blocks with some fun cute music
This video gives me anxiety
Hey Scar, Grian and Jole went to the End already! You should go to the end and get shulker boxes and an elytra
Is he dead? Can I take his villagers… what a good Idea take his villagers.
The odds that were still able to watch this series is astronomical
Baby zombies are nightmare material. Some call them The Destroyers Of Worlds.
I love this series so much. its the worst possible thing for scar to attempt and I'm living for it.
Scar is dead in episode 2
This vid will gonna kill me. Almost got a heart attack. You almost died nth times. Fighting Scar! You'll gonna make it. Your builds are interesting. Hoping to see  moreee
I fear the Skilyting
This series is not good for my anxiety 😅🙃
Scar please, hit the enemies,  you wouldn't have to worry about them breaking your shield or getting hit while running away if you just kill the enemies.
“Now you’re my friend, kill this man.” -GoodTimesWithScar, 2022
My scrunkly
10:56 ngl, my sphincter just clenched so hard I think I broke it.
Is scar’s house supposed to be a snail ?
Whhhhhyyyy
PRO-TIP just accept he dies immediatly; all the content we get is just a bonus.;)  Really enjoy this series Scar!! I love how you threw out the rulebook about hardcore and just went for it.
Who else is waiting for Scars house to kill him?
Scar wars
Dcarcwars
At least scar replenished the seeds
I almost had a heart attack watching you  running from those drowned!! The Goodtimes never ends!!
WHY WHY WHY!!!! Of all the places to build a base Scar! a Clifff!!!! Sure you don't want to build a bedrock floor base? so we don't die of anxiety every episode :lol:
Please just clear the islands under the house. I'm losing it over here XD
Who is Dream beside Scar? xD
This video is proof, that Scar has plot armor in this series
We thought scar was playing hardcore Minecraft, but instead he’s playing heart attack simulator with us! Please be more careful!
You can do it Scar! Even if you are the master of death
Calling it now Scar will either not make it past hour 30 or make it exactly to hour 97
So scar Grain has been dealing with about five to six trident drowned shooting at him on the reg and just two nearly take you out? Get Dimond gear bro fast! They helped grain out a lot. He also was questioning why the number of trident drowned was so high.
it would be cool to use the geode blocks and stuff to make the new caves into a dwarf mine or something
Scar, I'm going to tell you how to deal with Drowned that have tridents... Run away if you don't have at least fully enchanted diamond armor.
Why doesn't this series have the jumpscare tag!
Which mob?  Witch mob.  Even full enchanted Netherite, poison and slowness in the wrong situation will end you.
Heart attack every single min... :)
1 second in and I’ve already had a heart attack
You got this! I believe in you!
Skellies are the scariest for me early-game because of the ranged weapons and the knockback which can make you fall off a cliff. And trident drowned are even worse
I'm sure Scar could sell sand in a desert and make it sound like a good deal.
YOU CAN DO IIIT ..... i hope
Comment pr like this if you think he will die before hour 50
Skeleton for sure are the worst
This the most nerve racking Minecraft series out rn I swear lmao, but skelly Bois are my mortal enemy. I hunt creepers down, but skelly Bois...nah I run
The anxiety is real
Regarding most feared mob: I remember Etho going into his statistics in his LP world and seeing that he killed way more skeletons than any other mob... because they're very hard to ignore. You can run from zombies and creepers easily enough, but skeletons are so annoying that they have to be dealt with
The way scar  keeps saying hardcore makes me think the next word he’s gonna say is parkour not minecraft xD
In scars vid, at 3:55 his comment about Dumbledores is different than his comment in Grian’s vid of the same convo (at 4:53 in Grian’s). Just noticed it and wondered if anyone else did too
“Suffocating with Scar”
<3
Scar just terrifies me.
My poor heart! Scar, I love your face, but this was so stressful!
Every time he jumps off the base I flinch.
Scar's non-Minecraft hobbies: playing in highway traffic, skydiving, DIY explosives, trying to podrace by tying his wheelchair to motorcycles...
Scar got so lucky when he fell into the cave and escaped the drowned!
KING...PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL
The stress with those mobs. 😬😬 I was literally sitting here going “SCAR EAT!!”
Yes! I just really wanna see how long Scar will make it. I’m rooting for you all the way, I really hope you can make it to 100Hours. Rooting for you. Though… your not making it easy on yourself 🤣
EAT! kepp your hunger bar filled OH MY GOD
I agree Scar, the caves are not safe. Yay! Scar has a friend! 😆 bad spider leave the doggo alone
That was quite the roller coaster ride, Scar.  Your building skills are on point as always.  I'm so proud of you for surviving episode 2 and I'm looking forward to the next episode.
I’m so glad Scar can do a hardcore series and play tricks on Grian… best of both
scar you honestly need to learn some food/health management
Scardcore
I think this is all over now but thy have not showed use :?
For everyone's mental health, please get feather falling... :D
Skeletons are certainly the worst
I think you will survive at least half of the challenge though i will say your starter base is #NotScarSafe
It's kind of funny how much people tease scar about dying. However we all need to remember, he is a MC professional and can do it if he tries :D
You're such a delight to watch. Keep doing you, king
so much cliff hangers lol
Every time I see you build such amazing and nice looking stuff, it always inspires me and makes me want to hop onto minecraft and try and make something that has that concept in mind.. I need to try and practice building first.. since I can't find anything I make enjoyable to look at xD  And I wish you luck on your quest for 100 hours! I know you can do it if you really try!
*NETHERITE NETHERITE NETHERITE NETHERITE NETHERITE NETHERITE*
me: “time to relax and watch scar”  me watching: *anxiety intensifies*
Hey Scar! You’re one of my favourite YouTubers!! 😄—- Remember to eat and drink everyone  ( I also fear skeletons more because they have long range 😵‍💫)  Build idea— You should make a secret tunnel to Joel or Grians base and try to prank them! It would be funny lol. — just a suggestion 😄
a creeper blew up and killed me along with deleting all my items soooo, going with creepers.
I really think scar should make some sort of waterfall or lake or spring or just anything below his house to save him if he falls. Everytime he's in that house it gives me a heart attack.
Scar, PLEASE rebuild the infinity pool!! Not only did it look cool, but it's practical, too. And seeing you jump off that plank gives me such a heart attack, hahaha.
My face through the entirety of watching this was just 😧. bestie my heart
Scar I love you but you're giving my anxiety and anxiety with all your close calls xD
You should get a Totem of Undying next Please For our sakes
The base looks so cool!
Scar please put water completely down below the cliff base. I understand that it looks super cool but it’s giving me anxiety
Come on Scar, this is Hardcore, don't steal from people or try to blow them up or anything X3 How bad would you feel if you end up being the reason someone loses their run? DX
11:34 that what my family call me
jey Scar, for more safety put powder snow at the lands under your hanging base and hide it with carpets, and in case if you fall off you won't take any damage.(i haven't tested the mossy carpet yet, but others work)
The wither is the most scary mob only bedrock players feel my pain
build a pool you heathen
That jump that nearly killed you made my heart skip a beat
Your build is looking awesome already, I'm so excited to see where it goes!   And my god, that jump in F5? That was sick, but PLEASE, never do that again xD
That was... thiller and beautiful.... simply Scar!
Oh my goodness Scar, my heart was in my throat every time you jumped off the plank without looking hahaha
I like how he said spruced up and his farm is also made of spruce
I fear chicken's the most they lag my game with their eggs!
Drop creepers. Those are the worst cuz they just explode immediately without warning.
Scar why would you jump off the plank in the intro. That would have been the most embarrassing death under a minute in…
This man's willingness to risk his series at the drop of a dime is just not ordinary.
had ptsd at 17:00 ish cuz my hardcore game ended from a trident drowned
I feel like this series is Scar revealing that he's actually a master minecraft player.. For the past many years he's been pretending he dies a lot, pretending he's bad at combat etc, but this is the series we learn he's actually unkillable when he's trying
21:22 he did a bit of building of camera
Mobs I’m most scared of? Cave spiders. Their sounds and poison make me so uncomfortable
If I had a nickel for every time scar almost died I would have two nickels which isn't a lot but it is weird that it happened twice
I think I may have predicted that the Drowned would do someone in, happy to be wrong(this time)
Scar will die in the end, Joel will die, and grian will get to 100 hours
My anxiety levels are through the roof HAHAHA
"You may become scarred for life" takes a new meaning when it's Scar in a hardcore world 😂
E n d e r m a n
I am so glad to see you are back Scar! I hope you are feeling better and that you and Shellie had a wonderful new year.
I believe in you scar! I really want you to succeed!
Enderman are the worst
I cant remember ever feeling this anxious watching a video...
that enchantment table misdirection+steal is very professional
I can already see the near death experience compilations
It is so amazing to se you doing this scar. But please, steal some of groans mending books
I would love ti dee you make like 5 more big trees and have your whole base just hang off all 6 at the same time so you can go from one side of to the other
*almost dies in hardcore world* Scar: I do not want to lose these saplings
Scar this series can replace my workout given how fast my heart is beating.
How is he still alive HAHAHAHHAHA
the house would look better if you put a haning bridge
i smiled so much when u revealed your bas scar! it really matches your personality :)
I want you to not die in the game because I love your channel
Your base looks even more AMAZING !!! And as a plus a lot safer too  I never want your videos to end when I watch you it’s just such an enjoyable time can’t wait for the next episode
11:46 in hardcore, it is the creeper since they can ruin your series at any point. I have faced it many times and lost my hardcore worlds from them.
19:00 when was first part created ?
I'm going to die of a heart attack from watching Scar in this series. Probably before he dies in this series lol. Scar is such an epic builder but really stop jumping off cliffs
Did scar just build a bird house
Creepers can be nullified with a cat, water bucket, and/or a shield. One Hardcore skeleton with a grudge too close to a cliff and it's all over. Skeletons with always be my most feared mob
Horror films could learn much from this man about creating constant fear and tension...
My heart stopped at 10:54!  SCAR!!
One day, Scar will die at axolotl.
scar i came for chill vibes not STRESS, WHY DO YOU DANCE WITH DEATH.
plot twist, scar has dominoes powers from deadpool 2 and survives the longest out of everyone
My god...Scar.  This was the most stressful episode of a hardcore series I have ever seen.
scar u might want to add some fences in places
how about you start a network of rope bridges across the canyon?
Scar should make a new channel dedicated solely to the hard-core called HeartAttacksWithScar because he's really good at giving us one in the hard-core world
Ayo you need a waterfall there
These are good but stressful times with Scar, every single leap off the plank makes my heart catch in my throat 😂😭 But your base looks so amazing Scar!!! I love the house upgrade, it feels wonderful with the tree. Would love to see you fully geared up in the next episode as well as burning those berry bushes :) Also would love to see you visit Joel! I don't think we've seen his house from your perspective and I think it'd be fun cx
Another day another amazing video from an amazing creator
It would be so cool to see you build a bridge to the other cliff side.
I don't like Piglins. Especially the Brutes.
Scar playing hardcore gives me so much anxiety
This entire video gave me anxiety. 😅 scar likes to live dangerously I guess
I really loved the grian impression Keep up the good work man!
Scar here is an idea make flyovers connecting Joel's and grains base, paths and roads are common. Keep surviving till the last hour ❤️💪🏻
Scar your base is looking so cool!
i really like this small series!! it’s awesome to see you joel and grian interact you guys are so fun
Dude ur base looks so cool! U r such a talented builder!
oh wow the base just looks amazing i always wanted to build something like this but i just dont have the skills or creativity to build something like this
Scar's adventures gives me anxiety
Please get feather falling omfg 😂
i fear the scar the most
How did you live???
This episode was terrifying
100% relate to the risk taking😂  Also creepers haunt my very existence😂😂
every time scar almost dies it kills me inside
Anxiety 7:32 10:51 12:10 14:45 15:04 17:20 18:14
STOP JUMPING THE PLANK! you're gonna give me a heart attack with that stupid tree in the way!
I believe in you scar you got this easy peasy lemon squeazy
Jokes aside, that 13-15 minute mark of the video scared the heck out of me... you gave me so much anxiety,  even if you do get a kick out of scaring people.. may not want to be so wrekless.. lol
I just want you to survive 100 hours scar. That's it
Skreepers are the scariest
Joel and Grian’s second episode: Completing the game  Scar’s second episode: My house makes no sense.
I would even watch this video if it was like hours long! These never get boring!! Love your content!!!!
I think you gave me like 5 consecutive heart attacks this episode from those near-death moments! My gosh! But the base is looking wonderful! I love how the house looks while hanging from that tree. Please though; as soon as you can, get feather falling boots!  I think the scariest minecraft mob is definitely the drop creeper. Creepers on their own are dangerous, but when one drops on you and blows you up before you have the chance is definitely the worst
0:01 General Kenobi
Is it just me or does he kind of sound like a non-british version of Jake Munro?
Might be the most unsafe base, but it looks the best in my eyes.
Scars still alive yayy i bet scars death will be to falling lol
i got an A in math but not even i can count how many times scar was about to die
Why does scar still swim the 1.12 way?
The mobs I fear the most.... Witches. Especially in combination with skeletons. The witches get you on half a heart in a few seconds and the rattling archers finish you off. Every mob is fine but please, NOT WITCHES
Good Times with Scar-Lord, Savior of the Jellie-verse, daredevil adventurer extraordinaire with a pinch of wonder and terraforming.
Also you should get mending For your ax
Hey scar, what's up with your mic? Its making some weird noises. You might wanna check that.
Scar, I can relate to the kids fighting with lightsabers.
I swear half of the time he do this on purpose
New merch idea: A shirt with the logo "1 block from death"
To be fair, scar is lasting 2 episodes longer than I expected alive
Scar, you are truely a magician with your builds,  Also with surviving this Long :P
21:05 I am now holding my meat...  If I ever make a "Scar out of context" video this is going in there 🤣
I can't watch this. My anxiety and blood pressure won't allow it.
Scar is going to make it to 100 hours and  we are going to have good times while we watch on the edge of our seats. You can do it Scar!
YO HE'S STILL ALIVE
he makes
The Triple Triden Threat! Holy
hi
This video gave me at least 5 heart attacks
Dude creepers will 1shot you with full unenchanted diamond. Theyre the ones you gotta worry about. Ive lost so many hardcore worlds to them haha
Scar takes hardcore to another level... I feel the adrenalin all the time.
I can't get used to the fact that Scar is not going to where "jelly's present" anymore...
cave spiders are the one mob I always run away from
I love your hrdcre wwoorrdd
Looks like all that dying raised some kind of resistance. That's the only explanation I have for this.
Scar! Scar!      I wanna pet Jellie.
Skeletons.  Definitely skeletons.
18:01 “We found Nemo, and his brother!”  Uh okay Scar
I don't fear the mobs. The mobs fear me. When I cut an onion, the onion is the one that cries
awesome
The you present your videos is just so charming! I love this new series
Wow scar... You are either the luckiest man ever or you're just extremely skilled and are fooling everyone
Watching this video was simultaneously very enjoyable and so so stressful. WHY MUST YOU KEEP LEAPING FROM GREAT HEIGHTS MR. GOODTIMES THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR MY HEART. Aside from that, I have to say I was just AWESTRUCK when I saw the upgraded base. It looks incredible! I hope this series lasts the full 100 hours because I absolutely love it.
That new drop is so much less heart attack material , looks awesome once again :)
The jump at 10:59 was so scary!
There's living life on the edge and then there's whatever Scar is doing here. I'll be surprised if we all also make it out alive since he keeps giving everyone heart attacks every episode!
how long doo you tink you are gona serfive
I appreciate the star wars reference: just a simple man trying to make his way in the universe
Grian and joel already killed the dragon so its safe to go to the end.
He should build a waterfall down the side of the mountain and a lake under his base, so he'll always land in water if he falls.
scar, please for the sake of our heart health, get your self feather falling and a totem farm, and try not to die in the process pls
SCAR! You literally gave me anxiety by jumping out of this tree house!
I think terraforming the river under the base into a big pool is a priority to continue building this close to a giant fall.
Better get netheriod armor and some wings like the 2 others.
We’ll hello there. We can’t hear your game audio
12:00 if talking about fear creepers but skeltons are worse since if you don't block you got shot and form a distance is possbiel form them.
*watches scar jump off his base and just internally screams* SCAR! Scar no! one block back and you would be DEAD
scar in a hardcore world? It gives me anxiety lol good luck Scar and stop jumping from your base; that is probably how you will die.  Also, you take no fall damage if you fall while in a boat.
idea for next episide: fight a witther
Pls put scar on a obsidian cage whenever its nighttime 🙂
I'll probably die from stress before these 100 hours are up. Amazing content Scar!!
How many times did he nearly die in this episode?
Farming episode: last minute-now to start on the farms😂😂😂
Scar please don't don't risk your life like that I had several heart attacks watching this Hope you make it to 100 hours  Love you <3
Skeletons are so awful. Creepers you can just let blow up on your shield, skeletons keep shooting you and there's no quick way to safely kill them
As always, Fun to Watch. Keep up the great work.
scar for the love of everything holy PLEASE stop jumping off of that plank or i'm gonna be scarred for life for REAL forreal because of all this anxiety haha
I think I would be cool if you had multiple mine entries/ ways up to the top with a bridge connecting the hills
Omygod,i dont wanna watch scar doing hardcore mode anymore
:0
Hey, uhh… Since ya got so many vertical staircases, wouldn't it be a good idea to add some water in the bottom, just to have  a protection measure in case you're running from zombies, or a pesky skeleton is stretching up their joints…also, it feels like a solid bridge wouldn't quite fit with the house, since a house hanging from a tree wouldn't be stable and strong winds would damage both the bridge and whatever it's connected to. A hanging one could do the trick. Even the curent design would do, should it be made of baloons… either way, byeeee✨🎈✨
Scar just chillin on 2 hearts like its nothing is the ultimate stress test lmao
whenever scar laughs I feel so happy inside 😊
please tell grian his base looks like a double stuffed oreo
anyone else hear crickets in the background
SCAR, MY HEART!
kill the wither
HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD  HOW  Scar please for the love of everything get diamond armor and get it enchanted and get feather falling. No more tools! No more weapons! Armor! It's hardcore!  HoW ARE YOU NOT DEAD fiihosh dbdlebs isj f
place berry bushes under ur base, they work as cobwebs and u wont take falldamage
Scar, your WHIMSY is Brilliant!!! I Believe In You!!!✨💖✨
this thrill seeker is always an inch from death
This episode scared me more than any horror movie
i had countless anxiety attacks watching this.... i really hope scar survives for 100 hrs
I'm trully surprised by how you survive in those caves, Scar.
We all say Scar is first to die or second to die in the series and stuff like that but the truth is Scar has survived soooooo many almost impossible situation. he is secretly a pro gamer XD
Scar’s posh British impression of Grian got me 💔
The heart attacks keep coming! Thanks for the awesome episode. My son is rooting for you!
alternate title this video makes your anxiety EXPLODE
Scar's casually giving us a heart attacks by jumping from the plank. ( ._.)
Watching Scar play hardcore Minecraft gives me more anxiety than school does
This was the most stressful 24:52 of my life
Scars base is giving me serious anxiety
im holding my meat- scar, 2022
Do not use elytra, please
Love your content Scar, but please… no more enchantment table heists, this isn’t Last Life
Yo
Think I lost about 1 stone in weight watching this episode also good job my ticker is okay, the stress man. the stress.
Casually jumping facing the camera… thank god I watched this on the toilet .
Your tree reminds me of a live oak I have in my backyard
'Here's 25 minutes of Scar one arrow from death.'
Scar really need to remove that ONE block,    my anxiety 😭
1.18 was the Caves and Cliffs update. Scar is enjoying the 'Cliffs' portion with this base.
I think I'll die from anxiety before scar dies from his anxiety inducing hardcore gameplay- SCAR BE MORE CAREFUL 😭
2 things I'd like to see scar, a bridge spanning the gorge and to make the river under your base scar safe
i dont know how youre doing it but im really proud of you for making it two whole episodes without dying! youve got this scar!
If it wasn’t for stealing Grians enchanter, Scar would most likely be dead lol
creeper. Because I never f-ing see them until they blow me up. This is made harder by the fact I play with my sound off.  As for building ideas. If it was me, going by what you have so far, I'd probably have a dedicated area for everything I'd need. Like an area for all of my storage, a blacksmithing area solely for all of my crafting needs. And I'd still like to see more hanging trees with walkways between them
3:10 thought this was a gasp because all that copper needed waxing
Scar's base is so well done! I've tried doing cliff side bases before but never managed to nail making builds feel connected organically. It really remind me of the city of Orth from the anime 'made in abyss'.   Check it out of you don't know it.  It might provide some great inspiration for your build Scar or if someone else wants to try a cliff side base.
Scar is soo hilarious😂   Keep the good work goin
21:05 you're holding *what*
I've been living with anxiety for 3 decades but I have never felt it more than watching Scar play hardcore minecraft
Somehow I like the fact that even tho I am not good at building, I DO know how to survive without getting a hart attack. My god do I get the scares from these vids.
it s strange to look you without hat
U gotta convince grian to get u an elytra, cuz that base is not safe!
10:56 Oh god my anxiety
my new favorite word: pamarama windows
Please so not get elytra. Kinetic energy will not kill you this series
how close he was to that block when he jumped while saying about infrastructure, omg my anXIETY!!
I was crying for 76.8% of this video   I’ll give you one guess why
I think scar is going to make it to 99 hours and die last minute.
SCAR! THAT JUMP!
You will at least get to 50 hours, I believe in you
Hermitcraft season eight kinda lost me because of the whole moon thing, and I didn’t enjoy some of the Hermits as much as I used to. But scar never fails to produce a good video, no matter the circumstance. Keep up the great work Scar!
Hi!  I am really excited for this video !! 9:00 - I saw Grians pov yesterday and it really was funny. I think it's hilarious how I didn't even notice your floor was made out of trapdoors. Oh boy. 10:00 - Great ! Now everyone in 5 miles radius will know "This is where the Good Times with Scar happen!" 11:54 - I fear Creepers the most !! They just randomly appear and make a mess. I am also VERY bad at fighting them. But I also fear Ghasts a lot, but since they're pretty bad at following me, i can easily hide. 18:15 - "Ah Copper :) NOOOO" that moment really cracked me up xD Please light up every place you go to. Just to be a tad safer. 19:30 - OH MY GOD THE SUPER FAST BUILD MODE MUSIC !! I MISSED IT SO MUCH !! i finished my homework to it the other day. 24:25 - How about a really cool GreenHouse? Where you grow all the plants in the world! Flowers, Cacti, Pumpkins, Sea Cucumbers, All sorts of Trees..!  I really want to thank you for putting all your videos out here. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like my inner child is somewhat healing whenever i watch you. You make me feel safe and provide so much comfort, I can also genuinely laugh whenever you crack a joke.  So from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Nicely done with the drowned man.
i think it should be a tree house not a suspended tree base
Suggestion for the stuff to do in the next episode: if your pickaxe doesn't have fortune 3 on it, then try enchanting it with grians enchantment table seeing as you have 38 levels. Then go mining for diamonds, (your choice if you do caving or strip mines, personally I would make a strip mine at y-level -58). Also I really enjoyed this video and it is great to see you live so long in hardcore minecraft.
I'm really glad you're playing this! 👍
10:54 he was 1 block away from death
17:20 How in the name of all that's HOLY did Scar survive this!?!?
I love how scar is still in iron amour yet hole and grain are in full nertherite
Nevermind Scar, I don't think *I'll* survive this series
Endermit is the mob I fear
Glad to see the real Scar is back with the new base lol…🤣  Love the series!
Scar is doing everything he can to scare us.
Creepers scare me the most because they’ve messed up my bases more than once 😅
I think scar is much more skilled in not dying then he makes us believe. In Hermitcraft it's his thing but here he doesn't have to
Scar u can walk while holding the shield, you could’ve walk towards the drowned and hit them after u block their shots
I get multiple heart attacks when I see scar play! For example, 20:54 , He just jumped in that view! I was like whops there goes the series!
Scar’s real goal this episode seems to be raising my blood pressure
I love how he says hardcore in his intro. It so wholesome
Don't die.
Scar Jesus Christ
This episode was not good for the heart
21:51 he has to be saying that on purpose
Bearley managing to jump into water and constantly almost dying to skeletons? This man is a menace to society
Watch, he dies byJumping off.
I really don't want you to die, because that base is looking absolutely amazing!
...holding what now? xD
More like how did I survive all of this lol
I don’t think I’ve been so stressed watching someone play hardcore Minecraft before
I just love how everyone is so scared of him dying and scar himself just doesnt even care about nearly dying
The farms look like mushrooms!!
This base is just amazing, honestly
My blood pressure is elevated after watching this.
U probably aleeady know this, but just incase u dont, u should feed your dog rotten flesh instead of steak etc cuz it gives dogs tve same amount of hearts as other cooked meats. So u dont waste food, and you get some use frlm the rotten flesh
Scar idk if you’ll see this.  But honestly your videos bring me so much joy and reduce my anxiety *surprising considering it’s HC* I love your videos.
Creeper if unexpected but 100 skeleton cause they do the damage
The best episode 😂
Seeing Scar dancing on the edges scarred us for life
I think scar sets up his personality on video to be risky, but he’s actually extremely skilled and this is just a trick
Scar I’m simply blown away with what you were able to accomplish for the builds. It looks incredible.
I have spent this entire episode screaming internally "PLEASE JUST EAT, YOU BUFFOON"
Scar pls add eyes to Grians base
HOW
Scar. It’s not competitive. You don’t have to steal the enchanting table anymore
10.50 my heart almost stopped
17:45:  “Axolotls aren’t evil, right.”  (Perfect reaction.😂) What an adventure!  Scar deserves to wear Indy’s fedora, for sure.
alternative title: GoodTimesWithScar almost dies for 24 minutes and 52 second
You got this!
I am amazed Scar has made it this far without dying. Love It
wifneixnbc this was so fun to watch but utterly terrifying   Anyway the base is so pretty I love
scar they went to the end without you
Scar needs to make him self safe Lmao
Minecraft has never brought me so much pain and agony
I think I speak for almost everyone when I say   Holy cow, Scar. You've outdone yourself. We love you!
I've never been more stressed watching a Hardcore playthrough.
I'm surprised he doesn't have carpal tunnel cause this man has been building insane builds and somehow avoids carpal tunnel, keep up the good work but don't click to much 👍
Ima say 3rd episode he dead
This episode had me thinking "that's it, he's dead" too many times. This has been so stressful- But Scar survived over 22h, which was what I thought he'd die at latest so I am already pleasently sutprised!
I had several moments where I stopped breathing for a bit watching this 😂
You could have a water stream flow through your farms, maybe with a pond or something at the top?
As if life wasn't stressful enough.. now Scar is making us watch this.
No one is gonna acknowledge Scar surviving those 3 Drowned and fell to a pond and almost died if he landed on those grass blocks...
I think i’m gonna get a heart attack just watching Scar play Hardcore, loving the videos btw
This is going to be my favourite hardcore series. I don’t think I’ve laughed harder than I have at this episode hahahah I believe in you!!
if scar makes it to 100 hours, he will be remembered for eternity as the man who really defied all expectatiions
Scar you're scaring me
Scar! For the love of God man stop this Jumps, you are giving me a heart attack.  One of this days you won't make it, and you will die, and that's will be it for this series, and I don't like to see it end in that way (or in any way for that matter, especially for baby zombie🤣). Play it safe my man, and shovel that little bunch of dirt, so you can have more jumping space. I lost my 3 months hardcore world because I slipped into one dirt block that I was lazy to remove and it bited me, so please be more careful
10:57 Don't do that again , I almost had a heart attack
You are going to give me a heart attack one of these days with your risks.  I love this series though, so... worth it!
How about a livestock pen that looks like an ant farm built into the hillside?
Scar is taking some hard risks here. But still he's surviving and I think that's a great thing (:
Sir please your reckless leaping off of things makes me anxious /lh /hj
The base looks amazing scar !
as stressful as it is to watch scar, this might be the most stressed I've ever been watching scar LMAO
Watching this video is like doing cardio.
The only question on my mind is: Did you Creeper proof that base Scar?
couple hours scar? The timer says 12 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had an anxiaty attack the whole episode.... scar plays like death doesn't matter xD
This is the best birthday present ever!
That buold reveal! i was like Wow!
does anyone ells just find them self  yelling "scar" a lot
This series gives me anxiety and I love every minute of it 😂😂
Think a little crane would make the farms/mines a lot cooler. Just holding a hay bale or some copper for the aesthetic.
Man the terrain on minecraft is awesome now
Honestly, the whole "stealing the enchantment table" thing just seems... rather mean-spirited.
im thinking mining or setting up animal farms next episodes next time would be nice to see :) also you jumping off the plank and barely making it in makes me nervous lol
Scar stop please 🥺
I love this series so much but oh my god.... my poor heart lol How are you still alive????
Scar being on a suspended tree base is probably gonna be the death of him
10:16 doesn't his pronunciation of portal sort of sounds like porno lmao
I think more than anything I enjoy seeing Scar defy all expectations of an early death
It's gonna be so nuts if Scar survives at all... but what will be even more crazy is if he's the last man standing.
Please! Scar!!! Those jumps are gonna kill me before they kill you!
ok scar is going to die from not eating im putting my money on it
The most dangerous mobs are creepers that drop down out of nowhere and instantly explode xD
there needs to be a counter for how many times Scar had a near death experience
Can a dead player not stay for longer than 5 minutes? Maybe kill your camera account?
Scar: don't worry, I'll give him his enchanter back Grian: I am *never* getting this enchanter back, am I
Love the house
Scar I am in LOVE with your builds!!!
Envokers scare me the most.
Mob I fear the most- The Witches. They keep jump scaring me and popping out of no where.  Your luck is both bad and amazing at the same time. You keep falling into near death only to escape. Good job surviving. Your base looks amazing and I can't wait to see what you do next.
If I had a fitbit it would register about 25 minutes of exercise with every episode of this series
Scar before you continue building you should first get a full diamond equipment
'excetera excetera': the new spell in the magic book of Scar 😊👍🏻
You can do it Scar!
Scar can you prank grian
Are the worst mob in Minecraft
every time he makes that jump i get heart palpitations
i aspire to be as good a builder as scar one day
Skeleton
"Cue Jurassic Park" *starts humming the Harry Potter theme off key* :D
wow! I've never seen so many near death experiences without the actual death! LOL
Oh yeah scar is not gonna last
My heart was shaking wildly just watching the uncountable times you escaped death by a hair...
I'm starting to see why everyone keeps pressing x to doubt scar will survive
Airship
Omg, my heart. I panicked like it was me playing when the drowned came after him... 😅   I'm loving the new base, though!  The farms need some fences, maybe.  And I'd dig out the strip of land under your base so it's all water.  Just for peace of mind.
Calling it now episode 3 sorry
I've never been more stressed from watching a minecraft youtube video
I was expecting "Episode 2 - It's all over"
How can you not love scar
I must say, the title fits so good with the episode
Your new house is beautiful. Also, how on earth are you still alive?
This is most anxiety I ever had watching someone play hardcore  minecraft
Hey scar i got a tip! if you press f on your keyboard it will switch what your holding with your offhand
Oh Scar! Oh my gosh! My heart!! Please make it to 100 hours! I'm rooting for you :D!!!
Imagine if everyone dies except scar…
Please get diamond Armor scaaaar
Scar please stop scaring me with the plank
Positive comment
Hey scar, It'd be AWESOME if you build an underground railway that connects to Grians and Joels base. You could call it "The Copper Express". Build a whole village in the canyon with a railway
You could try the azalea bushes or the flowering azalea bushes in the flower pots maybe.
22 hours, 1/5th of the alloted time into the series. I got farms
17:30 OOOOOOOOOOH MYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Scar if you don’t want sweeping edge to hit an ally (dog) USE YOUR AXE
I almost had a heart attack watching this.
Scar: *Wants to build infrastructures and be very dangerous about it*  Joel & Grain: *Want to beat minecraft in the safeties way possible*  But in all honesty Scar, I think you should mine for diamonds to make a full diamond set and probably get some feather falling on those shiny blue boots too.
Good jop scar nice to see u survive!!!
Here’s your name for the city 🌃, Gorgan
Get a fortune 3 pick and go branch mining at Y: -58
How did you survive 3 tridents at one time I am still baffled by that
Scar let's do a hardcore series   Also scar let's build over mostly land and trapdoors
10:58 was unreasonably scary.
Everytime u and grian and smallishbeans uploads a video it hypes me up especially loving this series
Scar is my comfort YouTuber. <3
But where is the dog
GENERAL KENOBI
Worth mentioning that the concept of Scar doing a hardcore series was the premise of a hilarious April Fools' joke several years back! I would not venture into deep, wide open caves without full diamond, prot4.
My man.    If u was to die u should haunt and trap both of them
Scar you've given me like 10 heart attacks in 20 minutes!!! You're gonna make me have gray hairs early and I don't even have kids yet!! I'm just constantly going SCAR!!!! Also I really hope you outlast everyone because then you'd deserve a hardcore title like Philza :P
WHY DO YOU KEEP JUMPING OF YOUR BASE. IT IS SO STRESSFULL!! I DO NOT WANT YOUR SERIES TO END HERE
Scar, thank you for being you. I was having one of the mangled spirit days and you made me smile
So ironically. I died on my World while watching scar on hardcore and lost my last elytra and all of my gear. I'm devastated. Why scar why 🤣.
Can you please please teraform the gully between the mountains to make a really fat river? Everytime you jump I just have to close my eyes in fear for your series.
11:42 missed a diamond going down  the water elevator
Scar. Until you started this series, I had never truly been gobsmacked by anything. You still being alive after so many close calls has changed my existence. I am so afraid and so hopeful for you to complete this series. Best of continued luck, my friend.
YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE LAAND UNDER YOUR HOUSE!!!!!!
You’re the luckiest 😂 How are you still alive?! Your armor gave me anxiety!!! Super cool base! Love this series! 💕
bebe zombie is scary if u are philza
I swear I've had at least five mini heart attacks watching this scar 🤣
Welcome to hardcore minecraft, where scar will amaze everyone with his death defying skills (somehow)
my heart is dead rn. it went through way too much stress
I spent too much time mentally willing you to eat cuz you got two hearts and what do you do? Feed the dog! It’s nice to see that you care about the dog enough to maintain its health. Funny how your own hit points are so frequently ignored.
For the love of god scar, work on your safety: Water under your base, some fences up there so you don't fall, extra shields, some healing potions always ready, watch your life bar goddamit, get an elytra asap, util then try to make path, and really, just run from mobs. This series is looking very good, it would be a shame if it ended early because of some stupid little mistake.
I would love it if you can get yourself an elytra, maybe with some help from grian or smalish beans, but you have to get one and use it
Scar you stress me out lol. Feeding that dog before you ate yourself when you had like 2 hearts gave me a heart attack ♥ Love the new base!
Scar is giving me a heart attack every 30 seconds
Scar: Ohh no! He's dead! I killed the man! Scar 2 seconds later: Do I get his villagers?
"now you're my friend. kill this man" - scar 2022  14:06
Scar please get rid of the dirt below your base, U keep giving me a heart attack every time u jump off your base
name the cat Trista
You know, it might sound mean, but if Scar doesn't fail that challenge i will be disappointed.
U nearly died
Ahh, this is terrifying to watch XD
I love the Book of Boba Fett Reference 20:00
Please have a diamond armour.
how did scar made a accidental rhyme on part 20:50-21:12
I'm afraid of spiders this most
Amazed you survived the three drowned! Loving the base. I'm going to have to build some cliffside farms now
The fact scar is still alive is impressive
Noo why did you use a lightning rod for ur house when its wood
How the heck you almost die every time when you're recording but when you come back with a progress..it feels like you should've died at least once with the amount of progress you have shown.. you're really amazing Scar! you're such a goat at this game..it feels like you're a very different person when you're not recording. We're rooting for you in this series! outlive them or reach together a 100 hours in Minecraft please!
best superhero name. Scar danger scar.
Scar 2022: " I am now holding my meat" 21:06
This is just an idea I had, but maybe once you do more in the mine you can build some mine carts with barrels on them to store stuff that you mine
Okay, I made it to the end of the video. It was SO TENSE, but then out of nowhere at the end comes an AMAZING build like that?? It looks incredible!
Watching Scar's videos is usually relaxing... but this is gonna give me anxiety attacks
Scar.... please.... feather falling!
Good episode. Love the way the farms are done and the connecting caves are good too! But the house-to-cliff bridge distracts me a bit:  If a house were suspended from a tree then in the wind, the tree would bob and sway, and the house would move around as well. the rigid bridge would be pulled out of the cliff, or the house would snap off during a windstorm. I know minecraft doesn't have those, but it is a bit distracting to picture. Perhaps a movment point in the bridge, or a flexible style of bridge like rope? The tree looks so good I just picture it swaying in the breeze to well I guess ^_^
I might need to watch these watching calming tea, but an awesome series.
Well hello there!
Scar… you HAVE to make a safer area to jump down into. My heart can’t take much more of those close calls
You live above a river. Get some riptide, it’s awesome
Scar stop jump while looking at yourself you always die becuase your looking at yourelf and not whats infront of you you have a bad habit and it need to stop
Yep. *Literally Impossible* he makes it to even 50 hours.
scar loves making beautiful starter bases and not stopping working on them
The mob I fear the most in MC is the Magma Cube. I've been knocked off of a bridge or cliff into Lava too many times by those annoying little blobs.
Skeletons are the worst; also, your genuine lack of self-preservation skills in this is really ratcheting up my blood pressure. It's like when you watch one of those "top ten greatest anxiety-inducing clips" compilations, but I'm 100% invested and thus more terrified. I hope you make it all the way!!
You are going to give me a stroke
Crops look flat and too straight..need bulking... Mines exterior looks too busy
grian's mic peaking is the best part of this series so far
Scar on two hearts : ~calm~
I swear you have the most plot armor possible
this makes my day:)
£50 says that scar will die around the 30-40 hour mark.
HoW hAs He NoT dIeD lmao he’s gotten soo close soo many times
I normally watch minecraft videos to relax, but apparently I watch Scar to get anxiety disorder and a heart attack...
9:18 Scar copying Grian's accent and making it so over the top!!
I had new found respect for Scar. To have survived all of those mobs, I have no doubt he will go far in this series.
Your going to give me anxiety scar
Who else saw that white fox at 20:00
Can someone count the amount of times Scar almost died in this episode?
It's zombie flavored LOL
Scar is now an action hero figure. Now on sale in the 100 hour survivor hard core.
Anxiety 📈📉📈📉 👁️👄👁️
Always look forward to your  videos. The base looks awesome ! My goodness make sure to get new gear with high protection! I can't wait to see what else you do
and here you see 25 minutes of scar barely escaping dangerous situations with his life
Out of everyone, I'm excited 2 C how long Scar lasts. My best are Joel is the sole survivor if it does come to that point 🤷‍♂️❤
*heavy british accent* *"did you say enchanting?"* im dyingggg
This episodes titel, could be the series titel :,3 but it was honestly hard to eat my food and keeping it in my mouth :,3 You gave quite a few scares...
So do they only have 100 hours and then it ends?
I can’t wait for this episode to be over so I can relax! Talk about stress!  Edit: I have now finished the episode and I am sad it is over.
Someone should make a complication of how many times Joe, Scar or Grian almost die
At 17:01 when the second drowned with a trident comes around the corner hahahaha. Scar has the best and worst luck, simultaneously. And then there was a third!!!
scar if you dont die i will with all the heartattacks youre giving me,,,,
Maybe use an autoclicker for your spectator account? I guess if it's on the same computer that wouldn't work.
Scar is the only reason I'm still alive
i feel like i was watching a horror movie. just one near-death experience after another
Who else is surprised that Scar has lived to see a future Episode 3?
you should put slabs under the trapdoor floor of ur base
Mr. Scar your giving me a heart attack Everytime your in danger o_O please be careful DX
I'm still saying that Scar will die in episode 3
You're the best Scar! Always a joy to see a new video from you!
Turn you mob sounds on,  Always carry an extra shield with you earlier game, Get use to using the different perspectives so you can always check your surroundings. DONT GO INTO CAVES!!!!! Mobs will drop on you, Scar please- And lastly Golden apples, it could save you in a life or death situation.
I so enjoy your builds Scar! That tree is inspired. ❤️
Hi Scar I built a mini version of a custom tree like you did on here but its a bit different.
I have a feeling that this series is not going to have a lot of episodes due to the fact that they plays for a long time in a single episode
Scar: feeds wolf with cooked mutton instead of rotten flesh...
I feel like I need a Valium after watching Scar in HC.
goal for next episode...... turn the river at the bottom of the canyon into a lake and put a little dock so you will actually survive to 100 hrs mr bungee jumper without a cable
Skeleton is so much harder
I got unreasonable happy when I saw this pop up on my home screen.
you don’t
Not gonna lie, the boat jump scares me more than anything as I've seen them break if you hit one specific height, at least when you jump you have the ability to navigate yourself towards water XD Loving this series so far :D AND OMG THOSE DROWNED, ESPCAPING THEM WAS SUPER IMPRESSIVE!!!!
I think a skeleton is worse fuzz a creeper is just an awww man but a skeleton is aaaaaahhh(scream)
How are you still alive?!
3 ep the disaster
next episode? yeaaaaah, you obviously gonna make it into the next episode
I just love his soft lil laugh :D 23:44
Scar will kill us ali with hearth attacks before he dies in the game
Absolutely great video
As a hardcore player, this video makes me shiver from all the close calls, I was thinking bad scar when he went into the dark cave on the boat because if there was a creeper hanging out on a ledge, it could have dropped down and instant exploded. A note of caution, ravines are to be avoided unless completely open to the surface, or you take one on from the top lighting it up first to stop the instant creeper of doom.
Let them eat bread
Cool.
We love you scar
Never thought I'd see scar do hardcore. Let alone reach episode 2!  GG scar. Good luck.
Drowned with trident all the way! I've died so many times by them, it's ridiculous. And on top of that, they can horde you on both sides so a shield doesn't work!  Most awful death in a hardcore world...😖
This is the most tense Minecraft viewing I've ever seen. Edge of my seat the entire time!
His videos used to be so relaxing, now it is just… “HE IS ON TWO HEARTS!”
Scar was one miscalculation from dying 10:55
I am offended that scar didn't remember what Jurassic Park was called jk lol
You need a sign with your close calles i think you are one four
Who wants to bet that scar will die from falling off his base? I got $5
11:48 Both, ever since I was shot by a skeleton; whilst mining in a cave, only to be sent deeper into a unlit cave then blown up by a creeper, it's clear to me both are as dangerous as eachother.
I love how it wasn't originally planned for scar to make an entire series too, he was only supposed to be a guest lol im loving this series already!
hearing  his super fast build mode in one of his videos again is so nice
Please keep a boat on you when you go off high places!! They help cancel out fall damage, but still be careful
I think I speak for everyone here.. How on earth are you still alive in this series?! 😂😂 You know how to get your viewers on edge, that tri-trident encounter was intense!
"walking the plank thing" you mean the plank?  love having heart attacks thoroughly enjoying this series
Trade with Grian's villagers for diamond enchanted gear, atleast Grian will be happy you leveled them up.
Jesus the close calls today.... Scar needs to go to combat school I think...
This series is going to give me a heart condition 😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♂️
Scar totally don't give me anxiety
Love the house Scar!
CAn you add mumbo to the hardcore world aswell.
Skeletons are worse early game, but once you get to the buildy-buildy part of the game, creepers are pain
How'd you survive all of that? God, how are you alive, Scar?
I just counted every scar's death in hermitcraft since he joined, it did take weeks and weeks, however it was  so funny, it was more than 1500
ok but no seriously how did scar survive that
Scar you take too many risks and it scares me more than any minecraft mob XD
I'm gonna update this comment if he does or doesn't mine the emerald in the mountain.
I love this, I really hope you make this challenge but with all the jumping of the cliffs and boating off of your house might get you killed
Lol how did you need die in that caving trip, looked like the game wanted you to die lol
How will scar die 1. Mobs 2. Falling 3. Tnt/end crystal  4. Lava/fire 5. Drowing 6. Suffocation 7. Kinetic energy  8. Trap 9. Potion 10. Cactus/Berry bush 11. Starving 12. Lightning 13. Anvil 14. The void
After seeimg the title, I thought to myself "Scar, what have you done this time?"
Scar's series is my favourite because the way he says "hard!core!" is the best. Them's the facts.
Anyone else besides me think that Scar should dig out that Island beneath his base, before he goes :SPLAT: on it?!  😳
Scar is the most chaotic minecrafter i know, he goes from "oh no i just killed a man!" To "do i get his villagers?" without missing a beat
The amount of heart attacks i had while watching was immeasurable
Scar's base is gonna kill someone.  and it's gonna be him.  and it will be hilarious.
your building skills are absolutely amazing
i love watching scar's vids but oml if this series isn't sparking anxiety everytime he's low on hunger and hearts!
how is he still alive???? welp i like to see you survive all 100 hours good luck
Scar stop scaring me
Ok, can anyone explain the transparent “ghost” spiders ?
How are you still alive? 😲 Those situations are so clutch.
Watching Scar in hardcore is so stressful! Every other minute I'm afraid it's going to be over! And the man is building everything on a cliff! You are mad, Scar - and I LOVE it! 😂😂😂
Skeletons are definitely the worst
Scar you are scarring me every time you jump off of your house ... please 💀
Yeah, let's face it. Scar definitely won't make it and probably will have the most questionable death like going afk and being killed by a zombie or falling down a cliff
scar is definitely gonna die by jumping off the plank one day
I.... I don't know if I can watch this... I'm so constantly stressed.... SCAR QUIT BEING SO RISKY XD killing my poor little heart. Its like watching a car accident you just can't look away
Scar, my dude, buddy, my guy, friend. Please for the love of my sanity please   invest in some prot 3 armour and feather fall at least. Not sure my heart can take much more!
dream be like: it does not have to look good as long as it is effective  scar be like it: does not have to be effective as long as it looks Good😂😂😂
You should make a waterfall with the tree and entry house being on boulders in the stream that way it looks cool and also gives you safety if you fall
Wow what a rollercoaster of events and emotions. I totally did not fall of my chair laughing.
It looks amazing Scar! Your buildings are so amazing every time. Congrats on surviving this far in. Almost 1/4 of the way through!  Keep up the good work!
How has this man survived 1 hour, let alone 10...
I feel like I just went on a rollercoaster...
SCAR STOP STRESSING ME OUT!
You really should invest in folder apples instead of any other food source xD
Did anyone catch the diamond at 11:45
this felt like my heart got hit by a train thank u scar
Great job on surviving for so long so far :D youre doing great (The base looks awesome!!)
I honestly fear bats the most...
Such a lovely base! I quite like the shape of the farm balconies.
No lie, I'm rooting Scar to reach 100 hours. Go Scar!
Love you
just WOW
When he jumped off in 3rd person, he said it was scary as it was only one block away from death.... SCAR IT WAS NOT EVEN ONE BLOCK TRY ONE PIXEL!
Grian: Did you say enchanting?  Scar, in a British accent: DiD You SaY EncHanTing?
I fear the Creep because you don’t know when they sneak up on you and blow up.  Idea build Jelly’s face in the side of your mountain and call it mount Jelly more.
Can somebody explain to me how scar has died 150 times on everything butLast life third life and 100 hours like how
Scar playing hardcore is like a family-friendly thriller movie...
11:50 personally, ive died so many times in hardcore to just getting oneshot by a creeper that im terrified by them
3 tridents at once.. The game is trying to kill you..
15:31 diamond eggs?
The cave at the beginning of the episode looks like a WWII submarine pen
You should make an airship of some sorts.
I say one more episode before it ends 😂😂😂😂
I have an idea. What if you make the minecart look like a re-purposed swaggon?
Nemo's brothers are all dead scar...
Scar it's been 5 versions and you still don't know how to swim under water.
Awesome episode Scar! The cliffside upgrades look incredible, and I really like the farms! Also, just a tip, you can press F (by default) to instantly transfer an item to your offhand from anywhere. It can help equip shields faster
In the spirit of tempting fate the gorge needs a rickety rope bridge. The kind where you're on the edge of your seat wondering if you're going to accidentally fall off or not.
the scariest mob is a tie between a wither and a mooshroom
I love how the "how'd I survive this" can refer to like 15 different things in the video
How did he survive those three tridents hahahaha
I CAME HERE TO RELAX, MR SCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant as always! This was kind of an emotional rollercoaster, between fun shenanigans with Grian, so many near misses, and then the beautiful builds!
Maybe u can build a basement at the start of the mineshaft entrence u made with all the reacources from the mines down in the caves
That trapdoor floor is like a Chekov"s gun. edit: trapdoors are gone, my anxiety has been partially alleviated
my blood pressure is never as high as it is when watching Scar in hardcore mode
the first 19 minutes is honestly the most painful 19 minutes in my life. oh the amount of stress
Witch
he's definetly gonna die and in spectator mode very soon
scar you should build an airship
I love your videos
scar: don't worry, i'll give his enchanter back grian in his own video, verbatim: i have played in two series of last life and third life with this man, and you know what, there's no point.  there's just no point trying to get the enchanter back.
Let’s take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us..…………🖤❣️🤟🏽💯💕🌙💝🤢👍🏻👌✌🏼
Skeletons are the worst, once one killed me in the Nether. I was trying to get to a bastion and he shot me into lava. I lost my full diamond protection 4 armor because of a skeleton.
The amount of near deaths... scar my heart cant take this
Get some diamond gear pls!!!
scar one tip stay away from ravines, one creep-drop shot is enough the end the series.....i like the series too much  times scar came close to death in this episode: 9 2 times fallling close to the land than water frm the base 1 time drowning 3 times mobs 2 times trident drowned 1 time falling gravel
This series is just pure anxiety
The mob I fear most are for sure Baby Zombies, they are known for ending hardcore worlds after all
scar 1 million times almost dying and still carelessly walking around !
The mob I fear the most is…the baby zombie
I suggest that you do use the replay mode sacar.  There are some shots that you just cannot get with just a spectator. It really turns time-lapses into a whole other form of art
Either scar is really lucky or this is just an illusion
When I heard you  say I’m just a simple man making my way in the universe I thought for a second and then came up with this question, did you watch book of boba fett and if so what do you think of it?
Can you  leash  a boat  in java edition? Bc I never see someone do it... it  is  sooo  good  for moving mobs
4.3 THOUSANTH LIKE
Honestly, I’d rather go up against a creeper than a skeleton any day. They’re annoying and they’ve killed me many more times than creepers
I wake up and I watch scar play minecraft what a wonderful start to the day of being sick! I also just made a video on this video
I'm beginning to wonder if 'death prone Scar' is just a bit he does for comedic effect, and that he's actually a secretly competent minecrafter.
ok but Scar being attacked by 3 trident drowned at falling into a beautiful safe lush cave really shows the danger and prettiness of the update
Scar playing in hardcore mode is giving me such anxiety! (and he does some of it on purpose i swear)
Scar: plays one of Tommy’s disks Everyone: liked that
When Scar finds the disappointing river cave I can just hear Richard Attenborough (from Jurassic Park) saying "We spared no expense!"
OMG 17:22
Scar is just the best
Me the whole episode: Scar! Scar! Scar no! Look out! 😖😂😂  Great episode! I think I saw your life flash before my eyes a few times. 😅😅😅
The anxiety this video gave me, props to staying alive so long
Oh man I had like 4 heart attacks during this video. I'm so proud of Scar he is surviving so great thus far
Whenever I hear your time lapse music, I think of someone doing the Carlson dance from fresh prince
Scar: living dangerously
I think vex are scarier than skeletons in hardcore
you gave me a heartattack! lol I love your content btw <3
Its like watching a train wreck you cant look away
Here is a virtual hug for Scar. Hopefully you get to episode 10.
Get the dumbledores
Watching scar's hardcore series is like watching a suspense movie full of jumpscares
Make a dungeon deep in one of the caves and kidnap Grians villagers. Then either hold them for ransom or give him a map to find them.  If there is no PvP then there are other ways to mess with Grian lol
The builds looking awesome!  Can't believe you survived those trident boys! Holy hell!   An idea for yea, for both safety and making it pretty, add some waterfalls around the structures into a pool at the bottom.
You should check your pc fan, or whatever i hear XD
scar should make his house a hanging pirate ship!
scars jurassic park theme be like: also its dr hammond not ham :D
I'm convinced this man has plot armor at this point
I love seeing Scar playing hardcore. So funny to watch, and curtainly not how most people play hardcore.
If I had to bet, I'd say Scar lasts the longest. Not because of his skills (or the lack thereof), but because even the Minecraft Gods would never dare to kill such a positive character! Only Scar can kill Scar!
he was one block from death 10:55 his not going to survive dis
Bruh i almost got a heart attack because i thought you were actuly dead
I honestly didn't think I'd ever find a video of Scar that I didn't watch just laughing all the way through. This hardcore series has definitely done it. The first 18ish minutes I spent in a state of near heart-attack. I'm not sure who will end first here, me or the series. Loving the builds, the adventure and typical Scar-ness of it all though =D
The new farms look cool but I think they need some color behind them besides plain old gray stone. Would look a lot better in my opinion!
Why do I freak out almost each time you jumped off your house
Scar, watching this episode was the most stressful experience of my life. The base looks so cool though!! i love the farms on the different levels :D
Wait, that's impossible. How is he alive?!?
I think you need to put slabs under those trapdoors.
Hmmm
This was anxiety inducing. 🤮
scar playing hardcore gives me anxiety issues...while tabbed out draining an ocean monument.
Hey, Scar new subscriber here! AMAZING VIDEO! I was smiling through out🙂🥰 I may have just become scarred for life! Love you!
Hi scar :D
38  minutes
A apple a day keeps the trident away
I believe you can make it to 100 hours, Scar. You were the one who lasted the longest on your red life back in 3rd Life.
My heart! This series is too much for my heart! Careful Scar! Love your vids
13 minutes in the episodes and he almost died 5 times
Bro you gonna need netherite armour seeing your dangers
Im scarred for life not because i didn’t subscribe but because the anxiety of scars near death experiences
I know your gonna make it to 100 hours good luck :)
I love the series, I hope that Scar will survive the series. I know he can
Scalding cold water? That doesn't make sense
Imagine if scar was the only one who survive and completed the challenge      That would be awesome!
cool skara
The house shape reminds me of the swaggon rocket, so I like to think this is where the rocket ended up after hc8 and it’s being repurposed
10:58 one block away from the end of this series
Yes
Grian Supposedly dies* Nobody: Scar:  "Do I get to keep his villagers  ?"
Well your late 🏃💨
Watching Scar is pure anxiety
10:50 This is made me anxious
The creeper! Sneaks up on you everytime and even got PearlescentMoon's world.
Scar is the textbook definition of Minecraft Youtubers that go "So I did some building off-camera..."
Omg this was the most stressful Minecraft video I’ve seen in a while
Scar is literally giving me a heart attack with this series 😭
I am excited to see if scar can make 100 hours, though also scared for him xD
scar My anxiety, please
21:05 pardon?
Please, please, please, please, PLEASE clear out the trees and dirt from the river under your house.
Scar don't jump like that my small heart ❤️ can't handle that pressure 😅
Me: *puts on scar video to relax* Scar: *jumps off base without looking* Me: "AAAAAHHHH!"
I'm loving this series. keep up the great work! :)
the first of what i assume will be many times this is asked: “how is scar still alive?”
17:00 tell me this whole moment isn't scripted. literally goes into the cave and there's a torch in it.
if i was you i would put brown carpets over the trapdoors so u can't click them, because if i know you good enought i know either you or grian is going to click it and it will end up with you dying
However many heart attacks you THINK you will have watching this episode, I promise you will have more. JFC Scar I can’t take this 😭
I have a quick question scar how have I not had a heart attack already
how have u not been killed by the tree base
The fans should start placing bets on each episode, currency of their choice,  if Scar dies or not… Replies, what is your bet for episode 3?
E
This series should be titled “Scar does Hardcore in the most dangerous way possible.”
Get some armor
Pearlescent moon already died in her world 2nd day!  You all should rib her mercilessly 🤣
Skeletons will end your series, but drop creepers will give you heart attacks. They are the things of nightmares.
maybe a massive brige from mountain to mountain would look very nice
Grain : doubts scar on ep 1  Scar uploads an ep 2
If his base isn’t the death of him I will be surprised.
Scar. I nearly had a heart attack at several points in this video. Please don't do this to us. :(
Scar " Now you lower that weapon my friend" Also Scar. Blindly throws bread at a pillager  Edit: The scariest mob in minecraft is a vex. You can't hide from it and it does loads of damage while being able to fly and is almost impossible to hit
Me realizing this is gonna be a 10 episode series max because you put so much time into each episode
How in the WORLD did he survive that triple trident threat? I feel like even Grian or Joel would've had a rough time with them. Good job Scar!
Scar thrives off our collective heart attacks
This episode was amazing!
I love this series because it gives me a lot of suspense
My anxiety rose significantly watching this video
Mark my words fellas he is gonna make it to the 100 hours of Hardcore( pronounced super fast) Minecraft. Best of luck scar. May Allah grant you good health ♥️
Scar give it back-
awe hey scar!!! hope you feeling better, and getting stronger! much love from everyone!!!
I really want scar to make it but I’m still constantly scared when I watch his episodes
scars kind nature makes him give bread to a pillager :)
I don't know if I can watch this hardcore series, the amount of times my anxiety hit peak ranks is uncountable.  You got this!
I think if Scar just made sure to fill his hunger bar every time he could eat he would be a lot less likely to die.
head in hands this man is like a cat, narrowly escaping death
10:33 imagine being the pillager and some man builds a tree over a massive gorge and then places his house swinging from it- only for the man to thrown bread at how underprepared you look  -and then the man IMMEDIATELY launches off the tree and lands in shallow water 1 block away from shore
you can 3x3 craft ore into more compact ore blocks for more inventory space. Also axes do more dmg than swords, and don't do sweeping dmg.
Scar! How do you live like this?! I've never been this stressed over a minecraft video before. You were so close to death so many times.
That whole base is so unbelievably beautiful
Congrats scar for surviving and well done on the base!
I usually try to take out the skellies first, if the creepers haven't noticed me yet. :)
Scar has some serious plot armor
10:51 OH. MY. GOD.
Your base looks amazing Scar! And it’s a lot more safe so that puts me at ease a little bit. But the amount do time you almost died today definitely gave me anxiety…stay safe Scar!
I wish grian watches this video
Scar... I really hope you survive this.. I am rooting for you..  I just hope you can understand why I would not be surprised if you died.
Overconfidence is slow, but insidious killer...
Scar survived first episode already a miracle He also survived second episode!? This is a dream?
Get some feather falling boots please.
The Anxiety u gave me dude!
I really love this, thank you so much for sharing! I dont get out much and this is just what i needed today.  I also love Minecraft and me and my grown son have a world we are building, and we are just about ready to fight the dragon 😊
10:54 a n x i e t y
If you survive all 100 hours I will donate all my money to any charity you wish
I love you scar but it wasn't funny to me when you stole an enchanter and a diamond
Can you fix the peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepppppppppppppppppppp sound in the backround plissssssssssssssssss???????
What a man worst nightmare is seeing a baby zombie full enchanted diamond armor with a enchanted diamond sword and riding a chicken.
10:55 scared me so much, I thought he would die
early
IMPROVEMENT :  - Add railings onto the pathways and farms.
My money is on Scar being the only one to reach 100 hours!
You know what they say; "An apple a day keeps the tridents away"
scar you're killing me stop jummpimg
Oh my goodness scar stop jumping off the platform I nearly screamed 😱😂
You know, as much as I like Last Life, I feel like mixing it up with this sort of "Survival challenge" series is a good idea.  Maybe tweaking the server to make certain things more difficult or alter progression, or buffing monsters and monster spawning, or adding custom monsters that change the profile of the challenges.  This kind of series has a lot of potential!  And one can only consider what happens if you were _combine_ the two concepts...
Dude scar, how how how did you not die. So many times in the caves and climbing up like dude!
grian is not going to try to get his enchantment table back, he said there is no point trying
spoiler: Scar will die in 3rd ep.
I believe in you scar i know you can make it to 100 hours. :)
The non mob I fear the most is a piglin brute, evoker or  wither skeleton with a bow
Grian and Joel at 20 hours: Full Netherite.... Meanwhile Scar with his enchanted iron armor. Ps. I love the temporary change of content to HARDCORE.
Definitely wanna see a Zeppelin flying up to the minecart
missing that snowy fox that was hanging out on the side of the mountains for a few shots :[[[[[
Good viedeo pls use grian skin to annoy him
I LOVE THAT FUNNYNESS AND CREATIVITY
I THINK U DESERVE 20 MILLION SUBS BRO
I love how this series is going and excited to see how long Scar is gonna last!
I think god is on his side because he is so lucky. (idk how is he still alive)
Oh what a perfect way to spend my lunch break—with Scar. Mildly triggering my anxiety with his unnecessary risks, but always such a joy to watch. ❤️
Tri-trident! Friggin' scary man. Way to survive. As always, love your builds.
Scar. Beautiful boy man. Fences around your farms please. You done did a frighten.
I love the superfast build mode music!
You built a base in hardcore that is better than anything I’ve ever even thought of building! Great job!
scar is 99% not going to survive until the end
My brain screamed "SCAR!!!" in a grian voice SO MANY TIMES throught this episode
Ello Scar. Introduce Grian to some tnt prank? Ah ha.
I think he needs to change his channel name to “Anxiety Times With Scar”
Amazing Content Scar. Was on the edge of my seat there for a while, but we're rooting for you.
Scar in hardcore with 3 hearts:  "Are you ok Dog? Here eat some mutton"
Get feather falling 4 plz
Thanks for the video, it was fun.
Scar just loves giving us heart attacks, doesn’t he?
The skill! The focus! How *does* he do it??
Secretly scar is the best hardcore Minecrafter ever, he just likes adding a bit of suspense to his videos.
watching scar jump off gives me anxiety everytime
Skeletons have killed me the most, they are my greatest enemy
I knew he took the enchanting table when he left for the diamond.  LOL
can we all admire the dedication scar has you can see the jump in time for building and then just think about hermitcraft
I see scar enjoys giving us a feeling of having our hearts plonk down into our stomachs like potatoes each time he falls off that plank.
hello!
I'm calling it scars gonna get 72 hours
I get so scared that if I was sitting in a wheelchair I would have fallen of several times just during this episode.   Scar, keep staying alive and give us your superb content ❤️
Unsure if scar is more likely to die from a skeleton or his own base
I love your videos scar you are the best keep the god work
Is it just me or does grains base look a bit like an eco clam
I think your farm's look prity good
Shaming Scar into taking down this build and making it even better is quite an accomplishment.
I think this series is just a race between you, Joel and Grian to see who can cause more heart attacks first. You have me at the edge of my seat yelling at the screen! 😭😭
Scar’s builds are breathtaking!
How are you still alive
:)
the amount of times scar almost died in the span of not even 10 minutes is.... my heart cant take it
Scar: "steals wheat from grian because he is hungry"  Scar five minutes later: "gives bread to a pillager"  XD
You need so many more fences for your own safety please
Here's a challenge, watch the full episode again and make a comment leaving a time stamp each time Scar almost dies
Creeper,but why are you fighting skeletons without alternating between your shield and sword?(stop jumping😵)
How'd he survive that? 3 trident drowned?? That's not easy even with netherite
scar stoop scarring me
cool
Can’t wait for the rest of the series :)  Prank people. :)
Scar was near death so many times that I think he might have plot armor in this series XD
the fact that he doesnt have his shield on him at all times seriously frightens me
HOW MUCH TIMES DID YOU NEARLY DIE I CANT TAKE THIS 😭😭💔💔💔💔
Scars impression of Grian will never not get me
The tempting fate is strong with this one
I was so scared the whole time
Scars base is by far my favorite ❤️
hi
You are SO good!
I have a lot of confidence he will survive 50% of this 100 hour challenge
Hello
you didnt
10:53 who else got scared that he would die here? Edit: and here 17:20
I agree skeletons are easily the most dangerous and annoying mob in Minecraft. Creepers are easy to deal with since you can just block your legs from the explosion and be ok.
OML EVERY SECOND OF THIS IS SO STRESSFULL SCAR STOP AMLOST DIEING OML
What’s the seed for this world, it looks so cool I’d love to start a single player in it
Baby zombies are the worst     but in seriousness, Creepers and Witches are my least favorite.
you got pretty lucky this episode!:)
I reckoned if Scar can make it past the first night he can probably make it to the end (though I did only give it 50/50 to get past the first night). If Scar has good cause to play cautiously, he'll play cautiously. Probably.
Scar did you know you can feed your dog rotten flesh to heal. As bad as that sounds XD.
I’m 16min in and honestly. I don’t j ow how you have not died.  My guy….  Too many close calls!
Creeper! Please Scar, please stay away from revines, creepers will drop on you like drop bears to tourists.   Also beware of baby zombies.
11:50 definitely skeletons. Because at least with zombies and creepers you can kill them from a distance with a bow. but with a skeleton, they can hit you with their own bow and that's annoying. :P
Scar: Is scared by 3 Trident-Guys Grian: First time?  Pandaros Excelsior
I am always so happy to hear your voice 🤗
scar you should save your cords to never get lost
Yes time to stress out
10:54 You were literally an inch away from death 😭😭😭
Honest to god... you stress me out with these jumps and every time you go caving
If I see scar blindly leap off one more ledge I'm going to cry
Scar gives me anxiety by doing half the things that could kill him.........
Scar is going to die from jumping off his house
17:35 gave me a heart attack
Hi scar I’m a big fan have fun!
Usually I watch Minecraft to calm down. And this is not helping my blood pressure, oh my lord
10:55 At this very second, Scar is falling in a narrow edge between life and death.
Every episode I will be expecting suddenly death until you make it 100 hours. Hope you can make it there Scar!
I dislike Skeletons compared to Creepers. I manage to take care of creepers early game with just a stone ax and jump criticals. But without a shield, I am terrified of skeletons.
This video raises my blood pressure soooo much! I’m as concerned for my own well-being as I’m am for yours, Scar!
HOW DID YOU SURVIVE FALLING OF YOUR BASE LIKE THAT.
Scar is absolutely going to die by missing the jump from the plank.
this gives me so much anxiety...
Mr. scar i am most scared of mr. bob the creeper building i spectors and blazes
i suggest you extent the plank platform, or your bound to miss the jump sometime!
What's your favorite watch you own?
Scar : EAT!!!!!
between you and me, I think scar can do this  I mean he did make it to the end of 3rd life and that was with other people actively trying to kill him
11:50 I think spider and squid/glowsquid
Did you use God Mode?  I think you used God Mode.   I have no way of knowing though, so if you did it legit, I commend you.
I’ve died to too many creepers! They are the worst 😂
Im loving your videos Scar there so funny and entertaining . Keep out the Good work 😄
Why do you say hardcore as "HARD-CORE!"?
I swear, in this series every 2 mins I have a heart attack
I can't believe Scar not only built his base super high up where falling is certain death, but he made his floor out of trap doors. You know, the things that open up when you click, as floors, where falling is certain death. Plus this is Scar we are talking about. This can't end well
11:50 I fear the Creepers the most. At least with the other mobs, they give you a heads up of their presence.  Unlike Creepers who dial it up to eleven  at a second notice.
I love seeing your videos Scar! And i am truly impressed with your progress so far.
*100 hours⏰* in *HARDCORE😲 minecraft*
i stand by naming scar the scare man bcuz everytime Everytime he manages to make me think its the end of hardcore
What's the worst mob??? On this server it's called "GoodTimesWithScar". Gives me a jumpscare each time he builds a hanging base out of trapdoors and a jump-bridge over land.....
I'd say I fear Skelingtons the most. Only seconded by drop creepers. But even then it's only cause they tend to destroy my base. I always seems to find Skeletons in groups, and I never seems to have my bow on me, so they are a huuuuge pain.
The name of the guy with the cane in jurrasic park is john hammond
Scar is going to make it all 100 hours
Your base is really quite convoluted scar, you built it out of trap doors hanging from a tree that's hanging off a cliff.. in 1.18 lol.
watching scar almost die to mobs gives me anxiety
Love you Scar keep doing what ya do!
10:54 ngl, my heart stopped  Edit: also, the base is so beautiful and unique!! Great job!
I just killed a man… uuuuuuh do I get his villagers lol 😂 you are so funny scar
Even though Scar doesn’t die, seeing him jump or row down that plank kills me everytime
Do not like creepers over skeletons
Creeper. The silent killer.
idk lol
❤️U Scar
Skeletons are scarier than creepers. Believe me, I have my own hardcore series and every time an arrow lands it never fails to jumpscare me.
HARDCORE! MINECRAFT!
You almost gave me a heart attack at 10:55
scars house looks like a bird house
I hope you survive for the 100 hours. It is always wonderful watching you playing Minecraft. :3
please build a rope bridge going across the whole gorge, I think it would be really coooool.
please make a big pool under your house, I'm sure it will save your life so many times
Oh man if he died during that intro when he jumped off his base. Shortest episode ever but most hilarious 😂
Scar you might want to have a lot more armour
The "Scar Im'a Pro " sign should return since this is the last life server
wake up babe new goodtimeswithscar upload
HELLLO DOES KIND REPLY??
Can we have let’s  play together scar I am a bad builder and you could really help me I have Java on my computer
Fun fact when this is posted no one has finished the video.  (Love you Scar but Ep. 3 is the one 🥺)
9:20 Scar's impression of Grian. :D
This is beyond seinsce
Let’s all admit that Scar will always own a piece of our hearts ♥️
After surviving 2 last life series for so long i'm confident Scar can survive 99 hours here
hi great to see                 scar being able to survive
Dont worry, guys. Scar survived the first 10 hours, he is on the last life server and he is in his last life-form, so he will survive until the end.  Pandaros Excelsior
Scar surviving two episodes of a hard-core series?  Thanos: Impossible...
Scar:building his base. Joel and Grian: getting netherite armor, tools, and defeating the ender dragons.
Never been this early!! You go Scar, we know you'll complete this 100 hours in mchc!! Sending love
Let’s go Scar! You can survive the 100 hours!
It's back!!!!
My money is on Scar out living Grian. Taking bets now!!!
nice
Poggers my dude
I love how you always take the enchatmenting table I laughed as soon as you attempted to distract Grian I watched both of your videos Great love to the both of you.  I fear Creepers
Firstly can we talk about how scar survived. Thought the video would have lasted around 20 seconds
Watching your videos while working on my art is very therapeutic for me :)
I really want to flick the trapdoors and want to see scar fell down on the tree leaves 😂
Go Scar, prove all the doubters wrong and get to 100 hours and more!
Good luck Scar!!
ur gonna reach 100 hours u can do it scar!!!
It's my birthday today and this is the best present ever
Doing school work late at night has its cons! Thanks for making me less stress and making my day better :D  (edit) And a good way to wake up from all the scares he gave D:
I'm genuinely scared for Scar's life watching this.
hi scrar! mabye you will see  this, wanted to say that i love your videos!
Yay. Scar upload day!!
Im proud of you, scar. You havent died yet, i cannot explain how impressed i am.
I AM SO EARLY THIS TIME CANT WAIT TO WATCH THISSSS!! YOU GOT THIS SCAR I BELIEVE IN YOU
We believe in you Scar!! You can survive for a 100 Hours!!
I am depressed 90% of the time but when scar uploads I am happy for half an hour
Just built different innit
We can all agree that he never fails to entertain us
Alrighty, let's collect bets on how long Scar will survive. Suggestions accepted in hours and episodes :) My bet: Scar will die in Episode 5
Out of all hardcore series, it will be funny to see Scar last the longest
Double layering the trapdoors will make your base somewhat death-proof and more importantly Grian-proof
I'm proud of you Scar! Your base looks amazing and you lasted so much longer than anyone thought. Keep going and kick that 100 hours off the plank 😁Thank you for all the fun ❤
yay!
Thank you for such amazing content Scar!
Scar and hardcore are words that don’t usually mix but I think you can make it to 100 days
I have a suggestion for a super hero name  The scar of justice
Great vid as alway scar!!!  This series is the best with you and Grian I hope Mumbai joins too!
If Scar survives 5 episodes I'll be speechless
Hi Scar I love your vids how’s Jellie?your cat is so cute🥰🥰
Scar no offense but like you having one of the highest death counts in HERMITCRAFT is rlly not a good combo with a very dangerous tree house.
I love your vids
Watching scars videos with his merch on just feels good😊
He got a episode 2 Impressive
Good job not dying! As someone who dies even more than you do, I'm proud and impressed <3
Hi scar i love your vidio
Hi
Why when anyone says hard-core now they sound like they are about to shout parkour afterwards, to me.
I love how grian was even surprise you stayed alive the first episode
I’d love to see you build two giant trees, one hanging from each side of the gorge, which both meet in the middle to form a natural bridge.
It's not a mistake It's a MASTERPIECE
I am always waiting for a new scar video! Happy!
Just stop build a staff you can live in
I have faith in you Scar!
