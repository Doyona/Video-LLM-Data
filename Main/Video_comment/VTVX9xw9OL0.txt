I Love The E-Tron. Yeahhh!
Click bait. He said he really liked the car.
MOBIL SPORT ELEKTRIK BESAR POWERNYA 44.😊
That smile and laugh says it all. Just rip it and have fun life is too short not to scare the shit outta yourself every now and then. RIP Ken thanks for all the good times you showed us
so rare to see KB without a hat on. @ 5:34
I've worked on space ship movie props 😊
The video ends at 8:09.
that might be the greatest sounding na v8
The v8 sounds sooooo good, the e tron sounds Shite
So glad Audi made a dream come true before that second life. Rip
RIP Ken❤
gonna miss this legend so much. thank you for showing me the magic behind cars💚
He is eternel with you tube 🤗😇
One of our Car- guy Heros. So sad he will spend eternity (likely) in hell. Never ever did I hear him giving any credit to Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. You dear reader, do you have the guts to stand up for Jesus. Remember "those who are first, shall be last and those wo were last, shall be first" Jesus also taught that anybody that is shy of My name, for Him I shall also be shy before the gates of heaven"  Enjoy life BUT acknowledge you sin, confess your sins before the Lord and accept Jesus Christ into your life as you redeemer, only then shall you truly live a quality life that is worth. Love from Africa.    Reply
Hans Joachim Stuck is a legend. Later he was test driver for Porsche (only race cars)
Me párese mentira que no lo tengamos más a Ken Block lo estrañamos mucho el Uruguay entero Loves 😍 qué descanses en paz pésame a la familia 🇺🇸💝💝💝💝
I was surprised to 1st hear about Ken Block passing away a few days ago 😔   My Condolences to the Family   He was an amazing Man and driver who enjoyed many of lifes privileges...   He will be missed greatly and leave behind a mark that cannot be easily erased.   I to have done car racing in the past building up a classic car with nitrous oxide and have lots of experience with ATV's and sledding and diesel trucks and trucking for a living..   One of the must important things I learned in life is that there is a Super Natural GOD that Created us and we are not here by the evolution lie of a big bang or created by aliens, etc.   GOD is exactly who He says He is in the kjv Bible and I accepted His Son JESUS CHRIST into my life over 22 years ago and never regret it and wouldn't trade the whole world for my Eternal Salvation   There is a real place called Heaven with Eternal pleasures and hell a place of burning in fire...   I don't know if Ken block accepted Christ as his Lord and Saviour but the main thing is that each of that are currently alive have to or we are doomed in our sin because we rejected the free Gift of forgiveness offered in Christ.   There is a Price For Our Sin―Burning in Hell Forever.     Romans 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”   Here are 4 Absolute Truths all Mankind needs to Grasp: 1 we are GOD'S Creation  2 we are on GOD'S Earth ( turf ) 3 we are under GOD'S Commandments ( layed out in the kjv Bible with the 1st One to: BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND BE SAVED AND LEARN FROM THAT POINT ON IN THE SCRIPTURES ) 4 GOD Absolutely Loves us but won't force Himself on us to Obey Him. 5 If we reject GOD and His Salvation in Christ and don't want anything to do with Him, then we won't experience any benefits from Him...   It's kind of like if you were Ken Blocks best friend you could go riding with him and race car driving together and hang out at his place for a BBQ and laughs but if you never knew him, then you wouldn't get to experience fun times with him and his toys, etc.   That's basically the principle of any Relationship!   GOD is the inventor of Relationships and wants one with you and I.  I speak from experience that GOD is the most Wonderful friend anyone could ever have and a Big time help in times of trouble I experienced Many times in my life... Sure is Great to have the Creator backing you up when trouble in life hits..   So I just want to share some more information below because I want everyone to be Saved and escape hell and enjoy Eternal Life in Christ Forever 🙏   There is Good news!   Jesus Christ is coming soon to take the Christians out of here in what is known as the Rapture.  The kjv Bible Prophesies say it and the time is at hand before serious destruction comes on those left behind.  There is 7 years tribulation coming after the Rapture that with make 2020-22 look like a piece of yummy cake!! You know, a lot of people think that God came to give us laws and more laws, but it's not true.  Jesus Christ came to do one thing, to offer us Grace.   John 3:16, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”   He did not come to condemn you, he came to Love you and to save you. John 1:17 KJV  "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."   There is a law of Love when we recieve Grace.. A lot of people think God is mad at them, but nothing could be farther from the truth.  God poured out all his wrath out on Jesus, the debt for sin has been paid, "It is finished"  That's fantastic news!   You are the apple of God's eye... He holds nothing against you... He rises to show you compassion... and He is totally for you... You don't ever have to earn your way to God, all you have to do is receive. When you receive Jesus Christ you are guilt free, there is no more condemnation and no expectation of punishment. The price for sin has been paid, the judgement executed and all anger toward sin is exhausted. So nothing you have done or ever will do will be counted against you.  Every second of every day, His banner over you is love. ( after you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour,  just focus on Living Righteously instead of sinfully.. Read the kjv Bible to learn about God and how to Pray,live and think Right,etc. )   Just acknowledge your need for God.  The bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.(Romans 8:28.) No one is better than anyone else, we are all equal in the eyes of God.    Acknowledge that Jesus paid the debt for the sin of all humanity. God demonstrated his own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) No one is left out.  All of us are in need of grace and everyone is accepted by Jesus.   Acknowledge that Jesus is the Son of God.  God loves you so much, that he gave His only Son, so if you believe in Him you will not perish but will have everlasting life. God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. Anyone who believes in Him has been acquitted, but anyone who refuses to believe in him has long since been under a death sentence without knowing it. ( Read John 3:16-18) Why?  Not because He is being exclusive, but because He knows that no amount of keeping the law can make you holy. His shed blood and finished work on the cross is the only way to be righteous before God. Notice there is no work involved. He came to put the world right again in His time, not because of how good we are but because of how good He is.   No Christ... No Peace... Know Christ... Know Peace Forever... John 3:16 + Romans 10:8-10 GOD Bless you 🙏
wonder why forza horizon or motorsport don't get vision cars from audi or ferrari like gran turismo...
#43 - I have been a huge fan of yours for the last decade, if not longer.  Going to miss you and your videos.  God Bless Ken Block, and to your family - this is a man that is loved by the entire car community.  He will never be forgotten and will live on.
😢r.ip
😭😭😭😭
Shred in peace Ken, shred in peace. You were such an inspiration for many young guys like me.
6:27
You could tell after all the cars he's driven. He loved the heritage.
Miss your ass already
WoW, one lucky S.O.B. to be able to drive anything from the halls of Audi History.. R.I.P. Ken
Not really Ken block fan , first time I watch one of his videos on YouTube he was driving SXS X3 in snow with snowmobile tracks on it since then I Been watching his videos, he seem like very cool guy and great driver, he sure going be missed , I can't manage what his family going through right now R.I.P Ken Block gone way to soon
the smile on his face when driving the cars man, cannot believe hes gone, rest in piece ken❤️
and now your sign the history of this car, sweet dream 🥺
R.I.P. Ken
RIP LEGEND
I love how Ken was just fundamentally a dork. To be able to have the preternatural focus to be a great race driver, and then drop back to being a little kid in a toy was a gift.
Wir werden dich vermissen :(
May Ken RIP 🙏🏻 🪦 😌 ☹️ 😔 😢 2023
We will miss you buddy 💔💔💔
Rip 🪦
race in peace legend
#hoonitforken RIP Ken block
RIP KB, this Generation DK!
R.i.p Ken Block
RiP
Rest in peace 🙏
Rest in Paradise Ken Block 💐 🕊️ 🙏🏾  watch over Lia and your family !!!
Going to miss the childish enthusiasm he brought.  RIP Ken, thank you for always sending it 11/10
Game changer
I notice no flame-retardant suit for driving the electric car.

Can we all take a moment to recognize the gentleman maintaining his professionalism throughout  this vid? Cool and calm under the pressure of the hoons?
Nie! Soory dość Psudoekologii!
Sir redbull on 2  Audi : yes  Redbull : wtf with the MONSTER cap
Audis most bad decisions ever.  Take a guy from Europe instead, and not a guy who thinks the Globe is in orbit around him. He knows shit about Europe and the Audi legacy.  Take a Monster and get the f... Off. Imagine this clown in the Swedish or Finnish Woods for a real Rally.  He wouldn't even know what SS Course would mean... Just a joke.
Ken Block is awesome 😎
looks like toto wolff in the e-tron when his helmet is on
The B8 DTM there tucked into the corner parked in makes me and my B8 sad, give more love to the B8!
Now ken is driving Audis.....they will fly out of the us dealerships like hot potatoes !
All those videos are awesome  love is Chanel
Lucky guy for an amazing driver.
That Audi e -tron vision GT sounds pretty sick to be honest
That 11.5k RPM v8 is insane.
🤔 "Dream Come True Type Stuff" Understatement of the century 💯 I'm living my Audi dream vicariously through Ken rn👍👏
Gr8 vid by Ken n thank u audi for letting Ken drive yours cars
Nothing exciting about the whine of electric motors, the V8 Audi was sweet though
In years of watching Ken, this was the very first time i saw his hair
5 cylinder turbo cars are the best!!! And the sound is the best!! My first car was a 5 cylinder turbo Volvo 850 GLT. Best sounding car I’ve ever owned!! Pretty fast as well!! Can’t wait to own a 5 cylinder Audi some day!! Hopefully a RS3 heavily modified to be as close to a rally car as possible. Ken you definitely have the best job ever!!! So wish I could be living your life all the time lol!!
Lucky ass mfker, I'm so jelly rn like he LEGIT DROVE museum LEGENDS/:
Getting to hear that Audi V8 in the high RPM's was awesome!! I'm so jealous of Ken right now, almost as much as the last one where he got to whip around in one of my favorite rally cars!! Lucky Bastard😕😁🤣😂🤣
The future is electric however as a LS/6 speed manual owner I can fully appreciate the difference in Ken's expression while driving the DTM vs Vision GT.
Also, love the sound of that V8 but I also love the sound of that e-tron
Sorry, but Ken Block without a hat or racing helmet on just looks weird to me.
did ken block left ford?? Lately hes been doing tons of audi stuff, and I dont see the ford logo on his racing suit anymore
Oh look, Ken Block is scumbagging the Audi museum again.
Damnnn
Electronic Scrab 👎👎👎 The only one and the only real thing is the sound of a petrol engine V8 with Big Turbos ‼️👍✌️😎
They should figure out an intelligent suspension based on G-Force, make the car avoid messing up your steer.... Duh...
Vote Timo for President!
Well, you say group A was milder than group B, but they were faster, of course due to moved on technology, but still.
that E-car sound like a damn DC10 taking off.
I bet the motor rotor-bearings fail constantly, causing catastrophic powertrain failure like the 2.0T's timing chains and tensioners.  It's a good thing Ken Block has lots of money and sponsorships to repair all the mechanical failures that Audi won't fix.
Ken is living all of our dreams. So cool of Audi to let those cars out of the stable.
9:57 that boring sarcastic laugh! lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That R8 Ultra in the background😱😱😱Ken please drift that!!!!!!!!!!
Super video thanks Audi thanks thanks Ken, Audi its my ❤️ ✌️👍👍💪💪👁
I've never owned an Audi, I feel so dirty 😜
My dad went to learn in Ingolstadt as a mechanic and they even offered to look at these cars
That big ole shit eatin grin says it all.
seeing that E Tron makes your eyes light up. until its driving and there is a major anti climax. all you hear are the motors whining, and no engine screaming. the future of motor sport is really bleak.
Thats it!! Im buying an Audi
Electric vehicles are not exciting. 😪
Ken's grasp on F1 is.......strange?  A DTM is definitely not basically an F1 car underneath and 11,500 rpm isn't anywhere near F1 technology haha! It's more V-Tech 🤦🤣🤣🤣🤣  All messing about aside, this is another stunning video, with great historical cars 👌👌👌👍👍👍
That 1990 Audi V8 DTM sounds more like a NASCAR than a DTM, not gonna lie.
Fantastic video!!! The fact he was allowed to drive museum pieces at speed goes to show how much they respect and trust him...
Shout out to the insanely good steering feel of the B5 A4's I loved both of mine.
E-Schrott...der größte verlogene heuchlerische Hochverrat an die Automobilindustrie ! ! !
I had an aluminum block w 8  4 motion  I agree
Surprised Audi let him hit the track with minimal safety gear when driving the electric car.
as long as e-tron vision is the fastest one... that was the most boring thing i've seen on this channel so far @Ken Block
Looks like he’s gotta ask for permission to drive any Audi car 😕  He had the keys to all Fords back at Ford….
No
Boring Electric Car Boring
The powerslides and sounds dissttgggguusstttingggllyyy amazing
I’m so stoked Ken Block came to the VAG family, with Ken and Tanner on VW it’s winning all year.
The electric car was like watching a episode of Neighbours # BOOOOOORRRRRRIIINNNNNNG#
Ken, I love you man and love your videos but why do you keep promoting electric cars?!
#Audiforever  #Audilover
Jealous of Ken, he has an unfair advantage
KEN OFF CAMERA...GET ME A DAMN ROUND STEERING WHEEL!
Wonder how fast he got the Audi up to on the road drive to the racetrack!😆
The vision gt is a beautiful car and I’m sure it’s a thrill to drive but honestly, it looks like it’s about 10% as fun as driving the dtm would have been.
Der V8 klingt halt am besten. V8 sound is the best!!
Nice 💥👍💪
I’m not sold on EV racing. Where’s the bloody sound? 😳
Unimog photo bombing 😂👍
Mmm, electro shit ...
Audi 200 Quattro Trans-Am NO! Got the Audi D11 Quattro V8 DTM out 11,500rpm. Love this NA 3.6 V8 soundtrack 🇩🇪🔥
...wait, only 53k?
OMG at 9:20 that car sounds like a spaceship. I couldn't imagine how all that power/tech feels at your feet. My 98 camry sounds like that too but it's just the engine going out lol.
Electric engines sounds so stupid..  oh my haha
Goofball goes to Germany
6:38 for a second i thought there was a speedbump in the track XD
Wow, you all should put together a full length video (movie) on this trip. released on nebula/curiosity stream ftw?!
I'm not used to seeing Ken without a cover on so weird 😕
Haha, Ken's face driving the DTM  " 8D "  Then Ken's face driving the E-tron " >:O "  Cool stuff!
How old is this bloke block?
One of the most 'winningest' - ffs merica.
wow... that e-tron sound was crazy... yeah, the classic vroooom was missing, but the jet turbine sound wasn't bad either
So thankful that KB is on this planet for the Combustion to Electric era.
More amazing cars! Pity about the very annoying Hoonigan asshatery as always.
Judging by FACIAL expressions that V8  Wins every time.
10:17 ...  so does Ken have a hat on under his helmet... is he going bald or something. why doesn't he let people film him without a hat?
"This one Timo?  - Nope. "This one?   Nope. "This one?  - ......  "SOLD TO THE GENTLEMEN!"
I love the look of audi's new machines... so sharp and unique
Electric cars a cool but man that V8 sound gives goosebumps.
Sorry but there's something about cars that don't make noise that i don't like. I think part of the experience of driving or even watching cars is the sound. I enjoyed Ken driving that older V8 thing than the electric car, even if the E car was faster.
Its true though.. i get all the PR with audi using block wanting to put themselves back into the Limelight.. with Tesla crushing everything #asgodintended
11.5k rpm, that's the spice.
Ken certainly didn't seem happy driving that electric crap, you can see the joy, talent and how relaxed he was, driving something with real horsepower.
OMG that sound!!!
the Plaid has all of them for lunch..and twice on sunday
From manly engine roars to fairy wing flutters of a bullshit battery operated car, the world is dead!
At what point dose terrestrial performance become areal
jumalauta halti se siellä komeilee audin helmoissa
loved the all electric audi its the future     const = Electric
Insane.... Respect!
Ken has hair???  05:37
Ken looks like he's insane with his glasses off. Very appropriate
I want an autographed picture with Ken Block. Most people want to meet an actor/actress or a singer. I want to meet Ken Block
Beautiful E car but who cares! I’ll take a real engine and tons of loud revs any day.
Audi explained!
Ok, im back, i keep watching this awesome video. This time it was cool to see the employees in the background from many different points watching Ken. It would be they are excited with the direction.....as is Ken. Hats off Audi, thankyou.
I feel like not enough people take enough about how much the weight of electric cars changes their handling.
So much Audi goodness in one video.
Fucking sick ! THE FUTURE!!
Evs are a scam. Performance is simply the batteries ability to discharge without catching on fire.  They are toxic and charged with petro electrons. Fools paradise until unintended tech is invented, ideologically rotten.
Ken block having this nice head of hair, wears a hat all the time.
Highest point of the video is when we actually see Block hair
Wellllll…. I thought ripping (test driving) a 2022 raptor 700r was going to be the only mechanically induced boner I received tonight…  Fucking love old Audi’s..
Definitely alucky bastard sounds so good
Since Ken's too cool and experienced, i shit myself on that spin out on his behalf.
They should've immediately drained all fluids from every museum car in that garage after this run. 7 means 7 Ken! Lol
that E tron made me physically and mentally depressed
🎄Audi e-Tron Vision GT Prototype:  Sounded no different than a jet plane in take off;it appears to me are the driving characteristics now about encountering flight characteristics?.So what I'm getting at is the prototype all about flight that would be a road race Grand Tour car not a GT car.I love the older cars Audi is working with in every way to finally get this close to the things that were happening then is amazing.🥥  🌴I love all of this stuff & especially the older cars at Audi  & the era    Playstation * VIP 🌮🌮🌮🌮
They had my dream car. Unimog
Kermit ain't got SHIT on how Green I am. With Envy, that is.
It's so funny to me how Timo let's them drive the one of a kind prototype but doesn't let them drive the trans am
Man what great experience!
E-Tron would be so bad ass if it was a V12 or Compound Turbo V8
Man i love Audis 💪🏽❤️
Ken Block is cool, but not so much the tool that follows him around
ken block in an electric car = life truly is over now
Wow !!!!!!
I wish I had something to Hoon
11:10 Ken Block is A LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kids: THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T DO DRUGS OR CRIME!!!!!!!!!!!!
so funny that u can hear this guy is german lol
When is it my turn bro
To add: He's not "Lucky", he's elite skilled at what he does. Work.  Vision DT?   Didn't Bugatti? .. hmm
Oh how jealous must Lia be right now 😂
Jetzt mach Hans-Joachim Stuck sicher Augen, was man mit seinem alten Auto alles machen kann....
Ken block doesn't look like ken block without the cap and glasses
That vision Gt needs to be the next Audi R8 with a V10 engine in the back! As a swan song before the Audi goes all electric with their cars!
With his daughter putting on the pants with the Hoonicorn Ken just had to show us all he still drives the coolest shit ever made 😂
Thanks Forza!.....   Opps
The V8 sounds like a Nascar race car
Sick looking car but the e-cars are not nearly as exciting as something with a high rev'ing engine.
There's something about the lack of motor vibration and roaring that just makes this look like a boring ride, no matter how fast its going.
Bro got some crazy ass eyes lol
First time I’ve seen ken block wipe out 😂😂😂
9:03 the face that says "what is this car?"
That etron is an electric Bugatti with Audi headlights
So basically the Audi E Tron Vision GT is the next inspired/R8?!?! Well finally found next design not happy. But that gorgeous engine sound of the of the V8 DTM is why I’ll probably never be a fan of electric cars!
gymkhana germany soon at a nearest audi dealership
If all cars become electric instead of bio fuels. I’m not gonna be a car guy for long anymore. That electric shit sounds like crap and environmentally wise the battery’s are even worse
Audi cars are so rad I want an RS3 to replace my old A3.
If it’s electric why is there RPM/a tachometer?
Can’t wait for all the lithium to run out so this gay ass electric goes away
The look on kens face as he drives the v8 knowing what’s going on to the e car is like fun and knowing what’s happening to the future and wanting to learn such a gap and he will fill it with aplomb and grunge mixed into one
5:38 is the first time i've seen Ken Bleck without any hat or helmet
Im so jelly
how did they got out fast when the car crashed in the old days the rollbar is really high
Only Ken Block can explain extremely technical physics nuance in lamen terms.
Thank you mr ken block
There just had to be a Spinal Tap reference.
*Small* high revving cross-plane V8's sound the best!
SO COOL!!!!!!!!!
As much as a i know we need to get to all electric in the future. I am going to be one sad dude when there arent anymore cars going BWAAAAAAH PAP STUTUTUTUT PAPAP
Sorry guys but I can't get behind the electric car. To much bs in this so called green energy. Like all the coal power used to power these batteries. Or all the non green energy to produce the battery.  Plus all the plastic used in it which is  oil based.
That EV sounds lame.
Bravo Audi for letting the fans of your brand see museum cars being driven today. And that car, from 1990, sounds amazing and shreds.  I love Audi.
Ken and Audi, now?... Not an Audi fan, but Ken will change that lol
Mr. Ken Block is an very lucky man. Get to drive his favorite toys. Take care and thank you for posting this video.
This is absolutely epic publicity for Audi.
Audi is so far ahead of the rest, in term of marketing!
11,5000, eh?
Cheers to Ken, if anybody deserves the open door to Audi he does. Beautiful cars need to be driven and he is the guy to do it on camera. Can’t wait to see what happens next!
That's so fucking futuristic it's awesome. Even bugatti need to catch up on the design front imo,
Dude I got a total eargasm with that v8!!
Audi should allow Ken to drive everything that's driveable.   Legendary driver with legendary cars.
It was very weird to me to see Ken driving without a fire suit on. GO Team AUDI
Ken, you handsome man @5:40
Watching Ken’s expressions while his muscle memory and the electric car experience!! He’s like wtf I know what Maneuver to do… muscles were like, umm no memory of any of this CAP (:
Wow ! From the museum to the track ! Wow 💪💪💪
nothing better than legit wood trim on the center console of a car that revs to 10K+
Ok but are we going to talk about how we just saw ken’s hair
Well with doors like that I know why the driver getting in it was Stuck.
"I only went a little over seven thousand" Cars like "did I stutter?! Fuck yeah I did!" No ken, you pushed it to about 12 thousand!
"I see no sense in actually opening the door" Proceeds to opening the door to get in
What Ken loves about modern DTM is what I hate about modern DTM, applies to WRC as well. I loved the idea from before (the 90's) when you can walk in at a dealer and buy a car - then see a race car on TV that shares at least a chassis and a lot of parts with your wheels.
I was sitting here, with a smile from ear to ear watching ken thrash that V8, when the electric thing came in, I completely lost interest, everyone should use electric domestically so w can still have explosive racing, the future may be fast but somehow electricity made it boring
“Soooo which one of these do we get to drive” Audi: scheiße, nicht schon wieder 🤦🏾‍♂️
Good luck in the new race In 2022
This man is secretly testing the drifting capabilities of these cars. It's only a matter of time before he chooses his top 3 Audi cars and turning them into another iconic monster.  He's a mad scientist I tell ya!
Only reason Ken spun was because he couldn't hear the engine in that electric garbage.
Those Audi's were the good-looking once, IMO the newer ones are just getting uglier
I have an idea for electric cars. BUt no idea how to bring it into reality. But the video inspired me. IMagine some sort of adapter, that reacts to the accerlator, and makes a jet like noise when you drive, not super loud, but loud enough to get that audio feedback and for people to hear you
5:38 took me a few seconds to realize that was still Ken. Never seen him without a hat before. Weird. He looks totaly different without that goofy flatbill on
4:41 carbon fiber on a 1990.......This shit was so ahead of its time
Audi seems to understand that some cars, should be driven some times. Hat's off
That V8 is sick!
My face was the same as Kens when the door opened to the basement garage. I could not imagine being allowed to be around such a rich history of amazing machines
sounds great only from inside cockpit
8:56 - When I boot up my Playstation
I hope to see Lia making this kind of stuff on the future, collabs and some classic and special cars test drive, keep hoonin' bois 👌
Electric? Fuck off! You like NWO? Or someone pay you?
9:52 he totally tried to get it sideways there lol he was extra aggressive with the wheel. I see you Ken, aint no man gonna tell him to not hoon around.
Somebody at Audi cringed when they caught the Mercedes tow truck in the background
Ken's demeanour changed so much after he span that prototype. He was like in his head : 'can I say it's difficult to drive? I mean they are my new partners' He seemed really conflicted about what to say generally and I haven't seen him like that before. I know he isn't used to that kind of car let alone it being electric but his partnership with Audi, who were there seemed to be chipping away at his authenticity.
Imagine Ken Block and Hans Stuck as team mate's.
Hans Stuck was legend in those cars.  I especially loved seeing him drive the 5 cylinder turbos where he woudl keep the gas on to keep the turbos spooled while in a 4 wheel drift.
Ken is awesome😜!!!
Holy shit this was amazing. That screaming V8 sounds amazing. All  engines should rev to 11.
Geiles Motorgeräusch
Ken Block can become Audi crazy innovation test driver....
This is the best of both worlds Ken Block and AUDI 👍👍👍
I’m Ls biased but damn that thing sounds good!
Listening to that V8 scream and then watching the electric car.  This is not the future of motorsport...........
The fact that Audi is the one doing this type of thing blows my mind
I love how audi is just not afraid of putting the old glories in its full power after all this years. They know what they built, they know it won't break 😌😌
All I can say is you freaking lucky bastard Ken Block! I love cars and I've never even really been in a really fast car☹️
You can tell Ken is working hard in the Vision.  I have rarely seen his face that concentrated.
yeah, electric cars is going to be the death of motorsports for the audience.  the noise is mor than half of the show.  would watch the v8 audi all day long got bored watching the elctric thing after about 0.1 seconds.
That e-tron though! We're at the point that we're just testing the limits of rubber.
Bless Audi’s heart for their courage 🤪🤪
F ecars
The etron sounds like a jet! Congratulations on the new partnership, can’t wait to see what you and the Audi team build together!!
tyou should rly fire your editor this edits are so bad
Trust in the LORD of kings Jesus Christ Forever.
Hans-Joachim enjoyed watching this one as well.
Audi e-tron 24h du mans when.
I wanted to see the B5A4 BTCC car
You can literally see Ken's grim underneath his helmet!
Wow wow wow, what an awesome idea to drive these cars!
damn that thing sounds good.
its like... "this is how cars are supposed to be like... and here is the electric car that can do stuff, until you pull the plug"
Next time Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO 😍
It breaks my Heart see the end of REAL Auto Racing.
So nice, to see Dr. Crazy in the Video. Shoutout to Rouven :)
My Dad used to race stock cars a "few" years ago, I know he would listen to what the engine was telling him. Driving that electric beast has got to be a completely different experience.
If anyone is looking for a healthy kidney from a non drinker, it will cost you one silver R8 with dark red interior. 😁
dear god that electric car sounds like shit
Cant wait too see what Auddi is cooking for Ken
Did Ken drive on the Nurburgring??
It's official, Audi is much cooler than Ford......im American, so that hurts to say, but its true
Thx again Ken. Dominique (France- ROUEN).
Thx for all your videos Ken. I love the way you drives ..... .... and your smile. All the best. Dominique
The sound of that V8. Thank you for sharing guys!
Audi 👊 Rc models..
Ken's out here missing every apex in the E-Tron 🤣
No engine sound is horrible absolutely atrocious
I vote for the Group B car for Gymkhana 11: Berlin
Im still pissed he didnt get to rip the 90 GTO.. My abselute favorite car!!
1,5 plus since 5 okt..insane...when is the next video comeing ?...love this shit..seen this vid 3 times now ..lol!
Would love if you guys could highlight the Le Mans prototypes.
I can't wait to see what's being cooked up at Audi. You are definitely a LUCKY BASTARD.. Lol. You're such an awesome humble dude with a awesome love for HOONING !!  Oh Yeah the thing that kinda worries me about electric vehicles is the instant torque/power and not having the same feeling/sounds as a combustion engine. I can see where it can throw you off. 😃
Lucky Bastard.   New T-shirt company.  Copyrighted here. 😂
I guess electric cars will be the future of racing. Imagine every racetrack in the world fitting thousands of solar panels, so that all the racecars can charge there during events. Or maybe someone makes my idea real -- powered racetrack! It means as long as car makes contact with track, it can get power from track itself. It would eliminate the need to pay for fuel.
Drive it, win a race and hear everybody yelling: let's go Brandon!!
Incredibly talented and supremely lucky
Thats a beautiful car
Hooning
Even firing orders and smooth power. Why Americans took so long I'll never know. But that lopey cam sound is just for you muscle heads who don't know what's good for racing.
i feel like we missed an opportunity to take the draggy along. wonder what the 0-60 and 1/4 miles are
So strange seeing in Audi oversteer haha
That thing sounds AWESOME! It's like a mix of straight 6 and Coyote with a little bit of F1 sprinkled on top. So cool!!
Cool day out, I run a avant b8 that’s been delimited to it’s limit, and it’s just awesome drive, crazy top speed 👍
NO R8???
That DTM spec one sounded awesome!
This is so awesome, I love watching your videos and I am very happy for you to be joining Audi!
That v8 revs to 11,500? What size engine is it?
DTM was cool back then when the cars actually somewhat resembled production cars.
Ken is like a kid at the candy store 😂😂
Lol this is Great no fear
Cool stuff, hey Audi 😎🔥
vs 2018 DTM?
Dream come true! Wow. Thanks, Audi, for such a wonderful partnership.
I think for racing these cars need a prominent speed readout in the drivers FOV because they don't have the gear + rev sound combination to judge it.
🔥❤️
Gonna be a sad day when all race cars r electric
Respect for no music on the dtm part
Ken Block is “Rainman” in disguise
The Spinal Tap edit while driving the V8 DTM was AMAZING!
Forgot 190 evo spec II 1992 TOURING !
That e-tron GT sounds like a jet engine...  Coolest thing about these trips and videos is all the secret collections the manufacturers have hidden away that no one ever see's or even knew about
This was awesome 👌 👏
You could hear those tires hanging on and letting go at the same time with the vision GT.
First car give.. second car stay away with that bs
Sounds like a dragster
RIP Audi †1997
Mad props to the museum for letting Ken take a display out and thrash it.  That's awesome
5:42 says it all lol
Shart on nads
We live in an age where the most exciting looking racing car, sounds the most boring.
this is poor marketing for Audi, goes from a screaming V8 going sideways, to the sound of a vacuum cleaner...
Na I got to burn some dinosaurs the E Thingy did nothing for me but that V8 WOW.
I had a 1990 Quatro powered by a 3.6l v8 and I loved that car, it was just the most unique car I've ever driven as far as personality goes.  Bought it on 2016 from a guy that had it as a company car that was maintain the best I've ever seen as far as scheduling goes as far as maintenance
Once again I'd like to reiterate "you lucky bastard" lol 😂😂😂😂
He's probably the coolest oldest guy I know
when are you swaping to audi;))))
this intense pushing for the eletric power all of a sudden its exhausting. We already know the great reset and global warming agendas are pushing this. But we already found out that non-renewable energies are way more worst to envirement than the fossil fuels
stiff suspension and engines tuned to match tyres grip - what an understeery nightmare...
This shit is so good! 🤓
hes driveing it like it forza
ken looks like a little kid
Nah, stoped at the V8. I drive a Merc EV and loves its punch… but my E-class sounds like Real car!
Afer a month ohh back to ford
I think I just saw the smoothest spin out ever 🙆🏽‍♂️🙌🏽
where the heck is the shredding?
Dudes are obnoxious lol
Why didn't you drive the Trans-am Audi?
In Germany🇩🇪 we say: „ist die karre kalt, gib ihr elf-einhalb“ and we love it💪👍
It’s so much less exciting to watch an EV drive
They have no idea what they have got themselves into.
Bring back lucky bastard 🙄 I didn't know it ever went away 😁 Ken you lucky lucky bastard 🤪🔥👍✌️
"...The trunk maybe " 😅😅
This Ken Block is a fun guy.
Can the E-Tron powerslide/drift? Find out in the full video->https://youtu.be/cAPFisXLk6E
That v8 audi is dope
THAT'S A WRRRAAAAAPPPP !!!!!! OG
Too much glance.
I always wondered where they got bold tyres  for race cars from, ken makes them on his day off.
Damn ken is looking old these days :(
Literally coolest guy on earth 😎😌👏👏👌👌
EARGAZZMN!!!
The e tron is cool but boring
Idk .. beautiful, sexy, sounds great.  But I just need that loud *bangbangbang* of the exhaust and engine screaming
Too bad they wouldn't let you drift/power slide it, which is understandable. However, I don't think it would be as easy as I found out, the AWD system is very intrusive and makes it quite difficult to powerslide/drift. Let me know if you guys are able to. Full drift video coming up shortly! https://youtu.be/oxxMHEthmSo
Audi is my fav. Ken is my fav. I'm loving this series!
Forget  washing machines  just keep driving the wheels of those turbo beasts 👍
2:39 imagine every car in that garage being started at the same time
Audi fanboys in the house!
go race DTM bro
spectator view and sound of electric race cars = boring as shit
Povero cocomero !!!!Con una macchina così sarebbero in tanti ad andare più forte!!!!! Perciò non spingiamolo più di quello che è....!!!
Vorsprung durch Technik🔥
Maybe Ken can give turn signals so overpriced ringed VW's owners use them.
Wow that sounds 🔥 on point 👉
If Audi was smart with this they would put a video collage of kens laps with these museum cars. Would be a great ad
holy crap, Ken without a cap and sunglasses......you can go anywhere and no one will recognize you
vintage audis were excelent, electric audis are not.. no matter how fast they are, i5 turbo is the has the nicest sound…
So that's what Ken Block's hair look like!
Ugh love the sound of those performance electric cars. Sounds exactly how you think they should.
So when ken build an Audi will Audi keep it
Just love that induction sound of the V8!! Wow!
Now this is how you sell cars.
Awesome! Love Ken and Love AUDI !
Whenever Ken asks Timo if the car is allowed to drive, I only see fear in Timo's eyes... LoL
finally good content
It's crazy how good this audi V8 sounds 🤯🤯
I want Audi to come back to WRC as manufacturer sooo bad. They got the A1, and while there is a privateer effort for it, nothing is the same without full manufacturer support.
I feel sad that he's getting older..
Formula E can suck my balls, but this...?  I'd definitely watch a series if it looked like this.
I miss the mustang
Ken out here driving a priceless, historic DTM jewel like it’s a Hoonigan rally car 🙄 I’m both cringing and happy at what I’m seeing
Why does Ken always where a hat when he has good hair.
Ken needs his Hoonigan version of these cars… I’m sure Audi is capable of recreating their own cars.
Ken without a helmet  or hat looks so weird
They're literally taking all the fun and excitement away in a racecar with those electric motors.... no gas smell = no fun, no engine revving = no fun.
Its just not the same, shouldn't have left ford. The magic inst there
Not sure why Audi hired a drifter to promote their brand.  Monster Energy and the four rings don't really match for me.  His professional driving record is abysmal. More of a stunt driver, maybe?
You should make a drift car based on this Audi, a DTM inspired drift Audi.
That's what Happy looks like.
All this does is make me like audi a whole lot more
What a life this man lives.
Audi is like the apprehensive older brother to Ken the New Younger brother in law who just moved in and wants to play with all of Audis treasured toys from when he was younger. Ken Can i play with this one???? Audi  "No" Ken "What about this one!?!?" Audi "Sigh... Fine".
It actually looks good
Super smart move on the auto unions part, Ken Block , Hoonigan, thanks to Audi for letting us see some special cars. The future looks “AWESOME”!
The smile on Ken’s face when he was driving the V8!!!
Imsa gto Is best beast
Love the way Ken has a dig at the Audi technician, Oversteer! lol
The museum shows how afar off the pace Audi were back in the 80s 90s with DTM/STW etc
Ken Block IS shitman. it's just a media figure.
Walter Rohrl at 74 still is 2x faster than this guy.... 😑
Lucky bastard
Što je ovo ??? Kakvi komentari !!!!
Audi is Dead
Man the sound of those cars is music to my ears 👍
Ken Block is living my dream right now... 😂😂
Loving the spinal tap
An audi dtm gymkhana would be sick
Liked everything except the “Glorified Golf Cart”. C’Mon guys, really? Do the math. This won’t work mainstream worldwide without a serious breakthrough in power generation on a planetary scale.
Electric is cool, good torque, and probably the future of motoring ....but it inspires very little emotion.  Upon hearing that V8, I had shivers down my spine. Seeing and hearing the e-tron was cool and interesting, but that was about it.
“This is like the secret museum…” - [coordinates appear]
He’s definitely right about DTM being a great series.
Whoever at Audi who pushed for this series where you let a popular modern race car driver drive those iconic Audis deserves a raise. I am not versed in marketing but as an American I have never been more interested in Audi cars then watching these
5.41 that dad look without the cap
i wonder if he knew which motorsports royalti name was on that v8 dtm car?
Irgent wie, passt das nicht. Striezel sein Bolide, und der Heiopei fährt quer......uff
First car I bought when I moved to America was a used Audi 80 - 2 door coupe. I'd heard about Audi's "unintentional acceleration" lawsuits - and knew it was total BS and that the issue was just elderly Americans getting confused. In fact about once a week there'd be headlines about an elderly couple plowing through a Farmer's Market. I would leap to the defense of Audi - I loved the cars. This was before they resurrected the brand with the A4 et al - so they were still tarnished by the BS 60 Minutes reputation. Those five cylinders were magical - Instead of feeling asymmetrical or unbalanced, it felt more like a secret "turbo boost" where you wrung more from it than expected. I noticed it a lot on freeway passing maneuvers.  Then one day, driving back to my house in San Francisco on the 280 near Glen Park, my throttle cable snapped - and the car screamed horrifically - automatic gearbox only quieting down when I slowed into real first/second gear speeds. I couldn't get it to stop revving, no matter what I tried, so I figured, hey, it's super screwed up - maybe I can get to the cool auto repair shop on Army/Guerrero? (The only honest shop in SF) and so, engine protesting loudly, I crept all the way from Glen Park to Army and wailed into the garage.   I assumed it might be a write-off, but an hour later, my mechanic gave it back to me, completely fixed, for about $100. Only issue was the snapped throttle cable. He replaced it, good as new!  But technically speaking, that WAS unintended acceleration....
at 10:56 i noticed the welds on the steering column??
Cool but I got questiona, when everything goes electric, where do the old batteries get disposed?Where i live there are 3 million cars on the road. Thats a hige area needed  to get rid of them? Just askin.
WTF is that SUV behind Ken? 8:02
That would be cool to drive a car that has H-J Stuck on the side or hell Röhrl’s name 😍
I know Ken got to do some cool stuff when he was with Ford, but damn Audi is pulling out all the stops for him it seems, driving prototypes, vintage cars, it’s awesome 👍✌️
I don't care, the e-tron was so boring to watch. No noise? That's like driving a wheeled elevator or escalator...
I don’t care if the V8 is slower. With no noice it just lacks that certain something.
Can I drive the IMSA car, no, the Trans AM, no. DTM…..pan to ripping up the track. AMAZING!!!
Nice Commercial Ken.
What is bellow Ken's cap? Never see him without it.
I just love the childish Ken asking to drive the cars ahahah So good!  what an opportunity! Thank you for sharing this :D
Parece as viaturas do  Brasil .As cores são idênticas.
I'm definitely old school love that v8
2:40 ALL ICE cars are aspirated.......These are naturally aspirated the dude means......
⚡️❤️😎
Audi.. dayum.. major props for the museum driveathon. As a fan, hearing many gifted drivers say lack of feedback in ev's is awkward or a problem (and I assume maybe a little less joy inducing) I wonder how companies address it. Need to figure out a way to help drivers get feedback. Even I hold a gear and brake less into turns, use the trans to brake sometimes and maintain corner speed and attitude, so I'm not sure how to relate without seeing and hearing race cars do this. To be fair fans don't always hear engine sound, but without any engine sound it's hard to gauge speed and level of aggressiveness everywhere on track, and this should be a problem for companies and racing organizations. So how to compensate? Even if viewers could process multiple lines of racing team data or graphics showing drivers are x-amount throttle/brake, and simultaneously watch cars race, it can't be as effortlessly enjoyable as the instantaneous marriage of sight and sound. Example: ice car 7:10 vs 9:05 ev entering and exiting turns, ending with spin. On site he said "trippy" to watch /Ken said "unique" driving experience. Is this not as good? I think they mean it's cool as in neat, but not ice cool.
10 seconds is huge
What a dream, always loved the look even as a young bloke playing toca touring cars
Lucky U!!!!
No hate aber alles schon bei jp gesehen
I believe in Ken with Audi. I believe Ken can brake Nürnberg records if Audi gave him the right car😉..!!!
5:38 might be the first time I've seen Ken without some sort of hat on. Looks odd 😃
Now that! Is skill drifting that electric car that's not easy, is it?
Did anyone Racing Fan  except of Ken Block while driving this Prototype feel anything for this Electro Car?
At this point, Audi is going: “WTF did we let ourselves into?”  Timo has a great sense of humour, though, but gets super serious when he says “no”.
This guy is lucky
Lucky bastard... I want to drive a DTM car.
Everything is fine till electro... electro is just disgasting.
New formula 1 draiver
He's like a kid in a toy shop🤣
Love my 5000 CS Turbo....
oh so good...
The E-tron was so lame after the V8 but all of you knew that didn't you
This guy is aging and its showing lol
Кто-нибудь скажите Кену, что ауди v8 это не раллийная машина
I cant wait to see kens car
Lucky 🤬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Skip to 6:00 minutes if you want to see actual driving
I love that livery of the 90s cars.  The e-tron isn't bad either, they put something in a video game and made it.
These germans calling ken "shoemaker" needs to be a thing
Audi is saying we will be better then ford to you. What is the limit?
5:38 this is the first time i see ken block's hair
DTM "was"... now it's just another GT3 national championship
Loved these video especially the look into Audi history in the museum that a lot of people haven’t seen before
that v8 is just chefs kiss and then kiss again
Dude I can't wait for the next Audi hoon build.
SO awesome.
Damn... The dtm kinda sounds like the V1 hoonicorn
Whooop di doo, you drove a golf cart. Screw the NWO and their electric car bs
Spinal Tap " These go up to 11."
that look when he spun tho hahaha
I love what they're doing with electric cars the fact that they sound like a space ship is just icing.
lol the electric looks so boring driving around the track with barely no noise, the ice car looked like so much more fun
I can do that in my hyundai
🤯
_Was gonna comment on how lucky and privileged kb is to get to drive these cars but then again there are few ppl who can do what kb does_
Ken is such an awesome down to earth guy. I couldn't be happier for him! He will represent Audi well!
Take sound of the motor and smell of the gasolin away... where is the fun then? EV is fast, but speed is just part of the fun. So fu.k ev 😋
More exterior or drone shots would be sick. Could care less for the interior shots of Ken driving
So does kblock feel like all wheel steering would help the points where he feels like the car would just keep going in the direction he was having problems making it go?? I am glad this was like his dream come true. I hope who ever you work with an for next helps more of them come true for u. I wanted an still want to build a car that makes a veteran race car driver have to basically relearn how to drive it on tracts they have been on their whole life but make it safer for them at same time. Love watching yall send it.
Only americans to think parts bin rebadged VWs are something to write home about. Seriously... But coming from people that say "most winnigest", it shouldn't surprise.
I love how they changed the thumb nail and title to the electric car, shows how little us car enthusiasts care about boring electric cars and how much has-been brands like audi are trying to push for them.
Very classy of Audi to let Ken drive all those museum cars. Wow. Jealous.
electric vehicles are not a progression. they are a regression. you are completely disconnected from the experience.
BEE-EE-AYYYY-UTIFUL
Talk about a literal dream!
what was the movie 11?
Awesome of Audi let Ken thrash the museum car when Ford wouldn't let him do anything with the weird Mustang prototype
I love how unscripted and uncomfortable Timo is with this whole thing
E-tron sounds Nuts!!
Ken, when you get those car to drive from the museum, do they put new tires for you to drive it that hard or this are the same tires for years inside the museum?
I love that Audi isn't scared to give historic racecars in the hands of actual maniacs. They know that cars are built to be driven.
Wait for Audi and Porsche to enter F1 !
Brake cooling turbo fans with own carry on satchels -- worth enough to have their own First Class plane seat !!
Electric sounds like slot cars. not a fan. The other tho.. Incredible!
audi must be so happy having ken (waiting for that vision audi to arrive in gran turismo )
The V8 street cars were really under-appreciated. Obviously they’re old now but what an awesome engine! They’re super smooth and sound great. Only rev to about 7 and a lot less power, but with the right exhaust they don’t sound too far off
This is a Porsche Mission R reskinned
That E-tron sounds awesome. I don't think that most Teslas sound like that.
"Eleven and a half"...........I fell over........
Getting sideways in history with Ken Block
Silence goes the new racer. Oh well.
Audi Electric Hoonicorn on the way
U need to compete in classics with an S1 : )
Dream, great dream! Parabéns
You can see the difference in Ken's eyes ..from fun driving the older AUDI and tension driving the EV monster..!!
I personally was never a fan of Audi, but after watching how they let Ken block drive their museum pieces of auto memorabilia gave me a lot of respect for Audi.
Stuck was a great driver..he made some US pilots really mad...!!!
2:43 One of my all time favorite race cars ever! The legendary A4, from Gran Turismo 4!
I'd own an Audi if they were not so unreliable and unaffordable.
Ken going around Audi driving all those legendary cars. Maybe we get the return of Audi to rallye from this. Would love to see the return of the titan to WRC. Plus we could get some sick smaller Audis again that have the same sense of style as the old S1
Car in thumbnail first shows at 8:13
Ken Number One ❤️👌
3:31  Ken really said: How far are you gonna let me go this way?  Timo: Not nearly as far as Sebastian Vettel or even Walter Rohrl
Shit German engineers say: It was STILL built on a metal chassis
Ken Block in a German Nascar.
Who care the electric toilette?! Drive real cars dude!! Or you came to the audi for electric marketing managemant?!
tnx for nice audi tour!
pure promo
driving pieces of history so lucky
Does anyone know why all these car channels seem to have switched to really bad GoPro's with like fake-1080p and 24fps? Nearly every channel I watch seems to have adopted them. Is it "cool" to have low-fps video now or something?
I thought the Hoonicorn is a high rev V8..
This is the equivalent of a whisky expert given the opportunity to taste extremely rare and expensive whisky.
I am interested in how Audis share prices have been affected with Ken Block getting involved.  It has to have gone up...
Audi 👍🏻
Nice to see kenn likes an Red Bull sponsored dtm car 😂
Watching him carry the power over through that turn at 6:19 was just incredible. There is an amazing mini documentary about Audi called "secrets of speed: the unfair advantage" it's an older video but man I get shivers Everytime I watch that little film. Groundbreaking vehicles, and amazing driver's behind the wheel of these cars.
E- tron sounds gay
Who is Ken Block?
lady and gentleman. Ken without sunglases..  5:38 Didnt know he could take them off
Pitty you couldn't drive the IMS car ,they had two running in RSA in the  80's early 90's and they insane.
Lucky Bastard  lol  <3
When watching electric cars it's like there's something missing. I just can't put my finger on it....
I remember when Audi came to America and smoked the US teams. They complained that Audi had an unfair advantage so SCCA made Audi put so much extra weight on the car it wasn’t competitive so Audi quit the series. I really can’t blame them,they invested millions in the cars and teams only to be punished for building their cars to the limit of the rules.
Audi that's awesome that you let someone show off your family jewels.
Sick...
_oof_  That 1993 Audi 80 quattro DTM prototype is sooooo nice.  🤩
Omg that old Audi with V8 looks badass on race track
Maybe Ken can talk audi into bringing the s1 and maybe even a rs1 to the states 🤔🤔🤔 I know hard to but would be sweet
Ken looks sooooooo high
soo sick to watch one of the sickest drivers of our time driving for the best car brand ever.
Horrible screaming and whining, who wants to hear that kind of sound? Not me at least. Sorry The only electrical thing that works is the electric chair.
Great video. Thank you sharing your experience and the museum was stunning 😍 this should be titled AUDI PORN XXX 😂
@5:40 First time I've seen Ken without a cap....
I bet Ken will be driving F1 for Audi as the Volkswagen Group is joining next season /s
The gran turismo e-tron is just so damn beautiful
10:14 how the door opens 💀
I mean why can’t he drive them all? Not like he’s going to crash it on an open space
Imma sell my Ford and get an Audi now
I Love Audi V8🥰🥰🥰🥰
I need a shirt that says lucky bast#@d
The sound of the v8 my god
lucky bastard is the anime term for the little guy who always lucks in to nude shots of the female character's. but it's always the female character's walking in on him hence the lucky bastard . being old school well I'm just old I will miss gas engines in motor sports just for the sound. while the electric cars are fast and cool there not a screaming V8 trying to keep it's pistons in the cylinders at 8 grand or the crackling 4 cylinder Cosworth rally engines of the 80's god I'm going to miss the sounds
Love the PlayStation 2 vinyls lol
This partnership is going to be great for Audi and us as car enthusiasts lol
You can actually drive the e tron in gran turismo,although it's seems more controlable ther than irl
Ken you and Chris Harris have the best jobs in the world, I’m a Ford Guy, so I loved it when you were with Ford, especially the Fiesta Rally Car as I have a 14 Fiesta ST stage 2 Cobb tune, sticky Michelin Pilot Sport tires, I’m 73 years young and love driving on 3 wheels. Can’t wait to see the collaboration with Audi. The Fiesta Flash 🤙🏼🍺🍺🍺
I thought Ken didn’t have hair, Ken has really nice hair..
“It was fun though very cool experience” man looks like he just killed an 8ball😂
03:04 Look at that B6 DTM. Such a sight to behold damn.
Seeing Ken with his hat off, had no idea he had such nice hair.
Selling out to electric! Sad
Ken block is one hell of driver.
The E-Tron looks cool, but that sound, just can't get used to it. RC car on steroids?  The DTM, now that sound was killer! 6:30
Audis are the most boring cars, I just can't...
#freedomfactory come Ken joint the next lamullet
Literally sounds like a jet about to take off
That 1990 V8 sound was amazing .  I wish I could have experienced that series.  It sounds like nothing else today.
That Video made me Smile 😃 11000 +rpm V8
Basically nascar
I came here for Ken's drive of the 1990 V8 DTM racer, and it didn't disappoint. At all. 11,000rpm from a V8 Quattro is an insane set of specs. I shouldn't be surprised that it makes V8 aural pornography.
''These go to 11''😁
Ken is a s c u m bag 😂😂 what a cool experience taking that out of the Audi vault
That was a awesome video
Please build your own custom audi!
Etron in french = shit 😂
Lord almighty the sound is beautiful
They probably are nervously enjoying watching the cars race like they used to.
Ken can you drift.No but atleast it can spin.
Ken. You are my world and if it wasn't for you I wouldn't have ever liked Rally, or drifting as much as I do. Thanks for letting me watch you, It's an amazing thing to see you have as much fun as you are.
“E-Tron”??? -5……. Audi Sport Quattro??? 💯%
Electric cars are stupid. Harvesting and getting rid of/landfilling lithium ion batteries is 100% worse than any gas engine. Such a stupid industry pretending to be helping the environment while profiting from the ignorance of the public. Not to mention, the "sound" makes my PP soft.
I feel exactly like that driving to work each day in my crappy Equinox... only much slower...
Ken without his hat on 😳😳😳
Thank you Audi. Thank you Ken and the team for making yet another great YT content..
The DTM car sounds like an Australian Ford Mustang V8 Supercar.
Vision GT looks and sounds like a Brushless RC Car 🤣
5:40 holy shit, I totally forgot Ken actually has a normal head. I mean I always thought the hat as part of his body u know
You can see the difference on your face Ken, it was smiles all round when driving the DTM and that sound, fantastic. But that electric e-tron, you just looked so bored and that sound, bloody horrible, no not for me.
My girlfriend laughs at the smile on my face watching these, im like a little kid.
not everyday you see Ken without his hat
The Last car reminds me gran turismo sport game, Great video gg!!!!
釜江太郎50歳からラブラブ寂しい50歳から楽しいイベント見して
Surely they are gonna give you new driving overalls with audi on them
Ken "i will do a quick drift around the" Block
Es ist so ein tolles Video bis das Elektroding kam. Was für ein miserabler Klang 😭
Subscribed purely because of the Spinal Tap edit 👌🏻✌🏻
So happy Ken is team Audi!!😊
Hey AUDI, you’re starting to look pretty rad here. Keep letting block drive cars please.
Wish Tesla would build something for pro-series racing!  Probably a money hole though
5:53 that car is very cool!
4:03 puppy eyes :)
There should be something similar to an amusement park where attendees pay for a ticket to take a test lap in a Tradition car. This applies to Mercedes, Jaguar, Alfa Romeo, Toyota, and other manufacturers with an extensive racing history.
up to 11
"alright so i kinda need one of these" iconic
Thanks Audi!
Someone wouldn't happen to know where I could acquire one of those dtm v8s so I could swap it into my b8 s5!
Anyone else from germany here and spotted DrCrazy on 5:53? if he has something to do with it, im calling jp-performance in for the next hoonicorn!
Audi taking advantage of Ken for publicity I's what I like to see screw ford
E-TRON Vision GT - Sound of Future. very nice
the lack of enthusiasm from the guy with the camera when presenting the etron
I loved the way ken spun out and the look on his face of how did i spin out lol he looked like he hasn't lost a car in years lol
Thatsssss a wraaaaaappppp!
K. B 💣💣💣🦾🦾🦾👍👍💪💪🤝
Wow.... Audi has developed a high spec all electric Prototype GT Car that Ken Block steers with the use of a pair of Dildos. Take a look at the end of the vid again. Man.... if they aren't reconstituted sex toys made into a steering wheel, I don't know what is?????
terrible nonsense that square steering wheel
I'm RAPT  Thx Boys!!!! 'THAT'S A WRAP'
Ken in Nürburgring ??? no ??
Audi complained and you had to change the title and thumbnail, eh? It's okay we all know the DTM car is way cooler ;)
The fact that real life cars are getting developed and built just so they can be in video games is kind of wrinkling my brain a little.
Good job on the video
First time I EVER seen ken with his hat off! Damn brother it’s like a saw a unicorn!
.I love cars too (I have a 2017 Corvette C7 with the fun manual transmission) but it ain't free and stocks are one way to make money. .....,,AMAZON:  Yep, I bought a ton on the dip.   It's getting cheaper relative to its current earnings (half compared to last year).  ...With the Delta virus coming at full speed ahead, pandemic sales will make a comeback.  Amazon's not going anywhere so I know that eventually it will come back.     Fidelity considers Amazon as a large growth company (probably because as big as it is, it still only has 7% of the retail market)  buying via Amazon Smile donations donates some money to my favorite charity too!  Get on board or be runover, it's up to you.
Вместо руля два вибратора🤣🤣🤣
5:52 Good 2 See Dr.Crazy 😁
this series has been epic. props to Audi
If it doesn’t go because of too much speed, it doesn’t go..... 🤣 trimmed a few shrubs to that theory.
what a pathetic age motorsport has got to with cars now sounding like my vacuum cleaner. sigh
Electric car...Stupid
ok so are u selling ya FORDS
DTM is awesome. Timo is even more awesome for letting Ken wind these museum pieces out on the track.
Everything was awesome except for the electric car.
wow that sounds amazing
It's missing scale 1:1 body clips 😆. Scale rc cars these days lmao.
Another amazing video👌
why does it seem just.... different..... not my cup of tea liked him better with Ford so far
That electric thing is gangsta
These Hoonigan guys are so passionate and loving of automobiles and their history, it shines through in how much fun they have with each other doing this kind of insane stuff. Super entertaining 👏
Ahahaha  Dildo stearing wheel.
Loved it. Especially the Vison GT... the future is actually here!
Your driving reminds me of how Sarel van der Merwe used to drive the Quattros back in the 1980's.
After seeing the Mustang Mach-E and how it performs, I too would jump ship and drift for another company.
I admit I barely know squat about cars, but the thought that goes in to designing various race cars gets me every time. It's hard to understand how manufacturers like Audi can design functional cars that can race and look cool while they do it.
5:50 was the first time i've seen him without a hat, that wss so strange
Ken I think went through every vernacular trying not to say electric cars handle like shit.
Didn’t sound like 11k rpm hmmm
He’s a great driver, but also a bit of a knob.   It’s the silly hat - inbred look
5:38 ken ma guy when did u get so handsome lookin like Speed Racers older brother 😘
Pikes Peak 2022!? What are ya going to run??
Audi knows how to keep the people entertained!!
For all them thumbs down great, congrats ken, hope to see you bring audi alot of trophys and dreams come true, now you got the whole world ordering cars that electric one just like a rc car.....bigger version.....what a feeling hope you and the mad scientist come up with something real dope....dibbs on a race jacket or hoodi audi porn...dude your gonna get all the audi guys in the whole world
He looks ready for his new Audi. That’s so dope.
If Ken wants to go faster he must loose that belly
All of these cars that have sat in this museum for the last decade or more, are finally like WERE FREEEEEE. Gosh its fun to see these old cars live again and just scream.
I just want to see a b5 rally s4 lmao
hope they let ken drive one of their lmp cars, rlly curious what he'd think of the more recent r18s
Can I just say this is the most professional I seen his hair
Sad no IMSA GTO :(
Kenny killed it but man would it be wicked to see some actual racecar drivers in the same seat.
I hope im the only one that didn't like the electric car part..
Living vicariously through Ken Block...
And this was a prototype?! Was expecting more after seeing the new model s plaid. Just sayin.
audi: hires professional driver  also audi: what if he breaks the cars that were driven hard for years D:
The E-tron prototype is ok but is electric which kinda sucks especially if you used to driving a paddle shift car, I don’t particularly like the way this car handles must be the 4WD
Ken is very polite about the total boredom of electric cars. I guess he has to tow the corporate sponsorship line like everyone else.
H.J. Stuck!!!!!!  Edit: My mouth was hanging open this entire video... That garage was literally full of priceless heirlooms.
bEV baby, ...you wanna WIN dontcha?
Are we gonna see you in an Audi rally car next season?
You know watching these professional drivers with YEARS of experience, I have to hear 1 of them say (at least on camera) "do you know who I am and what I do as a career"? Your no pre madonna.
The electric, sounds like a jet. You know Ken was in heaven. Till he spun, bet that seat has a new pucker pleat in the leather. Without a stitch...
I didn't know Audi actually made audi vgt in real life.  That is just amazing.
fookin lucky bastad..
The price of old a4,s4 & a6 just skyrocketed.
Ken: Very cool experience. Thank you Audi 😎
Sounds like a 747 jet
That engine sounds AMAZING! I’m getting an AUDI now that Ken is a rep
I see Spinal Tap and go up to eleven
That engine has got that HIGH Dollar engine hummmmmmmm! V-8 very distinctive!! that is a relatively new sound. They didn't sound like that 10 years ago!!
I foresee a audi v8 awd hoonicornish car coming
👍🏾
They actually build the gran turismo vision car ? Holy moly
This Ken + Audi thing is the bomb.
I know electric is fast but I'm certain any hot blooded male would prefer a noisy beast with a manual shift 💪
8:30 Here to support the electric Audi
I just can't wait to see his first Audi build.
Wow sexy ! I love what Audi is letting Ken do ! Soooo cool !
I can't even process how fast these EV race cars are going to be when battery weight starts coming down.
Sounds like a case for fake calibrated engine noise inside the car, another dimension for driving. LOL😂
Im still hoping he gonna drive the IMSA GTO
You mean a turbocharged, AWD car starting winning against RWD, naturally aspirated cars in Trans-Am? What a surprise! And then Audi complained about the weight penalty.
The trans am car was so sick.
For me it feels like the 90's cars where kind of underrated in the 90's. With todays computerized cars, the old cars feels like pure joy, you feel evertything, and you are in charge of the whole machinery. I'm not feeling that in modern cars, so I have kind of no interest about them... Sad...
Ken definitely has the BEST JOB EVER!!!
sucking it up Ken
And to think they went from this to electric 🤢🤢
Insane Ken
I like the Spinal Tap clips!
Really liked the V8 DTM, race cars from that Era are gorgeous in my opinion mostly stock body lowered or slammed on some really fat slicks. No over the top areo. However Group C cars from that Era are a different story 🤗🤗.
Now that was different 💪🏻🏆👌🏻
I LOVE WHEN RICH WHITE PEOPLE TELL PEOPLE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOL
boooooooooooooooooooooriiiiiiiiing
Awesome videos Ken, you got to drive some freaking fantastic cars, the ones us mere mortals can only dream of, or watch you driving the sh1t out of, lol 😝, that PR Guy’s sphincter must have puckering quite a bit when you were throwing those priceless cars around like confetti 🎉 hahaha 🤪.       😎👍👍👍🇬🇧
Starts off with a car with soul, character, heritage and amazing sounds only to be followed by a car that is boring, souless, silent but very fast.  The future is going to suck once we go full ev since we will lose out on the homegrown solutions for diy racing.  It will be - lets throw in this crashed tesla motor and bats into this car and that car.
That v8 sounds sooooo good
What happened with ford
Ha ha. The milk floats remind me when i was a kid on the milk round.
As a huge audi fan, i have no idea why they didn't have Ken drifting in the RS e-tron GT... wouldve been such a good marketing moment for US customers. Very disappointed  with how far they let Ken take this series. He did drive some of the greatest cars in rally history but I mean its Ken Block, let him drift them. I get it, its history, but so is Ken drifting in that same history. Sad it went this way but glad it happened!
The perks of being famous,,,,YOU SUCK !!!!
... не чё себе Ауди, визуально скорость набирает абалдеть можна! А звук как у самолёта.
Seeing that joy on Ken's face is priceless...
Electric cars are cringe.
At 5:43 I literally muttered to myself "Block you're a jammy bastard".
I love the giddy/excited laugh as he's buckling up!  So dope!  Great partnership, Audi representing!  Love the relationships Ken keeps in his circle  😁
#luckybastard
As a kid I use to go down to the Bowling Alley at Rose Bay and play with the Slot Car Track, now before I die I will be able to do the similar thing on the road, in a electric car.
Мне нравится этот дяденька! Он круто гоняет! ))
Is Ken basically Kimi on truth serum?
Audi found a way to revive their racing heritage while simultaneously finding a way to promote their future endeavors. Future looks Hoon-worthy
I love this my only question is why is there paddles on the electric car steering wheel
i bet the whole time timo is just like "please don't ruin this and get me fired" lol
What a contrast of cars. Love it cool classic to awesome electric 💥❤⚡
Let get an audi version the hoonicorn !
Cars meticulously designed to go fast given to someone that is specially keen to go sideways 😂 the best thing about this partnership is getting to see the cars
Did you guys notice the name on that DTM, Hans-Joachim Stuck, one of the greatest drivers of all times, Ken you are privilege to drive such a machine with that legacy, Ken WHY don't you try and talk to the racing team and run at ALMS, 24 hours of Le mans, Rolex at Daytona, Sebring, Spa, nurburgring, and many more, that's one chance in a lifetime, good luck
could we please get cars like the Audi V8 back and scrap all this Electic-Car Bullshittery for good?!!!!
Damn!
Electric cars is the worst thing that could have happened to us car enthusiasts.... I am not looking forward to next 15-20 years... That dtm v8 audi revving to 11.5k rpm is just insane!!!!! Love it!!! Makes "high revving" hondas not so high revving lol
It's reaaaaaaallll???? Whhhhaaaaaaattt
Sounds like a jet!!😁
It's easy to see why Ken is so successful, not only as an amazing wheelman, but also as a spokesperson to represent a brand. He comes off as genuine, likeable and enthusiastic.
5:39 Is that the first time I ever seen ken without a hat or helmet
Lucky bastard indeed! Literally driving iconic legendary museum cars?! And going full send on them! Woohoo! Jealous!
that's the best audi could find to partner with?
11🎯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
C'mon Ken drive the diesel Le Mans cars, roll some coal.
Can't see a world where electric sports cars will excite me...
Sorry, the DTM car is 100x cooler than the Vision E-tron…. Despite being way slower 😂
That electric thing at the end is soulless.
Electric sounds so boring compared to a v8 😂
4:58 Mercedes Benz 🤭
Don't stop NA V10 production Audi pleeeeease!!! 😢😢😢
im so jealous
OHHHH, and that was STUCK'S DTM car....by the way !
car is extremely sexy ... but still e cars are complete bullshit ..
its an Audi A100 chasis?
Thankyou Audi and thankyou Ken! That noise was epic ❤
This is justa Formula E car inside
♻️🔋👏💪🔝❤️
The look in Ken's eyes when he drove the Etron vision GT shows how much of a handlful that car is.  He had a look of concern that I've never seen before and he was just driving fast on a track, not even sliding sideways.  He looked like a person handling a deadly venomous snake who recognizes this will take his full concentration to not become a disaster.
It never won a race
Kens serious face in the E car...
5:38 Ken without his hat. Don't thank me.
A high revving is 20, 000rpm - 22,000rpm. The wheel covers that were outlawed by the FIA in F1 will be back on F1 in 2022. I guess they are still relevant.
Ken Blok N' 1.
Sieh an sieh an …de Saarlänner 😉
E-Shit......................................Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnn !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn not looking forward to E-tron and crap, thers no soul at all
Crazy to see Ken in a candy store 🤣 awesome though! Some epic, nostalgic cars that lay in history he was able to drive! Ken can drive any of my cars if he wants lol….. won’t be that exciting lol!
Wenn ihr die deutsche Technik so liebt, dann helft den Deutschen, denn sie begehen gerade Selbstmord 🤕
Professional race driver, cant even adjust or use a race harness correct way🤷‍♂️
Lol at Timo telling him he can ride in the trunk since he won't be driving the DTM.
Nice.. Had my engine taken to the shop that restored those V8s.
So cool, getting behind the wheel of a car a legend like Hans Stuck drove.
jesus christ that sounds better than I remember... it sounds BIG for a high RPM V8 too.
No entiendo por qué Audi ha fichado al viejo éste que es un paquete que solo sabe derrapar en unos vídeos que repite las tomas una y otra vez hasta que le salga bien .
I hope we get Hoonigan pattern but with the Audi Team colors.  Oh, and maybe a Hoonigan Coupe S2?
I had an old V8 quattro. The car ran like shit but the interior was real nice, it was unique and felt solid.
that thing sounds fucking BEAUTIFUL
Guys...  As an Audi fanboy who's never really watched a ton of Ken Block videos (because really, who fucking cares about another modified Subaru?), I can't tell you how awesome it is to see this dude thrashing these classics.  Fantastic job balancing the shredding with the straight up Audi porn.  This is the best series of youtube videos to cross my feed in years.  Thank you so much...
how sad and horrible it is to hear about an electric car when you love cars. this world is fucked!!!
Audi styling is so magnificent, through and through.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the bulgaria just hold the world record audi a80 quattro 7 sec 400m
DEAR AUDI, LET THEM KEEP THE VIDEOS COMING. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE DREAM FOR ALL OF US.
One of the best promotional brand videos!  Thanks AUDI !!!!!!!
If U like that, you'll LOVE this:  https://youtu.be/mKVikEdbrrM
Great vid. Really enjoyed it. Nice to see some more Audi stuffs
Turned off at 9 minutes lol
Unbelievable
So gonna make a audi hoonhR8
Love that regardless of how huge Ken is getting he remains just as grounded as he's always been and is always so humbled by the experiences he's offered 🙏
“We could try though right “? Lol
Hes Sounding like E92 M3
back into the future
cant even wait to see what they build for ken
5:38 Ken's hair on point 👍👍
6:05 Closed captions describes what it hears as ”music.” It sure is buddy, it sure is. Music to the ears
Lucky bastard, made me laugh......  true
This era of Audi is just absolutely magnificent
Ngl. It's look like a Honda 🤭
Now this is car porn. Audi made everyone around the world happy with this one.
DONALD TRUMP STUNT VOICE WTF BRO!
Lucky bastard indeed.
So, what you are saying is Audi made the perfect sedan but didn't release it to the public 🤔
Sweet, but all the stickers make them look so tacky
Good job he drive cuz he sound thick as shit
Love Ya Ken. Keep it up fella. 😜🇮🇪👍
5:52 Dr crazy
@7:00 Doin what they were made to do. 😜👍😜
2x takumis engine
WHYYYYYYYY..... We need the IMSA GTO!
I'm from europe but i can imagine how much marketing value Audi gains in the USA market just for inviting hoonigan & ken block to check the audi racing legends and testing them on camera. In this deal every1 wins, right? Viewers, hoonigan, Ken and Audi themselfs. Great to watch 👍🏻😎
that look when it started ...
Yep, lucky b*stard🤣
Audi  das habt ihr doch nicht nötig nehmt einen der den Autos gerecht wird
Guy on the first day its ok u can drive after seen what ken did ahhhh nope not this one take thr last expansive one 🤣🤣🤣
its so cool to see the audi's like that love it
Bro listening to that thing is an absolute Symphony
Well done Audi, the GOAT, the most famous of all now in your team, Mr Ken Block
1 more car ken the R18 😍🤤
Ken One step forward  Ten steps back Audi is rubbish
Ken is soooooooo lucky to be able to even be in that room of soooo much history and having the privilege of being able to drive some of the cars and on top of all this it is good publicity because in order to see into the future of a car company you must remember the past and it's journey. 5⭐ AUDI tbh it's actually making wish to get a audi myself. Also another thing too, doing these videos and promo is actually good for building trust between ken and audi and maybe making a life long lasting partnership as well as friendship. Amazing Video Thank you Ken and Thank you AUDI 👍😁
Never seen such a serious face on Ken. Hahaha
I like how that whole audi v8 was stripped but they kept the wooden interior detail on the center console.
It doesn't sound like 11,500 RPM...
The V8 DTM, incredible car! Would have loved it if he got to drive the Imsa :)
Audi was not part of the DTM in the craziest years, where technology just shot through the roof. Mercedes-Benz, Alfa Romeo, Opel, (even a private Ford Mustang 5.0), with an extreme amount of tech, like weights transferred from side to side, etc etc. Big success facator was limited aero (aero has destroyed saloon car and GT racing for the fans.)
6:01 ear orgasm
Plot twist - Ken is going to retire after they let him drive all the museum cars before he races 1 race
Oh damn, nothing against electric cars but I wouldn't even look at the e-tron if I was offered to choose one of those for a drive. 6:24 says it all.
Going from the 11500rpm v8 to the electric must have been a downer
shaved ken look weird
audi.please let ken drive the tractor
whoa have to put some noise in with the electrics.
4:50 F1 cars rev to 15k rpm Ken...
I have a feeling a few of the broken cars will be fixed
Timo must be absolutely shitting it!!!! Lol
You can't replace rev's - or you end up with a canalboat engine!
Shoutout to Audi. It's a pleasure and a blessing to own one for myself. Super excited for the build!
give some love to the audi diesel lemans please
That wooden trim on the dashboard.... :D
So when hes talking 'it just goes' with the e-tron I just got it. Been driving lemons cars and normally we don't have the power but an engine swap and it all just makes sense...
to see cars like this moving.. not just sitting.... the world thanks you.
The trans am cars are my favorite audis
Any one noticed mercedes in audi heaven
It's hilarious to see scotto turning into nads. You can relax today timo scottos got this
its a shame what has become of audi these days
Lucky Bastard - just awesome!
Lucky guy, pure smile.
Lawa saga 🤣🤣
Once its  a wrap, head for the german bierssss !!!
Thank you Audi, like a trip down memory lane 😊. Always been a fan!
Surprised he hasn't driven a R8 gt3 yet
https://youtu.be/lKXxtOTIF9s
Audi's greatest move
car sound is similar to gta vice city car sound 😂😂
First time I think I have ever seen KB with no hat/helmet, or sunglasses on at the same time. What a shock.
that's a frickin f1 under a family car body. insane
I think kens eyes get crazier with every video.... Bring it on!
For Those You Don't know Scotto Setup this deal not ken block so he can go to AUDI'S heritage cars.   So The AUDI deal for ken is actually for scotto
The DTM R8 has been a background on my computer since it came out. So beautiful.
scumbaging at its finest
Scotto ask what color your Audi is???
Kinda freaks me out how much Ken, without his hat, looks like my older brother. Same age...freaky.
Great car. I personally have a 1991 Audi V8 and a 2.2T URS4 ... Two exceptional cars!
Timo is such a legend !
Kens new car is gunna be awesome
Wow. Nice sound from the london underground. 😂😂😂
I still think the V8 Ford twin turbo Awd, sounded and was more vicious who agrees?
Ken Block und Audi passen meiner Meinung nach nicht zusammen. Nur Stuck und Röhrl dürften meiner Meinung nach die Autos so fahren.
I have an Audi 5 cylinder turbo that I’m willing to sell to you ken block
Rather peculiar choice of steering wheel colour on the electric car
DTM? DEATH TRAP MACHINE? WHAT A NICE CAR
I can’t wait to see his new rally car🤘🤘🤘
I remember when these audi showed up in the gto series at road america my favorite audis that dominated
Scotto in the trunk.. lmfao. Killed me
ALL OLD AUDI's Just went QUATTRO in Price!
The sound
Jealous, and, proud to have been following you for a long time!
Its nice to see how audi have balls compare to ford back when ken drive for the first time the mach e ken wasent autorised to drift compare to audi that let ken drift super rare model and old rare model
👍
This is an amazing series.
why is ken not in a fire suit while driving the ev!!!
audi E quattro
It breaks my heart to think someday we might not have gas engines
That E-Tron vision GT had similar look and sound with Jackson Storm from Cars 3, you know...that 3rd Gen race car nemesis of Lightning McQueen 😁
Love the 'Crocodile' painted R8 Le Mans car in the background.  That thing won the race in Adelaide, Australia in the year 2000.
A bit over use of "a dream come true" :p
Saw these cars in the Miami Grand Prix back in the day as a kid....and remember Walther Rohrl with the little dude in the back pulling down his pants and mooning everyone behind him!!!! LMFAO....good ol days!!
I'm upset that I thought I had subscribed to Ken Block's channel and I never did....now I gotta binge this stuff!!!
Woah (5:38), I never seen Ken without a hat or helmet till now.
Just remember Ford wouldn’t let him do anything with that Mach-E he had access too. Audi lets him rip irreplaceable cars. Like a real Motorsports company 🤣 I guess Ford never changed from being squares
DownToMove
I use the "Goes to 11" reference for everything.
6:22 - Sounded like you had unlimited RPM’s avail.  Wow - How this machine screams.
DAAAAAAM ! I WANT A DTM!!!!!!
Le man racer next please
That car sounds absolutely amazing 🤯
That V8 wow
"Lucky bastard" *indeed*
Ken and Audi is the most beautiful combo I could imagine
Audi V8s sound the best
I mean Ford’s great buuuuuuuuut
11,500rpm!!!! Thats insane!!!!!!!!!
German Technology rules. Pity you brainwashed fools joined Communism to wipe out humanities shining glory. Now your living in perpetual DEBT. CAN YOU LOOK YOUR CHILDREN IN THE EYE AND EXPLAIN THIS?????????
Holy. I have never been a huge fan of Audi but to say this is amazing as hell would just be a lie. All of these amazing cars from Audi History.   I need one of those engines!
That car noise - do that more. That was it exactly
Ken, if you want to drive as fast as the name of the man on the car, don't go so much sideways ...
Amazing engine sound!
Aw shame we didn’t get to see Ken hoon a Audi R8 lmp.
I realised when he fired up the 1990 v8 dtm that I had never seen Ken without a helmet or a cap on. Why is that glorious coupe always hiding under a cap????
This is heaven. I wish I could see places like this lol.
11,500 v8: exists Honda: *hold my vtec.*
No ICE no Racing Suit Req?
I still remember the Alfa's shredding them
If you're into F1 revving engines, there is, out there somewhere, a Renault Espace that they converted to run an F1 engine and tyres back in the 90s.  That would be fun...you'd need a pretty flat track though as the suspension was killer!
F1 cars used to rev, like, beyond 20,000 though!?  I think they're still, even with the limitations, up to 15,000? 🤔
9:56 ah ok... Is really ken
I see this garage few year ago...
https://youtube.com/channel/UCLnmFwda-mN3t1rc29PRghQ
🕺📸https://youtu.be/7FYLSCqO9dw📸🕺
I'm making a replica B5 Quattro rally car. Is there anywhere i can get pictures of the car ? PLEASE!
I wonder if HJ Stuck is happy about this
They r being so awesome to Ken and the crew!! Love it!
Great audi and driver legend
The sound of that V8, my God thats soo good! 11k RPM V8 >>> racing electric hoover  No sound no party
Miss my Coupe GT I had back in the early 90's bought for the same reason Ken got into rally racing.
Rouven!!
All the sudden I want an Audi
it can be better with e-tron vision gt about time laps
High revving V8 then an electric whine. I don't care how fast the Vision GT is, that V8 makes the hairs on the back or your neck stand up and the GT just goes fast.
You lucky dog.
Awesome👍! But please go to combustion engine on hydrogen and not electric it's no fun there is no sound....
A little bit of Kimi with more laughing and more words.... audi the best and hopefully soon formula1 maybe
Ken's face when that DTM started up properly...glorious.
I want to see Ken drive one of those LMPs behind them.
Tesla Plaid.  Boom
what a Dream or Fantasy come true !!!  the next 15 years is milestone gap between Electric taking over and phasing out passenger large displacement gas engine technology  =(...
why use cars then, just sneakers.
Good GOD what a noise!!! 👏👍👍👍
Audi Show races These cars ob Several Events. Wich is realy cool. You can Talk with the drivers and See this Special Cars in Action. I Wonder why Ken did Not Drive the Imsa Cars. Please Audi let him Drive  the Imsa Cars. A newer DTM Car and a 24h le man Car !
Wtf does DTM mean ?
The most outrageous thing..... ken not wearing a hat....... looks like he works in i.t or something
Lucky bastard
So Xbox designers for a forza Horizon  5 this is the cars we want to hav ago with Ken can u please go make a video of  a zac speed Capri Turbo
he sounds like he does a lot of coke
cant believe we skipped the B5 so quickly
Would be the time for one drift king driving Audis to honor the one and only Audi drift king - Christof Klausner
Ken Block is a genuine nice guy, and he drives like hell too.
9:23 wow that looks so boring no changing gears no sound you just driving something
That is one fast colorful winged sewing machine.
and here we can see again that ken was not briefed on these cars (or the current state of dtm).
I love it when YouTube subtitles say "music" when the engine revs
Man, that Vision GT is an absolute beast!
My two favorite things in the world. Hoonigan And Audi 🔥 ❤️
Love to see LeMans TDI
Badass!  The E-TRON sounds like a spaceship.
Upping the price on the ur ;)
Hahaha.  So…….   (Que every car enthusiast laugh)
Is the Ford relationship over for KB to move on with VAG?
Geeked right now this is nuts
How is this working out? Ken is going everywhere sideways, and Audi is strongly against drifting.
Ken.... so do you get to drive for Audi at Le Mans 24 hr should they enter a team ???.
Wow lucky B** for sure
Real love 💕😗... https://youtu.be/vZ-Dg0_oVR0 Next level Story ... ♥
Old audi, the golden age of automotive.
I think what ken was trying to say about the e-tron is "I don't know what the fuck downforce is and why is it so fast pls help"
These Audi's go to 11🤘
Did anyone else see the building at 6:14 and again at 6:32, with a quick glance and think I hope he sends it like GTA?
The Vision sounds like a fighter jet. Burbling V8 enthusiasts will disagree, but I don't mind that.
Who else can't wait to see Ken hoon/drift an Auto Union Type C/D ?
"You're a rally driver" .. funniest thing I've heard in years :D
the only DTM legend is the BMW boxshape. E30 for the googlers. not just that, it is the legend in every motorsport event it took part in, winning nearly every event it took part in and having more wins then any other car in history. now thats a legend.
👊🏻😎👍🏻
HoonEtron
I been waiting for this one
11ish means use all 11500rpm
Ken needs to build a mental s1/s2
Lap times vs. who???
why not the IMSA GTO?
Cool.
This was very good.  Must say, the sound of an electric saddens me.
Can't wait to see why Audi is cooking for him
Dr. Crazy bei 5:55 ???? hahaha
i have to ask..carbon fibre bucket seats..almost rock stiff suspension,high rev v8 pulling 0-100 in under 3secs...maan..on a scale of 1-10 how cormfortable are these beasts 🤷‍♂️👀😂
10:18 He had the hat under the helmet LOL
This series was so cool! I can't imagine how Ken felt, cause I feel blessed just to watch him rip these legendary vehicles around the track! 😍😂
Man more more more love these kinds of videos
Ken should drive the valkyrie
Audi should sponsor ken as a rally driver on their team
Why im looking on Ken*s face, not car? Bad operators*s decision.
It would be so funny to see Mr BLOCK in a European Rally. Who's Block??
That first car is a MF monster, 11k RPM!!! whattt   I had the 5.1 cranked up, sounds amazing  \m/   \m/
it almost looks like, Audi is testing Ken, too may make him an offer, to become Test-driver...!? lol
Once again build areplica and rip it in a gymkhana style vid the v8 obviously
Visit JP Performance in Dortmund;)
The guy living my dream is living his dream. When the split from Ford happened I was sad. But hoped this was where he was going. THANK YOU Hoonigan Kings
Legend driving a legend formerly driven by a legend...
That sound was delicious!
Holy crap…. I just witnessed something only few people ever have….   Ken Block w no hat on 🤯
Thank you, Audi. Thank you, Ken. Seeing this cars drive again instead of in historical footage brings a smile and damn near a tear to my eye. These cars are some of my favorite. Love where this partnership is going.
11k RPM, a dash of oppo… 🧑‍🍳 💋🤌  Also, TIL: Ken has hair!
electric is so shit
next series on hoonigan will be a home built DTM car
4rings…. FTW🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Audi once again showing how they're so much better than Ford
Timo was a little too quick with those NOPES!  Does he know who Ken Block is? Do I see a change in modalities?  Maybe a little Touring Car racing?
Love this parthership  and the vidéos
I jst wet myself
Ken Block is entertaining but I could care less about Audi, especially an electric one
And.., MaRVeLoUS !!
Peg that teach!!!!!!!!!!!!
Holy crap the sound that V8 makes is UNREAL!!!
I feel like this trip is just Ken deciding which audi to build for the next gymkhana
Congrats Mr. Block !
i only ran a little over 7000 rpm  🤣
Well I skipped a new 8 series and went Audi....   First one I have owned since the "Blue Fox"  (great car for its time) Now, Ken driving all these amazing cars?  well could have been Audi seeing how he measured up to past drivers if he was running a known course huh?   The "E" car?   oh yea...
HOW COOL IS THIS THANK YOU AUDI AND KEN
The understood bed conspicuously succeed because joseph topically undress versus a panoramic teller. enthusiastic, waiting panda
Totally speechless and absolutely loving these thanks Guys could literally watch n listen allllll day 🙌🙌👊👊
Electric rubbish from 8:30ish. This rubbish is where I and many others tune out and glaze over
God damn we're gonna miss sounds like these in the future.
5:38 Couldnt recognize Ken for a moment
need more of ken driving rare audis
And now, Audi is killing its sports legacy....
I think he will never drive this cars again..
That noise ! Incredible
Wow, how gay is the modern EV “race car”?! Give me the 30 year old 11,500 rpm V8 any day over that BORING electrical appliance car.
Scotto tries to hard to be funny.
The perfect opportunity to drive the electric thing into a big trash can and you missed it!
Welcome to Bavaria 🤟😉😜
mantion a gymkhana audi and drift the hell out of the nürburgring!

V8 at 10k plus... Nice!
Audi is going to enter F1, this is an excellent marketing move to get Ken and Hoonigan in and around their racing prestige and heritage. Also appealing to one of the largest car markets and sporting markets in the world, the USA. F1's focus market for the next 5 years. It is also awsome to what these cars and Ken 🤘
https://youtu.be/k7IdD34NVpg.  🥶Coldest Producer in the game
Audi is preparing  Ken for pikes peak...to break the existing record...
Hope he gets to try out one of the LMP1 cars 😬
The wood in the cockpit ;)
He is a lucky bastard. LOL. Good for you Ken Block. Proof that hard work pays off.
no visit to   nordschleife ?
Ken's really just out here playing Forza IRL
Those "Spinal tap" edits are perfect 👌😂
Omg the sounds <3!!!
That Audi represents the definitive golden era of DTM, arguably  even touring car racing as a whole. Arguments could be made for that super touring A4 and the various series’s it was entered in. But back in the late 80s and early 90s you had so many different cars competing, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. FWD, RWD, 4WD, engines with different displacements and 4 to 8 cylinders, revving way beyond a normal road car and sounding accordingly. I only found samples of that era on youtube, would love to see a ‚drive to survive‘ style show about each season :) Thank you for sharing these moments!
Rather have to get the new car then I’ll get you to the new car 🚗 car is in your life car and you can do that and you can have it on the phone 📱 is there to your phone? No idea 🤷‍♀️ I will be there at five or you have to do it for you
Great video up until the toaster powered battery ridden shitbox
The last few videos have been amazing, thanks Audi and Ken/Team for this collab, couldn’t ask for more!
so what happened to ford ??...anyways so much better audi has Ken Block ive been waiting for this🇵🇭🇵🇭
Audis history is so underrated compared to bmw and merc.They deserve more
Ken block dyes his hair 🤫
Just GREAT
Awesome 😎
2:13 what car si this?
If you listen really closely you can hear zack crying in the background for not being there
5:56 onwards.  Serious Goosebumps and Eargasms.  Wow.  Lucky barsteward indeed.....................;)
AUDI RULEZ!!!
Welcome to Germany 😁
5:33 - Timo being a savage!! 5:35 - Ken's hair is actually noice
its gonna be something mind blowing
Honestly, God bless Timo.  Dude is trying to let them have fun but also cares deeply for their museum.  I say *Make Timo a one of one Honourary Scumbag shirt in German*
No wins no championship points does not make you good rally driver 😉.  Wins count there is no second place . Talk the talk but your he's a showman. Europeans no how to drive in real world championships. Not a US world series.  Still great to see ken hoon. Though
かっこよすぎ
"in the trunk maybe" lol crushed dreams
When he took his hat off, my brain stopped recognising him. I've hardly ever seen him with neither helmet nor hat.
Good on ya Audi 👍🏼👍🏼🇦🇺
Audi is spoiling ken
Was für Selbstdarsteller!!
2:32 B5 DTM ohhhhh
💪👌🔥
Music to my ears
Good to see some one is making Audi fun again in these wonderfull race cars.
Which airbase is this?
Love all the way from Madagascar ;)
@5:40 Man that hair!
That V8 was insane
4:56 - trying an English accent... ELEVEN EELEVEN
Is it only me or is Ken hardly recognizable without his cap on ?
Audi taking its big, beefy flagship luxury sedan (wood trim and all) racing against competition-optimized, homologation special BMW E30s and Mercedes W201s with their boy racer aero packages and high-strung four bangers (not to mention their significant weight and agility advantages), and proceeding to beat them anyway, has to be one of the all-time motorsports flexes.
Trans Am cars make my pants feel funny
Lot respect for Audi. Ken found a much better home. I love seeing these old gems tear it up.
Ken actually looked properly scared in that E tron GT
Just realized this is the first time seeing Ken without a hat lol
Dtm for Christmas 😏👻🎄
When he spun out i know they were all stressing lol
Winningness
Just wondering if the Audi Guy say "Yes" to the IMSA GTO to be driven. Would be so wild!
He is just like me if u can make him smile a long time  u really did something u can see his excitement
You should try the most legendary and amazing DTM... Alfa Romeo 155 DTM
Dope company for sure
e-tron Vision GT...bah...
9:50 need a lazier to read the heat on the tires? know to slow down before the rubber slips?
Come on timo.... marco hats verdient....
Dude has a full head of hair! I just assumed he was bald since that vato always wears a hat.
What an experience, you've earned it, so glad Audi is treating you so so well, the beginning of an amazing partnership. edit:  OH and not to mention the fact that they let you drive museum pieces of irreplacable history just goes to show how much they trust you and want you to feel at home, so awesome.
That ETron is a bit of a weapon 😎
Next up an e legend?
https://youtu.be/m8g9wpTPZwU
Audi V8 ❤❤❤
Great now everyone going to hype up audi .. 😊
Диски золотые просто пушка, привет из России
welcome to Audi ! also i have a feeling that next time you will tell us about Le Mans ;)
Anyone else get the days of thunder feels at the beginning there?
https://youtube.com/shorts/ZMjNEJU7X1M?feature=share
Ken seems like such a nice cool guy, hello from Australia 🇦🇺
I'm not much of an Audi person but 11,500 rpm out of a what i'm guessing is a full size V8 is amazing :D
What a lucky bastard.. LoL
I sincerely hope Ken gets treated accordingly behind the scenes!!! Modern times Ive always got that feeling that in 10 years or something Ken will release like "The TRUTH behind AUDI" lmao
Damn, that Vision GT sounds like a jet plane, love it
get that imsa gt the one they banned 44 and the rules are out the window. comon let block drive it
Legendary shit
Can’t wait man
Amazing DTM car from the greatest era of the DTM!
I probably do not have to say that all of these cars have also been an incredible inspiration for me since I started driving and learning that they actually existed. As a die-hard VAG guy, all of this content has me pretty pumped.
I feel like I’ve never seen Ken Block without a hat or helmet until now
Man, if you don't like high revving engine, V8 and all wheel drive something is wrong with you.
The shear exuberant Joy as Ken can't wait to get the wheel back on and get strapped in. If he could have I'm sure he would have taken off and  put his helmet on as he drove the piss out of it on the way out! Can't recall ever seeing him so STOKED.
Such a great partnership deal, this is going to bring Audi right in front of ppls faces.
🦾
So when is Audi building Ken a rally car?
Why the poor sound quality
Hoonicorn topped with sauerkraut 🤔
this block always speaking bullshits. I rather prefere to see Hannu Mikkola in silent riding an Audi Quattro S1 E2.
Audi cooking up a gymkhana???
Makes me want another Audi...They have chosen...wisely.
These videos are the best thing in cars right now. Keep it up guys gotta love it
That etron vision did not sound that good after the Audi V8 :D
That DTM is an absolute beast.  I closed my eyes and I swore it was a NASCAR by the sound
Damnit! I need to get to work at creating a shoe empire.... then I can hopefully be able to play with some of my favorite cars some day!
Smell that? …….Audi sales cooking up
Two Legends , one car!!
The classic upturned.. bro ur trash how boring can someone be
Ken block sucks, I wish someone who could actually drive like a man would sell out Enough so I could watch them tear this car up instead of driving like a bitch
I wrote on an earlier video, lucky bastard!  LOL  That DTM sounded awesome!  The r/c car....😶
I watched Hans absolutely DESTROY the Trans Am series as a kid.  SOOOO awesome to see it again!
Adds have ruined YouTube
Back to the B5's. Lol That looks like so much fun. Dam you Ken. But thank you. Lol. Audi for life !!!
Audi and Ken Block, visceral , better buy up them Audi’s before they skyrocket
That DTM car did things to me....very powerful things....
Okay. NOW drive the concepts, like the Rosemeyer.
electric cars sound like SHIT!
We never see Ken without a hat. lmao 5:41 yall sliped up!
I want an Audi
Deff excited your driving for Audi now and I’m anxious to see what kind of car you come up with. But man no amount of electric power will ever replace the 5 cylinder turbo sympathy and feels from the exhaust vibrations etc.   really hope you can still do some fuel powered sports /driving
I WANT TO SEE KEN DRIFT IN AN S4 WAGON
They know what kind of guy they are giving the car to drive so they are cool
(Scotto dips to Audi Ingolstat) Ken: "You've been planning this all summer?" Scotto: "I've been planning this for 10 years, son!"  
DUDE you are one LUCKY SOB
Or perhaps a v8 supercar.
V8 dtm sounds like a high revving nascar.
Ken is now with a Company with such a strong, Winning race history and heritage. Audi has been my favorite factory race team in all racing since I was a kid starting with the Trans Am car and the Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO which led to me watching old vhs tapes of the Group b rally era. Just to be in the presence of the Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO is number 1 on my life bucket list. I’m so excited to see Ken who is hands down my favorite rally driver and modern race car driver, racing sick ass Audi race and rally cars. What a Pinnacle sponsorship Ken, I’m so happy and excited for you bro!!!! Hope to see and meet you sometime soon!!!!
Nice to see not all Audi’s under steer! 😄
luckiest man on the planet. hats off to you brother
Pleeeeease We need to see the IMSA GTO!!!!
Audi, this is phenomenal, please give Ken more keys. 😁
Mk4 s3 hatch Quattro
Ken is living out every Audi fan’s wet dream.
Gran turismo 3 vibes...
This is the best car brand commercial ever. Well done Audi!
Professionally worked on Audi from 2000-2007. My first Audi was 96' A4 2.8 2v and literally banged gears from red line to redline, and from red light to red light. 293,000+ miles. My current Audi is 06'A4 SLINE 2.0. Still banging gears hard with 287,000 miles to this day.   Never Follow. Audi lifer. Glad Ken is on board.
WOW!!! Dreams do come true! Frigging amazing
You guys..... are making it very difficult to hate electric. I have a handful of questions about sport/racing ev's now.
Ken just can't hide he hates electric cars.
@ken Block I’m a car lover through and through, I had a spine injury while in the service and not only did it end my career but I lost the income to have a “fun” car. I really wish I could afford something that puts a smile on my face when I drive it, but I don’t think it’s going to happen.   With that being said I have a 4mo. Old little boy and I want to give him a chance to have a career in racing, wether that’s F1, nascar or Rally. Any advice on how to start him on a path that leads to a winning circle?
That DTM. Sounds Bella
When was the last time you guys wrapped it up like that? Dam Ken keeping it going.
Wow!! That sound and those revs! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I had a ride to the false grid as a kid in the Trans AM Group 44 Audi by HJ Stuck himself
so freaking awesome
That's so cool of Audi those cars should be driven
Dude dtm cars are the best sounding racing cars ever full stop.
I love how timo seems worried every time he wants to drive something
This is an awesome partnership…
Ngl I was upset when the Ford partnership ended but now I’m super excited to see where the Audi partnership leads 🤩
You got to drive Hans Stuck's 1990 DTM car, that's something extremely cool. DTM is one of my favorite forms of motorsport.
Oh my god.......my all time favorite car driven by my all time favorite driver. Today is rad. Why is this JUST now happening?? I feel like the Ken Block/Audi/Hoonigan trifecta should have been a thing a long time ago. Hoonigan brings a more attainable/approachable feel to a high line automotive manufacturer. Which these days is extremely important. The days of mindless excess and unacceptably overpriced garbage are drawing to a close i hope. Look at Aston Martin. They built the same cars with different engines and volvo bits and pieces and charged upwards of $300k for like 15 years. Ive driven a DBS and a DBR. The new mustangs are ten times the car those are and they costed over $175k or something like that. Not to mention the fact depending on where you live its almost impossible to find a place that'll turn wrenches on them. The Astons i drove belong to one of my customers. Im the only shop within 200 miles thats willing to rack the garbage and fix the shit when it breaks. Finding parts is a whole other battle. The DBR developed a bad driveshaft vibration while the owner was driving it long distance which cracked the differential housing. It took 3 months to find the parts and when i did, they came from a totaled car in Pennsylvania. Surprisingly enough theyre not terribly difficult to work on, not as bad as a Porsche boxter, or a Lamborghini diablo anyway. Those two made me almost change my career choice. 11 hours to r&r an alternator on the boxter and almost 16 hours to do a clutch on the diablo.
Audi Casts a BLESS SPELL on KEN. KEN gets +5 KARMA CHECK
Is there a 5 Cyl in Ken's future?  😃
I just realized I don’t think I’ve ever seen ken without a hat or a helmet on till now
bro this audi is sick as
1:09 the R8 "croc" car, winner of the 2000 Race of 1,000 Years on the old school Adelaide circuit
Amazing
Кен похоже что вне брачный сын штука!)
Kid in a candy store. Always a great story. Thank you for bringing us along.
That Audi 100 quattro DTM is one of the best sounding touring cars ever. Just a bit sad they didnt let him drive the Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO. Because that is one of my favourite race cars of all times.
**READ THE DESCRIPTION** "11,5000" rpm 😂😂😂
What a rad time to be able watch legends thrash around!
I dont think Ken Block realizes his Ken Blockness yet...... God bless his humility💪😘🤜🤛😎🤜
Wow what a set up in that early DTM car.  Zero body roll and just sticks to the pavement.  They wouldn't let him drive the famous cars that they sent to America but the DTM.  He seemed way happy the way it turned out.  What a great series of videos.  Feel for the other guys that traveled with him that didn't drive anything.  Ken Block what a great guy.
👍 Yup..... KEN BLOCK IN A CANDY STORE!!!!!! #AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA💪😎🤜😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lucky bastard is an understatement for what he’s getting to do👍🏻👍🏻
DREAM JOB!!! Omg what an amazing experience.
I really love that Audi has been paying attention to these classic cars lately, paying homage to the glory days of Group B, DTM, IMSA etc...And the commercial they did recently is amazing with cars going all the way back to DKW and Auto Union. My only gripe is that there is no parts support here in the U.S. as we can no longer order from Audi Tradition here. So my plea to you AUDI AG is to please please reconnect us with Audi Tradition!
Secretly this is part of gymkhana R&D
V8 DTM is amazing, lasted 20 seconds with the stupid etron crap then wrote this comment and closed the video.
Amazing :) Greetings from Poland :)
Timing chain tensioner failures over 15y, ongoing..keeps me from buying Audi
#luckybastard
I would love that new e-tron RS but I could buy a house for $150,000 USD.
Such a shame that Audi is going all electric in the future
How much does it cost to get a ride along with ken in any car?
When ken banged it off the rev limiter on the drift and they inserted “he’s gone to 11” I about feel over
The future is electric ant it sucks
amazing KEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks AUDI to let you drive their cars; not like FORD with the MACH- E!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m gonna miss these cars when we go fully electric
tellement incroyable son histoire... bravo le grand !!
So next Audi rally car gonna be v8 high rev
Now a RWD...R8 !!!
Okay that was...Cool.
Damn… that’s best Audi sound ever!!!
That was such a dope couple of videos. You Lucky bastard Ken.
Who dislikes this video...  Go get your head checked.
Would have loved the title “Ken drifts everything in the Audi museum 4 hour special”
Looking forward to, please take more AUDI history out the museum, that's INSANE! BTW, thank you Eddie.....^^
I love how that DTM car still has "wood" interior haha
Ich leben die AuGee . Ken Block ist gute manner for Augee . Suppy. you take that? Kick his ass. If you need more plugs made call on me. And Big Boss Bluto did not get to drive one of the Augees. I guess he will go to his hotel room and cry. Next time big man.
Yeah Ken, we ALL want to drive the Trans Am Audis. Was really hoping they would say yes, dang.
Revs like a 1uz vvti
That DTM ita sounds like a nascar
cant wait for an Audi type Hoonicorn
Ken's next gymkhana car should be that dtm car, I'm not a huge German car fan but those old audis are too sick
Anyone seeing them reversing the E Tron by pulling on the wing ?! X.X
That German museum tour guide never smiled so much in his whole life. His face is probably sore by now.
More of Timo! He is the Audi expert
that DTM has gotta be one of Audi's coolest race cars. truly a classic !
more dtm and rally
Ive never been an Audi guy, but this DTM/group a beast was in project cars 2. I decided to test it out and I was blown away by how cool it was to drive and how beautiful it is!
Is there gonna be a Hooniquattro?
Cars are meant to driven, not in museums!!!
Sounds much, much better than the current F-1
https://youtu.be/bLObHlLtaEQ
One lucky SOB!!!
Bruno is that you ??
Audi-corn? !!!! Yes please and when?
spinal tap reference ;-)
kids in a candy shop
The first time ive seen ken block without a hat or a helmet on. Didn't recognize him🤦🏿
My dad had that Audi 100 quarto, it was perhaps my favourite car that he ever had. It did not sound that good though!
I love how even in the race car they still have the woodgrain on the dash 😂😆
THAT 90's DTM sound.
Starting from 6:00, that sound! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
"his gone to 11" 🤣
Jeez Ken tell them to buy you a 90s Quattro and make it a custom kens unicorn (uni-Quattro) , don't drive the museums Quattro.
Anybody else thinking we need a this  vs that Audi museum special 😂🤣
Tell them to start shipping to America! They flash all these old cars to get our attention but the people trying to keep them on the road can't get parts anymore...
Loving this!  Mom had a Quattro in the late 80s.  I traded my 2018 RS3 in for a 2021 TTRS.   I consider the platform Alien Technology because it punches so far above it's weight.  I'm a huge Audi fanboy now
Watching Ken smile like a kid at a toy store while driving this car let’s you know it’s something special.
Shit when Timo said trunk i was all in ...given that ken was gonna rev it
Just keeps getting better and better!
Ken livingmy dreams.. At least someone can... And I can watch..
Timo is warming up to the boys more and more. Good guy!
Poor scotto  please do an episode where he can drive something
Me thinks maybe audi looking a bit of Ken on the books wrc??
The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left.”
Engineers or mechanics  in the background at the end of the video checking to see if Ken damaged their baby while they do their outro
No mf way this engine revs to 11.5k just by the sound even before googling...9+ at most
Saw these race at Donnington park and Brands hatch, they’re weren’t as fast as the M3’s or 190E’s but fantastic to watch 30 years ago 😱😱
Ken getting old ://///
How Audi stays in America lol 😂
very acceptable marketing :)
What an epic partnership!
Madness.
Hey Ken Thanks for showing us this!!!
Love this series!
It's cool because you can just tell that the big guys at Audi and the designers love racing and doing it in the coolest way possible
I cant wait!!!!
Audi!  Audi!
Maybe put another 5 cylinder in the back for the rear wheels.     20 psi boost per engine.    1000 hp combined.   Perfect weight distribution.     In my dads 5000S, 3 of the 5 cylinders sat ahead of the front axle.     Ugh.  But it handled incredibly.  Unless you broke the front tires loose into gross understeer, then all bets were off.   I did that with copious ArmorAll on the tires, and bounced it off a curb.    No damage was done.  How?    I don’t know.    I was scared shitless the Colonel would immediately see my fuck up.   No harm no foul.
The DTM car sounds like those Judd V8 hill climb engines.
The v8 sounds  ...welcom to heaven
I wonder how Ken feels going from Ford saying they don’t want to hear any tires squeal out of their electric mustang, to Audi handing him a prototype all electric car and saying have fun
Unreal.    Audi is one of the great manufacturers who may never get their due.     Quick story, long made short, 1983, grandfather dies from heart attack after a few.   Army Colonel father and my mother and I come back to Charleston, SC from Saudi Arabia for funeral.    Otw home, my dad explains to my 12 year old brain that he is retiring from the Army.   Massive news.     We would usually stop at Rhein Mien Air Base in Frankfurt for a quick layover or whatnot, and I had never been off base on those stops.   This time we go downtown, first to the Mercedes dealership, then the Audi dealership.   No big stupid lot like in the states.  Ground floor if a nondescript building with four circles intertwined on the ground floor.   Both places had the sedan, coupe, and wagon versions of their cars on the floor, feet(meters) away from desks.    You don’t buy those.  You look, sit in them, then order what you want.   In my dad’s case, an Audi 5000S, five speed, coffee brown.   In my mom’s case, Mercedes 300D Turbo Diesel, chocolate brown.     Cash.   Both busted their asses for years overseas in serious hardship posts.  Think we were rich?    Wrong.    Stateside these two vehicles would have been unattainable.    In Frankfurt, in cash, and even with the mandatory changes for stateside legality, they were roughly 2/3 the regular price over here.     Merc was slow off the line, built turbo like a sleeping monster, then spun tires in the wet starting at about 25mph.   Cruised at 100mph like it owned that lane.     Audi, front wheel drive, smoked tires from launch, both cars oddly enough were 5 cylinders, but besides also being German, similarities ended there.   The 5 speed shifted like a modern Honda, and spoiled me for standard shift automobiles from 13 years old onward.   My brother’s 1983 5.0 liter Mustang 4-speed felt like a tractor in comparison, and I always left the stoplights sideways.   Maybe NOT by accident.     That Audi was so far ahead of its time.   The Taurus literally stole the whole design from Audi.    Audi has always been the underdog to Mercedes and BMW. This 5000S had plenty of issue, but that in-line 5 was never one of them, and it sounded coarse as hell above 4000rpms, but never let up, and more than once the handling in ANY conditions helped us avoid certain collisions.     Auto Union deserves more credit than it will ever get.    The E tron is way ahead of its time, even acknowledging Tesla.    Go buy a brushless Traxxas RC all wheel drive car and tell me electric isn’t the future here and now.    That high rpm shriek reminds me of F1, and the power density is simply astonishing!    Please note, this all comes from a guy who lives and breathes American V8 power, has never bought a car or truck without a V8, accepts smoking tires as a lifelong addiction, high octane fuel with high compression engines are my favorite smells, and the rumble and shake of a lovey V8 barely idling are a few of the things that make me smile, much like tig ole bitties in my face.      Electric is the future. And Audi deserves to be right there at the top.    Long live Auto Union!!!        Anyone got an old Audi 5000S wagon for sale?  How about a V10 drivetrain to swap in?   Hahahaha.    Now that would be so badasssssssss.
Never ever been a v8 guy in my entire life after watching that first drive I'm like dam were the v8s at,
❤
SO SICK. I love these type of videos. Ken will forever be the G.O.A.T I grew up watching and die rewatching💯🤝🐐
5:40 first time in my life seeing Ken without a cap or a helmet 😳
#LuckyBastard 😎👌
What a cool new thing!
No hat Ken Block is a rare sighting
Kens skills let him hit the jack pot with this gig with Audi.....seeing him give these old warriors track time is Kind of like handing over a priceless painting to an art thief and expecting to get it back.
That sound......only Rev to 11ish. Ken.  Off the limiter.
Super odcineczek, pozdro od fana marki :)
This was the first time id seen ken without a hat or helmet on 😂
What a great move by audi. Great rep from audi on the video as well.  Letting probably the biggest fans in. Then let Ken drive em.
What incredible piece of history on this video, we can see Ken Block´s hair for a while.
C'est un putain de pilote sa race! Il connait pas la caisse mais il part et direct au taquet!!
Not me wanting to see them look or drive the lmp900 r8s
Next episode,ken block flies space shuttle..
Lmao. "It's about to be carry on."  Scotto in heaven.
What happened to hearing the sound of the actual engine more than this popping and banging you hear now..
I only feel this cool when its snowing & im sliding all over the place in my S4
Incredible
That noise of the V8…!🙈🙈🙈🥲🔥
Le Mans  Ride ?
I would like to see Hans Stuck vs Ken Block.
i will be racing the sister car at silverstone on 23 october !
this is real life gran Turismo game pick your car, just insane.
The DTM Ken drove with the wood trim still on the dash etc! Mental!
I can't wait until we get to see what Audi has been cooking up for Ken!
Two extremely cool machines
Nice yoke on that etron.
I wonder if it has anything to do with the World Rally Championship moving forward with an electric or hybrid solution from 2022?
I loooove this partnership, these videos are soo cool <3
a Little Bit @jp Performance 😅
I had no idea they actually created the VGT in real life, two absolutely incredible cars!
If they dont let you drive any of the Le Mans cars, we riot. It would be awesome to drive the R15 TDI and the R18 TDI.
i hope to see a video with the gto 😍
in first video Audi guy in the museum gets tense when asked about driftting the cars.  In this video he's straight up sweating when Ken looks at him as he knows the quesiton already lol
I will never get used to the electric vehicles.  We have an SQ5 and an AMG C63S. Noise for me!!!
Typically the Hoonigan guys will scumbag their guests into some hoonery. This time they to a manufacturer's place and scumbagged them :D
Bloody awesome stuff.  Incredible.  All are amazing machines, would have liked him to go through the LeMans cars as well, but what a great video series.  Cheers from Australia.
That Vision GT is siiiick!
That wood still in it is just awsome nostalgia
What about Rimac Nevera? We need to see that
i cant wait for whats coming next!
Electric is LAMEEE
This series is soooo awesome!! Thanks to Audi so much to make this possible. Unbelievable! I don't know whose **** Ken had to **** for that 🤣🤣🤣
Sounds like a civic vti 96.but on roids😄
I don’t get why Ken uses such a dangerous helmet with only one side bracket microphone. That will crush your jaw into pieces during an accident. He should wear an integrale or no microphone.
Hope next time we not only see some new car, but maybe another beauty from Audi Tradition :D
E crap!
Ken ? is it better than Tesla Plaid?
Man I miss my old 84 4000 s quattro, Keep up the great work Ken.
Timo deserves a promotion and a raise. What a nice dude.
Sounds like it has a Lotus DFV swap lol siiiick
You don't tell Ken no....
🤣NICE AWES0ME C00L  _ 🍨 VIEW *_  *
Nearly didn't recognize Ken without a cap and shades anyone else ?
5:38 - Schumacher hair...
LOVING this shit😁👍
Hey Ken, if you ever want to build an Audi 200 Trans Am replica, please let me know, I have a pristine candidate. It'll still be mine though.
That sound was delicious!
Okay that is just pure PORN!!! How dare you?? :D
I already love Audi but this makes it so much better !
Love seeing the joy this new venture is bringing Ken
The Jetsons noises were so anticlimactic when played right after the screaming Audi V8. This is not a future. It's a dead end.
Give him the IMSA GTO Audi 90!
I stopped watching at the part with the over glorified golf cart. EV's can suck it.
They need to lead in with the Catch phrase..................  Another Hoonigan Exclusive!!!
5:39 who the hell is that guy!?... Oh its Ken without a hat 🧢 well there's a first time for everything.
The V8 DTM together with the Alfa 155 DTM are the best DTM cars ever built. Not because of performance or anything, just because they are cool. Full stop.
now i wanna see the R8 Diesel monster :)
so which car will the future hooniquattro be?
Dtm always has the best looking race cars! 🔥🔥
You can’t tell me there is anything better than 11500 rpm screaming around a track. I don’t even care about lap times. Long live internal combustion!!!!
Tell me the next gymkhana won't involve the new rs3! 100% it better had do Kenneth!
Ken Block Looks like guzuz 😂
Literally pulling the old b6 A4 quattro sport 5 speed outta the garage now, for a tear down and rebuild… thanks, Dicks! 🤣🥂
Ken in the car without a Hat looks like he could be Zach's dad.
While watching the look on Ken’s face while driving the DTM car I kept hearing the tiktok “Happy Dog” song in my head…  Ken, you lucky bastard.
The DTM car sounds like it should be competing in NASCAR.
Thanks Ken for letting me enjoy some of my favourite Audi's 🙏
True driver!!! Whatever he straps into he gets the most out of it.
sooooo gymkahna 12 with an Audi???
Scumbagging has no limits. Lol
I hope Audi touches into every single corner of Motorsport. They build some serious next level shit. Period.
Im sad this little Germany series is over. Seeing Ken drive these epic, rare cars was awesome!!!!
The magic begins at 5:54
Timo: Nein! Timo: Nein! Timo: Hesitates. Us and the Hoonigans: Celebrate good times, c'mon
Starts good.........but then....
I really don't look forward to EV motorsports. The sounds and smells are such a huge part of what we all love, and without it things won't be the same.
Wow and it’s actually hans stuck car
ken ohne cap ist wie jp ohne cap. komisch.
Very cool 😎
Ok... I think the DTM car is the only thing to come close to rivaling the hoonicorn V1 in terms of sound.  Mental
what about an electric urquattro rally livery gymkanaha
I'm nerding so hard right now!
Props to Audi and Timo for letting Ken take their priceless history out for a quick rip. Seems like you're right where you need to be, KB! 🤙
Please convince them to do a safari version of their Audi TT
Bring back the old DTMs pleeeeeeeease 😫
I pray whatever u build isn’t electric
I really cool to see Ken "take these cars for a spin."
THAT CAR SOUNDS FROM BEYOND!!!! 👽
Sound like my rs4
Please lend him a tdi endurance car pls pls
My heart broke in half when you "couldn't" drive the 5 cylinder trans-am car
This makes me want to redo the liveries on my Audi collection (Forza Horizon Audi Collection)
Remember wishing you could actually drive your Tamiya? Steering wheel /butt plug combo interesting.
They should ASK YOU WHAT YOU WANNA DRIVE,AND HAVE A GAS ⛽ CAN READY!!! YOUR KEN FKN BLOCK!!!!!!
This is a proof that audi is the king of Germany.. they gave a 30 year old car to be abused by a rally driver. I love audi now 🖤
Next project🤔 AUDI
you really should have gotten  technictalk with rouven moore. one of the coolest engineers i know. so much knowledge but still down to earth and loves tuning
please tell me you did a few warmup laps before shredding everything in site otherwise im going to cry
haha ken block can't hide the drug addiction his voice literally sounds like steve o 😆
Ken block seems like such an asshole to be around lol awesome driver with great taste in cars but it just seems like not even his wife likes him
“So we’re here at Audi Tradition, this is like the secret museum.” Proceeds to show the exact longitude and latitude coordinates. 0:27
4:54 an mercedes truck in a audi museum😂
Yeah The Boys !! big props to AUDI
Finally at Audi
Pity they wouldn't let you drive the Imsa car 🥰 but No under the bonnet footage of it I'm disappointed in yous 😔 🤣
No more hoonifox 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
That Vision E-tron is one of the best in cornering in gt. I can't imagine if they managed to emulate its performance in real life.
This gave me Gymkhana 1 vibes
I HAVE THAT EXACT CAR! I built it from a Tamiya RC kit lol. its AWD  Forza Horizon gonna have to up their Audi game now!  i am in love with electric cars.. petrol is so 2019
Such a HUGE shame DTM is no longer DTM. 😢 Been to so many races. Been to every race on Zandvoort because i only live like 20 minutes from the track. Really miss them roaring V8's
That is sooo dope. I have never lived my life more vicariously through anyone else..... well today at least. The whole Hoonigan Franchise is my Hero! Keep up the great documentation of your lives. Because you are living great content!
“What’s Audi cooking up for Ken?” …….Hoone-Tron Insanity no doubt.
7:10....did i see well? He's got wooden paneling dashboard??????
I don’t care if this is publicity ot not. I would like to see more of this stuff … cool cars. 🙂👍
Lucky Bastard!  Ken's got the golden ticket to the Willy Wonka of car candy stores!
Bowman Topps plz c ebbhuhaiyy name; sirbssssalot
this has been such a treat for anyone who loves Audi sports
All I saw was 11,500 rpm and I click
Best partnership ever!  Can’t wait to see the car they come up with
Rockstar best be watching for GTA v
gotta love seeing that grin on kens face when he's driving that audi, so exited to see whats to come in the future
For me this will always be only a dream to drive one of these legends.
willkommen in germany
Audi is officially the best company. Always loved them, but offering ken to drive all the historical vehicles is such a big nod.
I can image that glorious V8 in a Audi 100 road car with some mods but completly stealth.
THAT was nice - but THIS was nuts !
Timo again (4:00) scratches his forehead and admits that they already got their waders on and got belt line deep on day 1, of course we can let ya rip this other magnificent piece of history Ken... my boi 😉
imsa gto some of the most beautiful cars ever
i just saw Ken's Hair for the first time !
Should of seennif you could of taking it to the drive threw
This Sound is insane
Das muss der Marco Degenhardt sehen 😅
many 5 cylinder and pure sport audi 80' 90' car  and after that you can see ken drive an * e-tron *.........  lol.......can you explain to me where the audi mind is gone?  ohh electric car fuck this bullshit ...
Imagine what racing will be like when it's at the max of human tolerance for Accel and decel, like so fast you can die if you brake too hard from your organs hitting your rib cage, that's gonna be some crazy racing, the new group B if you like!
9:10 You're shooting a new episode of Top Gun, this car sounds like a F-14 / F-16...
Uh that 5cyl VI DTM! Buuut the IMSA..... You have to drive the IMSA and the Le Mans Cars also
Ken is such a great driver
I'm so happy for Ken. What a dream drive
Been a long-time Audi fan and love their products.  Even have B6 Nogaro Blue S4 Avant.  These videos were awesome and glad Ken appreciated what Audi was doing cause this does seem like they let their hair down a bit.
Something isn’t right with ken in audi
These go to eleven.
4:35 Merc photo bombs it lol
Need to see a Hoonigan B5.
IMSA GTO is in my top 3 cars, period. Please create a hoonigan clone of it.
Ah yes…and Audi pulled by a Mercedes truck.
Okay so next project.. finding a way to mid-mount a NA Audi V8 on a B3 Coupe... and produce 500 hp... and race it...?
Difference between the 2 cars, one has a soul, the other souless
Super cool episode with some amazing cars, especially the DTM V8 quattro, now Ken just needs to learn to yodel !!!
That car may go to 11.5 but seeing all these Audi rally cars has me going 6 to 12 !!!😉😉
Ken Block is like a 10 year old kid in a grown up mans body.
The wood trim!
To think that in about 15 years we'll more or less completely lose cars sounding as beastly as the DTM Audi... Man it's just sad
115000 RPM? thats... impressive ;)
dor the Audi DTM like, for E-fuktron dislike
To bad for GTO....
the fact that they let him drive them is amazing. Germany, German people are very special.  theres a reason all my favorite cars are porche audi/vw..
Where is JPs Ghetto Natter 😔😔
Been a minute since I've heard a good "THATS A WRAAAAPP!!"
10:35 LOVE the DOUBLE DILDO steering "wheel"!! 😂😂
And this is cars of 80/90s !!! What happen now in 2021? no pasion ,no soul,
Oh god I love that v8 DTM, it makes me miss my Audi v8.
Damn I was hoping they'd take the b5 out for a rip
GRAN TURISMO, now drive the 09 R8LMS playstation edition
Lucky bastard
Whooow a cuple times of Gänsehaut all over
It could be nice to see ken von the TransAm Audi. And the Etron vs Mustang on the Audi Track. Time diff. Which one is faster?
Hi rev Audi V8 gymkhana build soon🤞
Loved the dtm car and the proto car
I absolutely LOVE this partnership already!!  If this is how the relationship is starting, I can't wait to see what they have planned for Ken in the future!  LUCKY US, keep it coming!  I loved seeing how the lateral G's were distorting Kens face when driving the Vision GT!
Which Ken car would be added to mobile game CSR2 xD?? Hoonigan? Hoonitruck? Escort?
Not gonna lie, i closed the video when that electric washingmachine took the stage
Hans-Joachim Stuck and Walter Röhrl are 2 legends. I'd love to see a meeting with them
It's truly a tragedy to drive these Amazing cars! You can tell it was pure Aganey!🥰🥰🥰🤪🤪🤪🤪😉😉😉😉
If only they had let him drive the 90 GTO
Audi is going to make so much money from these videos ...they just put themselves on the map for everyone in America
Was the normal rap too loud?
Ok, Who else is waiting for the IMSA GTO 😍😍😍😍
👍
could just listen to for hours.
In Forza I would love to see a regular Audi V8, but with racing bumpers and stuff. It's in Project CARS 3, why can't we have it in more games?
These are all my favorite sim racing cars that Ken gets to drive!
E-Tron looks like something Moon Knight might drive...
okay, they thought it'll be a good advertisement for Audi, however, it became an ad for Ken Block who was not a famous driver in the professional car sports era. either way, good for us to see these legendaries in the unflavoured boring cars nowadays. however, still, electric cars are the suicide of motorsports, does not matter how you try to serve it
Straight up alien spaceship that electric racer
need a button for "I FUCKING LOVE THIS"😍
These will never get old.
Bring back the quad turbo v 12s make it mid engine on active aero and have mr freevalve show you how to get it done
There's not a single AUDI fan boy in the world right now who not watching  and changing all there project plans 😂.
That exhaust note is purely satisfying 😁😁
I actually have a custom build golf mk3 convertible vr6 which i am thinking to swap with the same audi v8 (not as high reving as the audi ken drove).....
When he's driving his face looks lika a lego character
Video currently at 11k likes - perfect!
Suspension looks effortless on the dtm the etron looks like a box of rocks on the wrong tires
that electrical bull shit , really is boring as FUCK. We need combustion engines ! Not electrical crap !
Schäm dich Ken Block- So respektlos mit diesen Fahrzeugen  von Audi Tradition umzugehen ich echt eine Schande
Definitely the cold tyres that caused the spin, not the nigh on 1000Nm 😆  Same every time i spin off too. Bloody tyres,..every time 😆
I hope he builds a mad Audi like he did the mustang when he was with ford.
I hope it's an S4 gymkhana car! That would be amazing. I have a feeling the Audi guys won't disappoint.
Lucky bastard is an understatement.
HJ Stuck is vomitting seeing this...
The noise… oh my god the noise…. Audi race cars sound the best… v8 thunder or i5 worble 👍
They just don't build em like that anymore
How sexy do those DTM cars look. DAMN
Since Ken is with Audi we gotta have Gymkhana x Nürburgring
Audi are the nuts for sure. their cars over the years are just born to race.
5:54 Dr. Crazy  <3
I’ve loved Audi since 2007 and still want one
The electric cars just don't hit the same bro. I can't get used to them
Big kids toys 🚘
I wish to see Ken driving that V8 DTM Audi in some oldschool car races... on Nürburgring or Nordschleife...
They must not care about those cars to let such a noob trash them
Nice, that a8 was a treat 👌
Eleven is heaven
I can’t feel the power in electric cars. 1 gear, 1 😂. Pedal to the metal
I just hauled a 1990 V8 Quattro to the junk yard Ken. I broke my heart!
Thanks, but electric cars NOT for me...
Another awesome video.👍
Nice. That e-tron Vision GT seems to be almost as exciting as the V8 DTM.  ;-)
Может кто-нибудь уже переведет на русский?
Too bad they wouldn't let him drive the IMSA, that would have been awesome. Still loved that V8 though.   But. For me electrified motorsports is such a huge turnoff. 100% marketing, 0% entertainment.  (Sorry, can''t help it)
Ken is living every car enthusiasts dream out here. Cars us ordinary ppl can only dream of or see in video games.. just wow.
Congrats ken! You have definitely earned this!
super cool series of videos... too fun to watch
Had the same d11 v8 audi. Enjoyed it so much. Awesome v8 sound, best version of quattro.
Smart move Audi…
5:39 didnt know that ken had quite the haircut 😳
Alitle bit of wee came out watching this
High reving v8 then electric motor sound, sadness...
I really want that Unimog.
I'm going to need more clean socks
Electric audi at the end. was end of excitement too.... For Block, and for viewers...
Great to see how cool electric race cars will be in the future
What an annoying host... that stupid laugh and constant yipyapping....  Oh shut up please....
That IMSA GTO car is dream car for me
Timo looking scared and curious at the same time
Luckiest man on planet earth. Brilliant. Thanks. Love from the UK ❤️
Man...was hoping for a 24 part series where you drive each vehicle haha... definitely fun to watch
hooniquattro
Ultra modern and very fast prototype electric hair dryer or 11,500 rpm V8  old DTM car. My emotional reaction to each car is entirely the opposite. The sounds of him drifting the V8 and hitting the limiter was music to my ears. I have zero positive reaction to the grand tourismo inspired modern hyper machine.
Lucky bastard indeed!
The DTM V8 is the pinnacle of car sound for me! This is what my mind envisions when I think of a race car. Pure perfection, thank you for blessing our ears Audi🙏
They literally scumbagged Audi into lettin Ken drive their museum cars.
well buy your used audis now before they get expensive
The V8 still to this day is one of the sexiest cars ever built in my opinion! Of course the interior looks dated now, but the exterior is sexy as fuck! Unfortunately, for a little worker bee like me it needs way too much fuel, but if I win the lottery some day I’m gonna get one of those and put the RS6 V8 in it!
I have Audi V8 if you need one.
2:30 winningest
5:38 is the first time I've seen Ken's hair in forever... I can't remember the last time I saw him without a hat or helmet on.
No matter what he tells about which kind of cars is more fun... *simply compare his face expressions*
Timo was awesome in this series.
I love that they keep these in working condition. So cool to take a little piece of history out like that
When no one noticed @ 11:08 the guy in the background is pulling the car by its spoiler by HIMSELF ... being that light with 990nm is totally insane Ken was in control and only spun once
Nothing replaces a high revving V8 despite what all the Gretas want
DTM are just on another level of motor racing, love them coming over to Brands Hatch to race just a shame the series is sort of over and turned into a GT3 series now
11......⛳👏
Are they giving Ken a drive in something big?
Holy LITTERALLY 🦇 man
5:38 is the first time in his life that Ken Block has not worn a hat or helmet.
Freakin amazing
"Whatever Audi is cooking up for Ken" is gonna be really fun in Horizon 5!!
All I can say is “wow” the DTM car sounds so good. The V8 noises sound INSANE!!! That’s a V8 noise that can’t be unheard.
I think having all those m3's doing donuts on main channel paid off ... now audi tries to be noticed :D (but yes, still really nice cars, and have fun with any future cars!)
Audi will find too late that the engines have been destroyed 😂
Bring back vintage 90s DTM. No spec changes run it how it was in the 90s.
Is this really Ken block? Isn´t he like 35 or something? I´m 55 and this guy is at least my age or older..
Mother **** you are so lucky man
11,500 rpm V8 😎🤘
How sick electric cars sound, I know people may start bitching about it, but I love it
is Ken okay? i mean, healthwise? i dont know, i just got a feeling while watching this and i like him a lot so i am just worried a bit
I wonder how that beast would've gone against the original R32GTR at Bathurst back in the day. Now THAT would be something to see.
The footage of Ken driving the DTM let us know what his O face looks like.  But we do need to get Ken to describe the difficulty of walking around and driving these incredible vehicles while having an erection the entire time.
Please bring out the old B5's!  They need to see the light!  It is so fun seeing Ken rip these old legends around
That sound 😍😍😍😍
Beautiful car. I own the production version. 1991 Audi v8 Quattro all aluminum 3.6 v8. Sadly mines auto
The electric may be quick but it has the wrong sound and lacks the emotion of the screaming V8.
Have Hans Stuck and Ken ever met/driven together?  Seems like they would get along well.
Damn, this DTM car was driven by Hans Stuck!.
ken - audi-24-lemans Maybe
The sound of that V8 is unbelievable!
this high rpm audi is EXACTLY what the next HOONICORN needs.....
1:55 My first car! 1996 Forest Green Audi 90 Quattro but with a veee six 2.8L  <3
This is the 1st time ive seen Ken with no cap or helmet on.  Lol✌☘☘☘
Lucky Bar Steward needs to be on a t-shirt with all the audi cars You drove!
I feel like the Only virgin in the room watching this....
The Imsa GTO would've been awesome. Shame they didn't let him drive it
Epic wow 🤩
VAG to the world!! 🔥🔥🔥🚀
Love this!!!!! Get those old cars out and celebrate the goodness that is Audi!
lucky bastard
I wanna see ken in the 90 IMSA GTO
2:31 - Man this is still one of my dream cars ever since I first saw it during the Super Touring (BTCC) days. Would love to own this!!
1:18 That's insane! Where can I find more footage of this?
You guys gotta build a audi 100 with a audi rs5 v8 motor I mean it would come close
And now let h j stuck drive. He will show you how to drive the v8 realy fast! He is only 70 years old.
Electric boredom. Like an Electrolux vacumcleaner, just bigger. Boooooring
Loving every second
I think it would be nice to see Ken drive a 959 or 911 GT1 because the are Porsche and Porsche is part of Volkwagen
I see a future hoonicorn  style build with an audi
Gold content. Thank you!
I didn’t know how I felt about the change between Ford an Audi. holy shit!  Hi revving V-8 from Audi that’s bad ass
It really sounds like an sb-2, except its not as shrieky
my first car is audi s3 8l. and i dont want to stop driving it <3 great car, great video Ken
The awkward laughing about the rpms fucking killed me🤣🤣 "11ish" yall are just thinkin "limiter"
the old cars are just more interesting
I love European cars 🔥
Props to Audi for this one 🤌🏻
The Walter Roehrl Quattro & the Hans-Joachim Stuck V8 are two of the most legendary german racing cars you can possibly drive.
Ken Block looks like Mike Dean's  less stoned younger brother
I've always liked Audi, now I love them, cheers Ken 😃
Great cars from a legendary brand.  Nice work Audi getting Ken as a figure in them, it certainly won't harm North America Audi sales.
That Moment, when Ken Block drives by at ur House and u dont knew it :/
Ken i would love to see you drift and rally around the outskirts of my town, lots of nice lines. hairpins, long curves, slopes, gravel roads, im sure you could start your own rally around here honestly plus rockingham speedway is opening up soon i think would make a great deal of people show up and support the old raceways coming back to life lol
I think i'll look for an audi as my first car now
Awesome video! My favorite part was when the Audi rep said "Trunk Maybe". @5:32
Audi Gymkhana coming soon
Totally shit without the engine noise
Damn that sounds good! So angry
@5:38 Ken has hair? Figured he was Bald, LOL
It's true that the quattro was the first DTM car, but not the first circuit racer. Audi ran a group 2 coupe in the DRM (the forerunner of the DTM) around 1981 and 1982. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Neu5xVbm0vc
"Lucky bastard" is the right term for Ken. He and Scotto are like kids in the candy store and Timo is quietly suffering because he has "seen our videos"... 🤪😁😁😁
That's an audi 80! Aaaaahhhhhhhh!!!              i like it.
Here for the engine sound not here for electric shit cars btw  has much dislikes as the Start numble of Ken.
Ken needs to visit the Nissan secret garage
AUDI 🤩💪🏻👍🏻💪🏻🤩 Made in GERMANY 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
No Audi 90 IMSA GTO?? :( Big letdown
It Sounds like a ford capri RS-3100.
That Audi V8 was/is a legend!
H.J. Stuck should show Ken how to drive an Audi xD
Bechara ko audi trans am diya h hi.. kya hi izzat hai ken ka
Let Ken drive IMSA car! It was so unbeatable in the past!
can drive 2    like a mad man ,  if helps my cv lol
Lucky Bastard, you said it and I am just repeating it👏👏👏
Great! Great! Great!
Never seen ken block's hair until this episode, hahaha
need a team m8 ken???
Hab ich da Ruben gesehen ( aka Dr. Crazy)?
This is the sound of the car Satan drives when he visits the mortal world.
Fun fact: the road legal version is called Audi V8
Sadly from 2030 on all combustion cars including classics will be banned from public streets in entire EU and Scandinavia  :-( In Germany the  Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025 on by  reducing all conventional fuel stations to only one state operated  central gas station per city or county. Now they even want to slow down  all the gas pumps from 20 litre per minute to 2 litre per minute...From  2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as  exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox  oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no  investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even  created a new kind of crime here, called emissions and smoke crime. Called "Bundesabgasbespaßungsverbotsverordnung" in German.... :-/
I'm so far behind,still trying to wrap my head around that the hoonicorn isn't there and then short stint with Subaru, but Audi defo has some serious race heritage!wondering now if Scotto is gonna get a hooniDTM one off build going now for the gymkhanas?
Good lord, I've just seen Blocks head without a hat on it 5:38
spin and skid marks from 9:55 show up in the "ken block joins Audi video" at 12:07? both awesome videos!
Mantap BO55KU ❗👊🏻
Wow  V8 DTM
Much better than that gr B!
If everything get electrified i think it's gonna kill the motorsport, there is noway i'm gonna enjoy watching "RC-cars" without sound compared to the old school with roaring engines.
why picture suck even at 1080? xDDD
Big upps audi 🙌
Excited to see the electric cars he gets to inflict his talents on!  I am planning to purchase the E-Tron GT in 2022.
I'm not Ken Block... But  a couple of those LeMans R-10 V10 TDI's.... you'd need a race track with no noise restrictions to take that for a ride. The answer to that would probably be no, but that would have been one of my choices for a test drive.   My intro to Audi was the Audi 5000 TurboDiesel in 1983... such a nice grand touring vehicle for the Western United States.
So erm..... Audicorn, hoonadi hoonarings? Then what chassis smaller a4 or go full boat a6? So much intrigue for the future.
Audi needs to build Ken an Audicorn!
I was fortunate enough to work at Lime Rock Park in the mid to late 80's. Audi Quattro was the dominant force. Good time. Just purchased an 2001 TT. Bringing back fond memories.👍
E-car was awesome. Great explanation on the weight in turns.
Good job.
what's with this no drift thing - you hired Ken Block and now you're telling him NOT to drift, what the heck?
Gt6 all over again
This content feels really refreshing Im crazy intrigued to see what Audi has going on!
So many levels of awesome
Oh , the icone and best Driver  is Walter   !  and not ken . Ken from Barbie
man thank you Audi for letting this happen these cars can only be shown this way
Love these videos. Audi owner and fan before they were fashionable. Welcome aboard Ken.
Seriously irritating accents, can’t stand it.
Timo being like "I don't wanna lose my job"
Looking forward to the gymkhana with a Audi Sport Quattro S1.
How many people just started looking for a Audi project car…
Dream car audi v8 d11.
Really Lucky Bastard.... hahaa I am dreaming of having a blast in 2012 RS5 :)
..... It just clicked that Ken is a rally driver, and Audi doesn't really do rally anymore, so now I'm really curious on what their going to put him in, because when I see new Audi the last thing I think of is dirt
I wanna see a DTM hoonicoon
I wanna see Ken race LeMans
Amazing
Some kind of issue with the audio around 9 minute mark it just goes silent.
How he drives this Audi LOL he is rally driver, you can see
Ken.. You are One Lucky Bastard‼️😂✌️❤️
09:55- "Game Over"... ..Continue In... (Furiously Digging for quarters..)👊
This car is amazing…but you really should drive the DTM Alfa-Romeo from the 90’s
I prefer old scholl V8 engine with great sound
Got me looking at Audi project cars
Poor Timo, he looks like he’s ready to pass out in these videos.
too bad he did not drive the IMSA GTO, my favourite racecar
The sound that will never get me in a EV. Such music!
Lucky bastard cup sounds like the new hoonigan CPT autocross club
Please next the Audi 80 GTO IMSA - that 5cyl Turbo sound is glorius <3
I would love to see this become a series! Ken drives Audi Heritage!
11ish😂😂😂
:( i wanted to see the 90 gto being driven
Like I said I am still disappointed that we don't get the Fox body Mustang that buddy Mustang that Ken was going to build but like this kind of brings up a new ball game new cars and maybe Baja or offroad racing
What a dream come true - allowed to drive a Group B, touch a TransAm, drive a DTM V8...  All those cars that had big impact on racing... Lucky Bastard
Audi r8 lemans test ?
The steering yolk in the Vision GT looks like you would be holding two bratwursts :D
Loving the Spinal Tap references
I have loved Audi's my whole life so when I see  Ken enjoying the cars that I  have cared so much about for so long... It makes me feel like I am sharing something.
The Vision GT looks and sounds like an R/C car... LOL
Watching that thing hang the tail out is straight up nirvana
what an abomonation that electric thing is, god i pray we never see race series like this.
Scotto’s laugh at 7:04 says everything, the DTM car was so insane
I'm still not sure who's more exided about the collaboration with Audi, Ken or Scotto...
The secret storage is not in that office.  Dont believe it people.
OMG
Audi letting Ken do this shows what a great partnership it is.
Wait wait wait...I just saw for the first time Ken without hat or helmet... @5:36... O_O
Wow!! That thing sounds AMAZING!!!!!!
3:07 That's the last thing I've expected on a racing car in this time. A PS2-Sponsorship 😂
Audi entering rally again is good for everyone they were gone way too long from the Subaru vs Mitsubishi era
All race cars should be required to be able to be driven this way. Racing would be so much more fun to watch
I remember Frank biela dominating btcc with the 4wd a4
Can't wait to see Ken's signature Audi!
When the rotary goes in my RX-7, i want to swap in the Audi inline 5 from the TT-RS/RS3. One of the most unique and insane motors worthy of replacing the amazingly unique rotary engine. Which coincidentally was developed by NSU who was later merged into the Auto Union group, so it'd be essentially keeping with the heritage, technically.
that e Tron sounds like a jet
Very lucky bee star dad
🙌🙌🙌
Now that's a  proper use of Spinal Tap!
Audi have a legendary collection of pioneering racing cars amazing you can't beat the 5 pot turbo sound
I am sooooo happy Ken is on board with Audi. Meant to be.
God, that sound of the V8. drool..... It's why I fell in love with DTM.
Never cared for European manufacturers much but man you gotta love Audi for letting this happen
ive never seen ken without a cap or a helmet, looks like a completely different person now
Hey editor, please stop putting rap beats over the sounds of the cars.
i wish to have the Engine to put it in a normal Audi 200/300 also as shifter but With the complet interrior in, our give me the Details for all tze same parts what i need to Build the same Engine!!!!👍🏼😉👌🏼
that dtm car sounded like a stock car engine watch the market for 90s audi cars are going to go through the roof now that ken is with audi
I don't know are people going to watch racing when cars are all electric?? The DTM V8 was awesome to watch the last car not so much.
So good to see someone showing off the classic Audis. I had a 20v 5cyl quattro, they are such fun cars and the old Audis just aren't seen much now.
That NA V8 induction noise tho!
I want that DTM to be the next HOONI**** 🥸👍🔥🔥🔥
The sound😍
I CANNOT WAIT to see what Audi is cooking up for/with Ken.
ken block: ***quiet*** audi: i bet you cant shred with 4 rings on your bonnet  Ken block: hold my driftkhana !!!!
"Nope... Nope... *thinks intensely*"  Scotto: Oh, there's a delay!  "*a fuck it*
Amazing advertising and still give the gear heads what they want. Smart audi
Hmmm.... That doesn't sound like the Audi V8 I had back in the days.... 🤔 Probably just other sparkplugs... 😂🤘
I been smiling for 10minutes straight...im even getting cramps and spasms on my cheekbones😂😂😂 thanks Audi!!! Y'all did this 'for da boyz'....and I never seen Ken w/o a cap or helmet or sunglasses on...the goof @ 5:41 killed me, i bet no other car made Ken do that...hahahaha
One can never have enough Spinal Tap references.
Seriously talented guy
Audi builing the next Gymkhana car?
Remember when Ken helped launch the Ford Mach-E, then they cut his funding? I hope they are watching him blitz this E-Tron!
I just realized this is the first time I saw ken without a hat.  I almost did not recognize him.
Those transams holy shit man! So many mental cars they have and it’s great they are letting some be driven again
Scott’s gotta be hyped to be working with Audi… lucky guys
turn a DTM into the Hoonicorn v3?
Two things which love since I was a little boy: Audi and Ken Block. Now look we have here. This is incredible!!
I want to know what from Audi's portfolio will become the new Gymkhana car. Hooniquattro?
So sad you didn't get to drive the IMSA GTO :(
This looks like a metric fuck load of fun
Ken probably should race in some sort of race maybe with an AE-86? Idk
Aweaome video ken you are awesome and i realy like this video and your youtubechanel and your videos is awesome keap it up ken
That V8, together with M3’s and 190 EVO II’s is what the worlds coolest period of time in racing history was made of. DTM has never been and never will as wonderful as it has been in these days
Ken why have you been hiding those luscious locks from us all this time!
5:38 holy shit, Ken has hair. I have never seen his head in my life.
You guys are going to give Timo a hart attack
NASCAR sounds from an Audi make me smile (:
Audi probably hates ken already 😂
Ken Block to ABT next season...cut it
I have been an Audi enthusiast my whole life, i just love the old models! Ive own a 80 cab, 100 turboquattro C3, Audi S4 and S6 C4 and will own alot more of them oldies, nothing beats the  5cyl sound
I hope next video will be Ken on the Nurburgring...full send!!!
2:31 my favourite car in Toca Race Driver for PS2, 2:42 my favourite car of GranTurismo 4 on PS2... I miss my childhood and i wanna say thanks for having a small spot for these 2 wonderful cars on this video 😎
Older Audis are soo underrated, especially the A4 B5 1.8TQM!
You should also drive one of the Le Mans cars from Audi. Great Stuff, I mean. And try driving on Nürburgring Nordschleife. It is called "Die grüne Hölle" - The green hell.
so, is ford sleeping in the wet spot now?
would love to see the I5 imsa 90 hooned, i dont think you can get better content for audi fans than this.
I'm surprised to see the footage at 5:38. I've never seen Block without a cap or helmet. That's a first.
You can skip this Ad in 5.. Yes!!! 4.. Yes yes yes!  3!!! COME ON hurry hurry
That electic car is so boring compare to old V8 , great day in the office Ken 👍
I desperately want a set of turbofan wheels. I’m getting into spec e30 racing and way to build a “street car” which will carry the same setup/spare engine, as the race car and would love a set to put on it. Would be a fun canyon car/show piece.
Makes me want an audi...
Man that sound is amazing.
I could listen to that v8 run the track all day !!!
Sheeeeesh
Bad ass u lucky mother.......😁✌
Watch Hans Stuck race ---^ at nuhrburgring north https://youtu.be/z0Hptgwy7sY
Hoonicorn Audi based v8 😅😈
Love how that car still has the wood on the dash.
hoonicorn v3 audi edition when
I own a a4 and love it very much, happy ken is having a blast
Paused for the V8 rev limit,  put headphones on... ohhh it hurt so good.
High revving v8 >
Sad we couldn’t see the 44 200 car but the V8 was badass too. Loved seeing Ken smiling. Would love to see the 200 TA in a parade one day. Dream.
You know German cars are bullet proof designed when Ken Block tries to kill it and the car kills Ken instead.
3:12 play station 2 😍
Audi by far best car company in the world. I love what they do
Lucky bastard
Каким бы крутым не был E-tron но заметьте, довольная улыбка на лице у Кена была именно на легендарных S1 и v8
Noooo Do some more cars:-)
Audi is so much cooler than I realized
5:42 - That moment when your realize Ken actually has a top to his head!
Nobody mention the V8 controversy - right?
German touring car  Psycho machine！
"Trunk Maybe." :O
Lucky bastard.
Letting you guys in to drive cars is one of the smartest marketing moves Audi has ever made.
How many race get ups does ken have? Suit/helmet/gloves/shoes
What if they build an old body design car for him to drift with modern chassis and engine. maybe that classic looking Audi Quattro sports EV.
5:55 Ruven! One of the most fun and coolest dudes out there!
I would love to see Timo get a ride in the Hoonicorn as a thanks for leting you drive all the Audis if its possible.... Any plans of an Audi version?
Hope they build a bonkers Audi, "Hooncorn style"
So, what was the lap time on the DTM car?
I’ve got a set of those BBS e26’s if anyone wants to buy them.
sounds better then current F-1 cars
I love how they were looking at the body of the car to see if there was any damage
Why does Ken without a hat Look like a complete strenger to me?
this whole series is proof that nobody is safe from being scumbagged… even one of the worlds biggest auto manufactuerers
Straight up guys...... Which one of my balls you want for this car??...... You can have both and a kidney if you like, f**k it I don't need em 😂😂
Ken does another gymkana but gets to use all old audi race cars? HELLLLLL YEAAAAAAAHHHHH
German engineering that v8 sounds so freaking amazing it’s ridiculous
All we need is a Hoonicorn type variant of the Audi R8
Thank you Audi This is amazing!
I love how Ken's only response to driving another one-off multi million dollar racecar is just the smile!
Best thing to happen in modern motorsport history
The good ole days of V8 DTM so awesome
Ken with the Jimmy Neutron hair swoop one time for the one time.😀
Ken at Audi is going to open the doors to a lot of design/driveability features and media.
kinda cringy, its like they don't want you to drive the cars.
The whines and squeals of that Vision GT are amazing. Fuck any of the old school curmudgeons that whine about losing the sounds of gas cars going away.
I love how Kens like "I can drift it right?l" and the German guys is screaming "Nein Nein Nein Nein" internally but doesn't know what to say 😂
Ken starting up the car was hilarious, also the first time I've seen his hair lol.
Ken looks like the guy you play golf with and drives like a video game 😂
looks like Audi is about to eat Tesla's lunch
nice =D
Ken's life is a video game.
Conversation with my son: Dad: You can become whatever you want when you grow up. Son: I want to be Ken Block. Dad: Me too son, me too.
Couldn't care less about electric cars 🙃 really hope f1s announcement of synthetic fuel paves the way for widespread adoption, because electric cars are so dull
That's one more init....?
I'm so excited for this Audi collab! Makes me feel so much better about my tuned 8V A3 Quattro 🥲
The GTO has been one of my absolute favorite race cars to ever exist. Truly jealous of them being in the presence of one.
First time I visited the DTM was in Belgium Zolder circuit. I remember hearing the sounds from the circuit as we walked to the entrance. I could not believe it, the V8, M3 and 190 evo, it was like this can’t be the sound. But yes man it was !!!
That 11.5k RPM V8  sounds so nice it gave me teary eyes ..   i Could lay in bed and listen to that for hours
Audi coming back to WRC for 2022 with a hybrid???
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This car sounds incredible!! 😍
isn't that the best sounding V8, I put that right next to the Judd V8s.
So Cool
Everyone lets hear it for Timo he is such a good host.
It sounds like Honda with 11k RPM.
So the new electric lambo is almost ready, some "Y" designs in the lights and presto.
You are very lucky ...... i mean very lucky to drive those cars Ken . Audi thank you for showing these legends again 🙌
I have been in love with Audi and VDub since I was a boy. I have been working on Audi's for 14 years now and I have to say I am loving this. Also really stoked that Ken is finally with Audi. Going to be amazing.
Hearing and seeing this car being driven is amazing.... but I don't think I've ever seen Ken without a hat on 5:40
2:55 That car doesn't have a steering wheel, it has steering handles. These cars are wild.
I cant tell if Timo is getting fired after this series or a MASSIVE raise
HE HAS HAIR! 5:41
Ken should build one of those DTM cars and go all out on it.
I have never seen this man without a hat and now I find out he actually has lots of hair lmao
Can’t wait to see the Audi Hoonicorn. I know it’s going to be INSANE
Ken went from having a blast to super serious transitioning between the DTM and Vision GT car.
This video just goes to show how boring racing will be in the future with these silent E-cars.
Milk the shit outa that AUDI KEN🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
So do you drive for Ford and Audi?
My dad had a stock Audi V8 4.2l V8 it is very underrated car which was at the time better then BMW and Mercedes saloons
The rarest sight of all @5:38... Ken Block's hair.
Timo has really blossomed throughout this series
This series has been absolutely the best!!!  I'm totally geeking out...you're totally geeking out...because Ken and Scotto and the whole crew are absolutely totally geeking out in some of the most amazing cars ever.  As someone else said, what great publicity!!!   That V8 car he drove looks like your dad's car that got turned into a world champion race car.  So great.
Audi knows how to deal with secret marketing, Ofcourse they know ken block has enormous reach, So they show the world, what they had back then, Imagine the new tech, That you can get if you got the $$$ marketing at the finest and u gotta drive them once in a while otherwise it breaks.Screw AMG, You guys also kill it with the edits
..and Larry said he has to scam his way into driving cool cars. 😆😆 Well, look at Ken.
I can’t wait to see what Audi is going to make for Ken 😁
I mean something awesome would be a seris where Ken just drives museum cars whilst a running commentary tells the history to inttoduce people too new motorsport and old
who is this young Kevin Costner look like guy who drives this awesome piece of car history?
Damn Ken has the coolest life.
I thought I was gonna be the first to comment
0:26 Those coordinates are about 140km away from Ingolstadt :D
drive the imsa audi ken
Hope you still checking out Jp... id already seen it at jp videos that you are there so is ther a special epsiode on hoonigans for it
I'm waiting for the magical custom Audi. Will Audi build Ken a Hoonicorn gapper?
Love the Audi V8's
Ok Ken, when do I get you cheer for you on a team at the 24hrs of Daytona? Seriously though go get a seat in one of the Audis.....
Finaly somebody drives this historic cars like they were built for. A V8 DTM sideways. The last guy who did this was Walter Röhrl. 😁👍
Nice! I love the idea of driving *someone else's* car that hard. Being the sole mechanic in my garage I prefer to be more gentle on the equipment. I need to go pick up a rental... ;)
that E thing sucks lol look how they try to gather the emotions from the real car to make ur head mix up the emotions of both so they can sell their e crap
Ken use your magical powers and talk to the forza guys about putting these in horizon 5
*"secret museum"* puts the location in the video
when ken joint audi i really like a lot audi right now!!! i think audi is sleeper company with a lot technology even 90's era
80 coupe s2 and the a8 coupe that never went to production are my all time favourites
Love Ken Block's Videos
Lucky Barstool lol 👌👌👌
I want an Audi now😮
Ken goes DTM 🤣🤣
Make sure Every car in Forza sounds exactly like they’re supposed to or we will never play the game again teen sound
So freaking RAD!!!
Ken has a full head of hair?!!!
Ken's face when that DTM started up properly...glorious.
Awesome trip. Thanks for sharing w us
I get its just a test day but isnt a harness without a hans device a terrible idea?
I wan to see ken drive the vision gt at le man's next year
Wish he could have driven the 90 imsa gto
Man, those cars!! Ken is a very very lucky fella... Lucky Bastard actually ;;)
Ich bin ein Freund von Block, aber ich finde es noch geiler, wie Timo die Jung's schööön im Rahmen hält!!! Und man muss leider auch ganz ehrlich sagen, Block hat keine Ahnung von Rundstrecken Autos!! Keine 100m gefahren und er steht mit einem DTM Auto quer!!
Thx Audi !!! & Thx Sir KenBlock !!!!🤘😜
Hopefully Ken is back in RX and Andreas is his teammate!
This video shows exactly what is the problem with electric race cars vs. the old cars: just too perfect and no emotion aka boring...
If audi's werent such complete pieces of shit id be stoked for this switch.
i never seen Ken hair before
To all the young folks out there, you too could be a Ken Block some day. Just work hard and dream big!
Dusting Hoffman can drive!
Oh man! I can't wait to see Ken's Audi rally car that they've been working on.
My two takeaways after this 3 part series. 1: Audi snatched Ken up for the purpose of showing they fully intend on baking in fun and potential madness into the electric cars and he'll be used to help showcase to what extremes. 2: When I eventually have an electric car, first mod will be to get rid of whatever sound deadening is around the drive train to get the electric race car loud gear whine. Maybe gear whine will be the new "loud exhaust".
Ken, please just take a moment to realize what you have been able to do! It's so AWESOME! LUCKY BASTARD!!! Thanks for sharing!
Audi needs to start their own YouTube channel and do hour long video's on every one of those cars🤯
Yeaaaah..Audi is on another level🥰
If I know Audi as a team.. its gonna be something mindblowing.. They never do ok job, they always do very best & thats why I love their cars :)
fucking wild
The fact they're letting him drive those cars is insane.
Amazing 🥰
Absolutely loving this Audi content. Great to see all the history!!
When is the AUDI HOONICORN coming ?
Oh I love those cars.
Pure madness 😁 Audi mates there lit vibes😎🤘
Lucky bastard 👍👍
Man Ken just scumbaggin the ish outta Audi😁
Audi needs to make this a yearly recurring event partnership with Ken and Scotto!
Truth be told, since Ken is now a member of Team Audi, it would be beneficial to him to get as much wheel time in the Audi classics to learn about the cars and better himself as an Audi driver.
This has to be the next gymkana car!
Love these cars so much.
I don’t think Audi realized what they were getting into when they signed ken to the team🤣 you guys are like kids in a candy store but the Audi people are scared shitless
Yeah but it goes to 11... Right when I was thinking to myself dream day you said, dream come true.. so epic.. 43.cbs
Sounds better than nascar
Wow wow wow Amazing! Gooo Ken!🇸🇪👍
Any time Ken gets the big wide eye look you know its a good time
I love that Ken uses Hert's sign off.
My dream. A high revving v8.
Ken Audi needs an electric rwd ttrs…..
Sounds very V8ish
That Audi V8 sounds so good
So does anyone know what Ken is racing for Audi?  And did he leave Subaru?
Hoonigan/Audi🏁
I didn't know Ken had hair I thought that Monster hat was part of his head 😂
😵😵😵
Yaaaaaaa buddddyyyyy so glade to see your finally with Audi good for you bratha
"SSCCHHAAAAWWIIING" Mike meyers.. but the first 2 "No's" Supreme let down ugh, 90-91 T/A epitome of audi heroism!
10:30 Germans love sausages so much they made a steering wheel out of them😳
DTM gives me the fizzz
Fuck me i cant wait for the imsa gto please rip it
With every car Scotto becomes more and more jealous
Man I grew up at the right time for Motorsport begin a 80s kid!! The noise brings back some memories 😍
Audi alweys makes amazing racing cars with huge successes.
Audi offering Ken to drive these cars is such good publicity and such a treat for us car enthusiasts. I love Audi, been driving Audi since 2013!
Ken Block driving all the cars in my video game garage
#LuckyBastard
