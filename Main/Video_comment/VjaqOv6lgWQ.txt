This just proves how great of a person he is and how genuine this guys’s friendship and love for each other is props to them for doing all this and being where they’re at
Tobi is a great role model for the young audience sidemen have. A humble and respectful human being.
what a guy
Tobi is definitely the best of the Sidemen
Complex template lol
why he always glazin
God he is so f*****g boring, he’s an absolute nothing of a personality
Wallabees are fire, I used to rock black & a purple ones loved um! The fila walking boots were cool!! 💯
I love his accent
He’s the real man
I need a Tobi in my life x
Tobi is just different. So respectful, kind, down to earth.
my name is malachi
🤩🤩🤩🤩‼️🤩🤩🤩🤩
ayyy so sick
the Kanye stuff didnt age well lmao
Tobi is literally so humble
Tobi ain’t adidas basically ur boss
Harry got 6 bills spent on him 🤣
GOD bless you and your family
Harry's shoes are actually amazing. 😂
this whole kanye thing has aged so badly lmaooo
Saying he couldn't pull of Jordans but a pair of J1 Chicago's would look insane with that fit
9:20 💀 💀
''Im a big fan of Kanye'' Well that didn't age well.
Those Kanye comments looking maaaad now 😅
Subbed! Only cause of the host! He's one of the great hosts I've seen on YouTube!
hats off,  humble. definitely deserves success and more.🔥
toby im begging keep the noodle jacket up for 1 more year so I can rack up the p to buy it

Saying hes the kanye of youtube has not aged well
I love Tobi, he is so generous and loves his friends and family so much it’s heart warming
Nah but Tobi got sick style tho
What's the pant that tobi wears bro it's so cool
Icl sdmn wld make bare money  if they made shoes
Tobi is so handsome its crazy, even as a lad i find him attractive
Tobi's such a great dude! Wherever he goes he never forgets about getting something for his friends or family
Man makes that in an hour and he’s speaking like he’s broke. That really is refreshing
The Kid shoes were the most expensive ones 😅
Nah tobis style is dead
The baby shoes were not on the receipt. Was wondering how much they cost if the adult pair cost £10,000.
We want a collab with ISHOWSPEED
i mean they split sidemen 7 ways, so in reality... he makes most his money off his own channel
Bruh Craig looks like Jayson Tatum
Tobi is a legend bro ❤🎉
Tobi i like adidas shoes
i thought tobi had an adidas deal or somethin because i’ve only ever seen him wear adidas trainers and football boots
Got Harry the most expensive pair and Harry was like *nope*
tobi's drip is bomb
Anyone know the intro song as sounds sick also other then that tobi is just a legend man he is just so humble and such an amazing guy
Tobi forgot malicahies shie 😢
I love everything about tobie his personality his beliefs he’s amazing he even asked manny if he wants a pair and he brought his friends shoes
Bro if I had money like Toby  I’m finna buy All the shoes till I got non  Left

Man like Tobi though 🙌🏻 the goat
Thank god illvsn wasn’t called drip trip that is corny asf
🔥🔥🔥
I can't get rid of the fact that the host looks like the UK version of Jason Tatum
ngl if this was complex bet you any money the guest will be spending at least 10 to 20 bags on these shoes alone, complex does daylight robbery for their guests.
Low-key annoying how he acts like he can’t afford all that 10k is nothing to this man
I appreciate tobi for call me drippy by the way my name is Malachi
He didn't get his lil cousins shoes must have been expensive lol.
"nod the camera like yeah" so sweet already in seconds its cute
Rah what is that outro song though.. Pure heat
W
tobi spending 3.3k on some deadout creps , i wudnt cop a single 1 of them apart from the j1 camo mids and even j1s are done now. supreme airforce aint bad but basic af
Such a nice guy Tobi
Tobi who

Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven.
Y Tobi look like a drill rapper in this video 💀
harrys one was a L
Man looks like Jason tatum
Drippiest sidemen

Look at sidemen nose
jayson tatum bro

"People can relate" Does hide in seek in mansions yachts and airplanes
rythem outside

I want too meet Tobi’s parents just to shake their hand on raising such respectful kids
“Sneaker” ?I thought they call it “trainer” something like that.
Mans looks like Jayson Tatum
unarguably the humblest person with muny in the world
whats the blue and orange varisty jacket brand
tobi is a goat
tobis got drip
Love tobi, but these questions seem like they're pulled from 2010... Work a little harder on the questions. Shouldn't be hearing "How much work goes into being a youtuber" in 2022
Yo at first glance I was like Jason Tatum? 😭😭😭
2:44 dude on the left looks like Jayson Tatum
mate dont diss the cyan 700 ligit got them recently and they are fire still
this got the devil's views rn
“1 Peter 4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.”
this is my first kick game and boy does he look like jayson tatum 😂😂😂
song name in the start?
oh so this is what tbjzl does when he's not with the sidemen. what a mysterious guy lol. also so humble!
Jason Tatum rlly fell off
Tobi is a legend so humble but under all that’s such a successful person
«I dont like Jordans» «I really love dunks» They are nearly the same
does anyone know what shoe tobi is wearing
Get tgf bro in there
What a genuine guy !
Tobi's a legend y'know
how tf ksi not on here yet lol
Ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi ksi
why people so crazy about Sneakers , in fact we don't care what Sneakers  you use when we meet
haven't watched the vid yet, hope the british version of complex is actually good
Intro music please 🙏
Black people can only be rich never wealthy it's not in thier mindset anymore
tobi is so humble dude , this guy is a legend 🙏🏻💛🖤💛
Which sideman next 👀👀
I understand now why he got JJ adidas
Don't you think you are giving people in this financial climate the wrong message glamourising getting a really expensive pair of trainers when the cost of living and surviving has gone through the roof
jayson tatum's doppleganger
i fucking love tobi man one of the most genuinely nicest guys on youtube from what i see
Have to get AJ Tracey on it next!
Hi for the next Goes Shopping For Sneakers At Kick Game can you get Humza Productions and tell him to make a video of it please 🙏
What a humble guy imagine having a friend like Tobi damn
600 not well spent, Harry ungrateful fam.
Bruh... the host is way too gassed...
this the type of people that should come into cool kicks and they should say "we got a legend in the building"
dam jayson tatum got a lil side hussle at kick game mad respect 0:58
Tobi is such a good guy he bought his friends all shoes before himself and even got mani a pair when he said he didn’t want nothing
kickgame gotta get someone from top boy like michael ward or sum, shi will go crazy
If i had to choose a best friend from the sidemen, it would 100% be Tobi. 💯💯
Is it just me who thinks this host doesn’t know much 😂
Jj next
Do rest of sidemen pls Ksi or miniminter next
i might need to cop the nike dunk low grey fogs
Anyone know the name of the intro beat/instrumental?

Love Jordan’s.. have a few pairs myself… but the resell is absolutely disgusting
Jayson tatum doing Sneaker shopping but 😭jokes aside tobi wonderful episode the parents defo raised him right and Glory to God for keeping him very VERY humble and leading him to right direction in life
Tobi is so HUMBLE AND GENUINE
tobi such a humble cool as dude. deserves everything that has come his way
They’re called trainers
179.99 for those red Jordan 1s?! There’re In footlocker for 115
Tobi that was genuinely one of the nicest things you could’ve done, but gifting someone a pair of mids is a crime 💀
this guy doesn't stfu let him just get some shoes bruh
My carrier is a downfall just like Toby nose
Tobi's is the humble man in the world I 💜 tobi

I remember I met him a couple years ago at Thorpe Park, he stopped and got a picture with me and I can not imagine a nicer and more humble person to have got a photo with
What language are these two speaking?  It’s certainly not English.  Is this a sketch show, and they’re trying to sound American in an ironic way?

This is what i like about Tobi he's just the perfect person to hang out with and his relationship with others are soo humble and calm
