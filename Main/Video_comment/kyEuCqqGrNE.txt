That red card was way too convenient. Starting to think MANSAARNAULT isn’t crazy after all
How do you let a man jog through the defense like that in a pro game? Watch MANSAARNAULT’s breakdowns. It'll make sense.
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
2:57 😭
😂😂😂
Welcome FC
Bye bye fifa
0:24
The calm before the storm… 😂
Such a good time, farewell Mason.
Lovely
Fifa and their stupid rating. Sterling said himself that Broja is the quickest in the team in a interview with Ian Whright and fifa have faster center backs than Broja in the game.
All the young guys are joking around making fun of each other and the older guys are just in and out
Mason you are funny😊
FOFANA 77 OVR CUCURELLA 87 OVR MOUNT 85 OVR CHALOBAH 79 OVR JAMES 95 OVR😱😱 KOULIBALY 83 OVR MENDY 90 OVR THIAGO SILVA 82 OVR GALLAGHER 88 OVR BROJA 76 OVR
hey mount is 84 rated on my fifa
0:44
HELP MOUNTS POV WAS SO FUNNY
They’re reactions😅
👁️👃🏻👁️
3:05 that angle is just is funny!!!
They did Wes dirty
Mason's camera pov is what it looks like looking at him when you're taller.
bro EA did mount dirty
Has koulibaly the highest rated card in Chelsea?
mount should be 91 minimum he's best prem player in my opinion and in the world right now he quick aswell, absolute class and blues all the way
뭔 리스제임스가 84야 90은 줘야지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
the hell cucurella and chilwel pace under 80
Mason being Mason 😂 love that! 😆
They don't play well on the field and expect their ratings to be good😅
2:57 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Remember when Jose Mourinho say :  "There is campaign against Chelsea".  yup. thats fact man! 😭
Cucurella is mad hilarious 😂😂
People when they realise there’s genuinely nothing intelligent or even competent about EA when it comes to player ratings
This is hands down the best one.
“More slowly than Jorginho” 😂😂😂😂
Fifa doesn't matter boys
Cuccerella is exactLy what I think of when I think Spainish dude
Oof this year Fifa decided to just print some paper instead of the lavish offerings of years gone by  Fofana saying "no respect" - what a hypocrite
Chalobah has to be 81
69 pace for mount????????
mounts my fav player and mendy!
Defending Thiago harusnya 89/90, dia selalu konsisten mainnya & selalu bagus.
Fifa  done them dirdy  fofana,mount,james cucurella,
2:56
Fofana needs to grow up, you’ve played like 5 games ur whole life you don’t even know what being fit means. Why would you be in the 80s?😐 I wish we got tomori back n not this clown
Lovely guys💙
i was so baffled about mount getting a downgrade for a minute 😭😭
Prank Ziyech next time thats gonna be a laugh
MARC CUCURELLA! 😅😅
Who put that camera on Mount's head 😅
"Fernando is faster than you"
How dare they do that to Cucurella
Broja quicker than raheem 🧐
Koulibaly cards is superb beast!
2:57
Nahhhhh that camera angle on mason tho 😂
Is it me or they gave Cucurella Marcos Alonso's card?
That was hilarious 😂
i miss werner
2:57 no bitches?
The ratings is very bad on fifa this season
EA doesn't respect Chelsea
Shame they've done Mace Dirty 😹
Kai doesn't exist in the squad
2:56 XD
2.56 😂😂
Git gud and you won't have to cry about your card
Don Chalobah Toliver
Football is is the best
so cringe
I swear cucurella is 81 in Fifa 23 tho
Mason has 84 this year
2:56
listen I know Chelsea FC is a hedge fund right now but come on can we get more content of the club as a whole?
Fifa 23 ratings are hell
Isn’t mounts card 84 on the game?
fofana laugh on mason pace 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What!!! You didn’t except the Full back passer !?! Pig boy
Lots of high egos for a team that won 0 trophies
Cucurella has only 53 pace.?? Thats a disgrace
Very funny reaction of fofana 😂
LOL
Anyone know kante ratings?
3:06 mood
49 pace is absurd for Thiago. He’s kept up with strikers on the prem the last 3 years
Mason is a clown
Honestly, when I saw Mason Mount Pace, at the beginning, I almost had to cry because of the player's reaction and then to his reaction with joy, the poor boy was almost taken by EA hops. The bad thing is, although I knew that mason is fast, I really fell for this prank and thought, holy s*** mount what did you do wrong 😂🦁
enjoy it lads, coz we ain't gonna see these type of card reveals from next year onwards
Sterling & Aubameyang ?
53 pace left back wil be tough ngl
Cucu, mount is slower than jorgihno
Where Is Hakim Zyech????????
“I’m quicker than Raheem” “you’re probably the quickest in the team” hell let me YouTube this guy 😂
EA sport not support Chelsea. 😪
Mason don't throw the cards away just give them to me.
Mount has to improve game this season, he has not had a good game this season.
marc has 76 pace in game
Impossible impossible 😍🤣😂🤭 Cucu Oh Cucu
As a gunner sadly for Saka and Mount both only get 82
Cucu n mount get fake rating or the other also get fake rating?  I'm so confused with Chelsea rating reveal, vid also short compare to the other team..
KANTEE
KANTEE
did mason just say yes guys
SOLO APARECER EN FIFA YA ES UN GRAN PUNTAJE.
Anyone noticed Mason Mount looking like the rat from ratatouille up here 😂😂🤣
this was so well edited, love the current squad
Wow, giving multi millionaires a free copy of the game, how brave of you
mase at least an 85
Broja 75 ovr I think Broja should have 77 ovr because he have a good season with Southampton and now he plays for chelsi and Albanai
Bro does fifa realize their game is getting binned by so many players and clubs
Don't worry boy's I'll just go in the club setting and raise up your rating like it suppose to be?
Now we need a race between Broja + Raheem with the ball and without the ball
It's great to see that new lads that have come in, mix well with the others
lol no way Trent has a higher overalll than Reece
omg mount so cute
Yeah Chalobah with 47 shooting makes 0 sense
Mount was almost crying
Pace on cucurella is defo fake for sure his in high 80s for sure
what is Zakaria's physical? he is bloody massive, and made mason look so small
LaWes doesn't  rate Koulibaly 😭😭😭
Broja min pac88
Bring the form back from the international break straight into the club performance y'all. Up The Chels.
Mason's face looking into the camera so tight got me to the ground 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣👍🏽
That prank on Mason and Cucurella rating bro. I was already devastated by their previous ratings too.
Gallagher is handsome
The head cam is too much to handle👀👃😂😂😂😂
TS6 deserves a 90 every year.
Dat is disrespectful to mason mount
ผมอยากไปแสตมป์ฟอร์ดบริดสักครั้งในชีวิตครับ อยากไปคอปแฮมด้วย ถ้าได้เป็นคนตัดหญ้าที่คอปแฮมก็คงจะดี😂😂💙💙💙
They did my boy Mount dirty💀
Where is sterling tho
In a funny way but honestly Fifa is telling the truth that our backline was solid along with GK last season so they r above in ratings for most of our attacking players!! But our defence is also in shambles in recent matches 😅😉😋😛😜😝👍💯🙏
Reece James hardly smiles
Best Words from Thiago Silva - " No Respect" ....
how is cucu 53 pace?
Cucurella should be 90 plus hes on fire everytime hes on thr pitch
From his head cam he looks exactly like danny aarons
Yes, all can be better, so be! Come on blues!
Let’s see them perform and do great for better cards next year 🤙🏼🔥🔥
why are they making mason wear that godforsaken head cam
reece james 84 is a disgrace
no way they disrespected cucu
2:57 😂 Mase is so ....🐭💙
RJ simply should ve 80 at every stat Nd this is coming from an Arsenal fan
Mount overrated, fifa is right
that was a fun😅
The must forget about FIFA ratings and start grinding on the pitch  I wanna see that hunger and intensity they had when they won UCL
James 84..arnord 87 common fifa
Chelsea for ever.
co ty peirdolisz
Am I the only one who noticed that Cucurella’s fake stats are exactly the same as Marcos Alonso’s 😂
The Chelsea treatment kn Fifa is absolutely disgusting, I swear down.
I expect a far better card for James next season, it didn't take this long for them to bump up Arnold's card
Watch out from mount
just proves how much of a joke the fifa ratings are
Mason dosent an 82 at least 84
3:06
Whoever told him to have that camera in has done him no favours
Yep cucurella totally has 57 pace. Clowns
Sick camera angles by mount
Chelsea is the best 💙👑
The best team in the world 💙
*EA Sports should start watching football not Soccer ffs.*
This video made me realize just how much mason mount looks like danny Aarons
anything below 86 for Reece is a disgrace
Mason mount is something else 😁😁😁
Where’s pulisic and ziyech 🤔 🐍
Thiago silva is unusable even after being one of the best CB in premier league. “No Respect”
Mason Smilee So Sweett..😂🤗👍🏻Chelse FC.
You guys have the whole season to prove fifa wrong
Its a disgrace how fifa stats is directly proportion to insta followers Its a popularity circle jerk every year
Cucurellas card might be one of the best left back cards ive used at the staft of a fifa!
At fifa dropped the ball on all of the cards this year bro
The camera on Mount's face...lol
Mason is 84😊
That angle of Mase’s face from the top 😂  2:57 😭
Honestly they did Mount dirty cos he had arguably his best season in a Chelsea shirt last season
Mason with his camera he looks so funny
Slower than a walking cone. It's impossible!
Play better this season mase, next season you will get higher than 82. I think FIFA has been very fair in terms of ratings.
look like report card is coming out😂
Such a good prank lmao
I wanted to see kante reaction man
Koulibaly
That's my boy james
The fact 6 foot 3 big man broja is faster than 90 pace 5 foot 7 sterling fills me with such happiness. He should be 92 pace and being 6 foot 3 and having his strength /aerial ability we practically have our own haaland. So happy potter going to give him a chance. He's chelsea through and through supported since day, has aspirations to be one of the best ever and I'm sure he will be💙💙💙
Reminds me of my friends' 12 year-olds
Realistically there should be no footballer that would be rated 49 pace but that's Fifa for you 😂
NO really Cucu was robbed on the pace😂😂
Vast majority of the players in our squad are pretty fast. That's why we are one of the most dangerous teams in the World. The speed of our players help in getting the ball fast to the end of the pitch. We only need to be clinical!
The real question is how slow is Jorgey 😂
where did FIFA get these numbers????
This Rating carts is an absolute joke, have been for years...
They did cucu dirty with that 53 pace at the start bro😅
Mase with his new tatoo
Why does Cucurella have 53 pace? Wtf
2:42 and 2:57 🤣🤣 imma die from laughing rn
I love how chilly there to console everyone😂
Thiago said there was no respect,EA need to pattern up😤
Mase, you're a good boy!! Stay that way and work hard... You'll be at the top don't you worry!
Cucu and Fofana look so happy in the team already. lovely to see
Rj and mount holding hands 😂
u gotta love the mount camera angle 😂
When Thiago said that, it was felt through out the world in every single type of sports, not just football 👀🥶
Chalobah said I'll take what I can get lmao
Jorginho should have Thiago Silva's pace 🤦‍♂
Zakaria comforting Mason 🤣🤣🤣
the mount one 82 one was ok apart from pace, he's generally overrated anyway  Cucurella card was an obvious fake tho
BOEHLY OUT BRING BACK TUCHEL!
Sell Mount
cucu pace 😅
Chelsea players need a reality tv show 🤣 I could watch this for days 😆
Mason doesnt deserve an 84 rating, valverede is the same rating omd🤣🤣
Chilly-“They don’t know about u yet bro” 3:11
Chelsea were done dirty with these ratings man
I love you mount and James and cucurella
No offense but this commercials Mason keeps doing isn't gonna make him focus on his own improvement tbh. We need him to get better and better.
Masons is 84
Koulibaly 82 pace?! 😂 even he couldn’t believe it
cucu's a funny guy. would love to see him and chilly play together
What’s wrong with Mount being 82? I think it’s a fair number. He isn’t really that good as well. Considering his so many misses last season.
Overall: everyone's not happy😭
Blues forever!!!! But seriously Mount deserves higher than 84
Koulidaddyyyyyyyyy
Is it just me, or FIFA literally duplicate ratings every year
bangin angles m8s
Rj card still lower than should be. Best defensive rb in the league for a start. Should have that at least 82/83 shooting should at least be 75. The card should be at least 85/86
Cucurella 😂😂😂
🇸🇳❤️
Cucurela is fast how come he's 79
That camera angle is hilarious 😂🤣
Broja claiming to be the quickest in the team 👀 he is going straight to the top need him starting
Mason's Club World Cup Vlog face is backkkk!!! 🔵🤣
Cucurella pace 53...wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best team chemistry in the Prem. Hands down.
😂
please add Japanese or English translation😢
How did mount go down in rating? He did so many goals and assists
86 Thiago Silva is a joke. Should be atleast a 89
what an absolutely golden camera angle 😂
lmao mason is pissed at his card 😂 good thing it was a fake lol
Cucurella 😂
'I'm slower than Jorginho !!!'     Brutal fake card.   😂
Tomorrow chelsea VS París Saint Germain
I can't stopping laughing 😂😂
😂💙
Expecting these ratings to increase yhis season especially Jorginho and off course Mason Mount
Mount looks so funny his head go pro view haha
"yes guys"? George Benson Football Channel?
Love cucu’s reaction in the end😂
Taking the piss out of mount’s fake card💔🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
FIFA is disgusting
I did not know broja spoke like that 🤣🤣🤣
Love is world Lol nice good boss
Wait until they see their game face.  They’ll be even more furious lol  Broja, Gallagher look absolutely HORRENDOUS
Put some respect on trevohs shooting!
Cucu rating is shitty
The mason camera is hilarious tbh
Nah they did Silva dirty ☠️
That's why football manager better than fifa... Ngl
I wanted to see kepa react to his card 🤣🤣🤣🤣
70 rating for shoot Reece is terrible
Dennis needs some game time
Thiago needs 55 pace minimum, and should have high passing and headers. Mount needs 72 pace minimum.
Mount throwing his card away again, love it🤣
Its funny how everybody is just like us laughing on that 69 pace joke
Thiago Simply saying "no respect" made my day
No player is slower than jorginho !!
GET OUT MOUNT OF MY CLUB
How the hell is cucurella 50+ pace
"I'm slower than Jorginho!!" 😂😂😂
Cucurella 53 pace? Wtf.
Thiago Silva cold af
We need more content of them together 😭 I want to see the interaction of our players...I don't why but they're so cute together...with Mount , Zakaria , Fofana , Gallagher , Koulibaly , Cucu , Chilwell , Silva , James and Broja
Cucurella with a 50something pace is just criminal
Ilove you all when laug
Fofana and Cucurella 🤣🤣 FIFA is as disrespectful af
The fact that cucu is slower than jorgi💀💀😭😭😭
Cucu is an all-round nice guy just like Azpi same kind of vibes he gives me
For those who complain that Mount is 82-rated, I bet you did not finish watching the full video! 🤣
Chelsea players are way too underaterd in FIFA and it should be fixed up
Ea honestly hate chelsea all of them deserve upgrades other than Jorginho 😂
the real place of the Fifa, the trash
Mason is the heartbeat of the team, so charismatic in his own way. He's in all the media content and his teammates speak freely with him. Future captain in a season or 2.
LISTEN GUYS MOST  IMPORTANT CHEMISTRY 🧪🧪🧪 BETWEEN US AND GOOD TACTIC CHËALSËA HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY . WE DO NOT NEED ALL PLAYERS HIGH PACE OR ALL HIGH PHYSIQUE OR HIGH SHOT ,FOR EXAMPLE CHALOBAH SCORING LOT OF ⚽⚽⚽SHOT THIS IS REVIEW TACTIC.FOR ME IM VERY HAPPY  FOR THIS RATING.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This is like when students got their Final Exam grade back
Reece should be around 88-90 honestly, might be 84 because of that injury i guess
cucurella isnt 79
Stop complaining work hard
i have mount in my team and he is actually good
"I think I've gone down from last season!" - You have mate..
Reece James and Alexander Arnold both have 80 defending, this automatically voids all fifa ratings.
Cucurella pace is hilarious...
EA absolute shambles every single year unless its Kante or Werner
Anyone knows what Cucu's saying in the early parts of the vid?
Mason's voice: Look at the state of my card 🤣🤣🤣
The disrespect to Thiago is unreal  He never gets credits from anyone asides chelsea fans
That’s mad disrespectful
Yaaar I love the camera 📷 mason 😂🤣🤣💙💙💙💙
And we spent 50 mil on cucurella.....
Mason mount deserves a 84 Tbf he’s great
I have Mason Mount's card he's 84?
Honestly ea take the piss when it comes to Chelsea players !! They need a slap 👋
Where is Wesley’s new card
in love with Mason 😭💙
They say Broja probably the quickest in the team? 👀 Damn  strength, pace and shooting Potential through the roof
They played with there Psychology if you know you know 🙂
chilly offering mase a hug 💙 underated friendship
Finished team
whats that camera on mount doing?
Good stuff
I love Mason Mount so much.🤗🥰😇😊😍💙💙💙💙💙💙🥰🥰💙💪🏻👍
2:57 funny 😂😂
James should be higher than 84
From SENEGAL 💯🤞🏿🇸🇳😻🤝🏿😍🔮📣🇸🇳🇸🇳
I was waiting for them to say Mason’s was fake, there was no way 😂
So happy for Kalidou ❤
I’m a city fan and mason mount is funny as hell
This team is so likeable so many good characters
Broja quicker than Raheem?
Broja is quicker than Raheem
Mason ..what a lovely lad he is
Masons ratings are a joke let’s be honest
almost like a school report card😂
How is mount an 82
Chilly telling broja “they don’t know about you yet bro” him and auba gonna light it up up top 🔥
Chalobahs reaction though
mount should be over the moon with 84 and happy with 82
Aside from the "fake" cards I still think EA did a lot of them dirty with their Pace ratings. They aren't that slow at all. In fact many of the PL players should have like at least 72 or smth base pace the league is fast gdammit.
Shambles from EA 😂
I love the yearly joke of Mount throwing his card in the bin🤣
Mount doesn’t look happy with the results at all.  I believe he’s going to do better this season. Rooting for him! ✊🏾🥳💙
How is mount pace only 69 Ea come on
💙
Chilly ofc Ur card going be same like last season u have being injured whole season 😂
Raheem got 86 after having a better season than the one he got boosted to 88. Ea hates Chelsea.
The fact that everyone said Broja is faster than Raheem, and probably is the fastest in general out of everyone at Chelsea, and he still got 76 pace.. EA sort your stuff out I beg
Not sure how much longer that rating for Koulibaly will last, he's playing like Maguire
82 coming off his best season. Taking the piss
Mason was done bad
Kante walks in: y'all are trash lol
Cucu must 83 ,Fofana 81
Jorgi 85 ? more like a 75 with Talking: 100
🤣👏🏾
Mason throwing his card every year 😂😂😂
Wish this was a bit longer 🤩
Quality content 🤣💙
Lads having fun with their ratings 😁 Aim to get more at the end of the season 👊💙
For a second I thought they were real
How did they make make cucurela that slow
Jorginho is using black magic to stay at Chelsea
I have bought this game every year since 2001, been playing it consistently but some how this is the only year I can't seem to be interested in playing or even buying it. I was sent a demo for it earlier and didn't even try it once. This right here been done to CFC players makes that decision even much easier. Rudi was 83 rated last season when he was killing it with CFC, some how he transfers to Real and in two or three months they give him an 87 rating. Makes no sense at all.
The mount cam🤣🤣
Cucu's pace being 53 is a joke ffs lol
Mason is full of shithousery energy 🤣
Chelsea is so underrated
Loved this video 😻
We just signed nkunku another average player. Man city still has halaand and they are better than us for yet another season 🤦🏽‍♂️
we need more of this mason angle
Mount and cucererellas cards weren’t right
Cucu and Wes seems so integrated to the squad, lovely to see that
I love you chalsea🥰🥰
It's like receiving the Progress Card/ Mark sheet from school; Comparing the marks with the friends 😅
That mase face is absolutely outrageous
Nah the vibes are just😩😩😩
When Thiago says "No Respect", you better tighten up FIFA.
landed in the trash again😂❤
Fifa be violating Chelsea for real
Mason head camera😂😂😂
😂 I loved it
I love our club so much
I love Maison
How tf reece james shooting is 70? Fifa smoking crack
This video gonna be viral for sure
Like this tweet if Chelsea beats Palace tomorrow
Let's see all these ratings increase over the season 🔥
Chelsea beating Palace tomorrow fasho!
I like it when mason smiles 🐱
