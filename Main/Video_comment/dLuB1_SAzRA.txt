8:23 OH MY… THAT LOOK WHEN THEY STOOD UP😭😭
8:44 CHRISSSSSSS
<3
While I find it so weird when people feel .... Personally hurt by, and take sides in "celebrity" (using that term loosely) breakups... I get the energy kinda, seeing them vibe off each other again and not hiding their feelings like they did while in the relationship is dope.
OMG I didn't expect Ian to break down for a moment there 6:36, it caught me off guard and it broke my heart. I hope you both heal and bloom more than ever in doing so. You guys were seriously goals for me but even then it proves, as Chris said, relationships are very complicated in general and take a lot of work. Still, I strive to be what they had on camera, and I hope I have the strength and patience to put in the required effort to make that happen ❤
The Mrs. Doubtfire reference was awesome!
I can't tell how many times I've watched and just want to hug ian ❤
This is purely a commercial conversation - buy the stuff which the company is paying us to appear here. They are good salesmen advertising the product and brand.
haha love you Ian but no tears were shed but all emotion hahaha slay
They both unfollowed each on the instagram… I wonder….
This absolutely broke my f**kin heart man! However no one knows what went on with this relationship. Or why it ended. They both obviously miss the hell out of eachother. The love is so obvious that it's making me nauseous 😊. I hope and wish for the best for both of them. They are both awesome individuals. Love them both to pieces❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Shit I just found out, being gay sucks love never last, I will die alone.
I could never ever set this close with ex omg
Not a fan of tiktok but gave it a try during pandemic. I found them and enjoyed their videos together. I stopped using tiktok for a year then decided to open my account now. I searched for their accounts only to find out that they broken up🥺 wish them all the best❤
This was heartbreaking. 😭❤️
It is not appropriate for men to wear makeup! Women have worked to hard to have men take over something that is OURS!
Ian just made me burst into tears…I so recognize that guy. ❤
Why they broke up. I mean they are so perfect together.
Monetize that breakup!!
Aw I’m sad I didn’t want the video the end
if passive agressive was avideo
I am a child of divorce
You can definitely see in Ian’s eyes that he still loves Chris deeply. I could also see it at the end when they did the handshake, Ian was the last to let go, almost as if he didn’t want to. Also why do I feel like Ian probably cried hard in the car after this video?
Fear of losing someone will def make you lose them. Happened to me 🤪
I think this goes to show how much we can never truly know content creators despite everything they put on the internet. That being that, I'm glad this "reunion" was public, bringing some closure to us fans too
This was beautiful.
These kind of morons are a mockery of people. This is not "gay" people. I have partner and we are guys and this is mockery of normal people. Just to know, this is not gay normal relationship what happens on social media around world
Coming back to this after the back and forth of the pair online in recent months. The tiktok filters they post that mention the other, the comments, the lot of. I personally would not be surprised if they are together but keeping it under wraps. This story isn’t over. Far from it. If anything I think it’s barely began. Chris and Ian are meant to be. You can tell from the interaction in here. The way they subconsciously lean into one another. It’s a form of safety.
Chris! You've grown so much. It was beautiful to watch you be strong for both you and Ian. I know you were ready to/wanted to hug Ian and be there for him. Its lovely to know Ian appreciates the memories they share! ❤
I didn’t expect he will cray
When I tell you I broke down once Ian did 😭
Geeezus Come on people, it is so sweet we know that we can admire and appreciate some people so deeply, but they have nothing to do with us, Let them lives their lives, they partly broke up because they could not even figure out their depth with the immense influence of being seen by the public at every single second. Our society is so deeply in such a mess to be that vastly enmeshed with their existence. 😅
it’s just interesting and almost beautiful to see how much they learned about themselves through their break-up. It’s just a reminder of how much pain is necessary for our own growth
This was so beautiful to watch
I love how he says Christopher ❤
i need him
when ian started crying.. gurl...
GASP
I love them together 😭❤️
I’m ready to be adopted , I’m 38 and ready !!! Just so ready!! 😊
i wanna see the uncut SO BADLY
Why is this only 10 mins long?
They definitely had ro break up... Sometimes you can't be the hero of the one your love....  Glad they had this close up
What happened to them? They were so good 😢
It’s so important to see communication, vulnerability, and laughter in any relationship. 💕 great to see growth in them
This is how you do marketing
Ah when you move in with someone after just a few months
So ian dumped him cuz he thought he could do better, got flack online cuz we all saw how broken chris was, now ian gets emotional??? Gurl... either its to help his brand or he genuinely knew he messed up big.  Glad Chris didnt cave.
at first i was getting annoyed because i thought ian was being dismissive. my view immediately changed when he started crying, you can see him trying to put on a strong face. i hope they are both doing well
Was I the only one that didn’t know they were together?!
This is so tender ❤
Wow these are such beautiful humans. ❤
I want them to get back together you can tell they still love each other.
I immedietely start thinking whether they have anxious and avoidant attachment styles, I can definitely relate to what they went through!
Chris has a really beautiful eye smile 🥹
Its always so interesting how we as gay men inter-personalize so much of ourselves just to be in a relationship sometimes. And only after it was over and some time has passed do we start to feel the emotions that we suppressed for each other. Ian is such a kind soul and sweetheart at his most foundational level and just wanted intimacy in the relationship .Chris was and is not really concerned with that at all, and is in his focused determined time of his life. Chris saw ian as a handsome sexy older guy who he would look good with, and then he realized he liked ian , and loved him, and that terrified him! You can tell they still love each other, but in very different ways. Wish them both the best!
I’ve lost count of how many times I watched this.
It'll be okay boys. You're meant to be in each other's lives, just not in the way you thought.
the “*gasp* christopher!!” actually killed me i havent heard that from ian in so long i got strong flashbacks 🥺
Im crying
Lots of 🚩🚩🚩 on here
How did Youtube know I use e.l.f..... and that I'm an emotional gay?!
Feelings are definitely still there but sometimes the right person wrong time
Good guys!
I’M NOT CRYING, YOU’RE CRYING!! 😭😭😭
I avoided this for as long as I could but it kept popping up because I was a fan (when they were together) and then curiosity got the better of me. I just knew (from personal experience) it was going to be heartbreaking and when Ian broke... I broke. Had I been there I would have pushed Chris off that stool/chair thing and hugged Ian and given more support than Chris did. Am not crazy but even though Chris was like are you ok, he just stared... almost void of feelings... I am no psychologist but Chris gave me narcissist energy. I could be wrong but like the Man is telling you he missed that and the whole time you can tell Ian was taking in all of Chris with his eyes and Chris just stared. Like Hello, comfort Ian, if he meant anything to you once. I don't know, maybe I should have never watched this. I don't even comment on any videos ever.... I guess I can relate to Ian.... the crazy part is that a Chris in my life also broke my heart ~sigh~     I wouldn't have the balls to talk to my EX, especially because my love is infinite and the mere sight of my ex would have straight up destroyed me. Yea, this is the last time I stay up till 4am scrolling on youtube.
I'm sorry but lets be real. Ian made Chris famous, and buddy decided to ditch em lmfao. Fame and money and the internet. Like even this display here ... trash
just seeing the dynamic between them with each other being so healed and so forgiving and so improved, this reassured me so much about how people can grow. I'm so glad to see them so genuinely grown, this warms my heart.
I’m reloading the page…but it seems like it stops at 9 minutes 😢😢😢 where is the rest of it e.l.f.?
🙄
Oh Jesus I thought the crying was a joke at first because he went straight into it from the French impressions
This was so sad to watch!!! ;_;
These two clearly still have a lot of love for each other. The first long relationship always is the hardest to get over
I loved them as a couple and the way they handled their breakup in the public eye.
Wow this is a good concept and love the transparency after their breakup, I actually hope they stay being friends because it’s possible cuz I’ve been through this and my relationship as a friend now is better than being in the relationship. We’re healed ❤
I don't that these two ever suited each other ... before anyone thinks I am being horrible ...  Ian is a different guy he needs someone stronger and someone that can give him space at the same time ... Chris is emotional and needs to be reassured .. (he needs to be with an older man). Chris will never be over this ... he will always reflect back on this relationship ... the only way I Chris can move beyond this is a lot of time .. be single for a while and then date an older man that can him a bit of direction in life ...
I thought Ian moved from Chris so quick. Seeing this video puts a whole different light on him.
Chris grew so much
I can still feel the love but I also feel that feeling of not needing to reconnect.
I hope they went and made love again
This pair makes me ashamed of being a homosexual.
Ian being vulnerable and Chris holding himself together 🥹🥹 i love them so much this was a beautiful moment 💞
Aw iannnn, I relate to him
my parents 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Still waiting on them 😢 0:20
I love them both ❤. They’re so comfortable with each other. I’m still holding a torch for them to get back together someday. But if it’s not meant to be, still love them both.
late to the news here, so why did they break up?
Not me balling🥲
Careful Christopher… I’ve got utensils in my hands … 💀🤣🤣🤣🙌🏻
♥♥♥
Their love is so strong! It comes through the screen. I felt it. ❤
Really hoping they would get back together.
This was a relationship I and everyone never wanted to end but I feel like it made them grow and make them mature I’m glad they had this chance to express themselves and let some tears out nice work e.l.f🥹❤
I love them both
This video let me see for the first time that Chris doesn’t deserve Ian. Even in this moment of vulnerability, he never gave Ian the appropriate appreciation and respect.
YALL ZOOM OUT WHY ARE YOU SO UP CLOSE
This was beautiful to watch. I wish both of them the very best and hope they are happy!
I feel like this is too intimate for a stranger like me to watch but as someone who really loved your relationship when you were together, this brought me comfort to see you two talk and just reminisce about the past together. I hope you two heal well and be happier than ever, whether together or by your separate ways. Thank you for this!
Why am I crying? <3
I love you both!
3:32 I miss the high pitch "Christopher!"
The “Christopher” 😭
I'm crying felt sincerity as well happy for both of them ❤
I need more of them.
It appears as if the roles are reversed. Dont it always seem to go that you dont know what you have till its gone
Ian cried and I started sobbing I was not expecting this
😭😭😭😭
Looks like ian gained some weight. Good for him
Yeah no I'M NOT OKAY
I'm so proud of chris. both of them mean the world and I hope things are swell
I don't know why I cried....
I'm not okay after watching this 😢
this was such a beautiful conversation for them to have and experience and i hope that it was healing for them and that they could feel how much they care about each other. i hope they are at peace with the decision to post this online, it’s incredibly brave and vulnerable of them, and it’s a privilege to witness <3
i already know they fucked after this
they made me feel like redirection is light, freeing and healthy 🥰
cutest couple
How am I going to see Drew’s grandma died and then see this?! What’s next?
How I would LOVE to have this coco with my ex! Tell him I’m grateful for him and our experience together! No hard feelings left whatsoever! Hope he feels the same!
think the take away from this lesson is that men are still learning too ladies... they're not as tough as society paints them to be and need as much emotional support as we do.
I really hope they spoke more in depth after this, thanks Elf Cosmetics ❤❤❤
All the movie/musical references haha
Ahh! I love the Aida reference Ian! Miss you two
Sooooooo much passive aggressiveness....
“Christopher”🥹
Elf is unhinged
"The internet thought they had a perfect relationship" - because they made sure the internet thought they had a perfect relationship - that's what made the big dollars.
Where’s the rest… we need the whole thing!
oh my god this was deep
It's uncomfortable to see such private moments between them made public. I wish them both much happiness in the future.
I found them annoying but this….omg😭❤️
What i get from this, is that ian got hurt, and he still is, but learned to get respect for himself...while chris is full of himself with his teasing tongue
I wouldnt be shocked if they decide to give it another chance.
I don’t have a clue who these people are but Ian is definitely not finished with this relationship…..
These two are literally strangers to me and yet I was SO HEARTBROKEN when I found out about their breakup.  I was nervous to watch this video because of their impact on me, and I could feel the tension despite their smiles.  Once Ian started crying, I cried with him.  I miss them together, but I’m happy that they seem happier 🥺
make some more money off the relationship why don't you? Are you guys coming out with a new "my ex" clothing line next month? jesus christ. Doesnt the internet not understand that some shit is meant to be private and people can mind their own damn business. Stop normalizing monetizing and posting every moment of your life.
Chris is a groupie, I mean what does he do for a job other than being Meghan's trainer bff.
not ELF cosmetics getting their check lol
CRYIN in the club rn
I’m honestly so so proud of both of them! The growth on their individual journey is beautiful. And I am so happy and proud to see Chris’s aura like this; strength in vulnerability and assertiveness of knowing your feelings. ❤
They’re very mature, for Ian to open up in that way and Chris being understanding even when he can’t reciprocate in the same way.
Its also so unfortunate that while they were a public relationship, people gave ian such a hard time on the internet because of their favoritism towards chris and i doubt that made things easier in his healing journey.
It's so sad when muscular cis white youthful gay guys who conform to Western beauty standards and make massive amounts of money off of their looks and publicizing their private lives for profit are in pain.
I AM A CHILD OF DIVORCE
So what’s the tea, someone cheated? The sexual tension was still there I could feel it.
release the unedited cut!!
Just move on! Dnt be that weak. Move on.
Chris sounds like Anthony padilla
9 min seriously? This should go for at least 9hrs.
What a heartfelt moment.
We often date who we are, a very hard lesson that was for me.
#17May2023
Who are these guys?
Who are these guys?
I Chris & Ian work on themselves and find their way back to each other. Ian is still not over Chris, I can tell.
I literally have no idea who these people are lol and I feel like I’m pretty on the social media lol 😅
Ian doing the accent when he's nervous brought me back. I'm so happy for them to have this dialogue. Brave to do it online. They're both beautiful humans with a strong  connection. Onions anyone?
😢❤
I love that they’re able to sit down and communicate with one another now it truly shows growth from each side. It might be too late for Joey and Daniel but I think Ian and Chris just need to grow on their own and come back to each other in the future when they’ve worked on whatever it is they both needed to work on. There’s still hope for them romantically speaking. You don’t just share your entire relationship with the world and not have that desire still to get back together. I believe that’s why Ian broke down and started crying. Because he misses what they had but wishes that they could’ve been at a better place mentally. I have faith in these two and I truly believe they’ll figure it out. Much love Ian and Chris ❤ I love you both so very much and I’m beyond proud of the progress you’ve both made.
Who the hell are these people
This is so performative, it’s crazy!  Come on internet. Don’t eat this up
So many feelings 😢❤
Money.
Am I the only one thinking this is weird? Like it’s an ad. An actual ad with two real people promoting makeup while dealing with their past relationship. Love them, I’m not trashing them nor their intentions, I’m just kinda weirded out by the format.
So they aren’t being shady?💀
Was this their first time seeing each other since the break up?
Oop, lemme give y’all space. This a lot for me too 😢
You can’t possibly put this out, lasting 9 minutes and not expect the public to revolt!!!! We need MOREEEEEEE
Ian still loves him deeply! 🥹
Chris eyes....tearing throughout the  video
These two were total clout chasers. I never understood it. Chris really doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He speaks like he understands, but it’s not convincing. Chris is just plain toxic and doesn’t need a platform where he can pretend to be happy when all he needs to do is work on himself. Maybe he should try to talk to a therapist and not always put the sessions on the internet.
Loved them as a couple.. and this is such a beautiful moment of them ..
More people should do this. It is so helpful for both parties and a great way to clear the air, get some closure, and preserve valuable friendships. Kudos!
You can see Ian just shut down when Chris said “IF I were to get into another relationship” they both don’t want to think about the other with another. 🥺
Am I the only one who’s looking around wondering “who are these guys?”.
Ian quoting Mrs Doubtfire made my day and I can't tell if Chris got it
Healthy post-breakup conversations are pretty rare on the internet; most people/channels try to capitalize on the drama aspect, especially with public figures. This was so sweet and lovely to see... and I mightve shed a small tear when Ian became emotional😅
I've missed them so much 💓  I hope this was a good for them
Positivity!
🥹❤️
In my mind they are still together even though they did what was best for them.
Okay but the tension when they stand up together ????? 8:20 they still care so much for one another
Omg, I thought Chris would have cried 1st..I miss them sooo much..I hope they reconnect again and give it another go
Gosh they were brave.  I was married for 30 yrs 4 kids no way I could sit opposite my ex for a public open conversation like this.  Emotional, moving just great.
okay but why was the camera man all up in their faces..😭
@6:24  It really is those stupid little memories that mean the most after all. Catch us by surprise that given day, making us smile in its purity then. Those serendipitous moments that only happened at that moment and will never happen again. The cosmos aligned that evening and will live on only by us reminiscing forever. It is now our history, it is now our being. How do I know? Well look at us now talking about those stupid little memories. Seemed so stupid and little then but really not so stupid or little after all  ❤ Cheers to all the broken hearts out there that are yet to fully heal ❤
This made me cry more than hearing the news they broke up
Could have watch this for hours. Love you guys
Wait i thought they were going to actually makeup
Awww 😢
Book them again pleaseeeeeeee
I’m cryingggggggggg
you can see side of Chris so mature. so gladly he move on
I'm literally dying, 9 minutes of this wasn't enough for me. I need a 1 hour minimum goodbye video lol. Love them so much, they deserve so much happiness!
9 minutes is too short for me to see them again together. 😢
I love you Ian 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you Ian 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where’s the unedited version? 9min was NOT enough 😭😭😭😭😭
I can just tell Chris doesn’t seem to care AS much or may have loved as much as Ian 😭
Ick
They’ll get back together but off the internet
Dull and overacted
that was deep - clearly cris broke up with ian
Iaaaaaannnnn😟😟😟😟😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
We love you guys which ever way you go (together or apart). You are both so sweet.
9 minutes of this is just ain’t enough. 💔
The over pronunciation of there words….
I can't see Chris the same after seeing his nude 🔥🔥
This video helped me so much. I broke up w my bf of 10 years this year and I’m still figuring things out. Seeing these two interact this way with so much love and respect really helped me
The moment I saw this I knew that the guy in pink is still not over the relationship. He didn't need to do this. He still needs some time and space from his ex. This was not enjoyable knowing that one person was suffering way more than the other. He was in a hurry to get away. The one in the white t-shirt seems to be enjoying himself and the one in the pink outfit is still hung up.
Get Justin and Selena together for the next sesh!
How can you do this to us E.L.F ?!! This is painful and heartwarming at the same time. I really hope they get back together. They deserve that second chance.
I thought they would be a bit more specific about why they broke up lol.
Where are they famous?
I don't want them to hurt if this is how it makes them feel. But I would love to watch as a subscriber for more. A genuine watch into two people who cared for each other.
"And look at the sun. It has set." I see what you did there Chris.
love Ian's outfit
I think this was a classic case of at the beginning Ian did his girl boss moment while Chris went through the emotions, and now Ian is but Chris is over that hump while Ian has just now touched it, like when Ian was crying and Chris just sat their looking statuesque.
Awww it’s nice to see them together in one screen again.
Why isn't this for an hour?
This kind of hurt my heart a little 😢 I love you both though! ❤
i love them so bad
Ian is so beautiful.
Wtf Chris you hate coconut and you Filipino 🤔
Ian is so fine
why am i sobbing
I am still confused. So the internet broke up this couple or was it because Chris started to become insecure and Ian just had a hard time opening up or all of the above?  Also, if they both still feel this strongly why not get back together? Couples learn from their mistakes. It sounds like this one did.
i did not saw a single tear drop coming out of ian ugh i can't stop laughing.
The world is healing 😢
I'm smiling and crying at the same time. wtf! I miss them together and I'm so happy to see them grow each on their own from their relationship.
Joey and Daniel then Chris and Ian. I will give up on love if anything happens to Nikki and Pierre!!
I hope they are back together
love them together, even as close friends ♥
This is crazy to watch
genuinely asking, did they ever say the reason why they broke up?
So glad Ian finally got away from that gross toxic community hole bottom ❤❤❤
omg this is so intense and awkward
Two,very different people on different paths. I feel like Ian was anxious. Wish them I the the best. Great Men.
the way i see it guy on the left still cares. one on the right is way over it and is hooking up like crazy.
okay now do ethan and trisha
The closure I never thought I needed ….❤🥹
I need a 3 hour version of this
I did not expect this to make me cry omg 🥹😭🥲
i miss them so much omggg
I thought it was a getting back together video. 🥲
Awee this is cute of them reconnecting   Did my Chris post something of having clamidia So he’s been out there doing things but who knows
Love them both so much! Their videos helped so many people through Covid times! I know they brightened up my days! Loved this video and I hope they are both doing great!
I don’t see no tears but okay lol
I genuinely had a hard time watching them interact again 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔because they have always complimented each other so well and I omg 💖💖💖💖💖💔💔💔💔🥹🥹🥹it literally just reintroduced those feelings, when your use seeing people together and then they break up suddenly or just it didn’t work out? It’s crazy because u live vicariously through them sometimes because it gives you hope , at least I did and they made you feel like you could meet someone just as special when they had eachother. I’ve only had the one bf in my life but I still know what that feels like and it’s fucking painful 😓 when the  most important person in your life moves on and your just left wondering well shit wtf do I do now? How do you function? pick up the pieces and move on with your life to? I legit lost it when Ian started crying 😭 💔💔💔because you could just tell there were still genuine feelings of love towards Christopher. But you know overall, at the end of the day my thing is I had to tell myself to mentally let him go, and I did but I’ll always have love ❤️ for him. I love 💖u Ian and Christopher, I wish them both nothing but love 💖💖💖💖and finding their happiness
I hate that this is a sponsored tender moment but.... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
That’s what we need a closure
❤️
omg no one cares.
Never thought 9mins wouldn't be that enough in my whole entire life 😌
When he started crying … I started CRYING 😭 and had to STOP the video… 😢💔💔💔
Omg so sweet but sad… this reminds me of a quote “we were meant to be but just not meant to last”
I want the long form version! This is so tough but thank you for making this!
I did not expect to cry here 🥺
I BAWLED watching Ian cry. I do not ship celebrity normally, and yes was surprised when they broke up. But this was beautiful to watch and thank you so much for sharing.
I love these two, and I love LOVE how Ian says Christopher!!🥹❤️
There’s no way I don’t rewatch and cry to this over and over
mmmmmyeah i want them back together
Y’all so messy.. I would have never done this 0:32
the look in Ian's eyes when he could feel the tears coming 😭😭😭
who are these people and why do we care?
They clearly have a love for each other! Ian definitely misses him. Ugh !  Boys just get back together already!
Ian seems like a beautiful person.
I’m not crying your crying 😭 😭 wow I got real emotional from this
unrelated but their skin look so good! drop the routines boys
Omg please get back together!!!   🥹
Incredibly underwhelming!
yesssss love seeing Ex's / Friends getting a bag together....
This was SO lovely ❤️
👀 at 8:42. We know Ian misses that ass.
You could tell Chris was too childish for Ian, I mean the content after they broke up was rough...
Stop watching this video hurt me so deeply 😭 there's just so many deep emotions they have for each other and you could tell from the first moment that Ian walked in the room
I cringed several times at Ian's comments about being controlling in the beginning but as the interaction went on, I also eased into it and now I miss them. This defo ain't over, MARK! MY! WORDS! people.
The growth. Damn
Wow elf!! Giving us what we wanted!!
I don't get Chris here. Looks controlled, but I feel tension all over. Weird
ive never seen such a superficial relationship before. i pray these two find healing in therapy and stop being so performative...
Okay this was very hard to watch
Wow, it was hard to watch. Harder than I expected. I could feel the tension and all the emotions between them, the eye contact was intense. Heartbreaking to see Ian cry but I feel like both of them needed this moment. Hope they have a great future. 💝
is it because both of them are B 🙌🏻
This is how brand deals should go, absolutely none of this felt forced or cringy. Perfect amount of content from influencer to brand. Loved watched and listening all of the content presented. Plus I love elf and use that mascara daily ☺️
I missed them together
I just have to say love and respect to this beauties thank you for the video🥰💋💋💋💋
Literally reminds me of my ex and I. What’s worse is that we still lived together. For reasons we moved together but this time we were in separate rooms and wanted to move in with friends. It was very hard but at the same time we still had that time to grow and heal with each other. We both understood it was for the best and he is still now one of my best friends in the whole world and I truly believe we were mean to be each others person but just not as boyfriends. And now we have this wonderful friendship that’s filled with so much connection and love and I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.
I loved them as a couple, but I love that they can be mature enough to be in the same room with each other and talk even more.
I feel like all the social media couples (gay) that blow up kinda end in the end. Toddrick and Myles, Chris and Ian, Mark and Ethan, Charlie and RJ King. Sad to see them all split.
This really has fed my soul. Both are some amazing people setting a beautiful example of what it is to truly love someone enough to let them go- and still continue to genuinely care for them. I needed this. We all need this. ❤️
I feel like Chris healed. He was the one that was hurting in the relationship and Ian realized what he lacked and hasn’t healed for how he may of been to Chris.  I could of watched them for 6hrs
Thank you for the realness
Ugh, too vague😟
Stop trying to put them back together lol they clearly still have tension, and not the sexual kind
This was so lovely to see. Especially because as I navigate a breakup myself I find a lot of the queer community applies pressure with the "get over someone by getting under someone" mentality and it is really nice to see that Ian's process post break up is similar to my own with not being ready to date and being transparent about that
Ik for a fact that Chris went home after and cried over Ian, I MISS THEM
They got back together when Steve opened the sticky primer and thought of Adam
what does this have to do with elf... cash grab
This is f*cking insane to post. You’re literally allowed to keep things for yourself
This is so sweet and incredible
No I wasn’t ready 😢
That's akward
omg????
crying sobbing throwing up
This is really sad.  I feel like they couldn’t say everything cause this was a public “private” conversation.  It’s was a small resolution for them and very small one for us. 😭
I don’t know why I’m crying, but I just feel like there is still love, but their relationship already ended. Nway, we’ll never know what comes in their future.   I like how Chris looks at Ian when he’s crying, and how Chris said, it looks great. How reassuring. 🥺  Hugs and kisses for both. 🥺❤️
I’m 1 min 36sec in and my hard is already gushing. 1:36
Was that really it?  I needed more. The shortest makeup conversation of all time lol
No amount of e.l.f. money could get me to do this lol
You could tell that they still love each other a lot but they know they're not good together in a relationship and that's growth.
Not me coming here for closure and crying about wanting them back together 😭😭
CRYING. TEARING. SOBBING.
as a child this divorce, im SO CONFUSED
You guys know that this was... acting right? lol
this was traumatic for them....
ian started crying therefore i started crying
I wish this video is longer than it is… I can spend a day watching and listening to them… ❤️
stooop 😭 I’m not crying, I’m not crying… I got this 😅 (sigh I love them both - just wish them the best! and it seems like they can still be friends which is nice)
They are so much stronger then I am… I could never so this
I hate that they need to be cameras recording for them to talk and have interactions. I want them to be healthy towards each other without the internet toxicity and me commenting about this. There is a beautiful connection, they probably know each other better than anyone else. This is why I’d want couples to be as private and exclusive as possible dude. But I get why they need to do it this way now. I honestly do. They started something together. I just want to say that they don’t owe us anything. Nothing at all.
❤❤❤
They made quarantine entertaining
Oh my god please get back together
The connection is still there and you can tell the love they harbor for each other. Their love just looks different now and is in the form of occasional contact. Whatever happens happens and I wish them the best whether together or separate!
You can tell there is still loooooots of love there. Especially on Ians side. But you can also tell that he’s trying to get Chris to acknowledge the private moments and to me it feels like that him trying to remind himself of why they’re separated. Ian seems to crave that deep, private connection and Chris seems much more caught up in how it was viewed by others/what he’s doing when a camera is on him. Chris is a whole celebrity now, and I think it was him becoming absorbed by that that broke them up. You can tell he’s very guarded with Ian, still protecting himself.  It’s interesting to me that everyone is commenting about how much they love eachother but I already really see that there’s a tension there and they’re both holding back parts. Ians trying to draw Chris in and Chris is trying to draw attention to himself. I love Chris, but he’s definitely in a generation of people who are much more self absorbed and looking for external validation than Ians generation, and it’s really obvious here
I wish they could just given in work on their friendship and see what happens
Ian is so gorgeous ☺️
This made me so emotional. Love them both and their life journey. Their chemistry is so strong.
This felt so awkward until Ian started to cry. That’s when it felt real if that makes any sense. But totally can relate to this. Makes me cry 😭
when he started crying holy shit
"thats not fair" AH
Ian talking about how he wonders if Chris ever thinks about the good memories and how it brings him comfort in those hard times made me cryyyyy because that’s how I feel and I wish I knew if my ex did that too.
You can feel the tension at the beginning. LAWD. I never want a public relationship 😂
Full footage please
I miss them being together so much😭😭😭
The love they truly still have for each other.
Their relationship ended on a toxic note. There is not coming back from there. You will always know what to say to hurt the other person.
Love you Ian. And Chris. I feel Ian is often misunderstood ❤
Omg!! Why am I crying!! I love them together
❤
Oh my goodness. ❤ There is so much love and respect between them. Ian crying broke my heart.
Chris has Meghan now... Ian deserves someone WAY better than Chris.
Ian might have hurt Chris before the breakup but Chris broke Ian after the breakup the way he cried he didn't want the relationship to end
It hurt me when ian cried. You can see he's not over Chris, so when Chris held his ground, I knew it was truly over. Not knowing exactly what happened, but guessing ian messed up, I can see why Chris has moved on. I know this from my own experience. I hope the best for each of them individually. ♥
They miss each other. Hopefully they can love again
Ian crying… guys oh I can’t 😭😭😭
Just him saying “Christopher” 3:32 took me back 🥹
get back together already😢
Elf cosmetics making me go and cry here. They were such a beautiful couple.
My eyes are moist.
Ian is way too good for Chris. Ian is more mature and together.
“panicked at even having you in the first place”  woah. i felt that HARD
Woah its like they switched roles. 😢
Watching them care for each other even after being broken up for so long is so sweet
This was awesome!!! Thank you so much for this!! So much love for those guys!! ❤️ Amazing!! 🥺
They are the best.
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that in called Chris Daniel
this was like watching ur divorced parents in therapy😭😭😭 i miss them sooo much
Sweet boys.😢
Now this is true love! There is such a beautiful connection between them!
I wasn’t ready for this emotional assault 😭
❤❤❤
Exacto. Get back together. You both had said it. You both had mad love for each other. Tears from the heart thats what I see.
Not elf bringing our parents back together 🥺❤
Ughhhh I cannnnnt 😭
Omg ❤❤❤
They aren't over...❤❤❤❤
Please make them a SERIES!!!
God how I miss them together ❤
Their connection is still so strong. You can tell that some of the things Chris said Ian really needed to hear.
OMGG
i didn’t think i was going to cry today 😭💔
Did we watch the same video?  Ian looked so uncomfortable.  Chris was just like hi friend.  Nice to see you again.
Aww omg! I hope this was healing for you both.
I remember when they first broke up the first 5-10 videos after were of Chris in tears. He shed his already, but Ian is finally getting to his, I think...some people take their time in healing.
Ian crying beaks me.  Love them both.
I could’ve watched them for an hr ( I was hoping it would be lol ) they’re so inspiring. This video exudes love. I wish you guys nothing but the best you deserve it❤️❤️
I had no idea how much I needed to see this. I want so much happiness for both of them.
Oh. My. Heart. 😭😭😭🤍
I hope it wasn’t too hard for them because it was a lovely conversation.   Great seeing love being practised by people, and not just hate, even after relationships’ ending.
I’m crying so much
ian is so funny omg
Ian 😭😭😭
So sweet! ❤🥰 I know we shouldn't be publicly opining or pressuring, but it's so hard not to want them to rekindle things. They're just too cute.
I’m so happy to see this. Not many get to have these type of moments or closure after a break up.
They were my all time favourite internet couple. I just wish all the success and happiness for both of them. And i really hope them to be good friends and be in touch with each other
when the person who you swore could've been your soulmate had taught you so well but now you both have to move on.
I need the complete, unedited video of this exchange, and I need it now.
Damn, seeing Ian crying makes my heart hurt.
It’s amazing to watch how much growth they both have had after the break up. I don’t think their story is done quite yet.❤
I fell in love with this video. The way they look at each other tells such a beautiful story. I wish you  both the best in life.
Why was this so cringe?
WHAT WHAAAAAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 30 MIN
I’m crying now
They learned so much from each other and their experiences together and apart. That’s the bittersweet thing about breakups.
I hate it when things don’t work out but there’s still so much love, it’s so evident.
Aww, love them both. Ian is GLOWING from the serum though
Cause they're still cool, it makes me.sad they broke up. I totally love, love, looooooooved them and their videos and their friendship still...my heart 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I wish this was longer, I could watch these two forever. I absolutely adore them but that connection and genuine love is still there between them maybe in the future who knows but if not I wish them both the best!
I expected Chris to cry first lol, and it was nice to see Ian open up and let out his emotions, it made me happy to see them have this moment together, I am sending them both good vibes
Get back together
Ian crying got me crying in my car at school pick up 😢
I feel like it’s not ok to be watching such an intimate moment.
Love u guys so much
I need more 😭😭😭
IM FUCKING SOBBING
Why am I violently sobbing
I don’t even use YouTube anymore. I’m only here for this
i need more footage of this 9 mins wasnt enough ❤
This is emotional for me
It feels so meta to get emotional about someone’s real relationship and also think “damn that setting powder ate I should get it”
I'm sitting here with tears rolling down my face simply because conversations like this can only happen when healing has occurred. When people are able to hold themselves accountable and recognize what they do/don't/didn't bring to the table. Their connection is one of incredible grace and I hope for the both of them that they are able to find love and happiness in other things/people/places/journeys. Oh, there was makeup?
It’s so great seeing the both of them just talk with each other. They’ve grown and healed, but yet you can still see how deep their connection is. A video I never thought I needed❤️
Aww I hope Ian puts himself out there again, he's got so much to offer.
We need the full uncut footage!
There’s obviously still respect and love for the time they shared together between the two of them. Obviously they’ve gone different routes of healing and they’re both blooming so beautifully apart 😢❤ so happy for them
Get back together now. Literal soulmates
7:05 “Ian: “oh god, is it patchy?”  Chris: “no. It looks great.”  My GOD!!! You can’t write this!!!!!!!!
This was a lot to watch, I'm not even gonna lie buh I'm glad we got to see this. Chris has grown so much and we've got to see Ian’s more soft side. I love you both so much and this still breaks my heart. Wish you both the very best.❤
Why am I getting teary eyed while im watching this 😅😢
IAN IM ON A TREADMILL PLZZZZ😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺
I love them 💖
ian :( i feel so bad for him i think he misses chris so much still and i feel like chris is kind of healed or he just doesn’t want to show his feelings on the internet
The growth in each of them is EVIDENT!
You could feel there connection and how much they have love for each other when he cried i cried we need more of them
I always saw Ian as the more dominant and put together one than Chris this really showed us like how the relationship was and how much social media can really show only a small part
I love this and them soo much
oh to be a fly on the wall during the actual breakup, i imagined Chris being the one to shed tears face to face. I hope Ian’s okay and I hope down the line they’ll be closer (or married) 😭
This.
Ughhhhh I just love these two! I need a tissue. 🤧
I mean but can we talk about how well Chris held it together?! He’s grown so much! Both are strong facing each other like this after the very public break up. I love them ❤️
I feel like im watching my divorced parents talking again 🥲
This left me wanting more but oh so happy they got to have closure with each other and all of the world who felt so submerged in their lives.
I feel like Ian didn’t think Chris would move on and thrive when they broke up and now that he’s popular and killin it, he’s missing him. Sad
❤❤❤❤
I love them so much! Just beautiful humans!
It feels like Ian’s still having a hard time moving on with the love they had and Chris on the other hand is over it. I mean, sure they’re friends and that’s it it for Chris. Remember when they broke up, Chris was devastated. He even went to therapy because of it. I still miss them together. I’m glad they both look well though.
OH MY GOOOOOOD!!! 😭😭😭🥹
Whoever came up with this idea should be lauded. What a great way to get people engaged with your products.  I will always love these two because they helped me during the pan dulce. Best wishes to them both. ❤❤
i’m so glad they’re both healing❤
Oh my heart can’t take it 😓
I admire Ian’s vulnerability ❤
Why does Chris look so uncomfortable?????
I’ve seen comments of people saying this is awkward but I honestly find it super cathartic and such a beautiful mature conversation
I think that Chris made up his mind before coming in that he wouldnt be emotional and was surprised when Ian became emotional.   I felt bad cuz i feel like Ian needed that cathartic joint cry together and Chris somewhat dismissed it. I dont know if Chris just seemed surprised or maybe that he was enjoying that Ian was crying over him.
Could’ve watched an hour worth of this healthy conversation. Ugh
😭😭😭
I miss them together so much, seeing this brought me such joy. ❤
❤❤❤
I don’t believe it’s over. They have a special bond, a connection they will not have with anyone else. They are each others Lobster. We shall see them again. I love the way he says “ Christopher”.
Welp, i guess ill cry or whatever
am i the only one who thinks that they both still love each other?
Cant stop my tears when Ian almost lose it. 😢
this makes me believe their story is not over yet :/
I hope they grow enough separately to grow together someday. They make such a beautiful couple
Omg this made me cry!! You can tell Ian throughout the whole thing was on a fight or flight mode and then he cries? Shit I cried right after!!! I love them both!
i loved every second of this
This couldn’t have been better 🫠🥲. We love our Dads ❤
Not me crying. This is how my heartbreak felt, and this was so healing to watch.
This is the last internet couple I am investing in. It's too much when they break up.
sometimes I forget they have a 10 year gap
This was iconic wow. I feel like you really can see Chris’s healing and emotional growth.
❤
I wish them both healing. I can’t believe I’m crying over an elf make up video!!!! 😂❤
An Aquarius through and through! Ian I cried talking with my ex a bunch too!
Truly don’t think I’ve seen something so tender and raw on the internet before. Beautifully done, sending love to both 💕
This is so beautiful omg
we need one of these with the try guys next lmao
This is absolutely beautiful.
The purest love is not just being together. It is to grow to be the best version of ourselves.Thank you e.l.f. Cosmetics for bringing them on scene. We miss their interactions. ❤❤❤
This is the closure they needed 😢 I feel like Ian is now appreciative of what he lost, I wish them both the best and all the happiness in the world ❤
This still hurts so much. I wasn’t ready. I’ll never give up hope. I legitimately thought they were soul mates. But I wonder if they were just “right person, wrong time”. 💔
i refuse to believe they are done...
6:33 I heard the crack in Ians voice....and had to pause to prep for the water works 😭😭😭oh my heart was breaking
❤❤❤
“Christopher!!” 🥺
Loved Ian's iconic "Christopher" 😆 but overall loved  the video you can feel that they wanted to say so much more!
That was beautiful
Ok but hearing Ian say “Christopher!” It brought back so many memories 🥹 and Ian crying. Stop. I can’t. 🥺
This was so beautiful to witness. It’s like the closure we all needed. I’m so glad they are in a place to be this open and vulnerable with each other. I hoped they could remain friends   in the future. This gives me hope to see more Ian and Chris content. Love them both.   Ian was so real & I cried with him when he broke down. We heal in our own ways and no matter how much time has passed and new lovers in between, there are still precious memories that we have to look back on. That doesn’t mean we want to be back together with that person. But we can still want the best for them.   I’m proud of Chris for how much work he has done on himself. He was so sweet and gentle with Ian. I just love them both!!
Wow. Just wow. Their connection is just……. Wow. But I am glad to see that they’ve both grown within themselves.
I want this. Even if it's just for a little bit. The connection they have. The way Chris looks at Ian. I want someone like that. And in a way this is healthy. It's making me cry.
This is so sad to watch…. so much love and so much pain! 😭😭😭
in a couple of years they’re going to reconnect and the bond will be stronger because they both will be
This was beautiful to watch
Plz tell me that this love story isn't over!?!? Clearly your hearts 💕 are still with one another. Am just broken 💔 when I see either one cry!  Sending love to you both, and if it's meant to be that God will allow you two to find ya'lls way back to one another 💋
So beautiful! I cried but I love how they still can joke with one another! So heart warming
You can tell they will always love each other 💕
Here we go again. Re-living my parents divorce 😭😂
This honestly could be the same story of my husband and I’s! We were together for a few years, broke up, had some time apart, healed, grew, and then realised that actually our story wasn’t done. Now we’re married and have a baby and that time apart was still the best thing we did in terms of strengthening our relationship! Not saying that might be Chris and Ian’s story, but just saying that break ups are often really positive.
This is the best thing! ❤
Well that made me cry
This was great. Wish it was longer though.
OMG I missed you two!!!! Kiss and make up xx
This was healing
This is seriously the best marketing strategy I’ve ever seen. THIS is how you make an add. I just want to mend broken relationships while doing each others make up 🥹
This was beautiful
Omg. I love them so much. 🥺
this had so much potential but instead was just okay
an anxious & avoidant 😣 shit hurts
This is genius lol
THANK YOU for sharing this intimate moment with us.  Wow. My heart!!!
I hope they both find peace
Today I learned ELF stands for eyes lips face 😂
I really hope they continue to heal and find themselves and get back together. Ian seems so much more open and Chris seems so more emotionally stable. Or maybe now they can be friends idk.
I’m a straight women and god they are so hot
This was really surprising, when Chris mentioned that Ian held back emotionally I was like 😮 I really thought he was the most communicative in the relationship.
Ian crying broke my heart 😢 they have such a great connection
Chris seems like he’s genuinely happy and moved on which is a bummer for Ian since i think Ian still has a soft spot for Chris. They both still have great chemistry with each other.
❤ Hope they both feel lighter after this convo. So sweet.
Elf is the new Jerry Springer
The clothes alone scream their astrology birth ever,😂
I miss them so much
AWEE!
CRYING. I miss them so much :( that connection <3  but it's so good seeing them be in different paths in their lives and doing better with themselves. Hopefully their story is not over..
❤❤
Thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of this very tender moment between the two of them.
The love in their eyes.. it’s still there 💗
Chris is over Ian. This wasn’t what I was expecting.
Why are you doing this to us, elf? 😭
No it's looks great 😭
Regardless of whether they are completely over or not their relationship made each of them better people and really what else could you ask for.  Thank you elf this was a very heart warming video ❤
Omg … I was deeply touched that you guys were able to talk and share this moment … my dam broke when Ian did … you guys still do care deeply for each other … it still shows … but whatever, however fate would play … time will tell 💖🩵
I'm convinced that if these versions of themselves existed when they were in a relationship it could have worked!!
God I love them. So much genuine respect.
Anyone else was just crying during the whole thing
Not me crying!!! Ugh so much love still there!
I came to heal. I'm glad we all healed. ❤
I CANT TAKE ITTTTT
My heart😭
I can see and feel how much they love each other. You never really get over your first true love. I hope they continue to grow and maybe find each other again when they’re ready.
Omg!
They were really meant for each other, the should get back together
i definitely started crying when Ian did. i love them both and i’m so proud of them for doing this even if it was just partially for show.
My parents 🥹😭
😭😭😭😭
😭🥹
This is being an adult to a tea❤
“Christopher” wow, the way Ian always says his name
This is the closure we all needed
elf, you ate that little one thing. so grateful to be able to see such a tender moment! mhm. kudos.
I truly believe their story is not over. However I think they’ll rekindle privately, as they should ❤️
Taylor swift and joe alwyn gonna have to do one of these episodes
Ian not remembering the details of what Chris likes or hates is not a sign of him not caring. Cause it's the same with me and my childhood bestfriend we've been friends since we were 5 or 6 and now we're 25 I don't remember any detail of her because I live the moment with her and I'm secure she'll be in my life forever -cause we've been through stuff and she proved she'll stay- so I'm not worried about details cause she'll state them out when I forget or I directly ask her - I always forget her birthdays until she invites me to go out- and it's not only with my best friend I constantly forget names birthdays and details that I am comfortably sure the other person will just tell me when it's necessary. I can see this similarity between me and Ian and I also can see that it's a trait that Chris doesn't like
I miss them a lot. I'm glad they're able to sit down and do something like this (and get that bag while doing it - work.)
I’m crying 😭 I love them so much.. this was a moment for them and us as viewers. WOW!  Thank you elf!
my heart 🥹❤️
I miss them so much 😭😭
It’s hard to be in love with someone and know you’re no good for them.. so you leave because you knew they deserved better
I can’t believe Ian broke down and Chris held it together 😭 Now that’s what I call growth! 🥹♥️ I’m so glad they’re both in a better place where they can follow each other again and not have it be awkward. CORRECTION: They are not following each other again. I got confused with Ian following ELF cosmetics. ✌️
Wait this was so mature and enjoyable. Also a clever campaign for elf
I'm glad you could tell both of them are not quite over each other. They both couldn't communicate and now this is a step in a better direction. The fact Ian wore that bracelet and broke down a wall infront of chris was beautiful.
I WANT MORE 😭
Not me sobbing when Ian started crying 😭😭😭 ugh love these two and happy they could share this moment
i’ve had that same feeling of crying that ian had - when u wonder if the other person has thought about the past too and needing to hear from ur ex that they have. that hit so hard it’s so real
I feel like they will come back to each other eventually. I don't think right now was their time.
Best thing to come out of Mercury Retrograde
I’m still not over this breakup yet :( I hope they’re both genuinely happy. I can see they still care so much about each other a lot
Ian was peaceful and regretful while Chris was kinda passive aggressive. Love them both. Hope seeing them both succeed. I think Ian was more affected by the breakup and he's looks still affected by it while Chris look like he's in another stage of his life and that he got over it. They obviously look like they'll never get back together mainly because Chris just put that behind his back and is in a new chapter
This made me cry.   Beautiful.  Thank you.
Ian misses his best friend ❤
I did not realize how much I missed Ian saying “Christopher!”
Who made this video? Shane is that you???
Loved this @elf
I am unwell. Seeing them together is so bittersweet.
Needed this omg 😂
The Mrs doubtfire reference 🥺
The way Ian looked at Chris' butt at the end 🥰
oh my god, kiss
this is the most wholesome video you can tell they really loved each other at a time and still deeply care for one another wow my heart strings
Man this was hard to watch. I think this made Chris realize Ian was deeply in love with him. Sad they let their fears get in the way, hopefully their story isn’t finished.
3:33 CHRISTOPHER
the way ian cried a bit made me tear up☹️ i think he still loves chris, i just cant tell if chris loves him
What was the little wink at the end when you said the sun had set? 🤔🧐🤨
Absolutely adore these men! Together or not, I’ll always be a fan! I loved to see this and honored they let us in on this conversation!! ❤
The part where Ian looks heartbroken in the beginning and then later when he cries is sad 😢
That’s it? I want more, someone slap the other person, kiss them then slap them again. Bring them back! I need moreeee😢
i'm not gonna lie i missed ian sayin "chritoPHER"
Not me sobbing when Ian cried. I can’t handle this 😫
Damn they still love each other so deeply. T_T im so crying.
Anyone else feel like this is the visual of a steamy book?! Especially at the end when you just want them to kiss, the tension builds, and then you are left still waiting…..? No? Just me?
This felt… wrong to watch.
I need to binge season 1!! Needed it yesterday. Please and thank you! ❤❤
I loved this sm
twinflames
The minute Ian started crying so did I. I could feel this emotions. I hope they’ve been able to heal.
Elf knew what they were doing here 😂😂😂
Just gonna bookmark this for next time someone ask me how to do integrated marketing
i love them so much. Loved them as a couple, love them as single individuals. they’re amazing
My heart🥺💛
This was so hard to watch. I’m happy they’re both happy and healing
This felt like a very special moment ❤
Such a beautiful video. The connection between them is still there but in a different way, love it
This is everything I needed today
Oh God my heart, Ian is still so in love. I think Chris has moved on, but now I want them back together.
These two are so adorable.
😭😭😭 I wasn’t ready
Me while eating my lunch: 😦😢😭🍝
Oh Ian.
Why did I cry?! Ugh felt like Ian still  loves Chris but maybe  later on in life things might change. This was beautiful  to watch.
Not that this is unique to homosexual relationships, but breakups are often much harder for us because we don't have the options and avenues that heterosexuals have to find new partners. It's very very difficult to find someone you bond with in the LGBT community and build a relationship. Many LGBT humans never get to experience a long term relationship, and getting that experience and losing it can be and devastating  because who knows if you'll ever feel that again. Chris seems willing to try to find that again, and Ian seems to be holding on that feeling longer maybe out of fear he'll never feel it again.
What a random video
This was so sweet
this was so tender. and you could see that it was healing for ian 😭
I really loved them together . Maybe they can try again now that they’re both more in tune with themselves . They have such a connection
Is this some kind of internet closure?
Bye I’m crying
My heart 🥺❤
Ugh. I’m sure this was so hard for them. 😞😞😞💔
I love them so much I mainly came here for them but elf y’all did so good doing this!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ian cries without tears . Great actor
Whoever was in charge of this needs a raise!!!!
I feel like this is not the end for them ❤
I've missed him saying Christafar! 🥺😭
I think this showed that Chris was the toxic one 😂
Gah I love them together. I'm glad they're able to do this.
Ugh, love seeing them work through the pain of ending a relationship. You can see the love still.
Ian was holding the tears in from the beginning and so was I 😭😭😭😭
I think Chris really needed to be single to grow. He has done amazing things this past year.
That made me fill uncomfortable like  the moment we found out they broke up. ♥️ Chris
The way Ian keeps slipping into this  British accent 😭😭😭
All jokes aside I seriously want to address how Chris did an excellent job on Ian's makeup. He was glowing to perfection.
🙁🙁🙁🙁 awwww Ian
3:33 Christopher ❤
Some times people are just better apart, and other times they need to grow apart first before they can come back together. The fact they were able to come together and do this shows how much they’ve grown. I cannot belief this was for elf 😂
I wasn’t prepared to cry
The crying out of no where🥹my heartttt It be like that sometimes Ian😔
The lesson in all of this is break ups are painful and heartbreaking. But growing and maturing post relationship, where  you can come back together and address each other with kindness is a beautiful gift that more people should strive for.
I could’ve watched an hour of this. Their connection is still so deep. The way Chris was leaning forward and making such deep eye contact. The way Ian opened his heart and shared his hurt. They’ve both grown and healed so much. ❤
Is having wine at 2 pm okay after seeing Ian cry? I miss them. So happy to see them together in any capacity. EMOTIONS 😭❤️
Why did I cry too?
I think you could tell that Chris needed to see Ian cry a little over him. Like a sort of closure that he wasn’t the only one still holding just a tad bit of emotion towards the breakup but he’s also finally over his own sadness. I’m so happy for both of them for this.
i wonder if they would work out now
If they didn’t have sex after this and went on a date, I will cry.
But Chris is a bit goofy😊😂❤
It’s really crazy because I always viewed Chris as the more emotional one, so seeing Ian so vulnerable and Chris more “together” was such a new experience. I wish them both the best.
Ian saying “Christopher”, I missed it aw🥺
My heart 🥺 This was so special
Oh no 😢Not Ian crying! This made me sad and happy all mixed feelings
Why am I crying so much! 😢 I adore each of them so much
I missed hearing that “Christopher!” 🥹
I get Ian so much
So so proud of them both for being able to come together again and talk. This looked to be a very open environment and healing experience that they both needed. 💜💜
Why do y’all do us like this
Love them both ♥️
Chris is like awe sorry boo I’m more famous now. Good luck! But for real love the realness
This is everything 💕
Interesting Chris was the super emotional one in the relationship but was reserved here wheres Ian was the opposite they flipped after the break up it seems 😢 hopefully they can at least be good friends going forward
I needed that❤❤
"And look at the sun, it has set." What a way to end this! Tissues please.
omg the tension is so real… I cried when Ian cried. I find it very interesting how folks cope after a breakup and you can see it through them… they both have gone their own way. I love them both 🥹
We love you guys together or apart 🥺🫶🏻 we definitely miss the duo a lot though. You guys had an amazing friendship
My parents are in therapy 😭
🥺
Ugh, I loved and hated this
Awww Ian is still not over him… 😢
Not Ian crying 😫 my heart
I absolutely love this 🥹
omg
Absolutely LOVE them together & as individuals! Still not over their breakup 😭😢💔
This is in a way very lovely and a bit cringy to watch. Feels like it’s too personal and is wrong for me to listen to
I loved their relationship!!! Glad to see them talking about what happened!!! I remember following them both last year!! They've come so far!!! So happy to see them together and just talking!!!
This is so so beautiful!! I love to see them together again and it heals my little heart to know they have forgiven each other. I hope in the future they can reconnect 💖
That was beautiful.
i hope they both continue to heal and find themselves where they need to be. whether it’s with one another or not💛
damn Ian basically said he’s not over him 😢
Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!
IM CRYING. I think it was so important for them to be able to talk on their own regarding it and I really do feel bad they both had to deal with so much negativity when it happened :(
“Not onl🐓😂😂😂😂”
The way they look at each other
OMG Now why didn't y'all say they were ready to talk Eyes, Lips, and Face to Face???
I teared up who’d thunk it
This was so special ❤️
Damn it’s sad Ian seems like he had a very hard time still with the breakup.  The way he hasn’t been on dates yet or cried thinking of fond moments 😢
Im not over it 😢
This is beautiful ❤
How dare you do this to us on a Wednesday afternoon, Elf. Perfect. ❤️
Yeah…..I’m still not over it

my heart 💔 I NEED MORE OF THEM
I'm bawling. I just love them SO much. I miss them together, but I'm glad to see a little behind the curtain. It tells a tiny bit of why they didn't work. I support each of them & hope they continue to heal. They're such beautiful souls.

I'm grateful to be apart of the moment they just shared with each other, they have grown so much.

The pure love and connection between them. Wouldn’t be surprised if their story isn’t over just yet
