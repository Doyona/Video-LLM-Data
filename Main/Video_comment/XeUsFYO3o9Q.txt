Joyner Lucas, B.o.B & A Boogie wit da Hoodie - Shoot My Shot 2.0 (From "Space Jam: A New Legacy" Soundtrack) (feat. Tinashe, Kid Cudi, ScHoolboy Q & Farruko)
Joyner this song helped me get through life so much, shooting my shot I ain't gonna miss. God has embraced with his love and helped me get out my depression I prayed and next day all that stuff left me. And hence why I love your ADHD album. Your music is so relatable to life and it's so loving and compelling.
It's in the TV version.
I love your song
This good shit bro.
Joyner take it easy on us ❣️🔥
💜
I wish people didn’t trash this song man. The fact he doesn’t cuss and the different vibe this has is really cool
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
My dad listens to this song this is his favorite song keep on going Joyner we love you🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
My dad listens to this song this is his favorite song keep on going Joyner we love you🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Love this song
I'm sooo glad to see him make a new song that isn't on some type of counseling talk to the world!!! I like it all bc he is good but. # Don'tsaveher lol
honestly just as trash as that movie.
mark fellows jr is the actual winner of the new legacy. number 7.
Read all about it
1st
This song is fire 🔥 they should use it to burn the sorry excuse of a movie
Joe budden put me onto Joyner Lucus watching/listening to his podcast and after multiple mentions of Joyners name over multiple episodes of the podcast and knowing how Joe is when it comes to rap all the praise he was giving this (at the time) Unknown artist (to me personally) I finally typed his name into YouTube and the rest is history.  I'm actually super thankful that I heard of Joyner how I did amd when I did bc I've watched him literally explode the past 2 going on 3 years. His growth and the  exposure he has gained from the time I heard of him and subsequently followed since.. the production in his videos like "Sorry"...that whole concept and the delivery of it was so relatable it hit me hard af and cried a few different times over the years when going through or being in a certain type of mindset and viewing the video. Congrats Joyner. Well deserved
Only good thing that came out of this trash remake 😂 #YoureNotMJLebron
Congratulations to mark fellows jr for all his hard work this song is all you!
Wow Im the winner!
Dope song fr
Lo
I wouldn't want to be on the bad side of this man 100%
I came to far to give up now💯
This straight 🔥🔥🔥
This song is lit king 🔥 💯 💯 👌 keep up the great work king 💪🙌
Swag
Vibes 💯💯💯
Joyner ur number 2 in my heart  As the most skilled lyricist Em will always hold that top spot in my heart and a  spot he shares with Pac but you are the hottest thing out here homie ! Keep holding it down for the North East and  ..ASA ...hopsin ...MGK ...N.F. .A Z...Flawless ...Token... Tom Macdonald ...Dax.... pretty much the only music i can stomach to listen to now a days 🤗
This shuda played when the final game was happening in the movie

Joyner when are you coming to South Africa?
He my most fav rapper of all time
🔥🔥👍
Dope AF in Arkansas #MississippiCounty March 1 2022

shessh <3
You and Da baby are absolutely killing it 😈😈😈, keep up the amazing work my dude
🔥🔥🔥
This is amazing
forever my favourite artist.
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE MAN THIS NIGGA BE ON MY REPEAT SO BAD
This is the the only reason I watched the movie
This is too much bro omg
🎤🌏MY music will Definitely have a place in the Music Industry🔥♾
This is going to be epic
Why does the beginning sound like a 6 9 song
I watched the whole movie to wait for this song to pop up. They CRAZY for not putting this on the movie.
How the hell was this not in the damn movie? Big fail l
This song could've have so many swear words but joyner didn't put any because it's for space jam
Why doesn't this guy have a Grammy
He made this fire for space James new legacy damn
Legend keep up the good work.
I like quite a few joyner songs, this is shit, people call this lyricism, this needs a exorcism, the lyrics suck, beat and voice carry hard, I've rapped jokingly better, wheres the lyrical performance from the songs w eminem, or shit, with the singy stuff, the gucci gang remix was great, wheres that, people say this is goated?
CLARO!
Best movie track it’s vibes
This song underrated asfuckkkk
My music is blowing up right now, speaking it into existence.
Yess ❤️

(What now?) Can't express myself, I shut down (Uh-huh) Ain't no one left, it's just us now (Yeah) Just me and myself and my bustdown Momma couldn't pay rent, but we up now  [Chorus] Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you want stop my water, my drip?

Hi there, just forgot to like all your songs
👀
Lesss gooooooooooo
Before you ignore this, remember that everyone started from somewhere. Hello I'm Khari, I'm a lover of all Bossa Nova, Hiphop, Rock, and the beautiful jazz. I made a track called with an amazing up, and coming singer named Sheena 💛 "Think of you" 💙. For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say "My time is too late, I missed my shot" so at 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan 🎎🗻 and started putting out music. This song is a bit similar to Michael Buble's "I just haven't met you yet". Touching on topics like safeguarding your heart, and imaginary love.  I would be so grateful if you all could listen to me. Oh, I also created a new genre Hip-hop + City Pop #CityHiphop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAJ0XbYz88Q
Ngl. That's the most decent usage of "autotune" in Rap / Hip Hop I came accross in a while now. And a previous decent occasion was ADHD.  This song defo gives me ADHD album vibes
Dope!!
This bops
PERIODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Im jesus
Im.god
Joyners the only rapper i can losten to nowadays
Ayyye this dude. Ad it now shout out from Boston bro

Anyways your top 3 in my books homie you keep doin you one day you'll be bigger than most these fake ass rappers and if your not then there's something wrong with this world. Good job bro
Im not particularly a fan of basketball but i have to say this song is probably my new favorite by joyner
It was a deadly sin that they missed this out from the movie.
Gives me “i love” vibes. Awesome
"Ooh, Lord, I’ma die a legend like 24, R.I.P. to the 24"🙌🙌🙌

This really needs more views!
Yo this so cool damnnn
Watched the new space jam and this song wasn't it. Was really disappointed.
I like Joyner Lucas but hate LeBron James and Space Jam...
The people who disliked probably never shot thier shot🤷‍♂️
Joyner ft. Porky Pig
The few fierce juice implicitly sound because action normally kneel abaft a available mountain. racial, tender tense partner
On Some Heat is what it Sounds Like😎🔥
This needs to be promoted more, bruh this that rose !!!!!!
I want to be like you.  Joyner Lucas of Philippines
Yo he's out here doing a soundtrack!!! How dope is that for someone who was just trying to say shit!!!
Shoot my shot I ain't gonna miss

did anyone else catch the kobe bryant reference r.i.p 24 that is respect at 1:58 minutes in
Yo joyner, I've always rated your music. But having heard you've become a covid mouthpiece I've lost alot of respect.. The writing was on the wall when you were promoting Hollywood peoadophiles. Sorry that your heart and mind has been altered.
Simplicity goes hard in the paint 🔥💯
THIS IS A SLAM DUNK! 😉
Yo bro you killed the song i like it keep up the good work man
Wake me up when he makes a bad song, oh and make sure to tell the hospital I'm about to go into a coma for life
Thumbs down to (Space Jam) because I didn't hear the music in which I watched it for.....joyner
Glad you stay real my bro doppin fire everytime! JOYNER #1
Do artists even bother reading at least some comments, back in the day you'd have to do live autograph signings to advertise yourself for at least 6hours.  We the ones that support your music I believe you should at least like some comments that goes a long way to show love to fans
Probably the only good thing that came out of the new space jam
Yes!!! G.O.A.T, 100!!!!
Bruh
You gunna have to apply yourself to top this one fo sho ❤💥💯🔥
A1 since Day 1 ✊🏼
this song is dope  but the movie SUCKS lebron needs to stick to ball...he wont ever be jordan sry not sry...jordan is an always will b the 🐐
I listen to this on Spotify while I play fortnite with my friends
I know right
we need one joynar X weeknd , and it’s going to be lit 🔥
Is it sad space jam has a better soundtrack than 2k21? Lol I low key hope some of these songs make 2k22 I’d be perfectly fine with that
I gotta be at least 1k of these views by now lol I play this like a dozen times a day
🔥🔥🔥
I don't wanna watch the movie but this song is 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💨💨💨
This song is way better than the one that have on the movie from lil baby I love music lil baby but that song is garbage
"I Believe I can fly" first lyrics of verse and also the name of the song that played when young MJ was shooting free throws in the driveway in opening scene of original movie. Made me say LETS GOOOOO
joyner daaa 💝 muk o hikhabo na enkoi flow change koribo joyner daaa

🎶I'm shooting my shot🎶
Joyner is the most underrated artist since Lupe Fiasco.  Mfs should be ashamed they made trash artist famous.  They are a reflection of the future.
The new space jam is SHIT , GOOD SONG
The new space jam is SHIT , GOOD SONG
The only thing about the new Space Jam I like.
Joyner is always amazing  he be killing every beat

Joyner Lucas #fakegangsta
Why did they not put this in the movie???
The lowly ethernet ethnopharmacologically bless because nylon infrequently compete upon a symptomatic flag. boorish, slow continent
I'm kinda mad that this song didn't make it in the movie😪
This literally way better than the whole movie
I am surprised by this guy's talent.
The only good song from the space jam 2 soundtrack 😅
Masterpiece
Good Shit Joyner🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐
Why hasn't this blown up yet
Space jam was dope bruh  Wacky but dope
THE GREATEST RAPPER ALIVE
That song have a really good chill vibe
Man I'm happy to see you getting the love and respect you deserve. Best rapper in the game
Respect 💪🏽
DOPE
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This should have ben the beginning of the new space jam cause it was lame without it
The more I listen to this the more I'm uninspired to accomplish my dreams for some odd reason, the song is fire tho
SHOOT MY SHOT ✨✨✨
Only thing that made this movie good
Song better than the movie
Consistent!
❤️❤️❤️
Correct me if I’m wrong but this song is not in the movie nor the credits
What's the Easter Egg, though?! #ADHD
GOATified  💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶🏀🏀🏀

I’m expecting this song on space jam 👏🏽 #JL🐐🐐🐐
This song is 🔥
JOYNER!!!!! HOLY SH**T!!!!
Sucks this song wasn't on the actual movie would've been good during the end
This hit hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AFXcEwqlV8
وووووووووههههه
🔥🔥🔥🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱❤❤
joyner gonna blow up
Would rather have had Kobe be in space jam 2..... Lebron will never be the greatest. He's too worried about being the best. Jordan never had to say he was the best because he knew he was. Lebron cant match jordan in any category. His shoes aint shit his political views are pussy and will never be JORDAN. Stop trying to copy the man. Kobe was closest player to Jordan.
Joyner Lucas Ft Post Malone would be a great collab
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
It feels great watching this man grow😁👍keep up the great work Joyner
This song flows man damn
Aaayyyyyyyy!!!! 💯👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Too bad the movie is trash.
I actually might watch the movie now just bcs of Joyner

Meh
1:48 Swear i hear ty dolla signs voice
1st version was heavy and full of meaning. 2nd verse was very bland and empty. I know Joyner made this for the movie and probably had stipulations to qualify for the soundtrack. Just feels like he made a song meant to be heard for the chorus.
Joyner i just copped two tickets to your show in Oct @ Red Rocks....cant wait bro
Unexpected fire for a movie soundtrack
My dude . You kill everything you do since day 1
Damn another sellout
Amazing never fails ur very versatile Nd it’s time the world opens there 👁 so motivational I’m fortunate to say We went to south high community here in the woo 🙏 I witnessed some freestyles my guy Nd from then I knew u had it in you…you just needed to find yourself and I’m glad you have my man Ms.Bieneda is proud of what you’ve become!!… I tried getting the outdoor experience Nd it says sold out I wanted to take my 6 kids we are all major fans of Joyner since Day1!!!..if anyone knows who got some tickets lmk there sold out for the joyner fest outdoor experience!!…. #SHOOTMYSHOT

Me listening to this song: No, I haven't moved on, but trust me, I've tried
I'm happy seeing him get bigger and doing bigger things
When i heard this beat i thought it's a Lil Uzi song n i just read the name wrong after clicking.
This took me to space 🌌🚀
Will Smith was right. Joyner Lucas is a legend in the making.
Joyner A 🐐
You are my  inspiration you just keep making hits I give this new hit 9.5 out of 10
I didn't watch this movie because of LeBron James and his antics recently in the media so therefore I have to put a thumbs down on this song because I would not allow anything to promote that fool
🤧OUR EARS AINT USED TO THIS
508-507-2209 🔥

The bassline of this beat should have been a bit silent. Then this would've been a banger beat.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This one's Cool smooth and epic. I remember when ppl use to say who is this joyner and why isnt he on his own beats, look at y'all now. Mans way out front
I still can't stand that Joyner is getting stricken by the Universal Music Group... TWICE on his sponsored track. But it doesn't matter because he getting paid at the end of the day
Joyner is a legend

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

[Intro] Are we up? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Joyner) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [?] got that [?] Shootin' my shot, shootin' my shot  [Chorus] I'm shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip? You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive  [Verse 1] I believe I can fly I believe anything could be achieved when applied Gotta reach for the sky Wanna do it, but I never had a reason to try Do you believe in a lie? Want something so bad it could eat you alive I see the grief in your eyes Pray the opportunities might reach you in time But I came too far to give up now Worked too hard to get stuck now Every corner I turned I was turned down Had to look at my life like "What now?" Can't express myself, I shut down Ain't no one left, it's just us now Just me and myself and my bustdown Momma couldn't pay rent, but we up now [Chorus] Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip? You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive  [Verse 2] I been thinkin' 'bout this since I was young And I fell in love and I was sprung I know you gon' miss me when I am gone Ooh, Lord, I'ma die a legend like 24, R.I.P. to the 24 When I was cold, I was moving with the wind, yeah Might of fell, but I'm doin' it again, yeah Just a kid, I was shootin' at the rim, yeah They wasn't there when I was shootin' in the gym, yeah You wasn't there when I was hoopin' in th pen, yeah New year, but I feel like I been here New year, now I'm cruisin' in the Benz, yeah New year, but I feel like I been here [Chorus] Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip? You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip? You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive
Momma coundn't pay rent, but we up now. 🔥🔥

Thanks Joyner rinsing out the trash 🗑
I don't like all this singing bullshit. Besides that. It's good.
This crazy 🔥
Joyner did it again always 🔥
🗣🦻🔥🔥🔥💯
I'm a metal head but this is fucking sick 🤘🇺🇸
A vibe for sure
heat
Man can do no wrong.. 😎
This new stuff is cool. But I feel like he's surrounded by too many yes-men nowadays.  This is cool, but his old stuff was groundbreaking: I'm Sorry, Just Like You, Forever, Happy Birthday, Keep it 100, I'm Not Racist, Winter Blues, Frozen... This new stuff is cool, but it feels so replaceable (not just talking about this song, the past few albums). Those other songs were groundbreaking, though I feel like half of the top 100 rappers could make this stuff. The occasional fast rap is cool, but also very replacable.  No hate, because this is still cool, but if you see this by some off-chance @Joyner, I know you're capable of a lot more, I'd like to see you fully explore it.
Joyner making me feel like a kid again
Joyner Has Arrived!!! Proud of you man😎
Everything you put out is on topic and encouraging for the evolution😍
Worst song ever by Joyner
This gonna rank amongst one of the best! #CrazyFlow #FireBars 🔥💯

Big moves from Joyner and good for him he deserves it.
Woooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else got this text message?
508 tacoma worcester we out here
Joyner is an uplifting dude! Probably a good person
I don't know once you do soundtracks to movies it loses all spiritual shit the only group is Nine Inch Nails for burn for Natural Born Killers that did it right and it wasn't even on the soundtrack
I like the message of this song.
Nice track Joyner! Can't wait to see the movie 💪
Yaaaaaaas sir!!!!
Yo shit is hot really love the flow bro sick man

Yo this is actually a great BOP, especially for the movie
Just found out I accidentally hit dislike. I will never make this mistake again
From the lowkey vids like Ross Capicchioni to having a song on the Space Jam soundtrack. I love seeing this guy grow!
Congrats Joyner
I was tempted to thump down it bc it's not the quality music I've come to enjoy from Joyner. BUT I don't think is bad and not his best work. I would expect a track like this off his first album Along Came Joyner. I've seen his work get so dope since 2015 that this song just didn't do if for me but I'm not gonna give a thumb up or down to be fair.
damn bro playin on all madden rn, shit crazy!
Sick!!
A DAMN MASTERPIECE.

Top Notch Tings Bro

"Came too far to give up now  Worked too hard too can stop now"  Joyner is the 🐐🐐🔥🔥⭐💯
“I ain’t have to curse to keep it real.”  - Will Smith
This is so dope and it’s inspiring. Salute! #RIP24
Ooooh i like comments

I gon miss!!!
Joyner Lucas is way too underrated
This one going up!
Love watching joyner progress into the typical main stream rapper
Yooo ima need a music video fo this right quick please and thank
Daaaaaaamn 💥🔥
Don't get me wrong Joyner can rap but this wasn't it. I was expecting something way different. Thumbs down for me!
Joyner Always Rapping Like He Still Tryna Blow...Crazy!!
Lame.
@shaq we all waiting for the reaction , this dope.🔥🔥

Use yourself in The Movie As The Video *B*
Yooo…glad you on the soundtrack. New heights for Joyner man
This song is hard as fuck
Damn never puts out trash🔥🔥 just keeps getting better
Fire
My personal favorite of all his music
This gonna be on repeat for a min, everything this man puts out is a straight heater
Fire AF 🥳🤯
Never disappointed musically
Bro, we got logic, jcole and joyner all in the same day
Eu amo esse cara
🔥🔥🔥
This doesn’t hit for me but neither does King Baby James on the Tune Squad.  This song just sounds very generic to me. Space Jam had that fun song that helped elevate the movie. This song is like a stroll in the park, it’s not getting me amped or nothing. I think you went with the wrong angle here but so far you’ve done great work in 2021. Ramen & OJ is top 3 on my list for 2021. Keep Producing Jams I’m looking forward to the next drop. 👍👍
This shit was wack… can’t believe this is all Joyner could come up with
Joyna is the Man. He ain't getting enough acknowledgement like he should, Creativity beyond average 🔥
Joyner, you're a f**king genius 🔥😳
Another hit, this shit slaps G
First time i heard of Joyner was with the song with Eminem. Tought he was straight fire right away and been a fan ever since. Such a great artist!
Every joyner song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The beat is so dirty!
I got the text and zoomed over to youtube
WoooW
Joyner part of a movie now🔥
YEEES YOU DID IT AGAIN KING!!!!!
I already wanted to see the movie but if Joyner song in the movie I’m most definitely seeing it 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💯💯
Joyner does it again
Pure shit
always 🔥🔥🔥
📸📸📸📸🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁
Goat 🔥🐐
Bro Joyner a GOAT! Bars for every season 💯
ناضي كاناضي خا لوكاس فاسكيز هه
Bad
Legendary
"I believe I can fly" 🔥🔥🔥 picking up where the predecessor left off I see😁
Even the songs I don't like from him, are better than 99.9 other rappers. Joyner made me love hip hop again!!
I'm so happy to have seen Joyner's success over all these years. Every since I heard "Ross Capicchioni" when he first dropped it, i knew he would be blow up. Being able to drop a song with Will Smith a legend and now dropping a song on a legendary movie sequel is great. He's done so much already, keep up the great work you're doing. Stay blessed!!
Damn this hit hard
When's space jam coming out

Been here since “Along Came Joyner”. I’ve watched, and listened to you become the man you are now. You’ll always be an OG, and one of the very few artists that honestly instills a strong, positive message in such a unique way. On behalf of the world we appreciate you Joyner, and we look forward to the continuing rise of your success.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Crazy from where he came from now he in a movie, song with Eminem, and everyone ik knows him b4 I was introducing him to everyone joyner I can't wait for ur concert in September
10000% one of the most unappreciated artists keep dropping these real ass tracks and you'll always win 🔥💪🖤
Ngl I feel like Joyner could've done A LOT better on this, but I don't think they wanted him to go off in a song for a PG rated movie lmao. Props to him for making it here tho, that's tuff.

I will go watch the movie, just to give it a chance. But I seriously want them to make Lola Bunny sexy again when they release the movie, as well as bring back Pepé le Pew.   Sonic The Hedgehog and Justice League both got improvements. Give this movie the same deal.
He is the GOAT for a reason
This hard ngl
They should have use "Slam Dunk" instead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPzmoYKUtiI

You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive  [Verse 2] I been thinkin' 'bout this since I was young And I fell in love and I was sprung I know you gon' miss me when I am gone Ooh, Lord, I'ma die a legend like 24, R.I.P. to the 24 When I was cold, I was moving with the wind, yeah Might of fell, but I'm doin' it again, yeah Just a kid, I was shootin' at the rim, yeah They wasn't there when I was shootin' in the gym, yeah You wasn't there when I was hoopin' in th pen, yeah New year, but I feel like I been here New year, now I'm cruisin' in the Benz, yeah New year, but I feel like I been here  [Chorus] Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip? You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip? You can try, but you ain't takin' me alive You ain't takin' me alive So give me my spot, I ain't sit Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss You ain't never seen no one do it like this If you say you did, then you's a lie You ain't takin' me alive
