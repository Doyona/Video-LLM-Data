How can Cech and drinkwater play in U23???
Chelsea under 23s:  Cech: 38
Peart Harris got a yellow card for throwing the ball at the fight
Livramento is a baller
You know two times I saw the woman’s team and the u23 team win against Tottenham and I thought it was the main team
with all this talent bt struggling at higher level
Commentators are soo bias! Bunch of losers
what a keeper he was before
The xenophobic pound appropriately scratch because locket apically rock inside a lucky slip. separate, military british
Petr Cech is one of my favourite footballers if he can get a win he should stay (plz stay Petr)
Yess hes back
Bottleham coldspur from the beginning
Thank you chelsea, as a Jamaican  fan I thank you very much.
30 year old tackling 23 like some baby is the funniest thing tbf
goal
I think Petr Cech has a bright future ahead, maybe  the odd PL title and if he works hard could make Chelsea the only team in London to win the European Cup
Good from Mr Czech republic
Lol why doesn’t RLM comment here
Pete cech in a under 23 team, nice, really nice
Omg.
Danny Drinkwater is pure class. Peter Cech welcome back🎉
why is cech the goalie
Who here loves Chelsea
1:38:05 he really didn’t want them to get subbed off😂😂😂
Welcome back home Petr Cech
how cech is playing ,did he get permission to play in u23 ,sry idk since i m not an chelsea fan
Hi gg
00,1%-Match 99,9%-Petr Cech
I miss peter cech😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Poor Cech let down by terrible defending
I don't get why they call it u23 if you can just field who ever the f**k you want 😅
** Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love.
34:55 60:12 75:44 80:13 86:54 Thanks
Chelsea goal keeper should replace Mendy
Only the senior team it seems afraid to win at Everton and wolves to go to the top of the table?? Sometimes i say once a player plays like they are tired or not interested, replace them with the u23's and they'll see how special playing for Chelsea really is.
Will Petr Cech play against Man Utd U23 on Friday comment below
i dont like football or whatever this is but im just watching it
Kepa best saves:   Thank me later😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Peter Chech saves:  22:54 25:09 32:51 1:05:43 1:14:32  Thank me later😎😎😎😎😎😞
I'm being stupid if it's under 23s why is cech playing?
Per chi cercasse l'entrata killer e la rissa di drinwhater è al minuto 1:37:55
He only collected his GCSES he never knew this is what he’s in for 😂😂😂😭

Even Arsenal is out of top 10 here
We miss you ziyech 😪
Peter Czech ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Petr Cech comeback
wow the traitor
Petr cech's future is so bright. I think he'll become the biggest player of Chelsea in the future...
I hope that cech kid don't break any bone
Little battle then, it's Chelsea v spurs😂
For those of you who came here to see Cech’s diving saves, ... there are none.
Up the Alfie
How is cech under 23?
Why is Cech playing in an U23 match?
Can't believe we payed 35m for Drinkwater
Wow, the next petr cech
Wtf DrinkWater bruh
I'm here to see cech, but what I see is silly Drinkwater.
So petr cech regen is true. Cant wait for John Terry regen
That guy Petr Cech seems to be quite a prospect...
1:41:10
So good to see Cech back in that goal
Nobody is talking about maurizio pochettino and Drinkwater
Welcome back Tommy Langley.  You have been missed... 👏👏👏
This is my first time watching PL 2 Why?     The king has Return
Fantastic create 💓💓keep it up,I'm with you
Why is cech playing?
London is blue 💙
someone shud have advised drinkwater to drinkwater and calm down 👀🤷‍♂️
That boy who wear helmet looks promising, maybe one day he'll help the first team to win ucl idk
Why is Mauricio Potchatino on the bench?
Why is Mauricio Potchatino on the bench?
Livramento baller
Drink water is playing with u-23
O my god. What a match! What a performance by the blues! 💙 I'm awestruck at how good a player Tino Livramento actually is.
YESS
6:40
Drinkwater shouldn't react cos he is a seasoned pro?? Wtf are these kids being taught?? Let's stop acting like Alfie didn't know what he did. He isn't a baby. An 18yr old at least
1:40:34 drinkwater go drinkwater
Petr CECH REGEN😬😬
Feel bad for the spurs under 21 cause there facing one of the best goalkeepers in history
One love lads
These two commentators are having a blast. Really good to listen to
Livramento solid talent but sadly like Lamptey there just isn’t a spot for him considering we have James
We basically have maradonna lol
cech
This Petr guy reminds me of the Czech  goal keeper we used have.....
Big Pete looks like estranged father who's trying too hard to re-enter his son's life, hence joining the son's football game.
Cech VIETNAM
The way the refs stopped the game to give away red Christmas cards. Wear Santa suits next time too! 😭
6:35 | Chelsea 0 - 1 Spurs 21:07 | Chelsea 0 - 2 Spurs 1:25:00 | Chelsea 1 - 2 Spurs 1:27:05 | Chelsea 2 - 2 Spurs 1:37:56 | Both Team Red Card Incident 1:51:40 | Chelsea 3 - 2 Spurs
lewis bate deserves to be in the lampard squad
Kepa should play for u 23 I think first he should train there and then come Cech to play with us
Cech out!!!
Wait what petr cech conceded 2that much goals tf
Mauricio Pochettino?? In the spurs squad, is he the sone of Poch??
Peter cech should have stayed retired...horrible pass that led to a goal.
Sad to Danny
Pls what are the timestamps of the goals
That’s keeper Peter Cech is so young and perspective
Levi Colwill, remember the name.  Reminds me of Thiago Silva in terms of composure and ability to drive the ball and pick out the pass. This kid is only 17, the potential is uncanny.
Peterrr
I. Love seeing Peter Cech keeping again especially I like him playing with those Lad will keep him more younger
that winning goal was wow
Why Petr is playing? Answer at 3:30.  Or i can just tell you. U-23 GK-1 with 1st team bubble  U-23 GK-2 was "given rest" ( read: it was done to give Petr a practice game) Kepa 2nd choice Caballero 3rd choice and Petr 5th choice keeper in the first team bubble, since Zigger is more likely to be call upon or above Petr in the packing order, it was decided Petr covers for the U-23 tonight.
Won the ball imo
Ref got those reds bang on!.. Two footed tackle followed by a petulant kick-out
Lovely commentary!!
This is my first time watching PL 2 Why?     The king has Return
Mau ngumpulin orang Indonesia...
Goals: 6:43 21:10 1:24:10 1:27:09 1:51:32
That cech kid is good, we need more players like him

Actually this game was more entertaining than Premier league :D
Bottlers @spurs
Petr Cech is 23 years old mdrr.
Finally Peter Cech is back 💙💙

What a comeback 💪🏻
Drinkwater is kicking out at teenagers in a U23 match. We're never gonna be able to sell him

Goo Chelsea goo Chelsea FC.....
1:24:10 Chelsea first goal penalty
21:10 second goal

Cech is greatest goalkeeper ever to grace the pitch of PL U23 football.
No.15 good position
👏👏👏👏👏💪💪👏👏
Well.done boys. Putting spurs at their place.
I think this Czech goalkeeper might have a future ??
It was a very nice game
Never be too quick to write off Chelsea wow
Surely Reece James won’t play tomorow that means if he did he played Saturday Monday and Tuesday 😂
Timestap for Drinkwater foul ?
Commentators are so annoying
Where is this football ground ?
Yes boys and yes big Pete
come on blues
Petr will be big one day
Just here to Cech in on a certain GK!
Drinkwater crunched a 16 year old 🤣🤣🤣 1:37:55
Woow woow 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Livramento is such a baller, hope he breaks into the first team by next season!
The commentators have no clue about football
Drink 💧 😭
At my school every Friday we predict football score matches and this week we had double sized sheet and oh boy I think I’m wrong- a lot
Livramento and Lawrence gonna ball down our right wing Give Livramento a chance on the wing abeg Bate is an engine, Lewis and Peart have great movement Simeu is calming on the ball Bell gonna rock
petr come ooooon
What a fall from grace for Danny drink water, England international + prem winner to kicking out at a 16 year old
👏👏👏👏
That Petr cech kid is something special
Marcel Lewis is good
👍👍👍
Come on Chelsea 👍🏻
