The other tragic element were all the idiots who went out there with their own conspiracy theories seeking subscribers. This was the truth.
"This can not happen to another family." And here we are again with Jay Slater. Its utterly heartbreaking.
The family’s speech choked me up - absolutely heartbreaking! 💔 😢
There seems to be a few being found in the the river I find it strange that similar things are still happening again they a found another woman and a man in diferent rivers
R.I.P Nikki a devastating loss for her family and friends. I must also say that the police and the outcome of the Events that led to her death has  Not been honestly and truly justified. There’s a huge population that believe there is misplay at hand. And a police conspiracy is also being thrown out there on YouTube and the videos I’ve watched do put out a good case for a new inquest into her death. Too many things just don’t add up.  We expect the truth and Nikki can’t rest until the whole truth comes out. An Angel that can’t sleep. Give peace to Nikki  Give Nikki the Truth.
rest in peace nicola bulley
Paul is such a bustard… the first thing he does - abused and harassed public. 90% of his “sad” speech is harassment of public and press.
Something extremely dodgy about this case
Given the VERY STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AN UNMARRIED WOMAN WITH TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS this story of a missing person should NEVER HAVE BEEN LET OUT BY Lancaschire Police who only have themselves TO BLAME. It is UNACCEPTABLE in the Anglo-Saxon World for a couple to have children and NOT BE MARRIED.
WhY DONT THE COPS OR DETECTIVES EVER FIND THESE VICTIMS...OTHER PPL WALKING BY JUST COME ACROSS THESE DEAD BODIES LIKE WTF.!!!¿??!!!
HOw did she get in the river ??
What happened to her?
👍
There’s no other suspect her death is Husband or Boyfriend
Wow a mile from where she first disappeared. Either the current took her or the killer took her away. But no one saw or heard anything?
Can’t imagine who would want to murder her or why… i can only imagine someone who knew her. Its often someone who knows the victim 😢
I don't know, but I think if a loving partner of mine was "truly" missing and strangers came out to break into buildings to help me find peace....I wouldn't be sooo ungrateful 🤨 Smelling fishy to me 🧐
Youtube high risk alcholic drunkard men and women who tries to kill each other
Her holy spirit be there now
I know what happened to Nicola Bulli ... She received injuries to her head and hands, she reached the bushes herself, she hid in them, undressed and was in the water for a while, then crawled out and died --- from suffocation... She did everything to avoid being found ... She was alone all the time !!!
There's no way the body could have been in the river the entire time, it would have had to float prematurely and cover a vast distance quicker than is possible in order to get past the wier. Telling the police that she is vulnerable stops an investigation of wrongdoing, telling everyone she's not in the river and to get the police to search in other areas, and then the body HAPPENS to be found/put in the river when the area goes quiet? Suspicious.
RIP Nicolla Bulley
At least she didnt take her children, she loved her family, but when depression enters the brain, there is no pill to swallow  to solve it, i myself know this, i thankfully woke up on life support, i had very bad delirium. I have now a book of what my family was feeling and there thoughts towards me, this case hits hard, as she must of gone through hell in order to do what she did, may she rest easy angel 😇 ❤️ xxx
Why did massive searc not find the biddy yet an ordinary menber of public found it easily??    Fmily background needs to be thoroughly investigated if she conmuted suicide ((fmily knew she ws uoto something(  wht led herr to it.     If someone commits suicide they dont leave a live connected phone behind, they are nit uncaring to leave their dog wandering i free in public area      The whole case is full of clues pointing blame on others not her. Moreover she was a nother if 2 girls, no mother however suicidal would want  to abandon her offsprins
ask locals if there dog went in after that weir where they would go to get it out
nicola dropped everything the second that willow fell in knowing that the only place to get him out before hes gone to sea  is the weir she ran for that hopping to save willow  and fell or slipped lifting willow out
MYbe Nicola hates Paul and wanted to die.  Bullying tends to lead to suicide. Doesn’t it. Paul
I’m listening to this and my knee hurts. Gosh I wonder if Nickolas and his mother has a knee problem Nicki
Maybe she was fed up with Paul
I hope they find out what happened to her.
The UK police have always been very careful with their words in cases such as Nicola Bulley having been missing. Careful. Very careful. Even conservatively cautious. I venture my opinon that lancashire Police has behaved extremely unprofessionally, especially the most senior officers and female too-an accolade to this day. They did let themselves down and can blame nobody but themselves. All I can think is that none of them have sat down after work and studied the most recent police manuals nor protocols or procedures. As to calling poor Ms Bulley alcoholic AND menopausal-at the very time when women police across the country are trying to have acceptance and understanding as employees and those suffering from menopause asking for care and understanding, it beggars belief.  It is my intuitive hunch that there are several strands to this case which flag themselves up for us, even us 'thickos'. Firstly, Ms. Bulley is/was a very intelligent woman. I always have much respect for women who are confortable in the financial industry-believe me-we are few and far between, truly.  This lady is 'au fait' with regulations, statutes, the general law, company law, breaches of law and consequences thereof.  What is to say that when her partner called the police on her as if she were a mad person-and many men are guilty of this(it is the testerone in them) and when police also went to her home with a view of sectioning her under the Mental Health Act, did Paul Ansell bother  to think that he had INSTANTLY ruined her CAREER?? It would be on record somewhere as soft information, if nothing else.   I hazard a guess that Ms. Bulley sought to make a legal complaint  against the actions of Lancashire Police Authority and they were informed. She was no drunken housewife on shandy. So what if she had a cocktail or two?  One only has the hearsay of the partner-not very bright for moving to ruin her income-generating career...Did he not have one too?  I hazard a guess that he had grudgingly began to clock her as to what amount of chores she contributed to in the home and he grudgingly noted mentally if she had not completely all the clearing up, etc.  (Listen carefully to his tv interview ).  If one is sitting around the house drinking tea and waiting to go to the gym and allegedly awaiting 3.00 pm because the United States are behind us ?? (are they by 6 hrs?-it depends on what state he deals with, then why did he say he ran upstairs as soon as she drove off- to read his emails? Can you be an engineer across the seas? How do you take measurements? Unless you are in such a senior job you successfully obtained by Skype interview? But then, the family would not have been in dire financial straits if her partner  were such a high-level 'engineer' for a company in the United States, where company law is very strict?    In my deepest being, I, following my deepest instincts as I always do -plus business and people experience- feel that someone did something to her. The caravan holiday business woman Penny? was always arguing with Ms Bulley to keep her dog on a lead and she, quite correctly, refused to obey this woman who pinned an assortment of home-made notices on the nearby tree warning  about leads for dogs.  Nothng in any of the more than TWO HUNDRED countryside statutes and other common land legislation forbids a person from allowing her pet to run around on common land. NOTHING. UNLESS one's dog is a Staffordshire Pit Bull, a genuine American big bulldog or one of the listed dangerous dogs.  So the Caravan holiday businesswoman bought chickens to allege that Ms Bulley's intelligent little dog might chase them. She then also bought a few sheep.  Therefore, with mind very open, I venture to state that all the Local Government Agencies are covering for the local female very senior police officers; which will lead to jail for perjury-PERJURY- in a case of a dead lady with two lovely young daughters. PERJURY IS A MOST SERIOUS OFFENCE, LEADING TO POTENTIALLY YEARS IN JAIL IF CHARGED, TRIED, CONVICTED  AND SENTENCED.  One wonders-do these Lancs.officers ever take CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING REGULARLY? CHIEF SUPERINTENDENTS AND THE LIKE receive mostly £200,000.00 a YEAR SALARIES AND MORE. If the Coroner fudges his FINAL report he can find himself in very hot water. This is my teeny little disabled, bedridden humble female COLOURED OPINION, crippled 38 years ago when I attended an NHS HOSPITAL UP NORTH TO GIVE BIRTH TO MY SON AND WAS LEFT FOR FIVE DAYS WITH BROKEN WATers, CONTRACTED SEPTICAEMIA , wHich after a FEW WEEKS ROTTED AWAY MY HIPS AND MY whole right-hand_side thigh, plus a cardiac arrest. i will never get justicE but AM HIGHLY QUALIFIED IN COMPARATIVE CORPORATE SERIOUS FRAUD IN FRANCE, GERMANY, UNITED STATES AND UNITED KINGDOM'S  CRIMINAL PROCEDURES....  SALLY RAMAGE, BA(Hons), MBA, LLM, MPhil, SLS, MCIoJ, DA, ABA, etc... AND BLACK. https://www.criminal-lawyer.org.uk/ I send my deepest most sincere condolences to Ms. Bulley's parents and young daughters and other relatives and friends. What a very beautiful, well-kempt bright ladt she was. Rest in Peace.
The police said she wasn't there.
Who ever did this will be caught
Fly high angel with other Angel's condolences to family x
How did she get into that water? How did she died? Autopsy please?
Very suspicious circumstances. Very sad.
How could Nicolas Body be found half way up the river bank When the high tidal range didn't go that high? It Doesn't make Sense or add up. I believe She was abducted from Allotment Lane, Held close by, then later placed Her body as an after thought as the police insisted she's in the water. She has maybe been in water, But it wasn't the River, not with that amount of experts looking in the same stretch over & Over she would have been found. She wasn't ever in the River.
If she fell in its her own stupid fault.
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Premeditated murder with professional hire
How Paul feeling and Paul’s kids
Very sad😢
And even in this case the police would still claim it's an accident and the murderer(s), presumably someone within the police's own ranks or some "minority" overlord, could just get away with the bloodshed and the dreadful pain they inflicted on this poor lady... Lucky God will still administer justice on His day...  Moreover I saw under the sun: In the place of judgment, Wickedness was there; And in the place of righteousness, Iniquity was there. I said in my heart, “God shall judge the righteous and the wicked, For there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.” Kohelet 3:16‭-‬17  Woe to those... who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent. Isaiah 5:23
Really, really sad to hear this news. 😢
Godbless
My Condolences to the family and friends May God help you in this difficult time. Our blessings and prayers are always with you... R.I.P BEAUTIFUL  🦋 🦋 🦋
I'd love the police and there association with other principle government groups to find out the real truth ,or do or kids have to wait 30 years for the truth to be revealed.  Tell us the truth instead of reading a pre writing  script.  God bless you.Nicky 🙌
Rip sweety
God bless her
That chap is in tears. People dont realize what strain they are under on a daily basis. Bless everyone who has love in their hearts.
Awwwww im so so sorry for the familys lost my thoughts with you all 💔⚘⚘
But what happened to her? If it’s not known yet, yes the press needs to leave the family alone, but the cops don’t. The priority is to determine what happened to her.
We now know nikki was an alcoholic... Was she intoxicated that morning?.... Is that why she went into the river and could not exit the water again?????
Can we stop killing each other? If you have a severe problem with someone, walk away. If you absolutely can’t do that, the problem is certainly with you. And you can exit stage right without killing someone else.
Oh no those poor little darling girls what a devestating outcome. My heart goes out to the family how horrible
Anyone notice directly opposite the reeds where her body was found there’s a lay-by in the road? It’s literally opposite the spot  Yet another red flag in this whole case
Isn’t this what Harry was saying 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 about the press. Vultures
Rachel Nickell, 1992 - took years for the police to find the killer.  This is going the same way,
We must check on Drink and Depression within our English Community.
HOPE THE RIVER IS OK
This story has broke my heart I hope the truth comes out and soon
So sad
Aaarrreee Bless her family and friends
I'm sorry, but I'm absolutely certain that her partner/father of her children killed her. I know about all of the, supposedly, "iron clad," evidence that he's innocent, and that he has an "alibi" and that it is "proven" by CCTV; but I just know. There are legitimate reasons, but they would take too long to add to this. I genuinely believe that, however long it ends up taking to be discovered, he will be found to have been the one who is guilty of causing her death. If it upsets people, it's certainly not my intention; however, I am certain that I'm correct,  as I've been, quite often, in the past.  I wish her children and the rest of her family,  much love and happiness,  many blessings, and much love ❤️.
I would like to add my sympathy to the family of Nicola. RIP. I hope they get a chance to grieve in peace❤
There has been an undercurrent of bias from the authorities in this case from the beginning that I do not understand. Seems others felt it and tried to put words to the concern we all felt. One of the reasons this blew up like it did. Why is this women so smug? Nicola lost her life and a family lost its center. I've been praying this case will get the help it needs.
Shame on those who accused the partner of wrongdoing. Rip to NIKKI
To the People of UK, I'm sorry you have lost NB.  This is so common here, to see such little activity comparatively to the US.
I don't understand why the husband is so offended that he was considered a suspect. Everyone knows this is a normal part of any investigation because most of the time husbands are found guilty of murdering their partner when the partner goes missing. I also find it odd that when the body was identified that the husband issued a statement as if the case was closed and everyone could now leave him alone. This case is not closed, nor should it be. The search is over but no one knows how this woman drowned, if it was a murder, a suicide or an accident. It is an awful thing to be falsely accused, but this death should continue to be fully investigated, and the husband, along with the "psychic medium" that found the body, and anybody else that qualifies as a suspect, should remain on the suspect list. It's odd that the psychic is reported to have found another body a few years ago. It's also odd that the police discounted the husband as a suspect from the very first day Nicola went missing, especially since there is no evidence of his whereabouts during the time she went missing. This man truly may be in emotional turmoil at the moment, and sadly grieving, and I respect that, but the door on his involvement is not yet closed. For instance, any investigator would naturally be wondering why his narrative included that he changed into his gym clothes before going to look for her. Of course it could be because he was planning to go to the gym but it also could be because his shoes and clothes were wet from the river. Now, no one is saying he drowned her, but there is no proof of his whereabouts during the time she went missing. If every suspect was discounted just because they said they were home having tea, no one would ever be held accountable for getting rid of a spouse. We all feel a significant measure of sympathy and empathy for innocent suspects and what they go through. It's awful, but we don't live under a rock. We know the drill when a partner goes missing and we should hope and expect the police to conduct a thorough and intelligent investigation into every possibility. It is fine for the public to respond emotionally and supportively to this family, but investigators have to think objectively and rely on facts and evidence. This case still has a lot of unanswered questions.
The police and the NHS would rather destroy the reputation of victims than doing their own jobs (which is helping the public, especially victims). Shame on the police authorities for destroying Nicky’s reputation and exploiting her privacy, rather than carefully looking for her body.
So sad Condolences to all her family and friends 🙏 😢
Rest in peace
So very sad. That such a horrible fate would come to such a lovely woman. I am so very sorry for the family's loss. Especially the girls and the man who loved her so dearly. When I see the footage of the river, I do not understand how someone could fall from the road or path into the river. Are their precarious narrow paths that run along the river? And being close to a bench means being close to people. I think most dogs would have gone berserk watching their owner drowning and sought out people to help.
Thousands of people go missing every year. This was a huge story why? Oh yeah, white, attractive,  middle age mum, in the country with the most gossipy press. Inept police should be the story.
It's just not sinking in hiw the police were investigating but still no body was seen in the river and then at a last moment someone spots a body. I think everyone should think twice and protest for this investigation to carry on as to how must she have got there. I feel for her family friends and most ot all her children. May she r.i.p and watch over her children. Amen
Media are absolute scum and those responsible should be named and held accountable for what they put the family through. And All the internet detectives and experts that were pointing fingers at Nicola's husband and best friend.. All utter scum....
💔💔💔💔💔💔 I'm so very sorry to see this 😢 RIP Nicky
What is the cause of death? Bet it wasn't drowning....
Rest in peace, from Nagaland ✝️ India
My deepest condolences to Nicola's loved ones. May her soul rest in peace.
It is so heartbreaking for her family.  Thank goodness they found her, and can lay her to rest.
Such a sad time!! Her poor family!!
That poor woman drowning and her family, what they have been through and such tragedy and loss. Let them grieve and keep them in our prayers.
I hope they are left alone know to greive and heal together in peace
OMG one more thing the met fked  up....
Why? How? Dear God it's terrible...
I don't understand how in reports you see the water running the opposite direction in which she was found. She was found almost one mile along the river which flows in the opposite direction to where she was found.
I don't understand how in reports you see the water running the opposite direction in which she was found. She was found almost one mile along the river which flows in the opposite direction to where she was found.
I hope Nicola's family can be left alone now and Nicola can rest in peace ,
You can't even get the news correct now! She wasn't found by dog walkers. She was found by a medium and his friend. Of course, the botched police want to cover that up to,  but ffs. Is there nothing correct in any reporting anymore?
I hope the police investigate her death. Regardless of her medical or social background Nicola deserves a full investigation as to how she died, ended up the river. All hands on deck, Sarah Thirkell forensic investigator is a good good start. Hope they do a toxicology, be thorough, don’t assume. Last week I thought about teacher Sabina Nessa killed and Sarah Everard. Taking a short cut or simply walking home at night women are not safe😢. I don’t know any of these women but we need to be the voice for taken victims. May they all R.I.P. I prayed Nicola was alive, that her girls would have their mother. I pray her girls are cared for and protected. That they get the support they need to thrive. It’s hard for adults to move past death, even more difficult for children who are beginning to understand life and have to make sense of something so tragic. So sad, R.I.P Nicola. Condolences to her family, friends and colleagues.
There is no way she wouldn't have been seen in that stream for over 3 weeks Why wasn't she found ?

Such lovely looking woman .Rest in peace

R.I.P.
This news report just needed to broadcast the statement.  For a reporter to just restate what's just been said in the statement is unnecessary.  There's no more to add
God bless all the family ❤
the media, once again, proves itself to be asshats.
It will get better, I no it will.x
Found by a Psychic using his intuition...let that sink in!!
Rest in peace ❤
Police said My trust to police 0%
All the news media, the BBC sky local news, so-called armchair, detectives so-called professional divers all need to be held account. So court dates will be coming soon.✌️💚
That still doesn't change the fact that there are 49million kangaroos in Australia and 3.5million people in Uruguay which means if the kangaroos were to invade Uruguay, each person will have to fight 14 kangaroos 😤
This is sad news 😢 condolences to her family
The "We will take it from here", truly broke my heart.
phone on bench dog not wet, suicide
The tabloid press in the UK must be restricted. Vicious lies are not freedom of speech
Speaking personally,  I found Kay Burley's real-time walk along Nicola Bulley's route last Friday morning on SKY to be an excellent piece of live TV journalism.   Her colleague's off the cuff interview with Ron, a fellow dog walker and the guy who came across the mobile 'phone,  deserves real praise. That one hour of coverage really opened my eyes to what might have happened, and led me to think that the curious no longer had need to travel to St.Michael's in order to orientate themselves.    (And no - I don't work for SKY news !)
BASTA YA DE GENOCIDIOS NAZIS VUELEN RTVE PATRIOTAS ES UNA ORDEN FIN.
Viwllwicht wurde sie nachträglich in den Fluß verbracht. Nur da ist ja eine Straße.
RIP
Contrary to comment from various authorities, I should like to suggest that much of the popular interest in poor Nicola's disappearance has indeed been helpful in so much as it's focused attention on perceived shortcomings in our UK police service.  The goodwill and determination to find her ought to have been properly utilised and coordinated.  After all, who eventually found the body, as if by accident ?  Confidence, not only in the Lancashire force, but in general policing is at an all-time low.   Priorities and resources need to be urgently re-evaluated, and misguided interference by woke pressure groups and activists, properly reined in.   If this requires intervention by the Home Secretary,  then so be it.
heartless
I heard there were suspicious men standing around where she was seen and me and my mother were really hoping that the body was one of their bodies but clearly, not, absolutely devastated R.I.P. Nicola x
Held accountable? , as distasteful as it is people can speak and say what they want.
Very sad and tragic my thoughts are with her family
Lots of prayers from Afghanistan to nici family god bless her kids😢💔
170 000 in the UK go missing every year.
May her soul rest in peace....my condolences to her family and all those who knew her 🙏
So sad 😢
So sad ❤️
Absolutely saddened for Nikki’s family, her 2 children, partner Paul, sister Louise and her parents and all her friends, may Nikki R.I.P. I hope that her family and friends can be left to grieve in peace ❤
I couldn't get why she's been a mile away from the bench on condition that the diving team searched all the way long the river!!😒 Something doesn't add up here.
It is to be noted that Sky and ITV have both blocked comments on this report.
if only she'd had some kind of location device implant, especially with been vulnerable, the state could have found her hopefully before anything had happened.
Condolence to the Family.
That doesn’t mean she wasn’t killed , why never happened something like that is because no one has mental issues!??? So what happened to her , she just fell in the river , is that your mystery solved?? You are delusional !! The public needs explanations, you can’t treat everybody like dogs !! People don’t just fall in the river and die !! You all are so disgusting
All those who said it was him ,shame on you.
leave them alone
english media are the worst in the world always looking for conspiracy hacks are just hacks
If she has taken her own life it is incredibly selfish knowing that she has 2 young daughters who need their mother. Hasn't she also been caught driving under the influence of alcohol with her two young children in the back? Hmmm
So sad news sorry to Paul and his daughters for there loss.
Sky and ITV should be ashamed😣😣
God bless, now she can rest in their arms, from my family to hers be strong and again so so sorry  RIP darling girl💕💕💖
extremely sad.!  🕯  🥺  ✌🏻🌏🇦🇺✌🏻
It’s the poor dog I feel sorry for. I wonder what the poor little thing saw. Xxx
Commiserations. But can we now direct our focus at the state of society that needs fixing and the existential situation of the planet, rather than obsessing over a single lost woman?
After all that police was right..  sometimes its not so wild and crazy.. sometimes mistakes happen . RIP
She was put there after the fact.
Heartbreaking
How did Nicola end up like this?  No answers there, just... leave the family alone, etc.  Just finding the body doesn't bring closure to this case.  Unprofessional.
Jesus Christ finally.....now can everyone move on from this, people were getting fed up of hearing of this constantly so thank god it's finally done
So the Police were spot on about what they thought happened. Maybe the cesspit media, who encouraged a storm of abuse about everything the Police said and did, should apologise and be forced to reveal exactly who was behind their deliberate campaign to smear them.
The family's statement RIPPING APART the DISGUSTING BRITISH PRESS was absolutely ON POINT! The media in the UK, and elements of the British public, should be UTTERLY ASHAMED of their conduct throughout this saga 🤮
Very suspicious there needs to be a public enquiry into this issues as the police did not do their jobs correctly. The family are upset that the media are intruding on their lives but Nicky's partner used them  by sending an voice note to sky news & a TV program while looking for Nicola. What a hypocrite you are. RIP Nicola your with the Angels now.  RIP
So sad for the family but so thankful that they finally have closure.
UK police chief should investigate what had caused her drowning in the river ???? & disclose it to the public & to the court of justice #
I hope they catch the black man who did this
extremely heartbreaking tragedy with gorgeous Nicola Bulley  # i pray to Allah almighty to bless her & rest her soul in heaven # Amen
Did she have punctured lungs? 😥
Love to Nikki's family & loved ones ❤❤❤❤❤❤🌈💖✨
I told you 2 weeks ago, she's dead 💀
😣😞
Call me an armchair detective if you want, but you can't blame someone from drawing conclusions from information they've had constantly shoved in their faces. I really hope the police keep ALL lines of investigation open, including the possibility that Paul could be a suspect. I hope the diversion tactics don't work.

So sad to hear this news about a mother who disappeared and was found dead.
So did she accidentally fell in the river or someone pushed her or put her in there? I found it strange the dog didn't jump after her...
One of the worst ways to loose someone
RIP Nicola.I wonder if the police will get an apology from all the arm chair detectives out there !
I have a picture of a man digging in the ground the day before Nicola bulley was found
Rest in peace finally. Leave her family alone they have been through a lot. Stop with the comments and what if .. or what went through her mind we will never find out and we don't have to.
I am so sorry for Nicola’s loss and condolences to her family, friends and all who know her. I am so sorry that you have to go through this from the press and tv companies 😢😢😢
Strange how this case got so much coverage when people go missing every day and are not mentioned. I wonder why that is?
there have been thousands of missing person who goes unreported and no news coverage . it good that police finally can bring closure to this family but i hope they do better and more effort done to find many more who goes unreported and might be bury somewhere and no closure for those family. 😞
Prayers Nicola. I'm going to pray for all your family. All was terribly handled and the media has acted disgracefully. Another family let down again.
So...the police were right after all.....anyone out there feel any guilt? 🤔
Rest in piece beautiful lady, prayers for her family🙏🇺🇲
Us it possible for grass bank to give way? Or loose underfoot.
Didn't they search the river?
Sincere condolences to Nicola's family.  Love from Queensland, Australia 🇦🇺
what a lunatic spend time with your family not piss your life away wait to see how she end up in there
🕊️🙏😢Heartbreaking😢...😔Rest In Peace Dearest Sweet Precious Nicola😔🙏🕊️
BBC AN SKY NEWS SHOCKING SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSLEVE
Jesus said "I am the way the truth and the life, no man comes to the father except through me"
Rest in peace I feel sad for the children ♥️
She was not important. The Ukraine war is more important than her. 😖😖
Very very sad…however she met her ultimate mysterious fate…❤‍🩹
It's not over yet PAUL so don't start moaning yet, because we all know you DID IT
My deepest sympathy for the family and her children.
Time to arrest Paul , forensically search the home and also arrest Emma for impersonation of Nicola
“She was the center of our world”…..wowwww
My condolences to her kids & partner.
💙💙🙏🙏
So sad…..What about her dog ?
One thing I can say here in the US we have had so many cases where mothers & fathers that had some sort of depression especially PPD and killed there kids then themselves but not sure if you heard of the Lindsay Clancy case from MA she killed her three babies then jumped out a window trying to kill herself but it only paralyzed her she wasent suppose to be left alone with the kids but she sent her husband to get food  and it only took about 20min I really believe she took her own life cause maybe she had thoughts about harming the kids 🤷just my opinion
So sad I feel bad for her kids my thing is if the husband didn't do it(witch i am not saying he did) them why was he not out looking for her? I understand he has kids but if it was my partner I would have family watch them cause I wouldn't stop looking day or night
Police were right all along. Who knew, shame. Hind sights a wonderful thing tho  Peace Niki xx
Reminds me of the 2003 movie "Young Adam" starring Ewan McGregor, Tilda Swilton, Peter Mullen & Emily Mortimer. Where Emily Mortimer's character fell into a river & drowned.
HIGH TIDE and the wind push floating objects to the waters edge. They didn't look thoroughly for her body if they thought she was in the water they screwed up the search. She should have been found earlier  💛💛💛💛🦮  1   Reply
Rest in Peace Nicola & my condolences to all who loved her.
So why can't the media leave them alone instead of carrying it on and not taking responsibility for the intrusion you continue to hound the family by. Each one of you should stop and think what if that was me and my family how would you feel.  The Press and news programmes have no moral compass between any of them.
Nicola Bulley R.I.P. my thoughts and prayers are with you and your loved ones Rest In Peace My Angel 😓😓
HOW SAD, so many people followed this case and hoped she would be found safe and well.
Yes it is sad and for all the other missing people  out there..never found..wake up people....
Yes the media are very selective  what cases they cover..what if it was your family  member..surely  u would expect same focus..??but most people  think this only happens to people  on the news..not them..makes me sick..
No words not surprised
Strange.....
so so sad, r.i.p. Nicola,    my love goes to her family and friends xx
Very sad
R.I.P Nicola Bulley but the main reason is how did she end in the river like what happened between the dropping of kids to school then walking the dog.
She was murdered.
My heart goes out to this family,  condolences xx
Poor lady, poor little children and poor partner and family. So tragic. Love to you all 💕
Devastating news. The whole country is feeling this. RIP Nicola.
Rest in Peace Nichola! Heartfelt condolences to the family!
I'm sorry but I still feel like the phone and dog scene was staged.
Far better poor lady found
Woman falls in river. Body found in river almost a month later. Apparently this was a "hugely complex" investigation for the police.
For all you influencers who made money from this, I hope you are all pleased with yourselves, especially the ones who accused Nicolas partner, you all need to start facing the law .  RIP Nicola and My thoughts & prayers go out to the family.
No satellite view for the canal from Birds eye showing wat happen that day ?
And the BBC treated this like entertainment and the police were a joke...forget about the fact that someone has died here...leave her family to grieve.
I am so very sad that this happened to her. I feel so badly for her daughters, partner and family. May she rest in peace.
My thoughts and prayers for her family
RIP Nicola. My thoughts are with her daughters and other loved ones.
So very sorry. May she rest in heavenly peace
the media and all the news channels got a few good weeks of clicks out of this, and thats all they care about, selling death as a csi style 'who dun it?' and it will continue, tune in next week to find out exactly how she died
I’m no professional so I can’t say if it was accidental or the poor woman was dumped there. But how dare people blame her loved ones for being involved. If it wasn’t for them, her story would not have been kept in the media.they where clinging onto all hope and have been nothing but abused. Think it’s time everyone left them alone now and stop being sick minded and trying to make on this tragedy. A poor woman has lost her life and a family has lost a loved one. Would you like this to be you? Think before judging please.if nicola’s family can see this, I’m sorry for your loss.
Sky news and itv can suck it…
I feel so sorry for them all, its just terrible :( she only went for a walk 😭
Devastating news 😢 sympathy to the family 🌹
Omg so so sad thoughts with the family give them time and space privacy
Shame on Sky News & ITV News! I hope they're held accountable for adding to Nicola's family's anguish & grief. My deepest condolences to Nicola's family & friends. You're all in my thoughts & prayers.
Now they need to prove she drowned in the river and that her body wasn't dumped in the reeds next to a road as that area had already been searched by divers.
Don't like dis every ting felt mysterious an strange as doh there was something wrong this situation was quite an i don't believe a word
It’s over now God bless her. The media should now leave the family and the reporting alone
TURN AND REPENT, FOR I AM THE LORD THY GOD ....KING OF THE UNIVERSE
Im glad they found her but the investgation must go on!!
... disappeared 27th of January, and no one (including the police) spotted her body in that small river until just a couple of days ago?
😭😭😭😭
Lo siento mucho. Mis condolesencia a todos. Que Dios les llene de fuerza y paz.
Its a terrible tragidy and my heart goas out to her family, but i just cant fathom how the police didnt find her, they had motorised dingies, drones , frogman, i mean its not excatly the amazon is it.
ALCOHOL......IT'S ONE HELL OF A DRUG!!!!!!!
BBC .... THE GAME IS ALMOST UP FOR YOU ALSO
Highly suspicious circumstances with the dropped phone ect.  Police trying to wrap it up in double quick time. We might never know what really took place. For a mother with a family and two daughters to end herself with no good bye note is not very likely at all. I would rule it out.   Possibilities are that she suffered a tragic accident. Which would be very unusual. Or that she has been pushed in the river in some way as a malicious act. Which means there's someone troubled who needs to be found.   Hope this family find closure. What a terrible event.  God bless them at this time.
So tragic...
God rest nicola
The newsreader is only after showing the footage of the statement from the family and within a few sentences, he misquoted what the family had actually said. the statement said, "We will never be able to comprehend what Nikki went through in her last moments." The newsreader stated, "...what was going through Nikki's mind... " Disgraceful. My sincerest condolences to the entire family. I had prayed for a better outcome. I'm so sorry that was my the case.
Sky and itv are discusting
Like the husband told you she’s not in the river , he knew she was in there all the time folks ! !
Well said the family
Just devastating 💔 😢 😞 😔 😪... God Bless her 🙏 family and friends.
So sad 😞 😔 🙏❤️💯
It's terrible isn't it 3 weeks of looking and dog walkers find her.. is as though it took 3 weeks of incompetence for someone from the public to find her.. yet there attacking people from the public that who were trying to get involved strange that.. I mean the police have said the family want everyone to just go away but she's getting more attention than anyone victim from the earthquake in Turkey.. strange isn't it.. yet you only see her face.... I wonder what else you see the face of this time of year that disappears.. conspiracy theorists should be ashamed of themselves for being so right all the time..
Mrs H .... I'm so sorry to the family... Hugs to the children ❤....RIP Nicola ...💔
God bless you all ❤so sorry for your loss ❤❤❤
That’s amazing that dog walkers could see from the road over a hill and down to river under a tree 🌳 or even walking that part of the bank and being able to see down to the tree and waters edge  It’s very very wrong that she was missed  Something very strange she was not found
Absolutely horrible for the children who knows what uncertain future their lives will now take after this.
Suicide? Murder?  Horrible for the family?  yes.
Don't loads of people go missing everyday - why did this get so much attention? Subjective question - I want reasoning
Well deserved denunciation of the Media who are the worst of the worst. Disgusting bottom feeders All. You should be ashamed of yourselves.   Heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the family of lovely Nicola Bulley. I am deeply sorry for your loss. Comfort and Prayers from Colorado, USA. 🇺🇸
On another video feed from the briefing there is a lot of laughing by people at the end as the police walk back inside. Can your film crew find out who it was. Was it ITV or Sky crew or someone else?
So very sad. My deepest condolences to her family.
Three weeks in the river, won't be much of her left 😕
So sorry to hear that Nicola bullys body has been found God bless 🙏 her I don't know much but her partner did not look like he cared if that was my wife I would be going of the rocker I would not have time to talk to the media because I would be going through hell  Paul to me very came with his black eye no emotion showed in any interview can't understand stand that as I said God bless her 🙏🙏🙏🌼 RIP WITH THE Angles in heaven.
Suicide.
My deepest condolences to all people that love Nicola 💔💔💔
My deepest condolences to the family, may she rest in peace 💐  Don't get all the backlash towards the police in regards to divulging private information, from what I heard someone was going to sell this information to the press, the police got wind of this so they asked for permission from her family to release this information first so they haven't really done anything wrong, no one should gain from someone else's suffering.
This tragic event "gripped the nation", for the main reason that it played on our deepest fears, that an ordinary day of an ordinary person turned so tragically wrong. RIP Nichola.
Sky and ITV called out by family as being unprofessional and intrusive.
I want to say something but also don't want to.  There are so many people who cannot deal with death,  and of course it is a difficult thing to understand. Esp when people are in rivers, waters of any kind... I wish the family won't suffer too much.   A key thing is the time the  police took to understand it's her.   In connection to water deaths.   I doubt she was "longer" in there.    But good they won't have to wait anymore to know...     while still... nothing adds up, not even  my thoughts.  As I said, it shouldn't have ever been in the public space to think about, it should have been on the police alone etc.  !
Please please check Connecting with kelly  Nicola Bulley  The channeling with Nicola  gives relevant information and needs to be investigated
The important thing now is for an autopsy to rule out foul play, otherwise the search begins all over again. Let's hope this is the end of the line. I dont believe her reputation is destroyed, her problems, so far as we know, are ones she shares with millions of other women.
Madness they never checked the river. That would have been the first place I'd have started
They searched the river so much the body, that they couldn't find her.🤔🤔
SHE WAS ABDUCTED MURDERED AND PUT IN THE RIVER AFTERWARDS
R I P Nicola Bulley The Underwater Search Team did find her not alive I was telling the truth all along it’s heartbreaking for her partner Paul Her daughters Harriet and Sophia and of course the rest of her family 45 That’s so young But at least she had a good life  1977 -2023
Where's all the armchair expert detectives at now? I suppose the new conspiracy is she was placed there in the last few DAYS?
It's so tragic, I feel for her children and family 😭.
Oh how devastating! Though there is closure now, it’s such a shock for her loved ones. 😢
So very sorry at the sad sad news
did the police search with heir eyes closed.
As a sign of respect why police officer not taking off his hat  to announce such horrific death of one of us. My deepest condolences to the entire family and community.
353,000 people go missing in this country every year - more than 70,000 are children but the country stops for this woman?? Hmmm 🧐🧐🧐🧐 👁 👀
How come police are not looking for her killers. She was killed!!
I’m so sorry. Rip Nicola. From the USA with love and prayers ❤
Has anyone seen the dog ? Maybe he fell in and she went, trying to see her dog ? I know I would.
Rest In Peace Nicola such a shame you left the way you did my thoughts and prayers are with your family and mainly with you i hope you are resting in eternal peace xxxx
I’ve never known such snarky police officers in my life. Can I remind lank police, YOU didn’t find her ether it was a member of the public, the very public who you told to basically butt out and leave you to it. No way on gods green earth has she walked that far away, left her phone on the bench and dog running from that to the caravan park gate without the dog following her or being near her. But again the police are that convinced and single minded in this case she’s not going to get justice or the poor family, god bless her. Oh and the search specialist that got called in, him who did the search, good on you mate, I trust you and know you did a full search and belive she wasn’t there at that time. You have the data to prove it so I hope you use it mate. Anyone who doubts you are morons, but don’t take any crap off the police like they are trying to do like I say they didn’t find her ether and they have been there for weeks, people walk along there on a daily basis you would think with everyone being aware each person would Be looking as they are walking but yet nothing til all of a sudden she’s there. Guarantee you something just doesn’t add up. I’ve kept quiet thoughout this but just can’t anymore, JUSTICEFORNICOLABxxxx I hope the police learn lessons but it’s pretty obvious they won’t with the snarky nasty way they have conducted this from the start. Please everyone don’t let her fall though the cracks, just think. What would a dog do, why was her phone on the bench and why did or would she walk towards the River, it’s just not right think back, one but if evidence to another and you’ll see were I’m coming from, stay safe all. And love and best wishes to them poor little girls xxxx
Oh so sad 😞 hope family is okay
May the armchair detectives and speculators please leave them alone from here on in.
Some journalists and some members of the public are no better than low life vermin.
And that is why i threw my TV out of the house
RIP Nicola. 😔🙏🏻
NOW LEAVE IT TO CORONER TO TELL ALL WHAT CAUSED NICOLAS SAD DEATH,,YE,THE MAN WHO HAS TO DO AUTOPSY ON HER BODY,BE LOOKING FR ANY BRUISES CUTS ,YE,SIGNS FR FOUL PLAY,,Here's one fr sofa detectives,,ye,if they don't find water in lungs,,,well,drowning eliminated,,mi,that will start them all off again,,so again, leave it to coroner to send official cause of death,,I believe it will be drowning,, go on detectives,was it by victims own hands or did somebody hold her under,,??any intelligent persons getting this??probably not so I rest on saddest incident of 2023,,,but damn sure worse things will follow,,it is corrupt Britain is it not??culture destroyed, gone insane majority of it,,jcvw
Heartbroken for this family, especially those little girls. Let us support this family now by boycotting the narcissistic Tick Tockers, the online mystics and morons, and those particular mainstream media vultures the family has specifically identified namely - Sly (Sky) News and Evil ITV. They have all added to this family's hell. Yesterday I saw first-hand how pants on fire ITV @Lorraine have edited an interview initially undertaken by GBN to twist the words of Peter the diving specialist in order to misrepresent what he had said. Shameful.
What a waste that this beautiful woman has died far, far too early. The family are in my thoughts & prayers.
R.I.P.  ....condolences to her family from Canada
Nobody, except the family, is owed any information or details. The only information released in these cases should be relevant details that may help find answers, e.g. person X went missing at Y time in Z place, or to inform the public that the search is over.  The speculation is absolutely unnecessary, unhelpful and downright cruel to people who are already suffering. I honestly think that anyone trying to "help" the police in the way described in this clip should be charged with obstructing the course of justice - what if they accidentally tamper with some evidence or contaminate a potential crime scene with their DNA? Yes, keep an eye out for missing persons whilst out walking in the area or check your own property for someone or something hidden, but anything beyond that is just unnecessary interference which could potentially hinder the police or distress the family further.
RIP Nikky.
It does not make any sense. I would not be surprised if she was abducted by a rogue cop - another Couzens. If this is the case and the Police find out, they would not want the public to find out it was another wrong-un from their ranks. They searched that river and didn't find her - weeks of searching. Then, miraculously, she is found by dog walkers. It would not surprise me if the cops placed her body there so that she would be found because they cannot let the truth out. What we are now expected to believe is just not credible. It would not surprise me if this is a massive cover up because if there is any rogue cop involved it will be the end of the UK Police. The entire thing has a bad reek coming from it and it was like that from the start - NOTHING the Police did made any sense and them finding her in the reeds is just more of the same. If I was her family I would be demanding answers and I would be asking the hard questions - I wouldn't let the cops wriggle off the hook on this.

How did Nicola die exactly?
Sky...had peo0le up there since day one; Burley rushing back from Turkey, somewhere else she & Sky weren't wanted , to retrace her last movements. Trash the lot of them.
So so sad yo hear this news. She was a beautiful person inside and outside. I have never met her but my heart bleeds for her and wished she was found alive. My condolences to her partner and her Mum and Dod and her children so so young to have lost their beautiful mum.  R.I.P NICOLA .
Lancashire constabulary in for some changes. Missing three weeks & a mile away. ....god bless you girl, & family. Seen the best & worst of humanity recently.
Devastating news for her family and loved ones. Hopefully the voyeur’s will let them grieve in peace and not demand details. 😢
😭
So sorry , prayers for family , friends, community.
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Sad but this is still an open case & must still be treated as one. Questions still need answering & the Truth still needs to  BE TOLD!
I feel so bad 😭😭😭😭
So sad.  Rip Nicola Bully.
Sending all my love and empathy to Nicola's family.  Well said! loved ones.  (How absolutely horrid that media and newspapers would behave in such a selfish, thoughtless, uncaring, and deplorable fashion.  May they be brought to suffer the consequences of their sickening and slanderous writings. So be it!    (Wishing you all love and caring and comfort in one another, always).  Thinking of you, here in Canada 🍁   🤗
She was put there. She'd be out to sea after three weeks or Im nut's. Or a idiot. I'd say I'm that
My deepest condolences for family and her friends, may her soul in peace .
Sorry for the families who are still here in pain and suffering God bless and we pray for better days.
I want to know about all the police involved in this case, I have a feeling this is a second Sarah Everard and there is more to this story.
Well wasn't it the public that found her in the end? So why criticise people trying to solve the mystery? And without the media interest everyone wouldn't have been searching?
😔 R.I.P beautiful girl 😢 gutted with the outcome xxxx All the love in the world to your family especially your young children 😢 xxxxxxx ❤️
How did she die... when did she die.. why.. because many people have been found dead in the water only to discover they died several days after they went missing and not by drowning.  David paulides missing 411 covered these deaths from the North of England.
RIP Nicola beautiful lady, you’ll be forever your girls angel ❤️ lots love from Scotland 🕊
RIP nicola
Ciekawe jak to się stało,  może  ktoś  ja tam wepchnął? Co z ciałem kiedy bedzie przeprowadzona sekcja zwłok?
So so tragic. Condolences to her family
I feel so sorry for nicolas family   but I hope that her family recover from this devastating news and also that is appalling from itv and sky if you have asked for some privacy to grieve then you should have the right to grieve without the press in your  ear  also why is it that when something like this happens the press  are all over it  it's just appalling imagine receiving news of her death  and  all of the press are asking questions like if this happens to my family i wouldn't want all of the press around me  I would want it to be private why should the whole world know  and also I am so saddened for her children  they must be hhearbroken I think now is the time that the press leave the family to mourn Nicola  and discover exactly how Nicola does in the water
Well I have mostly seen care and concern.
This is the saddest news since the Queen died😥
I feel so happy for the family that they finally got the much needed closure they need to move on ... I also hope Willow gets the psychological support it needs as well as  her colleagues on that Team Meeting who must have heard her final breaths ...
So the police were spot on all along.  Interesting. It's still a mystery to me how a fit, young, and healthy lady walking her dog ended up dead in a river. It's bizarre. Thoughts are with the husband and children 🙏 ❤️
As much as I have been a bit sceptical on some issues that has been raised which i am at least partially sorry for being so, this is still sad, hope the kids make it through all this with minimal damage, after all, it is them that are suffering the most.
Very sad. Of course, we knew this was coming. The family is not responsible, so people need to stop tormenting them with wild conspiracy theories. Have compassion.
I do hope they find out the true cause of her sad death and no cover up I find it hard to believe they couldn't have found her sooner there are a lot of blanks to fill in
This is the saddest news I've heard all day it's made me cry
The Police have still left a lot to be desired in their handling of this whole incident.  I am so sorry for the family and their sad loss, compounded by press harassment.
Devastating news. Prayers and love to the family
I'll keep the family in my prayers 🙏🙏🙏
Lancashire Police senor  an investigation should stand aside also some Bobby's. Im embarrassed total Failure.
So sorry Nicola for what you've gone through love and thoughts to your partner children and family god bless x
So saddened 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
My heart ❤️ goes out to you, to your 2 daughters,  fiancee, never knew nikki,  but I am so sad that this as happened 😢 💔 😞 xxxxxx rip nik. Xxxx
Why does the TV journalist need to read out and repeat exactly What the policewoman just said??! Duh..
This is heartbreaking 😢
RIP 🙏
My prayers go out to the family she is home though this is very suspicious
This is "Tragic".... I've noticed this becoming more and more common here in the UK! Sadly it seems that we just aren't looking out for one another the way we used to.
Sky News & ITV News have always been scum... But the BBC have acted much worse in the past...
The media are not to blame 6 thousand people go missing every year in the UK and are not found 2 thousand of them children the police forces need to work with the public and the media more
Despicable how the media have covered this. It ought to have remained a matter for local Wyre police & possibly local news outlets who may have been used to ask locals for any information. This was not, in common with the majority of what passes for 'news' in this country, a matter of public interest, being only of concern to the Bulley family & friends.  In a country where dozens of people go missing each year it can only be concluded that the media *exploited* this woman's disappearance, which now appears to have been what it was likely to have been all along, another suicide. No one can blame her for wanting to leave this wretched country, I say country, I mean inhabitants of course, Britain could be a great country were it not for the unfeeling rubbish living here that make life so unbearable for many.  Apart from ethical concerns, this media intrusion has left an indelible stain on St.Michaels.
Rest in peace Nicola.
How on earth wasn't she found until now ???
My Heartfelt condolences 💔❤
😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
Man this is so heartbreaking may she rest in piece ❤I can’t imagine what her children are going through 😢
So let's find out what happened.is it suicide or murder..as both outcomes have different outcomes
I believe she was murdered
Sincerest condoleances to her family, my prayers go to them as this is the worst outcome possible....may she RIP heartbreakingly sad 😔 💔🕊
The point ur missing lady.the whole off england was praying an grieving for nicola. Chief super pauline.
God bless
All of the true crime queens sharing theories over social media. You made things 100% worse for the family.
When she went missing all I could think about was that chef Claudia that went missing 13 years ago and was never found and I prayed that wouldn't happen here. I'm devastated for the family 😢 I was so wishing for the best possible outcome for her. Condolences to her family and friends 🙏🏽 ♥️💐 R.I.P Nicola 🌺
In my view the police released the private information as they were being battered by bad press and accusations of abject failures. A diversion tactic gone badly wrong.
Much love from Phillip Island . Victoria Australia ❤
Maybe if the police spent less time on Press training....
This is heart breaking. I really wanted her to simply be somewhere taking some time to herself. My sincerest condolences to the family.
Smells so fishy!!!
Why didn’t the dog go in river after her, dog was dry wasn’t it? Running around. Very strange
There should be an enquiry about the role the media and politicians play in high profile investigations. It would appear that the police had good reason to focus on the river. It is unfortunate that the hired underwater search team didn’t find her, but I would not criticise them. Although it did seem presumptuous of their boss to declare he was sure there was no one in the river. The media produced police experts who slagged off, with great intensity, the police investigation. Very prominent politicians rushed to join in with the media condemnation of the police for disclosing the detail of her vulnerability. It transpires this disclosure was done after consultation with the family and was intended to stem media speculation about the vulnerabilities. Lancashire Police , and in particular the investigating officers and those that dealt with the media, have had to face monumental problems from the media, a section of the public and politicians. It appears they did receive good support and co-operation from Nicola’s family.
Abit of shxtty job and unqualified officers you have if you didnt find her the first time round sir
Have to say not impressed by the police searches and river divers be it police or private. Excuses today about best sonar equipment used for checking the river.  A river with reed beds is not unusual and searching reed beds cannot have been thorough. Or she would have been found days ago.
I hope there was no foul play
I feel sorry for the police. They said she was in the river. She was. They said nobody was involved. They weren't. They just followed lines of enquiry. It is not their fault that rivers are hard to search.
❤
RIP Nikki...   As said in Daniel 12:13 New King James Version 13 “But you, go your way till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days.”
😥😪
The law needs to change to deal with the press and social media scumbags who think that’s it’s right to film everything and make up lies for money RIP Nicola
Rest In Peace Nicola prayers for your Family Please God be look after them  From Ireland 🙏🙏
Is she dead or alive
Mass reporting on one missing isn't beneficial at all. It only pains the family and brings unpleasant tinfoil hat wearing idots. There are plenty of suffering that's intentionally being ignored by these media ghouls. Where are the 45% of trans teens who try to off themselves due to the media demonizing them and other adult trans ppl? BBC, you know what you did.
Such a strange case how did she end up dead
Who ever killed her clearly waited for the police to stop searching the river then put her in there as there is no way they didn't find after searching it for days. So sad for her and the family.
I'm confident the investigation into what happened to her will be really thorough so we can be sure no one else was involved and this was, in fact, an accident. Her death is still a mystery at this point.
My condolences  sorry for the loss of  nicola kids and family and friends
So so sad. My condolences to Nicola's family. 💐🌹
God Love her, i will Pray for you and your family tonight. My thoughts and love goes out to Nicola's family at this very sad time🙏
Wow lots of ppl in this country were really concerned, don't hate the many for the few.. RIP.. I mean I'm seeing this is doing same thing, we don't even know she could have just fell in coat too heavy to get out
We have to move on now people,  she in home now in heaven!!  We must pray for her spirit now!! Please leave the family alone now please!!!
The husband shouldn’t be cleared just because they found her body in the river. He could’ve killed her and out her there or killed her bu putting her there.🤔
Rip Nicola Bulley, fly high rest easy, no more pain now 🙏 😢 deepest condolences to the family and friends during this very difficult hour of their huge loss
I agree media is going into a very dark place latelly and thia needs to stop, we still all humans and media has forgoten their boundriea
Good on the family for naming and shaming those news agencies. They are going through enough.
Condolences to aggrieved families...
this wont stop the social media detectives
RIP Nicola 🙏 💔  Will keep praying for Paul & the girls for closure and strength through the devastating grief this news brings. We all hoped and prayed you'd be safe.  Be free beautiful angel, we will keep praying for your babies & pray the media will indeed leave everyone alone to grieve privately and unharrassed.   Paul, my heart has been going out to you for days now. Will continue to pray God surrounds you with the right people at the right time for support day by day. Sending love to all of you. Sincere condolences to everyone.
Lots of prayers for you all. I hope God heals your pain and gives you the patience to get through this tough time.
Hope The Coroner’s Report Proves What Really Happened, People Don’t Just Fall Into Rivers Hope We Get The Truth…Or Will The Police & Government Cover It Up & Lie Again?…Where’s The Coroners Report ?
She should have learned to swim lmfao
This is heartbreaking , to the family, I‘m so sorry for your loss💔
Gutted for the family. The useless feeling of knowing there is absolutely nothing you can do to help 😢
So sorry to hear this terribly sad news. Sending love to Paul, their daughters and family and everyone else who loved Nicola. 🕊🌹❣
So blatenly it's the husband and her friend in it together!come on guys just look in his eyes on the photos he is evil
Sky tv and ITV directly called out by the family for poor conduct and disrespect......well that's Sky news. .
Poor young woman and her family especially her children   may she rest in the arms of the Lord 💔💜
I know the police are annoyed with public speculation and told the public to get out but the truth is, it were members of the public which found her where professionals could not due to the capricious, mercurial nature of water.   Nonetheless, the police have done a Stirling job and their praises should be sung and credit given where credit it due.   There is no I in team and the media, police and public have all pulled together to locate her even those some methods of the public searching have been questionable.   It is not one person's job when somebody goes missing. It is everybody's job because the fundamentals of a safe and harmonious society can only be accomplished if everyone works together to achieve the same aim without treading on each others toes.   When someone is missing there will always be undue and unfair speculation but that can, in some circumstances, help to draw out the truth.   It's a sad day.  Let the post Morten team start the thorough, thankless task of establishing how this occurred.   May Nicola rest in Peace and Mather family find solace in the fond memories they shared.
Such sad news 😢 I wonder what actually happened though? She fell in but dog would've gone after her?
police need to employ couple who found body , to train their hopeless police...
This is absolutely awful. The people that are trying to contact the family need to be fined or jailed.
R.i.p Nicola, fly high angel  x x
I love how bluntly they’re telling the press to piss off,  as they should
God  Bless to all your family Australia
BS
RIP 🙏 Condolence 🙏 to the family 👪
So sad  my thought a d prayers goes out to nicola FAMILY  R.I.P nicola.
Not the outcome everyone was hoping for.. I can not begin to imagine what her family are going through. She will always watch over her girls without a doubt I did not know Nikki but I checked the news every day hoping she would be found alive and well unfortunately this is not the case. May you rest in peace Nikki God bless you 💛
Why did she commit suicide
What about levi Davis any1
a beautiful lady much love rip sweet angel
BBC...is a British Broadcasting Company...hence it is called the bbc.
Whether in the UK, US, Australia, or anywhere else, you can never expect media like Murdoch and company to respect anything or anyone, including sticking to facts or even honoring their own word, if it doesn't happen to suit their other interests, especially sensationalizing viewers for bigger ratings and advertising dollars. Either regulators and the courts will stop them or they will not be stopped. They are a disgrace to the most basic ethical and other professional standards of journalism.
My heart goes out for the family and friends. She may rest in peace with the Angels 😢💔 Shame on you media, you have no respect for anything but the money and intruding to people's privacy
When youre married got children, this hits on another level.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
RIP nicola a beautiful angel gone to heaven . God will take care of you in his arms . My prayers and thoughts are with your family and friends at this sad time.  U will never be forgotten x 😪
Bloody hell i only dropped her off yesterday at sea 3 weeks on i lv the sun and itv news 😆 🤣 😂 i miss kissing them sexy lips 💋 after yesterday
This is heartbreaking. My heart and sincere condolence to Nicola's family and friends.
🕊️ 🙏🏽
The only relevant information in the less than last 2 seconds of the video.
We will never know what happened if you fall in the water, you swim and get out of the water or did she fall ill we will never know may she rest in peace
Comment sections turned off on the sky and ITV reports. Who ever runs them your a bunch of cowards and you know it.
😢..❤️🙏❤️..😢
I love how these media  nobs tried to pin so much blame on the police. Media covering for itself yet again. Never changes.
RIP and hope her family are left alone now to grieve. I hope those gutter press people can sleep at night knowing what harm and stress they caused her loved ones. So sad.
Before, at the time, and after, all elements involved, are all representative of where society has ended up, and none of it will get any better.
Something wrong with that woman she appears cold and detached im sure you dont need to go further than the family.
Very odd family statement   ...the dad had no issues with his own interviews and now he blames the media?
Get the f over it move on
Rip Nicola bully ❤. It’s either she jumped/ got pushed or she fell in the river. So so sad 😞
I hope she didn’t suffer too much, in her final moments, her daughters I am praying for 🙏
Heart breaking. Rip
R.i.p. Nichola Bulley... 🙏🏻😇
First time I've commented on this story RIP beautiful so so heartbreaking thoughts are with her family and friends and her two beautiful children
Rest in peace Nicola Bulley 🙏🏼💔
such a sad outcome. i hope some changes are made for safety along the river. there was a caution sign, but this is obviously not enough. cover this portion of the river with vegetation, continue the fencing so pedestrians can't get close but must stay on the provided trail. remove the bench. this is not safe for children or the public walking their dogs
It's a bit suspect all of this in all fairness
I note that itv comments  are all turned off shame on ITV and the police and BBC
Wonder what happened how she fell in the water what a strange mistery.ohh my God.hope the family  morn quietly now.
Knew this would happen. She must've accidentally tripped over something and fell into the river, and struggled to get out. Poor woman 😢❤️❤️
make no mistakes all the media , you tube influencers , nosey public etc have all been filthy scum ,, from day 1 the area was more visited than a shopping centre destroying any evidence that may have been needed , disclosing personal information that wasn't necessary , everyone in the country / world suddenly becomming sherlock holmes ,, and lets be honest about this if it had been a 55 yr old ugly white guy the story may have got 3 lines in the local paper
Shame on the media, when will they ever learn?
So sad i will never forget her face😣
Poor baby, she walked in such a beautiful area, yet seemed kind of scary alone as not many people were around. Do they know what happened to her?
I had sooo hoped that she had just gone for a bit of private time and would come home safely "RIP Nicola💐"
This story has truly messed-up my evening. I know how it feels to lose someone very close to you and how life seems worthless without your better half. My prays are with you. Be strong for those bundles of joy(kids). And i know wherever Nicola will be, she will look down on you and be proud of you and the kids. She is not dead as it may seem, but her spirit is right beside you. You just have to believe it and open your heart and you will feel her.
All you mainstream media outlets have got alot to answer for including you the bbc. Bullshittin brainwashin c$#ts!!!!. All you do is lie an push ur own narrative. Ur not real journalists. The medi an newspapers are supposed to be a reflection of society not moding an shaping it for ur own means. Keeper of mans conscience an hold great power to account. Ur discusting constantly lieing to ur human family. How do you all sleep at night. Just puppets of the government  you should be held accountable an be sent to jail. Ur promote division an hate an war mongering. You should all be closed down. My heart gos out to nicolas family. May she r.i.p.
Thinking of Nicola's family and friends during this terrible time.
I think someone put. Her there
RIP 🙏
his MAJESTY coroner???
I'm curious if the body was found upstream or downstream.

Hold that L
So unfortunate, really hoping they'd find her alive, wishing everyone nothing but the best
That letter from the family was heart-wrenching! You can sense their righteous anger and grief! Those 'Journalists' and TikTokers are a bunch of vultures with no morals. Anything and everything for views! There's an Arabic poem that says "The tragedies of some people are the benefits of others". This is sadly a real-life example of it
Nicola, let me say this.  I will remember you because you were a strong and courageous woman, who sadly, didn't get the help she desperately needed.
Rest in peace ❤
Sad day. Least they can get closure now. And have a funeral
Very sad 😔
The press should be held accountable. DISGUSTING. How dare they. Sky news and ITV. Disgusting.
Do we know what actually happened to her? Did she fall in?
My sincere sympathy.  I know with the Lord's strength you will all learn new ways of coping and loving one another. Abundant prayer.
Shocking world we live in
RIP dear pretty butterfly 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Feel sorry for her kids so sad
Everyone who made baseless accusations at the family can go screw themselves. Pathetic internet detectives.
Shameful treatment of the family. ❤️✝️🇺🇸

Rip young g
My heart goes out to her family and friends, now they can lay her to rest and hopefully will remember all the good times and love they had with her, sleep tight Nicola ur at peace now xx
I just don't believe she was in the river the whole time when everyone thoroughly searched in that area.
Sky News and ITV ... surprise surprise ... vultures
Rip and God bless your family
Shit
Search the river for three weeks, nothing. Now body turns up in the river. Cause of death incoming… could be a dumped body
Girls, your mum is your very own angel now, flying high and beaming her love down upon your family.  Condolences, love, strength and healing to you all.
Rest in peace to that lovely lady. So need to no now what actually happened for her to be found there. And how come she didn't have her phone on her. R. I. P and to be honest after this situation there should be cameras around it. And more fences by the river. But what husband says he's wife won't be found in the river. Has how would of he no that. That's very suspicious if you ask me.
Very big condolences to the family. My heart goes out to them completely! 🙏🙏🙏
Did some psychic or "medium" or whatever the heck help find the body after nobody else could? I don't believe in that bollocks he was probably involved in her death.
It’s all so sad, glad they have found her to at least give the family some peace of mind. May they get through this awful time.x
Piers   Morgan   is   number     one   to   be  asking   these   questions    QUEER.
I'm actully telling the truth u know nicole bulley i heard her screaming help me and my cuz was scared so we went to the bust stop then we quick went in and i told my cuz someone got kidnap
Now we wait to see if anything happened to her to casue her death. I hope not in a way. Poor lady. Commiserations never seem to be adequate.
100% more to it. RIP
shit happens
RIP Nicola.
Too many professional investigators ...Please, live the Job to trained  and experienced professionals.
My thoughts are with Nicola 's family and loved ones. Through all the negative speculation of shameful individuals you will have to live with this for the rest of your lives. Whilst you were all throwing negativity at this case poor Nicola had lost her life.  I think the police were spot on from day one knowing for some reason she went in the water. Willow may have fallen in and Nicola was trying to save her. The fact her phone was still connected to a call and the harness on the floor makes me think she has jumped up on an emergency.  I always said.We're ever Willow was found is were she last saw her owner as dogs are loyal. I hope they find another walk for Willow because she will always be looking at that last spot for her owner. Forever in the hearts of a nation that prayed for your safe return. Fly high Angel Nicola xx
Horrific but within a mile and they missed it shocking handling by all involved in that dept! 😢
This is so upsetting 😞
What about the police.... by giving personal information about that lady 🤬🤬 scum
So sad , my condolences 🙏🏻 with family.
Oh my God Girl I’ve prayed for you so much ,may you have eternal peace and love always . I’ve never met you or known you ,buy I morn your loss to your family and the world .Veronica    💕🍀🍀🍀
oh lord comfort the family and friends
Ok, which police officer killed her and dumped her body in the river?  Really weird how police speculated she must have “fell in the river” unless they knew for a while she was dumped there by one of their very own Wayne Couzens. Let’s not forget that her dog was found in a distressed state, if she fell in the river the dog would have jumped in too or be pulled in, however the dog wasn’t. 🤷🏻
Feminist's devastated that it wasn't a man
upon hearing this i actually cried..... i am far in zambia by distance but i am so close with her family.
Going into social media sites is like going into a sewer - everything is there. Those evil people who deal in such stuff in order to achieve gain should be heavily sanctioned and publicly shamed.
I don't think it was the family I think it was 100% someone that killed her though
What was the cause of death?
RIP Nicola , God bless , condolences to her family 🙏
My prayers and condolences go out to her family and friends. I’m happy they found her, though I had hoped for a different outcome. May everyone who knew her find closure. And I pray the family can heal from the trauma of not only her death, but also the violation of their privacy.
This is sad and very unfortunate for the press. My condolences to her family.
Poor soul , was found one mile away on the river bank ,next to a road running alongside that river bank , in an area which had been searched at leased twice before  . Yet was clearly visible by a couple of morning walkers !  It’s Just not logical ?  The body must have been recently  discarded  in that specific location by some one .!  As yet unknown ..I.M.V.H.O.      An ‘ On going-enquiry ‘  has to be investigated to solve this tragedy-event
God Bless this family.. my sincere condolences..may she rest with God and fly with the Angels...🙏💞
We grieve with the family and lift them in prayer .Father God ,lay Your hand upon  them , comfort them we pray .Amen
So she was found exactly where she was seen last.  The police was distracted by the phone on the bench. The body didn't travel from the bench area to that place, all the time it was there. As Paul actually said the bodies doesn't travel that far especially in the river with almost no current. But they focused on the bench area as the police told them...  It still seems a bit weird... who put the phone there or she left the phone behind...  Or after smth happened someone took the phone to the bench as a decoy...  Still answers needed...
They did not say "what happened in her mind", they said "what she experienced in her last moments". Completely different.
So so sad .
R.I.P Nicky. Heartfelt condolences to all those close ❤️
Very sad information
Sky news and ITV... Shame on you
The family's statement was spot on.  So sorry for their loss
I think the police wrote this statement not the family. The police is pissed with the mídia
That is odd, yesterday when the news broke the news updated saying it wasn't a female body found?! Now they claiming it is.. 3 weeks is a long time for a body to disappear, similar case the body is found a week tops washed up somewhere
Look at all the lives MSM  have destroyed Look how nasty people have become over last 3years
I am sorry but if people weren't that curious about her case probably people wouldn't find her.
i knew it.. condolences to her family and friends
Would love to see the post mortem results! Experts said she was 100% not in the river, makes you wonder if someone put her in the river further upstream! This whole thing still doesn't sit right!
Condolences to the family, all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio 🙏♥️
The police should be held accountable too. They failed to find her body. They published irrelevant aspects of her private life. Heads should roll over this.
Sincere condolences to the family. They look like very decent people. Nobody will forget this. RIP Nikki.
The worst news I never wanted to hear!
How terribly terribly sad. I had so  hoped she would have been found alive. Condolences to her family. May God comfort and strengthen her family.
I’m sorry 😢for your loss
Shame on you, BBC, the two people who found her were not walking dogs! Jason Rothwell is a spiritual medium who together with a friend, went in search of Nicola and found her. Jason also found Michael Brooks' body.
Like I said last week she was in the river for many reasons.
poor lady
Stuck up police ,who do they think they are !!!!!
Weird statement to make not knowing the the post mortem results, lets hope no fail play involved. Lets hope its not another open case.....
found after so long time under your nose...hmmm
No they did not .people were calling the police Not her partner ,get your facts right woman
RIP. Condolences to family and friends and may you find peace. ❤️
My sincerest condolences to Nicola's Family&friends and mainly her Mother Father Sister and Partner and Two young children. So very sad, Hopefully justice will prevail and the Family get some understanding and Mainly Closure of such a tragedy. RIP Nicola Bulley 🙏.
How did a couple of people walking by see the body ? But those in boats didn’t?  Madness…
RIP beautiful, your faithful little friend knew where you were. I hope this brings much needed closure for the family. Those of you intruding on the family's privacy need to back off and leave them be, let them mourn their loss!! She possibly would have been found a lot sooner without people destroying areas of possible evidence, this Tiktok FB trend of idiot's needs to stop!!
All this time searching and dog walkers found her! Police are useless.
what a shambles i feel so bad for the family i apologise about the other paranormal channels who have done spirit box sessions on Nichola we are not all like that some of us in the itc field have respect for the dead im so sorry so sad
God rest her soul. Questions. Did she take her own life, did she fall in or was her life taken.
RIP Nicola. Condolences to her family.
Sleep well Nicola ♥️🌹
Deepest Condolences to Nicolas family and friends. All the strength to her two little girls. So sorry for Nicola too, whatever happened I hope she didnt suffer to much in her last moments.  Lots of love to the Bulley family. ❤🕊🌹
Papers the public buy. Media the public watch. The press the family use to get their message across.
Oh no, I assumed that it was Nicola but it’s still shocking to hear it being confirmed. My heart goes out to her family.
Very intelligent Metropolitan police.
Who put her there if they checked the river and never found her very suspicious
Does finding her body mean that all investigation stops?  I suppose there will be an autopsy. Could the body have been placed there?  Could someone still have been responsible?  Telling off the media might be a bit previous
They were not talking about amateur sleuth in the letter though, were they BBC? They were talking about Sky News and ITV.
RIP Nicola
Prayers from Germany... I was following this case day by day and the outcome is just heartbroken. Rest in peace Nicola, we will find out what really happened to you.... 💛😔
Heartbreaking so sorry for the family. How Paul has been treated by some youtuber etc has been disgusting especially the guy comparing him to Chris Watts. I’m so sad for the whole family. Nicky rest in peace
Very sad.
I also hope that the press let you all grieve in peace now🌹
Will there be further investigation to see if there was fowl play? Is the investigation over? The river search team stated it was only 2ft deep where she could of entered.  However Condolences to the family and friends. Many thoughts and blessings to them.
Heartbreaking 💔 God Bless Nicola love & prayers to all the family xx
Rest in eternal peace now Nicola.  Sending my heartfelt sympathy to her heartbroken family. Mary 💕
Oh no😟May she rest in peace 🙏
Most overhyped news story in years, county news at best
So much for guaranteeing and positively saying they checked every bit of the water. Rest in peace Nicola.
When I saw the Sky News clip this morning, where they quoted a response from the dad, I was actually thinking, "Have they really reached out to him at this time?"/ Turns out they have. I find Kay and her team especially despicable. They have been very intrusive in their reporting. They crossed lines already when they identified one of the - to that point - anonymous witnesses on their live stream when tracing back Nicola's morning walk. I wish we would hold news reporters accountable sometimes.
Murder,suicide, abduction ? why if she was in the river was she not found earlier? whatever just awful.
Our deepest condolences to the family try and keep strong for the children😢😢😢🌹🌹🌹
If she was in such a bad way why did here Husband allow her to walk ALONE????  More to this I imagine!
God bless 🙏
Thank you to the spiritual medium whom found Nicola
It's disgusting how we as a society have treated this beautiful mother and her family. I know how it feels to be vilified by people who are essentially strangers and the unjust of it can break the human spirit. May her soul rest in peace.
WHO KILLED HER THOUGH?
Shame on the press once again, And any one who tried to put there ideas forward, Leave this devastated family to grieve in peace, I Can not imagine what they are all going through, And have been going through by all the hurtful messages they have had, Hope you all feel disgusted with your selves Shame on you all
Very odd this case almost staged nearly every photograph of nicola is next to a river asif to trick people into setting a scene would like to see older photographs of her and her family before making final judgement but probably actors masking a hidden agenda elsewhere
So so sad, RIP Nicola. 🌹
Disgusting Sky news
Damn this is so tragic I am so sorry for the family and friends of Nicola may she rest in peace, I can't believe she wasn't found sooner it is very bizarre, we now await the coroner and his findings in regard to whether she drowned or not the autopsy will provide the answers hopefully. God bless you Nicola's family and friends 🙏💛
She did NOT commit suycide and it is criminal to suggest to her children that she did.
I could of told you that 12 Hours ago instead  of bringing hope for the Family!  Totally Shocking!!!
This is so sad for her family.................
When someone goes missing the police ask “do you want us too go public” ie get the media involved. They definitely would of warned them going public will mean taking the good with the bad
Thoughts are with her family and children ❤ 💔 🦷🤍
Sad.  So now how ? When ?
how did she get there. how did we go from no body in the river to all of a sudden here's Nicola. Something really stinks.
still people out there are going to want to know why was she in the river in the first place but at least she has been found
RIP Nicola. Its always the kids that lose the most in these awful situations. Let's hope the media go and butter their bread with their own misery and leave this family alone now.
They must establish the COD ASAP.
My sincere condolences to Nicola's family...I am from the USA, but even I had hoped that this would turn out differently..
My oh My! The comment about the police accusing the boyfriend was a little harsh. The loved ones are always the first the police will look at. We are deeply sorry in our household for Nicola and her loving family.
Rest in peace beautiful lady.
Terribly sad. Rip lass ❤
I feel so sorry for her poor husband
RIP Nicola Bulley. May the truth be known!
A very sad ending but I'm glad that they found her cos it could have been prolonged even more. Condolences to the family sincerely. I hope this will raise awareness of menopause and\or suicide of which the hospitals are full and not much care is there and not much is being done. Not to cause negative perspective but surely they needs to be a question asked of the police etc as to how it took so long to find her body. It could be a very simple answer to that but it's certainly does seem to need asking? However at the moment it doesn't change the end of the story which is epically sad and all too often probably not such an uncommon occurrence for different reasons. I do hope this will highlight suicide awareness. Nothing is ever as straightforward as seems.
How can the media say the mystery is solved when we still do not know how she died??? Hello? what is she was killed?
oh boo hooo!!!!!!
So sorry for Nicola condolences  to her partner and their lovely children.  I cannot get over this very sad news. R.I.P XX
I don’t think exactly understand the media attention on Nicola.. people go missing ever day. What was so special about this one? She wasn’t famous, or important or anything. I just find it odd..
As the body has turned out to be Nicola, the entire nation now know Lancashire Police couldn't find Wally if he had gotten lost and I rank this guy up there with other retired professionals who has lent their thoughts to try explain what has happened in this case. As for the retired cops whose supported how case has been run, saying that missing cases are 'incredibly tricky' I'd say is an understatement at the least and the only good thing about any of them lending their counsel on this is that their NOT still police officers anymore  and I thank God for that, I really do!🙏  But regardless of that there couldn't be any excuse  to condone how badly Lancashire Police decided to conduct this case from the very start. Everything the police did by ruling out any third party involvement and other possibilities that could of/had caused Nicola's disappearance had only made things worse. As for the "internet sleuths" and the people of Lancashire turning themselves into vigilantes to help look for her, I really don't know how anyone could possibly criticise this in any way. At the start last week Nicola's partner Paul said in the interview with Dan Walker that he doesn't believe Nicola was in the river at all anymore and then detailed in full the things he wanted to see Police do next in the investigation and included a full search of all the houses in the area and beyond.   I only just actually found this out yesterday, but it was Nicola's friends who wanted that house that was closest to the river searched. They urged the police to search there and probably other places but that means Nicola's family and friends have been giving support to the people of Lancashire to take matters into their own hands, and rightly so!   The people that have been appointed to protect them have failed them, they've failed themselves, they've failed Nicola. And therefore things aren't gonna get done or done at a promptly manner then what choice did the people have but to turn themselves into detectives? After all as much people as possible looking Nicola was definitely a good thing.   YES, of course there's going to be people that advantage for their own goals but that happens in almost every situation, at the end of the day a vast sum of people chose to help with the search as they had the best of intentions. There may of been some with good intentions who went around trying to help in completely the wrong way in their efforts and because of this people think they should be then condemned for their actions, and some will even say prosecuted and also say that even though their had good intentions they should be punished regardless, but this can also be said for Police Officers!  It takes more than good intentions to become a Police Officer and yet people are employed in this role with even less than that and as that's the case the people who tried to look for Nicola shouldn't be criticised, at all! It's confirmed the body is Nicola, but how long has the body been in the water?🤔
Rest in peace, thoughts go out to the family and friends but it still doesn’t sit right with me as soon as the river has been said to have been searched every square meter and she isn’t there it’s weird that the body has been found in the river right next to a road, this will never sit right with me
Oh God !! How could this of happened ? Leave the family alone you awful media !!!!
She didn't drown in the river because the police would of already found her along time ago and also the river is not deep at all I think she was killed last night then chucked into the river thats why her phone was on the bench so she couldn't call for help and the killer left the dog because killing the dog would be a waste of time
Blessings to the family this is never easy SHAME on “authorities “ for feckin up & just worsening this family’s tragedy . Sounds like something in America the whole worlds full of incompetent inhumane asshats running the show. Disgraceful
Rest in eternal peace Nicola , condolences to your two little girls who will be just devastated for the rest of their lives .
All I can do is wash my hands of any association with Sky News and ITV. The only way I'm associated with them is watching them on YouTube. I'm about to unsubscribe from them. It's all I can do for now.
There’s still too many questions left unanswered
My heart breaks for those dear little girls who have lost their mummy. 💔
Thank goodness I live in United States of America where my kids will be thought how to use fire arms to protect themselves, my 2 girls and boys will not be sheep, I lived in the UK and Ireland and it’s become a land of open borders like the United States , the left progressives are destroying Western civilization, it’s a shame!!
No way this was accidental death the teams searched that whole river with state of the art underwater sonar equipment experts at finding body's in the water 100% certain she wasn't in the water and it would take a long time for the current to wash the body down stream... Then 3 weeks later a body appears I say we wait for the post mortem to clear this issue up. I still think it's been murder
so how could this happen , where are the answers ? homicide or suicide ?  RIP
💗 So sorry Nicola, your girls will cherish their time with their beautiful mummy forever 💗 I wish l had known you and tried to help you 💗 beautiful girl sleep tight 💗 ........donna x.💗💕☀
Beautiful Nicola 🌺 Thoughts for your family
Isn't it about Nicola rather than the family, that statement was incredibly rude to people that genuinely cared, the police are totally unprofessional in there delivery and shouldn't have read the statement.In fact a member of the public solved this case, show some gratitude.
She was such a beautiful woman...R.I.P
Aw man there was a small part of me that was hoping it wasn’t her but I knew it was. It’s just such a shame, 45 years old is no age to die. Her poor girls are now having to live without their mum, I hope she’ll watch over them as their guardian angel. Rest in peace Nicola Bulley 💗💛
Heartbreaking. No matter how this came to be her poor partner, daughters, sister and parents are clearly distraught.  Some people want views for money rather than caring for what a family and most of all poor Nicola were going through its disgusting. Rest in peace beautiful Nicola x
How on earth did she get in the river though?! RIP. Sounded like a lovely woman.  Edit.  That woman who was a family member/friend speech was brilliant. Fuck the press.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Unimaginable grief for this poor family rip nicola 😥
May you rest now Nikki although I'm curious how and why exactly she ended up in the water
So dog walkers found them not the 3 weeks of intense searching by police?! Very Strange to me
Praying the truth of her death comes out in the inquest. Condolences to the family.
Rip Nicola 😢😢
Well done bbc for not harassing the family🫡
I'm so sorry to hear this. RIP Nicola Bulley :(💕💕Hope you're safe and happy now <3
Memory Eternal to her.
Now the question is, was her body was put there after a certain time or was it there since she disappeared?
Something isn't right about this. Husband is innocent until proven guilty or am I being harsh. Sad.
thank god do we have to stop hearing about this now
this is so sad. how about giving the family some time and stop all the amateur detecting.
Condolences. Now we can get back to the news of why the PM sucks, who in the cabinet is getting sacked, the state of the economy, everyone and their grandmother going on strike, and how Brexit was a bad idea to begin with again.
Love and thoughts for her family and friends.
Very very sad my heart goes out to the family and the little princesses. RIP Dear Nicola 🙏😢
this seems like some type of murder. if it is, i hope we find the perpetrators as soon as possible!!
I wonder if sky news and itv will report how sky news and itv directly contacted them after they asked for privacy 🤔
So Sad
We were hoping for the best, but sadly, the worst fears have now been realised. I pray the girls , partner, and wider family will be able to find some sort of peace in future, knowing what happened, and at least not wondering if she is  still out there. Kudos to the local police, they came under heavy criticism for saying she was in the river, and even the best sonar equipment in the world could not find her, not that any of that matters now. May the family be allowed to grieve in quiet, and I hope they find some sort of peace. Worst is two little children don't have a Mother any more.
There NEEDS to be a public inquiry into this shameful mess!
People were speculating in a very sensitive area . such a shame
Best place to hide a body is where it's already been searched.. This is a murder investigation and that's why it took so long for the authorities to confirm who it is.. 🙄
Everyone please let's try and talk about mental health we know we all have our personal personal struggles with what is going on in society with other own family and friends and our own children this should not be tolerated there a a few selected shadows in the background that foresee our suffering this will only continue to worsen the more we choose not to see it is time to wake up against this darkness this suffering we need to stop the hate bring genuine love and consideration for one another I love yall may the almighty creator look after Nicola and all connected with her rest in peace sleep well 🙏
Heartbreaking. My prayers go out to her family and her children especially. This has been so tough to hear about.
Prayers go out to her partner 2 daughters and friends and family.....#RIPNICOLA
Her husband killed her
SUICIDE??????
How on earth they couldn’t find her in 3weeks under their nose?
Seems to be a big fuss about personal details revealed, but for someone like myself, who considered this could be suicide at the start before knowing those details, I would have then thought that she would walk further towards deeper water to commit the tragic act. Not many people throw themselves into 2 feet of water. It's very likely the person would walk to deeper water. Should have revealed the details immediately as it's important information / evidence linked to potential self-harm. Shame on the trolls and anyone else who has upset the family or friends.
God bless I am completely gutted and just lost for words ❤
God bless all family forth most and friends and people who new her.. Thank you all in search of her you are hero's.RIP nicola..🙏🙏🙏
My deepest condolences to the family from Wisconsin USA
bet she was toy
Very sad. Rip.xx
Could be murder and body taken back after area searched.
Oh that is sad... Was really hoping she would be found. Devastating to her family. R. I. P ♥️♥️
MCUK sends out thoughts and sympathies to Nicola's friends and family. R.I.P
❤️‍🩹
Media are 🐀 absolutely disgusting behaviour!
Press intrusion No the scum who swallow and buy the crap the  Press feed them The press are like drug dealers feeding junkies nobody forces a junkie to buy their shit Don't blame the press blame the customer
The police have let her, her family and so many others down for too long now! They’re just gonna sweep this up so they don’t have to do any work like usual
Heartbreaking news for her family... RIP Beautiful lady 💔
My deepest condolences to her family and close friends. Their family doesn't deserve this
Rip ❤️ my condolences to her family and friends 🤜🏻🤛🏻
Condolences to Nicola and the family 💔. I feel heartbroken for her to girls and the family and friends 💔. RIP Nicola ⚘️❤️
Prayers and condolences for the family- heatbreaking
Nicole reputation is not ruined. We understand being 45 depressed, menopausal issues and alcoholism a common disease, February in the English country can be dreary, dealing with COVID  for the last three years, it’s been a difficult period of time. If Nicole only knew how many truly cared fir her.
Awful tragedy but so many unusual aspects to the way her case dealt with....If they searched the shallow river how did they not find her?A body would not take over 2 weeks to show up in a shallow river surely? It seems her disappearance was not looked into as fully ass it shoukd have been for some reason. Her poor children
Rip 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
I'd love to be a fly on the wall at Paul Ansell's house at this point. I bet he's shitting himself.
I thought the private divers said she couldn't possibly be in the river, and the police had already searched there.  I think there were too many armchair detectives in the UK.  I can't imagine how heartbreaking this is for the family, and especially having to tell her children.
River and surrounding areas searched extensively for weeks then she suddenly turns up; highly suspiscious!
Tragic accident? Suicide? Homicide? 😳😳😳
Very Sad news for us here in England and worldwide, prayers for The Family🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Tragedy pimps on YouTube and social media   Leave this family alone you pack of sick Trash    RIP Nicola💞💞
nice of them to get joe 90 to present the program
Astounding, the vile and contemptible comments made in this comment section.  Heartless and disrespectful.  A pity that shame & decency has apparently gone out from societal use.
Tragic news. Condolences to the family. How odd that they gave a statement for the Police to deliver which was not about Nicola until the end where they said, finally Nicola ........who drafted that statement 🤔
having listened to the original interview of a gentleman who touched me deeply  with his obvious love respect but above all fear concerning someone he obviously understood at kevals he did not disclose & the poignant derail regarding the eae if that mornings rituals . That remark remained with me particularly once SM & Invasive " experts " outside those who truly knew exactly what & how to to cope with this complex situation .Ayt this moment in time I reside across a grey ocean where a case has gathered similar incursions from experts particularly one female '" reporter " who has endless experts daily & it has made me ever more determined not to belong to the increasingly dangerousmillye if SM poison .Therefore the remarks are regarding Sky , ITV etc are way past necessary & the fact that our PM etc lack the intellect let alone sensitivity not to refrain from such. immature remarks shames me deeply .  It is far past time that we understood basic trnnants
It still doesn't make sense.
How tf u fall in the river was she cripple or nah
💐
RIP Nikki 😢🙏🏼🙏🏼
you shithouse rats
People go missing everyday i dont really get why this is getting plastered over the internet
SO bad and hard breaking for a family at that time from her death RIP Nicola you will be missed   😪😪😥😥😭😭
Rest in peace Nicola.  Sending love to all her family and friends. I'm so sad for your loss, but glad you've finally got some closure.  May love be with you always ❤️
Such sad news. Condolences to the family <3
RIP Nicola, I didn’t know you as a person but after all the publicity I feel lost and sad! I can’t ever imagine what you went through, I feel so sorry for the children! Not only for loosing there mum but for all the things that’s been publicised on tv and wrote online!! This whole situation is heart wrenching!! I just hope you found your happy place with the angels in the sky!! I know you will be looking down and helping your kids through life with that big smile!! RIP brave lady ❤
Condolences to the family of Nicola 💔 May you Rest In Peace now. 🙏🏼🙏🏼  A beautiful heart no longer on earth, but a Beautiful heart Angel will God Now ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼 R.I.P Angel ❤💛🙏🏼
Again, as I said when they found the body ~ RIP to all those YouTube channels who named their channel after her hoping this would grow into a conspiracy theory that would have got them views and subs for a long time. To all of you who took advantage of this case because you watched a few seasons of CSI and thought you could undermine  the police as if you had more information than them, they had to release personal details about Nicola not just because of the papers but because of all the youtube detectives who try and cash in on these sorts of things, shame on y'all it shouldn't be allowed. The sooner youtube and social media as a whole does away with comments the better, the only way I can see it being done the correct way is that you have to use your real name, country you are from, real photo and address and all this needs to be seen by people you talk to, except the address just photo, name and country and all needs to be confirmed.  I believe if social media wasn't invented then something better could have came along. Even just having a search engine that isn't biased and gives you factual answers and youtube without comments was enough, which means the search engine you could only ask questions with factual answers, then I believe we would all be much smarter.    My sincere apologies go out to the family for what you had to hear from the papers and public, hopefully silence falls upon you now and you get to go through the grieving process now with your true friends and family.
The press/media will never stop their hounding of ordinary people who through no fault of their own are flung into the spotlight by tragedy.
My Deepest condolences to Nicola’s family and friends  RIP 🖤🤍💐🙏🏻
We are all in tears.
Interesting that most of the families speech was about the press 🤔 seems like it was well prepared
RIP Nicola! Deep prayers & sympathy to her family from Austria!
I am a middle aged mother who has been through very similar issues and I think it is a good thing her issues are out there.Women are having children much older then hitting menopause whilst having a career and small children.Whatever all the mental health bumf tells you it is lip service.the help is not out there for anyone let alone menopausal women.They are last in the queue.Her case has inspired me to do a mental health first aid course and I hope to use it to help people in their darkest hours .I too turned to drink as my only source of comfort.
How did the original underwater search team miss it ?
Talk is cheap, too late, no urgency what so ever, never cornered off the whole place,  vile like the BBC, WHO PROTECTED JIMMY SAVILLE !!!!!  SHAME ON THE BBC , MP'S POOR POOR ENGLAND,    MORE RAPES DEATHS ARE ON THE WAY, BECAUSE OFF WEAK WOKE STAINS IN OFFICE,
Husbands still guilty
So sad! Praying for her family now to find out what happend
This is so sad rip God bless her family
Shit show of an investigation from the get go.The police moaning about the public speculating online what did they expect, your always going to get that they didnt have a scooby do from the start what happened to her
Sad😥
What an outrage. The press were instrumental in spreading the news which actually went around the world. Like everybody they hypothesised and theorised about what could have happened. The family and friends issued a statement saying that the police were wrong to believe she drowned in the river. The whole country was hoping for a happy ending. Nobody wanted this story to end like this so it is extremely ungracious and disingenuous to launch a vitriolic attack on anybody - the police or the press.
Ha
RIP Nicola. Really inappropriate to hear giggling from the press pack after the police had gone.
HOW DUMB and nasty were those p i g s, messed up big time, then slag off the woman, too excuse THEIR FAILURES , JESUS CHRIST, up north AVOIDING HELPING ALL THOSE GIRLS TOO UP NORTH, WOKE WEAK PATHETIC, SHAME ON THEM , THEY NEED TO BE SUED
Utterly shameful of some of the media. I hope the family can now be left in peace to grieve😔
Rip beloved 🕯
But how did they miss her in a river that was knee high? Still don’t feel like this is over
Shame to all those who accused her husband because he showed no emotion in the interview.  I hope you learn to not judge others that easily. And the police should receive an apologize as well as they always believed she was in the river
Very, very sad.  May GOD comfort her family and especially her beloved children.
They still have no idea how she ended up in the river or do they?
Sincerest condolences to the family and hope they get closure.
decades ago I realized that the advent
any explanation of her death?
What a way to go eh, top marks
It was the public who in the end had to find her because the police are so useless.
Most unfortunate.
Police couldn't find her but a random person did. Terrible work by the met
This very sad unfortunate case has various similarities  with the Madeline McCann case as regards unnecessary press and public intrusion .  Both became a circus / sideshow for main stream and social media too gorge on like a excessive meal , all parties that intruded could maybe be prosecuted. Problem is that would only add to Nicola's family grief , the staggering stupidity / lack of respect is beyond belief.   This case will now move into another phase of investigation and hopefully speculation around it will now cease , let her be .
Absolutely all this media running and taking charge of the stories, and all these online detectives as well as haters, have added the sadness of this family. On the other hand thank goodness she has been found. The family will find closure, may she rest in peace.
I want to add that her husband was so adamant that she wasn't in the river, I genuinely think that he  and her so called best friend are hiding something. It's almost like he didn't want them to find her because he was sacred of being found out. I do think that the police are looking into these two, but there is something so off about them, the way they speak about her, act and their body language. I hope that Nicola and her family can get justice as this is horrible and my condolences go out to her two boys and her family.
The question is now how did she end up in the River case I don't know it was suicide because that doesn't make sense because arranging play date's with the kids and being on a work call with the phone still being on doesn't add up to suicide.
My dearest....Condolences too the family, friends, neighbors, searchers, social media and police dept. RIP Angel. Oh I feel for her Husband and Children. May God bless her Soul. 🙏🏾 🙏🏾 😍 ♥ ♥
So sorry, my deepest condolences to the family.
The statement saying how vile the media was....  The media : "We are goin to milk this story for another 4 weeks for profit and clicks"
Told ya it was not the hubby !
To Nicolas family,may I offer my sincere condolences .
The investigation has not ended because Nicola’s body is found. There are many un answered questions that hopefully the autopsy will reveal and may need to be verified further until Nicola’s movements that final morning are thoroughly pieced together at the inquest. This is a sad sad time for the family but the police and the media need to understand that peace and acceptance can only happen when the truth is known. May they know the truth of what happened and get the peace they deserve 🌹💔🙏🏻
My prayers go out to all the family at this difficult time.God bless.
RIP Nicola 💔
To everyone that has made jokes, or said she probably ran off with someone she's having an affair with, or said she's probably hiding somewhere and too drunk to go home, or said the husband probably murdered her. I couldn't be any more genuine when I say I wish it was you that was found dead in a river. You are all absolute fuckin disgraces that don't deserve to breathe the same air as the rest of society.
Why not rule out foul play ? Is it because you want to label a wave of responses by genuinely concerned critical thinkers ‘armchair detectives’ …bit of divide and conquer as usual….people love a label. It helps the sheep join the side of those who think for them. Look out for new legislation on press / internet censorship. In fact , Suella is already trying to ram legislation through , even though they haven’t mentioned foul play. What does she know already?
My heartfelt condolences to the family
Why do I find this release nonsense, it's a disgrace.
I am so sad
My deepest condolences to Nicola's Family & Friends ❤️ Also to Willow that also is a victim in this awful tragedy ❤️ To Nicola Rest In Peace Im So Sorry ❤️🙏❤️
Brilliant police! Great work. Well done, Lancashire police. I don't know how you do it. It must be so very hard. Thank you.
🖤
But what actually happened to her? Suicide? Accident? Foul play? We still don’t know.
I was hoping they find her in a better condition, this is sad but at least now the search is over though not in a nice way. May she find rest, I can't imagine what she went through to be found in that position 😔😔condolences to the family
Heartbreaking. Not much help to say I feel for you so much but I do and sincerely offer my condolences.
May she find peace
Ohh That's Very Sad, May Her Soul Rest In Peace, My Condolences To Family And Friends 🙏
The police should have found this woman weeks ago. I can’t believe they never looked one mile down the river, and more disgustedly that she was found by a member of the public.  All this unnecessary suffering for the family! What kind of police force is this? RIP Nicola Bulley and Family Condolences!
I wonder how she went missing? RIP
How could this happen? Did she just fall into to river or was there fowl play. Was the water so cold she couldn't get out. There's still questions I feel. This is so so sad. I pray for the family and her children.
RIP to this lassie and condolences to her family who must be devastated.  My question is how on earth is it possible to search for 23 days to effectively miss her? There seems to be a huge amount of incompetence by the police and to report her personal issues was absolutely uncalled for. Questions must be answered.  As for the circus that the MSM created, unfortunately that's a reflection of today's society when accuracy goes out the window just to be first with a story to make money.   Again,  RIP.
Rest in peace, hopefully they find the truth from examing her body, I truly don't believe she took her own life when half an hour before setting up a play date with her best friend 🙏🏽
I ask myself, if I had the guts to leave my much loved dog on the bank looking at me loyally, and make that jump then as sure as eggs are eggs that dog  particularly that breed, would have been right in behind me, yet it didn't.  That is what say's to me not suicide.  I have not commented on this before as it is too sad but I think the dog holds the key.
So tragic. RIP Nicola. Sympathies to her family.
U don't leave your phone on a call the put it on bench and she was h7gh risk well if that case why it other times then they blam7ng but them selves I bet the family won't understand like the dog would of gone in after her plus let it forget she was a good swimming like and the interview was at the mate house why plus the tatty red can was in back ground wait till they let us know what she rally die I get I would be drowning
at least shes been found,Also such a real shame is bad news,I don't carry on comment on this any more really after the last 3 weeks worth been trying to help solve this case,Also up sets me nearly every time after what me and my family went through 20 years ago,Bringing back bad memorys,I know how her friends and family are feeling right now,Takes time to get over it,Thats also why my heart goes out to her family and to her two children as well,At least she has been found now,Now its time to get her to rest of peace when the time comes,Still not the point,Nothing much else can be done,Be nice if any one could bring back the dead would be nice,It don't happen....R.I.P Nicola sleep tight,Hope heaven is treating you well x
Cannot imagine the last moments you were going through Miss Bulley. Rest in Peace. My thoughts are with your friends and family at this hard time 🙏🏻😭
Ne Obliviscaris
Don't drink right next to a river
Rip nicola, I still don’t understand why the husband didn’t do more for his wife and i mean by help finding her, lets be real if it was any of our wives that went missing we would be searching day and night to retrieve are loved one and i hate how the blame the public, one the public stumbled across the body two your experts said 100% she aint in the river. Dont you date pin it on the public. As for nicola rest well your girls and family will miss you MORE than your husband
All those including the media who have said such awfull things...just sit and have a little think if that was you right now having to tell your little ones this sad sad awfull news.....  just have a little think and let this family get through this. My heart goes out to them. R.I.P NICOLA . how they have been treated is nothing more than.. DISGUSTING
This is terrible news may she rest in peace. I don't understand how she was found only a mile away by dog walkers when the police 'thoroughly' searched the area. A terrible disservice
Awful news. The police need to take a good look at the way they conducted themselves in this case. MSM should be ashamed of themselves.  My condolences to the family. Let them grieve in peace.  London
So very sorry , heartbreaking my prayers are with all the family & friends , God Rest in Heavenly Peace beautiful Lady 🇨🇦
So very sad.😢Condolences to Nichola's Family.Rest in peace Beautiful lady 🙏🏼😞
Why is no one talking about the massive caravan park next to where they found the corpse?
So sorry to hear about nicola
14 people go missing everyday in the UK that will never be seen again. Now she’s gone maybe make a fuss about the hundreds of missing people since she died
Condolences to the family and friends.
They hiding a lot police
How did multiple searches of said river miss a body less than half a mile away from where she disappeared?
This case is very strange smth is smelly
:(
So was it suecide or murder?
So sad 😞
Rest in peace Nicola . My deepest condolences to her family and friends.
So sad to hear this. Yes the ghouls in the media and social media have been disgusting in their comments during the time this family were being put through the ringer while their loved one was missing. I despair of people sometimes. Maybe give your head a wobble and find another way to spend your time, you horrible, horrible people.
In her memory -  And then I heard the angel say, ‘She’s with you every day.’” – Author Unknown “The sun, the moon, the wind, the stars, will forever be around, reminding you of the love you shared, and the peace she’s finally found.” – Author Unknown “Once upon a memory someone wiped away a tear, held me close and loved me, Thank you, dear.” – Author Unknown “Say not in grief ‘he is no more’ but in thankfulness that he was.” – Proverb 😥😥😥😥
Bless rip thoughts with family & friends . Xxx
So sad, I honestly thought she would turn up alive. Her loved ones must be devastated. Sending love & prayers!
Everyone who was speculating, accusing the husband and the friend, YOU are responsible for this poor families horrendous experience throughout all this. As if having a family member go missing isn't bad enough, you then have to make it even worse. YOU will have that on your hands for the rest of your life. YOU are scum and vile and you spend far too much time online. Go outside and get a life because the one you have online is disgusting.
We will take it from here now we no longer need ur help or to keep the story in the public eye. I love that.
Big condolences to nicola Bulley family i'am really sorry that the social media Viper's did not leave u all alone to grieve in your time of need.
So i assume the investigation is over? Are they sure there was no foul play?  So sad for her babies and family.
The bloke with all the useless sonar equipment said she was not in the river.  What a waste of time!
Judging by forensics, how long was she in the water. Why didn't they find her earlier. A professional diver and respected search person said she wasn't in the water. Complete and utter useless search. Tabloids are disgusting. Press are vermin.
Deepest condolences to her family and friends. RIP Nicola.
Heart breaking news  :(
How very sad sincerest condolences to all her family rest in peace Nicola was hoping you would be brought home safe thoughts and prayers from Ireland 🙏💔
BBC: working class girls get pumped and raped for 20 years.  Silence.   Middle class middle aged white women dies:  candlelit vigils.  Sarah everard.  This one.    They couldn’t give a solitary shit when it was our kids getting abused.
The press are disgusting vultures, picking over the carcasses of peoples lives for something of value to themselves.
R.I.P Nicola
Again the family and the police more concerned with Chinese whispers
Did they find the body in the last place they looked? If so they should have looked there sooner.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 I am sorry to hear this
My heartfelt condolences to whole family of Nikki.  Also friends, coworkers.   I'm so very very sorry .  My prayers are from Ottawa Canada 🇨🇦   RIP Nicola
Omg I hope they find what happened to her
RIP Nicola, so tragic thinking of her family especially her girls and friends😢
Maybe at last those idiots who posted al these crazy things will shut up. They should be ashamed of the things they did. Absolutely disgraceful way to carry on.
You can't tell me dogs didn't find her a mile away or anyone else searching Over all this time something is definitely fishy?? it is disgusting that people are making money off of her story already.. There is a channel on YouTube called the grizzlies channel the lady is making money off of this it makes me so mad she needs to be reported, She is disrespectful please do not subscribe to her channel Report channel shut her down.
So happy she has been found for all her love her.
How did they miss her in the river? How on earth did she fall in? Poor woman, so sad for family.
Pure fake theatre. Crisis acting.
The social media and media circus, the intervention of politicians commentators and personalties expressing their opinions, and critiques has been nothing less than shameful. This is heartbreaking for the family. Leave them in peace to come to terms with their tragic loss.
My condolences to the grieving family.
Rip Nicola
RIP. Sky and ITV should be ashamed of themselves.
Dogs were barking that there is no one in the river for a f month. Now this ? British police has to be the most incompetent bunch of filthy mongrels that can exist
This doesn't make sense none of it
So heart breaking  , feel so sorry for the girls  who lost a mum and the parents family 😔😥
RIP dearest Nicola 🌻
Rest in peace beautiful lady 💔
What a moving statement from the family.  There is never closure, never, but finding Nicola addresses one of the unknowns of this tragedy,  💔
I'm sorry for your loss  I'm praying for your family
Very sad news. Have to feel for her husband and family. Let’s hope they get left in peace to mourn properly.
Heartfelt  condolences  to the  family  especially  her two  little  girls  So  HEART  BREAKING  X
Rip
Omg. Case closed don't look any further into this anyone. Nothing to see here. Wtf!
I just saw this on the news at 6.  Afterwards the BBC attempted to blame the whole circus surrounding this tragedy on Tik Tok.  Now . . . I'm no fan of Tik Tok, but none of that would have happened if the BBC and other mainstream news agencies hadn't made such a big deal out of this.  This story should have only been on the local news.  The Police have a lot to answer for also.  But that can wait.  What they need to do first is prosecute EVERYONE who told lies, broke into people's properties and accused innocent people of horrendous crimes.  They need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  If they're not, this stupidity will only get worse and we'll end up with vigilante's thinking they're the law.  That can't be allowed.
My heart goes out to this family and there loved ones
Teenagers are stabbed in london every day… and yet this story has been headlines for weeks.  Yes it’s sad but why is this one missing person the priority and not the killing of teenaged boys almost every day
Oh boy. RIP and condolences to family and friends.
How sad.
Nicely worded title instead of clickbait? See, you are capable of decency Mr BBC
Massive condolences to the family and the poor children 🙏
The husband needs to be investigated massively !!!!
Journalist's today have no morals, no dignity, no integrity, their only concern is how much money they can make for themselves and their employer. May they rot in hell and may Nicola rest in eternal peace and one day be reunited with her family, friends and Willow.
No one else finds it odd that it took them 3 weeks to find a body... A MILE down the river from where her phone was found....   This level of stupidity blows my mind
My prayers for Nicola's family🙏🏾 May Nicola Rest in Jesus Sweet Peace🙏🏾. What ever happened to Nicola, only Jehovah knows, but I pray she is at peace now IJN 🙏🏾
やはり駄目だったのか😢
This is such a very sad news. Rest in peace, Nicola. My thoughts and prayers are with the family.
Sky News acted like thoughtless, heartless. asses.  What a surprise.
Thank good it comes to an end, so many men die and get stabbed nobody really cares, one alcoholic woman dies or disappears the news drives you mad. So hypocritical of British system and the news agencies.
there's been a big uptick in women killings....i hope we can find a way to stop this. We need to stop glorifying psychopathic killers on tv for starters.
R.I.P. Nicola🙏🙏🙏
My heartfelt condolences to everyone involved. The terrible heart break.
I’m so sorry the press hounded you in this way. Love and prayers to family and friends 💜🙏🏻
Sky, ITV, BBC & all the other media & journalists are just a bunch of disgusting vultures, trying to be first with a story, shame on you all.
I think we were all rather hopeful that it would not be her but given all the facts it really had to be her. R.I.P. lovely lady. This story gripped the nation.
Bit weird it took over 3 weeks to find her body in that bit of river. Something else is going on which should be getting investigated.
God bless them all 🙏
I share my deepest sympathy with the family.
If she would have fell in there they would have found her straight away someone has probably killed her and put her there.
That's why Sky and ITV will never gain the respect BBC has. They want to be like BBC but don't learn from them.
Rip
ITS NOT THAT THE POLICE RELEASED THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION..  ITS HOW THEY CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION WHILST DISMISSING ANY OTHER POSSIBILITIES  HOW TO PRE EMPTED HER SUICIDE BASED FROM MENOPAUSE AND ALCOHOL  🤔🤔🤔
Why are the media hawking over this sad story?
R I P Nicola  god bless you and Your family
It’s sad to hear and condolences for her family during this difficult time.
It took a dog walker to find the body. After thousands of expensive drones and technology.  Guarantee if this was a tax invader, they would have found them in less than an hour. No matter what part of the river they hid in. Joke
Coroner's findings not even released no cause of death yet known detective reads such a statement shows closed minds justice for Nikki surely top priority.
😢🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🕯
I knew it, If she were to abandon the family and run.  Police would've solved the case in 24h  She had to be dead or kidnapped for the police to take so long.   Not gonna watch the video, the title is enough.   title only tells me she was killed.   I'm sorry for her kids to endure this pain.
My deepest sympathies with her family heartbreaking
I'm so triggered by this gendered language! Do we even know if they identified as female?
Sending  my condolences  top nikki  family  and  children   prays   and  thoughts  are  with  u  all   fly high  Nicola  R.I.P
The family saying that they will never know what went through her mind implies that they think she took her own life doesn't it?
So many people of colour go missing on a daily, one white girl goes missing and the whole country is in a frenzy, fuck off kindly 🖕👍
Very Sad news 😞 my sincere condolences go out to her family. I feel so much for her 2 young girls bless them 🙏🏽
Heartbreaking. What a tragic ending. Condolences to the entire family.
Damn
But still no explanation of why. Sadly, there are still unanswered questions. If it is just left at this people are going to carry on with accusations or ideas about what really happened. Remember : No one has ever been charged with the death of Stuart Lubbock at Michael Barrymore's home, despite every guest being known. That is how the police operate and you have to question why.
The police knew all the
So many questions....disappearance? Murder? Who? What? Where? When? Why? Maybe a person known to Police did this? She may have seen something she shouldn't have on her walk and it was a case of get rid of the witness.  Her phone on the bench seems staged. The dog not freaking out or stressed makes me think she had seen the 'something' before. She even wrote on fb that a walk was spooky....that may be intuition? Was she being watched previously and then came across something she shouldn't have? Also no one is asking why she didn't have audio and camera activated on the call with work? How do you have a team meeting and say nothing; not even a hi or good morning? That is odd not to mention that it is near impossible to just randomly fall in knee deep water and drown. In addition if she took her own life folks need to understand it is impossible to drown yourself as your brain and body won't allow it unless you've tied weights or are so out of it you don't know what's up or down.
But what happened? Did they do autopsy?
This is a terrible situation but as Nicola was unwell why was she alone and driving  she shouldn't have been doing all these things she needed care
Praying for the family 🙏
The police tasks forces have been up&down that part of the river for about 4week+ but didn’t see her body but suddenly now her body showed up. Not just the police but members of that village public have been there as well ❤ now we wait for the police and the corner to  investigate post-mortem of her body ❤
So sad. My thoughts are with the family
It's so horrible to not know if it was an accident or deliberate. I hope they can focus on her life rather than her passing, and move on as positively as possible
So sad, condolences to the family and may her soul RIP 🙏🏽😢😥😓
Rest in Peace Nicola 🕊️🕯️✨🌸🌻🌷🌸🙏🌻💮🌼🏵️🌹🌾
So: The relative who absolutely, positively, 100% said she was not in the river. Will he say he was wrong?
Rip Nicola another beautiful soul lost😭
Poor fragile soul.   Unfortunately, depression and alcohol feed on the most precious human beings
Actors
UK has become a shithole... their government tolerate every crime...
I prayed that she would be found safe and sound, poor family
Shame on the police! Too concerned about spouting off about public or sky news being the problem when they should of been doing their job! Disgusting! Hany your heads in shame!
So!! What happend ?  Accident ? Or foul play ?
Bet all those women commenting “it was her boyfriend” are feeling like right thickos now
Aw man :(
Sad man,how did this happen , poor Nicola 🙏
Prayers for the family ♥
My sincerest condolences to  Nichola’s partner and those little girls and obviously all other family members. Sending love and strength for the future. X
Suicide is on the increase.
The police planted this body there it was found week's earlier they had no chance on this one
4:20 the sky news guy who was hounding Nicolas partner can be seen frantically typing on his phone....I hope to God he and all the other reporters as well as that awful man Peter Faulding , who has done nothing but fuel the speculations around this case, will leave Paul and the rest of her family alone. There should be an investigation into the media storm too, not just the police involvement.
May Nicola R.I.P go now with the lord
RIP Beautiful Nikki so sorry for the family 🙏
They dont explain whether Bicola Bulley commited suicide or whether she was a victim of a murder?
That's heart breaking God love her and her close loved one 😔
Now finally we can all stop seeing nicolas name. Finally all news channel can report some other news other then this dead person
Rest in peace Nicole, sending so much love to her family. I hope the trolls get what they deserved, that poor father who had  nothing to do with it. Sickening
The police and other search teams were just despicable! They searched this river and local areas for three weeks and yet couldn't find her. For Christ's sake, she was only about a mile away! My heart goes out to her two kids, partner and parents.!
Sad news, but my question is where is the dog?
I had no doubt. The police knew that was the most likely event. Sorry that the money hungry Press, people on social media and all the armchair detectives made this so much more complicated for the police and the family.  Condolences to the family, R I. P. Nicola
In the river only a mile away? I thought it had been thoroughly searched already. RIP young lady.
This is such devastating news, RIP Nicola, you will be missed by many ❤💐
So they searched where she was found reviewing the video of the dive she was NOT there she's been placed there after the search this isn't as clean cut as it seems
How horrible this woman died.💔 So glad the greedy unwise media were told off about their shameful actions.
I think That her sister and partner had something to do with it. Watch them in intervew They bouth laughing
who can guess the skin colour of the murderer? 👀
😔
What makes me wonder is the fact that after questioning and asking for Police to search for Nicola somewhere else, her body magically appears in the river.... To make it appear Police was right from the get go... I do have a lot of questions and wonder how in the hell did they miss her in a first place. Also for police to claim they found her body and not public is yet another proof that at least Police in England is worth nothing more than a bloody penny... Rest In Peace Nicola, May Your Memory never die and May your love ones find closure and not dwell on the fact that you were gone for so long....
😭💔✝️May She Rest In Peace✝️⚘Condolences To The Bereaved Family And Friends✝️⚘
RIP
Just awful, i hope those girls never get tiktok, they dont need to the the vile accusations about nicola and her family and friends on there, its disgusting. And as for nicola, i only hope she may now rest in peace, and that her daughters can finaly have some kind of closure. I also hope the internet detectives finally start showing her and her family some respect.
After what has been happening lately, I can't help but wonder if a police officer might be responsible for her death. Condolences to her family.
🥹 Such a shame.
The statement from the family just broke my heart. Such a terrible thing to happen...God bless the family and my deepest sympathies.
Finally she can get the fuck out of my recommendations.

Hey and the little girl with a pink jacket
May she rest in peace
RIP sweet nicola
Love and thought to the family RIP Nicola x
Why was this case treated so differently to the thousands of other missing persons?
😭😭😭
R.I.P
The police have a lot of explaining to do, they messed up big time.
Well  I'm really sorry to hear  the outcome  . But I do believe  she's  been  put  there  I really  hope  we get the answers  for her family   .. . To put.this horrible  case  to bed .. God bless  to all ...
Sending so much love to the family. It is tragic news. I hope she's at peace and the family can find peace now she's been found. X x x
Prayers for the family
I had a terrible feeling that she wouldn't be found alive, but hearing it confirmed is just awful. The way the press and the amateur sleuths behaved throughout all of this was been appalling, and I only hope her family get some peace. My heart goes out to them.
RIP beautiful Nickola . Condolences to her family so sorry
RIP. Now let's get the same energy and effort for everyone else that's gone missing, regardless of skin color and financial standing...
Very sad news just think about her children they lost there mother now it most certainly saddens us all  don’t understand why was she going out alone with her children as she was  venerable and desperate strange thing is she make calls msgs and jumps in to the river ? Just feel with those kids..
sad
RiP to the poor woman. Not sure what happened to her and how she got in the water but at least her kids have closure, God Bless them.
Why has the disappearance of this woman been such a big thing? People go missing all the time.
This is so so sad. Hopefully trolls will stop now as their behaviour has been absolutely disgusting. Rest in peace sweet lady xx
you can not blame the media for the publication  of what’s been said or published  the media are not mind readers  take a look at the information that was given to the police from the immediate family  the police then gave statements to the press and the public  the partner of Nicola openly went on television and spoke openly about Nicola  this statement from the police was totally bullish and unnecessary  trying to justify the mistakes they made from the start  shame on Lancashire Police
I wonder if the armchair detectives, conspiracy theorists and "diving experts" who were so adamant that she wasn't in the river will apologise?
It's just sad❣
There was STILL a massive part of me that was rooting for her to be found.  My heart is in bits and all I can say is a huge sorry to the whole Bulley family.  Such a young, beautiful and vibrant girl.  Nicola, I pray your now at peace honey.  R.I.P and fly high with the rest of the angels.  God Bless . X
What a tragedy. 😢
Africa is sending condolences to Nicola family and UK as a whole
Why so much press coverage for a missing adult?, sad though it is, a waste of resources.
I hope whoever decided to call them is fired.
I wonder how she died.
You could of put her in the river or whoever took her just saying, also the police and media need to be objective if they are to find the killer
Body found case closed can we stop going on about it now?
It’s very sad, but to all of the people flaming the police saying they were wasting money and time the wannabe internet detectives spreading rediculous theories, don’t you feel absolutely stupid now, rest in peace Nicola
waiting now to  see what comes out the post mortem
So so sad 😥 it was obvious it was her body but needed it confirmed. Let's hope no one else was involved but I think there was. RIP nicola bulley . Condolences to her family and friends 😔
Very very sad news 😢
This is literally suspicious poor woman something happened to her she didn't just fall in and die someones behind this
So so sad.  I'm glad they don't have to live their lives in the pain of wondering what happened and can start the healing process. 🙏
RIP.
Shame on all YouTubers, TikTokers and mainstream media.
So sad. Thoughts to Nicola's friends & family. Rest peacefully Nicola. 🌹
That is 😭
That is 😭
Rubbish statement absolute rubbish
This is so sad, my condolences
Condolences to the family, the press need some new regulations to stop things like this from happening, their behaviour is disgraceful. No mud should be thrown at all. As we all know from years of this. Some sticks
This is in my mind absolutely no way in hell her body has been there all that time. I'm pretty sure she was abducted murdered by someone else then when the police thought the river had been searched decided to dump her body in the river to make it seem like her body had been in there all along. I'm fairly confident it's the partner as wasan't he saying that Nicola was 100 percent not in the river. Why is that i wonder?
So sorry to hear that but we all knew she was dead when she left her dog behind
What a tragic news had hope she would be found alive, my condolences to the familie. Rest in peace nicola bulley 🌹
This has had a huge impact not only on Nicola’s family and friends but also on the local community who have worked so hard to find her.  Sincere condolences to everyone involved.  A beautiful lady taken far too soon.  Much love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
R.I.P .SO SAD.  THINKING OF HER GIRLS,PARENTS,PARTNER,FREINDS AND FAMILY.XXX
What was the cause of her death? Rip
Sad. So so sad. Rip.
rip nicola darling .sadly missed by all and the world 😥😥😥😥
R.I.P Nicola, sleep tight with the angels
Very sad.but now go away and find out the truth about Nicolas death.  Heard she was in the rushes not in the river but believe she was put there after river search
Worth noting .. this happens thousands of times a year , had she been council estate class no one would give a fuck and the media used her as a postergirl for their hunger for clicks , they sure as fuck got them .. theyll forget about her in a week &  on to someone else
And I've had people try to convince me she ran away or something 🤦‍♀️
The British Press really needs reform, someone to take a rod to these roaches. Rest in peace Nicola.
Public found the body not police , usless . RIP
Such sad News 🙏 but this is not an isolated or special case ! Of course to her family ! I think the Police and Media have been treated harshly ! Of course the Chief Suspects are always those closest to us ! I have the great privilege of meeting Winnie Johnson who’s beautiful boy Keith was taken not his choice !! Only a child !! The Media coverage of this case has been extreme ! If Nicola chose to end her life that carries no shame ‘ !! For Family often what if ? Should have ! It’s an arrogance to save anyone ! Through this media output !What comes across is how Mental Health is still a taboo subject even more so in middle England where a reputation matters more than a life !! My thoughts and prayers to Nicola and her Family 🙏🙏💫
My deepest condolences to her parents, two daughters and her partner. She was a very attractive lady .
Someone got a lot to answer for ...r.i.p
Rip Nicola
Seems abit suspect if you ask me.
We are so sorry and hope it was not Nicola god bless her and your family 🥰
Sky news Is disgusting for pestering the family while they're going through this!
When they said press they were taking about you, you prat.
If it had been my Missus … real heads would have definitely rolled …
So sad R I P Nicola xx
The poor family, I can't believe what the media have put them through, they should be ashamed of them selves, my heart goes out to the family
God this is awful, poor woman.  This is going to be particularly hard on her kids.  RIP Nicola.
Finally. I hope she is at peace now and her daughter's can grieve. What a terrible story. Rip angel 😞
Prayers of healing for Nicola's family and friends 🙏🏼🕊️😔💔 The media will blame pressure from tiktok losers to keep up the tiktok losers will blame police for lack of information and trust the police will blame media and tiktok losers and nothing will change. So let's all just focus on prayers of healing for Nicola's family and friends 🙏🏼😔 may they find peace and solace in one another 😔💔🙏🏼. May Nicola rest in heavenly peace 🕊️💔
Is her fella getting arrested yet then or what ??
RIP Nicola   My sincere condolences to family and friends
Wana focus on ur job instead talking about public . You said she had drinking problems no1 else do ur job correct. And you failed on the river search . If any one let the family down its the police
Breaking: Madeline McCann beats Nicola Bulley in a game of hide and seek
Skys coverage of this has the family statement edited out of their footage. Shame on them. RIP Nicola and condolences to her loved ones.
I hope to hear about the report from the post mortem to insure her injuries match to a suicide and that there is not a dangerous person out on the loose. This is important to confirm. And whilst I understand this is very tragic news you cannot blame the public for speculating as they wanted to help solve this case. I do not believe people were wanting anything other than to help put forward their ideas and theories about what could have happened in order to help the police. I know that's been my intention anyway. I wanted to help. And you have to be open to all possibilities. Question everything. That's the only way. I am sorry to hear she has been found in such a manner. I hope her children will be able to get the support they need. So sad. And again I hope to hear that there was no wrong doing in this case. Rest in peace Nicola. You were thought of by so many. 🥺💜
So what actually happened
RIP Nicola. Family and friends did plenty of interviews willingly though.
Something is very off with all this.
RIP Nicola🙏💔
I hope karma comes for those involved and you know who you are
She left her poor dog to roam around and left her kids. For what?
What a sad ending! R.I.P. Nicola. You are at peace now and so sorry to the family for their loss 😭
My thoughts are with the YouTube commentators who this morning still though the body found was of someone else. You truly are idiots.
The sad reality that "freedom of the press" once meant something. To turn to nothing more than a cash grab -- those willing to sell their souls to the devil to keep the lights on in their own homes who will go to ridiculous lengths to do so. Sincerest condolences to Nicola's family and friends. I can't even begin to imagine what pain her partner and children are going through right now.
My heart goes out to her young children . I cannot imagine how traumatic it is for them …
The Papers are a disgrace! Rip nicola bulley
Why were the press instructed by the powers that be, to push this story.. I really would love to know, because there are hundreds of people go missing every month. Really strange that they've picked this one to run with..
Ok ladies and gentlemen, theres nothing to see here. Move on move on lets now focus on more pressing matters. The media have had their field day over the past few weeks. Focus now on ULEZ extension, GBP digital currency, and replacing Nicola Sturgeon as prime minister of Scotland.
What a coincidence
R.i.p Nichola
This case exposed a sick society lead by tabloid trash and people with 0 expertise interferring. Thats modern Britain, in the gutter.
Dear BBC , Give me 30000000 taka monthly.
RIP Nicola no more pain
Condolences. Maybe the news can move on now.
Sending heartfelt thoughts and prayers from Thailand to Nicola's family and friends 🙏
God bless her but I don't  understand  how a afull search  with Sonar didn't  find her yet she's found  3 weeks later  Hmmm big questions  about that..
:(
So so sad. Prayers to the family. Have they said a cause of death yet?
Her little girls 💔💔
In very different circumstances I also lost my mum around this date in 2010. Condolences to the family and specially to her offspring.
So let’s get this straight of the 7 bushes on that straight Of water they missed it?
All of this is sus af.
God Bless her soul.
RIP Nicola ❤️
Rip nicola , deep condolence
The british media sell what people want to hear. Its not news its entertainment. Sky BBC ITV Channel 4 all pathetic ratings chasers like any other TV programme....
OOO no I am so so very sorry we are all here and thinking of you and her cxxx 💚💐🌹
Why do we even need the police? It's always the public who solve crimes and find bodies. Police don't bother with burglaries, car thefts, illegal immigrants or grooming gangs anymore either so what do they actually do? Other than dish out fines for minor infractions to generate cash?
What happened? She could swim, she knew the area, how was she not found before? Willow was not wet..  I hope a post mortem will be performed. It just does not add up.
Yet they still insist that it was not foul play !
We await the coroners report. RIP, Nicola.
Very sad 😔
So sad my thoughts and prayers are for the family and friends at this time
Rip Nicola.I hope her family are ok❤❤🙏🙏🙏😭😭
Gg
She was white so the media ran with it.
Rest in peace nicola, I hope the tragedy pimps here on youtube now stop their speculation. Especially the large content creators. I hope they now leave this poor family alone and stop speculating about their family sittuation.
This is so sad. May she Rest In Peace. Praying for her family. 🤲🏽
His wife has just died and he manages to make it all about him. Brilliant
God bless her and her family.
Her family should consider themselves lucky, they won’t have to suffer as much as the McCann family did.
its heartbreaking. whatever the cause of death, if you feel down in anyway just try and talk to somebody, even if its in the comments section on youtube, someone will help
Will the media still be bringing out ex- coppers to stoke the hate campaign against the police ? , I think it is clear now , in my opinion . Great job Lancashire police 👍, will our non elected prime minister and his team continue to stir the hate of the police I my opinion ?
My deepest condolences to Nicola's family and friends 🙏 😢 💔
Whoever did the subtitles can't spell
This is really horrible and I can't imagine how the family must be feeling. But I'm glad they found her now and not years down the line x
I am so sorry this has been the outcome asI had hoped she would be found alive. My deepest and heartfelt sorrow goes out to all of Nicola's family. I pray Paul you can forgive those who out of ignorance came to their own conclusions regarding this very difficult time my friend. To the whole family I want them to know, they and Nicola were thought of very highly and the situation was prayed over. Again my heart felt thoughts are with you. Love from Scotland.
Now you need to apologise to the police
So sad let her family Bury her in peace and privacy...
sending my thoughts and prayers to the family and hope they can start to heal now 🙏
So sad and tragic for her family, and everyone who knew the poor lass.
The media gorging  on this poor family is truly horrible
This is the face of depression:  u try not to worry anyone, family or work, u get ur guts up and bravery, cos it is brave, and uncontrollable emotions and darkness comes over u and then...RIP, it is a better place for her now!
RIP Nicola 😢
Im very sorry for her family, just horrible, but finding a body does not clear anyone of wrong doing. That is not the point the investigation is at yet.
Finally some peace for this poor family. Shame on the media and shame on all the people that turned this tragedy into a circus for likes and views.
Condolences to all her family and friends. Rest in peace Nicola...
So she committed suicide?
My prayers and condolences to the family and friends.
May she Rip always and forever Amen ✝️❤️🙏
GG
so the police were right all along !
8 am THE DIVER  accidentally confirmed the body as Nicola on Lorraine
So sad may she R.I.P strength to her family and friends
I hope all the armchair detectives will shut up now
My most humble condolences to the family during this difficult time. I'm also very sorry to hear that the family's privacy has been violated. Let them be left in peace.
Condolences to the family.  So very sorry for your loss.  RIP.
In her last moments, she went through an online work meeting, that is really sad! She had to not give a single indication to her work or family of what she wanted to do, poor person...R.I.P xxx
The world is unstable and so are its residents ...Common sense is Dead.  Is it possible to live like a Borg doing what computers tell us to do? What it's like to be a Borg living in a two-dimensional reality?  I am going to pretend that I am Elon Musk and I have $170 billion to my name and I want to make the world a better place to live. One morning I woke up and learned that I have a soul and it scared me because now I know there is a God. There is a little over 500,000 homeless in America so I decided I would give 70 billion to that problem to learn if I could help anyone and still keep $100 billion to my name owning the largest sailboat ever created by man. So this is what I did. I gave every homeless person in America a $100,000 home, an electric bike, Robotic Lawn Mower, a robotic vacuum cleaner, and a hot tub. The reason I am doing this is to separate criminals from homelessness. Now the homeless can live in a house, keep it clean with the robotic vacuum cleaners, keep the grass cut with their Robotic Lawn Mower, keep themselves clean by sitting in their hot tubs and best of all they all would have a job delivering packages on their electric bikes. Now the only ones that are living on the streets are criminals doing drugs because they got mad that nobody elected them to be president/dictator of a world superpower making rules for people to follow threatening all life with nuclear extinction. If people could only step outside and see reality for what it is people would know what capitalism is good for. Today we are a privileged people bringing misery to the world because we like feeling superior to everyone else. When Armageddon comes we will all know the reason why, it is because we are spoiled rotten as a human race making artificial intelligence more intelligent than life itself stealing for ourselves and lending our children a two-dimensional existence they can never own for themselves not even their intellectual property rights. A new world order is easy to understand, people have voted to replace God's law with copyright law. Even when it comes to making love people can buy products to fake those feelings as well. Reality is a lie, go to college and you too can become president and make the world a better place to live:  The Problem Is This… why would anybody want to? With political correctness along with community standards the existence of a God coming out of the past saying "do unto others as you have them do unto you" can still be found in our history books "I ended homelessness" on a billionaires gravestone would never be allowed to exist today because the world no longer has partnership in common sense to allow it to happen.  PS. Reality can never be faked it only collects debt coming out of human nature.… Global debt passed $300 trillion in 2021. The nuclear clock is ticking.
I was expecting some "shame on you" for the internet "investigators" next to Sky News and iTV. I hope they have some peace now.
All the people involved couldn’t track downstream 1 mile during all this time even helicopter’s flying above.
We all have our theories now she can rest  in peace. This case never made sense from the start   and how it was handled I feel for her children let's hope they get the correct support  they will need
She fake her death
did she fall in? or did someone throw her in? can someone tell me
Oh, that's such a pity. I was hoping she'd just got fed up with her life and work and walked away.
May God comfort you all
Now a full investigation will show if it she was drowned on purpose etc. Or  if it was some very strange accident.
💔💔💔😭😭😭 This is so sad moment.  RIP. Nicola
There is something that I  feel uncomfortable about this.
Aw rip darling
Very sad, this has made me cry. My sincere condolences to Nicola's family and friends
So, so sad. Sadly it was the inevitable outcome. RIP Nicola, may you rest in peace.
Apparently, Lancashire Police is already in ‘special measures’. The cack-handed, frankly inappropriate and embarrassing way they have handled this case suggests those ‘measures’ need to be ramped up. RIP Nicola.
At least the family saw through the media and knew what a bunch of scumbags you are! Its not the police that need investigating, its the media! a clear example of this is - you (the media) keep accusing the police of revealing key information, yet it was YOU (the media) ringing the family to try and get hold of that key information!.  The way the media have handled/reported on this situations is disgusting! The poor family has had to suffer being hounded, whilst trying to keep their hope alive. And even today when all their hope was lost, you STILL hounded them. Hopefully now you will leave them to grieve in peace. RIP Nicola.
Thankfully the Beeb not included in the intrusion.
Police have  done  duty but thanks are absent.
RIP beautiful lady Nicola. 🌻💛🌻💛🌻💛🌻💛🌻
My sincere condolences to the entire family…
Took 3 weeks to find her only a mile down river? Those search parties need some better training.
wow. the police were actually right. so sad that we lost such a young life. RIP
Sky news should be held accountable for their actions rip thought are with the children
No Respawn GG WP
An important statement from the family.  A family's traumatic experience should not be used by the media to speculate and infer blame where no blame lay.  Sky News and ITV should formally apologies.
So sad 😞 my prayers go to the family and friends 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
We do not know what happened. It is very important that people understand that menopause is serious and as someone myself who was high risk it can lead to suicidal ideation and action. Having good medical care is absolutely necessary for women at this stage of life.
All news outlets we found her now so leave the family alone with your stories , their nothing to say now so stop making money from someone’s tragedy
Condolences to her family and friends. I agree - the press must please leave them in peace to grieve.
Very sad
So sorry for this tragedy in your lives. R.I.P.
Omg.. RIP Ms. Nicola🙏
Why always must be about pretty woman? Why no one talk about men also? Nobody cares
Rest in peace Nicola Bulley!            Amen
R.I.P Nicola 💐🕯️😿😔😇
“Trump, Bolsonaro, and Modi’s murdered her, supported by white supremacists and Fox News” - BBC analysis
One look at those teeth.. "yup, that's her"
Police killed her
So sad
Damn.
Thank you
Who is this woman
So the police theory turned out to be true.  It'll be interesting going back to previous videos full of comments from self proclaimed detectives claiming the police are idiots and there's no way she fell in the river.
I think the statement read out on behalf of the family was very telling, naming Sky News & ITV for not respecting their wishes for privacy yesterday, when is too far in the media lens! The Police are in focus for their way of handling this case, should the Media also be held accountable! I have unsubscribed and unfollowed Sky News. Thank you BBC News for handling your coverage in a more respectful way.
How comes they missed her Initially? They spent three weeks looking for her to only be found one mile away?
totally agree with the family naming and shaming certain media companies
So sad! 😢
R.I.P
All the armchair experts and amateur Sherlocks must be gutted
This is so sad
Like me guys
