How does Meghan do that to dresses ? Beautiful designer labels and she won't wear foundation garments

Piers was spot on but the woman is so biased she looks like a fool.
He’s 100% correct
Top marks as always, Piers! 👍
Susan is 100% right, piers won’t let her have a word, he believes his opinion is right and doesn’t take any other opinion. I’m glad he was kicked of the show 🎉
Bleating - love it
Hey they could've got A Ship😂
Well done piers my god how right you were about harry and m I can I just can't bring myself to say her name she deserves every thing that's camping yo both of them go piers
Have they edited this video so they are closer to each other? Piers' and Susanna's hands and arms kept disappearing when they went toward each other. It was funny 😅
Why is Piers soooo worried about what people who don’t even know him do?  What a strange man.
He is so ridiculous. Can’t have sympathy to save his life.
Meghan wants to be a priority over William and Kate. .she's a narc
Piers had their number way before most.
I love Piers! 🇺🇸
At least the rest of the world has the common decency not to mention the fact the Doria spent time in prison for fraud, which she tried to blame on her husband. They sat in that Oprah interview and disrespected Her Majesty…….sorry, but I wouldn’t have held back after that 😡
Well said
Piers Morgan could be one of the most annoying tool of a journalist I have had the misfortune of listening to.
Funny. And to think that news reporters from yesteryear used to be ‘stiff upper lipped’ and non-confrontational with each other.
Susi is as empty as Meagain Markel
They are utter jokes, and nothing has worked for them for a reason…they are ridiculous.
💥PIERS MORGAN KNOWS THE PERSONAL LIVES OF ROYAL SUBJECTS VIA MEDIA,  even when the subjects "State Their Opinions" PIERS COMPARES IT TO HIS OWN LIFE 💯
?????    Eso lo creo un buen. Señor. Inteligencia emocional que grande la persona. Que Dios la bendiga siempre
??????    Yo.  No. Inglés. No.   Puro castellano 😊
Suzanna talkin out of her rear.. I have zero respect for her as a journalist
Totally agree with piers they are a bunch of hyporcites.
????? Wait.  Es. Voice.
?????? Se. Terminan los chou. A hora bien comentario
Los. Otros son artistas de chou
❤❤❤❤,❤. Leonardo Javier mella Retamal Chile curico  Es.    Universal  Wait.  Creisy,Dan,t,  niura ,  everlloni
It amazing me that people actually feel entitled to speak on how orhers choose to live THEIR lives! What a bunch of losers😂
HOW did you get that job Suzanne
SUSANNA HAVE YOU WOKE UP YET 😂
That woman is deluded
I don’t like Piers, but she was so much more annoying, and proven wrong.  She hasn’t aged well in this.
I hope Piers never leaves them alone.
She disowned her dad because he threw her under the bus.  Plain and simple.  Why is he the one that gets sympathy?
Meghan might be a bad person, but every comment section about Harry and Meghan is full of toxic racist negativity.
I live in Santa Barbara.  Piers speaks for all of us! 👍
3:41 I guess that's her list of words that need to be outlawed..? Sticks and stones sweetheart
Piers you’re the best
Piers nailed it. He saw it coming and for once he was completely right.
I could instantly see the tension on wats her names face as soon as Piers started the conversation 😂😂😂 Bet she feels like an idiot now 😂😂
Piers is sounding just like my mum here 😊
It’s not the truth about the Sussex’s that Pier is professing, is the “sympathy” what’s her name is demanding defending them. Maybe if her name was Samantha, she’ll feel completely different about MM.
That whiney voice. Susanne. 😂😂😂😂
Piers was 100% right !!!
Megdusa talks absolute SHITE 24/7 FACT
If Harry really wants to protect his children he should divorce their narcissistic mother. I cannot begin to imagine the damage her self serving lies will do to their young and vulnerable personalities. They will grow up knowing their mother was the woman who showed the ultimate disrespect to a highly admired hard working Queen of England
Oh my gosh. I can feel her pain.
This is what they wanted is to be famous and photographerd and talked about there is nothing good about Meghan and or Harry they havent done any work Meghan rips everybody she can uses them then throws them away so they have what they want ,it isnt that  the media or Hollywood or actors or producers,Meghans family are bashing them or smearing them everyone is saying what it is and no one trust them and there is nothing good to say about them.
Is this women one of Meghans sugars or Meghan paid her off.
Piers talking common sense. 👍
Alex the shitty weather man is a biased and shite house 😂😂😂😂😂
Piers, Piers, Piers, Piers!!!!! 🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Susanna reid get a brain cell
Tell it Pierce
The funny thing is, Morgan asked Markle out when she was single, she turned him down... Hell hath no fury like a scorned man.
What is wrong with this woman?
Piers must feel vindicated.
Pierce Morgan was so right on all counts
I totally agree with Pries. And high right he was , as time proved it. I don't know who was that presenter is , however now she has egg on her face. As for Harry protecting his wife!!! SHE IS OLDER THAN HIM GOOD FEW YEARS , she should protect him.
Something wrong with my monitor.
They've had a couple of ruff years at there own doing but just look at what theve done to others
"CLICK, CLICK CLICK"  ......Loud SCREAM! 😱.  (Pap 1) "Who's screaming?" (Pap 2) "Meghan" (Pap 1) "But why?" (Pap 2) "she told me yesterday to make sure I got her best side. I guess I must have  forgotten. Ma' Bad! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment section was just opened? 11 comments for a 2yr. old video.
You should not get upset with Piers here … simply just look around .. to see how a multitude are viewing them …  That many people can not be all mistaken …  However time has come to stop talking about them …  Starting with British pres .. unless a breaking news comes up  Not to mention the social media … high has got out of hand …. To the point of much hate ..  one has to wonder if those people have own life?  Bottom line being :  Stop talking about them …  Instead give them the privcay they desire ..  watching this story fir a year ..  yet we need to see media constantly  covering this 24/7…  Stop casting stones … instead look into your own life’s and or look around  What is going on around the world …  Sickness, tragedies , hunger , the list is huge …  Live and let live….
Come on pierce
But they got to kno all his business
Why dont the Palace provide homes for the homeless food clothes stop taxes! Help the UK people! Summer is coming winter will follow still children are starving and freezing and dying! Shut up Piers!!
Oh Shut up Piers you are a real WALLY !!  Leave them alone ! You are a Hypocrite! Piers has no empathy for anyone! A motor mouth who wont let anyone speak!! Get rid of him!! Piers is a TOXIC MORON!!!!!!
In the middle of a funking global pandemic. They're bleating 🤣🤣I'm black and Nigerian but I love piers
Middle of a covid crisis and they're the ones getting it worst 🤣🤣
This aged like fine wine
