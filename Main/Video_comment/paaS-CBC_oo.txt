Don't be sad, Dustin... your loss here will see Gaethje miss out, and you get your 3rd, and most ill-deserved title shot within a year. Worst performance of your career was versus Khabib... Islam will be the same.
That final question...really? Who doesn't know about Dustins short pulling???
Dustin you are the MAN - a true warrior is humble in victory and defeat. You have nothing to prove to anyone.
Hey you beat Conor. Lol.   Champ!
“Where I’ve come from, I’ve already won” sent shivers down my spine. “Where I’ve come from, I’ve already won” sent shivers down my spine.
On the very idiotic stage of UFC, we are lucky to see gentlemen like Poirier.  This man is one great example for young enthusiasts. Respect.
I think it’s true, you have already won , you have tons of love and support from the people.
Good. Man.. that was clean..yes it wrapped around... it was  not intentional... evan i blind squirl gets a acorn...good fight ...professional  reactions...to men went to battle... not... the new age, man.....or queer...
He’s a sore winner every time he wins. I’m glad he got a reality check and took the loss well.
Dude’s got a lot of class, got a respect that
respect to both men
Dustin Poirier you are a realist, you said it like it was. No BS.❤
Favorite ufc fighter
Dustin is such a wholesome dude he might not be the flashiest or the most popular but damn sure he’s one of the best strikers also humble at the same time… was amazing to hear Justin say he’s his favorite fighter shows how much he respects Dustin and how much that loss meant to him
Great guy i love it❤
It's good to hear he still wants to fight he been my favorite in the division j beating out Justin and then connor. But anyway even tho it was such insane moment it sucks trying to root for 2 ppl u are a fan of. If I wanted anything I wanted a war for 5 rounds for a decision for any of them. Now it's the question what's the line for a title fight.  excited for Justin to see a Islam or Charles fight and I feel for Dustin
Justin is a champion all the way. He knows how to take a loose and be humble. Great Interview.
Let’s go Gaethje! Respect for class
He doesn’t want to fight up and coming fighters…..  I don’t like it when fighters have that attitude; other than that, stand up guy like always/
Dustin is my favorite fighter. Nothing but love and support for you man. I hope to see you in the ring again. I wish you the best.
Hall of famer. Respect
He’s completely broken holding back all his emotions.
This man will always have my respect. Absolute legend.
He's a legend, actually he and Chandler really do carry themselves so well on the mic and in their activities off of the screen. Top man ❤
He can fight the looser of Islam vs Olivera, likely to be Oliviera so a shot to redemption. if he wins he gets another title shot, and even if he looses, there is a good chance Islam destroys both Olivier’s and Justin: So Dustin can have a very popular matchup and trilogy fight vs Justin. It’s not like he is out of options, just needs to wait since the next title fight is already scheduled,
Tony Ferguson…….
just a shame he can't keep his woman out of next guys DM's like a man
You're Alive, healthy, wealthy ,and young enough for a rematch. You know with both being 1and1 that rematch is pretty much a automatic payday  that's absolutely winning in most people's lives.
at least you didnt snap conors neck
🤭 😅
dont worry dustin atleast you didnt leave on a stretcher....lol
even though i thought you lost was hoping for a win ,,, i felt go0od until.....................................
😀🤑
i wish i put all my money on you,, and got my course done
well done Justin,,,,,,
he gained more honor this way than if he'd won the fight.
Sportsmanship.
Champ, you rock dustin!
"I'm telling you that if Justin wouldn't have landed that Foot  Kick 🦵 it would've been Game Over for Justin 100% lol 😮
Win like a man? Man must have forgotten how he behaved after the hooker fight
He had 37 fights not 47
So much respect for Dustin. I wanted Justin to win, but I didn’t want Dustin to lose. Complete class act for holding his head high. This fight inspired many people in many different ways.
What a classy guy much respect what's not to love about this guy
Respect to this man! DP is a real one!
Legend
What a savage!!! AND A REAL MAN!!
Retire healthy champ .
Love porier. Just a genuine man….  He was actually winning and performing better prior to the KO….  And fair play to him….he tried getting back up immediately. Can’t get any stronger.  I would love to see a trilogy
Dustin is rear. Saying scared and nervous proves hes solid
I would love to see Justin become champ and then fight Dustin for both belts. Omg that would be so good.
Dustin is such an amazing guy.
You're winning days are over hang it up
I win like a man… mocks Conor after he broke his leg in half lol😂
I’ve been Dustin Porier fan (almost said I was a DP fan 😂😂😂) for a long time bc of the man he is. It’s a just a bonus that he’s a badass fighter, too.
I loooove this dude as a human as a father and as an athlete! Respect from top to bottom in everything he does!
What a good dude!!!! Thanks Poirier!
What a great fighter and person.  Class act..
I was happy to see Dustin kicked in the mouth. He deserved it and it was worth waiting for 😅
Your wife is in my DMs Dustin.
Is the mac life ever gonna fox their microphone so you can actually listen to these? I wonder if they realize how bad it sounds. Your views would probably go way up if you fixed the audio. Just a heads up.
At least he won the first encounter solid asf.
Dustin is 10000000% a future hall of famer absolute legend 🥊🤩🥊
There are too many reasons why he’s my favorite fighter
There both badasses...
Dustin, you are a class act brother. Relax and take it easy dude .
So much respect for Dustin, he’s a great role model. From what I’ve seen he really seems to be a kind and moral person.
You lose blabla.
This guy is unbearable, I used to like him but he has no self awareness.  So undeserving of all his big fights.
How can you not like Dustin?
If you broke the leg conor chicken is enough for you
Dustin will always be my favorite fighter.
Respect Dustin your what the UFC is all about true warrior 🫡
The salt lake media person…does she only care about asking about the elevation?? Lol. Every interview…
Dustin was winning it for sure.. the lucky kick did it unfortunately for him.
Class!
Man so much respect
A red hat with WAR on it haha. Start a war! (on the other side of the world) Sell them weapons! (Both sides)
#winnermindset
In this particular interview he took his loss very well. Later on the next day he goes to say that he feels like he’s better then Justin. And he’s also a sore winner whining in the Micheal chandler fight and making fun of mcgregor after he broke his leg.
my fav
A true champion and role model.
Every part the legend!
And he cried like ma… When he lost to khabib🫢
This is why Dustin is my favorite fighter! Just a role model in MMA in every aspect
"I dish it out, I gotta take it" is the real moto of life! We get what we give! #TheDiamond is a real one!
I heard that after Dustin lost, that his wife DM'd Connor ... looking for a Champion!
Surprised his wife wasn't there doing the press conference 😂😂 good job Justin Gaethje
Dustin such a real dude man - I really like Justin but wanted to see Dustin win LOL !!!
Justin or Dustin
My perfect scenario, Justin fights winner of Charles Islam, than Justin has to to defend it against another top 5 and Dustin fights Charles or Islam to challenge Gaethje for the belt and they both at least hold the belt once before they retire
All I hope is that people don't push Gaethje to be active in defending that BMF belt before his title shot
I lose money on you I am happy u ok 👍
“I win like a man, so I’ve got to lose like a man” says the biggest sore winner in MMA
The sport needs loud trash talkers to make headlines but grounded fighters like DP are the heartbeat.
What a guy, respect. Takes the loss like a man.
When you fight the best guys in the world you will lose. Respect to Porier and Gaethje
P head kick
He’s such a class act. Gotta love The Diamond!
Dustin is so humble! The way he kept blinking at the reporter's stupid question 🙄...and actually had to answer twice after being sarcastic 🤦 What he really wanted to say was "No nigga, I'm just from the Dirty South, it's a hood thing...you wouldn't get it with your suburban @$$!" 🤣
Gaethje throwing head kicks was completely not normal I don't think anyone saw that coming.
I was losing my mind watching Dustin go out like that. I like both fighters and it would be cool if we can get a trilogy fight even though Dustin got KO’d just seeing both him and Justin go at it is always exciting.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢, i would be sad no matter who won, luv both of these guys
respect my man !
holding those emotions always, like a real man
I freaking love this dude....absolute class act..!!❤
Man these interviewers always acting like they gonna retire after. So many questions
A classy fighter!
That's a sportsman right there. A real dog in the fight admits when he fucked up. We'll see you again dustin. 1000 respects.
That reporter who asked him why he was grabbing his shorts has apparently never watched him fight before smh, embarrassing question.
The legend poirier❤
Win or lose, u r still my favourite. Don't worry ur day will come tomorrow
Dustin he always done that where he grabs his shorts. When the interviewer asked that I was disappointed
Compared to some barely intelligible Irish venom spitting this is a pretty classy way to handle a loss I guess.
I always said that was a lucky head kick cuz Justin does not throw high kicks it def caught me off guard when it hit lol
He needs a new sauce and call it Head Kickin Good Sauce
Snorier
Shouldn’t t have been so cocky pre fight, Be humble kids.
Dustin is the peoples champ for sure
Poirier , is not for ufc I never believed he deserved his rack.
The last question had to be the dumbest question you could ask. Dustin pulls his shorts every time when he fights typically when he resets his stances after punches thrown or taken.
Diamond dustin dillashaw at 145 would be unreal😂
Dustin you looked great! Rest, recover and let the fights play out in the future and something big will present itself. Stay sharp Champ!
This guy is awesome.  I hope he gets a belt before he retires
respect for a man who loses like a man..............YES I SAID IT IN 2023... LIKE A MAN.......................... men still exist bitches
This guy wears the worst shirts possible
Dustin is still the fukin man. Hope he don't hang em up. Just an easy real dude to root for. Respect.
"Win like a man, lose like a man", excellent shot at Mcgregor that crying puzzy.
I like Dustin but the last few fights he's won he hasn't been that "humble".
I got nothing against Dustin, but the other guy is better in fighting
I want to see Dustin win a title as he deserves it but can’t see it happening anymore
Nothing but respect for this guy
Damn, I like DP a lot cause this hurts me. I want to see him get one more title fight
Poirier v Gaethje 3 would be a Storm. Make it happen
Like pookie 😂
Dustin is G nothing to worry about these guys could fight again and it could still be a toss up.
Win or lose, whether people consider you goat or not. You're my favourite fighter and that's all i care about 🙏
If you cain't learn a thing or two from dustin then your doing it wrong...
Huge Gaethje fan but hard not to like Dustin. Class act and hell of a fighter.
You're wife is in my dms
If he's cutting so easy I wonder if he could from to 145 and clean up. Oh yeah, I just remembered that volk exists. Maby stay at 155😂
Respect to him took it like a man
He needs to fight at 170
Dustin is already starting to sound like Tony
How can you not respect and be a fan of this dude, he has become one of the best vets in the game. Crazy
You dont win like a man. A man does not punch another guy after he breaks his leg knowing damn well that the referee didnt notice what happened.
Dustin lost to a monster and people saying he needs to retire.. smh  Not many people gave Justin a chance and i just didnt get it. Justin improved the most bybfar between the 2. Crazy thing is he never uses his wrestling.
Dustin Poirier is the definition of a bad winner. He is full of sht.
Oh so you’re humble now huh? You don’t talk shit like when you won against eddie, hooker, conor or chandler huh? Ahaha it was so good to see you get knock out COLD once again
❤
Dustin has become such a respectable man. I love this man.
Dude always dusted when a belt is on the line. Charles, khabib now justin.. he's honestly shit. Never good enough to be a champion in any division. Can't even win a fake belt 😂
Dustin!! Bro "it's not a funeral " 💯 like a man!!!! I'm a fan for life brother and now more than ever...God bless and from one father to another that little girl who calls u daddy waiting at home for you is what makes this seem so worth it....
His wife is in Mcgregor's DM's. Cuck
The best!
Acts like a dick when he wins taunted Chandler, Hooker, McGregor after winning … then cry’s when he loses. 🤦‍♂️
Good fight Dustin just unlucky pal
Yeah we take these fighters for granted hearing “you work your ass off and you might even work harder than the other guy but sometimes it doesn’t matter” the mental strength these guys got is crazy man
Also maclife, that ringing audio sound is terrible. lol
Lots of respect dustin, what a great person, great fighter.. so much class on this guy, great embassador to this sport.. Love him❤
Homie said KO loss? Still gotta promote the sauce!
You loose some and you win some you still good man
So amazing to see this cocky loser get knocked out. Time to retire
God or breaks my heart for Dustin to lose. Cant wait to see him back in there and eventually seeing him wear that belt
Sleepy Justin
You had it Dustin rematch bec You shook him lol 😮
Dustin is one hell fighter impressive to he will bounce back
When your nickname is Diamond.. who cares if you win or lose.. I don't!  Seeing you compete is enough for all of us!
Dustin messin with his shorts thinking he’s fighting a easy fight like Justin had no chance lol
When he said I keep coming back like pookie, lost it😅
He's gotta fight Colby 🙏🤞
He's now on borrowed time the clock Is ticking less then 2 years last of the SAMURAIS
Sad thing is that Dustin will probably never get another title shot
I deeply appreciate DP. I truely honourable man/warrior
I might need one more hit -Goat
When dude asked about the shorts tug Dustin had a look like “you new here”🤦🏻‍♂️
Well spoken for keep ur head up Champ
dustin is a classy guy!
Dustin is a full blown class act.  He is a mans man. And never any shame in losing to Justin. Who they wrote the book on tough.  There isnt anyone tougher than Justin. He will destroy Islam bet that .!!!!
He talked alot of shit his last few fights humble pie 🥧
Honest. Humble. Respectful. No excuses. All class. What a G
Am i the only one that caught the Pookie from New Jack City reference? 😂😂
How can you not love Dustin man it baffles me. So articulate and real, they looked like 2 fucking ninjas in there last night. Legend of the game
Justin, ain't no joke
whoever asked about him readjusting his shorts is clearly new to the game
Dustin P , you are still THE MAN , we not hurt , and we don’t want u hurt , your still a champ in our minds bro
I dont know its humanly possible to show so much class and be this humble. Inspiring. Special guy the diamond
Both Champs! Legends!
He says he’s not a big guy and he had an easy weight cut but I’ve always thought he looked like a welterweight at the very least  Also he always tugs on his shorts every fight, that guy asking if it was an equipment thing
Another humble legend like Gaethje
Always a class act you’ll never see Dustin being a salty douchebag. Much respect we love you bro get some rest and come back 💪🏻 👊
Dustin….win or lose you’re a fuckin warrior. Justin is too….mma life💯
sick shirt but damn, justin washed him
Head up CHAMP! You got caught... you didnt lose a decision.. get back in there for the trilogy
wow man these questions were trash
Bet that’s some fire hot sauce! The diamond!
in what world does dustin win like a man? biggest sore winner in the sport
Dustin is the kind of dude you hope your son grows up to be like. Hell, he’s the kind of guy I’d like to be like.
You Da Man win or lose respect that’s what it’s about!!! Respect!!!
My favourite fighter. Unlucky to get caught so early by such a shot. respect to Dustin and Justin
I told my kids that The Diamond wouldn't have lost this fight, but it was Cubic Zirconia that showed up on the night.
His last win, He most definitely did not win "like a man", He had a sore ass
Gaethje fights the winner of Islam & Charles. Poirier fights the loser of that matchup.
Perfect shot. But if that fight was just hand to hand combat. And left on their feet. Then my money is on Poirier. However, they call it MMA for a reason.
dudes a scumbag man
I would like to see more of this act than trash talk. I feel I love this sport more when fighters respect each other.
They’re all little mcgregor 🦜 parrots!
I wouldn’t take a loss as a bad thing. In the fight game it makes a fighter sharper and more determined. Dustin in my book has nothing to prove. Dustin and Justin are both good guys and respectful. There will be a 3rd fight down the road.
That altitude lady
Damn hommie I was routing for you Justin
The guy that asked about the shorts, has never seen Dustin fight lol.
Legend.  Full respect.
Man asking about Dustin lifting his shorts just told on himself that he’s never watched him fight before
top man 2 great fighters respect
This man shines like a diamond in every sense of the word
So much respect to this guy
This is how you handle a loss... McMuffin should take note "DOKTOR STOOPAGE!" 🤪
I wanna feel bad for DP but he cost me $500 💀
The back up bmf
They are talking to him like he is done ...WTF. Dude is riding his prime...clipped indeed. he can win with Justin any day...
No flies on him, as he said, sometimes it sucks. That’s enough, a true warrior, a Gentleman and even without the belt(s), a Champion. Nuff respect ALWAYS.
I think most guys start fighting for money at a chance to get a better life. When you have a better life and different streams of income, or when getting knocked out sucks but it still feels like you’re winning…. You need to retire.
Hard luck next time will be better . 🥊🥊🥊🥊
Dustin was looking good out there, but unfortunately he got caught by that sneaky kick.
He slways pulls his shorts up. It just getsbthe shorts off the knees to move better
"Where I come from, Ive already won".   This is absolutely true, Poirier really came from nothing, just an average everyday kid from south Louisiana that saw the early UFCs and wanted to do that.  He made his dream come true.  He really is just a normal dude, a normal dude that focused on a goal, made it happen, and is now world famous and a multi millionaire.  Great interview.
Gotta love Dustin. Hated seeing him get knocked out, but excited to see them complete a trilogy. Both classy and badass fighters.
Justin got lucky with that shit
He’s just wanting to wait for mcgregor or a rematch
Im glad my guy is in good spirits.  He threw the hot sauce up on the table and I knew he was good.
Have never liked him.  Glad it happened the way it did.
170 Dustin time
Who tf was that guy asking about him pulling up his shorts. Has he never watched poirier fight before
Guy who cried over losing, fights for a BMF. I’ll award you for the SMF. SORRIEST. MOTHER. F$&@%
i hope this talk about him being a great boxer and one of the best stops cause hes mid af
he had no answer for why he keeps fighting the same guys hes beat   lol   he deserve to lose
Love seeing this poirier man i really do love seeing the guy lose
What a fucking warrior. Dustin is a great example for everyone
True vet but every time there’s a belt on the line his nerves beat him so Dustin beats his nerves he will be undisputed champ defo much respect
Love this guy...hell be back.
Dustin is such a likeable, genuine guy.
My favorite overall fighter, appreciate all u do DUSTIN
Respect for Dustin
Alot of fighters when asked about specific events in the bout will say "I will have to watch it back" or sometimes they just dont remember. Dustin always seems to remember the smallest details. A testament to his awareness and lucidity in the cage. Truly a student of the game.
Seeing this interview must be eating Conor alive. Dustin such a class act compared to Conor.
He is a hard-nosed class act and a man of his word.
Respect Dustin ! True warrior !
Dustin is quoting from the BIG BOOK!!!! At 4:21 he says one day at a time and one minute at a time.. sometimes that’s what we need to do.. we can get through anything just go super slow sometimes.. Dustin is a champ in my book..
Ideal scenario, Justin win's the title and then gives Dustin the rematch.
He definitely doesn't sound finished. He isn't saying anything about being tired.. and drained, etc. it sounds like he's still willing to get back in there, but.... what does the UFC do? I see his point of not wanting to fight for no reason. But now he has at least.. 2 - 3 fights most likely before he even gets back to fighting for the belt and that just seems like so much.
Swamp trash
*AND THIS IS STILL MY BOY*
Absolute gentleman love the bloke
Such a STUPID last question. ahh cmon guys
I don’t understand the hate Dustin gets. He gives the fans a show every fight by giving it his all, and yes he can be a little cocky but isn’t that what a fighter is supposed to be?
The question about retiring was weeeeird
I thought he’d blocked it, he got the hand up. But one of the angles show it connect right on the back of the head. Quality. Poirer/gaethje best to never be champ?
Dustin cries after every loss. Cry baby is Dustin’s new nickname. Geez always crying.
My favorite fighter and a big inspiration. ❤
The way he don't have any excuses or try to blame it on the elevation or weight cut. I'm a huge fan of both but I was scared for Dustin to fight Justin again, especially after what Justin did to Raphael
He’s a sore winner though? 😂
Dustin was winning the fight but that kick changed the result this is the risk in this sport one punch or kick could end the match.
He’s going back down to 145 after this emotional loss
Pure inspiration! 👏👏👏
Love him, but quit crying dude
I love this man. Great person.
Crazy after getting kicked in the head he still had the wherewithal to partial block that last punch...incredible! He'll be back
I love Justin hope he makes millions but i hope he doednt give connor a chance to jump into a title shot make him work his way up like how he did
The Diamond just can’t win a gold.
Huge respect to both of them I thought Dustin was in better shape but Justin has definitely worked on his combos an his fight iq was out of this world for this one
Respect 💎💎💎
He wanted to cry in the beginning but didn’t wanna get roasted again by Colby 😂😂😂
Conor broke him.
If life’s so good then what are you fighting for? You can’t fight for fun in ufc.
He looks torn up because he’s thinking about retirement. He should welcome volk back to 155.
Don't let your legacy turn into Conor's that's all I gotta say
Hall of Famer, forever the gamer, respect
These 2 and Derrick Lewis are the coolest fighters in the UFC,lots of class (except for hot balls). I just watched Lewis's post fight  before this one...
Real bamf
True champion ❤
Before after and even in the fight on all fights he looks ‘lost’..
“I keep coming back like pookie” 😂😂😂😂  underrated statement. You a king bruh win or lose
What a guy!
“Keep coming back like Pookie” is 🔥🔥🔥
Cry
100% PURE FUXZING CLASS!  If youre not a fan of Dustin, i hate your mother. 🫶
Couldn't find myself rooting for either. Such great guys. Great role models
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️DP is a Legend
"Where I come from I've already won" my man 🤝
So easy to respect this man
Hey Dustins got some really good hot sauce, you're missing out of you never had it   Really enjoy how the habanero shines in it
Bro said fight game is the pookie and I might need another hit hahahaha
If i win like a man i have to lose like a man, proceeds to Billy strut in front of a man in pain with a broken leg 🤡👍
Class act
The guy lost one fight and we are asking him if he's thinking of different options. He lost to Justin Gaethje... by knockout. Either one of them could have won. Justin and Dustin are both animals. I couldn't pick a favorite. They are both legends.
He took this like a man. That was a pretty nasty knockout, so I'm impressed he still made a point to come do press afterwards. Made no excuses. Fought back tears while still answering everybody's questions. Pure class in defeat.
"I've got tread on the tires. I feel great." - love this guy. class act.
here is the path: Justin faces winner of Islam/Charles DoBronx, wins, then we get the trilogy; looking forward to it; Dustin looked better than ever; Justin looked better, and bigger than ever
BMFs don't cry
Guys who do you think Dustin Poirier's next opponent should be?
One of my favorite fighters
Lol. Who thought it was a good idea to interview him after getting sent to the shadow realm?
GAETHJE NEEDS to win the championship and then get the rematch for the BMF AND the championship belt!!!!! THAT WOULD SELL SOOOOOOO MUUCCHHHHHH!!! I would bet that would be the biggest venue yet!
I predicted a JG knockout in the 4th.....he got it 2 rounds sooner.  I can't believe all you doubted him and made him a betting underdog.  He looked amazing against Chandler and Fizeiv.
Why people hate him?
This man really asked if there was an equipment issue with the ICONIC short pull up, cmon cuhhhh that's his thing
Fair play to DP. Does anyone else notice how much time he spends pulling up his shorts? 🤔🤷😂
You're our CHAMP from LA!!
Bro wth Dustin said it's like pookie keeps calling me. That was hilarious
Why did they tape up his hat last time and not this time? Is it because they realized it's not an obvious brand/logo and just a word?
Looked great in there as always. I hope dp comes thru again and don’t lose that fire
I REALLY wanted him to walk away with this belt. 😢😢😢 But I'm glad it wasnt a horrendous ko.
Good fight dudes are the same age!
It wasn’t pretty at all I’ll admit that but Alex lost.
This video killing my tinnitus lol
Dustin in a clown bro it’s all down hill from here I hope
They fought like Hagler vs Hearns grown man shit
He said like Pookie 😂 man I love Dustin
Classy in victory and defeat, honorable, and family oriented. You sir are a great man and a great warrior.
We need a trilogy asap!
Poirier is a class act....im glad Justin won but i gotta say my money was on Poirier. So hats off to both fighters...truly warriors.
Thats fighting man, anyone can be caught like that, just takes a second... great strat from gaethje tho, both incredible fighters, now we need 3!
This is fighting at a high level with no room for error or mistakes, and except the unexpected, this game is unforgiving
Dustin = warrior you'll be back! Trilogy is your win
Usman, a fellow boxer like Dustin, trained Gaethje to set that up for sure. Boxers lean to the outside when slipping those punches. Dustin, really didn't adjust in this fight considering Gaethje threw that combo TWICE. Disappointed for Dustin.
Dude asking about his shorts is his first time seeing Dustin fight or somethin
Dustin is hurting right here..😢
This is how you should act when you lose.  Class act!
Dustin don’t forget who you are it’s all good brother Lafayette stand up 👊💪😤
We gotta see a trilogy.  Heal up champ 💪
Mental that I used to hate him in his first fight with mcgregor! Total 360 now massive respect
I love this dude.. he's a real pro! Absolute savage
Louisiana's proud D.P. The 💎 still shines bright!
“Iv won life” ah he’s Copin hard. That Conor fight just made him hella rich
These two guys are true titans. Both sooo real, humble, diligent...real inspirations. Osss 👊
Don't be upset holly had a bad loss to it happened go forward ok y are a great champion honest guy
you are the manny paquiao of ufc dustine
Absolutely devastated for Dustin, he's the epitome of an honorable man. But, this is what happens when Justin gets tamed and shows up the fight with more than just raw ability. He's become more composed lately and he's having a lot of success. Justin definitely got lucky, but at the same time, he earned every single opportunity that came his way. This is one trilogy that I actually don't want... I have lot of respect and admiration for both men, can we just call it 1-1 and leave it at that :P
He’s a great competitor. He’s been in some wars and won with humility and lost with dignity.
How idiotic these reporters are. The FIRST thing they teach you is don't ask" how do you feel?", it's so pathetic and generic.  Sure enough...
I think this will be a good loss for him, it’s been a long time since he’s lost to someone who’s not a champ/striker. Hopefully he learns and gets one last shot
Conor and retirement. Awesome journey for Dustin! 💎
He adjust his pants every fight. Dustin got that dog in him lol he scraps like a guy off the block
Crazy the kick was still partially blocked and still connects, wow head kicks are real effective.
I am glad it lasted just 2 rounds and both are safe. They both are warriors.
Man Dustin is one fighter I always hate seeing lose, he's such a good dude.
That quote at 4:21 is amazing. Both of these guys deserve all the success in this game and it was a fight where you hate that someone had to lose.
Gutted to see Dustin lose, great dude. But he did lose to another great guy. These top lightweights are all just great fighters, it's always hard to see some of them match up because you don't wanna see either lose. Tony is killing me rn though....
Man I love the diamond 💎 he's so real with what can or will happen great dude thanks was a interesting one for sure man this guy is fighting tears but says he's staying an extra day then to his foundation straight g man love Dustin for this he gives to the kids legend this guy is humble and so real 👏👏👏👏 all I can say to him is let's see you again man I  believe he can get his title shot
Trying to be like Conor and doing a presser after he loses HAHAHAHA  Still not humble enough to accept the defeat either. “I’m winning in life” bro you lost. Nobody cares about your personal life we watch you bc of what you do in the octagon.
Damn a minute in and I’m already 🥺
This dude is a beast and he breathes this lifestyle!! Legends all have losses before becoming a legend
What a great example of a man.
I love this guy, so professional, loves the game, and truly loves this game. I can't wait to see him in the octagon again!
It’s 1:1, don’t worry. Let’s settle it. You were winning. Never mind. Win or loss is a part of game.
6:42 lmao, that was honest
Two of the BMF's on earth. Dana needs to get Porrier excited to get back in there, whatever fight that takes
A man raised without a dad has to raise himself up and decide the kind of man he wants to grow into. God bless Dustin and the man he's chosen to become.
MMA journalists stand alone 🤦  Dustin: I don't want to fight just to fight, it needs to be for something  Next journalist question: so are you interested in fighting up n comers?
Mf wife
The 💎 been my favorite fighter. As a gift fan you go through the ups n downs with them. Hope gets that’s 3rd rematch! I see 3 more fights for Dustin! Shit is crazy he said he walks around 178-183 lbs lol wtf
Sry buddy. God bless. You’re a good man, and my favorite active fighter.
Man these questions are so tedious. Let the guy go home if you have nothing to ask him. Er Dustin um it looked like your shorts were loose..... um.... were they?
Justin apologized or sum along those lines in the cage after the ko.  Dustin responded with “this is what we do”    Warriors.
Respect to dustin for Bing honest about not wanting to fight up and comers but damn a Dustin vs Fiziev fight would be awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oi adreno
Great fight. I like both these guys. Crazy how same kick to out Uzman just on opposite side.😱
We want the trilogy!
This Italian devil, preaching WAR from his third eye is BLIND as the devil always will do
Dustin’s such a G … super humble and just a down to earth guy … as much as I love Gaethje I was rooting for Dustin so it’s tough to see him lose like that but that’s the game anything can happen… we need a grudge match asap!!!!
Poirier is one strong and bad MF'er and seeing him reset and hold it all back while still talking as he does after a knockout. Much love to his family and were here wit the man 💯 I truthfully don't see him trying to do as Tony is because he's fought khabib, conor.. why would he wanna go and do that. 💀
The reporter that asked Dustin about him pulling on his shorts...he literally does that every fight.
Porier wins at life with the Big Lebowski quote. Respect.
Dustin is the scummy he wins like a complate ass 🕳 look at the hooked fight
Unbelievable man. Hope Dustin makes a comeback
Guy is such a good sport win or lose. He even laughs about getting knocked out.
So many of you must not have seen how Dustin was acting after the Chandler and Hooker fights.
This is class straight up. Was torn between Dustin and Justin, because they're such well rounded fighters. And class acts (case in point). But no matter what...great ambassadors of the sport.
There needs to be a 3rd. These guys a warriors
"I had Ants in my pants." 😂😂 As always, even in defeat he is a class act. Made me sad to see him loose like that, but I would've been sad if gathje lost again too. 2 of the best dogs in the ufc, what a fight. Justin better get that fucking gold! 😤😤
The clown has arrived. 😂😂😂😂
I strive to be like this man. Hats off to you Dustin all love bro you will bounce back
Humble classy dude
“I win like a man, so I’ve got to lose like a man.”   Two studs in the octagon...class, and humility from both.  Really cool to see.  I didn't have a favorite in this fight because I like em both!  That left hand was doing its thing until that kick came through!  Looking forward to the next fight for both of these guys!   Well done UFC and SLC!!
The guy wanted to make the fight interesting and make a great show out of it for 5 round but Justin didnt follow the rythm and surprised him.
Win gracefully & Loose the same 🙏🏼👆🏼
Let's have a 3rd fight.. Let's go!
Respect Dustin!! I love both fighters
Nice Mr Furley shirt 👍
C'mon Dustin you got 1 he now got 1. It wasn't that bad . I'm down for the next and still rooting for you Dustin 2-1 vs Justin. ( I like Justin too)
Man, that fight was tough to watch. Been a fan of both these guys for a while now, but I hated seeing that happen to DP. He's an absolute class act and a genuine dude. Wishing him nothing but the best moving forward.
Nothing but respect and admiration for Dustin. Hoping his 30th win will come soon!
Dumb reporter asking him about adjusting his shorts like he’s never seen him fight before.
That reporter shows how bad he is asking D about his shorts. He’s always hiked up his shorts legs during fights. Whether to dry his hands or just a tick…it always made me nervous and yell “keep your hands up!!!” What’s with wiping your palms on your thighs???  For years now.
Thank God for adblockers. These fuckers put ads everywhere.
That's Justin's hot sauce now, lol
Dustin need conor to give him the speech he have ryan garcia after his loss to tank.
Class act! I love the ufc!
Lol what happened when he won with chandler
Dustin’s acknowledgment of tread on the tires makes me think that these “supergyms” and team camps are better for the athletes overall. Yes, you don’t get as much full time attention from the coaches. But getting to bang around with high level teammates is a better judge of tire wear. Tony doesn’t have a team nor coach. He goes off feelings, which in Tony’s case is a bad idea he isn’t mentally stable to begin with (why he is such a great fighter I wouldn’t change him 1 bit), but like Dustin said he’s still keeping up with the boys at the gym and he knows he can compete. No one to ever say “no” is a bad thing.
It's not the biggest lost he's had he's good that's how u handle it
Such a fan !!!
Anything can happen in a fight at that level and it was a great kick by Justin, but I still think DP is the better fighter. Hard to hate on JG but this dude here is the realist to EVER do it.
I hate when Poirier and Gaethje fight each other 'cause i never want either to lose.
Gaethje needs to rip that belt in half and give poirer the other half deserved! Paid in full!
Aye all respect to Both they’re some  killers but I had Justin winning so I’m hyped 🤝🏼
Y’all soft in these comments, buddy was chirping when he beat Conor and Chandler talking hella crazy and disrespectful. KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY. Like you said DP karma is a mirror!
Hall of famer inside and out the cage. All the best to Dustin.
Dustins a warrior in this sport hes still a BMF regardless i didnt think this fight would go the distance 2 warriors going at it doesnt happen often i didnt want either of these guys to lose so it was a weird 1 to watch
props to dustin for that new jack city reference. yall youngins dont know about pookie. lol
Class act 🏆
Both great fighters as well as great humble respectful personalities.  It's just a shame 1 has to lose. Nevertheless you goto give top props to justin put that together top job.  Also great of Dustin takes a loss like a true warrior.  Both brill fighters and personalities.
CLASS ACT DIAMOND !!!
Everyone in this comment section is soft for porier grow up a man lost, almost cried and your a fan now because of that! A true porier fan would have liked him all the way through, not just coz the guy sounds nice after losing, you people are weird.
Great example of a class act champion! Justin just caught him. That’s why we love the sport because anything can happen!
He said like pookie 😂 the Diamond forever
Gaethje is the MOST VIOLENT
Class act
Arrogant dickhead in victory, humble in defeat. Classic Porier.   pAiD iN fUlL
Dustin and Justin are a big part of why 155lbs is the best weight class in MMA. Dustin will be missed. I really hope he gets himself into another title fight before the end as well HOF one day too
He is so torn up about the "legacy" part of this. If he only knew his legacy as it pertains to fighting was already solidified before he laced up the gloves tonight. Dustin, you are hero in and out of the cage. Fans can be Fairweather, but all those kids and families you help, they will never forget what you are. Thanks man.
Porier get to 170 u coward
Love this dude. Both guys are incredible.
💎
its time for mcgregor to come back and get that dustin fight. dustin can get another payday and retire unfortunately
Dustin is a fuckin legend  already  he is just so unlucky  in critical moments  he made mistakes that cost him 3 titles
How does an mma journalist not know that he grabs his shorts every fight?
Cutting from 180 to 155, but not a big lightweight...  Delusional.
I really like how he carries himself.  He definitely didn't lose tonight. This is all  part of his legacy and he's a Hall of Famer through-and-through both in and out of the cage. He represents everything positive about the sport. STUD!!! I think he has one last fight and calls it a day on a historic career. Hate that it doesn't look like he's going to get a undisputed title but even if he DID it changes next to nothing about how his career will be viewed. An undisputed title makes or breaks 99.9% of most fighters careers.... he is one of the ultra-rare fighters where the absence or presence of an undisputed title means very little in how their overall career will be viewed historically. For any young fighter, there's your role-model, that's the career you want, that's the legacy you should leave.
FIGHTING IS POOKIEEE 😂😂😂
Man I hate to see either one of these guys lose. Justin seems to take losses a lot better than Dustin. I don't think it's because he doesn't care as much, but because he has that dog in him that knows, he will get that back. Dustin, on the other hand, seems to take them harder (they both deal with defeat like champs), and it seems he doesn't see the light at the end when he loses. Either way, these two men are what should be considered the definition of a true fighter. They will both be an example of the golden age of mma. Future generations will say, "They don't make them like Dustin and Justin anymore."
Win like a man? Dustin is the sorest winner. But he does lose with grace
This is why you gotta love Dustin. Sad one of them had to lose but respect to Justin, legends. Hope to see a trilogy
Always been a huge Dustin fan... Dude is the best.
Dustin’s a champ. On paper or not, man’s a champ
What did Dustin mean when he said "I keep coming back like pookie"
Fighting this is war
Douchebag in victory but humble in defeat.
Great guy.. but a bad motherfucker title wouldnt suit him imo…
Trilogy in the works
I can only think of how Colby mocks Dustin crying everytime he looses 😂
Time to move up or back down to 145
Mixed emotions. Very happy for gaethje very sad for poirier. What a sport. 2 legends
Connor says he would slap justin. Justin would demolish connor.
Why is the audio always so bad ? Surely Conor can buy the company new microphones….
I never thought I'd liked a fighter more from losing. Dustin is an absolute dog and the trilogy is gonna be awesome. You have to be at 99% to beat dustin
Peahead is a bum
Never  will get a belt , just Diaz ...
4:09 😂😂 that’s why DP is my favorite fighter
man what a amazing and hard fight to watch i loved both these guys and i didnt wanna see either lose . You're still the man too Dustin
This just shows how bad Conor McGregor is now.
What a man
Dustin is a good man. Good example for young folks. I usually tell my son not to put athletes, actors, politicians ect on a pedestal however there are men like Dustin to keep an eye on. Facing life like a man, fighting back tears but still facing it and knowing what he has in life.
I love both fighters. But I always root for the guy that doesn’t hold up the Monster Energy Can. 3 Latin 6’s on that thing.
It’s not over for him, he actually has a legit have a chance to get back at the belt. He’s just emotional right now.
I Love you Dustin  dont worry you will get the belt you really want .
Dude loses every fight that is for a belt .. he seems like a cool dude tho
I FINALLY KNOW WHY HE ALWAYS ADJUSTS HIS SHORTS, I CAN DIE HAPPY
Godspeed
The diamond 💎. Class act. Living Legend
What am incredible guy
Props to the Big Lebowski reference!
The last reporter must have never watched Dustin fight. He has always pulled his short legs up during fights. Lol
Pea head
Sucks when you don’t wanna see either guy lose. 1-1 hope we get that trilogy
Audio again Oscar😁
Always respect this man 🤙🏻
DP is a great fighter love the way he handles himself
The best part of this is it sets up a trilogy
Dustin Poirier what a class act a legend and warrior we love you bro
The Brad Paisley of MMA.
This guy is the most honest spider ever. And I have been watching them since that documentary and keeping track of him. He has evolved into an awesome fighter but more importantly, an awesome human being easy to root for in like.
I have a half brother named Poirier.....Dustin would make a way better little brother!
Dustin is a warrior. Took the loss like a man..respect! Hope to see a championship fight between these two for a 3rd fight! Two of the best to ever do it!
Come to Maui ! With your fAmily ! You can stay with me
I betted for ya . Peace ✌🏽 hang in there .
We love you Dustin. Your a true warrior
does the guy at the end not watch the Diamond fight?he always touches his shorts like 20  times a round its his trademark.
In all seriousness that hot sauce is pretty damn good, I’ve always got a couple bottles in my fridge.
That question at the end...at least he was honest about it. He does it in every fight. Kudos to the media tart to finally notice him touching his shorts.
Damn I like Dustin so much better I'm disappointed the fight didn't go the full 5.
This man is as special as they come man, took a clean head kick and looked great up untill that point. Unfortunate loss but I think he will be back with more great performances in the future, didn’t look like he lost a step.
Unlike the loser Conner
One of my favourite UFC Fighters, all respect Dustin
Such a class act
The man sets a good example.  Tight.
this guy is a real fighter, unlucky fight both absolute warriors it will always be 50/50 with these 2
Crybaby peahead
Every time i bet on him 😢! Then, every time I don’t bet with him he wins. Or, I bet Conor lol and you know…
Just to help Dustin:He probably doesn’t remember after being k.o. You lost first round too!
We need the triology
I really hope Justin wins the title now. The 3rd fight being for the belt would be an even bigger sell than this
How can anyone not love this guy. These are my 2 favorite fighters for sure.
The guy asking about the shorts must’ve never seen poirier fight before
DUSTIN WON ME OVER WITH THE WHOLE MCCGREGOR ORDEAL. HES A BEAST. HES GETS JUSTIN IN NO.3
I’ll be buying his hot sauce, he just seems like a great guy & wins like a champion and loses like one as well .
What a bmf
I keep coming back like Pookie sounds like something Izzy would say. The whole time you would be wondering who is Pookie 😅😅😅
Bro most certainly does not win like a man, he's one of the most sore winners we have ever seen, just watch the post fight scenes against Chandler, Hooker, Mcgregor
You can tell this is damn near killing him, yet he sat there like a gentleman and spoke to the media. Much respect to Dustin.
They have to do this again! That didn't do the fight justice. I still think porier looked like the better fighter up to that point
🤣🤣🤣 “equipment issue” man don’t look too deep into it , this mf from Lafayette everyone fight like they got ants in they’re pants out here
Im happy it ended the way it did no matter who would have won. Somewhat quick and clean minimal damage, Im sure the families are grateful too. Yeah a ko is brutal but I I love both of these guys too much to enjoy watching a bloody war like the first fight. I want looking forward to that so im happy
The first time I back Poirier he loses 😅
remarkable nowadays that the whole comment section agrees on the same thing. Props to Dustin, really exceptional person. Justin as well
Dustin is a class act.
Let’s talk about the elbow from Herb Dean while Poirier was on the ground
Humble guy.. respect
Why would he want to want to fight up n comers smh. You work your whole life to get where he is and earned the right to fight the top guys cause he’s one of them it doesn’t make sense
dustin does not win like a man, let’s just get that straight, dude cries anytime he loses then shows no sportsmanship when he wins
lol, he cried talking about it.
“Where I’ve come from, I’ve already won” sent shivers down my spine
Dustin is a massive inspiration. What a man
Congratulations to Justin G . I couldn’t respect Dustin any more he’s a professional. For taking a head shock you could be in some serious trouble the brain 🧠 is fragile thing but he looks great very awake aware he showing zero signs of a head injury and that’s great . He will bounce back with a win that amazes us
This sucks Dustin always seems to lose his big fights like anything with titles
Since justin is fighting the winner of Charles vs Islam, makes sense for Dustin to fight the loser.
That shorts question.... Dustin always does that.
Great round it was eitherway. No shame in loosing like that. If he was winning all the way up until 5th and geting KOed like that that would be painful. This was just great combo from Gaethje. If they were to fight once more I's still bet on Porier.
Incredible human being absolutely incredible ❤
I don’t give a fuck that’s the true BMF of the UFC I don’t care who has the belt. It’s Dustin Poirier until the very end I don’t give a fuck what anyone says
Dustin is a phenomenal fighter , but when come into title shot he seems always unlucky 😢
It would of been hard for so many fans for either one of these BMF to lose. Both such amazing fighters.
Dustin Gaethje vs Justin Poirier
"it hits like pookie" 😂😂
“Where I come from, I already won”.
Poirier is a true warrior, no excuses no disrespect just always ready.
He’s still a stud and a good loser,didn’t make any piss poor excuses he’s still a hometown hero here in Lafayette 👏🏽 Congratulations to Justin,I hope to see a third fight.
Future Hall of Famer.  The true fans love you in the good and bad. You're one of the legends of the sport.  Respectful, articulate and the literal definition of a class act.  Thank you for all you do.  We are proud of you.
That “pookie” reference was top tier 😂😂😂
well done and well carried dustin....good man....go home now and get a beer
Both are gentleman. Stay up Dustin. 💪
LOVE YOU BROTHER HEAD UP ...
Without a doubt one of the greatest lightweights to ever do it.  Nothing but absolute respect and admiration for Dustin.  He'll be back.
True champion
So happy to see Dustin go night night. Fake boy went sleepy 🥱
Bro really asked about his shorts😂
The way he articulate the fight games is what life is all about. Just cause you put in the work dont guarantee a W at the end of the day! Keep grinding Champ! You are inspiring many peoples lives out here!
Was the dude asking about the shorts trolling or what the fuck was that? Hahaha
He scared of Colby that’s a big fight but Dustin scared of that man he would whoop Justin
This was one of those fights that unfortunately somebody had to loose. Both are awesome warriors and hopefully only good things in the future for both of them.
Dustin; @ 4:26 “I have won life, where I come from I have won”. WOW! Respect.
Dustin, the guy is truly a diamond.
Lol soon as they mention 170. He don't want none of that colby man
He say “you know” 100 times
Dustin is the BEST! Two of the best fighting for the BMF and it sucks that there had to be a loser because they are both winners!
Anyone who has to say they do anything like a man. Means they aren't. Just do it, boy. Jeez.
Cool to hear him acknowledge that the belt does mean something
Dustin "Pookie" Poirier
Dp is a class act in and out of the cage he has my respect indefinitely!
Straight dawg ❤
This dude does NOT win like a man. He still talks crap and beats his opponents when they're down. What a fraud.
The new Jack city reference was damn funny.
Justin fought an up an comer.  He took the risk fighting down.   Dustin should too at this point
Man sucks seeing DP dropped like that, whats crazy is that he still blocked it wirh the hand but Gaethje put all of his power into it. Crazy sport
Love seeing this dude lose, I don't know why.
You know what the difference between Dustin and other fighters are? Dustin feels the need to _say_ "“I win like a man, so I’ve got to lose like a man”, whereas other fighters just *DO* it. Other fighters just *take* the loss, instead ruminating on how they should *FEEL* about it. Does that make sense? Most other fighters don't sit there and go on these introspective monologues about how they need to feel about this loss, and being a "man" about it and all that. Most will simply give props to the other guy, say that they themselves had an off night, and just say that they'll be back in the gym next week.   I'd say those people are the ones taking their losses like a man.
All Class.
Man, this is why I love fighting. These killers at the end of the day are the toughest BMFs out there win or lose they are honestly great men and very inspirational to see stuff like this. This is how you should carry yourself, especially in defeat. Much respect 🙏🏻
Nothing but class this guy Connor you should more like this guy.
You either make poirier fight beniel or fiziev either or is a banger fight
The loss hurt him more than the thunder kick.  Handling it like a champ regardless 👏
Dustin, you are an inspiration. You can't keep a warrior down
Win or lose you can’t hate on this man. None of these shit talking fucks would ever get in that cage let alone with Dustin.
Poirier and Ferguson should retire.
Respect to Dustin showin up here. Credit Justin for perfect head kick. Damn wasnt expecting that
A gentleman imo
Listening to this man has made me hate McGregor who I once loved, to now loving him...hes such good person
I hate MMA reporters. If you watch more than 1 of Dustin's fights, you'll realize he has a tic that's pulling his shorts up. The guy asking if it was an "equipment issue" is actually comical. Get these guys outta here.
U can tell the dude who asked about him adjusting his shorts has never seen him fight
Dustin is the man win or lose.
Dustin is such a good dude! honest and humble. I wanted Gaethje to win, but much love and respect for Poirier. To me, if the fight again so be it, but I'm not wanting it ASAP. To me the're even....back to neutral.
Thats how a bully lost
What fight were people watching? Gaethje was winning throughout.
Now it’s Gaehtje vs Conor at some point
DNA of a warrior.
Dustin is a sharp a loveable dude.  And thr hit the Big Lebowski joke.
Dustin always a class act
Always a tough spot when 2 great guys get in there. Didn't want either to win or lose. Difficult stuff
Thank you to the man who asked about the shorts 😂 I was like Dustin let go of your shorts bruh 💀
L E G E N D 🌠💗
Love the pookie reference! Justin what a class act, congrats to you sir you still win when you lose!
Nothing comes eay for this man.. but he ALWAYS comes back harder than before💎💎
Respect big dawg
Poirier always comes back ready. "He'll be back for that hit." He's a warrior. Poirier vs Gaethje 3, the Trilogy. As a fan, I love it.
I hate to see this guy lose. He is literally the pinnacle of what a lot of men are striving to become, but if it had to be someone win and take that BMF strap, then Justin would be the only deserving candidate as far as I'm concerned.
Win or lose this guy is a inspiration 💯👍
God bless you Dustin
The Pookey reference was great.."It just keeps calling me, and calling me!!!"...🤣🤣🤣
I did not see poirier getting ko'd out cold like that. Wow, Gaethje a savage
Dustin is the definition of a fighter. Will always be my favorite
Billions dollar company, 1dollar microphones.
Much respect, Dustin! A game of inches, you were looking good, and just got caught. It is what it is. You are still a BMF!
how do you get a job as a journalist and not know the thing Dustin does with his shorts??
If you’re a fight fan… boxing or mma you can’t hate Dustin ❤️
DP is never mentioned in the pound for pound conversation but he should be. I know this is cliché but it’s not your losses that define you… it is whether you get back up. He will be back.
He wins like a dog. I hated him for what he did to hooker post fight. Justin got revenge for Dan imo. And Dan hooker still bmf out him up against justin
Was a big shot I don’t think Dustin should consider shit over after that
I'm like pokie it keeps calling me back😂😂love this dude
Respect from slidell lousiana.
You are such a humble amazing person. Keep being you. You have already won at life, mate. Big love n respect ✊
jesus UFC spend some fucking money on your audio and mic set up. Also dont really need to see the trilogy. We all know this fight can go either way very quickly. If they were to fight 100 times it would be 50 wins for dustin and 50 wins for justin.
"My life is good, my family is good, my daughters are excited for me to get home.. I've won, I've won life"  This guy gets it, massive respect and inspirational stuff wheather you are a fighter or not. McGregor could learn a thing or two from him.
This might be one of the best dudes in sports. A gentleman and a beast.
Respectful winner? He mocked  a man with a broken leg. Covington is right about this fake
So much respect for this dude, an entertainer and a fkin professional.
I new gathje was gna beat you
The shorts question was silly. Rhythm man.
I had ants in my pants! I can imagine how difficult this time is for you and you are still standing! Nothing but respect for you Poirier!
Dustin underestimated Justin he though he was gonna use the same tools
I love Dustin so much!
Your a legend Dustin respect to the 💎
The last question was so stupid. Guy obviously hasn’t watched one of his fights.
I love how he says no matter what win or lose I've already won in life Dustin is a Class Act a true warrior
Fave fighter
I was so torn with this. Two of my favorite fighters. God bless both.
Well at least you only get bumped down 1 spot. Still keeps him at the top. No shame in losing to Justin, dude's a beast.
"we're not at a funeral here"  🤜🤛
Damn man
sure sure
Dustin is not only showing maturity but showing the heart of a champion.
47 Fights 👏
Come on Dustin... you're not walking around at 178... you're 195 plus all year minus fight weeks
All time favorite fighter. Goat shit
Sad to see Poirier lose, especially so early in the fight, but honestly felt like he looked better than Gaethje and would have got it done, if not for the headkick. Either way, big congrats to Gaethje.
Why couldn’t he win like a man against Conor lol
I hope he doesn't retire man, he still looked great. He has such an entertaining style to watch, such crisp boxing.
Dustin is a bad man. This fight between him and Justin was a tough one for me because I love both of them.
Kinda sounds like he may have wanted to retire after a win. Love both fighters.  Hated one had to loose.
He should retire soon, that was brutal
They both looked slick out there.
It was so satisfying seeing him knocked out.. So sweet
Probably one of the best post fight  interviews I’ve seen.
He don’t win like a man, he’s a bum, he a big asshole when he wins.
That's what a real fighter is all about!! Always feel humble!! Go Dustin!!
Justin is a beast and what a knockout. Huge respect to Dustin. Dustin will always be a warrior.
Think Dustin deserves a real title shot.
finally a guy ask about his pants
fuck Poirier is tough
The realist
It’s crazy cos he’s a cocky winner but not a sore loser😂
We all knew u wasn't going to win... U get their to the finish line and u just can't ever cross it... Sorry bub, ur just never gonna be the top dog...
Respect
That's all it takes. 1 punch, knee or kick to the dome and it's goodnight Vienna. You could be totally dominating a fight, be the better fighter but one good shot landed and all that means nothing. Respect to both fighters. We all want to see the trilogy at some point.
sauce fairy an el -jumbie needs to retire now ")
I fn love this guy!!
He said he was waking up around 178lbs during camp. My goodness how does he weigh out of camp. Man these guys cut to much weight  just to have an advantage. I can't respect that
Figured Gaethje would win and we'd end up seeing the trilogy, nice to be right about the Gaethje win now couple years see if we get the trilogy
The good thing about Poirier losing is that it makes them even setting up for a tiebreaker in the future! After they fight a couple of other fighters unless either of them retire before the rubber match can be made! Good luck to both, may neither of them lose til then.....
Conor will be back to terminate
“The theater of the unknown”
Dustin’s a real g
That’s a beautiful mindset.
When a fighter says he feels like he won after losing.... Its because they were paid to lose...
killer shirt what is it
Rigged fight lol. Leads with a jab consistently waiting to be ko’d. Feel like he was baiting a third payday to me.
Scripted. All scripted
Conor McGregor
Love this guy from 🇵🇰. He always put on a show no matter what. Keep your head up brooooo nothing but respect for you 💯 you will be bounce back 💪
DP is the man, not makin excusses like a stud
How did no one ask about the leg kicks wtf
I thought he won the first round he looked on point. Sometimes you just don’t see them.
Trilogy
Dustin’s a boss
🤣🤣 he said beneil “ehhhh” sayinf he had no chance
JOLIES WOIFE
If you notice his fights, he pulls up his shorts all the time.
Dustin just doesn't had too much to loose, that's why he is talking about sacrifice, sacrifice that Conor for example didn't want to bring
A true class act as always.
I love the Marvin Hagler hat!!! He was my favorite fighter growing up. That Sugar Ray robbery still bugs me a little.
As much as I dislike this guy he is a class act.
The level of humanity, wisdom, logic and accountability that those elite fighters display. It is as if politicians and elite journalists are not even the same species as mma champions. They are classes apart
Lmao😂😂😂😂
The guy that asked the last question never saw dustin fight before :D
Win lika a man my arse ,you little cry baby
Big respect.
The Lafayette king!
He does not win like a man. He wins like an arrogant child. He’s forced to be humbled by defeat.
Dustin vs loser of Charles and Islam
You shouldn’t be surprised because he’s done it before. That’s the hidden dagger
Even a bigger example in defeat, what a true warrior
Total Class always from DP
I want this guy to win the belt man
I love Dustin. Such a good dude.
4:00 new jack city reference for all you kids that have no clue what tf hes talkin about. Chris Rock played a crackhead snitch named Pookie
The "reporter" who asked Dustin about his shorts is such a casual. He should never be allowed at another conference again.  "Was it an equipment issue?" Mofo, you ever seen a Dustin fight before? SMH.
Justin in a new zone right now. He manifested this “ everytime i land it does damage, so now I just have to be patient”
fuck it’s hard watching dustin hold the tears in. u don’t love mma if ur not a poirier fan. fuck if he’s a sore winner and loser he brings it everytime and best believe if u hate him or love him you’ll watch him when he’s on. one of the best
Gonna be honest, after the first round I thought Dustin is clearly the better fighter and he will start picking Justin apart, but hey, mma is a crazy sport.
You damn right Dustin!! you’ve already won at life my guy.
Wow honestly Justin is my fav but Dustin is now right up there now. What a great man his spirit and way of thinking is so dam inspiring. God bless you Dustin.
Dustin porier is a gangster.
I mean run it back, let JG get the title fight then do the trilogy.
The fact this guy actually met with the media after that. I love dustin, this dude is a warrior. And such a good dude. Thanks for setting such a great example for people.
Everytime he lost, he cried. Be a man for once.
1:02 naw bruh this is what Justin does.  Thats his trick its a mindgame to make you believe thats hes not all there so that you let your guard down and come closer. He does it in every fight just go watch em. Head kick knockout for a bmf title id be upset too but dont be actin like Justin was ever not in control of that fight. He would have won no matter what.
Dariush vs Poirier is the fight to make. Both coming off KO losses to other high ranking contenders.
I respect him so bad 🔥 that rematch needs to be done
Big Fan of this guy.  Great fighter but got caught 🤷🏻‍♂️.
He gon cry in the car
Could've went either way, it's not a reflection of him getting worse or anything like that
The reason he lost was because he’s been on his high horse since beating Conor. Wel done Justin
I couldn't like Poirier more.  What an absolute stud.
All class Dustin 🙌  you re a legend of the sport bro. Take some time to recover then come back stronger fam! ❤
You guys need to fix your mic clarity. It happens often.
Hard to see and great to see at the same time. Both awesome fighters!
Dustin’s a true warrior. Put it all on the line, win or lose. It’s gotta hurt to go out like that, but that’s the risk you take when you go for something big. Most people will never take a chance like that.
Intresting Dustin says he has no intrest in up and coming fighters. I think thats what leaves alot of weight classes stagnant.
Respect to both fighters, could’ve gone either way
Dude is a UFC legend 👏
Champ hold your head high,you are one of the best ever to do it.. You are going to bounce back we all know that.. Keep Rocking 💪
L
Let Gaethje fight for the lightweight title and then Poirier would fight him again for the third time because now it’s 1-1
Lost like he was at home asleep 😴
I still believe he’s one fight away from another shot at the title don’t give up hope Dustin your fans still want you here.. you just got caught don’t beat yourself up to much brotha 🤞🏾
You got to love this guy.. Win or Lose this guy is CLASS
He fights like a man, loses like a man but definitely doesnt win like a man, trashtalk after a win to the guy you just beat (hooker, conor) is more disrespectful than any pre fight trashtalk
reporters push for retirements so much now its disgusting
Forever one of the all time greats! Regardless of wins and losses.. titles or not. Spot in the Hall of Fame secured and your place in the history of the sport has been secured for some time now. God bless you and your family Dustin!
Respect no matter what to be fair! Legend always
Dustin knows he’s still rich lmao that nigga don’t give af
To me he was winning until he got kick hahaha. Man Dustin was moving good
1000% class ! What a role model ! Just sucks whenever a belt is on the line ! Justin just cant catch a break ! Respect!
Poirier. Pure class.
Not many people get KO'ed and still make it to the press. Respect.
Theres no one like Dustin, absolutely super person, absolute warrior of a fighter, Justin got lucky, Dustin will be back, awesome character
What a guy, total respect!
The reporter that asked him about pulling up his shorts must be brand new 😂😂. Bro he's been doing that and the hair slide since the beginning. Keep your head up Dustin, your a great dude. And while your at it, keep your hands up as well 😂 jk jk jk
Should’ve fought colby
If Gaejthe wins belt do the trilogy for the belt for sure
If Dustin not interested in fighting up and coming fighters he needs to retire
DP is class man, trilogy will be fun 🔥 1-1
Dustin vs Colby next year
Respect Dustin your one of the greatest fighters in the world
First class
We gotta see part 3 in the future before they both retire
Awwww lmao. Lil DP trying to not cry 😂😂😂 you acted trashy to people you beat. Colby was right about him. Thank god for the beating Justin put on him 😊
Haha 😂 lol lol good night Dustin 😂
Taking the interview for the product placement
The last question was such a casual fan question to ask. Everyone knows pulling his shorts up is a Porier thing.
42nd fight in MMA. Thats a lot of training and alot of heart. Great man. Nothing to be ashamed of. Still proud of you Dustin.
DP you sir are the man and are one BMF weather if you have that belt or not. You two are both BMF’s and yes losing does suck but like you said you already won in life and if i could create a fighter it would be a mixture of you both. You are a real peoples champ much love from Ohio 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤
Will always be my favorite fighter.
It’s actually kinda strange to me there’s no like clear cut best fighter in the UFC. Nobody is above being knocked out cold in the UFC and its kinda crazy. Other than like Jon Jones who hasn’t met that sort of fate at some point?
You won in life my man. Thank you for being a true role model, an inspiration throughout the years leading by example how a true hardworking and humble man should carry himself.❤👊🤙
Justin owes it to Dustin to have the trilogy
If Dustin isn't interested in fighting up and coming prospects then he's got to get out of the rankings. He shouldn't be able to squat on his spot. Gaethje had to fight Fiziev, you know?
Dustin is the MAN
What sort of reporter doesn't know Dustin likes to grab his shorts
I think the last question almost made him go Nick Diaz on the reporter...(newer fan's type "Nick Diaz stupid questions" )
Poirier is the absolute definition of a class act.
Louisiana swamp trash gets what he deserves 😂 keep running from Colby
You’re a true man and an inspiration! Thanks bro!! Much love!
Sad to see Dustin here. Don't quit man, the fans love watching you
Dustin was going to retire after this one you can tell
Respect... I was gutted bcoz the fight finished too early...
This guy is a real role model
Legend of the game
You're always a winner 🏆 🥇
Worldly dustin and humble justin. Such great dudes, i hate to see either lose.
I am so bleak. I dig Gaethje... but man Dustin is just so likeable.    Here's hoping that the trilogy happens.
Dustin and Justin are both awesome fighters. Every time they fight who knows what will happen.
9:40 this guy has clearly never watched a poirier fight before
Well finally he's not crying for once
Class act
Diamonds are forever! Next fight, best fight!
Dustin knew that most probably was gona lose. And now he knows if they fight again he defenetly will lose. Ghaitje is too much ofrece everything for him,eve if Dustin is técnically better in most aspects
so glad dustin lost
Dustin you are a true warrior and a top of the shelf human being. Awesome press conference with humility and professionalism.  Absolutely one of the best!!!
Seriously? you're trying to push hot sauce or whatever it is. lol
Needed to be humbled. Great job gaethje
Dustin Big fan It's not the right time to show a "war"hat, thaugh
Played the poirier drinking game for this one 🤮
Not gonna lie. If that fight went a little longer, Justin’s the one gonna get koed the way he overreacts by dipping right. The knee or uppercut would find his chin
I like both fighters and it’s hard to see one of them have to lose. I was pulling the little bit for Gaethje,, because I’d like to see a third fight between them.
Great fighter, great man.
Selfish dude behind the curtain. When he was coming up he had many vets take a chance fighting him... now hes the vet and says he doesn't want to fight the up and coming guys and only wants big names. I get it fighting is a selfish sport but someone that goes around acting like Dustin does should shut his mouth and fight whoever is ranked next to him.
Dustin real g
Good fight brother the amount of shitttt these guys go though to entertain us smh 👊✊️👊👏👏👏👏
Damn! Props dustin..
I lost money because of this guy
Such a champion I see him winning the trilogy you both are the baddest you have inspired me
Justin and Dustin is a true sportsman!!!
Class act. Anything can happen at any time. Getting caught sucks when you're on the receiving end. Timing and opportunity met. It was Justin's turn.
He should get into media after fighting
Cant wait to see connor welcoming dustin in the ghost club.
Don’t always like Dustin but got to say he takes his licks like the best of them fair play
What a great man!
Man tough loss! I hated this fight because I like both fighters and what they represent.
Best case scenario, Gaethje beats the winner of Oliviera vs Islam.. let’s say it’s Oliviera.. that means Charles gets his loss back.. then Justin gets that loss back from Charles and gets the belt.. feels that buzz of being champion.. Dustin Fights the trilogy for the belt and wins and gets his taste of being a champion.. that way everyone got their loss back, made it to ufc gold and can retire accomplished as deserved! 🤙🏻
Win like a man? I didnt see him winning like a man against Hooker or Chandler… 😂
dude said fuck these prospects. Poirier a real one
This guy is #1 BS.
Obviously the media person that asked Dustin about his pulling on his shorts doesn't know the fighter he's asking a question to. Do your damn homework dude and don't ask a stupid question. Dustin is a straight up class act, love that brother win or lose 👊
Yeah the adjusting the shorts was annoying as hell. Also the hand pushing hair to the side when you have a fade and no hair to push.  Those aren’t good things to be doing while fighting. Thought this guy was good but like he said he’s got nervous ticks! 😅😅😅
You won the watch game Dustin 👌🏼 , that thing on Justin's wrist looks hideous 👎🏼
The Diamond is a Class Act!
Did the last reporter just realize his short adjusting in this fight? Thats something Dustin has done for a very long time
Ha ha ha butt face lost. Poor him and his hot sauce
Still a champ in my eyes! Well done poirier. Both great fighters, but I have respect for poirier.
No shame CHAMP
Guy is legit the worst winner
Love you Dustin, you’ll bounce back man!
Dustin trash wife will leave him cuz he is not bmf lol
Huh?? He doesn’t always “win like a man” I’ve seen this clown be a sore winner so many times against other fighters. Dustin getting headkicked into oblivion was the most satisfying knockout of all time.
Who’s the journalist who asked if it was a equipment issue with his shorts, like bro, Dustin does that in every single fight when resetting🤣
Top 3 Lightweight of all time. Respect DP!
I love that down syndrome guy won
Dustin with the sauce 😂
Dustin such a champion man  He will be back  Great role model for the sport
man's don't need no belt to be a champ or a goddamn BMF, the world knows that shit.
This guy is a great actor! Bet he had guys with a ton of money on Gaethje to win that fight he was ready to go out anyways! This guy doesn’t want to fight anymore!
Its crazy even when Dustin was out his body was telling him to get that hand up because it’s that’s instinct for him
Damn this dude got STARCHED. That was crazy
Mac Life bringing the HD sound quality 👌 UFC channel is basically mute..
Been watching Dustin for 10 years now, he’s a real one
He’s the worst winner ever. Glad he lost
Through back Marvelous Marvin Hagler  Cap ..    WAR!!
He was more worried about his fucking hot sauce than Gaethje.
Hahahaha
I'm a very big fan of Dustin Poirier & Justin Gaethje, wasn't wishing for any of these men to knock each other out & didn't want to see Gaethje losing as well..    Good Men, Great fighters. Congrats to Mr Gaethje for belt.
I love Dustin's ability to take this loss as a man.
Keep ur head up Diamond, ur the man
Its the side of the head. Dustin has always been wobbled when he gets hit clean on the side of his ears. Perfect kick and it was lights out.
What a humble fighter. Listening to him makes me dislike what Connor has become all the more.
two absolute class acts. the way this guy handles himself is immense. no excuses. only winners when these two fight hopefully gaethje gets the belt and we get the trilogy
That hotsauce is weaksauce
Respect
What?!?! You don't cry when you win! 😂 jesus, Dustin is tripping. Didn't see the "billy strut tonight"
This man is a fan favourite for life. A real role model for the sport.
Very humble guy that's why i like him. He is a real man 💯
I'm glad he lost, because now we need the rubbermach 😁
Ladies and gentlemen this is how you should LOSE Still a fan if you Dustin winner in life machallah
Class!
Win like a man, lose like a man. Good man.
Can’t win them all,but at the end of the day Dustin beat McGregor twice and avenge that loss and has put on some amazing fights and won them….
Tough time for this guy. Mcgregor had to drop Dustin’s wife back to the arena for this fight and she came just in time to see the knockout 😢
Excuses Dustin

Respect for coming out. That was one either guy couldn’t really afford to lose at this point. 🙏🏻
A true gent. I absolutely love this man
One of the best to ever do it out of all weight classes. Respect
props to dustin no lie... but u cant just sleep on justin like that... especially now a days where hes patient and chooses his shots very carefully... not like back in the dqys where he would just throw to kill or be killed..
Big respect bro
The dude is better loser than he is a winner. At least he takes a loss like a man, stop acting like a child when u win tho. Cringe
Casual comment in the end
No u can still get a title shot i know this i was at ur camp?.aka 1036...nw 42 drive coral springs fl my family born there from lv n delivered at coral springs medical center please donate money 2 coral springs medical center thnk u
To me he has been champ for a very very long time. McGregor were title defenses.
Top man! Respectful in defeat! As he said he already won at life! Much respect Dustin❤
This himself my reason 2 live u Dustin porter i lv u n family u gods helper u a everyone hero i need more chemistry of ur D.  N A...ur hero
Top fella.
AYO FUCK DEM FANS 😂 I COULD SWEAR THE WERE CHANTING USMAN BEFORE HE GOT SALT LAKE CITY HEAD KICKED TOOOOOO😂😂😂😂😂❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 (fans are the best)🤞🏾😂
At last the bmf belt is on a dude who deserves it
Shout out to the Utah Reporter chick for repping Utah on all these interviews. Every fighter so far has had nothing but love for Utah.
About to buy myself some Poirier Hot Sauce. Who cutting onions 😢
Your still a BMF Dustin.  I competed for fifteen years in scholastic wrestling in New Jersey and I FEEL you
He said "I come back like Pookie"! That's awesome Dustin is the Man
876
Make my tear when he loose he loose tear come out❤❤
I have never respected and admired a man like I do Dustin Poirier. He is the living embodiment of class and humbleness. Family man, business man, and he never makes excuses. You're the fucking man DP
need more fighters like dustin! not a single excuse! just recognition on what he did wrong! what an unbelievable and honest man! much respect! and well done jg! what a performance! but dustin is the best loser of all time!
The Women's division be like...                  "WTF!?"
Colby scares this guy
Will there be a rematch?
he came back to show his sauces 😂
My two favorite fighters and some BMFs.
I hope they double ko each other in the trilogy
Shout out to Poirier tho for saying exactly what needed to be said post fight while maintaining accountabiliy.
We understand u bro. Dont worry about it. U don't have to proof something
Class act
top competetor
WE ARE MEN!!!
I see why Colby calls him Dustin soyrier
Did not want to see these guys fight  Each other 😭
Major props to Dustin. Humble in defeat. Some fighters really need to take note of that.  Side note, what a dumb question at the end asking about DP adjusting his shorts. Do some research,  Like watch his previous fights, he has always done it.
How can he say he only wants big fights when he's never been World Champion? Clown 🤡
you wanna talk another bmf.... out Cold and then interviewed shortly after and humble af... bmf champ regardless.
Follow Jesus Christ see prophet William Marian brenham
The pants question 🤦🏼‍♂️ have you ever seen him fight?? He does it all the time!!
Dustin should fight beneil now that fight would get either fighter back in the mix even if it doesn’t sound exciting it’s the fight that makes most sense right now
Poirier is a champion in this Sport and an even better human. 👏
How can anyone not like this man???
Why does every time he gets beat 1 of the 1st things he says is "I had him hurt".....
WTF is it with channels posting fight results in the thumbnail?
U can’t not like this guy I wish this guy gets the belt b4 he hangs it up he deserves it bmf belt ik Jorge hated putting that belt on Justin
U sleep like a beauty too🤣
Dustin been through some crazy wars last few years, top fighter.
What a sore loser !!
For the record- everyone from Louisiana understands the tugging the shorts thing🤣 it just becomes instinct because you always gotta keep ya shorts from falling down while fighting lmao
Hahaha enjoyed that kick sending Dustin to the shadow realm
im surprised they didnt send him off to the hospital after that. Usally post KO crew don't do interviews.
Dust😂dead😂😂😂😂
nice watch DP, and finaly feels like he came back to old DP we love after this loss. he changed after connor wins i didnt like it
Keep that head up DP--your fans love you and you make us so proud. Let's get 'em again
I was rooting for Gaethje. But I'm taken back by how well Dustin handled the loss, gotta respect it.
I love how this man makes no excuses and at the same time you can feel how disappointed he is, that’s never easy to do especially when you put so much into what you do.
To me it sucked, that one of these guys had to lose. Both are model, true professionals. Fight the right way, no BS, straight me v you. I think Dustin should wait to fight the loser of Makhachev/ Oliveira.
Caught him with that leon edwards special
Poirier should avenge his loss to MJ then hang them up
Dustin is entertaining as hell in the ring and a class act on the mic. Hoping he rebounds and gets another crack at the title in a year or so. Also looking forward to the trilogy to this series.
I remember when everyone was saying WSOF has no good fighters
respect real shit
Dustin you will always be the champion. I’ve been your friend since fightville days. Fight the good fight forever. We are so proud of you!
Dustin has consistently proven himself to be a solid, honorable guy. A real fucking G. Nothing but the utmost respect for this dude.
Dustin a real bitch holding up a ranking not fighting any real up & coming contenders
I'm 99% sure we will see the 3rd fight between these two in a year or two
He’s a terrible winner da f.
Frustrated mediocre fighter :))) just like his sauce:)))
The way masvidal put the belt on Justin was sub par.
Hands up to this man! Class act.
I keep coming back like Pookie! Lol
Such a class act.
Really respect dustin.. alot of people don't do this after a Ko
Why do I feel like this shit is fixed now or now maybe I’m crazy
Dustin and Justin are some of the most wholesome humans on the planet.
Dustin is awesome
Definition of class
Themaclife consistently has better sound quality than ufc in these post fight press conferences
That pookie line tho
Your wife is in my DM, s 😂
So happy for Justin 🎉 dustin is going to retire
Hahaha I'm glad dustin got ❤
What a terrible performance. This guy should have retired a long time ago. So paaast his prime.
Hooker rematch. Book it.
There must be third fight as it wasn't a convincing win to end the chapter i still think dustin was winning it.
You definitely losing like a man Dustin - I can see it in your eyes.....i just wish they had some tissues up there for you
Respect
Love you man💜💜💙
Humbled like usman
Justin got lucky. It happens.
You are a winner buddy doing well in life
Absolute banger of a fight 🔥 Dustin is all class but this is Justin’s time
Equipment issue 😂 Actually did notice him pulling at the shorts, used to do that in Soccer.. I like how he gave an honest answer, yeah it was a nervous tic for me
What a man 👏🏾🖤
I'd like to see him against nate
Jolie will have the big strap on out for Dustin when he gets home.
Love this guy!  One of my top 5 fighters for sure
I got beat up by a bull today...respect bro. Got to lose like a man.
Like pooky hahaha Brilliant, what is it New Jack City, it just keeps calling me man,    ( ° ᴗ°)~ð  (/❛o❛\)
That’s what I get for saying you’re the real champ after beating Dan hooker and talking shit after the fight😂he’s so insecure
He Def don't win like a man, bit at least no bohoooing this time😂, god bless him tho❤
What a stud even in the loss
Love this dude
Crying? 😂😂😂
Dustin porrier a baby
In a weird way Im happy it at least ended quickly. I didnt want to see these guys leave a piece of themselves in there tonight. Both of them still clearly gave a lot yo offer to thr sport.
your wife is in me DM'S
Great example
Absolute legend!
What an absolute pimp
Like that Marvin Hagler War hat
Lmao. All of a sudden he’s hood? Oh until he switches to his family.
Dustin is a still a BMF in my eyes.
The working class heart of DP doesn’t stop. Gets KOed and has to talk about, but still puts his hot sauce on the table. Seeing him with his hot sauce feels like when a dad gets a new grill or something, it’s endearing as shit lol
Hot sauce 😂😂😂
this man just cant win a belt
Guy is completely delusional. He wasn’t winning round 1 at all.  And he k owe there is 5 light weights right now who would run through him. He doesn’t want to fight them because he wants to protect himself from being a gate keeper.
Man askin about Dustin’s shorts must be a casual
Hahahaha
Warrior
Dustin Poirier is a true warrior, classy in defeat , he will back 👏👏👏🫡💎💯
A gust of wind and he does the chicken dance 😂 nah fr Dustin is a GOAT, respect mate
Crazy how people are hating because he is getting emotional. Winning means everything to these type of competitors. Most don’t know how it feels to lose something as important as this. I sure don’t.  But it’s all respect to Dustin.
I hv become a new fan for the diamond you such a class fighter
Well done Dustin we love you from Cape Town South
Dustin needs to retire
Tough go
Well at least he isn’t concussed. Huge respect to him though for doing the press conference and giving the answers he did. Also huge respect for Justin as well for being so chill and respectful in his W.
Sore winner but a humble loser
Except Dustin has a tendency to not win like a man, the dude is the sorest winner there is but at least he is gracious in defeat.
The last question reporter asking what was up with Dustin pulling his pants up?? The man does this in every fight, wtf kind of casual question was that. Dustin looked a little turned off by it.
I have so much respect for Poirier. Conor McGregor got me into MMA and I’m still a fan, but there’s no doubt who’s the more respectful and humble guy between the two. Really wanted Poirier to win this, but still great to see him positive and respectful after a loss.
Go again Dustin so much respect for this guy
Poirier is a class act... He's definitely a winner in life regardless of this L  I wonder where he goes from here?
Respect uso, both fighters looking real good 💯
This guy is showing so much personality and humor as he ages...amazing
This dude is an inspiration, not just as a fighter but how to approach life. awesome stuff
Got knocked the fuck out
Justin was soo dailed in as Trevor said he is fighting like a champion
Porier humble in victory or defeat learning so much from Conor
I didn't know who to go For. The fight ended as it did. I like a real man you took It on the chin came out to talk to the people. Nobody, nobody will know thather than A fighter or a man who repents for his sins in front of Jesus Christ. God bless you and your family. And I hope you believe and the one and only savior.
Comeback stronger Dustin ❤
Keep sleeping soirier the cringe soyboy
This is a graceful warrior. Big heart.
Dustin is a great winner and a great loser. Super humble dude.
Man of class
I relate so much to Dustin. We are tough men sure but have a hard time holding those tears back when things go south
Win or loose this guy is awesome, takes a lot of guts to interview after a loss.
Class
He didn’t bring the violence, knew he was getting knocked out within 2
Colby dustin catch weight fight would be AMAZING!!!! 160, 165. But the beef is there. They are both stars
This is hard for me to watch
DP the only fighter who is more toxic when he wins than when he loses. This guy makes you root for the other guy every time
Hope he goes out like robbie Lawler
Diamonds are rare love you DUSTIN
75% predicted poirier will win, I said justin will knock poirier in round 2 & I was right. Hahaha loser poirier eat that.
Dustin is my favorite fighter. He takes evey fight never says no. He is the real guy!
Huge respect Dustin. Win lose or draw I’ll always root for u.  Anything can happen at any given time. You won before Justin wins tonight. You are both warriors. A trilogy fight is a must. I really do hope it is  for the championship belt if ever justin get passed Islam. I know you will come back better than ever as you always do after a loss. Meanwhile have that vacation with your family and enjoy. You deserved it
Love you  Dustin!!! 💪💪
Respect
One guy i never liked but over the years hes grown on me hes such a dog man
True fighter this guy
Much respect to you Poirier. You took the loss like a champ. You da muddafuggin MAN. DIAMOND DAYS🤙
Props to Dustin for referencing "Pookie" from "New Jack City"!
Dustin came up short but he will prove me wrong in his next fight 🔥🐐
You are still good boxer
I won money on Crawford and lost on porirer so I won nothing and lost nothing
No way retire yet he’s only 34 still young but for sure wanna fight someone that leads to title so go back home with family and reassess and see where you go from there you’ll be back better then ever
Dustin is the man, period
the guy asking about Dustin grabbing at his shorts must be a casual…if he watched the fights, he woulda known dustin does that all the time
Dustin doesn't wanna fight upcoming fighter he just wants direct title fight.😂😂 ain't happening buddy
I love how Dustin will probably retire before he gets to the "Tony territory". Fought the whose who of the division and made millions, perfect career honestly
Future Hall of Famer!  Nice to see him being respectful in defeat, quite opposite from how he behaves when he wins 😅
Gaetje did an Edwards vs Usman kick. Out of nowhere.  Pretty  equal before that, great fight.
Still a legend of the game and a great human, head up Dustin!
Definitely not ready to retire I was rooting for Justin but you are one of the best fighters you’ll be back and beat the next fighter whoever it is don’t see anyone else beating you so take whatever fight get they win and come and I stronger
Class.
Poirier is the definition of class. So glad to see he’s come out of this KO okay. Gaethje also a legend and this is what this sport should be about. Win with class lose with class. Big respect
Great fight to both ustin’s I was not expecting a flash ko like that from gaethje I’ll admit, but I hope poirier comes back stronger.
Class act
You the real champ Dustin you’ll be back Better then ever
This fight was tough to watch. 2 of my favorites. Poirier and Gaethje are both class acts. Great win for Justin and I’m sure Dustin will be back.
To see such a skilled veteran at the top of the division have to accept defeat after having his opponent hurt like that is hard is tough man. You can tell how much that one stung clearly.
And you blocked it damn son.
He fights the loser of Islam and Olivera . Simple
Excellent first round. Was surprised Gaethje threw a head kick. He is lucky to not have been destroyed by a knee to face cause he kept ducking down in a much different way than I’m used to seeing but he was head rushing into the knees . I’m also Confused as to why Justin won’t throw inside leg kicks at all. Blown away by the KO. Beautiful main event and much respect to Dustin. I started off against him because of Conor but the man can obviously fight and has excellent stand up. He doesn’t have much upward trajectory in his career considering the contender and title shots are booked. Who could he fight, Beneil? That makes no sense and he’s the only fairly relevant person for the job. I guess 6-10 would be a nice come back fight but where does that get him. In order for Dustin to get a title shot he’d need 3 wins in a row. So he would potentially fight 6-10, Justin trilogy if Justin loses and then a interim belt more than likely. Idk if Dustin has all that in him. He should retire and call it a career but I’d like to see him stay truthfully. He’s taken enough punishment tho. Hats off to Gaethje , good luck. Start wrestling brother because you already know how to kickbox essentially. You need to go and punch Islam in the face and go for a single leg. Knee the body and go body-head w/punches for a 3-4 strike combo and  while you wrap one leg, hold , thrust and throw/drop him and yourself to the floor and finish that man. He can not fight off of his back and that’s well recognized because of Volk. He’s also able to get KO’ed because he has been and he’s human. Stay center and don’t fear his striking , you are Justin Gaethje, bmf mad man. Get yours !!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think people will start using head kicks.
well they are 1 1 now
I’m sorry but Dustin does not win like a man. He’s always been a sore winner.
Lol nobody saw the high kick from Justin coming, wasn’t just you dp
Dustin had him a little hurt end of first. Not enough to end the round or fight but
1Ko each, we need the 3rd fight asap!
man idc i'm still pouring that Poirier hot sauce on the wife's bhole tonight
@6:07 delusional.
2 absolute savages, they could fight every weekend and it'd be fireworks every time. Pure respect to both of these guys🤙
First question "how you feelin at the moment..."  I honestly see why so many fighters get annoyed with the stupid obvious questions.
Dustin doesn’t win with respect. He trash talks his opponents
Humble guy and a class act
Dustin is an absolute legend! So inspiring even after a loss. That rematch is gonna be epic.
This guy is so nice guy and big respect for this man i love his mentality HUGE LOVE FOR DUSTIN ❤
Your wife is in my DMs
Class act.
Win or lose  huge respect for both guys
He doesn't win like a man
Timestamp of when dustin starts crying.😂😂😂😂😂😂
“I win like a man”   “Was the biggest shit-winner when beating mcgregor” 😂😂 Dustin is one of the besttttt fighters EVER in the lightweight division but god. He is the fakest little cry baby bitch to ev grace the sport.
audio is awful get it sorted tramps
The sauce salesman to the last. Maximum respect to The Diamond, great interview again.
Need the third tbh
wtf is gaethje even doing throwing headkicks? thats not fair.
His career is over.
MUCH LOVE DUSTIN BAD ASS CAREER SICK FIGHTER REAL OG OF THE SPORT KEEP UP THE FOUNDATION YOU ON ANOTHER LEVEL COMPARED TO SOME  THESE FAKE ASS FIGHTERS
This reminds me of one of my accounting courses in university.  I studied like a bitch and still got a C 😅
really feels horrible when you get knocked out cold then right after that you show up with Louisiana hot sauce .
In all honesty, I think Dustin should go and fight Colby. Great matchup, neither guy likes each other. Storyline is there. Otherwise why stick around? Nate Diaz isn't coming back for a bit, no other lightweights that make sense for him... Just seems like the next step. Or fight a setup fight for the Welterweight title, seems quick, but otherwise step away from the game and enjoy the success.
Keep your head up high Diamond....You're the best! You will be back and thanks for everything you inspire me everyday
He's a great man!.. respect .
Dustin thought he was the goat lol
You don't win like a man tho...you go over to your damaged and hurt opponents and rub it in their face to kick a beaten man while he's down. That's the opposite of winning like a man.
Dustin your so fuckin awesome man. Great example for other humans. So cool. I hope you keep grinding. Your too good not to. You are still in your prime.
How can you not like this guy? He's always humble! I have to say the same for Justin!
Great fight and great fighter it happens
Anyone hear colbys voice ... ehmm  ehmmm... I'm louisiana swamp trash... paid in full... ehmmm... ehmmmm...
Dustin you are the true BMF in my book, heal up champ. Winning in life is way better than any belt. Comeback better than ever King Of Lafayette ⚜️💎✊🏾🥊🏆💯👏🏾. As a fan it stings to see you lose like that but, you are the king of bouncing back DP 💯💯✊🏾💎⚜️👏🏾🙌🏾!!
Hopefully he fights the loser of Olivera vs Islam
Name of the game Dustin is a beast have to see the trilogy at some point
I would’ve loved to see a world where DP and Justin had their moment as the champ… Justin still maybe have that slim chance but the title dream for DP is over it looks
Man I'm such a fan of this guy! And yes as a fighter aswell, but really as a person! Such a stand up guy!
Justin and Dustin are both very classy.  Humble in victory and defeat . Connor is the exact opposite twitting “ Justin I’ll slap you around”.  That douche is envious of a fighter who wins because he’s washed up and can’t win even in coaching.   God bless all the humble and classy fighters.
So glad he got flatlined
The classiest of class DP is the man
What a beast. Don’t want any sympathy. Win like a man, lose like a man.
No mater what ustin stil win
There always the trilogy at the end of the day🙏🙏✌️
I’m glad the bully, DustinSorie got kick on the FACE! What a great moment in MMA history!
I keep coming back like pookie- The Diamond. Great fight man trilogy for sure.
Dustin is the man.good winner and humble loser.
Says the worst winner ever 😂 wtf
Hot sauce , help me guys, I need some donations please 🙏
Diamond strong my man
man wish he was my dad, I may be a little older but man, wish he was my dad lol
Finally this simp got ktfo
Class. Admirable guy
Dustin was controlling the fight pretty well too 😩
Dustins still my fav mma fighter win or lose.
Been watching Dustin since Fightville, hes the man. Hats off to Justin 🙏🔥
Whenever life gets too easy for these guys they all lose. All this dude cares about is his charity and his friggin hot sauce
Win like a man? After every win he turns into a douchbag n that cage
Class act Dustin   You can’t not be proud of him
Dustin is a legend no matter what 🙏🏽🔥🔥
Jolie’s wife 😂 if he won! he would’ve act like a spoiled child again lol I can’t believe how people still buy this class act bs
Was rooting for Dustin, Next time Dustin.
Dustin is a real man, lucky to have this man represent the sport. Thanks Dustin, your a true warrior & more importantly man of character.
“not excited fighting upcoming fighters”           ……..🦆
It's hard not to feel sorry for DP. You put all your heart and soul into your dreams, wear your heart on your sleeve and give it everything you've got..... only to lose in front of the world and then have to smile and pretend it's OK for the cameras.  I would have loved to see him win a belt but it looks like we have another Chael Sonnen here. Like he said though, he's still winning in life.  So, I don't feel sorry for him.  No man wants to be pitied. Instead, massive respect.  Whatever he does next, he's earned my respect.
I remember when I watched dustin fight conor the first time and I was like man he got destroyed, and then I watched him fight at 155 and just watching him grow his skill set and maturity in this sport is remarkable. Pure warrior spirit with great work ethic and a humble personality. Always a top g. Favorite fighter of all time.
this guy is soy
A title or belt on the line and you can bet your life Dustin will lose 😂 glad to see him humble a bit
Well if you look at the bright side you didn't make any money either because nobody bought your fight they bought the Crawford Spence fight.😅
Dustin is the most " almost great " fighter of all time
Conor nowadays living on past for some years now! Things are not the same.Top 5 at leight weight will ko Conor under 2 rounds.  Izzy became the no 1 star,Jones is back.155 as usual is abundance of talent.  Conor is nolonger required for ufc.Its hard to believe it but thats the truth.
Dude solid. You represent Louisiana well.
Met Dustin at ufc189 such a good human ❤
Colby gonna have a field day
If the rubber match happens in future for the belt, it could be one of the biggest fights in ufc history
All I can think of is Colby covington fake crying saying “paid in full”😂😂😂
I LOVE THIS DUDE.    ROLL TIDE
Huge respect to Dustin..I will not lie i was rooting for Justin...but how cannot you love Dustin..they both are deserving and humble in victory or loss!
Dustin you’re one of the best no matter what from here! True warrior spirit and embodiment of what a UFC fighter should be! Amazing company man, gives a lot to charity, puts his family first and fights for everything with all of his heart ❤️ you have won in life!
Nothing but respect for Dustin Poirier
Gaethje thought he was still sparring with Usman in the 2nd round and there he unleashed the headkick😂😂
Talks a lot of shit when he wins but real quiet after the loss
It is like these journalists have never watched a Dustin Poirier fight before. He literally always does the "wipe hands on shorts" in almost every fight.
That hat is marvelous Dustin
A legend even in defeat !!
Chin up, man. You did great.
I was there! Seeing Gaethje flip off the cage after he won is something I’ll never forget!
Shit he was rocked good then he speaks like nothing happens this dude is a big deal
bro still the goat
He lost like a pea head
How does he hold back tears and talk so well still lmao when I hold back tears I gotta take a 2 minute break from speaking every 20 seconds 😂😂
What a great dude💪
That reporter at 6:06 was good! Guy knows how to make fights 😂
Lmao “win like a man” he’s the sorest winner in the ufc he’s always a douche in victory
Bro really asked about some shorts 😂
Doesn’t need anyone’s sympathy. A dog will be a dog I’m impressed DP
“Where I come from, I already won”
Dustin's an O.G, he'll be back...  But how bout Gaethje!!? Never sleep on that dude, Guys a frickin animal.
Dustin still the man! Still want to see him as a world champion some time.
Why do people hate porier? He's an articulate speaker, he's a family man, and he does so much to help his community
Love you, bro. Keep your head up
I bet on fights but I could not bet my money on either side of this. They're too tough. They're both warriors. They both have KO power. I couldn't call it. I asked a friend who also bets, who he chose. He said DO NOT BET YOUR MONEY 😂. These two guys will always have our respect. Warriors. Toughness. Heart. Class. Thanks boys
Love ya dusty
He doesn’t want that trt smoke from con con.
Dosent even seem concussed wtf
He will be back and retire with a W gonna miss this guys fights when he’s done the 💎
What a man, great fight with two warriors. Respect too both of them
Win like a man lose like a man, A real champ
Are you interested in fighting new peeps eerrrrmmmmmm NO 😅
I love this man. He could have won and Gaethje even admitted luck was involved, but Gaethje showed up tonight. God bless these men
What an absolute legend'!
Am I high or did he make a New Jack City and a Big Lebowski reference? …I mean I am high…
Love this guy
The underdog won what a finish.
DUSTIN YOU A DOG BRO YOU A LEGEND ALREADY MY GUY JUSTIN CONGRATS MAN KINDA SAD THOUGH FOR DUSTIN MAN HELLNOOOO
What a Great role model !!
Trilogy
True man o honour... Respect Dustin, stay true!
he ain't a sore loser but he definitely a sore winner
JP is an NMF
Dustin is the man
Dustin the only fighter to take a loss better than a win
I had a feeling Gaethje was going to get it done. He is a beast and so underrated.   Good on Dustin for coming to the press conference after a KO like that.
He handled the loss like a real man, respect Dustin win lose ur still the man.
Dustin is a hell of a fighter, can’t wait to see him holding the undisputed title one day. He deserves it so much! Keep your hands up dustin, your time to shine will come, definitely!
Headshot dead
Youre the man dustin!!!!no one can take away your success!! Stand tall my dude!!
Dude asking about his shorts must have never seen him fight before lol
I can’t wait to see Conor’s tweets.
DP will always be soft when it matters.
Always class Dustin
I don’t think he was unconscious, but he was definitely seeing stars
do he sale hot sauce ?
Dustin is a sell out, be could have been Champ had he chosen not to fight Conor for the Third time. He might be the most liked but he'll never be Undisputed Champ.
Idgaf I knew Gaethje made the proper improvements and would find the shot, I called this shit and placed a bet on Gaethje beforehand, insane. Props to Dustin though will for sure tune in for what he’s got next, very skillful.
He set up the kick by using it.  Somehow
I don't think they will do a trilogy, but I wish they'd give Volk the titleshot after Charles, that way we'd get to see these two fight again.
Wow, chanting Justin and he still finds someway to make me sympathize with him. He gets life and life of fighting. Good man
the reporter who asked about dustin grabbing his shorts needs do his research, dustin always has done that, it’s not something new lol
Diamond the people’s champ 💪
Putting it on the line it happens.   Bless ya
I think Dustin should wait, wait for the Charles fight, wait for the Gaethji fight and then he should get it
👊 Poirier 👏👏   That's my Dustin, Perfect Gentleman
He's just not that interested in fighting anymore. That's cool too
Huge respect for this accomplished man.
literally almost shed a tear watching him get headkicked and this presser is partially why. what a fucking amazing man. personally i think he should retire, he's made plenty of money and the only fight that makes sense is the gaethje trilogy, which gaethje won't take until he's had a title shot. take some real time off, enjoy the fruits of your labor. if you do come back, you've still got a fan here
He’s finished. Even Justin. He’s finished too. These guys just need to retire.
Always great to see Dustin get humbled
Dude is such a genuine article. This fight was heartbreaking because I didn’t want either guy to lose, I definitely didn’t want either guy to get hurt too bad. They’re both just the cream of the crop. Dustin isn’t done
Ton of respect for doing the interview, keep shining bright diamond 👏🏽
I admire both of you, could and would not pick a winner.
It’s interesting how Dustin is one of the most graceful losers in the sport but at the same time he’s one of the least graceful winners in the sport
That question about the shorts... is this the first dustin fight that journo has ever watched or something ? what a stupid F'n question.
Maybe I haven't watched enough of Dustin's fights, but why was he constantly pulling up his shorts. It reminded me of some fool in the street who keeps pulling his baggy pants up. Even though it's different, it has the same results. Ur distracted because ur messing with ur shorts or ur gear and that should be the last thing ur doing while ur fighting. If he pulled his shorts up 25x, then that's 25X someone can time it and catch u while ur doing that crap. That's not the reason he got kicked but in the future someone training him has to tell him to stop doing that crap. It's wasted energy and he's constantly dropping his guard. Respect for coming out and speaking to the media after a tough loss. I'm not a fan of his , but that takes a lot of heart.
So much respect for BOTH of these guys. Could’ve gone both ways. At the end of the day both are true definition of real fighters and real men. They are bringing back true class to the sport now, when sour loser- leprechaun McGregor is gone.
Had a weird feeling Gathjae was going to get it done but mannn! Dustin should keep his head up he's still a legend regardless
You got too love Dustin a real fighter…
I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that his punk ass was gonna get knocked out by Justin. Justin has evolved into a monster since their last fight. I don’t know what the hell he’s talking about how he won the first round. He was getting peppered and that leg was getting torn up. He was definitely getting softened up for exactly what happened. Dude’s been lucky at best his whole career and has only been a journeyman at best. He’ll never be a champion.😂
Dustin lost me a 6 fight parlay. I honestly thought I had it in the bag by the time it got to him.
Who are these journalists? “Dustin you were adjusting your shorts a lot, was there an equipment issue?” 😂 dude have you never seen a Dustin Piorier fight before?
dude is always crying
Sucks man, I was really pulling for Dustin. Love em both but I still think Dustin is the overall better fighter/boxer etc. anyone can get caught tho, but can’t take away anything from Justin, props!
Justin had to finish Dustin otherwise Dustin will take him to deep water again. great finished by Justin G. Dustin had a great career  Legend in the sport 👏
Fucking could’ve asked him anything and asked him about pulling at his shorts
Take the hat off Dustin , sending the wrong message especially after a 2nd round KO
Nice Ko Loss
I thought porier would win again i mean not like it was a given or sure thing but i was expecting him to have the edge boxing for sure.  That head kick was like the last thing i thought was coming in this fight the first round i was just thinking no way it ends in 1 shot these guys fight to the death practically every fight then second round he caught him i was like no way.  Props to Justin though dude is a warrior although i expected porier in later rounds i am good with either of these guys getting the W to move up the ranks. 2 of the only fighters right now who draw crowds but don't have a single "dramatic moment" in their highlight reels everything they got all the hype is just off pure talent and determination.
What a great man! What a great example! When you handle defeat like this - you are still a winner! Thank for your greatness, Dustin!
Dustin just retire.. you don't got anything left to fight for you said it yourself your not interested in fighting up and coming fighters... your had your shots at the belt move along..
Reporter who asked about Dustin messing with his shorts clearly has never watched dustin fight before.
Swamp trash isn’t crying after this win ? What a Surprise
Respect Dustin. You're already a winner my guy. Gaethje threw that kick so close. He's sneaky like that.
Win like a man and cries everytime he loses. That head kick was one of the most satisfying ko’s of all times. Always loses in the big moment 😂😂😂😂.
Win like a man ??  He is a terrible winner !!!
Does anybody know where I can cop that shirt?
I think they should create NMF and he can fight Stephen Thompson . 2 nicest guys out there but killers
inspiring
Not at a funeral today. Alls good. Simple. Lets ruck.
👏
Porier is the lunch pail blue collar fighter. You don't gotta like him but you betta damn well respect him!! Thanks for always putting it on the line champ!!!
Dustin you look like your cut took too much out of you maybe it’s time to go up to 170 respect, great fight great loss.
At least he got a interim Belt 😭
He took some damage in that Chandler fight... I know its been a few but that was a brutal fight and i wonder if maybe he was not all the way good from that
❤❤❤❤
Patient Justin unlocked, now we just need to get Dustin without adjusting his shorts and hed be unstoppable
You the man Dustin win or lose. Champ shit!
Dustin is STILL one of the goats!!! Love you man, win or lose! Dustin Poirier is still a legend and a true warrior! Stay up, Dustin!
dustin is the true definition of a real man. in every way. congrats to both
Last question not knowing the dude pulls his shorts up every fight and especially when he’s grooving cmon man
Feels good for gaethje, but its so hard to see Dustin get knock down like that..😢
Run the trilogy!!!
Dustin should just retire tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️ nothing excites him in lightweight that isn't a title plus he doesn't even need to keep fighting. Only thing that can be interesting now is him trying out welterweight imo.
It was close, but I'd say Dustin was winning the fight before the headkick. Trilogy would be a banger.
Headshot dead ☠️!!
They gotta run this one a 3rd time?
No worries Diamond it’s just 1-1 with Justin. You are a great fighter! Yeah sucks about the belt but You’ll get the third fight soon.
Dustin took it like a man! He is The Interm, "BMF" champ!
Media = maggots.
Just a Warrior
You can tell Dustin has been training in Florida because he has a Cuban accent now 😂
Bring your wife and rise a middle finger to Gaethje as well🤪🤫and see what goes on🤭🤪
He shud of thrown the knee like the coach told him too. Bro almost kicked his ear off
My love for Dustin. He knew, he will tKe out Justin after the 3rd,  but it was not his night.
What a class act…Dude has won me over as his career progressed.  Honour, courage, work ethic…the whole package as a man
Huge respect to Dustin Poirier ❤❤❤
Mad respect for Dustin.
That's what u get for being a sore winner, now cry.
"Errol Spence & Dustin Poirier both did the post fight press conference.".
Absolutely devastated but this guy is the definition of no bullshit, win or lose. Enjoy him while he's here
💎 gent .
I think Dustin would have won if it wasn’t for the belt. He always lose when a belt is involved
You already know theo wrote that Pookie shit 🪨
You did amazing dp 💎.... Hopefully justin beats islam and ya get the trilogy....huge inspiration...i had a few amateur fights in Louisiana....stay blessed...dont hang ya head
You the MAN !! Win or lost we all take wins and loses make sure to know what a win real is!!! And learn from the lost !! … stay Golden man!!
Respect ❤ warrior❤
Bow out Dustin, it's time to realize you'll never be a champion.
I’m sorry but the BMF title is the dumbest shit the UFC can do lol
man that line is too deep for connie mcgregor
This guy is great until he's fighting for a belt lol
Love the hot sauce
❤
Dustin is my favourite ❤️
Fake asf
Anyone would get knocked out from a kick like that but DP looks abit “chinny” if you know what I mean
DP not meant for the title sadly.
Dustin is a good fighter..
Everytime it's for a belt american tap team choke 😂
The 💎  is a beast regardless future champ 🔥
But he’s a dick when he wins
Dont fucking retired! That fight was tense as shit and he has so much fire to give still. Lets fucking go!!!
If we're being honest with ourselves here, Dustin wins like a complete bitch. I'm a fan of the guy but as humble as he claims to be in those moments, he certainly doesn't show the same gracefulness as most.
He is not same hungry dustin
Nahhh 😢😢 💔
Lmao what a bum
mcgregor small d riders waited for this moment for so long
Dustin is one of the best to do it and hands down my favorite fighter . He will be back , he’s never lost back to back fights . This dude is an absolute legend and such a humble dude he is comfortable in his own skin and knows his worth . Nobody would have done a press conference after that. But he also didn’t get knocked out it was a flash KO and defiantly a lucky kick by Justin he even said so after the fight . Keep your head up Dustin your the man
Blame the Brenden Schaub curse. The fight could be a lock, a sure thing and if bapa picks you then the fates have decided, your time has come.
Respect to Poirier and congrats to Gaethje
Dude is a legend! Best in the game! Carries himself with nothing but class. One of my favorite fighters. Congrats to  gajeth, well deserved win. he has improved his skills bigtime and it showed tonight! Much respect to both fighters, they are both top tier l, notice there was no beef and nothing but massive respect across the board!
Aka “i worked harder but its rigged and i had to flat line on the monster logo as if im jesus and mock him”
Class act
If he doesnt want to fight up and comers hes basically stuck then
That last guy... doesn't watch fights cuz he would know DP always does that every fight
Even at this stage Porier’s eloquent and sharp. Maybe just take a couple more big legacy fights then ride off  into the sunset.  I’d love to see him join the commentary team, too. It’s always sad when a legend leaves the sport.
Justin was winning before that head kick. I think even without that Porrier was gonna lost that fight.  Great he did the interview post loss though! Most people skip it
I like DP, he’s an OG but I will say he seems extremely entitled. Him not wanting to fight any prospect (or guys lower in the rankings) is just asinine. Dude you’ve fought and lost to a majority of the top 5 fighters in LW already. Just fight someone lower on the rankings- the winner of Fiziev and Gamrot
My man has NO excuses
I need to try that hot sauce 💎
Once a wise man said(colby)25min paid in full😭i deserve that
170 ? Dustin?
Shut up Dustin , I am still crying brother. Huge huge fan of yours . Man feeling so sad for you 😭😭😭.
these journalists are the worst. what shitty questions to ask.
Dustin is the man. Much respect.
Charles & Khabib fought the ideal way against Justin.  Not giving him space is the best way i guess. Justin is way too fast and way too powerful.   Make him grapple and he starts getting tired.
Poirier has never been that guy
That’s the best questions MMA media has
Justin put the fear of God in this man. Both are sick. Looking forward to the future 🎉
Yo yo yo
I was afraid of which Justin we were gonna see. A technically sound Justin is a whole other animal
Is the guy asking Dustin about adjusting his shorts the same guy kevin holland said was new and "it shows?"
Both are BMF ❤
HOF example
One of the greatest LW's of all time! Much respect to the man 👊
We love you Dustin you’re a straight up warrior! Don’t get in your head about any of this you’re a legend in the sport and you just added another legendary fight to your legacy!
Kick was behind the ear, debate me 🤷🏾‍♂️
The biggest NPC in the sport
I don’t get Dustin he says he loves fighting but he wouldn’t fight Beneil. Dusting in my opinion is just looking for money fights or title shots even though he’s gotten two title shots against two different opponents.
Hope he doesn't end up like tony.... After this KO loss. 🤙
The last dude asking his question must have never ever seen Dustin fight
Gaethje robbed us fans of the war we were expecting. He didn't wanna go 25 with Dustin again.
What is puki?
Poor guy. You really feel for him! I'm suprised he didn't read that kick. Gaethje can lie all he wants but after I saw that him throw that kick in the first round you knew he was gonna throw it again in the second. For sure he practiced that kick on kamaru so he wouldn't get caught with it in leon usman 2. This guy's deserves to be a champion tho. I hope he gets it. Hands down one if my favorite fighters!!
Dustin poirier rematch you win from pakistan
The last “reporter”’s question… do you follow the sport bro?
Classy mf.  I wanted Justin to win but also am a huge Dustin fan.  Awesome but sucks. Shows how awesome they both are I guess
Dustin is my BMF, love that guy
I love you dustin, warrior and true champion.
Lol the KO loss making Dustin a stammerer😂
Such a class act
Damn legendary fight with two legendary fighters
Respect to Dustin... Win or Lose, your fight is worth watching
McGregor has a new DM.
Damn horrible questions from “the press”
Pure class
Nate vs Conor and Dustin vs Jsutin are the Trilogies wee need....
Put that nasty ass hot sauce away
Respect Dustin, you’re the man
There are multiple clips where he was being a douche after wins. But whatever, I still like DP.
Satisfying to see Dustin get KO’d. I loved it. Dude needs to retire if he’s not willing to fight prospects #UFC
Do it agian!
rough fight to watch.. didn't want either to lose... but this should make for a great trilogy hopefully
That freaking annoying woman asking the same question to every fighter
You will never win a championship belt dustin. Youre a midiocre. You have given so many chances. But youre not meant to be a champion. Youre meant to be a challenger dustin.
Gutted to see poirier loses. 1-1 they should rematch again one day
What Dustin says doesn't make sense. He was looking as good as ever in the cage. He should not think of retirement. He is clearly concussed.
Dustin's the BEST.  A true diamond.
Insane to do a press conference after a ko like that! What is this dude made of. Respect for the diamond, real warrior  💯
He gon' cry in the car.
Justin has increased the accuracy to near the max
Poirier is class.  Warrior.
He’s crying again 😂😂
He hurt Justin and I said “being smart don’t over peruse yet!!!” Smh sike 😩
The guy asking about the pants do not know how to read the room
Classssy Classy Dustin. Never makes an excuse..nothing hurt during camp, no wine the night before the fight.
This is one of those fights I loved but hated cause I didn’t wanna see either of them lose. But I am so happy for Justin. That was PHENOMENAL.
Rubber match!
Isn’t Dustin memed for being a sore winner?
I guess Poirier can’t run from Dariush anymore
Bang! Headshot dead!
Dude was just unconscious and is speaking so fluently, Dustin is a legend and will always be one of my favorite fighters.
Respect to him for still showing up to the press conference
He’s two wins away from a shot since he’s such a draw. Idk why he acts like nothing else is gonna do it for him
Respect to this man 👏 great example.
When you think about it, that first mental and physical arse whoopin Dustin took from Conor set him on a path of greatness. The guy is a true warrior poet. He’s become probably my all time favorite fighter. He has become comfortable in his own skin. That’s hard to do my friends
Lucky kick robbed us of a war, Justin himself admitted it was luck. Even DC and Joe Rogan were disappointed, the trilogy has to happen.
Dustin plays the good guy really well... dont think hes as genuine as people think. And is it me or does that label of his hot sauce look abit like howler head logo.
Wtf is with that reporter asking why he was pulling up his short? He's literally done that for years and years
Really not sure what kind of fight Dustin will take next if he doesn’t wanna fight an up-and-comer. Hope he makes another run for the belt but after two failed attempts and now knocked out of contention, who knows. Hard to see him lose like that.
Love seeing Dustin get humbled
He imitate conor's style advertise
For a guy who just got KO’d, Dustin in all class. He doesn’t over think or dwell on what could have been done.
This dude still bringing sauce on stage. Lol
BOOM HEADSHOT
Stuff happens man, nothing to take away against Dustin. The kick was just picture perfect
Big respect to Dustin
Ouch
Both are champs in my mind. respect to both
Dustin got hit by the TJ Whittman special. There is a huge difference. Justin hit Dustin with a boxing range version, where you dip your body and go parallel with your leg. It requires this awkward body position because its such close range. if you look at leon he throwing a punch out of range and kicking from kicking range.
Get the Kleenex sponsor lined up
How he know about New Jack City 😂😂😂😂
This guy should just retire,, he won't take an upcoming fighter for like more than 6 to 7 years, he lost but still won't take on any contents bit will fight for the tital and bmf with justin if he wins lol,, just retire or kick some new fighter ass and fight for the belt.
Damn!!..i feel sorry for dustin ,hope he'l be fine ..great work by justin 'the mythical headkicker' gaethje
Dustin Sorier went to sleep
anyone know what Watch hes wearing? is there a place on the internet that someone talks about all UFC fighters and their watches?
As I said a year ago after Usman KOed, this is what eventually would happen to Khabib, in this game 1 kick can end you, so good on him that he left, can’t gamble for too long
Islam vs Charles II  Winner Fights Justin  Loser Fights Chandler     Porrier v Dariush  Gamrot v Fiziev  Winners and Losers of each fight each other
Who’s the dumbass reporter asking about him grabbing his shorts as if DP hasn’t done that his whole damn career😂
He’s pissed lmao.
Watched this live in the bar everybody was in shock 💀 Never ever expected Dustin to go out like that and neither did anyone else honestly 2nd round is fast as hell Justin swung that f***in crane of a kick and smashed with pure force on Poriers neck, Im suprised he didnt break part of it. Dustin even had high guard and he looped his foot around it dead on.
These nose surgeries are like a cheat code
You win like a sore loser though? After the Conor fight where he broke his leg you’re taunting him then trying to show respect when the mic comes. When Chandler lost you started talking smack to him as well. You talked smack to Max, talked crap to Eddie, been talking crap your whole career after the fights done. I’m a proud hater of Dustin idc what anyone says
Bruh 4:50 I almost cried too
His shorts pulling was so extreme in the first round, it’s like a coping mechanism, a reaction to a serious stress that he can’t control
Dustin you the man.. thanks for being who you are,  and setting the example you set
Would love to see Gathje to win a title man
Im a fan of both Dustin and Justin! Keep your head up High Dustin and well done to Justin!
Didn’t seem like a hard KO, more like a body shock from a kick to a neck.  It may even be better than taking these kicks for 5 rounds straight.  I doubt Dustin would wanna fight gaetje again tho, he felt these kicks again and would not wanna put himself there. Just win some Dariush( easy for you) and go to boxing. You are already hall of famer
This man holding back tears. He fights with high emotion.
this guy is fighting back tears and still be so articulate at the same time. respect man.
Dustin doesn’t win like a man. He’s always humble in defeat but the biggest sore winner
how is your sound so much better here than on the official UFC youtube. its always so damn quiet and shitty over there. i always have to come here just to hear the post fight goodies! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I wish there was a 165 lb division so that Dustin could move up
Love watching Dustin get slept
At this his age & got brutally koed..He never be the same..hope he retire before too late like Tony
Man I love this guy win or lose but I like Justin too hard not to like him man I love both guys
Was at the fight and it was amazing. The trilogy is just destiny. This has the chance as being the best trilogy in the history of the sport. Hate to see either lose but it’s the name of the game.
When dustin wins he shits on his opponents when he loses (besides this fight) he acts like a cry baby smh can’t respect that at all
Justin whooped your a&& I thought you were going to hang a belt haha I just hear a bunch of excuses
jolie going with mcgregor after tonights L
The hot sauce sucks don’t waste your money
solid dude.
His championship dream is for sure over now.
Jan was robbed change my mind
dustin is classy as hell. nun but respect
Class act like always by Dustin. Legend
I always remember Poirier great quote “when times are good be grateful, when times are bad be graceful” 🔥👏
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣the only real loser is that left ear. SMH.
good man
Who noticed that Dustin didn't retire...?! He's telling us something
Justin was so clean. Dustin was not.
Never thought I'd see him KOd like that at 155. Just so durable & tough. Glad if it were to happen it was by Gaethje.
Honestly felt he looked a small step behind all fight. Usually his defense is a bit sharper than it was tn. Justin was tagging him constantly & he wasn't checking those kicks again.
The eventual trilogy will be another great one.
So glad this fake nice guy lost ... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Justin & Dustin both embody what being a UFC fighter is all about. Both are must see everytime they fight. Not sure where DP goes from here but I hope we see him again
justin winning the belt and then dustin taking the belt in a trilogy would be amazing. love to see both fighters become champ at least once.
The last time Poirier was KO’d was back in 2015... This man has a hellva of chin but that just shows the power in Gaethje’s Arsenals
Those dumb hot sauces...
I’m his number 1 hater, tonight’s a good night
Sad
Headshot Bamm🔫
Huge respect to Dustin, man. Usually never see guys who lost like that do these interviews after (thought it was mandatory they go to hospital tbh.) All class.
Colby Covington talk shit on Dustin Poirier is coming
Someone really needs to sit Dustin down and get real with him about his outfit choices.
Damn.  Dustin's ears look like pieces of clay molded onto the sides of his head.
Always feel weird when they interview fighters after KO losses.   Obviously guys wanna express themselves all of that, but he’s slightly concussed, tired, and definitely sad/disappointed af. Glad to see Dustin at least on face value handling it well initially.
Wouldn’t mind a trilogy with Gaethje. They’re one a piece with finishes.
LEGEND LOVE THIS GUY.
Tony should hang the gloves man. Upto Chandler atleast he was losing to respectable fighters.......now he's just losing to scrubs. 😢
Props to Dustin for not being a sore loser.
Just a speed bump for Dustin.  We don't make excuses but he got caught with a lucky shot and stuff happens.  He'll take this and learn from it and be back better than ever.  The goal hasn't changed and that is lightweight gold.
What happened to Joe Rogan?
Props to him for doing after getting  KO’d
This dude just got KO’d he shouldn’t have to do media he should be in the hospital at least to be safe
Patient Gaethje is the mythical fighter we didn’t know we needed. Both fighters looked good, Gaethje just threw the perfect head kick. Congratulations
Thought for sure he was gonna retire hope he gives us a couple more wars then dips
Legend for doing this press! Dustin is class, he'll be back
first
