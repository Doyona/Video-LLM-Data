What is it with so many people messing with UFC fighters?😂 So many stories like this.
Lock your car dude lol
Black fatigue
Always black 😡😡
Come on, get outta here! We were not supposed leave our car unlocked and running? Unbelievable!
He wanted a fight for real tho lol
Jordan williams?? never heard of this guy what's he on the undercard?
I leave my car running a lot. Usually my dog Barrett is in there but idk. Probably still a bad idea.
And this is why justin is your favorite fighters favorite fighter. Well its 1 reason
What name fighter ??
Kamala unhappy.
Let off WAY too easy..
What punches
Its always the usual
Of course hes black
bro i was today years old when i learned you can click the subtitles in the video and drag them anywhere lmaoo
He saw those ears and just didn't want any part of what was gonna happen next.
sounds more like a lesson for people leaving their running vehicle's unattended, foolish
A mistake.
He said a bold lesson of pain 😂
Ufc fighter pounds car thief? LMAO 😂😂😂😂
Looks like he was kneeing him in the head.
Moral :always beware when there’s a black guy around
I respect a man with Cauliflower ears.
Who the fuck doesn’t lock their car. 😂
Those were knees not punches
That's called natural consequences.
Who tf is that guy? Ain't no ufc fighter😅
The way he ran away 😂😂😂😂
he should be glad that he didn't run into jon jones hahaha
That last part is common sense
Bruh, imagine if it was Sean Strickland's car he was stealing... Or Jon Jones after divorce court...
He threw knees not punches
Blks
Why would u ever leave ur car running with the keys in it?blows my mind how many people do that
Bullets faster than hands he ain’t god
Wow, lock your car and never leave it running! What a concept, huh?
Zero punches thrown
If you're to lazy too switch the car off you deserve to have it stolen.
I didn’t see him throw any punches in this video. He must be so good his punches are ultra instinct fast.
I expected a bigger beat down that this, my grandma can throw more punches with her purse than this.
impressive punching skills.. but super risky; thief could’ve been armed
I am disappointed. He did not get supplexed or twisted into a pretzel.
Gotta be stupid or rich to leave your car unlocked and running at a gas station
Lock your doors dude
Wtf are you doing leaving your car running and in a city, no less?
Almost certainly, his insurance company would repudiate liability if the thief had driven off with the car as he basically invited the guy to steal it! ( check your policy folks!)
ANOTHER outstanding young urbanite who would rather steal than get an actual job.
I realize the fighter is a knob for leaving his keys in an unlocked vehicle, but I like that he gave the thief a world class UFC beat-down on his larcenous a$$!
lol even the their was too stupid to lock the car doors
It's good to see people fighting back again. I love it.
blacks just blackin
Idiots who leave a car running in a public setting deserves to get it stolen.
Looks like he kneed him in the face twice, ouch.
fun fact: Do not engage with the guy who have ears like him.
Should’ve done a Rick Flair pile drive into the pavement.  That would end his criminal career.  Hard for a paraplegic to steal cars.
Punches... Those were knees brother.
Plot twist: The fighter was, in fact, the thief
He left it running?!?! People! Stop being so stupid.
Leaving your keys in a running car literally saves you 5 seconds per trip. Except for the time it gets stolen and you spend weeks trying to get the insurer to replace it.
Yeah man should’ve chased him down and pinned him down ready for the police... he’ll be doing that to an elderly lady or something now because you didn’t stop him!
you'd be too lazy to wipe your own a$$ if you leave your car running like that.
Hahaha guy running holding his eye hahahaha
UFC fighter lucky didn’t get shot
*USUAL SUSPECT*
Seems fake. Why is the mounted camera moving?
UFC guy might be tough be he's also incredibly dumb.  Do not leave your keys in the car!
Just a note for anyone thinking to do this, opening and putting yourself behind the door of a vehicle that is moving backward is SUPER dangerous. If the thief would have gassed it instead of braking, the story would be completely different.
Its still just a girl.
The perpetrator was black? I’m starting noticing a trend lately. 🤔
Hooray for the good guy!!! 👊👊👊
What color?
Lmao
Cue Bill Duke….  *_”See right there. You know you done f—ed up, don’t you? You know it, don’t you? You know you don’t f—ed up!”_*
Lesson: Lock your doors? How about creating a society where the punishments are actually discouraging enough to stop this from happening?
He’s very lucky the thief hit the brakes when he opened the door. Thank god the thief did stop and the UFC guy didn’t get run over.
Looks like a Honda Civic and the doors automatically  lock once you walk away from it if you have the fob with you.
Didn't look like any punches thrown from the cameras view?
All I can say is this guy picked the wrong car to steal. Dumb dumb dumb!!
No, you SHOULD HAVE done more damage.  This perp has likely tried this dozens of times since
Anyone else notice the price of gas here? And that was just two years ago.
Amazing resemblance to stars of other crime videos…
If fighting is not a profession, how can he be a professional fighter? It's amazing that a TV presenter or the writers do not know this. These people do not work in an internationally re ognised sport so they are not even elite sportsmen, unlkie swimming, running, and more
Recapture of chattels
I left my car running once,,,,,,and came back out and ...Gone  and I was on a military base....haha
He probably moved to Chicago where it's the norm.
Don't leave the car running!
That’s a f u moment ❤
In the UK the UFC guy would be sent to prison, the theif would be given compensation money. 😂
looks like he kneed him in the face a couple of times as well when he was pulling him out
Haha that's some gta shit
nah, a little damage will do wonders for his future endeavors...
Idiot... Dont leave your keys in it
If he was a boxer guy would have been laying unconscious. Since it’s sissy ufc he leaves with a slight headache.
Advice to criminals out there,take advantage of second amendment and use a gun .
WTF - the jerk let the criminal run away? Great, saved his car, and because he was stupid and hold the guy, the criminal is free to go out and maybe really hurt someone next time.
Beat up by a guy with a fanny pack
He gave the guy a few love taps and let him go ! He could have busted his chops !
I only leave the keys in my car if it's a hot day and the baby needs some air. The AC is broke so that's all we have. Sometimes it takes me a while to get done drinking in the bar, so that baby really needs that air.
Every pro fighter has such nasty ears how could you commit to that lifestyle and be inherently deformed
car thieves should hang.
Son went from coming up on a new car… to feeling like he got hit by one 😂 . This is the only way to deal with this
Stop living in shitty cities! My keys, money and wallet are in my car all the time. I leave it running at the store, once you start living in fear, it snowballs. Maybe one day someone will take my car, big fucking deal! So I’ll have a story to tell my grandkids. Stop being paranoid cowards
Everything always seems so old and in the past in America lol Why are people so violent in that country?
Jordan Williams would be stomped by my grandmother
Didn’t see any punches
That's the thing I don't get about some people. Why would you ever leave your car doors unlocked with the car running while you step away.
Un blanco a agredido a un negro porque le robaba el coche, rapido hay que saquear todos los comercios de asiaticos y quemar todos los vehiculos aparcados en zonas de mayoria blanca, los negros pueden hacer lo que quieran.
And now that loser is no longer in the ufc 😂
Disciplined and hard-working enough to become a pro UFC fighter - too damn lazy and careless to turn off the engine, lock the door, and put the key in his pocket.  That's people for ya ... !
Yay, let's hear it for the potato.
Somebody has got to change his underwear.
What's the use of showing these videos if they're blocked by the large, unnecessary captions?
Imagine if the dog ate her chick fil a she probably would have shot the dog
Suprising that some Democrat AG is not producing charges against the mma guy for using deadly weapons (his trained hands) against a harmless innocent car thief. Today's laws seem to be allow criminals to loot and pillage you and your family to reduce risk of injury to yourself.  Which is straight up crime promotion.  Straight up encourages criminals to get busy looting because no one is going to stop them. Democrats have destroyed the law and promoted violence against law Abiding citizens by ignoring criminal actions.
Who the Took is that guy????? Famous words of McGregor
Needed a gun!!   Thieving blacks
I modern America, you leave your keys in your unlocked and running car,  you are pretty much begging for someone to steal it. Dude was lucky he was quick enough otherwise another hard life lesson.
Think owner is severely punch drunk...yeah just leave your keys in car in US!!!!
that’s a honda civic,are you sure that’s a UFC fighter?
WTF, UFC fighter knees someone in the head and no KO?
$3.64 - FJB
Why TF do people leave their cars running, unlocked, with the keys in it?
Who is in the right mind to leave the car running with the key in it..
Of course its a N
15 second skippable ad for a 52sec video.  Up that ante YouTube.
Body shot and dude won’t be running away.
Both deserved what they got. I can't believe the people that leave their cars running while not in them.
How.... Impossible to be that thick..... Leave a car running, then go world wide, about a person taking advantage, for the only reason! Your parents have got to be related!
HORSES THAT WERE NOT SECURED WERE STOLEN.  THIEF,  WHEN CAUGHT, HANGED ON SPOT.  CAR JACKER  DONT DO IT.  YOU  WILL  REGRET  IT. 🚫
Wad dat a black boy again😂😂😂 Deys a people of no remorse 😂😂😂😂😂 but Deys a sure can dunk da ball😂😂😂😂
Good match practice.
Awe... he got away too fast 😢
But none of that happened?!?!?
Wouldn’t beat a bullet though
It's illegal to leave your car like that over here, common sense tells you that there's always a lowlife waiting to steal it.
dumb ways to die trying to steal a UFC fighter car
I’m just wondering why 95% crime cause by blacks!
Y’all got some skinny Carlton looking brother doing the news at CBS 17?  Lmao 🤣
It's a culture thing
Did he leave his car running when he went into that gas station? That's fucking stupid.
so it's a lesson learned when he picked the wrong car guy to steal from and not stealing in general ? talk about 13/60
Remember Kids, don't leave your KEYS in a car that you are not in!  😮  not much smarter than the thief....
I always leave my keys in the car. I live at 631 Howser Street, Astoria NY
Why did he let him escape unharmed???
Oh I was shocked at the colour of the criminal, well no I wasn’t it was one of those victims yet again
I see people go in a place with their car still on.  Just gonna take a second :p Like wtf man, no shit it’s gonna get stolen.
Maybe don't leave your car running in the fist place. Clown.👍🤡🇺🇸🇺🇸
The thief is lucky he didn't get the ol' ground and pound...
That’s was pretty stupid to leave your cars keys in the ignition and leave the car running.
Well if you leave it running you deserve what you get.
Plot twist: he wanted the thief to try to get his car cause he really wanted to whoop some but
UFC 1, POS 0……
Always watch your back. Keep your head on a swivel, always. Be militant.
He’s lucky he didn’t get ran over the thief could’ve just kept reversing and ran as a straight over permanently injuring him he would’ve never been fighting again. That was actually a stupid news. Very stupid. He may know how to fight because IQ is low.
Do all UFC FIGHTERS LEAVE THEIR keys in the ignition, not the brightest knuckles head are they, insurance would not pay out if you leave keys in car so ultimately he should have charged with assault as the keys are ownership in the USA! Legally
Dana White: “that’s fucking illegal”
If you leave it running you deserve to lose it
Haha the guy ran away rubbing his head 🤕🤕
Thanks for trying to apprehend him.  👍
I can't believe it looks like the thief put it in park as he was being yanked out and pounded on. How courteous! 🤣
If I’m not behind the wheel of my car, it ain’t running….ever.
Waiting for accusations of racism....
😂😂😂😂
Just never know for sure who you're dealing with
Guess he did not get the "door lock"package
Need more of that SELF DEFENSE  TRAINING. Streets are out of control
What can you do. they're always gonna do it
I don't steal cars but Everytime a black boy leaves his car running I want to take it.  Why is this only a black thing anyway? Too lazy to crank the car again?  DEAR BLACK PEOPLE. What's up with that?
Good
What a putssy the UFC dude is. All that training and you let the dude go to do it again. Total B#### move.
How the heck can you mistake knees for punches.
Lol he didn’t do shit to him…
So, he just let him run away..?
Do random people think ufc fighters are getting injured for fun or some shi, they are trained killers, any ufc fighter can beat up 3-5 guys at once if he really means to harm them, this ain't the wwe
I love watching this kind of stuff.   Watching robbers/gangsters getting their butt kicked by profesional fighters
GTA failed moment 😮
Never trust the cops, they only show up with body bags!
We're a violent species, there will always be war torture and rape because at heart that's just who we are
Guy Is pretty humble! He could have put him in the hospital
Poor job fighter,you could have and should have wore his sorry ass out.
Good!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
It's nice to see someone who is making it so that criminals pay a price.   If we become like CA where criminals are rewarded and don't take any risks for their bad behavior, it just makes the criminals more likely to keep doing it.
Love the graphics in this scene from GTA.
Thats what u get for being lazy and leave your car running
He really kicked his dick.
Get WRECKED!
Nope. No punches thrown. Stop lying anchorman.
Nice!
Thief will now target women and senior citizens.
So he let him go?
Good for him.
If only there was a way to apprehend the thief, because you know that piece of garbage will keep doing this.
Explain this to your insurance company... Way back a guy left his truck running at the gas station in North Phoenix. The thief made it all the way to the Phoenix airport, broke down the fence and was driving all over the tarmac. 😮😮🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Learn to lock your car doors. REALLY gee I would have never thought of that.
Is fake reverend al on the way?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Only in a black neighborhood. Can we get some reverse diversity please?
Just need to rid america of these people. Those who steal from others shouldn't be able to live
What's the world coming to?  Guy tries to back your car out for you, he gets 2 knees to the head...jeez, lol.
Amazing, there are still people who do not lock their cars...
Thieves are not very smart, where are the “Good Old Days” of working for what you want and respecting others property???
Lock your car, you big doofus.
Was it Hugh Edward’s that originally reported that?
good job but yeah thats what remotes are for doh
He leaves his car running in hopes that someone will try something.
Jordan Williams went easy on the thief. Imagine if that thief tried that on Jon Jones. Jon’s Malinois would most likely get a hold of the thief and then Jon would deal with him later.
Yup dem knees ….they hurt more than the hand cracks …street Justice.
Also how you can end up getting shot in the gut a couple times by a scrawny car thief
Doors unlocked and keys in the ignition...oh yeah 😅, he's been waiting for this day 🤣
You sir did everything right except one thing,you didn’t beat the living shit out of him.
Good thing the thief was just as bright as the victim, putting the car in park. How responsible. Was this planned?
I see people leaving car running frequently.   Amazing how stupid people are,  even knowing about increases in carjacking.
We need more people like this.  Refusing to be victimized.  Good on him and GOD bless him.
He stole KFC from a car?
Look at him holding his forehead and running 🤣🤣🤣
the dark color guy got his a$$ kicked
F living in an area like that
never even heard of him is he even a top 20 fighetr?
Dude let him off easy with those knees. Why leave your car door unlocked though?
I still don't understand how people don't lock their car doors when they get in. Or at least when they start driving. Just baffling.
is it not blatantly obvious you dont leave keys in car and you lock the doors 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ive seen ppl leave engine running often and I never understood the logic
Those Biden gas prices though…
*I always leave my car running, to keep the inside nice and cool, (I live in AZ where the heat can cook you alive if you're not careful) when I'm just running in for a quick anything, that is because if you get too far from my FOB the car shuts down. The car has no keys, only a FOB.*
he got away..
Left him running with a knot upside his head!😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video sucks
I think he wanted some action and practice or fishing that day.  Left car running, door open, standing in shadows and he got a bite. Reeled him in and POW. Left him holding his head. 🤣 Ok, new place and time tomorrow.
Left it unlock and running?! Wow. Not a smart guy at all.
:-)
Off-limits in the UFC: eye gouging, kicks to the head while opponent is down, elbows to the top of the head, head butting, groin shots  Off-limits in the gas station: ...
It appears that the car was left running and the thief attempted to steal it in the "Moment of Opportunity". Many comments blamed the driver for doing this. As I see it, even with the car running and the keys in it, NOBODY else had the right to even enter it, let alone try to drive it away. There's nothing wrong with living in a world where others rights and property are respected. Using the same logic as the thief "car's running and it's unlocked so it's now mine",  would it be okay for him to enter a house with the front door unlocked on a hot day and just a screen door unlocked as "security"? I guess that punks mama never taught him that if it's not yours simply leave it alone!
UFC fighter? 😂 pfft
A little reparations will surely clear that right up.
With gas prices at almost$ 5 bucks a gallon, who the hell leaves a car running?
Ufc fighter in a civ??
Lock your car, never leave it running-I learned that lesson over 20 yrs ago. Why do people continue to take chances? Gotta admit though, maybe if I was a UFC fighter, I might take that chance 😂 Seriously folks, don’t give people the opportunity…
Bait car LOL
Why not lock your doors😮
Do idiots not lock their cars?
UFC fighter deliberately leaves bait car open with keys inside, just to put hands on bad people between fights.
It was that moment…: He Knew He Fucked Up
He left his keys in the car? What an idiot!
You leave your car unlocked and running 🏃‍♂️ you basically giving it away 😊
Even if he had held the guy for cops, charges would most likely be dropped.
The fact he used his foot work to maneuver around the car is amazing.
Gas is cheap. Must not be from my state.
Thief? You mean another Black criminal. Who'd have guessed. No place gets better,
Next time the thief wont forget his gun
Leaving the car running...in PHILADELPHIA?  I question the UFC fighter's judgment!  Good job teaching this thug a lesson though.
and why can't a citizens arrest be made? by anyone?
Saw a guy break into a neighbor's car. Not only did the guy get arrested. I sent him first to the hospital.  The cops asked if I wanted to press charges of assault on the guy.
Sometimes it just isn’t a good day lol
It would have been nice to hear the driver getting the work put in on him.
I rely on Magnavolt for the ultimate in automobile security: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U4ZYOBzEEs
Do cars even have keys that need to be inserted anymore?
If you cannot take the punishment, do not steal a UFC fighters car!  Wish he stay and fought!😊
Did that reporter say shees? 😂
Punches?  That looked like a few good knees to the head to me.
Yep, that's pretty good advice...
Dumb move by the UFC fighter in the first place. Doh....
Ufc fighter like many professionals work really hard to obtain their things these low life criminals all need a hiding or two
Or the thief might just think twice before doing anything stupid like that again.
Left the car running? That was STUPID If I'm not mistaken, that level of irresponsibility may preclude calling it a theft, just like leaving one's front door open may preclude calling it a burglary.
Black guy too
Lock your car…duh!
So the main lesson here is make sure you lock the door after you get in so the owner can’t pull you back out. Makes stealing it a lot easier.
I love these stories.
He wasn't a car thief. He was just a jogger.
Did he leave the keys in it or something?
The driver is doing at his own expense exactly what you bureaucrats in badges get our tax dollars for.
Noticed something interesting. The thief was backing out, he must have put the car in park while he was being yanked out of it.
Watch out for deadly knee to the face attack, taking out thugs the world over, get your clean clocked
“Throws a couple good punches”  Casual
Surprise Demographic of thief...who woulda guessed?
He really got a bowl lesson in pain.  Yes sir, a bowl lesson.
Dude wearing a fanny pack.
Kick his ass Sea Bass!!
lock ur car and dont leave car running/keys in car, lesson learned
A UFC’s hands can be considered a deadly weapon and yet the News media seems to condone the use? Next the thief will say he is the victim and sue the UFC fighter for not using the proper pronoun and hurt feelings. Since most Media report things that tend to the left.
Easily the worst suit on TV. The jacket is the wrong colour. The trousers are old and shaped by a phone in the front pocket. The beard looks shit. The shirt is ill-fitting and collar looks weak. Other than that, you look perfect.
Love it 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
All brawn, no brains… leaving his car running like that.
2023 and still people’s leave car unlock running?!! Worse, it’s Denver where every winter multiple times from November to February they on radio and tv they tell you not to do that…. Freaking people.
Didn't pound shit false headline
I have never left my keys in a car I was not in. Every time I see these type of incidents  just shake my head in disbelief.
😂😂😂😂
Who leaves their car running with the door unlocked???
Leaves car running, unlocked… dude has taken a few too many knees to his own skull . 😕
"lock your car and never leave it running"  unless u own a stick shift  😂😂😂😂
"C'mon back, I'm just warming up!"
Dude was born to throw hands for a living, that thief just messed with the wrong person
Lol JDM beat him he was doing okay in that fight before he got caught that’s wild
This is just one of those stupid things stupid people do....park your car and let it idle with the door unlocked. Being a UFC fighter ain't got nothing to do with this BS news. Wise people always know there is no excuses for being stupid ! 😂😢😅
stealing a car from a man mountain has got to be the dumbest thing ever, a few playful taps from that big guy would leave you in pain for weeks
In California, the car owner would have probably gotten arrested for hurting the poor guy.
😂😅 excellent good job hope low life nasty guy has learnt well.
Why the hell did he let him go?! FAIL 👎👎
I can hear Jon Anik saying, "Ohhh, vicious knees to the face, he's hurting... he's hurt him"
New cars usually have a door lock mechanism when car is in gear ! Staged ?
This is what we have ALWAYS wanted to see from UFC fighters.
Why in the world would you leave your car unlocked running has he never watched the news
All brawn and no brains.
Why did you leave the car unlocked with the engine running? You're just asking for it.
He is one of Dana Whites fighters? He was probably in the store trying to buy half a gallon of gas with nickles.
Ну и норм самооборона, а у насби менти начали би его раскручивать на бабки, чтоби не сел после такого
Criminals will happily steal a car or bike VS walking. They believe you are asking for it, want it & deserve it. Our next door neighbor lost a car warming it up.
Honda civic is a smart choice of vehicle tho.
The only time it was ok to leave your vehicle running while away from it was in a small town where everyone knows everyone and back in the 70's. I live in a city. There's no way I'm leaving my vehicle or my house unlocked. Even if I'm in the vehicle or at home.
This is assault and battery. How do I know? I used my martial arts training to protect myself and the blue shirts told me, because I have training, if the other person wants to press charges. They'll have to arrest me. A UFC fighter knows more than I do and the other person should press charges.
Well he finally got a win. He's been getting his a$$ whipped the last few times
Dude saw cauliflower ear and Oopsed tf out of there
The professional, UFC fighter even the retired ones will fuck you up
Usual Perp. EVERY time
Talk about open up a  can of whoop ass.
Lesson 1
Dude should’ve known better, trying to steal his car lol 😂
Nice job! 😂
The thief got off really easy! People don’t seem to realize these men could kill you if they wanted to
Bro aint from the hood.
Always a male usual...doing crime Shit.. LOL and someone tell that stupid reporter...it was some high knees to his face...LOL 😂😂 when did the UFC fighter throw a punch??.. I'll wait..🤔🤣🤣
Well atleast the the theif didn't have a gun
usual suspect...BLM 😂😂😂
That’s why I love how Nissan let you leave the car running, and you can hit the button and lock it
Do NOT keep your  keys in the ignition when you aren't in the driver's seat.
My cup of coffee somehow tasted more delicious as I saw this video.
If the video was untitled I would have thought the other way around 🤣
Really disapointed he didnt remove a few teeth and broke a few bones. Scumbag needs to be taught a lesson he'll never forget.
Look the car doors will also help 👍🏻
Technical lock out 👊✊
Why do people leave their cars running ???  Dumb !!!  When gassing up don't leave the keys in the car. This is keep your car 101
My car auto locks the doors once I put it into drive and step on the gas.
What's the point of putting a video on when you can't see anything because of the bloody comments plastered all over the screen. 🙄
Why would the car stop moving though?  did the thief put it in park while he was getting pulled out?
2 wrongs don't make a right tho he should have call police I hope both parties received   A penalty.
Good for him but he was stupid for not locking his car door...that's the difference in training to be a fighter vs. learning real self-protection
"To lock your car and never leave it running" Well... in germany thats a law... so...
They would of let him go anyways.
If you leave your car on when going inside gas station you deserve to get it stolen.
Only regrets one thing?? Should regret being stupid to leave the keys in his car!
Probably those white supremacist who are known for car thefts
The way I used to run everytime ma mama smack me in the head😂
This would be a blessing in disguise for the petty thief..this should make him think seriously about his life choices.
fkn stupid to leave your car unattended with the engine running. just asking for it to get stolen. i'm not sure the insurance even pays out for theft in that scenario. in the UK it's even illegal to leave your car with its engine running if you're not inside it.
2025 MMA fighter get arrested for being white
😂😂😂 good. Stop stealing black man
Yes, big mistake in letting him leave.
UFC fighter probably got in trouble for not giving up his car
lets not forget that when engaging in an altercation adrenaline runs extremely high and we tend to feel pain only post-incident much later. The fact that the would-be-thief was holding his head immediately after shows the dude took some massive blows to the head.
As soon as you get in your car LOCK the doors.
Like GTA but in real life
Never heard of the guy
It reminded me of the movie Bruce Almighty, when Jim Carrey writes the teleprompter for Carrel, these guys read everything they put in front of their eyes. Swap knees for punches? Another fake news.
That's a low grade income ufc fighter otherwise he would not be driving Honda civic 😂
Nice….
Leaves car running....right
Same actors different movie
rear naked chocke please.
Too bad he didn't put the guy in a headlock and call the police.  The criminal deserves another conviction on his record. Surely he already has many.
This is not a racist statement. It is just a fact:  Blacks are 14% of the US population, but they commit a lot more than 14% of the crimes.
I didnt see any punches thrown.
Good for that thief lol. I don't understand though,why woukd you leave your car running with nobody inside? I woukd NEVER, EVER do that lol
I love this story - but - not all of us are MMA fighters. For those of use who are not, get a gun and use it.
Williams was arrested for assaulting a thief.
Yes, he should've restrained the thief, because that thief could've taken out a firearm. And the best solution is to have a remote engine kill switch, this way no matter what happens, car doesn't leave the area.
This guy is type 1 diabetic as well
Never heard of him before
He's lucky he didn't get shot.
LOCK YOUR VEHICLES. ALL TIMES. RAFI MAINE USA
I'm disappointed in the ufc fighter. Not much damage was done to the thief....I expect at least mount and pound.
The thief was hit hard with the truth.
He could have killed him
😂😂
Williams went easy on him. I wish a car thief tried that shit on Jon Jones. That would be the worst day in the thief's life😃
If you're dumb enough to leave your car unlocked, you'd better be fast and tough!
Knee to the face gets one's attention
Of course it was Denver. Highest car theft per capita in the country. Thanks politicians.
That knew was a haymaker😂
" One UFC fighter can throw hand inside, and more importantly OUTSIDE the octagon"
Bro the gas price tho 😭😭😭
Mans ran away holding his head😂
With the amount of cretins hanging around gas stations, 7-11's ....to leave your car running, unlocked is beyond comprehension in today's thief oriented society..!
He deserved to get his car stolen leaving it unlocked and running. That’s dumb.
What does this anchor think a pinch is? 😂
cool that as a fighter he stopped after a few punches. Not tryna kill the guy, just stop him from stealing.
...
No brains makes his own mess
What? Leave the keys in car like an idiot?
The driver left the car engine running?
Leave your car running & unlocked? Who raised this kid? If he was raised in the sticks, that's the only excuse I'd accept.
JUST IDIOTS LET CARS OPEN
WOW, it took someone stealing his RUNNING UNLOCKED car, to realize NOT to do that??? someone must have taken too many punches to the head... SMH
I always wanted to see an MMA fighter getting involved in such real life situation 🤩
He did nothing.....
He regrets not being able apprehend the guy? How about regretting leaving your car unlocked, unattended, with keys in the ignition?
Lesson for UFC fighters. *Stop getting hit in the head so often.* _You'll remember to lock your car up!_
When a Nobody tries to steal a Somebody's car. Loser.
Never fuck with a man unashamed to wear a fanny pack.
This shows you, if you rob someone prepare for the consequences especially if the person you rob is a professional MMA fighter...  LOL
$3.64 a gallon?  Wow!  I don't know what Americans are complainig about with Gas prices.  I'm in Vancouver and thats about$5 canadian.  We are paying $1.94 a Litre!  Thats like 9 or 10 bucks a gallon FFS!
Who the hell leaves their car running when they leave it for ANY reason??
More ass whooping needs to happen.  Lol
Well I was told it's always better to keep your car unlocked so they don't bust your windows
Lock the car, and never leave it running. I'll have to write that down, never thought of that!
"shit man you know the odds of this being a UFC fighters car?"
More like an amateur fighter I ain’t never heard of him
lol dont leave your car unlocked? the fuck
it was at this moment he knew
So you left your car unlocked with keys in ignition……
That dude was just jogging.
Better if a KO!
Big brawn small brain... Leaving car running with keys inside...
Can those hands deflect bullets...invest in afirearm
My only regret is that he went to easy on him!
I didn't see any punches but I did see two left knees to the head....yikes.
And he lets the guy run away? I would have beat him abit 😂
Idiot. The driver. Stop leaving cars running!
Amen brother 😊
OMG, did you see what that racist bigot did to that poor, disenfranchised minority?!
Bad thief, bad Idea !😄
*Round 1 FIGHT!*
When I put my car in reverse, the car automatically locks the doors.  So how did the driver open the door on the would be thief?
"he regrets one thing"    But it's not leaving his car running with doors unlocked and going into store. Idiot
that guy doesnt looks like justin xD
What the hell. do not leave your car with doors unlocked and keys in and running
lock the doors is good advise for the car thief too!
They say US is safe, never seen nothing like that in Russia.
Imagine, the thief just fells  when he running 😂
I love black folk. Y’all never disappoint 😂
I never knew not to leave car running and unlocked
Dude didn't lock his car???? Omg...
Make sure the guy you’re stealing from doesn’t have cauliflower ears.
A guy or girl with cauliflower ears comes up to you while you trying to rip them off just run you about to die lol
You remember gone in 60 seconds.. where dude sticks him up and gets beat up!   "Dude.. you need a role model"
Oh I do love it when these crooks get battered when they are caught lol
If your that ignorant to leave your car running while you shop around . Let me learn ya Son ? Hope you learned your lesson dude .
Ufc and ur driving a Honda Civic???
He beat the boys ass😂
We need to start a Go-Fund-Me  account for that  poor CAR THIEF  !!!!   And ARREST that GREEDY car owner  !!!!
A Walmart closer
maybe regret leaving keys in car and lock it...duh
Knee kicks=Good punches 😂😂😂
Funny how these cowardly Bastards run when somebody fights back!!..........or better yet, has a gun!!😊
Dont confront people trying to steal your car, not worth getting shot over.. Claim insurance. Unless, you have a gun.. then have fun
He should regret that yellow fanny pack.
The thiefs brains got rewired and became normal after this incident.
That look like my car without tints I can't tell cause there are different versions of my car!
He ran away like red from Friday after debo took his chain
He ran away like red from Friday after debo took his chain
Guess the car automatically goes into park or sets the emergency brake.
Brother ran off holding his head 😅😅😅😅😅
When keeping it real goes wrong 😂
Real shame he did not put this ass hole in hospital why oh why do we mix words ?
no car needs to be locked in my white town we leave them running and nobody takes them
Underwhelming clickbait
I've had my starter go out when I shut off my car and an issue with the fuel supply where it took 5 minutes before it finally turned over after I ran into a store so I tend to leave it running now if I'm in a relatively good area
What was the thief’s pronoun I wonder!
Thanks for the tip at the end lol whut
😂😂
sorry can i get that straight people need to learn, not to leave their cars unlocked and with the keys in running? Maybe they should start with other things like dont play in the fast lane or dont forget to breath.
Definitely the monkey didn't get enough of a beating. He shouldn't have been able to walk away, let alone run away, on his own two feet after what he did. He will do it again and then again because there were no broken bones here unfortunately.
Another white guy committing a crime  😂
Never leave car unattended with engine running & make sure it's locked. Today's cars are not easy to hotwire. They have ignition immobilizer which thieves cannot hotwire & start. They can carjack & take the car.
more logical plot twist: That was a bait set by the UFC fighter to beat up his a**  I mean who would otherwise keep the car running, door unlocked and leave your car at a gas station, Jeez!
I read it 'chief  tries...'  and then it is thief
A scum BLACK thief tries stealing UFC fighter's car, now it is correct.
There are so many people that do this. I personally wouldve beat the shit out of that guy.
This kind of shit's always entertaining, watching someone try to steal someone else's belongings , getting caught in the act and getting educated on the error of their ways 🤣🤣🤣
Me: *squints at the video to see the apparently thrown punches*
Leave your car running? 😖😖😖
He wouldn't have gotten in it if you hadn't left it unlocked and running you work for a car and just treated like trash
It applies to both, Next time lock your car as an owner and as a thief lock the car as well lmao.
usual suspects
I didn’t see any punches???
I’m not against the owner of the car but how stupid are u to leave your keys or car running in this day of age! Cmon now!
always dont leave your car running !
NO!!!! HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS CAR UNLOCKED AND KEEP IT RUNNING ALL THE DAMN TIME!!! ITS THE CRIMINALS THAT NEEDS TO LEARN THE LESSON DONT FUCKING STEAL!!!! WE NEED HIM TO TEACH THAT LESSON ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!!!
Leaving your car running and unlocked on Colfax in Denver is Dumb. Also this mma fighter is dumb.
Left the car running? What an idiot.
sheesh
I have the same honda civic. if he left his engine running and that thief actually got away, it would be his own fault. it's got a remote key fob that wouldn't let the car get so far away before shutting off automatically. so unless he left his keys in the car (which then it's his own fault) that thief wouldn't have gotten far.
Notice how the thief just casually walked to and got in the car like it was his own personal vehicle? He literally had no reservations about it. Just goes to show how entitled he is.
Moral of the story…you don’t have to be a bad@$$ if you aren’t a dumb@$$.
The blm/antifa supporter thief got way less than deserved...
In France when you leave the doors of your car open it calls for an anbandon of vehicle
So...........does he regret leaving the car running? Leaving the keys in the ignition?
Both of them stupid anyway
Throwing knees not punches
Dumb, dumb, dumb to leave the keys in the car.  I'd be too ashamed to admit to this, not proud.
Still not enough diversity in the criminal gene pool,
:32 brought too you by Jo bidin
We need more of him in the streets.
Also don’t leave the keys to your house in your front door, or write your bank card pin on your bank card, or put your wallet in a thief’s pocket or write a song about your social security number.
i think the owner is an idiot.
I'm going to get my mama.
A toad. Imagine that.
In South Africa this would be racism
Those werent punches those were knees to the head 😂
In America, cars with - Lockable Doors - is a $1,5000 optional extra ... !
Uh, take your keys with you dope.
the ufc guy is not a good fighter lol..robber will be kicking himself
Car running. Doors unlocked. He could've as well put up a banner - "Thieves are welcome."  Oh, San Francisco already did that! 😂
I guess they both paid a bit of Stupid Tax, who leaves their car w/ the keys in it and running(if you told the police that , they would think it's an insurance scam)
Solid knees!
Good for you Jordan!
If anything he got extremely lucky. People have been shot and killed for way less.
They both forgot to lock the door,
It 2023 and still we don't have fluid realtime surveillance cameras
People are being careless with their money, goods, etc... That is a big NO, never leave the car opened, running (!!!) while you are more then 4-6 feet from it!!!!
Well professional fighters aren’t the smartest. Leaving a car unlocked and on
I think the UFC fiter has pretty bad brain damage from flights coz he has done such a stupid thing like leaving a car unlocked and running, lol
Father’s matter
Stupid games, stupid prizes. 🏆 Edit: not a Gracie jiu jitsu takedown & wait for 🚔?
Well UFC fighters are not known for being the sharpest tool in the shed.
He left it running???? Jesus the stupidity.
So he left the car running!
CURB STOMP
Is that all???    Wtf.
LOL at the guy running away crying to his mummy.
Staged for publicity 👎
Always to be some nobody in the UFC that this happened to.
What Punches?
Fighters brutality needs to stop
Illegal knees. That got him banned from the ufc.
He had to leave the car unlocked because how else was he gonna get the keys he left in there. Maybe he's got CTE brain trauma from fighting.
Probably ran around the corner and stole the next guy's car. Good job.
why is it always a black person?
They get bail and repeat
I dont get why anyone would leave their car unlocked and running.
Sometimes people are so people... 😂
I'm a 911 operator and I can tell you right now that people will never learn that leaving your car running is a bad idea. Free cars every winter up my way.
Williams should have given that waste of space the gas station car park room temperature challenge
He should've learn jiujitsu.
Make the guillotine great again 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Karma ate his dogma
i lock the door to my bedroom, honestly.
Newer civics won't lock when you leave them running! Blame Honda
Good on the fighter for knocking some sense into that thief… but he was super lucky he even caught up with that guy. You gotta be an idiot to leave your car unlocked and running like that. You’re literally asking for someone to steal it 🤦🏻‍♂️
I didn’t see any punches
You have to be a certain kind of stupid to leave your car running and unlocked lol
The UFC fighter was not smart at all. First, he leaves his car unlocked and running, and then he did not hold the guy until police could arrest him.
Leave the keys in the car and windows down and a very large Doberman in the back seat she hates strangers
Wish there was ground and pound.
Ufc fighters are threat just like superheroes like superman who destroy building by saving people. . ✌
Dumb ass had the car running?
Those knees to the head, got him holding the knots from popping out.  That was epic
No one has ever heard of Jordan Williams
who says he's a ufc fighter? not sure i believe that
Badass
Lesson for any would be thief,  when  you see the driver get out wearing a fanny pack..... walk away with all your teeth intact!
I lock my doors at home...why would you not lock it at a shady looking gas station. The thief got it coming, but so did the fighter.
Sheeesh.
Who the Fook is that guy  -Conor Mcgregor
I'd pray to get put in the same tank
Why the caps
Easy way to avoid incidents like this: Shut off your engine and take the key with you.
Ufc fighter? Have not herd of or seen him
Why is it being recorded before it even happened? All for the social media 😆
People who leave their cars running deserve the Karma for being stupid.
I mean one of the first things in a driver school we learned that you never leave the key in your car. In 15 years of driving I've never once been more than like 5 meters away from my car with engine running. Even then I start feeling uncomfortable.
lucky the thief didn't have a knife or weapon. But this looks like something out of GTA game lol
The fact that the UFC fighter did all this while wearing a bright-yellow fanny pack just adds insult to injury.
Instant karma. Love it!
He’s gotta work on his grappling
And me nor my kids are car thievees
Sheesh what the fuck is sheesh Mr reporter
Some black people are thieves.   That's why they are not allowed to travel to europe.
pro fighter all over he kept very very cool thats why 99 percent of mma pro fighters survive in the ring they can keep cool and thats why that guy lived periode
Another way to tell that MMA fighters have more toughness than common sense
?!?! How could you let him get away 😂😂😂
Good for him, but where's the pounding?????
Who ever leaves a car running??
I'd regret that fanny pack 👲
Bruh, you see the dude coming at you as you back away, how the hell do you leave the door unlocked for him to yank you out like that😂
The guy holding his head as he ran away, LOL. Got some lumps on the ole gourd!
You left your car unlocked, with the keys in it?? Not very smart!!
Face to knee style! I thought such techniques were no longer practiced as so many people have bad knees and many peoples heads are very hard.
STAGED!!!! The thief also didnt locked the car!!! 🤪🤪🤪
I don't understand why people in america leave car unlocked or leave car keys on sunshade. Whereas in asia people locks the car and then double check by pulling the door handle to see if its locked
They both learned the same lesson.. that's irony for ya.. they both should've locked the doors to the same car. #lockurdoors
I thought his regret would be that fanny pack.
That stupid to leave your car unlock and engine on. 😡
Apprehending him would not make any difference. We all know the thief has been arrested and released over 20 times.
why would anyone just get out of there car and leave it running IF YOU DO THAT AND IT GETS ROBBED thats your fault you fool you shouldn't own a car
Gee, I watched again at 1/2 speed and still saw NO punches, but a couple of knees landed. Has the tape been altered, or are eye examinations in order for the report bringers?
Dude's rocking a fanny pack!
if you look closer you can see that the man stealing the car has dark skin
2nd biggest regret was the fanny pack
leave the key in the car no  lock the door ,,,,its too many steps to remember confusing the damage brain
Don't leave your car running with nodes inside. Idiot
He left the keys on contact and the door unlocked?
While wearing a fanny pack, lol. Dominance asserted.
those were knees sir.
Why would you leave it running and unlocked lol 😆
I'm not a thief but when I see a car unattended and running. Deep down I want to take it just to teach the owner a lesson.
He messed around, and he found out
Should have sent that guy to the hospital in a coma.
Nick Cannon  couldn't be reached for comment.
The usual  suspects  (50x a day).
He shudda BEAT HIS ASS
Man ran off holding his eye 😂
Comments are insane, in the UK I have never in my life seen a car running with no driver inside. It simply does not happen. US is populated by tools.
if you do good, avoid fame; if you do bad, avoid the executioner's axe zhuangzi
It shouldn't even be considered theft if the car is unlocked and running, the owner should be locked up for causing a dangerous situation
Idk why people leave their car running when they leave you are pretty much asking for it
Who in the world leaves their car running outside of a store
Is the character a would be car thief ..or just a wannabe?....it would have been great if our man had provided the dental technician with some additional revenue.
Dude opened that car door so fast
"Sheesh" bruhhh 💀💀💀😂
That dude got owned 🤣
Definitely early stoppage
You leave your car running you're inviting them to steal it more. Brawns but no brains
Keep your guard up when anyone from that “community” is near.  Happy Black history month.
No need to arrest him, that ass whooping was punishment enough, he will remember that shit for the rest of his life
I didn't expect to know this gas station though
He is right back out there keeping his usual cycle going..
Neighbors car got stolen like this
Way to go Jordan The “UFC Avenger” are beginning to assemble: Kevin Holland  Derrick Lewis Jordan Williams
Wha was that noise at the end lmao!
I'm sorry but if you're the type of person to leave your car running with the door unlocked. You deserve to have it stolen. That's just stupid and careless
It might be wrong but I do enjoy feel good stories like this.  I wish more morons would pick professional fighters if they insist on making poor choices.
All those blows to William’s head made him lose brain cells. Left car running, forgot to lock his car, and made himself public to the news lol. If the suspect was smart he’ll find out where he lives and  destroy his property. Like I said, lost brain cells.
I didn't see any punches. fake news
Rat
Never mess with a guy who has those ears
I thought he was going to say "the only thing i regretted was not kicking his ass longer".
He got kneed in the face
Maybe, it would be wise not to leave your keys in the car running with doors unlock.
The fighter had no right to harm the guy. Maybe he needed money for food? I hope this "fighter" was arrested
🤣look how he runs
i didn't see any pounding , where are those swings ? make him regret to even have a thought of stealing ever again
Denver?  Must have been last summer, and left running for the A/C
Usual color suspect ⚫
this is a cool trap, follow the thief home and then you now know where he lives
Floyd in trainin' yo!
Imagine getting knee'd in the face by a guy with a fanny pack on 😂 He will carry that for the rest of his life haha
Instant karma would of been better if thief would of locked the doors and drive away with fighter attached to his hood, 😆😆
Doesn't matter how good of fighter you are. You can still become a victim of your own idiocy. Never leave your car unlocked and running.
Good for his punk ass!😂
Man i would had his ass kiss the concrete
Joe Rogen: Oooh he hurt him bad
Id be arrested if I tried that
Y’all not goning to talk about the servers thunderstorm warning
“Sheesh”
Reporter lol. First off he was throwing knees second sheesh? 🤣
well that's what you get when you leave car open you idiot
UFC FIGHTERS NEVER WAS KNOWN FOR THEIR IQ. THIS IS THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR HAVING NO ABILITY TO THINK.
Lol
That thief got off easy.
Lesson for drivers: 500 Smith and wesson  Lesson for thieves:  I ain't messing with you...........
I know you're a tough guy but no common sense but I'm really glad you stopped that guy from taking your car maybe he'll think twice before he tries it again maybe next time Lock your door
The lesson learned by the robber to steal and lock it 😂😂😂
That guy left crying lol
Thieves should be killed on sight.
😁😁
Shame that beating couldn’t have lasted longer 😁
Siri UFC fighter wants everyone to know to be careful out there and to lock your car and don’t leave it running so is that what he did was left his car running and y’all said that Denver Colorado right why did he not get a ticket for leaving his car running unattended there is a law in Denver that says you cannot start your car and leave it unattended like go into a gas station just because it’s cold outside do you want to leave the heater going why does he not get a ticket from this or what because he stopped the guy from stealing his car this doesn’t make any sense especially what he said about locking your car and don’t leave the keys in it because it kinda look like he did that
So knees are punches now🤔and fist are knees🤔
Lock your car doors, don't leave your car running with the key in the ignition. You've just prevented 95% of all car thefts.
That's the best post fight interview I heard lol
This ones on you Jordan
Gene.   Anderson style.   Olie.    Anderson.  Ground pound!!!!
Bounty Cashed finally. RIP lil buddy.,
Lesson for car thieves: lock the doors *   And i was expecting him to really whoop that boy
A case of.....oops..... wrong place, wrong time and definitely wrong car.
Lock the car moron
Who leaves a car running with the doors unlocked if there are black people around?
b l a c k
They are both dumb for sure. The idiot car owner just got lucky that the battered fool thief was not armed. Classic morons!💩
Wow streaks a Honda civic?
That’s what he regrets.. I was thinking maybe the Fanny pack
FCK yeaaaaaah!
That's like a burglar breaking in to a home and realizing that a Pitbull lives there 😳
😂 he ran away almost cradling his face. This warmed my heart somehow.
LOL
Colfax and Monaco…?! C’mon Jordan 🤣
Is a car really worth the risk of getting shot at!?
Thief is REALLY LUCKY he didn't die
If your dumb enough to leave your car unlocked and running, you deserve to have your car stolen!
Gotta keep an eye on them charcoal boys
Threw a few GOOD punches for damage??? HE DIDNT THROW A SINGLE PUNCH LMAO
Never risk your life for a car much less a Honda civic smh.   Him running up to the car was stupid what if the guy had a gun.
Hope he got some sense knocked into him 😂
Hide yo keys! Hide yo car!
"What NOT to do when stealing a car?"  Thief in video:  Uh, stop to get an autograph . . .  from your favorite UFC fighter?
tf.. doesn't pound anything.
UFC fighter or not he was kinda lucky considering he could just aswell have slipped trying to get the guy out of the car & be run over by his own car & or the guy could have had a gun. Glad it turned out well in the end.
It's not wise to mess with someone with ears like that
If your one of those people that leave the car running when going into a servo you deserve to have your car stolen
Lesson for drivers. LOOK OUT FOR BLACK THUGS
This is the best version of GTA I've ever seen.
UFC fighter big on brawn, light on brains (left car running)
he belongs in jail, but you set him free.
POV: You attempt to steal Andrew Tates car
Made up incident executed by the UFC fighter for Publicity and Media recognition.
That MMA fighter should have put a beating on that guy!
Haha. Enjoy
What a stupid guy, leaving his car unlocked.
He’s all smiles but all it takes is a dude with a gun and it doesn’t matter if you’re a trained fighter or not.
Awesome
Dropped the ball
This is why I got into UFC, I can't wait for this to happen to me so I can legally...
ITS   THE   UFC   FIGHTERS   FAULT    FOR   LEAVING   HIS   CAR   ON    THE   THIEF   WAS     JUST   DOING   WHAT   HE   DOES   BEST:         STEAL
Doing a bang-up job Gov. Polis, at keeping your citizens safe. - Not
Racism racism the thief was unarmed and at a physical disadvantage
Psh. Even if they'd caught the guy he probably would have been released the next day. No real justice anymore. Well, unless you count the knee to that guy's head. lol.
He leaves his car unlocked and running for a reason.. don't fall for it!  HAHAHA
Maybe don’t leave your car running while inside a store, never understood why people do that…kinda just asking for it to be stolen.
Didn’t see any punches
Who leaves car running door open? Not to bright.
A Muay Thai instructor in San Francisco chased, on foot, a person driving a car who banged the instructor’s car and got shot by the guy who it turned out was on a crime spree.
I was hoping to see a beat down! Dammit!🇺🇦🇺🇸
Intelligent people already know to lock their doors and not leave it running!
He just basically got him out ..why didn't he jack this thief up and wait for the police?? He WILL do it again! doesn't mean MMA fighters are the smartest
Nice 👍🏾
Did he was called Big Smoke after that?
Them knees are like 5x more painful than a fist... some of the largest muscles are in the legs and in this case those large muscles were trained for maximum damage.
Didn't really pound him.just tickled.
Professional UFC Fighter Driving a 20k Car Says it all bought UFC pay lol
That was great!
stupid is......
Yep his ears check out, he’s ufc
Whether they caught him or not he'd be right back on the streets
if you do that in France the thief files a complaint you go to prison and the leftists call you facho....
Couldn't see anything but good on him, man!
Had to watch an add for a 51 second video YouTube sucks
Meanwhile in other news, fighting in UFC fights makes you forget things like turning off your car and locking it.
Wow news caster like " Geeze " Having an Orgasm the owner didn't do crap but yank him outta the car. I would've whooped ass on dude then called Police had him arrested ! Wow 😩
A great idea for a reality TV show: Bait car, but with MMA fighter's vehicles, while the fighters hide in the backseat...   Ratings gold, I tell ya!
امريكا بلد الارهاب والخراب والفساد وكل الشر
If he had the fob in his pocket while his car was running, the thief wouldn’t have been able to leave, as the Civic would have shut off as soon as the guy tried to press the shifter button.
The Acme of Stupidity! 😂🤣
They watching! Los Angeles is worst these things don’t get said in the news.
All I see is the thief pulled out of the car and getting away. If this is how an UFC fighter wins a fight in the ring... 🤣🤣🤣
we need to start robbing the robbers
My car stays on for my comfort. My keys come with but car stays on. Most ppl can’t drive stick anyways but car wouldn’t move without detecting key. If all that fails I got this FN 30 on me.
Not very smart to do behind a  door of a driving car!
I believe next time, when he see a car that he want to steal, he'll first of all find out what the driver does for a living before acting anything stupid.
Stop thinking that it’ll never happen to Me!
Throws a couple of good punches with his knee.
Fine for him, he's young. Old farts can't fight, hence the second ammendment. The exercise thereof is much more effective and beneficial for society. The shatty thing is that some dumbass demoncrat judge would throw you in jail. 94% of lawyers are demoncrats. Judges are demoncrats. Law is not a profession. It is a scam that manipulates society. Witness phake president JoseBidum DOJ, EFF BEE EYE, CEE EYE AYE. But I digress....again....
Lame video
That fighter should have held the thief in submission he yelled so loudly the police department wrote a citation for noise violation.
I am shocked to see that the robber was black. It almost never happens...
He left the keys inside ?!
Should have broken every bone in the (not "would be thief", but) thief's body!
Try locking your car doors
DOOOOO......More damage!! Please
If he left his car unlocked and running, it deserved to be stolen
I was hoping to see "punch punch" thief out cold.  *grumbles*
But gets let free cause he didn't technically steal anything....
The UFC fighter actually didn't do anything.
Seems like he did this on purpose daring someone to try it. Never heard of this guy in the ufc.
What a pathetic video. We didn't see anything.
Pro fighter BS
Totally fake. If it were real he would’ve captured the thief
Just because you're a UFC fighter no martial arts doesn't mean you're a badass
Oh look, another one of Obama's sons...
CBS fake news Trump Won the 2020
I've never seen anyone leaving their car on and open
That tbief got schooled by that educational beating and then went straight to denention.... or rather, jail!   What is the lesson here? Never steal!
what city does this guy live in that he feels safe enough to leave your car running while you browse for ding dongs on row 3.
never take the fanny pack as a sign of weakness HA HA!
My cousin left his car running at the gas station. He didnt know i was there. I took his car and parked in the parking lot on the other side of the gas station and watched for him to come out. When he did he went in the store and got the store to let him see the camera so he caught me but he said he will never leave is car running unintended again lol got him.
Thief b cursing his fate after watching this video. 🤦🏿‍♂️🤣
Looks like he was doing the nutbush :)
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍👍👍👌🤠
Moral of the story, if you are stealing a car make sure to lock the doors before driving away
This is dumb.   Lock your doors
He should have regretted not locking his door.
Obviously you left your keys in the ignition!
He had him stunned with those knees, wonder why he didn't just throw him down, not let him run away.
The bigger question here is "WHY" He left it running...???..did he want to get robbed???
This guys even got fists on his knees.
I thought his biggest regret was going to be the fanny pack for sure
If arrested - he would be out in an hour  JT
"a few good punches" 🤦🏾‍♂️ these people have degrees and completely clueless
The real story is the brain-dead fighter being dumb enough to leave it running while in the shop.  He kinda deserved it.
Black live matters
I'm glad he found the right car to steal😁
What the thief need a car for he can’t easily sell it except for spare parts though.
Leaves car running .. umm I can see why I’ve never heard of this guy.  He ain’t even registered to fight to busy running his mouth about being a fighter
Theft should learn to lock the car too.   Save him an embarrassing butt kicking.
This is why people
Never leave your car running at a convenience store in the hood with thugs around
You see that dudes ear? Yea.
too bad he didn't break the idiot in half !!!
Something is missing here. Did this fighter leave his car unlocked with car keys in the ignition? In that case lots of muscles but no brain. 🤯
Lock 🔒 everything these days. Even buy a lock for the lock …. 😢
Hay ABC cbs NBC how about the theft of American  money by the politicians.  That would make a real story for ya.
Stupid move.  He could have easily got ran over.
Sheeeesh
And he let him go??? Fake news
Fake
if you leave your car running with the doors unlocked you deserve to have your car stolen
who the f leaves their keys in the car.. or it still running?
You all need to hav a good look at yourselfs,lunatic asylum
Everybody in America is a violent maniac
Pretty dumb to leave the car accessible.
Hate crime, that black guy should file a law suit
You know you're a failed criminal when you get your ass kicked by a man in a fanny pack.
UFC fighter equals lethal weapon basically
Breaking News: Idiot leaves car running and is surprised someone tried stealing it.  How are people this stupid? Stay in school, folks.
Who the FUCK leaves their car running in 2022? Seriously deserves to get his car stolen.
Watch out for blacks near your car.
Lol leave unlocked car with key in it. If i was stealing it, he wouldn't have a chance to catch me :P
Luckily for him,  the criminal did not have a gun.
Something about this is fishy.  First, the way the thief nonchalantly gets in the car and doesn't immediately speed away (he gets in and Jordan is no where around).  Then, the surveillance camera is panning around and zooming.  Surveillance cameras are normally static.  Then, the thief doesn't lock the car and somehow puts it in park (as if it was planned so they didn't want the car to roll into a pump).
love it.
I always leave my car running as it is push-to-start for quick get-aways. However, I always lock it and only unlock it when I'm at the vehicle's door.
I thought newer model cars will automatically stop its engine after a few yards if the key is not near its range....I tried this with my Accord and the engine does stopped running.
The newscaster is definitely down with the ufc fighter. Right on, that is what I call good news.
Loves watching justice being done.
left the car running? there is no cure for dumb
Justice served
Car parked with the engine running and doors unlocked while you go inside a store? Sorry pal, you deserved to get jacked if you are that careless. If that carjacker ended up in a crash and killing someone, guess who the lawyers would be coming after?
I'm sorry but only a fkn idiot would leaves his keys in the car.  "I'm just gonna leave my keys in this piece of machinery that cost tens of thousands of dollars. Why would anyone want to easily steal a vehicle?" I hope they both learned a valuable lesson that day
Outstanding
Yes
The UFC fighter will be arrested and the city council will have a statue built to honor the car thief!
should have made his black life matter.
Why would you let him run away?
That's hardly a pounding.
Those were knees, my guy.. not punches.
And he just let him go 🤦🏼‍♂️ If you pulled him out, you might as well throw a good punch which would’ve immobilized him for few seconds giving plenty of time to subdue him to the ground and call cops so the thief doesn’t go robbing other poor non-fighters/citizens of our beautiful country USA 🇺🇸
all this bs staged crime hoaxes fake rich people do to fool the public cus crime is out of control and the crooks are stealing from the real fake rich crooks fake renta cops alll bs psyop.good cop bad cop sht.
Lock your doors. How about that lesson?
Liberal controlled state! What do you expect! Chaos!
Never leave it running? Tell that to the police.lol
Imagine if there was a Pitbull in the backseat? Nice doggie!!!
Them UFC paychecks ain't shit...
How sad UFC fighter makes very little that he no choice but to drive a Honda when an amateur boxer makes way more money and drives luxury cars
Left it running? CTE?
Another BLM
What is this fool doing leaving the keys in the car ?  This is setting up some one else for failure ,. And you want to be the Hero .  Right !
Sheeeesh
Why did you knee me? Im a victim..  police!!!!!
This is how you end up dead. 9 times out of 10 the thief has a gun
When he tried to steal a car, but instead had to deal with a train
"a would--be-thief" classic mainstream bs
Planned.
If you leave it running or the keys in it and it gets nicked then more fool you
This fighter took a few two many blows to the head himself. Leaving his car running and unlocked at a gas station. Like Biden would say “Come on man”!
Typical
Love it
The usual suspects
heard he was later sentenced to death for not allowing the perp to at least have even footing. Its fair I guess.
How dare he strike a black man and prevent him from stealing the car!? Black Thieves Lives Matter!
Yeah seriously. Come on guys. Why you let them get away?
Pounds? 🙄
👍
UFC punches affect UFC fighters and make them do dumb things like leaving your car on with the keys on the switch.
Not very smart ! He should have held on to the thief until police show up.
UFC fighters can get their cap peeled too! We live in a dangerous world.
It was gonna be so interesting if he fought back, this so called UFC fighter looks likes he would have ran away
L.A. IS zombie land . People are everywhere out here that have been awake for 3 days, from doing Meth. And they are sound asleep while awake.., commiting crimes in their sleep . It's true !
Break his spine
UFC fighters are the smartest people in the world why wouldn’t you lock your car
Thick as shit,unlocked,running car. Duh.
Surprised he didn't get charged with assaulting the poor criminal.
Who leaves a car running with doors unlocked? This is how you get car theft for easy pickings
Now I need a yellow fanny pack.
Bro - u just pushed him.  Whoop his ass some more so he learns a real lesson.  That was lame!
Why the fuck would you ever leave your car with the keys inside? Bruh..
Those punches were so fast, didn’t even see them.
It amazes me how many comments scold the driver for leaving his keys in his car.  I agree it’s not be the best self-preservation tactic, but let’s have the decency to blame _thieves_ for thefts, shall we?
A thief without a gun in America, lucky UFC fighter. He won his life, which was his anyway
I still want my free crack pipe, Mr Biden...
Realistically what kind of idiot leaves their car out side a shop running
stop calling thieves "would be" idiots
🤡🌍
I remember his debut.  What happened to him? Did he get caught using Peds?
that news reporter's a ding.
The difference between joyriding and grand theft is the keys .
Typical block people
All the UFC skills in the world wouldn't help if the guy had a gun. He's lucky..
Knee on the face to the protected specimen.
When the newsman said "he only regrets one thing", I thought he was going to say "my only regret was wearing a fanny pack"
We can talk about how stupid the thief was for trying to steal the car, but the better topic is how stupid the owner was for leaving his car running/unlocked in the parking lot. WTF haha.
It was at this moment he knew he f’d up
What an idiot, the thief didn't lock the car as he drove off.
Look at those cauliflower ears - he's beat down some shit in his day!!!!!!
Well this was clickbait trash
Who doesnt lock their cars once parked?
he is lucky that thief didnt have a gun .....never try to stop a crime in action so stupid .a gamble that could cost you your life
he didn't do anything a 90 pound grandma wouldn't have done. . . why is he letting the man get away? he's USELESS
Well if he didn't lock his car and left it running, play stupid games win stupid prizes. Still doesn't not excuse the thieves actions.
Bro this me failing on GTA try to jack cars....
My luck the thief would've had a gun and shot me
Thing is if that thief had a gun could have got killed him  heroes are mostly in the cemetery I applaud his bravery but if he would have locked his doors he would've avoided all his troubles
Well, he’d be better off killing the guy, of course.  We really should start giving no room for misbehaviour and killing off anybody who harms or tries to take people’s properties.
Takes a real man to rock the yellow fanny pack.
All well and good until the theif pulls out a gun and blows your head off
😂
The next victim might be a elderly or girl and it might not end well because u let him go while u could definitely apprehend him 😐 not cool
How can I be the only one who finds this Sheeesh at 00:45 weird af  I mean, it's the news....
Lock your car and never leave it running 😂😂😂
The thief got off waaayyy to lightly...he should have gotten grounded and pounded. FFS, there’s ALWAYS some c*nt that has to steal, break or spray paint something that’s not theirs and it’s about time they start learning some lessons.
Who the fuck is Jordan Willams 😂 never heard of him he must be a prelim fighter
His punches came from the knee
“Lock your car and don’t leave it running” (no shit🙄), clearly he’s taken a few to the head 🤪😂
With Dana White signing your paychecks you gotta risk your life for your POS car
I wonder why someone who risks his life for our entertainment fighting for THE premiere organization is driving such a modest car.
Not the biggest mistake it seems lol
he didnt hit him nearly enough times
that thief will now move smarter in his career
Don’t leave your car unlocked with the engine running? Never thought of that before! Duh!
Now that’s a punk pounding well deserved!
I'll never understand why/how Americans think they can leave their doors unlocked. Also leaving it running with keys in ignition is just madness. Come try that in South Africa
Duh! car unlocked and running! GTA 101 . . . 😂😂😂😂😂
You didn't fuck him up I doubt you will ever win a fight. Maybe try knitting.
Definitely a UFC fighter, driving a Honda civic, uncle Dana paying them well 🤣
Why on earth would you ever leave your car unlocked & to top that, leave it running.. I mean kinda sense is that 🥴
“Here, let me help you out of my car”, pulls him out, “on you go and steal someone else’s car”. Like I’m expecting a headlock or choke at least, then the police and this scum taken off the street? But nope. How many other ordinary citizens do this in America daily.. not worth the news time
Vote Republican and you wouldn't have to worry so much about Car Jackers because they'd ALREADY be in Prison.
Isn't it a coincidence that everyone on telly is either black or hispanic.
Gyms, martial.arts studios, boxing schools,  suddenly full after this vid.
door lock was invented before the year 2020... but owner and theif doesnt use door lock in 2021
Moral of the story: Don't f*** with guys wearing fanny packs.
Damn yo that scummie got his but kiked😂
Why does the camera technology always go back 2 decades on cool survalence cams 🤣
The foot placement is impeccable
He left it unlocked?? 8/10 for stupidity.  He left it RUNNING??? That's a big 10/10 for stupidity right there...!!! his only saving grace was that the car thief's actions were even less bright than his own...!!!
This driver left his car running while he went in the store? In the US? 😂
See an empty car with keys and running Me: maybe it's a trap....
a) if the car owner had locked his car BEFORE he went into the store, this wouldn't have happened.  b) if the thief had locked the doors AFTER stealing the car, he would have got away.  c)  if you're so good in the octagon why didn't you hang onto the guy?  grabbing is allowed in UFC.  This is just fail, fail and some more fail.
He threw 0 punches actually just some solid knees to the face! Love it
WHO LEAVES THEIR CAR RUNNING WHEN THEY'RE IN THE STORE??? This UFC fighter got a few too many to his own head evidently!
The thief looked a lot like Rhoda Rousey
Black man
If the car owner had been a few seconds later his car would have been long gone. He got very lucky and I'm glad he's realised how stupid he was for leaving it unlocked and running. I hope the thief also realises  how lucky he was not to get pounded into the asphalt and he reconsiders his life path. I doubt it though.
He’s not a “UFC fighter” he might train or do some stuff but not UFC
I always lock my doors even if I’m just going to be away for a minute. These days you just can’t trust a neighbor
😂😭😭 Got em!
I'm 11 months late here BUT,, the guy ran away. A REAL fighter would have knocked his ass cold.
What he should really regret is the yellow fanny-pack
he whooped him so bad the guy ran off holding his face crying.
In CA, If a cop gave that car thief swift justice like that, he’d be charged with assault.
I know that when I was living in Austin Tx in the late 80s, and I don't know if it was state wide or just the city but, if your car was stolen because you left the keys in it, running or not,...the cops would literally tell you to kick rocks. I'm sure that has changed because someone's feelings got hurt but I would support that anywhere. If you refuse to be responsible for the security of your own possessions then you don't deserve any help in retrieving them.
Should have locked him up an called the cops. Would have bee perfect.
So is that a Honey trap?
Bait car
Left it running 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️ Take the keys.
Never underestimate the power of the fanny pack.
When stealing a car always hit that lock button.
Left the car running with the doors unlocked? That’s unheard of
Lesson for all people! Never leave your car running! Ever!
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Never leave the car running?  How are you supposed to drive it down the road?  Fred Flintstone style (use your feet?).
He should have knocked him out and then drove over him as if smoothing icing on a cake.
No mention of how much of a meathead and moron you have to be to try this on a person that you have no idea whether they are armed.  IDC who you are if that man had a gun the UFC fighter be dead and his poor family would have to bury him, but for a story the media and thus the population glorified this dope
I’ve never seen him in the UFC
if you leave your car door unlocked and running….you arrogance almost deserves having your car stolen
It was racist to stop him.  He was just taking that car to go buy food for his family.  The other guy could have just gotten another car.  This is insane!
Don't be lazy and stupid. Lock your car.
I would have like to see more but dude could have got charged since they treat professional fighters hands as potentially deadly weapons. Dude still probably got rocked though lmao
pay back is a bitch keep safe people 🙏 ✌ 🕊
Lol
If only the thief just locked the door lmao
Why would you leave your car running?
Thieves should be killed.
He taught the crook a good lesson.
I hate when people say “well you shouldn’t have left your doors unlocked “. What happens when you wake up at home and someone Hotwired your car? We’re gonna hear..”well you shouldn’t have left your car in your driveway. Thieves need to stop stealing!!!
Good. Serves him right
if it smells like fish............... who the fuck leaves their car unlocked with the engine running ffs ??
This is how Karate and K1 fighter Andy Hug died, chased down someone who stole his car, but when he opened the door he got shot
And that’s that this guy is the lowest of the lowest tier on the ufc roster …had it been someone decent that guy would’ve been carried on a stretcher
If that guy left it running and left it unlocked then the guy was just borrowing the car.
can you bait would be thieves like that and blow them away with a dirty harry when they try to drive off?
Who in the hell just leaves their car unlocked and running??!!!!
👍❤️🇿🇦🥊
Here in greece a thief was caught by the owner of the house he had just robbed and when he realised who he was he didn't even attempt to run away. The owner was Michael zambidis the former k1 kickboxing champion! Karma is sometimes rewarding
Well what is it? Lock the door or unlock the car door??  Because Yellow Cab Taxi is only one with the slip tool or slitting--up tool for opening things.
0:34 No, go ahead, do more damage. 🤜🏻
Fanny pack, The Rock approves
Sheeeeeeesh
bwahahahaha 'a bold lesson in pain' waaahahaha not 1 single punch! murican click bait at its finest hahaha (well done that guy that dragged the perp out though!)
In the UK I have no doubt the driver would have bee arrested for assault and the thief awarded compensation .
Sheereeeeeesh
Never leave your car running in the parking lot, its how most cars are stolen. In my state there is a law where they will fine you for letting your car running in the parking lot, because they're sick of having to find it or case someone down because you left your car open to being stolen.
I came back, because I needed a laugh 😂
Ganked him outta his car lol
*"Big body and little brain", I don't like cliches but what can I do ... ?*
Amateur thief 🤣😂
so the owner learnt not to leave the car unlocked and running??  Not very bright is he?
Dam he was on him fast🤣🤣🤣  Pulled him out the car like grand theft auto  Mofo ran and everything🤣🤣
"and never leave it running".  That's not and advise.  That's common sense.
Ppl acting like it's the 70s in this damn nation, ignorant to the dangers of this nation.. My mom n all others that ask to borrow my car gets a swift, HELL NO!! For this exact reason.. Ppl think it'll never happen to them, n when it's not their car getting stolen under their wing all they say is, "oh well, get over it, it's JuSt A cAr".. Fuck that..
Wow, that is unbelievable...did you see those gas prices!?
Been there, done that, got the T-Shirt (Victim of GTA, not being the thief). The only way these scumbags are gonna learn is if you catch them in the act and make their whole life flash before their very eyes.     I would say knock them out cold and make 6 feet of dirt their new home, but the prison time ain't worth it. lol
You see some dude walk out the store with ears that look like an ink blot picture, you know you effed up hahahha
Good old media, never letting the facts get in the way of a good story.  Knees, punches, what’s the difference.
this scumbag thief should have tasted more than a couple of good punches, at least enough to teach him one of the greatest lessons in life: you just don't steal.
🤦🏼‍♂️
That's a problem in Australia ppl leave their keys in their cars.
I'm glad the theif did not have a gun and was not a gangbanger. If he had a gun he would have shot and killed the car owner either after leaving the car or while being pulled out.
The level of denial about the world a person has to have in order to leave their car open and running is beyond belief.  I would have been happier if he had had his car stolen AND been run over in the process #AdditionBySubtraction
No punches were thrown, but the thief took the knee…literally.
Put your gun in your pocket  turn your car off take your keys and lock the car with windows up.
nice to see a good guy get the W.
Why is his car on?
Dude took some knees to the face.
LOCK IT OR LOSE IT. MUPPET
I don’t see ANY punches. Just a him pulling the guy out of the car and shoving him away.
Another pesky whoooite supremacist foiled!! 👍🏼
totally crush knees, elbows, and ankles with a metal bat... Then all the front teeth !!!
Didn't see a single punch.  Is this the standard of US TV journalism?
How dumb must you be to leave your car running ? I guess as dumb as as a UFC fighter !
didn't see any punches -  looks like he just grabbed him out of the car and sent him on his way.   I don't believe the thief has learned anything by that.
Punches. Bad reporting. I see a few knees.
UPDATE: thief is now on the Portland, Oregon city council.
Wow he sucks
Looks like a promising career change to law enforcement
Never mess with a guy wearing a fanny pack…
I didn't see any punches.
Boring click bait. I expected to see the mma fighter beat the crap out of the thief. Nothing to see here.
What a knob end that's what he gets for leaving his car unlocked and he keys still in its his own stupid fault that's what happens when you take things for granted.
He said sheesh, but we all know what he really wanted to say.
With the way things are and how criminals are protected I am surprised he didn’t get charged with assault with a deadly weapon.
Well if he had a brain he wouldnt have left his keys in the car..young thieves just wait for that..
It wouldn't have mattered if he'd apprehended the thief, the way the "justice" system works the thief would be back on the street in a matter of hours just as quickly be back breaking the law.
fake af. this was a publicity stunt. If you saw some asshat trying to yoink your car like that, and you are an MMA fighter ? That guy isn't going to just run off without injuries are you kidding me ? What a lame ass stunt....
looking up the definition of moron I found a picture of the thief.
Two brainiacs.
I bet the car thief is going to go to police and file charges. Then BLM is going to get involved and say the car thief deserves the car .
i’m 2020 the victim gets arrested
Reparashunz’n shieeeet
Police, how dare you hit this unarmed man
This is the reason that most women don't like short men AKA midget. Midgets cannot protect us. We like tall and strong men who could be our saviours! 😁 Once this shorty guy had a crush on me and I couldn't tell him the real reason because it would make working with him challenging.
Anyone notice the 3.64 gas 😂
Lock your car and never leave it running! Very important to remember.
Bait car, anyone? The bad guy could sue the good guy for entrapment. Who the hell leaves their car unlocked and running unless you want someone to steal it. I wonder if he leaves his house unlocked as well.
Never F with a dude wearing a fanny pack
He saw the Fanny pack and thought it was a safe bet this guy was a sucker 😂🤣
should have chased him down !! And then held him for the police.
he should have say regreting not locking the car. lol
Too bad… I wanted to see a full ground and pound!
Never leave your car running no matter how small a town/city you’re in
I know it's against the law because you are a professional fighter, but in my opinion, you should have beaten the thief TO DEATH for his presence on Earth. Death for thieves. No exceptions. The planet is overpopulated. Dump the trash.
Didn't see any punches🤷‍♂️
why did he leave the keys in the car.   bad idea.
Who is dumb enough to leave car running anyway?
Try locking your car dude.
Don’t underestimate a UFC fighter with a fanny-pack.
Not another black person stealing something.
Fortunately, I've never taken a knee to the head, but I imagine it's one of the few things that's even more painful than taking a knee to the nuts.  Or, as that Welven guy said, "DEEZ NUTZ!" 😆
Im glad he got his car back   but why did he leave his keys there ?
Lock the car and dont leave it running.... yeah no $hit 🤦‍♂️
To this day ppl still leave their car on running while inside gas station smh. 2022 they still do it.
I literally saw no punches.
He is coming back for his Soul 😂 for not finishing the job right
I thought his one regret was getting caught on TV wearing a yellow fanny pack, but who's gonna pick on him?
Destroy criminals by whatever means 🤠without law enforcement this is what has to be done.
Good attitude on the car owners part. As for the scum that attempted the theft I hope gets his due with no mercy.
Plot twist! UFC fighter wanting to make a smash in the media sets up attempted car jacking to get name out there……
Na man.. do more damage. They’ll never learn unless they’re damaged.
Mikes lying to you
Is it me, or does it seem everyone who apprehends a suspect today is a UFC fighter?
The only lesson learned here, is the fighter will learn not to leave his car unlocked with the keys inside and go into a store. The thief will continue his chosen profession.
He's lucky that guy put on the brakes instead of the gas
Was he wearing a fanny pack? Every fighter should wear a fanny pack. Because nobody expects to get beat up by a dude wearing one. And the embarrassed it's way worse.
The way he ran away holding his held like MOMMY HENHIT ME
With all his training he couldn't hold him for the police?
Something I heard once “Did you ever think that the keys were in the car because no one would be dumb enough to take it?”
Dude could have gotten shot. He didn't control the perp well. Won't be seeing a belt around his waist
The car owner was white, the thief was black, where are the BLM idiots calling the car owner a racist?
To quote Mike Tyson " everyone has a plan until they get hit in the face "
Don't mess with guys who wear fanny packs there's a reason their confidence is so bold!
Come on man, that dude was clearly the gas station valet... jeezz
That's some funny stuff right there
FIGHT BACK AGAINST CRIMINALS!  They are depending on your fear 🤛
don't leave car running dud...dude
unlocked car and with keys running.....stupid.   that is plain stupid
If leaving your car running still work , set up a sting ...Lock em up 1 by 1
UFC fighter has taken one too many blows to the head in his day also. Lock the doors and take the keys. Even a computer nerd knows that!
Man ran away with his tail between his legs…
Sorry thief, that only works in Grand Theft Auto
Too many poundings in the head must of forgot to lock his doors and take his keys out.
I didn't see no punch
The ufc fighter got very lucky with this particular moment in poeple are fucking crazy, not saying most wouldnt do the same but guns put down just as fast. You really never know, happens to anyone anytime these days.
he couldn't have  been a very good UFC the guy ran off so those so-called punches were didn't do anything lol
Fake
No wonders why people see a black guy and stay alerts.
These civics will lock pretty much immediately after walking away, under factory settings. Leaving one unlocked and running is just asking for trouble.
You see cauliflower ear , you don't steal m you run
Hmm... That wasn't exactly a fast getaway, was it? I smell a rat...
He is lucky I would stabbed the theif to death
How did you let him get away though?
He was so lucky he didn't had brain 🧠 in his head or he would have been unconscious by the knee attack
Guessing we’re gonna let that Fanny Pack slide.....
Doesn't take practical brains to be a fighter. 👀🤔. Learned lesson? He's an adult. That lesson should have been learned over a decade ago.
Every thief deserves a few slaps upside the head. Well done
If this was the uk the pc brigade would of made sure our main man was arrested for assaulting the robbing bastard.
He kneed him l o lololol 😂
Aaaand the thief learned to lock the car immediately.
another aspiring rapper bites the dust
Good
A moron ufc fighter. Who would leave the engine on and unlocked door?
Idiots always learn the hard way not to do something after they did it. Stupid.
This is the exact reason citizens need to carry handcuffs.
If I ever stole a car, this would be my luck
And now he can sue the fighter
So the "fighter" left the keys in his car?
Why these black people are always inclined to illegal works?
The reporter is still sleeping i guess. Needs a coffee ☕
STAGED... 🧐
Wow lock and the car and DONT leave it running you say? You know lucky this was clarified I've been going around my whole life leaving my car running and leaving it unlocked.....
Fight crimminals dont let them ruin your life
Why is the USA so full of crime?
Look at those gas prices - $3.64
REAL UFC FIGHTERS WOULD HAVE NOT LET HIM GET AWAY,EVEN LITTLE MIGHTYMOUSE JOHNSON WOULD HAVE KNOCKED HIM OUT 1 HIT
RECOMMEND HIGHLY LOCK YOUR  CARS ...
I just did that in GTA!
LOL this UFC fighter must have been hit in the head a little too often to let his car RUNNING unattended in today's world. NO Sensible person does that anymore. Remember, If your car is left running and is stolen,,any and ALL crimes committed with that car,,,YOU can be charged as an Accessory. FACT.
He regrets not permanently changing that man’s life.
You mean a few good knee shots to the Head not punches . nevertheless great story . I just think that he may have stopped himself just a little too soon. good whoop ass session where ass holes  need to be whooped. keep up the good work my man🇺🇸💪
Ufc fighter pounds car thief  Ayo
It's illegal to leave our car unlocked in Australia.  Even if you're just leaving for a minute to pay for gas, you can be fined...unlikely but it has happened.
is it them again? oh its always them
Dude said “sheesh”
the announcer playing it down like it's a harmless prank: "sheesh".
It is so infuriating to see these parasites of society stealing anything they can get their scumbag hands on. Well done to this guy for punching this particular maggot.
Sweet fanny, I mean fupa pack, bro.  And, lock your car doors.  That dummy was probably "puffing" (leaving the car running) which is illegal in CO for the exact reason shown above.
Nigga took the wrong car
I wish I had detained him - A thought that probably came to him a week later with that IQ.
Who the f leaves their car unlocked and running lol? Guess too much shots to the head makes the mind work differently.
If that was a professional ufc fighter,  who was it???
Should have a gun to pop a round
That's awesome.  Gas under $4 a gallon.
3.64 for regular good ol days
WAS ACTED.🤔
👍
Just the right amount of ass whooping. Any more "discipline" from the UFC guy and the thief could sue him for breaking is jaw...
Dana White has a gas station?
Just another day in a blue city.  In this case the once great city of Denver in the once great state of Colorado.
Did You leave the car Running?? The. you deserve what You get
He's lucky he didn't get shot. Just let them take the car all. You can recover it or get a new one.. crazy people in this world.
Wait, so it is okay to leave the car running if you are a UFC fighter?🙃
Any one who wantonly destroys healthy trees to sell a product deserves jail not money !
He didn’t lock his car??!!! WTF??!!!
Nice subtitles covering part of the action
I missed it all?
LMAO. GRT JOB 👍👍👍👍👍
lumpy gets a beat down yea boy !😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
what a dummy
Respect. What a way to get your car back.
brilliant!!!!!
Who da fook is that guy?
The thief running away reminds me of the video of the baby monkey that hit it's head on a metal swing. The dude was probably saying " OOOWW! Oww oww. And away from the camera he was probably like " shit that hurt! "
Black on Black crime?  So, when does the protesting and rioting begin?
Herb Dean disqualified him for throwing two knees to the face to a downed opponent....
i wish only one more thing too, that the nag would have died
Thief...IQ is low (hence having to steal for a living)  UFC fighter...IQ is even lower.....leaving your car running and unoccupied?...you've been hit in the head too much
Good work mate
If you're stupid enough to leave your unattended car running, what do you expect?
No need for a gun
He should have broken both his arms and both his legs and do it slowly.
That’s it?……. Thumbs sideways for misleading headline and the fighter actually getting some knees in
Yup, it’s the old I only have this here gold medal and not a dozen weapons strapped to my body trick. Well played.
oooof
I really love it when these attempts goes south for these loser's in life. Good grab M.M.A. dude!
But the Fanny pack!!! Lmfao I love it badass man protecting his shit while having easy access to all things
Thongs change scent from one end to the other. Knowledge is power.   God bless
Leave the car running iff ya wanna 2 second sparring session with a scumbag thief. 🥴🤣
I can’t imagine leaving my car running anywhere. I don’t care if I’m in the smallest, safest town in America. It’s just ingrained in me to turn off the car and lock it up.
The ufc fighter isn’t too bright if he left his car Running AND unlocked 🙄
Seems like the door lock was at fault both times...
How in the fook did he get the car started?
When the cats are away the mice will play....said no mouse ever.
It’s a shame he wasn’t concealing and carrying. Would’ve been a lot more efficient to just shoot the thief.
Low life pos I’ll bet he’s already stole another vehicle
that UFC fighter should have been Conor McGregor 😂
why the fuck is there a dinosaur on the gas station? seems insulting
Some punches is a good price, some owners would have shoot with a gun :)
What he really meant : “My only regret is that I didn’t knock him out cold”
The universe is alright sometimes!
I am sorry he didn't kill him because that 💩 will attack someone else
He lives in the wrong place. The plague is where it is.  Move or fight....
That’s what everyone needs to start doing!
Clickbait... no punches.. no kicks,  thief still has a pulse.... sad ending...disappointing..!🐀
Always assume the driver of the car you're stealing is an MMA fighter.
Anyone notice the 3.63 per gallon sign?😌
Why the dummy leave his keys in the car? Hit too many times in the head, bruh?
Watching him hold his head while he ran away made my day I'm simple like that
He probably paid him the gas after...
Wait till they go up against an ole man with head on swivel...that thug just had a good day this day....wow...so lucky it wasn't his last and this  thug a mite!!! That's when he might be a thug, they not sure..he will try this again...
Car running and open..... dipstick is asking to be a victim.
Dang look at how the thief walked away. Didn’t think he’d be thrown out from a vehicle that wasnt his and now hes all confused 😂
He got beat up by a guy with a fanny pack
He must've left the keys in the car for the thief to get in and drive away so easily.  So maybe the thief wasn't the only one who learned something that day.
I never lock my doors and it’s always running. My dog is like a honey badger in his space.
Is what you should of done was break both legs, and both arms, cause he used his legs to walk to your car and his hands to open door. No way would he have gotten off that easy with me. 🤷🤷. And I don't agree with people saying you should of locked your car, people have no business touching what is not theirs...........
I was more at aweee at the gas price
He thought no one would dare steal a ufc fighters car.....well...
Am I the only one who noticed that the camera was moving and following the car? That's not a security camera. This was likely set up for publicity.
3.64 in gas 🏴‍☠️
And throws a couple of punches   For good measures 😅
Ha Ha Ha Ha 🤪🤣😂😜🤔🇺🇸
That might be planted for some stunt making🤷‍♂️
Lmao dude must be crying BLM lmao.
What a dumb jackpot.
0:31 look at those as prices
I didn’t know Jon Jones worked for CBS news
In Canada few weeks ago a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey player got his Range Rover stolen ,  at the movie theater parking lot .
He was knocked into next week with a few jabs 🤣🤣
People always think "it won't happen to me. I'm only running in for 1 minute and I've been to this gas station a hundred times." And then they'll act surprised when their car gets stolen.
I no he gonna think twice.
The gas price🥺
Let it be a not professional fighter n a regular mf like me whoopen a mf n than get in trouble
The guy hit the thief so hard, the car put itself in park
Bro the ufc fighter isn’t that bright. Take your fuckin keys with you and lock the door. Does this mf not understand how the world works?
Should've chased him down.
a nobody boxer
0:44 sheeshh
3.64 for a gallon of gas😱
Nancy Pelosi and her Dems should introduce legislation requiring that all macho men, whatever their sport, must place a warning sticker on their windshields so that car thieves would not be endangered by trying to steal their cars. After all, those thieves are just trying to earn a living too you know. If we can be that forthcoming with the homeless, why not car thieves?
He doesn’t want him to do it again. But he will!
He. Must not be a very successful ufc fighter if he’s driving around in a civic,
Man that news channel did that ufc fighter dirty
This is a great video. That thief is lucky he didn’t pull his left hook and a right jab out the Fanny pack. He would have been knocked out
Who leaves their car engine running with the doors unlocked? And who drives a car with the doors unlocked?
Shouldve took out a eye atleast
What dumbass gets out of their car in public and leaves their keys in it? And running!
Get a gun he would have won
*Plot twist:*  UFC dude left his car running to catch a bad guy stealing his car.   Mission failed sucessfully. xD
Not a good ufc fighter. They don't punch. They lock you up. And take you to the ground 🤣
Take your keys out of the ignition. Lock your doors.
Wow
Knee shots 💥💥
All carjackers deserve this and much more😂
I think the real lesson here to all the little boys and girls is that if you work really hard and fight in the UFC you too can own a Toyota Camry or Corolla or whatever 24k dollar car that is...😢 😭 🤧 🤷
What I'm more amazed by is gas prices where half what they are now just 10 months ago. Fuck Joe Biden
Sheeeesh 💀
One thing to take not of when stealing a car is if the guy has cauliflower ear. Probably means he could turn you inside out
It was too inconvenient to never-mind locking the doors, never-mind taking the key out of the ignition, but too inconvenient to not leave the engine running? Really?!
WHERE ARE THE PIGS WHEN THIS HAPPENS!? RIGHT! DEFUND THE POLICE! THEY AREN'T THERE FOR YOU BUT AGAINST YOU!
Stupid left his car unlocked lucky car thief didn’t have a gun
Most Millennials are MMA Fighters. They don't contribute nothing to Society.
$3.64 per gallon? I can’t believe I say it but must be nice
is that a dinosaur gas station
I might have missed them but I certainly didn't see any punches??
That’s crazy! Gas was $3.64?!
Lesson One(1) for Drivers: a). Lock doors. b). Shut car off. c). Go into store to buy products. d). Pay for food e). Eat the food
Nobody’s gonna talk about the good old days when gas was $3.64 a gallon?  😏  @0:30
Dana cmon fighter pay guy rolln in a Kia that just shows. And car thief why that pos do u not see
Good hits 👌
I'm over here looking at that $3.64 a gallon price and wondering about time machines.
Should've done more damage
Got his ass beat 🤣🤣🤣 learned his lesson
that is it ?
I’m glad they aren’t looking at assault charges lol!! Sometimes the assault charges come a little frivolous I’ve had assault charges tried to me for not even fighting . No need to start throwin
Lame af
So did this guy seriously put the car in park? Why not hit the accelerator? So fkn stupid
Lock your car
Never heard of him and I didnt see any "pounding"
Gas $3.64 !
🤣 hilarious 👍
🤣
I always hated railroad crossing, out where I am there are a lot of crossings that have very tall grass or woods next to them. I thought how crappy it would be to be stuck there waiting for the train and a couple of armed robbers just walk out of the brush and Rob each person in their car and then walk away.
BLM finna THUG!
LOCK YOUR CAR?! DADADA DUH?!
Wait so he just left his car unlock and keys inside and engine running. Sound like someone got hit in the head to many times.
So why aren't we as a driver leaving our keys in our pockets at all times even if it's for a second? The fact that it "couldn't happen to me or won't happen to me" doesn't mean we should act like the three seconds are stuff is unattended won't get stolen
Plot twist: The UFC fighter kept the car on to do a robbery while the robber robbed the UFC robber🔺🔺🔺🔺🔺Illuminati 👁👁
The latest trend is to leave your car running with no one instead, he absolutely should have had his car stolen for being such an idiot.
If you leave your car running you deserve to get it stolen
Did anyone notice the price of gas in this video?? LGB
Hahahahaha
This would be my luck
That’s called ass-whopping. But Lock it up!!!!
YouTube is against freedom of speech.
When the judicial system won't put criminals in their place, the citizens will take matters into their own hands.
I'll argue that none of the "punches" were good.  The thief walked away, he wasn't even stunned, and should have been unconscious....
Thats what he gets lol
Both too dumb to lock the door💀
Horrible video footage.
Bro we would be forever grateful if you inflicted more damage.
Gas was under $5 once upon a time?
I know Muay Thai knees when I see em
fuckin gas was $3.63/gallon brang them days back
I’m more amazed at the gas prices wish I had it that cheap
Rule #0 don’t ever leave your car running when you go in the stoe
Not a smart move. Let him take the car its why we have insurance. Or take a chance of getting shot!! hm
Please who leave their car running are idiots, I'm sorry.
Was that a pounding? I must have missed it.
I'm sure he was just going to the gas pump to fill it up for you maybe it was just a good deed that was poorly executed
I think this fake. Setup for publicity stunt.
He didn’t do shit???
“UFC FIGHTER POUNDS THIEF” lmaooo
Why didn't he give him a few slaps?
I knew a man that had his brand new pickup truck stolen when he left it unlocked and running at a convenience store. He was the shop Steward for our union. Everyone laughed at him for months over it! 🤣
Wow yeah that's a fair ending he probably didn't knock it out  Didn't see if they had a knife or anything big
That thief is just lucky he didn't get knocked tf out bruh
Wish I had that gas price rn
So you left your keys in the vehicle with it running?  Its obvious you've been hit in the head too many times.
This is gonna be funny 😂😂😂
Ah, I remember when gas was only $3.64. Those were good times...
Lol wow.
Hahahaa! Looked like the fighrer was going for the Thai clinch! Watch Rich Franklin v. Anderson Silva to see what that's like.  Coward ran off holding his busted up face. That POS will roll some 90 year old woman next.
its a low chance and my boy got unlucky
Actually the REAL lesson here is that it’s ok to leave your car running while the doors are unlocked if you are a professional MMA fighter
Was kinda hoping for a epic cathartic beat down. Still, nice knowing that would-be thief was deterred here.
Jordan is a hella good fighter too. Not to mention his story is NUTS
0:31 That's the most impressive part of this video - $3.64/gallon
I think the thief should’ve locked the doors 🤣 lmao
Lmao dude was holding his head , homie hit him with that shabang 💥🤣🤣
The report at the end was like sheeesh!
Why did he put the brakes on and stop for the guy to pull him out?  Something looks a little fishy about this.
Someone tried to do this to me and stalled got out and ran 🤣
DON'T LEAVE YOUR KEYS IN THE CAR!!!!
That's why if you get a gay ass civic you get an si
Those where definitely knees not punches but ok
*****Stares are gas prices
He didn’t beat him hard enough. He’s probably doing the same again.
He's probably an opportunist junkie.  Junkies commit on average seven petty crimes a day to feed their addictions.  Portugal has dramatically reduced this level of minor crimes due to their strategy to offer addicted drug users the option of a criminal record or rehabilitation.  The vast majority choose the latter, and many of them return to their communities as balanced individuales that contribute positively to society.
News reporter really said sheesh
cbs losers
Wtf, Americans leave their car running? Why would you do that when you're not living in Siberia where your car will get frozen when you turn the engine off?
Ground and pound baby !!!!!😵‍💫
$3.64 per gallon GODAMN !!
$3.00 gas. I will vote for that again. 2016 here we come.
That would’ve stopped a few miles down the road maybe if he had his key
Anyone see those gas prices. Man I miss anything below 4 bucks. 🥲
A few good knee punches🤣
Why was it left running and unlocked? Who does that
Sad part about the injustice system is I believe he could have been charged with assault because you’re not allowed to use deadly force to protect property…. Dumbest law ever 🙃
dino care😭💀
What’s going on with everyone leaving there car on and unlock like come one man what do you expect y’all both dumb
Dude had a fannypack too hahaha
Never got why people left their cars on while unattended
Is that a Fanny pack
Nigga got handled
Punches ? 😂😂Ian see none
Good man we need more like him
but... like... you think you live in the Netherlands?? you think you're in Canada? wtf did you expect leaving the car unlocked and running?  Don't want to leave your wallet and cellphone along with your wife and kids now that you are at it?
I WAS looking for the new MW2 but the title … smh the title screwed me .
In gta4 my man keep his foot on throttle instead of locking the doors it defends
.....he wants people to learn to not leave your car running and lock your car ......🤦🤦🤦🤦. Dumbass. No shit. Crazy second time in last 3 months, person I work with and now this story where someone leaves car running while they go in store. An then they're shocked they got jacked.
This must be fake!!   Only $3.64 for a gallon of gas!
First time i ever heard someone professionally say "sheeesh" 🤣🤣🤣
He lying, he know he wanted to fuck him up for lmao.
Knees to the face is more like it
damn his car was unlocked and running..lol
Even in a safe country like Portugal, you don't go anywhere without turn off the engine, take the keys and lock the doors. Only in America😂😂
Sheesh 😂
If you leave your car while it's still running your freaking asking to get car jacked.
Imagine leaving your car running and unlocked to go into a store. There are too many scum criminals in the world to be living a comfortable life in public unfortunately
Wish we got a picture of the dude after
Beautiful 😂😂
You leave the car running. He tries to steal it. Hard to tell who is dumber.
Bro. Not only did he leave the car unlocked but he also left the car on.. idiot! Lucky he was able to stop the guy. But seriously people. Be smarter.  Lock your cars and definitely dont leave it running
wow dont i miss those gas prices
Back when gas was 3.64 a gallon..... ahhh the good Ole days
Who the hell leaves their car running and unlocked. You’re begging to be robbed Lol
Come on now, people have such a bad habit of leaving their doors unlocked at gas stations cuz it's a "quick trip". Always lock them, it takes one button to do it. Always assume one person around there is a petty thief
He didn't even run after him🤣
“Sheeesh”💀💀
3.64 a gallon sheeeesh
He said shesh, a new anchor
Plot twist  The fighter is trying to up his worth. The robber is an actor. Dana likes this guy and will organise an interview with Joe Rogan. This guy goes on to dethrone Stylebender and the Nigerian Nightmare
He should know better...
0:32 look at the gas ⛽️ price tho 😂😂😂😂😂
i mean he left his car running..😭
Lesson learned dont leave your car running and open. Stupid
U deserve to get ur vehicle stolen if u leave it unlocked n with the keys in???
A couple of UFC knees to the head.....LOL. But I have to ask the question: Who leaves a running car unattended or a car with the keys in the ignition? I hope both the criminal and the UFC fighter learned something from this encounter
the bad guy was nice enough to put it in park?
Im impressed with his self control. He couldve beat that guy to death if he wanted to but instead he gave him a few knots to the dome and let him go.
Bro that’s no ufc fighter
He shouldn't have left the keys in the ignition.
Lame
Professionalism is the name of their game
MY HEAD‼️
Lol the title......
I dunno, part of me wants to believe he leaves his car running all of the time hoping someone tries to steal it.
If he had a gun, or a knife, your dead.  Make sure it's worth it folks.
Never locked his car and left it running? Deserves to get stolen.
When people mess with the wrong ones yeahyeah
I thought he was going to say:  my only regret was to leave my car running & unlocked while I went into the gas station like an idiot..
imagine if the theif had a gun and shot the poor fighter
Who doesn't know to turn off the car,  take your keys/fob and lock your damn doors?
I leave my truck running with the AC on for my live anti theft system (85lbs Doberman Pinscher) 😂
Gas $3.00.. better save this Video!! You’ll NEVER see gas at that price again, Unless TrumP comes back.. this is BIDEN n the Looney Lefts America!!
His face looks like someone who you shouldn't fuck with.
lock the doors when you go inside stores  also lock the doors when you're stealing a car
U kno he wanted to do more damage 🤣🤣🤣
On this weeks edition of F round and Find Out
Black Lives Matter??
I fart in my car all the way to the gas station and close the door. So if someone tries to steal it they get a piece of me inside of their nostrils
You can leave it running if you have the key fob on you. A person can't take off without the key fob 😁🤣
Dayum UFC fighters need to be paid better!!!
when gas was 3.64 cents
To be honest, it's pretty reckless to leave your car open and running when you're away from it at any point, but I hope that thief learned his lesson from this ass whooping 😂
The ufc dude lucky that he didn’t get paaaaaak!
Guy obviously played too much Grand Theft Auto as a kid and found out real life is a lil different 🙄
Lol
In the marines, we do a security check always
The way he was holding his head when he walked away 🤣🤣🤣
UFC fighters drives a Honda? Dana white really is a cheap assholeee
You should've broken his spine and then he could have his own wheelchair CAR for LIFE!
What I wouldn’t give for gas at $3.64
💥💥💥Tried to rob a gladiator 💥💥💥💥
Why does the news waste time posting this. Hopefully everyone knows that they never show anything. I'd rather find raw footage
Autovote fuck you federal loophole hee hack pays me Cuzco you all have been fucked assholes to me
Not a ufc fighter lol. Nigga from Rosa.
Ufc fighter and stupid enough to let the car unatended with the doors unloked
The only time you should be scared of a man wearing a fanny pack on his stomach.
POUNDS car thief? He did exactly not that. Clickbait.
Lol that’s dude want a real one ! Just a crack out tweaker watch out for the reals one’s ufc not going work on them
Yes had my car stolen at gas station never leave it running
Imagine being in 2022 and still calling MMA fighters “UFC fighters” 🤦
He should ended up with left kick for KO.
Never heard of him
kids please listen for when y’all get older: NEVER LEAVE UR DAMN CAR RUNNING EVEN IF UR RUNNIN INSIDE FOR A PUFF BAR SHIT COULD ESCALATE WITHIN 5 SECONDS U LEAVE THAT CAR.
Damn gas under 4$
Bro got lucky! His flight extinct saved his life!!
Did someone just really remind me to lock my car and not leaving it running when im not using it?  It's official people. The United States is over.
Damn I wish we had 3.64 gas prices again
Let's go Brandon..
He hit that boy with them knees lol
Headline kinda sus. 😭
Cauliflower ear confirms this guy is legit.
Did this nigga just say sheesh on a live news broadcast? 😅 mah nigga - dizzy Washington
This https://youtu.be/MHKjFH6dk6Y is what happened to #ThaDose.,
Never mess with a professional fighter wearing a fanny pack!
Ahhh $3.64 a gallon!
Looks staged.
Lmao the way the prick fuck ran off 🤣🤣
I like to leave my pitt bull in back seat with car running and unlocked when I go to gas station. They won't know what's waiting for them until they get inside. It's a fun little surprise for them. XD
Back when gas was still good
I lock my car 6 times as I walk away from it I'm not sure how anyone does this😆
Look at the skin color
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS? I HAVE ANSWERS!!--Death and murder increasing! ...LAWS are made to protect people and increase or maintain quality of life for humans.. There is a growing REBELLIOUS trend to TRASH laws, including moral ones, as mentioned in the bible.  99% of preachers don't even support ALL 10 commandments, and many don't support even any by their LAWLESS heresy. CRIME & CLERGY CONNECTION = TRICKLE DOWN IMMORALITY.. "When people’s thinking is controlled by the sinful self, they are against God, because they refuse to obey God’s law and really are not even able to obey God’s law." ROMANS 8:7 Society will increasingly SUFFER! The barbarians are coming, the barbarians are coming...!!! The preachers lead the charge!!
No bro you wanted to do more damage an it’s OK. He needed to learn a lesson the hard way.
The real story is a UFC professional fighter drives a base civic. Pay the man Dana!
Why did he let the guy leave the scene?  I'm sure after his headache subsided he just went out and victimized someone else.
😂
Yes!!!!!
Something gives me a lil overdose of   Dopamine when I watch this. I watched it five times and believe me you , if someone tries to gank my truck , I’m Not just gonna stand there like an idiot like “what’s going on”. like I probably would of. I’m gonna burst into a full sprint and get that fucking door handle and grab some shirt and throw some elbows . thank you for this video.
Bruh.... he should of make him bleed to teach his stupid ass a lesson
You cannot leave your car unlocked at any time whatsoever. I was taking groceries out of my car and forgot to lock it at the end (and I never forget), mind you my car is right in front of my house, didn’t matter, someone got in and went through the glove compartment. Thankfully they didn’t find anything, but it could have been worse if they knew how to start it. Not the house, not the car, can’t leave anything unlocked if you live in a city.
He left running rubbing his head🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you. It's common sense, but common sense isn't common anymore. An once of prevention is worth a pound of cure. People never think it will happen to them. Ha, Ha it is so funny, Tee, He it is to laugh.
He is lucky.. soon as my vehicle comes out of park the doors lock!!
"The way of the transgressors is hard." -bible If only this was more instant for corrupt government elites.
Two knees to the head with zero training and no knowledge how to block. I reckon that guy had a second head by the morning 🤣
He's too nice, that's why he can't no wins in the UFC.
"I only regret one thing.  The price of fuel now that Joe Biden is president."
He was stupid for letting his car unlocked and run. 🤦‍♂️
Sheesh indeed 😮‍💨
In the UFC and driving around a Honda Civic….. Dana White, this does not look good sir lol
"pounds"
Two idiots meet at the mini mart.
Bruh... If you left the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked, he wasn't stealing that car, you were giving it to him...
Jesus loves you!!!
Leaving the Door unlocked and Keys in the ignition...?  Really...?
Leaving your car unlocked and running is illegal in most states and in all states,  insurance will not cover the car stolen in this manner.
Car thief is a total punk. Should have stood toe to toe.
Me when I try to rob a car in bitlife
Well done Sir !
Damn…$3.64 a gallon?? Good times, good times
My my, and what color was the thief? Typical
Gee was that thief black...omg what a shock
A lot of dumb ppl out there, still naive, leaving doors unlocked 😒
He got cut from UFC
$3.64/ gallon! Wheee is that. I’m on my way to fill up
Man didnt even put his seat belt on smh who gave this man a license thats like number1 safety to pass a test lol
Diversity
ive seen those knees at Norcal Fighting Alliance before....
I remember back then when you could leave your car on while you went into a gas station and no one would take it!
great work, see we dont need the gov (cops)to fight our problems for us, this saved personal , court cost and taxpayers money and they both learned something they will never forget. Kudos now the rest of you should do the same then we can fire the very people that cause this to occur down the line in the first place. No cops no criminals.
He left his car unlocked and running? Is it 1950?
Getting your ass whooped by a dude with a fanny pack, regardless who said dude is, still looks some type of way lmao
Kudos to the UFC guy! Watching this, my only regret was that the UFC guy didn't really work him over, enough where he couldn't run away. Then quickly use his cell phone to call the cops and wait for them to take him to the pokey.   😆
🤣😂💪👈💯
lol
People need to also learn to not let them escape. better off dead than doing it to someone else.
*thief steals car, is backing out* *MMA guy opens door, punch.exe loading* "It was at this moment, he knew he fucked up"
He left it running not too smart
Shoulda beat that loser up to where he can’t walk ever again…
Na el ladrón no sabia pelear así quien no le pega a alguien.
So who was shooting the video?
I wish gas prices were still $3.64
Wait... he hasn't been crucified by BLM yet?
UFC fighter? Name that fighter
I never understand people who leave their cars running and then walk away from it while the doors are unlocked. I had a neighbor once do that when he came over our house when I was a young teenager, and then he walked outside and his car was gone. Foolish decision.
Oh so why did an intelligent young men leave that keys on the engine and running on the car ? Plus obviously he can luck the car because the car is on ?!  No common sense in his case!!!!!! Lock your car ! Don’t leave it on while you aren’t in control!!!!!!
The complexion of this thief.... is.... a coincidence
No, please do more damage, significantly more.
Thief has never played gta.. lock the car once you get in!
Anyone else feel like this was staged?  Like answer a few questions I had.  1. The guy never shows his face. 2. How does he have time to put the car in park? 3. He doesn't seem to really hit the guy? 4. If he really wanted grab him. He could have easily restrained him?
That's what you get fo not being eco friendly...
Yeah don't fuck with a guy whose ears look like that, I'm always looking for cauliflower ear
Yes. Great job!!!
The UFC fighter surely could have KOd the thief. Not sure if it was compassion or not wanting to be charged because he is a professional fighter but a KO would have made for an even better video. Great job with the knee strike to the head.
Haha.
Well dont be stupid and leave the car running
Coursehesblack
I wish someone would do this and be honest instead of pc. For example.....the only thing I regret was I didn't hospitalize the little prick
We need to come down hard on career criminals here in America.
was it a ploy by the UFC fighter to lure in an unsuspecting car thief so he can beat the crap out of that guy?  otherwise why leave the car unlocked and engine running?
He just.... Let him go? What the fuck
Thief also left the car unlocked🙄
https://youtu.be/oUIUC2-GiGo
“Not to do more damage”  Whatever you say man 😂
Those weren't punches, though. Those were some Sagat Tiger Knees.
Lock your car and never leave it running 🤣🤣🤣
You left your car unlocked and running hahahahahahshshs
Lol. That fool is holding his head.
$3.64, wow look at those Gas prices!
I love it! Instant Karma
Dont steal a dudes car with an ear like that!
Bro you leave your car running and unlocked in gas station parking lot?
Turn your car OFF when exiting it... Pretty Simple People.
The worst part is how dana white is still not paying these fighter
9 months ago... miss those gas prices...........
Did the news guy really say sheesh😂
neighborhood justice
that was like playing cod on christmas day while everybody else has prestiged 5 timed
NEVER LEAVE IT RUNNIG LOL
Williams looks like he lost the fight 💀
Didn't look like much of a fight. Certainly not enough to tout "UFC". Big deal. Just remember, if there is a referee, it's not a fight.
Well you looking for trouble if you leave your car running. It’s Denver, you forgot!
Leave your car running with keys: stupid. Remote starting a car that can’t leave without the key and watching people try to open the locked door: funny.
Automatic dislike for a democratic news anchor saying sheesh
Never ever mess with someone who sports cauliflower ears!
When you’re a low level rogue and you walk into a boss battle without knowing
He's 9-6-0. Not a great fighter. He has almost as many losses as wins. LOL
He ran away holding his face or head. lol!
Lesson for thieves - see an 👂 like that, run the other way
do more damage make him pay he'll never forget.
Where do you get gas that cheap?
Sorry, but it looks staged.
😆😆😆
THEY'RE CALLED KNEES TO THE FACE, NOT PUNCHES.
Brotha said throw hands
I saw 2 fast knees to the head 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
GOOD JOB
Bait car: UFC edition. Make it happen Dana
It would have been a lot better if the car thief caught a bullet instead. He'll just victimize someone else now.
Got beat up by guy with a fanny pack!
Civic gang
He left the car running.
Thought he was going to put him in a headlock beat the s*** out of him boring
Punches = Fists  Knees = Knees   The more you know.
He was wearing a fanny pack
Sounds like a job for a strap, not a melee fighter.
he kneeded that lol.....mayb a couple more
You just got beat up by a guy with a fanny pack.
That fanny pack.
It's hilarious how the thief ran off holding he's head😂🤣 🤕
wish i hadn't left the key in the ignition...............
whats the fighters name ive never seen him
freekin idiot most likely left the car running  while he went inside!
Duh! This fighter is an idiot for leaving his car running. The rule of taking your keys with you and locking our car doors has been a publicly known safety measure for years.  Why would you risk losing something you've paid over 20,000 for by not protecting it with something as simple as taking the keys with you? I don't feel much sympathy for victims in these scenarios.
🤪
Why leave your car running in the first place? Either way... This one ends well.
Not just a fanny pack, but A LARGE, YELLOW FANNY PACK!
Nice title for the actual broadcast
No. Do damage. Lots of damage.
He gets in and sits there to the point they need to edit the video. If I stole a car I wouldn’t scroll on Tik-Toc for a few minutes. Look deeper
I guess he figured he could just pound any would be thief into the pavement if the need arose.  The rest of us need to just lock the damn car and take the key with us.
There's a reason he works on the news he dont know much about other things "punches" lol
Good for him.
I'd hardly call that a pounding. Watch much UFC or boxing? Very dramatic!
Every car or truck I've owned that wasn't like from the 80's auto locks when you put it in drive. Strange maybe I just had weird vehicles, still he's lucky he got away could've got beat and arrested.
Or you can just hit that button on your keyfob with the lock symbol on it. That's also an option for ya.
Mf ran away crying
What he was supposed to say was: "I regret not locking my car, that was pretty stupid" It does show however, why everyone should know how to fight, it`s not self defense, it`s to make people sorry they messed with your sh*t ;)
meh he let the guy go
omg look at the gas price!!!
Lesson for drivers: Never mess with a man and a fanny pack.
Usual suspects AGAIN
What kind of thief doesn’t lock the door after getting in? He deserved that beatdown for his dumbaxery.
He better be glad that guy didn’t floor it
0:44 “sheeesh🤓”
Imagine trying to steal a car and getting your ass beat by a man wearing a fanny pack.
They’re both lucky. The thief is lucky that guy didn’t beat the hell out of him and the guys lucky the thief wasn’t the type to shoot you in the face over a stolen car. I’m glad it worked out for the guy though.
Huh...
😎
Usual suspect
And while wearing a fanny pack. Dude’s a legend.
He left his car unlocked and running? How did this guy make the UFC?
I own a stick shift car.   I'll leave that bih anywhere ain't nobody gon get it far.
The real crime is 3.64 cents a litre
I came back to my car with a guy in the front seat trying to hot wire it.  Just walked calmly up and told him to get the hell out - he did and walked away embarrassed.  Same wish as this gentleman, that I could have kept him till the cops got there.  Rarely can the young ones steal my car .. they can't drive a manual transmission.  It's one of the reasons I leave the doors unlocked, so they won't break the window to get in.
Not a UFC fighter guy probably just practices MMA talking heads are so clueless!
Simon si todavía lo tengo ya sabes
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😶 That thief is going home with the punch pain! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I'm sure BLM and Al Sharpton will call this racism. White man punched a black man, OMG, it has to be racism from a white supremacist!
Don't F with a dude wearing a fannypack!  I have a feeling that knee the fighter threw was a bit painful. Too bad he didn't hold him down for the police.
In other words, he should’ve put him in the hospital!!!😂
Bet the crook tried to sue him for racial profiling.
You should not have let him get away that easily... Beat the crap out of him at least
Hard to believe but there's some scumbag saying he shouldn't of done that to him.
I can’t believe how many people are leaving cars unlocked and running..😳
U see them (UFC fighters) on TV & u think they make good money. Then u see them in the news, having to fight to save their (probably used) economy car from a thief. Way to go Dana.
He fights better than he can talk, didn't understand a bloody word that came out of his mouth.
Good, but not nearly as good as the video of the two purse snatchers who tried to steal the purses of two MMA fighters who were on their way to a drag party.  Or the one of the guy who tried to rob the MMA fighter in the days before cell phones, and the guy beat him down so bad, he made him WAIT ~outside~ a phone booth while he called the cops on him, and promised him that if he made him chase him down and bring him back, it would be 10x as bad.
Bring deagle ... settle
Could you make it any easy for the guy to steal your car?
He was probably like , hell im gonna leave my car unlock and running. And nobody will take it.  Nobody will mess with me , I’m an mma fighter.
I lock my doors when I get out to stand next too my car. Good habits is how I see it
Knee blast, love it.. it's so hard to know what to do and not to do in these situations and only seconds to respond. What if that guy had a gun.. ending would be different. Very fortunate and blessed brother!
Fix that crook so he is not able to father any more children.
Maybe UFC but also Ultimate Idiot Driver; lock the damn car!!!
Who the Hell leaves their car running in a parking lot like that?! UFC fighter be-damned I own a gun and I still find this to be a profoundly stupid thing to do. Now, I can (in my car at least) run it while I'm in the gas station while my key fob is in my pocket (I don't do this). Once a would be thief jumps in and throws it into drive (or reverse) the car will warn him he needs the key. After two seconds the car completely shuts down, locks the doors, and won't do anything until you clear it with your fob. I don't know if you can open the doors after a lock down without double tapping the unlock button.  My car is a Stinger Yellow 2017 Dodge Challenger RT Classic. If anyone in here has a Challenger let me know if their doors will unlock after an emergency shutdown. For reference- I know about being able to unlock the doors simply by walking up and opening them with the fob in your pocket.
The only thing he regrets is not the yellow fanny pack? O.o
Shoulda belly to back suplexed his ass on the concrete. He wouldn't have run off so easily
He's lucky he didn't get his hat rack clapped. Or ran over. Luckily the theif was just a theif. Insurance can't replace your life.
Yeah don't need the lesson to lock my car .  Surprised the car didn't crash ,  how did he get the door open ,  it locks when you put it in gear?
The owner could have been dragged by the open door
Damn ninjas 🥷
Look, a black guy
If only the UFC pays better than it would’ve been a car worth stealing 🤦🏽‍♂️
Stop bragging
Our world is going to sh!t
I work at a gas station and dozens of people leave their cars running while they go inside for a couple of minutes. There’s never been an incident. I feel like this is some California shit.
The Fanny pack tho🤣 that’s bde right there!
Shitty thing is that’s all a UFC fighter can afford to drive.
Only way I’m leaving keys in the car is if I don’t want the car anymore 😂
lock your car
Ive seen a lot of people leave their cars by themselves running with music or with windows down and have it be so easily stolen. Newer and older cars, most of the time to play their music
Can’t have been that good a hit if he was still able to run away.
Williams is a good heart'd BAD ASS!
Don’t leave your car running folks.  Moral of the story.  That and don’t steal a UFC fighters car obviously.
If you're an adult who doesn't lock your car, and leaves it running, you deserve it.  Good on him though. Lesson learned
Dude is very humble. He's a UFC fighter and drives a civic 🤟
lmfao i been seeing more and more thiefs going agens ufc and mma fighter latly
UGH I can laugh at him getting at the thief but the second I heard left it unlocked AND running.....Full Metal Jacket - Sergeant Hartman's voice immediately comes into my head. "If it wasn't for dickheads like you, there wouldn't be any thievery in this world"
The way the car thief ran away holding his head was pure comedy 🤣
It seems like the car would have been locked since it was in gear.
Some people don't need to learn to lock their cars and not leave them running, kind of normal for them to do without lessons.
dude ran away face palming
So the UFC Fighter got arrested for assault and then bragging about it on social media right?
That is discrimination to black people! You should have let him get away! BLM!
Sheesh
he left it running? idiot.
Cool, but grown men shouldn't leave their vehicle unlocked and running with keys in the ignition. Only teenagers do... Actually, not even them. Maybe grandmas and soccer moms.
Did the thief put the car in park or something'/??? I would've expected it to keep rolling'/!!!
Yep he left the car running so it would seem"/!!!
after one knee on head robber realize he on different league
Williams is an idiot for leaving the car running.
Either scripted for some clout or he's dumb enough to not lock his doors.
Wish he got a few more good shots at that subhuman mutant.
You leave your key in the car, you are asking it to be stolen.
Isn't it crime for them to use their hands. I mean Tyson can't use his legally
Prediction? Pain...
Why the fuck didn't he grab him and submit him to the ground till the pigs came??? Was it staged..
Yes! Whoop that trick
https://youtu.be/FVfXW1rNOnU
Car thief 'reverse chokes' during getaway. Submits keys back to owner..
Bet he will think twice before jacking a car again 😅
People are stupid!!!!! Lmaoooo
I'm sorry did he leave his car unlocked and running with the keys in the ignition while he was inside the store? Damn thats another level of stupid you're just asking for it at that point.
Did the news reporter say "sheesh"?
One thing that is very prevalent of male members of the black community is to leave their car running with the radio making really loud thump sounds. It forces you to notice their car, and I suppose they’re hungry for the attention.          If a busy convenience store parking lot is quiet, I’ve seen black men leave the store and start their car, turning the radio up way too loud, then go back inside and get back in line. It’s as if they realize that there wasn’t anyone doing it, and now was their chance to get all the attention for themselves.          Think about it, how many times have you seen a video like this? I’ve been seeing these same scenarios for years. You know every one of those black men who either suffer the loss, or barely make it in time, has seen a video like this. The temptation to fantasize about everybody looking at them is just too compelling. I’m sorry, but even though culture is a large part of everyone’s life, not everything your culture tempts you to do should be indulged. Right?
Why is ufc fighter drives a Honda civic?
Yes I leave my keys in my car with it running. And I only do it cause I wanna beat the shit outta people who try to steal
And that kids, is why you ALWAYS lock the doors after you get in a car 😂😂😂
Idk... The whole thing is pretty funny, but the fanny pack just seals the deal
Another white suprem.... oh wait, no it was a black man trying to steal the car...
BTW, take advantage of my mistake and always hide any valuables from view when you leave your car. I left my phone on the seat of my locked car, and in less then ten minutes, a thief smashed the passenger window and grabbed it.
Denver, CO… well well well… I’ve been saying this since I’ve moved here almost two years ago. This place if FUCKING horrible. Not even half a year here my car has been almost stolen. Never has that happened, and that’s the height of it maaaaaaybe for me. Another weird thing slightly off subject is a like 16 or so yo cut in front of my girlfriend and I… I was in disbelief she was on her phone the entire time and when time to order in the chipotle she was rude with this attitude. There’s a bunch more shit I could type out, but if you are thinking moving here don’t. We are planning to move to Amarillo where FAMILY is at. That’s another thing, stop moving to big city’s for something… listen to Riptide by Vance joy you’ll understand. Maaaaaaaaybe.
I love the fact that the guy is holding his head as he is running away, and also I have always said that only an idiot leaves their car unlocked and running at any given time.
Why the white people let the keys in the car?? Clowns
People who annoy you!
Lesson for everyone ,Owner Drivers or thieves : Lock the Damn Doors!
why would you create distance what if he pulled a gun and shot him
And that was the moment he realised he'd f+*#ed up!!!🤣🤣🤣
All while wearing a yellow fancy pack. What a legend.
Why the hell would you leave your car unlocked???
as soon as he started throwing knees the guy was like "nah f**k this I'm out"
Who goes in the store with the car running though? Was asking to have it stolen
he should have handed him to the cops, now he´s out there doing it to someone else.. Nice knees to the head though.
Commo mah This is how you not done Carry a gun its so cheap Be professional
nothing like catching the knee to the face from a guy with a fanny pack
never solve problems, get rid of them. u want that car? dude in ur way? kill him!
I've said it before, I'll say it again - anyone that leaves the keys in the ignition (let alone leaves the car running unattended) should be held responsible for any damage or harm caused by the thief. Up to and including manslaughter. You have to be a moron to leave the keys in your car these days. You might as well leave your loaded shotgun leaning against the wall outside the store.
Yea learn people are SCUMBAGS
Imagine going home and seeing your ass get kicked on Live TV. I'd take that shit to the grave lol...
Image someone tries to rob Dwayne Johnson
👍🏾🤣
i see that guy on the news alot
You know he said you got the wrong car.
Fake & staged to get a million views
mmm news report seems to think fighter is a hero, not s dumb shmuck. Regrets not apprehending thief but not locking his car. anyway, well done to the fighter for keeping his car
If you're gonna be dumb...better be tough.
Come to europe, americans. Your behaviours will be outsourced swiftly
We read the headline, just show the clip without yapping
He should just do bait car so he can practice on criminals
"how dare this racist man injure some poor man who just needed a care" - the left
Those......... aren't punches...... O_o
Thief got some licks, but not hard enough to wake the amygdala.
Don't be afraid to stomp that knee cap people make em feel it for years
Sheeeeeeeshhh
😂 he was running and holding his face
Its not theft when u leave car door unlocked with the car still running. It's called "take my car and do as you wish".
" IT IS ALL OVER "
Assume car was automatic, why didnt it keep moving after he pulled guy out. If was manual shift car would have bucked as it stalled, it didnt. Hmmmm
“UFC FIGHTER POUNDS CAR THIEF” 🍑😂😂
sad that people never learn you gotta think how long can you keep livin recklessly before your not livin at all you only get so many chances people just do better we can all be better just try to find it in you defend yourself of course but would be a better world if we didn't have too as much as we do right now
Never heard of a Jordan Williams in the ufc
"Pounds"
The thief would’ve gotten away with it if he had locked the door lol
My Current 2022 vehicle wont let me lock my car while its running. My 2014 Vehicle will lock doors and wont shift without the Key Fob while its running. Yes, lock your cars either way.
left car running? clearly too many shots to the head in the ring
Nothing worse then a thief.
jajaj karma😂
I didn't see the punches
SHEESH
oooohhhh you touched one of the privledged classes. thats a no no. he did nothing wrong.
That boy said hell naaah “ Did I get jumped ? Was that more than 1 person” 😂😂😂 UFC had them lethal knees  it was just 1 person
he asked for it, he left his car running and the doors unlocked
all that for a regular civic not even an Si lmfaoo
Fanny pack and cauliflower ear...bad choice thief
Great job!
half of crime is opportunity.
And nothing said of the ethnicity of to car thief. Imaginal that.
Entrapment!
Good friend of mine left his car running in winter to warm it up; came out ten minutes later, car was gone. Cops found it a few days later. Why take an Uber when you can hop in a go...lol.
He could have apprehended him he made a clear choice not to for whatever reason
2 KNEE STRIKES!
Should have broken his hands.Makes it harder to steal stuff
He never learned that before?
clown the fanny pack if you want to, its either you see that or the steel balls hanging down it props up.
Not much of a fighter.  I would have expected one punch and down for the 10 count.
Lmfao. So funny
So we let the guy get away ... That happens to me the punk ain't going to get away from me. I will make an example out of him.
Is it really worth it to steal a base model civic?
dont mess with someone with cauliflower ears
This is exactly why there are state laws and cities also have ordinances that say it's illegal to leave your car unlocked and running in a parking lot while being unattended. ((Found this out the hard way!!)   North Carolina ticket bro!!  20-163. Unattended motor vehicles. "No person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle shall permit it to stand unattended on a  public highway or public vehicular area without first stopping the engine, effectively setting the brake..." The damn court fees are ridiculous!!
I wouldn’t even leave it running even if I was on mars with a honda with a flat tire and messed up Alternator
The guy left his car unlocked with the keys in it, engine running. All brawn and no brain
Good on the fighter but this was in 2021.....why would you leave the car running and unlocked with the keys in?
Not even surprised
Didn't happen to leave it unlocked with the keys in the ignition genius ? No one gets onto and drives away that fast in a late model car with no keys.
This would never happen if that car had a manual transmission
1978. Amsterdam. Dated a girl who's father "Willem" was a cab driver and was one of Dutch strongest bench presser. A "client"sitting in the back seat of his ccar tried to stab him. In that era....all cash.... Wrong cab driver... Willem explained to us comming home with bloody knuckles that he hurt the guy so bad that he had to be hospitalized. The Dutch police took his statement and gave him thumbs up. ..........in his video...a car thief.. Car engine running or not should have gotten the same faith.
what a joke
Next time, put the keys to your car into your fanny pack, mam
leaving your car RUNNING in front of a store  sheesh indeed
sheesh
Did he take too many hits to the head?!  He left his car running?! That's begging to have it stolen.
Apparently it's illegal in FL to leave your car running when you're not inside it.  I'm in a 7/11 and a female sheriff says to me "You know it's illegal to leave your car running like that?" I responded with "It's a manual transmission, no one knows how to drive one now a days." She didn't think that was funny and then I proceeded to raise my detachable steering wheel in the air and said "Can't steal it if you can't steer it."  She then laughed.  Car in story is in pfp, R1 RX-7.
Robber has to do a better marking next time, NEVER do the fanny pack men. NEVER!
ufc dude is lucky driver didn't accelerate.. the door would have messed him up bad..
Wait a minute.  This ain’t the car I wanted to steal.
Damn.. he tried jordan williams... wow.. that is a smart move
Lucky for him the owner of the vehicle was a nice person.
Stay away from the cities, only trash down there
"finally, i use my martial arts outside the ring"
Guys deserves his car stolen he wants to keep it running thats what he gets
Luckily the car thief didn't have a gun, because when you're dead, you dont need a car.
The violent cod evidently entertain because good-bye fascinatingly command amongst a overwrought sheet. maddening, wealthy foxglove
Doesn’t EVERYBODY know don’t leave your car running?????? Why would you do that even in a safe world?
Yeah but why leave ur cars open with keys inside??? Wtf
Good thing I put a kill switch on my rig.
Nobody can steal your car even if it's running AND unlocked. I mean if it has 3 pedals. P.S: this anti-theft feature only works in USA though.
The thief remembered to put the car into park before being pummeled. Note how the car didn't roll away.
Didnt flog him long enough ..
Don’t leave your keys in the car!!!  Why isn’t that a well known? It’s common sense !!!!  Well, common sense isn’t that common so …
Unlocked car and engine running!? How many times has he been punched in the head?
Same suspects in all these videos
Yes I see a lot of people leave there car's running and go in a store like it will be there when they return I also told one person that he shouldn't leave his car running and he got angry with me well he doesn't have the car anymore
Yes! He met his match, about time.
When does common sense become common!?
Do not leave your car running and this wouldn’t happen
The same Malenated Mayhem that goes on every day of the year...
You mean threw some knees
Those aren't punches, those are his knees 🤣
When I was about 6 years old my dad and I lived in Colombia Maryland. He stopped next to a pay phone to use it and when he started putting change in the machine a guy jumped into the driver seat, and I was able to jump out just in time cause I had my seat belt off. We got the vehicle back about 2-3 months later found abandoned and riddled with bullet holes.
Threw a few good punches?  My man kneed that bitch in his head a few times.
I didnthe samenthing yesterday, only I kept that fucking dude there till cops came ... beat his ass 😤 not today satin.
Best way to get your car stolen? Leave it unattended and running at a convenience store... theft guaranteed. This guy's lucky the perp didn't have a gun at the ready. Things would have turned out much different.
Roughly 90% of vehicle related thefts (whole vehicle/possessions) are from unlocked doors...
Never say Kevin Hart didn't warn you.
ALPHA & OMEGA  "To those who ask me:  "Jesimiel, do you want to join our organization?"  I reply:  "Although I admire the work that many people do behind close doors, I have to take a "more radical" approach to world change, because at its current course and state of socioeconomic disparities and worldwide injustices, things are only headed one way:  "COMPLETE" HUMAN EXTINCTION!"  Do you know how many intelligent and talented professionals, and other geniuses without formal education there are in the world, in every country!  But, human selfishness and its inability to brake free from long-held dysfunctional cultural, religious, and political stereotypes, customes, "laws", and preferences, to mention just a few, keep human beings both from evolving at an individual and spiritual scale, and also from reaching universal status at a much faster rate.  Because human beings do have the potential, but, evil has a lot of potential too, and evil loves its children and its creations too, so even the definitions and concepts of "love" itself is not enough; but there needs to also be the right "intent", the right approach, the right path, and the right inner and universal light guiding those higher forms of human ideals and ways of living, of "existential value", for "ALL HUMANS", and not for some fortunate few.  Professionals or smart people, or spiritually aware individuals all over the world are not naive, they see how the United States, China, and other world powers increase the value of national currencies to give its citizens a financial advantage, even if it means that a vast number of other countries, societies, and human beings suffer from the socio-economic injustices that keep some countries wealthy, or makes them richer, while the poor face international injustice, and as a double jeopardy of unfairness, also the national and local corruption of their political and private business sectors.  Thus, there is a dangerous inverse relationship in international affairs where while the richer countries get richer exponentially, the poorer get poorer in the opposite direction.  However, I say "richer" lightly, and as it pertains to "human ignorance", and how governments keep their citizens "ignorant" in what benefits them to "save-face", because the USA with all its wealth, has "TRILLIONS" of dollars in external debt to other countries!  HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?  Thus, I postulate and bring into action the very things that I am doing with Heaven Corporation and the like, even if I have to go against the dysfunctional human currents that continue perpetuating human suffering and unfair socioeconomic disparities, because Heaven/God knows that if nothing is done soon enough, there will be no more a usable or livable planet Earth, or Human Beings to tell the story, or any other universal species to want to allow your human evil and dysfunctions into their well-balanced existential and social systems.  THUS, CHANGE, & AND DO IT QUICKLY!

Was that the gas station from Toy Story?
the car thief shouldve been put in jail.maybe he learnt his lesson i hope
You mean unlike he did. He said he wants you to learn like he did to lock your car and never leave it running
As much I would like to say well done. I would also tell him to lock his fucking door and never leave your keys in the car. Jesus Christ!
I can't believe how many people don't lock their cars at shops and petrol stations.
Great job but he was ignorant enough to leave his keys in the car and the open?😳🙄🙄 Kinda deserves to have his car stolen!😜🤣
Lock your cars, you never know when black people can strike
*COULD HAVE SAT ON THE FOOL*
Well even if you did catch him and he was arrested the Biden administration would just release him in under three days of imprisonment.
Imagine getting beat down by a dude wearing a yellow fanny pack
Most cars have GPS it will be spotted in  hours
who is he Francis ngannnu
The would be thief was a black guy. Just saying.
How was he not able to take down the thief? UFC fighter but doesn't have the IQ to go for a takedown after landing some shots. Sad.
Look at that gass price
GigaChad
Just don’t leave it running pleaseeeeee
I like how the camera is 2 fps so you cant even see the fact that he got hit in the head. Just him running away with is hand on his head lol
Real men wear Fanny packs, lol! 😂
Thank you for getting one of them...
Not the civic
Cmon now...every boy has car jacked at least once.  Usually on the way home from the date , say around 11:01 on a Friday night
Successfully prtected his owning without a gun ???? Wow amazing, so its possbile 😂. With a gun he might have fired the car, the thieve wouldn't stop because of fear for his life. Guns aren't the solution as you can see.
You don't even need to be a UFC fighter to kick a thief's ass. Anyone who has a sense of protecting their things would do this... or at least to me anyway. 😂
This moron leaving his car running on Colfax?! Did you not notice all the bums walking around? The fact he's at a Sinclair gas station is telling enough
Who leaves their keys in a car
close a door, lock a door.
Hahaha I hate car thieves. I had my truck stolen but luckily the police found it the same day.
Good old Denver! Not the beautiful place it used to be, pretty scary these days
Let me guess, the thief is now suing him for assault...
Dude took it easy on him if it was a whitey or cop of duty they would have shot him quick
Staged? Thoughts?
UFC fighters not that smart
He kneed him twice, the thief still got lucky. Better man than me.
Couple good punches lol How about some 12-6 to the back of the head with a couple grounded soccer kicks to the dome on the way down for good measure or a couple good knees to the face lol
Baby lock them doors and turn the lights down low 🎶🎵
Commen sense... lock your doors
My dude was wearing a fanny pack 😂
At least he put it in park for him
"UFC fighter pounds car thief" poor choice of words.
Man turned the radio on and heard boss music
You know that wasn’t New York. Lol
I'm glad that thief ran into the UFC fighter. Maybe that thief will think about stealing anybody's car again.
I feel like if it wasn't for my fear of the door automatically locking itself while the keys are inside I would probably forget to lock it sometimes too
He handled that swiftly like a G
🤓- he wants everybody to learn to lock your car and never leave it running.  🥴 - duh...ok... um duh.... um....what?......duh... I got batman.                   ............GRIM
I'm surprised he can afford a car.
Shoot I wanted to see the thief get knocked out.  😕
Ha! When he said he only regretted one thing my first thought was—leaving the car unlocked? I had no idea it was still running!
You see, this is why I will never be a thief. Sure, stealing is illegal... But I also don't know the person I would be stealing from and what that person is capable of doing to me. My life motto is: never get involved in a situation where you can't resonably see or predict the outcome!
how come the thief literally turn off the engine or geared to park / neutral when getting beaten
People who leave their car running are not that smart. I don’t care who they are. If you leave your car Unintended and unlocked and running, it’s their own fault. 😁😳
Never clicked so fast 😂
why did he leave his keys in his car that was very clever yep some people never learn😁
He did the baby boy Aw comon man mah jaw hurt man
SHEESH
Imagine being this thief and imagine the driver u are trying to steal from turns out to be Khabib ☠️ u are done for lol
That’s something you don’t see every day; ufc fighter with a hip pack.
Tagged dat tater lol.
POUNDS car thief? read that title in the worst way. anyways that was entertaining
Unruly people of color, and other unruly characters, wake your head up, do the right thing🤓
I wish I could’ve apprehended them to smash their face in to purple mush
As it was said in the 🎥 "Pulp Fiction":  "What's more 🐔💩 than f***in' with another man's vehicle? Don't...mess with another man's vehicle. It's against the rules!"😆😆😆😉😉😎
One regret is wearing that Fanny pack
Never relax around...
UFC  Trust they'll be more to come because criminals think they are running things, wrong!
Is that a crime anymore???  He would be back on the streets in seconds.
Usual suspects.... It's weird how many times I can leave the same comment and it's ALWAYS true.
Looking at his ears I already knew he could fight
I have never left my car running and unattended open for whoever wants it. And I’m not from a big city just big enough to get your stuff stolen.
My only regret would have been that I didn’t kill him.  The mother fucker went down the road and did the same shit to someone else.  Laws need modified to be able to kill thieves on spot without fear of prosecution.
He's good at fighting, but very little common sense.
I see racism. The right thing to do is de escalate. Ask the perp about their hopes and dreams
But you left the car running keys  in it and door open you asked a thief to steal it.
That wasnt a beating more like pulled out perhaps punched once or twice.
Seriously figured everyone knew not to leave it running smh!
Never mess with someone wearing a fanny pack
That’s what the criminal gets👍🏻👍🏻🐰
The title is very misleading…
He said he wishes he would of caught him. Why???. In today's world he's back on street in couple hours . Giving him summer teeth would have been better.
The car thief was like “look at this mf wearing a fanny-pack I’m gonna steal his whip right in front of him and he ain’t gonna do SHIT”, Then the guy runs out and blasts him in the face with a couple of knees and he just runs off with his tail between his legs 😂.
Never mess with a man with cauliflower ears
William, you a humble guy, keep doing you my man
Kinda dumb he could have had a gun. People in San Jose die from this quite a bit every year
Let me get this straight!: "UFC fighter" left his car open with tthe key in the ignition. Okay. Seems like a cheap publicity stunt to me.
Man... look at those gas prices just a few months ago! TJB
Looked like kneese not punches
I love happy endings like this.
in the middle east shop owners just cover their goods , they dont lock the shops doors or anything and they go pray , bcs they know most of the people are god fearing or atleast are kinda modest by not stealing like cowards and no one locks their cars !   unlike the people in the west and their ,i quote "FREEDOM OF SPEECH" and all that bs !
If the guy had a knife or a gun he would probably be dead. Your car or wallet are not worth your life!
If you leave your car unlocked and running in certain areas, you can't apprehend or blame the sad opportunist for your mistake. 🧠🗝
Dumb thing to leave your car unlocked and running
What punch.
Sent that baby running holding his shit lol 🤣😂🤣
Ya gotta be careful opening the car door  of someone who is alone and on a high protein diet.
Jesus saves
Those gas prices are looking nice!
Fathers keep daughters off the pole, and sons out of jail.   First time kid was disciplined by a man.
The Thief was lucky running away crying like a girl holding his head.cage fighter should of knocked his head off.get your own dame car.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/P0hrL2ppoA0
Funny and I'm happy for him, but he could be sued by that cockroach for assault, sadly.
"it was at this moment he knew he f***** up"
UFC fighter suffers brain damage and forgets to lock car .. fortunately apprehends suspect and doesn't look like a complete dummy
so he didnt lock his car AND he left it running.....
Of course it’s the usual suspects again.  Those people are like sand in the gears of a civilized culture with their greatest contribution being the filling of affirmative action jobs.
That would NOT work  in my home of Chicago! 95-99% MMA Dude would of been Shot dead b4 he could even lay a hand on the car jacker!
His regret should be that he didn't kill him. Death to thieves!
I don’t what everyone is seeing. Looked to me that the dude just pulled him out of the car. If the thief is able to walk away then he only got smarter about doing it to someone else.
Lesson taught, hopefully lesson learned. (By both) Don't leave your vehicle running, don't try and steal someone's property unless you know for sure that you can do so.  Better yet, get a dang job and earn your own money to buy one.
With today’s price of gas, we’re all being robbed!
"a few good punches".  LOL try "knees to the face".
Good
USUAL SUSPECT.  DEMOCRATIC CRIME WAVE
Idiot left his car running at a gas station.
Never ever mess with a man that has cauliflower ears, EVER.
https://youtu.be/7K2pANwO12E
The reporter actually said "Sheesh"....awesome. You don't hear that anymore. But, who the he&& leaves their car running at a gas station?  You just know Jamal or Marquis is jus sittin there waiting.  Thank goodness for security cameras
The way he holding his head, he need some ice. 😂
H pou c pou ccg r ghb ph c ok
With the fanny pack on lmao
Threw a few good punches. Throws no punches
The fighter must’ve thought he was in Mayberry leaving his car running.
Haaa. You like.you like car.well you no gonna like what I give you..and no want car any more either. But feet will be Velly Velly good for you to use as you no want to stay here
He probably feels so embarrassed watch this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Democrats say  these people have the right to steal your car. That's why there is insurance. specially expensive insurance.
This UFC fighter has always left his car running with his keys just hoping and praying for the day someone to steal it so he can try to whoop somebody's ass this was a straight up set up like a big car but instead of catching him he wants to whoop his ass
Whoever writes the funniest reply in my comment I will cash out them $5
Don’t mess with a dude with a Fanny pack on
He's lucky that theif didn't have a gun him. Glad he regulated that fool though.
When someone's start throwing knees u know u f'd up 😂
This is justice 😊👍
Don’t put your hands anyone, especially someone with cauliflower ear. 😬
On California the owner of the car would get in more trouble than the thief. In fact it would be construed as a violation of the thief’s rights  Cheers
I love this even more because Jordan was wearing a fucking Fanny pack. A UFC fighter wearing a Fanny pack beating ass. Goes to show that looks don’t make you tough.
opens door and grabs the perp by the collar   "this.. this feel so instictual, my knees, they just move so gracefully, look"
What comes from brain goes to muscles
Not sos smart after all how about if the theif had a gun. 😅
Why the hell did he leave the car running 🤔🤔
Dude caught a couple of speed knots to the noggin'.
If you leave your car running, while you go in the store,you are an idiot. Good thing the car thief forgot his firearm, Mr. UFC would have a big ol' hole in his ass.
Kind of looks like a publicity stunt, but whatever.
How is his one regret not locking his doors and turning off the car?
Fack  +!!  Show me the police  report
newer turn of the engine
Criminals don't fear politicians ,judge's , police or jail so you must make them fear the victims. buy everyone guns !
Another piece of shit story.. its either ufc ketchup ,black belt or jiu jitsu man! Lol
He could have destroyed him. I probably would have taken his arm. Long sleeve or short sleeve? Taught him a real lesson ole school style.
Liberal black people be like 🤡
I was hoping to see some ground and pound but hey it's all good.
That's my city Denver CO Born Raised Mile High City and Atlanta GA my second home .🤑❤️💯💔😜
He tries to fight back n he will be in hell
Most aftermarket remote start systems have a cool feature where you can keep your car running, take the keys out of the ignition, and lock the car behind you. If somehow a theif manages to unlock the car, the engine dies as soon as the brake, shifter, or throttle is touched. Works awesome for leaving my dog in the car with the AC on while I go in the store.
ufc fighter drives a honda?
Why would anyone leave their car unlocked and running while inside a store? Only if a front passenger is present it is an exception to leave the car locked and running but never unlock for safety and theft prevention.
This reminds me of a time when two cage fighters in the UK wore drag costumes on a night out and got started on by a couple of homophobic guys and beat the shit out of them... Beautiful justice
People like this create thieves
Booyah 👊🏽😁
I have a AIR TAG hidden in my car😉 but still look my doors!
How difficult is it to turn the car off, take the keys with you, and lock the freakin' doors? 🙄
Should of knocked him down and let the cops do the work. He'll go steal someone else car I bet
This looks set up. I think this was a publicly stunt. Dude just got right in the car, started it up, drove slow enough for the guy to catch him, gets punched once and runs away....yeah...shady.
Did he just left the door open and the key inside?
UFC Fighter: "Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!… but not for me."
The thief put the car in park?
Look that gas price 7 months ago ;(
This one is Awesome 👍
What race is doing these crimes on a daily taking there  Reparations Keep it up Democrats
Why leave your car unattended, running and unlocked in the first place?! 🤦‍♂️
catch...kill...repeat for the next p.o.s.
Go hard
Leave your car running and unlocked you deserve to get your car stolen. He is lucky that guy didn’t run him over.
This guy is NOT a UFC fighter. He wouldn't make a pimple on the UFC fighters ass
He should regret leaving his keys in his car in the first place.
Firstly, let me say , it’s sad that I’m here and have nothing better to do than leave a comment here. Hahahah.  With that said:  IT seems strange to me that someone was holding a hand held camera ( or phone) and was ready to film this .   Secondly: IT seems funny that the , so called, thief was pulled out of the car and he decided to put the car in PARK before he was dragged out . . .  Makes me thing this entire thing was staged ~ ~ ~
Man run him over next time.
Word of advice for all you wanna be bad asses out there in case you dont already know. If you want to show off or pick a fight in anyway always check the guys ears. If you see cauliflower ear dont do it your about to get tore up. Forget size I dont care if the dude is way smaller check the ears
Gas 3.64!! Must have been a while back
😂
Staged
Like Trump fighting Biden out of office soon
I see a car running outside gas stations, I announce "FREE CAR!" to everyone  around.
People, it doesn’t take that much extra time to turn key off & lock doors. Takes more time if it’s stolen then you have to walk to store,lol.
don't leave your damn car running
Im just looking at the gas prices like 😍
How embarrassing
gas at 3.64 a gallon!! those were the days!
Imagine stealing someones car and being so unaware they run at you and rip you out when all you had to do was lock
Left his car on and running what did you expect to happen
He is lucky he got to run away 😤
God bless us all 🙏🏼❤️✝️
left it running.   must have been high on something.
Who da fook is that guy?
Hahaha the news guy said "throw hands" his home self came out for a minute.
BLACK LIVES MATTER 😂😂😂😂
Play stupid games get stupid prizes
I'm glad the situation worked out, but for future reference: If someone is stealing your car, *fucking LET THEM.*   It doesn't matter how well you can punch if the guy has a gun.
leave the car running, it runs!!!!
He should have jacked that dude up more, like beat him till he couldn't get up, thieves need to learn a lesson
He says he wishes he was able to apprehend him when it was fully in his power to do so. Hell even after letting him go, he still could've easily ran down the guy and held him for the police. This guy's as smart as a 🪨.
I'm glad he got cut from the UFC. He didn't even hold the guy for the police. What an idiot, who knows what this guy has went on to do all because he didn't hold him for the police.
I like how he was rubbing the top of his head that punch must have hurt sheesh
Wow. Do you even watch the video newscaster? Do you know the difference between throwing knees vs. punches?
Yeah that's against the law to leave your car running.......
They did a study that shows if you see a car running and open, you most likely won't take it  Statistically if you read this you, is literally you reading this lol
Stupid theif forgot to lock the door.
That's what he gets yes
What kind of car is it
Looked like he punched him once, then grabbed his head, and gave him 2 or 3 knees to the face... He was running straight to the hospital btw 🤣
God POV: Change your ways or get wrecked...
Let me guess his skin color. It's the color of all the rainbow together. Shit
Shocker someone sounding that punch drunk would leave their car running and unlocked..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I always told my son never steal from or hurt anybody you never know who your playing with. Some people are never seen again after screwing the wrong person. Which is fine with me.
Killing people is the only way to solve problems because obviously jails don’t work
Hello face meet knee
I would hope he’s not trying to steal anyone else car walking away holding his freaking head!  🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
That was he get why did,nt kick his but more
Thats all u did to him!?
Nice head kick!
Maybe he wanted someone to try to steal his car because he wanted to kick someone's ass that day.
It doesn't matter what color you are when you're a thief you should have taught him a lesson so he doesn't do it again!
Only fight this dude has won in almost 2 years 😄😄
He deserved everything that came his way.
Left his car open with the keys in it and running....🤔
I loved it!!!
This is not what I clicked on
Should’ve had fun for a while
Why in the hell would you leave your keys in your car?
Sometimes all the training which seems senseless to others just gives us a sense in a good video !
This was a REALLY GOOD SHOW AND U RIGHT ON EV.ER.RY.THAAAAAAAANG!!!!!!!!
Nice👏👏👏👍👍👍
He should’ve known better when you see the Fanny pack.
All of us do he didn't learn that less until after the fact
Look how cheap gas was then!
He’s trained to detect high scammers, his work is insanely great as if by magic, he got things done credibly... I’m forever greatful
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Liberals love to live in high crime cities
big mistake
Always music to my ear when the bad guy ass got whooped.
What a hateful society
Did the ufc fighter left the car running so he can practice his punches 😄
This is why robbing a car is a bad idea. Not every car owner is weak.
I don't understand why ppl go into convenient stores leaving their cars running.  I've seen this too many times when I go to 7-11 or circle k
If that ain’t karma ….
Bitch  Hey where is will Smith at  I need a smack down over here
That boy wanted to let go of his anger! Hahahaha good on you brother, hopefully you get the chance again. Thieves like this need to be taught a valuable lesson.
Your saying a black man tried to steal a car ,SHOCKING  !!!
This is the 2nd time I've seen a video of a man wearing a fanny pack absolutely fucking someone up, Note taken. - Do NOT fuck with Fanny pack guys.
Do you know the new invention of a brilliant tech called lock. It's magic
It is always a joy seeing a good guy beating up a bad guy. I can watch this the whole day.
If that would have happened to Conor McGregor, there would be a white chalk outline of the car thief on the ground. #ConorMcGregor
Remember, always wear your seatbelt
Freaking awesome. If you take their hand, they can't steal.   😉
Glad there was no gun involved,  fighting back is not a good idea
💯💯💯💯💚💚🌿🌱
Need to start kicking ass instead of kissing ass.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, my man knocked at the wrong door!
He must not be that great of a UFC fighter because the thief got away and he drives a Honda Civic.
Should just start hanging car thieves bet it would stop
He was too fast, I only saw him throwing one knee!
I’m actually quite surprised that the liberals didn’t label him a racist
Don’t worry he’ll do it everyday anyway.  Caught or not.  Hell he’ll probably even take someone’s life.  If he hasn’t already.
Those Dinocare gas stations always have crime going on in them
"They are literally hunting us down everyday"
Surprise the thief dident file charges
My popular answer to a question  What we The race of the suspect
CBS sucks!
Most memorable moment of this vid is the gas price @:32
All that knee didn’t knock him out lollipop
Did it hurt enough? If it doesn't belong to you, don't touch it and now you know.
Cauliflower eared professional punching bag has had too many concussions; his IQ is barely room temperature. If you don't have enough sense to take the keys out of the car, you deserve to have it stolen. I said what I said.
In today's news... UFC fighter gets assault charge for attacking a thief.
Leave your car unlocked and keys in running.......How many cage fights has this guy been in?
Dude stupid could’ve been drove off👎
Sure he's good at fighting but only an idiot would leave your car running and unlocked even for a second. Guess the fighting isn't helping his brain any...
Good with initial knees but he's not very good in the "clinch"!
Pubches? Naw more like some high knees. Prolly broke his jaw lol
Looks like man's got a few knee strikes to the head💔..Damn
BLM = Black Lies Matter!
Vote all demoRat left wingnuts out! ASAP! Vote all demoRat left wingnuts out! ASAP! Veteran-U.S. NAVY SEABEE!
If you can’t read this please thank a US Marine الله اكبر
I wouldn't call those "good punches" I the dude was able to run away lol 🤣
Man my gasprices are 409. Have a good night
That's what this clown gets trying to steal someones car! 😂😂
Suspect first thing usually a car doors lock. Second he put in park when getting pulled out car. Possibly staged
If they both had locked the doors they both could win n they both could lose. This is a win -win lose -lose situation
We just gonna ignore the news anchor saying "sheeesh"
So can you legally leave car running if you roll windows up and lock doors with spare key?hard to get a strait answer.yea I know can break window
😂💯💪
He's honestly lucky he didn't get shot.
Lesson,...turn off ignition,...lock car!  No need for anyone to get into a tussel!
Next story ufc fighter sued for protecting his property
"UFC fighter pounds car thief" uh.... Might want to change the title
YEOO... The owner lucky the thief and lock the doors !!! Word  🤔😲
Probably on Colfax lol
Why did he let the a-hole go?
Car thief:I would like to turn over a new leaf and enroll in the police academy.
Must be a manual transmission, luckily. I doubt the thief would have put the car in park while he was being ripped out of it.
Dumb and dumber.
Should be a law to cripple those thieves for life
To give you an idea of my level of paranoia, if I'm walking more than a couple of inches from my car, the doors are shut and the car is locked
That's what u get. Only an idiot would leave a vehicle unlocked and running .omg
Unlocked, Running vehicle... one guy is a thief, and the other is  Dumb. You might want to get your Brain Scanned.
Stupid car thief stupider than most stupid car thieves😂🤣
Maybe don't leave your car on or with keys inside? Is like a no brain idea bro
Always wear a seatbelt
If you're dumb enough to leave your keys in your car leave the car running and unlocked you deserve to get your car stolen.
what a powerful story. i could not lived another day without seeing it. I'm looking for a station manager position by the way.
Driver should never leave the car running ... It was declined slope.. And i was like 7 and there was no handbrake on.. And i was in front seat...   I changed the gear to reverse... And the car started sloping down.. And the highway  was just about  10 feet  away... Hopefully The drivers son pulled the handbrake immediately.. If not then phew...
Back with more sports in a moment.
Oh he's screwed
Damn that's illegal, oh wait there's no referee.
Never leave your car running and unlock. Be responsible so you dont experience this kind of shit.
7 months ago and gas was $3.64 wtf happened
Kudos to the UFC fighter. Notwithstanding leaving his car running while he was away from it 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️, he grabbed and tossed that guy (a zero in my book) out like he was a rag doll 🤣🤣.  We are all “potential victims.” Be safe everyone, it is crazier than ever as far as escalating crime.
He probably ran home to his momma holding his head crying 😂
😅
Those are some nasty knees. Oh boy running away holding his face. 🤣
I laughed when the reporter “…throw hands” 🤣
This reminds me of when some crooks tried to rob chuck norris the police were literally laughing at the thieves when they arrested them
If you see a guy with cauliflower ears getting out of a car to go into a store, you might want to pick a different car to steal.
The only pain I'm feeling is paying way above $3.64 a gallon for gas.
He didn't do schitt
Dumb & dumber... but which is which??? 😂
If this was CNN, they would say the UFC fighter was wrong for doing that HAHHAHAHHAHAH
Dumb enough to not even lock the door 🤦‍♂️
Good lesson for the thief also to lock the car he would have avoided a beat down
Good!
what an stupid man, leaving his car on and unlock.
Jordan's checklist: Always lock your car ✅  Never leave it running ✅  Wear yellow fanny pack ✅
Another upstanding citizen
Yea you can say his a real fighter.  See how quickly he hits him with Two knees to the face . But quickly stops because he remembers its a civilian . Great work and hope that thief learns to stop and every other thief out there .
Throws punches and a couple knees .  The World- Your a professional UFC fighter.
So both these men got charges right ? The thief got break and enter and the UFC fighter got assault charges right?
Idiot left his car running.
Thank God that didn’t happen in Newark, NJ. UFC fighter would have been in the morgue. Glad he’s ok. BTW, you have to have the biggest 🏀🏀 to be a Newark cop. I’m not from there neither.
Meet my little friends ( fists) ka boom * pow!  Ow ow ow!
He left his car unlocked and running?   Is this a PR video?
Self defense is more than fighting sometimes it’s as simple as taking the keys off the ignition and putting them in your pocket and then locking the car
Imagine mike tyson catching such a thief and throwing his left hook.
Apprehension does nothing. They go into an adult babysitting facility for a while and then are released back onto the public.
That's nice of the "thief" to slowly back up,  leave the door unlocked , then put the car in park.
The thief is holding his head like, “ I’m going to tell mom” 😂😂😂
How disappointing!
I think those where knees lol
Thank God up above that the theif did  not have a gun
UFC fighter is Soooo dumb . That he cut open a pineapple and said , SpongeBob! Where are you ? And forgot hes keys in the car 😑
The UFC fighter only regrets leaving the car running... what about the fanny pack?
Instant karma. But the guy is probably correct, the thief probably was stealing a different car later that day with one eye swollen shut.
EMOTIO-physical, physical damage!
The only good thief is a Dead Thief
I thought the car theif would apologize to the ufc 😕
💗💗💗💛💛💛🙏🙏🙏🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Too many fights?   What moron leaves the car parked, unlocked and the engine running??????
WHAT IDIOTS ARE LEAVING THE CAR ON AND GOING IN A STORE  YOU DESERVE TO GET IT STOLEN
don't leave your car running!    Duh... !
Did he just get his a22 handed to him by a man in a fanny pack??🤔🤔 Guess if you are an MMA fighter you can wear anything you want..
They’d just let him go anyhow
Not for you ! Don’t chase him! Let him goes
Don't worry, he would of been released within 2 hours anyway 😖
Ooops, this is the moment when he realized...." I f@cked up"
🤣😂🤣 Nice work
IF the Thief locked 🔒 🤣 the doors.. Hasta la Vista.. Joy Ride for good..
Awwwwww.  Poor baby
Nice way to get shot.
If more of people would STAND UP for what is right instead of waiting on a cop that will do no good this kind of stuff wouldn't happen as often !
Even if he apprehended the guy some liberal judge would have let the guy go because he felt sorry for him
G boys and girls. Let’s take a look at the skin color of the thief.
Im dissapointed! I expected more of beat down
Anyone who leaves they're car unlocked with it running deserves to get it stolen, stupid
It’s the real life version of when keeping it real goes wrong…..car thief edition. What 27 year old Jonathan didn’t know, was that the owner of this all to tempting running car left unattended was….
Lucky the perp placed the car in park.
That thief got off light
I thought I was going to actually see a street fight. All I saw was what anyone else can or would do. Nothing amazing to see here.
😂😂 Anchorman said “Throw hands”! I love it!
I thought he was gonna strip before going down on the guy on the ground
My personal rule is to never assume nothing bad is going to happen.
He probably a good  fighter most bad ass people are humble
This was the day that the car owner was instrumental in changing the car thiefs life! He'll thank him one day for it!
Parents ! ! ..... teach your children to fight UNARMED!  Not all confrontations require lethal force and one day they too can stand up on their own 2 feet and protect themselves and their property.
If you go in a store with your car running and unlocked outside, it's 60% your fault.
Yeah, those were knee strikes! In this case, much more effective, lol, love it!
Lock yer daggone cars, folks!
How did the theif manage to put it in park as he was getting pummeled before running away like a man on fire? My doors automatically lock when the car is in gear..
Bravo to you
I literally left my car running, ran in the house and came out and saw this.
Lol.
One of my coworkers had his car stolen from the parking lot at work. Turns out he's been leaving his car unlocked with the keys under the seat for years and was actually surprised that it was stolen.
Let that thief have the car.  The UFC fighter could have gotten dragged and killed if that car hadn't stopped or shot if that thief had a gun. Let it go and make an insurance claim.
In many or most states its illegal to leave a running unlocked car unattended............
Lol.  You said pound I was expecting more than 1 punch
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best story I’ve seen in a while. Very satisfying
This is fake that door was closed and the car was moving the door was locked this is fake
Great job there should be plenty more of that going on now a days
It's ok to steal cars in the new biden world. Dems are scum
I wish you would have beat his ass bro for real but good job on the self control ur a better man than me I would of caught a case if I caught dude stealing my car
looks like 2 knees to the head and that was that
This is why you don't leave your car running. People are stupid.
Apparently all muscle and no brains... good for him for stopping the carjacking but it's his fault it happened... He should be grateful he couldn't apprehend the guy, If the cops would have showed up they most likely would have ticketed and arrested him as well... for leaving his car running and unlocked, assault and  for forcibly detaining an individual against their will....
😂😂😂
Dumb and dumber!
id like to see some neck breaking men..
🚘🚗⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
Invest in a car with a proximity key fob.. you can leave your car running and lock the doors and even if someone still manages to get into the car they can't go anywhere without the key.. Game changer 💯
Should be legal to shoot car thieves.
best fanny pack anti-theft device money can buy.
It's dumb enough to leave your door unlocked, but to leave it running takes a special kind of moron.
some scumbags will make the thief sound like a victim
If he left it running out side a store and went inside the store , he is the most stupid person on the planet, it very stupid to lever your car running and getting out of it is a piece of bait for people to steal it lolol thanks BigAl California praise Jesus grace Christ amen
Is that a Fanny pack?
That's hilarious 😂😂
Why did you leave your KEYS in the car?
😱 He was an old man running away like a little kid holding his head saying  mommy mommy he hit me he hit me 🥴
Even if this UFC fighter managed to hold him until Police could arrest him, it wouldn't really matter. This dirty fucker will be back out stealing cars in no time. We treat car theft like a joke in this Country. Car thieves should be hanged, just like horse thieves in the Old West.
That is so cool, job well done, punk is seriously wondering about skills now, LMAO.
Nephew got some of that act right. Prayerfully nephew won't attempt to steal anything else. This could have been a lot worse 🤔 Lord bless this young man with gainful employment. Forgive him for he no not understand. In Jesus name I pray, Amen 🙏🙏🙏 🙏
He only regrets one thing, and that's the price of gas. Fjblgb
either way you look at it,  don't be a dumb a**
All thieves deserve a beating
UFC Fighter left the Car Open & Running?!
Lol what a unique experience being kneed in the head by a ufc fighter while seated in a rolling car.  He is probably the only person in the history of the planet to have this experience.
Do NOT mess up with an MMA fighter!
You missed, , giving him a broken bones before he run away.
Bet that guy isn’t out stealing cars today! Bet he has ice pack on one end & heating pad on another.
New Zealand Boxer David Tua, in his mother's Mercedes had the car running to pop into a shop and that too got stolen.
🤣😂😃👍🏿Did ufc fighter leave the car running while in the mini mart store?  he's looking for a street  fight.
Praying this guy repents and gets caught. Jesus help.
The theif is lucky the fighter didn't go rage mode....
UFC fighter is the only man that can wear a fanny pack and get away with it
The driver is to blame for the thug stealing his car, because he didn't lock the doors.
In Australia it's a crime to not secure your car
these days everybody is a ufc fighter .... makes a better story
leaving your keys in the car running is a sign of arrogance that could get a child killed  at worst in a high speed pursuit. Next time take your keys with you tuff guy.
It was a black guy stealing his car? ... shocking
such wise common sense thanks
Amazed the car owner wasn't arrested and jailed in this bizarro American social justice we live in now. He'd be charged with "tempting theft" by leaving doors unlocked and battery.
Lovely
What is with peoples obsession with leaving you car running while you go to convenience stores! Turn the shit off and lock it. Literally saves no time whatsoever in leaving it on. Y’all make it to easy for anyone to steal it.
DUMBEST SHIT!!! Why do people Create such GREAT OPPORTUNITIES for Thieves??? 🔑🔓🚙
Everyone and their cousins momma is a UFC fighter lololol
Stupidity in motion.  unlocked car with engine running.  you deserve what you get
How lazy can you get?  Bet he didn’t want to go through the trouble of turning the key off just because he knew that he was only going to be 5 seconds and didn’t want to go through the hassle of reinserting the key and turning on the ignition. I know people that lazy.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏. People bless you. Thank you 😉
He’s lucy the jacker wasn’t strapped.
👁
Why would you leave keys in your car?
And what did we learn today?
Hilarious 😆
Lets go brandon
I never leave my car unlocked. Especially at the gas station.
Since when is throwing a guy out of your car considered "pounding" him?  The real story here is why is the media SO FULL OF SHIT!!!!!!!!!!
jajajaja =D LOL I am not sure who learned a lesson in this case LOL
Dude didn’t Throw a single punch what are you talking about
Gas prices sky-high and people still leaving the keys in the car
The way that thief walks away with his hand on his head 🤣🤣
Love to see it!
A good way not to get fucked up by a ufc champ?. Only rob drug dealers not normal people.
Good for him but Kevin Holland is a thief/gunman stopping beast.
dude says ganked 0:23
UFC fighter:  “I wish I could have held him there longer, not to hurt him more......”  😂🤣😂😂😂🤣
😂😂😂
Hey the carjacker handed the car owner the can opener when he thought he would get some caucasion dudes mild ride...owner said hey thanks for the can opener looks like you are gonna be getting not one but 2 double knuckle sandwiches and a side of whop ass
Wowww look at that gas price. 😍😘
Wait a second here, U mean the perpetrator was blk..? 🤔 No fn way!🤣 Stop white hate now, plzzz America! Media is the Virus! Plandemic is real...
Sadly folks don't know their rights. As a citizen you can absolutely effectuate a citizens arrest on a perpetrator whom you personally visually witness committing an active felony. In this instance the felony being committed would be automobile theft. Plain and simple. Know your rights folks.
That's what u get fucker for leaving it running and unlocked
He's right. *You gotta stop them before they do it again.* Ask *_Michael Bisping._*
Typical Tyrone
You should of taken him to his mama or dad house and gave him a ass whoopin
Too cool!!!🤩
Leaving it running.... 👌
🤣🤣🤣
You know the ufc isn't paying enough when their fighters are rolling around in hondas
I have my dog in my truck and no one and I do mean no one better not stick their hands inside the truck! LMAO! A few must not hear to damned good because he bloodied their hands!
Doh!
Well he not a ufc fighter anymore lol
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Same thing happens all time but heat of moment make you reactions to stimuli bring out first fight flight.Even though you got control in a  split you did the only thing you sensed strong Dominance and superior intellectual reasoning rap up in you.Keep that reasoning when facing all challenges.
Like my car? Ok, lets go for a ride, you sit in the trunk. 😏
Were you purposely appetising a thief; leaving a car unlocked, with the keys inside,  or, the thief is infact your friend, and you were shooting a movie? Who was doing the shooting of the video, and how was he ready?.... Lastly, your surveillance camera is very active. Tracking the picture up and down, following the car's movements and stopping as the car stops.  CONGRATULATIONS.  Where can I purchase one camera that kind?
lesson for drivers: buy a gun and get a ccp
Jordan makes a Fanny pack look good 😬
and if he had injured the carjacker here comes the lawsuits
Staged as hell. C'mon, man!
Looks like that fighters nose was broken a dozen times
Lol punches. He kneed him in the face
U pick the wrong one, did see that coming when U woke up did Ya😂😂!!!
He is supposed to be a trained UFC fighter and regrets that he did not restrain the guy?
Surprised the guy stopped
Moron did it to himself leaving his car running
Pretty sure I havnt seen him in ufc these are so stupid
Instant justice
😂😆😂
Stealing is a Life Mistake! Stealing a MultiDiscipline Fighter's car is a Bigger Mistake!
I didn't see him pound nothing...just some hugging..lol... I would have beaten the thief to a inch of his life...
Shoulda beat em
Memo to bad guys: Try being good...you may be surprised how well you will be treated ...
Hurray!!!
i sAW NO PUNCHES..WTF
go go ho lbm . . . .i mean lbm
That MMA fighter should have broken one of that bastards arms. He could easily do it and put out of commision for awhile.
Dummy left the car running ???  Who does that!?!?
Prob shouldn’t leave car unlocked with keys in it !!!🙄
Ah come on he needs more damage !!
0:30 yeah...back in Aug 2021.....PUTIN did that....Sure idiots. $3.64..
Good outcome but in Chicago they all have guns.
Regardless. We all need to unwoke AND FIGHT WHEN NEED BE
He could have gotten sued for a fractured skull!!!
MMA fighter my ass nothing but a big p**** if you ask me
People leave cars running as an arrogant challange. It never ceases to amaze, when stories emerge of ppl taking them up on it!
The thief's skull broke easier because it was basically empty in the first place. The owner should've beat the living hell out of him.  It would've done the thief some good.
stupid thief should of locked the car as soon as he got in it.ufc fighter could not hold the thief.poor fighter.
Good for him . POUND the criminals.
Should’ve done more damage. He wouldn’t be out there doing shit today if you did. Right? Instead…he escaped and has already stolen more people’s cars/possessions.
Joe Rogan coming out of nowhere- OHHHHHHHHHHH HES HURT, HE TAGGED HIM
Stupid is as stupid does.
If there was ever a time a fighter should be allowed to use his skills, that was it. I think a complete devastating beat down should be allowed.
WTF! Do you mugs never take your keys out of your cars and THEN lock them? This ISN'T the Wild West - and cars certainly AREN'T horses!...
Would be more fun if the car thief was killed. Lesson learned.
It’s crazy how I still see a few people at the gas station parked in front with their car unlock and engine on. I always lock my door even if I’m pumping gas
Should have brayed him
Those are called knees
Good . He should have put him in the hospital..
And to top that off gas is $6.47 a gallon here in California. I would like to throw a few punched at the powers that be who are ripping us off!! 😡
2022 You Don't know? Lock your 🚗 and Don't leave it Running.
Well sadly his lesson is also the thief's lesson to. He will probably start carrying a weapon now, since stupid people dont generally change, rather double down!. Glad this guy didnt get hurt and saved his own day for sure tho.
Poor car jacker, He was only stealing because he's poor and hungry.  -Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
He didn't do shit to the thief. Watch the video and tell me where this is some kind of beatdown. Were all a little disappointed. Classify this as fake news.
This most b an American thing as in Britain we never leave our keys in the car we lock it when unattended..
What? He didn't get cancelled for that? Didn't he realize that guy needed his car more?
Oh how that $3.64 look so good right now.
Just natural selection. Too many people think the odds of it happening to them is low. Never drop your guard. Next guy might have a gun or he runs your ass over!
That clip wasn't worth looking at
Ty
Prejudiceo man! Yoh! ✊🖤♣BLM! Real true race that has been persecuted!!! Called "N" word, whiped and sleeved. Axe u knoe other race had it harder. Kepen it real 🎧🎤with Rev Al Sharpton 1380 WAOK. Rest that isn't black can f*** themselves!! Al Sharpton said we are true chosen people. 🏴🇿🇦⚫ Jews or Native Americans had as hard as true chosen people us Black People!!! Yoh check out Roland S. Martin, kepin real yoh. Where it's black and real knoe what im saying?!
😂😂😳
Wish fighter would have knocked him out so hard the CRIMINAL would have never come to, problem solved!!!!!
I would not be dumb enough to leave keys in running but then put 2 9 mm in dude
What color was the thief ?
That's a lesson I learned without having to go thru all that.
That's staged bs.
Fake video. You can clearly see he doesn't take the car out of reverse.    Also driver would have stepped on it instead of stopping.
Teach you to park in front of 7-11 with your engine running.  See this 5 times a day in PG County; and all of them have their radios full blast.  I wish they’d all get jacked.
First of all, never leave car running. Second , would have paid to see driver kick the guys ass!
Never mess with someone with cauliflower ears
those were knees to the face, not punches sir
Good for him! Kudos!
Maybe you convinced him to change his career to a legitimate one and probably saved his life good work!.
Well, if America stops sending their trash to China, I would expect some of the trash to fall off of those ships. Why is America even do this?
He should've known better than to keep his car door unlocked in the socioeconomic factor part of town.
what's the matter UFC fighters can't run? run that little prick down, and then bitch slap him a few times...he'll do it again,
Good job bravo.
Nothing like seeing criminals get what they deserve
Fight back 🇺🇸
I was told, even as a kid, to always assume that there is at least ONE thief hanging around a gas station (and other places), just looking for an opportunity.
If you leave your car running, unattended, insurance won't cover it if it's stolen and the police will write you a ticket for abandoning a running motor vehicle.  Happened to my sister-in-law, in Baltimore, when she ran into a 7-11.
This video could have been so much better!!   Lol
LoL kickin' ass while wearing a yellow fanny pack
h/t MK
Looks staged...Car doors automatically lock when put into gear.
Hey the guy is smart enough to cover his face with his hand. However they have his dna in his hat so.
They the cops aren’t going to keep thief 10min. Been no ce if u beat the shit out of him
Meh... Fighter looked weak... The thief shouldn't of been able to walk away
No punched. Look at the video on slow. A struggle to unseat him, and he ran away. No need to embellish the story.
And that black man is going to blame white ppl for getting fucked up lmao always thinking you deserve other ppls shit
CNN communist news network ABC Americans broadcast communism NBC nationals broadcast communism CBS communist broadcast service npr national Pravda radio New yuck times.....
Lmfao 🤣😂, Oops
The would be car thief is lucky he didn’t get pummeled.
Only an idiot would leave a car running and unattended.
Get a job
He let him walk away?  That's no good, that thief should have permanently lost the use of his arms.
There are some folks that it just doesn't pay to piss off. Mr. Thief met one of the nicer ones. Lucky day Mr. Thief, lucky lucky day.
Lmao 🤣😂, Oops !!
That is  a B/S videolook at clothes when he comes out of store ( full length pants) wheh he gets out of car shorts & a fanie pac , B/S💥💥
Hahahaha
Did you see those gas prices
He only learned he needs to go steal another car. He's been caught a few times before, but liberal judges keep letting him off easy...
I can’t believe he’s black
🤣
Nothing like a knee in the face to help change your mind
He'll be going to jail for assault soon.  Everybody knows it was the other dudes right to steal that car and because the owner was in no danger he will be charged with multiple felonies.
The guys racist
Deport to Africa!!
Lesson for Drivers, take your keys and lock your door s
Jordan: (punches thief) Thief: ouch! Mommy!!!!!!
People like this need to be taken within 1 inch of their life.......and that may change their outlook...
How could he be so bad at letting him go
Damn white supremacist out there stealing cars and dragging old ladies to death! Lmfao.     White supremacist are sure getting a lot of sun these days. Harris and Biden said they are the biggest threat to America. We all see that was a talking point for elections
Very Good!...  4953 🐄🦉🏴‍☠✝
Looks like he just drug him out of the car.
When stealing a car a dumbass left running always lock 🔐 the door
Wow I’ve never just left the keys in my car in my life.
He ran home crying to his momma!😂
In Florida, if your car gets stolen like this, keys still in the car. You're at fault and can be cited.
The only way I’m leaving a car unlocked and running is if people or a guard dog are inside 😂 you don’t do that shit in da bay!! Glad it worked out. Smart dude for using “enough” force to make a point. I like that energy!
After gaining contol of the criminal he allowed him to leave so he can perpetrate a crime on someone else. Most states allow for a citizens arrest for a felony and this would be a prime example.
Make your day too?
Did TV 17 allow sound?..Nah..so, this sound tape jus' came: 'Yo, ya' like yer' yap? Ya' like yer' perp toofs? Here, see if a pummel to yer' pie-hol' helpn' yer' dentals..Biff! Bam! Wallop!..Tha' better?..now GIT!
Should have beat the guy until he couldn't walk, then call the cops to cart away the carcass. Would have served him right. Lol....
It's a good thing he let him go or he might have faced more charges than all the criminals out there.
Nice fanny pac
Oh well.... Hopefully the creep doesn't try it ever again.
First time a man put hands on him might as well call him daddy now boy Bwhahahaha taught him a lesson Bwhahahaha
The thief wasn't ready to rumble.
Yea 👍🏼👍🏼
I was sincerely hoping he would beat that creep mercilessly and into unconsciousness.
don't mess around with fanny packers
Yes, he means more damage lol. As he should 🤣
No brains meets no brains, escape from certain beat down guaranteed.
I'm a UFC fighter, nobody would dare steal my budget car. oh... he doesn't know who owns this car, that's it.
Instant karma baby!
pretty weak effort = you let him go = ever heard of a head lock ! = or scared he had a gun ? any way he is free to reoffend ! thank`s UFC pro ? i doubt it !
Williams is under the illusion that the police and court system would have done something to correct the thief's behavior . 😂 The only thing that thief Might learn from is if you put a rear naked choke on him and didn't let go.
Wonder which one is stupid? The  Thief or leave your car running.
Should have restrained him until the police arrive because he will be doing again very soon.
When the police ask him to identify the crook during a identification parade, the UFC fighter said he cant identify him cos the crook look different before his face got smash up. So they gave him another 6 months for him to do another identification so the crook face can look more normal like before. Lol... However after 6 mths the UFC said he cant remember how the crook looks like but he remember how his smash up face looks like. So the police let him smash up the crook face n the UFC fighter was able to finally recognise him n say YES THATS THE SMASH UP FACE I REMEMBERED ...ITS HIM!
Seen women do it,martial arts fighter?the guy stopped.
I love it when the good guy wins!  Yay!
That's it?  You should have gave him a beat down.  Ok I know you would have went to jail for  him stealing your car stupid me.
Why you let him go?.
Kiss the knee
Love it!!!!!
Too bad he didn’t break the thief’s arm or a few fingers.
One knee.  No punches.  Lucky he didn't get run over.
Darn racist ufc...your supposed to let him steal ur stuff....rite nancy??,biden,harris..etc...rite??
A few good punches, my granny could of done better.
Honestly this guy's an idiot for trying to stop him. The thief  could've pulled a gun out.
Roger that!!!
I never understood why people leave the car running.    Whatever yall think ur saving/doing,....isnt worth the risk of losing ur car, which could have a dog, or gun, or other valuables in it.
Good job I hate thirves
Robber used Thief. It had no effect . Fighter used Ass Kicking. It's super effective!
He got in a few good punches there, literally watch his knee lift three times. At least my eyes work 🤣
Those were knees
That was dumb. This UFC fighter could be dead if the guy had a gun.
Toxic masculinity at it’s finest. 😂🤣😜
You did the right thing to let him go, let that “foo walk on”
3.64 for gas...ahh...the good ol days
did he actually  leave his car running  with the door  not  locked  ,not very  smart
Never mess with a guy wearing a FANNY pack....
The thief should have locked the door. Lol
He let him go he will victimize more people. He should knocked him down and call the police
Good job young man
The idea is not to leave the keys in the ignition , sorted . .
What an idiot….the fighter I mean. Who leaves their car running? What’s next? Is he going to leave me good advice not to leave my child in the car too?
He didn’t had enough training during covid, so he baited his new sparring partner, if you can manage to take my car while I’m beating you too a pulp, you can have it, but if you can’t handle it, you lose the prize.
leaving the car running and unlocked = no insurance.
absolute carelessness leaving the engine running, unlocked and walking away.......you are just asking for it
Same old, same old….
Leaving your car running while your in the convenience store went out with the 70's. Young thug wannbes wouldn't have dared stealing someone's car back then. It's a whole different world today.
He didn't kill it. Pffffft.
🇺🇦🇺🇸➖🚫🇷🇺🍆💩
Where’s the outrage, why isn’t blm doing something about this
He leaves his car running and the door unlocked. It all worked out (except for the perp). That is something I've just never thought to do. Unlocked and running. I live in NYC and that means don't give anyone half a chance. Peace.
Good for him! 🥊  Good thing he didn’t get charged for punching the thief!!
The fighter must be brain damaged to leave a car running when you go into a convenience store. That's like putting a big sign on your car saying: STEAL ME! I've been around convenience stores enough that I'm amazed how many people leave their cars running.
THE KEYS BELONG IN YOUR POCKET! NOT IN THE CAR, Besides I was a combat medic in 1968, trained in hand-to-hand combat, the thief wouldn't have walked away unharmed. HE WOULD BE ON THE GROUND WAITING FOR THE PO-LICE!
Really? The lesson the news station takes from this incident is to “lock your car and never leave it running?” How about “don’t try to steal other people’s cars!”
Leave it running?  Guess professional fighters have taken one to many blows to the head.
Crying to his buddies
Pretty dumb to leave your keys in the ignition with the engine running in the first place, UFC fighter or not.
Man, please! Had that been me, I would have done everything possible to this POS thief to ensure he never tried this again!
Just a shame he got away before getting a proper kicking and then getting locked up for good measure.
I enjoy seeing bad people get HURT!!
Leaving his car unlocked and running (polluting), how dumb can you be, he deserved to lose it.
what pain, all i seen was the so called fighter, throwing the fool out of the car, and the fool run off,   no blows thrown,,fighter is a puss-.
"In Colorado, it's illegal to leave your car running unattended – a fact that roughly 44% of Colorado residents don't know. While cars left running with the keys in the ignition are the primary target for car thieves, it's illegal to leave your car running even if you use a remote starter."
He should have regretted leaving his car running.
Another black man trying to steal a car. When are we going to ship these guys to a foreign country ?
Door unlocked with keys inside. Good fighter, dumb as shit.
Left his car running.  Hmmmm.
Why was the key in the car?
0:44 the sheesh 😭 these adults need to stop watching tiktok
....wish I'd apprehended him, not to do more damage😉😜
Good job next time lock out the loser
Good fighter, not a bright guy. lol
As he runs off holding his forehead 🤣
$3.65 a gallon ..... I hope you filled up your car ;-)
Amazing story but, did Anyone else see that gas sign 3.64 :/
Wrong,  you let him go. You think you taught him a lesson?  Yeah, always lock the door. He'll be stealing a car later that same day.
Jesus who ever leaves a car running, your asking for trouble!
Fanny pack?
What's the point of a recording if y'all don't even know what you're watching?!  Those are knee strikes, not punches.  Psssssssssshhh.  Unreal!
See kids. Ya never know who you're screwin with on the street. Leave other people's things alone.
Jordan could've caught him and held him for cops to deal with.
Young fighter had the right idea to detain him, too bad the thief would have just been released on his OR with no real consequences in that city...
you should have beat him a little bit more for good measure make the guy think twice about trying to rob someone's car again
Always lock your car.... which the thief didn't do either..... bahahaha smackdown!!!
Damn it, woulda LOVED to see the fighter get to wail on that Thief for a bit before he got away, or pin him to the ground and ground-and-pound his ass like you see on TV, fuck thieves, but also fuck car thieves in particular.
Thank you sir for giving him a little attitude adjustment, stellar!
why do ppl dont lock their cars?
Moran left it running
But leaving the keys in the car tho?🤦🏿‍♂🤷🏿‍♂
Maybe he does this as a side hobby, but he only releases the footage when they survive or he elects to allow them to be apprehended by police.
Unlocked and running car = lazy and stupid.
Thieves should get beaten, but I didn’t see any big shots landing there... If you want to fight crime, first off deny the criminal any opportunity. Fight it every time. Press charges and Sheppard the case through the system.
That Fanny pack😂
He need a half gallon of milk Punched him into afternoon
I mean, you basically gotta a a UFC fighter to think that you can leave your car running and run in the store right quick.
left your car running? big dummy
Ouch my knot😭😂🤣
Did he really just say "throw hands" on the news? Is that what is passing as proper English nowadays?
That's a cherry on the sundae
What a poor fighter..
My Mean ass dog is usually in my running car...you know she likes the AC...had one homeboy try it and he ran backwards out of his pants ( sagging) then the shoes...I laughed my ass off...My Dog never left the truck...Good Girl
Them knees were more then the punches I like it karma baby karma I keep like good F that lol🤦‍♂️
The only cars I have that are unlocked are rusted out firebirds in my field lol my other cars stay locked even for a 2 second trip to take a leak
How you gone regret that,  but not regret turning of your engine for a few minutes and let it rest while you make your stop 🤦🏽‍♂️
he ran off lookin like deebo just stole the chain his grandmama gave him.
Awesome
UFC fighter's fault for leaving his car running. He could get a fat ticket for Puffing. The Thief is in the right, not in the wrong.
0:43 reporter really said "sheesh" might aswell have added "its buzzin' on g okurrrr". Jeeze lol
He could of hurt him so much worse and really fucked his world up. That man is disciplined. And for the record that fool didnt run away, that man let let him go.
the car didnt continue to move after the guy got out. He put it in park rather than trying to drive off ?
never mess with a man in a fanny pack
I didn't see any punches thrown.
Reasons why I always keep my key on me and lock my car doors every time.
YOU NEEDED TO DO MORE DAMAGE. A LOT MORE SO HE NEVER DOES IT AGAIN
He's Ok 😂
Instant karma lmao 😂
Knees? And this guy was never in the ufc 😂
Don't you regret leaving your keys in there
He could of put him in the hospital if he wanted hahaha
UFC. Unheard of Fighting Championship.
The title for this should be: 'UFC fighter leaves car running outside gas station and...' What do you think is going to happen?
When he trying to kick thief from the car like a cj when stealing car lol in gta 😂
When the robber got punched, I wanted to hear Joe Rogan screaming  .............. "HE'S  HURT  !!!!!!!!!!!    HE'S HURT !!!!!!!!!!"
I remember a time where you could leave in peace not having to worry that someone will steal your car. I believe that was before cars were invented.
How dumb can you be? Left the car unlocked and running? What, did he also leave $100 on the dashboard and his laptop in the front seat?!?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
only a UFC fighter with BD would leave their car running alone ourside a gas station
You know if you see someone rockin that fanny panny like a champ you better behave
And people says white people racist
sheeeeesh
So the dumb guy left his keys in the car.
Denver is no different then any other city, money or not.  Don't be comfortable anywhere!
Waste of time. You can't see the damn video.  Make yr text smaller.
Learn to not leave your keys and car running? What era are you on I’m confuse
If the dumbass wouldn't have left his keys in the ignition maybe he wouldn't have to get the POS out if his car  .
oh look another jogging individual. remember to NEVER give these things jobs.
Watch out at all times,you always have to be prepared to fight.
all muscle no common sense
I'm not sure who was the most stupid in this scenario.
I once watched two drug addicts try to rob a black guy in Glasgow.He kicked their asses.He was taking part in the world karate championships!After he walked off I walked by the two guys groaning in agony on the ground and said”You won’t be doing that again,will you?”It kept me smiling for days after!
Take that add hole
Now people know him
Disappointing the thief survived.
A knee to the head
Couple months later  black guy sued 🤣🤣ufc fighter and gets enough money to  to buy a car
That guy got off too easy…the pain was real I know, but he deserved a little more, imo.
Why didn’t he lock the door?
This looks like a GTA SA car jack scene
He was lucky. Had he hurt the guy, the DA would have charged him with felony battery. DA would claim that leaving the car unlocked and running was proof that the owner was baiting the criminal so he could beat him.
I'll leave the CRV on when I go into Wawa for two minutes but not with my keys/wallet/phone in it!
You only regret one thing ? How about not leaving the keys in the ignition. That could at least get the number 2 spot on that short list.
Dumb fighter, just learned to not leave his car running and unlocked. Smh what a nimrod!!!!!
Instead of getting 1 punch in maybe next time he could land 200
For one he wasn't trying to jack the car he just wanted the money he was owed so word of advice to dealers out there be careful sometimes your clients will get you
Really see any punches but I did see a couple of knees to the face
Them Kangs.
Trust me this was better than him losing his freedom
Leaving your car  unlocked and running is not car theft, it’s a donation.
Ganked him !
i see man with cauliflower ears i run and not look back
Lucky for the owner that the thief was not arrested.  Otherwise, the owner would be in jail now.
Whenever a local news station gives the broadcast: prepare to be disappointed‼️    God forbid they show something that they believe general public can't handle‼️
All I can say is wow you left your car running and unlocked 😑???wtf
You need JESUS. Pray to HIM, HE loves you.  When you die as we ALL will soon. 99.9 sooner than they think 🤔 ..you will kneel before JESUS. Romans 10:5/10. The One and only true Son of GOD Almighty, all others are false..we are all sinners and need JESUS.  JESUS was crucified on the cross at Calvary and then on the third day rose again, for you and I (John 3:16). So, Choose this day whom you'll serve. For if you don't it will be chosen for you and that is HELL   Arguing with me is silly at best. Bc I'm just the messenger.. Please call . 83.For.Truth.☎️ right Yes.🤔🤗😁 Amen.... And .. Hallelujah
People do that all the time because they are nonchalant towards danger. People do that shit in the suburbs mostly some in the city. They probably got that top a 1 insurance. But im like fuck that no one taking my shit. Insurance alone even if it's top tier. It still pays to use a club on your wheel and lock your door and turn off the engine. Common sense. Crime does not have a conscience. It doesn't give a shit where your from
Williams knew if he did any further damage the corrupted system would of took him to yell instead
In the uk he would have been arrested for daring to tackle the thief..
Who has a car that still uses a traditional key?
Wow...lock your car and never leave it running. Imagine that.
Play stupid games get stupid prizes
Great story but i think the guy had a few too many blows to his head why would you leave your doors unlocked and car running ever?
Every thief thinks they’re a hard ass until they rob the wrong person.
Joy ride 10 feet pain for life.
Leave your car running....never thought a UFC fighter as too lazy to push a button to turn off your car.  Those silly, complicated buttons. 🤪
That’s trill homie
This was not smart on the owner’s decision. If buddy was really wit it.. He would’ve shot the shit out of him. I can see if he ran out with a strap.. Already on him before he tried to open the door.. But just hands..?? Real lucky.
If the thief had used common sense and locked the door he would have gotten the car and been out of there without getting punched a few times.
See? The answer is martial arts, not buying a gun
Yup I always turn off my car no more taking chances or caring if it wastes gas turning it back on! Just do it ppl!
Dangling the carrot 🥕  Will Potentially, spíLL one’s Claret •☂️
0:25 FAKE as F*.... The car would've NEVER stopped.  It go put into "Park..."  it would've been rolling forward or backward.
If you leave your car running, you deserve to have your car stolen as a stupid tax.
This is exactly why you order the manual transmission. Most theives can’t drive it.
The title of the story should be, Only IDIOTS leave their unlocked car running unattended while shopping.
“Sheeeesh”
Didn't lock the car AND left it running.... OK! Sometimes you can't help but root for the criminal!
My guy pulled a GTA on him
The 2020 election was rigged.
He'll get sued ...... lose his car and end up in jail
The only thing the ufc fighter missed is the thief was actually Dana’s valet parking attendant. now he’s waiting for his charges for assault with a deadly weapon :)
🤣
Plot twist: He intentionally left the car that way so he can pound anyone who'd take the bait cause he's thirsting for blood as there's no UFC cause of the pandemic lol.
Always remember if they got cauliflower ears, walk away 🤣
the owner left his door unlocked and his keys in the ignition.  Bad idea.  Do better next time by removing keys and locking doors regardless of how long you think you will be gone.  It only takes a few seconds for a punk to steal your vehicle.  Gotta say, it did me good to see the stupid thief get his comeuppance and experience some first hand consequences.
I guess the fighter is only good at locking heads, not car doors!
Staged AF
Looks Fake - why is a dumpy gas station camera zooming in, and tracking with the car as if someone is monitoring it.
Why he left his car open with the key on it?
BLM ✊🏿
Reckless thief
0:44 That's Right ........          Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Lazy
verdict: dude's tough enough to wear that fanny pack
...in addition to a beat down the thief won't forget -  it was saved for posterity...and no one will forget...ever...
...most interesting aspect of that was the green Sinclair Brontosaurus logo - I'm almost 72 and haven't seen that in about 58 or 60 years!!!

https://youtu.be/4H_ZMZkkKeY
Took too many hits to the head. Don't leave your keys in the car with it running
This is why police in some states actually will ticket you if you leave your car running.
Note to car owners: Lock the doors. Note to car thieves: Lock the doors.
Too many blows to the head during some of those matches huh.......who the hell leaves their car running with the doors unlock ....REALLY!!!🤣🤣
Wonder how the thief got the keys?
To many hits to the head or he would know to take his  🔑 with him. On the other hand good job 👏
I'm sry but we should be able to live in a society where I can leave my car and home unlocked ......dont make excuses for scumbags
Why do my American friends leave keys in the car and leave it running?  We hardly ever do this here in the UK.  I don't get it.
Mans ran like a little kid when they get hit on the head from something they made fall of them lol
😂 Dude was holding his head in pain as he ran away 😂😂
never fight a man with califlower ears
Take your keys out of the car, turn off long contact mode to eliminate thefts!! Come on people think 🤔
"not to do more damage" Bro you should have done a lot more damage
Never lock a convertible they'll cut the top off
Interesting how someone was taping the whole thing zooming in and out. Wake up people
The news ancor said SHEEESH😂
When the car is in reverse or drive how does it go all of a sudden to Park? The thief had to press on the brake and put in park.
When you think you’re untouchable you do stupid things. This ufc guy was stupid.
0:43 did people really say sheesh like that before tiktok
Better this gentleman than some others. Some others are a little to old to scuffle about. They just would have called the coroner to him. 😉
Lucky that he did not choke him inside the car
ALL CAPS 🧢
Why is violence always the answer. You don't know his backstoey what if that car was a way to feed his family or go to work? He had insurance there's no need to be violent
Dude!  That is funny!
Little known fact you can keep your car extra safe by locking the keys inside the car when your gone
😂dude left rubbing his head! but seriously dont be stupid and leave yr car running at a store! not this day&age..jeez
do people not know how to lock they doors when doing to a gas station?
I didn't see any punches thrown like he said.
Looks like a couple of knees to the head first. Then a couple of shots. And then.....  Thief running away holding his head. The end.
😂
Come on he dragged him out the car ...me im not letting that fucker go till i see blood.
the thief got off way too easy. Tomorrow he will be trying to steal again. He will just pick a weaker person.
You have to be completely insane to leave your car unlocked and running anywhere these days
🤣🤣🤣
Car thief got what he deserved.
Well that's what he gets for leaving it running.
Lock your cars and don't keep it running while unattended. I glad that low life thug didn't get his car. People need to work like anyone else, get their own cars. That's why they always end up in jail because they're always up to no good.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love it!!!!! Broke ass peon
How about take your keys out and lock your car? You know, common sense.
My man over here has the caveman face, you know he can take a hammer to the face and not flinch
Jordan used to be my neighbor he is such a nice guy!
Always good to see one of those disenfranchised folks get what they deserve.
"trhows a couple of good punches..."  *Literally knees to the face
Also lesson for UFC not locking the an let the still running . Bottom line is car owner not very smart
Racist, clearly this is a white supremacist harming a person of color.  When do the riots start?
Ok, gas hasn’t been $3.64 a gallon in California since 2019.
Mash he should have best the brakes off dude. That’s such a violation to think you’re entitled to something that belongs to someone else.
leaving your car open, ignition on... LOL how clever
when the reporter said sheesh i cringed so fkn hard omfg
So he left it open with the engine running!.....Dumb ass!!!
I swear I’ll never do it again!!!
Why do people always leave the car running its the same in my country usually the driver will get out of the car and leave it running to open up their porch gate and thats when the thieves strike..we even have PSA about it but some people just never learn
Not a single door was locked that day
This reminds me of an incident that happened in my hometown. A scumbag went into a convenience store and robbed the place, but he just happened to do it while a Kung Fu instructor was getting some gas. Long story short, the guy got his butt whipped and he was held in a headlock until the police arrived.
I have seen worse fights in kindergarten.
both didnt lock the door...idiots !
Ya sure you didnt want to hit him more.
We had at our college, somebody quick grab the cash box at the concession stand of a game. The robber quickly escaped out the doors but the track team just happened to be there....hahahahahaha. He didn't get too far.
Sheesh!
So lock your dam doors and please for the love of god do not leave your car running. If you do then you deserve to loose your car.
He literally just kicked him two times..
This is the ufc fighters wet dream come true 😂
Is everyone going to ignore the “sheesh”
Sheeeeeeeesh
*sheesh*
PROTIP: never mess with a dude wearing a fanny pack. It's not going to end well.
Thats why you be careful of the humbles guys, I respect the humble guys more than the big loud mouth ones, if you see the humble one not talking, putting on a mouth piece, and warming up with combos, it’s best for you to make your peace 😂😂😂
Also this guy is hardly a ufc fighter.  That car is not worthy of such a person.  The owner of that pos works at Mc Donald's.
Lol, all he did was drag him out of the car! There was ZERO "pounding".
everyone is a gangsta until gets punch in the mouth
3.64 a gallon. thank you dems
I watch ufc and I dont know who that is lol
Oh he has the yellow fanny pack. Has great agility stats
0:44
Cry baby got to stepping real fast lmao
Good response from the UFC fighter. Good guy👍
Those were knees that were thrown my man
Lesson: get a Tesla and use pin to drive
Jujitsu guy still has to learn how not to leave a vehicle running. Must go back to training.
He beat that democrat.  Good on him!
Wtf is wrong with ppl who just leave their car running while they're inside a store? That guy's taken to many blows to the head.
Regrets leaving his keys in the car.  Duh.
A good few “knees” you mean 😂😂
He left it unlocked and running???????
What UFC fighter drives a Scion TC?
stupid for both sides
Joe Biden left Americans behind enemy lines in Afghanistan
The thief must have thought it was his lucky day.
That's what 5000 hrs of practice makes you !!
Its a honda let him have it
YEAH BABY. There’s a real man right there!
just lock your car in general
Got his ass whooped by a guy in a Fanny pack
This is just gta
Good reporting
Yikes
The title says big mistake. It wasn't big. A big mistake would be he got bones broken, face bloodied, on handcuffs in a cop car. THAT is a big mistake.  He got away! He's probably thanking his lucky stars that night, especially when he saw the news that it was a UFC fighter he was trying to steal from.
Try locking your car.....
What a Pitiful LESSON having caught the Thief red handed  ! I'm an old man but would've BEATEN the bastard to pulp .
Ummm You, leave the doors unlocked leaving it running, luckily the UFC fighter knows how too fight, since he might be lacking something else common sense.
The sad thing,  people  blame him for leaving  his car running, if that was a horse. It's  still  a hanging  offense  in some places  and should  be everywhere.
Thought he was Cliff from State Farm
He may be tough, but not very smart.
BLM
I pray a nuecleur missle on amerikka
UFC fighter? Fanny pack? Honda Civic??? Yeah, that thief was trying to do you a favor.
This is the difference between  a real fighter and a punk....Between a man and a boy....Between a human being and a predatory savage.....   I learned as a young man playing toughguy games that there were those who wouldn't put up with it.....And, they were sometimes better at it.
Great stuff  but also have to watch out for arms these crooks carry sometimes
lock your car and never leave it running ? what ? so the car was NOT locked and it was running ?? wow.....
Its like if a criminal puts a gun to a suicidal persons head, the victim be like, go for it, make it count right between the eyes. The criminal then pistol hits him and walks away.   Ironic huh
Courteous thief. He put it in park before getting out.
Since when knees are punches?
He's in the UFC and drives a Honda Civic? Wow, Dana White has to start paying these guys.
Lmao no one expects the guy with the Fanny pack to be able to fight
Abit clickbait of a video, i.e the word "ufc" was used. All he did was knee him a few times and thats it. Also why do idiots not lock the car and leave their keys still in? People have had their cars taken WITH kids/babies still inside. p.s his just lucky, its the US the fighter could've been shot
In the 70s, they would say a Karate Expert. The 80s a Ninja. The 90s, a Tough Man Fighter. The 2000s a MMA fighter. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!
At the end of the day the thief got away lol😂🤣😭
Who's the ufc fighter ?
what a fkn waste of time.
Denver must be a nice place to leave your car running like that.
That's what his dumb ass get for trying  2 steal.
Why do most of ppl in US leave their cars unlocked?
Should have tied him to the car and drove like they did in the South...
He must be the world's fastest puncher because I didn't see any.
He should have sweeped his legs and sat on him onto the Po-po arrived.
Well, in Chicago there are CAREER criminals running around and EVERYONE seems to think the Mayor all by herself is responsible.
i was disappointed, i thought he's gonna slam him on the ground 😂
It appears Jordan is a slow learner, which may be why no one has ever heard of him.
Did the reporter just says sheesh?
he should used a take down and submission hold on the guy, then he coulda held him till cops got there, lol
BRO DRIVE A HONDA?
Just a coincidence that all these UFC fighters happen to stop robbers and thief's on the daily
CARRY A GUN
Pounds car thief sounds like penetration 🤣
oh..but i like the "do more damage" approach best  : o
"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth"... Iron Mike Tyson
He did the car jacker a favor and kept him out of prison.  Had he called the cops, the car jacker would have had it worse than eating a few punches.
Always some putting temptation in the face of morally challenged idiots then enjoy dishing out some more pain like it was a proper way to behave. Lock your car. It saves a lot of damage.
Never leave your engine running and car unlocked as you invite trouble.
The kinda person who leave the keys in the car plus running. Is the same kinda person who parks his car in his garage then arm the car alarm....
Watching a thief get pounded by a ufc fighter in a Fanny Pack just made my whole year!
I can't see anyfight
I have no idea why people are raciest...
Got into fighting cause he was tired of all the people giving him shit about his fanny pack.
Those were knees to the head 🤣🤣 hell yeah wayyy more painful dude ran off holding the bump on his head hahaha
Just because he's a UFC wrestler doesn't mean he can get off the hook for a physical assault. Just because you intervene in a crime doesn't mean you have the right to commit a crime yourself against another. It's almost like allowing rap music to be an excuse for me to harm another individual LOL
Look up what Nick Cannon has to say about melanin.
In Georgia I leave my car running just so I can bait would be thieves and justify shooting the car up when they try to steal it.  Haven’t got any takers yet. Lol
When will people learn:  Don't leave your car running while you aren't in it~!  DUH.
HAHAHA I know this guy! Sup Williams!
GTA NUTSHELL
Shouldn't have to lock your car or worry about leaving it running. People need to learn to not mess with shit that doesn't belong to them.
My car has a FOB...it will die if your 20 ft away! Cars still ha e keys? 😂
This is victim integration to all you liberals
Tough guy leave your car on and unattended....dumb.
I only regret one thing. That this prize fighter didn't leave the bad guy in a crumpled heap on the ground regretting his life's decisions.
"... Not to do anymore damage. ... Just to control the situation ...so he's not out there doing more damage?..." well, it seems to me a broken arm and/or leg, rib(s),etc., etc., would've been well in order.....
Uhhh how weren't the doors locked? How did the car get put in park? I have sooooo many questions.
Wish I was able to apprehend him.. well I mean you could probably outrun him if not in speed then in endurance lol
Idiot 101:  leaving the keys in it...
CV shot is the mark of the beast so please don't take it because if you do you will go to hell
this the type of people who see a stealing opportunity but have no need to do it and still do it. Complete idiots
😂
HOW STUPID IS THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.  YOU HAVE BEEN HIT IN THE HEAD TOO MUCH.
Lol hes 0 and 2 in the ufc. This is his first fight that he won since joining
What is more unbelievable is the gas price at 3.64 per gallon...Don´t see that in California these days.
A civic ?🤣he was trying to steal a civic 😱wtf! Is this a joke ?🤔😂Well That’s funny cuz my car still can be running and locked at same time if I leave it running than leave with the keys it will automatically lock the doors nobody will steal ur car that way if u wanna keep it running while ur at the gas station and that’s year 2015 technology 😂 This 1 ufc fighter that went to my gym his car was a fuken mcclaren p4😱😍 my bf new him from tv and saw his keys since he was like flaunting  them n put .2nd 2  Together ya but my gym is full of rich ppl cars n they all park normal but this guy is the only guy that parks like a douche horizontally and takening up 2-3 car spaces 😂 but that’s no surprise cuz isn’t that what they drive with the money they make n all ...real cars but this guy ——a fuken civic 🤣🤣🤣wow now that’s a embarrassment n funny  He must not be that of a good fighter 🤷🏻‍♀️  But ya that’s why u don’t get Honda -or a civic there crap and behind on technology or they just don’t care n stuck on old style forever😂and ya I heard the most cars to be stolen r Honda’s 🤔hmm wonder why that is
For you all who leave your car doors unlocked, you all are BOLD.
I didn’t know that knees are called punches nice 👍🏻
That dipshit deserved what he got.  BOTH of them.    Don't steal.  Don't leave your vehicle running.  Don't leave your car unlocked.
Shheeeeeeeeeshh
Leave your keys in the car? Lol
i blame systemic racism
Can you imagine all the bitches whining in this country if a cop did that to him?
Next time the theft will carry a weapon.
Trying best to white-face
DUH?! HE wants to remind people to lock n urs doors n don't leave it running.. DUH DUH DUH.. seems like everyone knew that but YOU.. ffs
The remark was vitally important I wish he did too teach these fools a lesson
Great, remember to spray something around the wheel speed sensor and crank position sensor.
The thief made the same mistake the owner did. Forgot to lock the door
Mmmm? “Lock your car and never leave it running?” What a novel idea.
All a stage...the car locks the doors when in gear...and what about the car not rolling backwards after the perp was pulled out...  So I call BS....on this so called bada$$
They both should have locked the doors
Please, somebody explain to me why you would leave keys in the car or worse yet leave it running?  Takes about 30 seconds total to turn engine off.
I don’t ever get why people leave their car running while they go into a quickie mart… really, why would you do this????
Haha beautiful
I like how the thief runs out with his hand on his.....he's like a kid saying mommmaaaaaaaaaa
A Fanny pack? No wonder their fighters are going with Bellator.
Like in Grand Theft Auto video games, nobody locks their car doors, even the thief who could get away.
Meh. Didn’t make the thief do the seal. Failed ass beating.
That was it! The title made me think he really beat the shit out of the thief. He let him go waaay too soon!
never ever give a thief an opportunity ….. how hard is it? Take your 🔐 keys?
Wow some of these thieves living life like it is one long video game of “GRAND THEFT AUTO.”  Crazy-criminals.
This feels fake.
Leave him alone 😑  There are even such people who are very proudly decent dignified respectable and happily married men and sexually harassing another unwilling helpless woman 😠 This guy seems much better than such men ☺
Who doesn’t lock their car 🦆
those are called knees
I was waiting for a tap out or knockout or rear naked choke submission move but some knees to the face and head still works. Lesson to be learned here lock your car and HODL!
Staged
Don't try to be a hero like this guy if you have full coverage let them have that these young blow your head off
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A car locks for a reason lol why was there ever a time when it was considered “okay” to leave it unlocked. Never in my life, no where, no time.
Damn reporters are saying sheeesh now🤣🤣🤣😂🤫
Honestly i bet there is a bit of hesitation. Like oh shit I get to pull out the animal? And the moment is already over.
What a dildo to leave the car running
Fake MMA fighter wanted to fight a crackhead so he kept his car running while he waiting for the crackhead to get in his car🙄
Great fighter but very stupid!
I would like to know how the fighter got into the moving car. As soon as my car goes in reverse or drive the door locks….
The thief is lucky he only got a light beat down and not shot.
Thief democrat vs republican
Had to see this ⚡️⚡️⚰️. Lol
Who the fuck leaves their car running and their door unlocked…
I’m glad that incident didn’t happen in Los Angeles County.  DA Gascon would have filed assault charges on the UFC fighter (Victim). The crook would have been a victim, even though he stole a car!
The fact that his regret wasn't that he left his car running, unlocked, and unattended is proof we are getting dumber as a people.  Smh.
Maybe the alleged "thief" was simply confused and thought it was his car?  I have a grav car that looks like 5 million other gray cars and twice I went inside the wrong car!
The news really lies about everything don’t they? A few good punches? I think You mean a few weak knees
So, He left his car Unlocked, with the Motor RUNNING?👎 In some neighborhood's they call that a Bait car. SMFH🙄
motto ....take your keys and lock yr car everywhere u go
So fake
Is that a Malibu? Dana white needs to be sued
Another  upscale  person of African-American  decent.....to be PC...
was the car left on and unlocked?
Yeah this isn't 1935 you better lock yo shit
Lesson learned  Don't try jacking a pro fighters car
My man in the civic
I still leave my truck running at times. But if you decide to steal it. Then you're really hurting. Cause its rusted to hell. And tough to drive.
3.64 for gas, my lord
Sheeshhhh
How lucky someones gotta feel to be trained in martial arts and have a chance to slap around a regular person Without risk
This happens in vegas all the time. You gotta be a special type of idiot to leave your car running and unattended.
Why did I heard sheesh LOL
News reporter SHEEEESH!🤣
Who leaves their keys in the car running wen they leave the car not really a smart move your just asking to be robbed
My former girlfriend was always leaving her keys in her car.  I nagged her for months to stop doing this, her response? — “I’m careful about where I do it.”  One day, in the driveway of someone she knew, in a part of town she knew nothing about, it happened.  My response? — “You’ve got nobody to blame but yourself.”  By the way, her purse was just lying on the seat, windows rolled down, and they could have just taken the purse, with money, credit card, keys…. I now have one more item to add to the list of things I will not tolerate in a potential girlfriend — stupidity.  Actually that should have been on the list all along.
GTA. Put more gas on the back up and smash him with the door
3.64 gas!!!!???? thanks potato head biden
Oh he's the kid who has diabetes, I remember him now
That was pretty funny though. “He gets a few good punches in” (dude throws a couple knees at a lower opponent because this isn’t the octagon and it don’t matter where you’re hands are)
CNN will show that white American assaulting a black guy..#BLM
A few knees too good job!
Duh he left his car running just give it to the thieves.
A few good punches with his knee 😂
He left it running! What an asshole!
If he's a UFC Fighter, I'm an ace pilot.
Weird I know that dude from hangtown ca what a small world
Technically those were “leg punches”
I think the real reason he tried to steal your car is because you were wearing that pretty little fanny pack.
I don't understand: he opened the door, and the guy just conveniently stoped driving???
Why would you leave your car running and walk away in denver.
He was lucky he wasn't caught between the car door and the road.
Leave it running. Hummmmmmmm????
Black lives matter !! Clearly seen in this video
Hmm? Thief shifts car into "park" before being pulled out.. & UFC dude wished he apprehend the thief... he just had his hands on him???
I kinda wish he did more damage to the thief.
'Lock your car and never leave running'. Is that for real? Do people leave their cars running when they go shopping? Why?
another ufc fighter NEVER EVER  seen on the UFC
In Chicago, the car jacker would get a statue from the mayor beetle
This is why learning self-defense is so important. There's no time to call the cops. No one is more responsible for your life and liberty than you. "A Free Society is an Armed Society." #MakeAmericaFreeAgain 🌺 #BeBoldVoteGold 💛
Don’t leave your keys in the car. He might be strong but...
..what if the car thief have a gun?
You'll see that criminal again. Next time walking around with a broom stick hanging out his butt.  Criminal: What the heck happened? Car owner: You slipped and fell on a broom. Criminal: I remember trying to steal your car though! Owner: Yeah but you had a weak chin. Criminal: But were did the stick come from?  Owner: I dont know.( Big smile)
Really? that's what happens in America? someone will just get in your car and drive off??
Guess UFC doesn't have any rules. A professional boxer could lose boxing license. Hands are registered as deadly weapons. Don't get me wrong  car thief got justice.
When he encounters a Dark Soul boss in a precarious nature.
UFC fighter pounds car thief.  That didn't come out right.
we need to start executing car thieves
Sheesh 😂
I bet this car thief tuff guy told his homies a different story.
Big deal how pathetic…. Professional fighter hahaha good ball
$3.64 for a gallon of gas
He was owed that car. Reparations right?
Don’t steal…it’s so simple.
i think i can forgive the fanny pack just this one time.
I love a good ending.
This video doesn't show what happened LOL. For all we know he could have just slapped the guy a few times then the criminal ran away. It would have been a worthwhile video if he apprehended the dirtbag.
That's why i prefer rob kids or elderly woman
Never understood why you would just walk away from any vehicle leaving it running unattended. What is that.
His only regret isnt leaving the keys in the ignition and the car running, nah, that's taking responsibility for being stupid, his regret is not apprehending the guy...both f*cking idiots oughta be on joey btoonz...
a “NO MAS” moment lol
Could have just locked ur car
HE TREW KNEES! No punches lol LANDED 2 from what I saw
The real story here is ufc fighter wears fanny pack
The thief didn't lock the doors when he saw that guy charging? Good for the UFC guy, but good lord, what a dummy lol.
Dats wad-up bitch !! Pow 👊💥    🇺🇸
In which one of the 3 frames, did he lump him up?
Don't f u c k with the quiet guy
This is a direct representation of what will happen if the left keeps pushing the right. The left is trying to steal our car, and dont even realize what they got commin to em.
When you see a guy with ears like that... choose another target :)
Have two sets of keys so you can leave Yr car running always keep aware eyes on the prize
Who the heck leaves their car running what a Clown
Thieves deserve broken hands and legs minimum
Ufc is trash lzzzzzz
they still have Sinclair gas stations  i have noe seen one of those  in years
It's just plain stupid leaving your vehicle unattended while it's running and the doors unlocked.
Why did he unlock car Come on man
Why leave your car running and not lock the door?
Sin suptitulos al español adiós
Yeah he's the dumb one for leaving it unlocked and engine running
Where are all these BLM protestors screaming justice when its their own people doing the crime.
That fool ran away rubbing his head 😆
OMG! Dinoco is a real gas station! 8D
Don't leave your running, when you turn it off take the keys out.
UFC fighter with NO brain sense to LOCK HIS CAR when going into the store.  Too many hits to the head i guess.
don't understand why people think turning their car off is so difficult.
Unlocked and running. 😂
Don’t think he did that again for at least a month. Did you see the blood pouring from his head 🤣🤣🤣
punches?
I am sorry but he deserved to get his car stolen for being so F stupid for leaving it running and open
People leave their cars unlocked with the engine running!?
Williams sounds stupid for not locking his car & leaving it running... must be all the hits to the head..
is there a real answer to why my tube tv and Nintendo had clearer graphics then most surveillance footage?  I mean, of all the areas to not improve clarity, why the fok there ?
FAKE FAKE FAKE.
He got that Fanny pack from joe
Who leaves their car unlocked and with the keys inside? Lol just asking to get his car stolen.
Like why do you need to steal a car for? Just go on craigslist and buy a 90's model Camry for $200.
Dumbass left the key in the car? Was lucky, dude didn't have a gun....
You gave a fighter the greenlight he needed. Rip
Crime is rampant  Alleged victim is whom?
ive stolen a car before cause someone went into 7 11 an left their car running with doors unlocked. life lesson ppl your not special, be smart turn off your car and lock your doors
Why do people leave the car running like this even.
and he let him go ? lol
OMG… Unlocked with keys in it and running. Not the smartest of guys.   Don’t tell him I said that though 😨
News people are legit dumb af.
0:44
😹😹😹😹😹🤪😹😹😹😹
First the UFC needs to keep his keys in hands at all times
Bruh he just left like he's done nothing.
The first part of the video shows him getting into his own car, so I thought the thief was inside the car when he got into his own car! LOL! The next clip shows him getting the thief out of his car from the outside of his car! I hope the thief is caught, so it doesn't happen to someone else!
He purposely left them keys in as a trap so he has an excuse to let some steam off 🤣
Meanwhile CAR enthusiast will notice that the color of front and rear gate differ.
his stupid yellow fanny pack is cracking me up, tho!
Let me guess, he wants to teach us a lesson; never leave your car running especially at a gas station?🤔🙄
Reminds me of the time some guy broke into the house of a 73 year old retired boxer who was also a former Royal Marines Hand-To-Hand Combat instructor, and tried to threaten him and his wife - only to get the shit get beat out of him.  If you see his mug shot, you can see just how strong and how that 73 year old man overpowered a 24 year old with a knife; using only his bare hands.
he should have handed ass to him.
Car owner is an idiot and potentially put innocent lives in danger leaving his vehicle unlocked with keys in it.  Thieves will be thieves, just doing what they do best
I always say you never know who you messin with. Better to keep to yourself.
The guy left it unlocked with the engine running? How dumb do you have to be? I’m on the side of the thief here
The bad guy gets away, just like democrats want it…
It disturbs me that this happened in Denver .
Yo,you gotta see the captions!
He parked his car and left it running???
Or learn to lock your car haha that is the owners fault 100%
0:44 Sheeesh 😂🤙🤙🤙🔥
Props to this guy, he couldda fucking killed him with his bare hands
My dad: "let him have the car, guns are no fun, cars can be replaced people can't. If your baby's not in the backseat just let it go
Tha dredded fanny pack
Love happy endings like this.
Only UFC fighters can wear fanny packs and no one says a word.
That awful feeling when get cought and you have to ran fast from humiliation. Find a proper job,you idiot!
The "UFC Fighter" got lucky. Never attempt to go after someone stealing your car..Most cases involve being shot..
Always leave my car running this still hasn’t happened to me 😂😂
Never heard of this guy but ok
To the ufc guy:Bruh,u need knock them out,not just kick them out!,the next one can be a producer of a gun
He got off easy
I think his skills are more important inside the octagon idiot reporter.
Indeed
Fu fighter
Good
Hmmmmm…. Looks fabricated
Where I live it's illegal to leave your car running unattended.
Don't Lock it...Lose it    Simple
Ufc? Never heard of this guy
0:44 oh boy, we’ve been “sheeshed”
PLOT TWIST: The fighter intentionally kept the keys in the car so he could punch somebody.
You leave the car unlocked and running what do you expect. It's like if you leave old Kroger coupons laying in the street, someone is going to jump out of an airplane and call in to work sick because they drank old apple juice.
The car thief's mom is going to be on TV claiming her son just needed money for school.
Good thing that thief wasn’t packing.
Sheesh??
Should have never happened in the first place.  Idiot.
Not sure what the laws are in his state but I know in some cases, you can be classified as a "deadly weapon" if you're a professional fighter so if you injure the person, you can be charged as if you had attacked them with an actual weapon.
Lots of brothers love to do this , leave the car running with stereo blasting to show off , i see it all the time .
Where in Denver is this?
The jacker guy - 'owie my face'
Cant believe people are blaming the driver like I get he fucked up but the other dude is still a thief😂
I feel like the driver left the car running on purpose so he can fight someone who steals it because he is bored.
"Black man trying to steal car, gets wrecked"
News anchors these days can't spit out a proper sentence
Moral story: Never steal wrong people who got a skills karate, wrestling and boxing.
When people say, "fuck around and find out," THAT'S what they mean.
Leaving the keys in the car big no no,
Nobody wanted to spare with him so he intentionally baited a thieve lol
i'm surprised the thief had the ability to place it back in park as he was getting pummled
What a tard bro could have locked the door to get away 😂
Damn... gas price is 3.65  🤯 2.90 were I live
Ppl need To stop leaving their keys in the car, wow, may as well call up a chop shop and see if you can drop it off on the way to the store.
I didn't see ant punches, just the guy yanking on him a few times to pull him out of the car, unless I'm just dumb and don't know what a punch looks like, cause I never seen a punch get thrown.
https://youtu.be/uZdv-TtiMkg
Ufc fighter, more like methhead.
That’s on colfax . I seen a 5speed jeep get stolen once well I was sitting at the bus stop dude just walked In to grab chicken wings and his shit was getting jacked when he came out by somone who Barely new how to drive a 5sped
What could go wrong leaving keys in car.
What the??? A dinosaur gas station??? LOL
One good knee no punches
Go figure.. Its a ... Well it rhymes..
I would not have been so nice..... But good catch man.
The car was left running? He must have taken too many shots to the head. That's just plain stupid! Glad he got his car back, though.
Throw hands, sheesh? Jesus the decline of professionalism permitted  in the name of "equivalency" is our fucking demise.
fucking Ninja can't get a job so he has to steal shit from people!!!  however, why the fuck did the car owner leave his car running?
One meat head to the other…hey where’s the BEEF!
I just want to know who these people are who leave their keys in the car. What plastic bubble shield and in what alternate  universe are they living ?
Why did I keep thinking it said kfc fighter😂🤣
Going hard with a fanny pack....damn bruh
Mate, sorry but you let him off to easy.
Unlocked and car still running?  He deserved to get for his car stolen.
lol look at him run away, pathetic
This happened to me in GTA
This is y u lock ur car
"Williams says he only regrets one thing...."  "I wish I wasn't wearing a yellow fanny pack on the local news"
Why would he let him go??? Also, why did he leave the keys in the car??? What is going on here???
That felt so good to see, I'm going to sleep now
That gas station is awesome it got a dinosaur on it
Apparently you have to become a UFC fighter in order to wear a fanny pack.
The fighter is not very smart!! If the guy has a gun!!! Wold be another history. Let the insurance pay for the lost.
I smell a fractured eye socket
The first fight jordan williams won 🤣
i know jordan.. he just got that car.. he wasnt given it up
Oh williams DAMAGE is exactly what that thief ndeds
This could've easily been avoided if the fighter turned off his vehicle, took his keys with him and locked his doors. It def sucks that someone saw an opportunity to fuck this guy over but the fighter is purely to blame for his car almost getting stolen. I see it too many times that people leave their cat idling just because they think they're in a good neighborhood with their doors unlocked. Just as ignorant to do that as it is for someone to jack your ride.
Ill bet he wont leave his car open again.
Kevin Hart said UFC fighters are real and he wasn't lying.
All this while wearing a fanny pack.
Ok class what did we learn? . . .  That’s right… Never try to steal a car from a guy who’s wearing a Fanny pack
Love seeing a jjogger get his azz beat!

😁
If you hit a black man stealing your car, I see that as racist.
No wonder he took the chance if why would you leave your keys inside
Who tf leaves their car running or the keys inside
It was at that moment he knew he f****d up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He would be out the next day even if you had apprehended him...better to inflict pain & damage...then may-be he would think TWICE.
Nice fanny pack... no one would ever expect a bad ass to be wearing one of them lol
Yes!!!!
"He only regrets 1 thing".... wearing a fannypack.. That's sun yellow color.
Bait car prank was successful               ..........  Sincerely yours-           The fanny pack UFC fighter
When this theif is telling this story to his homies it will go like I beat the shit out of this UFC fighter til six of his friends jumped me from behind.  We all know the kind ,no job ,drug addict,with no future . Will wind up dead or in jail.
Kathy probably saw that he was wearing a fanny pack I thought it was an easy steal.
Stupid meat head...also lock your doors as soon as you get in the car. And u should have turned him in...THEY DO NOT LEARN... THE CROOK IS NOW THINKING, "MAN I LEARNED MY LESSON TO BE SURE THAT I LOCK THE DOOR AS SOON AS I GET INSIDE OF THE CAR THAT I AM STEALING!"
You choose the wrong car fool!!!
Nobody’s gonna say it? Fine I’ll do it…  Why is this big ass UFC fighter driving a CIVIC?!
Great job buddy.
Where was the punches?
See how it works out of shape middle age white guys that live in fear and buy a gun?  When you can handle yourself, a simple property crime doesn't require someone to die.
Boring
https://youtu.be/1NOv4U2jQPo
I thought his only regret would be wearing a bright yellow fannypack during his 15 seconds of fame.
Gas prices were 3.64!? Fuck that!
Okay.. so are we really not gonna talk about the fanny pack he got on ?
I got a ufc streaming ad in at the beginning of the vid lol
Derrick lewis: hold my beer..
Living out all MMA fighters dream
Looked like he was fully expecting the guy to turn around and square up but got really disappointed when he ran away lol
I don’t know what’s worse. the guy thinking there’s nothing wrong with stealing a car that somebody worked hard to earn OR the guy who’s car is getting stolen is a MMA trained fighter and doesn’t absolutely pound this arsehole into a multicolored puddle.
Best part. The bad guy running away holding his head
If you wanted to seduce a guy why didn’t you put them in a submission hold. Just saying.
Too bad he’s too stupid to NOT keeping his car running AND WEARING A FANNY PACK.
Sheesh
Never heard of him.
So he is a ufc fighter eh ? Maybe too many punches to the head that’s why the dumb ass left the keys in the ignition. Wonder if he is any smarter now ? Nah, doubt it.
Who on earth would keep their car running AND unlocked at the same time
How about not leaving your car running going into a store. Not saying that the thief was right but still, if anyone wants to steal numerous cars a day, just hangout any convenience shop. People leave their cars running all the time. So f***ing stupid.
Everyone is a gangsta until the robber show his gun 😂
Who is dumber, the idiot who tried to steal the car or the moron who left his car running?
The man threw knees but news guy called them punches. Proof that the media can look at a video as clear as that and still jack it up.
Seriously, leaving your car running and going into a shop is next level stupid. I live in a small village and I wouldn't even do something as dumb as that.
Stupid! He cd hv had a gun or knife! Value ur life over an f’in car. Lock ur damn car!
Super necessary
This guy is almost as dumb as the guy who tried to steal Derrick Lewis's truck. Yeah, steal the truck of a guy who has the most knockouts in UFC heavyweight history. This guy got away. The other one ended up in the hospital
The thief is lucky Bruce Buffer didn't jump out and start announcing... Fighting out of the red corner!!!... The fighter might have gone for the finish upon hearing that.
You cant press charges if you leave the car running in a lot with doors unlocked in some States.
sheesh
Look staged.  A car jacker is not going to stop & Let you pull him out. BS
More thugs need this
Love the fact he had a fanny pack on.
I'll leave  mine running with keys inside but I have 2 sets of keys I carry and will keep the car locked.
When Chou target lock the enemy
This ufc fighter got hit to many times in the head, how dumb can you be to leave the keys in the car, and unlocked!
Good job, but to say you wish you could have apprehended him…dude you stood there and let the guy run. C’mon now
Charges are forth coming for ufc fighter because that’s the woke backwards thinking of today.  I’m sure the guy that was steeling his car is going to sue him and win some of that ufc money 💰
Maybe the thief was just teaching that driver a lesson that he should be a bit more responsible of taking care of his 🚗
My car locks the doors as soon as you put it in gear. Fighter was lucky his doesn't do the same.
Great strategy to go for the knees in that situation.
That...fanny pack.
He a good man for not lillin that dude..
UFC fighters wear fanny packs. Are fanny packs now 'cool'?
Duh! Lock your car and never leave it running. What a stupid thing to do the UFC made his car a target! Duh!
He is pro and let the thief go what a clown
If thief had just locked the door..
This is the equivalent of putting the cake in front of a dog, then beating him, when he licks it. The UFC fighter knew what he was doing, when he left the car running, lol
Dude should have the thief as a hostage to and be his driver for moment lmao
Lock your car dopey
How dumb is the thief not locking the door once he's inside
Imagine getting an ass whooping by a man wearing a fanny pack.
Instant karma!!😆🤣
UFC fighter with brain damage, nothing new.
That ufc fighter is an idiot
He said he's a feather weight,he told me he stole another car down the road.
Its Chris Paul
Lol leaving your car running you’re stupid.. idk what to tell you that’s stupid..
I bet he wished the police showed up 1st before the car owner😩😂😂😂
Damnn imagine fighting in the ufc and driving a Honda Civic smh
If that's Mexico that guy Would be burned alive
Umm, shows the mentality of someone leaving keys in the car in today's world. I am so smart I punched a guy trying to steal my car but I was a DA to leave the keys in the car. I want to be on TV.
Crime does not pay
Why did he stop beating him?
hahahahahahahah
Thief: "Damn better put this shit in park before he pulls me out"
$3.64 a Gallon?! That's the real sheesh moment in this vid.
set up for fame
Knee kick😂😂👍
sheesh...
Couldn't see any punches because of the bloody text..  hehehe
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Blows my mind why yoy leave your car running in any circumstance lol
He regrets one thing...being caught wearing a fanny pack on film forever
Never steal anything much less a man's car that has cauliflower ear's 😂 dead give away of a professional fighter..
A "would be car thief"? Something tells me that he already had the car thief tag
Same thing would happen to you if you tried to take mine and I've never in my life been in the UFC LOL
How long before the “woke” media and its followers cry racism? 🤔
Fake. They were sparring.
They have this story all wrong...the owner who left his car running while he went into the store is the one who needs a good whooping for being so stupid.
Fight like bear Smart like chair
Those ears don’t lie.
Mmm yeah. He pounded him so good. Mmm yeah
I would of really liked it if he did NOT stop kneeing him to the head!!!!!!
He wanted to inflict more damage.
Now he’s gotta go steal pain meds 😂😂
If those were punches, imagine some knees.
UFC fighter with a yellow Fanny pack
JOIN ME IN DISLIKING ALL VIDEOS THAT ARE CENSORED OR WHICH FORCE VIEWERS TO WATCH COMMERCIALS.  MAYBE YOUTUBE WILL BE FUN AGAIN.
Even if he was arrested he’d be back on the streets in that liberal city
Gas must be so cheap there, people can leave cars running while shopping.
Another Hallmark moment brought to you by cakeboy news.
It was cool and all but like typical news they made it seem so much more than what it really was..
Leave your car running and unlocked, the thief seems like the smarter one here.
Maybe he deserve to get his car stolen. Let me just leave my keys inside running in this shading neighborhood should be fine. One too many concussions seem to affected your decision making.
I used to tell my students when they left their toolbox in the back of their trucks they created a thief that may not have been one  You don't leave your car running keys in it you don't leave valuables in the back your truck  I'm not saying it's not the person's fault that steals I'm saying you have responsibility towards your own valuables  It's something u would reprimand a little kid for leaving valuables out in the yard I learned a hard lesson when I was very young just because I'm honest doesn't mean all friends are everybody in the world isn't honest we tend to assume people are like us  I've learned in to long-term friendships there's some extremely dishonest people out there  Sad but true😞
It's a Honda ..who cares
Oops.
He ran away holding his face 🤣 😂
maybe he just ran in super quick for something it looked pretty empty.. but still bruh lock ur damn car
Thieves like roaches you leave something of value and they behind your back scurry in to lay hold of what's yours with their guilty dirty hands.
Dirt bag
my boss always leaves his car running especially during the summer when it's hot to run the ac and he leaves his keys in his car at his house every night....guess what?....yep...couple weeks ago it was stolen out of his drive way.
“You’re Gonna Get Hit; You’re Gonna Get Knocked Out; You’re Gonna Feel It; This Is The Ultimate!”
You can definitely tell he's a fighter. He has that slurred speech going on. Why would you leave your keys in the ignition while it's unattended..
Brawn but no brains. Don't leave your car running unattended... Duh. I'm a genius I know. Common sense isn't so common these days. Ugh
People that leave their cars running at the gas station while inside. This is what I always picture would happen if I did
He's an ultra intellect 😆
Doh ! Didn’t see that coming lol
Bro… illegal knees  Herb: -1 point
Typical Denver idiot. Surprised he didn’t have kids in the car. Apparently you’re supposed to leave your car running when your kids are in the car if you’re a Denver a zombie. Go Broncos.
Laughed when guy ran away grabbing is forehead.
He mama say he a guh boi doe. 😉
never fuck with a man wearing a gd fannypack
Keys in car running?  Bait Car?
What's that sound at the end lol
In Texas leaving your keys in your car is illegal.  Here this newscast would have resulted in a ticket.
imagine getting your ass kicked by a guy in a fanny pack
That car isn't worth dying over. Also I am surprised the driver isn't being charged or being attacked online for injuring that man who just needed a car so he could get to work.
Should have tripped him in the process
I've gotten a ticket for leaving my car on in Tx. I was cool with it
I like when theifs learn like this.
$3.64 a gallon   Bullshit
If you see a dude coming at you with a cauliflower ear... run.
messed with the wrong dude.
Leaves it running?......
I was hoping I was gonna see a KNOCK OUT!
Don’t leave the engine running
Hey that’s not nice, maybe he was on his way to help his community, maybe deliver food to the elderly or visit a children’s hospital, that white man and his white privilege are wicked.  BLACK LIVES MATTER!
He thought he was tough that’s why he left it running but props to him for getting his car back
Left the car running? Wtf
Excellent knees in the clinch
"Lock your car and never leave it running" yeah no shit. Any idiot that leaves their car unlocked and running while they go into a store is just asking to have it stolen.
Whoever wrote that headline on the video watches too much porn
Dumbass on bother sides. Thief trying to steal the car and the other guy who left it running
He didnt grow up in rough areas and it really shows...smh lmao he asked for that shit to happen.  Sorry bout it hahaha
He left the car running rofl
I didn't see any punches thrown. I did see a couple knees to the face, though.
Isnt that kicking?
I can't stop thinking about the way that man said sheesh 🤣
😂😂🤣 the classic head massage while looking back at the man that just fed him a bowl knees… hahahahahahahahahahhaha  The thief showing himself a little empathy while running away is too funny
Sad thing is, the thief is probably now just angry that he got beat and not reflecting on his life choices.
Who doesn't lock their car?
Power to the people BRO, YES!
(Sesh haha! )Da fuck is that man! Lol seeeshh my guy sheeeshh!!
Those weren't punches
why did the thief run away like a kid running to his mommy after he just bumped his head😂😂
Always lock the doors if the car is not yours
Lesson for all. Look at the damn cauliflower ears before you take the car.
Did he juat say sheesh?
What's up with the gas prices at the :31 second mark?  Are the prices up to $3.64 a gallon in Denver now?
He wants people to know to lock you car and not to leave it running.  Haha no common sense he been punched in the head 1 too many times.
Usual suspects
Show the punches
Yo no ones talking about the fanny pack!!!!!
My man carries a fanny pack for those ginormous balls.
Yea lock you car ...who doesnt lock their car when your not in it and was it running ?
If it was Tyron Woodley he would have hit him once and ran away
It's a calculator - but it's made from bamboo!
the cameraman said “sheeesh” 💀💀💀💀
I saw Chuck Ladelle at the DMV get out of his Ford bronco I thought about writing pussy on the back of his window and guess what I did it because if I got caught doing it he would’ve broke my neck
Guy took one look at his ears and bolted
Left his car running with the door unlocked? That dude has had too many shots to the head.
Wait did the thief actually put the car in park?
if all the humans on earth couldn't make a mistake with anything ever again or die we would be extinct in a very short time span
He should hv done more , giving that man more pain!😡
Yup that’s why I always turn off my car/lock doors even if it’s for 10-15 seconds. You just never know when an idiot will cross your path
Lol that news commentator was like "sheesh" welcome 2021 no filter
Dude got whooped by a man with a fanny pack..
I am living in a nice upper-class neighborhood now. Being from Jersey I'm kind of obsessive about keeping the doors locked on everything. Neighbor lady has no security lighting, leave the keys in the car, and the car goes missing! That's country people!
I think he let him get away because he knew he was the one mostly at fault for leaving the keys in it, door open and a sign saying "Please steal me", on the steering wheel, apparently.
Damn shoulda never let him go… shoulda whooped his ass then call the cops. Oh well 🤷🏼‍♂️
Wonder what a UFC stands for?
KNEES not PUNCHES.  Mainstream media at it again with the fucking FAKE NEWS.
Ha ha ha stupid.
Thieves....just a wee lesson for you all!.... Just imagine that everyone you go to steal from is a UFC fighter!!!! If that don't stop your criminal intentions then nothing will!
Good job Sir!
This is why I drive a manual.
Oh dang
The thief was really lucky that it wasn't Jake Paul instead
That was no beating
“UFC fighter pounds car thief”  *unzips pants*
(UFC FIGHTER POUNDS CAR THIEF) Me: Gross... oh wait. He beats him up, oh ok.
you have no more right to physically assault someone who stole your property than you do a stranger. your life is not in jeopardy,  and you can get prosecuted and sued.
im not a car person, but i still dont understand why people wants a keyless car tho. with the push to start button. i understand that you need a key near the car to start it but still. i dont get what is the problem to have a key.  and i dont understand people who dont lock their car... i mean, it's one of the first thing you supposed to learn in life, lock your shit.
HA HA
Soooo he rousts him out of the car, but the guy kindly put it into park?  Something weird with this.
I leave my car running with the door locked
JUDO is the take down and subdue art. A small man can hold a huge guy without harm if you're not afraid to get on the ground.
Never leaves the car running.
Also a good way to get yourself run over trying to grab the car as it’s fleeing!   Had a buddy in high school that was being a dumb teenager and was attempting a “gas and go”. The gas station owner thought it was a good idea to stop him by grabbing onto the truck, my buddy took off and dude fell under the truck and was run over.   Didn’t work out well for either of them… dude received serious life long injuries and my buddy received a serious felony before his life really began.
If the thief had locked the door as well he could have gotten away with it. They both need to learn to lock doors.
every girls dream😍 someone who can actually protect them .
My house got burgled once” the only things they left were shampoo, soap and toothpaste ! The dirty bastards !
Dude looks like the Easter island head
What dumbass leaves car running?
Maybe next time don't leave your KEYS IN THE CAR!!!
I regret that you didn't knock his arse out till the cops came...
He seen his bright yellow fanny pack and thought, easy target.
KARMA! 👍😉
He deserved his car being taken !what an idiot to leave his car running !!! And unlocked !!!OMG
😀😃😅
The fanny pack is the source, it’s what gives him power!
I would say he controlled the shit out of that scene
I would be more enraged by the 364 gas prices
Why do people not lock their car doors!? When you're driving to. Geezus.
Is that a fanny pack I see?
that "Sheesh" tho
Socially acceptable ass kicking? Must be my day.
I don't think it's fair to call this a "pounding". The UFC fighter used an appropriate amount of force to stop the thief, nothing more.  Good job on him
Welcome to Mecklenburg County dude it will happen again
Who TF leaves their car running, I guess he’s had one to many punches to the head.
Lock cars . Ppl are stupid stealing cars and it will make you look equally stupid . I saw a doordash driver car stolen in front of a shop while he just entered to pick up an order
Lesson 1: Never leave your car unlocked, Lesson 2: Lock your car when stepping out, Lesson 3: activate your alarm. This could have ended very badly because if the thief had a gun > body parts. SMH.
Definite knee strikes, not punches!
Americans don't lock their cars and it's very very funny to me because, that's a ticket to say steal my car. Why would the car manufacturers put a lock in the car and give you a key it they didn't want the cars to be locked. Try not locking your car in Nigeria and you'll never see it again.
So he can fight but he is just stupid for leaving his car running
Thief forgot to click click the door lol 😂
Sorry the UFC guy is what’s known as a fisherman, they leave their cars unlocked and running hoping for someone to come along and try to steal it, they then beat  the shit out of them for practice. He was giving that guy the same beat down he would give to an opponent. Lol I know because I used to do it myself.
Idk why people do that. They leave their car running while they go in the gas station. I hope every single one of their cars gets stolen. Idiots.
2weeks late..but kinda feels like poor guy got paid just to SLOWLY back out..smh...no offense MMA guy but it KINDA LOOK FAKE... #wenzURnxMATCH
He left the engine running ? That's dumb. When you own a nice car you are a magnet to thieves and this guy might aswell handed the keys to the thief.
Must be a kak fighter that he can only afford that car. Should of let the guy steal it.
Just as well that didn't happen in England, Jordan Williams would have been prosecuted for defending his property.
Imagine doing this to kamaru usman
Justice is swift and fuckin hilarious
"and never leave it running"   Ok, this guy just announced to the whole world how stupid he is.
''He only regrets one thing". That thing is not leaving your car running and unlocked?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 He's running away holding his eye!!!!🤣🤣🤣
Should have done more than that then held him for the cops
I leave my car running and lock my car!  Why? Because I have my dog in my car. How? I have a push to start car.
The inner ghetto of the reporter comes out as he says “throws hands”
they love it when you put them to sleep
Wait!,..that guy is obviously allowed to steal now right!!?...
This is why I tell people about leaving their cars on and walking away.
Thief: years of academy training wasted!
I love how he runs away holding his head that just got punched.
legend said that the thief still with headaches since that day😃
Only reason I leave me car running is its natural state of theft protection, being clapped out and manual transmission. No one's taking that bitch 😂
Something similar happened over here in the UK guy tried stealing a purse from two women. Turns out they weren't women thay was two professional cage fighters going to a mates stag do dressed up as women looks like he went 10 rounds with Mike Tyson if Mike Tyson was wearing brass knuckles
Could have saved all the trouble by locking the door in the first place
And that was he first time a grown ass thief ran off to his momma snitching
It i branoN Lee Master i
If u leave ur car running as if u want ur car stolen than chances are it will..dur duh duh dumbas
Why nobody is talking about that               " Sheesh" at the end
Is it a good idea, leaving his car unlocked,  unattended with the key in at a gas station?
He left the car running? Dumba$$
UFC fighter... dengkul nya medeni 😆👍
i want him as my guard
Can he discipline me too ?😌
Racist
Lesson to the thief: avoid cauliflower ears
Bro why u didnt broke hes hand or leg with a kick ass submission so he will not try to do that again at least for sonetime lol
I leave it running, but I lock it, if that’s ok?
He might be a good fighter  but Williams isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer,he left the keys in the ignition and car running,  what !!!!
Sheessssshhhh?!!!
if you're dumb enough to leave your car running, unlocked and unattended when you go into a shop then you're pretty much asking for it to be stolen
Did he just say *Sheesh*
You picked the wrong car, fool! Hey! Ey ey ey, hey!
Only a dumbass would not lock their car.
0:43 sheesh
The thief had some consideration, considering he stopped the car in order to get spanked lol
Love that the ufc fighter is wearing a fanny pack
Didn't see a punch at all little knee
i genuinely think people in US always leave their car unlocked, windows down, or maybe cars still running.
You let him go??????
this is what happens when idiots leave cars unlocked and running
Look at his ear.. guy been fighting
The one regret he has: wearing that damn fanny pack out in public!
why is there down votes? i am unable to understand, so these guys if their car is stolen they will not do anything
stupid enough to leave ya car running unattended,,,stupid enough to lose the car.
Taking all them punches killed all his brain cells… why the phuk u leave ur car running
Sheesh
To Anyone Saying He Got Off Easy - Please remember that UFC (and any other professionally trained fighter) can face charges for fighting people outside the ring if your life is not in danger - the fighter ran towards the robber, putting himself in "danger" (not really) so not a valid excuse to potentially do Jail time, so of course he's gonna play it off saying he didnt want to do more damage, however, the fact that he robber was holding his head immediately as he walked away, even with the adrenaline rush in his body, tells me this dude actually went ham on him but wont tell the camera. Probably cracked his whole face open.
We wish you were able to apprehend him too, but to do more damage
He is very kind... If he had gone just a little further, the guy may have been crippled whole life...
It looked to me that the thief was only yanked out of the car. I didn't see any punches or anything else. ??
The Car owner must be a stranger to the world… who the fuck leaves his car on to enter a store ?
“Throws a couple good punches” LOL the dude blasted him with a couple of swift knees to the face, that’s what’s up
🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Why do people leave their car running when they go into stores? Its just pure lazyness  isn't it?  there is no reason for it.  its dangerous and risky, you're asking for it to get stolen.   you hear the same thing over and over again someone stole my car I left it running with the keys in..  When I see it im always tempted to go in their car and  put it in gear and walk away and see what happens.
The guy who rob a police station... First time?
"wrong place at the wrong time"
MV rất hay, i like it 😝😍😪
Funny how many losers out there doing shady shitt !Deserves a beat down lol
Dumb enough to leave the car running. Not much luck if he met someone who try to steal his car was also a ufc fighter lol
Auto Door Locked to thief: Hows the knees?
Wow
he's lucky that theif had no hidden weapon, otherwise his ufc credentials don't mean as much
Never know who you are fucking with. Stupid games...
Imagine if a thief tries to steal Conor McGrecor's car :0
Lmfao
dumazz left his keys in his car? what a dip shit.
He forreal left his car unlocked and running? Good grief
Should have part ways with the suspect leaving him with brain damage.
Gas is 3.64?!! Keep voting Democrat!!!
Thief : Steels Khabib's car Khabib : Thank you brother
In instances such as this, "street justice" is much more effective and faster then the "justice system." Police know a car-jacker will be back on the street in no time and will certainly re-offend.
Maybe Dumb people like don’t be leaving ur car on and unlocked out there Idiot ( joe rogan ) beautiful knee to the body and some dirty boxing
Always, always, always . . . lock all vehicle doors and NEVER leave engine running . . . even for a nano-second when unattended by its driver. As seen time and again across the U.S. and regardless of the neighborhood, time of day or with others around,  a car-jacker WILL hijack a vehicle even with passengers in it.
Looks staged... why didn't the car keep moving after he was yanked out?   Surely the thief wouldn't have put it in park? Lol
Ufc=Honda civic?
What both are idiots! For taking a car, and for leaving a car running. Know you’re surroundings, there are places you can and there are places you can’t. There’s a difference between metropolitan and country living 😂
dude kneed his face 😂
We stealing cars in america now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♀️
In California, the obvious criminal would have been released from the jail before the jail and the arresting officer could even finish his processing paperwork, in the meantime the criminals first DA’s that we have here in the great state would go out of their way to prosecute the probably law abiding tax paying citizen who was just protecting his own property with no serious priors into an extremely unfair sentencing. I’m not joking this is not a joke this is very close to how things are being run here by the dems!
People are dumb this days thinking  of stealing car. You've  seen what happen to lil reese.learn
SEEMS FAKE.
This fighter guy lucky the thief didn’t have a gun.
The UFC fighter reacted perfectly.  He used enough force to stop the threat, but then didn't chase after him to fight more.  If he does, then he's the one that is breaking the law and he is the one that is going to get sued.
Ran away holding his eye😂🤣😂
You love to see it
He left his car running and unlocked? Dumbass.
sheesh
I think thats the reason why here in Australia driver will get a ticket if he leaves the car with the engine on.
790 and counting, car thieves are disliking this video. I hope his knee is fine, should have hit harder. I don't know why he let him go. UFC fighter should know how to grapple, put the f00ker in choke hold until he passes out.
Is your car worth getting shot or stabbed... These criminal junkie scum will cut your throat for 5$...
LOL he said learning a good lesson cracks me up is he left his car running with the keys in it all of that just because you going into Circle K or 7-Eleven or quick stop or come and go don't mean you supposed to do that I know you UFC fighter but bro
this guy really just said sheesh
Woulda been quicker if you just handed the would be carjacker the keys and said here I'll give you a 30-second head start try to steal my car, since you're an idiot that left it running in the first place
Stop leaving your cars running idiots
a year ago the headline would have read "dark skin white supremacist attacks innocent black man "  im glad the clowns at cbs showed a true story for once
What punches all I saw was wrestling and chucking the garbage out.
Why would you leave the keys in your car in the first place?
Thankfully the thief was too stupid to lock the doors
left his car running unlocked??  ok, smart fighter, dumb person.
Because the robber was not armed, other would be the story.
He should have kept him from walking away. That asshole needs to go to jail.
Lol he rubs his dumb little noggin walking away 🤣
My guy all he needed to see was his ears
Video wasn't as satisfying as I'd hope
The thief got lucky this time, next time person might have a gun or something.  More people are choosing not to be victims these days.
I clicked on this because thought it says KFC’s car.
Idiot.... you never know who is behind the wheel.😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Can't tell the difference from punches to knees lol
I Love it, that’s right kick his ass!!
He left his car running in the parking lot?
OOOOOOOHHHHHH, HES HURT
He ran off holding his head like the fuck did he hit me with.
Ahhhhhh... publicity stunt... News Advertising UFC? Okay... sure... right on... "Professional"
and he did it while wearing a fanny pack!  cool guy
Where I live people leave their cars running and the doors open in front of businesses and stores ALL OF THE TIME. I am shocked at how confident these people are!!  If only thieves knew, this would be their new hotspot
CBS is fake news
JESUS CHRIST loves y'all
It was at that moment the robber knew...he f***ed up. 🤣
What if the car was owned by deadly assassin what would happened next?
ah so he's one of those that leaves car running with keys in it .
Did the reporter just say “sheesh”
Why the fuck did he leave it running 🤣🤣🤣
fake, why the edit?
So many people get their cars stolen at gas stations and convience stores since they don't lock their doors. Thieves literally wait for you idiots to walk inside and drive away without issue. This thief just happened to pick the wrong car to steal lol
Reparations
Sheesh huhuh
Not much of a punch I guess he ran off no prob
The guy ran off no prob
This ufc fighter is driving a Honda 😂 fix the pay gap
I didn't see any punches...
Wtf was the keys in the car?! Stupid....
he's wearing a fanny pack too. adds insult to injury when you get your ass beat by someone in a fanny pack. he's probably wearing it just so somebody'll fuck with him.
Eliminate the risk for the next innocent citizen…….
Thats what you get the choke and call the cops while hes waking up
He would have been released without no issues.
Love the loud AF fanny pack
Home boy was rubbing his noggin while running away 😂😎
Should’ve put him to sleep
my man said sheeeeesh
But...BLM!
Lock the car. Take the keys with you. Now, see; no rocket science involved.
Make sure you leave the keys in your car.   This will increase the level of temptation on the part of the car thief,  so you can beat on him when he tries to steal the car.  Great plan.
Delta Variant to Vaccine 😩😫
How do I punch with my knees?
Well o mean if you leave your keys in the car and the car running with no one inside, you’re kinda asking for a criminal to steal your ride. People need to start using some common sense. I’m the criminals mind it was a “crime of opportunity”
Looks like a stage and didn't want to hurt the actor too bad lol
He should regret abother thing. Leaving his damn car unlocked.
"Ignorant Dick" for leaving it Running & Unlocked
weak.  that guy escaped to steal another day.  maybe even cause harm.
news anchor: sheesh Me: sheeeesh!
🤣😭 the guy ran away holding his head. He deserved much more...
Who leaves their car unlocked AND running? You’re an idiot to do that.
Sorry but he deserved to lose that car! What simp leaves their car running? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I think it was a bait car. Thief got trolled. Should be a show.
All kno he do ufc foreal by the puffy ears
I'd regret wearing the fanny pack too.
He wasn't using UFC, he was using Rex-Kwon-Do. BOW TO YOUR SENSEI !!!!
Didn’t even punish him... no different than when ya tell some junkie to quit going through the garbage
Fuk Denver got my Yukon jacked there too.. crack heads steal whips just to get across town. Too broke for the train. Pathetic
Its 2021 and surveillance video looks like its from the 80's........
Oooo hes racist. He assaulted the black man stealing his car.
At least the thief remembered to put it in park 😂
sheesh
What kind of imbecile leaves his car running and goes into the store?
lEaRn To LoCk YoUr CaR aNd NeVeR lEaVe It RuNnInG!!!!
God & Jesus forever & always my friends ❤️
Should never leave your car unlocked. Common sense at least I would think.
Stop lying you wanted more ass kicking time! We all did lol
Imagine getting a knee to the face by a man who wears a Fanny pack 😂
Violence is the answer
He thought it was as easy as in gta
Beautiful. Give this dude a measly. The only mistake he made was to let the thief leave the scene breathing.
Thief ran away to go and change his tampon.
Lock the damned car!!!!!!
So he can fight but he’s not very smart  He wants you to know common sense don’t leave your car running  I’m with the thief on this one people who leave their car running should lose it for a day
The only thing he should regret is wearing that fanny pack
To bad no 💀 was crushed.
All Wearing a bright yellow fanny pack!
Headline should read "Thief gets beat by man with fanny pack"
Leaves doors unlocked, say bye to car
If you leave your car unlocked and running you diserve to have it stolen. Might as well put a bow on it and write "to thief from me, happy birthday "
I was looking at the gas price 👀😓
Who the fook is that guy
Try taking the key out and locking your car next time. That often works.
as an insurance agent..that UFC fighter is a high risk to insure all the way around. drop coverage ASAP..
"Sheeesh"
If we chopped off thieves' right hand on TV, the message would start getting out. Make the 6 o'clock news more interesting.
And once again the hunted race lebron's cousin's trying to steal ...this is racism he is good Mama's boy just had a bad day and was trying to drive to relax
Driver should have made an 'Arrest Without Warrant,' and waited for the police to take him to jail! "Thou shalt not steal." Commandment #8
forget stealing, you really shouldn't leave your car running and outside of your sight period.
I don't understand people who leave the car running.
You need garbling practice
The hardest punch landed was $3.64 a gallon......
What idiot leaves their car running and unattended? Idiots that think they can take everyone… You might say “tough guys,” “MMA fighters,” but carjackers can always have guns, and usually MMA fighters don’t, so…good luck getting your car back if you’re dead 😆
Keys in car.  Running.  Unlocked.  Dumb.  But it's always good to see a bad guy get whomped on.
Would have liked to see a few more punches/jabs to the would be theif, but this is a good UFC fight for free.
Stupid story. If the bad dude gets choked out it be a good story to do.
Here's a tip big guy - quit leaving your car running in front.....
Knee punches huh
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The second I'm out of sight of my car it is locked every, single, time whether it's at the petrol station or at a friends house, and for a little extra fun I keep a baseball bat in the boot just incase.
That could have been Obamas son.
737 carjackers dislike this video.
And our next story, thug tries to rob UFC gym.
Did he say sheech?
I came to see a beat down. Instead he just looked as the dirtbag ran away. Disappointing.
When you see a guy with ears that look like a British persons bubble gum WALK THE FUCK AWAY !!!!  He didn't get them from the candy store he got them from hundreds of fights .
Respect the fanny pack!
Crap
Title just like Dhar Mann video
His head caught them hands !👊💢
Why did I get douch chills with that last line.... Don't leave your door unlocked and running.... Who does that? It's like a forty year old who doesn't wear a seat belt. Like... Do you think it's cute? Lol did you not grow out of that.... I'm not touching you... Phase when you bring your finger close to someone. Did your mom not spank you after that and instead say... Oh he's so smart. That's a sign of intelligence..... Anyways weird. It actually made me feel more for the guy robbing cars.
Much like leaving your wallet full of cash on the bar and going to the restroom.  Of course someone's going to steal it!
Why would he leave his car unlocked and running.  His fault.  Heyyy lol
only an idiot goes into a store "for a minute" and leaves their car running. WTF is wrong with people? are people too lazy to literally TURN THE KEY TO OFF? (obv im not calling a UFC fighter lazy, its a lot of work to be in the UFC) i also dont get why i see so many people sitting in their cars leaving it running for longer than a minute (in the summer)...have they not heard of pollution?
Daaa gee Tennessee, maybe Don't leave your keys in the car.
Guess knees are the new punches.
Try locking your car and not leave it running!! What a Clown.. it's a pity the thief didn't get away and show ole big boy who is the fool..
News reporters are freaking morons!
So fanny packs are cool again?
Thief : I am gonna play GTA Driver : I am going to play EA UFC
...and which ethnic background did the thief come from...?
The way he ran away was the best part.
What the world needs now is more UFC carjacks
"You picked the wrong car fool!"
im guessing they edited out the punches?
That's the difference between an MMA fighter and a martial arts practitioner who only know how to pose moves.
When you steal a car in GTA and the owner kicks your butt.
Only regret: didn't get any teeth for his collection
You don’t regret the Fanny pac
Love it. I'd like to know why mixed martial arts aren't taught to both boys and girls in schools as part of school curriculum, lets face it nobody seems to know how to deal with crime in this day and age, turning the other cheek is too soft, an eye for an eye is too vicious and begets violence, sharia law is too harsh, you don't go around chopping someone's hand off for stealing a car, in Britain the police just give people a crime number and expect the insurance to pay out, completely missing the point.
He got kneed in the forehead
Should’ve locked the door.....
the Normal  suspect, ive seen the same typ in a million video's what wrung with them?
Most disappointing video of the day.
🥊🥊🥊🥊🤼‍♂️🏋🏾‍♂️
seemed like the guy was only loaning it to go to the local drive through coz they wont serve pedestrians.... i'm sure he would've brought it back. might have even filled the tank too.... but you beat the shit out of him so now we'll never know.
Dam good thing he didnt have a gun or he'd be gone.
Lock your car next time!!!
Why can’t they steal the hoopty rides like mine! Steal Mine! I want a new car!
who leaves their car running when they go into a store anywhere???
Sheeeesh
"Sheesh" lol
What a shame the thief got away easy....im sure a real MMA fighter will make sure the thief gets knocked out or go to sleep till the cops arrive...this is the reason why this UFC fighter will never win a title fight in his life...
He got beat up by a guy wearing a fanny pack.
The reporter needs to learn the difference between knees and punches...
thank god the thief did not watch ASP.. or else he would have lock the door and efficiently used the car as his protection.. 😆
He f*cked his head up with those knees 🤣
Lock your car even when you pump gas!!
Do people really leave their cars running like that just to save 2 seconds it takes to start a car up?  Also, stealing a UFC fighters car, worst luck. These guys are very well trained so they're way less likely to be afraid of a fight. The average guy is afraid because it is unknown. Fighters do this every day. They know how poorly the average man can fight. If you train MMA for about 6 months you are already tougher than the average guy. If you train for 2yrs you should be able to take about 99 percent of men out there assuming you are average size.
Palooka leaves car running while he's in the store...you should have your car stolen.  IDIOT.
Man he asked for that. Who leaves their car running and unlocked??
Who leaves their keys in the ignition in the first place?!
U can hear the brain damage in his voice sadly. Still on point lol
But when the police do this....
That Thief had a come to Jesus meeting delivered to him by the owner of that car.... And I'm wondering if he listened?
Good.....! Now you know what to do Next time Unless you want to punch again Lol.
Gta 😂😂😂
Why do people still leave their cars running when they get out?  What do you expect to happen?  People steal shit, that's why we lock our doors to our houses.
Love how he's holding his head as he runs away in his dirty diapers!!! I friggin hate two bit thieves!!!   NYC 🤟
Pounds 🙄
Guy just probably left his car running and waited by the window for his opportunity to smash a piece of shift.
He let the guy go? WTF?
how's the thief not locking the door?  Gotta be your first move if you're boosting a car
Lol who leaves the car on
I always lock my car, and I always think "I've got my keys in my hand" before I close the door. It's foolproof.
Guess Colorado is less liberal than the West Coast states.
No broken bone??viewer dissapointed 😂😂😂
That why u need to lock your car door before going to the store
I knew the comments would be legendary 😂
The thief is lucky: 1. The driver gave him easy access. 2. The fighter was "off duty" 3.  The driver let him go.  EDITED: Humor people, ever heard of it😉
Got him a little headache for his trouble 🤣👍👍🇺🇸
that was a devastating knee to the head.....
What a looser
Why on earth did he leave the keys in the car like that in the first place?
Too bad he couldn't do that in his last fight.
Sheeeeeeeeesh
Lock your car.
that ufc dood is lucky... crim coulda backed up over him with that door. or shot him...
kids, If you leave your car running while running an errand make sure to leave your pet snake on the passenger seat
Don’t need to b a fighter. I have the good sense to turn off & lock my car.   DAH.
WTF, who leaves the car running or unlocked beside this fella.
I've seen people leave their car running going into 711. I swear it's the dumbest thing I have ever seen.
Dodgy news would blame the white guy for fighting back because the third was black.
i was hoping to see a headlock or choke..😟
KARMA... You get served what you deserve!!! Wonderful! 😆😆😆
Rule #1 for criminals, don't fuck with the guy wearing a fanny pack. It might just have a 357 magnum in it, but at the very least it's a guy with enough grit to not be ashamed to wear one.
What is important do not kill it's ok to scare him away but do not kill if it doesn't need he has no weapon on hand just scare him away you are a champion show professionalism don't act like a criminal be a pro life killing is for emergency situation only if necessary it's also SOP For all officers across the country if they not follow they get charged
Dude know he was f up when he see those cauliflower ear
Lol the democrats are going to charge the ufc guy with a hate crime
but of course any normal person would possibly get an assault charge.
Dipshit left his running car outside a convenience store.  It deserved to be taken.
Well it’s common sense to not leave the car running and just leave it not attended
sheeeeeesh
Wow. I drive the same car as a UFC fighter. That's nice. xD
That fanny pack go hard.
Don't leave the car running😑
My only regret would be not being able to use my jujitsu skills to subdue and destroy this individual  until he cried like a baby on national television  I however don't possess those skills but if I did ,that would be awesome 😎
looks like solid knee to face !
How did he get to start the car
ufc fighter?? who the fook is that guy??
that title would fit in a out of context video.
Thumbs down for the media, but thumbs up for the story!
Who in their right mind leaves their car running unattended these days, we all know that is just inviting this exact thing to happen.
The real crime is a professional fighter is driving that civic
Never feel sorry for dumb people, im this case both. Y tf would u leave your car unlocked?
*sheesh*
Jordan williams in the ufc never heard of her😂😂😂😂
I’ve never heard of this ufc fighter
and the dude has a fanny pack.
That "sheeesh tho...lol
next stop don’t lock your apt door and leave on vacation
“Who the fock is that guy”
Never steal a car from a ufc fight.
He didn’t lock the car and he left it running and he’s worried someone else is that dumb?
So he was able to walk away.
Last time this idiot leaves his car alone while it’s on and unlocked.
vehicle running with doors unlocked, a few head shots too many.
Why would you just let him stumble away...
Dino care?
When you aint making money in UFC you try and pull an insurance scam😂 Oh no I left my car unlocked and I also left it running. "Oh crap that have good cameras here"
If you leave your car running doors locked or unlocked doesn't matter and that car is used in a robbery or kill someone in an accident it's your fault hundred percent lazy ass not turning your car off because it's too hot outside or too cold outside.   That's a tough guy ?  And if UFC fighter can't hold on to a criminal with no weapons then who the hell can? Again he is responsible for not holding that guy for the police for whatever crimes he does from now on.   That's a tough guy?    No referee no one cheering him on, no pay day , then just another self serving coward.  He just needed to do the right thing for the next person who doesn't have the ability to overpower that criminal.  I've seen old women try harder to defend their purses and old men get involved in a crime unrelated to them and hold the bad guy for the cops or at least give him a beat down for some punishment, This guy walked away and was  stealing another morons car ten minutes later.  Shame.
Would have been nice if he did MORE damage.  Thieves should NOT be treated "humanely".
Wait you need another human to tell you to lock your car and never leave it running???😹😹😹😹😹
UFC fighter risking his life for a car worth about 15k not that the price matter should be the title smfh!
Only UFC can get away with wearing a Fanny pack
Nah it's almost 2022, even white suburban people should know better by now... That leaving your doors unlocked stuff been played out & please don't try this UFC hero BS in Chicago, just give your car up & live to see another day. Go file your little police report & call your insurance company but trying this hero BS in Chicago is basically a death sentence.
At least he put it park in the middle of his beatdown 🤣
The car thief got what he deserves, but leaving the car running in front of a convenience store, while getting some snacks or coke, that's the BS I see in my area all the time.
And that's why you lock the car as soon as you get in. Driver's ed 101 or they not teaching that any more?
I thought the plot twist was the thief learned it was manual and he can't drive stick 😂
If I was involved in MMA I would be embarrassed that I couldn't take down a petty thief.
Let’s not forget about anthony smith
Thief really put it in park
I can beat people up, but I'm not smart enough to shut my car off and lock it
this guy is a fighter and could not hold the bitch for the police?
Bro $3.64 for diesel 😪 i paid 4.56 last night but thats california for you
lol
“No to do more damage”  translates “finish him off”😄
*You picked the wrong car, foo~!*
Baltimore Native here and the fact that the News anchor said “Throw Hands” get instant respect from me 🤣
Threw a few too few
Fanny pack!!!! Yeah don't mess with him bruh
them new civics taking over you walk down the street you’ll see 20 of em at least
Dang, I want this guy around if I'm ever in trouble. 💪
This thief shouldn’t known is was game over when Williams chased him down while wearing a yellow Fanny pack.
This is the moment he knew, he f uped.
I wouldn't look down on the guy for throwing a couple dozen more punches
Is that a faneypack?  What
Let's get this lined up for a pay-per-view match! I'll watch
This is new to me. Never knew you can punch with your knees
Hope this videos teaches everyone to always know that someone or something is watching you or your belongings!
Leaving your car running while you go into a store??  I think this guy intentionally baited this theif just to be able to beat him up OR this owner is just plain stupid.
Love love this.
Luckily door was unlock...if it was locked, then it would be different story....
The UFC fighter needs some brain power,  NEVER leave a car running!
The title is kinda gay
I would shit myself
Gas is $3.64 a gallon yikes
Call me paranoid but I take my key and lock my doors even when pumping gas lol
How the hell do you leave you car turned on and unlocked?
He left his car running... glad both parties could learn a lesson and no one got badly injured.
Dude ran holding his head (and I'm thinking, was he screamin' "Mama!!!")
🤣 He left his car unlocked and running!!?!🤣 So, he fights for a living and does incredibly stupid things in his daily life... he and the criminal are no different, they should be friends.
Ufc fighter? Guy was still standing what a soft 💅🧚‍♀️punches.
If he has a gun youre dead..knock him out idiot ufc figther. You have skill but your not smart enough your life will be done😂😂😂
Just lock the car and don’t leave it running.
xD I think I just heard the reporter saying sheeeesh 😂
i liked the left knee to the head
LOL!!! Who leaves their car unlocked and running in these crazy times.  🤣
so he left the car running...lol   was that a bait car!!
Wouldn’t have been able to do shit if the thief central locks d car . Simple physics
M A N...
I don't get why people don't lock their car.  I see it all the time and it's in a high crime city.
Did that news nerd just essay sheesh?  Wtf
He sounds a little punch drunk.  Maybe taking some damage in the ring.  Good job though.
Denver!! 😂
Thanks nate
I read thief tries stealing KFC by mistake. Now Im disappointed.
“Today I learned not to leave my car unlocked with the keys in the ignition, and a charted map with directions to my house.”
Why would you leave your car running with the door unlocked? Hopefully the ufc fighter learns from this
If you leave your car running.... You deserve to have it stolen.
why the hell would he leave the keys in the car? its not that hard to take out the keys and lock the car...
Looks like he just pulled him out.  No punches lol
Those two knees to the head probably did some long term brain damage.
Never mess with a guy who is wearing a fanny pack.
He sounds like Joe Biden very incoherent
Fanny pack
These guys are too trusting and honestly it’s sad that we can’t be this trusting to leave our cars unlocked and running if we have to make a quick 1-2 minute stop
0:25 - What punches? He didn't throw any punches.
Duh that's why I lock it before going inside even if I am paying for anything
Left it running so he could do this to someone one day lol jk
He had Sorry parents that didn't teach him the Value of Work !
Looks like the idiot parked his car running, come on now... Youre not at home hey!?
Wow that was the quickest whooping I've ever seen!!!
Thief sees opportunity,  owner sees solution. Impulsive society. Car owner criminally charged with assault, thief fined for joy riding.   Impulse drive jack off. Aye aye captain.
Nice one putting all your chat words over the video!!!
He was a Black ?
didn't hit him enough
Also, how about locking your fucking car!
How to beat a Ufc fighter? You don't.
I see zero punches
tried doing the same for someone else ended up hitting a telephone pole an shattered my left leg 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
He left his car open & running. Maybe he’s had too many fights & lost all his brain cells.
It’s the Sheesh for me 😂
I used to train with Jordan in NorCal, nicest guy ever.  Glad he came out safe on that, crazy people out there.
How a ufc fighter driving a civic Dana white must not pay then
Wut do this newscaster know bout throwin hands ?! 😅😂🤣😭
To be fair to the thief no ufc fighter should be driving that car lol it’s nice but not millionaire shit is it 😂
Thankfully it was all recorded on a stop motion animation security camera.
Yes 👏👏👏👏
Why let him run off
Some people just have too learn the hard way
Excellent!!!!!!!
If he was only smart enough to put his keys in his pocket.
I'm surprised the guy didn't get arrested for beating that guy up lol
that is the most corporate "sheeesh" ive ever heard.
This news anchor dropped 'SHEESH' 😳.
Hahahhahah lock ur doors
Im expecting a knockout smh, im disappointed
I’m pretty sure he was gonna being the car back…what a nice man
This is the reason they give you keys when you buy a car   .....instead of a push button when you start it
only an idiot leaves the car running unattended.
first rule:ask the owner what is his occupation first before stealing his car!
Lol he wantted that civic
U.K. Insurance companies will NOT payout on a policy if the keys are left in a unoccupied vehicle, let alone in the ignition.
yah man, why did he not lock the car? just takes a few seconds to turn off the engine and then lock the car
in malaysia,if u punch a thief who steal ur car,u will be punished too
This happends in GTA when you steal a car and don't take off
could you imagine being that thief…? jesus christ, seeing cauliflower ears running straight toward you. makes my hairs stand on end thinking about it.
So this UFC fighter left the key in the ignition and running? Okay.
In the karate world, the car owner lost the fight before it began.  Too late. If you left your key in car with engine running  that is your lost fight right there.
well nobody ever said UFC fighters were smart I think you took one too many hits to the Head letting the guy get away leaving his car running how stupid
I’ve never understood people who leave their car running, like come on your asking for it !!!
He will lose everything in the lawsuit. Let them take the car. The government is here to protect criminals.
So we not gonna talk about how the news anchor said “throw hands” and “sheesh” 😂
Why would you leave your car running? In Australia you leave your running when you get petrol, can't even talk on your phone at the pump
Looks like Josh from “the Challenge”.
So did he hotwire the car or were the keys left in it?
Locking your car is basic common sense.
Where's the referee? Illegal knee just smack his opponent's face. Minus 3 points definitely.
Damn...3.64 a gallon about 2.95 here in Tucson.
Robber is lucky it wasn't Mike Tyson.   Mike's a biter...
This looks like a hate crime, what if the African American needed the car to sell it so he can feed his family? He should have let him take his car at least this is what the Democrats and Liberals tell us.....
Mid August 2021 Just learning “Don’t leave your engine running”, and “Lock your doors”, when you get out of your car. WoW, how would I had been able to live the rest of my life, not knowing this? DUHHH!
UFC FIGHTER DRIVING A HONDA CIVIC
I call bullshit... no professional ufc fighter wears a man-purse
Why did he leave his car keys in the car in the first place? Can’t believe people can be that stupid.
Wait what? He left his car running with doors unlocked? What duh!
Always add some form of GPS tracker to your car.  It's worth the piece of mind.
This helps me believe I could survive three seconds against Mike Tyson.
Question. Why did he wait until the owner came out to try to peel off? 😌
Not a single punch was thrown.  Grabbed him and pulled him out of the car…that is all.
GTFO the dude left his car running because he was daring someone to try him. What idiot doesn't know to lock their car?    "I lEaVe My CaR uNlOcKeD aLl ThE tIMe" Congratulations, Karen. Not everyone lives in Austin, TX.
Moral of the story-- Never Fk  with someone with cauliflower ear! 😆
CNN: “hate crime caught on camera. B L M demanding answers as oppressed young man trying to get groceries for his mom gets savagely beaten”
Clearly this PROFESSIONAL FIGHTER iz an IDIOT...leaves $100K car running w/ da keys in it......👀 WHATEVER....
Ehh. I would of done more to him if I was a ufc fighter, not just a punch in his head.
What's the issue! He is a car thief but he identifies as the cars owner. Haven't you people learned anything in this day and age?
I blame these thieves on the Cult Media and their Puppet biden!
I leave my car running outside the gas station all the time.. I just trust my gearbox that much
People know people steal cars,what's in them,leaves it running,here you go, free car,just filled it up to.
It's a hard knock life out there.....
Who the hell is that guy? - Conor mcgregor
Koschek by decision
Sheeeesh!!@
If only ufc has an academy….
What if perp had gun
The UFC fighter went easy on the thief. He only threw a couple of knees and punches. He should have increased the intensity and the rate of hits f
Call an ambulance, but not for me
Him: "Shesh"  Me: SHEEEEEEEEEEESSSHHHH
Dummy left his car running ad unlocked? This guy is definitely not a  Rhodes Scholar. No wonder he's fighter. 🤷‍♂️
Thief could of just stepped on the gas!  Looks like he even left it in park for the owner before being pulled out.
what if the guy had a blade or a gun? i don't think his ufc skills would of mattered anyway.
Crap! I read the UFC as KFC and wondered what a KFC fighter does?
Poke his eyes out next time…..just say it as an accident in the police report.
Imma go rob Mike Tyson
GTA scene
Not enough carnage for me. He got off way too light. Hats off to the UFC man with some heart and skills.
LOL A thief on every corner in USA the United States of Anarchy.
Ur lucky the bad guy didn’t have a weapon or he could have died for his stupid car.
wait a second, he left his car running at a gas station unlocked?
He literally didn’t do anything hardly but pulled him out of the car maybe getting couple knees in that hardly did anything then let the criminal get away
Karma at its finest.
Bullshit. You know you wanted to put hands on that fool. Wasnt my car and i want to ground and pound him. The courts arent doing a damn thing about it. Put some love taps on em and they might think twice before pulling that crap again. Id have finished out the rest of my day practicing on that two legged punching bag.
this season of bait-car is going to be awesome.
Oh come on, I was expecting or at least hoping for more of a butt whooping or at least a hold until cops showed up. Although maybe it's best he didn't. Runs the risk of getting himself in trouble now a days & if the guy pulled a knife he didn't see or something things could have gotten pretty messy.  Either way the punk at least got a little sense knocked into him. Unfortunately the only lesson he probably learned was to be sure to size up the victim first before trying to steal their car.
here, let me introduce you to my knee
that was very  poetic!
Running your car while it's parked produces 20x more pollution than if the car was traveling at 30 mph. Such a small action to save money, our environment, and stop thieves.
$3.64 a gallon !!!????!!!!
Go Jordan he deserves an a..kicking.
Who leaves their car running at a gas station though? You deserve to have your car stolen lol
Who the fuck leaves their car running unattended? Just give it to a homeless person if you're that damn lazy. Also, it's illegal, at least in my state.
I wanted to see him knock him out.
The UFC should be able to sue everytime someone calls some random MMA guy a UFC fighter.
I thought he was gonna say he regrets that he didn't KO the guy hahahaha
Too bad he didn't break the thief legs.
The joke is on the UFC fighter for not securing his property regardless of excuses.
“Throws a few good punches” as he is landing knees…
The fanny pack 😂
At least he s got a history to tell to his friends  when he goes back . Legend says he keep running in the hood till this day 😂
If you kill criminals there will be no crimes, GOD.
Wait was the car running? Lol
I can understand not locking it but leaving it running? Come on man how do you live in America and leave your car running?
Same lesson learned by both: Lock the damn doors.
Poor black, sympathy
Are we STILL telling ppl to LOCK DOORS and not leave cars running?  - ... then your car needs to be stolen
I didnt want to see the clip, cos I knew it's gonna be really ugly for the thief.
Chances are most of us have never fought before and imagine ourselves doing this to a robber😂
Ran away crying like a little bitch for his mommie, no doubt.
The real crime here is that fanny pack...
Imagine getting your ass kicked by a dude wearing a fanny pack...
I've grown up in bad neighborhoods my entire life. I would never dream of leaving my car running lol. Everything is always on lockdown!
Lol the way he was holding his head running away! *"Aahhhhhh!!"* 🏃🤦🏿🤕
Pat I would like to solve this puzzle.....
Same people ...that's what u get!!!
“ lock your car and never leave it running “ ……. Thanks for such wisdom, life changing, that is…….
Stupid thing to do, he could of been shot and killed for a car.
Lucky guy- still got his car and didn’t stop a gutful of 9mm.
Now this is a ufc fighter I can show respect seems like a humble man.
Nice lesson..😃🇺🇸
I would NEVER leave my car unlocked WITH keys inside, UNLESS I was a UFC fighter! 😬Not even in my own driveway. I just don’t trust no bitch!
good idea..shut off car and lock it...
I guess I was expecting more...
The owner of the car is the perp, and the car thief is the victim, according to Liberal logic. The owner of the car also needs to be charged with assault, be fined and jailed, as well as pay the car thief compensation for his pain, suffering and humiliation, according to Liberal logic, with the full backing of the MSM and Dem party politicians.
Lock your damn car moron. Seriously people out there will steal anything, but if you lock your car it won't happen like this! Make them work for the car.
This happened to Gatche too in a famous mugshot showing the dudes face swole up!
In GTA, when you didnt get too far.
That news caster said Sheeeeeesh!  🤦‍♂️
The UFC guy is all brawn and NO brains. You don't EVER! leave your car running while you're in a store. NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND BECAUSE THIS KIND OF SHIT CAN HAPPEN. What if the robber had a gun......bye bye UFC chump!😱
KNEES* OBVIOUSLY KNEES!! 🤦‍♂️
Honestly if u leave ur keys in your car its fair game.
he was dragged hike a little bitch!
you left the car running. This is on you pal.
pro tip: lock your car when you aren't around
He ate dudes knee like he hadnt had a meal in weeks
0:44 Sheesh
this is BS - the door was unlocked, and the keys were in it?  the UFC fighter deserves to have his ride stolen if he's that stupid
Looking for the news report UFC fighter arrested after racist attack.  Surprised I’m not seeing it.
At least the thief was nice enough to put the car to “P” before he gets his ass kicked.
You need a gun
I call it fake
What a baffoon
He’s not the brightest because he left his keys in a running car… idiot.
I’ve never seen him in the octagon 🤔
tacticool fanny pack. love it
Dude at least break his nose 😑
Democrats want the UFC fighter charged with assault and a mural of the carjacker put up in the Capitol.
Cauliflower ears. Never ever steal from, interrupt, bother, or otherwise piss off a cauliflower ear....
One for the good guys!!!
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
Good move by the guy to stop a their. Bad move leaving it running in a gas station parking lot. In a lot of places you are at fault if you leave your car running and someone steals it.
Punches? Those were knees.
You know if people would stop leaving their cars running that would solve 90% of these thefts.
Never mess with a dude wearing a fanny pack.
Dude would have shot him to get away if he had a gun don’t try this pls!!!!
"is that u dad?"
ALL CAR THIEF HAD TO DO WAS LOCK THE DOORS BEFORE HE DROVE AWAY....  WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TIME TO GET AWAY.  ARE THERE ANY SMART THIEVES OUT THERE?  GLAD THE MMA FIGHTER GOT HIS CAR BACK.
You did not beat him up enough.
I don't know who is more stupid?  The guy who leaves his car running with the keys inside or the guy who got his ass kicked?
If you held him for the police or not, this carjacker would have been out doing the same thing the next day.
The only crime here is gas being 3.64 in Denver
Bum ass dudes
Real Life gta
Let him off to easy should of kicked him in the face first.
In this fucked up world the owner will probably get a visit from the gestapo police. 😡
Nobody actually leaves their keys in and car running, do they? Probably deserve it if you do.
herb dean fault
This fighter is a nice guy , you know very well he could have done much much worse to the car thief
Threw a few good punches? U mean knee's my guy.. he said here sir drink from my knee
Dude got manhandled fo the first time ever… he walking away solemnly with his hand on his head….
RESPECT THE MOTHER FUCKING FANNY PACK!!  I keep telling yall don’t Fck with a G in a hip pack. He’s either crazy, dangerous or both. Every. Time.
Criminals suck......but who the heck leaves their keys and car running in 2021?
"Always lock your car and never leave it running.."   SMH.....is this what happened? Open invitation.
When you have more brawn than brains:
Ol’ boy ran off like Red in “Friday.”
And now he has learned the true meaning of pain.
THOSE 2 QUICK KNEE STRIKES OPEN HIS FACE UP! BUT BE MORE CAUTIOUS ⚠️ WHAT IF HE HAD A GUN?
Only a lazy moron leaves their car running and walk away.. UNATTENDED!!
I could not leave my shit running … EVER I don’t trust NONE
Sadest part about this story is the reminder we have to lock everything and never leave it running , just a little over 20 years ago id be sitting in the parking lot regardless if the shopping place as a kid and folks leave the car running and the doors unlocked , a simple " dont touch a damn thing " was said and 20 years later im here to talk about it multiple times this occured and had nothing but a few waves and smiles posted towards me while sitting there , o wow the good old days.😄 people say this day an age dont do that maybe dont do it in this day but as far as age goes its not the planets problem how old it gets due to this ignorance of somone stealing a car its pure irresponsible and childish maybe the age factor should be pointed towards criminals actin like little kids in a candy store .
LEGEND HAS IT.... THE THIEF IS STILL HOLDING HIS HEAD 😲👊🏼🤣👊🏼 LET THAT BE A LESSON TO THE THIEVING SCUM 🤡
REALLY?! Your only regret is you wished you apprehended him?! How about that you left your vehicle with your keys in it and running?!
who goes into a convenience store...or ANY store and leaves their car unlocked or running....u deserve to get jacked if you that stupid.
Well done Jordan. Glad the dirtbag didn't have a gun though.
Bucket list:get kneed by UFC fighter
Another  criminal     AKA  Joe Biden  BLM   supporter
I hope I never get kneed I'n my face
prob smashed nose with one of the knees
Mans said sheesh
Honestly he shouldn’t have let him go like that. Gave him an opportunity to shoot him if he had a gun.
Mommy!
Don’t leave your keys in the car when you get out
I never understood people who just leave their car running in parking lots and unlocked.
Talking about censorship - YouTube deleted my previous comment because I said that it appears that most carjackings are done by ebony men (I actually used a different word.).  It is unfortunate when we are not free to express our thoughts and opinioins.
“A would be car thief gets a ‘bowl’ lesson…” ?
I doubt you hurt the car owners knee too much by slamming your face into it like that.😂
I watched this video to root for the UFC fighter, but seriously, how dumb do you have to be to leave your car unlocked and running????
Let’s be real, the Fanny pack was the reason the dude was fearing for his life…..
locking your car and not leave it running should be..... pretty obvious - guess not for Americans though
Took a knee to the face lol
If a man is brave enough to wear a Fanny Packet out in public, you don’t f*** with them.
that guy running while rubbing his forehead LOL!
Can I get a "Sheeesh" 0:43
no its not the thiefs fault. its the m&m dudes fault for not locking his car. he should be arrested for being an accomplice. (a republican once said that)
Why the hell did you leave your keys in the car, running? People do this all the time and they get what they deserve
Both of them learnt their lessons. 🤣🤣🤣
Better to call the police, than to risk your life for a car. You can’t punch your way through bullets. The UFC fighter was very lucky.
I don't understand people that leave their cars running while they go into a store... sometimes I think I'm overly paranoid because I don't walk 3 feet from my car without clicking the lock a bunch of times, but then I see something like this and I'm glad I do. I'm glad this guy at least got in a few good punches to the head but it's too bad he let the loser get away. It's a shame there are so many thieves that we can't step away from our property for even a second without the threat of it being taken.
#BLM
I had no Idea there were still Sinclair gas stations. I haven't seen one in about 50 years.
The reporter  said " he threw punches"... man never saw one!!
any time i catch a tweeker stealing i try to make their knee fail. a theif in a wheel chair makes the world a better place and most people dont see a leg kick coming.
Lesson for drivers: lock the doors. Lesson for thieves: lock the doors.
Dude has his fanny pack on too hell yeah
Thats not a black man. -BLM
Now that’s capital punishment at its best
He had every right to put dude in the hospital. this don't happen where I'm from because if you get caught... night night for good
I guess both of them learned a valuable lesson.  UFC fighter learned not to leave car running. Thief learned its not a good idea to steal a car that is left running. See folks, today we all learned something.
Fella was bleeding from his head from those knee strikes!
Publicity stunt, who puts a can in park, as they are being violently pulled from it?
Was he wearing a fanny pack
lol. this shit funny
0:44 man's said sheesh in lower case
You know how you handle these things don't leave your vehicle running while you run into the store. Have to be really lazy can't even shut off the vehicle.
Dana pay them more so they don’t drive Honda civics
Bruh! Everyone should have gotten the memo to not leave your car running at the gas station by now!!!!! Come on man!!!
Who leaves their car running like that. What an idiot. Think he’s been hit in the head one too many times🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️.  No common sense here
Nice he got a good backsiding
I don’t even leave my car running in my driveway xD just gives me anxiety
All I seen was a complete dimwit leaving his car running unattended. Playing stupid games then winning stupid. But overall he did kick his ass. And it was pretty awesome.
Sweet fannypack Brahh
I'll never understand people who leave their car running when going into a store.
I've never heard of his name in the UFC. What's his professional record?
People leave their cars running while they go inside a store? This ain’t your small home town in the middle of nowhere dummy.
The guy should be arrested
Whenever I see a crime. I also want to see the criminal take the room temperature challenge
Thing about it, There's Actually a Shortage of Workers, and Companies are Desperate to Hire.  At least TRY! SMH!
His regret was def. not being able to do more damage! 🤣
I leave my car on and unlock with my two 95+ pounds dogs in there, I wish someone would try
The equivalent of stealing John Wick's car and uhh....killing his dog.
he's lucky the thief didn't go all the way back dragging his ass back and potentially killing him in the process.
both men are so STUPID for not locking the door
Who in the hell leave their car running and key in there. One of the stupidest thing I ever seen. If your car get stolen that on you. I never unlock my car and leave it running even if it only take me 5 mins to do something.
TKO
Love the bad guy running away holding his head!
Well done mate.
That looks like a 2019 civic sport.. or similar model which should be push to start.. no keys needed to be in ignition.. just as long as they’re within range.., in your pocket... could walk out and car should eventually stop running soon after being away for too long.. I had wondered if thief’s could take off in the car without the key... maybe he left the key fob in the car too?  I have done that where I leave the car on and walk away but I have my key with me always and lock the doors
" Who dare to beat our good son ? He often bring more money for our home " !!!
“A would-be car thief”? By definition he is a thief!   Journalism is as authentic as it used to be!  Playing with words instead calling them out properly!
LMFAO
Left his car unlocked and run?  Hahahahaha
your bad for not locking your car and leaving it running
Punches? he was literally kneeing him in the head
Hopefully ufc fighter learned his lesson tho
He got his ass dusted good shit
In all fairness to the criminal, that bright yellow Fanny-pack was just screaming that your a weak man prime for pickin
Ah he gonna cry on the way home!!!
why would anyone leave their car running?? unless theres another person or people with you in the car, it should always be off, and locked
Thanks Biden! 349 per gallon !   For fuck sakes when are you people going to start bitching.
Thieves must learn first thing to do after getting into the car is to lock the doors
Did the reporter just say sheesh
One of the benefits to have push to start. 😉
Damn man. Where's the  jujitsu   to apprehend the fugitive? That's The bases of mma
Sheesh
When you see the Cauliflower ears... just be like "My bad" .. and walk away.
All that for a Honda😂😂😂😂
Wonder if this guy ran home holding his head. Saying I'm going to report you on YouTube
Looked like he was just jogging to me.
If it weren’t for people like him leaving the car running, you wouldn’t be watching this video!
Why would you leave your car unlocked and running at a gas station?
Love to see these lowlifes get what they deserve.
Sheesh
I never understood why people are so comfortable going into a gas station and leaving their cars unlocked and running. How does that benefit or convenience you?
probably cured the guy of his car thieving addiction!  lol
Did no one hear the reporter saying sheeeesh
Learn lesson is LOCK your car when you go to store....
Glad it had a Happy Out come. You know if the car thief would have had a gun he would have Used it on the Car Owner.  Sometimes a good ol ass whooping is the perfict lesson. And FYI if the cops would have done this, you would have a March on your hands and heads would roll. You Dems that vote for these Soft on crime Mayors and Diversity Hire police chiefs. This is what you get.
Wow $3.64 a gallon!!?? What about the XL pipeline ?
Whooped his ass with a Fanny pack on  And those knees were crisp
who's this UFC fighter, they didn't mentioned his name.
That same guy is telling all his friends how he beat up a UFC fighter but have him his car back hahaha
Yeah.lol why leave it open and running dude? Your asking for what happened
Two dumbs giving each other a lesson in life.
The best way is just to blast their heads off with a .45
Was he really wearing a fanny pack ?
All the UFC fighters live in Denver bro don’t even think about it
The other obvious lesson here is never confront someone stealing your car. This story could have ended much worse if the perp had a weapon.
Joggers got to jog
Black lives Matter
When you fuck around  you just might find out. Should've made his punk ass never walk again. Thing is you never know who is carrying these days, so let him try on my truck and he ain't running away from that shit.
Who else has no idea who he is lol
He should be regretting that Fanny pack
Put blades in set
He regrets one thing… that he was wearing Fanny pack lol
I dont think that car is locked
I bet his gimmie gimmie father is proud his son got his arse kicked on TV  Ha! hA!
I’m not sure who’s the bigger idiot of the two?
Stupid ass leaves keys in car
👍🏼🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How to fail at GTA by *Rockstar games* and ran away?
0:44 when he said “sheesh” I felt that
ufc fighter in a honda civic? they’re right about being underpaid. smh
Left his car running and unlocked...does he think he lives in rural Iowa? What a maroon.
that was illegal knee he was sitting!
he should of never let his car running and un locked in the first place. why would anyone even do that? smh
see whats stupid about that whole thing is, the fighter left his car running while he was inside, shows he is not really smart or takin too many hits to the head.
Severe Thunderstorm Warning
Wants people to learn to lock their cars….and not leave them running??? Lmao. I think i learned that in the second grade. Wth is wrong with these new generations? 😕😕😕
Imagine If it was Brock Lesnar's car , He surely would've sent the thief to suplex city.
This happened to me while I was 9 months pregnant with my second, while i was leaving a Wendy's drive thru still in my car, and there were two men n one had a box cutter. I have no idea how i didn't get cut, only thing they ended up getting was my phone and a debit card.
I’m sorry but how can anyone just leave their car unlocked and still running even if it’s for a while 😂
Only time I ever leave my "non" remote key in a vehicle and keep it running is when I have someone in it.
Why would people leave their car unlocked and running? Unless you want to do a sting.  Which is why I wouldn’t want to take a running car lol
The hit hurt him he ran hold his head
Dude was asking for his car to be taken. It's so stupid to leave ur car running. Ur giving the thief a head start. Lucky that guy saw him in time otherwise the car would be long gone.
If you tried stealing a car and got your face smashed in by a UFC Fighter.....Call the Law Offices of U SUCK LOSER now...
I live in a tiny mountain town and people leave front doors unlocked cars running and bikes unlocked all over the place.
He was just going to take it for an oil change and a fill up!
He should made the man put his teeth on the curb .
The last time that I was a victim of such a thing was 32 years at the age of 14. I have trained in fighting since ever since then and have been an educator rather than a victim. Learn to properly defend yourselves people because sometimes even the criminal has some skills.
A guy tried to steal my Jeep one time with me in it it didn't work out for him it was actually pretty funny. I said sure stepped out side off my Jeep and tossed the keys about 20 feet in the air he looked up and I punched him in the throat as hard as I could it almost killed him. Then put him on the ground and put his arms in a pretzel behind his back with his face on the hot asphalt down here in Florida till the cops showed up.
Instant karmer
Hilarious
is he a UFC fighter ? I never seen him B4
Regrets paying those gas prices
Y are people still leaving their keys in their car ….
Unlocked and running ....are you stupid ?
Um that should be common sense I always lock my car even when I'm pumping gas its a force of habit .
Most thieves are cowards, too.
Well good news for the car thief, he'll sue and he'll win. So he still gets the car. Who says crime doesnt pay.
News flash ppl - Colorado has a citizens arrest statute.  You can apprehend ppl you have WITNESSED or have very REASONABLE SUSPICION of committing a crime.  Know the law…I don’t recommend half-assing an arrest otherwise it’ll be you in jail.
What a dummy tho....unlocked car and its running and you're not in it? You was asking for it to be stolen lol 😆
This UFC fighter got hit to many times in the head leaving his keys in a car lol.
Disappointed the thief didn’t get a major beat down.
UFC would definitely be one of my favorite sports to join up with. But the Cauliflower Ears literally back me down from ever joining 😂😂🤣
#Buy Bitcoin
That dude got kneed so hard, HE thought he was getting carjacked 😆
I lived right next to that gas station 🤣 get em!
Sheesh
Didn't show much of a difference than a regular citizen pulling a thief out of his car. What did I miss here?
I seen some knees connecting but didn't see punches. Hey they tried to tell the truth.
Can you imagine the joy a fighter must have when he steps outside to see an opponent who forgot to wear a helmet and no referee in sight? I bet he had a big smirk on his face before running over there.
He didn’t throw a few punches… it was knee to the face a couple of times
Don't mess around with a UFC fighter unless you are one yourself.
meow meow meow meow
did the ufc fighter have the brain damage before he started professional fighting?
Another BLM activist doing his "thing". Democrap voter in action
Wow next to you wanna pull a GTA don't wait till after the fighter pays for his 8 hr energy to Pull off!
Knee! Knee!
He was suffering from memory loss and mistook someone else's car for his
Dang! $3.64/gal out there...it's $2.79 here in New Orleans...
This just warms my heart
Bad guy doesn’t lock door either.
Lol both are stupid
Careless situations like this are why car insurance premiums are so high. If his car gets stolen, you pay for it.
Thank God the dude didn't open fire on  him.
Dam I leave my car open and running all the time 🤦‍♂️
In a lot of cases IF the car, in those circumstances, was stolen your insurance does not pay.  Under the law the running car is classed as an attractive nuisance and the owner is faulted for not doing due diligence to prevent the theft.  Its the same category as an unprotected swimming pool in which a child drowns.  Narragansett Bay.
Is great but he could have gotten run over
Never heard of dude until today.  Who tha fook is this man?!
This brings as much joy to my heart as it brought pain to his body.
I can't believe he assaulted that proud black man. He should have just given up his car. He was just trying to feed his family.
Plot twist.. the man parked in the valet spot at the gas station
Who leaves their car running and the door unlocked?!!!
This was acted
"I don't normally steal cars, but when I do, I make sure it is a UFC fighter's car"
I love a happy ending!
Lol
Guy's in the UFC and he's driving a civic... Further proof Dana White's a POS.
I didn't think the thief was all that smart till I realized the keys were left in the car.
The thief should have used  gun then prolly he wud have gotten away with it
Great story! Now both have a life lesson to live by: victim, never take what’s not yours.  UFC fighter: stop setting traps for idiots! Just not worth your time! 🤣😂🤣
If i was there, i would beat the crap out of the owner, after he's done beating the thief, for stupidly leaving his car keys and most stupid of all, leaving the car running.
"Not to do more damage" yeah right
And the thief should lock the car.
I only regret one thing.  He let him go after a too light beating.
Never leave your keys in your car while it's running without your knee lock
You know there is somebody watching this right now saying. ....  "Dammit G .... That looks exactly like YOU!!  And Now you suddenly have this Big O' Black-eye?!?   Fell off ur bike ...My ASS!! " 😏
This is one way to get shot and killed. No UFC fighter can fight a bullet
If the thief had locked the doors he would have gotten away
People that leave their car unlocked are stupid. People that leave their car running are even more stupid. People that leave their valuables and expensive cars running are only  one step away from being as stupid as people that leave dogs and toddlers in cars.
“Sheesh”
One knee to the skull was rather painful 😂
Your first mistake was leaving the keys in the car.
*Dat gud boi juz needz da car fo school*
He won't be leaving his car unlocked again. Hang on hes UFC guy of course he will.
Just imagine you're in a low place in life where you have to commit Grand Theft Auto you see a nice car you then steal the car only to get you ass kick by an ufc fighter damn life just keeps fucking this guy 😂😂😂
And its being said...... BLM....Bull Sht...
At least he didn’t used submission…
Don't fuck with mma fighter 🤕💥🤛
i mean ,, yea the last part. the keys were inside and doors were unlocked.    the black man couldnt resists.
I WANT MY "MOMMY"🤭
Ok so lessons to know:  1). Don’t steal cars 2). Don’t leave keys in your car 3). If you steal someone’s car lock the doors
The thief got off lucky.  He could have been in the hospital with life altering injuries.
Experience is the best teacher!. Either way that's crazy! Glad he got his car in time!!. 🙏🙏
Years ago, a similar incident happened when a thief tried stealing a woman's car. She was only about 5 feet tall, maybe even shorter, so he thought it would be no problem. Turns out, she was a karate instructor with a black belt. Enough said.
But when an average citizen tries to defend his property he is thrown in hand cuffs and accused as a  assailant
Still dumb people out there!!! Turn off your ignition and lock your doors not that difficult!!!
professional ufc fighter drives a honda?  humble 👍
Lock your car dude
You can't punch bullets
Super Hero…
Haha. nice knee to the head. great recovery. What a jerkoff that thief was
Mommy, mommy, he mean...😪
Phanny Packtion Activate! Dude didn’t stand a chance😆
Rule number one…always lock the doors after you steal it lol
😆
Respect 👍
Dam. The UFC doesn't pay shit huh!  Hes driving a Hyundai
WAIT!....WHO THE FCK LEAVES THEIR  UNATENDED CAR RUNNING AND OPEN, OR THE KEYS IN THE SWITCH???? DAAAHAAAAH!! AS DUMB WAS THE THIEF AS THE VICTIM 👨‍⚖️ 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
LeBron says they’re hunting joggers though.
Repent israelits all praise to the most high YAHAWAH AND HIS SON YAHAWASHI🙏🏽🛸🛸🛸🛸🤴🏽🦁⌛️🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽
Its always funny to me when they say things like; The Victim wants US to learn... NO JORDAN  WILLIAMS we don't need to learn to turn our car off, take the keys and lock the car when we leave it; only the big and STUPID need to learn that and thats not MOST of us.
But when the police do it ???….
Jogger boy will go home crying to jis momma and they will ask leboner james to rant in twitter that his jogger boys are being hunted lol
Leboners jogger boys use their skill to run away lol
Democrats and BLM will pretend this stuff never exists and blame the Supremacists for the crime. The car owner was lucky because the chosen race did not die. 😆
Foolish to leave your car running and unlocked.
Yeah these people are getting way to courageous we all see that everyday if they could read the minds they would stop while their ahead but they are not capable you will have to do as this man did.
People now a days just don't have common sense.  They make everything easy to become a victim.  Why are cars easily highjacked while your at a stop sign or lights?  It's because  you don't lock your door.  That is what the locks are for.  For  your safety.  Honesty I don't feel sorry for stupid people.  If you are not proactive on your end than you ain't getting  my sympathy.  Keep your doors  locked at all times and especially when you are in it.
People never learn, 🤦‍♀️. Lock your damn car at all times, Dumbo
If you leave your keys in your car, you're begging to be robbed.
Look like knees to me👀🤣🤣
Where do you people live where you can leave your car running? What planet?
If you have a car that has a wireless key that you can lock it while it’s running so be it but if you have a car we’re gonna leave the key running unlock then don’t
That was nothing
Clickbait, he didn't pound him at all
Is it illegal to ground and pound the thief?
He actually kneed him in the forehead when he was still in car. Awesome
Man he's a UFC fighter and drives a shitty  civic 🤣
He 's lucky Jordan let him go....people are getting fed up...
I'll never understand people who leave their car unlocked or running while they enter a store.
Yeah he can fight but has no common sense.
I love living in a small town.  Leave your car running...not worried about  Biden supporters stealing ur shit!
I always leave my car with the ac running  but i can locked  you can't put it on drive without the key inside with you
I'm no thief but I would be afraid it was a bait car lol. Like who leaves their stuff unlocked and running in Denver 🧐🤨🤔
"He only regrets one thing" wearing a fanny pack
Give the UFC fighter a title shot for this.
In California that fighter would have lost everything and they would have given everything to the thief
Classic case of picking the wrong victim
He manages to throw a few punches.  “Guy knees him in the face”
Imagine if the thief locked the door lol
Where’s the 3rd grade photo of the car thief?
Act like he's was in a ring 🤣🤣🤣
Naw he wishes he could beat his as some more 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's funny to see but he left his car UNLOCKED and RUNNING?   Okay, maybe UFC causes brain injuries.
I don't know which is worse, the driver leaving his door unlocked, or the thief not locking it after getting in
Done split his dome lol
Dangerous move with car in motion.  Another one of Lebronda's hunted every day boys doing what they do everyday
Should of put him to sleep on the ground so some one else could make him tap out.
His one regret was to control the scene?  Um, how about lock your car???
Still alive to go do it again? Boot stomp there head to a curb!
The reporter is a lame for sayi g "sheesh"
That is rule number one if you have a car anywhere in the city, when you get out you turn the car off you make sure all the windows are up you get out you lock the door you walk away with the keys firmly in your hand
I don't care who you are! Don't leave your car unlocked and running in front of a convenient store!
Fanny pack!👈🏼🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thieves should lock doors upon entering.
Obviously the person filming knew it was being stolen, fake!!
Oh 💩😂🤣😂 🤣🤣🤣
UFC fighter or not, I’m sure that’s the last time he leaves his engine running. Both men learned their lessons. One a little painfully embarrassing than the other. 😂🤣😂
Hey car thief's....if ur gonna steal a car....lock ur door and wear a seat belt...so u don't get the shit beat out of u
Nice job friend!
“Sheesh” 🤣
$3.64 FOR FUEL
Should have knock his lights out..go get your own shi__.
I learned never to leave my car running after a good friend of mine went to jail for stealing cars that way 🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
Stop leaving your car door unlocked
Who's the dummy that left his keys in his car for a thief to just jump in and steal? How many times does somebody have to explain that people need to turn their car OFF and take the keys WITH THEM? I wonder how many times he needed to be told to lift the toilet seat to keep from turning his shoes yellow?
It looks funny when the wanna be thief hold his head !! 🤕😂
Didn't do any pounding but ok
This is what its coming down to folks , you are going to have to fight to protect whats yours from being taken away , if you cant fight you will will have no choice but to loose everything youve worked hard to get or pay someone to protect you  , the cops are stretched too thin and are being defunded making it worse.Judges let re-peat offenders back out on the street all the time.
Thief's moms going to call news and say that guy should. Of never hit my baby boy he was doing no harm . That man has white privilege
he said sheesh.
He had every right to body slam him .....
He’s lucky that guy didn’t hit the gas when he was reversing he would have went under that door and probably be killed
Bruh people who leave their cars running are weird lol
Don't leave your keys in your car!!!!!   That's the real lesson learned here!!!!  And let's point out the fact that if your going to steal a car,  hurry and get the F outta here,, not just take your time like grandma backing up looking both ways,,,  damm,  drive like you stole it!!!!
Idiot left his car on amd unlocked... you deserve to get it stolen
Why would he left the car unlock in the first place😂😂😂
not all tough guys are smart
This the shit that could only happen to me with my luck
Who cares?
Doesn't matter, they'll let him out of jail the next day.
I was thinking his only regret was leaving the keys in his car
Seeing the suspect hold the right side of his head as he runs away is so satisfying. The justice system needs to implement this kind of punishment lol
Bro look like Khris Middleton
Damn I wished they had this ass whuppin' lesson in slow mo.
Will never understand these ppl who leave their doors unlocked- never.
No no do more damage .
0:45 this should be common sense but wait I forgot that doesn't exist anymore
Too bad, so sad. But not sad enough. 🤨
He's a good boy, a very good boy
Yaaaaa good job he'll give all pain to a thief .. nobody likes a thief good job🙏
Mommy mommy he kneed me in my head... Mommy what did you do?  I tried to steal the car but I failed.. Good  I'm very proud of you.....
Did this dude say sheesh??
He definitely went away rubbing he's head. ✌️🖤
Its like hitting the Lottery
Riged
Who leaves their keys in the ignition or running while in the store? Just asking for trouble.
He didn't regret leaving his car running and unlocked?  Instead, he regretted not apprehending the guy. He must have been punched in the head one too many times.
He must have hit him real hard because the thief ran holding  his face I’m laughing while I’m trying to type this It’s just so funny
He didn't lock the car and left it running? Maybe he should have had his car stollen 😑
That's me in my mind.. lol I can do this
Ehh, I'm still gonna leave my car running, it's a shitbox 3.9L v8 with a vacuum leak rn (they don't make the part for my car anymore) so I don't like to turn it off for 1 min and turn it back on
And he did it all with a fannypack on, you gotta respect it.
I'm happy he socked the guy a couple times, but isn't it illegal for him to do so?
Nice old fashioned hit upset the head probably made him think about doing it again 😂.. this was best case scenario
I don’t understand people leaving their cars unlocked. I grew up in suburban Iowa and even I would NEVER leave my car unlocked.
*Who's surprised that a BLM terrorist tried to STEAL something that DIDN'T belong to them? NOT ME! I WISH the UFC fighter had knock the BLM terrorist's teeth down it's throat! We all know that BLM terrorist has ALREADY stolen another HARD WORKING TAXPAYER'S car!* 🤬🤬🤬
He pulled him out the car like it was gta
Yellow fanny pack and all.
Took bruh 30 days to pull off
stupid for leaving keys, luck no gun on him,glad your ok but be care full......
I saw this a little differently, the owner showed little interest in pursuing the criminal.
MMA fighters are sooo under paid!
Never pick a fight with a guy that has cauliflower ears…
Good!
Funny ,an aspen dental ad preceded this vid 😂😂😂😂😂😂
More endings like this!👍💪
You never stop throwing punches until the refs says it’s over.  I didn’t see no ref!
He probably left the car running on purpose, praying for a moment like that 🤣
Now this, ladies and gentleman is what we call a GTA reversal.
Shouldn't the thing he regrets doing is leaving the keys in the car?
That was a joke.  He should have pummeled the dude into absolute submission.  Then just drove away.  Defund the police right.
Instant Karma😅
He’s lying he wanted to beat the shit out of him
He ran away holding his head crying
And don’t forget to lock your doors while getting gas so nobody gets inside on passenger side and takes a purse or whatever
Guess you should lock your damn car.
who leaves an unattended car running? I am glad he was able to get his car back
we need more citizens like him, give these thugs a beat down
The way he ran away holding his face was hilarious
I have a bad feeling that the only thing the third learned was to target people smaller than him.
If you gonna steal the car at least lock the d*mn door as soon as you get in and then drive off....lol
There really needs to be a poc database.
Who trys to rob anyone with no gun guy was asking to get his ass whooped
You'll never regrets... one thing...  Paying $3.64 gallon for gas .  LMAO
😂🤣 guy is a fool left the car runing and open hahaha u asking for them to take it
are u blind? a few knees u mean
How unlucky are you?  -"I was stealing a car & 20 sec later realized it belongs to a UFC fighter"
I wish he put the guy out his misery.
Hilarious.
Probably shouldn't have left the car running , but it was good to see the bad guys running away holding this head
The firefighter was more stupid leaving his car open
I was here before it went viral
Who leaves their car running???
take the keys out
Plot twist: He parked in a handicap, he was just moving it. Lol
Good for him!!
Should have really let him feel it
UFC Fighter: Oh No! I left my car running and door unlocked, I really hope nobody tries to steal it...
Jesus love you all and he's coming back Soon, repent turn away from sin before it's too late.
is it just me or do no one lock the door when they get inside any vehicle?
The guy was just checking his glove compartment to see if his car warranty expired and the car rolled back, it's not his fault
open car engine on. catch and release? STUPID! 3 THINGS TO REGRET
never live it running...some people learn  the hard way
He was a lucky guy
Here comes the BOOM!
That was a ‘dumb move’ because usually these thieves have guns on them, or another accomplice with them who has a gun on them !!! Ready to shoot your ass, so you can get another car but you can’t get another ‘LIFE!’
That was a ‘dumb move’ because usually most of these thieves have guns on them, or another accomplice with them who has a gun on them ready to shot your ass !!! You can get another car but you can’t get another ‘LIFE!’
Ok but can we talk about how their gas is $3.64.....here in my hometown its 2.89 and I thought that was high
🤣
Staged asf
He let him go easy.
While he was at the store his house was robbed
Dude got his ass beat by a guy wearing a fanny pack. That's rock bottom.
People that leave their car running and go into a store are really stupid and deserve what ever happens.
That's what he gets *for wearing a fanny pack!* 😩🤣
A fighter & also a idiot
What dumbass doesn't lock their car and turn it off before going inside lol
A nobody from ufc🤣🙈
brain damage made him not lock his car and keep his keys in there
Professional fighter or not, he's lucky that thief wasn't carrying a weapon, or dragged him with the car.
0:44 SHEEEEEEESH
Bro who cares !!! Media  on repeat with all this fear factor bullshit
That man had cauliflower ears you big dummy! He should of floored the gas if he was going to be that stupid!😆
What a dick, nearly drove off. Good thing the guy took care of him!
He let the guy go because it was staged. He is trying to jump start his ufc career.
NOW you think about keeping him there,  he's had way too many punches to the head I'd say
Moron isn't a hero.
Why did he leave his car unlocked though? Let alone running too. The heck.....who does that.....shit, might as well have kept the door open too
Why do you leave your car running and unlocked????  I've seen someone do that in front of my work just to pay a bill and a homeless person drove off with the car.
Dang i was hoping to see the thief catch a violent beating.  I wonder if america started beating thieves almost to death if the stealing would stop.  I remember when i was in middle school i did a book report on how Singapore beat thieves with a cane of bamboo by a professional.  Everyone over there was terrified of stealing.  The thieves in america are not scared enough.
Amazing...... He may be the only thief in town, without a gun.
If your car ever breaks down and you need to get to work, just go to the nearest gas station, someone has left their car running for you so you won't be late for work.
A guy like him doesn't worry about his car getting stolen if he leaves it running with the keys in it while he runs into the gas station
Man really left his car running.......
sheeesh
Lol
0:44
That was underwhelming.
Lmfao.... good for his ass
Damn look at those gas prices
Awesome news, we'll not that I want anybody carjacking, but that bastard didn't go nowhere but icing his forehead.
Only a moron would leave his car running and unlocked  while in the store.
Should of apprehended him. He needs to be off the street.
0:44 sheeeesh
"Ha ha SHEEESH!"
A person defends his property from being stolen,  but the dislikes are high. Must be police defunders.
Did anyone else notice he’s wearing a fanny pack
0:44 sheeeeesh
Damn naighbors strike again...
This is exactly why I’ll never leave my car running at a gas station.
Funny seeing a huge guy wearing a fanny pack
But where is BLM ?
I didn't see punches
Only good thing about collapse of civilization, Human genome gets a cleansing. Because there will only be death for worthless DNA. "Climate change! Too many people!" < Keep your mask on and stay locked down so you drop immunity to the plagues that are why its illegal to contact uncontacted tribes. So when we unlock they all hit the masses like a SEASONAL illness that rot your eyes while you're standing on your feet. < We can OPENLY TELL YOU PEOPLE WE ARE ENDING THE MASSES, and you people don't want to get violent against your establishment govt. HAHAHA. DOCILE = PREY.. - Atheist eugenicist communist
U aint frm da hood if u leave ur own car on outside da store 😂😭😅
SHEESHHH
Dummy should have regretted leaving his keys in the car🙄
So he left the car open and kept the engine running
Thank god the car jacker ain’t have a gun😭
Imagine ( not johnny Lennon’s bs song ) but a world where EVERY good man could pound the snot out of nasty thugs ?  ☺️.  Think about it , then get to a Judo school
Good job buddy
….and he even has a Fanny pack!!
They said he threw punches?  Looked like one punch and a few knees to the head to me.
Should have pinned him to the ground and called the cops though.
He was jogging
I wouldn't mess with the kind of idiot psychopath that is too lazy to turn off their car for a 45 second stop at a gas station.
The mind fuk. "Ooo, free car, wait a min-, pow pow! im outta here!"
I am not impressed. Not only that , but what if the guy shot him ? Lol
The UFC fighter acted on pure instinct,he protected his personal vehicle,the thief ran off after a couple of knee shots to the face, and head, 😭 mommy.Good job bro there are low lives everywhere,always lock your car,and be vigilant of your surroundings..
Only idiots leave their car unlocked
If you’re going to steal a car dude, how about hitting the lock button as soon as you set down. Intro to Stealing 101.
"a few good punches"? All I see is him landing knees to the face, Mr reporter.
Let me ask, who leaves their car open & then who leaves it running?   I’m a delivery driver, I lock my car giving stuff to people on their door step 10 feet away
Fair play he didn’t hospitalise him
I didn't know UFC fighters drove the same car as mines 😐
He's not going anywhere. If he couldn't maintain control of some rando, he's got no future in pro fighting.
In grandpa’s voice, “Now what did we learn?”
part they didn't show you... UFC fighter learns thief has pistol, comes back  and UFC made a big mistake.
He gave him the beating his dad should of gave him growing up
I was expecting a beat down 😫
Why would you leave it unlocked with the key inside anyway?😅
Bl..I mean thief..was prolly screaming imma sue you!
ufc fighter and driving a cheap ass car?
He ran away holding his head looking stupid AF.. lol 😆🤣😂
Why would you leave the keys in the car you UFC IDIOT  Un Focus Child 👶🏿 😂
The thief is to slow, stupid.
Haha
My brother in law stopped at a gas station, and went with the car running.  It was stolen. We got it back, but the thief damaged the transmission, and on the way to the repair shop, it caught fire. Nothing left, but an awesome video of it.
I didn't know people still left their vehicles running and unattended while they're inside a store or gas station. Just seems silly, especially these days.
Fighter: I wish I would've apprehended him, so I could talk to him a little more with my knuckles and knees.👊🏽
Oh Not hurt him With your power you could easily break his hands and prevent futher theft till the police apprehend him
The thief didn't lock the car neither 😄
✊🏿
I dont get why people leave there car running when they go into a store. This isnt Canada you know.
Wow, these thieves will just sit there all day and wait for someone to leave the car running. Would be easier to spend that time working i think.. Cars can easily be purchased..and I think that's a felony, more time in jail that could be spent working. Come on people!
Plot twist: Lean times with Covid so UFC fighter turned bounty hunter. He now uses his (running) car to as bait to attract would-be thieves and BONUS —> free ‘sparring partners’.
REPERATIONS fail!
Im Sure is how his mama didn't teach him any manners however that man sure did. 😆
Never leave your car unlocked
Cant help that headline though "UFC fighter cought on camera pounding car thief"🤣
Stupid for leaving his car running and so lucky he didn't get his butt ran over !!!
Why ppl living there cars turn on  unlocked the keys inside?
Why would someone leave keys and car running????
Never mess with a man wearing a bright yellow fanny-pack
Looks like a Tesla thought the security was better?
shouldve locked the door
I just love karma.
Got away to easy!
Thugs always learn the hard way.
I wish he would of did a better job than that? The guy was able to run away with no problem. He must be a shitty UFC fighter.
Oh shocker guess the race
This is not CBS? This is fox trying to make it look like cbs. A black man reporting on a black man stealing a car? You know this is fox race baiting. Fox yes our national disgrace.
Meanwhile, on today's episode of 'f*** around and find out'...
This same thing happened to my bf recently, and little did the would-be thief know he would get choked out and pinned down and then get arrested.....lol! It didn’t go so well for these crooks.
"And the winner by 1st round submission...."
Only in america that dumb numb nuts leave car running and unlock
The most shocking thing to me is who the hell leaves their car unlocked and on. I can't comprehend that.
Oh he wants people to learn common sense?  I mean come on you're just asking for a car go be stolen if you leave it running and unlocked!  DUHHHH!!!!!!
"Not to do more damage" he says, preparing to do even more damage to apprehend the theif. 😂😂
😂 don’t take 💩 that’s not yours fool!
He left his keys in the car and left it running?? Come on guy to many hits to the head
https://youtu.be/Q9TZBv65gdY
This is the most anticlimactic video I've seen in years. Hey Channel 17...do you need a special storage facility to house your giant piles of over exaggeration, sensationalism and hyperbole?
I think I'm more shocked that the thief didn't lock the door than the owner.
My manz said “sheesh” 🤣
You can tell this the first time that guy ever felt a knee to the face lol
DAM!!!!!Thats Crazy......... $3.60 for a gallon of gas!!!!!!!
Lucky he didn't get shot.
Props to the UFC fighter but I think he was a little too kind
really williams you left your keys in the car running ahole opps i coughed
Good for him
The weird thing is the car door was open 🥴, I thought all new cars close doors when are moving. Strange video.
Let’s hope he doesn’t get charged by the thief!  Unnecessary force?  What a world.
What a shock look what color he was.
??? I didn't see any pounding. Am I watching the wrong video??? 🤔🤔
Why does a big UFC fighter drive a small Civic like at least drive an accord or an Avalon or something a bit roomier for yourself.
Running like a bitch Just like the rest of them XD
Guy caught a knee
Sheesh , ima buy a gun soon
Yeah learn that lesson around I was about 19 years old but good job on beating the guy up
They were both taught a lesson.
Make Ted gunderson trend
If the guy stealing the car was armed it wouldn't matter how tuff you think you are. Bullets kill who ever is on the receiving end.
Dumb dude leaving his car unlocked beats the s#it out of another dumb dude.
He did the right thing letting the dude run off, from a defenders standpoint. You never know if he has buddies waiting around the corner with any kind of weapons who knows.
That’s that mister fab shit!! Lol 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why did he let him get away?
How many times do you have to be hit in the head before you start leaving your car unlocked and running at a Circle K?
Got beaten by a man with a fanny pack…
Oops up side the head Oops up side the head Hey hey hey Oops up side the head Oops up side the head
Why is your car unlocked in the first place with the keys in the ignition?
What a naïve person.  My mama taught me to lock the car.  Sheez.
He assaulted that poor man who was just trying to make a living
Lovely!
Glad u weren't hurt, but never leave ur car on & doors unlocked.  You're asking for trouble b/c vultures are always on the hunt
Wheres the pounding
Who's dumber: a car thief that doesn't know how to lock the door to keep from being pummeled, or someone who leaves their car unlocked and running while shopping at 7-Eleven?
Those punches were so fast I didn't see them.
This is beautiful.
The dinosaur saw it all
My Tesla locks itself as soon as I walk away. Is UFC pay really that bad that he can't afford a Tesla?
Shame the video was so choppy that we didn't get a good view of the beating, lol
man I was hoping to see a few holds and a ground and pound
Well don't leave your car running while your in the store, and lock the doors. Then you wouldn't have to beat someone ass for taking your car.
You know it's also illegal in Most states to leave your car running while it's unattended
Looked staged to me...what took the criminal so long to pull away and why did he stop when Williams opened the car door? I also don't see much punching...maybe I am wrong,😕
FAKE AF
Not what i expected. Thought i was going to watch some actual UFC action.
Every one seems to be UFC fighter
My boy said sheeesh 💀😂😂
Wasn't that excessive force? If it was a Cop instead of a UFC guy...would that be excessive force?
"Inept installed sociopath pedo racketeer does not give a sh@/t"" Is accurate. How's it feel to be serfs? How much poorer are you know? Feel good about your children's prospects?
Lock ya Cars Dude Better Be happy that's all he Got Leave people an people's Car's Alone
This made my morning.
Is that a Fanny pack? So cute
HAHAHAHAHA !!!!!! 👻
Good
Hahaha 😄
The gta reverse uno card
That’s one tough bum bag operator.
Um,  don’t leave keys in the car or the car running.
CNN, man beaten mercifully for accidentally , mistakenly getting in wrong car
Fake news! Why would someone just randomly be videoing that car?
And he did it ALL with a fanny pack!
Never try and steal anything from a man with cauliflower ears
Hahaha love these stories!!!
He gonna cry in the car… oh wait
He left his car running?  What an idiot - thin the herd
Another common denominator
If you're stealing a car children then make sure you "Lock The Doors"! LOL!
*FAKE BULLSHYTE*
J aime
Joggers gonna jog
Knee to the face .ouch
No one else: Me: Damn gas there is $3.64? Geez 😬
Why are you leaving your car running with the doors unlocked? 😐
Good job 👏
I like those knees to the head my man
Yup…. Turn your car off. So many people leave it running while picking up a blunt
Hahaha...🥊💥🥴
Who the F**k leaves their car running and unlocked while going into a store?..... What an idiot!..... 🙄
Staged. The bad guy puts the car in park, really, come on. Any real bad guy would have gassed it.
Thief: ah, ah , ah, I sees me and easy target Car owner: I’ve trained my whole life for this! Thief: owie, me brain shell !!!
2 things: I find it interesting a UFC fighter drives a civic and also, how did the car not lock the doors automatically when shifted out of park...
He wanted to nap him
Thief was too stupid/lazy to even lock the doors. Hopefully they're all this dumb.
How about some knee shots 😂
Wow your gas in Colorado is exPENSIVE!
🤣🤣😂🤣
If either one of them would of locked the door this video would of been alot different!!!
So..... am I the only person here who payed attention to how that Honda Civic stopped going in reverse when the doors were left open?
What an idiot. Leave car key in the car and engine running….Geez I wonder why some dude tried to steal my car. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Instead of doing the"Okey Dope !" He got "Roped a Doped!"🥊🥊
🤣👍
Sometimes you have to be a lesson for others to learn from...because all of us aren't ufc fighters.
good thing he stopped the thief but always lock your car. second, they should find the thief and offer him a deal to fight Jordan Williams in the octagon on PPV and if he wins he gets a car, money to get clean, and freedom but if he loses he gets nothing and gets sent right to jail and of course a Jordan Williams beatdown
Get eye exam before going to rob.
Homeless please donate to my PayPal
fighters can fight but that's about it... dumb as rocks.
Of course two knees to the head would give you a head ach.
A 3 piece and a biscuit, gottem💪💪
Wasn't near enough! Thief should've been laid out in his own pool of blood
The other guy is going to try and take him to court and say he assaulted him.😉
Now that's real news.
I would never leave my baby with the keys inside  running  ,tf!
turn the dam car off people that's  way this happens to people to much trash in this world this day ,turn  your dam car off .
Don't be a victim  Lock your vehicle  ETC. ETC.
The only bigger crime here is how has is $3.64 a gallon. Fuck the car, you’re getting robbed at the pump.
Who is the dumb guy?
Forget the car thief the real theft is ongoing. $3.64 a gallon.
So he went in the store and left his car running? He deserved to get the car stolen. The dumb-ass! No common sense. Cause shit with your own stupid actions! How about stop do stupid shit?
$3.64 for a gallon of gas!!? I hope that’s not for regular 87. By the time I’m old enough to drive, gas will be $5.00 plus. 🤦‍♀️
Damn couldn't even knock out a civilian wow 🤦‍♂️ yea his UFC career won't be long or should I say long🤔 well either or is fine 🤷‍♂️same shit smh
He said sheeeesh
How about not leaving your car running with the keys in every time you go to a damn store.
Fear the cauliflower ear.
“We literally be out here stealing cars erry day” - Lequanda Jaymes
0:45 no shit....
Forget the fight, y’all see the gas price’s????
Just like he forgot to lock his car so did the thief haha.
Why does it always turn into the trusting nice guys fault 🙏✌️
UFC career and all u got is a honda civic😂
Call da amber lamps!
Them knees to the head hahaha best part you know hes watched this or someone who knows him is clowning him while watching this.
That was really dangerous for the UFC guy bc he could have gotten run over
#1 lesson people stop riding around with your car doors unlocked  #2 Stop leaving your car running while you go into a store ( for just a minute).  #3 And most of all parents don’t leave your kids in the car, with car running and the keys are in it too  You’re just asking for trouble.
Title should read - Dipshit UFC fighter leaves keys in car and running while going in convenience store.
Get it now? Know already how to defend and think for yourself anywhere
Yea he messed up big time! Dumb car thief
Idiot left the car running
Can I get a hell yeah
What lazy moron leaves his car running and unlocked in today’s world ? Dude took too many punches himself it seems.
back in 2005 I use to be a professional MMA fighter (1-1-0) with Fokai out in Undisputed in North Park, Ca. My career ended abruptly after a bar fight. Even though I didnt start the fight, I knocked out a guy and he had to go to the hospital. I was locked up for my actions and the judge told me, "because of your extensive training and not to mention that your hands are registered weapons in the city, you cannot fight outside the ring", therefore I got fucked over and the other guy got away with hospital bills..  How is it that? The world is now cherishing this moment but when I and a few others are out there, we get screwed over? Fuck the system!
I love happy endings
The news reporter said sheesh the world is definitely ending soon
CNN: Racist UFC fighter attacks black male.
That's what needs to be the fate of all these parasites who try to steal. Feel good story :))
Shit was staged
The law says it's joy riding if the keys are left in there
That’s nice but maybe don’t leave your car keys in the car and lock it 🤷🏻‍♂️
The news presenter is just reading from a script but he could see he was using knee strikes but still read what it said on the screen proof the news is full of shit. 🇬🇧👍
Hahaha 😂😂😂
your car is running unlocked? lmao
play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Idiots leaving their cars running allows for this to continue.
Nice job young man! Adult spankings are sometimes required and far more effective than the law at times.
377 thieves disliked this vid.
Fannypack 😂😂😂
Shocking this happened... You leave your car running in front of a brother. Dude, know your surroundings, no wonder you have 5 losses.
UFC. We have a new star
UFC paychecks are brutal. He's driving a Honda Civic. Dana White? Pay these fighters some real money.
Lol I love when Karma introduces herself to stupid people
I wish he caused more damage on that thief
Dude must have some UFC brain damage for leaving his car running. Wtf??
Cool guy!
That car must be proud of its owner
He lucky it wasn't Ferguson
Usual suspect
Punches??
Yup never leave it running unless someone is in the car and if your family is in the car waiting for you lock them in. Lock your car while pumping gas too.
Had this been a cop, you guys would have cried RACISM.
This is sad, he didn’t need to hit that black man like that , just call the police . Racists piece is shit loved hitting that man because of his skin color.
UFC fighter or not that's why you never leave your keys in your car even for a quick run. I bet he also left the engine running as well.
I guess they both learned something from this.
"williams wants people to learn.." yeah, I won't be taking life advice from "williams" I had parents but thanks anyway "newspeople" for your deep concern
Plot twist he left the car on and unlock so he can beat up the thief who ever trying to steal his car 👿 🤛
Who the hell leaves the car unlocked and running.....
Ha ha ya he really fucked the guy up the guy had time to put the car in park an run away he really beat the guys ass an showed him a lesson lmao wearing a fanny pack
But why would you leave the car running while you go inside?
STAGGGGGGGGGGGGGED,,,,,,,NOBODY LEAVES THEIR KEYS IN THEIR CAR
“Sheesh” that’s the new word they have chosen for everyone to say.
What a stud he put all his weight into those front knees cuz you see the thief wallowing in pain after getting out the car
Hopefully the guy learned after having his face smashed in.
Let the perp off too easy, he should've been unconscious.
Where’s Bruce buffer I wanted to here the walk in intro dammit
Far more satisfying then just seeing the jerk cuffed by the cops 👍
What punches all knees yeeeeeeeeeeeee
I couldn't even think of a worse person to rob. A ufc fight. Yeah you're a very very veryyyyy smart person.
Gas is $ 3.64, WOW!
Sheeesh
I think he wanted that guy to take his car just so he can beat his @$$. That's why he left his keys in his car.
Liberals taking what isn't theirs.
I came for more.
Never seen the guy throw one punch.
Oh I wish he could of done more damage and really teach him a lesson.
Never mess with a wrestler's car LOL
you never know who you are dealing with
Why did you keep your car unlocked in the first place though 🤨
He really showed him. 2 knee strikes and news interview. Highlight of his career.
What are the actual chances of someone robbing a UFC fighter? 😂
Karma is a B#$*T The next time maybe a Bullet.
How about you run his ass over after you get your car back so this won't happen again?
Who's fault was it for leaving the keys in the car
Wow, what if the thief had a gun??!!!! Come on now!!! Your life is worth more than a car!!!! The car was probably insured anyway!!!
staged baiting it looks to me
If you don't know enough nowadays to not leave your keys in the ignition, let alone leave your car running when you get out of it,  then you almost deserve to have your car stolen.
Too bad he got away but he'll think twice before jacking a car again.
“Can throw hands” damn ok
plot twist....thief was dc cormier looking for a come-back fight.
That would be car thief got so lucky that he didn't get his a@# handed to him.
"More damage"  would have been just fine sir.  Thieves are garbage.
Lol that man has a bad case of instant carma. He should probably try a new profession
This shit fake the car doors lock when in reverse
The balls on these people just to walk up and jump into a car and take it. What is this world coming to
I guarantee you this guy is a repeat offender and the police are already very familiar with him.
The only regret you should have is not knocking him out. I wouldn’t where there’s surveillance. For obvious reasons
Good
Brilliant thief, steals car, doesn’t lock door lol
I think all theives should  get an Ass kicking, and And a few Knees, and a head butt... Then a curb stomp.....
Fights just like he does inside the ring.....hits the guy a few times with minimal damage and the guy gets away 😄
How did the thief get in your car? You left it unlocked. How did the thief start your car? The keys are in the ignition. If you take the keys out of the ignition and lock your doors, this won't happen to you.
All I know is his head was hurting
He flexed on him as he ran away🤣
How many people are gonna try to steel UFC fighters cars?
Who would downvote this? This is Amazing!
If you were smart he would have locked the doors on his dumbass
Left his car running and un locked.  Duh!
Whata loser🤣
How come the UFC fighter left his car unlocked when he went into the store? Not to smart.
should have made him tap out
HOMIE IS AN ALPHA KEEP THAT CAR RUNNING.. for the rest of us we lock the car car.
Should have put the no good bottom feeder in the hospital lol... good job
I wish he was around to help my disabled sister who was carjacked by gun point. The police won't do anything. It's been a nightmare.
Why do people leave keys in the car or unlocked when you know gas station is a place people steal anything.
Why do you leave your keys or key fob in your car unless you want someone to steel it...? looks like a set up to get some clicks...
That knee to the face tho..sheeesh💨💨💨
Why isn’t anyone talking about the yellow Fannypack 😂😂😂
0.32 Don't know what's worse getting punched by the UFC fighter, or getting punched in my wallet from the price of gas! Ouch 🤕
NY Mayor bill diblasio would encourage the car thief to file suit for assault against the car owner
Dhar mann “lives to instantly regret it”
do criminals not realize this is a ufc fighters dream? they be waiting to pummel on an average person while committing a crime lol
That was a pretty weak UFC fighter! Dude should have been laying there leaking all over the place till the police showed up.
He probably won't do it again...
“Lock your car and never leave it running “. Duh!!
Years ago I saw a news feed on TV about a genius that unknowingly tried to hijack a minivan that was filled with a judo team.  The footage only showed the police leading him away with a grimmace of pain on his face and holding his arm.
Good thing it wasn't like my car that auto-locks the doors once you put it in D. Just swings the door open and pulls his arse out lol
the larpin lefty dynnn.    doooooo got some accountability and responsibility passed on to him
Hell yeah.  Hell in a cell (car).
Too bad he was not able to teach him a proper lesson that he will remember forever. Come on!! You have pips like this that tries to steal other people honest bread. I should have been there......
If a man tries to steal your 2002 Honda, he’s doing you a favor.
I thought he would say I wish I kicked him in his head more lol .. but nevermind lol
There's a dinosaur on that gas station
Doors unlocked engine running, f#ck it I’ll take it
He left his car unlocked and running?!  Good thing he has brawn because he has no brains!
Never leave your keys in the car.
Glad he didn't get hurt, very entertaining 😀
Lol ! Dude ran away holding his head 😂
He should have checked his ass out  to be fair he just wanted to test drive  that Honda  Civic .😂💀
Talk about Clickbait, he didn’t pound anyone! He pulled him out of his car and literally watched him get away! Lol the media sucks
It is moronic to leave your car unlocked and running at a place like this.
Not as if he didn't deserve this suckered punch, the guy was lucky it wasn't from a billy club or from a cell block! That's coming, just another day!
Dude ran away, holding his head.....lol
he lucky he didnt have gun on him..but straight g thing..salute
Did he get punched in the eye?..he ran away holding it.
Only the brainless leave their cars running and unlocked...
Wait a minute. You’re telling me if I take my keys with me, my car is harder to steal?
UFC fighters are so DUMB. Who leaves a car running ????
Yeah but these car jackers have pistols tbh don’t risk it. Unless you packing too.
Not on dinostation either lol
Dang, Jordan is big when he's not in camp.
Really 🤨………as an adult he doesn’t know that you shouldn’t leave your car running and unlocked? 🙄……what a lack of judgement on his part and being overly trusting of his surroundings and of people. Yes, good thing he is safe and knows how to defend himself, however what if the person had a weapon. 🤔😳😬
Hahaha that fighter is wearing the joe rogan Fanny pack
Stupid News reporter ... It was a couple of knees not punches.
plot twist:  he left the car running, so he could look for some butt to kick.
I'm glad he kicked the thief ass but for the life of me I don't understand WHO THE HELL LEAVES THERE KEYS IN THE CAR AND THE CAR IS UNLOCKED that has to be the dumbest sh#t ever 🤔🤔
Hmm - do surveillance cameras usually jerk and bounce around like that…?  Not that an MMA fighter would want some publicity…
You gonna learn today!
Who’s that comfortable or in such a hurry that you needa leave your car running ??? You almost deserve getting chosen
How good does his UFC pay? This is no Lambo to fight for.
Leaving ur car running is asking for it to get stolen also he’s lucky the door was unlocked a lot of cars auto lock the doors when u get in gear
nah bruh he shouldve beat the shit outta him
I wish that the thief was also an MMA fighter. That fight would take over YouTube.
I love how we always joke about this and now it actually happened lmao manifested😂
Dude, lock the car 🤷
Cowards...people will do anything these days to brag on some shit. Put your hands on them and you will see their true colors. Now let me see him brag on that ass whooping he just took.
News reporter : sheesh
I drive a stick and we know they can't drive that. Lol
No one steals my car's  because I don't allow them  too..JKD
Sheesh
I was hoping to see my cousin Justine Smitely beating the hell out of another criminal. Last time he was stabbed and beat the hell out of the dude and his accomplices before realizing he was stabbed.
What got me did you see the price of gas. Everything the democrats have brought is bad.
It ain't the 50's, lock yo damn shit up, derp
Guy'll probably be shoplifting at the same place a couple hours later.
I just don't understand... It's 2021...okay... and people still be leaving cars unlocked with the key in.....AND TURNED? 🤔🤯
If you leave your car running, you deserve to get carjacked. Sorry, not sorry.
Tell the truth. You wanted to put him in the ring for a round.
Mama
$3.64 for gas…sheesh
It finally happened
Good lesson learned there. It was an open invitation to steal the car and an environmental felony leaving a car running. Lucky day
Guess too many hits to the head to forget to lock the car
With a fanny pack...fucking Legend
Lock the car dummy, and to make it better with the car on... keys and everything that an invitations to any robber.
Don't let your car run, always lock your car, AND don't park in the handicap parking lot where you think your entitled and say your going to be 'in and out'.... All because you drive an over priced luxury vehicle, doesn't mean you own the road.
HAHAHAHA boy picked the wrong person to f with 😂
The dumb UFC fighter who left his car RUNNING (!!!?) should PAY that thief for teaching him a lesson.
Makes sense that some dude that makes a living getting punched in the face, leaves his car running when he goes to the store. 🤭
I saw a ufc fighter at the bar whoop 5 dudes by himself. Including 2 security guards. The guy was average build body wise. By the look of it you would think you could take him.😂
it is wrong to steal
He hit him with a knee on the way out the door. He might have gotten away but I’ll bet he was hurtin.
YAAASSS!
And for the bad guy “always lock your doors”. 😁
Black Speech
All muscle and no brain. Typical.
Those weren't punches, they were knees... Geez get it right!
Geee! You know how the other news will say you can't do that just let him steal your car...smh!
Someone should slap him for leaving his car started. Come on bud
Not bad
My dude running and crying for his mom.
Don't leave your car running.
I won’t be stealin HIS pic-a-nic basket 🧺
the media needs to make these stories the new normal. then crime will go down.
brother is lucky he didn't open his fanny pack
If he would have locked that door
Have that same exact gas station out here
My only question, how was the car outside running with the owner on the inside? Well, maybe two questions; where were the keys?
3.64 a gallon.....wow look at those Joe Biden gas prices
😆😆😆😂😅🤣🥲🥲🥲 look how he’s running. Omg 😆
Knees not punches
Anyone know where in Denver this was?
I know those knees to the head did some damage, lol.
If you leave your car unlocked and running and it gets stolen, you're an idiot. If you steal a car that someone left running, and you don't lock the doors, you're a bigger idiot!
An equal opportunity beating.  Don’t steal stuff from others.
He should have made it official and eye poked hm.
My father stole Mobb Deep’s car stereo back in the early nineties to resell, he’s doing fine never got caught. Also did it to a few other cars, though those were to nobodies. The would be thief here is too bold
I am glad the thief didn’t have a gun.
Liberal run Denver.........it will just keep getting worse.
Lucky the thief didn't lock up.
It was nice of the theif to put the car in park before getting his ass beat 😂😂
So how was he able to access his car so easily 🤔
Why would you leave the car unlocked with it running.  Just asking to have it stolen.
Thats why you should have done more damadge
What punches?
That story was as lame as the so call "take down".
Cool story, but lock your damned car
Satisfied with the outcome, but yet a little disappointed this wasn't footage of Derrick Lewis 😕
This was set up this was probably one of his buddies to give him more Fame this video is fake as hell
For once the victim wins!😂😂😂
Ufc fighter no clue who this guy is
The really sad thing he probably didn't learn nothing and will be doing the sane thing hopefully I'm wrong
Nothing like a good knee, can fix stupid.
Staged. A real thief would have left it in gear.
I'm glad he learned it was not a good idea to leave his car on with no one in it. It's it's right to do so, but I'm glad he learned.
How did the car stop? It would’ve been in reverse or drive. Why would thief put it in neutral or park?  This is a False flag put on by the pigs, ufc and media.
That car thief also needs to learn to lock the car doors
🤦‍♂️ he left it unlocked and running 😂 it was a bait car
Ppl still leave cars running and unlocked 🤦🏾‍♀️
He was just getting his reperations.
Wait, people like literally leave their cars running?
ha ha ha!  Great job!
but in Korea we leave our cars running all the time going into stores and nobody ever steals your car.
Yeah... im gonna leave my car running in front of a bunch of thiugs
When I say, I bumped up the quality and volume jus to enjoy every second of this video.❤(So glad his car didnt keep rolling.) Mr. Williams, Im so proud of ur quick response.
Yaaaah I got reparations....uh oh..not today!
After 3rd knee he remembered that he is at gas station, and cameras are everywhere. I know, bummer.
Why did he leave his car unlocked, and running, in the first place ????
I just wanna know why people ain’t locking their doors! C’mon now!
Welcome to Democrat Denver.  What a shithole
If the perp didn't need an ambulance then he didn't get him good enought.
This guy is cool, he's the oy diabetic UFC fighter.
One of those good boys got a spanking . BUT MAMA SAYS he a good baby 👶
To bad he didn't knock him out cold as ice.
Strange that this Denver story was covered by a Raleigh-Durham TV station, considering that Raleigh-Durham leads the world in assaults and murders against bicyclists by a huge margin. Maybe you should cover the horror show that is your own city a bit more honestly.
Beautiful
This should be their fate everytime if they are spared a toe tag.
That Knee Is A Beast..!!.💐👑🙏
He got that Debo special
Another trying to collect his reparations. Damn it ! This idea of the reparations came from the demonrat party.
Shit happens
$3.64 for gas?!
See kids violence is the answers your teachers don’t have a clue what they are teaching you!
Taliban is ufc, would be car thief is U.S
Call the police.. but not for me
He sure taught the thief to lock his car.
MAMMA!!!! I wuz jus tryin to park his car an that bad man hit me in my head!!!
Plot twist. He jacked that dudes car
Never understood why you leave the car running. Someone explain how saving 6 seconds of your time is worth it
You got to beat them down, that was to easy!
Unlocked door. Ppffff. Too many shots to the skull. 😳
Did he even punch him at all maybe once?
If a guy leaves his car running and goes inside of a store, there is usually a good reason for that. I wouldn't consider taking that man's things.
She his face.
Punches and knees
lol
Fanny-Pack for the Win.
Who still leaves their car running in a gas station parking lot??
He left his car unlocked and running still… what an idiot. Deserved to get his car stolen
Why would you leave your car unlocked while it was running…? That’s really smart.
I have that exact same car😅
"...it's all about makin' that g.t.a."
Does the reporter not know the difference between punches and knees to the head? Lmao
That's cool, and I'm glad he wasn't harmed by the car thief. That could have turned out REALLY badly for either or both of them. I hope the car thief is brought to justice. He didn't simply try to steal a car, he was also giving the proverbial middle  finger to society. (The thief is fully to blame for what happened,  but it was really irresponsible of the victim to leave his car unlocked with the keys in it. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.)
Why anyone does that to begin with is beyond me
Naw he went home and iced that shit lmfao
If you have insurance it ain’t worth it. These boys & girls in Chicago shoot people for resisting a carjacking.
Wait...car unlocked and running?
Nah it was a suicide attempt.
Every dog has its day!
Says punches while dude gets 2 knees to the face. He should be looking at the video not the teleprompter
He sounds like Nate Diaz
He tossed some knees, not punches. That dude will have some goose eggs and bleeding.
This shit was weak....
He broke the law by leaving his vehicle running; would have taught him a lesson.
Maybe I'm old school but I'd be embarrassed to show this to anyone if this happened because I was naive enough to leave my car unlocked and above all running.
Knee lifts to the dome, thats the ol skool sh*t right there.
They both got a little bit of what they deserved.
Wait he couldn’t have gotten far though without the key
what an idiot.  why would you leave your car with the keys in the ignition and car running?  is that something you need to learn not to do?  man, another evidence that most people are stupid with no common sense.
Attempted theft of a Honda Civic.. Shocker...
He's got a kneed. A kneed for speed.
"Sheesh." Square ass reporter. 😂
too bad the thief didnt have a gun.
That’s not a crime in some cities but beating him for stealing property is. It’s a crazy world we live in
Let him go?  Weak.
I’m sorry, but why does this sound like a Dhar Mann title
666 views
If that had happened in California, Oregon or Washington , the victim would have been charged with assaulting the thief.
My son was running a tow truck business.   A guy called him out, and tried to rob him.  My son walked back to his truck, with the guy on his back trying to take him down.   trying to take a guy down, whom pulls chains for a living, is a bit difficult.   The only thing it really did, was have my son take extra precautions.   My son really only had one thought in his mind, get back in the truck.  But, after he thought about it, he wanted to chase the guy down.   He got angry.
I can't believe they're showing this racist attack #BLM
Yeah... Thief is the ame type of people. I am not surprised.
In today’s climate if he would’ve held him any longer the car jacker would’ve sued him for kidnapping
Thief: it's just a prank bro!
More like few good knees to the face !
And the would be thief jogged away...
Who leaves their car unlock especially running lol meat heads lol
Now if it was the police , riot
It looks like the UFC fighter got some punches back thou .. lol
Jesus Christ loves you so much that he died on the cross for you
Amazing the would be thief put the car in park! Dumb luck!
the guy deserved to get his car taken for leaving it running
That's my bike punk!
Why did he leave keys in the vehicle?
Never leave it running you say I'm 40 years old I was taught when I was 10 never leave my vehicle running because it might get stolen
is it an american thing to leave your car running and unlocked?
Never underestimate the power of a fanny pack....
Filmed on a potato
Dude really risked it all for a honda smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Anyone else see the title on the news
That’s Denver for you.
Car thief left crying for his Momma.
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Can't have shit it Denver, fuckin homeless people everywhere trying to take your stuff
Unconscious within 3 more knees. He didn’t block those first two.
Everyone wants a Honda Civic
Hey there Sherlock, how about you not leave your car running unattended in the first place? Idiot.
Must be a UFC fighter because of his CTE he forgot his keys in the car.
When old people say  sheeeessh 🤢🤮
“UFC fighter pounds car thief” 💀
Why would he leave his car unlocked and running tho? Cmon man…glad it worked out this time tho
“Sheesh”
https://youtu.be/ATiYoo3WEjI
Dislikes here are the car thieves.
People stealing cars these days have to be idiots. You’re going to get caught bro!!! This isn’t the 80’s and 90’s
Ole boy held his head crying, "I'm going home to tell my mom!"
I wouldn't be surprised if this thief tries to press charges for getting beat up lol
Why do people still leave their keys in their cars with the engine running when they go into a store? I see this nearly every day.
This dude is wearing a Fanny pack 🤣
They had to have found his hospital records, probably had a concussion and those don't always have an immediate effect.  Sometimes, the brain has to swell...
Lmao just reminded me of grand theft auto.  When you yank the civilians out there car and beat em up 😂
Maybe he shouldn’t have left his car running without anyone inside idk sounds stupid to me 😂💀
That's how u handle these tough guys.
the only thing a learn is that the news guy say sheeesh
That was ur fault baby boy u should never live ur car 🚗 running plus unlocked come on son u  no better
I'll never understand why people leave their car running.
He jacked his own car.
leaving your car unlock and running is a stupid move..
I thought this was gonna be footage of Derrick Lewis knocking out a car jacker
Kind of a no brainer to secure your car before walking away
Jesus Christ died for sinners including you, on the cross with his own blood for your personal sins, repent and get saved or perish with the lost wicked world. God's word is coming to pass, it will only go downhill
https://youtu.be/7v0cJXhxIU8
UFC 1 Was held in Denver
Looks like he just left his keys in the car. Dude took off easily and these newer cars are push to start.
Who the fuck leaves their car running? So stupid. Glad the thief wasn’t able to get away with it
So you dont have any news to give?
That's why I am so eager to learn MMA.
L
Shocked he put the car in park before getting out. Unless maybe he forgot to take off the e-brake or something.
Looks like the car thief wants to run to his mommy.
This isn't police brutality, thankfully, so there won't be mass riots and crap like that.

I'm just saying if the man looks like that AND wears a fanny pack you're probably going to get hurt if you do something stupid like this to him.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Man can't wait for gta 6 and made a temporary game
UFC fighter driving a honda civic lol
Oh I'm pretty sure he'll try to do it again, only lesson he learned is to lock the doors next time.
Good ending to the story.  But if the would be car jacker had a gun how do you think his MMA skills would do against bullets? In this day and age more people  carry firearms-  good guys and bad guys- everyday.  All due respect to the UFC, but the rules of the octagon do not apply  to a real world life or death situation.  And there's no "tapping out" in real life..  Only when the coroner zips up the body bag.
This story is very awesome but the title is straight out of a daar man video or something lmao.
The Gods and spiritual truth......he keeps doing that leaving your car running.....that's pure arrogance and ignorance of stupidity and no common sense and street smart and the right education and upbringing of knowledge.....he should count his blessings and be grateful.....next time someone will drive off with car and have a gun and he'll get himself shot.....the owner of the car got very very very lucky....
He gave him knees to the face and socked his head n made his nose bleed 😂😂
That's a fearless firefighter.
Should be able to just shoot people. Definitely would never do it again after that.
Why does he think he's so cool he can leave his car running in the hood and no tweakers are gone hop in like they did he try to steal the car 🤪
This is funny he is the stupidest and dumbest person. I know stupid is isn't a word but he definitely makes that words sound like it is one. Instant karma
All jokes aside, fact of the matter is real men wear famny packs
0:33 did you notice the brontosaurus logo on the gas station? Remind me of Dinoco from Pixar movies such as toy story! Thief is messing with a wrong person!
Love to see this.
Went to go see his mommy after head boo-boo.
BLM tho….
The real lesson is to lock the door while you stealing it
he is gonna cry leaving the car...lol
When they said UFC fighter I came here expecting someone with a better record than 0-2
Vote BLUE- this will come to a town near near you!
0:43 sheesh
Who needs 4k security surveillance for crime right.
He left his car unlocked and running???
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  Have a blessed day, brothers and sisters in Christ! : )
When I saw the words “Thief ,stealing , UFC fighting car” I knew it was over for the thief
At this moment he knew he f**ked up
Sheesh
If that was a cop he’d be scrutinized for it. Cops are very nice compared to what’s around waiting for the green light 😗
Same shit herr
But why would you leave your car running unattended while going into the store? Both of them are dumb as hell.
"I wish I was able to apprehend him.  Not to do anymore damage." *in his mind* "I wish I had apprehended him to do more damage."
HTF is gas 3:45 😫😬🤧
0:28. Being an idiot and leaving the car On and Unlocked
Blm activists
This "UFC" fighter is lucky the perp didn't have a gun or a deadly weapon. Real life is not UFC.
SHEEEEEEEEEEESH
WHO THE FUCK LEAVES THEY"RE CAR RUNNING, THATS HIS FAULT LMAOOO

Good job ( coward runs away) imagine if it was an elderly person?

Still watching xqcL
He knew he fucked up first punch
ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !
I never did understand people that leave their car running and then walk away from it.  Always seemed like a foolish thing to do that had no upside.  Is the car not going to start up again?  It saves what….2-3 seconds to turn it off and back on?
He must be the tank in his adventuring group. That fanny pack is like a legendary taunt item.
Ayyy this is my friends brother!!! 💪🏽💪🏽
And people fall for this
Is UFC any more real than WWE?
It is shocking that in the USA the thief wasn’t armed.  The NRA better get on that.
0:44 It had to be done... SHESH
Oop here we go
My boi said Shessh
This could’ve ended really badly for the UFC guy had the thief tried to speed off in reverse.
Wtf us going on
Only regret wearing fanny pack on nation tv
burp
He left it running on purpose. He wanted to whoop some ass lol
I’m sure the car owner will be arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault (aggravated because he’s a professional fighter and could have killed the POS with one good blow) for not letting the theft suspect just get out of the car and walk away without confrontation? Oh, and the thief will be called a “person of interest” since we probably need to ask him if he thought the car was actually his, and that would mean this was all just a huge misunderstanding… no harm, no foul, right!
Can we just cutting off their left hands? This shit is getting way the hell out of control.
GTA....
That's not true. The bother just needed a car to get to work c'mon man were all being hunted that's what LeBron the Oscar worthy actor told me to think...
"Protect yourselves at all time, touch gloves and let's have a clean fight."  "HERE WE GO!" 😜
That chyron caption sounds like a bad porn parody.
My reaction to this very interesting video:  0:44
Not me... I wish he would have pounded the living hell out of the thief!!!
"Williams wants people to learn that you need to lock your doors and not leave your car running." -Host   Uhm, that's basically an invitation for theft. Common sense, no matter where you go, take the keys with you no matter who you are.
Those guys are something "raw". Good job fella. Keep that spirit.
Loooool
oh come on how fake is this this is another attempt like a Jesse Smollett video this guy has no career he's trying to bring some attention to himself that's why the guy was never caught or allowed to run away so fake I'm surprised you two even allows this nonsense and we all know the news is fake so they're going to buy it up if they didn't contracted in the first place UFC needs to and must be investigate it when they do fake publicity stunts like this
If I was him, I would've made him tap out and promise not to do it again.

Who the hell leaves their car unlocked and running as you go instead a store??
Viral Get it https://youtu.be/hdbewCT9Ju0
he hit him so hard the car put itself in park
The thief then jumped a fence into the k9 training facility
Left his car unlocked and running with keys in the ignition. 🤷🏻‍♂️
What is the twist is that it was really by the guy who is driving and that was a carjacking
Leaving keys in the car and unlocked is the dumbest thing to do at a gas station ever.    It literally takes 2 seconds to restart your car again
Ion seen mma guys get destroyed in real street fights ion take on any kind of fighter ufc or not but dude had that coming
Haha dude looked like he was crying 😭
I mean why would he leave his car unlocked and running
Self control is key
You pick the wrong car fool
Williams seemed pretty relaxed
Jeez, who in their right mind leaves their car unlocked & running?
that thief got his lil ass thumped, heck the UFC Fighter took it easy on this "thing" , lesson dont mess with stuff thats not yours. it could have been much worse for that punk, fun too watch though...LOL!
The thief was nice enough to put the car on park while he was getting his head kneed
His one regret should have been leaving his car unlocked.
It doesn’t matter who the vehicle belongs to, no one should ever steal! Ever!
Perp in court: Sir, I was just having a flashback. I used to work at Spiffy Lube, drive other folk's cars all day long  til it gave me PTSD and, sir, this courthouse is dusty! Ya'll need a air filter bad!
Can't be messing around with the fanny pack dudes. They got something for your ass!
Ah,sweet poetic justice 😆🤣
Good on him for stopping the thug but he’s a dummy for leaving his car running and unlocked.
Maybe he was just trying to offer valet service 😂
I see it all the time,people  invite the perp  by leaving it on AND open, come on guys learned that  at 16 yrs old
When someone has a face that looks like natural Botox don’t mess with them.
Good thing the thief didn’t blow him away!
He’s trained  his whole life for that moment
Thief had a couple knees for lunch
The thief running away with his hand on one eye was epic it means the guy hit him in eye. Well done.
Good for you Jordan, this was a well deserved and over due whooping that this criminal obviously needs. I hope he's caught and charged for being a menace to society.
man really left his car running tho
He didn't regret wearing that fanny pack though?
Gas is 3.64 a gallon over there ? Wow .
Is it dumb for that hooligan to steal the car or is it dumber to leave it running and unlocked?
Buy manual transmission cars. Theives nowadays cant drive them lmao.
Bravo 👏👏👏
We are being invaded by the world with open borders wonder why media never says anything about it
https://youtu.be/ueDmMqL-Cns
Guy probably also leaves his front door wide open while not at home....🙄
Would have served him right getting it stolen leaving it running with the keys in the car.
Car jacker just gonna use u car 2 go 2 church you white racist!
“Wrong car bro!” 🤬 lol
I never understand why people leave their car running while they go inside the store...it's just asking for trouble.
I rather be a average iq guy who remembers to lock his car than some dumb ufc guy who’s only ability is to throw cool punch and can’t even lock his car
the ufc fighter is a racist! That black dude might need the car for an emergency!
“Sheesh.”
The real spark where you at? I am waiting for your version
Never mess with someone who has cauliflower ears AND a fanny pack.
call the ambulance 🚑 but not for me
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer if he didn't immediately think of restraining the thief.
"Lock your car and never leave it running" bro, im not gonna lie, he should have scene it coming. Why would you go inside a store without locking your car, and STILL RUNNING????
I think this is the only time I can say  Play stupid games win stupid prizes to both parties. Like who leaves the car unlocked and running.  And who the hell tries to steal cars these days. With CCTV it’s kinda impossible to get away.
Props to ufc dude.. but i bet he left his car running while getting a quick snack.. hate when people leave thier car on even going to a atm, just turn it off!
I love shit like this 😂
The main takeaway is don't leave your car running unattended. You don't need to be a UFC fighter for that.
Dude the phanny pack!!!!
I wish the news media, CBS 17, and WILLIAMS would get away from the "frick and frack" of this story and tell people what they need to know.  A boxer or martial artist, any such person can defend themselves if attacked , Using deadly force to defend property is another matter and in some jurisdictions if that person is severely hurt or dies; you are considered to have applied the use of a deadly weapon because of your training. If you do not have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on defense lawyers, know the law before applauding or encouraging this kind of retaliation.
The way that man was holding his face, made me think he had a real tail between his legs. I would have never walked into the store with my car though. He should know this, he looks like he grew up in the hood.
When your playing on a Minecraft smp and the house your stealing from belongs to the admin
This is the equivalent of being in a marathon with Usain Bolt
Ya he could have detained him but they would have just let him go in a couple of hours later anyway lol
He left it running?🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ He luck out! the guys was almost....🚗💨
Yeah, but he let him get away..so; lucky for him the dude didn't lock the door as he was getting away, or he would've been crying all day for being dumb - leaving his car unlock with keys inside, what a moron//
He’s an idiot why leave your keys in the car
The way he ran away holding his head omg 😭
This si like robbing a gun store with a baseball bat
THANK GOD HE DIDN'T PULL A GUN ON HIM
Do more damage please
Haha the bad guy should have locked the car door 😄😄😄
That perp needed lead.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
Both of them should’ve locked the car
Ummm, all you people warning about what never to do if you are a criminal, how bout never leave your car running. How completely stupid is that?
Gawd. It’s 2021 in Denver and people still leave their car running and open!  That UFC fighter is dumb!  But he can fight!!!
Derrick Lewis is gonna buy this man some Popeyes.
It would of been considered a hate crime if he kicked the thief’s ass
hol up is that a fanny pack? steroids
Don't want your car stolen.......LOCK IT AND TAKE THE KEYS.....ITS THAT SIMPLE
I would have sued. How dare he assault me while I still his vehicle.
Talk about instant Karma. 👍
Must have been a manual good thing the low life couldn't drive 🏒
You never know who's $hit you might be stealing.  Car thief - What an idiot...
This looks like what most ppl would do in this situation, I would even say he is lucky he didnt get shot.  The car jacker that is...
Well he kinda asked for it leaving his car running stupid 😂
Say it with me now  LOCK MY CAR TAKE THE KEY WITH ME gooood!
Yeah, folks forget some of us are nice because we know how nasty we can be.
Good. Stop messing with Denver😡😡😡😡😡😡 Cool that everyone that lives there reacts quickly in 1-2 seconds, even old people are defensive, They never forget to exercise and will always go to Kong Fu classes.
I don't think you should ever leave your keys in the car. Not in this crazy world we live in. Good job though. Good lesson for the rest of us.lol
It looks like a set up .
Usual jogger.
What idiot leaves a car running with the keys in it in 2021?
That happened in Albuquerque also, this guy was stealing from the store next to the UFC gym. They chased him down the beat him down.
he shoulda thrown the finisher
Lucky dude didn’t have a gun shit hero be dead frfr
BlM ✊🏿 got caught
I'm surprised he even open the door,,most cars locks when they put it into gear
👀🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn, 2021, still gotta tell people to lock they’re car and don’t leave it running. I’ll never get it. Is turning off your car and locking the doors, like getting a prostate exam? It takes two seconds. People lock they’re door before leaving the house, but won’t lock and turn they’re car off.
All muscle no brain. Why would anyone leave car running and unlock when going into a store. Sorry but this guy asking to have his car get stolen.
Dude ran away like Red from Friday when Deebo took his chain....🤣🤣🤣
what's unbelievable is gas is only 3.64 a gallon!
I can't believe, in this day and age, people are still leaving their keys in their cars with it still running.
Homie must of got punched in the head one too many times, how the hell you going to leave your keys in the car running especially in Denver......🤦‍♂️
#ProtectTheCentury
Learnt something here, That we should always Lock our damn car..!! 😂😂
Bro should have just done more damage and then the fool wouldn't be out there to do it again
Punches? Avid ufc fan those were kness to the face 🤣🤣 🦵🤯
Why would he NOT lock his doors? THANKS for NOT locking your doors and thanks to the pseudo-thief, too. Without his stupidity we would have never seen this great footage of how he got his -ass- head handed to him on that day. 😂😂😂
LEKISHA JAMES: WE ARE LITERALLY STEALING EVERYDAY 👦🏾👦🏾🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️
Don't leave the keys in the car dumba$$
What did you expect in this day and age leaving your car running and unlocked!!!!!
If you're going to leave your car running at the gas station, you deserve to have your shit taken.
Take the keys with you and lock the car door, use your head
Why in the hell would you leave your car running?!?! So stupid.  Good catch though.
Stupid is, as stupid does!
Atleast the thief  put the car in park b4 getting his butt kicked😂
You have to be stupid to leave a car open and worse with the keys in it.
I don’t know why people leave their cars running. Thieves are opportunists.
Dude ran to his mother crying
look at his ears in the store before you went out there and took that car that cauliflower  ears always gives them away he definitely been fighting for a while
There are people that will beat you until they are satisfied and their satisfaction may be past your ability to survive !
I call bs on that one. Looks like a setup
Stupid MMA guy…. Brain damaged and doesn’t turn off / lock his car
Well maybe not today, the guy is going to have to take a few days off to thank his lucky star that it did not put him in the hospital or worst lol
Those were some nasty Knees tho.. ✝️✅❤👏😇🙏💪🤣
He ran away holding his head, bet he got some knowledge that day on what not to do 🤣
Not the ending i came here for. MAF. He should be asleep
NO, you have have done more damage, apparently jail doesn't deter them....maybe a couple shattered hands might clear up the picture.
Maybe the guy trying to steal the car was tired of jogging !! I’m sure he was going to return it in due time
Played this back a few times and I cannot see him punching at all!  I can clearly see the thief holding his injuries though LOL
Sheeesshh
Colin Flaherty Don’t make the black kids angry read it Sheeple
most badass part is dudes fanny pack
F him. Super dangerous to leave car out front running.  You think you so important you leave your car running and go in the store. Any child can hop in that car and drive.  He gave his car to that guy. Free car guys.
The car was unlocked and running??????????????????????????  Why is this world so stupid??????????????????????????????
I don’t know why people don’t lock their car door or leave their car running! This is not the 1950’s lock your house doors too!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 that shook the pos,might think twice before trying to steal again,next time might not be so lucky,
Oh please, Williams’ only regret was that he couldn’t  beat the stew out of that thief.
He left his car running?? I don't know who is more stupid here... The wanna be thief or the UFC fighter? Use common sense people 🚗
There were no punches. He only yanked buddy out of the car,  then the little turd ran away.
His fault, he left it running...
Holy shit. Hahaha 😂 hahahaha 🤣
Nah. That's a POP-POP situation. Must not have a gun in the car if left it unlocked and running like I e that. Silly really.
😂😂leave people stuff alone
He would not have done that in the UK,  The drive would have been on the other side
How about not leaving your keys in the ignition 😑
Lmao was head holding his face as he ran off!!!????
hell yeah that's nice maybe he learned his lesson never to steal from the wrong person
He cover he’s face, because every see on the news🙈
Lock your doors 😏
He should have immobilized the perp and call the police. Perp will just donit to someone else.
Honestly, who leaves there car running unattended these days. Too many punches to the head. Lesson for both involved.
didn't even whoop his ass, loser....
Wow $3.64 a gallon ?
Left it unlocked and running? Nobody stole anything he was giving it away FFS
IT WAS THE INVITATION TO STEEL CAR, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF HE IS A BRAINLESS STUPID U F C FIGHTER
He got beat the breaks off him whit his stealing self..GOD bless that guy for defending his property no one have the right to take your stuff .that thief got more headache that he ever got in his life,i bet you he will go to church now
Fun fact: if you leave the car because you're too lazy to take your keys, you're a dumbass. And you don't have your car stole so much as you gave it away.
Doesn't the narrative of this story contradict the usual narrative by the media to let them take your car
In my country the UFC Fighter will end up in jail for punching the car thief.
There was a time when horse thieves would hang.
Remember - if you steal a car, lock the doors else you might get dragged out by the owner of said car and beaten up.
These people don't deserve second chances lmao you in my car now buddy let's take a little drive
Remember the good ol' days when people mainly stole or broke into cars at night? 😂....I wonder if some kind of, I don't know, so called "social movement" changed that hmm??🤔🤔
i saw the flying left knee went up twice.
What kind of idiot leaves their car running unattended in a major urban area? Obviously, high IQ is not a requirement for UFC...
When your a criminal you take that risk  majority of the time you will have no problem but you will  eventually come into  contact with someone with training in self defense training which every one should know.
Classic
He's ok
Did he leave his car running?
Evidently, all those kicks to the head took their toll, because anybody with half a brain left knows to always lock your car, & NEVER leave it running!
People don't realize the gap between a skilled fighter and a regular person is massive. The gap between a skilled fighter and the 1% who compete in the UFC is even bigger...
Jordan Williams handle it perfectly.  Though if the man that tried to take the car had a gun,  the story would not be successful.  It is after all,  just insured property.  Jordan did not hurt the man.  Some people think that killing a person for stealing your property is legal.  It is not,  though I understand the feeling of wanting to.
He was actually running away from the power of the Fanny pack.
Lucky that wasn’t my car lol after you leave drive the doors lock automatically I’d have been assed out UFC fighter or not in my case not.
STOP LEAVING YOUR CAR KEYS IN YOUR VEHICLES WHILE BEING AWAY FROM IT PEOPLE!, NO MATTER IF YOU JUST WANT TO GET SOMETHING REAL QUICK FROM SOMEWHERE!!
_"Ese caco fue por lana y salio trasquilado."_
Who in the right mind leaves their car running with the keys and everything 🤦‍♂️ dumb ass
..'UFC fighter' my ass. A real one would've made pizza outa that joggers head.
Nah you should have put him to sleep perminantly to teach a lesson to the other scumbags out there! 😆
Idiot left his keys inside the car with it running.. can't fix stupid..
another white supremacist stealing cars again.
Bait car 🤫
He didn't  do Crap If He was able  to Get Him in A Choke hold and Lay some Face Hammer s then would have Been a Really Good Lesson.
Never leave your keys in your car!
Turn off the engine and take the keys every time you leave your car. As in ALWAYS EVERY TIME!!! If you are a UFC fighter, kick the effing crap out of the perp. Beat him to a pulp while waiting for someone else to call the cops.
UFC bait car episode one
Car thieves are like head lice.. Sneaky and pesky.. Kick his arse...
Is that a fanny pack? 😂😂😂
The thief was polite to leave the car. lol
He about to go cry in his car
He left his car unlocked and running… 🙄
Joe. You are in the white House to cancel the key stone pipeline,  PRINT money, apply HIGH taxes . You called to SURGE  the border,  HIGH gas prices. Keep your promises. Leave Cuba alone just SEND tax payer money over to that land like every other country, get troops out of Afghanistan. Go to white house channel leave a thumbs up or  thumbs down . Promises kept joe.
You left your car running and unlocked in Denver? That’s like walking barefoot in a park in San Francisco, or wearing a red hat in Portland. You’re begging for theft and violence.   Good for him for stopping that guy (although had the perp carried a gun this would be a morbid story), but make better choices.
Sheesh
Surprise!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LMAO YEAH GOOD JOB DUDE 💪💓
#likeaboss
Why did you leave the car running? Dumb shit deserves to lose his car.
Sheeesh.......
Wish we had more people like the fighter in the major defended cities. We need some type of intervention, its getting out if hand.  Afraid to go out now, especially at night.
Even if the cop got him he would be on the streets in 12 stealing more cars.
he's an idiot for leaving the keys in the ignition!!
At least he put the car in park 😂😂😂
Soooo alll that time it took him to put the car in reverse not 1x he thought hey let me lock this door 🤔👌🏾
That was a publicity stunt
There’s a lot of UFC fighters from out here
🤣😂He ran away holding his head
Left the car unlocked and running! No smart at all!
Thief: “teehee teehee teeheeeeee OooOoOooOoUmMmMffFff” lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤕🤕🤕😂😂😂😔😔😔😄😄😄
Lock yur car my friend
He should wish he didn't leave the keys in the car.
um, why NOT lock the car in the first place? That is why you have keys with you, to lock a car when getting out in public areas.
Rule #1: always lock your door even if for a few minutes
Who's dumb enough to leave their car running well going inside a gas station
So this car owner was stupid to keep his car running
He should've gave him a swift kick in the arse😂😂😂😂
That wasn’t an attempt car theft. It was an attempt to give someone a gift. DUMMY!!!!! Don’t leave your car running, door unlocked and keys in it.  You can actually be sued if he stole it and killed someone.  There is a law in regards to leaving your keys in the car and running while it is unattended.
What! "Learn to lock your car". How bout learn how to fight.
Listen to this guy, SO HAPPY!!
Genius, leave your car running and unlocked.
So much for punchers Common sense ! Leaves Car running LOL
Yesterday I was putting groceries in my car. I noticed car running next to me. There we're 2 young kids in a running car alone. I looked around thinking adult was close. No one! These kids were like 7 -10 horsing around. I was shocked! Idiot parents out there.
Talk about locking your car door... if the thief had locked it he never would have been caught  😂😂
Say his name... "LeBron James"
The big mistake was leaving your car keys inside with the door unlock this way it could have been all avoided.
Are you kidding me man?  Where's all the people with cameras cheering this guy on when there's actually something to see?  I don't know how he could stop himself from really hurting that guy.   He's gonna be out later tonight doing the same shit.
This was so funny I watched it several times.
That seems a bit tame. Was this staged?
Kinda satisfying...
"Throw hands". I hate when so called professionals do that.
CBS News, change the title to 'Dumb and Dumber.'
He did that in Colorado what’s wrong with him that’s not a liberal state like California. He’s trying to get himself killed. I support red states we don’t see that very often. We actually prosecute criminals
“Innocent black man attacked while stealing a car” -cnn
What do you expect when you leave your car running in front of a convenience store? That should be his other regret.
Dumb ass left his car running!
"155 LBS the Official weight of this unknown UFC fighter"- UFC weight announcer. Dana- "I love everything about this kid!" McGregor-"Who da fook is that GuY!?"
Ha just when they think cops and a bait car are the biggest threat they seem to forget car owners can sometimes be more dangerous themselves.
No shit? Don't leave your car in the open in liberal cities with it running? Pshhh no way.
💪Way to go. He was very lucky he got away from him. The same thing happened to my son. He and his wife were accosted by a young man with a knife. My son was a Professional Cage Fighter, LOL. Who is in his 40s. As my, son had him on the ground, his wife was yelling at the young man your getting your ass beat by a Leukemia patient.  Which, I believe, was why he targeted him. My Son walks with a limp and they were walking his service dog. But YOU NEVER KNOW who your robbing.
When he rubbed his head 😭😭
"Pounds" him ???.... All I saw was.... NOTHING....
Now what if this coward had a gun?It doesnt matter how tough you are .Im glad it went down the way it did and it would have been nice if had pummeled the guy. But a car is not worth dying for.And it happens all the time..That is what insurance is for
Punched him back to the hood
I am so proud of the car owner...i bet the would be thief was shocked...
Lock your door and don’t leave it running. No shit?
It's against the law in many places to leave your car running. It is in Texas
Lol
He stole a car a block away to drive himself to the hospital.
Oh Jordan, I wish you could have done more damage. You know if an elderly person or small woman  tried to stop this type the perp would beat them senseless.
Looks like the dude was holding his head crying
This is like my soul verses the heathens 😒
He’s an idiot for just leaving his keys like that . Play stupid games to win stupid prizes
Leaves car running & unattended, surprised it was stolen. Fighter logic.
That's how u handle these tough guys. Never be the tough guy just be a man of your people. 🥊 😈 🥊
Tip of the day: If you’re going to steal someone’s car right from under them, be sure to lock the door so they don’t pull your ass out.
I bet that’s the last time he leaves his car running while he runs into the gas station. This happens all the time and most people don’t get their car back.
That's a whole other kinda bait car
Dame.....he just lost alllllllll his street credit. Hand over your card sir.
Talk about getting knee to the face
I NEVER leave my car unlocked. It's a dumb move to leave it unlocked.
Wait so he puts the car in park so that he could get pulled out?! What kind of car thief is this?
I have a piece a shit truck that if I shut off, it will not start back up until the engine cools off again. And the back windshield is broken so I shrink wrapped it, and the doors don't lock, and driver side roll up window has to be pulled up by hand because it's off track. So when I go inside a store I leave it running.  When I come back to it, I'm not surprised it's not gone.
I'm sure the Neo Nazi Left will charge the UFC fighter with hurting the theif!
That's the perp who decided to get his real estate license LOL
good video but why leave it running?  Still reminds me of the 14 & 15 yr olds who carjacked a woman's car a few years ago.  Didn't even make it a few feet when they realized the vehicle was a MANUAL. (she calmly got out like she was handing the car to them and smiled as they struggled)  teens arrested and woman got to keep her car.
🤣🤣🤣! not so funny $3.64gal gas
Dam that gas high
The Fanny pak did it
Who is dumb enough to leave the car running? He still should have beat the crap out of that guy!
It’s nice to see some happy news for a change
The Ad.  If you hearing improved so much how do you hear the ad on television to begin with?
He learned a lesson that day
fake crime.... driver didnt lock the door and put the car in park....why isnt the car rolling
Awesome, and respect to the almost victim for being so kind and not wanting to inflict more damage on the guy, That takes class 👍
It looks like a few good knees were thrown, not punches.
Damn didn’t you know that’s what they teach you in school car theft then drug dealing 101 and for the girls how to use only fans that’s American education today
duh lock it and dont leave it running.
He went running just like when my mom used to throw me the chancla 🩴🤣🤣🤣
How about you take your keys with you, GUY! That would be first thing too do to not get car jacked
Good job! But unfortunately the only thing that UFC fighter taught the thief, was that after he jumps inside someone else's car, to lock the door! That UFC fighter should have done a lot of damage to that guy and punished him and hurt him bad, otherwise he'll just do it again to someone else! When you see all these videos on YouTube, do you actually think that this is the first time all of these thieves do this stuff!? No! This is how they make a living they steal stuff from other people! Right now that thief should be in the prison hospital with broken arms and legs!
Did he learn to lock it now and not let it just run
Kickin ass wearing a fanny pack love it lol
About four months ago I had a customer get his truck stolen, which he left unlocked with the keys in it running!  they proceeded to talk to me for 15 minutes, not once glancing at his truck. I didn't know somebody was getting in his truck that wasn't with him already... it's not my truck. It's his damn responsibility. maybe the irresponsible should have things like that happen to them cuz you  really don't care much about it, obviously. And this affects other insured drivers rates to go up depending on the type vehicle they are insuring.
Knees and bows….. He picked the wrong car….. And…. Gas…..$3.64 a gallon……yep……he was getting the beat down! 🤣😅😂
That car thief tapped out he should tapped on the accelerator but tapped outside and ran off .
Anyone that leaves their car running is inviting a thief to take it!!! Car thefts are up and a simple old school Club on the steering wheel will deter most thieves to look for an easier score. I've seen 3 Mazda SUV's abandoned in my back alley in the last month. They all had the ignition switch pulled and ended up stolen!!! A Club is cheaper that the hassle of getting it stolen and having to get it fixed!!!
Really lame he let him go
Silly BLM
Fake.
The only damage was the spot on the driver's seat.  I hope the insurance can help out with that.
Honestly.  He deserved to have his car stolen. What kind of a special idiot do you have to be to leave it that way?
Here in Australia its illegal to leave your car unlocked & unattended in a public place. Its that way so this does not happen & peoples cars don't get taken & create a public risk as the cops try to get it back for you because you were to dumb to lock it.
All I saw were knee kicks.
I don't understand. #1Guy steals a car, #2 puts it in park when the owner runs a "CAR" down. #3 thief opens the door just to get beat up...... these crooks today need help
The most legendary reporter ever, sheesh
He'll probably be sued.
Ok but, who’s the dumb ass who didn’t lock their car
Hopefully that theif learned a valuable lesson in kneestrikes😁😄
looks fake. the camera just happened to be moving with the car and then stops with the car. also, nothing about police being called. also, why did the "thief" put the car in park ?
This is what happens when people aren’t held accountable for their actions.
How many times have I seen this idiocy now??  Unlocked and running?  Really?  What the hell? Never in my life, not one time have I done this.  Unbelievable fools.
Foolishly leaves the car running..
How was the door unlocked when he was driving away? When you put the car in drive it automatically locks the doors
I leave my truck running when I make a quick stop. The thugs don't want what this veteran can bring down.
If you leave your car while its unlocked and running .... what can I say, you're an idiot
Disappointed the thief wasn’t killed.
If only he could lock his doors as well as he can lock joints.
STAGED AGAIN
The way he beat em and then just watched em run and cry😂😂
Lol
AWESOME RESULTS..... But sir u should know better not to leave ur car running and unlocked.
Thou shalt not steal! but if you do, you best not take from a guy who beats the crap out of people for a living!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Exactly, never leave your car keys in the ignition when you are out of the car, even for one second. Twenty years ago, my uncle’s car was driven off by an opportunistic thief at a service station and was never seen again.
I agree with the people applauding the UFC fighter. However, the whole thing could have been prevented if that same UFC fighter would have locked his car. Still not sure why people leave their car doors unlocked in public places...in this day and age. The ones who leave their car running while they're inside a store are even worse...cause that's just a waste of gas. Plus, by leaving their car running, it's even more likely that that person will get their car stolen than someone who has the car off but doors unlocked.
Got his ass beat by a Ninja in a fanny pack😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Who the foook is this guy
Don't forget to never leave your car running and unlocked in a gas station parking lot... Genius words to live by.
Shouldn't be hard for the police to find the car thief. Just look for someone with two golf ball size hematomas on his forehead
I think the real news is the gas price 3.64  where that at
Why did he leave his keys in the car?
but why did he stop the car? he could've dragged the car owner with the car.
If this had been a regular Joe Shmuck would this even made the news???
He should have broke hiz necklaces
Damn ........$3.64 for gas ...... Thanks Biden .
People stop leaving your car running and unlock while inside the store.
Forget the car thief 🤔 did  yall peep thos gas prices?🤣🤣🤣
A few muay thai that knees to the head 👍
Lmao. That fool holding his wittle bitty ear cause the big UFO fanny pack wearing HERO kicked his car jacking no respect A$$ !!! 👍👍 😂😂😂😂  I mean jerked his butt out that car like a pro. 😂😠😂  A pro UFC fighter 😂😂😂😂
Nothing to see here, just some minority guy reinforcing stereotypes.
He should have done some major dental work on that punk
The real noises inside the car:*moan**moan*
This guy showed mercy. Unfortunately I was expecting more. Next video please.
Came for fanny pack jokes.... wasn't disappointed
Why didn't he put him on the ground??
UFC fighter is dum what if the bad guy had a gun . It’s only a Honda Civic bro this would be different if it was a camaro or mustang
I wish I was able to apprehend him….  Just lock your car bro.
$3.64 per gallon!?!
UFC fighter assaults unarmed black man.
Bet his eye look like Reds from Friday dammmmmmn !!!!
Just when you think no one will steal your car... someone steals it.
How did he start it was it left ruining or keys in it.  Or was he just good picking the lock and a little slow and over match by someone with skills.
In some cities you’ll get a ticket if someone steals your car if you left it running and the door unlocked lol
This where you wanna be when Cena comez back!?!
Was th man skin clr
Haha another bad ass criminal shitting on themselves when they become the victim. Way to go Jordan
Maybe don't leave your car running..
In my life I have found that MOSTLY the folks that are skilled in self defense are super nice n well mannered..... someone else might have shot or stabbed that dip ass theif.... that fighter coulda held the theif but ptolly didn't wanna deal with potential assault charges as his hands are legally registered weapons in most places 🤔
Shin break stop that running shit real quick.
Oh I thought a lot more serious to happen to that thief but still he got his car back so it's all good.
Good thing the car parked itself 😭
He'll just have a gun next time he goes to steal a car.
Oh come on, he left the car running? He automatically made himself and his car a target.
fanny pack!
That looks like it was bait.
Don't leave your car running when you go inside . That is exactly what these losers are waiting for
That’ll teach him a lesson lmfao 🤣 I want my Mommy.
That dude got some knots on his head 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was I seeing two illegal knees while the perp was on his seat??
Sure..you should have had the guy arrested..how did he start your car so fast??
someone had a few pop knots on his head
Lol I got a ufc ad before this video
nice knees
Its was just footage for a new GTA game coming out.
Knees not punchs
Leaves key in the car with the engine running ... not too bright and obviously doesn't care about the environment buy hey let's make him out to be a hero anyway!
Ok but who leves the car not locked, with the key inside and running?!
Dude has a flashback of his kids days of him dad slapping his head .
Hahaha dum fuck , dude should have lit him up low key would have been even more funny to see
That knee hit  him so hard that he was holding his head while running weak asf sweat justice 😂😂👌💯
Dude was like not even my gang member boss don’t even hit that hard .
Honda Civic!
He run away like the kid from Hancock 🤣
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿
A couple knees to the head!! Ouch
🤣
If ever become a successful celebrity I want him to be my bodyguard
Dude was lucky the thief stopped. He could have been seriously hurt if the thief floored in reverse while the guy was grabbing him.
Fighter is a dumb azz for leaving his car running.
I think this was entrapment. Who leaves there car running at a convenience store unless you want someone to steal it so you can pulverize them legally.
With so much negative news out there it's nice to come across a feel-good video like this.
Great job Mr. Williams!! Hats off to you. 👏🏾👏🏾
it's a good thing that he has better fighting skills than brains!
I make 175k a year and drive a Civic Hatch and get flack all the time for it. Some of us just dont have lives held hostage by social validation. Ive always viewed it severely beneath me (social validation).  Ive always gotten a kick of watching people get angry and all disappointed cause Im not living to their standards/expectations of me.  Lol
Dang 3.64 for gas. Must be nice
Ahhhhh
Mamaaaaaaaa Help meeeeeee
Who Cares About This BLM killing Each Other??
"When I wants it, eyes take it." -- Book of Joggerism, chapter 4, verse 3.
Why would you leave your car running and unlocked in the first place. Duhhh
Just another jogger out for a nice run.
Who the Fook is that guy? Ufc never herd of hmm in me lyfe
Always lock your car when you leave it.  Always
I just don't understand why people leave they car running and walk away. I am glad his okay and got the car back from the thief.
Ameria trains it's people very well!  God Bless America  The best country in the world!
Now that's a bad day for any theif who runs into a ufc fighter
Wonder how much he got pay??? (the thief) for this BS
He did leave the car unlocked and running.  I saw the person deserved to take it.
JUSTICE IS SERVED!
Thief took two, maybe three knees to the face
Yea rihht . You would've treated him like some king crab legs
Get em
Dude, he kneed him twice in the head and punched him once I think. Not "a few good punches"
The guy ran away like 🙉🙈🙊
Typical ✊🏿 Ole Bookie Ray Ray doin what they do!!
Imagine your just embarking on a life of crime and on your first carjacking attempt u bump into and get beat up by a ufc fighter 😂😂🤣🤣 id take that as a sign from God to reconsider.
Everyone is making fun of the fanny pack.  It's sadder than a joke folks. When you spend a life receiving repeated blows to your dome that are unnatural. Those hard hits you all love. Those brains are being damaged like shit,  I have a few. He carries his fanny pack to help him remember the things he needs day to day.   I used to think the ways I had to readjust to life were embarrassing. Like apologizing for having service dogs or feeling to panicked to go places because of how people would think are God forbid talk to me. Having medical staff read me my forms to make sure I really understood what I was reading. That shit took a lot of time to get over the inevitable embarrassment. Shit was terrible but then you say F it I gotta live life. The fanny pack is funny, on a regular big guy. Been using the same book bag here since my accidents and it's been around the globe with me and the dog who sports a vest with pockets lol. F it! Oh and he was crying crying when he ran away. Lil bish
Looks like the owner of the car left it running, or the keys.
First time he's ever been disciplined by a man in his life.
HORSE STEELERS SHOULD BE HUNG OR SHOT ON THE JOHNNY SPOT
I remember a time when one could leave a car unlocked and the engine running with no problem, but that's been about a half century ago.
Who leaves their car running anywhere? Thats asking for it to be stolen!
Wtf he shoulda knocked him out
They were not punches it were a couple of knees to the face
Don't worry the  Liberal ass district attorneys with their heads up their ass would let him go anyway
Lol
Funny.  This guy rips a criminal piece of garbage out of a car, pounds him with knees and punches, and he's lauded (which, I agree that he should). Officer rips a criminal piece of garbage out of a car, pounds him with knees and punches, and he is villified. Let's stop the b.s. Everybody take care of their own business, stop whining and stfu and guess what???? The world will be a better place to live.
He better come back and buy some ice pack at gas station ⛽️.
Only a guy with severe brain injury would leave a car running. Oh wait... nevermind...
Interesting that he isn't driving around in a really fancy car. At least he is modest.
FOOL ran away holding his head in pain... I LOVE IT..........
He shoulda really balled him up LOL
The car was in reverse and i know the criminal did not put it in park b4 hopping out like why did it stop moving
The crook ran away holding his head lmao.
Very satisfying to watch.  But who TF leaves there car unlocked AND running while they go in a store, even for 30 seconds?!
Well why did you leave your car running.  You deserve to have your car stolen
Unlocked car with the engine running 😒
I know that shit hurt
I mean, it was a Civic for pete's sake. Can't a guy drive a sensible car without worrying about it anymore? It ain't got V-tec, yo.
People should just walk up and lock the doors to people that do this, keys locked in and car running lol
To bad he didn't win by a knockout !
Am I kissing something…? I don’t see any fists being thrown. I see someone being pulled out and away from the car… but no blows in or out of the car.
No one sees the gas prices lmao
😱😱 How dare you to take your car from him !!!….. you’re racist !!. 😱😱😱 LMFAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Strupps  no guillotine choke  !?  not impressed !!!
Sorry, but what kind of fool goes into a store leaving the car running
How dare he stop him from stealing, hes oppressed victim of our societey
Every time I watch UFC, it's nothing but grappling. I was expecting a fancy chokehold or armbar.
never leave your car running, not very smart.
303 rep
In this day and age, if you leave your car running outside a gas station, that’s called a gift. Smh
So glad the UFC fighter did not get shot. This is the way my Pop said real men used to handle things....🤜💪🤕
Esay to find him with them Fred Flintstone cartoon knots on his head.
You know that hurt because he’s holding his head 😂
And that’s not even a good mma fighter, imagine if that was like Ngannou or Jones loll
Did you ever stop to think why a car like that would have the keys in it? Maybe because nobody in that neighborhood is stupid enough to try and rip this car off!  ~ Gone in Sixty Seconds
he was just jogging and got in the car to rest and this violent white supremacist racially profiled him and assaulted him
Why he didn't lock his car and left it running in the first place is beyond me. That's probably the slowest car jacking of an unlocked running vehicle anyone has ever seen, almost like it really wasn't what it seems, we've seen alot of that lately
Why is usa so famous for stealing n hacking
Would've loved to see a Tank Abbott in his prime yanking the guy from the car & land a few shots after.
He baited him lazily leaving the engine on
_"Grab 'im and hold 'im, GRAB 'IM AN HOLD 'IM...!"_
So he's a UFC fighter but didn't lock his car doors and left it running?  UFC fighter or not why don't people practice common sense and turn off the car and lock their damn doors?🤦‍♂️
This looks like jussier smolette type of fake news
CNN he was late for the class, and was going to return the car after.
Only morons leave their vehicles unlocked.
Sheeesh
Jason looks & sounds highhhhghhg
William...👍 awesome.  I don't think he's going to try to  steal another car. You just put the fear of William in him. Great 👍 👌 job
Why leave your vehicle running with the keys in it unlocked? Obviously his profession is getting hit in the head a lot because that halfway makes sense.
Love this video.
Unlocked & running? What did he think was going to happen? Hope his insurance company wasn't watching!
What's up with that fanny pack 😄😄
Why bother arresting him? Your local DA is likely to just release him after a few hours.
Hahahahaha good stuff!
$3.64 for gas?
But seriously, lock the car.
👍
So technically the fighter stole bread out of the guys hands.
That lesson I learned from dad lock car when you walk away lesson 101
A good a** whooping would've been nice
These days anyone who's ever been in a gym and can throw a punch is a 'UFC' fighter,...
He's lucky he didn't catch some hollow points instead.
That was a boneheaded move. Who was dumber, the MMA dude for leaving his keys in the ignition and the car running while he went into the store or the thief? What if the thief had a firearm? The combined IQ for both are in the double digit range.
Wow! A happy story.
Reporter said sheeeesh!!!! 😂
He felt that knee that why he ran way
Cop: Can you identify the thief? Fighter: Yes, he has two black eyes, a bloody nose and a broken jaw.
Why would anyone leave their car doors unlocked with the keys in the ignition.  That's like inviting a thief to steal it.  Not smart.
Luckily the car halted from continuing to move while the perp was removed
Criminals are getting dumber by the day.
Shoulda painted the parking lot with his face...
Some lessons have to be either painful or expensive.
His ears are normal... he's a I think I'm a UFC fighter..
Stupid cars now a days don't let you leave it running and lock it with the key fob so when your animals are in the car you have to leave it running and can't even lock your shit. Lucky I have protective dobermans
Ah yea don't leave you keys in the ignition, Hell he my have left the damn car running. You don't need to a UFC fighter to stop your car from being stolen, you just have to be smarter than a 5 year old.
The craziest thing about America today is the guy probably woulda sued Jordan if he beat him up any more than this. Lol
Why did you let him get away you should just eliminate him then and there.
The second thing he regretted is getting caught on camera with that Fanny bag lol
Did i really hear a "Sheesh" at the end there?  x)
😆
I just can't believe how many people leave their cars unlocked and running, Mr UFC is not too bright.
also, dont be a dumbass and leave your car running.
Yes leave the car running then blame the thief, basically saying hey take it for free lol. Anyway glad everything went well and you get your car back.
Jordan you have the platform let’s see what you do with it now.

Anyone else wondering why the car keys would be inside an unlocked car? Looks staged. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Who the hell leaves their parked car unlocked and running?  Especially at a gas station when it's a notoriously known hang out for transients, crooks, beggars, panhandlers, homeless, thieves, and so on?  If he did lost his car to the thief he deserves it!  He just got lucky the thief did not lock the door when backing out
The UFC fighter was lucky that the thief wasn't armed.
For all you white guys who want to bring race into this, the UFC fighter is Jordan Williams and he's black.
Only regret: the Fanny pack.
HAhahahahahahah
He was dumb to leave his car running and not locked.
More fake news,no punches were thrown,can't believe people believe this shit.😃
"We're literally hunting for face punches from UFC fighters everyday"   ----LeBrokenChin Jones.
And what if either had a gun?
If the thief had a gun  ,we'd been watching the killing of an UFC fighter...this is stupid AF and risky
To ANYONE who’s ever had there vehicle stolen..... I kinda WISH he would’ve GROUND AND POUNDED him until the police showed up..... Because as of right now that guy didn’t learn ANYTHING!!!!! In fact he WALKED AWAY not even having a CLUE about who’s vehicle that was AND how lucky he was!!!!!
"Sheesh"
Make it legal to defend one's property with force (lethal if needed) and watch crime rates drop.
"He gon' cry in the car"  ---Smokey from Friday.
Thank you for all your time and care you put into making your videos.  I believe most all of us in this world are wanting peace, common sense, and no fear. We have no real peace here in this world, but we can have peace, it comes from Jesus and accepting his free gift of salvation.  In Mark 16:15 he commands us too "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature".  John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Please call upon Jesus today.
He had a front butt purse
WITH A FANNY PACK ON!
Derrick Lewis is Smiling on this One
Now that the cops aren't allowed to do their jobs this is gonna happen more often. Kudos Jordan
Gas prices are outrageous !!
Would have been nice to at least body slam the thief which would have made him available for arrest.
Those were punches, all I saw was knees to the head and him holding his head up from the concussions
The suspect will be elected Mayor in the next Election.
Who leaves their car running? I think UFC fighter was waiting for this to happen.
yeesh. that guy's lucky he didn't get it worse. i've trained with professional fighters, and they are made of different stuff lol.
I love a happy ending!
The way he snatched that kid out of the car is how some people pick up their pets.
Smh
Some states UFC guy will be sued !
Looks like a couple knees to the face. Ouch!!  😀
I didn't know you could punch with your knee 😒😐🙄 news always lies!!!!!!
Why did he leave the keys in the car
Smart in the RING ... But DUMB leaving his vehicle running & unlocked
Why do people still leave the keys in the car these days?
🙋👍🙌🙌🙌
"I got my butt kicked by a guy wearing a fanny pack!?" -thief
my car just got stolen yesterday afternoon after a just finished doing my oil change. wish i caught that person and gave him a bit of taste of what its looking for
fighter needs to work on his ground game taking that guy down to the mat
He left running and rubbing his tater...lol😝
.....that was........beautiful................
🧐 yeaaa rite look staged to me
I think both. these dudes are idiots smh DAmn Dude looked like he started crying as he was running awayUFC fighter: advice lock your car and never leave it running wow wise advice I never would have thoughtAlways lock your door when parking a car Car Thief: Always lock your door when stealing a car....
ANYONE THAT LEAVES THEIR CAR RUNNING WHILE THEY ARENT IN IT DESERVES TO HAVE TO TAKEN. MORONS
Straight up got his ass whooped by a dude wearing a fanny pack.
He left the car running. I didn't know people do that anymore.
The UFC fighter was wrong to leave his keys in the ignition.  The thief was wrong for stealing.  I guess two wrongs do make a right.
The reporter said  "Sheeeessshhh" 😂😂😂😂
Well, I learned that UFC fighters…are jacked up from all the punches they’ve taken. Not once have I ever left my car running and would ever consider keeping it unlocked outside of my drive way. I don’t need to be given that kind of advice cause it makes sense to me clearly NOT to a fighter !
Portland City Council member?
Not even close to getting “ pounded” as stated in the title. The car owner did not even use any martial arts at all.  Big deal
Unfortunately majority of the time the thief would of just shot him and ran always carry no matter what 🙏🏽
Holding his head in pain and crying as he runs away. This made me smile thank you.
He obviously didn't find his reparations today.
took a page right out of GTA5
Joggers gonna jog. Obama be proud
Looks easy on GTA doesn’t it.
He regrets wearing that Fanny pack?
Looks about right
Maybe having the police is a good idea.  maybe actually putting criminals behind bars for a long time is good for law abiding citizens.  Maybe we need to stop making heros of criminals and start to punish them because they hurt all of us.
But that guy was a POC.  I thought that they NEVER break the law.
ohh. i was hoping for a good video...this was as exciting and like swatting a fly
I have never left my car running when I got out of it, not even to get the mail 2 feet away.
are you sure that guy is UFC fighter and now WWE one ??
Love how these idiots leave their car running.  Especially the ones with kids in them
UFC first mistake was leaving the car running and unlocked, that's the lesson he should have learn because next time someone with a gun will pop him.
Take your keys out the car fool and lock your doors
Messed with wrong one
Which fighter was this? Camera quality is horrible.
Left his car running? Sorry but he almost deserved to get his car stolen lmao.
UFC fighter: High fight IQ. Low common sense IQ.
In his defense, the fighter was wearing a fanny pack. That's some hero level baiting right there.
If the perp gets a good lawyer, he will hit the jackpot. The man uses deadly force (knee to the head)  to protect property, had no direct threat of dying or great bodily injury. This 'fighter' is in big trouble. Yes, our justice system is broken. I agree. Get over it.
“Sheesh”
A lesson for the UFC to learn, never leave your car running unattended.
Ok why WHY would any full fledged adult leave their car running unlocked unattended? I wouldn’t leave mine unlocked running in any neighborhood ever. What goes on in someone’s head when they do this?
Lock your door! No excuses!!
This looks fake…
Yeah that happens when u leave ur car running skillet
Plot twist: that was really his car and the ufc fighter carjacked him. .and even gave an interview afterwards 😎
Forget that!! damage can keep him down a while!!
I would have beaten that pos for taking something that isn't his.
Dang 3.36 a gallon in auburn? It’s at least a dollar more in California
💯 his fault cus like what dumbass leaves their car on and unlucked 🤦🏻‍♂️
Unlocked AND running?? Not in this world is that smart...
Sad part is he would have most likely  been out the same are next day regardless  this is why people do this and more teens do it cuz they see grown people get caught and then see them next day on the street no strict laws anymore creates more criminals
Could always turn the car off, and take the key fob with you.  Unless that particular model doesn't have an "off" mode.
$3.64/gallon for gasoline!!!😳
Can't do that in urban streets
We need to start shooting these criminals and force them to FEAR THE PUBLIC. If they think they will get shot for this stuff - maybe they would think twice.
Mf joggers are coming crime everyday.
DiVeRsITy is the best policy isn't it ?   All those pushing for its need their cars stolen.
They are so privlidged they feel they can just walk up and take people's property these days.
With all the sh** that's going on why would  u leave your car unattended. This could have been life ending for him.
Funny I got a UFC ad for an app right before this video
Should have whoop his arse so he may learn not to do that again
Fake/Staged video.
good at fighting. thinking... not so much.
Love it!!!
the thief will go home to the welfare queen mother crying about a racist guy attacking him
If this had been in a democrat city they mma fighter would be in prison now
I guess you could call that a lesson.            Pathetic
Where was the UFC fighter at?
Poor black man was just trying to get to his momma, every one just hunting down poor black man
Finally!
If the car thief had locked his car door like the news anchor suggested he could have made a clean get away.
hell yeah we need more people doing the same
Should have put a rear headlock on him and held him for police.  😂
Which one will change their behavior after learning the hard way?
the MMA guy should be charge with entrapment 👀😜
UFC fighter...hes not even in the UFC, its an MMA trainee
He really didn’t think that Honda Civic was owned by a professional athlete
Never mess with someone who has cauliflower ears AND a fanny pack.
Dana, give him the FOTN bonus
Williams should be charged with assault and violation of that poor man's civil rights.
UFC Fighter: Call the ambulance, but not for me......
How about that Fannypack
STUPID leave your car running, maybe lock your house doors. UFC fighters are not bullet proof.
Oh I know what his mama is going to say, “He’s such a good boy he’s a medical student and he was trying to return his library books or he suffers from mental disorder and he was off his meds.” Anyhow BLM will get him off ✊🏿Aight
Prob a set-up
The fighter was clearly looking for trouble with that bright yellow fanny pack
All three of my cars are manuals and two are slow beaters, lol! Unbelievable how many times I see a car running at the gas station
He's a UFC fighter because he's not even smart enough to not leave a car running and go in a store.
Reminds me off those two burglers who broke into a gay bodybuilder's house. They got cuffed and raped for days.
That man looks like handsome squidward
This is the most racist video I ever seen. Je beat that guy just because of the color of his skin
Lesson: Don't steal or rob property, otherwise you get knees to the face!
Very lucky to be alive.
The fighter did not lock his door and the thief did not know how to lock the door so it balanced out
Is that lebron? Or just “one of the hunted every day?”
Ole boy held his head crying, *"I'm going home to tell my mom!"*
$3.64 for gas???
'Not to do more damage' HAHAHA yeah right
*Is diversity ruining America?*  I hear people say diversity is great, but I never hear anyone say what is so great about it.
The ONLY reason I gave a thumps down is because my man didn't knock the carjacker 'Da Smooth Out!' Whether you are in the ring or at a gas station, I want to see you knock 'em out!! 😜
Never mess with a guy who wears a fanny pack in 2021.
The guy honestly looked like he was crying!  😆🤣😂
No one has the right to go into a car thats NOT theirs, no matter what, they should be shot.
CBS: defund police! Also CBS: OMG! Look what happened!
SO GLAD I live in an all white neighborhood.
It is illegal in some places to leave your car running and unattended. Like these states ...  Arizona California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Georgia Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Missouri Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New York Ohio Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Wisconsin Wyoming
Yeah, yeah, yeah… UFC fighter. But, ummm… was that a Fanny pack???
WTF don’t leave your car running unless you got the AC on for ya Honey!  Of course he’d been knock on the head a few times before too 🤨 😂
Good for you Jordan!
He's lucky he didn't get ran over!
tough dude but not too smart
Wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction(hell), but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life(heaven), only a few find it.Matthew7:13 Believe in God's son Jesus today, repent of your sin, dont be left behind.
Black dude thought he was slick until his head was being reminded of just how out matched he truly is in life.....nice touch up job!!
I constantly see people leaving their car running while in a store for 5-20 minutes. I secretly wish someone would come and steal their car each time I see it. It's idiotic for people to do that.
YEAH RIGHT! You know you wanted to whip his ass more. Well you should have.
I know the areas where dinogas operate. I dont want to blame the victim, but if theres a dinogas with a 10 mikes radius, you're asking to get you car stolen if you dont lock it. I hope this was a lesson learned for him.
I wish the guy had gotten away, I hate idiots who just leave their car outside running like that.
Good he caught this guy: but as he said he should have held him for police.
So you just left your car running like that?
He was running away in pain
Criminals getting bold these days smdh
As he's running away  *MOMMA!!*
Must admit that I have left my truck unlocked and running many times... Never had a probem.. My Dutch Shepherd seems to enjoy it..
Those punches sure look like he's using his knee... It's gotta be a type of punch because the news is always right... 😆
usual suspect.....
Thank you CBS!  No begging people to subscribe at the end of every video like NBC does.
First of all, no one should have to remind anyone to not leave their cars unlocked and running, anywhere! What a stupid statement.
But… reparations man!!
I'm surprised he wasn't charged for them hands
It's 2021. Why on Earth would anyone leave their car running while going into a store?
i must be blind, i dont see any punches
At least the thief put the car in park for him..
Man, I gotta rewind this for the 19th time.
What’s more amazing is gas at $3.64!!!
In our modern woke era, police would be required to release the criminal.  Oh wait, that isn't California, never mind.
Watch AK NATION NEWS this wouldn't have been so funny if it was some teenager with a Glock stealing your car!  because that's what's going on in our neighborhood..
Hell yeah!
Punches? Dude was throwing knees!
Maybe your biggest regret should’ve been to not leave your keys in your car
Next time don't leave your car running dummy!
the ufc fighter giving advice lock your car and never leave it running wow wise advice I never would have thought
Could have just locked the door, but he’s not only a thief, he’s an idiot.
Drivers are absolutely stupid. Leaving guns inside unlocked cars, riding around with doors unlocked, etc...the problem isn't the thief, but the dumb driver.
Good thing the thief didn't have a gun. Bullets don't care how much you trained.
He tried to rob the wrong guy!
Looks like BLM is going to be rioting tonight about this.
Rule #1 for all car thieves, NEVER MESS WITH UFC FIGHTERS
The guy was just trying to offer valet service.
🤣
The dude ran away like an injured cartoon character 🤣 🤣😂
Here before this goes viral
The real crime here is those damn gas prices. Christ.
dude left his car unlocked and running? wtf
This is what everyone sits at their computer imagining their life is like, me included.
UFC fighter: Always lock your door when parking a car  Car Thief: Always lock your door when stealing a car....
I grew up in a very small town and even we knew when you go into the gas station you shut off and lock the car .
3.64 a gallon???   It's 2.70 where I live
Salute! He met his match!
Reinforcing racial stereotypes one crime at a time  smh.
We be hunted everyday - LeChina Queen James
I have left my car running on some super cold morning (I worked the night shift for several years at a diner) my car was right outside the door BUT I would ALWAYS use the keyless entry to lock it with the keys in the ignition to melt the ice on the windows and windshield.
LOL This is Great watching the "tough punk" run away like a baby. Thank you Jordan William I hope this goes National!!!
so who is actually the idiot here? not locking and leaving your car running? LMFAO
😂 😂 😂, Ouch, it hurts.
dont worry jordan, he would have gotten out in a few hours
He threw a few good knees to the dome….
He was just trying to get bread this is a hate crime
The current government is illegal and criminal, CCP  Virus kill your family & take your money what can you do
Dude looked like he started crying as he was running away
Lol
