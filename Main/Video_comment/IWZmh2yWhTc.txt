Boris is the best! I wish he'd take a trip to the States. Everyone would love him over here! His mind would be blown when he saw what he calls doctor sausage on a grill between bread which we call a hot dog and all the things that we Americans put on it! Lmao 🌭
0:41 Slovenia cameo
Boiling water in pot is NOT true slav...
pov: <some idiot from uk> noooooooooooooooooooo
Ah: Boris!
The mug "definitely not vodka" but why did you put vodka (btw is that vodka or not 😶😶😶)
Boris: Im Estonian  Also Boris : 0:43
Omg I am so happy
Slovene?
You must have pawned your samovar?!
This video is so precisely timed with uamee's kharkovchanka, so that looping the video creates a perfect cycle of the song! Awesome!
Who put milk in tea ..?
didn't now I drink my tea Russian, I love to put some lemon in my black tea and a TON OF SUGAR (I always forget to buy honey so it's sugar)
Boris, my guy, how your day with anatoli?
Wrong you never take the spoon out of the mug
Boris please make tutorial how to make Indomie or rendang maybe some of bandrek (some Indonesia cooking recipe)
I drink tea the normal British way, not because I’m a western spy, because my parents would kill me if I didn’t.
How I drink tea when I’m slavy
The og's will remember the old title of this video: "good morning"
i make tea with 6 bay leaf, is that slav?
I feel the way of making tea is completely normal. However to see a Slovenian flag on the desktop - that blew me away. Even though we're far away, our lifestyles are pretty much the same.
Так ладно, что я тут забыла, что я тут впринципе делаю
Nooo haha!!!!
cinnamon ,aka sinnerman, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cayyenne
He fucking used a fork-
Milk in tea no this isn’t boris this is western spy no eastern man or woman or child or animal has milk in tea
Ay Boris, only Western spies put milk in their tea.
The bay leaf! And blin it is good! Beautiful, bluatiful.
Oi blyat we never know the instrumental will be used on the kharkovchanka song Blin!
Ah yes, Kharkovchanka beating in the back
Ah yes the babushka special.

I tried this myself  My mom yelled at me for using all the honey 😊
In rest of world you put honey in tea But on life of Boris you put tea in the honey
Good tea бляать!!
One tea bag? You're not a true slav unless you make Chifir / Чифи́рь.
You'd think such a cool guy would show off his girl but he dosen't because he's better than that
A normal russian morning
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUUUU
I can confirm that you did everything right in this video.

Hello blin, how are you my soulmate? Have you been good in this time. Long long time, you remember, we where squating like pateto around the hood. Oh blyat it was so good time. What I have missed so much is my vodka pure in your frigde. Maybe it got bad, so we get new vodka to cruse around with some HARDBASS and the classic blyatmobil. Like cyka I love drivin around with lada blyat. So I love your content. It's so good entertaining  and good medicine to reduce stress. Hahahaha I'm so away from my methylphenidati wich I snort in my brain like the vodka in our stomage. I wish I could chill around with you... Only problem or better said only thing is standing on my way is, if you read this. I mean blin I'm writing so much, only to get ignored. It is not a big deal, but i would be so happy, if you read this. In other words I like you and I would be happy about a message back. I don't know how much it cost to read all comments, see it like this, I write to you as a unknown friend to make you happy. I wish to you everthing good and stay Tuned yeee hahahahah

So noone's gonna mention how he set Slovenia flag as wallpaper? - Slovenian confirmed?
I'm sending my men to Slovenia.      They will find you.
That's a Slovenian flag in this desktop
Clicked for boris, commented, liked and watched the whole thing for the hardbass

In soviet Union vodka drinks you
you from Slovenija?
was the Slovenia flag a hint?
I would ask but I already know the answer, boris did you actually drink that honey tea mix? No need for answer I already know.
I honestly thought that he poured his tea into mayonnaise at first 😂😂
When Boris tasted the mysterious juice he made, he probably tasted tea, mayonnaise, and fabric from his mask in his mouth
Boris u drink tea with milk?  SO DO I :D
YOUTUBE!!!! need more earlier this GOOD MORNING!!!!  NOW IS 10PM!!!
Is boris going to Slovenia next?, the flag on his monitor makes me think that he's going to Slovenia

You know? If you put this on a loop, the transition go really smooth you wont even realize if it is on a loop. Its really incredible that even the portion of the track can become its own song.

*In Boris's voice "So anyways guys, here's the recipe: Water, Bay-no...Tea leaves, some fresh milk from babushka's farm, maybe some sugar on top, then add two shots of vodka, and finally, today's sponsor: Honey!"

У тебя мед засахарился. Выложи мед в маленькую кастрюлю, положи её в в большую кастрюлю и наполни большую кастрюлю водой. Кипяти пока мед не растает и будет тебе текучий мед. Ну или нет, хз как больше нравится
this video is very satisfying
доброе утро
This is how you get diabetes, my comrades.
Is no one gonna talk about the slovenian flag on his monitor?
Shouldn't a real slav put the tea bag in a spoon after use, twist the string around the spoon, then back over the bag, then use it to press the bag and completely drain the tea out of it?
Wait...Slovenia?!
wtf hahaha slovenian flag, someone actually knows our country :D

Boris, blyat you have my home country flag comrade
Dear Boris, today i tried to listen "Cheeki Breeki" song louder than i should, i installed Speaker Booster off Google Play and turned it on, and i didnt want to test it on me, so i gave my best friend my headphones on max volume, and when i turned on Speaker Booster he started screaming and i said " YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THAT ROOM UNTIL YOU BECOME A REAL AND TRUE SLAV!!!" and he continues screaming. After an hour there was no more screaming. I thought he might be dead, but the i said "Thats Cheeki Breeki song, what can it possibly do to him, haha".After 2 more hours i came back to check him. He left the room wearing ski mask, full Adidas outfit, 1 bottle of Vodka, and an AK-47. And i asked him "Bro how did you get that??!!" And he said "There was an AR15 toy gun in your room, and when i looked at it and turned the phone to it, it just became an AK-47" and then he said "Now i know what true Slavness means, it was exciting with you my friend, but now i need to get back to my only mother, Mother Russia" . Then he just left. He said we can text by phone, and i was like "Okay" . As we speak, im getting headphones ready, because i want to go with him, goodbye dear Boris, we will see you in Mother Russia. Your dear Ivan.

good morning boris
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.

Opaa ... is our slavic brother visiting Slovenia ... you are welcome ... we have many things to see and eat ... and like other slavic countries "cultural" drinking is a lifestyle 🥂🍻🍝😁

Very very slav......
The Spotsylvania County of Virginia passed a resolution on March 23, 2021, condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s persecution of Falun Gong as well as the brutal crime of harvesting organs from living practitioners.  Since last year, seven other counties in the state have passed similar resolutions to condemn the CCP’s human rights abuses, including Fairfax County, Shenandoah County, Frederick County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, Fauquier County and Warren County.   Board of Supervisors’ Meeting in Spotsylvania County on March 23, 2021  Ms. Wang Chunyan, a Falun Gong practitioner and survivor of torture in China, testified at the Board of Supervisors’ meeting. Ms. Wang said, “I am very honored to stand here today. It also makes me emotional. I was almost killed and could have been made a victim of the organ harvesting crime in China for practicing Falun Gong.”  Ms. Wang was an entrepreneur in Dalian City, Liaoning Province. She was once imprisoned for seven years for upholding her faith and suffered all kinds of brutal torture. When she was forced to live away from home to hide from the police, the police beat her husband to death. Her two sisters were also arrested for talking to people about Falun Gong.  Kevin Marshall, Chairman of Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors, said, “We don’t want anything like this to go unnoticed.” He said he hopes every resident in the county will be aware of the crime and no one will participate in it.   Kevin Marshall, Chairman of the Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors  Gary F. Skinner, another member of the Broad of Supervisors, commented, “Let’s stand up and be strong and say ‘stop it.’”
HE'S BACK.

now that is what i call a morning routine
Hi
So, you're Slovenian?
TIL that regular teas, such as black teas, is widely accepted to put milk in them...  Every morning I brew fresh tea, and sometimes coffee, and I always put sugar in my tea, but milk? Coffee is one thing, go ahead! But Tea? Really?  Do keep in mind that I understand that there are milk teas out there such as bubble tea which is fantastic! This is entirely separate from just... this monstrosity... Milk in tea? *mental breakdown*  At least he didn't start a starbucks fiasco and start adding caramel- 0:29 *DEAR GOD*

How Boris gets ready for a day of hunting down the most blin STALKER mods.

Slovenia...............
Strong tea with rock sugar for the afternoon, and strong tea with condensed milk for the night.   Or just chug some tatratea, if you have not enough patience of brewing.
When you see that Boris has your country's flag as background and you realize you've been staring at your paused video for 10 mins... then you can go to sleep proud and die a happy Slav.
milk tea with blyat ton of honey. Blyatiful.

I sat there, staring at the full cup of tea and the honey, and almost shouted "Boris NO!" Expecting him to try and put the honey into the cup. Then nearly died of laughter when he proceeded to pour the tea into the container of honey. It is 7:49 AM and I just sat down for breakfast. Good morning indeed!

0:32 Good morning boris, want a cup of- whaaaa

Boris wakes up* drinks tea with his BUCKET of HONEY and proceeds to drink the thing. I have seen enough slav power in 46 seconds then going to Moscow on Christmas when all the Gopniks are all playing and listening to their lovely Russian Christmas songs. I am satisfied

I am very sorry. I cannot join channel as my country does not have channel membership. But I subsrcibe.

Oh gud morning comrades
Obviously a diversion tactic to make us think he's from Slovenia or filming at that country. Boris we know you are in New Slavia, reveal the portal already! We mist migrate to the promised land already.
Good ebening
Good morning to you too Boris.
When you realise that this was uploaded in the morning for some people while sitting in your chair at 3 o-clock (let you judge which one)
It's evening cyka

Ayy this is a prequel of him going to slovenia.

Good morning to you too blyat
0:41 next country review secret message?
When Metro Exodus
Boris wishes me Good morning? Blin, this going to be a very good day!!
Good morning, that you have a  lovely day.
This is the best thing to wake up to
This is a brilliant idea, but needs some refining: 1. No milk in tea, that's disgusting 2. Keep honey in porcelain/glass/ceramic container, preferably with handle 3. Make the tea in the honey vessel 3.a. Stir according to how sweet you like your tea 4. Drink tea, save rest of honey for next tea time  I often use the same mug without washing it in between, having a mug with built in sweetener would be very practical. Honey is antimicrobial, so this should work quite well (as long as you don't stir it too much).  Unfortunately I drink coffee with milk .
Boris do you live in vladivostok based on time of video release?
Good morning? It was 2:45 in Greece when you posted this, and I think we have almost the same time with western Russia and East Europe. Unless you live in Siberia
Good tea bruv
Reveal face now blin
It's noon you plank !
Morning call
Good morning Boris
SAME THING I DID
It's morning in the US, so I assume Boris is saying good morning to all of the Western Spies.
A MODERN BUSTER KEATON
I love watching videos of boris
Good morning to you, comrade.
Y’all talking about this for you waking up, it’s late at night for me
cup of tea wont fit honey no problem just put cup of tea in the honey jar instead
dude you can't put hot water in plastic, it melts
Me who spent the whole night away binging Life of Boris Videos: wait it's already morning?!
Good morning comrades
Pozdrav iz Slovenije, Boris!

Some hardbass in the morning

Ah yes, i too drink my honey in this manner.
Good morning Boris How are you today Cheeki Breeki ?
It’s already evening here in the Philippines, but it feels like morning tho
I was going to accuse you of drinking western spy drink but then you added vodka so it's fine
and a, how do you say it, oh right, доброе утро to you as well.
Here's a tip: Squeeze the tea bag to get more of that glorious leaf juice out.
even just this tiny video has so much effort put into it wow
Mornin' Boris. Nuffin' like a nice cuppa firs' thing, eh?
I'll accept the tea in the honey but the milk is heresy.
Thanks
Do you Boris come from slovenia? I see the flag        Balkan bros 🇧🇦🇸🇮
What a blatyful day guys!
Dear Boris, I love the videos like this and the neighbor Vadim video where its almost no talking or no talking. No is not because I dislike your voice or anything but I think you have great timing and body language for comedy. Either way, thanks for video. Stay cheeki breeki. Western Spy Chris
Neatza!

Good Morging, superstar of slavs! A briefing will be ready for you at second obligatory Vodka intake but be advised that 16 western spies were apprehended for selling Moonshine as Vodka. They await your judgment.   I don't know why i just wrote that.. anyway: good moring Boris, hope you are well!

How did I ended up watching this channel this much? WTF Boris!
Why is there a flag of slovenia on boris’ monitor? As a slovakian I’m kinda sad.
You mix milk with tea? **DEBIL**
Its night in my country you know
