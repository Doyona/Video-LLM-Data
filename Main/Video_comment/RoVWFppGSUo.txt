Rest in peace . Connor 😢❤
Class of this game is rarely matched
I wanna see abs v. The maoris. Will hold more subatance than world cup rugby
How are they not the national team?
When Sullivan did the Pukana it brought a tear to my eye. Love you my Maori people.
Nice win Maori All Blacks
Maori showed All Blacks how its done
Thanx
Think george is hard for anyone runsvn tackles like that.
Common NZ history is false and misdirected. Maori were not the first people in NZ.   Also the famous "Waka" that brought them here, is made of native timber🤣😅😂😂
Welcome home Mr Aki haere mai ra
number 10!.... off!!....could have saved 2 tries with a flick of experience
What is different maori all black & all black squad ?
well done Maori ABs well done Mighty ABs  just watched both games. damn we on bro!
Strong performance all round. The MAB pack stood up in the tight, to support the speedsters. That's always a massive component when playing an Irish team. The ABs really need a next generation of tight five players or it's going to be a lean decade. Big test on Saturday, against a much stronger Irish team. Really disappointed Will Jordan won't be there finding space. Respect again to Bundee who has been one of Aotearoa's finest rugby exports.
Thanks for posting.
Awesome game, Ireland looked a bit jet lagged, all better for them though, this is a good wake up call
Tehei Maori ora
All the efforts we put in Makes us More Stronger
Aotearoa Maoris too tuff for ireland 😝🇳🇿
From a New Zealander far from home at the moment, cheers All Blacks and sky for a decent highlights package.
The most racist team in sport
The Maori all blacks are wrongly race based. If we had a pakeha or white all black team the Maori's would cry and insist it's not fair.  Nb. Maori TV. Is similar.  We need pakeha TV.  Jim
are we ever going to a game involving new zealand - even 11 minutes of highlights -= that doesn't have to include that fucking ludicrous dance ?
That was a great performance Maori AB's!. First half they were brutal and clinical. Such beautiful micro skill moments, slick handling at the line. Much to like from the loosies they combined well. Grace just carried on his Crusader form, Billy Harmon wouldn't look out of place in the AB's. Cameron Suafoa never heard much of him but he was a beast when carrying. Walker-Leawere very underrated but he's a solid player great ball carrier, Ollie Norris is destined for AB's he's a young gun. The backs got the rewards from the forwards hard work and they played sharp, all in all great win Maori All Blacks.
No question as to who were the better team
Great to see the MABs in full flow and even better to see Ireland humiliated. Back to the drawing board Farrell? Heheheheh
DAY 29
At 3:12 How was B Aki's attempt a try if the ball was placed on ground as he slipped?
There's more Maoris playing for Ireland than there is for the All Blacks.
Mean Brothers way to show your Mana an Skill an Dedication to the sport.
Not clinical but innovative Rugby ! Love it
Our lovely Maori All Blacks, congratulations! ;-)
I was dissappointed waking up at 8 for this match just to have our team make too many sloppy mistakes, there was some good moments but nowhere near enough to beat a team like that, excited to see what our first team can do on saturday however, should make for a great match either way
Nice video and all but , I’m in your comment section again . lol .
Nice video and all but , I’m in your comment section again . lol .
Brilliant
Missed out the 2nd half
Great game MAB's  Great score.
Where's the crowd? There's nothing to do in the Tron. Why dont they go to the footy?
Great performance fro the MAB well done from SA.
What the F is Keith Earls doing on this tour?
Pretty empty stadium!
The MABs speed and work around the breakdown need to be commended here. This is a coaching masterclass and a clinic in execution. Just watch how quickly they get to every breakdown in how effective they are cleaning out. I’m gobsmacked at the quality. A well deserved win!
no more maori all blacks they are "te ao maori"
Does NZ have two national teams Maori All Blacks and All Blacks?
Aki should have been sin binned early for all the pens he gave away
beautiful game! awesome skills Maori All Blacks 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Se malo Bundee Aki, ae lega  e fealolo lava lou kami i luga o le malae. Magaia le skoa. Ia ma le kama fo'i o Josh Ioane,ia o le 'au Samoa uma o lea kaaalo i 'au ia o le 'Au Maoli ma le 'au o Aialagi. Malo le 'au kama Samoa o lo'o ka'alo mo 'au 'ese.
Union, pro force back 😂😂😂😂💯kick it brah , kick it , yea nice 😂😂
Bad day at the office. Lot's of changes for Saturday. Éire will be a real test for ABs
Connor GB is a real hustler, really busy off the ball, super promising player..
I feel like the Maori team are just Ireland 2.0
Why oh why put your c team out against the all black reserves. 🙈
This has to be one of the worst Irish performance I have seen for a long time. They used to play like this in the 90s / 2000s and take 40 points by pretty much everyone at the top. Okay, it is a B or C side but you would expect at least a few of these presumably hopeful players to perform. It is like watching that "experimental" (with twice the amount of caps) England side getting pulled apart by an experimental Baabas side. The French uncapped are ten times better than their English counterparts. It is worrying to see that Ireland does not seem to have much depth behind players that are in their 30s. Hopefully with see more from their A team against the ABs.
Great rugby skills and fitness levels. surprised to see empty seats at an international rugby match.
Both teams played a solid game
Ka mau te wehi
Lourde défaite
Its good to see and hear the 1888 New Zealand Natives, Captained by Joe Warbrick, finally being acknowledged and recognized. Maori rugby, as stated, has a 134 year history in this country and were the first team from New Zealand to tour outside of Australia and in parts of Great Britain playing 107 games all up, winning 78 of those clashes. As such, they also were the first to perform the Haka on a sporting field, and as we've seen, that tradition has stood the test of time inspiring other nations to either borrow or conjure up their own war dances, more specifically the Pacific Island teams.   Some people act like the Maori team popped up only 10 years ago to create division within New Zealand when it was an idea first proposed and supported by New Zealanders of European heritage intially to exploit England's fascination with Natives. In 1868 An Aboriginal cricket team toured England with great success so they'd hoped for the same reaction. Guess they got it because The New Zealand Maori have beaten top tier nations for well over a century and have an equally impressive win/loss record to show for it.  So the idea of this "Race based team" was a concept developed by Europeans now white kiwis of a certain vintage have a problem with something their forebears created.  Congratulations to the New Zealand Maori team on a good win. Here's hoping the NZRU treat you alot better given your track record and storied connection to the game here in Aotearoa.  From your friendly Viking Kiwi.
Bit ignorance when it comes to the skin colour of a lot of the Maori players. Hopefully some of you Irish fans stop judging considering your history with being discriminated against. Might help you guys win a wold cup 🤔
Mean Maori Mean!
maari alblacks everybody
Great win! An fantastic runnin trys. Cheers fullas!
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Yeah boys awesome win  brutal and clinical attacks great game .
We welcome the northerns to some real rugby, not those talkers from up north, that is why we have 8 world cups to 1 ,you guys are like rookies to us southerner's, welcome to the real league,I wonder what the excuses going to be 😂😂😂😂😂
Cullen Grace should be called into the All Blacks after this
luv those fair haired maori boys 😃
tough first up match and thats the slowest international team i've seen
Well done Māori   Goes to show,actions not words!
Strong performance all round. The MAB pack stood up in the tight, to support the speedsters. That's always a massive component when playing an Irish team. The ABs really need a next generation of tight five players or it's going to be a lean decade. Big test on Saturday, against a much stronger Irish team. Really disappointed Will Jordan won't be there finding space. Respect again to Bundee who has been one of Aotearoa's finest rugby exports.
Wow!  Much respect to the Māori ABs from the USA!
Fantastic victory by the Māori boys. Well deserved victory. If we didn’t know before now what we’re going to be up against in the test games, well we do now.
......congrats Maori All Blacks, a well deserved win. C'mon All Blacks.
Bullshit ireland  embaressing!
MAORI,S  MAORI,S  AWESOME  YEE HAA 💯🙏
Mean Maori Mean.🤙
A great game would be between the the Māori all blacks and a Caucasian only South African side. Both proud nations.
How good was Zarn Sullivan? Absolute gun. Also cheeky little check by Dickson to allow Ioane to go through that hole
Well done to the Maoris! I more or less expected this. The Irish are overrated. Somehow they thought they were something special after beating the All Blacks last year, yet they could not win 6 Nations, La Rochelle pumped the (Irish-in-disguise) Leinster, then a young Bulls team with not a single Springbok in their run-on side also beat Leinster in Dublin, and finally the Stormers knocked out Munster in the semis of the URC. Good, of course, but certainly not something special. Cheers from Safferland chaps! 😉
tj perenara my new hero
mean maoris MEAN!! Well played. very cool tribute to Sean Wainui, rip rangatira!!
Was this Irelands top side?
Good on the Maori ABs for letting TJ have a run when the lead was too much for even him to blow!!! : )
Te waiata during the break in play was very European wtf...I tried ringing the Waikato stadium to strongly complain, a efn disgrace, come on my Tainui iwi get the waiata sorted please there are thousands of beautiful Maori waiata get your act together....
Outstanding performance by the MAB
MAB'S won by a mile and we deserved.  And I am not say the ref lost it for us because he didn't...... but my NZ fans welcome to the strange world of Wayne Barnes.. next week he could not give a off side decision in the hold game . . I really hope he's not the Ref is he ???
Bundi Aki, slowest centre since Earls gave the team talk!
What a great match.
Well done to the Maori. Fully deserved win. We were slow out of the blocks and some very sloppy play. Great to be finally alive and kicking in this tour, hopefully performances will improve on this.
Welcome Ireland. Boy you're gon get it. If I end up being wrong, good because it means you're truly truly a brilliant force to be reckoned with and I prefer the Irish over the braggart Poms any day of the week.  However just prepare to get clapped.
Thanks for this. Was travelling and missed the game. Good edit 👏🏻 🇮🇪 🇳🇿
Did this count as a test match or not?
🌿WELL DONE BOYS🌿What an exciting game! A well earned win 🥇
I hear the price of plasterboard in N.Z is off the charts! 🔨 🇮🇪
Very strong Māori All Blacks team
Holy hell MAB were not even at full strength...our young MAB were meke.💯
such a cute little theatrics at the beginning of the game. I was expecting the Irish to do River Dance. keep this clownesque dance in the locker room.
Thank you so much for the wonderful gesture for Sean wainui Much love to Ireland
Off loads, off loads, off loads !!! Gratz MAB !
All-Blacks getting rid of Perenara slowly but surely
I'm not irish nor a kiwi. I find the try celebrating with the tongue out tryna be gansta really really cringe
Hopefully Ireland take this as a wake up call before Saturdays test which of course is going to be completely different.  Can't believe the quality of some of those MABs, NZ just churning out quality youngsters
Congratulations to the young bloods of the Mab's demonstrating skills at the utmost level more international games please to enhance more experience for the boys thankyou Ireland Godbless 🙏
The maori all blacks should be able to qualify for world cups
Yes welcome the awesome irish im sure they will up there game against the abs..maori side did well to combat that irish defence which was border line off side through the whole match...wayne barnes gives me a heartattack lol
Black don’t crack baby
The Maori team should be in the world cup..
Foreshadowing 😱
Sullivan will b a all black soon sevu Reece better look out..
congratulazioni maori all blacks  eccellente kia ora
MAORIS LIKE SULLIVAN AND IOANE STEPHENSON AND WEBER
I would've liked to have seen at least a few points scored in the 2nd half by MAB but still stoked with the dub.
I never expected a Cricket score that's for sure. Not a good way to start a tour but I'm sure the Irish will be back. Well done Maori, well done NZ.
That off pass before contact from Coombes on Aki’s try was brilliant. He’s such a strong ball carrier and he took two out of the game, he needs to be doing little tip on passes like that and mix it up if he’s going to get into this Irish team ahead of Doris and Conan.
Smashed em bro! Mean Māori mean!
Ireland are in for a rough tour lol
Good game Māori boys in saying that Ireland by 5 against the all blacks ngamihi
Great performance from the MAB's.  Creative & clinical. Ireland' hey-day is long over & they looked like a 3rd rate team.  -Ireland better improve drastically or they're gonna get smashed on Saturday.- Ireland's Test side need to be a lot better or they're gonna get smashed on Saturday.
Really proud 👏  great work MAB
small agile fast guys beating big brutes
I find the term 'Maori All Blacks' a bit racist - the team are distinguishing themselves from the AB with a racial  tone. This from a hyper sensitive Saffa. We would not dare to distinguish like this.
Great performance. Expected and happy with that. Look forward to Saturday clash!
Congrats to the Maori AB's they were by far the better team and deserved the win. A few future AB's there I think. Zarn Sullivan was very impressive. They'd easily be in the top tier of international teams if they were their own nation so to speak. Disappointed as an Ireland fan, we were a bit brainless at times, particularly around the rucks and I think theres a few guys that are a lot further away from test level than we thought. All in all though the young fringe guys will learn more from that against quality opposition than smashing Canada, the USA or teams of that ilk.  Roll on Saturday for the big one, really looking forward to it.
Is the Maori All Blacks like the SA 'A' version of SA rugby?
Well done MAB.! Except the bench player who raised the middle finger up! Disgrace!! The next thing the must learn is to respect their opponents at all time, and that’s make this game great 👍
Lol Ireland are useless against any side with 15 on the pitch
Rest in Power Sean Wainui. 🙌🏽
Ireland tackling is wooful. We would need to improve but it looks like a shadow team.   Congrats to the NZ Maoris. 👍
Many ABS Māori must play in the ABS like Cullen Grace… Josh Ioane..
ABS Māori and ABS will eat Ireland in the series
From a Munster fan. Well done The Maori. Wonderful heads and hands up rugby. My lot? Better wake-up and quick. Was pleased for our  St Bundee to get a try.
Awsum ref u reffed a good game,no cards no high tackles 🤙
Thanks for the highlights - shamefully this game was not on Irish tv only sky .
Hate to lose but Māori were too good - Coombes and frawley looked very good to me .Front row were better than many expected and the handling was ok .All in all a good outing with no major injuries to anyone so a great warm up .
Well done boys...awesome game.
That first half was a clinic from the Maori.
Kak funny
as an Ireland fan I'm happy enough with that. MAB's have some very experienced guys and some very talented, quick young guys. Our inexperienced lads got a good run out and did themselves proud imo.
Brilliant rugby. NZ depth of talent and leadership is right up there with Ardern's example.
ireland can't tackle. dreadful
Fantastic Win!
Mean Maori mean , , learn how to say Maori prob Mr commentator
Why did we (Ireland) play our 2nd team?
Mean Maori Mean... Awesome victory...the Maori All blacks is a special kind of team..Congratulations brothers
great game‼︎
Congratulations MAB💪🏾
Let’s go MAB baby
great game by the pacific islander team. i hope they let all maori around the world  play and not just kiwi. Maybe in 2050
Could chuck the MABS in the WC and they’ll prolly make the final if not semis, NZ Rugby has too much talent
Well done, Māori All Blacks. 👍😁
This won't help Shaun Stevenson to like himself less.
.that rush defence stuff didn't work this time!!
Disappointing to see the stadium so empty, but fantastic rugby my Kiwi brothers 💪🏽🔥❤️
Let's remember something here, these guys the Maori's are among the top players to the All Black's Are no mugs, Ireland will do better - now doubt about it
Playing on tour in new  Zealand is probably the ultimate litmus test of a player many a top team have come up short against the maori
The Māori All Blacks comfortably better all over the pitch. So much so that they stepped off the gas at half time with the result already secured. That's got to worry the Ireland camp.  Lots of Ireland fans claiming today's team was full of second string players. That Māori All Blacks team was effectively NZ C/D. So not convinced that excuse holds up to scrutiny.
As someone who isn't Australian or kiwi would it be a ridiculous idea to have maybe a test match between the Maoris vs wallabies A just a suggestion
Tyrell had greesy hands which put the team under alot of pressure, Josh missing kicks and knocking the ball on put the guys under pressure..as well as giving TJ who is the most experienced player on the field the evil eye when TJ got on the field showed alot..(yeah I saw that)  Good win and I'm glad but they do have issues to address..
What the hell was that pass on the last try on the first half lol
Some of these guys don't look to be Maori, care to explain?
Handled that Rush defence with excellence! If only the ABs can resonate with those tactics.
No shame in losing to the Maoris. They've beaten Lions sides who've had weeks of prep. Really disappointed with Irelands game management though. How many offsides around their 22 to let the pressure off or in the irish half in kickable positions? Also lads throwing ridiculous offloads when the ball is like a bar of soap. Game would have been close otherwise. Shoutout to the Maoris for their skill levels and they were insane at the breakdown. Timoney and Prendergast normally v good at stealing ball and couldn't get a sniff. Hopefully we can give you a better game next week if we have enough players to put a side together! 😅
Not sure about this not showing the full haka ones 🤥
Watching the Maori, an epiphany: South Africa should have a Tribe of Origin Cup.   Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho et al., Kleurling (dunno the PC term du jour for Kolbe’s ethnicity, apologies), Anglos, and Afrikaners.   Would actually be epic.
Ireland embarassed, beautiful
Well done lads!!
Just proves u just need size over skills. Maori just seemed to big up front
What a disappointing crowd.
That was a lovely gesture to Sean Wainui and his family. The MAB's were great and it was an excellent lesson in what international rugby is all about for all the Irish young lads. Good entertainment too. Of course it will be a totally different Irish team on Saturday probably with the exception of Bundee. Really looking forward to a cracking contest between these two. It's great that is has become a true rivalry between them. I'll be watching in an Irish bar in İstanbul from 10am local time with the game starting at 11. It's been quite a few years since I had Guinness with my breakfast!!  Lol. Enjoy the game everyone!
What a great game
should've included Zarn's 50/22 that led up to the first try
Seki boys..lessgo ma maoris
Hahaha, I was just sitting here grinning when I read Irish news etc saying they are going to come beat the All Blacks😂😂😂😂 you don't just go to NZ and beat the All Blacks. Even the springboks have to go and give 120% and then maybe win half the games by 1 point. Good luck kiwis, go smash those loud mouth northerners
Awesome performance! That fullback is class!
awesome,
Ataahua😍🙏🕊
I see why the DJ at the stadium is full of nostalgia with the old school jams instead of today's music. 😂
Why are there so few spectators in the stands? Is there a already a plethora of international rugby games that take place in Hamilton?   I thought the Kiwi public were supposed to be “rugby mad”. I’ve seen larger crowds at Zebre vs the Dragons.
thanks  to the irish for giving the mabs these games
These were great highlights  Thanks, from Australia
They lost to the Maori B team badly by the 1st half lol  Imagine Maori players overseas or in ABs picked there. Still would win comfortably, much respect
I hate Ioane's kicking routine, he doesn't put himself in position to get distance on the ball. Seems to be more about the routine aesthetics than it is about the actual kick
It’s nice to see Tonga,Samoa,Fiji and the odd New Zealand player doing well against Ireland 😂😂
they should do a maori abs vs all black game.
massive from the Maori All Blacks...Cullen grace and brad webber for me has proven the All Blacks selectors that they should have been in that squad....Good hit up lads,
Webber for Finlay Christie
Why do 6 nations countries kick so much for no reason
Awesomeness
Ireland will be a different prospect , will be much closer, this was a hit out ! - ABs should take it by 7 though.
Typical Irish team when World Cup draws near 🤣🤣🤣
Hahahaha Ireland smashed by MABS, wait til big boys come in Saturday. Easy win
Wayne Barnes is anti Irish no one penalises them more it’s quite well documented, may be to do with his privileged English background which has a lot of ant Irish resentment. The Maori played very well as you would expect but not to forget that this is Ireland’s c team.
imagine if Ireland beat the Allblacks on Saturday...we will know how bad of  coach Foster is along with the selectors
Very disapointing performace from a good irish side
Maori's should have their own team at the world cup. They are easily a top 10 team
Would like to get the definition of a Maori - thought they were indigenous people.
👏
Well done Maori All Blacks from Ireland
That's the Ireland C team. Just a chance for some up and coming players to get a taste of some test rugby. What is Wayne Barnes doing down there ffs. Hes anti Irish teams.
Fantastic 1st 40. Credit to the boys. Although fell away in the second half, We came away with the Double U
Enough of this 2nd string bs.  When u make a international side your the best in the country, the difference from the abz and every other nation is that even when we bring through fresh blood they play like experienced and if any of the abz played like the Irish did tonight then they would be dropped and most probably not make the team again and that’s the difference from abz and Irish there’s no excuses.  You either step up or get dropped full stop the Māoris we’re just too good even Irish’s 1st string would have struggled. Irish’s breakdown work actually looked mediocre and for once the Māoris dominated all over the park.
Well done to the Máori.!! Not surprising really, let's hope Saturday is much closer!!!
NZ fan don’t be taken away by that result..That’s there B team.Irea..will b a different team come Sat night..Test match is wat matters to en
Doitz!!!
LOVED THAT!! GOOOO MAORIS!!!! Surprised at how emphatic that was!!! Ireland will be thinking (was this this their first team?) if the All Blacks have similar intentions...or look different to this Maori team. Sullivan, Josh Iaone, Stephenson, Grace, Weber...all the team, played well. Proud Jamaican supporting AB fan here. The heartland did you and forefathers proud.
Why are their white fellas is the Maori team? Am I missing something?
Surely Shaun Stevenson and Josh Ioane play for Samoa one day. Take your talents there boys, you will be great value.
Ouch that’s going to be a v long tour for Ireland!!
Grace was awesome. Sullivan had a game that caught everyone's eye and suafoa
Great stuff my Maori boys. Ireland will come back strong, bring on the next match of the tour.
good stuff lads
Black & White Toa From Aotearoa.  It's been a great year for The Maori Rugby & Rugby League team. TU MAORI!!! Welcome to New Zealand Ireland. Come on All Blacks, just follow the Kiwi League teams phenomenal performance when you play against Ireland.
Yikes my beautiful boys in green. I get that farrell wants to blood his newbies asap but yeesh
Why are there so many Connacht players in this team? Andy farrell has never won anything as head coach and never will. He consistently selects the most illogical squads. How the hell has Cian Prendergast made the squad over Jack 'player of the year' O'Donoghue? The problem isn't our over reliance on sexto or squad depth, it is our head coach. This season, international and provincial irish rugby has not been good. Leinster having a very favourable path into the heineken cup final does not stand to anything. Andy Farrell needs to go. This Leinster team we all know he will select for the first test will be beaten, no doubt. He 'province washes' Ireland in these small games and still does a bad job. At least gives us a side of players that actually have a chance of breaking into 'Ireleins' first team. You've got to go blud
Sullivan and Stevenson are serious Players, Special.
Northern hemisphere talks too much. 3-0
4:40 I like how Josh just runs around the no12.  Lovely stuff.  I would have this Maori All-Blacks as the All-Blacks literally.
Few Samoan players on the Maoris team.
Enough said we were just missing the impact man ,William wairua
Whatta 1st half of rugby 🏉
The only way we will get players more experience and depth is by these games. To write frawley off as an international forever based on his first game is a stupid opinion
4:37 this play here from Suafoa gives me hope that the NZ system is shifting more toward a tactical playstyle. Targeting the Irish's rush in defence and exploiting it is a mindset that the All Blacks have been slow to catch up to the rest of the world on
The Haka is getting a bit....commercial...now, sadly.
Mean maori
This should be the all blacks well done cuzzys
Can't see Ireland winning the AB's, just can't.
Yeah the brothers str8 maori back yard footy
What a awesome game and Haka from MABS
Ireland was offside how many times and they stop the game soo much with heaps of injury’s 🤦🏾‍♂️
Irish going down injured constantly in the second half, but luckily most of their injuries can be cured by pouring water on them. It must be from a magical spring.
What a thrush whanau🤙🏾
Just watch Shaun Stevenson grow into an "ALL BLACK" legend.
Piki mai!
Should tell the commentator it's not Island
solid win brothers mean ma maoris
Maori going places!!!!!     Iiiiiii!!!! Aaaah! Ha! Haaaaa!!!!!!!
Well played Māori👌❤️
That was a great performance Maori AB's!. First half they were brutal and clinical. Such beautiful micro skill moments, slick handling at the line. Much to like from the loosies they combined well. Grace just carried on his Crusader form, Billy Harmon wouldn't look out of place in the AB's. Cameron Suafoa never heard much of him but he was a beast when carrying. Walker-Leawere very underrated but he's a solid player great ball carrier, Ollie Norris is destined for AB's he's a young gun. The backs got the rewards from the forwards hard work and they played sharp, all in all great win Maori All Blacks.
134 years unbeaten !
MEAN MAORI MEAN 🤠🍻🤠👍
Messy game with plenty of penalties. Congrats Maori ABs
Barnes is still the worst ref on the planet. Feel sorry for the Irish there 😂
This is the stuff that keeps young in NZ want to play 🏉
ka pai
IF an Ireland side can't beat New Zealand B side; how can they beat the A side? haha
Get Grace in the ABs. Māori scrum dominant, lineout solid, but surprisingly they also stopped the Irish maul dead in its tracks. Without those platforms, Ireland midweek team didn’t really have the attacking threats to get the result. The Māori defence will have to improve, as there were some huge holes to run through, but Ireland unable to control the ball well enough in the conditions to exploit them and Māori scrambling was good. Second game will be much more interesting and the Irish will have a better understanding of some of the lesser known Māori players and how to shut them down.
new drinking game that gets you drunk? Have a sip of beer every time an Ireland player goes down injured
Where was Shaun Stevenson this year for the chiefs???
