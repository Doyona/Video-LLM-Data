“65 million dollars generated”  Flex’s 2k all in 1’s
$M1000000000000
Retire me plz I
Money can’t buy happiness
“I used to landscape for $10 an hour so imma flex”  Well, given how inflation has occurred, $10 an hour for when Jake was landscaping is actually good pay. Also, its called a first job. Everyone has a first job. Stop trying to act like you came from a poor family that struggled to get by each day.
Y’all need to realize that Jake is in character, if you guys can pull this much money out of ur ass then do it y’all are just jealous that Jake is making a living out of this.
He retired a fighter that was already retired
Best part 0:40
Remember when he said buckle in your seatbelts like we’re on a plane. Well we have no internet so we can’t watch him.
He's like I got paperrrrrrr all I see is 1 DOLLERS

I feel like people are missing something. This video doesn’t look like flexing to me. It looks like him proving a point with an added splash of sarcasm.
Anyone else remember back in 2018, when the youngest "flexer" lil tay hopped out of Jake's lambo like she just bought it?
the comment section is more entertaining that this man's channel
Imagine flexing maybe 1000 in 1s

How could I seriously have thought that he was going to donate even a cent to charity instead of flexing it.
This is the weirdest video I’ve ever seen 😂 this is like a Snapchat some guy that’s been trying to get with you sends to his story and then also directly to you lol. And then you and all of your friends laugh about it
Stop hating on jake tho
If you mean give the other person a retirement fund then yea I guess you are retiring them
This is going to be so embarrassing when he grows up.

He’s talking about how he got 10 dollars an hour doing landscaping. I’m a server who relies on tips for any sort of money, each time I get a paycheck it’s 0 dollars. This dude needs to grow up 🙄🙄
No one askes
I wanted to search up Jake Paul bc I was curious about the comment section and if anyone actually liked him- but it was a hard battle cuz i didn’t want YouTube to start recommending me this trash
landscaping actually pays a very good amount and isn’t that miserable of a job to have like other minimum wage jobs would be
Fight Mike Tyson you got so many 1's you could get in the place
This guy is been at 20 mil for 3 years LOL
That money less real than v-buck generators

Bryce hall makes this guy look like a saint
Fair play he did good fuck all jealous bastrds I think he beats mayweather  Easy. Laugh if you want but he will beat a lot of pro boxers in his weight easy, canelo no chance but I think jack Paul fights like ggg and punches like a light heavyweight
Imagine acting like you started from nothing and acting like you where the outcast when you had rich parents and where a bully/nuisance
You are an awful person
So idiot
If Jake beats tommy fury people will look at him different. That would legitimize him.
Damn bro thats like $300 easy 😂
Jake paul is America in a person.

This guy is the embodiment of every dude in sport that has the best signed gear, spent high money on it and gets matched with the youngest kid with a 10 dolar gear carrying it in a plastic bag just to lose to them

Ok lil seedling
He’s always winning and he stays relevant due to his massive following and equally large amount of haters
I used to landscape😂😭
Do i care?
I love it when you say got yo hat
"Yow your the type of guy that will open a glass window to look outside"

Jake "THE PROBLEM CHILD" Paul. Man your head is so far up your ass, your brother called you out and you got so mad that you got banned from the fight. You became even more verbally abusive towards Floyd. Your brain is so small, even a punch in the face couldn't knock some sense into you. Keep being a clown, cause that's what your getting paid for. Lmao, headass.
When he paused to do the math in his head...
Next you got to fight danny duncan

This man needs to stop playing monopoly
You are an awful man.
It's Ma6ic brought me here
You and your brother are very weak minded and word is that your mother and father are very embarrassed of both of you. Y'all both look like a special needs person. Why do y'all have that special needs person look to you ? More and more people by the day are seeing who y'all are and hateing everything y'all are. It's only natural that your parents would be embarrassed.
thats great, morgz makes better quality videos than you'd ever make
Off brand conor mcgregor
Jake Paul your poor
Jake Paul your videos are st
Hey how are those turtles you ran over at the beach in Puerto Rico? Are you and your brother just professional assholes? Or is the selfishness just second nature?

Breaking news coming in youtube star jake paul going on a rampage beating up celebrities and old retired men on his journey to become a "pro boxer". Though surprisingly he's avoided any real boxers and is still in his brother's shadow who actually has the balls to call out an actual boxer
He's rubbing his wealth in front of us. why does he have more likes than dislikes. you have to give away that money to the poor. you need to grow a heart.
Manning who u fooling there's like only 20 dollars there loll

How much did you pay Ben Askren?
This is a defination of ONE who isn't been raised with money. . You know im sayinn??? Had he, he won't be like he is today because for one who has seen alot in the past won't even care of how much he's earning and will always be humble.
So you intentionally murdered a bunch of endangered turtles finding that fun and funny? PR better slam you in jail
Some one show the world what this lads are all about!  Nothings but a G thing!!!
Who should I retire next but Ben was retired 😐
Forget retiring why don’t u get in the ring with someone who actually boxes

Wowwwwwwwwwww
Jake box the clowns that came to ur house 2 years back
Just sayin, Eddie hall called you out 😂
Ok but see why did he remove the song these days like that song was lit he should really bring it back
If Jake Paul could only fight two people, Ma6ic or a 4 year old boy, you know that preschooler is about to get slept.
My favorite part is the add
they might be all 1s but can’t deny the fact he made more money then all of us could in our whole life in those few seconds
You should fight Manny Pacquiao so that you can taste the real fight.
All 1 dollar bill's what a bum

Fight Ricegum
White rice gum
I actually like how Jake Paul thinks he’s so good because he KO’s retired NBA Players 5 years ago but he’s actually in a fight (with Floyd Mayweather) he’s actually scared for his life. And the fact that he’s calling out Dana White when he’s the little pussy who can’t fight an active UFC Fighter or Boxer.
Retire me
The biggest 🤡
Stop ducking itsma6ic
Ur lisp sounds good
You seen Tommy Fury? Heard he's looking for ya..

Idiot- people work harder jobs for less than ten even as adults.
You’re a really bad man please stop influencing young kids.
Why does he have 1 dollar bills lol
box ryan garcia or canelo or someone who can actually box instead of retired mma fighters and gamers
Wowwwwwwwwww,no one care about your fucking money buddy 😅😅

Jake Paul fight magic puss
Coward

Jake the type of guy to say "1.3 million PPV buys" as he empties a small bag full of one dollar notes.
🤣 I see dollar signs! This man really sad! LMFAO
Bro said he came frm nothin & had to finesse out the gang way
Everyone be talking about the $1 bills but no one is mentioning the oversized shirt.

Sip juga bocah peler satu ini hahahahaha
That's what I expected, won't get in the ring with Liddell. It's only about money, or you would want to prove yourself. Jake "HA HA" Paul, the problem child becomes a joke, now lives in single duplex garage, broke, but still gets laughs!
You can buy a hat now instead of trying to take one
Every fucking kid or teenager has summer jobs, 10$ is so much money I used to paperboy for 2$ an hour.
There mad ones that’s cap
To all his fans this foo and his brother are some wannabes and ya that support em gonna cry when his wannabe ass boxer gets kdfo 😂

I'll take it
Came here after seeing Jake use Large Sun glasses to hide his black eye.
✈︎
Any more succes and people will start calling you the "Kardashian brothers"
Why 1$
You look like Walmart pewdiepie
The fact that all of them dollars are 1s is funny
Funny how his views are dropping like wildfire. A real rich dude would drop a bag full of $100’s, this is like $4k worth of 1’s
Wants to sit there and call himself a pro boxer, but has yet to fight a pro boxer!! 😂😂😂
Mayweather punching bag 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When are u going to fight a real fighter for 1mil
I see a lot of one’s
I used to watch u a few years ago, and now I came back, so mutch has changed.

I feel like Jake Paul has ADHD. It's actually pretty impressive what he has achieved with ADHD holding him back so much. Unironically pretty damn inspirational.
Jake is a sterper

Seriously grow up and be a man like your brother you literally sound and look and act like someone in middle school.
PFFFT acting like a baller with $1's. LMAO.
Jake 😐🖕
Bro you’re a man child. Your brother matured, but after him something went wrong in the formula and an irreversible outcome was produced.
Remember when we used to know this guy exists?
I used to landscape That’s the 1000th time he said that
Jake is that one kid that shows off the off-brand headphones or phone in school and thinks hes cool
''got ur hat'' crys with a black eye running away

I remember when I used to watch jake paul. Ngl has a good fighter, he was a good youtuber. Well he still is he just went to fighting so he stopped his vlogs and things like that. So in my opinion he should definitely keep going and continue his fighting but goodbye vlogs. Keep it up jake paul!

Now, this microscope is so powerful that, by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe.   If I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in this video.😀

Song is called “Maxed out” by Reo Cragun. It’s in the description.
3-0
Everyone you have fought has been naturally smaller than you, Askren was a Welter/ Middleweight with no boxing ability whatsoever, its obvious why you are ranked 600+ in the Cruiserweight division(on boxrec) , challenge Bredis or someone that is actually a boxer, challenging Mayweather just makes you guys look like pussies though, he is naturally lighter than Askren but he will beat your ass, your catch weight contests are a farce.
Why don’t u try canelo
The worse Boxer ever. I've seen little kids fight better than that... Jake Paul you're an Amateur.... 👎👎👎👎

Calling Jake Paul a pro boxer is like calling Bruce Jenner a woman....interesting times 🤣🤣
Jake Paul doesn't own his home his vehicles or any of the luxurious things he brags about.  An investor owns all of this and jake is budgeted and lives in property he doesnt own and drives cars he doesn't own.
Yeah for your daddies that own you aka your "investors"
Miss the old content but we like the new content
Crazy how you can get 500$ in 1s and recreate what he did n he claim to make over a mill n that fight

Fight someone who can fight and then ill be supporting you.
hi jake pls give my family back our house key:(
I never understood how you call yourself a boxer but haven’t boxed any boxers yet. Just a YouTube, a retired basketball player, and a washed up ufc fighter. You said you wanna retire the next person but the last 2 had to come out of retirement to fight you.
Bro, Eddie hall said he’d fight you after he fights Thor
Mow. That. Lawn. Oh. My. God.
I love jake paul

Fuck the ring, step into the octagon. That's going to be the closest thing to a legit street fight.
Chleba
Can he fight a real fighter instead of a boxer and a basketball player?
Werid flex
jake paul would knock out mayweather
Stacks of 1's,why you flex so hard?!??!?!?
I see u flexing ones
you went from my favorite youtuber to someone I cant watch  because there is nothing to watch!
So first you say you were bullied by ur teachers, while saying that you were the smartest in school som years prior   Now you apparently landscaped as a kid
Chill bro they all ones
Bro i'm so fucking sure, a true boxer will fuck up. Even i can do it for sure.  3 round you won't fucking last. You know who you need to fight so that you can win bastard
Yo, big man. I'll fight you, no money involved. I've never been in a ring in my life, just street fights. Fight me😉
So Askren being a world Champion for an "X" amount of time vs Brother Jake isn't much to debate about about or to get all restless.  It's only apparent because it's a drastic switch which Jake made... so what!, the guy feels it's in his blood that he can follow the passion(with professional training ofcourse to back it up).  **If a neutral ground is in affect**  "The senior guy at works who's late is just as looked down upon as a guy who started yesterday who's late"  In the this case we as a fan base are  management!  May the best f**n man win bro!
Give me 1 i will tatoo you on me
trash
you are coked out of your mind
Nate Diaz is Legit though....let’s see if it happens
You should fight Adrian Broner next Jake.
Jake  I have been a fan for years I love what you became keep doing what you're doing but I caught three cases nothing serious all ibonds but need Court feescash app anything  joanne0620

Just shut up
Eddie hall wants to fight you. I think you should fight him.
Yo that speaker lit
Nice work brother. Moving forward, you've got to fight someone with at least a little bit of boxing credibility and smoke them too, to keep the train (aka the firetruck) rolling
Who should you retire next? How about someone who actually is a boxer or someone who hasn't retired already?
Fight Fury then ya pussy.
Dude he looks kinda down, depressed and lonely. He isn't much happy bout it. You can see it in his face.
Retire your Mom and Dad Next! It's a No Brainer!
Really worked hard to get here good job jake im proud of you !
$65 million generated and you only got $1000 in 1’s???
People who pay to watch his fight. R idiots

Most people want  money so they can be happy.  Happiness and wellbeing comes from achieving goals both small and big, short term and long term. For this guys sake let's hope he hasn't reached his end all, one and only goal. Otherwise, it's goodbye happiness, hello my old friends, sadness and depression.

You're poor
Jake Paul is flexing on yall
Wow. My comment just disappeared..... what a little sissy
Dude only challenges guys out of age, undersized, or have no boxing skills.  DC asked what's up and you got scared. You talk so much BS on camera.  Fight DC.  You only wanna fight by your rules and your hand pick opponents. PUSS
A BUNCH OF ONE DOLLAR BILLS? LMAO
69 dollars omg
I’ve seen more ones thrown at a pole dancer

Give me my 10,000 dollars I owe you..
Put me in coach 🥊 I got 2 years of boxing under my belt.
I wish the old jake paul can come back team 10 and the old days and the old house 😞😭
Does Jake Paul get enjoyment out of this? Showing a bunch of 1 dollar bills to 7 year olds on their parents accounts?
People who think money is everything are often very shallow in their personality. Like a an actual talented musician said " flex flex flex gotta flex flex flex, cuz when you got no personality replace it with a rolex"
I think it’s 65 dollars
me : yes i got 200$   Jake Paul : sh*t man i got 65million B*ch
Why you decline Yoel Romero?
Looked more like 5 grand tops! Haha
Still a douche.
All 1$'s??? I got more money then this clown 😆💯🙄🙄🙄

Mr jake Paul ben askren was already retired

Anyone congratulating Jake Paul is a idiot, Ben stood no chance. He chooses his opponent's carefully, He'd never fight an actual decent opponent.
thas 1 dollar bills
good job bro you are the goat
Still a fuckin douche nozzle huh bud
Shrshhhh
Regardless of money etc! Jake has done great in the YouTube world.. no one can deny that! But a reality check is that he fights guys he knows he can beat! If the mans a fighter.. back it up & take on Tommy fury like he said he would! But he won’t because he knows he will get Knocked out straight away! Generate all the money you want.. girls etc lifestyle! But reality is in your heart your a fighter.. but in the ring jake is a amateur fighter at the very best! No ones jealous all of us live different lives etc! I know the guy makes X amounts of money! But fight a real fighter & see what happens.. he won’t have a answer
bro what have you turned into jake
Amount of people who watch Jake Paul: 1% Amount of people who are accidentally still subscribed to Jake Paul: 99%

Jake scared of DC, he a little boy.
pls retire your self next and never comeback.
Mr. 3-0 vs non boxers but yet is afraid to step in the octagon with Daniel Cormier and fight in his element. The 3 people u beat stepped out of theirs, why won't u?
That looks like its more than 100M$
Jake: mommy can I have some money whilst u record this video real quick
Fight DC
Jake have you seen the people that have been calling you out
You wanna fight Tommy fury I give you 2 or 3 rounds and you'll be on the deck spark out, fight a real boxer you idiot
You’re gonna flex on us with 1 dollar bills?🤣🤣🤣
I want to see you and Connor McGregor
One Dollar Dollar Bill Yoooooooo
Poor guy... all he have is money...

The amount of likes compared to the amount of people clowning on Jake here really makes you think that people may just be liking this video ironically.

Lemme hold a dollar
If Jake Paul is a “boxer” then why is he challenging mma fighters? Challenge a reputable boxer Jake!
Yea boiiiiiii
Can you purchase some morales with that money?
Chleba ! Chleba ! Chleba ! Come visit Czech Rep.
XD
Nobody can stop their death by money 💵💵
dıs lıke I'AM TURKEY KING
Fight Tommy fury
Imagine being that scared to fight boxers that you have to admit everyone on your hitlist are mma fighters. If thats the case why arent you fighting in MMA. He can say he hasnt trained in MMA but ive seen him have a MMA fight so he has some little clue about it. Hes just scared. Scared of Tommy Fury CLEARLY thats so obvious and also scared to fight any MMA fighter in the octagon. He needs to get them out of their element before he fights them. Very embarassing
fight faze temprrr
Maybe next time you call out a UFC fighter, oh, idk, maybe GO TO THE UFC
He’s got abt $30 there
Clown
song name ffs
I love jake been here since the beginning
Pls do more vlogs its evry day bro

Didn't he say mayweather is insecure because he talks about money all the time?
Why you always challenges an mma fighter in a boxing match??? I thought you're a boxer, challenge a real boxer then.. and you'll get what you're looking for...
I won't mind, Come to South Africa everything is cheaper
Cmon fight temperr or you scared

Idk if i asked
Hey please know your place
60gs baby now shut up and let’s fight lol
Shut up come try fight me
Fight me you cat ass
Jake Paul asking Usman to box him. So sad new generations, just following the money 💰. If you want to become a real boxer, get into boxing and find someone with your weight and size. You can't just be picking on smaller than you MMA fighters. If you want to fight an MMA fighter, then become one, do it in the octagon. Stop trying to get negative attention for money. If you like boxing, fight boxers, and fight boxers your size. All you are doing is trashing a millennial sport. This is my personal opinion and  an advice.
Hey...I can also do that with 100 one dollar bills.
1.3 million people scammed. Such a shame
ㅂㅅ
You used to landscape for $10 an hour Cesar Chavez was 14 years old picking grapes made $1 a hour, worked 70 hours and those $70 he made he gave it to his mom I bet with your $10 a hour you went shopping
Man I remember back when I would watch his team 10 vlogs.... now this man is addicted to cocaine and fighting 😂😂
Strippers get that much,i mean bitches do the work!

Absolute trash
Fight conor
Fckin boxer

Retire me or that video is cringe
“I used to landscape for $10 an hour so I’m gonna flex on y’all haha”.......You’re idea of flexing is to have a busted ass bowling ball bag filled with $1 bills and a measly $100 bill to follow? Psh Bitch please I’ve got more than that under the seat of my truck gtfoh

Dumbass says" who should I retire next" when he's only fought retired dudes who can't box... 🤣
How much time it took to print all these papers 📑 📄        Flexing
You should retire yourself ✌🏻✌🏻
Cormier agreed to fight, get in that octagon
Keep flushin out the bums love seein mma guys fall
I would fight Jake for half of what Askren got. 💯 Id rather it be mma or grappling.. but I’d still get knocked out for that kind of scratch. Selling Pokémon cards barely pays the bills.
I miss the old jake paul😔
Spiritual bottom.
Yo Jake respond to gib he wants a second knockout
Funny
Fight canelo next hahah 😂 😂 😂 😂

Lmao Faze Temper will end his career
Still claiming to be a "fighter/elite fighter" but scared to fight DC. Ducking DC in a real fight. Soft in the middle.
I would like to see you call out Mike Tyson
I like you Jake, but a boxer like Tommy fury ends your 0 record rather easily... The same way an MMA fighter cannot beat you in a boxing ring, You cannot beat a real, quality boxer who eats and breaths boxing and has done since childhood... Fury stops you inside 3.
they're ones
Hes still *an immature prick Edit: *an
Mayweather be flexing those Hundo's
I see a lot of dollar bills there ?
How the fuck is this guy still relevant????
Worst Connor McGregor imposter ever.

Spoiler alert. The money is divided to everyone involved. He got about 3 mil. Sorry.
a bunch of 1ns lol
I just wanna see fury take the fight and show him how boxing really is

Clown
Ayo you need to stop being lazy you need to make fun of videos you used to make it all the time but you need to make it some more The only thing that you are doing is flexing

Everybody starts out working for 10 dollars an hour. You can’t complain about former income until you’ve had to skip dinner some nights cause you can’t afford and and you have a broken window or 2 because you can’t afford to get it fixed. But also “I used to work for $10 an hour”
Retire your dream match you wanna have cause I wanna see that

Retire @FaZe Temperrr
Didnt ya boy Masvidal get dropped?
Better go to the bank and order some more $1 bills.  😂😂😂😂😂 This chump for real? 😂😂
The mockery with he numbers and no one sees it
Get in the oct. your fights have been jokes. Fight someone that’s younger, and in shape. You’ll get dropped like kimbo did. Jane Paul in the oct = cm punk 😂
All 1’s ahhahaahha. What a dummy
Ya your getting paid for beating no one...!fight a real mma fighter! He was already retired and got a surgery. I hope this dude gets 💨
All one😳
Who should you retire next. I think your agent if you getting paid in doller bills.. Absolute joke of a guy..
One point three million pay per view buys and all you got was $40 in one dollar bills! This was my first Jake Paul thing I've watched. I'm guessing he likes to dress up and play with his purses!
It's just 1 dollar bills
Dolla dolla bills
Faze temper
Lmao dude pours our singles likes hes been stripping for them. Seen 1 blue bill there..thats more like $2000 from cheek sweat
Didn't he just fight a guy that virtually was already retired lol 😅 He must have little skills to be so impressed with himself from that haha
Chleba
Those dollar bills?!?!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 laughing at you jake.
Idk I saw a lot of ones
You should take up Tyron Woodley on his offer
His mom was an RN and his dad was a landscape guy so he was definitely middle class idk why people saying he grew up rich and I swear this ain’t coming from a hardcore JP fan 😂
Connor Mcgregor next? Have fun getting your ass whooped XD
Flexing 1's
Lol 1 dollar bills
turd butt
Try to retire "Dragon"  LoL

Respond to woodley he ready to beat that ass
You won’t fight woodley though
Fight woodley

Where’s mini jake Paul you should bring him back
Hey Alexa, play Akon - Lonely
The comments so true and funny at the same time: "The ammount of lonelyness" "Only one dollar bills" "I used to be normal, now i  a lonely brat" All true.
He needs to ask macgregor for his richest mofos belt
Obviously Ben Askren was paid to get knocked out ,that was so obvious ,u are so cringe jake to pay somebody to win the match
When you are rich but dead inside
This guy such a waste ! He caught Ben he legit caught em but still doesn’t give him bragging rights ! Guy made a ton of cash because he taught the worst opponent for a boxing match ! Beat a real fighter !
Mi plus or Simone porr
WHATS THE NAME OF THE SONG PLEASE SOMEONE ???
If u keep flexing right infront of your viewers, imma still yo money and ur whole career baby😏💸.                     JK😂      If i did i might be on prison right now.
You should fight a boxer next.
Chleba
we should be helping Jake instead of pointing and criticizing, get this to a ton of likes so he can see theres a comunity that loves him and wants him to get around better people or get better advice to guide him through this all money fast lifestyle. im geniuenly asking for likes so jake can see and get better help this isnt for me.
Thats alot of one dollar bills
Crazy

People only paid to see you loose and unfortunately that didn’t happen .and as for who should you retire next . Maybe yourself

Bro those were all 1s
I wish you :) I think you have top people around you ČR !!! Chlebaaaa
This looks like a homeless guy panhandling with a purse and all 1$ bills
👍
Lay out Tommy fury, he wants to test your skills. Get more dubs under your belt, you can reach mayweather if you keep this up, be smart
Aye jake I useto do landscaping for 10 an hour when I was 11-17 ish and I still know the old man I useto help with landscape .. Im 20 now working at Tesla retire meeee
If I never had a dollar to my name before I still wouldn't show it off like this when I did.
Man, who you tryna stunt on? I took my _14 hunna stimmy check_ out in all 1’s for _a night at the club_ and it was _way more bulky_ than that! *LOL!!*
Bro, why in the *FCK* would you fill that bag that probably costs more than the amount of money you had inside of it, all in *1 DOLLAR BILLS?!* _Seriously, WHY?!_ I literally started to like you a little more after the Askren fight and came to your channel to see if you changed at all and I was _tragically,_ and I mean, _soooo fckn tragically and drastically_ let down. Only you, Jake Paul, would do something so incredibly stupid in an attempt to _“flex.”_ I wouldn’t do this because I would look just as stupid as Jake does right here but I could literally go to the bank and do the exact same thing. I could pull out a couple thousand dollars from my checking account and fill a bag that cost more than the money inside of it and dump it all out and I work at NASA as a quality assurance inspector. *LMMFAO!* Man, half of the teenagers watching this video have that much money you just flashed in this video. You have millions in the bank, *MILLIONS!* How hard is it for you to go get $100,000 in hundreds to make this video? Obviously it isn’t easy enough because you either tried or didn’t try at all… Good God. Gimme a fckn break, dude. Epic facepalm fail! Lol!!
Askren would wipe u out in the cage remember that and you never knocked him out the ref stopped it while he was standing up so it was a weak win Mr big chin
Looks like he keeps most of his doe in his big fxcking chin
It's all one dollar bills
That doesn't look like 65million
He looks so happy 😁
There is like one hundred bill there all ones
U look like a bum n plz get good at boxing cuz ur throws r insulting to the white ppl 😭🖐️ I've seen white ppl throw hands better than u
There all 1s 🤣
jake is 24 but looks 40
all these people are hating on jake? It just shows that your jealous jake keep up the good work.
This boy is so lonely, it's quite sad and pathetic. No amount of money will ever fill the void that he has. Jake, you're the most hated person on YouTube for a reason.
what song is this
I only saw 1 hundred dollar bill and the rest are 1 dollars
I know this has been said countless times, but Jake actually has the mind of an 11-year-old. It’s hard to fathom his stupidity, and sad to see that a person like this can continue to make money off children on YouTube.
I believe what u said just why use ones
Getting paid!!!! I'll box you for it!
Hahaha they were all ones hahahaha
Ay can I get some change of $1s
88e8w
He probably has like around $2000 there
Fight a known ufc fighter and I’ll shut up
He was already retired tho
Couldn’t you have at least made it 100’s...
Jake trying to show that he’s cool is the only thing about him that’s funny.
it’s all 1 my g
ITS THE GOAT
Donate some if it instead of wasting it on useless things
Jake get a hoodie of your problem child merch what says the on the hoodie I would cop instantly!
Can you beat manny pacquiao?🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Ouuu 1 dollar bills
Everyone out here making fun of this poor little guy. He OBVIOUSLY has special needs.
Jake your critics are forced to acknowledge you're a strong fighter. You're a winner.      Be good to your body, mind and spirit. God bless you kid.
No stop Cap I bet you can’t even afford that much money
I've been watching reactions on your fight and I got to say you would have clipped that guys head off I saw how right that referee decided to call off the fight because he saw that the eskren dude struggled
I miss old jake paul
1’s?
a totally empty person
SINCE YOU TOO SCARED TO FIGHT ANYBODY ELSE HOW BOUT THE DUDE THAT KICKED YOUR OWN BROTHERS ASS
Ur mom
Best part of it all! 0:39
Bet you won't offer mighty mouse a fight!! That's an l for you hands down!!

Those are 1’s...
Losers
how you gonna retire someone that was already retired 😭
Yo call out daddy Trudeau next!
Yeah, he flex hard with all those 1's. If you're looking for someone to fight, i could use a payday.
This is like feeling like you have everything but really you have nothing. But I felt that 10$ an hour landscaping job struggle.
Retire a 17 year old mma fighter, or are you scared of a challenge from a teenager?
Breathe for George Floyd!
Jake: How much of the 65 Million Dollars generated do you get? That's what's important! Great TKO!
all 1s
Before fight haters was saying Ben Arskren will beat Jake Paul easily......  Now they are saying Ben was some kind of blah blah blah blah...
I need 65 million dollars 💸 please send me the money please because I have disability’s I got autism and been boiled really severely and this will change my life
HEY JAKE! NICE FIGHT MAN! D.C. MIGHT FIGHT YOU IF YOU ALLOW HIM TAKEDOWNS ONLY. THEN YOU DROP THE HAMMER WHEN HE SHOOTS
Literally the definition of a douchtuber
it was all ones lmao
bruv you should be thanking us we gave u that youtube money....
hes acting like a little kid playing with his dads money
This is sad.
He probably dumps that money and then just tells his crew to pick it up for a bonus!
Am waiting for the day he fights an actual pro boxer. When that happens I will jump on the band wagon. Until then still a poser to me. 🤷‍♂️
I like how it was like all ones
Bro bro
Ahahaa lol you dumping out 1's fucking pleb
good luck bro
they paid you in 1 dollar bills?
One dollar bills
Fight Woodley you pussy
Stop being youtubes biggest assplug and fight Tommy fury
which song behind
He’s humble, he has no reason to flex, he started from the bottom and he aimed his way to the top independently. Said no one ever.
You would be nowhere without the people that ""support"" you.
“I use to landscape” something tells me your a bit off.
One dollar bills LMFAO
65 million dollars and ZERO FRIENDS  generated lol
Jake Paul is the type of guy to wash his hands after taking a shower
Next woodley😎
Next fight should be jake paul vs ryan garcia
You should fight a boxer if you're a boxer... Just saying. Fuck the money. You want people to take you seriously, box with boxers. As of now, regardless how much money you make, it's a joke. Wish you all the best.
You re the face of the fight game!!!
People who bought that PPV are showing early signs of CTE
Whoop DC ass!!!! take out the whole mma community with that win!!! You are a LEGEND
Dumps out 1's
Just when you thought he couldn't be more of a douche..... You live in a state, that is on the top of poverty... How many homeless people could this assh***** buy a house for with the money he sits with there... Here in europe, we think about how money could be spend for people who needs it.. In Jake's world, it's how much he can spend on himself...
These foo needs jesus ill fight this clown for free of course ill take $$$ do
Remember that stunt show thing on Disney you where in
What song is this?
How many of these money for Askren? Lol
That’s what Mr. Beast gives to his dog for breakfast
Good job keep it up ok your the best keep up the good work
Paper view buys???
Tommy fury next if you're no joke
Whoop Mike Perry ass for calling Michael Jai White the n word
All bunch of ones
okay but would you wanna throw 20’s on the ground and risk some of them flying away or getting ruined. literally stfu and let him live
Nice 1 dollar bills
But they're all 1s but nothing but love....
conor needs to teach this kid
I think if I took my next paycheck in all singles I'd probably be on par with this.
Time to fight Tyron Woodley next
Look closely. Those are 1 MILLION dollar bills. (Edit: Never mind. They are only 1 dollar bills. Weird.)
What is this video even supposed to mean?
cancer is real
Dudes so cringe.  Good for him though
Ben got knocked tf out damn jake your a legend bro
Askrens already retired😂
He rich we all know that but Jake why 1 dollar bills?
This guy just lies

FIGHT WOODLEY
He's a more annoying Dax, bragging about coming from being a janitor to rich, except landscaping smh

Lucas Dobre
Im personally gonna try to get famous so I can fight you in the ring
The whole squads laughing 😐

This would’ve been cooler if it was literally anyone else
That Robot was Dope!!
That was 1 dollar for every millisecond ben was standing up for before he took the dive.
If they were all 100 that would be better
Can yall just stop hating on jake paul bro like its nad annoying for yall treating him like this he has been grinding for this just stop hating
wow sooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool
Jake would make more money if he collected $1 from everyone who can't stand him.
Are those one dollar bills. Lmao
Weird flex but ok?
You can see 20's too. And other bills y'all just blind.
"retire" T Wood next please. I wanna see him release your soul from its body
This was so pointless

fun fact he hasn't boxed a actual boxer yet... youtuber, nba player and a retired wrestler
in 1 dollars well done buddy
Omg he just put like 100 dollars out of a bag!!
Mike Tyson still beat u
Until you fight a real boxer, money or no money, you're still a bitch.. Money is just paper dude.. That sack of money is the largest sack you got..
Give me job I’m tired of being broke 😞😞😆
Idk, maybe you should fight a fighter? It's like Usain Bolt racing a marathon runner on the 100m dash. It's clearly going in someones favor. Pretty sure even Andrei Arlovski could still woop you easily.
Wasn’t Ben retired ?
Hey ugly❤️
Fight a Boxer now. David Benavidez.
Nice
That is the most impressive stack of $200 I have ever seen!!
He'll call out Betty White next 😁
I knew watching it was a waste, but did it just to comment.. what a useless person

Fight a real fighter. That was an embarrassment.
Cringiest video ever.
Tak týpek si žije na vysokej nohe...
best part of the video 0:40
Hey Jake Paul I think you should fight Artem Lobov..... The PPV would be crazy....would be twice Jake vs Askren........ And definitely he is on the decline..... Lobov is a very funny man..... But he is a star for real in a weird way......and would make you closer more than ever to mcgregor...
All 1’s
Good for you you're flexing the money you have made by being a sociopath
when 69million dollars
When’s the Walmart employee fight?
“They’re all fookin ones” Conor McGregor
Try retiring me. I'll box the piss out of you
Jake Paul's reputation went from $325,000 to $1 within a year. How many worst mistakes does he make in front of entire internet??
Very cool jake

Make sure you save your money for cte medical bills.
It's time for you to fight Tyrone Woodley Jake. Lol. Tyrone Woodley is going to put you to sleep in boxing. He's going to retire your short boxing career.
Didn’t he said that he had 75 millions generated ?? He lying
CHAMP!!!

1 dollars
Please fight Nikita Ababiy
It's earned because yall watched and paid for the fight.
Your a monster in the ring
You gotta be proud to flex
To be honest, jake paul, you are just a disappointment to the internet.
You got there on your own
The guy was already retayerd
Lol
If you’re gonna be dumb you are a goat
All 1s

He's in the middle of serious allegations and this is what we see 🙃

Maybe fight an actual boxer? Or someone who isnt retired?
Ben bisey anlamadım birisi anlatabilirmi

When is he going to have his first fight?
We all know that you got paid 690.000 Dollars for the fight Jake.
Fight Dylon Moran next
Except you have brain damage, so who’s the real winner lolol
Jake's oddly obsessed with Ben... Why does he Tweet about him multiple times a day 😅 Like an ex gf that you secretly want back
I liked the music more than what he said, someone knows the name
Hey Jake, im fit as fuck, but never boxed!!! Ill fight you on ppv lets do this!!!!
there’s kids that are homeless and jakes sittin here like:
Y’all could have chose someone, ANYONE else to be a millionaire... and you chose this man!?
woodley
Kamaru Usman
Nate Diaz
Nobody likes jake paul

He said 65 million was GENERATED.  Thats his cut after paying everybody off lmao
I mean im proud of this guy.
You I debt....badly. ..smh
Jake paul should fight charlie Z
Why should anyone care
Good job you beat Steve Carrel the 40 year old virgin
That’s a lot of $1’s for a fixed fight. Retire me next.
God I hope Mayweather fights you one day
Wow, Logan's little brother looks like he's going through a real tough time
Who should you retire next? Maybe your inflated ego.
bet those are usher bucks
HERB
flexin wit 1's
man said 65 million dollars and shows us a bag filled with $1 bills, you might have generated $65 million but probably only earned 1% of what you generated u jokeman
Did you know that jake is acually a 6 years old with a 24 years old body
Logan's little bro got more singles than the dollar menu.
What song did he used in background?
damn he got the bag 💯🔥🔥🔥
Pls
Hope you fight a real Boxer one day
Hi Jake✌️ Give me 0.1% of thats money😂 Its more than enough for  me.... 😂😂
Im a fan bro but i saw 1 100 and rest ones so thats like 300 if anything right there
Really flexin that brain damage ya claim you have.
Your the best i will always soport you
Wit a bag full of 1's and haven't even fought anyone worthy to be bragging about. How about fighting someone who isn't out of shape and over weight 😂
What are you a valet or a stripper? Who dumps a sack of one dollar bills
Maxed out
That just all 1s ....  ?😑😐
mans really made it huh
What happens when you fight your Dad...
They're all fuc*in one's  Conor mcgrgor called it
All that money and internet fame can't bring you happiness
Those were all 1s 😂😂😂😂
Retire yourself fool
Dude quit smoking crack
Ebic :DDDD
You need to call your landscapers
The chap is a dope
"Who should I retire next?"  Yourself.
Wow that's alot off $1bill you've got in your handbag 👜
Come on boys we gotta find out who asked

Damn man, did you rob a kids lemonade stand? Big flex on a man who can't win an actual fight.
Clown

Ive never seen a man look so sad and radiate this much loneliness in 1 video
chleba
It's....... It's just $1s....... It's........
Jake paul picks on retired 40 year old newbie boxers, he won't last in a mma fight
What’s the point of this video? Genuine question
Fight a real fighter. That one dude said he whooped your ass in a sparring match and you only paid him 150 out of the 300 you said you’d pay him. Guess those 10 dollar an hr genes still run strong in you. Fight someone real you nerd.
Jake : today I broke my both piggybanks..
Thats just $1 bills
Wow....1 dollars....
When you take all your monopoly money when become 13
White ppl talking about humble beginnings makes me laugh
So now fight an actual boxer,quit chasing UFC guys and fight someone who actually boxes and see if you got it.Impressive right hand for sure and you got it down so now punch upward and challenge yourself with a fighter
All I see is 1’s 😂😂😂
im sure he needs that 65 million and there is no better use for that money other than gucci bags to carry money so he can flex
0.:05 there is a $100 bill.
Flex
How much did askren get paid to lose?
If this guy wants to make a name for himself he should be calling out one of the top 15 boxers. Imagine what Derek chisora or deontay wilder would do to him lol
😐
When rich kids empty their piggy bank
What’s the song called?
i have normal job and help people. whats your super power?  pours out 1$ bills "flexing"   XD
Fight Sean o’malley
People talking about the 1s forgetting he just made 1.69mil and y’all on ya moms wifi
20.5 million sheep sub'd....WOW... GG human race
Phony...all $1bills...Jake is still a liar!
Ahh i and watched it for free..
All those 1’s 🥵

Share Your money with me Venmo @AndyS5
It's just the way he is sitting on the grass so proud of the 1's he is holding... Reminds me of my childhood after a few days of work
Pro boxer nah man your just hyping yourself up and wanting to get clout but it ain't working and still dodging the good fighters and jake Paul all those wins are from rookie fighters or a ex fat UFC fighter who wasn't even that good
Chleba
Money  is your god 💀💀
fight an actual boxer then you can call yourself a winner
Jake Paul vs Khabib
Fight a real boxer
When he start tryna use words like generated
What a joke
what I shared with you
on this video
Hahahaha! Your fucking cool!!! 🤷🏼‍♂️🍀👌🥂
Jesus is  alive
He keeps looking at the 1s like' who tf put 1s in here man I'm tryna flex here'
So it’s cool Flex jake Paul
retired me babyyyyy
So I think you should fight someone who’s serious about boxing
Man I really thought he was gonna flex 💪 but all I got was just one dollar bills coming out.
Is our country full of these goobers?
Jake can actually fight proud of you Jake !
No one, like no one in Ireland likes you mate
When is this guy gonna fight an actual boxer?
Jack f*** up DC for us😂😂😂
1.3 million of you bought that trash lol
And this whole video shows that all he cares about is money nothing else
around $350 cash lol
To be honest we all thought Jake was going to lose his fight but he honestly surprised us all and I was rooting for him we all said he was trash but look what he ended up being😌
Jake Paul vs Charlie Zelenoff
I wonder if this guy has any real friends, or people that like him because of his money
THE  fucking line every time , " I used to landscape for 10 $ an hour " . XD
That looks like maybe 4K. 📸😟
His iPhone autocorrected and changed ‘cents’ to ‘DALlARS’
Stop being a bully fight a real boxer even a C class one
Faze Temperr  challenged you for a fight in Instagram .....
Couldn’t find one nice comment so congratulations on the win jake
Co to kurva je?
I apologize youre actually accomplishing every americans dream keep going and on your journey god bless. Easy to forget a celebrity is a human being especially in sports everyone wants a rooting interest but you worked for everything you have so god bless man all the power to you. Saw the impaulsive podcast and have a completely different perspective.. you seem like a really chill person and i wish you continued success in life.
Who is this guy and what does he do?
40seconds refund plz
I only subscribed to u to dislike your videos
That fucking belt is trash
Aur jake bhai ki haal chal ( how are you ) 65 milllion dollars oh ho. Kya karoge achaar daloge lao mujhe dedo just joking.
This guy is SO MUCH CRINGE  😬
Yo paul looks like you can buy the like botton
I’m starting to think Jake does dumb stuff like flex one dollar bills on purpose to generate 65 million haters to keep up with his problem child persona. Jakey boy, one day you’re gonna out-problem your problem, child!
If you got 10,000 to spare I would be totally grateful 🤍
Get me an Iphone jake! I'm from ph
Gay
Jake Paul has no brain cells
Time for a real fight. Call out Julian Lane. Former UFC tuf fighter (Let me bang Bro) and current bare knuckle boxer. He is from Mansfield Ohio. It can be the battle of Ohio boys. I know for a fact he will fight you.
lots of dollar bills lol
All 1 dollars
Yo jake. Go fight george zimmerman.
But how much you got
Pov: all you’re friends hang out with you for cash and you’re nothing
Yall talking about how he’s flexing ones but we obviously know he has money, his literally sitting in front on his mansion lmao 😂
Jake has officially challenged Terrance Floyd, George Floyd’s brother. Shameful!
Is he really that dumb to make a video about millions of dollars made by showing about $100 dollars in 1 dollar bills? 🤣🤣🤣 he has to have that brain damage cte or whatever
TOMMY FURY!
You didn’t retire him. He was always retired lol.
Wow, flexing with a bunch of $1 bills, I'm impressed
Jake give a brudda a shoutout
And you are famous for being what?
He got peanuts from the actual amount he generated 😒
All $1s same
wonder what hell do with all those ones  lol
please stay smart my guy, no drugs.. just hunnys and fashion
give me 1 mil
next time try to get some 100s in there
Song??
for y’all saying all 1’s he could most definently retire your whole family for one two the money comes in a check
E
youre flexing 1 dollar bills?
Am I the only one who heard Connor McGregor say “These are all fockin ones” before the Mayweather fight??
Shake ya ass, watch yoself....  Is that what was playin when you made them $1's
🇺🇸
There you go ☮️🐕🐾💪💪💪
Your broke flexing 1s😭
This is straight CAP
This nigga went from the Disney phase to the vine phase to the youtube phase to the doing music video phase and now to the 'boxing' phase
what’s the song called that’s playing in the background
Flex? HA!... bitch that’s like $500 in $1s go get you some $100s then make a new video.
Jake you gotta stop fighting I’m tired of calling you garbage and then watching you beat the Mf I was routing for
1s lmao🇺🇸
These are all 1$ lol 😂
Nah he spent his money already. Thats money he borrowed from his momma daddy😂😂
You should fight Ryan Garcia that would be a good fight
Their all 1s lol
wow I used to watch you on vine now ur rich rich
Imagine being this humble. Generating 65 million and only asking for 1.5 % of it.
Jake Paul can you put me in retirement
You  are slick
WHY IS THIS HOMELESS GUY FLEXING HIS MONTHLY INCOME IN 1 DOLLAR BILLS INFRONT OF SOMEONE'S LAWN?
Very humble
I’d like to see Jake in reality with the Guards he feels his tough ass needs we thought fosey was bad look at Jake trying to make his fame quick idk why people even support this man it’s like giving change to an old organization you know doesn’t exist
Bruh tryna flex on me with 1s while I'm sitting at the house with whole Benjamin frankllin with Abraham Lincoln and some Andrew jackson in my wallet lol.
ill just ask that you do right, give to the kids that need what you have. that's fair.
1 dollar bills yikes
Who should you retire next? Maybe 65 people
Won me over
Flexing on the people who gave him money
That triller belt hands down is the stupidest fucking thing I’ve ever had to lay my eyes on
Wow Jake you used to work as a landscaper you really came from the bottom huh 🙄
Anyone notice this idiot picks fights with people more than 10 years his age?  His last 2 fights were both againts 36 years olds LMAO
"Dallers"
Those are usher bills
Gay🤑
Bro you are flexing 1 dollar bills after boxing a bunch of nobody’s and u call yourself the future of boxing like stfu
Smart marketing. He knows people are gonna troll about the ones...  Uno reverse card.   That's why he is a marketing major before anything else.
Paul vs Mike B Jordan.... ps want some credit for this thought.  It's the fight to make !!...maybe give me some tickets??
I thought this guy was dead , bummer

Jake paul I want you to fight The Rock/Dwayne Johnson or Conor McGregor to see if you actually are tuff as you say you are I'm betting you are the one to retire
Who will you fight  next  🧐
That's probably his prophet after taxes court fees and attorney fees.
Jake, I would like to say sorry for the loss of ur bodyguard (SHADOW ).. losing loved ones is the toughest thing a person could deal with when ur also dealing everything else u have going on..but on the other hand CONGRATS on winning the fight.. I would love to see Nate Diaz vs Jake Paul next, stay Strong, & HUMBLE my friend..
let’s go Jake paul
Fight tommy fury next 🥊🥊
All 1s tho bro
BRB y’all, going to go make a video on gold spray painted grass with TWICE the amount of 1’s coming out of a purse. Gonna be epic, video coming soon!!!
Man that fight must have really knocked a screw loose. Cause he's really bad at math
goals
._.
How much did you pay for the win? Running outta content ideas so u just wanna make money off promotions and pay them to take a dive
Guys is punk
"LOOK DADDY, LOOK 😃!! I beat up a You Tuber, a basketball player, and a wrestler, I'M THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!" Get this clown the f*** outta here 🙄
We all know That’s your allowance 🤦🏻‍♂️  Floyd prob weak af 😂
And y’all still giving him attention
I genuinely like Jake paul.....he could get over board sometimes but hes an alright guy
1 dollar bills....
good for you, wish i could just afford all of my bills, i think im going to make a video of my kids wife and i dumping ramen out of a trash bag while saying dinner bitches
HE NEVER TAKES Ls!!!!
Hey i would knock the fuck out of you if you go down to 170 pounds...thats the most i want to grow haha im 160 pounds 5'10 amateur boxer.
Well done Jake well deserved, many MMA fans I’ve been sticking up for you against them and you proved me right the other day, they all went quiet when you KO’d Ben, I told them you had good boxing ability but they just laughed at you, they ain’t laughing much today are they!
Throwing money around as it's an excuse to just have s** with someone's face
he retired someone who was already retired. 🤔🤷‍♂️
BRO WHAT SONG IS THIS
Cool, who asked though
That's $100.  Fight a real boxer pussy!  Or step inside an MMA octagon.
Why u stealing yo grandmas purse? 👛 👵
the guys fought Two non title fights and thinks he's the world champion... sounds like Hercule from DBZ.
0:10 Lmao that mickey mouse smile tho
0:22 yourself
THIS IS CRINGE ALSO ALL THE 1 DOLLAR BULLS LMAOOOAOOAOAOO
wow $1 bills I am so impressed
Mans is depressed. He’s covering a lot. He’s empty.
Who should I retire next? Lol bro all you fight is retired people
Can I have 1 dolla
Going blind with four kids help me out big dog
Ur my idol thanks for whooping askten
Why sitting on the grass tho?
The Gucci bag is worth more than the “cash” he dumped out! 😂
fight tommy fury smh
1 dollar bills 💀😂
CAN THEY PLEASE ADD A BLOCK BOTTOM ON HERE PLEASE
Money and fame can’t but he’s still unhappy.
While everyone is mention they are just 1 dollar bills. What I’m thinking is “hey he pays his landscaping people, good for him!”
He's flexing with those Washington's.
Get this poor guy some friends
Still a queef
They are all one dollar bills… Take a screenshot zoom in on them
'Dollar dollar bill is all'
I told him
The validation this guy needs 24/7...
Most of those are dollars smarty
My step dad says he wants to beat you up for a million bet bet
Mike tyson
lol all I see are singles
You want to make 100 million fight Mike Tyson, I dare you.
the only 65 million generated thing there is the chance of that one beard hair
Whats the song in the video
Eyyy bro, you love tapped an out of shape boxer who didn't even try. You're never gonna be a real boxer fam lmao.
Money can never buy you happiness
It's okay to be proud but to be overconfident like you are. My man, rather try to be more humble and just thank your fans instead of being focused on the money.   Chasing money - someone like The Notorious Conor McGregor will take all of that away from you easily.
All I saw was  1 dollar bills.
How them Washington's
Lets go jake. The boxing world is waiting for you. You got this big G.
That’s a bunch of $1 Bills
Retire next? You only fight people that are already retired.
200 1’s?
bro these are 1s
What song is that?
Jesus Christ loves you soooo much
POV it’s the second tony lopez
What’s the name of the song ?
“I used to work a normal job so ima flex on y’all”😭😭😭😭
So nobody's going to talk about how Jake just gained 100k subs
Nobody gonna realize that Jake actually just gained 100k Subscribers
Who is flexing with those ones? Whaat the heck are those?
That’s like $60 in 1’s
why they all 1’s jake?
Welp,nobody cares
People say there is 1s but yall cant forget about his bank numbers
I'd retire your punkass
He looks like he isn't even proud he just beat up an old out of shape dude. And yah, he really shouldn't be lol
Inbox me punk
When it's all ones...
"It's easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle then for a Rich man to enter the kingdom of God"
Who is Win just saw you tubers just flex off the money
Tfue look alike
why is he still relevant why didn't he fall off with his brother
Laughing with all that money but it won’t get you to heaven
Mike Tyson wants another exhibition match , call him out 👀👀👀 see if you can retire him 😂😂
So who’s next Jake Paul?? Conner?
Looks like you only got 1000$ for the fight lol, those mfs all ones
Are you like... ok dude? You seem pretty sad.
What has a man gained if you gain the whole world n lose your soul?
You where on tv now praprotcy love you jake
I'm from dosney
Disney channel send me
Lmfao congratulations ily from disney
fight Francis Ngannou
Now fight an actual boxer Jake
Fight Josh Brueckner.
Me after easter or halloween:
Those are all 1 dollar Bill's lmao, no one realised
hey, go to the bank and get 500 $1 bills.  I gotta show off the money I made because I need validation from everyone on the tube.
What is that your prize purse full of $1's from the fight HAHAHAHAHA
Sweet we won’t be homeless anymore 😃
I feel like he's the 1% of germs still around after you just got done cleaning
So, nobody gonna talk about how nearly all his fights been against old people who haven’t fought in years
That’s for sure just left overs from the strip club
Yo can I borrow a buck?
I guess if I took my 9 grand out my safe and got all singles it would look $65 mil too....what a jackass.
Cut your grass dawg...your s**t too long
Wow... It's almost like I give a fuck
All ones lol
The guy is rich as fuck but he's flexing with 1 dollar notes
what a douche lol
If we could define our entire generation in one video this would be it
Mabe next time make it look more like millions of dollars by putting a lot of 1$ bills under a 100$ bill and put a band around it because you just dumped like 30 or 40$ in ones lol
Never have I wanted communism until now
Can we talk SA allegations????
Okay.
You gonna fight a boxer that isn't 20 years your senior?
Knockout Mcgregor, Floyd, or better yet Ryan Garcia then people will start listening.
This guy is a tool who boxed an old, washed up wrestler.  He is rich, but he is still a tool.
This guy could buy almost everything at the Dollar store With that bag.
His next fight is against a 14 year old boxer.
Clown!!!! Those are ALL $1.00 bills. What a joke.
This is a violation on George Washingtonn
Lmao all 1s
So you won against a YouTuber, a basketball player and 2 retired fighters. Maybe you should try.. I dunno, fighting someone that is an actual boxer that you didn’t pull out of retirement. You have nothing to be boastful for.
Whole lotta 1s
Showing off is a fool’s idea of glory. -Bruce Lee
Lol
nice bag of ONES
Imagine flexing by showing your cash
Ok jake
Seeesh
My man why wont you invite pacquiao, he's almost same size as you...
He looks like a cool 6th grader.
Lotta ones
This man says he used to landscape for $10 an hours meanwhile i worked in a kitchen for £6.45😭😭   And I consider myself privileged compared to what other people have to deal with just to get by
65 million generated ... 50 million well spent in a night and 15 million profit 😏
POV: you just knocked out a fat 40 year old retired fighter with 12 surgeries, now you’re the best
bro lets put homeless ppl or broke college students in the ring that would change lives 🤭
Did you win the fight
W JAKE
bro was crying cuz he beat a 40 year old retired fighter that was there for the money ._.
You flex them 1s bro, youre worth it       $1 I mean
I remember when you used to say put your Vlog belts on 😭😭😭
Did Floyd let you borrow his necklaces for that shot
100 bill, and a bunch of 1's........why you gonna flex on the little girl next door with the lemonade stand like that bruh
Why won’t you get in the octagon? You’re expecting MMA fighters to box. You should box an MMA fighter and then have a fight in the octagon a few months later
Must be nice. I wish you the best.
LMFAOOOO ALL THAT MADE FOR SET UP FIGHT LMAOOO EVERYTHING IS STAGED
Congrats, you have a bunch of 1dollar bills....... hey I've got those too.   Idiot.
F yaw haters go JP
You should be thankful to all the parents of all the children!
What cut is he getting from the 65mil
Why are they all 1’s.???
$65 dollar generator
I can only see one note of 100 .....rest are one dollar bills....thank you for showing ur 65m generation
Niceeeee bearddd
i was like "what a douche bag" But i done plumbing for 8 dollars a hour so when he said he did landscaping for 10 i felt that lmao id feel the same way i would hope to be more humble though.
Vamona fajarno punto. Dime donde y cuando
They are all 1 dollars I slowed it down
Song name ?
why is this video on trending?
WHATS UP GUYS IM JAKE PAUL AND THIS IS IN YOUR FACE!   remember that jake???
Guess what, hes gonna lose it all when he dies, which could be at any moment. Look at this simp to money.
So the vid is about showing off his money you haven’t even fight a real boxer dumb
Nobody believes that was a legit fight. Lmao it was silly trash, per usual. 😂💩🤡
He seems so sad and lonely 😞
That fight was a joke.
“Some people are so poor, all they have is money”- Bob Marley
65million dollars in 1s😆🤧
Nice 1's man.
Buy safemoon now make millions
Pho ken knee gear
He thinks he's still relevant lmao
Ew Jake Paul
‘Reo cragun - Maxed out’ - is the song BTW
Fool u broke trying to flex with a bunch of ones lmfao was that ur cut u just poured out 🤣
Lol that's probably about 620 bucks
The strip club $1 bag.
Imagine if the wind blew
Oh wow you got a bunch of ones, you could show me one million in hundreds and I still wouldn’t give a fuck.
Is that the wages for your crew you pay? You should thank Ben for selling that fight
Fancy lending me 10k
AOJ 's Jacob and telling you give me some of that money bro I want some of that broad money you know of saying
Who lets this kid challenge LeBron James to a boxing match ?  For the crown of Ohio you must go through Stipe first my son.
You should jump on that YouTube v TikTok event that would be pretty sick cus why do I think 1 of them would give you more of a challenge than Nate gib and Ben😅
You’ll be a landscaper if you go against Fury😂😂
all 1s lmfao
I feel bad for all the children you've brainwashed into thinking that you're a good person
After you showing your money like this when you dam well ppl all over are broke losing there houses .  Rich ass ppl like this make me sick
You’re the best
And hopefully one day you see this
You are always the best
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😅😊
And for me you’re still the best
I grew up watching you and Jake Paul
Go Jake Paul Go Jake Paul Go Jake Paul
And still, your insecurity echoes all the way to that house you cut grass
Save the world with that money ☹️ one person doesn’t need all that.
I feel sorry for Jake....
Still a POS I see, making clickbait for all the kiddies
Jake Paul we next 👊🏽👊🏽 u need a real match I see 💯🩸

That money getting to his bleached head.  Nothing but 1s homie tf
chleba
How about you do some good with that money and help out some people that could use some to get out of debt or something!!
Até eu que não sei boxe se eu treinar uns 2 meses lhe encho de pancada.
Has he addressed the sexual assault allegations?
All the money but cant give me a dollar so sad
Fight Pacquiao next!
Who should I retire next dude was already retired 🤣

If you held a landscaping job for 6 months bro then started to make YouTube videos i wouldn't really flex that you had a normal persons job.
The guy may be hated by everyone but he is STYLIN
Hey but he still beat ben askren
Big L
You flex jake with your 1s
i miss the old u -
Can you go back to be in a YouTube or Jake Paul I’d like to go to be a YouTube or I mean when you fight is still good with like please we miss you
When they are all ones
“Who should I retire next” bruh he was literally already retired. You fought a retired guy.
This kid just got 65 million dollars for beating someone up for two minutes
Whoever paid for that got jacked LOL
Do you want a real fight heres some conor mcgregor or israel the last style bender
Anyone else heard the greys anatomy intro in the vid?
I got that many 1s sitting in my bank as well!
Retire yourself please
Should rename this to: Flexing $200 worth of $1 Ft. 1 $100 bill
Bro i make more then that on my weekly paycheck
Fun fact: he now has 65 million ones
This is what the world has come to! Do you something useful with your money and those in need.
CAN I get sum
Clown
Get in there Jake 👊
So everyone knows they all ones. Why flex at all
Go ahead take on Connor McGregor I DARE you you won't last long at all he will wipe the floor with you,he will absolutely destroy you in the ring and you will finally shut up

Your a beautiful soul 💪🏽 you have to put me on.  Write a book or mentor me 🤦🏽‍♂️
"There are few things more dishonorable than misleading the young" -Thomas Sowell
He is clearly the alpha male
🤡
1s for days hahahah
Let’s go baby
Since you say you wanna retire somebody want to use if you retire Mike Tyson I bet you that will be the shortest fight ever
Who should I retire next. Idk a boxer maybe.
We'll see how much of the money and luxury you got will take with you... You might leave a legacy behind big or small but that's until the people who know you, are dead too and their children also...
Fight a real amateur boxer!
Ksi’s name in Tommy’s vid already has more views than this 😂
U should prolly retire that joe from McDonald next
You should do the YouTubers vs tik tokers
Yeah man flexin a thousand ones 🤣
So 2 bands and $200 in 1's is 55 million? lmao
Just a little more authenticity and less pride, he’ll be alright. Hopefully he finds his lane before he loses, because he’s setting himself up to crash and burn
Why trending?

I literally only saw one or two $100 bills everything else was just ones.
Money on the outside empty on the inside
Question, how come you guys keep calling out non boxers?
There is barely 1000 dollar mate
Nice jake. Congrats on being selfish. Maybe donate it or something. Learn selflessness for a change
I still landscape for that
so cool😐
Who got more money mr beast or jake Paul
White people 😐
This fool is a living embarrassment
Fight Adrien broner
God now you will never shut up will You ?
Man fight a real boxer
Let him fight Evander Holyfield, he coming back to fight exhibition. Let him knock Jake Paul out. 😂😂💯
People are dying in poverty the world over. This is beyond vulgar.
He was already retired 😂
😂😂😂😂👻👻👻👻
ayo give me 1 milli atleast
It’s time to train with khabib
It’s time to train with khabib
It’s time to train with khabib !
Disrespecting tyron Woodley because he had a bunch of people around him look what t wood did to jay heiron look what he did to koscheck , like I said jake paul took Ben askren because he knew that his weakest point was his striking, Ben's an amazing wrestler and his grittyness has won him all the fights he won , Jake paul is a overpaid youtuber with cringy content , hosting a cringy event where hes getting 17 year old tik  tok girls to put a belt around his waist lol
"Who should I retire next?" Maybe an actual professional boxer
Ben got scammed
He landscaped for 2 weeks and quit 😂
Hey fight Chris Lytle..I talked with him and he is willing to fight you
All the 12hr olds defending the deity
so much loneliness in that face. help him out
Look at this clown 🤡
I'm 58. Come get your whooping problem child. I see you lay face down in 3.
POV: those are all $1
I like they are 1 all that would be 10000
$500.000🤪🤪🤪🥶🥶🥶 congratulations on your fight
Jake I would love you to play rugby please 💯🤟🏽
Idol nice fight knocking Ben ,I think I'm excited to watch you fighting canelo...
They're all ones tho 💀this some hard cap
I got the same amount of ones in my bag, what’s the fuckin flex 😭
Fight me bro  I bet you won’t
can i have it pls i am a big fan
Stop fighting nobodies
Stfu before ya get your chains took
shave your beard
shave your beard
Suggestions for next opponent: Hafþór Björnsson (the Worlds strongest man, who is now doing boxing) or Nikita "White Chocolate" Ababiy (could perhaps be marketed as The Clone Wars).
I'm a simple man I click on Jake's video I dislike it.
I think I liked him better when he was payed to be someone else.
Palm Angles Cap new season link in bio
Calls himself a boxer yet doesn’t fight boxers
Imagine that feeling bro is relaxing
Brain damage
I watched the fight for free and I feel robbed
Jake gained subscribers
This is like 69 or something this is just 1s
Jake :D Chleba :D :D :D  mahaha
Jake paul vs Spence or crawford!!!! who wants to see!!!  Let jake paul retire spence and Terrence!!! You can do this jake!!! Dedication and determination this is like anime shiitt!!!I forgot what kind of anime but its all about that.
Good for him, wish when I’m 24 I can be a millionaire, living my best life unbothered by all you haters, have the whole world talking down on me and just continuing to prove all y’all wrong. Id rather be jake Paul then any of u pathetic haters.
Всем руско понимающийм привет 😂
Tomy Fury
1s tho...
God I hope this dude fights an actual fighter so badly
We aint strips
Why does he sound kinda sad lol
He was already retired.. fight a real boxer bud.
Money can’t buy company LMAO stay lonely jake p
The world wants to know how much you paid Askren to loose. Shut your big mouth. Fight a real boxer. Then talk. Until then. Do one.
Sholdnt you be giving that to Ben😐😐😐
Jake Paul is awesome, prove me wrong
Before anyone attacks me im just saying that I even said this before he fought ben askrin. I said he should fight a real boxer who has boxed unlike ben who did everything else but box. I always knew ben wasnt serious about this fight and fair to Jake Paul like it was kinda obvious Ben was going to loose lmao.
Like to see Jake Paul vs Floyd Mayweather
Anyone know the song?
First off - fair play to Jake Paul for generating $$ for his own fights. Kudos to him. BUT even though he beat askren (an old, retired wrestler who had hip surgery), his performance was weak and his punches are really slow for his weight class. Any decent amateur in his weight class or slightly smaller would drop him. Can he please fight an actual boxer for once.
what’s this song please
Would love to watch more youtubers fight. Like imagine James Charles and jefree star fighting it out
Retire Nate diaz
There are 1$
I still landscape lol, keep doing what you like man. Way too many people taking that trash talk to serious.
He sounds like trump
what song is this
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The cringiest dude on the planet
Its a shame your mom will only let you have 100 of it. I'd be moving out.
When a crackhead tries to become rich.
That is like 500$
You are phony jake
Bring back old Jake Paul  With the comedy vlogs 😔😔
*ok and*
HOW
name of the song
Why y'all so mad for he obviously knows it's all one's he's doing it dokey to make y'all made🤣🤣
You’re a douche. The children that feed your garbage content will eventually mature and realize how awful you are.
Regardless whether Jake Paul wins or loses the disklike rate increases
I used to be unsatisfied with materialistic things even relationships, but then I knew Jesus, my wish is for you Jake to know Jesus and have everlasting peace and true fulfillment, love you brother
Why did he use 1s?  I mean is there a secret joke here or is he really flexing with 1s?
Song???
You never landscaped. You were spoiled at a young age. It reflects and shows who you truly are as an adult. The term is known as “man child”
Imma flex on y’all he says. We give him money. He flexes on us for it. Be grateful
Before fighting Ben Askren: 10% dislike   After fighting Ben Askren: _20% dislike_
Hey Jake Paul water paper view buys
Imagine thinking that having a bunch of money will help make you a better person or get people with brains to like you.
Fight Yoel Romaro
How do people fall for this putz?Make it rain on a budget $1 wow!
There 100
Jake Paul vs Jackie Chan
And he can’t give war series 1 dollar
He’s got a total of 23,456$ dollars there, what a shame
Ok
How much money will it be when you’re convicted of sexual assault and she sues in civil court?
Yo get a life
what would give someone the urge to do this?
Much humble
He couldn’t get the YouTube one so he got the thriller McDonald’s one
What a bratt , you beat a retired old wrestler coming out of a hip surgery
How did jake paul come from disney channel to a boxer that's a big spender thinking hes cool.
1 doll 😂😂😂😂
Why are they all ones?

Leftovers from the strip club i seee you Jake 😎🔥

Blahozelam
Jake Paul is a master marketer. Look how many comments he got by using $1's....
The people that liked this 🤦‍♂️
Remember this comment. Imma comebon future. Saying i am generating more than that
okay, but for real, when are you going to own up to your sexual assault allegations? this is pathetic at this point
With a bag full of one dollar bills I'd be able to afford theater candy and popcorn at the same time.
Better use this to pay your taxes
That was like $200 in ones.....
The rich get richer
Used to landscape and look at that lawn... 😆 Try Mike Tyson.
I need money what you all ever do for poor people . Y'all are a bunch of posers.
That’s a lot of 1’s

Let me hold a dollah
Sheshhhh man got 100 dollars 🥶🥶🥶🥶 nigga there all 1dollars bozo 😹😹👎👎👎

Fight a boxer !!  Someone with a decent record in the game (8-2) for example  Quit fighting wrestlers and basketball stars
Lol all these haters hope of him let him be him
Me: *watches video* Also me: *dies*
That's the worst internet flex I've ever seen. I generated 65 million bucks, but all I got was like 4 grand in this little bag
Why and how does he have 20 mill subs??
Why do I have second hand embarrassment?
Why was this recommended to me somethings wrong
Y wud u post 1’s and u generated millions SMMFH DUMMY
I doubt all these fights ......All a build up to get a big pay per view. Fools and their money are easily separated
Bruh I live for this comment section
I’m a fan again
Sir. I know what a $1 looks like
Boxing has the potential with the right promotion to generate way more money for the athlete then any other sport period. Floyd mayweather proved it hes worth more then lebron or just as much without any endorsements.
Whatever I have taken more to the club
Retire Amanda nunes!
Can I fight you for a lil bit of money so I can start a business, I got I  ideas to make the rest of my family never work again! Holla ✌🏽😅
Can you retire
He's so easy to dislike  It's effortless
WHY HAVE YOU DISAPPEARED THOUGH THE FANS EVEN THE HATERS ARE WAITING FOR WHAT'S NEXT
Ppl in comments didn't watched the podcast
JOKE PAUL!!!!!
Why does he look sad
Why do I have you in my recommended? Gtfo
Stfu fight a real fighter then flex
Haterz
Everyone clowning him for having 1’s but when you guys are able to drop out money like that just like he is then go scramble for those 1ms
Bruh he always talks about how much money he has but he can’t even afford to hire a crew to mow his lawn and pull the weeds lmao 😂
Did he come back from stripping ? That fight was a whole joke. Glad i only saw it on youtube lol

Lol, people aren't so happy in the comments, but I mean he made a lot of money on this event. Give him credit.
He probably just picked it off the strip club floor when the strippers were twerking lol
“I used to landscape” yard full of weeds 🥴
Strip club left overs lmao
Such a humble man
I think you over exaggerated how much we actually care 😕🤭😐
When are you going to to fight a real boxer. Until you do I'm out.
no way you won 65m on that dumbass fight
👁👄👁
I know he’s wealthy bud dude was showing off $1000

Yo Jake! Can I have "One"                                               ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Everyone in the comment section that say you only have ones in your bag and that's hilarious but more importantly you need to get Off the grass and in the front of whoever's house you're sitting in front  of before the sprinklers come on and they sick the dogs on you broski 😆🙌
Have fun and live your life! Ohio in the building!
You’re a clown.
Chleba
He said 65 million dollars. THATS 65 MILLION 1 dollar bills Jesus Christ bro people being dumb.
Giving that money for homellesman
That looks like it equals about $200
All I see is a lonely man in the video , y'all have to admit the video gives out lonely vibes
Get it ig with all your 1 dollar bills 🤡🤡🤡
Fixed fight
Please do me a favour and retire yourself.
$65 million...  flexes $850 in ones...  cool
there are some people in the world who’s children eat gravel because they can’t afford food meanwhile this idiot is showing all his money off this is disgusting behavior and i’m deeply disturbed and disappointed
HE WAS ALREADY RETIRED LLOOLLL, HED JUST HAD HIS HIP REPLACED LOLOLOLOL
1 dollar bills lets go
Jake paul’s next opponent: a 70 year old retired pediatrician with a broken hip
You should donate it to charity.
Here to dislike, report and delete from watch history
400k gap
“Omg i had a job once for 6 months when i was in middle school, imma flex now, i know the struggle. Everyone look at me.”
Why is someone watching Grey's Anatomy in the background
We have discovered the most unlikeable person on the entire internet
Jake Paul the type of guy who likes it when his finger breaks through the TP when wiping his ass.
And at the end of the day. Your inner circle wouldnt be with you without your money and persona you put up. But it's your turn to play with the blocks so go for it.
Fucq y’all for making this idiot rich 😐
Oh this song is copyrighted
Maybe retire a contender instead of bringing guys out of retirement. I'd like to see him fight the guy who made videos of him sucker punching people, and claim to be the undisputed champion. I forget the dudes name.
65 million generated and this bag of $1s was my cut....
Fight a professional boxer lol
Man most of us out here never gunna be rich enjoy it jake you spoilt bald egg head instead of being a big spoilt baby 👶
imagine flexing with 1 dollar bills
There are all ones
Jake Paul looks like a really expensive   q-tip.
How tf is this even trending?
This Dude Is A Joke 🤡
All the people hating I wanna see get in the ring themselves lmaoooo. You all being toxic asf for what reason???
'who should i retire next' maybe somebody who wasn't already in retirement, let alone a professional boxer...?
That looked like a couple hundred $, in singles.
A Micky mouse belt and1$ bills fight Tommy fury let's see if you got the balls like you say you have
i hope you are giving that to charity
Wow $400 that's impressive
Get in the cage with him you fanny.
I aint mad at him 🤷🏽  Genius marketing tactics  Build that wealth
Why is this man always flexing on the 10 year olds
Steady losing 🤥🤥🤥
Please donate 😭
And you paid 85% of that to make Ben askren take a dive
Congratulations, Jake, you successfully beat the worst boxer in MMA history. Btw, you never landscaped, buddy.
I CALLED IT IN CHAT... AIRRACK SNUCK IN. HA.
Go to the barber first. And then buy a new personality.
whats the point in this guys life?
What an absolute wanker do one jake paul!!!!!!!!!!
He is a millionaire several times over, right?   It is so odd that there were any singles in that bag at all.  Surely he'd recognize it would look silly dumping a bag of ones with a few 100's peeking out - especially given the title of the video and that he'd know he'd get millions of views on it.  Literally go to the bank, pull $50k in 100's, awkwardly dump them out on your lap on the front lawn and then take 'er back to the bank.  What a weird decision.  That's a screw loose.
Fight tommy fury you will generate a lot more than 65 million and prove your worth to the community if you should win due to the fact tommy is following in tysons footsteps in his shadows this would be huge
I counted that was $565 in $1s generated.
All $1 bills bwahahahah
😂🤣
Man I saw it for Free and even I want a refund
LMFAO! You just dumped out a bunch of 1's hahahahahahahahahahaha
Ohhhhhhh tommmmy fury
What a braggart.
Jake stop copying McGregor lol.. U will be u, peice of nuts..
Lol embarrassment to boxing
Canelo vs jake lets make it happen!
song???
Song?
Fight CSI NEXT
Gotta love that pay day from old mate throwing the fight. Whatever gets you paid.
Fr the best part of this video is 0:40
ALL 1'S LMFAO
I was praying it’d be a “this money generated is going to organizations that help people in need” kind of video...
🤬🤬🤬🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Always wanted to have a loui bag loaded with $1's!!!!! Ballin with all that dollar menu money!
trash
"Who should I retire next" means who should I pay to take the fall. Shut the fck up.

fight a real boxer
Yeah just pour out a bunch of 1s nobody will notice. Fuckin tool
Dang he got 50 bucks right there
Guys, of course its all 1's. He spent the hundreds buying everything he owns off stockx resellers.
Nice there 1s
*Morgz is better than Jake now* 😐
$63M or $63?
Why this man pull out 1's
He just killed a 40year old man
Jake won big, illegal streamers won, Ben won sorta, People who paid took the L
65$ million that went to Ben to take the fall
y’all know he assaulted someone right
65 million dollars, doubt
He sond like Michael in gta5
Did my man really put a 2k strap on a bunch of 1’s? You couldn’t fit four straps around two thousand ones.....
The audio sounds like a android from 2005
that was likely less than $100
all those ones right but they add up to 65M show me your 65M? Exactly
Retire yourself
Clown
No offense to a baller, I really appreciate a man who isn't afraid to make his money... But Damn this guy is a straight up jerk and a dork... A jork
Are you there Jake Paul I love your video
What's even the point of this video
lol everyone looking at all the one dollar bills
What a douche!
Hope the wind picks up🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬
Give Ben 5 mill bro
2 bit Floyd mayweather
Song name?
I'll do the fight for free. Keep the money and put it towards your medical bill.
That wasn’t a KO or even a TKO, that was a ref stoppage. In other words a fixed fight. You and Triller are crooks and should be charged for stealing money.
pay me 10 000 :D
So, now that you ‘won’ a fixed fight, you gonna address the assault? And that defamation thing is just cause she said you lasted 20 seconds isn’t it?
ho is your next opponent
All 1 dollar bills this is a joke
let me just sit and stare chile
Lol he flashing 1s 😂 my guy no one cares
One dollar notes!! 🤣🤣🤣 you are a joke in life and in fight..
I think you should fight MVP. Michael Venom Page.
Yo gay
He should fight Oscar dela Hoya
Who cares
How about a amateur fighter
Bruh all ones
I can buy the whole dollar tree store
that in total was most likely $67
What a douche
That is ten dollars 🖤
Make sure Tommy Fury is drug tested for steroids lmao. Smash him bro
HOW CAN YOU BE THIS UNLIKABLE???  Are you even trying at this point???
Jake talking about $65m and those $1 notes be like 👁️👄👁️
he just wants the money
You can start by retiring your brother, then your little shitty "friends" then your Mom, dad, and putting them in an old age home, after that, retire your  cameraman, Retire Tana and erika , tydus, then your career.
1 dollars 😂😂😂😂
Dam jake you have more money than a 5 year old cool
But they’re all 1s
You are a legend
If you want this much money you should get a SAFEMOON ahhaahhaha 😁😁
“Who should I retire next”  How about an actual boxer?
This dude is such a chode
You could have 80 billion dollars and it doesn't change the fact you behave terribly in the public eye. Go get another million for me... you'll love it.
What a weirdo .makes me sick people like this are rich and exist
you demon you absoulute cyber demon go back to your scorched fiery land of hatred,pain and despair
You lucky man
Can I have $100?
Does that make you any less of a douche bag tho?
I walkways wondered what 65 million dollars in cash looked like I think I might have that in my piggy bank!
Man I miss the old jake Paul the one with no tattoos the one on Disney channel the one who didn’t have icy 🥶 on him
Fight Tommy !
Tommy fury
Going to the titi bar next... is 👀

Some ppl are humble and some are assholes. He is neither, he is a joke a dumb joke.
Being poor with no love ones look at this and still seen blessing to Jake paul keep up the good work!!
You should retire Micheal venom page, like that will happen
What r u a stripper?

I hope a strong gust of wind came along after that. 😄
Někdo z Česka?💯😂
Commenting all 1's like if jake doesn't have money
Jake would look a lot better if he didn’t have stupid Mr. T chains on, and was just humble
Jesus is our lord and savior!
Proverbs 16:18 - Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.... Stay humble Jake. It can all be gone tomorrow bro. Much Love and support on your success man. 🙏
JOE WELLER AND THEO MADE HUGE MISTAKE
👉🎙✔. Jake .🍻
All credit to this dude, but with all the guns and whack jobs in the USA, should he be flashing $$ like that?

Nate diaz
Bruh thats like 1000 dollars
Looks like jake got paid more for landscaping than the fight
Beat a youtuber and a wrestler and thinks he's a boxer ☠️😂
Bro thinks he’s cool for beating a man damn near 40 that’s had multiple surgeries, been retired and out of shape, and didn’t care. Go fight a real boxer you little wuss.
Lol jakes next opponent gonna be like a fisherman or an electrician
Is there actually people *asking* for videos like this
SAFEMARS TO THE MOON!! 🚀🌕
That’s maybe like 150 but well done 👍

We need to raise the wage for landscapers...just think if Jake got paid a good wage he'd have stayed landscaping and we wouldn't have to deal with this cancer he keeps coming up with.
You won't step to mayweather
"I'ma flex on the people that got me to where I am by watching my garbage content"

I am proud of you. That was one hell of a knock out. I am sorry to hear about Shadow. I know it must have been tough but you went on with the fight. That’s inspiring, because that is harder to do then half of the stuff that had to be done for the fight.

Дай мне хоч 100$$там возможность заработать
If you seriously think you are ever going to pay to see Jake Paul get knocked out — sorry to break it to you, but you’re a sucker. He simply ripped a page out of Floyd Mayweather’s “Villain$ for Dummies” book and is playing you all straight to the bank.
First and last high ppv buy before you fight an actual boxer or decent striker
Ryan garcia next
askren didn’t train at all he said fuck it i’ll take one punch go down and make a million
Used to landscape for 10 dollars an hour means "one time my dad paid me ten bucks to mow the lawn instead of grounding me"
I want jake to fight Francis Ngannou
started at the bottom....
Hoo sniper wolf is betting u by 9.9 mill subs 😜
If he doesn’t give any of money to charity I’m going to be so angry
Hopefully the next person you face gives you ICU or worse status.

That emptiness that’s still inside you can be filled. Jesus is lord.
Fight Ryan
I see a 100 dollar bill but I see more 1 dollar bills than anything. Hahah...
Soooo was the fight faked
The worst part is us watching him flex is giving him revenue to flex.
Jake Paul do you want to be my friend I’m allergic to haters
Become a Christian believe in god our father read the Bible remember god loves u god loves everyone repent of ur sins to the lord god and share the word of the lord god
I love how it’s just a handful of one dollar bills

Hey Jake, I'd been a window cleaner over 30yrs. It's a skill I will be forever grateful. I've done other jobs over the years as well. Done now unless I have a comeback.😂 Stay Blessed!
I'm 44. Bad hip. Poor shoulders. You wanna fight, fight me. I guarantee I got more than your last bout.
This cat likes to punch dudes in more places than the face.  Ya feel me gummy bear?!

Yo creía en ti pero no creo que me apoyes con unos 500 USD. Estoy pasando un bajón sin Empleo
One
Man really dropped all dollars
It was so cute in the boxing match at the start I heard little tydus yell “U CAN DO THIS JAKE”
My boy jake Paul stfu and fight the greates boxer cánelo Alvarez
Wow. So relatable.
His reputation fell from the every day bro song and now he's on his lawn with a few 1 dollar bills
Damn this world is messed up. If he was someone who was into science and trying to educate people, no one would watch and support him. All he he does is run around making noise and people can't give him their money fast enough.
Dude I still can’t believe Ben quit the fight I laughed hard 😁
I'm going to be honest I was doubtful but   jake has power I'm interested on how far he can go and how much he can push himself
All 1's
Love the chains jake sheesh
Song ?
Fight a real boxer you degenerate
Who's next Jake? RuPaul?
I just see a bunch of 1 dollar bills
First of all, that ain't 55 Mil. Second of all, you ain't retiring nobody's career! You ain't fought  nobody 😜 last of all, you need meds😆
Elon musk: hold my money
All I see are 1s tho
I see 1’s stfu
I think Jake Paul is
So fly 💧 💧
Flex with ones lol the only people you flexing on with those ones is the strippers😂
Jake a dawg 💯

'''Who should i retire next'' this man acting like he wasnt retiring anyway XD
LMAOO all $1
Ehh anyone noticed the bag only mostly had one dollar bills ? Lol

😯😯😯
Sign me jake
Congratulations Jake
🦕
What is that about 250 bucks? Wtf ok 👍🏻
I watched the fight for free on youtube ,it was being streamed live lol
All 1s
How is it to fight a human teddy bear he dies after one hit
He really needs to fight a real boxer
This boy needs to learn how to count. On Instagram it's $75m, the title here says $65m and he actually says $55m 🤔 He should retire himself!
This guy lives in so many peoples heads and i love it 😂😂
Help a restraunt girl out fr. $chloeandruszko

They’re all ones bruv
*Jake Paul flexing 1 dollar bills*   Me: But, who the fuck asked?
Lol  fight me for 100k please
I wonder what is Jake gonna do for all the money for? I mean he got everything he needed to live his life awesome. Maybe can he like become philanthropist in the future as many children and families were hunger to starve and thirst. 🥺🥰
Those dollar bills is all he has left from paying off his opponent...
Can we see him box a real boxer like a current one that isn’t a YouTuber or a retired one
Fight 6ix9ine
Fight a real boxer
he is drip
How about a thank you to the fans for tuning in smh
Cringe🤮
is no one going to mention the fact that all the money is 1 dollar bills? maybe the check hasnt cleared yet.
Is that true? He used to landscape for $10 an hour?
all the people he has fought were already retired though
Hey Jake, try boxing another boxer.
Youre a predator
Weres the $100 bills those are only $1 bills lol sick guy!
"Im gumna flex on yall..." with all 1's booooooiiiiii you got like maybe 1k there 🤣

Bro sweet $1 bills. You all cap

The fight was a setup they just took your money haha all because of hype everyone had to see.... then they snatched that $50 right outta your pocket
Everyone talking about the 1$ bills, that's probably all he had left after the company took its share...
Lolllll 1 dollar bills this guys a joke
If you are reading this comment:💕💕💕💞BE BLESSED!!!   x   1,000,000 !!!!💞💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I know he made bank from the fight but, come on why even post this, I deadass saw one 100 dollar bill and the rest were ones😭
LETS GOOOO BBY  WHAT ABOUT??? JAKE PAUL VS. KEVIN GATES????
All $1 bills he's flagging around how is that 65 million it would cover the whole f****** house f****** idiot f****** stupid video
How about do something good with all the money rather than show off.
He’s obviously just Trolling you guys that’s why he’s using 1 dollar bills. You guys just feed into though
Me after selling my grandmas pills:
I bet he won’t donate at least a cent to some kind of charity....
Lmfao 1 $ bills 🤣
Good to see jake being Humble as usual
Who's next?
Ryan Garcia would knock u out in 10 seconds
Those were almost all $1s, lol
It's all ones dude.  You beat up Dad bod. Fight a real boxer
Gi back to jail
I’m a new fan .

Give me 1mili them

Get that sh*t!
I'll finish you as a small creator
He made under $1M for the fight
Buy doge coin
65 million and thats the belt you get
🧢?
Fight me boy
Killer song choice though.
Imagine if you were humble
retire yourself because your personality is already dead
Jake Paul’s the type of the guy to open an umbrella in the shower
Please bruh I’m in need of some retirement funds
You should choose a challenging fight for once, time to step up in competition or go adventure in another combat sport before people see you as just a guy who picks fights he can definitely win.
He is playing the game right.  taking advantage of the fame. I salute you Jake.
Even the sun shines on a dogs ass some days
he should retire earnie shavers   or, well, atleast try to
Hey you no Jason matthew etheri yes see he my but he says you have hem he can't do nothing bro I do no just say whot he say
But they were ones.....well most of ite
litterally no one cares
Acts as is Ben wasnt already retired.
Let me get a million, Thank you
he sounds like he's in extreme pain
Dude was already retired and had like 60 surgeries done on his back lmao. The thing I’m actually a little happy about is that Jake isn’t gloating as much as he has before.
U can retire me next lol I’m 24 I’ll take the knock for extra 😂
Cheap ass belt doesn't even have a title
Anyone know the song that’s playing ? 😍
IRS: 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
I could Knock jake paul out
Jake I have a question can you shave the beard for memes???
Whats next you going to fight before you choose Nick you will pick some 3 time gold metal in Running in the Olympic lol
Ok but when is he going to fight an actual pro boxer
Dude there no way you could beat me in boxing and im a nobody but you want to box Nick Diaz your a bum bro lol
who asked??
One of the most unlikeable people on youtube, no, in the world.
Looks like around 10k in ones :/
Jake got them fun coupons 🔥🔥
I would beat you up jake
I’ve never wanted someone to get killed so much in my life
Jake, I know who your should retire next: your ego.
I even made money from the fight cause I bet on Jake! We all winning
“Just beat a middle aged man out of his prime” - Jake Paul probably
"Wow Jake you are so cool" Said no one, ever
Can't lie, I better half expected jake to lose, my perspective changed a little leaning towards him winning after watching that problem child "doc" I watched it all on my phone while working and I wasn't disappointed, worth the 50 bucks for sure even if it almost cost me half the days work
Hi
Block me please.  🤢🤮
What happen to  blood shark
gonna flex with a bag full of 1 dollars ? okay then
12k dislikes,12k comments
Mainly ones 🤣 never heard of any of the opponents either, 😴😴😴
“I’m gonna flex on y’all”  Dumps like a hundred bucks in singles 😆  Money aside how do people reach this level of douche bag??? Money can’t buy character. Best of luck to him.
𝔹ℝ𝕠 𝕕𝕠𝕟𝔸𝕥𝕖
Congratulations to you Jake for being your own man regardless of what the public tries to make you into, And proving these naysayers wrong.  Well Done and what a sign  of maturity.👍💰
I smell cap theres no way thats 65 million those are just 1 dollar bills xD
The poor people watching this😢
Why tf does he act like he knows what its like to be through some shh? Hes been in the disney channel his whole life attention hogging lol
“Who should I retire next” bruh only been fighting retired fighters lol
Your flexin 1’s 😂
Jake said that Mayweather is insecure cause he flexes his money.....
Il beat you up for a million?
Most of those were 1s calm down
Next you should complete in a CZW Tournament Of Death
You could pay for my college tuition and still be rich
He got more 1's the Stock X
Who you should retire next you
Mayweather. Fight him if ur truly the best.
I'm a huge MMA fan and I'm diggin what Jake Paul's doin..dude can get that paper.
Jake vs Adam saleh
FIGHT MANNY PAC MAN
Trying to flex with 1 dollar bills 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣
His ego is through the roof for someone that just beat a middle age, fat man with a bad hip. He’s gonna fight someone with actual standup game.
Hahahahaha it's all 1's, he might be going broke.
"I used to landscape for 10$hr" I love flexing when it's paired with inspiration. Thanks Jake for being confident enough to share with us that you weren't always this much of a beast.
Start your old habbits vlogs andddyyy Sherlock paul man come on from me to you
this bum is scared of a real challenge. Jake i bet ya 5 millions dollars u wouldn't last 2 rounds against me u bum
Jake Paul v Dababy. Make it happen.
That fight was the biggest setup in boxing history.  Ben used to get elbowed to the face for a living and when Ben got up the ref called it off strate the way am I the only one who sees that ?????
.                                                                                      f u
If jake wants to be regarded as a good boxer, he can’t fight youtubers and retired athletes for long, I think he’s afraid of loss deep down, but he can’t hide from real boxers if he really wants to get real with this
Stfu bro
show only $100 bills why $1? flex failed
it’s all 1s
This man said “let me flex on you” with $1 dollar bills come on man, at least do it with $100s then you can say your the man. Bro couldn’t keep going with his rapping career cuz he was trash, now he thinks he can box and end MMA/ Boxer career he’s a joke. No wonder he was in Disney channel
all i see is $1s
Wow a video that no one asked for :DDDD
Waste of time tbh
yeah
Nate Diaz  could be a  good oppent  at  least he is taller and has longr arms..
Idiots  paying  to watch an  Idiot  ..  who is no thalf  bad at boxing.. The Problem  is  , he is a poor influence..   for Normal life..
Just leaving my dislike
Retire me lol
Me

Copyright claimed
“I use to landscape for a living” Jake Paul was on disney channel in 2016 which means he was 18/19 years old... Dude acting like he came from poverty, working late night shifts for years to provide for his family when in reality he just had a regular job as a teenager like literally everyone on the planet including celebrities and got into the industry through nepotism and the hard work of his brother 😂☠️
nice! a small bag full of one dollar bills. Good flex!
Hey, you misspelled the word "Scammed" in the title of this video.
Fight Anderson Silva
Your still a punk tho Fight someone your age and size, who has been training boxing for the last two years and see what happens!  You might think your a bad ass for knocking out guys fast, but all it shows is it wasn’t a even match up in the first place.
$1 bills yall 🤣
Take them dollar bills back to your girlfriend, she worked hard at the strip club. Bum ass dude flexing with dollar bills lmao
HA HA
Try Anthony Joshua
why are you in my recommended?get out, the door is down the hall, then take a right
You should buy me a house
Those are just $1
You deserve to flex mans making this kinda money smh damn
this clown probably paid that other dude to be knocked out. no way Jake Paul ap the internet’s biggest clown knocked out someone
Try retiring a person who actualy competes in the sport you are lmao - cant really call yourself a "professional athlete" until then, can you?  At this point you became a more physicaly capable Charlie Zelenoff
I can’t believe you went from Disney channel and being a nice person to being a total jackass it’s sad to see it 😔
dam them disney channel lawns must have been rough huh
Shout out to my boy Major
It’s all ones
Jake......PLEASE, Fight a professional BOXER

Jake Paul Vs Amir Khan
“A corpse should be left well alone”  -Lady Maria of the Astral Clock Tower
Now fight a boxer maybe?
Who should I retire next? Like he didn’t bring Askren out of retirement, gotta hand it to him tho he got that many people to pay for a fight between an ‘influencer’ and a retired wrestler 🤷‍♂️
Man ain't nobody taking him seriously..he Riggs fights to make it look like he just the truth..put him in the ring with tyson
He beat a nba player and a wrestler. Both were outside their prime. He needs to fight a boxer or forever stfu. Or pay me one tenth of what they got and I’ll box you
All $1 bills is $65 million apparently(!)
Try retiring Rosey Palms.
Come on Bill, go back to hell
lmao what a chode
So $1 bills....
Pete davison vs jake paul next
Those are ones bro.
Congrats on your Win
So does this mean he will actually fight an actual boxer now or is he just going to keep fighting washed up former athletes who never boxed....????
TOMMY FURY if you think you can box now.
Canelo👍
Belt looks like it was bought at Toys R Us.
fight billy football
If you paid for this fight you trippin.
Can i have some of that money? I want to buy vbucks.

'HAHAHAHA'  he says BREH ITS  SAD U FIND THIS FUNNY
The leftover money from him paying his way into “professional boxing.”
Fuck it he’s rich and successful let him flex all he wants.
Black youngsta still the hardest flexed I’ve ever seen
What federation is that belt from?
He flexing on his fucking fans for fucksake
Those are ones
And yet are still trying to figure out how to be happy.  Your insecurities really show when you go out and flex you cash on the 13 year olds who follow you.
Y'all need to stop hating on bro. He's winning either way.
all 1's and fighting non boxers and bottom amateurs  hmmm ok cool 🤔🤔
lol all of these comments are negative.... quite the reputation you have here jake, we wanna see you box a REAL boxer

Retire my mom and dad Jake paul!!!
That's like 5 grand because they're ones
And some people have no money to there name or nowhere to live

Very humble omg 😱
🔥🔥🔥

Bro those are 1 dollar bills
Staged 🤢
Andy ruiz Jr
As a german heavyweight I can clearly say: I would knock him out - easily. His boxing skills are silly. He would never have a chance against a professional boxer. Let me fight him in Decembre and his legacy will soon be over.
Nice SINGLES bro! LOL   Good Win the other night; keep it up yo!
The greatest name of all time      Jesus Christ the most loving king to all of mankind came down from his heavenly glory became flesh and died and resurrected from the dead by God to save us from the wages of our sin,so that for whosoever should believe in Him,confess with ur mouth Jesus is Lord,believe with ur ❤️ that he was raised from the dead and would call upon his name would be saved,repent of ur sins and find life in Jesus! Time is short!God bless y’all 🥰♥️♥️
When are you going to fight an actual boxer?
Tommy fury
Mike Myke would light Jake  up. I promise he wouldn't be sitting there acting like that after Mike Myke knocked him the F out!!!!!!!!!
Ben made more money in his dive Saturday night then his whole mma career 🤣
Punkass,  you'll get yours!
Do you mind buying me a tesla with that money please and thanks
Where did you get that speaker from that thing looks strong with the song playing it was going crazy that speaker was lol
Ill take a nice scooter please. 🙄
Trolling the hell out of everyone with the $1 bills 😂
What’s the name of the song
Still waiting for him to fight someone good lol
Cool send me some
That’s how much they made entirely but the money obviously was spread out to pay everyone so Jake Paul made around 675k no 65 million
A real boxer 🤷🏻‍♂️My son’s piggy bank has more one dollar bills than what you just flashed
HEY JAKE, I SUPPORT YOU AS A FIGHTER BUT INSTEAD OF FINDINF NONE BOXERS TO FIGHT AND IF YOU KEEP ASKING HOW MUCH MORE YOU GOTTA PROVE YOURSELF?! ITS UNTIL YOU FIGHT A REAL BOXER!! ITS WHAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE AND THE HATERS TOO! SO SHUT THEM UP AND DO IT!!
Pretty boring fight really...
You should FIGHT DEONTE WILDER NOW THATS A FIGHT ILL PAY TO WATCH💯💯
Congrats Jake 🖤
There’s like $300 in one’s so flex all you want

You need to flex on mental health

flexing 1$ isn’t a flec
GG mate 👍
I really want to go with u one day
Why’s he flexing on us if we gave him that life
He clearly took a dive. I aint NEVER seen someone that happy to lose.
You have to fight Tommy fury and prove you can box
Jake... those are one’s
Like I tweeted, I will fight Paul for the same purse askren got and I'll win.
fight an actual boxer tho lmao
Jake Paul I challenge you. Reply so we can get something started.

What a fight i put money on that give me that money jake
Fight a real fighter
Anyone know the song?
its just ones lmfao he can probably upgrade to fives if he vlogged in the forest
When is this troll going to fight a real striker? He is going to pick a wrestler with no stand up skills at all and then act like he actually accomplished something. Ben probably has the worst stand up skills in all of mma. Go watch some of his fights
No capital gains taxes ! Gotta love living in PR! 🇵🇷

THE GOAT I KNOW YOU WAS A WINNER SINCE 2018

Come to Lake charles, LA and help us rebuild a beautiful community! I’ve only called LC home for the last 3 years after living in Houston for the majority of my life. Lake Charles is now my home and everyone here is struggling after Hurricane Laura then 6 weeks later Hurricane Delta & a couple of months after that a winter storm!
And it all went to paying off the refs

All I wanna say is see what happens when you fight an actual boxer you are gonna lose
The aryan king himself
Jake Paul: 65 MILLION DOLLARS GENERATED  Me: Only sees ones 🤔
The dislike button is beautiful 😍
If you're going flex, at least use some $2 bills

JAKE PAUL the Dadaji Slayer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Let's stop making stupid people famous and rich
😒Bruh you paid off Ben to lose who wouldn't get punched for a milli and then play it off 🤔 watch bens post fight interview he straight up says he was just there for the pay day and that this changes nothing haa 😖 your money can only take you so far what happens when noone wants to fight you anymore because it may shed a bad light on there career, you're literally fighting in YOUR OWN league and paying fighters to lose to you, it's a joke to the real sport of boxing you wouldn't last 2 rounds in the WBA where you can't pay your way to the top.. just facts💯💯
Wow that's only like 500 tops
You’ve already blown the ego filled image you painted yourself as just actually commit to boxing and shut up about it literally everyone knows askren was only in it for the money 🤣 he hadnt put a single ounce of sweat into training to fight you. You just gave him easy money. I need an actual boxer now like fr cause this been a waste of everyones time
Anyone els get bad vibes from the REFS CALL , almost as if it were set up
Bro there’s nothing but ones
I see lots of 1 dollar bills
aint you getting canceled for sexual assault or sum you flexing money should go to your lawyers or sum but okay 🥴
പൊട്ടൻ
Time to box a real boxer Jake!! 👊👊😂😂
Song?
Yes$sssssssssssssssssssssssss
your mum
its no longer Jake "its everyday bro" Paul its Jake "started from the bottom now we here" Paul!!!
What comments are you deleting? The one referencing you “effed” her face without consent? I hope your money buys you out of hell. Let us know
He has more money than I will in 10 life time but why would you make this video with $1 bills haha can’t even take it seriously
FIGHT TOMMY FURY !!!
You have money and you're going to retire one of your workers that messed up
10k Dislike
Are those one dollar bills?
A legend as risen!
Fric  you Jake paul
Congratulations, you fought 2 Youtubers, a retired 5'8" basket ball player and now a retired wrestler with a hip replacement.  You're a joke, no one wanted you to fight Askren, they wanted you to fight someone who isn't going to pad your record.   Tommy Fury or Diaz next.
That's a lot of ones🙄
Now you can box some real boxers bring that peeweeplayhouse ohio trash everywhere you go
Mowing lawns isn't landscaping there bud.
Every money was 1 dollar :DD
You should fight someone next who can actually box. Maybe start there..
When you see like 1 100 in there and most of them are 1s
THERE LIKE FUCKING 3 HUNDREDS IN THERE LMAOOOOOOOOO
There isn’t even enough money in that bag to put tires on that SUV behind you
Why did I think this had something to do with charity.
65 million dollars stolen from niggas that paid to see a 'fight'
Fight brock lesnar or the rock in boxing obvs
Just delete all his videos from ur watch history it’s disappointing plus’s it deletes the view 😏
All 1 dollars
I personally went for Ben but congrats on the fight man. That was a huge hit
Try retire Anthony Joshua, since you are a «proffesional boxer»
Capitalism

Fight a real boxer🗣💀
There all fooking 1’s where’s the real money at
According to J. Richard Gott humanity has a 95% probability of being extinct in 7,800,000 years. Assuming humanity does last till that exact year, did you know if someone from today was sent forward in time to year 7,802,021 they would find to their surprise that nobody fucking asked? Science bitch.
You poured out a bag full of singles.  🤦‍♂️
Jesus is Lord. Jesus is King. True Christianity is the Truth. Pray to Him and Honor Mary. Have faith in Him. 2021 will be your year.
You looked terrible and have no business stepping inside a ring.  The guys you’ve caught are all bums including yourself
The only people that took L,s was his security and the family 🤣🤣🤣 still haven’t fought a real boxer punk
The fight was fixed
It’s all singles you big dummy.
Your a living joke jake paul
no amount of money is gonna clean those cold sores off his lip
Thems ones lil boy

cringe
Great job Jake on the fight
Retire yourself
Your a drip that fights people in Boxing who can't box lol your abit of dry lunch for a real boxer to fight mate

Kid brags about 65 mil but plays out in his front yard with $1 bills lol. Time to come back inside jake, dinners ready.
You guys remember that guy that streamed the last fight on the reflection of his glasses? That was pretty funny lol
imagine the people that he can help whit the money
You deserve this bro
This dude is getting rich knocking out weak people
Maybe retire a 47 year old next secure the bag 💰
Flex on y’all...... with 1’s
You should retire John Cena
What
I know you sparred with Mike Perry, but it looked like a legitimate fight, come on Jake, take the fight.
Fancy sending me some?😏
Is Tony Hawk next?
You deserve everything you worked so hard for! You go JAKE!
All ones
With that money you could finally have that surgery to raise your iq to average!
You look homeless
Wouldn't  be surprised if ufc 261 did less ppv buys  😑
"Imma flex on y'all" proceeds to dump 1'S.
Most of the money are ones lmao
Go and fight Tommy fury if ur bad Jake, no u ain’t gunna fight a REAL boxer are you?
Have a real fight with Mike Perry.
what a joke
1 dollar bills bro go flex with some dogecoins
Me Gregor
Scammed 😂😂😂😂😂😂

0:40 oh I love this part
We didnt forget about the sexual assault allegations jake.
whole lot of 1$ bills lmfao
I mean fair play lmao
Congrats. You beat one of the worst fighters in the mma
Yo what about Jake vs Viddal?
🥂
Never again
All ones. What's a chump
Jake you can send me a finders fee later...fight Oscar Dr la hoya...he is coming out of retirement looking for a fight....The Problem Child vs The Golden Boy....the press conference would be perfect cause Mr. Powder Puff is far from a Golden Boy!! You can pay me my finders fee later...you're welcome!!
When you order Conor McGregor on Wish.
Why are you flexing ones. Lmao
*gets claimed*
Whats the name of the song?
After reading people's tweets, they kept talking about lawler fight. and i 100% believe the jake Paul's TKO was scripted. Ben got paid $1 Million ,and Jake most likely said hey let me KO u and I'll give you a $ Million or 2. Ben ok $2 Million - $3 Million to just  dive count me in.
Jake knocked out a 40 year old wrestler in a boxing match and cried like he won the olympics. Until this dude actually fights someone who has participated in the sport of boxing prior to knowing who Jake Paul even is I won’t be watching anymore.
who you gonna find next to display your boxing "greatness"? a retired chess master, or a 70 year old sprinter maybe?
This video is longer than the fight
He fights anyone that is actually in their prime that is a professional boxer it lights out for jake 😂
Need to put that landscaping experience to use and cut your damn lawn
So that’s where my $50 went
Stop fighting retired dudes
A bag of $1 bills
1.3 million people ripped off with crap
Jake: fights already retired athletes  Also Jake: WhO sHoUlD i ReTiRe NeXt¿
Ayo everyone reading this just watch the next fight on YouTube “Minecraft with the boys”  or “fortnite with the boys” and you’ll never have to waste your money again
Looks like roller bills yall

Who is this clown, and why is he trending?
Smh imagine paying the person to lose

Lol 😆  why is this even popping up in my feed
I think I made more on your fight than you have on the ground there boss!
Can you actually prove you can box. Ben Askren is a MMA fighter and retired. Box a serious boxer that's in their prime like you. Then everyone will actually give you props.
Jake paullllll💪💪💪
There’s a whooooooole lot of $1’s in that pile 😂 more $1’s than I have tho
Get dogecoin with those, let’s make everybody rich at the same time 😄😆
😂 🌈☀️
Fight canelo bitch 🤪
One dollar bills and flexing ?

Tommy fury will smash you mad
man i live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend whos a stay at home mom for our 2 kids and i only make 20$ an hour and even i have more money then what you are "flexing on us" with lmao. this guy is a clown.
How much did you pay Ben to take the dive? And are you gonna use some of that money for a hair transplant?
65 million, still can't pay someone to mow his lawn
No one cares jake
Imagine flexing with one dolar bills
here just to dislick?
That's a whole lot of singles there 😆🤣
Retire me ! Please
1.2 million for the fakest knock out in boxing history... I bet your momma proud
What is that song ?
What a piece of trash
Well deserved win on saturday
And they'll never even see half of that in their lifetime
He does realize minimum wages like $8 an hour right... And there are people trying to raise families on that? What a piece of trash.
Ay yo give me some 😳😳😳😳
You’re nothing but a joke
You mean which retired fighter should you pay to take a dive next.
Imagine buying this
We know you faked the fight
Those are 1’s 😂
Twoodley would smash all of u in that room ! YOU ARE A CLOWN!
i am presently at 10 $/hours + tip and im handicapped. I NEED YOUR MONEY !
You ain’t fight nobody lol
Rape is serious
*pours 1s
90% 1's lmaoo people have more money sitting under their car seats or drawers.  Maybe you can use that 1200 to start fixing your cul-de-sac that your hiding
Shouldn't that bag contain $100 bills?
Yall dumb as hell to pay 30 bucks for a 1 mintue game 🤣 go to the movies and get more entertainment than seeing him set up a dive match with a middle aged wrestling coach.
Took conors hole aura
Lmao cool bag of 1s
💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Jake need sum lip fillers

Doubt he's going to help any charities or causes he is going to probably spend it on prostitutes
Youre still a joke lol
Chtěl bych no 😬😂
Lol, try me!
how can lots of 1 dollar bills be 65 million dollars
conor does it with benjamins hot shot
Paper view? I watched it free on YouTube...
I reacted to Jake Paul until I fell asleep. Check it out!
this is what happens when adulthood has been rejected and adolescence is accepted as the end goal. It's like pop culture is a downward race to the basement of the shittiest of the shitty.
When they are only $1 lol
Techinaly jake did retire ben because ben said that he will never box again after he took his L so that means ben has still been boxing
Chleba
When are you going to talk about you having a cul de sac???????? We know why you put your hair down
You were just challenged to a fight by Onision, but please make it free and whoop his azz.  I think you're a sellout but Onision needs his azz beat so I'll take your side on this one.
Doge 4/20 !!! Get our bread up!
If you paid for this fight you’re a god damn fool😂😂
Is this the money you paid off the referee or the money you gave Ben to take the dive?  How much will you pay Conello to take a dive?
Minecraft with the boys if u know u know
Cool 1 US-Dollar notes
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
You annoying and immature asf, but...I'll let it slide if you give me the bag 🙄
A Mayweather wanna be!
Fight Floyd mayweather
YouTube is ok with this dude breaking their guidelines and they put him on the trending page bruh
Ur a clown Jake
Why did YouTube put this on the trending page lol
Rod wave
Conner mcgregor wont fight until you have beat a few well known fighters.. so.. Nate Diaz will sign a contract he ain't scared..
You worked a little before you left school, and you act like you worked for years and years hard graft lol. Also, you ain't retired anyone Ben was already retired do you mean who are you going to fight next who is already retired? Fight someone who can fight you back and then brag!
I'll take a million dollars.
I would LOVE to see you and Nate Diaz go 8 rounds!
Fight a real boxer you scrub
So humble
MANNY PACQUIAO ARE YOU DOWN?
You should fight Charlie Zelenoff
75 mil now
I'd want him try to box Ryan Garcia and get TKO from Garcia
I think this is a troll video... those are $1 bills and this guys whole career is based off of theatrics
How'd he end his career when he was already retired lol
How bout u fight a real boxer
That’s a lot of 1s
Fight a real boxer
Predator
has all of that money and still has a receiving hairline
i feel like u could just become the good guy and make more money by fighting ppl that are hated more than you
That's just pieces of paper
Jake, you can't actually buy anything with Usher Bucks...
he used to be a really fun and funny youtuber that does challenges and stuff, but now i watch faze rug more :(
Imagine "flexing" all the time on the people who got you where you are. Jake is honestly a lousy person. But, im also playing his game in which hes getting a dumb amount of money from. Im rambling a bit but jake paul you are a chump.
JP can I Some money  Jk
Sheesh
You could’ve at least got $5 bills
Flex
Imagine paying 20 bucks for a 40 second long fight
Dam who should I retire next with my $1 DOLLAR BILLLLS
All these people saying there just ones do u really think he can fit 65 million into a bag?
Jake should make a song about wining the fight
This man acts like he’s upgraded from landscaping. Look at yourself man. You’re a joke. If you ask anyone which one is more respectable: actually helping society in some way or fighting senior citizens to inflate your fragile ego, the hell do you think they’ll say?
YOU STILL A SCRUB FIGHTING LANDSCAPERS.
All i see is 1 dollars bills
Fair play to ya
never paying for one of those fights again omg so lame
All ones😂😂😂
Plot twist he's a stripper and this is the money he got that night
Staged asf
That looked like $300 1$ bill
Imagine being obsessed with one fight that flexing the money earned is actually all you take from it. MIND BLOWING
Jake you should box canelo or may wether
Mans got 10000 65 mil my as
Seems like he’s such a humble young guy so inspirational
Bruh you trying to flex with ones. Bruh I knock your ass out for 10$ where you at jake paul

Jake paul Capricorn 💵 we love money more than the people
3hrs of that PPV was just musicians, urkle smoking a blunt with Snoop and a slap fight featuring Jake Paul vs Ben Askren
Fight lebron
Still hasn’t fought a real fighter, to scared to accept challenges from real fighters. This dude is nothing but a bum. Sure he’s rich, doesn’t change the fact that he’s tarnishing the boxing world while being the worlds biggest bum.
If this were a street fight, Ben Askren would obliterate you.
Jake paul my favorit channel
"Used to landscape for 10 dollars an hour." Acting like he started from the bottom lmao. You were still in high school living with your parents. 😂
How much of that went to Ben to take a dive?
Aye bro got free money
and this is why we want this guy to get his ass kicked...if only he would fight a real boxer....complete ass hat
Honey you’re trying too hard to look cool, just let it come natural like it does to Gucci
Fight a real boxer
This guys an idiot saying he retired Ben. Ben was retired and said he would be win or loose. You retired no one. How about fighting an actual "boxer" now.
donate to charity please
song?
"Who should I retire next?"                             *yourself*
Who you fight though?
I will fight you jake paul for free I'll pull up or you pull up let's fucking see how it is then cause pi king and choosing fighters doesn't make you a champ at all
If you can imagine a world where Jake Paul isn't Jake Paul I'll give u $65 million.     For brain transplant...
Did anyone else notice they was all 1$

In the bag is only dollar bills
Fight a real fighter
Here's the only names we'll accept for your next fight; Oscar Delahoya Daniel Cormier 50 Cent Anderson Silva LL Cool J Chael Sonnen Method Man Roy Jones Joe Rogan Evander Holyfield
whats the song
“For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭16:25-26‬ ‭KJV‬‬
You can retire me i only need about 250k :)

That's gotta be at least $10
Bro u savage
I want to retire!
I can’t believe I bought the right. It was utter shite.
KONOR
Bro that’s like $200. Why are you going to dump a bag of ones. Lol
Retire a REAL boxer
Just my opinion - He ant climbing when he hasn't fought a boxer yet. If you want to climb the ladder then fight boxers in the boxing industry. The first one between deji and Jake I understood as it weren't professional boxing. The basket ball player couldn't box, Gib couldnt box, Ben Askren couldnt box (he was just in it for the pay day) < None of these people were professional boxers and couldnt box at all.  He needs to fight a boxer like Tommy Fury and if he wins he'll have all of my respect as well as everyone else's. This kid needs to stop fighting people who can't box cause then he's not a boxer. 👁️👄👁️
U still need to fight a real fighter get a grip mate 2 youtubers that were easy fights deji who couldnt fight his way out a wet paper bag n gibby who look shook from the start then a retired basketballer  n now this ben gezza who like the commentator said look like he had a body like vince Vaughn get a real fight with a boxer your 3kos aint worth the toilet roll i use to wipe my arse 🤣🤣🤣till u fight someone who can actually box stop bragging it 🤣🤣
there 1s my guy haha
Where does all that 65 million dollars go?,?, basically in the trash bin
Be humble stop flexing 🤦‍♀️💕
Chleba chleba chleba 😀 good job 😌
Ones, lol
That’s 272 dollars
Ben was already retired you ass hat!!
Those who try to flex, look the weakest😅
Those are one dollar bills
Maybe retire someone that isn’t already retired
Dude you gotta do a boxer next, like a ring active boxer
Those were mainly ones
Help poor people with this money

Why do people love making these clowns richer. Tip you God Dame gig workers. Stop paying for ppv

There all 1 dollar bills LOL stop fronting bro
The people who took the real L in all of this are those who paid for the fight an Jake because Jake  trained hard for a fight against a middle aged man who looked like a bag of milk and made a Millie in 20 secs whilst Jake is out here thinking he's an actual boxer now.
Connor mcgregor in a fight-red panty night  Jake paul in a fight- sitting among a bunch of 1 dollar bills Togther-red panty night at the strip club raining one dollar bills
0:39 Thank me later
Anyone know the song? It smacks

Brooo what is that song called...
I can be 100x as happy as you are with 1,000,000x less money.  It'll catch up with you eventually, no one actually likes YOU, just what you can bring to the table.  Its been proven time and time again.  There is nothing more depressing  and lonely than a mansion built for one.
LMAO look at that plastic lookin fight club belt XD  snoop dogg was the only enjoyable aspect of this "boxing match"
0:25 man Ben had already been retired for over 10 years
The only people who took "L's" where the people who bounght the fight. Lol

All I see is 1s

chleba
Looks like a lot of one dollar bills
OKAY JAKE I SEE YOU 🤩  If you’re reading this, “When life gives you Monday, dip it in glitter and sparkle all day.” ✨💛 HAPPY MONDAY EVERYONE!🤟 I have an awesome YouTube channel that I think you should go check out!🤪
G.Y.T.O.A.T. “GREATEST YOUTUBER OF ALL TIME”
GOT TO BE THE WOLDS BIGGEST DOUCHE BAG!!!!
Lol when u flex $1 bills
He’s acting like he fought someone who’s a professional boxer and was a threat to destroy his record he needs to fight a professional boxer to prove everyone he means serious business in boxing or else everyone will always think he’s a joke
song?
1$
"who should I retire next" you mean to say "who should I fight next that's already retired" 😂
The move would be to just put even just 10% of what he earned into a disease research charity to greatly help the fight against it
Man acting like he gets all the ppv money wtf
Song ?
Maybe people will love you now
You paid Askren to get his @ss down.. :)  Who is the next one little girl? Tiger Woods? Or some retired chess player?  Man up and fight a pro boxer
Cringe with his bunch of $1's

How about you fight a Actual Boxer or someone that you didn't find off the street at the very least. Then maybe you would get some credit.
This boy flexing with 1 dollar Bills and says he got 65mil
Why are they all dollar bills? 🤔
Still a tw@
Fair play to you pal you done what you said you would do but you need to fight a professional boxer next 👍

It's all 1s
65 million in singles 😂😂😂
Fight a real boxer
Song name?
Jake is all hype with no substance.  Jake has never fought a real boxer and he won't because he's afraid of being exposed for what he really is, a scrub.  If Jake thinks he has "elite level skills" then let's see him fight a six round fight against Ryan Garcia.  King Ryan weighs only 135 pounds but he would destroy Jake.
Thats crazy you used to landscape for $10 im glad your WEALTHY Daddy and Mommy taught you good values as a kid💯💯😑
👻👻👻
Hi
Literally all dollar bills seen 1 hundred and rest $1’s lmao
Bro pulled out less than 1K In dollar bills and started acting like he Mayweather

he mayweather or what lol
*One dollar* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣You're trash, Jake.
only 1s nigga
I wish I was getting paid to box teddy bears🤣 you’re trash bro. Your time is coming💯 boxing is a weak ass sport anyways. If you wanna call yourself a “fighter” go full throttle and fight in the UFC. Then maybe you can talk all that big game if you actually survive😉
Regardless of how , these guys are changing the game.
A side
Fight a proper fighter then you desperate wanna be boxer😂😂
Fight John Cena 🔥

When I heard he was fighting Ben I was like he is going to be demolished. I then found out it was for BOXING, which ain’t even fighting so stupid. If it was MMA Jake would’ve been done for
Keep flexing broski! When I make it also nothing is going to stop me
When you gonna fight an actual boxer? Serious question...
Jake amazing
Bunch of dollor bills
Motivation

If anyone didn’t deserve the money it’s you
You should retire from fighting as paying people off will get you nowhere
I'll fight in you for free bro where same age I am nobody theres only one way to destroy this kid and its is let a 0 sub YouTube end him his career 🥊🥊
You are quite possibly the most sad petty human being in history

Well done jake Paul I’m happy you won

Joke, fights a retired MMA fighter in a sport  that he is unfamiliar with and calls himself real... at what point is this clown going to fight an actual boxer? Or enter the cage in an MMA fight against a current fighter with the same amount of training? No pride in fighting a smaller fighter in a sport that you have a clear advantage in... FTP
This man worked in landscaping a couple weeks as summer job in highschool and acts like he went through the trenches lmao
Thank you Jake, I believed in u and bet half of my house down payment (6k) and won 4 grand 🤣 big risk but had big trusss in you boi letts goooo!!!

What shall it profit a man if he gains the world and loses his own soul? or what shall A man give in exchange for his soul (Matthew 16:26).  For one who abides by his own understandings follows death for by the yoke of the devil ye are held and by his yoke, the flesh shall speak of.

All the money, all the women and still can’t buy happy
You only won cause he was 44 and retired
Here I thought he was going to say he was going to donate all this money to charities because he already has all the money he needs but no this was just video of him flexing his undeserved wealth
I'm proud of you jake this one was for shadow

Wow man a bag of ones
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brother
nice job on the one and done but what are you going to do now that everyone knows your last fight was a work? your only real recourse is to start fighting boxers, where the record matters, otherwise, nobody is going to pay the pay per view fee. you're so dumb for working the fight bro, i'm pretty sure your exhibition career is over now. let's see if you can hang with your own sport now, bro, lol.
Yo congress on the win. But y u got all ones in the bag bro
Sheeesh
That looks more like a thousand
Those are ones you aren’t flexing
Fight a boxer then you'll prove yourself
How about, I know this sounds crazy, but how about boxing someone that actually knows how to box. You know... someone that has been training just as long or a bit longer?
wow congrats . oneday iwill have that kinda money👌😎

good$hit jacob #65.
Love you so much jakeyyy❤️😍😍😍 And congratulations ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That's clever,  but a p****!  Jake is betting big In his box fights which he knows he will win because all the guy he boxed never box in their entire life .  And thus he is generating big amount of money in a fight . That's a new idea how to win big easily , and after all that's becoming I guess a business right    What a pro boxer😶?
Song is Reo Cragun - Maxed Out ft. OT Genesis
You should give that money for the people who paid for the fight lol
okey but who asked?
Hey Jake I have to admit I've hated on you alot since you started boxing I actually used to watch you in 2016 and stopped in 2018 and turns out I underestimated you so just wanted to say sorry
Yessir jake
Congratulations to all the clowns who wasted there money on a fixed fight
All dolla bills .. what ya got 67 bucks in there??

Damm if I had that money I would get my family out of the hood area and find them a better place to live and also give my parents a lot of that money to retire from work because they been working since they were 10 years old back in there part of town
Why does he keep saying he was a landscaper? I thought he was on some Disney show as a teenager? He trying to act hard done by or something?
Don’t u love ones
Imagine if a wind storm just started blowing all 😭 congrats though
Whats the song
Jake: 65 Million Dollar Generated  $1 Dollars: That's cute

Still waiting for a real fight...

Did he just say 1.3 million ppv buys?? 1.3 million, TF???
Think we all can agree Jake Paul's fanbase just consist of 5-15 year old white boys💀
Jake Paul I see what you did there good fight
There where all ones
Fight An Actual Boxer Then I’ll Be Interested
He’s got a bag of $1’s on purpose, and look at all the comments he’s created by doing this. I’m writing a comment ffs 🤦‍♂️ lol
I have to sincerely apologize to the fbi agent that had to watch this with me
Props to winning the hustle game for sure, but how about boxing a real boxer or better yet actually trying to go pro??? Serious technical issues in stance and offense, would be destroyed by an true boxer.
Im a youtube fighter jake or bring your big brother to fight me 21-2 stop boxing bums i would had killed them bums you fought see me my name gorilla street beefs
he acts like he came out the projects hahha at least u were able to make money hahahahahhaaha
Jake NEEDS to TRAIN Logen
Jake paul big fan can u buy me a pc
Does anyone have this song in the background
Wow look at that 200$ you got there. That’s really special, bud.
All dollar bills XD nice flex lol
Very well done Jake! Now fight a real boxer.
Yessir jake keep up the grind
"if you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to"
I fr landscape for $10 an hour 😂
When he fights a real fighter it will be over for him 😂
You should fight the rock, I bet the will be your best fight yet
Fight a real boxer next, unless you wanna keep calling out mfrs with Dad bods that fight like the 3 stooges.
You got your fight club! Butt I got mines🤟🏽
what a beast
Hey Logan's little brother how about a  Boxing match against retired fighter Oscar De La Hoya or are you too scared?
Inspirational figure🔐
Yeah let’s do it
Boombaclatt
😂
Ben was already retired.
Bruv fair fucking play to the lad honestly, what ever bullshit people gonna say heeeeeees chilling. good effort.
Ra**st
I swear they were $1 bills but ok
What are you flexin with? Haha all them $1 bills? You’re a joke to be honest. You wouldn’t fight someone you’re age and size. I wouldn’t be bragging about beating some old man. Especially throwing $1 bills like they hundred haha
Chleba
Oh Jesus, he's gonna be even more unbearable now...
Today is my birthday
CAN I have that money Jake
Triller having Triller belts is smart. @DAZN get on this and make unified title belts. Buy WBO or something it's time for unification like UFC instead of 7 belts per division
Whats the Song?
You can delete all the comments you want  Everyone still knows he forces himself on passed out girls
Great generated shot, salute from @beardedvillainsmoscow ⚔️💪🇷🇺
You ain’t do enough fucking flexing man you dead ass just change the face of fighting 💯
I streamed the fight
Your flexing by showing a bag of $1s? My child has that much moneyvin ones lmao
All I see is one dollar bills
You should box an actual boxer 😳, never thought of that?
If you want to be a real boxer stop charging people for bouts that would be considered padding in any other boxers career
too many ones I see there bro...
who the hell was taking 400 shots of nothing
First acted like Conor, and now acting like btec version Mayweather 😂😂
hey jake paul fan here from philippines.I need phone for online class but I cant afford to buy new one.I hope you see this.❤️❤️
There all $1
I wouldn’t want all that money if it meant the entire planet hated me and knew I was a worthless piece of garbage on the inside
how about you fight an actual boxer that will actually train and try to beat him with a ref that doesnt end the fight after one punch
Lmfao when you fight people already retired 😂😂
How bout you challenge a boxer next? Nate Diaz is a jiu jitsu specialist. Askren was a wrestler. Fight a BOXER, and have your nuts bounce off the canvas.
Joke of a world we live in
Will Jake Paul ever fight a professional boxer? Or just keep selecting cream puffs he can pretend to box with?
Seen some things on tiktoks that are made by fans but I think it would be a good fight against Paul Gallen Australia vs USA
mediocre clowns.  but billionaires
No flex pls
Go back to vloging pls
1 dollar Bill's
Those are one dollar bill 😂 how is this flexing on anyone.
Legend 💯🔥
You vs Bryce hall
Can see some one dollar bills there my friend 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂

Step in the octagon you mcgregor wannabe!!
GET A BUGATTI OR KONIGGSEGG
Congratulation to win !!!!!!!!!!!
please understand him he is telling u what ''THEFIGHTCLUB'' GOT INCOME FROM THE EVENT; mo @jakepaul money.
Chleba IS a bread
Damn bro that's a whole load of 1'ns and a couple hundreds
Now, after your fight, i want you to challenge manny pacquiao.
Fight me bro I’m the real money fight. Forget all these nobody’s you fought let’s goooo pussy
Retire  wilder
That shotgun u did with your hands after you knocked him out is wilder move that’s the wrong guy to mimic. U will get knocked out
Was thatbreally besseserie
Hell yeah jake I’m so happy for you man. SOOOO many people doubted you!
Glad to see his growth but i lowkey miss the old jake the vids were good then
someone humble this man rn
Fight manny
Good work young man. Here's some advice:  Cut Snoop Dogg loose.  He is bad news.
Fight a real boxer like your brother is
Fight conor mcgregor
Stayed up till 5-6am to watch a 1min fight, but it was well worth it. Great KO by Jake, onto the next one.  Jake can fight, going forwards or backwards, he's still very inexperienced, so he's building himself up. A few years in boxing is nothing, he's started out very late. People complain about Jakes opponents, but then you have someone like Tommy Fury fighting bin men with 0 wins and 10 losses after 5 fights against actual boxers, and he's been fighting his whole life. So people need to get some perspective.
Ya did a good work by sharing roe cragun's song, it really needs some recognition💚
Next  fight : Jake Paul vs Khabib Nurmagomedov  The ring : Jake's dreams
Kids such a beast. Just remember if the world hates you it’s because they hated Jake Paul first.
All that money and u still cant do what mrbeast does
Song ?
Fight
Hmmm, I wouldn’t mind a retirement🤔
Tommy fury would make you look silly come on fight a proper boxer bum
Keep doing your thing Jake, you killing it
gimme sum
You should fight CM punk next
Bro can i have 10,000
Money and chleba 👌🥶😃
Mans living his life ..
U have fought a load of chumps who can't fight their way out of a wet paper bag tommy fury would flatten u in half a round keep ducking him tho 👍🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
0:39 hope this puts you all out of your misery. it certainly did for me
I watched this fight illegally and still feel ripped off 😂
Fight someone good
THE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
COVID exists BTW.
All are 1 dollars
GG WELL PLAYED! You deserve it dude fuck all the haters
Aha they all hating cause you just went and broke the Internet again 👌🔥💯💥
go and fight Jan Claude Van Dame next please ! JCVD might be your toughest test yet.
Man said I'm flex on you " 1 dollar bills"
retire next or ask to come out of retirement ? lol
Can you fight boxers now instead of having these MMA people train just to box. That's like asking a swimmer to go compete in football
Jake Paul has came a long way. Finna search his net worth 🤣
chleba
Why you so noob man..
Donate.. there are people out there with big dreams just waiting for a sign like you
The question we all wanna ask jake paul's parents is:    ”is it too late for an abortion?"
Half that money is 1’s
All Of A Sudden Everyone’s A Fan Now.
Shushh
Okay money and all but whats the name of the song?
Kids you happy this guy gets rich cause u buy that shitty ppv?
1$
😐👎
Maybe fight a landscaper now???
what a douche
The disgust I feel towards Jake Paul is equal to what I felt towards King Joeffrey from Game of Thrones
MY MAN
I also ready to fight u Jake, even u only pay me 5000 USD 😂
Chleba
Dan Bilzerian
Song ?
I very much doubt he was a landscaper. That requires a significant amount of training and is actually quite a difficult job. I think he means he moved a neighbours lawn once for some candy
Why are you all dissing him like he still won in the fight and made at least 45mill from people buying the stream, also he had mad odd my 30k turned to 85k
I didn't pay but did I lose my money
Only i can beat jake , he’ll stupidly hit me in the stomach , because i’m so fat it’ll bounce back into his face and knock him out
That’s like 10k in one dollar bills bro
0
I miss the old jake 😭😭
What is the music name
i think he is gone become the greatest boxer in history.
Jake I scape my breakfast and lunch just to watch I even saw every single minute of that fucking concert.

Congratulations on your victory win jake !!!!
Jake Paul is never gonna evolve from a 5th grade bully flexing his tns
Why they all $1 bills tho
Remember to  take a min to Thank God for the blessing he gave to you.

Anyone knows the name of the song Jon Marianek played in the van on his ig story?
King jake

No money can buy you Ben's character, loyalty and family, good luck
retire conor mcgregor if you actually can lol
Send me some of that
He might be a decent fighter and a smart businessman ,but his attitude and his personality is trash . There is literally so much difference between him and his brother. Anyone can agree that you would never want him as a friend in your life.
Can anyone name the song in this?
Damn logans little brother is in the big leagues now!!

Who should I retire next ,?? You mean who should I pay next that is retire
Everyone in the comments is like "yow they were like retired". It's like saying Floyd mayweather can't fight either. Just shut the fuck up and accept it. It's FACTS. Jake sharpened his skill. Did what he had to do. For shadow. For everyone who supported him. And to all his haters and doubters.
How can you be taken seriously as a boxer without having boxed an actual boxer...
We are waiting for the fight with Tommy Fury
U THINK UR GOOD
When Charlie Zelenoff has a more legitimate boxing career.
We live in a world where being an idiot gets you all the money in the world.  Usa is a shithole
Can I at least get $10 I always root for you
they're all $1's u goon
They $1 bill though lol
Fight a REAL opponent FATTY
Song?
Dana whites million he gonna spend at the strip club 🤣
How about fighting a professional boxer  like u call yourself tough guy? A real boxer. Get over yourself cause you'll get knocked down soon.
$1 bills
The biggest winner was ben. he basically enjoyed himself the whole time. he didn't really train that much and didn't do so much social media stuff. and still walks away with a bag. brother jack here did all the work but the hustle is the hustle. keep doing u bro. the value of the person is in his hustle
He meant to say  “who should I fight that’s already retired next?”
I’ll fight you right now
🤡
if I had that much money, I would buy the most sophisticated laptop so I can give it to my son for study.. 😭😭😭
all 1 s

Fight with Conor McGregor
This man is obsessed with money
The commentating during the whole event was wack as hell.
lol the amount if 1 dollar notes its too funny

Fight night round 1 remake:Jake Paul edition
Stop ducking the real fighters Jake

You haters are so funny, jake paul is a marketing genius and stacking huge racks in his bank account with these "fights". The haters are just giving him more clout and more money.
Fight a UFC fighter
Yay!! Now you can pay back all the people you scammed!!
Alot of ones there falling out that bag
The biggest KO of the year
YOU A LEGEND
now all that money is for jake or triller
Dollar bills tho 🥲
They are one dollar bills :s
Lend me some money please
Hey jake wanna fight a real boxer?go reply to t-woodly's tweet.🤡

That's a lot of one dollar bills mixed in there padding the shot.
A minute of silence for those who paid to watch the fight
Maybe Tiger Woods
Lend me 1M at least please help a brother out 😴
Your brother will make more money fighting Floyd Mayweather even if he Loses. Facts

Aren't those 1 dollar bills?
1 dollar bills....
Retire Ryan Garcia, Ryan Garcia’s your man. Easy win (chuckles under breath) . Seriously tho call him out, would def pay for that fight.
Honestly, all Jake has to do to be more likeable is humble himself. I bet 65 million he couldn't if his life depended on it lol
Ask Manny Pacquiao for a fight
The bottom line is he beat 3 people up you couldn’t, and you can’t beat him up either.  So stop talking crazy through YouTube accounts
Are those 1$ bills? xD
good for you man :)
What was that like 400 in 1s?
I think you mean "Who should I re-retire next?" 😂😂😂
Jake ur a neek
Hi jake i knew you would win that fight love u no homo
jake paul giving ben 64 million lol
Its gotta be dillon

Fair play kid
Surely you meant to say "who should I bring out off retirement next?" instead of "who should I retire next?", right?
Please fight a real boxer
Fight manny pacquio next if you want to fight the real fighter

Weird flex, but okay
You mean who should you bring out of retirement next?
65 million dollars and zero class  ,this is what you get 🙄
Just came here to downvote 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Look at all these haters complaining 😂. Quite funny to read the comments.
So he's saying he just scammed millions of people
Ewwwww
what  is the song called?
You are crazy dude keep doing that great job man. I wish you luck in your life and next fight too you're awesome.
Flexing them Washingtons yall.
I was hoping this Jay Leno love child was gonna get laid out and I'm gutted he didn't. Hopefully the next "Athlete" he fights takes that big arse chin clean off.
Hey Jake Paul, the people just want to see a real good fight, you made it look too easy.
Tf is that ugly ass belt
You 👑 king
You mean who should you bring out of retirement next?
Fight your window
the EVENT generated 75 mil... YOU generated around 600k

Strip Club Hustler!

Pussssyyyyyy dna🤣🤣🤣🤣
Satisfying :D
*His daddy, Snoop Dog may have made a few million, but cringy here is "flexing" with $1 bills.*
The smartest one was ben actually,I think he did purposely so that he can enjoy this much money too. No wonder ben was smiling after the fight .. basically the concept of "would you take a punch for 500k" HAHAHA good game ben 💪
gotta love those ones and that 1 100 dollar bill but good work
Maybe next time fight someone who's in a wheelchair? You know... since you're afraid to fight anyone with a real boxing experience...
background song?
Why $1 bills where’s this millions he’s speaking of

Jake vs Dillon Danis
Dam mate I wish you cud see your Instagram inbox frome mj's_sri_turbo
Doge coin to the moon
“I used to landscape for $10 for an hour” well looks like your yard could use some mowing right now.
Let’s get this straight! As soon as he fights a really boxer he’s loses. Obviously he can beat a youtuber, basketball player and the worst striker in mma history.
How embarrassing doing a video with $1's 🤣🤣🤣🤣 What a nonce !! Fight someone proper please ffs, Give Billy Joe Saunders a call if you think your a boxer you'll never get any credit until you Fight a pro Boxer Lil Boy.
That’s a lot of $1 for a mil
Half of that are 1 dollar bills bruh but wtvr
"i used to landscape for $10 an hour" i find that very hard to believe
Thems is hella ones brah 😂😆 omg hahaha
I'll praise you when you fight a real boxer.
All one dollar
65 mil and still can’t buy content
Retire someone good
Thing is Jake Paul can make as much money as he wants from staged fights but it doesn’t change the fact that he is Probably one of the most hated content creators ever
Someday you'll have to fight against an actual boxer and you'll lose.
I can’t believe you are proud of beating retired non boxers 😂 lol like seriously nobody is taking you serious until you fight somebody real. Im guessing your too scared, cause you know you will lose. Embarrassment to the sport .
Imagine saying you’re a boxer without ever have had a fight against another boxer 💀
chleba
That was a carnival show 🤦🏻‍♂️🤡 good job on fooling everyone. 👏🏻
it's only 1 dollar bill dude HAHAHAHA
Canelo see if you last a round

Come on bruh, 65 million generated from the fight, 1 mill on your neck and you fukin dump dollar bills?? 🤦‍♂️
Fight Francis Ngannou next
Why are they all $1 tho should been hunnids lol
When jake talks about how he struggles with his career in one of his videos, it doesn’t  make it easy for all the people because when you see this you think that Jake has everything in the world if he’s flexing money left right and centre
Who tf flexes on their fans 😂
Who you gonna retire next? Well its safe to assume it won't be a boxer! 😆 🤣 😂
using $1 bills show how dumb and stupid that guy is ... if you call yourself a pro boxer fight one then !
When are you fighting Askren?
You should retire Ngannou :)
Buy dogecoin and hold
Jake has no chance versus a real boxer
Why is he showing us his toilet paper
We all tought that Jake couldnt get worse than the team 10 song. I guess it could.
Fight danis
Are we gonna ignore that those were 1 dollar bills. Pause at 29 seconds
1milion for Jon?
How can he afford alot
cringe
I’m so happy you won Jake Paul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
congratz bro, when are you fighting a real boxer?? lmao
Benjamin he got benajmins 🎼
This guy lives in Michaels house from gta5 lmao😂
Save those dollar bills.  This latest sexual assault accusation could retire you.
Who ever bought the paper-view  and wasted 55$ slap them selves
How good does it feel to be despised by 99.9% of the world? Get your sh*t together dude. Karma bites son. Gain some humility. I’m gonna have a celebration when you get slept for the first time. I wish to god I could be the one to teach your spoiled little a%# that lesson. It would be an absolute pleasure
I like how they're all one dollar bills
Copying Floyd Mayweather We get that jake we get that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There all 1's... Js
Shush

Mans be flexing his ones 💀🤚
name of song
She should fight cáñelo instead of mma fighters bc cáñelo the only one who gonna give him a ass whopping
Jake ask Canelo Alvarez for a fight VIVA MEXICO CULEROS 🇲🇽
Neflexcim neflexcim neflexcim 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Song ?
Tommy Fury is the only right answer. You have power but you haven’t fought a real boxer so it shows nothing.
What’s the name of that song?🔥
chleba
yo what song is this its fireeeee
i feel so good for you becuz im ur biggest fan
A so happy for you jake
Bro had to use one's he couldn't even use hundreds like the rappers do I mean dang that was like $300 in that bag didn't look too impressive to me it looked like what a stripper makes in a night
Why those all ones??
This guy wants to be pop smoke but he wants to have a full clip in his mouth
Yo jake Lemme get 3 grand xD
Hook me up 100k a lil bit. Singles are okay.
Fight Conor benn

Retire me bro
0:04 PAUSE AND SEE 1 DOLLAR BILLS. LOL
Jakes team splitting the 50s and hundos, hands the bag of ones to jake.. "here's ur cut kid"
Just keep paying fighters off, so your career gets started. You should be a actor.
Well done bro you won me money fight the winner out off Connor McGregor or Dustin train your ass off again beat one of them I believe you can
Try to fight manny pacquiao 🤛
Charlie z next
Honestly I’m glad he is changing his image. It’s a hard thing to do, I didn’t fuck with him before but I actually really fuck with him now, a lot of people are on the same page as me....
I like how this dude dumps a bunch of 1’s on the ground
Yo people in the comments are salty asf😄
People want to check Jake Paul's worth by making him fight with people who have over 8 years of experience, and have been fighting since they were 14. They forget that he started training 2 years ago, and is a YouTuber. Even after winning he is the underdog.
Chleba
Chleba
Jake Paul king
Hahahahahahaha
This guy looks and behaves like a total inbred
Those are all ones
What is the name song?
gimme pls
FIGHT A REAL BOXER
chleba
@No Name ur a hater get on jake ended the fight in less then 1min get over it how about u fight him next
Nice win Jake watched that one round knock out you are unstoppable no one believed u neither did I but u proved me wrong
All them $1 bills you absolute crank and whoever actually paid to watch you beat a retired wrestler with a hip replacement need their heads testing... Tommy Fury offered you a fight but you choose to pick people with very little stand up ability... when you grow the balls to fight someone half decent you may actually impress people
Come on how much did you pay Ben to loss
yeah you can thank all the musicians thats the only reason you sold so many views
I just want to know the name of this song. Who can link me the name of this song please. Shits a vibeeee
Jake vs Floyd NEXT!
Jake might needs to fight Mike Tysons how he landing them hits
Fight ME FIGHT ME cause even if I lose ima get RACKS
Haters are so sad and pathetic. Pls, do anything with your life.
What’s the song?
Paul Vs Rousey
You’ve been focusing on boxing so much I low key miss your blogs ngl
Man I miss the old you you used to be a good youtuber now look at you
Why the hell Jake Paul is in my recomendation.
“65 MILLION DOLLARS GENERATED”  Bag of ones:
Jake Paul haters : he should fight a real boxer now . So y’all basically saying he should fight a real boxer why cuz you think jakes a real boxer ? Oh I thought u guys where saying he was just a youtuber
Who won
Do u know how much conor McGregor generated on his boxing match with Mayweather???? Lol........chill kid.
He should start playing pool, take the edge off🍷
Give me some....
maybe fight a real boxer
Fight Tyson for real
Song?
Show me the Washingtons! Usa balleh with all them Washingtons.
I’m sorry but how you gonna act hard as hell and rich as hell and then dump out $200 in $1s 😂😂😂
Jake paul you are a joke, I will fight you for nothing to keep you from ever stepping into a ring again
I probably count like 2k there, all in a dollar bill

Good fight bro
I knew jake was gonna win from day 1.
Good for you,  now ask yourself what's next... fame , money, living a dream but what will your fingerprint be on this world when you leave.  Good luck in whatever is next
Go fight a real man like Ryan Garcia or Conor Mcgregor
Lol you steal that $1 bag from Floyd? 😆 Were gonna need that again when you fight Conor.
1's ?????🤔bra
And how much did you pay Ben to lose?
Those are all 1s though. So it just looks like you're flexing your stimulus check.
Congratulation Jake❤❤❤❤ Easy chleba bro❤❤
They are all ones 🤣 we know you got money so why “flex” with ones? Smh 🤦🏼‍♂️
Did haters really come here to support Jake’s bag with a view and comment 🥱🤦🏻‍♀️

Hardwork pays off bro!🙏

Fight a for real fighter
What's the name of the song????
His next fight will be against a 60 year old quadriplegic named Jose Gonzalez who used to be a gardener. After that he will claim he is better than Floyd Mayweather. Sad thing is, its all you dumb shits on youtube that is giving Jake money. Stop paying for this dribble and he will go away
Bruh their all ones

Twitch had like 100,000 people watching for free lmao
I see 1s 😐🤨
I'd love to see him try that crap in an actual boxing ring with a real ref and opponent who is an actual boxer! Give him a real test stop shaming Boxing with this WWF stuff put him up against any real amateur boxer or southpaw, and he's done. Heck I'll do it!
Notice how you won’t fight a boxer 🤡 notice how those are all ones🤡 notice how you talked abt giving ur team dry over the pants hand jobs and gave the ref one too, that is why he stopped the fight early
Retire that big ego of yours next!
One good gust of wind and his day would have changed
do you just sit on your rich as lawn every day to dump like 50 $1 bills?
i’m proud to be a jake pauler
Homie that’s like a thousand dollars in 1’s smh
They are all ones😂
Fight Tommy Fury next

How about a thank you to everyone who bought your fight dumbass
no one asked , like you’re deadass like ( i uSe To LanDscaPe ) youve  said it so many times youu me as well add it as a lyric just like DAX “ i use to be a janitor “ ( i use to do landscaping )
Jake Paul vs tommy fury
Congratz ! Hard work pays off hopefully someone takes you serious one day ! But jake he didn't take you serious i feel you need to get real competition stay humble and keep working ...because that fight was terrible it's like he was your punching bag..
It’s about to belong to that girl he sexually assaulted!
Nothing but ones
You deserve it bro❤️
Congrats on your win

Yet again with the landscaping. This boi been with Disney since like 14 He ain't done a proper days work in his life. Prick
Congrats jake 🔥👑
Ben Askren & his wife were talking & laughing on their way from the ring, Snoop kept mentioning the $2MIL he bet & then you watch the replay of the punch, Ben talking & walking towards the ref....IT WAS A PLANNED MONEY GRAB! HAHAHA!
All $1 bill bitch!
I'm having a baby in 2 weeks. Can I have some money to start a savings account for him 😊
haters just shut the fuck up Jake has done it.
Who's his next opponent? A professional ice skater, snow boarder, poker player, sports commentator, restaurant owner, lawyer, ambulance driver, food delivery driver, politician, security guard, landscaper, rapper, dancer, daycare worker, bus driver lol the list could go on and on. Whoever it is if Jake beats them it only cements his legacy of being the greatest boxer of all time lol even better then Muhammad Ali. Lmao this dirt bag needs to get knocked out. Maybe he'll actually eventually fight a real professional boxer one day. We all know if he does he will get knocked out in a heartbeat. I find it funny people in the media are saying he's a  professional boxer yet he has never fought a single professional boxer.
Bro Jake you gotta get worse lmao no ones going to want to buy your next fight if you finish so quick
ahaha
Small bag largely with one dollar 💵 notes, u ain’t flexing dude tf 🎃, you capping on camera 😸

Give it to poor people
👍👍💵💵

Congrats on the win.  I watched it.  But you've yet to fight a seasoned PROFESSIONAL boxer.  Only then will people take you seriously.
Great fight Jake, I honestly thought that was going to go for at least 3 rounds but you came out and took care of business great fight!

Fight a Mexican fighter like tito ortiz he will beat u up so bad jake. It's embarrassing that u fight someone that's old retired ect . You should fight someone big. In order to be the best you have to take out the best my boy

Cherry picking fights.

Waiting for Hollywood to make a movie " Great Paul - History of a millionaire."
No one cars
askren done well to generate 1.3mil buys
Bruh everything was wrong especially you paying the announcer to pronounce Ben Askren name wrong, plus you fighting retired guys ok 🥶
Yo honestly I can put this guy out in 1 round and just to be nice I'd take it to the 2nd then put him out
I’m sure he forgot bout Tydus
Congratulations Jake Paul, for turning Boxing into a Rock'n'Wrestling. BEN DIVED, it was as clear as the nose on YOUR face. How did you split the 65Mil, 50-50 or 70-30? Also, do you feel bad for the people who paid for the fight that you basically scammed money from?
How about a REAL non-retired fighter next, and this time no pay to win🤷🏿‍♂️
Damn jake paul is best at being the worst
Bruh you garbage
KEEP AT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
whats the song
Let me guess his gonna fight another retired dude again
Remember Disney?

CONOR: DER ALL WOOOOONS   GFTO WIT YER SKEWLBAG

Donate my dude I need money for college 😂
Hahahahaha 1$ bills. The whole damn thing lol. Damn Jake, that hairline is disappearing, can see your scalp thru that translucent mop
The sheer number of people you pissed off by winning (yet again) is greater than anything imo lmao. Keep being a King homie, God bless.
ThOsE ArE AlL OnEs......that looks like 150-200$ dollars man you know what i can do with that? i might sound broke but aye 200$ is alot for me 😎😎😎
Try retire in a real boxer someone who’s in a boxing league ,just saying.

Imagine thinking life's purpose is all about money.

Is that all the money you paid Ben to win the boxing match?
U deserve it brother 👊
Fuckn dollar bills 😂🤣

Congratulations bro💕
He should fight the goat Charlie Zelenoff next.
GOAT 👏👏👏👏
Lol Jake acting like he's some self-made millionaire and had to go through such hard times to get to the top. In reality, he would be nothing if it wasn't for his young fan base of children who viewed his content, supported his videos for years and bought his merch. It's sad he is so quick to forget that, or maybe he's just delusional, perhaps.
Ill fight you for free bare knuckle
fight canelo alvarez
You earned it man, great fight
Let’s go jake you will take over history
Jake Paul making millions
What song is that playing
Dana white wheres the 1 milion dollars
Those all 1s but gg congrats

Poirier vs Jake
Jake, you did it. You make it happen in your life with your lifestyle. Good job!
Show some fucking pay stubs that you used to work in a landscaping company
To be a hard-working labor you’re on the Internet saying that you used to work landscaping like if people are supposed to feel like like you came from the ground up when in reality you came from really rich parents and you lived in Hollywood your whole fucking life
Congrats on the win but why are u holding one dollar bills
Hard work paid off, good job Jake, we are all proud of you

J PAUL congrats bro! $$$ I had it right from the start, actually I thought he would walk into something but you stepped into him. Sometimes a simple feint 1-2  can get the job done. You really stepped into it with the right, almost too much after you threw it you were wide open check that little mistake it could cost you against a decent defensive fighter bro. Other than that nice left hooks, body shots, foot work, defense. You stay sharp on the comedown tho bro no room for mistakes the time is now! 🤛🏻🤜🏻

WHAT JAKE REALLY MEANS TO SAY IS: “Hey guys it’s Jake Paul, I just made $700K to fight a guy who just had hip surgery, and will make another $350K off the PPV SO $1M, which is what I used to make in a week off merch. But I’m glad you guys enjoyed my dogshit event hosted by old high dudes that have nothing better to do and trash musical performances.”  You’re still that kid that started YouTube making videos on FRED, weirdo.
Maybe fight bozo the client next,   because all you fight are closns

Flexing ones  ain't flexing hahaha
You deserve this bro ❤️
Do a reaction video to the fight like the other  🐐🐐
I bet you used that amount to suborn the ref lol
Wasn’t Ben already retired tho
Bro, your weak. Saying "who should I retire next" he was already retired. You called out an old unfit man to box, even though he has NEVER had a boxing match..  You wanted to BOX a WRESTLER.  Your weak, you need to pick a decent fighter , one worth watching.
How much did you pay ben
Congrats Jake!
Do corner McGregor

What’s that song called though
Why are they all one's, there only a singular hundred dollar bill in there. You can't afford at least 20's?
Fight was almost as boring as watching paint dry i would like to see you fight a big dog like mike tyson or floyd mayweather (maybe without paying off the ref) at least you got the title of shortest and worst boxing match
Jake Paul is gay
Stop pretending you’re Cleveland, cornball. You’re a rich kid from the suburbs of Westlake
It's all singles!
1 dollars lol
Retire my dad we are about to lose our home he’s 45 with a 75 year old back

I really want him to fight Bryce Hall. Bryce just needs to shut up and Jake needs to let him know that there can only be one villain on the throne💪🏿🙏🏾.
Winning
What’s the song tho?
Dayum singles!!! You know how many paletas I can by from the paletero bro👌👌
This fella need to retire that mangy haircut!

Why doesn’t he fight a real boxer
Mike perry will rip your fooking ear off
Flex
the only thing he has to flex with is money
35 million that you gotta pay the ref tho
Lots of $1 bills in that stack 😂
Why a whole bunch of $1 though!!
Wow 65 million looks a lot like 3k one dollar bills but what do i know im poor
"Who should I retire next?" His last two opponents were already retired. Before them were two youtubers. Edit: I take it back, the dude can throwdown. Congratulations on your win.
Jake I literally bid 50k if you won against Ben funky askren and you did now I have 100k, and that 50k was my mom and dad's retiring fee for 30 years in the same company. THANKS FOR THE WIN JAKE PAUL!!!
Now fight canelo pls i want to see this fight happen

Triller did a bad job, with the quality. And 2/3 of the entire event was terrible until jake fight started.
You know money talks. I mean he might be a bad guy but he puts his work in. I mean would you take a harder for fight for less money or a easy fight for more money.
Where is the rest of it?
fight danis next. end his big nose career
Would have actually been dope with $100 bills.  Looks dumb with one dollar bills.
Thanks Jake I made a lot of money off of your fight last night I knew you were going to win I didn't know it was going to be that easy but everyone forgets you've been training with some of the best in the world and some of the best sparring partners around for three straight years everyday luckily I didn't forget that and I put almost a months wages on you and you ended it so quick I never even had to get worried during the fight I appreciate that  homie 🤣. You definitely called it...

1.3MM is the conservative figure. Other estimates are closer to 1.45-1.5MM buys. Considering there was a free UFC event at the same time, these are crazy numbers.

The king of boxing and social media’s number one evil villain. Gotta give it up, props to Jake Paul. Still miss some of your acts during the “team 10” that every day bro era lol he grew out of that, still a pretty good troll. It’s hilarious how banks quit running his mouth and wanted to be friends with Jake, once Jake was gonna KO him, sam with that black kbi dude who wears a sweaty bandanna
All those one dollar bills.
Who remembers The SpongeBob Pranks aka his second video 🥺
Damnit bro your actually starting to win me over! Low key you are winning a lot of people over.

If you want Conor Mcgregor buddy you better fight a dude from the ufc that’s top 10 at your weight that isn’t a wrestler and actually beat the guy to even think your gonna get Conors attention and I got a dude in mind for you his names Darren Till
those were $1's lol

Did he win the fight
Now you’re just flexing I remember when you were a semi normal person
Song name

View count dropped cuz no one cares about this wanna be lmao
You're missing a couple 0's on those bills.
Nice
Thinks he is cool but probably using steroids two fight wouldn’t be suprised that why he won
Jake you should fight chael sonnen next he was talking a lot of trash about you and he picked Ben to win and he called you a nerd. He talks a lot of trash so he would be a good opponent and he has okay boxing so it would be a nice challenge you should knock out a chael next
Everyone saying those are 1's 🤦🏽‍♀️. Lmfao. (Congratulations for having VISION) First off Jake knows what he is doing. && If y'all really think he ain't got mad money y'all real stupid.
Haha, says he generated millions but dumps a bag of singles out...

Aren't those 1 dollar bills tho?
Now jake Paul  disliking ratio is finished
Next fight... Triple GGG or Saul "Canelo" Alvarez so jake try to K.O one of them or even Manny Pacquiao 😂🤣 now that would be worth of money
Sheeesh
First of all the man was already retired.... Secondly how about you actually box a boxer?
Ben came out of retirement?? And bruh is saying I landscaped for $10 .. wasn’t in Disney making money at a young age !?
Anyone else came here to dislike
Broke ass guy only dollars
Tommy fury
Only guy who made money that fight was snoop dogg, makes Dana bet 2 million, then has a private conversation to Ben askren 😉 Ben got a percentage out that bet 100%.. Fuck snoop that guy got pac killed..
one minute fight?  I thought you could only make it to 30 seconds dude.
What’s the song called
I want to much money
Song anyone???
"who should i retire next" - for context, "retire" actualyl means "pay off to go down so he can keep challenging higher people and get more money for higher PPVs"
chleba

Ben didn’t even give you his best lmfao... he just wanted his money and he’s out 🤣😂.
a bunch of $1's...bro wtf?  Why would you even poor them out like that trying to flex with a bunch of ONE DOLLAR BILLS?  You already got brain damage?  Yooooo....wtf
The 1 dollar bills though, the flex is real
How can you pull up ppv buys in 1 day thaught it usually takes about 2 to 3 days

Man these fights and commentators are pure entertainment. Keep it up!  🔥👏
How can you have a night that makes 65 million then flex with like 250 dollars
Yoo what’s this song name??
Although that was a great fight. I'm proud of you.
bro beat a retired old wrestler and thinks he just won the WBC title. what a absolute embarrassment to the sport of boxing, and combat sports as a whole! he will get dismantled by a real boxer, I suggest you fight Regis Prograis next lol see how that works out for you.
Fight an actual boxer. That's it that's the comment
I nooo it was alll about the money 💸💸💸💵💸💵💵🤑💰💵💵💸💸💵💰🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🤯👍🤐
Fight Adam Saleh
I see they put your percent you made in that bag
I get the clout grab like, great marketing. But whenever you decide to do another one of these, can you fight like someone good? There’s too many analogies here but I promise you, if I asked a horse jockey to play me in basketball— I’d definitely beat that horse jockey at basketball.  Come on bro, fight a boxer or someone who knows how to box at least.
I learned to stop buying PPV after the mayweather/Pacquiao fight. The fight is usually posted somewhere without much digging two minutes after fight
since you claim to be a professional boxer, then fight a professional boxer
Yo jake why you no do yt vs tik tok fight you should smash some tik tok fools
Why so many ones?
You deserve it jake all of it
Took minimal damage... you should be ready to go again real soon. Pick a better opponent. You didnt retire anyone... he already was smh
Congrats Jake!
What a guy got to do to get some money???
Paid for the match... when I logged in, it was over :(
Give me 10$ please😁😄
Fight tommy fury
Can I have money

Youtubers vs tiktokers  jake vs harry jowsey
Lol we know Jake rich but why he pull out with 1000 in singles
Who paid to watch disneys fight? Triller is Hollywood' at it's worst. Shame if you did.
Nice dollar bills. I'll box you.   Wanna fight a former champ? Come on dog I weigh 155.
you wanna retire someone right? so they should be boxing at the current moment correct. How about Gervonta Davis. Since your a self proclaimed elite fighter, this should be a nice bout for a "boxer" yea jake paul?
Job well done Sir! Thank you for winning! :) Next time your interested in having fun at that sport put me In the same ring for $ for the winner. I do like sports. You should just sign me up to the  team. Shalom
Jake give me $1000
I dare you to fight canelo, if you are a good  boxer.
You're still washed up, my chance will come to lay you out
Jake is the best boxer in the world ps. Can I have $100 please?

Boi, those are one dollar bills.
You should be in the YouTube vs TikTok fight.... and be part of the winning side which is the YouTube side
I watched it for free
He ain’t rich it’s just a lot of 1 dollers
1 dollar bills? I've seen strippers that bring home more than that bag.
Who should I retire next, lmfao you're fighting retired guys 💀
Who the fook is that guy? xD
Bro they all 1s 😂
Biggest finess in history
Fight an actual boxer!!!!
This video almost longer then the fight
I also used to landscape for $10 an hour.. fight?
Jake, stop thinking you're an elite boxer. You're getting too full of yourself. You knocked down the worst striker in UFC history, at 36 years of age. That DOESN'T mean you're equipped to fight Conor mcgregor. You haven't fought literally anybody with good hands. Youre fucking crazy calling out Michael Bisping and Nate diaz 😂 What a clown.
Love the 1s
Is that stupid or what trying to show off in one dollar bills what a idiot
Yes sirrrr 💪🔥
Hire me :(
Minecraft with the boys be hitting different for some reason
Jake Paul would you rather give me $10,000 or punch me in the face
I got 50$ from betting my friend👑👑

65 Million generated and he's flexing with a duffel bag full of ones and a single hundred. I guess his managers/accountants that babysit him wouldn't let him pull a million dollars cash out of the bank. Good on them.
IF YOU'RE READING THIS, YOU'RE MOMMENT WILL COME JUST KEEP GOING!
A lot of ones
they all $1 though haha
its true tho 1,300,000 x 50 dollars for PPV equals 65 million he just made hella bank
Never Doubt this man
You deserve to flex after the hard work you put in the last 2 yrs!!!!
On the real. Kelvin gastelum is most like on his way out of the ufc and fights at 185. That would be a great fight
Jake Paul x Gabriel Rosado ???
Good job jake Ben was 💤
Inspired 💯
Maybe one day you'll fight someone worthy
it’s low key time for everyone to stop praying on his downfall

Good job Jake! God Bless you and Ben too! Ben is a warrior and legend and you has tons of potential. Congrats on the huge accomplishment!🎉🎊🥳
He knocked out a old milk jug
Tommy Furry for sure
JAKE STOP DUCKING MA6IC🗣😂🤷‍♂️

Nah Jake The Goat

Yo retire me I’ll get my ass beat for amilli
now go fight a real boxer since you call yourself a "real pro boxer" you're actually a joke dude. 2 you tubers a basketball player and a ufc fighter coming off hip surgery whos been retired and isn't known for his boxing at all. stop acting like your tuff if you haven't even fought a actual boxer. and stop calling  yourself a pro its very disrespectful to the actual boxers who worked there asses off for years to become pro and fight real fighters you know something you haven't done once and you have the nerve to act like your a legit boxer
Ay man great job 👏 you know how to get that money keep it up forget the haters keep training and get that next 65 million or more 👍
All one dollars 💵
Fight a real boxer you coward!!
Just pick somebody who can fight next time around

Jake let's be real fight a striker,even as old as ben is mma he would have killed you no joke.I want to see you fight a striker there's plenty asking now let's see if you flex on them
All I saw was a couple of hundred singles and maybe a benjamin or 2
I like the fact he flexed with 1s. First time he didn't make me cringe in a while. Hope he gets more humble now and takes his big brother as an example
Canelo he whoop yo ass

Working Hard Feels better than Being Rich and Famous money is the route of evil. In the end times the rich will run to the mountains

No one : Absolutely No one: Jake Paul: I used to landscape for 10 dollars an hour
Love the way there all 1 dollar bills clown 🤡😂
jake paul your the king
I'll retire you 😘
I'm going to make a case for jake paul. I'm really happy that he won Nd I hope he keeps winning. I am saying this because the fight world is becoming kind of boring. You can count the amount of people with personalities and charisma on your hand. But jake is is literally trying to be hated, trying to be a villain. Which is really interesting way to market yourself. Thing is with Jake's situation is that because he is a villain you want someone to knock him out but at the same time secretly you want him to win because he's a villain. You want the villain to win because nowadays in movies the good guys always win so it's cool to see the villain win.
dats a whole lotta 1s lmaaaaao
Nice fix lmao fight a real boxer and have a ref that ain't paid off to stop the fight Early
I wanted Ben to win but still congrats
I just wanna see u fight FAZE TEMPER. I would say thats a challenge
My dude fight some real legends like canelo or ryan garcia for ryan he literally through the contract and he didn't sign it
they’re ones
when there all 1's

Jake Paul you will litterally be Remembered as a legend

BRO, maybe you wanna fight manny pacquiao it is a great opportunity to fight a legend♥🔥

Dillon Danis says he is down

Why did he do this with singles...
Bruh I think I seen my $50 on the floor right there😭😭
Fight canelo manny paquiao next
A real boxer needs to get in the ring next. Stop the charades already and let him in on one
One dollar bills? Lol

Congratulations you beat the worst striker in MMA history. And has been knocked out the fastest in MMA history also. Id like to see you beat him in the octagon.

if you that rich mr jake paul send me 1k rn
WOWWWWW, THAT'S LIKE $400!!!!!!!!! WHAT A FLEX!!
There all in 1s 😁
what's the song calledd
Purrrrr!
Too bad your bank holds it and your manager doesn’t it allow you to see the money
CA me🔥🤣
What is that about $400 in ones?
Why tf is he flexing probably $1,000 lol
Fire fight,. I thought you would knock him out but didn't expect it to be that fast lmao
So are you going to fight an actual boxer or are you still avoiding that? 😂🤣
Dude first you have 4 thousand in 1. If you pay 10 dollar a landscaper per hour is to low, because for cut the grass the range is 150 the size of your house and he finish in 25 minutes, for mulch an trimming is another price. Do your best the next time
My net worth is at $69k at the time of watching this video. It’s Sunday and I’m working making a small sacrifice today that way my love ones can enjoy the blessings of the future. Wish me luck
Bro more one dollar bills then hundreds
Well Play Jake Always Support You
Kinda sad how he doesn’t deserve to be where he is at all
Flexing with 1 dolla bills over ppv 😂😂 try fighting someone that isnt retired or who is a real striker you fight choosing bitch 😂😂😂 calling yourself a pro boxer is a joke to the sport of boxing
Damn that CTE hitting him hard, acting like a lil kid

This guy has said he used to landscape for $10 a hour 10 times every hour. Mug
Easy money! Excluding the hardwork
jake your a 🤡 Fight someone who can hit back.

whole lotta 1s
Why he flexing the 1$ tho

I mean is anyone impressed with his boxing? He boxed a chubby video gamer, a 5 ft tall retired NBA player and a retired out of shape average MMA fighter...
Fight a real boxer
Those are dollar bills lol
90% of that is $1’s
Ryan Garcia
congratulations that fight was crazy i was routing for you and i knew you were going to win
Ben got paid to lose because you need boxing for you’re career
because it was a fixed fight
1.3 mil ppv buys doesn't all go to you Jake
You could pay to get ya grass mowed
Fight canelo

Look at all them $1 bills I could count around $4,000
0:30
Bro their dollar bills tho😂😂
I knew he was going to win cuz Ben underestimated Jake power
I shouldnt even be celebrating when fighting amateurs fight a real fighter
when you use "I use to landscape for $10" as a sob story to make us feel bad
Flexing with 1s? Look like strip club time
His only logical next step would be to give an unknown youtuber a shot at his title! A real american underdog story, on 4th of july ! The problem child Jake paul vs James The One GunZ .. Sounds like a monster movie
Congrats but on the other hand flexing is lame
Ayyeeeeeee 😝😝🥊🙌🏆🏆✨
65 million why do I see all ones though?
Those are 1s I think :-:
It's one dollar bills 😂

He has worked for this. He said himself he used to do landscape for 10 dollars.
Wtf look at all the $1 bills!!!! 🤡 🤡

If anyone is dumb enough to pay for fixed fights between a guy who has no redeeming features to a retired dad bod then you deserve to lose your money, absolute idiots, this guy couldn’t win a real fight. Absolutely awful technique, yeah he’s in shape but his punches look weaker than his anus will feel in jail for the sex assault he’s accused of

If I gained a subscriber for every second Ben lasted in the ring, I’d still be under 1000 subs 😂
So now it’s definitely clear that your paid him to lose. U have 65 million you have a lot to spare. You payed him probably like 5 million
Congratulations Jake
What a legend
How do u retire a person that’s already retired?
Flexin with 1's 🥶

Jake didn't bring in 1.3M pay per views, he can't even get 100k likes or 1.3M views on every video, people paid to see the artists perform the majority of us watched for free on Stream East and other 3rd party sites.
Did he really won 65 million dollars just with this fight ? Coz ben only won 500 000 dollars
Tommy Fury would smoke you and end your 3 fight run of fighting bums that aren’t actual boxers
Idk why he saying “who should I retire next” like Ben was already retired from ufc 🤦‍♂️
let’s see how much subs i get from this comment  at 323 subs right now
For some reason he's growing on me
Congrats on winning I new itt
imagine flexing just ones
Congratulations Jake 🙌😭🥊
Big man tingz problem child takes no L's
Absolutely mental, say what they want you’re doing big things
A actual boxer
Bro your a scum bag over there flexing on people that have barely enough money to even afford a house
Let a boxer catch you in the ring
Omw to go rob Jake Paul of $65M
10 an hour landscaper to multimillion dollar boxer. I fucking love entrepreneurship....
10 years down the road he still hasn’t fought a boxer and challenges bill gates to his ‘ biggest payday’
Jake's next fight will be against Ric Flair.. he's gonna retire him next.
notice how they were all dollar bills but im still a jake fan lol
Yet there all 1$ dollar bills 😂😂😂
Reminds me of THE G.O.A.T, this Jake guy.
Anyone know the song?
What’s the song
Let him catch you in an octagon
Drops a bag full of 1s
R.I.P Jakes bodyguard
and 500,000 of those were paid to ben for the setup fight

That’s a whole lotta singles right there. All those “millions” but only like 5 of those bills were benjamin franklins. He’s trolling us lol. He’s gonna make more money from this video than the money he poured out on his lawn right here.

“Landscaping for 10 dollars an hour” you’re acting like you did that after your wife left you and you were left for dead. No. That was probably your job while you were in elementary school and probably high school as well. Stop acting like you came from nothing.
He is at the top of his YouTube and boxing career
Why one dollar bills I’m confused
So u can pay for my college tuition?
Let’s see if Dillon danis can’t put him to sleep

We get it man. You are blinded by money. To say you are humble is an understatement. But you wont take all that with you to the grave. Fight a real boxer instead of calling someone from their couch 🛋️
I been watching you since you did the 24 hour challenge in the White House, and now your a undefeated boxer
The grass needs cutting
You beat an retired Wrestler out of prime who trained to box for 3 months congratulations you’re the real deal, you should fight Steven seagal next
Y does he have one dollars
Those are all ones
Well done on the win, but step it up next time and fight a legit pro boxer. Only then will the haters give you the credit you deserve for the hard work and commitment you put into your new found talent
CHLEBA

It would be interesting to see this YouTube kid box against a real boxer or a good Mma striker. Maybe that way he will be taken seriously. He will never be taken seriously if he only boxes against non-boxers. Weaksauce.
Everyone is a jake Paul fan now 🤣🤣🤣
