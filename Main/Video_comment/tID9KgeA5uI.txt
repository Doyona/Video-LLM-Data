hola que buena fantástica, larga vida para todos
This song is so underrated m upset at the low views

This song will forever be a banger
This should've been her lead single...her trajectory would've been different.
Talented😊
that intro eatsss
she sexy
Funny how she's doing all of this and the Album flopped and she now has a strained relationship with her religious parents due to this new image 😭😭

Still listening to this underrated bop in 2025 😊❤🎉
Giving a little Janet tease ...
real bodies like hers should be celebrated home grown.
The beat 🔥 Chloe is versatile this as her debut album is not bad at all
I can hear ciara being featured on this
Still listening 🔥

HAPPY 1 YEAR TO THIS ICONIC SONG
Still my favorite Chloe song
This song is such a BOP I really don't get why it was not a single with an actual music video ??!!😢
Cadê o clipe com a Anitta mulher ?? ❤❤

1:05
Why was this not pushed to radio?!?! ❤❤❤
She had this in the stash the whole time n never released?????
dope🔥
this song makes me feel hot 👄✨
We need a remix chole & chris brown
Chloe - can you do a remixed rock version - I can totally see this shit going crazy with some spazzed out drums and guitars
Yesssssss !!!!!
Finally this hit 1 million
Ela é incrível ❤❤
ooh
Do you ever wonder like who else is fucking your man was the most Kunt way to open a song 😗
She is so good
This should have been her lead single 🤦🏾‍♂️
Yikes
I'm late, but I like this joint....
If u have to wonder bout him..then u need to leave him & come with me sweetnezz!😜
I hope somebody somewhere played this at a roller skating ring.🔥🔥🔥
I love that one
Love it!!
0:06   That opening line perfectly illustrates why Chloe's solo career is in the gutter.
this my shit 🤎
0:06
1:13 to 1:30 BEST part of the song. Who agrees??
Push her 🎶🎶🎶💯💯💥💥💥
Still can't understand why she didnt do this a full single with a mv
As a gay man that usually doesn’t find women attractive, Chloe is too damn gorgeous and beautiful. We must protect her! 😍
wished the album had this full vibe
علي
fingers crossed for a music video even low budget, like put it together girlllll
https://youtu.be/agSfTcPGxh4?si=2Dj8F_Ss8CoRinzt
This is good, if ha second album is full of this it'll definitely do better.
⚪🏠
This song is sensational.
Chloe, sorry this song has absolutely no substance to it. Soooo sorry angel 😇
No z.    Z z. Can 😅 the w
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
A Normani feat. Would be fire🔥 on this track🙌🏾
My absolute fave. She is everhthing
🎶🎶🎶🎶🌠🎶🌠🎶🌠🎶🌠🎶🌠🎶👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑🎧🎧🎧🎧🎧🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Chloe is definitely AMAZINGLY TALENTED! She gets a hard time because she is UNPROBLEMATIC! but if I AM correct....NO TROUBLE FROM SOMEONE IS A GOOD THING EH!!  I LOVE THIS VIBE AND THE VIDEO hope she does more songs like this and she is BEAUTIFUL and TALENTED OUT THE ASS!!!! She's a CANCER (Cancer females & Cancer males are VASTLY OPPOSITE outside of the emotional part. WOMEN can absolutely by nature handle emotions better USUALLY BETTER THAN MEN, keep that in mind!! PLZ it's very IMPORTANT to consider this with ASTROLOGY) and they are very emotional and sweet hearted people by nature & @ heart and LIKE AN ARIES (aka HALLE) very EXPRESSIVE! so what people see in CHLOE as DRAMATIC is exactly her EMOTIONAL DEEPLY INTENSE CANCER ENERGY! whatever you do to a cancer GOOD or BAD they will feel DEEPLY OK and EXPRESS BACK OUT TO YOU DEEPLY! Keep that in mind! (I'm an Aries and my BEST FRIEND and SISTER NOW for 20 YRS is a CANCER and I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT PICTURE MY LIFE WITHOUT HER IN MINE!!! WE GET EACH OTHER IN SO MANY WAYS, OUR SIGNS AND ENERGY ARE IN TUNE! super supportive and encouraging - loyal to the end as is an Aries (we get a bad rep and are so misunderstood by people IJS lol XOXO) Just handle them with care and only approach them if your INTENTIONS ARE PURE AS THEY HAVE PURE ENERGY AS WELL! if you bring them hurt that's what you'll get reciprocated back 2 YOU!!  Chloe is growing as an artist so, she can make a few mistakes. I give her grace! you become a ICONIC artist by making a few ERRORS along the way & GROWING FROM IT. It used to be (back in the day) us as listeners hearing a musician's albums, before social media & without knowing to much of their lives in being online, when you bought an album it was a look into their world and where they were at personally and musically, ALBUMS FROM ARTIST WAS MORE PERSONAL BACK THEN and we were just listeners like PASSANGERS in a car along with them taking the ride, relating and bonding at certain situations from song 1 to the last song! I miss that feeling SO MUCH!
Back to say this is a bop! I like it. This would be good for Halle.
underrated bop
I appreciate so so so much the warning because i am epilepsy and God knows i danm dont need seizures right now haha thnx big love❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just came here after seeing her doing a tiny desk concert with this song it was fire🔥🔥🔥🔥still is ❤❤❤
I love this song especially  when  she performs  it live and her album is amazing one day i hope to go to her concert and meet her
I do like the song but not the message it sends to our young women😢
Just you
Fav
Who ever pointed out the clap towards the second round of the hook/chorus, thank you. The attention to detail 👩🏽‍🍳 💋, now I do the clap too lol at the 1:35 mark
She is it!
She’s not picking the right singles. Thus should’ve been a single instead of those slow boring ballads. The one ft Chris brown is good though.
Nice disco song
MAKE IT LONGERRR CHLOEEE 😩💜
Miss u too
Going off on me
.
Here after the haters tried to tear this body of work Down.... because this girl Is an ICON in the making
😭 finding out she wrote this in 5 mins after finding panties in her man room is … wow I appreciate her so much more cause gurlll
😍🤘👏❤
NOW DROP THE OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO WE NEED IT SO BADLY THIS IS THE SINGLE FROM THE ALBUM!
a force that can only be described as supernatural entered my soul when i heard this song for the first time. thank you, chlöe for giving me a reason to wake up in the morning!
ok but the intro melody sounds WAY TOO similar to Beyonce's "Formation" 😭😭✨✨
She has so much talent fr I'm so happy for her 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
❤❤❤
MOTHER
this deserves so much more promo its sick.
UH UH UH UH UH UH
ARIANA WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Just hope it's another woman lucking your man, and not another man
Do you evah wondah
Chloe do hyperpop, i beg!!
WE WANT THE MUSIC VIDEO
A sleeper hit! I love the intro to this song so much 😂
I keep coming back for “you ever wonder like who else is f⭐️cking your man”😂
She ATEEE❤❤❤🎉🎉
Justice for body do! it was robbed of a prober video!
Chloe this is so good!! I have failed you for not listening to it before
Finish this
This my shit otw to the club. 💃🏽
If she remixed this song with Doja >>
My Jam!
I don't hear it on radio, social media, nothing! Hmm...I wonder why it flopped...let's take a wild guess!... 🐝🐝 it's my summer anthem either way!
This is so good!
Her voice is angelic and I love this song! I wish it were longer, it's so good!!
I love her music she is 🔥
Am I crazy or does it kind of sound like crystal castles in places
If she dropped an album like this it would be a BOP on the charts
No one makes music like Chlöe. No one!
Ciara on the remix when? 😂😂❤❤
This album is too good to be low budget. Chloe I love you and all but something has to give you just can’t have 10,000 copies sold in the last couple of days because of hater. There has to be more than that you, you should make a second l solo album to redeem yourself and make sue Beyonce is helping you because you just can’t be on a Beyonce label and release music under 3 or 4 minutes and release an album with poor sales. You should talk to  Beyonce make a song with your sister for the album idk do better queen love you❤😢👑👸
Essa música é tão perfeita, a chloe arrasa demais pqp❤
I love this song, she sounds so amazing. Happy 25th Birthday to the beautiful and talented, creative genius, Chloe! ❤🥳🎉🎊7/1/2023

All she had was her phone camera, led light strips, and a metallic 2 piece. She had 1 chance and she took it. This song is too cunt for the present time!

❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Could you imagine Chloe Bailey as Vanessa in The Little Mermaid remake instead of Jessica Alexander.😊
Another black girl dressed in skimpy clothes and showing her curves as every other girl out there... and sings sth it can't understand.... 🙄
Remix ft Nicki Minaj right nowwwww
Did she show love to Mis-teeq “Scandalous” 🫶🏼
Best workout song this year 🔥

Let's be real but her music sucks. She wanna copy Beyonce's style too. Chile, Chloe you can do better
Let's be real but her music sucks. She wanna copy Beyonce's style too. Chile, Chloe you can do better
Manifesting that DOJA Nicki ice spice ft
This song is a BOP
From the words to the disco beat and vocals this my might be my new favorite Chlöe song
I just find it so fucking crazy I came across you that one night. Then the way that it felt too ❤ idk but it’s fucking with me. And I don’t believe in coincidence either. I might be playing myself taking a real interest in you but at this point I don’t care. I know people just use me at times and it’s okay I came to the acceptance of it. I was made for it. Just don’t act as if there’s any chance of you falling for me or liking me, if there really isn’t. I’m here to support regardless just keep it💯 n I will too have a goodnight and bless up beautiful!
❤❤❤❤
atp we need a music video
I feel like it should of been have mercy,treat me then body do

I want a choreographic music video
From France Thanks to WQRB radio
Champ
My 2023 Gym Song!!!!!!
The next best thing
Chlöe and normani sing and dance collab
How did I missed this video???!    💖I love you Chloe!💖
You’ve healed my epilepsy
This has been my favorite song of hers to come out so far. I hope she makes more like this
I feel some Weeknd here. But her own.
This song is so fun 💯
i love this song🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I love it, it’s a hit 🎉
This is a jam. Make it a single!
I see a hot female/male rapper on the remix and it will definitely chart❤.....
YES!!!!
Love❤
I done worked out a whole dance to the song😂😂❤❤❤
According to me Body do just went to #1.
and this better not be the official video…
This song like a song from Beyonce's last album
The one time parkwood doesn't mess up
Remix Ciara will be dope
15.50 dollar video == a new silver-plated blow dryer purse vent-clutch,  lighter/torch/thrower, bubble-blowing,  Led light, BTspeaker, gun(gumball mini shooter.)&bullets.ok. & is a hand-warmer. Only charges on car battery.🎉
This song should be promoted more. An all-out music vid like Treat Me or Have Mercy, not just a visualizer. It's better than those two and has a catchy pop sound
She's so underrated, her talent derserves so much more attention
EEEEEEYYYYYYYYYY move your body, guysss!!!!
Chloeeeee do Hyperpop pleaseeee😩😩😩
Love❤
🔥 🔥
Missed opportunity for this video to be like the early 00s.. girl’s night out, getting ready, hitting up the club and finding someone new in the club, boom dance off between her and her girls and him and his boys, at the end she disappears and he’s left looking around in the club in the middle of the floor with his boys.. I think that would’ve made more sense coming next from pray it away. 1. My dude was cheating 2. I go out with my girls and find a temporary dude to subdue the pain
This songs is horrible, good artist but wrong song. The album will flop
When you can sing, there's  no need for the over sexual videos
❤
the only interesting song on the album for me personally (aside from that cringe intro)
The *beep beep beep* reminds me of BRIT BARBIE 😂 though. Not sure if you used her beat or she used yours? 😊
Find music by Nowiamfamous
girl push that one plz
This song 🔥 burns it all
This is one of my favorites so far in the album.
This is part of my workout music
A BOP
This should’ve been her first single
Can we have a remix with Doja please?
This should of been a real video and made a single
🔥🔥
❤❤❤
This video is obsession worthy.
❤❤❤❤❤
I just wanna be in the music video with her popping it back!!! 😫😭😩
FKA Twigs from wish…..
this is giving cheap tinashe
Should’ve made this a single
Naaaaaaah, the way the beat comes back in with her singing at the 40 second mark is INSANELY FIRE!!!!!!!!! I keep rewinding that part 🔥 🔥 🔥
I need a Tinashe collab!
why is the beginning giving Cupcakke 😭😭😭
I’m waiting for that Whitney album. Chloe… you have TALENT a voice of a generation you and your sister. Why lort haven’t you made anything focused around that. You have a voice that needs NO FEATURES yet hide it every time. If I didn’t hear you sang “feelin good” I would never believe you were capable of more. Your version of the national anthem bring tears to people eyes. Why we can’t get that… find yourself sis. You look uncomfortable or outta body when you don’t wear enough clothes. I’m just saying. I say it with love. I pray for your success always.
This baby girl and her sister are vocal masters and they play instruments. Real artist!!!!!
That body makes babies❤️
I don't understand why she is not pushing this song! This alone is a nightclub banger, pop radio all day play and it is super catchy. 🤷🏾‍♀️
The industry secretly stans khia .
Play it in 0.75X speed 🔥🔥🔥
Nicee 🔥🎵🔥
I don't know... Still not it...
👸💃💃💃🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤
Are y’all seriously tryna play Chloe like this ain’t that heat? Omggggg she’s talented af.
I can see Tinashe on this 😩
i wanna hear this at the club lmao
This video should have 1M+ views!
BODY DO REMIX FEAT MEGAN PLSSSS
Omg this song 🤩
woke 🩷🐰🦓
🥵
Remind me of Kelela Happy Ending
I love ❤️
Nah this should have been a single!!!
Why is this not  a single? Poor choices. First 10 sec I knew it was a hit. Remix with doja or Megan.
Her pocket skills are fucking top tier….. Go Chlo Chlo❤❤❤❤
CHLOE!!🧡💚💜💛💙❤️______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Amei a base e a letra ❤
Love you so much Chloe and you definitely ateeee hands down with this one 🔥🔥🔥💯
A DJ needs to remix this like they did with Coi’s song ‘Players’ an let Tiktok get ahold of it an this would BLOW UP! Literally overnight
Why is “Body Do” & “Looze U” the only 2 songs I was able To Enjoy throughout? The rest is boring. Where is treat me, have mercy, and surprise?!
Summer anthem 2023????? 💃🏾
Chloe, stop playing with us and give us the real video with full-out choreo ASAP! 😂😂 This song is literally a freaking HIT! It may take some time to catch on, but trust...this song is THE ONE!!! 💯
Idk why but this reminds me of Hilary Duff's "With Love"
this is soooo lady gaga the fame era vibe
I don’t know if it’s just me but .. this really sounds like something Ariana Grande could do and it would have been pushed more
Nato
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH YESSSSSSSSSSS
Easily the best song on the album ❤
I wouldn’t be surprise if the remix be featuring Beyoncé. Sounds like a Beyoncé type beat.
Is my man cheating 🤔?
I love Chlöe’s uptempo music the most 🙌🏽 this song gives me slight Ciara vibes ❤️‍🔥
Body do is a banger
😍😍
No cuz this that oneeeeee ☝🏽🤑✨💖💅🏽  she needs to collab with pinkpantheress!!!
I want her to do more songs like How does it feel. It seems like most of the music she makes is missing something. She doesn’t really have the type of voice that can cross over to pop. I think she should stick with rnb.
This song didn't need Future
She def snappeddd ❤🔥🔥
The song is really good and catchy ❤
This song is a sleeper hit!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Ok is this on the album? I wish it had more songs like this because what I heard although good not what I expected
Love it
She gives me Normani vibes.  Lots of potential, zero hits
ohh yes ❤❤
I WANNA SEE HER ON TOUR ❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ...   Love it especially the effect!!! 💯 😘 🖤
Tô viciado nessa música a melhor do álbum
She should just make edm music😍 this would go so hard with some minimal
This sing needs choreography and performances
Chloe, please remix this song with Anitta and Becky G!
This is a Beyonce moment 😂😂😂
Maravilhosa ❤
💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥
Which part a c breezy not bein a feature on thiis and thiis not beeing the single mek any sense, her team want a fist down 🙄😓👏🏾👏🏾!!! On another note guh deh chloë baby giirrrlll, song solid yuh fret 🔥🔥🔥🔥😓😓😓👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾!!!
I feel a feature on the remix 🌊
This is her best song IMO. A BOPPPP
Yall better BUY and stream, labels dont care about the streams Unless they see your coins too !
She looks so pretty!
This video reminds me of a 1990's 1-800 sexy hotline commercial. The songs a bop anyway
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Girl what the hell
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤔 alrighty this one’s not for me.
Body Do (Ft. Anitta) P-L-E-A-S-E!
Doja would’ve taken this to the top man!!!! Collab with her!!!
I love it❤
Let this be your next single. It's perfect for the summer that's approaching.
Sweet like candy 🍬
The music sounds like Glow from Nelly Furtado. ❤ Loving it.
This is an amazing song. Armon Wiggins was hyping it so I had to listen to it.  I think the reason she is  not bigger  (successful) than she is is  because she is pretending to over sexualize herself and people think it's fake. She should just drop that image and just make good music.  I dont understand why it was  necessary to start the song with " do you ever wonder who else is fucking your man" come on now. That's was tacky. I'm rooting for her.
I want a music video for this one
its the flute for me tbh
beyonce says yes
It's a no for me
me & my girlfriend. RIP pac. Selena ❤️ https://youtu.be/dvfZ95ueOcQ
Vibing & Dancing to this all day long 💃🏽🕺🏽🔥
BOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMNM
They should’ve been a lead single you need to do a remix to this I really like this song. This is your first album so don’t be discouraged. Are you so talented but you need to come up with your own style. If you did everything in this body do song, then that’s a good formula because I liked it and you had some other songs that I liked to. You don’t watch a whole album, the sound the same gotta have some diversity on the album
OK, family something different on the album I like this song body do because it’s up-tempo🎉
This is Beyonces updated version of Work It Out
Nice 🤩
Is that Halle saying “Yo body like this” ??
At this point, she doing some hot sphagetti on the stove and throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Girl,  please go away for a year or two and work on your sound
Favorite song from the album
Chloe BAILEY WHEN SHE NASTYYYY 💅 💅 💅 💅 💅
Stunning xoxo
❤❤❤❤
120 SECONDS ISNT ENOUGH FOR ANY OF US
Me likey! Good workout song! 🙌
1:31 The little clap at the end of this vocal run sends me every time. Girl is a genius
Where’s her marketing team? This song should be huge hit.
the only song i like on the album, this album is not i see chloe , everything is so slow and boring. I wish to few hype song like that but not happen , still she is amazing just not catch my mood this album.
🔥
This song is stuck in my head
It'll be played at the yt night clubs
Why do they auto tone her voice down so much why want they just let her sing she really don't need all that
By far the best track on the album, but I wish it didn't having the background talking
I Love this Song By Chloe bailey her New album
Chloe você é incrível e o in pieces ficou incrível ❤❤❤ o meu top 5 melhores do album é... 1 - Body do. 2 - Told ya. 3 - how does it feel. 4 - cheatback. 5 - in pieces.
🍯🍯🍯🍯🍯
❤️❤️❤️❤️!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Youre amazing Chloe!
🔥🔥 this eats
SLAYY BITCHH ! 🔥🔥
Love this.   Such a fun song.  The visuals were such a great fit and Chloe looks amazing per usual.
That second verse needed a female rapper what's commercial  not Sweetie I'm thinking Doja or something.. but if u wanted to go oj Eve or Trina
Body do do something to me...
BITCH THIS SONG IS SOOO  FUCKING GOOD
She might have snapped on this one
Now this is absolutely club music right here 🙌🏾
This shouldve been the lead single
We need a Tinashe remix 🔥🔥
Ate
i love thisssss 😍
*REMEMBER TO STREAM* ❤️‼️
I like the video the beat was good like it keep up the good work ❤❤❤❤
I think she just needs a better creative marketing team so sorry Doja Cat was blesssed as hell to find that team creative from videos all the way to stage performances and Chloe has so much talent behind the scenes people don't get enough credit Saweetie has the best team tooo imagine what Chloe can produce with the talent and a great team chile also for example lets use Megan Thee Stallion as a example her fashion looks on carpet sucked until she got a better stylist proof is in the pudding
She’s so underrated. Like why are people sleeping on her?!
Whew! This track is giving 90's Cathy Dennis and I'm here for it!
more song like this one please, also with the vocals YOU KILLE IT
🎉❤😊
Video was a little boring for me.  But she looked fine in the face
Chlöe 😎😍
I like her she fire though❤
I got this shit on loop. It's too good to be short. Get normani and tinashe for an extended version.
She Came out sex, sex, sex...
why don't people value this woman the way she deserves?  Chloe you are an ARTIST 👑❤️
I love this so much!!! ❤❤❤
Chloe this song!!!!! Listen cut a video with just dancers. This will be a spring bop!!! Get some drag queens that do the circuit to vogue to this. I promise you this would go viral!
🎉❤
Oshun
This is a BOP ! people were right about it !
Trump will be our savior.
https://youtu.be/O1rkx4bqq3Y 🚨
the chorus is so catchy!
no!
I can see this song having a remix with  Normani on it ❤❤❤
This song is masterpiece❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm a whole stud over here twerking
Who else is living for the Khia sample? The Tampa in me is extra Turnt hearing "pop your ___ like this" This is going to go hard in the clubs.
Fun record but crass intro makes it distasteful and a hard listen
i may be reaching ... this gives me 80s pop. i get heavy Shannon "Let The Music Play" vibes.
I like it it's a bopppppp
Do y’all realize that the intro is  just like Beyoncé renaissance song intros??? That inspiration showing
Fucking bop, love it so much ❤️🤩
The song feels loose🥴 not sure about….
YOUR BODY LIKE THISSs
Reminds me of Ciara
It reminds me of the EP just the two of us but grown and sexy 🔥
I love
This is cute but this song deserved an official video
Any song our dear Chloe does is extremely GOOD!!!! I love youuuu
THIS THE ONE
Ayeeeeee
Porque ela ainda não está no top50 da Billboard???
I'm here for it Chole🙌🏽Lets fuckn go Girl!!!!#banger💃🏽🥰💫💃🏽
LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR AN ACTUAL VIDEO, UNTIL THEN....REEEEEWIND!!!!!!!!! 🎧💿💿💿🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Chloe is the next Beyonce. Please stream her music

Chloe we want a POP ALBUM PLEASE
Where the bad btches at?!🫀✨🤸🏾‍♂️
❤❤❤👑👑
Tinashe * Chloe perfection ... conclusion
IIII LIKEEE ITTTT
Zelensky likes to dance to this  type of music.🫡
“Do you ever wonder, like who else is fucking your man?” 😂😂 I’m sorry but that got me 😂
She's in her own lane and I love it.
This song is bangin'. Can't wait to get the album Friday!!! 🫀❣️
자라에서 틀어줄 것 같은 둠칫박칫 노래
I  definitely hear Queen Bey influence
Thats more like it Chloee
This song is going to go so hard in the Ballrooms! I can just see the performances now 😊
she made a mv even for that boring chris brown feat and uploads a visualizer dancing with colored lights in front of a wall for this one 🤡
The beginning is killing me 😭
🔥Run that **** bacc!
Big Love from T&T 🇹🇹
Anyone else going to be at  in pieces house of blues Dallas?
🦀🦀🦀
Omg why is she slept on? She is so amazing! Most underrated artist. Takes certain songs to get me bopping and this did just that.
Cholesterol, for sexness, study young Janet Jackson!
Chlöe Bailey, you are really singing about this , like it’s cute ?  Why can’t a guy that is good to your soul also be good to your body ⁉️ Wouldn’t it feel better to your emotions ? This is gonna set you up to be messed up in the soul and spirit . Be honest , that’s what dating is for. You eventually are led to the right man . We are all grown here , and  it’s hard to believe you want  to keep or have a man that messes your head up and is heavy on your body and spirit . Soul ties are real and sometimes hard to break . I know a girl that still couldn’t get over her ex , years later . So imagine using someone for their body … Plus STDS … This is a whole mess . I’m not buying this message , Chlöe. Then you said you love the Lord , right ? Which Lord ? Women need to stand up and start to respect themselves . We are powerful royalty . Nah , honey.
This gonna be a SMASH!
So good! Adding it to Apple playlist!
Fireeee🔥🔥🔥
On repeat 🔥
I loveeeeeee yes Chole Cho
My chloe
Omg she tame it down alot....ok....i respect it...wooo...i thought for second...the hoe was whoring...i like this alot...so much better tame...lol...
I wish Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion were featured on this. Hopefully, Chloe does a remix with them on it. This song sounds perfect for a rap verse. Feels like it's missing something right now and I think that might be it.
All her songs have to grow on me, but once they do, they're on repeat
Crap
Fantastic 🎉❤
Baby PHUCK the charts. Enjoy the music. It’s not like everything on the charts consists of genuinely good music. We know that payola is why most of those artist chart with basic songs like Taylor and Ed. Hell even Cardi B trash music charts, but that doesn’t mean it’s good, nor does that mean that they have talent. Most of those chart positions are fraudulent. Y’all suck the fun out of everything when y’all bring charts up. Y’all aren’t A&Rs so why are y’all worried about a placement?! Enjoy the music!
I like this kinda like a beys blow .. definitely a beyonce type of track no wonder it was cleared
Ok Chloe girl!
When you are a hoe, you don't have a man
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Go Chloe! Go Chloe ! Go Chloe!
I honestly want her to be a Pop Star 😂😂. I feel like if she made Pop music she would stay on the chart. Even though she has R&B vocals. She has the star power of a POP STAR!!! Love this song!!!
Damn 😍😍😍
Boss
I love the song & the length doesn’t bother me… I just play it again 😂🔥
Please get a professional song writer at this point I am giving up. These are too short and honestly love the singer not majority of the songs or collabs…Chloe is better than what they are allowing her to put out for real!!!
Embarrassing
Where is the album at already hit after hit after hit and no album yet😮😮😢
I don't understand why Chloe hasn't found that hit record yet and why people are not so connected to her solo music. She deserves better
no talent only bo***
Great voice very pretty. Feels like she's too talented to have to over sexualize her video.
Parece um funk ou to doido
This album is gonna be her big break
My shxt!!!
It’s giving renaissance
This reminds me of 'Work' by Ciara
this will be in my playlist to SWEAT my soul out. keep it upbeat, godess <3
I literally have been waiting for this song and I’m not disappointed
this is a SUMMER hit!
❤
I’m so disappointed in her like a mother she not going no where In her career her album go flop she needs a better team these songs she releases are horrible the Chloe x Halle albums have way better music use that team for your single career and you will have a hit
Best believe I was shaking my ass to this all weekend 😂. Love it! Loved everything she has released so far, treat me is one of my favourites and was so slept on imo
Now I wanna go out 🪩🕺🏾
Muitooo boaaa🇧🇷
It’s giving renaissance
YEEEEES
I’m really praying these ugh single are a set up and all the hits are on the album. Cause i been really disappointed and i love her since “the kids are alright”. I hope Halle don’t disappoint me and give me real r n b vibes
Alexa doesn't  know  this yet.😢
Great Song and Video!
Perfect
I love This
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER ALBUM???🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 SHE DROPPED LIKE 40 SINGLES SHOULD'VE LEFT HER AND HER SISTER TOGETHER AND STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER A PROSTITUTE TINA AND BEYONCE SMH🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️
❤
This make me feel like 2003
Too bad you don't respect the body God gave you you flaunt it like it is a piece of meat. Please God help these children.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
listening to the intro part after watching swarm is very funny😂
Does she have anything else to talk about other than her body? Her body is not that amazing somebody needs to tell her that too. she ain't beyonce.
WE SEE YOUR SEXY DANCE----THUMPS UP
Go Chloë!!!!
New Beyoncé 😍
This song is the one. Chloe just needs a video and dope feature and Issa hit
She let's music take over her
I love the song much love from TANZANIA 🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿😍😍🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿😘😘😘😘😘😋
I’m obsessed
My opinion: This wasn't her best. She could do better. I just feel like she is trying to bring out music to fast. I feel like she should take her time.
This is very cheap
THIS SONG IS A BOP I CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE HATE IT
Give me 5 minutes to freestyle.
freakin love it
I don’t even listen to Chloe but this the first song I have on repeat 😭😭
I liked it. I think a rap verse from Megan would put it over the top
Chloe, you’re beautiful! And thank you for your hard work—putting out so many great songs in a short span of time!!!
Damn I'm amazed. This is an amazing song
This is 🔥🔥
OKAY I LOVE THIS CHLOE , You gotta Ft. @NickiMinaj In This One , I hear it FR FR 😭😭😭🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🔥🔥🔥
I like this it's a vibe🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Que perfeição ❤
Eh. Disposable
SLAYYYYYYY LOVE THIS ONE
Oh she did that! 😍
um, ma'am what was the opening line? can't relate 🤣 I like the song tho!
So excited!
Song is good but why are her songs so short?  Bring back bridges 😵‍💫
Obsessed with this song! ❤
Okay Chlöe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
♥
🫶🏼
Cadê o clip desse Hino?
Niiiice, the beat is fire!
Q mulher perfeita
Issa hit.
Chloe, you deserve so much better than this!!  So sorry to see how the music industry is making talented, young black women sing these raunchy, objectifying songs.  It’s insulting to Chloe’s talent to have her singing this garbage! Praying for you, Chloe and for all of the black women in the music industry!  #BringBackMeaningfulMusic
I really hate how beyonce is sabotaging chloe's career. This song should be in radio and billboard!!
we want doechii on the remix
I LOVE THIS
Viens en France ‼️🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
J’adore le clip‼️❤️
I need this one ft. Anitta, please
With that gorgeous face, that killer body, that gifted voice, and that talent for producing, she chooses to sing about “who’s fucking his boyfriend” and dances almost naked in every video. What a waste of talent. I don’t say she is wrong. I say she’s fantastic, and she is easily one of the best musicians of this generation, but her music choices aren’t smart, and the charts say so repeatedly. I wish she finds her way to the top without these sex-selling songs that aren’t showing who she is. The beats here are fire, though.
Love this!
Please make a music video of this masterpiece ❤
😩😩🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
This song is so good chloe ❤❤
I really love this women .. Top 3 fav artists by far. Michael Jackson , Rod wave and Chloe
THIS GAVE MY FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE...I BUMP THIS STRAIGHT ON REPEAT FOR 2 HOURS...GET IT CHLOE 🔥👑🏆
I know different budgets, but this could of been a bomb ass video
It could be a better video actually. If this was a Beyonce song this video would have way more bodies bodying
This song is super dope ! Great job !
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
QUEEN!!!!!
Queen!
❤
Brazil <3
🤡🤡🤡🤢🤢🤮🤮
Nah cuz this song is about be on repeat
Is it TOO LATE now since the lead single HAVE MERCY came out 1 year ago!!!! And all FOLLOWED SINGLES are not hits even those assisted with CHRIS BROWN AND LATTO.. CHLOE has the same path with AVA MAX.
0:55 and 1:50 🔥🔥🔥
This is it Chloe. I’ll be supporting. I relate to you and your energy
This HYPERPOP/R&B Club Banger and no one can convince me otherwise…
Come on this ain't it!
MEU DEUS ESSA TÁ MUITO BOA QUE TESÃO
REMIX VERSION WITH BEYONCÉ PLEAAAASE 2 MINS. IS NOT ENOUGH
Storms done it again
Love this one
As being a older guy and watching Janet Jackson  grow. This song has that same vibe of her song Control. I can see this being a classic for Chloe. She's definitely a ARTIST.
Jesus Christ !!!!!!!!!!! see you at the top ❤🎉😅 Americus
Treat me was my most played song last year. I can see this doing the same come December. It's so addictive.
OMFG!!! I JUST  ARRIVE DRUNK, I FOUND,     GOLD THIS SONNNG!!!!!!!!
😢 It makes me sad to c such talent go to waste. I couldn't even finish this video. When are these women going to understand that these men are Not theirs. If a woman can get to someone in ur life, the man had to let them do it. It takes 2. A deal has an offer and an acceptance. The woman is not a B ur man is... keep it real and plz stop looking so thirsty. These artist get out here T&A and want sympathy when they have stalkers who want to hurt them. Take responsibility and realize that men will take from whomever is giving it. Too many women on a thirst tip and men will naturally agree. Not urs it's everybody's. Smokin out da window listen to it, it's factz😊😮❤
What is wrong with everyone dissing chlöe for her hypersexuality. Literally almost every female artist shows of their body.  What is wrong when chlöe does it. Didn't SZA show too much in her  SOS era. Like WTF is wrong with y'all. If u don't like the song, leave it for those that do.
Mulher,para pfvr
This needs a high energy dance video choreography. Wish the song was at least 3 minutes. Still love it ❤❤
Another flop for her
Love it😍 I love this sound
Real artist ❤
Visualizer......I don't need an official video. Trust, this all I need.....I'm so good w/ putting this on repeat.
This made me pop my ass and twerk yessssssssssss she need to do this live and this a hit
I like it slowed down 1 ❤
This is so beautiful
This videos hurts to watch lol
I can tell Chloé has been listening to Lolo Zouai. Those who know know
Nelly furtado written all over this song. I like it ❤
*I'm upset that I don't like it I'm upset that I haven't liked a single since for the night*
I love this e OMG🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
I wanna hear this song in a show like euphoria
Go back to sleep Marissa.
❤❤❤
I want to marry her voice
ITS GIVING RENAISSANCE
I think Chloe will kill the dance charts… kinda like what Kelly did
i loveee this
I love it ❤
So beautiful inside and out. Creative and hugely talented. Much continued success and happiness to Chloe. 🎉
YES
Yesss Chlöe time for us humble sweet ladies to talk our sh!ttt💖
#𝒫𝑜𝓅𝓅𝒾𝓃!😜❤️‍🔥
Não sei pq, mas já pensei em um remix com a Anitta
I smell a hit
Her whole album gonna be 30 mins with these short songs😂😂
Ate down
Chile this album gonna be 10minutes long with all these short songs
😍😍😍🔥🔥
if ciara remixes this it’ll be ovaaaaa!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lawd she's fine...
Imagine her and Halle on this together. That would be so iconic 😭
Love this young lady been with you from day one mama🥰❤
wish this is the lead single
Here before this blows up…
Girl why wasn’t this the lead 😩😩😩 I love it
Oooooo yesss I can swing my hair to this‼️
Chloe and stefflon don would eat this up together ❤ 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Vocalsssssss!!!!
Foda!!!!
not feeling this one. I normally love her stuff but her last three videos weren't really good. She spends too much time trying to show off her body rather than displaying her talent. The Chris Brown feature wasn't good on her part either, and the song was too boring. This video was even more boring and the epilepsy thing was pretty much pointless.
THIS ONE OF CHLOES BEST SINGLES
First listen: like this. 👍  Lol. This matches the Chloe x Halle sound I fell in love with on their last album.  Doesn't sound like "'Empire' music,"  either.  The cheap video is cute. It matches the club music I listened to in 2022 and 2021.  I made an embarrassing music video to one of my songs back in the day with a strobe light. This matches.
Perfectc song 😍
So nobody finna post the lyrics?
Ayyyiiiiiiiiiiii
Umm yeah No
i'm so obsessed ♡
I will never get over the hypersexuality. I said what I said...This is not what Chloe should be doing in music....
Another song wasted with less than 3 minutes?! Don’t release your album Chloe if we only get this short time of song?! 2 mins really? 😂😂😂
For the official video, I need you to break out with an OLE NASTY routine. Show the Gworls who Mz Chloe Bailey is and that you’re not out here playing any games. ❤❤ love this
Can't wait to see you perform this in Detroit !!!!!!
Ok, this is a BOP!!!!! 💃 💃 💃
This sounds like a Chris brown production
I like it.. and I’m not a fan.. this looks natural.. maybe that sex scene broke her.. she looks sexy and comfortable in this one, not like she’s trying.. seeing the woman finally
Loveeeeeeeeeeeee❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥹🥹🥹🥹
CHLOEEEEEE🔥🔥✨✨
Waiting for the album of this goddess✨✨
A Ministra do Tesão ataca novamente! Que delíciaaaaaaaa 😩
Out of all the Chloe songs I’ve ever heard, I like this the most
She's the future beyonce 😍😍❤️❤️
Wow now this is something hitting different. This beat the melody the harms omg 1st sing of hers I'm actually feeling. She did that hee voice is astronomical. Just waiting for the right song from here and this may be it for me. She needs official full out dance choreography and production for this video.
I like this 😍
Her songs are the type that become hits in the future and someone will call them them retro. I’d like to see her do ballads that hit like Whitney and Mariah.
Oh this a bop here 😮
The Sound Edits Where So Mind Blowing 🔥🔥
Video sucks but good song!
American piece of shit.
She should do a song with don Toliver
Yyaaaaaaaaaassssssssss😊❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this! ❤
One day we’ll do music together!!! Love you Chloe!! ❤
Sound like an older song but can’t put my finger on it
Here before a million views!!! this definitely heat🔥
🔥
I was shaking and Twerking the whole vibe
It's giving an ace of all sounds imma need a remix tho to make it longer maybe meg, doja, doechii, or even jt they'd eat
She get fat in the stomach
I love this song from her recent release I wish this song was longer.
This song has so much potential to be a radio hit
A hit!!
🤔
If Bey or Nicki was on this>>> like this is a 100/10 but like imagine 🫣
Yes!
Certified bop. This is a yes CHLOE.
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chloe biggest hit is have mercy everything after that just not matching the same energy as that song
(00:08) "...phucking...." Click. Bye bye.
this is talent friends
i want songs not jingles….Under 3 mins?
Queen
Pqp q perfeição ❤❤❤
Something about this reminds me of “America Has a Problem”. Idk why. I really like it though 🔥❤
Ahhhhh!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
STOPPPPP CHLÖEEEE!!!🤯🤯🤯🤩🤩🤩🤩 ESTO ESTÁ BRUTALLLLL💯💯💯💯💯📈📈🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great song for the gym
Thank God this wasn't the first single you released from the album. Hmmm
Yes Chloe Girl I love This Energy of this song it’s so sick ! Holy crap dude this was the first song I listened 2 from your album coming out next Friday and this got me HYPED YeS I’m so proud of u sm girl you’ve been AMAZING! 😻🫶🏼✨🤭💕😍😮‍💨☝️😛
Chloe I had to come back and leave ANOTHER comment to let you know. I have literally had this track on repeat since 6am it's 1:30 pm my time now. DO NOT LET ANY HATE COMMENTS MESS WITH YOUR HEAD!!! THIS TRACK IS ABSOLUTE FIRE!!! Your BOYSSSS are DEF WITH YOU. It's giving MODERN ERA Janet "Pleasure Principle".... One of the adlibs in the background even sounds like your saying POP YOUR BODY LIKE JANET... 😊😊❤❤❤. LOOOVE IT!!! KEEP GOING, DON'T STOP!!!
Wowww 😈😈😈❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
more Chloe Daily🥰
I think Ur  Talented  Period. Ms C.B.  Just keep making great hits!!!  Do whut Cha like. Best Wishes, Elevation, Elevation Peace foe sheezy 👍🏼👍🏼..
This is masterful! I love it, how can I support you, Chloe? You are the next generation "IT" girl. I love it❣❤❣
Wow excellent chloe you ate that 🔥😍
She is so talented. Not even one bad record.
I want FKA Twigs featured on this 😩❤️
Don't chew my head off, but it sounds like 'AMERICA HAS A PROBLEM'. If you really know music, then you know it does.
Maaaannnn this a bop 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the roll out for In Pieces! 🫀😍 I will have a song with her one day…manifesting it! 🙌🏽💓 Thank you for inspiring me!
Workout music might be her lane. Especially with production like this
The gays going to vogue down off this bop. Let's go Chloe we been waiting
as a long time cholexhalle fan I think Chole's new music isn't resonating with me because her aesthetic & sound feels commonplace. She get's lost in the noise. Hopefully, as she develops as a solo artist we get something fresh and unique. She's too talented to be wearing and doing cookie-cutter stuff.
THIS WAS A TEASE because I'm still waiting to hear more 🥴. This can't be the FULL song? This new thing about doing short songs as a way to get streaming #s up is annoying as hell. I will listen to a 3:45 or 4/5 mins song, etc
Yes mami
When she uses this song to open for Beyonce on her Renaissance Tour>>>>>>>>>>>
love it
Let's keep on streaming body do
There is great potential for a bomb ass music video for this. She needs to take some inspiration from Janet Jackson and Britney Spears.
All she do is BOP
Chole has came along ways you can tell she was meant to be a star ⭐🙏👸☮️🤗🌹💯💪🌼💅
BUT THIS GOES, THO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is FIRE!  Adding to Playlist asap❤❤❤❤
WE need a mashup with « My neck, my back » Khia ! Chloe ATE once again guys ❤
This song is fire
Yes. YES MA'AM this ass finna SHAKE
how come this is just a visualiser? she served!
❤❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉 let's goooooo!!!!!
Girl you're voice is too amazing for songs like this
I’m so happy for this project and to see you next month. Let’s fucking goooooo❤
COME ON QUEEN
00:34 this part is soooo satisfying
She acts just like beyonce just more thirsty.
Chloe so gorgeous ❤😮‍💨😍😍
This a hit 😮‍💨♥️
the choreo is gonna be sickkkkkkkk
Oh she ready for us to dance 👀🎯🎯🔥🔥🔥
Ok. So, you're basically telling me that this is the best marketing of Chole Beyonces label could do from the start till now?  You cannot tell me someone with as much experience as Beyonce is clueless to the constant flops and pushback and roll outs from now. You can't tell me that this is the best that can be done by Chole. Slowly but surely, even those who actually like her music will start to fade because of the catastrophe of the oversexualized lyrics and display. This is a vain world and sex sells but believe it or not, its not for everybody and everytime chole steps out doing all this flashing around, you can painfully see that its not for her. Another one gone. Another soul for Satan. I use to really admire her and Halle when things were less of a pandemonium. Chole, you're better than this. You two use to stand out but you're lost amongst the others. SMH.
Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwee THIS! “LIKE THIS”!
😫🔥!.
Unpopular opinion, Have Mercy, Treat Me, and her songs like this are my least fave. 😬 I wish she made better music like Surprise and For the Night. Or even when her and Halle were together i feel like that music was better. The visuals are everything tho! 🙌🏾
I like when artist which up their sounds and music you can't say all her music sounds the same
THAT INTRO IS DEF BEY INSPIRED.😍 Chloe girl this a BOP♥️♥️♥️
Produced by me <3
Amazing song 😍
😍😍😍
Not good
Omg I love this song 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
PERFEITAAAAAA 😍😍. IN PIECES in 1 week🎉❤
This is so good!!!!!
I need a Chloe, Normani, Ciara, and Nikki collab ASAP
This should’ve been for Ciara
Chlöe😍🔥😍🔥😍🔥😍🔥
So, I think the under-two-minute songs are strategic. It’s digestible and  has replay value when the songs are short. Back in the 70s, some songs were 9 minutes now we are at 2-minute-30-second songs
Okay, I actually like this! ❤
This should have been the first single girl! I really like this song! 🍀🍀🍀
“Do you ever wonder, who else is f*cking yo man” 🤣🤣🤣
For a video I can imagine a school dance battle
queen
This goanna be a hit, praying praying praying 🙏🏾 this is one her best radio friendly hits so far. Catchy addictive and easily digestible for social media. I’m praying this one does what it needs to do for her✨❤️
BETTERRRR😍😍😍😩 yassss Chloe
We talk about her talent when can we talk about her hits I absolutely love ❤her #chloe’ she can do no  wrong for me
I love her versatility in her songs. She literally has a vibe for every mood
love you chloe
🔥🔥🔥🔥 bad !
I'm so inlove ❤❤❤❤
Wowww dont expect she making this kind of music after have mercy and treat me.. shes deserve a place in the music industry. So diverse
Chloe needs to do some house music vocals. It would be fire
Chloe eu te amo, sabe, obrigado por tudo
This is a Visual not a Video people get that straight first then you will be fine
I love the ode to Mariah Carey’s Weakness of The Body! Beautiful sample. https://youtu.be/hIBZ9Cul2X8
❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thy amo
bem rasgação ameeeeei
THIS IS THE ONE YALL
Definitely adding to my work out playlist
she lowkey sampled khia my neck my back with the" pop yo body like this" melody...yass
🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍
🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
It’s giving extremely low budget.
We gonna have the whole album out before we even get it 😂
🔥❤️
Smashed it!!
This is my absolute #1 favourite song from Chloe! The sounds is so lit!!!🔥
Absolutely wonderful!  I was taken to a sound and i can't shake saying that I feel like The Weeknd should try to hop on a remix. I can feel chills thinking of them 2 on this song
I live for Chloe’s music for sure, it always makes you want to shake it fast!! 💨
I need Meg on the remix! 🐎
I still say this young lady is very very talented she's young but a force to be reckon with i say keep doing your thang Chloe f the haters u good darling u and ur sister to be honest people gonna hate no matter what so Damm if ya do Damm if ya don't so keep doing u u gonna be alright.....
OMG I love thisssss!!! This is so catchy and 🔥🔥🔥
começou com ela gemendo então a música é boa
CHLOE BODIED IT AGAIN ❤🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How does it feel with Chris Brown is the best so far. This is….. erm
Fuego!🔥
I love it. I am hearing a Kia sample and it does remind me a little bit of Tinashe’s two on
Lights,cameras and action is all Chloe needs to make a video..the last shot is a smile that I have never seen before🎉❤❤❤
Its a you wish you were me bop I'm here too I see you just play on loud ull feel good about yourself
I looooove this song!!! ❤
NIce!
I just want a love song ballet from Chole that really shows her vocal range. An Adele type song. I really think a song like that will do well.
Ms Bailey please continue producing and writing your OWN music..this feels incredibly and authentically YOU. Love it!🔥🔥👏👏👏👏💐💜
queen
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💞💝💕💖💗💓💘💙💜
You ate this one bestie
So this is cute. Not sure of the video concept. I hate to say it but I feel like this song has lots of potential but not without a feature. I can hear cardi b on the remix of this. But it wouldnt make sense unless its doing numbers first. Unfortunately, I dont see it. However, its a fun flirty song and she delivers on the vocals always. The words however werent clear and was giving sza.
Why doesn’t she dance 💃🏿 in her videos 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Song needs to be longer 😢
I need the lyrics 😢😢 I can’t make out what she’s saying
❤❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
So sad that they got to sell the body and soul for fame and people are so entranced by half naked women and then these are types of women that want men to respect them
Is anyone else fantasizing about Chloe and FKA Twigs collab? 🥰  This is giving me
ELA SÓ ARRASAAAAAAA ❤❤❤
I loved it
This definitely my new gym SONG 😭
a bop 💃💃
I loveeeee thisss, it gives me a scrapped song from  Renaissance
Longer version probably for club mix but catchy song. You can workout too. Vocals on point 👏
QUEEEEEEENNNNN
Ela só tinha um conjunto e um leed 😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰
She eats all the time ❤
Halle is here!?!?😭🔥
nossa,to apaixonado ficou fodaaaaa
🙏🏿
obrigado,isso e perfeito
entregou tudo
perfeita
meu deeeeeus
This is the same song that’s in the TikTok when she collaborated with beats!! ❤❤❤
Truly a Bratz doll brought to life and she's magnificent
Her Voice is EXTRAORDINARY!
TEAM CHLOE,STAY REAL!
Thisss a hit 🔥🔥🤞
AMAZING 🤩🔥
Luv all your music !! Can't wait for the album
YES CHLOEEEE !!!!! she’s coming 😭🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
You should put a rap girl in it ❤️
IT'S A BOP! 🎶💃
Art is subjective!!  ATP CHLOE really cannot please the mass. It’s an issues with her doing a sex scene because it’s raunchy and she too good for it. When she on stage she doing too much. Now because the song is too short for some that’s a issue??? How y’all gone say she needs to find her sound when she has clearly showed us her sound over and over. If you don’t like her music just say that! We know she can blow, however as fans or the general people y’all want to limit her capabilities to what y’all liking is. The crazy part is, in my personal opinion. This song is fire regardless of how short it is.
Yeesss!!!❤❤❤ this is the one I had even waiting to hear!
So is ever song on the album going be 2 mins 😭????
We need a remix! Call up Doja immediately 😭😭
The verse sounds NOTHING like I was expecting love it 💙💘
Love this…. Keep streaming!
This shxT is BUMPIN’ & it came out on a Friday ? See y’all on the dance floor tonight
“Do you ever wonder who else is fucking your man?” That’s toxic af…😂😂😂
Yaaaasss omg I can’t wait to see u in Detroit ! ❤
I actually don't like this song or this sound ... it doesn't sound top quality like her other singles .. this is the worst song I've heard from her
Oh she killed this song 🔥🔥🔥 beautiful.. wish It was 5 min long  ❗️❗️
I love the song but don’t like the video. I’m liking this because of the song.
This is cool. Wishing for a signature, simple dance move she starts that everyone could put in their reels or TikToks.  Side note, Chloe been in the gym. Body is right!!
FIRE on 100 ! 🔥on💯 !
We need more minutes to your songs ma'am 😩❤️😍🥰
This album gonna be like 15 min long 😂😭
❤❤
I wana know how all her fat goes to her legs and her stomach is perfect
Nowiamfamous songs are betta 😮
I like it, it kinda sounds like a Ciara song to me.
She deserves to be a star
❤️❤️❤️
So very beautiful hair
Would be a cute interlude
Could've  done without the glow in the dark video, her voice can carry itself.
I'm in love😍😍😍❤
I know that’s right 🔥
I love how the first verse starts
I love this giving early Ciara vibes dance
I'm obsessed 😍😍😍
Não decepciona nunca!! ❤❤
Only insecure women worry about that
This was a perfect song i hope everyone thinks and love it
Why is it always the good songs that's the shortest
YIUUUP THIS IS THE SINGLE !!!! This is the one I was waiting for
I’m ready for next Friday!!!
This needs a rap verse or something too short.
Melodically and production-wise it reminds me of Tove Lo, in a good way!
🎉❤
Its giving renaissance bonus track😏
She's trying too hard but it ain't working ,  T     R     A    S   H 🗑
YOU ARE THE MOTHER!!!
I hope the songs on the album are more similar to "Treat Me","Have Mercy" and "Surprise". These songs got me so excited for her album.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Album is about to be 35 mins long 😅 Chloé music is all over the place. I can't catch a singular vibe.
Ok this is a bop idc 😁🔥
Essa tem q ser hit!!
I can hear a Beyoncé remix frfr ❤🔥
I'm putting dis on my playlist on the go 😏😂
the Best since Mercy....  Normaly  First single Mercy   second Single Surprise    and finish with a spectacular cinematic movie clip guest Chris brown   intro How Does It Feel  simple sensual emotional drama cinematic  mindle  Body do with complex choreography expressive classy expressive  movements outro  Pray It Away for finish  with advertising for introducing the album 💥
this is BEYOND
“Wondering who’s fucking your man” if you’re in that situation LEAVE YOUR MAN … Smh these struggle ride or die relationships
I like this one
❤. You got me wukking up in the car girl. Yuh making my body do
I'm waiting on some classic hits from Chloe. This okay but her songs are not classics looking for better songs 😔
Literally SUCH a bop omggggggg I cannot wait for this album

Hot
🔥🔥🔥 it will be played in the car all spring and summer!
Please do an extended version 🙏🏾
Amazing! 🎉❤
That fucking hook! Idk wtf she was saying in Verse 1 BUT THAT HOOK…..I wanna throw ass

Why do I feel like I have been vibing to this song forever
Ok I’m feeling this but is this the actual video? Just asking.
Can't wait for the album to drop 😭😭

G.O.A.T🔥🔥🔥
Track is fire 🔥🔥🔥
trash music.

LOVE
Perfect Chloe
Chloe we know you can do 3min songs
Very proud of you. People hating and the general public won’t get you and that’s okay you doing you and experimenting the way you want will get them to not listen but it will strengthen your supporters and the people that will find you and love your music and performing and art
🔥 love you Chloë
Thumbs down! Trash music

She got sex scenes out now she bout to bust it wide open😂😂 get it then
So is her whole career just gonna be her talking about sex? I know us ladies are proud sexual creatures but there’s more to you than this girl come on.😒 I wish you best regardless. 🙏🏾
I’m tried of 2 and half minutes as song
I mean, this is nice whatever you know but I know people that have epilepsy and I’m just trying to figure out why you would even produce a video that would cause a person with epilepsy to have an episode. Sometimes you just do things that you just need to stop doing like what are you trying to do you like having people hate you?
i love thisssssss omggggggggg😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😩
🔥🔥❤️
This needs to be longer 😩😩😩
❤❤❤❤❤
Sis you ATE !!! ❤
This hard
I would love to see her do a hyperpop album one day, I know it’s unlikely but she would absolutely slay the production
Boring
Ms. Bailey. ❤🔥🔥❤

Doja will be the remix

Great work out song!!! This definitely gonna be a summer jam!
i have a feeling everyone who doubted the rollout of the album AND your musical artistic abilities will finally eat their words when it drops. i’m so proud of you chloe, talent is all over you and they can’t wash that away FOR NUNNNN 🗣️🫀
It’s giving Janet Jackson! Love that!
Banger!❤️
OMGGGGGG THIS IS THAT SONG FROM THE ADDD !!!!! I thought we were never gonna see it love it!!!! U ate here

It's a bop 🥳💃🏽💃🏽💜
Damn you sound &  looking GOOD AF 🔥❗️❗️❗️
This is so good and the visuals are on point 🔥
Her music might not be chart friendly yet, but she does have bops. Have Mercy, Treat Me, and Surprise still live rent free in my head and dance routines!!!!
i need this on cassette tape. going BoomBoxin tomorrow
Can’t wait for your album sexy 😍🔥❗️
Why is the song still under three minutes? Love it though Chloe
Chloe Chloe KLOW-AY!!💥💥💥 I love URTHANG about this song and video!!! You  are NEXT LEVEL❤❤❤❤
Damn, it’s so intoxicating. It’s sexy af, but not in a in-your-face kind of way. Love it!!!
oh bitch gonna make me drop it low and roll on the floooooorrr
This is giving me the female version of JT's 2006 "Sexy Back" at the half century 2050 mark and I'm here for it!!
this song is giving Renaissance vibes and I love it
This sounds like something!!! I can’t put my finger on it! Not sure if it’s Ciara or Janet Jackson but I will figure it out! ❤
I love the song, you already know it's going to be on repeat all day every day
I hope someone does a mashup with America Has a Problem…they’d go together so well.
Chloe I love that you’re doing your thing but never/don’t let a label push you into just being or being a sex Symbol
She's one very underwhelming artist so talented but the generic songs 😢
I'm only hearing the beat
new song to feel great about myself to ❤
This is a vibe
Its definitely giving Cancer season baby i cant wait for this summer, windows down Bumpin this album 😍😍
“Do you ever wonder who is fucking your man” CHLÖE!!! I’m thinking this on a daily & I don’t even got a man! 😩 anyway the song is FIRE I CLAIMED TRACK 3: BODY DO 1ST!
BOPPPP
I need a lyric video because huh
@ hate comments tell me you’re jealous without telling me you’re jealous 🤷🏻‍♂️🕺🏻 this a bop!!!
LUVVVVV THIS! SHE SO MVP FOR THIS!🔥🔥
This is very genre bending! It could be pop at times it gives some Dance/electro vibes and the melodies sound a little RnB
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙💙💙
I miss when she used to make meaningful music with Halle lol
🎧🔥
I press the repeat button when it's short to enjoy the 2mn28s songs. This one is fire Chlöe can't wait for the mv and the album. You're THAT girl ! Love you !
Having ear orgasms over here. This is 🔥 🔥
fire song 🔥
❤
The gay clubs will eat this up
20, 40, 80 out the trap! Hit it wit da rap! Put it on the map! Then we right back! 🕺🕺🕺 **pops booty**
Yaaasss!! 👌🏽🔥🔥🔥
the thumbnail: 👁️👄👁️
This would've been perfect on swarm like 🤯
She's gorgeous
This album is going to be fire. Three songs released and their all bobs. Cannot wait for the rest ❤
I so love Chloe and I'm glad she is blind to negative comments!!!! Goooo sis❤❤❤
Never do it again ... make a song under 3 minutes because WE NEED TO HEAR YOU MORE BABE😭 YOUR VOICE IS DIVINE
I'm confused Chloe. What direction are you trying to go with your music? This is much different than your last song. Giving Renaissance vibes
This gave me a whole new life!!! Ayeee!!!🙌🏽❤🔥✨️
MA’AM Ma’am Madame I am beyond tired and sick of your shit but I love every second of it ! Keep going mama we see you ❤❤❤
This is the hit
I love this song!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lil Beyoncé
This is giving Beyoncé renaissance
Dang. This goes hard. Club banger right here. WHEEEEW. Chloe! You're the hottest.
FYAH
okayyyy i love disss.
Will still stream this and buy her album. But the songs have been such a disappointment, with this one being such a skip. Omg. 😭 I can't believe this, she's too talented and her discography is too good for this.   Maybe, this is really her music style when doing it solo and she tries to follow trends (but still hasn't found the right formula for a hit).
An icon I tell you. 👸 👑
CHLOEEEEEEE SO EXCITED FOR THE ALBUM
Chloe you are so beautiful 💎❤️🌹
very cool song but i wish she wasn't constantly portrayed as a , lets say "night walker"
She wanna be Beyonce so badly..trying too hard
Love chloe so much but this song ain't doing it💔
No........😢                   👎
I can’t wait to hear this live when she’s in Philly!!!
I hope she has a dance choreography song. Cuz ugh
A remix with Ciara would eat, imagine both dancing like theres no tomorrow....
Chloe never disappoints!🔥❤
It’s giving tinashe, she’d totally kill in the collab❤️❤️
Good song but desperately needs a feature!!  City Girls would kill this beat! Meg would kill this beat!
sis is not playing! this is a cute song
❤ Beautiful
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😊😊
Fire
Body do ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥This is a hit
Came here after listening to jimin's like crazy now I need a collab please chloe I need it 🧎🏾‍♀️🧎🏾‍♀️🧎🏾‍♀️🧎🏾‍♀️
this song needs to get mashed up with MOVE by Beyoncé
This song is really good!! Okay Chloe
this song is INSANEEEEE
❤❤❤❤❤
sounds like a new fav
the rap verse!🔥😭
Sexy ass talented ass Chloe girl....
It's pretty good, some parts better than others. I didn't really like the repetitive "Pop pop pop pop pop pop your body like this" layered over the top. Apart from that her voice sounds great.
I like every part of the song but it doesn't come together. 😢 it sounds like five different bops mashed together
LAWWWWD HAVE MERCY!!! I live for it!!! I told y’all!!! She NEVER DISAPPOINTS!! Face card still clean!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Its a BODY DO BOP!
This is So exoticly exquisite❤❤❤
THISSA BOP!!!
How do you love a song ❤
Yessssss Chloe she looks amazing and the song is Fire 🔥 ❤️❤️❤️❤️💛😍💕💕♋️❤
Fire 🔥
I love how Chloe can do uptempo and RNB it's so fun😊 so unpredictable this sounds like her she's hyper, fun and full of energy please she must come to South  Africa🇿🇦 we love her unconditionally here❤  I don't why people want artists to stick to only one genre when there's so many to play with.
Smashed 🔥💪🏾👏
Come on interlude. 🙃 Gurl…I’m ready for Chloe to be my new Ni’jah but imma need songs longer than three minutes my gawd. Anywho…the song slaps!
Ok this is cute I'll give it a few claps and snaps but where are the ballads? Who told Chloe this is all she knows how to do? I'm ready for Chloe and Halle's next album tbh
Like this songs❤❤
Add Normani if you do a remix please
i rally love the your songs and videos keep up ❤ I'm form Nepal your big fan
OK CHLOE BAILEY BABYYYY!!
This song is giving me so much energy I can't explain it😭🔥🔥💞
i can’t stop listening to this song ommgggg
Do I ever wonder what?!?!?!?!? Chloeeeee 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Next Friday is the album!!!!
This better be charting chloe is THAT GIRLLLL
Chloe please drop the full song I'll kill you, (?)
2:07 SHE DID THE HALLE STARE ITS SOO PRETTY OMG 😍😍 MY FAVORITE PART

YESSSS
This needs to be longer. It’s way too short
This the one . Yeah this is the hit . U can tell it’s authentically her .  Keep this sound Omg
Such a banger! been on repeat since it came out❤️‍🔥
1 week away 😭
This is so fun Chlöe I can't wait to see how the rest of the tracks flow with this track ❤❤  My only concern is the duration of the tracks. I'll be supporting you anyways but I'd love a normal song structure with verses, choruses and bridges before concluding the track.   Love this track tho good job as always ☺️❤️💜
her songs are always under 3 mins 😭
Chloe NEVER misses. I’m patiently waiting for the album to drop 🙌🏾
It’s timeeeeee So proud first album coming out nd this song is greatt
❤❤❤ go girl you on fire 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥a bop

That's my girl😍🔥
Love it! This will be sooo fire once summer comes too! This one for the parties/clubs for sureee.
YUPPPPPPPPPPPP
Little beyonce 👑
This song is actually good, just the faces and way she looks at the camera is so extra. She is heavy handed.  She got the talent just not the x factor.
If u not listening to this masterpiece with headphones and moving ur body idk what the hell is wrong with u
Love her definitely body goals girl ❤
Yassss this is it !!! Omggg 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh I f**** with this miss Bailey I immediately started dancing
You and Victoria Monet and lucky daye are making my night 😂❤

My issue is CHLOE can DO WAYYYYY better than this! This is too mediocre imo… She has a really beautiful voice!! CHLOE please use your voice!!!! Connect with your fans,,,sing about your emotions! I’m tired of you singing about boys and breakup and cheating  You can do better!
thanks for this song, my sis. Brasil te ama 💖🇧🇷
