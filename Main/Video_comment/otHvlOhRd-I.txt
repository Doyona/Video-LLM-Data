REZNOV IS A LEGEND... OKAY!
What if the mimics just don't spawn and I've went round 30+ and they are just not spawning?
Thanks for the guide just beat Firebase Z Easter egg for the first time by myself
@2:34 bro honestly after the fourth one I quit the game
essence trap step sucks so much
Forever grateful for your guides man, by far the best out
Pro tip for the satellite step, you can keep a mimic until the end of the round, kill all zombies but the mimic and then capture it with one of the essence traps, once captured it will stay trapped for 3 minutes before the trap breaks, but until then you can do whatever you want freely
they need to fix the mimics and traps in this game
Can somebody explain why the dance step doesn't end sometimes? Ive had him going for 4 rounds before
Pizza is my new favorite guy for zombie Easter eggs. Short and sweet straight to the point not leaving anything out guides
Pretty disappointed that you didn’t mention you needed the wonder weapon at the start of the video, I had to restart the whole thing over again
I still cant do the mimic part ive tried noah, urs, etc can u help me plse
On my game it only worked with mimics from blue equipment. Everytime, I've tried it both blue and purple. IDK if it's different for ps5.
Is reznov same guy from bo campaigns in zombies in cw?
Thank you so much for this guide pizza
Wonderful guide.
I've done the memory thing with over 5 mimics.  And I doing something wrong?
Thank you for making such a simple and easy guide. This was very helpful. I wish other creators would do the same!
best easter egg guides period everyone else is all out of wack and dont make sense his makes sense
I messed up on first crystal challenge.will it appear again??
I'm on the mimic step and nothing will work.
I love how fast you  get to the point in this video because you can actually watch the video while you're playing and not have to listen to all this nonsense. Well done
Thank you my G, you helped me beat my first zombies Easter egg 👊🏽👊🏽🔥🔥
Pizza imagine your me, 12 o clock at night doing the easter egg with randoms but they keep killing the mimicsthen u get past there then u go to the satellite part and you lag out and rip
I need help lmao 🤣
any idea on why it dosent let me unlock the data machine thing
Can someone help me do it pls
What is up on the dpad on pc
anyone on at the moment that can help?
Completed the Easter Egg on my 2nd try with your guide. Your guide does not state on the last Satellite step that it has a timer until it automatically launches you in to the boss fight. I was not set up for it when it happened and ended up dying half way through.
I completed it solo
Doesn't work we capture multiple mimics from different areas
Yeap the mimics step still dont work LOL
If only all the effort would unlock Samantha maxis as a character
Finally after about 6 tries solo! Thanks
Good reviews? Guess ill watch this one lmao
Upgrading 1 origins staff is the equivalent to how hard the entire ee for fire base z is. It’s ridiculously easy.
straight to the point and like he said no bs😂 he out here stomping out the competition
How do you have the ray k so early lol
Literally tried doing the ee this morning, got right to the last step and died. Definitely trying again when the kids are in bed 😂🤪🤙
Anybody knows i cant speak to peack, the window is still closed after all step done why ???
Thank you for the simple and easy to follow tutorial Pizza just finished the ester egg before season 3
Took me quite a few attempts to do this solo, but eventually I got there. Thank you for this amazing and quick guide! :)
Easter egg was pretty straightforward. Easy one for sure. Good luck to everyone! :)
This guys a legend but he goes to fast
If anyone needs a good map, just google it. It shows the whole layout
This easter egg is so buggy atm and so is getting the rai k, i had all the parts last night to build it and it said waiting for more parts, so frustrating 😡
Great guide got to the boss fight first try ever then I got clapped😃👍🏼
Its not 3 it can be way more than 3
Whole tutorial in 5 minutes? With this i completed the ee in first try! This dude needs them likes!
raevenov?
This guide is amazing and is easier to understand then the longer in depth guides. Very time efficient and straight forward, thank you!!!
I SPENT 10 ROUNDS TRYING TO GET A MANGLER ARM.
I did the stupid mimic pokemon thing 5 times and didnt get a floppy disk?
I just got this with the maxis operator and because of a glitch, i was invisible and could not be hit
I can’t seem to find the smokeless aether container...they all look like they have smoke in them with the shard to me 🤦🏻‍♂️
Cheers lad
Great guide was very confused on Noah’s and your is very short and easy to understand
Funny how MrRoflWaffles’s “no nonsense guide” is about 15 minutes long, when you cover it all in 5 minutes. Good work!
5 mins?, either this guide is godly or this easter egg is yet again a letdown, probably both
He forgot to mention that when u capture the mimics u have to capture them near where they spawned
Is there an achievement/trophy for this EE?! Unfortunately I didn’t get it if so!!
I just want people to do the Easter Egg with but every single Looking For Group post on Xbox is either people looking to do the Monkey Bomb Glitch or God Mode Glitch. 👎
I literally got to the boss fight and got insta downed twice...
If anyone needs help on the Easter egg. Message me and I’ll help u on whatever step u need
I beat this on my 2nd try... good guide
Does it fail if you dont do it before the first assault round ? I killed two of the mimics by accident then after the assault round the parts from which they spawn where not there anymore
I can’t seem to put the last canister into the mIlitary command at 4:28
I disconnect from xbox live right when I beat the boss fml
The easiest guide I have ever seen! Much respect for not wasting my time and yours 🤙🏻
I’ve came across your channel 8 years ago man time flys and now I’m on your channel again looking up guides lol I can’t believe you did this by round 14. Impressive!
How does noah and milo have millions of views and you have a few thousand?! Your videos are always on point and you don’t fill it with nonsense. Im amazed
HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP? Hey is there an new EE with a tank that has a GREEN circle and a GREEN arrow pointing to somewhere ??????
Pizza makes the shortest guides but they are some how better than everyone elses
Thank you so much for the fov on align, been stuck on this step cause I can't see the flags
Finally did it, on an unlucky run by round 25! Thanks for the help Pizza
Best one out of every one ! I like to figure as much as possible on my own but I find myself stuck on wave 35 with no wonder weapon nor all items required 😭 playing solo is lonely & boring
Ok now this is Easter egg step .  Short and simple not like other youtuber with 15+ video like mrwaffles or whatever his name is
im still stuck on the mimic step, there are five items and none are activating. i have one correct one and just need the other two but it wont work, i've been on this one mimic for 6 rounds now.
Yo in 5 minutes I learned hella more then some 10:01 long videos......
When you have to put 100% correct then you know this community is dumb af
THANK YOUUUUUUU, for finding the right thing,got it by round 17, aether crystals light for dark eather, those were glitched, but i got it thanks to you
The boss fight was crazy😳. I didn't think I was gonna make it!😂
I completely firebase z on my 3 attempt hard part was the boss but I did anyway
On my first attempt, I got about half way, and guess what, my playstation decided that it wanted to crash the first time in a while
Can someone help im having a bunch of trouble with the orda boss battle
Thank you very helpful
I call bs
Imagine your game crashing at the end of the ee... Only me? OK
When the game doesnt want to give you the RayAk even though you have the pieces.
Such a banger video!!!! Thanks just did the Easter Egg!!!
What happends if you get the wrong canister for the first one
Also, I’m the mimic step with the essence traps, you can do all of those in one round, at least in my game, I had messed around and killed the one in the military area and I did the one in scientist  quarters and in the Lot.
Every Easter egg I’ve done, you and ch0ppers guides always came in clutch. I just went n did the ee on round 31 on solo. ✊🏾🍕🍕🍕🍕
Thank you for being straight forward
I did the easter egg with this guide
Your guide helped me beat the EE. You are the best!
You make them so easy to understand it’s not that hard when I watch your videos 🤣
2:38 don’t mind me
Anyone tryna do the ee with me I’m younger but won’t go down constantly
Fun fact:   you can shoot the canister with the orb the second you dig it out of the ground to make it easier
This Easter egg is broken EVERYTIME I GET TO THE CUT SCENE  MY SCREEN GOES WHITE ITS HAPPEN THREE TIMES
The  aether traps is glitch, just an fyi, i got maxis ID but never got the floppy disk.
I figured out if you need to complete the step on the computer or get the right numbers on the dart board you can trap the last zombie in the essence trap and no other zombies will spawn and you have 3 minutes to yourself.
Anyone want to do this w/ me on PS? I’ve been to the boss fight and died. I know every step.
Don’t want to say, but Noah too much bullshit on his Easter egg guide
Just beat the EE
No, this is not without BS...  You say in the video that the mimics can spawn anywhere on the map, thats true, but the loot locations you talk about, are only in 3 places, and that are those 3 places you collected the mimic's for the main EE.  Becide that, no BS here..
Ok so I’ve picked up the trap from the data centre and flipped the round but no mimics ive been to every room in the map three times n nothing what have I done wrong?
Just died on round 30 because it kept telling me I had to find another one
I feel like I glitched the floppy disc part, I managed to get the 3 mimics on one round and as soon as he said we got the first half I didn't get the disc. I'm now on my 9th mimic and he keeps saying let's try another
This is the best guide hands down. Used this to complete it, very easy ee love the map, it flows and is fun, wonder weapon is insane and easy to learn if you just wanna slay zombs, great storyline and side easter eggs
RAVENov
the step where you need to realign the satellite dish is hard when playing with mouse and keyboard but i managed to complete the ee in 1 hour 19mins and thats my first completion. it took 3 legendary rewards to get the ray-kay84
Can someone pls help me do this 😀
You firing a god damn space lazer at my satellite dish?
"Correct steps" he says.. _Proceeds to call Ravenov.."Reznov"_
All thanks to this guide and you just being an awesome dude i finally beat it solo. your smarts about them mimics is what got me through :)
I did 8 stupid mimics and the ee still ain't working
This easter egg reminds me of orrigins
What if you pick up the wrong canister?
I followed this guide and I beat the Easter egg thank you so much and this was on my first try
4:30 this part was the hardest😭 You made it look easy😭😭But honestly your the best at explaining everything
Why when i do it i dont get the souls first try?
Ok is it just me or is the mimmiks rng because I’ve done the same steps the same mimmik spawns and it’s not the right ones
ive collected 6 mimick memories in a row and each one weaver says "thats useless find another"
Just did it first try! Great tutorial keep it up! 🍕🍕
Just beat it on solo at round 36 with the help of your video thank you !!
Great work Pizza, I personally really REALLY love how you didn't rush the guide out for content, and the guide is perfect. Other very well known YTers rushed their tutorial guides out, complete with mimic mistakes... unfortunately, hiding behind an "Update in the description" comment doesn't really wash with me. Now they're left with incorrect guides, and yours is spot on! Well done my man, this is the one chief.
Jesus Christ is coming soon   It isn’t too late to follow him
F, my ps4 crashes before i finish round2, so much for everyone being able to do9 the easter egg at the same time, its been 4 days and i cant even play it, this is ridiculous
Can someone confirm for me.... do you need the wonder weapon to do the EE?
Thank you sooo much for the aligning part I was wondering why I couldn’t do it right.
Update: dude u da man! You’re the only person to mention FOV for bug on satellite part and it worked! 80 was perfect for me also got zombies eyes back in their head 👍🏼👍🏼
Me and my team of random players got all the way to the boss fight to only get it to half health. I should definitely get prepared next time...
Pizza you are a god.  I have xbox and i had an EXTREMELY hard time trying to move that little blue dot on the computer screen to align the satellite in the later parts of the easter egg.  Very smart of you to have thought about the field of view setting.   Also, best easter egg tutorial by far.  I think the mimic step requires u to catch 2 on the firebase side and 1 on the spawn side no matter what.  It has worked every time for me. I always have to catch atleast 1 on the spawn side on that step.
Love this video the most straight to the point no bs and its only 5 min long 👌🏻 keep it up 👍🏻
Done the main Easter egg, tq codenamepizza
Like if this is the easiest guide to understand
How did u get the raki on round 11
It's funny how he gave everyone time to make a guide before him and still made a better one indeed!
R3qxg
Jzk5d
I still need help on the mimic step. It doesn’t work for me, it keeps saying incorrect
OMG the boss is the same thing as you could see as the monster in the dark Aether on for maschine
23 on trending let's go
Well earned subscribe, saying no bs is suck bs btw😑😂
I found that for me the mimics needed to be trapped in the same location as they spawned as well to work.
My friends carried me through it. I trained zombies while they did the steps but after killing the boss my Xbox 1 gave up and fully shut off 😭
Wth happened to cod zombies. So complicated now
Thanks the mimics step on this video is very helpful!!
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4
Thanks this is a good guide, very helpful 😁👍
https://youtu.be/N-TRZZihVFo    🍃🍃🍃
Your guides the best, me and my buddy just finished the Easter thanks to it 💯🎉
you have earned yourself a like sir
Planetside two is a free to play ffp mmo on ps4 and pc
Easter Egg completed first time using this guide... Bring on DLC 2
You don't have to speak to him in the beginning.
I solved this easteregg myself with every step correct.
I died on the boss I got one taped by a dumb zombie
Help... the last step is game right and mrdalekjd said u can get setup because once u do this step u cant do anything apart from boss fight...i did that now i cant interact with the game
Best tutorial !! Great job!
Happy late Bday Pizza, ty <3
Thanks for the clear guide ^ ^  The mimic memory step is where i keep dying, not having the best of luck solo haha
It doesn’t let me do the essence trap and it just says memory corrupted
Thanks for guide, helped out a lot! Happy late Birthday as well, Pizza! 🍕
You know I 1000% believe that the mimics are just in set spots but it’s still random to get them to spawn in for me spent from round 10-25 and could only get the ones I didn’t need from objects and trapping them in the offices. Or it would just break
Just completed it!! cheers 🍕🍕🍕 btw the cruise missile with ring of fire nearly one shots the boss 🤝
great tip if you want the wonder weapon before round 15 do the jungle dig site first a mangler spawns while youre in the yellow circle and they can drop the ammo piece you need
Myth : on firebase z during the boss fight can you teleport out the boss fight with the evil bunny easter egg love your vids 🍕 🍕 🍕 🍕🍕🍕
Does anyone elses console just crash after this update came out of playing this?
I was struggling on that mimic step for so long 🥲
Myth: What happens if you kill Orda before the Easter egg boss fight ??? 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
I can't find the mimics any where in the map
Best guide. Simple, fast and straight to the point. Keep up the great work!
Super quick and helpful guide. Makes it easy if you are in the middle of the quest and you have to look the next step up. Thanks Pizza🍕🍕🍕🍕❤️
me and my buddy did a duo run tonight and it worked PERFECTLY, thanks pizza 🍕
This helped tysm Noah’s did explain as much as you.
I understand you want your tutorial to be quick and simple but that isn’t always the best way...explaining the steps as quick as possible is good in some ways but doesn’t help players that are going to encounter many different things. Easter eggs are like working on a car: the youtube video makes it look simple but when you go to do it it takes you way longer than them. Like me on the mimic step I accidentally killed one and now the mimics aren’t spawning so I can’t go past that step. Maybe saying “warning do not kill the mimics” idk just also mentioning things that can go wrong on accident will help these a lot. Love your videos
what happens if you mess up the canister part?
Hey Pizza I have a question about the egg. My group just did the satellite step and we then were able to go to the boss fight and we waited to go to the boss fight but was still teleported to it at some time after. Is there a timer before the start of the boss fight?
The best Guide !!! thx :)
When I saw 5 minutes for the full EE I could not belive it. Just amazing 🍕
Myth what happens if you beat the Easter egg after the round 30 boss fight 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
just solod it first try because of this
i can get up to the essence trap step the blasted thing wont activate atall and i weaken the mimic to like the smallest slither of health does anyone know why this is?
If your fast enough and want the free Ray K, you can do the canister in onslaught area and the Amour dudes will drop the Magazine, LIKE SO HE CAN SEE
I'm not getting the 4 pieces of equipment spawning at all I have flipped 5 rounds since picking up the essence trap and checked everywhere and can't find anything.
Literally been trying to get past the passcode step all day! Thank god
Had a few hiccups but I ended up getting it all done. Thanks! For some reason I could NOT get the mangler to drop the weapon part. Took me 6 different ones for some reason. The first one died out on its own and a regular zombie spawned I guess it was out of map lol
Having trouble on the mimic step
I died to a wood pallet in helipad while training the zombies to get the ray k I did everything else except that part the mimic ate me then threw me into a corner on the wood pallet.
Your guide is so straight forward and no offense to Noah but sometimes his are misleading like the memory step. He said kill them in those rooms, but his most misleading guide is the fire bow tutorial
The most common mimic spawns are outside weapons garage, above pap, sky bridge
Love the guide. Helped me and my cousin beat it first time. Thank you for no nonsense and clear instructions. Ps its ravenov nor reznov but I wish it was
i was stuck on the mimic part so long looking at the other guides
This is FAAAAAR too complex...
Myth: can you do the free jug easter egg in the final boss fight? 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
4:21 dont stay outside the ring for a long time, after it was done doing its thing, its radiating energy that damages me and I can't pick it up...
What do I do if I grab the wrong canister and it won’t let me redig the first hole for the first canister
WHY DOES EVERYONE ELSE GET THE MIMIC MEMORIES FIRST TRY AND I HAVE YET TO GET ONE???
The part with the hidden computer is to align the satellite has been cooling down for 2 rounds what do I do now? What is the cooking down time??
First ever Easter complete THANK YOU PIZZA 🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕
I’m stuck on the essence trap part
This is so slept on but i'll be very clear, You can't get hit after you pick up the devices, Or else the memory will corrupt and you have to do it again.
I’m never gonna be able to do this🤷‍♂️
Starting this at round 40 wasn’t a good idea 😂 hood guide though
thank you mate
Ur the real MVP...just finished it solo with ur guide 1st try .
Idk if myth busting is still a thing, but here I go. MYTH: Nothing happens if you let the orda on round 30 win the fight, while never turning the power on in the first place.
Anybody know what to do if you accidentally grab the wrong aetheiruim container for the engineering one?
Everytime I trap a mimic it gives me random people
What happens if you pick up the wrong container in open lot?? That happened to me and now I can’t dig it up
3 Games in a row now this hasnt worked for me, I get to the step where I need to gather the memories, and I cover every square inch of the map, and kill every one of the Mimics and submit it, but every single times it fails and then there is nothing left to spawn mimics anymore. Is there a chance where you wont get a mimic thats the right one on a round and they will all be wrong?
I followed the steps correctly, but when it came to the very LAST STEP, THE XBOX GLITCH wouldn't let see the screen for the satellite, so EVERYONE on earth BUT ME can do this, SO PATHETIC.. even though I really wanna do the easter egg and that codenamepizaa won't see this comment
OMG YOU ARE MY HERO
Bo3-20 minutes ee guide Cold war-5 minute ee guide
Oh, that’s all..... F...
Took me 10 tries on the mimic step
How did he get the ray-k so early?
great tutorial, but damn. what a dissapointing easter egg lol. thats all we get to see from samantha? why couldnt we be able to go inside the dark aether to save her there. I mean, the portal was active all along. then we overpowered it and it got shut down, then when we got power she escaped, why didnt she do that earlier? fkn dissapointing. Tbf, i was hyped for this map and the map itself is good. But the easter egg was not good. i miss SoE, DE, ZnS, GK..
I got a weapon trial folder and I'm not sure what it's for I think I got it from using explosives on the trucks on fire I'm not sure though. It was by the dead body where you get the eye
Code name pizza: Reznov!! Ravenov: is my name a joke to you!?!
If you get to around round 30 Rosa will spawn automatically
Finished it on round 15 with 4 perks and pack a punch 2 rai k
For anyone asking, easter egg is easy to solo
Simple and straight to the point
Straight to the point in 5 min... we completed the EE thanks to this guide. Cheers Pizza
does anyone miss when easter eggs were actually interesting and hard?
i'm stuck it keeps saying memory corrupted
Love yer guides
I like that there is no BS he went straight to the point! U get a like and subscribe for that 😂
Best video from the best zombies Youtuber. Completely no nonsense (unlike milos) 🍕🐐
These short videos are cool, but then we still have to end up watching another video for more in depth information. And if someone already knows all the in depth info, why watch this video?
You earned a subscriber and a like today, nice job on this guide. I've watched the others, but you've made it simple and straightforward! Thank you!
Two of my absolute FAVORITE YouTubers for str8 to the point content, and elite GOD TIER COD info...CodeNamePizza and CaspahZ! You two are legendary.
Saved my life on the mimic step 😅
ITS NOT RESNOV BRUH
He said three captures... I’m on my 8th
I JUST BEAT IT OMG I FEEL GOOD AGAIN
No one but you can make a tutorial that detailed but also this short:) Awesome Legend🍕🍕🍕
End the current round that your on it makes ir really easy to save a zombie.... WTF DOES THIS MEAN?
Says defeating orda is simple meanwhile I'm getting overun by mimics and armored zombies in the village😭
The one step trapping a mimic the stuff wont spawn
What if you activated the bunny ee in the boss fight
Seriously the best, most concise guide!
I just used a mangler for the entrapment step of the ee
I completed the easter egg without youtube b*tch. (mic drop)
I appreciate that this isn't bs
no psart drop when killing mauler (armor zombie) , help??
You don’t have to go through a ridiculous amount of mimics; me on my 7th
I couldn’t get the mimic step before this guide but you really helped me understand. Great video!!!
Just want to say huge thanks!  Just completed it. Thanks so much. Badass calling card
You always make the best Easter egg tutorials
First easter egg i completed solo 💀
Absolutely no BS!! Haha
My floppy disk doesn’t appear???????
Scrolled blindly through my sub feed trying to find stuff about the easter egg and I land on pizza. I Trust the Pizza Guide 🍕 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕  Edit: that was a perfectly digestible pizza guide
Thank you so much, I was following another guide but they didn't explained correctly the Mimic step so I spent like an hour confused of why it wasn't working. All I had to do was capture the mimics that come out of the  decoys, the place where you put didn't matter. Btw, they gonna keep spawning in the same spot until you capture it, then the decoys will move to the other places
I’ve done the mimic step like 12 times with 12 different mimics and I got one code is that how it works?
I've gone through 7 mimics trying to get this floppy disc
You my man, just earned yourself a sub for the straight forward no bullshit sentiment
Peck wont talk to me, he peeks out of the blinds and closed them
This is so much to remember damn, thanks tho my dude
I was able to finish on round 15 and complete the main quest, let’s go baby.
oh, that's it?
Myth: Does double points give you double points on turning on the generator?
Straight to the point, this was the most helpful guide I’ve seen as well
BRUH
Hey pizza I think there a time limit for when you have to find the mimics because I keep hearing a noise and when that noise happens I cant find the mimics
Does anyone wanna do this with me?
SPEEDRUN GOING ON RN WANNA WATCH PLEASE WATCH ME :’)
what a way to spoil the boss fight thanks mate
where are the three mimic locations...????
Does anyone know how to shoot the special ammo for the Ray K on keyboard and mouse?
Ravenov? Lmao
Howd he get the ray-k on round 6 though?
How long is the cool down on the last step?
100* better than noah j
Best guide iv see so far, definitely gonna try this tomorrow. You have a new subscriber to.
Finding the mimics will 3 randoms is hard☹️
I like how codename calls Ravenov REZNOV
God damn. This dudes voice makes me wanna go full blown Pennsylvania neighbor on him....
Can someone help me with the ee? My gamer tag is DuckyBoi76
A FIVE MINUTE GUIDE. YES. PLEASE.
Way too easy
thanks so much bro!
Reduce the Playback speed to 0.75. And thank me later ;)
0:13 “Reznov” **BO1 flashbacks intensifies**
this the 1
I went to do the first dig site and it spawned In like 5 mimics and no canisters
Quest complete, nice one codename
Completed it yesterday  just me and my boy
I got to the computer satellite alignment step, did it wrong and then got cornered and died
Myth busting Monday : what happens if you kill orda on round 31 on the defending wave thing before you complete the Easter egg do u just not fight the boss
Great guide! But how can none of the youtubers say Ravenov’s name right lol
Its not 100% correct if you get his name wrong everytime
Finally i was waiting till youd post the complete guide now i can try it and fail lets gooo
I was playing yesterday and did about 60-65% of the EE myself without any guide. I’ll be sure to use this one for the rest of it though. GG
If you don’t call him reznov ur weird
Glad to see other people call him Reznov
Great vid
I really got kicked out of the map during the boss fight and couldn’t hit the boss we love that
I dont understand the mimic step cause I spent 30 minutes on it no progress like??
I died at boss fight..
how do i get the first canister if i picked the wrong one the first time, does it mean i just failed the entire thing
So many bugs on pc, couldnt find third mimic for memory step :(
Any body know how to fix the d pad step my blue dot does not move
looking through every guide to get more info about the mimic step :(
What am I doing wrong? I've gone through about 8 Mimics and only got 1 code!
What if you accidentally kill 1 do you have to restart?
MY NAME IS VICTOR REZNOV
reznov
ReZnOv
The mimics never spawn right
That mimic step has to be the stupidest most bugged step of all time. It definitely doesn’t work perfectly every time
Too many steps lmao
My last canister is glitched and has acid coming out of it and won't let me pick it up rip me
what happens if i accidentally kill the Mimic instead of trapping his essence?
Omw, such a short and concise video, thank you so much
Does the aethar crystals step not work when you have two at once or do you have to put one in then do another put one in then do the last one
I miss real Easter eggs, ones that took days to figure out and complete. this new zombies mode is to easy and has nothing on black ops 1, 2, 3 and even 4! zombies Easter eggs.
Looks like you also have the FOV glitch as well
TOO FASS
Only having to capture 3 mimics is MASSIVE CAP. I literally played yesterday and it took 16 mimics and 10 rounds and I didn’t even get all 3 so i couldn’t progress.
Cold war is to glitchy i was running and just stopped and got stuck on a piece of grass and then 1 zombie killed me in 2 hits
I did all this , is there no achievement for  completing it ? What bull crap . It gave me nothing but 3 crystals for completing it .
If you can make a full EE guide in 5 mins is it really a Zombies EE? So far Treyarch has made EE’s way to easy this map will go stale within a week or two...
Quick guide with no bs, earned a like from me 🤘🏻
Cheers Pizza great video, another great tip for everyone for the boss fight you should mention is to keep the free cluster strike from the assault wave for the boss, it takes half his health off immediately and wipes most of the zombies, along with a few monkey bombs you can finish him off in seconds.
“No randomness about it” for the mimic step, I started that step on round 9 and I’ve gotten one every round with it saying that it’s wrong every time, I’m now on round 28...
Cold War Zombie Easter Eggs are lame
WHO COMES UP WITH THESE EASTER EGGS!!!?
What happens if you activate the easteregg on round 30 or protection round
This guide helped me beat it solo, tysm!
I'm a little underwhelmed by this map, been out less than 24h Good guide though 👍
Anyone else have the problem where after you've collected the canisters the OPD doesn't disappear?
It skips from how to get the ray K and straight to the 3rd cannister.
thank you! straight to the point!
Sweet. Thanks man .
Thanks Buddy
It's funny how he gave everyone time to make a guide before him and still made a better one
I have to say I have huge respect for you for making this guide in a solo game. You may not see it like this, but It shows how much you value your fans
Pizza was wrong about one step, sometimes when you capture the mimics it gives you the wrong memories. You need Brahms, Sokolov, and Zhabin
🍕and🧇 always has the best guides
Just spent 4 hours beating this ee
Too easy
Thank u for the guide 👍.I just did the Easter egg with my mates
Yo this video was quiiiiicckk.... damn bro
Yeah my guy🔥
My god you’re a legend. Succinct. Must have an unnamed baby to tend to or something. :)  Thanks for making time for your videos, you’re epic.
Hate the Mimic step it literally never works for me
Easter egg guide speedruns
There was some bs you didn’t say to double tap x to open up the things to catch the mimics
This is not the full easter egg, because the gun is part of the WHOLE thing.
How did he get the rayk gun before round 15
I ain’t funna cap I like Noah but his tutorial be getting me confuse, at least I can come to you pizza 💀
Where tf have the myth busting Monday’s gone
Are you illiterate
Failed 3 times with Noah’s guide. Got it first try with yours.   Keep taking the time you need to make your guides to make them just as good as this one. Loved the guide!
good vid but on mimic step I would of added their are only 4 locations and it can’t be the same location
Other people have pointed out that Samantha has Nikolai’s goggles and Takeo’s katana, but did anyone catch that she also has Dr. Monty’s scarf?
Thanks for the help Pizza! I also like how you now have your videos in 4k. (or maybe you always have and I'm just stupid lol)
I was stuck on the memory step so it’s good that this video doesn’t say that the mimics are random. Honestly they need to do more research like you 🍕
Why can no content creator say Ra-ve-nov...
TYSM
Really appreciate the quick and to the point tutorial waisting literally no time
Tried capturing a mimic in the areas you said, tried several times, none of them worked.
My name is Sergie Ravenov! And I will have my revenge
And EE done flawless 0 downs under round 20 and on the first try 10/10 would kill the ancient god orda again
My game bugged and I couldn't do the link satellite part, I'm really upset because that's the literal last step before the boss
Happy late birthday pizza!!!
You always come through with the best guides pizza. Always explaining the steps in the most detail.
You only have to do 3 but I’ve done them all and it literally only kept saying memory corrupted. I tried for a hour straight just trying to get that step done and it will not work, I’ve captured one in literally every area and tried. I got 1 code and sams tracking ID after a hour of trying
Why does the mimic say data currupt when i no it the correct one
How long does the computer cooldown take
Appriciate you taking your time on a correct guide!
"reznov"
First time I've finished it before pizza uploaded a guide
Any one else have an issue with mimics and capturing them or just me
The mimic essence trap step is the worst
What a legend
The mimic step locations?
5:36? Bloody hell
you’re the best seriously all other youtubers takes 15min with hard explanation bs
This was great and super concise bro I love it, thanks lad
I'm struggling for some reason on the mimic essence steps to catch the memories.  Idk if it's bugging out or what but I'll explain.  I'll get the first one done (I usually go to the office location) no problem.  Then I go to spawn so I don't have to run over there again but I can never get a mimic to spawn where I need him to and they spawn somewhere else in the map and when I try to capture them in the correct area it's 100% the wrong memory and then I try to go to the other location on the left side of the firebase and same deal.  How do I get mimics to spawn where I need them to?  Am I doing something wrong?
"Absolute correct steps, no BS"  Step one.. talk to Reznov 🔥
Rav-eh-nov  They literally say it in the game
tbh i miss 20 minute guides lol,  i really enjoyed hard easter eggs.
For PC players, to get the alternate ammo type on the Rai K press   'B', which is the default keybind for changing from auto to burst on normal weapons.
Why am I forced to fight a giant monster on round 30 that should be optional
Awesome guide as always!!! Much love my man
Ngl Milos video had me so confused but this was so much more straight forward  Not bashing him but this is more my style
Is it me or are all the easter eggs for cold war are piss easy compared to the previous black ops games i mean i like the ee but compared to bo4 where the bod ee wasnt solved for like a month or something thid is easy
and in 5 mins I gave up to the mimics challenge
just completed the easter egg, thanks pizza and happy late birthday!
5 minutes for a whole EE, Treyarch is getting lazy with the EEs. I miss the 2-3days hunts
How was ur gun already pack a punch at the beginning of the game
I can’t get the mimics to spawn
5:03 I did this while not knowing 84 fov fixed this.. solo, this was hard 😂😂
Anyone want to try the ee? Stuck on mimic step playing on pc
Sick of these maps being too easy to finish make these maps harder so we don’t have a content drought for ages
do you actually have to go to the next round for every mimic?
Now this is what you call a no nonsense guide
Real question is you xm4 already max level.
I'm still having trouble with the mimic step, it doesn't work at all.
I was waiting for this cuz I’m loyal
I found a real big box (room) outside the map and i have not seen a part where u get in there so i think there is more on this map
Man i wish i knew about changing the fov for xbox i did it with that visual glitch on 115 fov which took forever but i eventually got it.
Pizza for the boss fight use cruise missile and chopper gunner to get the boss to low health. Edit; ive done it and works fast and easy on the boss and some zombies too
Gotta give this man his well deserved like. Not cool to just watch this short and informative video then leave. Thanks pizza!!!!
Thanks for a correct guide seen so many incorrect ones already.
My boy Fast Guide Glitch was actually the first one to put out a guide with the correct steps. This one is also right, Nice!
Tbf I've been calling him Reznov too lol
4k lets go
I'm pretty sure the mimic/item spawn locations are not randomly scattered throughout the map. Sokolov will always spawn in Peck's quarters in the village. Zhabin will always spawn near the colonel's office (could be upstairs, downstairs or on the bridge). Brahms will always spawn in the motor pool area. If the items are nowhere in these locations, end the round and the items will spawn in one of these locations.
Give me free pizza Toby Maguire 🤣🤣🤣
Happy birthday!!
omg thank you for saying about the xbox bug, im in a game getting mad at why this isnt working but i got it now! thankyou
Thank you so much a easy quick and clear guide 🍕🍕

IM VICTOR  REZNOV AND THIS IS MY REVENGE
5 min guide..really....
This helps! I thought the mimic crystal step was hearing based
Speak to reznov lol
Thank you for clarifying the mimic step! Was having some trouble last night and this made things so much easier!
It’s Ravenov not Reznov😂
Thanks for the guide I saw the live stream yesterday day and good job on completing the easter egg 👍
Pizza my squad did a 41 minute speed run!
Artillery Strikes make the boss fight really fast and easy
Myth can you use the essence device on a regularly spawned mimic?🍕🍕🍕
REZNOV IS A LEGEND... OKAY!
Myth if you have tombestone and you friend doesn't and both of you got downed can you revive your friend while you are in the tombestone form
Excellent guide! Thank you so much. I was struggling on the essence trap step and now I know what I've been doing wrong.
Shout out to reznov for all the help lmao
This is perfect. Thank you!
Is there a specic mimic to suck( no homo)
This is the tutorial i will be using :D Great tutorial pizza short and sweet
Milo's had the same steps, what do you mean noone else had the right steps? lol
5 minute guide Pog
It's funny how Pizza calls Ravenov Reznov lol
Yes, Reznov. Thank you for enlightening me
Um pizza thats not reznov its ravanov
Also F in chat for the expected amount of times you’ll say “Reznov” during this tutorial... I can see it happening before I press play 👀
