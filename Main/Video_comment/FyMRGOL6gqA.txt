Shuffled Shrines will NOT look the same each game, so the routes I take to get to some symbols may be different to you. Even though the area looks different, the symbols are always in the same spot.
I am barley doing this challenge in the last day of  season 3
why are there traps.. this challenge sucks
Been trying to do this for the past hour on the last day thanks FORTNITE go making this too complicated
Vvv
V sun sun c
Someone help me, I can't do it
This mission and whoever thought it would be a good idea to put it in the bonus  section can both go to hell. 9 times, and when I finally get it...the  mission bugs and the mission complete doesn't pop. Eff it.

Thanks for this. Took me a few tries to find the entrance but once i marked it i found my way.
Dumb challenge lol 😆 🤣
Thanks
This is not stalker
Somehow, even in team rumble this quest proved to be cancerous.
This was the best video by far, all the others were not helpful in the least bit.
Does it have to be in order?
Me causally guessing the symbols and getting it right-
It didnt open with the code
find the first two then mix the last two and you'll find it
Man. Brother been in this for like 4 years lol. I remember 4 years ago picking up this game:you my man were saving lol
It didnt work
Yellow
I picked 4 blue symbols, opened the door, i pick upped the treasure but not completed my quest xDD Cringe game. But thanks for help :D (i try again and again when i not get completed message) :D
How do you know what order you put them in? If you show up to the first one and it’s a spiral does that mean you put the first stone as a spiral ?

Done this quest twice but says I haven't ffs
Fuck this challenge man its impossible I just rage quited
Man, fuck this shit. I ain't gonna use that shit anyway. If it was Han Solo I'd care, but it's not soooo
advice:break the poison traps
Quick tip Find the 1st stone and just rotate the other three until you luck up.
This video helped me get into the main chamber. Thanks.
No one told me abt a boulder 💀
I wanna complete this but dead ass everyone always shooting at me I only shot at one person bc I threw down all my load out and still shot me so I took a weapon back n finished him
Actually, in my opinion, this was a quest like any other in Fortnite, it's easy because the rocks are pretty much staying in the same location, the only hard part is the players killing people millions of times but otherwise, it's pretty easy and entertaining. Due to it being easy, the gold you find at the end of the quest is an easy gold bar farm
One of the harder challenges as of late. Longtime fan thanks Harry!
Screw that i just guess my way thru it. The first time i got it right on the first try but got killed by the spikes lol.
Worst challenge
this is such a shit challenge
opened the chamber several times, took the treasure, went thru the secret door... no quest completion
Thank you! I recently reached level 100 and im focused on the indiana jones quests thank you!
A month later and people still just go there and kill each other not letting us complete it
I died to poison darts
Still can’t do it
All my symbols were suns and I put them and it didn't open lol. This game blows
How the hell are you supposed to know which order it is is literally impossible
It’s impossible
THANK YOU SO MUCH I FINALLY DID IT!
Is there a glitch with this challenge currently? I can't seem to get it done.
EPIC did not think the quest through too many people are toxic and will kill you before you can do anything
I don't understand, i out it in the same order as you, still the door didn't open, do i have to go to each symbol first?
Can anyone help me
I don't know who hurt the devs at epic but I don't mind the idea of decking them both. The person who hurt the dev for being a jagoff and the dev for designing this.
Thanks
I've tried 23 times and it is not fu***** working
I was confused about this challenge so I searched up this video and then after knowing what to do I spent the next 4 hours landing here and dying by sweats before realizing I could do this in team rumble🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Thank u
I just guessed 🤣
Nothing happends for me
Could have been so much more informative, but thanks.

autista ez nem az amit kerestem
I did it for a quest and even celebrated!… then I suddenly got squashed by the round boulder when I was leaving 😭💀
How didn’t he set the traps off??
Sun
Bruh it took me over 5 mins just to get trapped lmao
Thanks took me 1 try lol
I went to team rumble and just started spinning the stones in different combinations til it unlocked
Went through the door didn't work
I have tried so many times. If ii dont get shot, have a boar or wolf attack me, get lost or have full shield and die getting booby traps. Fortnite sucks for this challenge
To bad!;!!! You explain nothing!!!
Thanks it helped a lot
THIS IS FAKE IT DIDNT WORK
Tysm
I was wondering why the video I watched earlier was so shitty and none specific I realized it was the wrong video LOL (Just saying the shitty one is yours)
This has to b the most bs quest I've ever seen in any game
I just had to do this twice lol cause I did not go into the secondary room with the safes.   Thanks for showing the proper order of the locations. Most of the other vids don’t do that…
I finally did this quest after multiple attempts, I was rejoicing after killing a sad player hiding in the room near the entrance, only to die from the wall traps. Eventually I got through the whole chamber, did the quest, got the loot on the way back out saw another player making his way through the entrance. I crouched and uncrouched multiple times, swung my pickaxe to indicate friendliness and the player did the same and then we both got killed by a rolling boulder lmao
So let me get this straight even if I manage to kill the fuck ton of sweaty people that come there and complete the puzzle opening the door the challenge still doesn't say I completed it. I'm assuming I need to go in there and do something but hell if I fucking know. I'm assuming grab that stupid gold statue but oh wait I gotta dodge people coming in from other locations to the puzzle, some random fucking poison darts and the big ass bolder. Nothing can be easy with you Epic I swear. Yall can take the shitty quest and shove it
dude i cant ever find where they are
1:17 trzymamkredens nick XD
I've been looking for 3 days and I found this and of course bc their randomised I put a different 1
i cant find it
Blue blue yellow
I did this quest and when the big rock started to roll a person entered the tunnel and died from the rock😂😂
Do they have to be in a certain order? I found all the symbols and no matter what order I put them in it wouldn’t open legit think it just might’ve been bugged
Followed all the steps and still doessnt eork
Flower edge middle edge
I’ve done this 6 times and it doesn’t complete the quest
Btw guys you NEED the to be Indie in order to finish this which they NEVER said in the description which is BS in my book
Lol, I made it in fine and I thought I was home free and tried to sprint out of the entrance with full health and shield... Eliminated before I got to the end of the hall 🤦
This is the game of the year btw guys😁😁
Thank you!!! Finally completed this horrendous challenge
It doesn’t work for me
Thaw
how do you know which order they go in?
Does anyone know how to open the second door tho
Thanks.
Just tried it rn and wasn't aware of the traps and had 10 hp tried to break the walls rq and some kid kills me not a bot too
Its 1. Under the L   2. Above the L 3. Inbetween d and s 4. Above H :)
Tysm i did it and i met someone who was friendly and didnt shoot me plus let me do the quest
Thank you for not instantly shooting that guy doing the quest and waiting for him to shoot you first
Thanks Harry you just don't know how many times I had to try this challenge
Stupidest challenge
Suck a FUCKING SHITTY GAME!!! I did this shit and literally spent the fucking whole game doing it and Ended up dying bc of the fucking storm
What about the room beside
Unlock an outfit Scan this QR code and complete tasks in refer a friend to earn in-game rewards
How you do that?
Advice just get two of the stones the guess other two that how I did it
Its funny because ive guessed the right code multiple times but i didnt know you had to go in that room and i thought it was glitched so ive wasted hours being 10 seconds away from the answer
It’s just that the worst part is there’s always people that are killing you every time that’s what I hate
Thank goodness for bot lobbies. You don't get a victory crown at the end but you certainly do more challenges easier
Dose it not work when the strm is coming or what
Yelloq
The code for the chamber changes every game so look around to see the code
Why is it not working for me
Played a Team match. Called my team to Shuffled Shrines and did the puzzle while they protected the area. That way it was a piece cake.
I got this quest by luck in team rumble, because assholes fall to kill. Is Predator and Wolverine all over again
Every single match it is not the same thing
I did this challenge 3 times, and it didn't count
Thanks this helped a lot
This is stupid AF! It is the worst quest. You have to go to various matches just for a damn banner. Just solve the puzzle would have been enough. F U Epic Games
I was really  struggling you really help me do the quest thanks 😁
This is probably the worst challenge in the game
How can we do that with all those players bothering us?!
Thank you for helping me
Impossible
Thanks
I managed this in solos (zero build), had to kill like 3 other people tho. Definitely lucky.
Orange
Worst quest ever made. Gta Vice City's helicopter can smoke now!
Can’t they just give us the xp buy auto completed it  I hate these stupid challenges with puzzles
Thx
Fucking pussies always hiding there
For challenges like this they ought to be "no kill" zones, at least for the first few days.
Hehe, I guessed the code and 2 campers jumped me but I killed both of them with 30 HP left and just avoided the red tiles and I eventually got the skin :)
i did the quest the way it’s supposed to (put the stones in order to how i found them) and the door isn’t opening. idk what i’m doing wrong. honestly aggravating.  update: i got it! you have to go from the underground zip, to the area in between the reboot van and the orange tent, then the orange tent, then to the right (where there the pen looking things underground). that’s how i remembered it!
How do you get into the room opposite the 2 legendary chests
Just wasted an hour and 34 mins on a quest because people only care about winning 😤👎
Storm came in and i dd it on 1 hp lol
Cant believe  so many people are crying  about people killing them on, this challenge it's easy done it solo 3 or more times. kill everyone  at shrine then enter code it really isnt hard.
🤣🤣🤣 I got SOOOO lucky. A guy came and did the hard part and made his way inside. I OFF'd him right after he finished it and waited a couple of minutes for the quest to reset and BOOM, I was inside completing the mission and taking his gold weapons. 😈😈😈  And just so you guys know, so I don't sound too sleazy, I really did try to complete this quest like 20 something times before. The place was full of A/holes trying to keep any and everyone else from completing it. I just became an opportunist and caught my lucky break
Bottom Left Top Left Top Center  Top Right
I can’t fuckin do this shit man everytime I get 2 fuckin stones and die fuck this quest.
This is That Bullshit 😤
THIS CHALLANGES IS TOO FUCKING HARD I’VE TRIED THIS SHIT FOR THE LAST HOUR.
There’s to many a*sholes who like to ruin this quest you mine as well give up
Team rumble is definitely the best way to go
Thanks so much this helped me out a lot!
This challenge is prob the most difficult challenge I’ve ever had in this game. You have to find the symbols( they’re different each game) and then unlock the door. Good luck guys! This one sucks
Man your like running all over the place I have no idea where those stupid rocks are
Nah not doing it this quest is almost impossible everyone just lands there just too hard
After sacrificing my soul and mental sanity to the Lucifer of all Lucifers, I finally and painfully finished this.
Wait so I don’t gotta be the person OPENING the door, I just gotta go into the chamber and find the secret door?
I’m the comment number 500
The worst
I don’t like this quest but I must do it
Him: spends time looking 4 stuff   Me: randomly guesses it
It dinnt count I got in took the thing and it stayed you need to do the quest still
I hate this quest I was trying to finish it and I get gunned down every time by a dumb sweaty player.
If you are one of the people who literally sits there and camps people trying to do the puzzle, you suck lol
Quick advice: actually you don't have to do the whole thing...just land somewhere else and when the 1st storm is closing go to shuffled shrines. The second step is find the door. It's easy guys 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Whoever came up with this idea at epic should be fired immediately. These are the kind of things that make people quit a game
Getting 8 kills off the landing each game is dope
i went to shuffled shrine 8 minutes into a match since it was in the next zone and someone else already completed the code and left so i got to walk right into the secret door behind the vines without stressing over the puzzle or pvp.  (i already got killed trying to get it several times in other matches.) don't immediately drop into shuffled. hang out nearby it and wait until the commotion dies down. you might get as lucky as i did and basically get indy's other style for free
Use the reality tree bloom icon on the map as guidance: 1st symbol: 0:27 2nd symbol: 0:50 3rd symbol: 1:00 4th symbol: 1:09 Turn the stones in the right pattern: 1:44  Then follow the video (go straight forward when the doors open to get the gold thing - avoid red floor tiles, those are traps - then go to your right, through the secret door, and in there break through the wall, to get the emote) (Edit) Np everyone 🙏🙏
This has to be the dumbest challenge ever ion think I’m finna do it waste of time to many people landing there
videos fine, but this quest is just stupid, if i wanted this BS id be playing tombraider
Yep jus not doing this one lmao f this
BRUH. I finally got in but forgot about the traps and died 😅🥲
thx
it’s said when ur trying to do it but there are desperate people for kills and won’t let you do it
Just done this when the tomb had already been opened and in the storm. As long as you go into the secret area on the side and walk about, it counts. Stressed for ages and it ended up easy!
It is what, what it is... But if you hear the john Williams music at the shrine...just get in there do who ever opened it dirty...and deal with your quest
theres also a second secret room 😉
This is honestly the worst quest in Fortnite.  Every time you try to solve the puzzle, you gotta deal with a whole bunch of people that just kill each other. How can I get this quest done, when I have to run around the poi looking for the combination while fighting 20+ people?  Whoever designed this quest clearly didn't put much thought into it.
Worst part of the challenge isn't the challenge; it's the damn battle pass level buyer sweats
Ugh... This quest is impossible! I mean it seems really easy but with players killing me especially others is hard, btw in 0:26 is this in order from 1-4? And are there any tips that I could get in without killing?  Edit: Nvm I completed the task all you have to do is join the squads in no builds, in 0:26 there are in order 1-4, just make sure you mark your map where you're heading then your group will follow you. That's just my tip hope it helps.
I did this and it wouldn’t work. I saw 3 of the 4 things and put them in then brute forced the last and it didn’t work for some reason
I did it and it didn’t even count. This is sooo stupid
I've solved this puzzle did the escape but it still didn't complete the challenge for me. I'm mad😠
U make no sense harry
You’re literally the only one that shows how to do this, there’s literally video that people are dying as the run in by the traps and they just say well that’s how you do it.  Should of known to find your video first since I’ve been watching you for so long.
1:39
Everybody is such a b bto always killing u n shi
what a fucking rdidiculous quest. I hope who ever thought this was a good idea has a really bad fucking day
Who tf thinks that changing the way a landing spot looks every game and then making a quest to find stones that will move around every game is a good quest it’s literally impossible this is my 12th match trying to do this quest and it doesn’t work wtf
I did this stupid achievement but I had to go on arena solos and it was so peaceful and quiet it actually shocked me. Maybe it was easy because I had zero hype points but yeah screw fortnite and their achievement.
The code is so dificult!!!!😂😢😢😢😓
Thanks this really helped me
Do I need to look the stones or I can guess?
The character runs like I do in my dreams
So I don't get it. You have to check the four rocks and match them? In any order?
i just did it and just kept spinning the rocks until the door opened. no one was around thank god. i guess i got lucky🕺🏽
Tried team rumble and these douchebags will still kill you. Got in one match and the traps killed me. Before I knew it, the storm had already consumed the POI. Epic needs to find different ways to make this challenge doable.
OMG i hate this quest!!! after finally clearing out everyone and opening the chamber i didn't know you had to look for the chests on the right! dumb ass quest i swear
I got in but the storm killed me And it’s not letting me back in
Thank you so much
Bro the poison darts keep Killin meh
Sheeeesh  That was so stressful.  😮
I’m getting killed every fucking second I land in that location
V sun
I did it and still didn’t get the achievement
I did the right code and it didn’t work what
to many people
Why is it so hard I had it once but no I no I got downd
The traps are hard af
I need help -_
My experience was very irritating, everyone camped the place   I guessed the password: *shot in the back on my way in (a corridor with no way out and I’m in the middle of it)* I tried to camp nearby: *people had flare guns* I spawned away and came back later: *camping the room*  I couldn’t turn a corner in that place without someone just waiting in the shadows, bushes, or high ground, and some of them were just camping the room for kills since the wall blocking the room wasn’t broken. The only way I got it to work, was to go to the Jones, buy two sets of med mist and camp a lot farther away from the place so flare guns wouldn’t spot me. Once the storm overtook the place I used an entire spray to make sure everyone left (good thing I did because using a flare gun I found on the ground I scanned a guy still there) then went in with the second spray.
The first time I ever saw the stones that you have to turn, I assumed that they all had to be one colour and as I went to do it they worked. I then realised in the second game that I am just lucky 😂
my third effect I died cause I had a stupid teammate that stepped on every single trap square and killed me
I died in the storm trying to do this
People camping so they wait and kill you. Kids now in days have no honor
Ty!!!  :)
Tip 2: Load up on chug splash and med kits and wait until it’s in the 1 DMG storm. That’s what I did.
THERE ARE SO MUCH SWEATS THERE 😡
How ever time I try I always f!cking die
Can you just add mi as a friend to you can show mi cause I can’t do it I keep trying to but I need help so mi username is ZEKE147062
Thank you kindly champ 🤘
You know this is just so dumb. The other day I was trying to do this quest and there was this guy who had ALREADY beaten the quest and was wearing the other variant of indiana jones, and he was killing people who were trying to beat the quest. like SERIOUSLY??? Cmon.
I did find this the other day not realising I'd solved the stones but got killed no sooner as I went past the door by spikes in walls.
Can I get help with it my epicgames username is loverboilance11 help me
Hey look, it's one of the missions that sound fun in concept but get ruined by being almost possible since you always gettin killed by some douche player when trying to attempt it :D It's a nice idea that fortnite tried to bring some variety into the missions, but stuff like this does not really work with it's core game. Maybe make a forcefield that deactivates all weapons but you can only be in the for a short time or something like that.
man I can’t stand these challenges anymore i’d litteratly rather uninstall the game then have to do this
How do I know if thats the order?
V, Spiral, V,
I got Sun sun v sun
I done this challenge so many time and I put them in the right order can anyone tell me why it is not working for me pls
Thanks so much for this! The new poi is absolute chaos and I've been having a hard time finding the 4 clues! Oh and just for shits and giggles, I purposely got myself killed by the boulder!
I hid under the stairs near the entrance so that I can hear when someone is opening it. A player came and did the puzzle successfully. While the door was opening I jumped and killed that guy and completed the quest and secret rooms.
Stupid pricks keep killing me
Thanks for the help😂
I hate that fortnite does he dumb challenges when everyone in their mother land there, I kill everybody and when I go to look the door I die by some douche in a bush
HAHAHA DID YOU KNOW YOU CALLED IT A V SHAPE?????
bruh i did everything but for the secret room
How the f am i supposed to fin it if you dont go into different games with different maps and show us shit
Be more specific bro
The quest is hard I have no idea how to do it I keep trying to do it and I die every time
Tried alot, even rumble and arena and none worked, it's very challenging so i gave up eventually, it would be so much easier if people weren't camping and trying to kill meUPDATE  I finally got it after multiple trys I eneded up getting it finally
This is a very terrible quest.
I’m still confused.
Ha Chump go be idle and live your beautiful satisfied life for real🤔💯!!
i cannot tell you how frustrated i am with this quest, it's not adhd friendly AT ALL. i literally can't remember these things and i cant remember where each location is. worst quest ever.
Challenge buddy?
I took the relic and made it out but still didn’t completed the challenge wtf?
Thanks for top
do it in arena solos. close to no one lands there
This has to be the worst friggin quest of all time.
dude i cant even see the stones  i did 25 matches in solo and 25 matches in team rumble and still got killed by players even some of them got hacks, idk how fortnite can be played like that
That is so confusing
Bro my lobby is so sweaty
This quest is so hard because I keep getting killed it getting annoying
Square
Thank you so much
I really need help with this one
I am so confused
Thank you!!! Your vid is the most helpful all the other ones are trash!!!!! So thank you!!
I got it the first time but forgot to go in the stupid fucking door to actually finish the quest
How are your graphics so good!?
I legit did this and it didn’t complete it for me
I just waited until somebody opened the door and then killed them. I felt so bad for doing it too. But at least he made it to where you need to be to get the emote.
I died on the trap 😭😭😭😭😭
Not only is this quest already nearly impossible enough as it is, but the area is always populated by half the entire lobby, so I keep dying over and over before I even get to find the FIRST goddamn shape! Screw this game! 😠😡😤😤  Edit: I got it completed now. The best way to complete it by far is to just wait until someone else opens the main entrance door, then run inside, dance in front of whoever is in there (they're likely distracted with looking for the secret room), and run into the secret room.
Challenge is stupid smh
Is the code the same code ?
I love how the game can't just have normal quests and has to make everything overly complicated.
like 10 player there so i can't do it
See how he didn't shoot that guy until the guy shot him
They should have made the quest in creative THIS PEOPLE ARE SO ANNOYING camping at the place and wont let us even touch the door
thank you so much, there was one games where i had all the symbolls but i didn't know where to go.
This is so hard i tried that it was to hard
Does this work in Team Rumble? Or does it have to be normal Fortnite game modes
If y’all need help with this quest then try Arena Solos because there are less people that go there and sometimes there’s no one and when I was trying to complete the quest i was doing it in regular Solos and in Team Rumble and it wouldn’t work so I tried Arena Solos for the first time and no one landed there and I didn’t go around looking for the code I just switched them in a straight line from left to right but make sure to switch them one by one in order and that’s what I did but if it doesn’t work for y’all then y’all might have to find the code but yeah I’m so glad that I completed the quest thanks to my dear Jesus and my dear GOD and my dear Heaven.
This is so freaking stupid. A million people here every time
This is the most bullshit quest
Thx I did it in solos and all the people there were friends and then after.well it didn’t go well
It doesn’t work I spun the thing just how you said and it didn’t oprn
This is definitely the worst quest Fortnite has done.
What's up anmol
go into team rumble and wait for someone to do the code sht for you, worked the first time for me.  annoying ass ppl would literally rather put a laser focus on you and chase you down, trying to kill u instead of just finishing the puzzle and going back to the game, which makes quests like these annoying asf, especially if the award is mandatory for a prize or to progress further.
Good stuff Harry.  You're the man.
I know thats not the right code on the stones to get in cause i just tried multiple times. Whats the correct code to get in and not one that doesn't work??
This is the best video thank you
Thank you for this video all stones are in the same place just different order really helped out 🙏
Can you do this in team rumble
Omg I died
Thank you your epic
The worst part of this quest is that every single match, there are people that have zero interest in completing the quest and only chase people around the level killing each other there. I cannot put what I think of those people here as it is not fit to post. No one can cooperate or even take time to work on this. Too many jerks
Do we have to take the idol to complete it?
YOU DIDNT HELP ANYBODY WEIRDO
Litterally died to the stupid traps as soon as I went through smh
tysm bro this helped alot
Think this is the worst Fortnite challenge yet, they know people just kill each other when they make challenges like this right?
Fuck this stupid ass quest
I'm trying to do this, but the stupid gamers always kill me. Can't they see I'm trying to do something?! I wanna do it
I am raging so hard on this challenge
Stupidest quest ever!! Fuck fortnite!!!
Am I the only one who didn't notice the pressure plates on the floor that trigger the traps? I thought the traps just get activated when in range and there's no way to avoid them.
i reached the secret room in team rumble but it didnt count??? i even opened one of the 2 chests
Don’t do it in team rumble the storm comes in too fast even if you have enough heals
This was  HUGE help. Thank You!!
I can't do it with people killing me
Btw you don't need to look for the last one just do trial and error, there are only 3 outcomes
To everyone reading this STOP FUCKING KILLING ME
I was going crazy during this quest….
Tip: do it in team rumble. Everyone goes there, if you just wait its open and soon destroyed, so its easy to go to the chests and the crack in the wall without even pass the traps. I skipped all of that. Even its on the other teams part. Just wait at a distance and gather healing if the storm comes and then go. Its always open by then.

It’s impossible :(
You forgot to add the part where you have to run out of the cave cause there's a bolder that crushes you...I got crushed
Do you have to get the relic or do you just have to go into the room
OMG PEOPLE PLEASE WORK TOGETHER ON THIS
Nigga, this quest is dumb asf.🤦🏽‍♂
tysm it helped alot imma sub you guys should too!
Thank you this was a pain in the ass even in a bot lobby I kept getting crushed by the boulder
Who else literally just gave up on this challenge on how hard it is
Do I have to go in order?
Just hide and wait for someone to do the puzzle. Then finish them off lol.
It's impossible because people just camp it so u can't get it and kill u Instantly it pisses me off👇
Is it just me or is the tent not allowing you to put a mythic or exotic in
I did it! Tysm
I nearly had it on my first go but those fucking traps are bullshitt I got knocked im so pissed   Second thing I hate it because you can’t take 2 you can only get one which is Complete BULLSHIT!!!
It’s fuckin annoying to do especially when there’s other players around
Does it let everyone get the relic?
Tysm
xD  why are they teaming  up to go to that tunnel XD I guess I got the Emote TYSM
Way to hard
All the ppl was teaming up  with us and we  got in but the others died 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣we was like 7 ir 10
spent 4 mins opened the door and got killed by a guy camping in bush
Wtf is the convoluted nazi zombie easter egg bulshit doing in a game of fortnite. Theres no way to do this with everyone and their grandma landing here at the same time
I saw people teaming to open it they were all Indiana Jones skins 😂
This quest sucks so bad when there's 20 people in the area camping, gatekeeping rather than simply working together for literally 5 seconds then going back to duking it out.
Its kinda hard
It hard to do it cs people keep landing . like bry
This chalenges makes me want to tear  my eyes and skin off and eat them like soup
Does it count in team rumble?
Does it have to go in order or u just find all of them and do any order
this is hard
THANK YOU I was struggling so much
Bad vid doesn't work
2:12 go to THIS little room to complete the quest! And don't run back outside the room with the relic, because you will be killed by a builder lol
Thanks for the help, got the quest done, then proceeded to die to a boulder
Most annoying quest since the tomb raider one
I tried to do that but a bunch of people landed at the location so it was too hard 😔 But I did it after millions of tries
Thank you bro  I had it my died by the Boulder 😭
Is it like the Lara Croft Gold Style only one person can grab the artifact getting the skin, our for the artifact to appear do u need all the other challenges done prior...
So the order of symbols always changes?
Sucks knowing only one person per match can do it
It's so fucking annoying
Bro this challenge looks hard asf
I did this and a boulder smashed my face of😂
this is one of the most annoying things i've ever seen in this game
It’s impossible everyone just comes and kill u
How eo I know which order to put them in
Guys for it to count you have to run through a small crack on the right where there are two legendary chests! That's the spot!
