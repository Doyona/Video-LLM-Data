Hot take: milk by itself taste better than tea
I love my warm leaf water
me and my friend have been in debate on milk/water first and i WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YES! Im definitly steph. And i have 5 cups a day. my favoutite is english brekkie with half a teaspoon of sugar and a little milk
Milk in tea? That's barbaric!
Stop bashing on tea 😡🍵
Also that title is really rude
What do know about tea?
I like iced tea but other tea is good too
Warm leaf watter😭🙏
I WILL NEVER PUT MILK NOR SUGAR IN MY TEA! Bitter tea - good tea
WERES MY YORKSHIRE TEA
Tf you mean my tea sucks!!!!
The triangle bag is made of Micro plastics waiting for you to drink.
Well tea is best made in india where it's originally from
So the type of water isn’t that important? U got hard water? Or u got soft water? There’s difference and it should be mentioned
*LoL*
British people don’t know anything about tea, they’ve never actually had high-quality tea.
Don't add milk to tea, you just ruin the tea.
The milk mixes better because warm things rise up on colder ones, which means that the tea rushes up, while the cold milk rushes down. But since they are blocking each other, they mix naturally, making it smoother.
Kermit british
Used three non-porous materials, ignored clay, wood, copper and steel mugs. Guys, there is no difference! How is that possible, we used three materials with identical properties?!
Milk in tea is for those who csnt handle tea
not the DAD on the fridge made out of froot loops
The titile is arguably the BEST title on food theory xD
19:50
2:18 my favorite image of Matpat*
Pretty late to the video, but Matt using a table spoon to stir tea is horrendous.
CUPHEAD!!!!6:08
It may be historically actually to pour milk first but never in my UK years have I seen someone put milk first irl. I would guess that since milk is unanimously poured after coffee it has become second nature to do the same with tea. I appreciate the specific scientific times and measures that I can test and play with myself though it makes tea a little more fun and flavorful
only matpat can make tea so interesting
Oy am I the only one that clicked on this video cause tea is my favorite drink Is anybody else here with me maybe all right see ya bye-bye
I just find matpat's absolutely sleep deprived looking face near the beginning hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🍔
I've never done milk first outside of experimentation
10:49 Hmm, i'll try that next time i have a cuppa
Boil kettle Teabag in mug (sugar optional but mandatory in my case, 3 spoons) Pour in boiled water up to lever with handle Stir Add milk for creaminess and to cool it down a little Stir again Remove teabag (Optional on if you gently press it into the mug to squeeze out more tea essence) Stir Serve  AND DO NOT LET IT GO COLD!  COLD TEA IS DISGUSTING!!!
I'm British so drink tea daily Doesn't really matter what though. PG Tips, Tetley, Yahoo, Twinings, Yorkshire Tea. Regardless of what it is if it's normal tea then i'm drinking it. Never tried green or herbal teas cos they'd probably taste kinda mid.
When you do loose leaf tea the temp needs to be controlled to the decimal
i guess u cud call tom the briTEAsher
No sugar experiments? Distasteful! *spits*
26ml milk to how much tea?
Japanese style cup?
Now i want tea with milk
Milk in tea is good
Stay away from my tea mate
No sane person, British or not, puts milk first anyway. Please stop associating us with that barbarity. Though, I don't really drink tea myself, so I can't talk on anything else
Gong fu brewing is the best
That is the best cup of British tea I have ever had. Do you have videos on Japanese tea and Indian chai?
5:54 As Arabic guy i say: NO 🤬 Don't milk the tea  Edit:  13:35 I miss this guy😢 he 100% right
Missed opportunity to say  But that's just a theory  A food TEAory
Indians disappointed in a corner
6:27  i had a feeling steph just KNEW by noticing the wobble, thats why she put her hand out
Tea-ory
" no"😂😂😂
As a southern yall forgot the best kind of tea sweet tea and if you disagree with me then that’s ok
6:40 MORE 😂
2:58 KETTLE, YOU USE A KETTLE
I ran out of milk 😶
Down south, the only tea we have is sugar water with 0.2 ppm tea leaves
The humour I feel watching this episode while drinking a nice cup of tea.
As a british person i thought milk on top was always the british way
6:36 "Boston Tea Party Summarized" 😂
Matpat makes milk tea out of liquid milk?
Well as a Brit myself, I really don't think you've stumbled upon anything groundbreaking. I personally do the traditional way except with the milk last to control flavour and colour, also sometimes with single cream instead of the milk. I also add a teaspoon of sugar but never more, a teapot is superior, milk last to better control factors and very little sugar. Not whole bags of the stuff. You've not really dunked on the British but highlighted the flaw with the old traditions but if you ask most modern Brits (even royalty) they will say the same. Just saying you didn't really dunk on a nation, you just discovered what we already had, proving once again, we are way ahead when it comes to tea 😎
Im from England and we make it: tea bag,sugar,kettle water milk and leave the tea in for about a minute or two and use flat tea bags
The American tea made me and my Indian ancestors' gag SOOOO HARD
i just realized that steeping my tea for 8 minutes is not normal
As a resident of Assam I give a approval to what Mat said at 4:06
When ppl assume British people only drink tea and are very posh people sooo much. Ik they are saying as a joke but ppl actually believe this. ALSO WHO PUTS MILK FIRST UR A SYCOPATH
I rewatched this while drinking a mug of tea
Amazing video but I forgot all the weird gross comparisons and I was drinking something
Why would you do this
Wait, you add milk to tea? I always drank tea without milk.
I don't like milk on my tea, matpats opinion is definitely the right one
All of these tea puns are not tearrific
MatPat clearly never had a well made Chai Tea Latte from places like the Mean bean that was at one point in Morrisville NC.
15:48 the amount of times i rewound this clip is unreal
I’m questioning the authenticiTEA
MatPat is right, Milk doesn't belong in tea! ☕
I think the reason why milk ontop of the tea is better is because milk is denser then tea itself. So letting the milk sink through the tea allow it to spread the taste across the tea, clensing the bitterness. Putting the milk below the tea means the milk only mixed with the lower area of the tea, letting tbe tea above stay unmixed and maintian it strong bitterness
The amount of milk is down to preference I personally prefer builders tea any Brits will know what I mean 😂😂 also I have always put milk on top I have never put it on the bottom in my life
bro use masala chai thats better
0:33 Is this amicher hour
But tea started as royal ,upper class tradition they always serve tea in cups and offer milk and sugar separately so it’s mostly always tea first !!! So tea first is more British  You should get British granny not newbie
20:36 I love Skip,😂
Missed opportunity for an iroh  reference
99% milk 1% tea
I don think Bieng bwitish is wong
10:38 the Epic song?
i think you miss one style of makeing tea. chinese ways!
We british have always put milk on top as you your self told us only the poor use to put milk in first to help protect their mugs. the rich didnt care about the mugs could co it right 16:30 also just rilise the grapic is wrong at 17:20
British people took INDIAN chai and colonized it.
People in Iran eat around 8 cups a day and we don't brew tea in a cup we brew it in BIG kettles
4:36 the american way deserved punishment. God delivered. He cursed thy cup's handle.
This is absolutely disgusting tea shouldn't have milk in it and where is the red color of the tea as someone from turkiye which is in fact the country who consumes the most tea
3:41 Thing 1 and thing 2
Hi hi
1:06  you put milk in your tea !!!
I’m entirely British and have absolutely never heard of poring the milk into the glass first
Foodteary
9:05
actually as a brit i always put my milk on top
The only thing that could have made this episode more perfect is if it was a MorTEA
I'll just drink my southern sweet tea. Thank you very much
6:30 you can tell from that catch that Steph is a mom lol. “Mess predicted and promptly prevented.”
How I Make Tea:Add Warm Water Or Cold Water To A Mug, Put In Microwave For 45 Seconds, Take Out, Steep For 4-8 Minutes, Add Light Sugar Or Honey, Enjoy
I Am Not Even British And This Gives Me Intense Displeasure
Or as Uncle iroh calls it hot leaf juice
What does the M A S on the cup stand for I thought M for matpat and S of Steph but who’s A not Oli, not Tom. Anyone have a theory… A CUP THEORY
SOUth AFRICA MENTIONED  RAAAAAAAAAAAaa
⚠️You have alerted the British!
I actually pour my tea water in my water jug and pour the water from that jug into my mug because I cannot really transfer the mug full of water to the stove since I’m disabled and I also put my mug in the microwave for 90 seconds again. I cannot do it the other proper way because I’m disabled.
Surprised it wasn't Thomas
4:10 I'm drinking the Kazakhstan version of that right now
1:06  MILK!!!?!???!!!!!?????!!?? WDYM MILK!!!!??????
I’m 14 and even the American making tea at the start made me angry
Mat has the TOTALLY wrong opinion about milk in tea!
My favorite tea is chai tea or karak if you don’t know what karak is google it
This is my kind of Content
WHO PUTS MILK INTO TEA
What about how it's poured
I am from sri lanka and I know a lot about tea
How dear they!!!!
3:15 Crying in British 😭😭😭
I do my tea as chinese tea ceremony in woods, or mountains often
I put honey in my tea but I don't know if it is your cup of TEA
Im native american and i think tea = fish food
The only thing I learned is I am a tea master at 14 and with only Asian skills
I'm kinda suprised cause i didn't know people drink tea with milk
These jokes are to a tea
Me drinking 8 cups of tea a day
Best tea is Indian chai
6:13 you already have but ok
3:01 unforgivable tea making
now do chinese tea
MY DAD EATS 10 A DAY NO JOKE😂😂😂
I don't like t but I like matpat
Southern (not south) American iced tea: 🥲
The whole time this reminded me of “you’ll be back” from Hamilton we are back for the tea
PG Tips got rid of their pyramid bags, and started filling square ones with Liptons. 😂
How about the method of the people where the tea actually comes from? The standard Indian tea, tea leaves boiled in equal parts water and milk on stovetop, strained into a cup and with sugar added later! The smoothest cup of tea I've ever had.
Hear the life experience of a brotha! For God is good, greater than the greatest!
It might be suprizing at first, but tea can be used to increase muscle and muscle growth because of manganese ions
Uncle Iroh would be proud of you
Tea is best filled with sugar and ice, said most American southerners, hot tea with milk just baffles me, we used to go through 2 gallons of sweet tea a week when I was growing up
POV rewatching all the old videos just to see matpat again we all miss you❤
The indian version is the best. Try it guyees
I like Earl grey lots of sugar and cream.
1:55 we are proud brits
the british gaverment is puting matpat on a wachlist lol
No milk is best milk! Especially if you are lactose intolerant and Don't like even the idea about milk in tea! Sorry Britain but it is not for me! Big milk just wana sell their product into anything, what is awefull.
The best Tom line to be followed by a MatPat line: 5:21   Tom: There we are MatPat: Such a British reaction   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
But why not the microwave? I'm surprised they don't mention it.
1:08 MILK???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? IT GOES IN AT NOTHING  Edit: I would like to deeply apologize for the things i have said, i tried tea with milk and am deeply sorry because it is very good
I FORGOT I SAW THIS WHEN IT CAME OUT AND NEARLY *CHOKED* WHEN I HEARD MATPAT INSTAED OF SANTI
Not the cubs saying Mass without an s
Oh I forgot to say. こんにちは
Mat pat I would love to get a British accent
Make my tea by boiling water in a kettle pour the boiling water intointo a mug with a teabag or with loose leaf tea in a strainer and then let it steep for 5 minutes or if in a hurry use a hot water dispenser. Ps use a kettle if you can and also I’m an American who loves Japan and London and china foods I like china foods because my dads from china. 3:30
Now you’re my cup of tea 1:31
You should have called an Indian as our culture has the original chai(tea in english) just British stole it from us and made it Tea and Americans made it chai tea latte
This always reminds me of the tea tumblr post
British tea is way better than
Ok Irish tea you have tea first then milk and you base the amount of milk from the color of the tea I aime for a gold ish colour
Not me watching this video with 2 cups of sugar,  flat bag, and a 10 minute steep without milk in my cup
As a brit who watched this 2 years ago when it came out, I can confirm, I am still mad.
British here. Hot water. Tea bag. Stir. Keep stiring. 2-4 mins. Can rest for a bit but leave it resting for too long and you get the spots on top. Teabag out. Then like 3-5ml of milk. 10ml if you want a lighter tea.   Done.   Put sugar in it if you’re a child (or a builder I guess)
Here’s an idea put the milk in the middle  Poor little bit of the tea, pour the milk, then pour the rest of the tea
Guys, can we agree that Milk Tea is a different thing from Tea. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. I love specific milk teas (HK style milk tea)  but for at home? yeah im placing a tea bag in a boiling cup of water and thats it
as an asian, i cannot drink tea with milk in it, unless its boba milk tea or hk style milk tea. just to say, i can only drink milk tea if its specifically made for milk. NO MILK IN TEA-
I guess you can call this video tearific
It's hot leaf juice.
i never realized how common it is to add milk to tea, i just brew myself a massive cup and leave 2 bags in there for like 30min sipping occationally
I actually like bitter tea
UR FATHER IS GONNA DISOWN U IF U KEEP PUTTING THE MILK ON TOP OF THE TEA TOM😈
3:07 4:57  Tom physically cringing 💀
I like milk tea lol
Sweet tea is king of tea 😅
why does tom sound like wilbur soot
What about a tea cup those are smaller then mugs sometimes
I actually made the tea this morning and it tastes good
This video was two years ago so I don’t think this comment is going to matter at this point but I think that heating tea with water and heating water alone and then adding tea makes a big difference
They didn't try milk in the middle
I'm convinced a good amount of views on this video is from me lol I guess this is my comfort video now and I'll keep coming back whenever it shows up in my recommended. I don't know why but I really love this video!  And also Matt, I completely agree with you! Best milk in tea is NO milk in tea. :)
I prefer mine serve with ice
also bro forgot about the type of milk
bro 3 or 4 is nothing my parents go through like 20 a day
I drink 16 cup of tea bro what are you talking about
Still not a British tea
Amateur, *I* HAVE 6 or 7 (sometimes 8) cups of tea
Newton drank coffee.
Need to test water temp and water source as well.  Taking from coffee, there is a specific temp to start your brew at for water, there's also the bloom period, and then also the subsequent pours at a slightly lower temp for pour over coffee.  There is also filtered water, conditioned water (with a packet), and tap water.  This is easily a whole other episode for just those variables alone.
It depends where in the uk as i have seen in the north of england a lot of people add the milk last
I love this episode as a tea drinker myself.  But I still can not bring myself to putting milk in tea.
Incredible lack of professionalism. We need to re-instate "shame" as a response to the violation of cultural norms.
Now go make Karak tea, or authentic chai
Right shut your pie holes this is how you make tea, first fill the kettle and set it to boil, then get out your mug, put in a tea bag and measure out your sugar, then pour in the boiling water, let the tea bag rest for a minute, remove the bag and add milk till its cool enough to drink. This allows you to dissolve the sugar properly, gives time for the tea to absorb into the water and use the milk to cool down the tea.
The amount to puns including tea is ridicules.
The reason it was cooler was because it hit a secondary vessel which sucked heat out into the cup itself
Let me spark up some controversy! Here's how I make my tea: -Get Ceramic, Normal Mug. -Put water in an electonic Water Kettle -Heat the water to 100° *C* -Insert Flat Paper Teabag into cup -pour water -wait 6 and a half minutes -remove teabag -insert 2 teaspoons of sugar -wait for it to cool down a bit -enjoy!  Feel free to controverse in the replys!
The reason you should just use freefloat tea leafs instead of the pyramid bags is of course that you kinda drink a bunch of mucro plastic with it. Also are shops where you buy leafs for your teas allmost allways of better quality.
_Teavana_ brand (sadly owned by Starbucks now) _Royal English Breakfast_ is the best of that type I have had.  Expensive, yes.  But it is, in my opinion, how tea used to taste back in the day.
Although the glass cup might keep the heat of the tea longer, i believe that the scientific data was affected by Matt pouring hot water 3 times on the glass mug therefore making the cup hotter.
Does jiggling the tea bag make a difference?
January is national hot tea month
Tea is a form like soup, butter, milk not a set of ingredient.
20000 deeges
borwen yellow sweetey like and smill like orin
Wow I love tea and I never knew any of this 🎉❤😂
Poour the hot water ontop of the slim bag, slightly like a filter. Once done pouring take it he bag out and you've got your tea. No steeping.
You guys should make jokes of heigher qualitea
I boil my water in the microwave all the time. What's the big deal?
I always rinse out my mug when I make tea. Then I can use it again for the next cup.
Nothing like watching this while drinking a cuppa. However, milk is last I swear. God save the king!
0:48 hold on I just realised… you don’t reuse your mugs? I’m sure my fellow Brits do right. Or am I weird.
0:56 “Warm leaf water”❌ “Hot leaf juice” -Uncle Iroh✅
3-4 cups a day are rookie numbers anything below 10 is not worth talking about anything 20+ is when you start becoming a true brit
I'm Persian, and as one, I have to say our tea consumption country wide is EXTREME. What I do is: boil water IN A KETTLE, put 3 to 4 full dining spoons of dried tea leaves (depending on the time of day left and the leaves' size it varies), then pour the hot water in the teapot and put the teapot over the kettle, wait for 20 to 30 minutes and voilà! It's a lot darker than what I've seen in this video and probably more bitter, but we always eat sugar cubes or other sweets with tea and some ppl just like the bitterness, like me.
Fun Fact: Those little Coffee Mate creamer cups are about 12ml. So 2 of those gets you pretty close to the recommended amount.
6:39 those mugs are OBVIOUSLY not identical
I hate tea, I did my tea this way, and tbh, I don't know how did I manage to make it taste good
Should have compared cold brewing tea for hours vs hot brewing tea for minutes. The cold brewing may allow more flavor without the tannins. Or be a disaster on top of a waste of time.
Mug S is always stronger  S and strong:)
The puns lost me and I’m a sans fan
Eat my add
Why put in milk first, then tea bag? Brew the tea bag first, then add the milk.
The best cup of hot tea is in my opinion: No sugar (maybe honey on occasion), no milk, just tea. But I make an exception for cold milk tea like boba or other fun tea drinks.
I really thouht this video is going to talk about the difference between traditional Chinese tea and the tea that the rest of the world has 😅
Try indian masala tea😁
i drink my tea milkless and with some sugar (im american, i dont microwave it though)
Guys im tellin u tea with milk at the conclusion on flight is the best tea
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
What about different types of milk?
No Gong Fu?
Ruined an amazing video by making heinous claims about us "traditionally" putting the milk in first.
simple tea bags usually contain lower class tea though.
The best tea is ginger tea or as a Indian I call it adrak ki chai
Lol, I've been making tea right my entire life 😂
Giving you all an F grade for this one.  You didnt test whole leaf tea, nor the Chinese brewing method.
A splash of milk is the ideal amount if you are doing green tea.
I love tom's accent
5:21 british people's hope in tea restored. Thanks, Tom.
hear me out                           Iced tea
do you not just like, boil water in the kettle, put it in a cup, and shove a teabag in? why would you add milk!
as a Malaysian, we put condensed milk instead of regular milk. no need for sugar too
Meanwhile India: 1:1 tea to milk ratio. Perfection.
20:28, to take a screenshot of the summary of the video 😄
The only thing you should add is 2 cubes of sugar thats it
You didn't try metal cups or thermases
I am a tea addict and I can tell you never went in my life. I have E in the microwave or put milk in my tea. wrong. That’s just wrong. there is no chance that that is good. It’s not even here at that point. It’s just milk, water, leaves, and a hint of radiation.
One clear variable to test that you missed: microwave vs kettle for boiling. Sure, it was in the tiktok example, but all the other variables were wrong there, too, so it didn't get a fair experiment.
5:23
5.23 what matpat said I take offense to as a person who was born and raised in the north west of England
I js use teabag boiled water milk and 2 teaspoons of sugar
They would not like to see me putting heavy cream in my tea.
Agreed on the "no milk" point! I just never did it. I'm okay with the taste, but often times I'm not looking for decadent, just a soothing experience.
he really needs to have barrys tea
Guys they missed something 😨 would type of tea kettle matter too? Metal or china?
3:02 I sent this to my British friend. Prepare for war
why wouldn't there be a difference between milk in first vs last? You have a temperature difference, and thus there's a difference in tea flavour extraction.
3:03 that was an embarrassment of a tea
I agree on the “best milk is no milk” sentiment. The only reason that Europeans and Americans add milk to tea is to mask bitter flavor from low quality tea that passes as standard over here in the west. The vast majority of tea consumers, especially back when these traditions were being pioneered, were very uninformed consumers so it was easy to just blitz up the low quality tea and put it into teabags and sell it to westerners who didn’t know better. Having proper Chinese/Japanese/Indian tea from proper tea farmers absolutely never needs milk. You won’t get the same bitter astringent flavors unless you purposefully way oversteep your tea
That film on the top of your tea is because you’re using hard water.
Chinese People: The British stole tea from us! WE ARE THE TEA!
Tea bags are dust from tea factories that they sweep up, the whole leaf is where the flavours are at!
I'm English and i have never met anyone who uses 'a splash' aka 5ml / 1 teaspoon of milk in their tea!  Everyone I've met who has milk has between 1/6 to 1/4 milk.
As a civilization that tea itself is build upon, Chinese people even have different ceramics for tea.
In Britain, these days we make tea this exact same way, with the milk on top. But it's still not uncommon to leave the bag in - nothing wrong with an overbrewed tea. Though if it is taken out, IT HAS TO BE SQUEEZED, tannins or nowt! That's just tradition.
The only tea i like is LIBER- TEA!!!
Maybe I’m too American lol but MILK in tea? I also use cold brew bags
firstly, i sourced my tea straight from the plantation itself. a local specialty. that's because teabag that you bought from supermarket is notorious for being bland and tasteless. meanwhile the good quality one is dried tea leaves being sold in paperbag. also the brewing temperature is important. i suggest everyone to buy electric kettle with built in thermometer so you can see the exact number of temperature instead of just guessing.
I want to see English tea vs Frisian tea 🙂
Just make your tea how you like it 😂
Anyone else going back to mat pat vids bc the new hosts just aren’t as good?
I’m currently trying to grow a camellia japonica, which can also be used to make tea! It has a slightly different flavor than normal tea leaves from camellia sinensis, but it still makes tea! yay
I feel a bit hurt that no one from South Carolina was here
The only way to make tea is the southern way. Boil the water, remove from the stove/fire, steep the tea in the boiled water until desired strength, add sugar to desired sweetness while the water is still hot. The most important part is adding sugar to the hot water. Cool it down, and enjoy.
HOW IS THERE NO TURKISH TEA
Do you know any TEA is full of FLUORIDE, which is HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL to your THYROID ? (look for Dr Elizabeth Bright's work, a Thyroid specialist))
Something i dislike is the difference in brands, some brands are just better tetly > Yorkshire tea
26.5ml Who's gonna measure that into a 250ml mug? No one. But, round it out by saying, add one to two tablespoons of milk to your tea and stir it in... and you're golden.
1:15 Boil water add lemon,sugar and tea leaves then stir
*every tea related thing on the internet* *British people enter the topic with pride* Turkish people: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?😤  Jokes aside, Turkish people drinks more tea than British people. Dude we're known for cats, tea and tobacco😂😂
The chinese would like a word
The mug thing is so true lol , I stuff up the dishwasher after my daily dose.
The OBJECTIVELY BEST way to drink tea is obviously sweat tea
Could have had a Chinese person on, they have the oldest tea traditions in the world
*me reading the title* "Yeah it is none of your business f you" *Clicks on the video anyway*
“Boston tea party summarized” had me dying 😂
Loose leaf tea is the best it,s better then teabags
Bro learn maths properly
Matt pat is right about the milk
hot take:  i dont add milk to my tea
What is the best tea colour?
3:50 SOUTH AFRICAN TEA ROOIBOS LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO WO WO WO WO
I also find it funny, a video made on a site of a Chinese company, of an American way of making tea, blew up in Britain, and they are testing it with Indian tea leaves, now they just need something like African teacups, and they have whole continents set.
They testing tea from India, yet they have no Indians never mind, an Indian food YouTuber should watch this. 😂  I just realized, they’re doing “proper English tea” with Indian tea leaves, I’m not from India, but I’m pretty sure you’re doing it wrong.
3:17 I Hope you get how funny Asians find this whole American v.s. UK debate between tea.
A Chinese food YouTuber should review this, I’m shore they would find the start of this as funny as I do. They think their tea experts, teas not even native for them.
You’re wrong MatPat. I haven’t been making tea wrong because I haven’t been making tea at all!
6:30 Steph knew what he was going to do
I love that Tom gets paid to be British in this episode 🤣🤣🤣
Well I mean at least tea is half the caffeine of coffee, right? *looks at my work wastebin filled with 6+ cups every day*
as a irish person i am so anry he said we are british time stamp 3:55
Lol i agree with mat when it comes to milk in tea
Thanks for the tea totori'l 🇬🇧
Nah lol. Indian way which the british stole is the best
The uk is not even the number 1 tea consumer anymore its turkey💀
Me drinking tea as I watch this: 👁️👄👁️🍵
ppl, remember, Theorist have made the best British tea, not the BEST TEA which, as we all know, is Indian chai (1:1 milk and water with tea leaf[2*no. of cups] and sugar[1+no. of cups], boiled all together till it comes to boil at least thrice, once if you prefer weaker tea)
US southerner here, tea should have zero milk. Good tea stands on it’s own 👌
I love that phasing of classic British tea comes from assam in India. Nothing more british than colonisation
One lump or two?
Been up at 1 am in the morning looking for this exact video to re-watch, please put some tags like best British cup of tea or perfect tea etc 😭
In egypt if you're having tea with something like basbousa it's literally 10ml of water and the rest is milk
Mattpat: she lacked the international perspective she merely adopted tea but others they were born in it molded by it we needed Me :someone egyptian ✨ Mattpat : someone British Me: I have never been more insulted in my life
You concluded that tea was best brewed in a kettle instead of a microwave but didn’t actually test it? To properly test the flavor you would have had to pour the same amount of milk in the other cups also, at the same amount of time after the tea had been brewed.
I too, love drinking the occasional tasty leaf water with sugar
as a Brit, Steph’s amount of tea is scarily accurate to us in crumpet land
I have Bergamot flavoured Ceylon tea with 2 tablespoons of honey, 30ml of milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar
19:11 speaking of scientific method. Yes glass is probably a good insulator but it Also might be warmer because you used it to fill the other cups, thus warming it before drinking.
Gongfu enters the ring.
i agree with mat saying best tea is no milk in tea
This video has so many corny jokes I had to put a dislike
an entire nation clicked of this video the moment the ticktocker came on
You should steep loose leaf tea between 5-10 seconds for the first brew, and brew it repeatedly in small sessions gradually increasing the time.
The reason your loose leaf failed the taste test is because of the way you steeped it with that ball thing. You always brew it loose and then decant it into another vessel thru a filter.
Gongfu is the best way to make tea
If your tea comes in little bags you don’t care about the quality of your tea
19:30 I don’t think it was the type of cup that made the difference here. Mat poured the water from the glass into the other cups, while the water in the glass wasn’t transferred. The transfer of hot water can cause it to lose a lot of heat and this is probably what caused the temperature difference
as a briton i hate this video
I Liked Moroccan Tea
Thirstea 😂
Live action matpat is a different breed pure raw comedy
The glass cup was also hotter because it had been filled with two other cups of tea and the others hadn't
Just an average Indian chai with no sugar 😂😂😂
Well i am from india after china we have best tea recipe here , irani style  chai is my favourite 😂
thats just a tea-ory. a foooood tea-ory
I find it weird to see live action MatPat. Granted I never watched GTlive so I've always been treated to Stock photo Mat for-forever
My tea came in a circle disk.
my tea = kettle boiled water + teabag and honey and I will die by that
I keep forgetting how professional British people sound compared to Americans
Now he has a lot of cups in his sink
So basically what you're saying is that the British tea is inferior to the Australian style, which is almost all of these put into cultural practice. Cause when it comes to the cup, the best one is whatever you have to hand.
Most british people put milk in afterwards...
The real problem with this video is, that you think British people know what good tea is
Matpat is now on a list in britain for making that tiktok tea
Saddly i only have microwave ,stove
Tyler Field
this american tea makes me enraged... im danish
Dw abt the tea puns in time me and my friends had to do a “news report” abt the Boston tea party we made a lot of puns like a lot a lot
The brits brew the tea they took from china the same way the use the spice they took from the world
"Fermented"?   Most tea is NOT fermented, it's oxidized.   The fermented tea is the realm of "pu-erh", an obscure (in the US) Chinese tea that tastes like grandma's moldy sweat socks (not that I've ever sampled grandma's moldy sweat socks).
don't use a tea bag
How mach milk did the tiktok tea putrid in it.
How dare you insult our hot leaf  water. Tea is a prestigious beverage.
In Malaysia, we drink tea without milk or tea with condensed milk
I make tea in an old Stanley. Some times I forget about it and end up sipping on some three day steeped red rose
Fun fact: in Northern Ireland, whether you pour the water or milk first actually can be pretty accurately used to show which denomination of Christianity you or your family is. Protestants pour the milk first and Catholics pour the water first
1:50 wow such a steriotype, and im loving it
Indian tea is the best tea
“Hot or cold leaf water!!!”😺🫖☕️🌱🌿
Not trying to be a smart alic, but when you think about it, some different combos might also work well
Fun Fact: plastic teabags sloth off macro doses of microplastics str8 into your drink <3
Every time I see this I wonder who the a mug is for bc the m and s mug make sense for Steph and mat but who’s the a for
as a Indian try " kular chai "
13:35 yes
As a Russian who’s family is always drinking tea, I think…        TEA SHOULD BE SHARP AS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD AND AS BITTER AS WORMWOOD.   *like if you got that reference*
You are no longer British Tom
ngl their reaction is like when uncle roger react to jamie oliver fried rice 😂😂😂😂
What about round tea bags
NO MILK!!!!! WHOOOOO!!
At 4:24 be wmazed was there
I need to hide this from my mother so i can still watch your channels
Tea is the best
3 to 4 cups? Thats not enough
I agree with Matt, no milk = better tea 🍵
Their "loose leaf" variation involved dumping the leaves out of the tea bag—just what I have come to expect from the milk-loving Brits 🤮 who know absolutely nothing about tea.
4:00 that’s not a British thing, that’s a most popular tea in the world thing.
1:54 I thought you would need someone Chinese.
I don’t see how anybody can like any kind of tea other than sweet tea
Tea is from China British people know nothing about tea
Since when was it a British thing to put the milk in first? Its always been the British was to put milk in second, this is the only source I've e ever heard claim its milk first in the UK. Meanwhile having live in the UK my entire life, i can safely say every puts the milk in second...
"Pyramid bag" or also known as a sachet
Matt for your own safety don’t go to London they find this as a war crime and so do I
I know this is about British tea specifically but going down Chinese tea and especially the different clay types and shapes of teapot is on a whole new level
It just doesn't feel right without him😢
Steph is the Royaltea of the house. That ones an original.
No use earl gray is what l drink and I live in texas
The British stole tea from us
as a south african i think that rooibos is superior. everytime my relatives from other countries visit us, they take back at least 5 boxes with them 🫣
You should do an ep on Gong Fu tea
as a southern sweet tea drinker, discovering milk in tea is breaking my mind right now
Honestly as a british person, I've literally always heard to put the milk in last. My housemate puts her milk in first and reports she's constantly made fun of for it, so I think your sources might be off lol
As I am watching this I am drinking a nice cuppa, As we say in Britain
every time I come back to any theorist video I'm immediately reminded of how much padding is in them
Ah yes, using Britain as your base for usage and drinkage of tea, the people who historically didn't have tea of their own up until they colonized half the world and asia in particular
Wife's  a gem!(seemingly)
Matpat: There’s a HUGE difference between these numbers! Me: yeah the number 7
Of course, if you like tannins in your tea then all the things you aren't supposed to do go out the window. I brew long and squeeze the bag. Then again, I am in Australia an we make our own rules to upset everybody.
this offends saudi too brittan isnt the only one making a shiton of tea
Im chinese and I don't put milk in my tea 🥲  I usually prefer teas with fruits or herbs. My favourite is Chrysanthemum tea!
I'm from HK (Hong Kong if you don't know for some reason) so the tea(s) we drink here are very different and we don't add milk, sometimes sugar but mostly never. But most of our tea is bitter, but idk we don't like sugar ig 😂😂
Funny thing is it looked like Steph caught the loose leaf tea that Tom was going to dump on the floor... and immediately flung it back at him.
I got Water form the KETTEL in to a mug. Then tea bag. Then take out tea bag. Then bit of milk. And sugar if you want no more than 1 tsp though.
Tom is fine asf no one can change my mind 🤗
I want to see a video like this for ramen noodles
100% I agreed matpat milk do not belong in tea
just made a cup of tea while watching videos to catch up on and stumble on this video,   Yorkshire tea gold, obviously
What about cold brew tea
there are two types of people; those who have their tea straight and those who put an un-godly amount of addins into their leaf soup. AKA, Europeans and Americans.   P.S, I am the latter of the two.
In Brazil if you put milk in a tea you are officially delusional
8:50, it should be teapot vs gaiwan
3:46 there are actually only six teas. Anything else is heresy.
is it wrong that I just get some water put it the microwave at put the tea bag in than put in sugar I don't even use milk   edit:  brits please don't dox me
tea: tea bag sugar hot water~ from kettle milk  the best tea British perspective
to the tea lovers of the world: I like fruityer flavors so what kind of tea might I like?
the lack of representation for eastern, SEA, African, and any others tea types and preparations is bugging me in this video.
need a Japan tea food theory
In china, we just drink tea without anything else. It tastes amazing
not british you need...TÜRKİSH!!!(we drink more tea per capida than UK and we have more people than uk)
I like Nepal 🇳🇵 tea ☕️ more because they’re sweet and better
HK milk tea for the win
I’d love to see you put English tea up against Gongfu Cha tea ceremony.
As a Brit, I can confirm that I've ALWAYS put the milk second so....  The real question I have though, is do you take the teabag out before or after the milk?
STEPH AND I BOTH HAVE AN ADDICTION 2 TEA- WE R TWINS
I am so surprised water temp didn't come up!
I'm not british but i have tea and i still dont know how to use a tea bag i just pour tea powder in the water and boil it.
When you said you’d bring out an expertise I was expecting a Chinese or Japanese, but then you brought out a British 😂
the perfect amount of milk in tea is no milk.
I think bruv said stwonga 11:51
The best amount of milk to put in Tea is no amount of milk in Tea!
Bruv that is barely Tea! What is this supposed to be! how disrespectful!
i started crying during this video because of the tiktok tea
Being British the water goes first 100% and if u put milk first just stop
Everyone talking about tea I'm supriced that stephs instincts told her to put her hand under Tom's tea filter and after she did he accidentally opened it lol
13:38 someone give MatPat a masala chai. He'll change his mind.
What type of milk is it
😅My nanny sees steph as an amateur tea drinker she drank 10 cups yesterday😂 (nanny=grandma)
7:54 something i want to mention that tea quality is huge. Loose leaf will always be better than paper bagged ones. Bagged teas tend to be cheap tea dust and not tea leaves.
This is how I make my tea: 1.Boil water in a kettle 2.Pour water into cup and add tea bag 3.Let it sit for a couple minutes then take tea bag out 4.Add milk and/or sugar/stevia/honey
why do the cups say "mas"???????
I don’t put any milk in my tea😐
“warm leaf water” gives the same energy as “hot leaf juice”  “how could a member of my own family say something so terrible?”
As an American with South Africans in my bloodline I want to say that the only correct amount of milk in your tea is no milk. (Also Rooibos is the best tea)
6:23 tom wyd lol
You didnt test how much tea to put in. I double the amount and steep for less time. Even 3 minutes gets too bitter for me with no milk. I don't want to use milk if I'm intermittent fasting.
He forgot multiple factors  1 what kind of milk 2%, whole, cow, goat or other kind of milk  2 what about fresh of dried tea
E 3:30
Ive only had tea with milk once and it was called a "london fog" it consisted of ice, half a cup of milk, half a cup of earl grey tea, and 1 pump of syrup. I remember kinda liking it but not too much
10:59, i just put the entire bag in my mouth cuz i didn't want it to drip on floors while i threw it away
The british way isn't it. People who drink mixed ground to a powder old leaves they raided from halfway across the world shouldn't share their opinions. I'll stick to my gaiwan. Always dump the first steep
3:16 so the tea horrified them, what about calling British people “britons”
I drink tea from a glass straw and a 500 ml glass cup :) dont judge me
How to insult all of india, russia, turkye and all the other nations that see themselves as big tea drinkers :D
I love how Americans make fun of brits for having bad teeth when they have worse teeth and get them whitened
Milk belongs to the cocoa drink, not the tea.
how do you not  have a kettle , I live in f-ing africa and I have one ,literally everyone has a kettle
New question: how much sugar/honey should you add? I add it but British people probably won’t add sugar
I did an experiment in middle school that confirms mats suspicion, if you want to keep your drink cold go for cups with small openings. interestingly enough, the total sa also matters as a spherical shaped glass was second worst instead of thee worst. I would assume wine tasting applies here as well, so maybe your tulip glass be perfection
Tea with milk is disgusting
No, you need someone Bengali
The way I make my tea goes very very far from this, which feels wrong I make my tea with a microwave because I don't want it too hot and I let it sit for 5 minutes. I also squeeze the tea bag, add lemon and sugar, I really like bitter tea is that weird
After scrolling through the comments I feel very alone…I don’t like ANY type of tea, nor have I ever in my 25 years on being on this planet. Literally EVERYONE I tell this to gets so shocked and offended. Idk what it is about tea; doesn’t matter if it’s hot, sweet, bottled, etc…fact is, I hate it all 😕  That being said tho, this episode was adorable 🥰
I’m offended
You didn't actually *test* the heating with the microwave though, you just did the throwaway tiktok cup and called it. That leaves way too many variables swinging in the wind. Just saying, none of the other variables in that test were controlled for to isolate the heating method.
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA yes i'm british how could you tell
You should look into yerba mate way more cracked than tea.
i've never putted milk on tea before
The tea might be sweateay
Want a cupa tea
Fun fact in India they boil the tea leaves in milk with barely any water
"The key to wisdom and tea is proper aging."   -Uncle Iroh (2006)
Do you have recommendations for powder milk
An enitre tea theroy episode, and no reference to Uncle Iroh.  Reitred or not, you had one job Matpat. One job
The glass, china, and ceramic cups you used are all non-porous, have large openings to allow for smelling the tea, and other than the ceramic mug have thin lips, so yeah, the only real difference between them would be how well they retain the temp. The Brits use those china tea cups specifically because it allows the tea to cool better and be sippable.
3:06 bro just made Chai... but with water💀
Like this if you come from after he retired
im british and before this video i already poared milk on the top
I made my British friend watch this. We are no longer friends. Curse you,  Perry the Matt Pat
Theres zero tea facts in the making of this video.
Wait, other people don’t re-use their mugs?
HOW MUCH MILK UHHH. N O N E. (also why are you only saying brits care about tea, i enjoy my tea aswell but i make it the way i want it personally, so theres no actual BEST tea)
Right so sometimes I have a lil emmm well rage because of what Tom says bc he is older than me he doesn’t always get things about British things right and I have a punch and well my phone is the one that gets the consequence
New food theory: Milk first or cereal First????
I felt like no longer existing as I watched him pour that milk into that poor cup, and I feel milk has place in tea, sorry matpat
Does mat know he can spread the flat teabag in the middle
it's not the bag buddy it's the fact that bougie teas that get sold in the nylon triangle bags are usually better quality teas so ofc they taste better. try the same tea in the different bags and it will make little to zero difference.
The puns were quite plenful today.
please respond so i have a way to get back to this video
I’m British and I do hot water in cup (hot water in kettle) and then sugar in cup and then milk (ratio about 2tea:1milk) and sip
I have a qestion
You should pour hot water into the teacup ahead of time to prewarm the cup and then pour out the water just before you add the bag and pour boiling water from the kettle to make the tea.
As a British person should I be offended orrrrr ?
事实证明，茶就得苦着喝。
Very technical. I had to show this to my mother.
You guys should have used small glass cups also why share the same mug O.O was awkward to watch the entire time.
Bro I just add lemon and honey to dandelion root tea
I like to boil and froth my milk into a cream with cinnamon and dump it into my chai ❤
Tea is life ❤
Came back to watch my first introduction to Tom, Game Theory lives on in him 💚
they basically figured out what china did, because tea comes from china. people calling the british the #1 anything tea is crazy. they really convinced the world theyre more tea than china! CHINA!
0:31 well! the dishwasher is full of tea, cups!!! if you know you know
I'm the tea master of England!
You don't put milk first thats blasphemy 😂😂😂 as an American
I never knew so many people drank tea with milk. It just seems so weird to pair together
This episode helped me sever tea better at an aged care place I work at.
How bad
There is a large varie”tea” of tea’s
As s person living in Assam India ( 04:03 ), I assure you tea plantations are literally everywhere 😂
Funfact never make faluse coffie whit soda last
Food theory: this viral tiktoker who everyone's mad at for making tea in the microwave did it wrong! Me: yeah no duh
Best cup of tea: 20 oz water at 200 degrees F, 3 teaspoons loose leaf russian breakfadt tea, steap for 3 minutes in a french press, and enjoy
And here I am letting my Irish Breakfast tea steep for 15 minutes 🙄
I have never liked tea before, but following the instructions from this video, I actually enjoyed tea for the first time in my life.
Indians: who needs tea bags😭
Use a bloody kettle you American family in Britain
I’m sorry what insane person puts the milk in first.
I learned something new. Don't think I've never put milk in tea. I didn't know it was a real thing. I thought that was just a quirky thing or an honest mistake.  Is that on the Starbucks (and others) menu? I'll have to experiment at home.
I am British and I’ve always but the milk on top everyone I know does that too. This idea we do it differently is just your friend he is not our representative
The only time I microwave water for tea is when i dont have time to boil it
I wish Matt would have mentioned Ronald Fisher's famous story about how he invented null hypothesis significance testing to prove that a woman couldn't tell whether the milk was added to tea first or last. Such a cool story that puts tea-tasting at the center of modern statistics and science
0:54 sir you have offended uncle iroh (from avatar the last air bender ,for you uncultured swines)in 135764 languages
a british 'friend' told me that you shouldnt add more than a tablespoon of milk and "he knows some idiots putting it in 1:2 ratio" but when i asked which is milk in the ratio he just said "you dont want to know"
They never talked about the sugar….
Have you tried a basket infuser?
Y’all put milk in your tea?
Great episode but a little bit disappointing because I thought you were going to also test whether there's a difference between infusing your tea with water of with the milk directy.  Supposedly,  you can get the best flavor by dipping the teabag in the milk and THEN adding the water.
13:36 Matt spitting facts as usual
But what about if you warmed up the milk beforehand to not cause a drop in temperature in the tea? What about the difference between a room temp cup and a pre warmed up cup?
2:55 I felt like throwing my phone across the room!
My dad always drinks coffee every morning. He drinks it in a thing that screams at you whenever it’s done.
ok, but why not the microwave?
User error is why the pyramid bag beat loose leaf. That should never happen. Skip the milk too. Blasphemy.
Uncle iroh entered the chat:TEA!!!
ayo letsgo
You monster for putting milknin first! Plus its best to put it in after to gage the strength. People like different strengths and sometimes you can only get it right by the colour which you cant do if you put milk in first. 😅
WHY YOU STEEPING FOR 3 MINUITS JUST GET YORKSHIRE TEA IT ONLY TAKES 15 SECONDS
Dang it, I'm allergic to tea but his is making me want it
Milk and sugar do not belong in tea or coffee.
I LOVE TEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (i drink a 3-4 700ml cups of tea a day)
The best amount of milk in tea is no milk, and that’s a unanimous fact Don’t put milk into my water
If there isn't an Uncle Iroh reference, I will be disappointed.
this is how i learnt i've been agressively oversteeping my tea for years and thats why it always tastes like dirt 😭
Can you try indian tea
what british person puts the milk in first? tell me who does this so I can remove there citizenship personally
What? Tiktok tea is what i have been drinking for a decade.
My dad calls tea salad water😂
Hear me out, lemon juice. Just try it, add a splash or two to your tea
Ⓜ Ⓐ Ⓢ 6:40
the way Americans make tea makes me ill
tasters!.,.................... assemble AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 😂 , edited,,.......................... ........................ Oh wow thare is
i lovee your videos🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
they did it, they got it down to a TEA
this is roughly how i was taught to make tea by the Canadian half of my family, surprised i've been doing it mostly "right"
My opinion: Just tea, nothing else.
Now make an episode on pizza
you need to use yorkshire teabags
Why why the whole thing of milk 🫥
Wait a second, why did you end with the pyramid bag when everyone agreed on the teapot?
Hot cocoa made with entirely milk is superior to tea
I can confirm that we Brits were, in fact, molded out of tea
You know the bit where the UK looks at the US microwaving their tea? That is literally how all of Asia and the middle-east look at the UK. Did you not watch a SINGLE tea video on youtube that wasn't US or UK?  Especially since your partner really loves her tea I would highly recommend looking into that direction and move towards using real loose leaf tea. Surface area makes a huge difference in tea and if you're a company that is trying to make as much profit from each tea bag then a tea dust is both extremely cheap to produce but also packs more punch. This, of course, at the cost a surprisingly lot of flavor.  I myself am European and I used to be a tea bag guy as well until friends of mine gave me a Japanese style tea set which send me to the internet to figure out how to use... I haven't touched a tea bag in 5 years since then.
Speaking of theory. The reason why many people in very warm climates still drink coffee and tea even during hot summers is because it makes you sweat. Which sounds bad unless there's a good breeze going then that sweat will quickly evaporate and you get to enjoy a little thing called adiabatic cooling. Which is why you sweat in the first place, it's to cool your body down so drinking something hot on a hot day can actually be cooling, just make sure you drink enough so you don't get dehydrated.
I feel a huge opportunity was missed here.  I am a tea head and I have found that the far superior way to prepare tea is the gong fu method.  I don't accept the results from this video
20:00 for eneyone who will do this often
Gonna be annoying Asian person here but the people who are the real tea OG experts are the Chinese, not the British
ill stick with the sweet tea i love, i dont care if its not real tea, its tastes amazing
Oh say can you say By the dawns early light What so proudly we bear In the twilights bright gleaming Andnthe rockets red glare The bombs burting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was till there Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave In the land of the free And the home of the brave 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Very inTEAresting video
what is more cursed?  "a proper British cup of tea" or "Tiktok Tea"
Always milk in top that's what the majority of us brits do anyway ,I was in abject horror at the beginning of your video when the lady put the water in the micro wave honestly I am scarred for life,Thank you for explaining to the USA how to make a good cup of tea,Also I didn't see any sugar go in ,now that's another level of tea making your missing out on .😊😊😊
''Boston tea party summarised" That was amazing
Drinking out a measuring cup makes you look like a hipster, so that’s my preference lol
I think the experiment is flawed because if you add milk, the bitterness calms down. So what might’ve been too strong with only water, will be more balanced. Maybe labbing out tea w/ and w/ milk and comparing the difference?
Ceramic kyusu teapot, loose leaf tea, filtered water, warm the teapot before steeping. Best tea imo
(as a a polish person) in poland if u put milk into a tea you WILL be looked at like a maniac
Can’t believe they live in North Carolina and don’t acknowledge southern sweet tea as superior
I drink green tea w no milk or sugar but this video was still entertaining!
The british stole our teaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I hate tea
could it be that the loose leaf was just over-brewed in the first test, and was not, in fact, inferior to the pyramid?
You need a tea cosy for the teapot.  Keeps it way hotter.
What? My mom drinks like 6 or 7 a day WHILE IT'S SUMMER
"Bleh! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!" "Uncle. That's what all tea is." "How could a member of my own family say something so horrible? We'll have to make some major changes around here!"
The classic tea is not British tea. The classic tea is Chinese tea.
Steph and Tom saying "why are you putting it in the microwave!?" And "that's too much milk!" At the same time made me laugh so hard, but it was also SO painful to watch that video with them.
Tea sucks and so does coffee  Fight me
The microwave bit does. Not. Matter.   Temp does microwave bit seems just pretentious .
I average 6 mugs of tea a day lol. also i steep them for hours by accident sometimes
tea bags are trash.
6:08    so everything buy the  the blends of tea you use... lol or the sugar? So many varieties.  You testing bags a d cups lol
Now we just need a theory on Apple Cider and I’ll be set.
Got to 6:07, gonna place my answer here to compare later. 1. Best shape & material for tea bags. Answer: None, you should use loose leaf tea. 2. Best milk x tea ratio. Answer: The best ratio is no ratio at all, please leave your tea alone. 3. Correct order of events. Answer: NO FKING MILK GOES IN THE TEA. 4. Amount of steeping Answer: Depends on herb type, I guess we're not considering water temperature and herb quatity. 5. Best vessel for tea Answer: Chinese porcelain
i keep gettin anoyed everyone in britain believes their the leading tea maker but its us asians who made it first its actualy our specialtea (im indian specifly)
im british and i dislike british tea
Milk on Tea? at that point just drink coffee XD I mean "Milk Tea" is a thing,,because tea doesn't usually have milk,, What's next,, pineapple on pizza?
If you like adding more milk you can leave the tea to steep for longer because the bitter gets mellowed by the milk. Also my brother would say putting the milk first the hot water "shreds the dairy" while if you add it on top when the water is cooler the dairy flavor stays
what a waste of time.
welp i guess im doing it wrong(im british and drink it without milk)
british are known for tea, but what people dont know is that turkish people drink the most tea. yet, people still underestimate our love for tea.
people put milk in their tea??
As an english - i have NEVER put the milk first. I personally think thats treason ngl
0:04 Make life the the lemons back! I don't want your darn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these?
as an indian watching this i can say you all are wrong especially the brits
what about the sugar?!
Okay is it literally just me or does anyone else add almond milk to their tea? I like to add 1/8 of the cup almond milk and just in case if I have too much it will taste really good with the type of tea I usually use. Before adding almond milk, I add honey because it might not disintegrate if the almond milk is in there before the honey.
What made me laugh the most about this is the fact that everyone over here in the land of tea and crumpets gets p of wen your put the milk in first 😂
I think mat's favorite subject in school was science 😂
My perfect cup: 0% milk, 1% tea, 99% sugar. 😅🙊🫖
All the irish -> lyons > barrys. Pyramid teabag ftw
Wait, people put milk in tea????
Did they mention how much water they used in a cup?
I do Lipton tea in the microwave cause its more for the creamer flavor anyways.
You should have milk in your tea and I am from the 🇺🇸
The Chinese way is the right way
milkk in UR TEA?????????????????????????????????????????????????????? why
so long but just remember its just a theory. Food theory is my favourite because i can use this the most in my life  i love the channel enjoy your life and enjoy you're family
As a Turkish person the only correct way to make tea is with a steel double teapot using absolutely 0 milk
Traditional Chinese tea with high quality leaf needs no addition, it has naturally sweet flavors from the leaf and notes that you will miss if you add anything. If you want an international perspective, why not try it the way it was originally made, not how the brits pulverized low quality leaves?
Though. I'm tempted to say with the idea that teapots make the tea colder.. When you're adding cold milk on top of it, the Mug tea coming out hotter might be a positive rather than a negative.
hey i do sience, 3 peers... u taste!
... but what about the sugar?
What about the honey
The best amount of milk in tea is no milk.
"This channel is built on the premise that I can overthink anything and write it off as a business expense."  I mean so far he hasn't been wrong XD
THE MUGS SHOULD HAVE SPELLED OUT TEA
As a turk, I wanna say that   Hahahahahah amateur I drink 5 cups a day f you
Agreed with matpat. No milk in tea
1:06 Wait what Who puts milk in tea
seriously, is there no discussion between skim, 1%, 2% whole milk or heavy cream?!
my and MatPat touths on milk in tea ar the same
Tom's British license was revoked after this episode aired
Indian tea not getting a mention is truly sad
The idea of Americans heating up their water in the microwave is the worst thing I've ever heard EVER Cmon people! Get a proper electric kettle already! This is painful
Alton Brown and good eats did all this - time, flavor, etc
Um Matt II drink tea and I've never put milk by T only honey so um yeah I think I can try to put milk in my tea next time but I don't usually put milk in my tea cause I drink tea I just only put honey so um yeah
We’ll miss you matpat
Now, me drinking tea while watching this, I was wondering for other types of tea, and what about the other sorts of milk? For example, I’m lactose intolerant, therefore I have to use lactose free milk, but what about the other sorts of milk as well?  Anyways, just me being curious : )
I actually like a tea with a bit of bitterness so I like squeasing the bag
Chinese Gong Fu brewing is just the superior way to do it.
I drink tea everyday, and it’s not even tasty it’s just comforting, I think many Brits would agree 🤷‍♀️
Now what about the sugar or honey??? 😂
My response to tick took tea 💂🪖🔫🫖
Where does the egg come in?
take it from a british person with an emoji pfp tea is just boiled water, tea bag, and milk on top
This should be revisited more competently. Microwaving the water for the tea makes no difference double blind if you do it correctly and that should be obvious to anyone with half a brain.
End the puns NOW!
They are talking about tea but based on british like wow, even the tea in india is planted because british want to compete with chinese produced tea
Im sure some english guy just ran to the kitchen and tried this, then got angry that ut was acrually better😂
I still don't understand why a heating the water up in the microwave is a bad idea. The microwave will boil water if you're worried about it just put a toothpick in it and it will start to bubble boil but really 2 minutes you'll start to see Steam it's boiled then you just make your tea the same exact way you make it with water from a tea kettle. Don't get me wrong I actually have an electric tea kettle use it all the time because it's convenient and holds more hot water and I like a lot of tea but for a quick cup I've never noticed any difference between the flavor from heating the water in the microwave. The one thing you never want to do is put the tea bags in before you heat the water that's where you start to ruin things
Something Im really surprised this video didn't touch on was the height at which tea is poured. My neighbor growing up was British and his mother was a very traditional British woman. When she made tea, She insisted that the tea had to be poured at least a foot away from the kettle to the cup. The increased height adds air i guess and makes the tea taste a lot better. I have no idea if that's true or not. But that was her thing. And her tea was pretty darn good.
Tea bag ,sugar,  water , milk there you go
Briteash approved
17:05 and why not used the microwave? It's taken for granted as wrong, but other than with the Tiktok way of doing it with other variables affecting the final product, microwave vs. kettle is never tested.
Best cup to drink tea is traditional Turkish curved glass cup 🇹🇷🫖🐺
lol now do this with southern cold sweet tea
The chinese method is better
I use these metal tea baskets that fill most of the inside of the mug. Perfect for getting a full steep with plenty of space for your leaves.
Test Chai at some point
Although I’m not a tea drinker, I’ll always tune in for an episode of food teaory.
the best and most healthy tea is the tea you forage yourself!   I recommend stinging nettle :)
> Warm leaf water  "This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!"
No mention of using freshly drawn boiled water ideally filtered, and milk should only be added first if the tea has been brewed at the ideal time separately in a teapot. Not so much essential but Porcelain would be the ideal vessel.
In Ireland we but the milk on last in some houses
I'm surprised you didn't consider dipping the tea in hot water VS pouring the water over the tea!
lets be real, perfect ratio for milk and tea is 1:1
As an Indian, It literally hurts me to see that they included loose tea leaves but only to put in that bubble thing? The fact that most tea comes from Assam/Darjeeling, which is in India! They should actually try our version!  Loose tea leaves are supposed to be boiled with the water first(or just after the first proper boil), and then add freshly grated ginger/cardamom/flavorings and then add the milk at the end and bring it to full boil(three times, no more/no less) then you just sieve it into cups...  I have no idea how people just put in raw milk without boiling it first :( And 3-4 teas in a day is actually less, North Indians usually have like 5-7 cups a day. I'm a Punjabi, my mom has like atleast 6 cups everyday!
Matpat, how about you actually COME to the UK to try our tea
I will never drink tea the same again
No dairy, maybe some raw honey. Loose tea is best
2:58 ARGGG MY EARS! AND EYES! AND SOUL! ITS BEING TEARED OUT VIOLENTLY AND LEFT TO ROT ON THE FLOOOOOOOOOOR!
Am I the only one who likes cold tea ;-;
WAIT MATPAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW MUCH WATER DID YOU USE DOES THE AMOUNT OF WATER AFFECT THE TASTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW MANY TEA LEAVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DRIED, WHOLE, OR PROCESSED LEAVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MATPAT I STILL HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Episode Idea: is Tea Toxic? Reason: does drinking TOO MUCH Tea cause health issues? What negative health effects does each kind of tea cause in high doses and prolonged periods of use?
2:56 as a britt myself, this is hard to watch.
This is bri'ish tea, not Tea
Loose leaf tea is best prepared at lower steep time. Therefore,  loose leaf tea wasn't done justice.
im a pretty old british person and i was always taught by my mum to put milk in last!
I personally prefer loose leaf
I mean, I don't believe that microwaving water really makes a difference (as long as you mix it well), but brewing tea in a luck-warm diluted milk sounds... Well, not appetising.
A Canadian here. Although I have seen the traditional British version made here, the way I’ve always made it is:  Water in kettle Boil Add teabag into a mug Pour water in the mug Wait for it to steep Add any extras (Milk, Honey, etc)
my boy Matthew Patthew said "Queen Tea" when RoyalTEA was sitting right there
and the steep temperature ?, that´s missing , it matters a lot at what temperatura is the water
0:17 For me, it is apple cider
17:06 I stopped using the microwave…   I now use our coffee maker to warm the water instead because it does the job in less than a minute. May not be traditional but we don’t own a kettle  At least it ain’t the microwave
Is it just me or does anyone not put any milk in the tea
13:35  **Everyone in Turkey agrees*
I am a bit sad they didn't test hard water vs soft water, but then I realized it probably didn't matter
As an Indian, we have been doing the British tea with milk on top since the Brit’s introduced tee to India.
Tic Toc tea should be classified as a war crime
I agree. Best milk is no milk in tea.
That's one way to interrogate a British criminal 4:50
Sugar though......  not a lot, but a tad is excellent with tea you have over steeped  especially it can bring it back
Try India tea
For hot tea... no milk! Milk goes with Boba tea
Me watching this Dam well knowing that I don’t like tea or coffie
tas-tea
the turks🥺
but what about fruit teas??
"this channel is built on the premise that I can overthink anything and then write it off as a business expense" -MatPat (completely seriously)
tom: there we are matpat: such a british reaction
As a Pole, we don't put milk in our tea. Instead we put sugar, lemon or honey in.
As a Brit - the actual convention (one and only way over here tbh) is 1) tea bag in the empty mug first, 2) pour in water from the kettle, 3) brew for 3 min, 4) splash of milk.  The milk first was way way way way olden' way of not breaking porcelain.
i just know iroh watched thsi
Why are we putting milk in tea???
As an asian I feel personally attacked by the video of the first amarican makeing """"""tea"""""".
What about herballl
Brits would be mad at me…     But I drink iced Asian tea (Usually jasmine or Thai)
"Fish food" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
so the only thing whe as viewers can witness is the color of the tea, so why youre not using transparant tea glasses, so we can see something?
this video is a total waste of time, someone should pin this comment
RULE BRITANIA, BRITANIA RULES THE WAVES, BRITAIN NEVER NEVER NEVER SHALL BE SLAVES!!!!!
are you sure you weren't looking at Tea-Tok (I'm so sorry)
milk or no milk really depends on what tea it is for me
My fav food theory episode
Please use indian recipe
The American South beats the UK out for tea. Not even sorry.
as a brit i have always had milk on top
I was hoping that the Indian way of using a steel cup would be represented.
Wait, britts put milk in their tea? And they call themselves kings of tea?
im sorry but you just figure out how much milk you need to add to the tea by color, lol. thats it
2-4 cups a day 😂 rookie numbers
13:12 1 part milk for 47 parts tea I the ratio 1:47 or fraction 1/48??!!!
You're wrong. That's not how I make my tea
all teasarediffrent i just got one that asbolutly such t has no flavor and says you need to BOIL  it for 5 mins
WE NEED THE BEST TEA EXPERT HERE TOO    *UNCLE IROH*
4:00 Sobolo for the win! (Thats the tea us West Africans have)
forgot about water tempreture
In fact there is an essay by George Orwell that explains it.
I'd like to see this done for iced tea, I hardly ever drink tea hot.
I'm British the tiktok tea had me dying
what about temperature?
I would have been curious to see how the loose leaf tea steeped in a mug infuser faired. During the work week I use a teabag, but on the weekend I use looseleaf tea. I have a tea mug with a large infuser. The mug also has a ceramic lid to keep the tea hot while it steeps.  I’ve always put my milk in last so I can judge the color of my tea. I just need to drop the sugar habit which is so hard to do. Im a So one of those people who loves to drink their tea piping hot.
tbh i prefer milk-less tea.
Bro the Americans only think that bc they put ur tea in the microwave use cold water n put milk in before the water n no sugar💀
I'm with Matt on this one. No milk in my tea.
It’s Indian tea
15 cups of tea were made in this
Mas
Theory: "Proteins in milk can bind to the tea polyphenols thus decreasing their antioxidant capacity"
like!!
Dude you have so much energy haha
Sure the British tea ☕️ is good but the best tea is from Ireland 🇮🇪 lads
That's silly. How can you measure taste?
Water temperature?
This is a quali-tea episode This filled me with positivi-tea I can go all night long…
as somewhat of a tea snob, i object to western style brewing. (also much of modern tea, especially in bags, is straight up dust.)
hot take: gong fu cha.
Triple pun 1:19
I am from the UK and I LOVE TEA
Murchies has the best tea!
In my country India you boil water then add tea and then add milk all while boiling
I think another thing that should be looked at is coffee brewing. The best ways to get a strong coffee or a better "tasting" coffee. Does a Keurig coffee machine actually result in a better brew than a French press? Does a light roast or dark roast have a higher caffeine count?  All great questions imo!
Not trying to be annoying, but I don't have space for a kettle. Can I use a pan?
Honestly just seeing him even somewhat mention south african rooibos tea was an odd thing as a South African
As life hands out small green leaves from asia, i think you need to find someone asian to find their way to make tea
Just so you know, the reason that pouring milk after tea tastes better is probably because it keeps the tea hotter. Essentially temperature decreases much faster when the temperature is higher (temperature decreases at a rate proportional to temperature raised to the fifth).
I feel like that woman that made the TikTok tea needs to make a YouTube apology video.
Teabags are a crime tbh loose leaf is so much better
Good ol southern sweet tea is the superior form of tea.
Milk never goes first, you're a heathen if you think otherwise!  Anyway, I imagine the milk first only is relevant when the tea is steeped separately in a teapot. When you brew in the cup, you don't want a bunch of cold milk reducing the temperature from the outset, as well as interfering the the water's ability to absorb hot leaf juice.
British don't know what real tea is either they stole it from the asains
Make Lemongrss tea!
Cant say ive ever actually seen anyone put the milk first, im english btw
Come now: putting cold milk at the bottom of the cup would disrupt the tea-brewing process.  Let the tea brew first.  Then start adding sweatener and milk which will lower the temperature of the water and stop or slow the brewing.
Even British tea isn't made in Britain. Do they have anything original that's good?
I make tea with a coffee maker is that bad?
when i saw this video, I decided to make me some matcha tea
Sequel for other tea variants?
I've always microwaved my tea
As a bri'ish my way is; Tea bag One sugar 1\4 pint of Milk Hot water Wait 2 min and done
Why doesn't steph just reuse cups??? My dad just uses the same mug throughout the day (he doesn't even rinse it. He drinks tea as water.) (We're british)
Im gonna fight any british person that pours their milk on the bottom, who is fancy/rich enough to brew their tea in a seperate holder before transferring it into the drinking mug?? If you are adding milk, then brewing your tea in the milk filled mug you will be found and you will be finding these fists🥊🥊
Chai or tea
Food theory idea: the effect of different dish types on the experience of food. I read an article a long time ago that consuming food with plastic silverware registers to the eater as richer and of higher quality
do you think tom likes eal grey
Bro I'm a floridian and I have a kettle
always great to know there are people who love low-brow puns like me
honestly I like tea with out milk, since I'm from the southern states i drink sweet tea, but I'm perfectly good trying other tea.
ok no i got annoyed so here is my basic tutorial on how to make tea, from a british:  1)get yorkshire tea bags. must be yorkshire 2) boil water in kettle 3)put tea bag in mug then boiled water on top (doesnt matter how much) 4) put in milk (only a sploosh) then take out the tea bag and squeeze it. You squeeze it after since it has not been in the cup long  5) Optional- Add Sugar/ sweetner  this is the only way i drink tea (unless im having a day where my body decides it doesnt like milk, in which case just take out the milk step)
The reason to put the milk or cream in first is that the pour of the tea / coffee mixes the milk in for you whereas when you put the milk in 2nd, you still need to mix it a bit.  Knowing it somehow affects flavor though changes things.
Well as a southern milk is absent from my tea just water, ice, tea ,and tons of sugar . Perfect southern sweet tea.
I shared this on my pintrest! It's to good!!!
I drink tea, not every day but at certain times I'll crave some leafy soup. I usually drink mint tea, I like the aroma and in all honesty. But thanks to this video, now I crave milk tea. 😂
What about the type of milk though
tea hitting matpat like its addy
Drink tea how ever you want ❤😊😅
i prefer a green tea but i am a american
Any Brit will tell you, the milk goes first in a cup, second in a mug, because with a cup, you are making the tea in a teapot.  By the way, dupping a tea bag in hot water is wrong.  Put the bag in the mug or teapot, then pour boiling water onto it.  You have not yet tried a proper cup of tea.
Turkey: drinks the most tea Uk: drinks the second most tea  Me : is 50% Turkish 50% British Also me: *certified tea lover*
I was today years old when I learned that milk can be an ingredient in tea
Alright so I found before the first commercial break, a variable. It wasn't controlled for. How finally the tea leaves were broken up. The bags that you get will often have a much finer, almost powdered tea leaf as opposed to the loose leaf tea which is a whole leaf. Leaf. Much like coffee, beans and the grind level, this can affect the extraction of the T and drastically change the flavor. Also, there's no guarantee that you are getting comparable tea from the three different sources, especially if it's pre-manufactured. Just doing some overthinking myself.
I'm from the UK, born and raised. Once at my aunties house I watched her put the milk in first, this one moment started months of arguing between putting the milk In first or not. So yes it makes a difference. Milk always gose in last. L.A.S.T
as a british person who doesnt drink tea, i was disgusted by the first clip
That was a peasant tradition
Drinking 3-4 cups of tea a day isn't wild at all. Stop making it worse than it is.
How I make tea as a British person: Teabag in Boiled water in  Squeeze the teabag til it's strong enough Take it out Add milk Sugar
Every time i watch this i get reminded, ive always maide the perfect tea, even before this channel existed
I need a coffee theory
Yeah, but like I’ve heard some cultures steep their tea multiple times and entirely disregard the first steep, so..
I personally enjoy all of your puns. Keep it up.
As someone who just started this taught me how I should make tea. Although I agree with Matt. No milk better
Bro just have bekfast tea in order first tea steaped for 6 minutes then milk finally a lot suger
btw tea is chinese it was adopted by the british on acident
buy actual loose leaf btw they are bigger grain and better quality
you shoudnt use a tea egg for loose leafe other filters work beter
i saw you in the fnaf movie
Watching the three of them in the kitchen is like watching my dad and my sister trying to cook. Not much happens, but they giggle the whole way through.
the British are just snobs, thinking that they're way of doing things is "sophisticated" and all others are just simple-minded brutes.
What about my manatee tea bag that hangs on my cup it’s great
"Leaf water", "tea", what's the difference?
"It was the only verbal that didn't effect flavor."   The tea kettle and cup test: i don't exist
Tea must have milk
The Chinese have entered the chat.
I have an electric kettle that I use, but I still don't think that heating water in a microwave would affect the flavor of the tea. Just be careful not to burn your hand.
As a British person I can say Yorkshire tea is the best type of tea.
I’ve realized how American I am with my purely milk no water English breakfast tea heated up in the microwave with the teabag in the microwave with it followed by stirring in a lil honey… however I have elected to not care because it tastes fine and it’s a nice flavored milk drink
u sould have done maTEAreals 🤣🤣🤣
I understand that some people like milk with her too, but I don’t really like milk with my tea
constrained loose-leaf tea. Grumble. Those ball things are trash.
I always understood the saying "milk first and English" was about class, as you noted in part - excluding English vs Cylon teas. In light of that, the upper class would add the milk after while, again as you noted, the "masses" would add it 1st.
3:37 I agree, tea is best without milk. You can enjoy the flavor more without it.
This tea just tastes like hot leaf juice  Zuko
new top comment or newest :D
No, you do not put milk in and then tea on top because that is not how tea is really served.😂 Tea starts with the water you select.😅 I just noticed you're using typ of tea so he actually knows nothing about tea.😂 You're using the wrong type of mug and that's smothering the aroma instead of letting it unfold. 😢
As someone who used to only drink tea made from tea bags then switched to loose leaf tea i will say it tastes so much better than you realize. Most of the tea we have at home right now are loose leaf teas and have all kinds of delicious things in them.
I prefer loose leaf tea
I am a British and turkish person and people should not put milk in tea
Oh wow you should do more food theory videos with Tom Robinson in them, he totally made this video amazing!
Proof Yankees can't make tea try real southern tea
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
This hurt my BRITISH brain
I agree with matpat, tea with no milk>>>> (I drink green tea though….)
i love all these tea jokes XD
Y’all ain’t talk bout sweet tea vid invalid lolol
Use this comment as a like button for the perfect coffee episode
Of course your different cups tasted identical, they're all similar mugs. Not like you grabbed a metal or plastic cup.
I’m new to tea and I still don’t understand why people put milk in it.
I'm British and feel like the only British person who doesn't like tea and agree with the title
Your supposed to put milk in your tea?💀💀
My parents always put the milk in first, but I always put it on top no idea and I don’t know why.
are pyramid tea bags still made out of plastic?
Most British people like me do it with milk on top
No milk best milk
am i the only one here who never heard of adding milk to your tea?
PLEASE try Indian tea
I drink Arizona tea
1:06 What psychopath puts milk in tea?
Heating water in the microwave is dangerous becouse one can heat the water above the boilingpoint. If you do that and you desturb the mug the water will implode and brake the mug wich flings boiling water everrywhere.
We brits have the best tea and nothing is going to change that
Ok, Great formula, but what volume of water for that volume of milk?
Is it acceptable to heat the water in an cleaned coffee maker instead of boiling it? I stopped using a microwave for it ages ago, and just started “brewing” my water after thoroughly cleaning my machine.
who puts milk first??
Oliver has found your action a war crime
I wish you compared microwaved water and kettle boiled water too
As a northern English person we always put the milk on top, I think putting milk in the bottom is weird, bloody southerners 😂
Why not microwave?😂 boiling water is boiling water, it doesn't matter how do you reach the temperature right?
When I heard (correction, saw) the title of the video I was going to follow the name of my channel and throw a chair out the window. You know for fun.
My name is Stephanie. I drink tea (prefer chai with whole milk and sugar. Or green tea with honey.)
lmk if there's a earl grey tea brand that I can find in the US that has pyramid shaped sachets
I'm British
Boston Tea party summarized killed me.
As a hamliton fan it makes me happy to hear mattpat saying “ok we will give in to our overlords Here’s our taxes.” ok Mattpat I see you talking about the tea tax
3-4 cups a day? Weak. As a Brit, I regularly see people go through 10 cups a day. Sometimes more.
Ok but like am I the only person who puts a whole lot of honey in my tea
Without too much tannin flavor 😅 so what if I like the taste of tannins
Another possible variable that could be tested is agitating the teabag while it’s steeping, because I know I like to agitate my teabags especially if I’m using the flat paper bags
Ok, you need to make part two. And the @thespiffingbrit will agree  - you did not disclose the optimal temperature you used, and you continued to change the outcome by heating some cups before using the tea. ( using the glas cup to transfer water, no wonder the others cooled of more quickly)  - pH and O2 contant of the water which also effect the aromatic experience - hardness of water. High hardness will lead to a  Sedimtation of key aromatic compounds.
Who’s beeen putting milk in first
I'd love to see your opinion on using condensed milk in the tea instead of regular milk
Does no one do it like I do?  Instead of leaving the tea to sit there in a steep, I just pour the hot water through the bag. I find that it releases the perfect amount of flavor for me.
Why not blind taste test?
Guys! The 5ml in the mug is not accurate using a mug as historically the English drank tea in a tea cup not a mug. And in that situation the ratios would change?!?
The same brand with use different grades of tea in different bags/loose.
The glass may have been hottest because you preheated it by measuring with it.
Now that you're tea experts what brand makes the best tasting cup of tea?  Tetley?  Red Rose?  Earl Grey?
Okay I must love bitter tea. I just let the tea bag sit in my tea until it's gone. But I hate it when I steep it for only a few minutes. Please tell me I'm not alone T-T
what's the deal with the microwave?
Im not british but milk in tea you guys are monsters
I really dont like adding a splash of milk. Either have no milk, or 80-100% milk for me
I saw no test comparing kettle vs microwave. Can't say it's right or wrong without testing it 😏
I personally don’t like milk in my tea
I tried milk and tea hated it. I love my tea I grew up in Belarus so I drank tea
As an Indian, we usually boil milk with loose tea leaves then sieve the leaves. It’s beautiful.
Me who already makes my tea like this 😂
Best Milk is indeed no Milk
So many puns
How dare it not be Yorkshire Tea. Give me Yorkshire Tea or give me death.
I want a follow up with gongfu cha, the Chinese traditional method of tea brewing
i drink 8 cups a tea lol
milk on tea is just so disgusting
I never use milk in tea and I never heard of it before watching this
13:22 “Meeting”, sure. Matt had a merch meeting, and didn’t just have to go to the bathroom after drinking so much liquid at all 😉🤭
Milk in tea is gross would rather have sugar in my tea.
WHAT? Food Theory got a BRITISH PERSON?
I don't have pyramid tea, do bags work
Excuse me. I don’t drink hot tea i drink iced tea
i really only like berry tea
No milk in the tea is my best experience
Milk in tea , you are all insane !
Fresh water is important as well, need that oxygen in freshly boiled water
Putting milk first always was for the lower classes. 😏🧐

"How Does One Open This Bag" -Tom    2022
Let me introduce you to Indian Chai.  Put a pan on the stove with some water, add a tea spoon of tea leaves (tea bags exist here but nobody uses them), add your sugar, ginger, lemon grass (optional), and cardamom (people add other herbs as well but this is how I like my tea). Bring the water to a boil and then add milk. Let the concoction boil. Once is boils turn down the flames and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. The more you cook the better the tea but don't overdo it or it'll turn bitter. And here you have Chai which tastes way better in a steel glass. Cheers.
Hey mattpat, my bf has no sense of smell and my brother doesn't either, how do they perceive taste? I crave to know
Come to Iran 🇮🇷 for the best Thea
cough syrup and fanta
Need to try southern sweet tea made in the sun.
A 3 minute tea must brew for 3 minutes
Steph glazing Tom fr
Dont blame a propper british brew you! Coffee is like ten times worse!
🇬🇧 Im British and me and my sister have alwase put the milk in second. ☕️  Our dad puts the milk in first and we told him it was wrong, thanks team theory for giving us the evidence to prove it to him.  He still dosent listen though...  😂
All those consecutive tea puns was just plain naughTEA 😂 LOL
as a british person this was agonizing
Iroh would be horrified.
3-4 cups a day, amatuer
I would drink tea more often but I have so little cups that can hold hot liquids maybe only six cups that can hold hot water but all are able to hold only a small amount the rest are plastic or some glass that shatters when I pour hot water in them.
i love tea my dishwasher i also filled with tea cups lol
I have been brewing my chai entirely wrong ig. I let the flat bag soak for too long, squeeze it once it's done, and add too much milk honey and cinnamon  Update: I tried making tea the ideal way (as best I could with the supplies I have) and WOW it is so much better
I'm from Alabama so I make sweet tea by the gallon, put it in the fridge, and drink it cold. And it's my favorite thing in the world.
Matpat is right, milk has no right to be in tea.
Man i love tea . Also the end result is just a normal cup of tea .
Now I want a video comparing the British way of making tea and a Classical Chinese way of making tea
i am briish and have never had milk at the bottom
if tea is a lifestyle for the brits the tea is a god for turks
No milk in tea is the best
Im srry, Im not brittish, and i hate milk in tea, i will stick with my loose leaf english breakfast tea with lemon and honey, thank you
Do the tea puns lay the whole video?😭
Its always made sense to me to put milk last. I just thought that boiling water could burn or curdle the milk and that's not nice at all! Frugality isnt usually associated with luxurious taste.  Addendum is I like a little bitterness, not a lot. But i like the contrast in taste, so I'd leave the bag in there for about 4 minutes and then give a healthy splash of milk. Somewhere in the middle between the 5 and 20ish ml i had going on.  But then again, one more disclaimer is coffee wins hands down.  Coffee is my love!  P.S. i swear Americans based on this portrayal are trying to mske their tea with the ratios for instant coffee... Which is just a deep betrayal of coffee and tea.
This was good. Definitely made up for the McDonald's purple milkshake video! 🙄
as a brit i don't think ive ever met someone who pours their milk first - ITS A CRIME
Ayo I realize how dumb I am
Oh, and also I don’t have anything but I microwave so I do the microwave team. I’m sorry to the British people but it’s the only way I can make it.  I’M BEGGING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS PLZ FOR UR FORGIVENESS I’M SO SORRY
20:01 oh yeah also, if you microwave water and take it out, you might see its not boiling... if you touch the water it explode violently and SERIOUSLY INJURE you. Superheated water is not a thing to play with.
My soul hurt when i saw that one family put water in the microwave. And im not even British
Morale of the Story: Make tea correctly else Brits *WILL* come burn your house down. I'm a Brit btw that woman should feel ashamed of herself for making tea so disgracefully on British turf >:(
You stated to not microwave the water but gave no evidence for a difference in taste or experience other than burning your hand.
19:46 *boils hand cutely
shoulda tried turkish tea
It is shocking that I could not find a single Uncle Iroh joke in this entire video.
“ your tea sucks” ur actually trying to cause a riot matpat and I am willing to start it
.....sweet iced tea is the only way I can drink it
I love that Matpat has (and I googled it) 140 IQ the average presidential IQ is 118 and is also 87.5% as smart as ALBERT EINSTEIN!
You come to the Caribbean.  Paperty bags are dunked in water after the 3 minutes of soaking. For loose leaves we tend to cover our teapot so that draws very strongly.  My guess is that Barbados still retains its British colony habits
I use an electric kettle to make British tea even though I'm an American. A little milk and a little sugar will take you a long way. You see, I put in this little thing called _effort._
2:58 STOP! YOU VALAET THE LAW!
I have found out, that even historically the British have been making tea in a weird way. As many used the 2 teapot method, where in one, you brew a strong blend that's left for too long, therefore making the tea leaves bruised, and have that bitter, metalic aftertaste. In the other teapot there is hot water which is then diluted with the  strong tea, which doesn't make it taste any better.
I don't know how many british people have betrayed us, but i don't know anyone who puts the milk in first.
Making dumb puns and having conversations about the most mundane stuff ever isn't a real food Theory video... But that's none of my business
I like ice tea more
Apologies -- Did I miss the test where microwaving the water was determined to cause a difference?
15:44 this so adorable!! I love it when Matt gets so happy😭  Also I love Tom not just because he's british but also because he makes small comments that are hilarious
Milk is just poisoning tea.
MatPat: Now I poouur the milk in. Steph and Tom: **visible pain**
By using oceanic science from high-school, it'd be known that by applying something cold to the top of something good warm would produce a type of "circulation" which is why certain places have naturally more warm water than others
What was the moral of the story? Stay as far away from tiktok tea as possible.
...now I need a cuppa...always, always pour the hot water ACROSS the bag, don't put the bag in the water!  I do, however, steep for 5 to 10 minutes AND squeeze the bags. Otherwise it's cricket p|ss. Also, only enough whole milk to turn it blond
1:06 Yall put milk in your tea?
As a British person I was slightly offended when they added so much milk to try put in the TikTok tea
Imma try making this for my parents... wish me luck
Tom did it wrong. You warm your teapot, and teacups. Then you brew it.
no one gonna talk about how everybody dressed up like they were goin to a funeral-?
Milk on Tea!!! Nooooooooooo no cow juice please

Disappointment they didnt actually compare a microwave heated water vs regular boiled water.   They microwaved only one cup and it was one we already knew was garbo method
How to threat 70,000,000 people Step 1:Make a “tea” making tutorial Step 2: Get every British person to watch Step 3: Put tea in a ——> MICROWAVE <——
WHAT PIECE OF S*** ACTUALLY MAKES TEA BY PUTTING IT IN A MICROWAVE
As a Brit, I can 100% say that not a single soul in the UK has EVER poured the milk in first, so I honestly have no clue what he means when he says Brits should be pouring the milk ontop, since that's what everyone does anyway...
I was kinda hoping to see them test if there was a difference between hot water machine, kettle and microwave water for the tea but this was still so cool :D
not including Vietnamese tea is criminal
I love tea
What we make tea with isn't a drug idk why but people think it's a drug
I drink morroco tea and I drink 3 tea pots
15:46   Matpat: boing boing boing boing boing
Fun fact: I partook in an experiment close to this, and about a tbsp of honey adds a nice amount of sweetness!
I not a fan of tea and I still enjoyed this episode.
Is it me or I didn't hear once "tea-ory"
i've never heard of putting milk in tea before this
Don’t tell the Brits… I cold brew my tea. 🤭
You forgot the circular tea bags
When they tested the microwave they only did it the tictok way. I'm curious how different it would taste if the had used the pyramid bag and added the medium milk on top with both microwave and kettle. I'm assuming there would be a difference, but how much so? And then if would have been nice if they tested different types and amounts of sweeteners.
Bro just angered an entire country
As an English person we put tea first then water
matpat u have to try chai by making it yourself chai si made in a whole different way
I’m a little sad that they didn’t let the looseleaf float freely in the water and then straighten it out and instead used the strainer that they did to hold the looseleaf cause then it’s no different than the bag because it’s all scrunched up in there
Milk goes last, in all foods.
Im so confused loool, the british drink tea the perfect way with milk ontop. I hardly ever see anyone add milk first
I don't like milk in tea either
This episode was good... except for saying that brits pour milk in first. I'm not British and don't drink tea but, having lived here my whole life, I was experiencing second hand anger. Everyone knows to put the milk in last, to the extent that putting it in first is ridiculed on TV very often.
I simply add Many Tea leaf Plus 100 Cow milk
I'm Texan and to me this has way too little sugar and I agree no milk is the right amount and it's too warm
I feel like a cool episode would be pouring to the test hot vs cold drinks. Is iced or hot coffee better? Is hot chocolate or chocolate milk better? Is iced tea better than hot tea.   I've got a theory that for tea, iced is better because it makes it more flavorful, where hot cocoa is better because it retain amore flavor. In the water episode you used room temp water so you could taste the flavor, so it should be put the the test which is best. Hot, room temp, or cold. Heck, try it on soda too!
As a Kentuckian, I don’t really care about fancy British tea, although it’s probably quite tasty, I care about sweet tea.
As I am British, I was drinking a cup of tee while watching this.
So I'm not a psico for pouring tea before milk.
Can't get enough of the tea pun 😭
Guys... I don't steep tea I put the bag and the sugar pour the water stir remove the bag and drink
They did try a lot of variables, but if some, let’s say, in a dorm is unable to use a kettle then a difference between microwave water and kettle would be nice
milk first may be traditional, but the majority of brits will agree milk second is best! However i do think mug affects the taste or overall experience of the tea, it may be psychological but it has an effect, i also think the place you have it does too. for example, i work in a cafe in a museum, it gets really loud and chaotic in the kids holidays and i notice adults who dont have kids complain or seem less satisified when they have theres then compared to when its less buy, and people will say "this is the best cuppa ever" but its the same brand they usually have but the memories of the museum add something to the experience!
me who drinks rose hip tea with a teabag with honey and 5-8 minutes waiting
you forgot about the sugar dude
As a British person I don't like tea
As a Brit, I’ve never seen someone put milk before tea
My friends from Azerbaijan would make their tea with two pots. One very concentrated pot of tea and another with just hot water.  You pour in as much of the concentrated tea as you want and then add water to dilute. It's good but I do like a chai latte
Don't know if anyone made this joke, but some of these teas are monstrosiTEAs
Is there anyone from the UK who Hayes tea or is it just me???😅
Literally nobody I know puts milk first except one guy I worked with who dus not touch it other than making it for others he eventually got it right
Putting milk in tea.... why even drink tea?
.. mentions color but never shows the color
😅 I think only gamer will understand why this makes me laugh out loud
I liked newspaper having funny n good tea facts and the brithish way changeeed well from on now this is realiTEA get it
loved toms reactions oh here we go oh yeah there is are the best ones
I know I’ve already written many comments, but if you want the avocado to grow maybe add some sugar.
The tea to milk argument is like the and the cereal to milk argument are two breakfast themed problems we need to solve.
Tea tip: never brew jasmine/green for more than 1.5 minutes!
Tea bags vs open tea, what’s your opinion.
I have a lot of tea per day!
Little milk and milk first, clearly is better if youbprefer no milk in tea. Like me
I reallly want some tea because, i just watch the spidevers multeavers
The British military knocking on matt pats door
I reckon most folks who heavily milk their tea do so because theyve over-brewed it and the milk mitigates the tanins.
If you didn't make the tea and dont know how strong it is, you add the milk last, to titrate milk against the tea strength/colour.  Ive never put the milk in first and dont know anyone who does
I'm British and I make tea exactly like this with 1 TEA spoon of sugar
Ah seen your using twinnings tea. It’s a tea for people who are begging their leafy journey.
No one puts milk in first. All British people know that!
3-4 cups is a meer starter lol
There exists an International Standard. British Standard BS 6008:1980 "Method for preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests"
Have the tea in a cereal bowl, trust me.
The only way to drink tea is sweet and ice cold
As someone who's ability to taste and smell are not fully functioning (I have been noseblind since I was a wee babe), I overbrew my tea, and I hate milk in my tea. If I want anything besides "mm yes hot water" it needs to be strong.  If I'm feeling deluxe. I'll make cocoa tea, by brewing my tea like normal and then adding hot cocoa mix to it and stirring that in. It gives me this earthy, rich chocolate taste, but the texture is still not all that creamy, and it goes down really well. I definitely recommend.
Meanwhile Indians - Chai 🫶
Us Indians be like : hold my chai 🇮🇳
Milk in cup first is only for teapot tea cause the water is already infused in a teapot
Ok like am I the only one to put honey in my tea instead of milk?
you guys did not tested the heat from microwave, elctric and conventional kettle.
Why do americans microwave their tea , my fellow reece told me of this and I just fell dumbfounded  STAY AWAY AMERICANS OR USE A KETTLE YOU DEVILS .
This is like super later, but if MatPat sees it cool. My theory on why it tastes different having milk first is because the hot water my be cooking the milk. Milk is easy to cook and burn thats why custards and such need to be watched and stirred often. But thats just my theory.
I usually i usually brew my tea for 6 minutes and put in a lot of milk lol
13:35 at some point watching the video i had to pause the video and rant to myself how base REAL tea is just the hot water+tea leaves. once you add milk to that it becomes something else ENTIRELY. It's no longer "tea", it is "milk tea". matpat is right on this take. haters gtfo.
I don't care what anyone says, I'm boiling my water in the microwave. Ain't nothin but hot water, it's faster and yalla bein Boujee for no reason 😤
Science fact!  If you put the milk in first, your tea will stay hot for longer. And the food theorists said that the tea with milk in first tasted a little sour. But then everybody adds a bit of sugar right? Which you didn't test sooooooooo Maybe the brits still actually have it right
If u hear tea one more time…      *Hears it one more time*👁️👄👁️
treason
Listen to the name, tea bag Originally the teabags were designed to just hold the tea leaves
I never knew you put milk in tea. That must be why I find tea disgusting. I’ll try it with milk.
You should also try drinking tea using a Turkish tea glass (tulip shaped)
This is the most British video ever
I'm not sure why I'm watching this episode, seeing as I don't like tea.
You should do one where you run these tests on different flavors/types of tea. Personally I take my peppermint tea steeped for 5 mins, water from a kettle, 2 tablespoons of milk on top, 2 tablespoons sugar and mix! It is soooooo yummy and it helps me sleep!
CHAIIIIIIIII TEAAAAAAAA
I didn't realize my sister was making tea while I was watching this and I genuinely thought the whistle of the tea pot was a sound effect you added
Ok, so now we know the proper way to make “British” tea.  But what if we don’t want the “traditional” western style of tea? I actually prefer the eastern styles of tea.
Wait. The british way is putting the milk in first? I always put it in 2nd.
Ive been making my tea like this forever... I guess I make the best tea
In India while making chai (Indian Tea) we first but tea leaves directly in boiling water for a minute and then put milk in it and again let it boil for few minutes
I’m British and don’t put milk in my tea, but also it’s not tradition to pt milk in first I dont know anyone who has done that.
Haha I drink 5 cups a day
I love that their mugs at the beginning are my initials in order..lol MAS
This is by far one of my favorite episodes. Well done! I’m saving it for a few months down the road when the weather relents and it’s not 83 F in my room at 11 PM…much less the mid day heat. 😂🥵 Cheers!
Well the milk thing is interesting. When using a teapot, the tea is already brewed so don't think when you add the milk matters. But when using a tea bag some of the milk will infuse into the tea leaves first and will cause a different taste.
I will forever find this incomplete as they didn’t test how sweeteners affected the tea
I don't use milk I boil the water I add the tea bag put cold water and add sugar and then warm bam you got your tea ma'am also please don't at me that is how I was taut to make tea and I am 11
As as Indian: this tea isnt it😭
What can I say.....Chai is tea steeped in hot milk which has been boiling for over 30 mins. Yes, I love tea.
mhm look at Turkeys consumption mhm(I am offended as a Turkish person
Milk absolutely doesn't belong in tea.  Sugar either but some teas are good with a bit of honey.  No milk of any kind though. imho
I agree with mat's "best milk is no milk" as I've never put milk in tea before
I'm gonna try this. I'm really not a fan of tea I've tried many types and I have just never liked it.. It's jut hot water. there like no flavor ever
I love how they had to get somebody British to help them
I swear this video was made to make us brits invade them and teach them how to make tea
Make sure that your tea bags are not plastic as it takes a surprising 18 months to decompose (as you can tell, I live in England).
Bottoms up let's forget tonight
I committed a great crime while watching this video. I love both coffee and tea equally so I will often have coffee first thing in the morning and then drink tea during my first break at work. While I was distracted during the milk tea section of the video I accidentally poured coffee onto my tea ball… Let’s just say it’s not doing coffee or tea any favours… Don’t try this at home, it was a trageTEA.
No British person ACTUALLY pours milk in first that’s psychpathic
tea is for babys
What about sugar?
I agree Matt, no milk, then again I don’t really like tea
They still didn't test whether water boiled in a microwave or pot was any more inferior than water boiled in a kettle. Boiling is boiling until science proves otherwise
I was in the store earlier this week and someone I was with said something about tea biscuits...then this stranger gave us some helpful information about tea biscuits... Which is why I am watching this video again. I wonder if you can make an update next year?
I'm an American and but I love hot tea but I do not know the teakettle so I must do the microwave but I do the rest of the process right😊
U tested EVERYTHING. BUT! What milk is best? Oat, almond, cow?
wait until hey discover putting tea in a coffee pot to ish automate production
No sugar?:'(
All Tea's meh when Chai walks into the room
3:38 MulTEAverse
They are all have a monochrome clothing hmm
Uhh, ive never seen anyone poor milk in before the tea (although maybe im not the best person to ask since i don't really like tea)
milk in tea gross .....
I'm not British but by God I make tea every single day since I was 12 and microwaving the water in the cup makes me MAD 😂 ofcourse the handle's hot, dum dum!
So funny how passionate we all are about how to make tea
Nepal has the best tea
I would use the flat round tea bag, put it in the cup and then the right amount of sugar is just enough to fully cover the teabag so you can't see it.
me. a russian watching this: 🥲 why the milk or sugar at all 😪
mas
Why so many Puns? I just playd through all bosses and almost all items there are also so many Puns. Time to be Pun-ishing
The different cup experiment had a problem. You actually heated the glass cup 3 times, while heating the other 2 only once (bc you poured hot water through the glass cup first).
Fyi Newton drank coffee
I wonder how people react to first heating the water in a kettle, then dropping a tea bag in the cup. And pouring the water in the cup immediately and without milk.
That one from TikTok was an atroci-tea.
but what about sweeteners, like sugar or honey? Sometimes I'll even use a bit of Maple Suyrp.
If there’s no other brits out there then tea tastes like coffee water
My biggest wonder is why MatPat thinks everyone in Britain is a MIFer (That's a term for someone who pours Milk in First then the tea). I've only ever met TIFers (as you can guess that means Tea in First). Good video all around though. Maybe expand it with more tea types. I want to know how to make the FINEST Darjeeling tea.
funny how you call the teapot British when the technique was stolen from the Chinese
I don’t want any milk in my tea.  I enjoy the taste of the tea.  One tsp of sugar.
I prefer to call it hot salad water,   Yes that is a teen titans reference.
It make me happy that the "original" way May Familie in North germany make exakt that Art of Tee an we drink almost the whole day Tee 1.5 -2 Liter
Anyone saw the cup it olmost spled msa
A few years back /wuh maybe a decade already???/ colleagues at work "discovered tea" and tried every exotic mix available to buy online and were very snobbish and annoying about it, in a kind of "I am a vegetarian" kind of way.... as a mostly coffee drinker they pissed me off by their behaviour, so whenever they huddled in the kitchen I went there and made myself instant fruit tea from a powder mix just to spite them :-D..... anyhow.... herbal teas and fruity forest mixes are fine, but I never got the taste for "real english tea", they simply taste like sock water..... throw the stones, dont mind......HOWGH
This is a video about tea and no one is talking about Turkish tea culture. Turkey consumes the mos amount of tea per capita. It is 3 times more than the second which is China.
Are her kidneys ok?
My Father was an upholsterer and had a mug in his workshop that he made his tea in and just rinsed out at the end of the day. After a few months there was a thick brown scale on the inside of the cup he claimed gave the tea "body". On odd occasions my Mum would visit and forget herself and actually wash the mug and scrub off the layer of "patina"  which would horrify my Dad. He claimed it took at least a month to get it back to proper flavour.
bri'ish
there are two other variables you could have also tested. One the height when poured there is a myth? about how aerating your tea improves its flavor and cools the temperature so its sooner drinkable. (Now I don't personally do it because I don't want to get burned, but it exists seeing as I've read about it.)  Second the type of water/region its from. Fun fact: dependent on your location, mineral content, concentration laws for stuff like chlorine and the types/age of the pipes your city uses the water can and will taste different. I lived in two different cities tried rain water as well as stuff from a stream and they all taste slightly different which in turn will have an effect when making tea. even different types of bottled water can taste different, either way if you ever make a part 2 things to might include!
There was so many tea puns that you could throw a comi-tea club just saying the tea puns from this video and it would look the movie rea-tea player one look like a YouTube short, and also the puns were pre-tea bad if I'm being honest
I personally steep tea for about 20 minutes
Rooibos👑
Tea? Do you mean fish food?
Chai tea with no milk u touch it give me the mug and u don't get hurt 3rd dege burn is running into u arms
Matthew is out britishing the british.
im brittish and ive never seen anyone put milk in first
bruh how did that tiktok even brew?? only 1 min of heating & the cold milk was added before the teabag! I always microwave my water for 3 min. & only add the milk after it is brewed. I usually only add milk for chai tho & not like english breakfast tea. as you can tell im not british
Can you make this but the far superior American iced tea 8:50 🇺🇸
now try Indian tea 😅
well if u only need 1 cup of tea, microwafe is fine, alsooo why isnt the spiffing brit in this video as THE classic englishman?
I only put milk in specific types of tea but even then its rare Prefer not having milk in general, feels weird for me
Some teas don't need water like raspberry and Turkish
Rip steph trying to fit in with British
noooo our tea! The only British legacy we have! (Don’t come after eggs and bacon)
How preposterous to think the best tea is made with teabags. Or that adding milk and sugar is better than high-quality looseleaf brewed tea with no additives. Try “real tea” and any delusions of British “tea superiority” will be dispelled in an instant. Actually drink it however you like, but get off your high horses
It’s milk 🥛  I. Are my dad tea No not tea bags Mike tea beans spices and ginger on a stove
I love tea so much so this makes me happy. However, coming from the south it was usually diabetic coma inducing tea, I love variety with not too much sweetness now. But I've never had milk with tea personally.
Why would you put limk in tea?????
Everyone's freaking out at the tiktok in the beginning bc the girl used too much milk or whatever, meanwhile I'm just fascinated by the fact that her microwave door opens _DOWNWARD_ instead of to the side--
Tea is leaf stock?
If you want to put milk in your tea, you're using the wrong caffeine broth.
Me:Hehehe… I don’t even ADD milk to my tea!
I never knew you were supposed to add milk to tea ☠️
My favorite to have tea is thrown in the boston harbor
may be the glass is hot because you used it to pore other cups. ultimately reduce heat in other cups.😅
2 spoons of tea, 5- 10 mins in boiling water, than let it cool for 1 minute and add 3 spoons of sugar, at last if you wanna 25ml of "Major - lemon" juce. more the mug dirted with tea the better in tastes.
Uncle Iroh liked this video
Optimum cup of tea~ *ACCORDING TO WHOM?* The only part of this episode I concur with is bag shape~ as everything after that is personal preference.
It’s annoying me that Tom hasn’t corrected them about even British people think putting the milk in first is heresy!!! The key being in ‘centuries ago’.
Good to know. I've normally done the flat bags in covered mugs for four minutes with no milk
I have to agree no milk
I add honey, not milk
You put milk in tea?
Milk in your tea is weird.
Unfortunately most pyramid bags are plastic, and leach a huge amount of microplastics into the tea.
TRY MAKING SA TEA
This is exactly like how I drink my tea. But a warning never put milk in herbal tea,  it's awful. I used to have 2 spoon of sugar in my tea but stopped a few years ago and replaced it with cake!!!
as a british person i approve
SENKU THAT YOU ¿!
Lipton family size bags, microwave water (not bags) steep for 30 minutes, no milk. Don't judge me for what I like!
Don't even dare introduce that woman that made that abhorration of a tea to Yerba Mate. They won't make Heresy, they will just straight-up do the most blasphemous act and entity in the entirety of human history.
I think that's the best tea is the one with tea spoon and no milk
I have no idea why, but youtube chose that the ad for this video should bring attention to the fact mcdonalds has increased their prices by 70%+ here 😂 i guess i have watched too many food theory videos about mcD 😂
Microwave is for sad, "I've already put the tea bag in the mug and expected the water in the thermos to still be hot but it's actually cold", leaf juice.
Me who likes bitter tea when they are talking bout seep time :👁️👄👁️
Twinnings Earl Grey comes in flat bags, unfortunately.
Im asian so I never knew it was a thing to pour milk in there I always thought that was just me as a kid being experimental
Ok ok but something they didn't address Bag first or water first
and heated paper is a no-go.
Me watching the taste test and wonder how COVID spread so easily 😂
Coassic indian tea is just better , period.
people put milk in their tea??
Strangely enough, as a British person I've always put the milk on last. I didn't really know that putting it on the bottom was even an option honestly.
I enjoy being able to watch these videos to earn points on fan rewards. I have made a little over $100 on just watching these videos.
Obviously late here. But thought this was going to be about tea quality. A friend of mine came here for a provenience in China and now has a tea shop. She told me the different qualities of tea that can be on one plant and how the “trash” goes into tea bags and sold overseas. The tips are harvested whole. The better larger more mature leaves are either lightly dried or fermented. There are some companies that have high quality tea bags but you can tell it’s high quality because of the price and you can see the difference in the leaves from the cheap stuff I’m the stores. It’s made me a terrible tea snob.
Love a British tea...from Assam
15:31 unless you mix it, I guess.
Different Opinion: I actually drink green / lemon / fruity teas and this is how I make it.  I get hot water, dunk in the tea bag, and I out in honey or most often agave. Perfection. 👌 (Try honey or honey adjacent. I'm looking at the lactose intolerant people.)
Being a Brit, I have never ever heard of anyone putting milk in first for tea
I am tea my PROFILE PICTURE LITTERALY HAS A BRITISH HAT LIKE WHAT DO I NOT HAVE ABOUT TEA
Nope, cream on bottom, 100%
the British are disappointed matpat
No no no, look how the east does it. Multiple steeps to get rig of tannins and open the leaves up then the teas gets stronger then weaker after each brew.... the british copied them and made it worse
my father says using glasses makes the tea better check that out in malta the tradition is in glass try it next time
You did Britain proud
7:09 ah, osmosis.                            *W E M E E T A G A I N*
I’m going back and watching food theories that I’ve missed (there isn’t many of them) and um… All I could think of the entire time… “CHAI TEA!? BRO CHAI MEANS TEA! YOURE SAYING TEA TEA! WOULD I ASK YOU FOR A COFFEE COFFEE WITH ROOM FOR CREAM CREAM!?”
New food theory idea do this same idea for coffe
i feel like for a memey episode of food theory you should end it off with "bone apple teeth"
When you’re lactose intolerant and drink tepid leaf water
13:38 correct opinion
MATPAT YOU DIDNT TEST OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STOVE AND GRILLING YOUR TEA!!!
Bruv are you shaming your leafy soup
As a Chinese person, I agree with MatPat, the perfect amount of milk in tea is no milk.
You didn't look into whether or not tap or bottled water is better.
This rolled up in recommendation while I was enjoying in masala chai.
i drink tea but never tryed a brithis tea cous IM hungary and i drink coffe copocheno to be prisesed
me realising that I am doing it "correctly"
Sun tea... Throw it in an old glass gallon pickle jar with no more pickle smell or taste in it and let it sit in the sun until the color is right.
Steph did a reverse Ryan George (Pitch Meeting videos). She said, "Wow... wow, wow, wow"  The quote is "Oh wow, wow, wow...  wow."
I'm not always a hot bean drink lover,  sometimes I prefer hot leaf drinks. On a hot day,  I love myself some cold leaf water with some sour fruit guts and sugar made by a dead golf guy.
It tastes like hot leaf water!
11:14 bruh
Bruh 5:37
I am now craving tea
Tea is supposed to go in the ocean.
COFFE? HOT CCOCO?! WHERE ARE THE APPLE SIDER PEOPLE!
We Scots are blemmin disgusted by that tool making tea in a feckin microwave
Please bring back the original red matpat jacket!!
Ok but watching matpat jump up and down excited during these kinds of experiments reminds me of myself doing little experiments I saw in books as a kid. Just so excited to be participating in science of any kind because you find it fun.  Just goes to show some things you never grow out of huh?
I never put milk in my tea
Yeah
Matpat did you know that Britain is not the top consumer, its actually Turkey in 1st place and Britain is in 3rd place (Ireland 2nd place)
Hey MatPat, if you would like to do some more tea videos, there is this type o tea the color changes from i think blue to purple or pink when you add something to it, and it comes from a dried flower. id lovv it if you were to take my idea into consideration! <3
Honestly I didn't know people put milk in tea till now......... Best way to say you're a American XD I'll have to try this out later
Love the fridge art dude!!!
Just realising that you're brewing tea the aussie way :P
I can assure you, steph is not the biggest tea drinker, I know someone who drinks like 5 to 8  pots of tea a day, any season.
2:02 as someone who’s british, we are trained in the fine art of tea making from birth
Cream in tea is a freaking crime against humanity and tea itself.
Yeah chai is so much better
Edit the 10:30 was not ment to be a time stamp.  I hate your food theory now I'm craving Thai tea and it's 10:30 so I probably shouldn't have any also if you haven't Tried Thai its really good its a orange colored ice tea
Question, why not the Chinese tea? They are the creators of tea? -.-
why kermit in the thumb nail though
Film on a tea means that you are using too hard water for your tea. Tea generally likes very soft water, like one you would find in a mountain spring in China
The fact that you called tea "hot leaf water" and missed using Iroh's absolutely perfect "hot leaf juice" clip hurts me spiritually!
Christmas mugs?
Still can’t beat the reliable southern sweet tea.
Rich people tell you that the way you create tea sucks cause you're poor. This video summed up.   Folks stop yapping about microwave tea being "toxic". I guarentee that you got a ton of other health problems by old age anyways by just existing that make it not really matter as much as you think it does.
DO THE SAME VIDEO WITH COFFEE
as an asian person the way americans and british people make tea just pains me, i use loose leaf and heat water right to where the temperature won’t scald them, add leaves into my cup until my ancestors tell me to stop, pour in my water and sip, and since i use leaves i can refill it with water multiples times a day without needing to add more leaves and the flavor doesn’t get too watery, NO MILK NO SUGAR 🤢🤢
Wait, they had 3 cups with a letter in front of it: M for Matthew S for Stephany A for... Who?
I need him to react to all the different types of tea packing
What about sweet tea
honestly tom is adorable
What is the perfect amount of cheese to put in your spaghetti tho?
6:28 Mat:so we have 3 identical mugs Mugs : M A S
I feel attacked I put my tea in the microwave >:0  I will not stop and you can’t make me 😭
Okay I'm from Texas and you're going to hate the way we do it we get a picture and we will put about four to five cups of sugar probably a bit more and then pour the tea that we pre boiled boiled water on the stove with the tea bags already in it you would use around 2 to 4 tea bags stir in rather poor some out and add more tea or add more sugar
Btw, since the British tea originated from India, doesn't it means, their tea originated in India? I mean u could just look up Indian videos on how to make a perfect tea 😅
I made the perfect cup of tea but at the end I added two table spoons of sugar and oh boy did it taste good
Teak tok?
Best thea is moroccan thee with actual moroccan mint
In chile we dring tea on breakfast and in diner
I. Love tea
we boil tea first let it sit a bit with tea bags in it then put some sugar in afterwards (sometimes i put milk in mine)
rednecks also drink tea over in the south nice cold sweet tea always good
Tea is delicious; expessially chamomile tea 🍵
3:07 *that’s insulting to even an American*
“How much milk do you put in tea?”   Me: none because I’m lactose intolerant
I think the Tiktok tea was made specifically to disgust Briton's...
Stephs body language… most of the Brit’s sips. She gives  extended glances towards the Brit with a constant upward facing chin and eyes compared to the downward ones as she corals with Matt. I’m not a professional in body language but it was painfully clear that she has the hots for a British accent..   with I’ll do respect, shouldn’t it be clear who’s married to who. But with this in mind, and how it correlates with female body language. If I didn’t know Stephanie was Matt’s wife with this notion of mine I’d believe Matt was the guest.. 😢.
1:42   missed opportunity of saying pracTEEcally
Avocados usually take six to eight weeks to sprout so don't worry your avocado isn't the opposite of alive
BRITANIA RULES THE TEA
This is soooo......fuckin' stupid.I usually love your content MatPat,but I don't want to waste another second of my life watching this crap.
Steph and Tom reenacting the Boston tea party sent me for some reason. 😂

I love the thoroughness and detail in their experiments, but one thing that kept popping up in my mind as I watched this video was they didn’t specify what type of milk their using. Neither did they try different milks, but I still love all their videos and different channels!
My way of making tea is really basic, just heating water until it starts steaming, then drop in a tea bag or two and leaving it for approximately ten or 20 minutes.
And I thought I was a tea snob…
I make my tea in the microwave. And I don't add milk - I add lemon and sugar. Boiled water aside, I'm not sure how to approach milk in tea.
I drink like 10 cups of tea per day usualy. I need help, arent i?
Mat : Best milk is no milk  Indians : 👁👄👁
Clap and a half to Steph, Keeper of the Brain Cell! Also editor, you made this SO funny!
I think I be drinking the wrong tea😅
everyone using bags and stuff. meanwhile indians just pouring the tea leaves directly into boiling water and filtering it later with a filter.
Milk first was phased out forever ago. It's why cartons of soya milk specify that we put it in first so it doesn't curdle. Milk first is a crime 😂
Alright. This is fantastic. One thing though that I am curious about : your experiment with the tea mugs should also extend to different styles of tea pots - ceramic, metal, porous, glazed, stoneware, porcelain etc, but also the shape of the pot, and whether a taller or more squat teapot is best.
I Don’t Drink Tea
I know I am late but can u try the perfect cup of tea george orwell
Stop the puns 🙀
you should've gotten someone turkish
Super guilty of squeezing the tea bag after steeping. Didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to do that, now I know why I need more sugar. Lol
good indian pronsoution
As a British citizen I think this gave me more trauma 😢
I like extremely bitter tea with no milk. That way if I have something sweet with the tea they compliment each other.
You don’t need to make tea with a teabag
No it hurts my brutish brain
Wait... people put milk in their tea?
Nothing makes me happier than a nice hot cup of of good ol chai. Why on Earth would you add milk to tea though 🤔
IM BRITISH IT GOES ON TOP
But what's the optimal amount of water?
Get some pg tips up in hear 😂
Get dunked on. The undertale reference
Sugar?
Indians watching this: Look what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power. Water is overrated!
Milk in tea only works with Indian tea methods
You know steph is a mom when she instinctively put her hand under the loose leaf tea
No Milk Gang  👇
you have to taste different flavors of tea in different cups types over time
But I from Hong Kong-
Learn to love Jesus!
I don't know anyone here in Britain that pours their milk first, it might have been done traditionally many, many years ago but it's definitely looked down upon now
We Indians literally have different amounts of milk amounts based on milk types. Like, we use normal tea leaves, not bags and then strain it but my family uses buffalo milk, which is thicker and we still use one part milk and one part tea, but, we boil both of them, we boil the water, add sugar, tea leaves, tea masala, let it boil for five mins and then add milk on top and let it boil again till it reaches the top of the vessel and then we strain it and our tea is ready.
Brit gang 🇬🇧☕️ 👇
I love tea and I drink between 1 and 6 cups of tea a day and I agree with not putting milk in tea.
as a turkish person both versions are scandalous to me
I get the s for Steph and M for Matpat on the mugs. But, who is the A cup for??
Those 6 jokes were Bad
Why would you use a new mug for every cup of tea? The old tea builds flavour!
The microwave is a great option for those who do not have dedicated water boiling devices, or would use a kettle/pot on a gas stove, because it is more efficient to heat just the water. And electricity is ~0.6-2x as efficient as gas, depending on supply mix.
Most people brew it like that now anyway. The amount of tea in a bag has to be higher to account for different cup sizes. The milk added before lowers the brewing temperature, so you will taste less bitter notes, but it may curdle the milk, especially straight from the kettle (just boiled).
If you add the milk first, and more milk, it will cool it, brew it less, and taste less of tea also. Partial loose leaf tea is better quality than most bag tea. The companies making different shaped bags probably buy higher quality tea. Also you normally don't open tea bags, especially because of the fine particle size, which is hard to filter out. Also you put the bag first because it "brews it better" (you get more agitation when pouring water.
Imagine not heating the milk before putting it in and calling it perfect
toms accent is amazing tho
Instead of milk why not try honey
Allright. I am from South Carolina. We drink sweet tea here, and that is part of our religion. My doctor beilieves it runs in my veins, which I also beilieve. Sweet tea is objectivley the best type of tea. Matpat, do a video on sweet tea, then I'll subscribe.
From that episode, I learned that I have always known how to make tea since I was a little kid, because that's exactly how my grandmother taught me to make tea, except that I add a slightly heaped teaspoon of sugar to mine.
The glass mug was preheated by feeling the other mugs. Meaning the last tast was completely invalid.
LoL. In my household we are big tea drinkers. None of us are British, all American and we basically drink tea in the way the group deemed the perfect cup BUT we don't use milk in our tea.
Scottish blend or bust
The way I learnt to make tea (here in India ) was measure a little more than half a cup of water and around half a cup of milk, two spoons of sugars and on spoon of tea
'Sees that TikTok video' Me: OH, THE HUMANITY! IT'S ICONOCLASM AGAINST ACTUAL TEA!!  Also, I've always put milk on top.
What about different kinds of milk.  I'm with Mat, why use milk?  On the other hand I like Lactose free milk.   I can not stand the other types of milk.  Would they improve teas? Also curious about goat and camel milk.
circle tea bags are top notch
great....now I want tea.
Matpats tea caused my grandma to start a phone petition for her local paper to cover it
I'm a kid😊😊 1:48 1:48 1:49 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
My mom insists on having a different cup for her coffees so I feel you on the whole constantly washing cups in the dishwasher
2:57 what happened to "I'll put the *kettle* on"  Also, most brits don't actually keep to the traditional "milk goes at the bottom" recipe.
Disappointed that there was an emphatic "don't microwave your water" without doing a test vs a kettle with a normal cup of tea instead of TikTok Tea.
What about milk type? I know a lot of people that use evaporated milk instead of regular milk 🥛
I really think you should have a guest where tea actually has an art to it: China and Japan. Thats a good benchmark for study.  Also...the tea in the bags vs the loose leaf vs. the big bag, have different kinds of leaves even if theybhave the same brand. The bag is what i call tea DUST. which is yuck.
You missed one thing - temperature of the water. What about hotter, Cooler water?
Try indian style of tea making ....
6:30 ¨Boston Tea Party Summarized¨
I love how Matpat mentions it as leaf water and remnant pool water.😂☕🏊
I'm British but I don't drink tea
To go even deeper. for many tea's it's horribly wrong to boil the water. Too high a temperature can "burn" the leaves ruining the flavor. Some require the water to be heated to a specific temperature, others require water to be boiled and then cooled down to a specific temperature. The science ot tea is much more complicated than boil water, throw in baggie, ruin with milk.
As a German putting milk in Tee sounds like blasphemy
4-5?!  those are rookie numbers
only the crazies put the milk in first
Okay I'm following... Sounds good... Yes, this will make good tea... Okay but I'm still microwaving my water until you do a theory that tests the difference between microwaving and using the stove 😤
something to consider is the type of water your loosing. some people have well water, city, etc. n then the mineral content of the water can change the difference of taste for people. like my roommate came from a city with a water hardness of 4 mg/L, while the city we were in was 600 mg/L. n then my home town was 300 mg/L for hardiness. and we can say the most hardiness water made us felt sick
you didn't scientifically check the microwave. since you didn't eliminate the other variables.
hold on, 3-4 cups a day counts as a lot?! i drink over 3 times that in coffee
No more like two less real but I’m not a professional, so you be you I don’t roll your life I feel like I don’t need to say this.
I like my tea to be super bitter, though, so I like to squeeze the bag and steep it for longer :P
This brings back perhaps my most british memory to date: getting soaked in the rain while on cadet camp, and then the colour sergeant came over with a massive jerry can full of tea. And we all sat in a shelter, watching it chuck it down as we sipped hot tea. We British do rather like our tea.
Hold on no one in the UK makes their tea with the milk on the bottom, we all make it with the milk on the top. So the British way is the right way
As a brit this is very interesting. Tho i will say, even a lot of British people put milk on top. Maybe the traditional way is on the bottom, but milk on top or bottom I would say is a debate here too 😂
Noticing none of these taste tests are blind...
No Briton puts milk in 1st!!! Also u didn’t test bone China Vs Mug
I have one thousand seven TEA two pencils
I get that the M mug is Matt's and the S mug is Stephanie's but who does the A mug belong to?
Are we ignoring the fact that 99% of people in the uk put the milk in last unless its in a teapot hes saying it like its a new revelation but weve been doing it for decades
Lol only 4 cups!?? That's breakfast in the UK.
Matt's British ancestors and maybe even the men who participated in The Boston Tea Party are rolling in their graves
Suggestion for when you guys are taste testing, instead of live reactioning to each other which can cause testing bias, you all should grade your results secretly and come back at the end together with the results.
i know this is old but the tik tok way is also the way that indians make chai. its not wrong and its delicious
I got the quote of “ she merely adopted it, we need someone born in it, molded by it” of The Dark Knight Rises ( I’ve never played it, just seen the memes )
Also, the cup color makes a difference…The suggested is a red cup..It tricks the brain to think you are drinking something sweet..
Another great variable would be the water..What is the best choice: distilled, spring, tap, and other options..?
Steph is hot af
3 4 cup of tea per day ? My sweet summer child xD
Milk in tea? Nope
We don’t put the milk in 1st though nobody I know does unless they’re weird
the look of disappointment on Mat's face after Tom spilled the tea leaves
2:37 Canadian here. Ew wtf is happening in that video.
Why would you add milk cream or sugar to your tea?  If you don't like the flavor of your tea why drink that flavor?  Just get a tea you like to drink without the milk sugar or cream or anything else.
Arizona is the best
Maybe next best cup of coffee?
can you can make a theory video  on Indian tea
The clip at 2:55 hurt my soul as a tea lover (btw I am British but I mostly drink loose leaf tea from different countries)
I just realized... people criticizing milky tea..but yet boba tea has milk and is popular 😭
everyone drink your hot salad water.
i like cold tea
I hate tea 🤮
Lemon tea
I can confirm being someone who is from the United Kingdom 99.99% of our lessons are finding how to make the ultimate tea
BOSTON TEA PARTY SUMMARIZED
You forgot the water temperature. And for the vegans you should have done a comparison of milk alternatives. I demand a part 2
Agreed correct milk is no milk
Science matpats speicailtea
MILK????? Why would you add that to tea?? ewww
where is the indian tea mate
4:03 also called as the state of assam.
steph only drinks 3 to 4 cups a day?.......
What percentage of milk did you use though
Just a stupid question of mine but why didn't you just weigh the water when filling up the different cups? That's as consistent as you can get right?  I would do that for sure because I am crazy ^^
A food teaory
my Palestinian tea needs no milk thank you 🫡🇵🇸
Congrats! You've made Australian-style tea. This is how it's done over here.
Wait y'all put milk in tea
I still do not understand DO NOT USE MICROWAVE.
Why would anyone microwave tea wtf
As an Aussie I’m greatly hurt by that microwaved Tea
BTW... amazing puns :D
Don't add milk. Nooooooooooo
Milk on the bottom probably "cook" the milk more.
I boil water So hot that it's still boiling when I'm pouring it, put tea bag in, Steep for 13 minutes, Pull tea bag out, squeeze tea bag, Put 4 and a 1/2 teaspoons of sugar then add milk And/or Creamer, only French Vanilla. Stir and enjoy.
I might be crazy but I like the bitter flavor better.
Tee without sugar 🤔✌️
Just wait till they hear about Eastern Europe and adding jam to their, milk-less, tea
Wait!!! There are people out there that put milk in first!!!! Im british and we all put milk in second
I'm British, no one puts milk in first
but- what about putting the milk in before you take out the tea bag?
Regardless of the results. As a Briton I will not listen to what this colonial has to say.
Not even two minutes in and the tea jokes are rolling, love it ❤
Tea is high in oxolates. You need to learn about the negative effects if that plant toxin
Mat making disgusting tea Meanwhile Indian highschoolers drinking boiled tea leaves without sugar for the maximum caffiene overdrive
Cuphead youtooz
6:28 The look in MatPat's eyes when he looks over-
matpat is just slowly but surely collecting every multiverse version of him
NO milk NO sugar and omg NO teabags! Only whole leaf tea!
I'm nepali 😂 all of this is considered horrible tea the minimum water to milk ratio is 1:2 half milk half water. And both boiled and tea boiled with it. Having cold milk in that low quantity is almost like washing the teapot and serving it lol 😂
Bro I kid you not, I always thought that almost no one put milk in their tea! I NEVER EVER put milk in my tea. it completly ruins the flavour! ☕👍🚫🥛
as a brit, i never knew people put milk first, very strange
As a guy from the country that currently drinks the most tea in the world (Turkey);   1- Tea shouldn't be in a bag. We have two piece pots to heat the water on stove tops. Try them, you'll love it.  2- Milk is for coffee. Keep it away from the freaking tea!
brit here, went into this video thinking i was gonna be offended but im happy to know that the theorists have the same opinion to me lmao
i love teahs video
Turkey drinks more tea than the UK 💀
Now make iced tea for Tom 😂
Being a Indian 🇮🇳 How can someone mess up to prepare a cup of tea its makes me mad I am not consume tea or coffe but I make for my mom and brother so I am pro to make a Elegant💗 smell original assam tea ☕
British tea drinking is joke.  Singed: the rest of tea drinking countries.
This is the true reason for horrible Russo-american relations. The way you mistreat tea.
I thick that if you where you live has hard water it can cause a layer of film on the top.
I love sweet tea but I’ve never tried hot tea before idk ima try it soon.
I—um—feel so called out for heating my hot water in a microwave— I don’t use a kettle—I don’t even think I have one—
Indian moms : You underestimate my power…
You didn’t test the water can have so many different versions to it depending on its origin because different level of atrazine, glyphosate, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, arsenic, and I think more Anyway I would love to see you make a video about how the different kinds of water can affect the different kind of flavored of tea, hot chocolate, and etc.
Oh also as a tea drinker, to all those coffee drinkers who make their coffee with scooping the coffee first then sticking your coffee covered spoon into the sugar... YOU MONSTER!! we cannot use the sugar as it has a faint crap coffee taste that ruins the tea. Its not as criminal as the Microwave (that was upsetting beyond words) but its still bad. Stop being inconsiderate and doing that!!!!
All of you have left out the most important factor, the water. My brother worked in a Victorian British tea room, and they did it the traditional way from generations ago and its F**king amazing to drink. It starts with the water, You cannot use pre boiled water (or a kettle topped up, tip it out fully fresh pot), this is extremely important. Fresh oxygenated water, boiled and poured into a pre heated teapot (you don't want the water to cool at all) with tea leaves NO TEA BAGS. Keep the pot warm to keep the heat constant (longer the stronger this is personal preference.) Pour in cup, then if you have sugar add that while hot to properly mix in then at milk to taste if you want it. This was how tea was done back then, once you have tea like this you can taste the difference but people make the biggest mistake at the beginning by not using fresh water. It will make you a tea snob lol
HELLO INTERNET,welcome to food theory.
I love all the tea puns, and I anticipated Tom's British reaction of "There we are,", though I was a little miffed that my preferred steep time of 5 mins was overthrown.  I will be doing my own experience about tea add-ins.  Right now, I'm thinking lemon and lime juice together, honey, and milk.  I'm not sure I have enough tea for much more, but I would love your suggestions.
TikTok tea sounds so gross
Always had milk last in my tea
I didn't know you would put milk in your tea. I always drink it without milk, but I will try it now
Just stir with a spoon.
Should you put the teabag before the water or not? Should you put the milk after the teabag or before?
Tea is traditionally made without milk, if you add milk, it will become a hong kong style milk tea that is sweeter and milkier than traditional chinese tea
Well in Britain there's a controversy on which goes first anyway
as a British percn it is one percen tea Bag more then one tea pot
onley two way to make tea teapot or ketle and mug no other way
Bro that Brit is agreeing with matpats wife so hard
Just imagine how different this vid would be if he had Asians in it. Their tea game is on a whole other level compared to the Britbongs
I think I would have like to see one extra step with the testing, and would be to also include the stronger brewed loose leaf tea to the mix and have it undergo the same test along side the chosen winners, and then see if it could come out on top as the better tea based off of balancing of the blend. Like milk sometimes can "water out" the flavor. So if you were to have a stronger based brew, and then adding the proper amount of milk or maybe even more milk, would it taste better, the same or still not be ideal, based off of the flavor being stronger from the start,  coz just coz it comes off a bit strong at first, I don't think it takes it out of the race. You can't make too weak of a brew better, but can you make an overpowering strong brew better than it's winning counterpart. Also temperatures of the water should also have been included. Coz I've noticed it makes a difference just through trial and error over time
You do realize that the glass cup would have been warmer because you used it as your measuring device right? It would have absorbed some of that heat before the water was transferred to the other mugs.
Tik Tok: *Uses too much milk* Mattpat: *Uses the right amount of milk* Me: You Guys use milk?
Next time invite a turkish person to drink tea with you :) You want to leave the tea for 20 minutes or so in the water not a few minutes
i'd say I have 7-8 cups of tea a day, I either just have them throughout the day or I drink them in a compact time frame. Also depends how i'm feeling but most of the time 7-8 cups
作为一个中国人。。。我想我来错地方了。
The things I watch at 1 in the morning...
😂”Why do you put milk in this ?!” Exactly! Now it’s called Milk Tea, not tea!
Tea either tastes like grass or dirt, unless it's mint. I never understood why people drank it.
Southern style sweet tea is obviously superior.    2 cups of sugar per gallon
And i will taste both Ayo 👀👀
You just did a face reveal😂
1:22 watching from England, no pressure Mat Pat!
You focused on how the British drink and prepare tea, but completely ignore how Asia drinks and prepares tea.  I feel that you're missing thousands of years of tea-making by focusing solely on Britain.  Also missing how different teas should be prepared.
What exactly is the issue with the microwave? I know it's less efficient than an electric kettle, but I don't have an electric kettle. And, you didn't test different water temperatures. 80°C, 90°C, 98°C? What about cold brew tea?
Personally it isn't my personally cup of tea I prefer coffee 😅
bruh u just called british tea original when it originated from india
I'm British and thought that it was normal as British culture to put milk in last
Hot water on milk burns the milk, pouring milk into water gives the water time to cool down as it mixes, and prevents that sour aftertaste which should be something in the milk breaking down. Or so I heard anyway.
As someone from england, most people dont pour milk in first. It is usually looked down upon, yet can be found among a few people (mostly people who dont drink lots of tea on ny expirience)
So drinking 4+ cups of tea per day isn't normal?!?
I'm a controversial tea drinker in that I don't remove the bag while drinking. I LIKE a bitter tea. If I'm being optimal, then 3~ minutes is right, but I always squeeze the bag (again, I like bitterness) with only a HINT of milk to add a some sweetness for balance (and I'd say 5mil could be more than I use) I'd rather have an oversteeped tea with dregs so bitter even I can't drink then than have a weak or milky tea.
I LOVE TEA SO MUCH! YES STEPHH 🙌
How to make tea taste like froot loops:  Earl Grey Tea + French vanilla creamer + orange blossom honey
You have just started a civil war over here in England. Thanks guys…
Best milk is no milk! Turkish tea is best tea 🇹🇷🇹🇷 no 1 tea drinkers in the world.
i have literally never waited a few minutes for a cup of tea to soak the leaves. just jiggle the teabag a little and you're done
You have to be very particular to taste the difference in the cup. I prefer drinking from tin because it’s the subtlest metallic taste. I’m not a fan of drinking from anything earthy like clay, or ceramic. Drinking from a wood cup is nice but the type of wood is really important here, and wood absorbs previous flavors, so I’d have a dedicated wood cup for each type of tea you make, and a dedicated coffee wood cup.
Imo I make tea byyy: Adding tea bag into mug Add boiling water into mug Let the the water become tea-y Take out tea bag (or keep it in idm) Add suger (BEFORE MILK, milk cools it down and suger will melt easier in warmer water) Mix Add milk Mix  DONE
Keep that cup of milk away from my japanese green tea! I have an asian katana, gO aWaY! (i actually got jumpscared bc asian tea is just yknow tea- if you add milk i call it a latte ;=;)
Turkey consumes most tea ever in the world
Can we please get a food theory on Arizona tea prices
Last thing. Some of the best ways to sweeten a bitter tea is with raw honey or with a fresh mint leaf or two.  You can avoid the milk and that nasty refined sugar.
You can get the diffusing effect by just being active in the steeping process by kinda bobbing the bag up and down in the hot water. This is particularly effective at the beginning.
As a Deep Southerner, that tea video reminds me of all those videos of Yankees making "gumbo" or doing a crab/crayfish boil. It causes us physical pain to watch. Lol.
Not a coffee fan. But I loooove teas, especially darker teas.  Early Grey and English Breakfast are the best!
I've disappointed my contry I always put milk in second
A splash is generally normally where I live in Briton in the middle near London other than when your me wanting it to cool faster
Gross, milk in tea! Hungarians prefer lemon juice!
i drink 2 litters of tea per day lol
Matpat the goated god of no milk in tea. My Persian family popped off when you said this. You have the respect of Persian families.
I just dump a tetley bag (no string), put in sugar, pour boiling kettle water, stir, put whole milk in, stir, remove bag, stir and done. I dont use strings or teapots.
Did you know if you spell America backwards and spells coffee
It shouldn't bother me but it did...  Investeagation doesn't need 2 T's.
I agree with mat. No milk.
the milk first original british method was done when there were no tea bags or mesh nets to brew in the cup. therefore, all tea was brewed in a teapot. the principle is still the same - tea is steeped in water first and the milk is added last.   when you have a teabag or mesh net, you steep the tea in the mug so the milk must be poured in last. when you steep the tea in a teapot the last thing to be added is still the milk, whether you're pouring the steeped tea onto milk already in the cup or your pour in the tea and then add milk on top.  that sour taste comes from overheating the milk and the steeping of tea doesn't work well either because the temperature of the water is too low. that's why you steep tea without milk.  it's never been a british tradition to steep tea in milk. only weirdos without tastebuds do it 😂
I sometimes steep my tea overnight and drink it cold
I have never nor have I ever heard of anyone putting milk in tea
The mL of a cup will change the ratio
As a Chinese, any tea that comes in tea bag is cheap tea to me. And adding anything else to water is an insult to the tea😂
Yorkshire tea anyone???
Me who drinks southern style iced sweet tea with no milk.
Sacrilege
My only Question is, does the amount of water make a difference?
also the glass makes it look better
you forgot some things such as what milk you should use and if you should add sugar or sweetener
Two sugars and milk please ✌️😂
It's telling that the English lad looked at the tea and could see that it was over brewed... We drink a lot 😂😂
That woman hurt me and I will be seeing her I  court 😭
I drink like 2L of the stuff in a day and I ain't even a Brit
I do 100000 cups of tea every millisecond
The thing is my parents exclusively liked tea with milk
EXCUSE ME GOOD SIR, BUT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY TEA. HONESTLY MATE WHATS THE MATTER WITH YA
That seems like a bad hot toddy.
The dad jokes are killing me 💀
My polish dad drinks tea from a jar that we got from miód
can someone count how many tea puns were there in this video. crucial information!!
There's only one way to make tea(that would taste good), it's the indian way
Boston Tea Party summarized 🤣 6:36
I love the little peepatus in the background; nice touch,
The student’s T test, which is the gold standard statistical test for significant differences, is called the T test because a mathematician named Student got into an argument with a lady who said that milk first or tea first made a difference. He did a blind test and she could tell every single tea what came first. However, he needed to know that this wasn’t by chance, so he developed the Student’s “tea” test to determine the probability she got every answer right by pure chance.
That man is British enough to be a character from BBCs SHERLOCK
But you didn’t do sugar…
how big are the cups in ml?
british tea is nothing compared to chai
No offence but ask opinion to a British person about flavor is so wrong. British food are tasteless.
So for anyone wondering why the milk at the bottom tasted a bit sour and worse then when milk is put in from the top is most likely due to it shifting by the rapid increase in temperature but only for a part of the milk. As with dairy you want to keep everything the same temperature. So by putting it in from the top it gets mixed in evenly and wont shift. Dairy is a very tricky thing to work with.
Container? Hm... Why not Wine glass or Glass bottle? Drinking straight from teapot could work too.
nah this 3 area just weak
I’m British I drink 20cups of tea  a day
I understand why my British friend hates me. I don’t do this please don’t murder me.
13:36 As a Brit, I personally agree with MatPat, as I feel like having tea without milk brings out all of it's flavour!
Iroh Approves
I feel toms pain
Fun fact the most tea consuming country is not uk its Turkey
Matt's right about the milk
Milk?!?! In tea?!?!! What monsters!  I'm 37 years old and have NEVER seen that done by ANYONE. Apparently you guys need to retest with "southern sweet tea" which is literally this... Boil a gallon of water, drop 8-12 tea bags in the GLASS pitcher of hot water, add the sugar while it's still hot. Done. Drink warm or chilled and rethink your life decisions. 🤣
No self respecting Brit uses these posh tea bags, a real Brit would stay true to Yorkshire or PG Tips🤝☕️
My perfect order of tea making ( From a British 12 year old's pov) : 1. Tea bag goes into mug. 2.  2 1/2 tsp of sugar goes into mug. 3. Water goes into mug. 4. Milk goes into mug. 5. Drink it whenever your current mood wants you to.
The tea pot has its spout at the bottom and due to physics hot water rises from colder water that why at 9:56 they are surprised by the temp difference, the spout took water from the bottom while they drinked water from the top, I’m not trying to be rude I just thought it interesting that that was a detail that I never thought of (I love tea)
Disappointed you didn’t make one Iroh reference
5ml.....no lol. i'm british and 25ml is my go to. And ive always put milk in 2nd. Then again i'm not "upper class".
“Warm leaf water” uncle iroh would be mad
As an Asian putting milk in tea still baffles me. I still can’t get used to it
Me, drinking milk matcha... 🤑💚🥛Moooar milk!
Yall got nothing on me chugging 2-3 batches per day. (College be getting me fucked up)
It's not tik tok it's "tea tok"
I drink like 12 cups of tea.
What a spiffing video bye I’m British too (why am I acting like I’m in the 40s)
you steep the tea for however long it takes you to butter your toast
Steph mixed her tea tho
I can not taste the bitterness in tea all that much. Therefor I prefer my tea as strong as the tea bag will slow it to get and with no milk or sweeteners.
I think if you surveyed it most brits do milk at the top anyways haha 😂
tbh I really would like to be all three of those peoples friends
Difference in adding milk first is under-exctraction, very much like coffee, if the water is too cold then you end up with a bitter brew.
As a Brit, I like my green herbs.  Also, our tea is an insult to Asia, we put milk in it something's and that's odd
Dose Steph use a teapot ?
The fact you think there's no difference to order of adding solutions to a container is a clear indication you have no idea what constitutes scientific excilince. "Do as you oughtta, add the acid to the water." That's lab safety 101. That most 12 year olds could tell you. Tea is an acid. Milk is a base. There's probably something going on there. but you just ignore it.
Lemon and honey or you're just savage.
When life gives you lemons don't make lemonade. Get Mad!
Not in my 31 years of living in the north of England have I ever seen anyone put the milk in first. 😂
I’m watching this, knowing I hate hot tea… I like mine ice cold out the refrigerator 😭😂
I agree with MattPat when it comes to milk in tea, I prefer it milkless, and I'm british born and bred, my mother loves her tea with milk.
❤❤❤
People might not know that there are a special type of bengalis that are very positive in British tea
One of the tricks of British tea is using water straight from the supply. Most British don't have water filters but most Americans do have one built into the fridge water dispenser. The minerals I guess bind to the tea in some way and give it a more robust flavor. With filtered water it tastes weak and lacking something. The color is also much more orange with filtered water and brown with unfiltered so something is going on with the tannins.
I am from Assam and I usually drink tea with some tulsi leaves and ginger and a touch of sugar.
Who puts milk in their tea?
They forgot about the bloody sugar!
I think my favourite thing is the fact that the variable of most tea bags being made from leaf powder from the factory process and not actual leaves wasn't accounted for while testing all of these variables
Love dandelion tea!!!
Tea with milk still feels weird as Dutch person. Also having tasted multiple kinds of teas in countries of origin the tea we get in the west is very commercial!!! Same holds for coffee! I think the UK with their tea coming from India is an advantage.
I'm British and we've always put our milk in after.  You've found yourself a Brit of thr Lie over there. >:D
Can I just say that as someone who comes from a culture that has been drinking tea a full 1000 years longer than the British, I detest the idea of the British style of tea being considered “classic”
i just fell in love with your girl
My personal recipe is adding equal amounts of milk and water in a saucepan, let it simmer then add my favorite tea blend (a blend of small and big dried leaves), crushed ginger, pepper corns, a star anise and a pinch of coffee powder, let it boil for about 3 minutes, add a spoon of sugar, let it boil for a minute, then turn it off and leave it for a minute. Strain it and enjoy!  My absolute favorite recipe of milk tea ❤
As a guy from Bangladesh... I even cringed at their perfect tea for having so much water! let me tell you the perfect way:  Put a small amount of water in a pot...boil it.....then add 2-3 spoon of tea...keep the heat on for a few minutes......then add milk also some sugar according to taste... ratio of water to milk would be the opposite of what you used!  Voila...you got a perfect cup of milk tea which actually contains milk instead of having samples of it....
Oh my god the puns are waTEAry
My mom brews her tea for 20 minutes minimum
nort east India drink tea alot #love your channel Food Theory
Suger tho
They didn't even use a tea bag the right way in this video lol?! Like what was that? Your supposed to dip the tea bag in and out of the hot water many times to let the water mix and get threw all the tea. This is very well known with making tea with a tea bag. There's also a know meme about it in video games that has been around since the people had player characters called "tea bagging" lmao! I don't think I need to explain that lol. But was based off of making tea with a tea bag dipping it in and out of your tea.  Also a lot of Ice tea or sweet tea in America that many people love has that bitter flavor that they are trying to avoid in this video. It actually makes an amazing sweet tea to just leave the tea bags in because of this. The bitter flavor works well, Just like a lot of bitter coffee's are very good. It's a preference thing. Not a wrong or right way to make tea.  It's just insane to me that they understand that a more open glass will let out more heat more easily obviously which is fact, but they don't understand how to dip a tea bag in hot water to let the flavor out and let all the water get to the tea properly? Which is also fact. Who really cares lol, Just if you're going to get technical about something but leave out simple things, Like using a simple tea bag properly when your video is about tea, What is the point? I didn't realize people needed a lesson in tea making lmao!
is it weird that i do kinda prefer what type of plate i use, is that weird?🤨🧐
I wonder if non dairy milk will taste alright.
I'm British and I NEVER put milk in first, I've always left milk last so I don't know what you guys are on about with "British Tradition" of putting milk in first I'm British and I feel that putting milk in first is WEIRD
*I fill the kettle up and put a tea bag and sugar into the mug, then I wait until the button flicks up, after that I put the water in and stir it, then I put a tiny bit of milk in and then I take the teabag out and leave it to cool (so I don’t burn my mouth) then I drink it 🫖🇬🇧
At tim hortons, when I worked there, we put milk in before the tea and coffee.
Okay, but you never proved that the microwave is a bad alternative to a kettle.
0:37 Honestly in the UK this is just normal - the top shelf of our dishwasher is, like, 60% mugs.
Next episode, matt pats wife leaves him for a brit xD
I add about a quarter milk to my cup I fly the union jack  But like my cuppa milky sweet like your local builder
3 - 4 cups a day. Weak
agreed on milk tea MatPat noooope
Me personally, I'm a high mountain oolong man. No milke, just less than boiling, pour off the wash then steep. I also don't drink any oolong from anywhere but the PRC. They just do it right in China proper, Taiwanese oolong just doesn't match up.
4 cups a day....... not proud to admit sometimes I'm closer to 4 kettles a day
6:10 Yes, I hate glass cups.  Everything you put in it tastes weird.  I also know people who hate plastic and metal teacups.
Watching 3 people drink out of the same cup makes me uncomfortable lol
That long tangent about the dudes having a spa day was a lil sus
My perfect cup of tea: Mug full of water, 2 minutes in the microwave, add spoon full of sugar, stir, insert teabag, leave for 2-7 minutes, remove teabag, enjoy! 👍
Wow me dí cuenta q los latinos somos más simples KQJSJDJF
6:41 So I dont want yall tryna sniff out my whole name but the cups spell my initials and I felt special so I commented
As a tea-drinker myself... EUURG. So much milk...
But here's the part that keeps me up at night, optimizing for the amount of liquid to maximize the amount of tea I can get from my bag without giving up on the flavor and experience. I was so excited for this video, but it missed that part, give it to me!
As a British person, I have been following MatPat's perfect tea formula for the past 3-4 years unknowingly (shape of the teabag and all). I have fully optimised my tea making skills before the optimised method was ever created- by far my most impressive flex.
Aye! South African tea, my favourite is Rooibos, if you need any types ask me, your resident South African. (:
MatPat the hot leaf juice neeedddsss SUGAAARRRR!!!!!!   i cant drink tea otherwise.
Matt:Steph drinks 3-4 mugs a day. me drinking 7 cups a day
MatPat you didn't account for the fact you don't wash teapots and the flavour of the tea stains actually adds to it. A gross mug thats covered in tea stains actually makes the tea taste better.
U guys put milk in tea?In Asia thailand we don't do that
0:36 matpat you got me in the first half
Tea bag: NO NOT THE TIKTOK TEA
6:37 not the boston tea party 😂
I respect Stef more now and I love rooibos I'm south african
Forgot about water...  water changes everyhting
The most picky tea Nation is Japan They don't make the best tea but they go hard on ceremony.
I'm just confused why they put milk cause I don't
Milk pored on top is better and you put milk on the bottom for British in the picture it is wrong because in the picture you have milk on the bottom 17:21
British person here! I feel validated I actually pour my tea first and milk last and by your definition I make my tea the perfect way 😊
I’m British and I’m bringing reinforcements and we are going to war
As a person who spend most of my life in China I can't understand why you add milk to tea it just make the bitter to 'sweet' transition nonexistent.
Milk binds to the tannins making the beverage tastier but less healthy (because tannins are somehow healthy)
South Africa 🎉yeaaaaah
Didn’t use Yorkshire tea bags so the entire test is wrong.
Those pyramid bags are made of plastic. So no thanks to heating for chemical leaching and micro-plastics
Matpat happily jumping up and down is so relatable
Forgot the cold sweet tea with a pound of sugar added
you should do this exact same style but with instant ramen, cup ramen, and fresh noodles
Now you listen here matpat I’ll have you know Yorkshire tea is the greatest beverage to ever grace the world you can talk smack about tetleys and pg tips and stuff tho I’m pretty sure there more irradiated than fallouts ghouls 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
The fact that there was no blind taste testing bothers me. If folks agree from the being that X is worse than Y, then decide to taste test X and Y, the existing bias is going to influence your results. That's why taste tests are usually done as "blind" taste tests without saying which is which.
What about type of milk ?
15:40  I really love how Mat didn’t start jumping up and down until Tom spoke for some reason, that was hilarious.
Nope no milk in tea. No hot tea Southern sweet tea only
Who ever was the editor for this video did a great job. They had so much fun with this video
I like all the teaness .
Let me make y'all my microwave sweet tea and you'll be shocked
Stop please😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔🤬
The optimum cup of tea is a glass of either Milo's or homemade sweet tea
Loose leaf. The bags don't even count.
6:29 "the impulsive thoughts won"
I like how the teacups in the video when they’re putting the tea bags in the mugs are arranged to spell my mass. Is that a science reference?
help me i made some hot chocolate even thought i think it is spring or summer because i wanted some tea and that was the closest thing to tea other than lemonade and milk and im not doing that and i think i burned all my taste buds off
I live in the UK and I've always poured milk on top lol
This English guy doesnt speak for us. Only toffs & boomers use a tea pot  (Yorkshire) tea bag in mug Boil kettle, & pour Leave it a minute Blob of milk. Done  Or drink coffee with baileys in it 🤷‍♀️
"On average" is not an accurate statictical base. how how much milk is the "moderate" amount. Many people don't put ANY milk in their tea and that adds up to the statistic. So most people that do put milk in their tea probaply put more than 1/47.
In my country, after the water boils in the cettle and the water "calms down" a little, we put the herbs directly into it. Leave it for around 5 minuttes and pour it into cups with filters so you don't get lose herbs in your cup. We also don't put any sugar or milk. Just honey.
Not MY tea, though. I don't live in the USA. Yes, Matt, the rest of the would also knows English and watches your videos. Don't automatically assume your viewers are all or mostly American.
1. Tom is probably the most British Person I've ever seen 2. The tea puns are killing me I want to die 3. This video is hilarious I mean mat-pat saying we need someone British is probably one of my top 10 mat-pat lines
I've never put milk first Guess I've been ignoring my own tradition for the better 😂😂
As a tea drinker, milk in tea seems very odd to me. If I make tea I just want tea.  Still, I think I'll still give a go one of these times.
u forgot indian tea called chai
now india
20:35 Hey mat, my cat does the same thing with my sprouting avocado. Even when we have water out for him he chooses the avocado water. Maybe do a theory on that?
As a southerner: Put a pot of water on the stove and put 2 lipton tea bags and wait until it boils/eyeball it Then put that in your favorite pitcher and add 2-3 cups of sugar (if the grandkids are coming over add an extra ½ cup, not a joke actually) Then when your sugar dissolves, fill the rest of the pitcher with cold tap water. Put that un the fridge until cold. Now get a Mason jar glass put ice cubes in and pour in your tea, no milk. Perfect 🤌
it's not a pun if you just use a word that already has the word you are trying to turn into a pun in it! Team is not a pun.
We all know this experiment was illegal since they didn't use the glorious Yorkshire tea
I’ve worked in a quintessentially British tea room for 4 years and I’ve never once seen someone pour milk into their teacup first
Today, I learned I've been making it (mostly) perfectly since I was about 13.
but what about - do you pour the hot water over the tea bag? or put the tea bag into the hot water? Or what temperature should the water be? Can you burn tea?
Me, a Pakistani living in Britain, watching this: nice to know, i'll stick with my Desi chai.
This is not a criticism but I felt you should have invited a native Asian.  I’m ABC, not knowledgeable about tea but my tea experiences or expectations at my Asian restaurant are so different than anything shown.  That said, this was a fun episode
This is how I make my tea  1 cup  2 hot water from stove top or microwave  4 add 1 or two tea bag  5 let it sit and somewhat cool down  6 add  Sugar 7 enjoy
I only use a teapot when im at my nana’s, she’s very proper.   I (northerner) go: Tea bag in, water, teabag out (DO NOT SQUEEZE OR PRESS THE FUCKING TEABAG), sugar, milk done
I have the tiny metal loose leaf tea guy, and I often open different tea bags (some from caffeinated tea, and some herbal tea) and mix it together before adding it to the tea cage. It is very fun.
Does any British person actually put milk first?? Everyone I know that does that is brutally bullied...
Maybe I missed it but did you guys control for the quality of tea leaves. Even tho the same brand was used and the leaves are from the same species of plant, tea producers put the highest quality leaves in their loose leaf and the lowest quality in their flat tea bags with the pyramid bags sitting in the middle. The most controlled test would be to buy empty tea bags and pyramids and stuff them yourself with identical weights of loose leaf so that the quality of leaf is the same across methods.
Most Brits don’t think Milk last is strange. But some people do put it last on that basis that it’s easier to clean.
i am from Britain  and never in my life have i put the milk first and have never heard of anyone putting it in first lol
O my god matpat this is a common occurrence of you overthinking things all the time. Tea is perfectly acceptable with just hunny and water and your favorite kind of tea. And tea is Chinese originally. Not British!
How bout almond milk or almond milk creamers! There are people out there, like me, that have to avoid dairy like the plague! So it’s not out of the realm of theory possibilities!
You forgot about fresh or re-boiled water. It is said the amount of oxygen in the water effects the flavour so you should always fill the kettle with fresh water when you make a cuppa.
where is chaiiiiiiii the best type of tea 😭😭😭😭😭😭
us pakistanis and indians make better tea than anyone and that is just facts .
Tryin’ to say sumthin’ mate?
me watching this while sipping my no milk, flat teabag still in the cup, microwaved tea:
Milk doesn't belong in tea. People in the South have got it right when it comes to tea
im pretty sure they started adding milk to neutralise the tannin taste making it less bitter.
Step far back from my Devine leaf water init- every brit talking to Americans
As someone who’s Chinese I am deeply offended by the fact you found a British person instead of Chinese (this is a joke don’t burn me on the stake)
I make tea using the ISO 3103 standard as a recipe
When do you add sugar as this also matters
In Taiwan the way to make the famous Taiwanese Milk Tea is to put your favorite toppings into the cup first then the ice followed by the freshly brewed tea and finally the fresh full cream milk.
Milk should 100% go in first. Just make sure to empty the cup before you pour in your tea.
I still don't know why people like there tea hot I like mighty freezing cold and I also don't know why people don't make jugs of tea also I called it on the order of what you pour the milk
Who puts milk in their tea? That sould be illegal.
Every British person I know puts the milk on to ans a splash it perfect in a 9 0z mug with you're water just below bolling point
actual way to do it no milk open leaves honey idk time no sugar mountain tea or wut u call it no kettle
3:44 PEEPACHU!
I love the little 'DAD' glue drawing on the fridge, its adorable 😄
The flat tea bag should be dunked up and down to release the flavour properly and squeezed between 2 spoons to release even more flavour.
We actually don't have pyramid shipped tea bags in Australia, we have the flat kind and circle shaped teabags, it also doesn't matter which, they are both good.
I mean that's why u add sugar to your tea, to counteract the bitterness from the tea itself (which is released weather u squeeze the teabag or not).
6:35 "BOSTON TEA PARTY SUMMARIZED" hELP IN LAUGHING SO MUCH THAT IM CRYING
What abt what the teapot is made out of does that make a difference
I don’t know if I should be offended or appreciative 😭👍🏻(a Brit here) Here’s the correct way to make tea  1: get a mug 2: put your tea bag in 3: pour boiling water in the mug 4: leave in longer if you want it strong i leave mine in for 20-30 seconds 5: pour some milk in 6:stir 7: get sugar I put 1-2 teaspoons of sugar in mine :)  8: get more milk if ya want 9: get biscuits preferably chocolate digestives or normal digestives 10: sit back and relax
imagine how an indian would feel if a british dude got so pissed
YOU WILL DIE I'M BRITISH
If you want to grow an avacado, dont put it in water... jsut hrow it in some potting mix, water once, then leave it. As long as it is relatively warm, it will grow. The entire water thing is a waste of time. if you did a gardening theory you would discover this easily.
Hey I want to anger all the British people I make my tea in a kurge and keep my tea bags in while drinking
this is exactly how i drink tea just without the triangle bag thingg
Okay but what kind of milk though cuz there's cow milk goat milk oat milk Etc there's a lot, also how should you heat your tea IDK if it really matters but there is electric stove gas stove wood stove (which IDK how many of those even exist anymore)
Sooo.......... Your telling me that the British ways that I've been thought that's been passed down through generations and maliciously tailored to perfection is the optimal way to have it? Once again, British way is correct.
wim a britman and i waas told by the people making me make the tea to do it ontop, but i dont drink tea
stop it,get some help
British for tea? Start with someone Chinese OR Indian !
guys if you're drinking tea consistently, please at least use a brewing machine and filtered water, not from the sink.
you cant feal 3-degree burns cuz it burns your nerves
No milk is the best
I’m south and East Asian and I 100% don’t make my tea wrong
Can you do one of these for ravioli like how much parmesan should you put on i t frozen or homemade.
Meanwhile I only drink sweet iced tea 😁
Zero milk in tea. WTF. For real. Water. Tea leaves. Nothing else. If you need something else , buy a higher quality tea.
Would have been interesting to have been a fatal 4way between Uk boiled in a kettle straight to cup, China based on the tea making ceremony using tea pots, tik tok/ microwave/USA tea making. My nans way of making tea post ww2 era with no bags for tea just leaves, which left leaves in the bottom of the cup. Possibly to have my fortune read later
15:52 YES! Milk goes in after! Don't be a pauper!
Does the brand of tea shown come in the pyramid tea bags or what the only box I could find because I wanna try that one says unwrapped (coming from someone from the south in USA)
We do something completely different in my country. We boil tea leaves, ginger, a cinnamon stick, lime juice, anise star, 2-3 green apple slices, and honey in a sauce pan. We never add milk. It is absolutely the most fragrant and flavorful tea I’ve ever had. This is why I require multiple tea bags when making a cup of boxed tea lol.
*realizing I drink tea like tiktok, but somehow worse"  Cold water into a mug Drop the flat paper tea bag into the cup (chamomile) Microwave it (I'm sorry) Take it out  Milk  Creamer (hazelnut for me but regular works to)  And the finally  Honey  This is how you make American sugar water with a milipint of tea  I'm probably on a British watch list💀
"But we dont want ranges, we want precose numbers" - proceeds to determine numbers with 4 times less precosion than the ranges
Indonesia: WOW, these drink are the best, lets make a iconic drink for our country and others!
As Tea loving Brit...All I can say is...'Hmm ' 🤔
Where is chai
My tea involves a coffee maker a soup ladle for the perfect tea!
I was always told milk first if it’s a pot of tea cause the tea is brewing in the pot but last in a mug milk last so the milk doesn’t stop the tea from brewing
i'm burmese, in my country we make tea by boiling water and putting tea leaves in. No bag and no milk, honey, sugar or anything like that just the leaves and we don't take it out, so you can imagine how bitter it is. We just kinda deal with the tealeaves floating around in our cups lmao so in the wise words of Zuko...tea really is just hot leaf juice💀
Most people I know do pour the milk after, it just hasn't been updated.
Explain why kettle is better than microwaveing the water
You skipped the most important part of tea - water. Less minerals water have less bitter and more fragrant tea become. So you don't need to add milk.
Fun fact: You do not scale up leaf quantity with water quantity.  Part of why I don't drink tea. I commit tragedies.
My favorite way of making tea.  1. Put water in cup 2. Put cup in microwave  3. Press start 4. Take out cup 5. Place tea bag (I use Jasmine from a local Asian grocery store)  6. Let tea bag seep for however long i feel like 7. Drink. *I typed this before watching the video, but I’m sure I’ll get lots of hate lol  Edit: I’ll continue to make my tea this way regardless because I love my tea. Also the idea of milk in tea is disgusting. Warm milk is vomit inducing. Creamer in coffee is one thing but tea needs to be straight and pure. Even though I’m a typical American sugar addict, I’ve tried milk and sugar in my tea, exactly as instructed by an English person and it was vile.  The important thing is for everyone to drink their stuff the way they enjoy it and everyone can just leave it each other alone.
This is close, but not the perfect tea. 250-350ml cup, Pyramid bags or yorkshire tea, boiled water, 1-2 tea-spoons (4-8g) of sugar, a splash of milk that turns the tea gold (very precise colour and difficult to achieve).  You also have to develop an internal british timer that knows when the perfect time/temperature to drink is  (in britain, we have our own specific cups for personal use that are not shared amongst family or friends so you must train your internal timer with your favourite cup)
So a cool thing about the last experiment you did. That experiment is part of a classic example used to explain the Fisher's exact test for statistical significance
They did not wash the loose leaf tea and let it hydrate before steeping. That’s what you’re supposed to do with loose leaf tea. Ask the Chinese.
You guys need to test the Turkish tea method (or 2 pot method)
If you want to learn tea on a much deeper level, go to the Mei Leaf YouTube channel. You will learn tons. Tea is an entire world unto itself.
You lost the moment you mentioned tea and milk together. Any kind of milk automatically diminishes the health benefits.
@laffingass do u agree
I'm genuinely flabbergasted that y'all don't use equal parts tea and milk. Over here it's either that or foregoing milk entirely (which marks 80% of us lol)  Anyway, herbal tea trumps all
Did you remove the tea from the paper bagged tea to test it as the the loose leaf tea and bagged tea? Very important to do so, as not all tea leaves are created or processed teaqual
The Glass glass was pre heated before the brew
They didn't explain why you shouldn't heat the water in the microwave
Americans. Am I right? Can't even make tea.
Wait a minute !!!  You forget about myanmar tea ?
Did they use the same glass mug that they measured the hot water with for the other mugs? If so, that's going to warm it up considerably before they add hot water. I didn't see him using the glass mug to pour hot water into the other glass mug. Even then, they should probably pour hot water in the measuring mug and pour it out before pouring into the first mug.
When life gives you lemons, MatPat, don't make lemonade, make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your lemons, what am I suppose to do with these! Demand to see life's manger! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! Using the lemons!
Bruh. Only water,green tea with a little bit of peppermint, little bit of brown sugar done
There is no "BRITISH TEA". They basically take things from different countries and make it weird😅
Bro, I use the same coffee mug for millennia. Fun fact-in the US Navy washing your coffee cup is bad luck.
Iranians like me eat sooooooooo much in a day
So I do not drink British tea I guess... I like my leaf water plain. :)
I was rewatching this while eating my lunch and I realised it's probably my favourite theory over all the channels. Which is weird since I don't drink tea 🤔 What sorcery is this?
as a amcerican who is related to ppl from briten i must say i am disgusted by that "tiktok tea"
DO NOT IN*EST over the TikTok mother and daughter made me read that one letter as c rather than g
I now drink hawaiian tea if anyone is from Hawaii your tea is amazing 🤩
Yoooooo it’s a hot version of myself
5:22 a british reaction😭i love that its so true
Mistake: Brits didn’t put milk in tea originally, that was late 1800s they started that. Lemon or sugar only was older than milk tea. My family never added milk, as they moved to the US prior to the milk thing.
Uncle Iroh would be proud
You forgot one little test that boil water in microwave then brew the tea...
Should have gotten an Asian person instead. Asia brought tea to the English.
I think this is the most relevant to me episode of Food Theory I have seen. I actually prefer to drink tea in the spring and fall because local honey is supposed to help with allergies and I’m surprised at what I’ve been doing right and wrong. I normally steep my tea until it’s at a drinkable temperature so I get more flavor but I didn’t realize I was making it more bitter. At least I got adding the milk second right
Im a coffee drinker but when i drink tea i prefer it with no milk so i agree with matpat
Actually you need a Chinese cause we drink tea through out the whole year even if it's 35 degrees Celsius or over 100 degrees Fahrenheit
Question, since smell is linked with taste, and you can’t smell sugar, why does it have such a significant taste with out a significant smell?
that usa woman how shes made her tea that's a sin as a British born i cant stand to see that
as a uk citizen ive never seen or heard of anyone putting the milk in first and being a sane induvial i would trust with holding a pen
Why where they sharing a cup…🤔
I can't believe you didn't test 2 minutes.
Me being british finds the start of this video appalling, having 3-4 cups of tea is not enough and its still hillarious
boil the tea leaves loose ( no paper pack ) in a stovetop boil , then strain it . its much better
i'm sorry but i gotta downvote this 'cause you're not *supposed* to brew loose leaf as long as the other teas, for that very reason! like you later in this very video mention the different steep times for different kinds of bags and yet you didn't factor that in with the original test >:(
OK so any explanation of why you can't microwave the water? Other than having to know which of your cups is microwave safe to not burn yourself?
Oh dang. I've been squeezing my tea bags all my life thinking I was getting all the flavor. Didn't know the extra flavor was bad flavor.
No, you're exactly right! It is a waste to wash your tea/coffee mug every time. I just rinse them out and only wash them maybe once per week.
Just use instant tea 🍵  instead  and  any cup 🥤 will do
Tea is tea 🍵  and coffee is king 😀😁😅🤣🙃
Around the ten min mark I noticed the trophy's had tea in and with a tea bag
Arrgghhh! Proper way to make tea is in a teapot!!!
I am from Hong Kong, I almost only drink tea.....3 to 4 cup minimum a day
F**K YOU ALL, HERBAL AND FRUIT TEAS ARE BETTER
The best tea bag is Tetley
I'm English and I have ALWAYS been a staunch water-first-milk-second advocate. Feels good to be proven right.
In Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. We add condense milk into tea to make tea tarik. Amazing taste for both lactose intolerant and those mutants.
You should do another test where you compare the winner of this video with traditional Turkish tea. A few years ago i would have prefered the British version, but then I visited Turkey, and oh boy, it's so much better
"How much milk should you be putting into your tea?" none.
Sup mates
"Why am I hair" 😂😂😂
We have 2 avocado trees in our kitchen that sprouted last year. They sprouted while resting on toothpicks in water jars. They are about three feet high now in pots. Don’t allow the cat to drink it’s water.- a Southerner who drinks gallons of sweet iced tea.
We need more tests! What about other teas? I've heard certain teas need to steep longer or shorter, so we need a part two!
No milk is best milk
Everyone: “oh haw haw Steph caught the tea, such mom very adult” Me: watching in horror as they drink off the same mugs and rewinding to see if they sipped from the same side of the cup
OMG, I had to stop at: "This channel is built on the premise that I can overthink anything and write it off as a business expense."  That one line is just too good.
I literally drank tea while watching this and then made another one
Teapot? No, kettle into cup with Yorkshire teabag and 2 sugar, 1 minute 30 in mug, squeeze bag with teaspoon, stir, add milk and stir again. Simple
Milk first might be the OLD British way of doing it but, ask any tea drinker here now, and they are AGGRESSIVE about putting the water in first and then the milk! People who pour the milk first are HEATHENS!!!
this is the first time I hear about adding milk to tea.
You guys didn't test different types of a milk. Half and half, creamer, 2%, skim, oat, soy, almond, goat, pea.
Milk?
btw i boil water for 4 mins and i most of the time I measure it to 85 C and im no British's so im very sorry if i done it incorrectly. (⊙_⊙;)
If you add the milk first the water isn't hot enough to steep the tea properly, therefore giving an inferior taste. And I honestly don't know any British person who puts milk first, your resident brit must have been an outlier haha.
what is the best milk to use?
I am a Brit who judges others for putting milk in first, milk on top is elite. You can also judge your preferred milk level better too
The milk first or last is also a class divide situation that comes from posh people with bone China who would pour the milk first to regulate temperature, whereas those in the north with cheaper cups would go milk last. This stands to this day… ask a southerner whether it’s milk first or last they’ll invariably says first, I, as a northerner it’s milk last. And the best cuppa is Yorkshire tea… nothing else comes close PG tips is awful, Taylor’s are so close and yet so far, twinnings are just… I don’t even know what they’re putting in their tea bags and Tetley can just jog on.
Me sitting here disabled and lazy both: *sink water, microwave, 1/3 cup sugar, tea bag in, stir*  edit: oh and I prefer fruit flavors like pomegranate (+green), blueberry, or blackberry (+vanilla) but I’ve been on a Hibiscus kick lately
I have always put milk on the top it just better
I never new some people put milk in there tea
Legend has it, youtube gods had predicted this video. And in an act to stop a new age war, removed the dislike count.
What about types of milk?
Hchjcvhfbvhfhf TICTOCK TEA IS Making me very very ANGRY hcncjccjchcnfjchcbmdcichch
YA FUCIN WAT MEIGHT
Ah yes, time to go make some "classic" family specialty of ours, Vanilla tea.
https://youtu.be/5etY4oSIm3E
"1/5 of the drink is milk?? that's a lot of milk!!!" meanwhile, i'm over here with 1/3 of the drink being milk. if i add less, it just feels like i watered down the milk, which is icky, but if i add more, the tea flavor is just gone.
I like loose leaf tea
Yes best milk is no milk
This video made me laugh so much Thank you. I really needed this.
MatPat always makes the highest quali-tea theory videos on YouTube.
Oh God, the entire world of tea and what do they do? Talk about nothing bur shite english milk soup. The agony.
whats the song in the beginnning, the piano one?
4:36 - 4:45 That's why you want to use Keetle for Tea and not Share this Tearrible expirience with Matthew  (sorry for the joke, this video made me do this)
Well the poor people didn't have taste so they would poor their milk first but the rich would do it the way you did it so us brits did make the correct tea first
honey > milk
The moment you add milk to tea you ruin it. You also destroy most of the antioxidants.
Tick tack toe 3 puns in a row
Where's the Chinese way? Hhh
Honestly adding hot tea to milk, seems disgusting. I just imaging the milk curdling and being all gross. No thank you. I don't like to add anything to my tea. No sweeteners or milk or anything. I like the slight bitter taste you get from the tea just alone.
Milk does not belong in tea
LEAF the puns alone! They make me BUSHED! Ba-Dum-TISS!
you dont put milk in tea :(
The glass was the hottest because you preheated it by using it to measure
The steps to make the perfect cup of tea given towards the end of this are literally just how everyone makes here. Shocker.
Don't like milk or sugar in any tea only sometimes honey and lemon juice also i like to squeeze bag every single time get everything from the tea
Temperature. Why didn't you test brewing temp?
But what type of milk should you use?
I add straight cream to my tea.  Sorry, not sorry💅🏼
We put the milk in first?
I hate milk in my tea. 🤷‍♀️
They're so funny, I love how much fun some of the food theories are!
paki dude takin notes
No, the glass one “kept it hotter” because the other 2 cups had it transferred from another vessel and not straight from the kettle and this decreased the temp in this process
5:40 I thought he was going to say we have genetically modified tea leaves.
I'm also a "No milk or sugar in tea" guy
I'm actually with you no milk in tea unless it's boba
Uh, I wasn't know that the tee need milk ._.
Asia? I thought leaves for tea grew everywhere in the world
Meanwhile in India. We mix milk and water first then put it to boil and then add small tea grains and sugar to the boiling Milk
my parents drink 3 kettles of tea a day
Witch milk would be the best milk though ?
How much water per tea bag though?
Why do British as the ultimate say in tea, when Asian countries have been doing it for thousands of years?
How can someone boil water, add the tea in said water, then instantly adding milk over? Why are you boiling that water in the first place? LOL.
I'm no tea drinker, mi parents and sis are the ones with it, but I wanna show the what tea with milk is as they've never drank tea with milk. My only struggle is to exactly tell the difference between milk on top or on bottom.  (I'm an Spanish native speaker, Latino and I know what on top or bottom mean, I'm just not understanding how you put it in one way or the other. To me ya just pour it in it, ya know? 😅)   So if anyone could help me that would be wonderful. If not it's fine, I'm gonna make myself some investigation.
I feel......         offended and personally hurt as a pure bred brit
i'm kinda sad they missed my favorite tea cup; the wine glass.
That insulated tea glass is my nemesis, hate it with all my heart. Love the episode theorists!
Beer has a similar culture around the glasses you drink it out of. Matt Pat I want to see a deep dive into beers in bottle vs can vs the proper glass! Your team does a great job. Great content!
As a British tea drinker, MatPat saying they've dunked on the British by adding the milk on top and it being better is a little funny since everyone I know (except my nan) considers adding the milk first to be a crime.
i am compleet monster i do 1/4milk ratio i also add the milk straight in to the hot water then the teabag and then i becos i like my tea extra strong i brew it 5-10mins and squeezeee the bag if i can be asked i love those tannins and if im sick or have a sweettooth graving add a little honey and i dont mean no bullshit store bought honey i mean honey thats been just been seperated from combs and the tub of honey has both that runnier honey like in those cute plastic serving bottles and it also has that stiff stuff
Overall a nice video! :) But I was surprised you didn't test the tea leaf "geometry". In tea bags the leaves are in smaller pieces compared to loose leaf tea which often (?) has larger leaves, or leaf pieces, which,  in theory, would affect the flavour; you even comment on the brew time difference. So in this test the "tea container" variable is not fully separated from the leaf variable. Ideally you would also test brewing the flat and pyramid bag leaves in a bauble for the same brew time. (Ideally you would also try loose leaves in the other tea containers, but that could get cumbersome.)  I think I've heard at some point (although I forgot where and with a quick search I haven't found a source) that smaller leaf pieces can tend to generate a bitter taste in the tea due to more chlorophyll being able to "leak" from the larger "cut" area.   As of yet I don't think I have seen this tested and the result would be interesting!
I like my tea sweet
Chinese tea ?
Everyone drinks it with the milk last in England . Milk first people are grim
Everyone drinks it with the milk last in England . Milk first people are grim
Is steph canonly british? lol yes i know she's Italian
Matpat: "Maybe Brits need to put on milk after the water" Me, who's always put in milk last: 😳
I don't put milk in my tea, but to be fair I'm more of a green tea guy, so it's not really the same
But, but but -- i LIKE the tannin! (and i drink the stuff without milk, sugar, zip - NADA! )
As a British person, I think I'm qualified to say that was some shitea puns guys 😳 I've lived in America too though, and you guys make shittea'r tea than puns
Who in there right mind puts the milk in first? I don't think anyone here in the UK does that.
What about Chinese in japanese way of brewing tea And the traditions of Latin Do you also know that thing drink different Types of tea for every season.
I just put the T. bag in the Teapot Boiled it After is done I pour a cup And that's it Sometimes I will add sugar By rarely ever add milk.
Dude I drink up teapot
I mean cream is a thing to soooooooo witch cream or milk
I swear to god after watching this video i keep hearing tea in words making me really thirs-tea
i dunno maybe the milk on top might be because its generally poured cold into hot tea so maybe it is able to diffuse better? (cold goes down and hot goes up)
You guys are my comfort channel
i enjoy this episode but i want to know if the the temperature makes a difference when heating up the water makes for the tea. i bring this up because i've heard that different teas all need different temps to get the optimal flavor. it's kinda like if Uncle Iroh was telling Zuko that he make burnt leaf water again
Texas sweet tea peak
You should do one comparing British Tea and Kenyan Tea..
I know I’m a true Brit when I already fit the entire checklist of tea making 😂
i am very british , WE PUT THE MILK ON THE TOP!!!!!!!
Shut up we used to own America ssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhh
How dare you it is the right way
13:26 my dad likes it the same way, Mat, so you're not alone!
She is one fine woman. She’ll be mine one day ❤
milk after is better i've been saying it for years maybe someone will listen now
And I was so excited to learn how to properly make my matcha green and tulsi basil. But this is still really awesome. I drink about 3 large teapots worth of tea every day so this will likely save me money.
And here I was hoping there would be a scene of her smacking him upside the head for the excessive puns.
This is a little off of tea but I like mostly like my hot-chocolate not they hot because it has a nice cooling taste and a pretty good tasting like back up taste I would say.
I think there was a missed pun or joke instead of "change of pace" shoulda been "different cup a tea"
Ok but just to clarify it isn't "brittish" to like tea since they stole and exploited other people to get it
am i the dumb on my family boils the tea powder in milk strain it the we serve it no ?
Stef clean mess
11:27 Trying to find out the exact steeping time is like having the millennials trying to reinvent the brewing system 10:22.
British tea= milk tea
These tea jokes are driving me towards insani - tea
i didn't realize that there could be so much of a different between tea. personally, my perfect cup is oolong tea steeped (with a lid or just using a small plate to cover the cup) until the color looks right. if i want it sweetened, i'll also add a chunk or two of rock sugar that's roughly the size of the first section of your thumb. my usual steep time is about 2-3 minutes (or longer, since i actually prefer a stronger cup) depending on the type of oolong tea, since the colors can differ, but also with loose leaf tea sometimes you want to steep it for less time. plus the flavor profile with oolong tends to shift the more you steep it since you can reuse the loose leaf for more brews.  i'd love to see a follow up video where you guys test out other teas from asia since the tea culture is so varied with all the different types.
My guess would be that having the milk first It stays somewhat sedentary at the bottom and doesn't diffuse as thoroughly even with some agitation by a spoon.
Doesn't the type of milk and added sugar also play a massive part in the flavour your tea would be? also I'm British and I've always put the milk on top it's just better
So, I'm British, as you may be able to tell. And I'll be honest, I'd never heard of putting the milk in first in that way you showed. We always put it in last, but I've heard mention of "milk in first" meaning before the tea bag, but everyone I know universally agrees that's bad, you want the hotter water to reach the tea for the particles to have maximum kinetic energy for optimum osmosis. And hardly scientific but eyeballing what I've seen in restaurants parties, 15-30 ml of milk is about what everyone adds afterwards.  So I'm afraid you revolutionaries haven't really upended anything, at least not in my locality of the Western Midlands.
Now hold on I live down here in the South and the only to main brand of tea is Lipton tea and second if you put milk in the tea in the south you’ll be branded a insane criminal.
So I can't smell. I was once offered tea, and it just tasted like hot water to me. Second time I had tea, it was... a liquid... I think.  I'd love a theory on how much our ability to smell affects our appetite.
I want tea after this :,> Time to implement this to my tea! (And try milk with tea, I never exactly knew about this.)
Spill the tea bro
4:10 finally a proper map 😮‍💨
I'm here to say that this tea is wrong, coffee is better.        let the brits and Indians start a war in the replies
Just gonna say this stuff now so you know (I am British, as background so you know I’m probably right)  2:02 we call “arithmetic” mathematics or “math” 3:56 you shown Britain and Ireland. Whilst Northern Ireland is part of Britain, Ireland is not.  Just thought I should say, as some Americans and other nationalities don’t know this. The editors did a great job of editing this and love your theories! Keep up the good work on all your channels, and best of wishes to your new channel, The Style Theorists!
Me only putting tea, water honey/sugar: 😊  Also me finding out that u put milk in the tea: 💀  Just learn something new! 😊👍
As far as the teapot vs mug, typically wouldn't you "prime" the pot with hot water to warm it up then dump the water and be your pot of tea. This stops it from being too cool
Britian: the place that colonized quarter of the entire world and started wars for spices yet they never use them on food
These guys are the most wholesome couple on the internet
21:03-21:07 lol
Steph: 3-4 a day Me: awwww that's cute
My comment is not about tea. It's about why the alvacatao seed is not sprouting. You may want to check this out but I was told that imported produce is sometimes exposed to x-rays for bacteria control. This also denatures the seeds.  It's worth checking out. Food treated this way by law will retain its organic classification.
Loved this! Only note is: what about brew temperature and water quality? As you go up in elevation, the boiling point of water goes down; currently living in Colorado about a mile above sea level where water boils at 205, and grew up in Wyoming at 7200+ ft above sea level where it boils at 201.   As far as water quality goes, I try to use spring water to get around varying qualities of municipal taps (even filters can be hit or miss tbh).
1:48 lol I get the reference
Iroh laughing in the corner in the distance....
Yk Tea in Britain can actually be tea or coffee
The British were already pouring the milk over their tea. It was the poor working class that poured the milk in their cheap cups first to stop it from chipping/cracking. The upper classes in society, with their more expensive china, actually added the milk on top.
Interesting…adding milk to the tea last is the equivalent of adding coconut cream last to curry. That makes sense!   As for the teapot vs. mug theory, I wish that my mother, who grew up in China during Mao’s revolution, went over with me more of the science of food. It would’ve saved me a lot of experimentation time in my adult years and made me less resistant towards Chemistry.   My mother told me not to touch cooking often because at the time, she wanted me to focus on my studies. But alas, despite me being smart, sweet, and hard working, both academia and corporate America didn’t like me wanting to prove that artists deserve to have decent salaries, work-life balances, and go see doctors whenever. As such, I felt that the kitchen was more of my safe haven as an adult.   Plus, I wanted to prove a former abuse partner wrong that I’m allowed to be my own person and cook healthy foods. Long story on that one.  Great episode by the way! Nice that you had a British person on board. :)
I would love to see a Part 2 to this because 1. Most US people don't do milk in tea so what's the best thing to do for non-milk  2. Iced Tea is way more popular too and there's many ways to make it (Cold Brew where you let it steep in cold water in the fridge for a day, Sun Tea which is the same but on the counter, and boiling hot tea then cooling it down, either by fridge or ice) and they also sell Iced Tea/Cold Brew specific bags, how do they affect the product vs standard tea bags
Is microwaving tea really that bad?
What about the temperature of the water?
Milk doesn’t belong in tea FFS
The biggest propaganda the UK managed to spread was the fact that tea is their thing. British tea is about the worst possible kind of tea - tastes of shite, and they put milk in it to make it shittier. Literally every other country does tea better.
I’m drinking tea while watching this video👀👀👀 my dad boils his tea in microwave and admittedly I use to do the same ;-;
No sugar leave the bag in
It depends if your putting the Warter in tea pot or your putting the water your tea cup
As a British Person this is highly offencive
My personal favorite teas are Arizona green tea with honey and ginseng and honey, and chamomile with milk and honey
Yorkshire tea
Dear Americans, please stop brewing tea in cold water and then putting it in the microwave. Sincerely, every Brit ever
As a Brit, I’ve never put the milk in first. That’s usually only done when using a teapot but even then I still add second
As a brit, everyone I know adds the milk last anyways, I never even knew that the traditional way was to put the milk first😂 so I feel like the majority of Brits have done it just fine
So how much sugar...
I subbed from pink sauce video and now i'm theorists
Where the heck is sweet iced tea in all this
Question: Is British tea any different from the tea that's used from  the milk tea that is used in boba milk tea?
Milk doesn't belong in Tea 😤
take a sip of tea every time they make a pun to stay hydrated
I'm honoured to be a Brit that has been making tea the scientifically better way my whole life. 🇬🇧 Take that pre-brew milkers! ☕️😂
WHAT TYPE OF MILK MATTERS
as a british person, if someone i knew put the milk in first, they would be dead to me, it's sacrilege
As a slav I dont add milk to my tea
Let's be clear: BRITISH TEA SUCKS!
WHERES THE SUGAR (2 TEASPOONS)
I live in London abd it's actually seen as blasphemy here to put milk first. So I was confused when he said milk first. So brits way is still the best.
I was surprised that loose leaf tea wasn’t the best here - I always thought teabags usually had smaller particles, and lower quality than full, rich leaves? Idk but also on another note, I only love tea when scalding hot, and I hate when it’s put in a large (usually metallic) travel mug or foam travel cup. For me it’s gotta be in a normal mug.
why do ppl (people) put milk in there tea
Only only right way for English tea is 1. Tea Bag 2. Boiling Water 3. Stir  4. Sugar / No sugar ( Your Choice ) 5. Stir 6. Milk ( Your choice ) 7. Stir 8. Enjoy
they do not mention however that everyone i have seen in the uk adds milk last anyway, the commoners have adapted however i do not know about in high end establishments
New challenge British vs china vs Japan go
putting milk into tea, i think that every weird  btw  lovely background art
This is wrong on so many levels. If American tea is 1/10 for British guys then British tea is like 0.1/10 for an Indian.  You boil water on stove/gas with tea leaves (preferably powder) in it, then  after it boils you add milk in equal ammount (also sugar to the taste) and let it boil once more. This what kid in india would make, a most basic and noob version of tea here.  Surprise, surprise, we actually use species in tea, like cardamom, ginger etc.
Man, you have milk in you'r tea??? In Croatia.. tea makes you.
Do you know how Americans actually make their tea? By throwing it in the harbor!
Y’all couldn’t get an Asian person on to talk about tea even after saying that tea comes from Asia 😭
I'm lactose intolerant so I don't add milk
I just love the way Tom phrases everything. "How does one open this bag?"
It's weird how most Chinese people will not really care how you make your tea but British people act like you have murdered someone
Honestly steeping for 4 minutes... Perfect.. it's like 3 minutes but with way more flavor and none of the bitterness from 5 minutes
6:32 Matt looks genuinely annoyed at the interruption, like they threw him off of his game for a second.
“This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!” -Iroh
2:56  you know it’s bad when I me myself know that she did something wrong, without even looking at their faces, or listening to them
Your tea is false I'm the tea god
I use a gaiwan and adjust the temperature of the water based on the kind of tea i'm making.  Btw i know someone who steeps the tea for like way too long and drink it with the bag still in. Like dude you don't like tea you like bitter soup.
There are a lot of people who drink tea with milk on top…
proper tea is  sugar teabag then boil the kettle pour the water in from the kettle put milk in stir then take the tea bag out
Im sorry, but that's just so crazy for me to see people who are struggling to make a normal regular TEA. And im not even British
I’m glad Steph gets to drink free tea teaday
People do milk then tea? Why
You think Brits know tea? *Laughs in Chinese and Indian*
Now we wait for the sugar variable on a update for this video :)
As a resident of Assam, our common tea preparation is to boil milk and add rolled tea leaves (CTC tea) along with sugar, bring it to a boil and strain the preparation.
Love me some good old tea. I do not know why, but it just relaxes me. Tea time is always just tea, sometimes with a snack. No phones, books, work etc., just tea and my inner thoughts. And no I am not a Brit.
Holosexuals like this video
Why didn’t you test microwaved vs kettle-boiled water? Microwaving water is just heating it. There’s no "radiation" added to it. Nothing is destroyed that isn’t destroyed when boiling in a kettle. The only difference is that microwaved water doesn’t pick up the metallic flavor from a kettle. Do people prefer that metallic flavor?
Good luck
I would never put milk in my tea
When I saw the tik tok I was crying
I'm turkish, at breakfast, after breakfast, before dinner, in between, after dinner... We dont put milk in it, just plain. (Just sometimes with sugar) We use a special glass, it is called "ince belli bardak" or roughly translates to slim waist glass.
what about a cup of  southern sweet ice tea? 😋
Try Pakistani chai bro it slaps mat pat ik u not finna read this but habibi come to Pakistan
Steph should optimize who she's married to. 😏
I know practically every tea fan in the UK will want to have me hung, drawn and quartered for this, but here goes; when it comes to tea, God bless America, first by ditching the milk, then making tea a year-round drink with iced tea, and finally having our Southern tea lovers  perfecting it with sweet tea.
The TikTok tea makes me uncomfortable and sad because I’m not a massive tea drinker, but even I know that the microwave is so wrong Edit: also the over the top reactions over everything in the first part of the video just makes me so happy
I think most people in Britain put the milk on last, the very least no-one I know/have met has (British person)
at the back of our chemistry books in high school (uk) they had a how to make the perfect cup of tea. Also you only put the milk in first if youre using china to protect it from the boiling water
No disrespectm but when Matt said "the dishwasher is full of tea" i almost thought he meant Steff
Why u not use the metal ball thay use to make tea
Really a guy who does shows asks why is handle so hot after in the micro
Amen ain't hard to clean a cup n not put in the dishwasher. Don't be lazy fyi
The reason there is a taste difference between milk in first and after is the same as water in acid or pouring acid into water, milk in first as you pour in the water you increase the temperature of the milk gradually, pouring milk in after burns the milk as there's a mass of heat and it burns the milk, coffee always tastes better with milk in first as it makes it taste more creamy
The material of the cup makes a big difference, I use about 5ml of milk to my tea, for the teapot, pre warm it before adding the bags and water
"pyramid bags" I always thought those were tetrahedra when seeing them.
She measures her tea consumption in cups? That’s cute.   I consume between 3-5 LITERS of tea a day… not including the roughly 2-3 kombuchas I drink a day.  Ok technically about half that tea is usually "tisane” not tea, because I don’t consume caffeine after 3pm.
A wise man one said, “This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!”
3 minutes in and I loved Tom's accent
*laughs in the chinese tea way*
This video came back to mind while I was drinking my water. I live in a dorm and have to refill bottles of water I had before, while changing them out with new ones every so often. I noticed that the water I filled this wine bottle-shaped bottle our campus sells tastes far cleaner to me than the others, despite being the SAME water. Does the shape of the cup/bottle change how you taste water based on prior experiences with what you've drank from the same cup?
The milk going on the bottom thing only works if you're brewing your tea in a teapot. Even then i don't know anyone who puts the milk into the cup before the tea. Tea first. Then milk. It's the law.
Me a turkish guy  WHY are they putting milk in TEA
Great video, but two things: 1. You should have tested the steeping temperature, I feel most people make it too hot and scald their tea and for certain teas it might even be better to steep at room temp. 2. The pyramid bags may have micro plastics.
That mug was so hot because it's not microwave safe
Can you please do this for COFFEE I feel like there's 54543113546484648 ways  to make coffee and I want the method that is best tasting!
as a person who has drank tea his whole life this video is very redundant but I am glad that people who don't finally have the correct information without a lifetime of trial and error
You like Sheldon don't you 😏
I find it funny when it come to tea everybody think British people but that just misinformation. Google who drink most tea and you gonna see Turkish people worship tea like we drink at least double amounts of tea than brist can even dream about. Also second place belong to Ireland
Milk tea is for babies. I drink my tea straight.
"The perfect cup of tea" immediately default to teabags. Already failed before you started.
"warm leaf water" How could one of my own species say something so horrible?
What type of milk should I use WALMART YOU BETTER HAVE A GOOD RANGE OF MILK
only correct way to make tea:  add a tea bag and some sugar boil the water and pour it into the mug stir  when fully mixed, take out teabag with spoon  pour in milk  add more sugar if needed  stir enjoy
im surprised one major factor was not talked about. the temp of the water when making tea is extremely important, and the type of tea is also important. majority of the teas require water that is under the boiling point of water. so letting your kettle boil to over 100 C is going to burn your tea and yes it is burnt tea. you can taste a huge difference. like for my green teas, I boil my water to 80-85 C and I dont get the bitter burnt taste any more. there are even some new fancy kettles and water boiling devices that allow you to set the temp of the water for a specific type of tea.
But what about the use of lemon??
... i brew my tea
Sutsuz çay, cam bardakta, ver mehteri
The M cup is for Matthew, S for Steph, Who owns the “A” cup?
The objectively best way to make tea is use loose leaf tea and steep it in a clay kyusu teapot. If you use tea bags you're using the objectively worst way to make tea because not only are tea bags restricting the leaves and not allowing them enough space to open up, but tea bags are made with the leftovers of the tea production process. The fannings that nobody wants are used to make teabags which leads to a very bitter tasting tea which is why Brits put milk into their tea
Can you please do a part 2 of this episode but with what kind of milk. Also maybe with other sorts of tea
I just have 1 question, how many grams of tea per cup is ideal?
Ok- In the mornings I have tea, but I’m to lazy to boil it. So I microwave it lol. It’s like I don’t care if if it taste slightly off, or it’s more unhealthy, I’m just lazy!
I still have a lot of questions.  What kind of milk?  Cream?  Half and half?  What difference does microwaving water make vs a kettle?
For experiment #5 you didn’t include my personal favorite method, iv drip
You guys put milk in your teas? I am taking many notes on this
Why would it matter if you heated the water on the microwave or  not?  There is absolutely  no way that it could make a difference. Energy is  energy, temperature is  temperature, the water doesn't really know how it was heated.
She drinks 3 to 4 cups of tea a day? So she's not really a tea drinker then 🤣  I steep my tea overnight in a 2L glass teapot (1 red rose bag, I'm Canadian 😆), so it's room temp. Add sugar and that's it. Been doing it that way since the 1970s,cause that's how my mom did it.  I drink it more like a cola than tea I guess.  My teachers thought I drank apple juice as a kid allot in elementary school. I told them I hated apple juice, my thermos is filled with cold tea 😁
For me milk in hot tea is a no. I don't like diluting the tea flavor at all. If I'm doing cold tea, particularly a green tea for just a light flavor, then I might add milk, might not.
caffeine is over rated
If you think you’re going to make BRITs mad just wait for the Turkish to come in with the reinforcements
what about what type of milk
I actually really enjoy bitter flavors. So, while I don't do it for others, my tea bag stays in my mug. I really enjoy it. But you do you everyone else.
As a Indian, I am physically angered by how tiktokers make tea
How we Indians make tea- boil milk, add sugar according to preferences then add tea (i teaspoon for 1cup) , look at the colour until it's seems correct and then with a net pour tea in cup. Done.
As a brit, I can say I think you'll be hard pressed to find one of us who says the milk should go first
Try your hot tea with a splash of vanilla creamer 😉
Huh, I just put the tea bag inside my mouth and let that tea  flow in directly
This isn't Food theory this is Liquid theory
"how much milk should be put into the tea?" None, because we're not British psychopaths.
May be my ignorant American mind but I always find it weird to put milk in tea. If anything I only put honey in my tea, but usually I don't put anything in it unless I'm not feeling good
how dare you not give britainball a monocle and top hat i will eliminate you you have violated the countryball community!
Did they really spend a whole video discovering something us northerners have been doing for decades?
Wrong, when life gives you lemons call 'em yellow oranges and sell 'em for double the price
What about sugar
You could do one with hot chocolate
3-4 mugs a day those are some rookie numbers
I am SO late to this video BUT i have more information because [drumroll] you should redo this with green tea! Why? because the variables are WAAAAY more picky.
Tea is one of the worst drinks, no wonder we threw it into the river
Tea purists don't need milk or sugar in their tea.
the more bitter the tea the better
you should really do this for other hot drink like hot chocolate or coffee
I am a teaholic, but found that a coffee pot helps for loose leaf tea.   Yes I know it is the cheaters way, but it works better for me as I love hot tea.  I also use half and half, and drink the entire 12 cup pot.  I add the half and half to the top after steeping
13:11 You’re showing fractions but are talking about ratios.
Tea belongs in the harbor 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
I use my Keurig to heat the water. I put my cup under it with the tea bag inside it. Set a timer for 3 minutes. I use agave nectar and add soy milk... love it!!! Oh, and this is for Chai tea.
Who is putting the milk in first?
I make tea in my coffee maker. The flat bags are actually perfect for this because you can spread the tea evenly before laying it down. You only need one or two tea bags depending on how big they are, how strong you like it, and how much you're making. (My preference is to make 12 cups using either one large teabag or two small teabags. Different brands of tea use different sizes of tea bags and fill them with different amounts of tea.)
I am extremely british and i dont like tea
I dont use milk.... i use hot water and a tea bag and suger
In Slovakia we actually don't put milk in our tea we put hot water by using the thing we use to make coffee not coffee maker to make the water warm then tea bag add sugar and you are done
The objectively best way to prepare tea: Don't!
why milk in the tea tho :(
would be nice to see if any of these make a difference. sugar, brown sugar, splenda? paper cup, metal cup, ceramic, glass?
As an American who recently discovered adding milk to tea, all of this about matches what I found to be best. Sadly the flat paper teabags are about all you can find and we don't have a teapot so the closest to proper tea is by cutting the paper bags open into a loose leaf holder
Turns out Hong Kong got it right and they were making milk tea the way MatPat found out as the best way to make tea.....  Hong Kong milk tea arguably is BETTER than British milk tea.
Maple syrup and milk for me nothing else heat it up for a couple of seconds in a microwave
You know… round teabags are common as well.. they puff up into spheres.. which I would think should allow the tea to do it’s thing..
Oh yeah by the way you don't need a tea pot
I am British and I hate you now you did it wrong
Matpat: How much milk should you be putting into your tea?  The Dutch: None.
Oh dear, not the plastic tea bag!!! You're drinking micro plastics!!!
@8:54 she says "wow, wow wow wow" an intealigent Ryan George reference
...i love strong tannic tea. Yes, i do squeeze the tea bag
We brits put milk first. You said it Matt it eas an ancient thing to do milk first
I think just the tea and the hot water is the best way, but i'm also lactose intolerant so i won't use milk in my tea.(oolong)
tea was a mistake
In order to test the heat factor, you should have heated all 3 mugs by pouring hot water in them before pouring the final "hot water" that you would use. Because you used the glass mug to pour into the other two mugs, that mug got a lot more hot water time compared to the other two mugs. Do-over.
But what if I like my tea bitter
Not to be that person but you never tested materials of the kettle.
LOL once i seen the American Tea part i had to click away from the video. I wish i could  unsee that LMAO
15:54 i'm now wondering how the order of pouring tea and milk matters if you're gonna stir it? Assuming you're not brewing the teabag inside the milk + hot water combo you shouldn't have any difference in taste.. If you brew your tea in a teapot and pour it over cold milk, or your pour cold milk over mug-brewed tea, shouldn't it taste the same? 🤔
How I drink my Tea (German, Rooibos Tea):  Put 1 1/2 Tea Spoons of sugar in my Pot, with my steel Tea egg, pour the water in, steep for 4 Minutes, no Milk, shortbread as a snack beside it.
You guys should have done sweeteners, sugar, honey and stevia too!
But.. what kind of milk? Skim? Whole? Oat? Almond? NF?
well i think the best way is up to taste
Wait people add milk to tea?
I just want to add, as a person living in the uk. Practically no one puts milk in first, if I see people doing that I say something!
Real men keep the teabag in.
i still boil water in the microwave, but I use a pyrex measuring mug because I'm not insane
My stance on tea is that it depends on the leaves.  Oolong should have no additives...English Breakfast or Earl Grey absolutely needs milk and sugar to taste.
Honestly mat I really really want you to try out turkish tea as its also mostly in our culture to drink tea whenever even having 7-8 cups a day or even more during visits. My father for instance drinks 4 cups a day normally but back to back and on a visit day where we visit family my dad drinks 13 cups including the ones at home. And it's way wayyy more different then the British version as it's without the milk but also just different. Give it a chance and if u want I could show you how our tea works.
The UK when Tik-tok tea 💀
Only barbarians put milk in first. But, what about sugar? 0 teaspoons? 1 teaspoon? 2 teaspoons? 3 teaspoons?? 🧐
They destroyed my country for tea and can't even make it right
As a Chinese person, I am horrified at the fact that people put milk into their tea
I'm sad that he chose a Bri'ish person instead of a Chinese person  (I was going to say stuff like how the he chose the person from the country of fake teas, but I feel like I'll get yelled at in the replies)
This should be obvious but Tea is not British. It is Chinese. That's the cultural perspective this video lacks.
aah yes weaklings.    1/47th part milk lmao. We put atleast 1/3 milk(whole milk ofcourse sometimes even not boiled fresh from the cow), 1/2 would be considered average but i personally like 3/4th milk. But thats ofcourse not "British" tea but thats indian tea the same tea ofcourse just better version of it(biased). ooh ya some geniuses call it chai tea( chai means tea btw so they call it tea tea) but its the same tea.  Also the milk after the water actually has a reasoning i am surprised they didnt mention it but it has nothing to do with taste but practicality. You see water when heated at high temperature, boils wherease milk if not constantly stirred sits at the bottom of the pan which can make the whole tea go bad. So ya, the more you know.   Although overall a really good video. Good job keep it my my guy.
Aaa
You should also test what milk tastes best with what tea
The milk first was for the poorer drinkers of tea technically you agreed with British tea culture people only did milk first for poor quality porcelain
0:25 Same here Steph, same here; but I drink my mom’s homemade sweet tea, and I drink it cold
Where is The lemon?  You never hade 2 3 drops of lemon in your tea your missing out on something remarkable. Its Def a flavor popper just like salt for The food but even more effect.
I love matpat's puns there TEArific
13:35 totally agree on that one
"This is the best way to make your tea!". The person who likes bitter, extremely hot and extra weak tasting tea. Takes notes
What about sugar? Should you do sugar before milk? How much sugar?!
And here I am sitting in horror watching tea bags being put in the cup wha
Matpat thinking we put the milk in first: Every brit doing the omplete opposite;
Please TEA-ch us the proper-TEA of Britain’s fave drink of antiqui-TEA! 🇬🇧 (Don’t worry; I’ll LEAF it alone now!) 😏
Two words… NO MILK!!! (Milk belongs in coffee, not tea)
3-4 cups ? bro i drink 3 tea pots a day
But what happens with mixing the milk in? does it actually change anything
turkey
No. No milk. I'll take a bit of lemon and sweetener in the summer, but tea shouldn't taste like cow juice. As for brewing, why not a French press? Just don't press the leaves. I do use a metal basket filter, though. As for mug washing, reuse until the mug becomes noticeably stained, then spray with diluted bleach and rinse well.
So for your tea length portion you mentioned you wanted specific times. Unfortunately the reason cooking has ranges is because people making food at different altitudes, humidity, and ambient temperature (Maybe you like tea whilst camping) changes final product. I suspect this would have a meaningful impact. Not to mention the subjectivity of how bitter a person likes their tea. If you a fellow view of this video want the perfect cup of tea I would recommend experimenting yourself.
So like... what I've been doing. Great!
You also pre-warmed the glass by using it to pour the hot water into the other mugs, ruining the entire experiment. Tik tok tea must be better with this level of scientific excellence.
So many things are wrong here. This is a video on something I learned throughout the years and now I know how much of the video is just wrong. This gave me a lot of perspective on their other videos, on topics I don't know anything about.
Boston tea party summarize got me laughing 😂
I'm Britain  and milk on top
Sweet iced tea from the south, maybe even peach flavored iced tea.
Ayo how much water tho
I never take my teabag out of my cup :p
FYI a derogatory term for a brittish person is Tea-Wop.
I'm extremely proud to know that I make British tea by instinct; without even knowing how the brits make tea the 10% British in me  taught me how.
Hot leaf juice
Cold brew overnight is the best flavor. Tannins are released by heat. Calcium in milk binds to the caffeine preventing it from binding to receptors in the body. I agree with Matt, no milk.  Similarly, cold brew coffee is more mild and not bitter. Floral/fruity notes are more noticeable.
Should've gotten an old Chinese dude to come tell you why your tea is wrong like uncle from Jackie Chan adventures or Uncle Iroh ( I know both actors are Japanese not Chinese but China is where Brits got their tea, the are the OG tea experts). I made super bitter tea when I was younger but my daughter grandpa lived with us for a few years and he grew up in the mountains of Russia where he drank more tea than ate food so he made me up my tea game, now that he's passed I still buy Akbar because of him
I Am American But I Make My Tea In The Microwave Because My Mother Has Never Got A Kettle, Also I Put One Sugar Cube In And Like 1 Teaspoon Of Milk And 1 Teaspoon Of Honey. Ha Ha Tea Spoon.
Am from the UK and am like "you put milk in tea? "
Milk first scalds the milk. Tea first cools the tea when the cup absorbs the heat.   The tea steeper is a horrible invention. You should have had your loose leaf in the tea pot. There’s not nearly enough space for the leaves in that thing.   Even though they are the same brand I guarantee that you have at least two if not three different teas. Bags usually contain the lowest quality of tea. The grade is usually fannings or dust. It’s what’s left after processing the good tea. Pyramids usually contain better tea but not always.   (To be really picky, you showed oolong leaves during the steeping segment. Totally different style of tea.)
I dislike tea, I can’t imagine how anyone could chug four cups of hot leaf-water.
I swear I followed this video and my tea evolved
I hate this episode. The puns make me lose my sanitea
Ever brit (including me) commenting upon how triggering this is.
First 3 mins of this video is just puns 😂
You could say Steph is royalTEA
I’ll stick with my bean juice, which I massively improved the flavor of by grinding the beans fresh.
I'm right there with you Matpat, milk doesn't belong in tea. I'm also from the south where sweet tea stands Supreme.
If you already "runied" the flavor of tea by pouring milk and you are not tea experts, the vessel which you use to drink tea is not going to make mush difference.
Brits are experts on tea like they are experts on artifacts from other countries. As in, they stole it.
Dude ur using Tea Bags. That alone makes every tea low quality.
I’m Pakistani we boil the milk as well at 1:1 ratio 😂😂😂
Matpat is toxic to Britten
Doesn’t the temperature also effect the taste of the tea also yeah I’m sorry this is comment is super late heheheh
1:55 me
It actually makes sense that milk on top is better since milk on bottom was to help the poor people not shattered cups lol.. only royalty puts milk on top
The amount of milk is dependent on the size of the cup/mug.  I doubt many people put only a tsp (5mls) of milk into a mug of tea. Most mugs are over 300mls now and I would imagine it is closer to a tablespoon (15 mls) at least  Plus, nowadays, if you add milk first, people think you are crazy so, the country has already changed centuries of tradition themselves
You are forgetting that, per capita, Irish people have actually passed the British in tea consumption so, you are about to offend the British AND the Irish. (That ticktok abomination claiming to be tea was sickening and upset me and my ancestors equally 🤢🤮)
Temperature of the water while the bag is in the water is a important axis too
same Stephanie. hot tea warms my soul
I had to switch videos because how often the puns where being used
Tea should be served with no milk •_•
"HE'S A FIREBENDER! I WATCHED HIM HEAT UP HIS TEA!!"
The British are taking as many notes as they can right now               I should know, cause I am taking notes
I'm British get a kettle
I drink tea with sugar honey and and a little bit of creamer
Best type of milk in tea is no milk
British tea should be dumped in the Boston river let the fish have to drink that garbage
Although the brits were getting memed by their tea drinking the turks actually drinks more then the brits and its not small margin
was it the same glass you poured the hot water into multiple times heating it up?
What if you did teabags first instead
the irony of how many humans that don't know about the milk part includeing myself will shock pretty much every brit I bet
The kettle and the microwave are just looking at you shaking their heads. You didn't actually test kettle vs microwave. You just assumed that microwave heating was bad.  NASA is disappointed in you.
It’s probably for the best that Chinese people weren’t mentioned in the tea episode. All you really need to know is that the youngest pours for their seniors in a group setting, and all of the other Chinese people are judging you for drinking tea by yourself like a loser who doesn’t have friends… wait, maybe that’s just me.
I contest the cup/heat factor. On the basis that if you're using the smallest as a measure, the liquid _cools as you pour it into another cup._  I've done this on purpose before -- Drink is too hot but you want it now? Get another mug and pour it back and forth a couple times.
Me seeing ever live video in the kitchen a poster that says the word dad fruit loops  My feeling: oh it is you.Again
Everyone in the ep. is down on the microwaving the water, but they didn’t test microwaving the water vs. boiling in a tea kettle. I’d be curious to see if there’s a taste difference. I’d hypothesize no difference, but I am curious (especially after the milk top vs. bottom surprise).
kermit likes👍👍👍👍
definitively, the only reason the tiktok tea sucked, was because the teabag was put in after the milk was. NOT, the microwave heating
why was it so adorable when matpat got excited
I've always poured my milk on top since I use the colour to gauge how much is enough, glad to know my method now has scientific backing!
My favorite tea was introduced to me by a friend from South Africa. It’s called rooibos tea and it’s SO GOOD
In India We JUST DROP THE TEA WITHOT BAG
That mug inflation is called a wife...
*"But hey, it's just a theory, A FOOD THEORY! Bone apple tea"*
Shame you didn't bring an Asian on for this.
Pretty soon Britain will be known for its localized Masala Chai.
Matpat: with the correct opinion ignored. Me: let me correct you. MILK GOES IN TEA
What you missed: sugar add time, when where and how much sugar to add along the process
i usually forget that my tea is steeping and let it sit for like 15 minutes 💀
Bro why u put milk in tea that’s terrible
And Turkish tea is original no toppings added
I think fancy porcelain cups make the tea taste better because of the overall experience. Otherwise it’s ceramic for me.  I feel bad for the server I had in first class on the Eurostar train who had to watch me put lemon in my milk tea. I was just a young American who loves tea with lemon but wanted to try British milk tea with my full English breakfast. It did curdle a tiny bit but was really delicious. The server had a great poker face and just brought me more tea and lemon. I drank 4 or 5 cups on that trip to Paris.
even for non tea drinkers the way that tiktok girl prepared her tea is shockingly feels strange and wrong lol
For the record I usually don’t burn myself when I microwave my tea, us a little cloth, but my tea cup are a little different so  tea cup doesn’t get as hot as yours.😂😂😂😅😅
Cid from FF7: this is Cid from,  my world to your( cough) where is myMother🤬🤬🤬🤬ing tea!!!!! Show, but seriously I love tea and my new wife, I know that was years ago but whatever I love tea  and I like cussing, and to all the tea snobs I boil my tea, the old fashion way, but sometimes the kettle breaks or stops working, I use the microwave. I really can’t tell the difference, but whatever I love myMother🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 tea. Cid’s wife: Cid I just invented my f🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬dimensional communicator  I’m still worked out the bugs (end of transmission)⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
I like ice tea and hot tea too, Tea drinkers that say, using a microwave to heat up their tea is wrong,stop being Tea snobs. I’ve use the microwave and the tea kettle. There’s no taste difference whatsoever both methods heat up the tea. If you don’t want to use the microwave, don’t. people drink their tea their way if they want to boil it with a kettle , microwave or use the sun to heat it up, that’s their business I drink tea Myway not your way.😮😮😮😏😏😏😏😤😤☠️😤😤😤
This hurts
Hey Matt, if you ever come back to teas, can you look into if the flavor of teas change based on if the tea cup and pot are hot vs cold? I read a book many years ago saying to swirl hot clean water in the pot or tea cup before pouring the water over the tea. I personally can taste a slight difference, and it makes sense to me, but I would love to hear the science behind it and if it's right or wrong. These techniques were from Japan according to the book I read that had been translated into English from a old tea master or something.
Realistically there is no proper right way to make tea. The only bad way is tik toc
BRI ISH PEOPLE
Matpat:what’s the best way to drink tea  Me: *Laughs in 1$ Arizona can*
My problem with pyramid bags is that they are typically plastic vs paper.
You forgot the question of putting tea in cup|pot before water
British style tea oh pssh amateur hour! You want the real studs you gotta go to the source, chai all day every day baby, that’s not just hot water and tea leaves it’s a whole experience, what better way to have tea than they way the originals did it before the colonizers decided to have their “fun” (I mean this all facetiously just trying to have some fun as a chai guzzling Indian, enjoy it however it makes your soul warmest and heart happiest)
Bill cipher teabag is better according to them!
Please do an international version 😍😍😍
I can't help but notice you set the teapot up against the mug without all the correct equipment. You can't set a teapot to brew without a tea cosy. It will affect the temperature and result in a good slap from my Nan for making such a mistake.  Also, anyone who puts the milk first is a psychopath, it's literally how we test for the condition in Britain.  If the tea has been brewed in the pot then it doesn't make any difference because the tea has already been brewed, if you plan to use a bag in a cup then you add water first, let the tea brew and then add the milk.
In Germany we put the tea bag then the water and then 1/2 tea spoons of sugar/honey in the cup/tea pot
Love this video so much, but as someone who primarily drinks herbals and greens, you guys should do a series on different types of tea and the best way to drink them.  I am a tea aficionado pretty much so I would watch the f out of a series like that
tea
The original way Britain used tea was for medical purposes dry. It was a queen from another country who brought it over.
As a European, I am so confused why people are putting milk in their tea…
I'm not sure why you were surprised that putting the milk in first doesn't make a better cup of tea.  I'm also super surprised that Matt burnt his hand on the mug and then screamed "why?"  First time using a microwave? Aren't you the science guy?
As an Assamese, aka someone from Assam, this makes me feel happy lol
This is just offensive even your "true British tea" is wrong get good mattpat
They ask a brit about tea, but you don’t even ask a Turk. Actually offended
Oh you found my secreet method... Sad
milk first was the reason ISO 3103 was disapproved by Ireland
Where is my southern sweet tea
I mean, water heated in the microwave and water heated on a stove has the same flavour, it’s warm water, tea is not that fancy of a drink, British people just want to say they can cook something
Theres actually a part in germany where a kind of tea is a big part of their traditions so its not just a uk thing... its just kinda obscure
Earl grey. HOT!
There is another type of tea mostly made in indian and pakistan.  That tea is made with (if you are making one cup) a cup of milk and half a cup of water in a pan on fire with tea power in it bring up to a boil and simmer for like 5 to 8 mins and pour it into the cup with a strainer on top
YOUR TEA SUCKS ( ANGI FACE HERE ) and my god your not using a bloody microwave
I've never tried tea with milk
ITS TIME TO STOP THE TEA PUNS
use indian tea
Now we need to know if milk actually makes you sleepy
I would love to see a new channel called world theory and him do one about if there are more doors or wheels in the world
why am i seeing tea bags? :S
you lost me when you said "milk". that was pretty fast :p
I never heard of milk in tea until today and I make tea like every two days
Meanwhile me in Brazil, that  never saw someone using milk to make tea: What the f- Anyway, i'm going to make my coffee with milk
"identical mugs" has 3 mugs with 3 different letters, SMH
As a part European, MatPat making TikTok tea gave me *internal pain*
Mate, I don't think I have met or heard of anybody in this country even entertaining the idea of putting milk in first! Milk first may have been a british staple back in the day, but so was imperialism, both of which belong in the past!
square teabag, water, sugar and milk in that order
As a Turkish person I didn't know you put milk (in turkey you put sugar or nothing in the tea)
What about Korean style tea is the real question
yay Matt likes his tea like I do! NO MILK!
Now try the indian tea
Yall did not notice Steff let the editor drink after her
I'm sorry you put milk and water in a cup and DRINK IT? What's wrong with society..
You guys in the states don’t go like fully naked in saunas? Quit bad for your skin actually and the nice relieving experience of going naked and no body really cares.
American teabags like Lipton are made from the leftover dregs of tea processing when getting that sweet sweet loose leaf tea all processed and packaged for our enjoyment.
Guys, Doc brown did it first:  https://youtu.be/Ei46KnXB3BA  HE nailed it
MatPat you are wrong milk tea is actually pretty good regular tea is more strong but milk tea is better in the taste side
My Romanian/Hungarian/German self just knowing that Americans and Brits are gonna be disappointed in how I make tea or how these three nations do them. Basically we just boil the water or microwave it ad a teabag, sugar or honey is optional and we usually don´t ad any milk. :D
a russian grandma would get a heart attack over this tiktok tea (russians love tea)
How many times did MatPat say tea in this episode?
As a Brit I can 100% day that if you put milk in first your seen very different socially like even us Brits don’t like it that way   So milk after is better 100%
And here I am, drinking unsweetened cold tea.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo no no
No milk temperature? Shouldn’t the temperature of the milk somehow make a difference in taste?
bruh my m8 sent me this when i told him im goiñg british mode
Dear animated hand, why have you stuck yourself in hot tea? Sincerely, Me
I needed this
we have the same mugs with the M!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm British, and I've never heard of putting the milk in before the hot water when making tea my entire life, until this video.  Also, none of you are adding sugar?
Stop the tea puns
I don’t like milk in my tea
I was drinking tea when I  was watching this video
I'm rewatching this again except I'm fully paying attention instead of doing other things. The only thing I would want to change from this video is Show Us what's happening in the cup! Especially with comparing the teas (color even) show us the difference rather than describing. I feel that you have shown us the plate or bowl while working in other videos.
yes, but at what temperature should the milk be at?
Try our Darjiling Tea
Missing a variable. Steep or stir
0:27 I mean we have seen the Doki Doki streams Steph loves a good book with tea
man had to dodge knifes to prepare this tea
Try the 'Indian Masala Chai'.
YESSSS SOUTH AFRICAN TEA FOR THE WINN My family’s South African so we drink rooibos and it doesn’t have as much caffeine
as a English person, I have never ever poured milk in first. my family shame those who put milk in first
Im not from the UK but I do make my tea and I will tell ypu how I make my tea 1. I heat up water in a kettle and then I grab my mug I put the packet of tea leaves and I put the hot water in 2. I wait for it to cool 3. I put honey or sugar and mix the tea and drink it I dont put milk Ew LIKE WHAT MILK AND TEA EWWWW (to anyone who likes tea and milk I do not offend you I just do not like it) and im from europe and have a good day everyone
Wait a tic. If 3 minutes  is the optimal steeping time, does that mean we're in the presence of the Holy Cup of Tea of Antioch? 🤣
NECTS LETS MAIK SAOUTH AFRIKAN TEA
I love matpat jumping from being right
My indian tea best
I'm Australian I personally do ketle water tea bag then suger and milk if you want them
NO LOOSE LEAF FOR THE W
I’m only at 4:56 but the answer is this:  Step 1) Yorkshire Tea teabag in cup with a handle big enoughfor all your fingers and part of your  palm (yes Yorkshire Tea is the best tea).   Step 2) Put fresh boiling hot water *FROM THE KETTLE* into the cup and steep the teabag for 3 minutes.   Step 3) Add a splash of milk (enought to make the colour look similar to a Dr Martens shoebox).   Step 4) Remove teabag and add a sweetener if needed.
Milk belonges in tea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:30 when i saw that i was filled with fear 2:57 then this made me start hyperventilating  3:18 then i laughed
Wait... People actually put milk in tea?
Why does it seem like Stefani is a stuck-up wench who looks down on everyone and probably abuses Matpat?... idk something about her seems off.
3-4 WEAK I average 5-6 beat on a bad day normally at least a litre maybe 2 if I'm in the mood but still that's impressive for a non British person. always MILK goes Before Tea
YES ON TOP BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE TEA DOESNT BREW PROBERLY BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE HEAT FOR IT TO BREAK DOWN SHUGAR AND EFFICIENTLY BREW THE TEA LEAVES, THE MILK MAKES IT LESS HOT SO YOU ADD IT AFTER IT HAS SUGAR  AND IS BREWED RIGHT
bro put a uk countryball in his video
i think you guys need to do the same thing with the process of making the perfect coffee and hot chocolate
what about tea without milk
Who else brewed themselves a cup of tea while watching?
British people will be mad at this video!!!!!!                      t67 u83 e37 e5ur4
Milk and 2 sugars please
Very different from my brew method: Microwaved water Flat paper bag No milk Steeped 30-60 minutes because I forgot about it Not only does this method ensure the most tannins, but after about 35 minutes you also get bag taste because the bag itself is cheap and leaches fibers into the tea. (Who doesn't want a thicc tea with your daily recommended fiber in it?)  So yeah, I might try this out, see if "proper" tea is any better than my horrible Bag Juice
Ah validation of me telling my mum she ruins tea when adding milk first
Well I feel vindicated as a brit now for making tea perfectly according to science
i'm with matpat.  milk in tea is an abomination
I'm pretty sure you couldn't tell the difference from microwaving water vs boiling in a kettle.  They had multiple variables change at one time, and that's not the way to do it. Edit: After further review, I think they were saying that because it heats up the mug. I always heat water in a pyrex measuring cup.
Oh matpat >.> you did this for the clickies huh?
As a brit myself. this video hurt my British senses more than our colonies ever would. and I've never heard of milk on bottom.
I'm from the south I boil a pot of tea grab a pitcher and fill it 1/7 to 1/6 full of sugar when tea is about to boil pour in pitcher and stir slowly as you fill rest of pitcher with what're then let sit for how long you feel like it needs to
Well, we Egyptians have been making tea the right way and we don't know. But I agree with Mat that tea should be drunk alone without milk.
i dont drink tea and didnt like the way that microwave tea was made
11:35 that's my initials lol
As Im from europe milk whit tea is our nightmare. WE never and I mean NEVER pour milk into tea
My Cup is steel thermos tho 👀🌸
NGL I pulled this video up so I could make. My tea right lol
What psychopath adds milk to tea???
Bro rlly piling on that British accent - nobody talks like that in the UK (I’d know, I live there)
I love tea
I am agree just wash the cup. Let people make tea way they want. It is cool to learn about British tea. I think guest is great idea. Good work on the video.
First cup of tea testing this out to see if tastes good. Edit:absolutely beautiful
Tbh, even 30mins of googling into Chinese tea methods, would’ve told you all of this. Tea did first come from China; even the Brits’ Assam plantations were from thieving the plant from China. Most of British tea culture was either directly copied from Chinese methods or altered because of facts like the mentioned difficulty of poorer Brits not having porcelain mugs, to over sweetening because they only used boiling water and over steeped for the longest time too
i just boil water and put tea and honey in?
Day 22 of asking mat to explain the lore behind the game granny
So no one actually said WHY you don't heat your water in the microwave. If the goal is just to heat up the water, why does the method matter?   Does it actually change anything? Is it just because the cup gets too hot as well so its harder to grab? Ya can't just act appalled and not say why lol
I’ve NEVER put milk in my tea and I’m perfectly content with that 😅
Best tea I've ever had was unlike anything any of you will ever find. It was at a tea farm in Asia using fresh leaves, nothing dried. I kid you not comparing that to the dried tea you find anywhere else is like comparing a steak to beef jerky
In England we have coffee bags
Funny I love squeezing the tea bag for that exact bitter taste it adds to the tea.
I don’t know why the British are known for tea when they’re virtually the last country to get it  (hyperbole)
Microwaves are the most energy efficient method for boiling water. It's literally what a microwave is designed to do. Go watch Technology Connections.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha very funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mate milk last is the most British way
Sure most brits put milk last it’s the correct way
I wonder if the water temp at start of brewing matters to the tannin extraction. Something like the 80°C to 70°C range being very different to what you get above or below the specified range.
From what I recall you add the tea before the milk so brew tea then pour milk on top not the other way round but u guess both are the same and not the infamous milk teabag water method
13:35   the entire video i've been thinking that you don't put milk in tea, and then he agreed with me. so we can now agree that matpat is always right and anytime his theory has been wrong has been one big mandela effect
MatPat. You need to do an experiment like this with coffee. Different brewing methods, times, additives like cream or milk or whatever. It would be similar to this video but still different enough to be entertaining.
Milk...in your...tea?
i also agree no milk in tea or coffee
remember as put in avatre the last airbender.  were drinking tea leaf juice
The mug definitely has an effect… I’ve always known that a slightly thin a glass mug tastes better…
Do you think that the caffeine had an effect on your opinions? I mean you are getting high…
what garbage science ,  where is the blind taste test ?
not something you included but when I make tea I pour the boiled water over the teabag as it sits in the mug, I also sometimes dunk the teabag in the water up and down to get faster diffusion and a stronger flavor. What are the self-appointed professional's opinions on these methods?
I use to think milk is tea was weird until I tried earl gray with oat milk. A banger for sure.
6:30 NOOOOOOO nononononono. Eliminate all variables? While seeping 3 different teas ? I thought you were better than this 🫣❤️
7:08 I’m getting Deja Vu from 6th grade science class
The British tradition is actually fitting for the old days. You did talk about how pouring in the milk first regulates the temperature to no break the mug. Back in the days,we didn't have this much mugs.
Where is Gongfu brewing?
6:35 this made me laugh way harder than it should've
So I know this isn’t food, movie/tv, game related, but I’d love for you to do the perfect way to do laundry especially if you have a variety of clothing fabrics. My husband and I have been having laundry issues and I realize it’s because most of his laundry is made from cotton and it’s obviously needed to be treated with a special process. I wasn’t taught how to do laundry so I would love to see your process and the science and what it has to say about the way to do laundry.
I love this video 😂
3:39 mul-tea-verse?
My three year old asked my wife yesterday why she was drinking water with leaves…
dam
You needed dawko for a british person.
get off my tea american
Milk does not belong in tea
OSMOSIS
I prefer to put the tea bag in my mouth then pour scolding hot water into my mouth compared to how y’all NORMAL people do it
Milk on top is the British way- this is so wrong!!!!!!!
the only milk in tea I'm drinking is INDIAN chai mixed with bergamot, cinnamon, cloves, and other spices. British "tea" with milk is just BLAND and BASIC. It's literally just milk and tea.... like? How basic can you get? And in some cases pure tea would be better depending on how you prepare it.
The instant that loose leaf lost was the instant I lost interest.
the way I may tea is put in the tea bag and sweetener, boil the kettle and when the kettle is done put in the water and stir it while pouring in milk
Try chai from india with sugar and one without it btw look it up in youtube since it's not like normal british tea and is more like that tea with a lot of milk very little water more milk but when it comes out it is AMAZING!
Nobody talking about how Brits put the milk on top also, it is a Heinous crime to put milk in first
Steph should meet Christine from simply nailogical
And in my family here in the south, we make it by the gallon every couple of days in our Mr. Coffee pot 😂
british "person"
What happens if you steep tea in only milk?
You can't just test one variable at a time and then sequentially move on from the best result.  You have to do the whole matrix because who knows if the worst from other results combines with other ones to make something better
I... I get Matt and Stephanie drinking from the same mugs, but...Tom too?
I drink tea all year round lol.
This is not how indians make tea, indians dont make tea like britishers therefore indian is the orignal one
I don't add milk to tea unless I'm making milk tea, then I use only milk.
Matpat just pissed off England with a single thumbnail
Southerner here tea is meant to be drunk cold from a gallon pitcher with 2 or 3 cups of sugar
As a British person who drinks too much tea, I can say I’ve never seen anyone put the milk in first. It’s news to me that it used to be tradition.
I DRINK TEA MY WHOLE FAMILY DOSE AND IM NOT BRITISH AND WE DONT EVEN MAKE IT LIKE THAT /:
Ask any Indian Bros and sis we know our tea better than brits bcoz it started here
Indian masala chai wih ginger made with less milk and adequate sugar is the best tea possible
Teabag in cup water ontop, PG TIPS ONLY, let it sit then use the bottom of the spoon and squeeze the bag on the inside of the cup then sugar mix take out the bag then the smallest splash of milf
I dunno... if tea originally came from  India, how do Indians make tea.
Ok but is there any food or beverage that  can unclog my nostrils weather I consume or apply said food or beverage if there is someone pls tell me I can barely breath from my nose.
I'm sorry, I'm from the south. We have our own version of tea that I am certain other countries would disagree with (too much sugar or whatever)... Even so WTF was that Crap with the MILK TicToc Lady!?! That is not TEA, even in America that's not right at all. She wasn't brewing tea, she was flavoring milk!
I love how Matt is absolutely geeking out over the milk😂 I can’t wait to have a proper cup tonight
I’m not the only one who went to make some tea right after this right?
Tea is supposed to have milk in it?!
Listen. When you're at work, and there's no stove, sometimes the microwave is the only option.
I personally love strong tea when plain
I have a question, do I get burned at the stake if I put a icecube in my tea to cool it down faster
No one puts the milk in first. You pour the tea for everyone and they add milk to suit themselves.
As a southerner who drinks ice cold sweet tea, it is weird how people drink hot tea, like I have never seen milk in tea.
its so funny to see you steeping for 5 minutes at most, when here in northern germany its customary to easily steep over 7 minutes haha.
MatPat we love you and agree on NO MILK IN TEA from Lithuania
Wait, I've been putting milk in last for ever! What psycho is putting milk in first?!?!? I physically cringed when that woman in the TikTok made that "drink" oh my god it hurt
bro can someone could how much he said tea
no milk in tea i agree
Tea is leaf juice  -Ouro Kronii
I think for the teapot, it cools when getting poured. A smaller exit area means you would lose some of the heat. Like, your breath is warmer when you exhale with an open mouth, but when you exhale with your mouth nearly closed except for a pinhole opening, the breath is cooler.
I drink my tea from a bowl
Funny enough im British  and all my family preferred coffee for so long before cutting more caffeine out the diet, now its just my dad who likes coffee more
Why is the jug of milk so huge?
Steph: drinking 3-4 cups of tea a day Me, a British person: Are you kidding? That is insultingly low.
god said he'd teach me karate.
i like drinking outta soup mugs and i add honey for the added bonus of my throat feeling better, also, when i have the patience like... 5 of those a day, though, everyonce in a while i'll break out the tea set and drink 36-40 oz of tea in a single sitting, cause i just enjoy feeling proper drinking tea from tea cups
🤣 the thumbnail 🤣👍
not a brit but in the nearby country i feel attacked at what you have done..
As a british person, who tf puts the milk in first?? Only if you have brewed tea in a teapot and then add it to the mug with milk in- NOT from a kettle. Cmon guys, lets do better. 😓
i make tea with boiled water mug tea bag and suger u put suger in mug put tea bag then boiled water
as a British person... I always put milk in after
Indians be like : 🍵
What about ceramic cups?
You're meant to put milk in tea?
Sorry but milk in tea is disgusting. Honey and/or sugar only.
I drink 4 to 6 cups of tea a day
What about sugar?
3:10 I am not British but my country was definitely considered a "Little Britain" and I was thoroughly disgusted when I saw this.
Hey so. I'm diagnosed with ADHD, and my uncle, who recently started living with us has expressed his skepticism about my late night tea helping me sleep because it's caffeinated. I couldn't say anything back to him about it because I'm the type who likes to get their facts straight, but I do know that it works. I know multiple people who it works for too and I figured I'd suggest this to food theory because I think it's interesting. I love this video btw. I drink a lot of tea.
I'm still upset I can't find pyramid bags
I still don't understand why people mix milk and tea. It is not a good combination.
So many British people in these comments 😧. I'm just going to stick with my southern sweet tea. I can't stand British tea. Too bitter for me
the tea was such a nice colour
You don't add any milk to tea
Milk in first when it's from a teapot, milk in 2nd when it's a teabag. So both times it's just tea and water for a bit before you add the milk.
No milk in tea!
Hello Mat, a Turk is here and i just dont know why do yall put milk in the tea. It just kinda ruins it (My opinion). I think best way to make tea is to get 2 kettles. Put 1 on the top the leaves go there and at the bottom kettle there is water. When water boils you put the water on the top kettle and put water in the bottom kettle again and wait for both to boil. Then get a teacup and 1/3 should be put from the top and the other ones are water. No milk. 3 teaspoons of sugar (or less) and here you go. Turks perfect tea. By the way no teabag.
When i make tea we have the square teabags and i like shake it a little from the string after it sits for a while idk if that makes a difference but if i can ask anyone its you
Only 3 to 4 cups? British and milk after, can't believe anyone does it before.
15:25 hate the way he shows the UK flag and then says BRITS
14:36 I live beside Ireland and the UK and that tea looks  Ewww
10:50 bruh ever heard of milk
STOP saying Brits  It’s UK  That’s like showing someone the flag you are from (let’s just say Canada) and then saying they are from USA
I personally prefer chamomile herbal teas or personal brewed and dried tea  i have a small garden in my bedroom to grow tea ingredients my mother makes fun of me because of this lol
So, (doubt you'll see this) coffee beans have the same taste difference. I used to work for Nespresso and in my time there made me realize that just the slight change to type of bean, roast, harvest, even climate can make a coffee taste so different. For example, Nespresso came out with a dark roast coffee that the beans were harvested after hurricanes. It gave the coffee some oak rich notes and of course was only sold for a limited time.
when reacting to that video they acted likeGordon Ramsay
What about honey?
okey so i frink tea with honey, no milk. i never had tea with milk. i wanted to try but we didnt have milk at home so i ended up just drinkning tea with honey (i needed it anyways cause i've been coughing way too much lol). but wel after 5 minutes of you guys drinking tea i just NEEDED tea.
meanwhile in china😂
Why are you booing Matpat he's right. Milk does not belong in tea
Me sad herbal tea noises.
I AM TEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the proof right here that - Tea is not just a taste, it is an EXPERIENCE~.
this might just disappear in the sea of comments um when he used the glass mug to measure the water for the other cup he also preheated the cup making the water in it stay hot for longer  also if we are to use triangle tea bags does it only apply for that certain tea leaf size?   i think many have also pinted out the question of what type of milk is best for the type of tea used in the video, and the vegetarian milk choice aswell. the best sweetener
Meanwhile, me using creamer instead of milk-
'she drink 3 to 4 cups a day'me: that a very small number there
I would argue that britian also adopted tea from asia ;P
3-4 cups per day in America good in Britain that's miniscule
Milk is not needed
Matpat creating an entire video about tea My drinking hot water: interesting
What about Chinese Tea?
As someone who makes tea with a tea pot that tiktok hurts me
This episode made me wanna drink tea even though I don't like it.
Turks drink more tea than brits
“Use a kettle” Me with boiling water on tap: “no”
13:35 I AGREE THIS IS THE CORRECT OPINION MATPAT IS LITERALLY ME
Listening to all of these puns are kinda cruel-tea
Nobody freak out on me but I boil my shredded teal leafs then let it steep for 10(ten) minutes pour into a pitcher and add 2 cups of sugar( yes I know it’s a lot)
im w matpat in regards to milk, feels bad you weren't there for that test 😔
This whole video sounds like something out of Big Bang theory
Listen Matt, I'm not brittish but scotland is part of the UK and i gotta say. I've never met a single person across scotland, wales, england or even northern ireland that puts the milk in first
I like milky tea
I always make my tea the same way Patrick Macgoohan does in The Prisoner. Boil the water and pour a little into the pot and swirl it around to warm it and prevent cracking, then pour that water out. Next add 4 scoops of loose leaf tea (one for me, one for thee, one for the pot, and one for luck), fill with boiling water and leave to steep for a few minutes, then serve and add milk and sugar to taste.
If you really want to get into the minutiae of brewing then you need to talk water hardness. A tea brewed with soft water is going to be very different from that brewed of hard water. I have to ask as well, did you brew the milk first tea with water and milk combined before adding the tea bag? If so you’ve changed the most critical factor of brewing which is temperature.
put a teabag in hot milk :)
As a non-british european, adding milk to tea is disgusting.
Can your next game theory be is fallout possible
Every brit I know puts the milk in last
Asia: The “traditional British way is best” lmao
Wouldnt the milk being on top make it taste better on the top with all the milk taste but after drinking a little bit of it all the milk taste goes away
I’m surprised you guys didn’t use the ISO standard for a cup of tea, Tom Scott made a great video on that topic
Hey Mat. Would it be possible to do something similar to this with coffee?
I don’t even drink tea but I even know that the tic tok tea added wayyyyyy to much milk.
Only MatPat will jump with excitement about a difference of tea
I am British & I can say with certainty that British people don't put the milk in first anymore.
Type of milk?
that tiktok woman should never touch a cup again
MatPat: "should you put hot water first or cold milk"  Me: *NO* the milk does not go anywhere near the tea, especially not in it
when i make thee in my thermos i steep for like 3  hours and that doesnt get to strong so
1) as a Texan, we don't put milk in our tea 2) We will stick with making our tea on the stove, in a pot squeezing out the tea bags for all the flavor, adding plenty of sugar to it afterwards  3) We will continue to use Mason jars to drink all beverages from
"4_3 cups a day"  My parents: rookie numbers
me and my mom make jasmine green tea by boiling water and using a tea bag we don't do that milk stuff
Me in Australia: Literally no one ever put the milk first.
Tea originates from China not Britain but okay
In the southern part of America we don't even add milk to our tea. Just BUCKETS of sugar
In the british way now you put the milk on the top I would know
Tea isn't a British tradition. It was actually started by a Portuguese queen who married a British king
If the internet has taught me anything, it's that no one should ever be allowed to just make things the way they individualy enjoy it 🔥😤🔥
The fact that Steph is from North Carolina is drinks tea the British was instead of the Southern American way feels like a betrayal somehow
British people? Turkish people drink more tea.
As a British person, I completely agree on the milk going in after. Everyone I know agrees with that . Most people in England adds the milk after so your theory is correct
Best cup of tea recipe  1.Get a cup 2. Put the teabag and if you want sugar  3.fill kettle and boil  4. Pour the water in the cup 5. Pour the milk in as much as you want my preference is a little bit so it looks golden  6. Stir for 30 seconds 7. Remove tea bag and drink
As a Brit I feel personally attacked by the TikTok tea at the start
Milk first is a bloody crime, milk must go in last,
I am British and I must say HOW DARE YOU SIR. I just tried it, I apologise for my former actions...
When is the best time to add sugar? What type of milk?
What happened to the first cup at 19:03  WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE THAT
Lose tea in the little bobble clasp is actually not that great. It's better to get the ones that sit on the rim and have a cylinder going into the mug & then cover while steeping.
Reading, writeaing*, arithmeteac* and tea
Let’s go! No milk in tea! Unless it’s Taiwanese bubble tea lol
You missed opportunities to appeal to the millennials with references from their childhood! 0:57 "Warm leaf water" Could have made a refence to Uncle Iroh from A:tlA when Zuko says "All tea is hot leaf juice" immediately followed by Iroh saying "How could a member of my own family say something so horrible!?" because like Tom, Iroh is passionate about tea like no one else through years of perfecting.   3:55 Totally missed a chance to have Patrick from SpongeBob or the sponge himself 'shopped in holding up his pinky all "fancy" like.
With the order of the milk, the reason why when you add milk first it taste bitter/sour is because milk actually clumps when temp is over 70*C/ 158*F, meaning it basically spoils, though not in a food poisoning way.
19:36 Kinda wrong here. The glass was the hottest bc you've poured hot water 2 additional times warming it up.  That was also why that "wide" one was coolest: the first portion of water lost most of its heat for warming 2 cups from room temperature
Crediting the British with the teapot hurts my brain cuz the British definitely did not invent the teapot
STOP  MY Tea IS BEST
6:13 Not only Britons
I agree no milk in tea
Steph mixed the tea in the first experiment, so already faked
i dont add milk
LONG LIVE WALES!
TEA! only 3-4 a day though?
Would be cool if you would have tried plant based milk too, but that‘s something I can try on my own then. Other than that, very good video!
If he has been so far this videos terrific
This is nice change of pace from Santa getting heart attacks from eating millions of cookies
COUNTRYBALL YES
The way he said Assam
i really love the DAD poster on your fridge😊😊
In the UK we already pour our milk on top. When Jeremy Corbyn, then leader of the Labour Party (the main left wing party of the UK) was caught adding milk before water it was a scandal and he was widely mocked for it.
20:58 we do put the milk on top genius. NO SUGAR!!!!
0:09 And when life hand you both, you make an Arnold Palmer?
This is the most British thing I’ve ever seen
I only drink iced tea so I can’t really speak on this 🥲
What type of milk though
Imagine acting like the Brits are the kings of tea when they basically stole it and have no idea how to actually make tea  Also milk in tea is disgusting. The most that belongs in tea is honey
MatPat: **pours milk in way that TikTok showed** Tom: **cries in British**
To me, a proud Iranian (not the ones who support the dictators) north Iranian tea is the best tea, which is without milk. I am an under 18yo child who probably drinks 3 or 4 cups of Gilan tea every day, by average, and i LOVE it. No offence to the milk tea lovers, i'm just not familier enough with tea outside Iran.
Who’s gonna tell him it’s a crime to put the milk in first in England  Reference Doc Brown: My Proper Tea
What sweetener to use?
Matpat I recommend you to make a tea in Indian style. Well masala chai Steph will love it.
I’m British but I don’t drink 3-4 a day like WOW
for the type of tea cups the taste would differ if made in a take a way cup
Tom Got his UK Citizenship revoked
No BC what about milk colour?
well isnt it common knowledge too that the amount of milk in tea combined with the milk on top or bottom affects the taste as well mabey thats the reason a lot of people put a splash of milk because they put to milk first in and the taste getsmore intens of the milk
Hot leaf juice
Hot leaf juice
Us Iranians who just pour water in a samovar. heat it up until it boils and put a teapot above it with any kind of tea variations plus u can add most kind of tea for it to tase better and smell better for around 10-30 minutes. then we just pour the boiled water and the tea and done. It's pretty tasty and if one doesn't like it bitter they can drop some sugarcubes or a rock candy (crystal candy.. idk) and It becomes SOOOOO tasty that u can't imagine.
Now That's The Definition Of "Milk Tea"
Mat, I don't know how to tell you this but the culture shifted to pouring the milk on top many years ago. You may have outsmarted the British, but they outsmarted your outsmarting.
this feels like a dora the explorer episode. They keep repeating the exact same thing, while taking turns, to teach me a lesson
Punz!
Loose leaf is superior and I will not be taking criticism
you're not alone matpat  I don't like milk in tea either lol  I only drink fruit teas though (blueberry is my favorite) so maybe that has something to do with it idk
They never asked about the type of milk
Well now I’m craving for some tea 😆
the mom reflexes on Steph to get her hand under something she knew would spill right into it were honestly impressive
idk why live action matpat and 2d matpat feel like totally different people even tho they're the sam but i like that so much
I love bitter tea
The best tea is tetley tea
My cousin is the onyl one I've ever met who makes tea with milk first and it is something my family jokingly bully them for, I also refuse to let her make my tea cause its so bad, its always too milky and really bitter 😭😭
2 things 1 Ireland drinks more tea than England per year 2 if  u were ever putting milk first in any Irish house hold you would be getting the spoon in fact that is such a crime u might get a metal ladle in fact id whip myself
0:30 as a British citizen, my mum drinks over seven cups a day
It's a thing .. their is a group in England who's souls purpose is to know everything about tea .. jest like in Germany theirs a Beer group and the USA has ice cream... What a world.
Well I take it back ya ruined tea,thanks 😒
WHAT could YOU do to tea?
Your videos always manage to get me interested on the most stupid things. You could make a video about dog droppings and I’d still watch
Ok listen, when we say tea, it means DINNER. so when we say "Do you want to come over for tea" we mean dinner. Coming over for tea is coming over for a cuppa. So we don't like tea as much as you believe, however it is still popular.
4:56 I have the same mug
Just to bother people, I make southern tea, I use a coffee maker, run water through first, then run with 3 tea bags, then 1 cup and a 1/2 of sugar, no milk.
I steep my tea for hours. I love it strong
As a british person i do not like tea
No one touches the tea unless your British
This whole thing was weirdly horrifying in a way I cannot explain as an avid tea drinker. It was like watching a train wreck in action and I loved every second and will absolutely NOT be making my tea like this XD (also you can boil water in the microwave the only recommendation is do it in a mason jar because the glass doesn't retain the taste of anything really and also know your water type will make a difference in taste)
Steph and Tom reacts to TikTok noooooooo!       Matt 😐
every person I know in the UK puts milk in last.
Tom: “Why am I here”
The problem is, only one of the flavour I like come in pyramid bags. There used to be another but it's disappeared from our stories in any form. :(
Been using superior methods all along 😁 I steep for eight minutes though in a teapot that is over a quart so I think the amount of water makes a difference too
Stop with the TEA puns
Iroh: This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice! Zuko: Uncle, that's what all tea is. Iroh: How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?
As a tea drinker, this is actually the first time I’ve applied a food theory to my real life. Thanks MatPat!!
What time do i add my milk
1:41 Hey, that's my title 👑       (Edit: Also 'fermenting' oneself doesn't sound healthy...)
5:13 i'll do you one better "perhaps tiktok should stick to the verbal tea NOT the herbal tea"
you're telling me people put milk in their tea?
You missed the loose sugar vs sugar cube debate lol
Gotta say, as someone who grew up in the south where sweet tea is a staple and has also drank Chinese-styled green tea, I have to agree with Matt. Milk does not belong in tea.
Man did I just watch a WHOLE episode to learn, that absolutely everything I do was already absolutely correct??
But what about hot water temperature?!?! Water that's at a rolling boil,  just under boiling temperature, a specific temp at specific altitudes...  This has always been my biggest tea and coffee anxietea causing question.
The best way to make your tea is to dress up as a Native American and dump the tea leaves into the harbor of Boston Massachusetts.
im genuinely rlly happy for the "no milk in tea" community be represented by matts opinion abt milk in tea   why am i happy? well let me tell you why  im the community.
Finally. Food TEAory
i watched this while drinking tea
Put the avocado in a resealable bag, covered in a wet towel it will probably sprout better😊 it worked for me
so many tea puns
Without milk is the way to go.
Now they just need to do coffee
Am I the only brit felling like this is aimed at us and mad and a bit attacked.  THIS IS HOW I MAKE TEA: STEP 1: BOIL THE KETTLE STEP 2: PUT THE TEA BAG IN TO THE CUP OF WHOEVER IS HAVING TEA STEP 3:  PUT THE WATER IN THE CUP AND SQEEZE THE TEA BAG AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CUP STEP 4: ADD MILK THEN MIX IT IN STEP 5:GET THE BISCUITS STEP 6: ENJOY
What about the sugar
i use 1 cup x time
I am genuinely drinking a cup of ice tea I just made while watching this.
mom: what you get there me: a edution video
Made a tea after watching this and it turned out well
good thing they didnt add weird stuff ...personly once i added a a raw egg ...wait that a coffie... 😂 i know iknow thats waaay offf
0:24 *or British
13:38 W Matt.
Is it bad that I use a Keurig machine to make my tea?
This is wrong, I'm unsubscribing.
I dont make tea with milk I just heat up a cup of water take a tea bag and dip it in the water a few times and then im done making tea
In India we skip the water altogether and just boil tea in whole milk, and add a ton of spices and sugar into it.
You Americans and brits dont know how to make actual tea
When you realize you've been drinking tea incorrectly 🗿
That's because its rum
I'm from the South. All I have to worry about is if there's enough sugar in my cold tea to put someone into a diabetic coma 🤣
Me, a person who dislikes tea, watching this: interesting
I drank water after my tea, my brain is sad now
<>
There's literally no advantage to bringing water to a boil in a kettle vs. the microwave. People who have some weird phobia or snobby reaction at the microwave should get educated because they clearly have no idea how a microwave actually works.
Milk only goes in first if you make a pot.  There are songs about not putting the milk in first. RESEARCH MATPAT! RESEARCH!
Why no microwave? They didn't check that one
I’m very happy to find out I’ve been making tea almost perfectly my whole life already😂
No mention of Indians in tea culture... Ah yes british have appropriated tea too far
why is it alll milk??? :(
me as a turk "wtf u guys put milk????"
Bro i drink 3-5 mugs a day and i always use a Sports Direct mug as well (Any Brits here will get this)
no sugar lol
... I'm not a tea drinker but what about other types of milk, is that just sacrilegious?
rooibos
ever heard of chai bro. you drink it once and you'll get addicted
i never use milk or sugar in tea.
Food Theory: How to make the perfect cup of british tea. Me who almost exclusively drinks chinese, japanese, and korean tea: I have no idea what to do with this information.
I am really interested in this done with green teas.👀 Honey vs sugar vs non-sugar sweeteners.
I'm not British and I drink 1 cup of tea a week and I don't even use milk
*continues to sip chai*
No I mean at least in Scotland we put the milk in last and condemn anyone who doesn't?
There were 8 tea puns in this video, 1 from Steph, 1 from Thomas, and 6 from Mat. I also want to mention that all 8 were in the first 3 minutes of the video
I am British
Türkiye'🇹🇷s tea consuptio🇹🇷n is dub🇹🇷ble amo🇹🇷nunt o🇹🇷f UK's t🇹🇷ea c🇹🇷onsuption. (I have🇹🇷 a per🇹🇷fect englis🇹🇷h as u c🇹🇷an see)
Umm... what bout the temperature of the water?
hi
i agree with matpat best milk in tea is no milk
When America out-teas The U.K.
"Only steep for 3 minutes"  Meanwhile the box I buy says 5 mins, and I do 7+ because anything less is dull. Bear in mind, I also love dark chocolate so maybe I just like bitterness.
I just want to say loose leaf is better than pyramid imo... but for those round ball infuser you have to be careful about the amount of loose leaf you put in there.  The result of pyramid shaped tea bag tastes better is because of the room it has for the leaves to move around is larger than the room you leave for the loose leaf in your ball infuser in this episode.
Whet life gives you lemons, you add lemon yo your tea, silly.
alright, here is how you properly make tea (im british)  step 1: get a mug step 2: put water in a kettle and boil step 3: get a tea bag and put it in the mug step 4: pour the boiled water into the mug step 5: get milk and pour in around 10ml of milk ( you can decide idk) step 6: get some sugar out and put in two teaspoons of sugar step 7: stir for around 10 - 15s step 8: take the tea bag out and now you have tea! it should be a light browinish colour
Wrong am English even i know putting in milk slows almost stops the in fusion of tea in to the water ..milk last
Me a british person drinking tea while whatching this video🫣
Fun fact: Country that drinks the most tea is actually Turkey :)
am I the only one who likes listening to other people's problems?
before finishing the video, I'm just going to say that I like my tea cold brewed.  Tastes the best to me that way :D
Interestingly, you ignored the idea of using filtered water ra than tap.  I always use filtered.
Tom is tryna steal his girl
But Mat, what MILK is the best in tea? Cow… almond… 2%??
Milk is so weird in tea. So weird. How much milk should you be putting in your tea? None...zero...nodda...no milk.
Please do a sequel with types of milk, different sweeteners, and what temperature to steep
as a texan, the lack of sweet iced tea offends my sensibilities, but my southern hospitality urges me to meerly say bless yalls hearts
You put the teabag and the sugar in first. Then add hot water. After add some milk and squeeze the teabag and take it out. That’s a perfect tea without the science. Coming from a Brit
4:06
Mmmm, leaf water. My favorite drink! :)
The best way of preparing tea is the Indian way 😌
My mother goes throu 5 Liter Tea if not more per day
should have used our turkish tea cups https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Turkish_tea2.jpg/800px-Turkish_tea2.jpg
But what kind of milk did y’all use? Everyone has their preference but which one tastes best in tea? Skim, 1%, 2%, whole, almond, half and half, heavy cream?!? I need answers
You better thank the Portuguese for bringing tea to all of you! We love it here too
Milk undermines all the benefits of drinking tea, so maybe don't put any in at all?
I think I'm starting to notice too much but did anyone else notice the mistake at 3:56 where they show the UK but also include the Republic of Ireland as if it's part of the UK, it's not something to do with showing the full areas either because other countries such as India didn't include Bangladesh or another neighbouring country. Yeah I definitely notice things way too much
in canada we do it the british way.
What about the type of milk?! Does that change it significantly or not??
Sometimes I use the microwave for my tea just because I'm too lazy to get the kettle out.
I am similar to Steph, but also weirder. I will use bags if I can, make multiple cups a day 2-5. I reuse the same cup for the whole day, because I like my tea bitter, and I do sometimes squeeze them
Fun fact: A lot of lolitas (style most popular in Japan) have tea time with other lolitas to show off their outfits and meet people that share their style. Tea time.
Milk isn’t good in tea, it’s best when removed
As a tea drinker who has dairy sensitivity, I'm about to horrify Tom and Steph. I don't add milk to my tea. But I do sweeten it with just a touch (about 5 ml) of honey.
As a Asian I am horrified at the concept of adding milk to tea
People like different amounts of sugar/milk/creamer etc. Only pretentious people will tell you that the way you like your food or beverage is wrong.
Learning about water potential and all that was a pain in the rear for me
the trick is to get the bag to float as the water pours onto it, nothing else in the cup. You will get the perfect colour coming thru before even stirring
Real talk, British people have no room to talk about how other people make tea. They didn’t invent it.
Cold brew tea is the best if you hate bitter tea.
Why hide the flavor of tea. No milk no sugar. Same for coffee
I do 10 cups a day
You forgot about what kind of milk you’re using
No one: Me watching this as a British tea drinker : What the heck it TikTok doing I must get my tea cup and show them how it’s done
TRUE, No milk is the correct answer. Milk in tea just makes it taste like I'm drinking milk not tea
4:20 What about ginger? What about Ginger my people!
man, I love how cool you are with Steph and Tom flirting. Great vid by the way!
OI!!!!!
Sad they didn't include gong fu tea brewing. It's the traditional Chinese way and in my opinion the best method, no milk or sugar needed.
jag svätar fett mycket
As a brit we been adding milk on top for a while
I'm British and we put milk in last... milk in first sounds foreign to me
I agree with MatPat about the no milk in tea. I grew up with tea drinking parents (in my country coffee is the more traditional choice) and they don't use milk, which means from a young age I stopped as well and I haven't used milk since. And I love tea!
Matpat already forget the math: 1/4 is 60, 48 is 1/5
should probably just stick to the fnaf tea,ories
i would like to see the different types of milk used, like is using evaporated and condense milk socially acceptable in the UK ? :0
Me just sat here confused by them thinking Tea has a flavour.
What about iced tea? I know the British love hot tea, but living in a 100+ degree heat only way to enjoy tea is iced here.
If you want actual good tea get a gaiwan
As an Irish person in a nation that basically adopted most British things and upended them, you could have just asked us and we would have told you milk on top - we all do that here! The real question is do you leave the teabag in when you pour the milk or take it out before you pour it 🤔
I found in the accrapalisc of 4 square acars of the universe that it’s impossible to create the perfect cup of tea
48MLS!!!!!!!! NEVER TRUST AMERICANS WITH TEA☕☕🍵☕🍵🍵🍵🫖
Science cannot determine the true nature of the glorious bronze liquid that runs through my veins. TEA
I think I might unsubscribe I hated the 'Tik Tok tea' moment and I'm just dying
3-4 a day I'm a 12 year old Brit and on weekends I go through up to 3-4 POTS of tea daily. Amateurs
im sorry i do heat my water in the microwave thats just cuz we dont have a kettle.... im sorry xD, i usually heat it for 3 mins in the microwave, i steep 2-3 teabags for 3-4 mins depentent on the tea type, then put it over ice ( i like iced tea not hot tea very much unless its cold or im sick ) and if its like an all spice tea like chai or bengal spice, ill add 20 ml of milk
When I make a milk tea, the milk _NEVER EVEN TOUCHES_ the tea water until _AFTER_ the tea has steeped to help the cool the water down (I hate drinking tea hot enough to peel the roof of my mouth off a la Happy Tree Friends).  Otherwise, the ice-cold milk will make the water too cold to effectively steep the tea leaves to perfection.
We don't need no statistics, us Brits have been raised knowing the correct way, the perfect timing, the perfect brands, the perfect steeping. No science or tests required. A Brit is always correct.
Hey Mat, I don't know if anyone else has said this in the comments because I don't have time to read the comments. Anyways, what about different kinds of milk for tea? whole milk vs skim vs 2% vs almond vs soy etc... maybe try that?
But INDIAN Tea ☕ is the best
40 seconds in and my immediate thougths are 'only in winter?' and 'wait  she only drinks 3-4 cups?' American tea game is weak!
Not sure how microwaved water was thrown out since that variable wasn't tested
Did he just say such a British thing to say
Yes, indeed, China has nothing to do with tea, as if Japan founded anything special. Of course, why mention the true origin of tea XDD
My family makes green leaf tea than adds lemon and honey it pretty good n its Mexican
You make tea with milk
The British is gonna start a new war
i love tea
anyone else that doesn't put milk in their tea
Or you could do it the Mexican way. Get fresh tea leaves, let them dry in the sun for days, and then boil in the teapot.
I do with the proper way and I’m not British at all so this is just a meme not actually that real
What about sugar?
Uh, I'm pretty sure the traditional American brewed British tea involves a harbor and a revolution. Just pointing out how you can never trust TikTok ever.
Whomever edited this video. I would like to thank you for doing gods work. It is gold
6:35 as a residential Bostonian i agree
oh man, the extra puns actually made me turn the video off. you guys have to try being less dorky please
What about cream and sugar?
531
I drink green tea most of the time so this dosent affect me
Omg I'm so glad I'm not the only one who takes tea this seriously
how much zucker?
why no microwaywing wather?
A bit disappointing that it was brought up an international perspective was desired to determine the best way to prepare tea. And proceeded to only invite someone who was British for the video...
I live in south Africa and our tea rooi bos tea is delouse I've had British tea and jappeness tea but rooi bos won in my opinion
But what about temperature of the hot water?🥺
Me, looking at my Nepali neighbour, who is casually boiling his ceylon tea in milk.   *Ahh, poor MatPat, you know nothing*
Heh a Tea video
Well, Americans don't care what England thinks, and that's why we left them in the first place. I said it. How I make tea: pour it out and make coffee.
Am I the only that NEVER, EVER, puts milk in my tea? Never tried it. I will say my family likes to add 2 gallons of sugar to make 1 gallon of tea. (a bit exaggerated but you get the just.)
I agree with matpat. I next to never put milk in my tea
But what if you were using powered milk?
Mat pat super Mario jumping when there’s a difference 😂😂❤
hey matt, i'm also one of the people who prefer no milk in my tea!
You know nothing, westerners.
Now, when do you put the teabag in? Before the water, before the milk, or after the milk? My mom insists on putting the teabag in first but I put it in after the water & before the milk
i didnt even know people put milk in tea. i feel so american rn
MATT!  You sir have forgotten to do the final and most crucial step.... The sugar, honey, milk type and or sweetener!     As a British  person I feel that you might need to add this step Edit: Thanks For all the likes you are all awesome 🌸🦋✨🌟👑💐( this is the most I’ve ever gotten)
As a Brit I can confirm that this was alright innit mayte
My 10yr old daughter, British or how people think we say, Bri’ish. She was hurt and correcting how to make tea. She kept saying “Pu’ ma Bri’ish wa’er in ma Bri’ish cup.” 😂
Thing is, as a Brit from Wales, I've never seen anyone pour milk then water. Water first is usually the norm so the British way still is the best!
Lol been doing milk on top forever.
Matpat: This channel is built on the premise that I can overthink anything and then write it off as a business! Me: Wait... these videos are not just the random thoughts that pop into his head, he spends time doing this, I thought he was just smart! I've been manipulated  🤣
14:39 same oppinion i have tea with milk
The Brits be here talking about how they drink liters of tea. Meanwhile, I'm laughing up a storm because Americans-particularly in the Southern US drink *gallons* (over two liters each) of sweet tea and then kombucha (fermented tea) is pretty popular itself.
I don't think I've ever met a British person that puts milk in first. It's just wrong. It's like putting milk before cereal.
but tea isn't British its Chinese......
STAY AWAY FROM MAH TEA
what about Indo-Pak tea or chai
Is it just me and most of my country that use lemon juice instead of milk( no we don't put the same amount of lemon juice as milk, we put in definitely less)
I drink my tea from the microwave, little flat bags, without milk. I just want the British burn. :D
In South Afrika there's a recipe: 2-3teaS of brown Suger 1 teabag Then warm water Then milk(unnecessary)
I always but the milk first and then a 2 spoons of sugar☕
Did you know that a healthy amount of tea for weight loss or just betterment of your body is 3-5 cups a day? Assuming you're drinking anything similar to earl gray that is.
ya all stay away from my Indian chai
Dude! Matt what about china
British people: *loads shotgun* "I just want to to talk to him."
Honestly, having getting to see more of the team (Tom in this one) is kinda nice, could we see more of Tom? He's hilarious and y'all's energy mixes well
Iroh is very very proud.
Missed checking the correct temperature at which to steep the tea. It's important - as the different chemicals that make up the flavour and aroma of tea (there are 7-800 of them) are released differently, depending on temperature (and steeping time - which they did look at). The higher the temperature (and the longer the steeping time) the more likely you are to get the bitter tasting tannins. Rather than using boiling water, you should use water at 90-95oC.
i never knew you put milk in tea...
my mom went on a angry rant cause of the tea preparation so Matt pat watch out
Thank-you for the checklist at the end!
I’m 24 and love tea, but I have never ever heard of putting milk in tea
Mathew come on you live in the south iced tea
Wait you guys put milk in your tea? I've just been drinking lemon, or spearmint tea with only water, and a spoon of honey. No caffeine, no added sugar.
2:52 no no no no no no no this should be wiped from the universe  There is: to much milk  They used the MICROWAVE  How dare you do this
My british friends are raging about this video. Britian now hates you.
as a British person I am angry
Brits look down on american tea and Turks look down on british tea   As a turk i recoiled when i saw MILK
yo who heard the breathing the backround?😰😰
First up, tea bags - including the pyramid ones are industrial products - full of heavy metals and pesticides. And, in the paper bags, BPA. Cancer on a string.  Second, tea culture comes from China, India and Japan, not the UK. If you actually want to learn to brew real tea, you're going to have to go get a gaiwan and learn Gong Fu.  Compared with all the western methods you guys were using in this video, it's as if you've never even tasted tea before.  Here's the basics: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lNO_v8L2vI4
rooi bos is the best tea and those who disagree are ankle biters
Wait- pardon? Did you straight up dump loose tea into a tea pot? Do people do this? I always steeped it in the pot using a diffuser so I didn't end up with chunky tea. I always thought the point of the pot is more to be a serving vessel that kinda holds its own flavours like cast iron does.
🚬😮💨 i remember when Matt was correct. It’s been a bad few weeks
Food Theory: Your Coffee SUCKS
A splash of milk in your tea is acceptable only on the outside of the cup.
Doc Brown explains the best  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei46KnXB3BA
Oof nope. Keep that milk and sugar out of my tea!
Ah dither! You blasphemous delinquents did not even brew your tea with the lovely Yorkshire Tea!  I'm afraid fisticuffs will have to be layed down upon you, for such devious acts are not tolerated!
BTW most American teas are artificially flavoured
They're more ways to steep than just in a cup and in a teapot. Now this is my family was sweet tea but we make our tea in the coffee maker
You forgot the best kind of tea sweet tea
I don't know anyone who still puts the milk in first
Best tea bag? My parents: no tea bag, just tea leaves
im british, i have never put the milk in first. i hate it! also, i use about the 26.5ml in my tea and also 2 sweetners.
As a southerner, this video is a bit of a mini culture shock lol
Could you do this kind of video but with coffee?🤩
Mat as a British person I can say what I do for tea I grab my kettle and put the water in grab the tea bag that is not flat it loose leaf pour the steaming water in any then pour milk So yea I guess I kinda did this already just with a different brand obviously
Every time i see some tea video i get exited and then i remember that you monsters drink tea with milk
Ok so this is probably the most American thing I’ll ever say but… y’all put milk in tea? I just dunk the bag into some hot water with a bit of sugar and call it a day. Don’t blame me, blame my mom for teaching me that way
As an American who used to live in England... that tiktok American needs to quit tiktok.   Also, there are circular tea bags!! Can often be found with red teas. They act very similar to flat square bags though. But you can push a corner of a square bag in to give it pyramidal traits.  Needs to be some Yorkshire Gold! Every now and then I'll branch off and drink a different tea, or lion's mane mushroom coffee. And can't forget my kombucha (cold spicy tea?). But one thing I drink every day is kratom tea. Leave my leaf juice alone!
When they said get dunked on old school country, science. I immediately thought the M and S on the mugs meant MY Science.
And who puts milk in tea weirdos
Iced tea is best
me who just drinks chocolate milk: fucking useless
Tea is my favorite drink, not supposed to have it though 🙃
gvhj
Tea-rrific episode... except for all the puns!  Just kidding!! This is my favorite of the year, and I always love watching both Mat and Steph... Merry Xmas and a happy new year with plenty of more food and theories!!!
They are bashing the microwave with only testing it with the tiktok tea. And Mattpat claims that they are being scientific. XD
What about sugar?  When do you put it in and how much?  Does it matter?
put the loose leafs in the teapot and steep for ten minutes with a tea cosy then strain whilst pouring into the mug :)
I was expecting an uncle iroh meme, at least once
Ok put tea bag in cup pour hot water then pour milk
I watched drinking tea
but… how much water do you use
This is next to the best video I've seen from you. The first being when I subscribed.❤️
I don’t mind strong bitter tea, but I agree for the most part; although I usually drink it with no milk or sugar. I know very Asian esk
3-4 cups of fake tea a day.nah nah nah ,that is noob tea drinking habits.to really get the heart fizzing you have to drink atleast 8-9 cups of Yorkshire or pg tips
I love how the mugs at the start are M and S for mat and Steph lmao
Milk takes away from the flavor, honey enhances the flavor.
This might seem like a hot take but boiling your water in the microwave is perfectly fine.  It might feel wrong, but there is no difference between microwave-boiled water and kettle-boiled water _except efficiency._  Boiling the water in the microwave is actually very energy efficient, it uses nearly half the energy of boiling the same amount water in a kettle on the stove and nearly a quarter compared to some gas stovetops.
To anyone who criticises tea and says coffee is better because it's not leaf water  Coffee is been water
Best answer: Just don't add milk, it's gross. Add a bit of honey instead, it's legit great.
You know you screwed up your tea preparation when a non tea-drinker finds your concoction revolting 🫠
Perfect cup of tea microwave water  in the biggest mug u can use add 2 spoons of honey and you let that bag sit in there till your done drinking it and then use that same bag for the second cup.
No milk just honey.
Interesting to see if you mention the bsa (the British standards agency) has a ebook that details the official process on brewing tea. That they sell for like 50 pound or something
best tea is just tea no milk at all
So many tea puns
I wanted to learn the optimum southern sweet tea not this disgrace :c
Take a sip every time they say  "wow"
*Step away from my leafy soup and no one gets hurt!*
This is literally Turkish war except milk 😄
milk always goes in last XD even i look at people who do milk first as a British person and think they re weird XD
Why not heat up water in the microwave?
We Brits may be divided on literally everything. But the one thing that unites us all is not putting our tea in the microwave.  You pompous yanks
Matpat was barred from the UK after this video
Thank you Matt for saying MILK DOES NOT BELONG IN TEA! Call me crazy. (Please don't say I'm wrong beaucuse I'm not. (Thank you.))
I really don't like how they talk about how to heat the water when what they tested was putting the water in a teapot or a mug. They really make it sound like if they thought something like "oh, none of those artificial microwave heat particles, natural organic heat tastes better".  Cool video, I learned a lot, if tea tasted any good I would find it useful.
Sort of an update about water. Some of the alkaline water (Essentia and Body Armor) are chemically altered to make the pH seem like they are at around 9, and when you drink them, the stomach acid will make the water acidic.  There is also the required oxidant-reduction potential or orp where if the scale is at the minus, the drink is antioxidant to help prevent cell damage, allowing you to heal the scab marks, and prevent both wrinkles and cancer.
Wait, you guys put milk in your tea? Maybe I should try that. All I do is brew my tea and chill it with ice (I hate drinking hot drinks) and enjoy a cup of iced tea with no sugar. I have never put milk or sugar in my tea. I also am not a big fan of strong tea cause it tastes too bitter for me.
People put… *milk* .. in their tea…???
4:50 to 5:00 - #LOL
...Milk? In tea??
Yes, but what about putting sugar in it?
Personally, I prefer to brew mine in the Kerug.
Erm, the milk thing where you did milk first vs milk second, the milk first in britan is only if your using a teapot and you missed testing that version out, as you already noted the tea from a teapot is cooler than a tea brewed in a cup and that is a variable you failed to account for tut tut.
13:30 matpar spitting facts
Britain here, we do NOT put the milk in first and we collectively take great offense to the accusation!  Also, it's unclear from the video at which point the teabag goes in during that phase? Milk before teabag stunts the brewing process drastically.
I think the pyramid teabags are wrongly named, they don't have a square base but only regular triangular surfaces and are therefore tetrahedrons and not pyramids.  I could imagine that some children in geometry class who accidentally swapped the shapes because of these bags.
This caused me to put milk in my tea for the first time. I didn't really love it, but i liked what the milk added. The only downside is i used sugar, when i normally use honey. Im sorry anyone in britan.
2:18 why did they photoshop such a tired picture of him? the original photo does not look this sad! who did this to my manpat?
At least there's Twinings in the kitchen. If I'd have seen a shred of Lipton I'd have trashed the internet.
British milk tea is not tea; it's a milkshake.
Matt:Steph drinks 3-4 mugs a day.  Every british tea lover: ha ha, miniscule..
I'm irish and that woman on tiktok must be arrested
I just imagined the British having a entire science branch just to study tea.
but what is the best type of milk tho??
I’ve been making my tea this way for the past few days and it’s insane how much better it is. I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to squeeze the bag after 😬 you guys are doing the lords work
first you ruin my childhood, then you ruin the next generation's childhood, and now you're ruining my tea?
here you all are steeping your tea like proper people for jsut a couple minuets, while i am over here leaving my tea bags in my hot water thermos for up to 3-5 hours...idk what you all are complaining about, it tastes better to me, but maybe im a mutant???
Bro was wearing pilgrim shoes 😂 at 7:02
TEA HAS MILK IN IT?? SINCE WHEN??? WHAT??? I NEVER EVER SEEN THAT EVER UNTIL NOW??????????????????!?!?&:$3833!38:!:&& (context: am Mexican American ig? And I don't care for gea unless my stommy hurt, but also in media I've never seen people ever use milk wtff)
The real question is did matpat lose nnn
My favorite tea is Arizona ice tea.
Green tea next pls
Lose the oportunity to put sTEAmed
BRITISH TEA FTW  note: the GOOD british tea is milk on top and brewed for 2.5mins in a tea pot but in a mug done for 1.5mins ._. i drink to much tea
This is going to make me sick
🚫milk🚫
I don't know anyone who puts the milk in first even in teapots as the milk is usually in the small jug. Milk usually goes in last so you can nab everyone who wants a brew and let them judge by the colour how milky they want it
Watching this makes me want the unedited live action clips of Mat and Steph in the kitchen for all of Food Theory
You dont make lemonade, instead you take the lemons *back,* like bro who needs lemonade? ILL MAKE CUMBUSTABLE LEMONS AND BLOW THE GUYS HOUSE DOWN WITH THE LEMONS THEY GAVE ME.                      *(Portal 2 reference)*
The Kenyan way is the right way 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
It has begun the great war between the caffeine drinkers: Tea Vs. Coffee Vs. Energy Drink Vs. Soda
I can just picture all the Asians watching collectively cringing at everything they're seeing.
If you steeped the tea in the mug during the milk before vs after experiment, the difference is likely from the boiling water cooking the milk in the "before" cup, making it taste off. It likely wouldn't make a difference if you steeped the tea in a teapot instead, then poured it into a cup with milk at the bottom.
6:47 I don't know whether it was a good idea to brew them for the same amount of time. Loose tea has a very different leaf shape and powdery-ness than the bag and pyramid one. I could imagine that there should also be different brewing times, similarly to how espresso is different from filter coffee.
Try Indian tea
What about Indian tea.😅 Masala tea to be precise.
Who puts the milk in first then tea?? Ok I thought everyone made tea the “right” way… I’ve personally never seen the opposite way
What Brit pours the milk first tho? Matpat is straight up lying about that lol All brits, and I mean ALL put the milk after the tea is brewed
wait what about heating milk then putting the tea bag in the milk then having cold water (joke)
My man forgot about cave Jonson we make weapons out of em then throw them at life.come on Matt you missed the perfect opportunity on that one!naw but really I like him and the Chanel’s good work.
Hey matpat did you know they make tea advent calendars instead of chocolate just a idea for ya but get one for steph it has 25 tea bags a different kind every day and you can get a mystery one where you dont know the tea untill you make it it recognize the scent all bags are individually wrapped and unmarked
I'm British and i was always taught to put the milk in last! It makes a huge difference to the taste!
oh OH MY GOOD GOD! that mini vid of that woman making tea that way triggerd me so hard I nealy lost my right arm and right lung!
Loving the cuphead reference 6:11
I love how they made a tea video 21 minutes
What about Japanese green tea? My Japanese heritage demands an answer
Is anyone else wondering why there is an “A” mug? They bring out “M”, “A”, and “S” mugs. “M” and “S” are probably for Matthew and Stephanie, but where the heck does the “A” come in? 😅
Growing up, my parents would only make tea when we were sick with a cold or flu. They'd make Mormon tea (aka Brigham tea or Navajo tea) by putting some of the sticks in a pot of water (the plant has no leaves; look up images for "Mormon tea plant" if you are curious) and then would boil them in the water. Once the water turned a darker color, they'd put some of the tea in a cup (filtering out the sticks of course) and put honey in it. That drink is a miracle worker for colds and flus. Since you can't buy it in stores, we've had to harvest it ourselves. After I moved out, I couldn't go harvest it myself so I turned to elderberry and hibiscus tea to help boost my immune system. I made it almost the same way my parents made Mormon tea growing up, except I'd boil water in an electric kettle then pour that into my cup with the tea bag in it. I just made it this scientifically determined best way. I never saw myself as a tea person, but now I think I'm addicted.
are they- are they drinking from the same cup?
i can agree with the microwaving your cup thing (i do it cuz i don't trust myself to boil things properly 😔), but MILK? and THAT. MUCH?!!?!?!??!?!!?!?  i can see why the brits were mad.
are we just going to ignore the history of why british people have tea and really love it? you know....the opium war?
2 minutes in and there's so many tea puns... It'll drive me to insanitea
You should have done microwave vs kettle without the tiktok milk mess...
P.S. Though the TicTok tea got (rightfully) roasted, it's important to remember that way back when, there was such a thing as Cambric Tea. It's basically a cup of milk with plenty of sugar and just enough tea to flavor it. It was meant for children who were too young to drink a proper cup since it would be too strong for them.
Ok but like I’d listen to Tom talk for a *very* long time. I am in love with British accents
4 cups? Rookie numbers
i was hoping you at least mention the difference between tea and herbal infusions, well, you could make a video on this topic matpat, because in countries like Brazil (second biggest youtube consumer (or third if india already surpassed us)) herbal infusions are as common as teas, and in regions like south, much more common (chimarrão (matte herb infusion)) also, latter day saints are advised against any kind of tea (made with camelia), could be a good video idea to investigate further the possible reasons behind this advise and the advise against coffee (its NOT bc of the caffeine! there are indeed toxins produced in coffee beans processing that remains in the drink), as the truth about foods defensor against big food industries you are MatPat, this task suits you very well!
I am british but I have always been horrified that people even put milk in first...ever 🤣 though I do get the saving tge mug thing...but it's still wrong 🤷🏼‍♂️
Fun fact: tea only has two names across all languages.  Im serious. Its always some variation of "tea" or "chá"  Portuguese: chá Japanese: ocha English: tea German(yes, even germany complyed): tee
0:33 Only 3 to 4?!?!? rookie numbers.
As a brit it is criminal to put the milk I'm first most people r very passionate ab that
1:53 As an Asian, I didn't expect this lmao. I didn't realize when you guys say tea you mean the ones that need milk and sugar.
im pretty serious about my tea down to like water temp and exact brewing time - idc how other people drink it, as long as they taste the tea freshly brewed with nothing added before immediately putting in milk/sugar/whatever else. respect the tea. cherish the tea.
Who puts milk in this. It feels like an insult to the best berage
The way I (an American) make tea is: Heat water (WITH KETTLE!!!!) Put tea in for 3 minutes Put half & half in until tea is beige (stirred) Put in 1/2 a spoon of sugar Ice cube DRINK.
3-4 cups a day…”looks at my 4th pot brewing… “how quant…
If I may, my family has found that a) tea tastes MUCH better if you warm the milk too (eg 30 seconds in the microwave, b) put milk at the bottom, and c) brew the tea separately in a pot before adding it to the milk. If you put the milk in then the water and teabag it will taste sour, as I believe happened in the episode, but if the tea is brewed to completion in a separate vessel and THEN added it will taste magnificent.  P.s as an avid tea connoisseur, I would also have recommended comparing large tea brands for maximising flavour :)
BUT WHY NOT IN THE MICROWAVE?? My most burning question gets glazed over multiple times as if it’s a well-known fact 🥲
I am american and I was horrified at that woman brewing tea with milk. Any american in their right mind knows you dont microwave tea and brew it with MiLk
Try not to throw your phone across the room:
You spelled steaped wrong
When I saw Mat pour that much milk in that cup I was so offended because that just hurts my eyes and because I love tea so yeah pain🍵😔
As an American from the south, I can’t get past putting milk in tea. I have to try it
Mat was right about milk in tea
Nice anticipation and reaction Steph.
Matt please never make tea like THAT again 😂
As someone who works in hospitality in London, and makes tea and coffee for a living, I have never see anyone put the milk in the cup before the tea.
I have to agree with mat here. best tea is no milk!
People put milk in their TEA?
Matpat, you should try South African Rooibos tea, steeped for at most 1 minute with 2 teaspoons of sugar and no milk but with cold water. It is delicious.
...all of this says nothing of the micro plastics or pesticides you're ingesting in your leaf soup. this is a thing, please tell me you know this is a thing.
You guys should so the same idea but with Classic Esspresso
You should have done sugar vs honey
As a British hoe I would like to disagree
Y’all adding milk to tea? *Gasps in southern *
Do Mate next 🧉
Grandma used to tell me never pour boiling water on tea bags... always wait till the water stopped boiling - this lowered the temp of the water about 5 degrees, which also turned out to be the same time it takes to pour water into the cup with no bags so heat the glass... so proceedure was... Boiling water into empty cup, wait 5 seconds, pour out, add tea bag, pour hot water on bag, let it seep 30 seconds, add sugar and milk, stir, leave bag in cup or remove with 1 finger to lightly press the bag...  no too hard.
strong tea often has a bitter kick to it... Milk and sugar curbs the kick
Now we need a coffee version of this video
Nothing food related is ever right or wrong.  There is only safe to consume, and unsafe to consume.  Everything else is personal preference which is subjective and meaningless to everyone but the beholder.  Feeling strongly about preferences or traditions do not make them more valid.  Your stomach doesn't really care what ground up crap you shove into it so long as you don't starve to death or poison yourself.
What kind of nightmarish Lovecraftian horror beast drinks tea without sugar in it?  You monsters.
I don't like tea. I drink coffee.  So none of this matters to me at all.
You didn't prove that the microwave made ANY difference. Not very scientific.
Start *|-*
MatPat: "... leaf water ..." Uncle Iroh: "so you wanna catch these hands?"
Someone must alert The Spiffing Brit that he is Tea'ing wrong!
And the cups would make a difference over time for heat retention. You guys drank immediately, and only once. Also you didn't include an actual ratio at the very end in your results summary, but: Assuming the average tea amount is 240ml and the ideal milk amount is 21ml, that's a ratio of precisely 11.4285714286 parts milk to tea. If you're drinking more or less tea in a cup, divide the MLs by the aforementioned number for your ideal milk MLs. (Also, to anybody who may only have gram scales, 1ml = 1 gram.)
Also, you forgot to do temperature and THEN do if the milk should be on the top or bottom.
What is the BEST Healer's Tea, Linden will be the first contender. WITHOUT Milk in the cup.
me who adds 50/50 milk and water
The best way to brew your tea is to brew coffee. But to be fair to TikTok tea, you _can_ brew tea in hot milk...You'll need quite more than one bag though, and it won't be the typical British cup.
I'm not certain who here knows what a tisane is but those have a few episodes of material.  From exploring chamomile to seeing how hibiscus is used in different cultures.
You didnt try microwave vs kettle. You guys talked about it a few times but never tried it. Also one thing ive heard about tea is you have to do a first steep and throw it away because the second steep is better.
steph, i do half a galklon of tea a day. matt can stop complaining.
chai tea >>>>>>
How much sugar??? Is it a preference thing?
Why Do yall put milk in your tea 🙈
wait you're supposed to put milk in tea...? why?
Wait, genuine question. How do you lose leaf teapot while only keeping it 3 minutes? Wouldn’t it be hard to remove all the small pieces or am I dumb?
In my opinion, Indian tea (chai) is the best tea. Also we don't even use tea bags except for green tea
What about different types of milk like rice milk or pecan milk
Wait a minute.  They did milk on bottom and milk on top, but not poured at the same time. Video needs to be done again for science
Bri'ish
Where I'm from milk in tea is an unspeakable abomination. It's not even a consideration, and if you ask for it you get looked at like you've lost your mind.
For as scientific as you claimed to have done all these comparisons, you didn’t actually compare the water heated in the microwave versus a kettle… you tried the TikTok version that you knew was terrible but was it the microwave that made it terrible? I guess we will never know.
What’s the best amount of sugar? Sometimes I manage to make the perfect tea, sugar milk steep is amazing, but no clue how. I don’t like my tea super sweet, so I use a small spoon but like sometimes it’s still too sweet or not enough
Ireland actually drinks The most amount of tea in the world
What about sugar cubes?
Wait till they hear people put sugar or honey in their tea 😩
As a British person, it surprises me that I so recently learnt that if you put milk in too early the bag stops releasing tea🤨
I know someone who doesn't have milk or sugar in his tea  its a sin isn't it
Does warm milk actually help you sleep.
There are so many assorted brands of tea in the UK, such as Taylor's, Tetley's, PG Tips, and Yorkshire Tea, to name a few. All of them are different and require different brewing times. As a result, it's best to experiment and find the best time for your chosen tea that suits your tastes.
Why????????👍🏾👍🏾😱😱
I just need to say that the glass cup has always been the superior tea
bro im born and raised in UK and in all 17 years of my life only heard about putting milk in first today, then again I'm more of a coffee person ngl
I guess they've never drank milk tea.
Im with you matpat. I dont like milk in tea. But I think Brits would hate me because I add sugar in every tea (no matter how sweet it is said to be already) also its crazy amounts of sugar XD
I love all the theory channels but you guys should never share your thoughts until everyone has formulated their own opinion. From a psychological aspect it really does effect everyone else's opinion.  I forget what it's called but it has a name. It's also multiplied when your superior, or someone the other person respects shares what they think . You are more.likely to be swayed by their opinion.  In the name.of science let everyone form their own opinion , then write it down, and then share with eachother. Just saying
What about temperature of the water, and the milk actually??
Please do a Food theory on the lore of Jack in the box I need it https://youtu.be/3dOus0zfmOE
glass mug, water first, then milk, that's how far a lifetime of optimising tea has got me.
3:03 "THAT'S TOO MUCH MILK IN A TEA!" *Adam from Playtech wants to know your location…*  This episode reminds me of one manhwa called "The Duchess' 50 Tea Recipes", read there that water quality also affects a tea's taste.
Doc brown - Propar tea rap, dude got there before you lol
best milk is no milk in tea, I strongly agree
You should get Stephanie some green Darjeeling tea
but what about sweetener such as honey vs sugar or sugar cubes which all of these are commonly used which do we feel is the best sweetener for tea?
My holiday drink is Wassail.
I am certain @thespiffingbrit will have something to say about that.....
Should have looked in China no England for an expert
There is one test that mat pat forgot about and that is dose stirring matter
Don’t use tiktok it steals all you’re data
Why do peapole asociate tea with UK it’s from Asia
Waiting for the coffee version
My tea doesn't taste like anything after only 3 minutes...
What about milk in the middle
You uselessly add mint and sugar to British
in india we put just a little less than half milk in tea
Indian: puts tea open[without any bag] in boiling water and gets the best taste *I am 4 parallel universe ahead of you*   No seriously try making Tea Indian style you'll see the difference. Put water and tea leaf without the bag in a pan and boil for about 2 min..then pour 3/4 milk in and boil for another 3 min.  *T R Y  I T*
As a Brit, my family always put the milk in last unless it’s loose leaf tea in which we put it first so a majority of the time milk is always added last, however I did wonder why occasionally it had a sourness but most times not. Maybe this is why. Will add milk last with my loose leaf tea from now on.  Also I like two sugars and it milky as my own personal preference. Got told on a British airways flight home I must be southern to like a lot of milk. He wasn’t wrong.
0:30 only? I drink every day something like 1,5-2liters
What if you only have access to the flat tea bags? I've looked (okay fine in one store) and the only pyramidal shaped tea bags were the herbal/medicinal ones, which are great for the flu, but not for getting up and going.
I watched this while drinking English breakfast tea wondering what our society has come to.
Do you think this also applies to herbal teas (teas that do not use parts from the tea plant)?
I agreed, up until the milk order. Start cold, and warm it up, or you'll scold the milk. I don't often get to do it in that order, because I don't have a tea pot but a kettle, but... Yeah. Don't burn your milk by putting it in the hot water.
You should try to do something with paper shredder, I don't know what but you should try it
I followed all the step mentioned here and it was the most pathetic tea i have ever had.

OI LADDIE HOW THE TEA?
Can't believe a food theory video on tea ended without even mentioning the ISO 3103 tea brewing standard. ALSO, the British aristocracy DO put the milk on top, so your actual former overlords DID have it right. Pay up the taxes, no representation 😜
Get a cup Put the kettle on  Put a teabag in the cup Add sugar Add the hot water from the kettle  Stir until you get the desired colour  Put the tea bag in the bin Enjoy
6:30 Nice save Steph.  Also " Boston Tea Party Summized " funny cause it's true.
I was totally waiting for Uncle Iroh to show up........
YOUR SUPPOSED TO PUT MILK IN TEA WHAT I don't put milk in my fruit flavored tea from Walmart
As a Brit, I'm only 1 minute and already prepping for a fight.  P.S. No one puts Milk in first... It's water, Tea, Brew, Milk/Sugar to taste.
Don’t forget about the Scots as well. I’m part Scottish and even though I’m not much of a tea person, I’m shocked of how that American woman made her tea.
UK drinker here. Yorkshire tea is the best branded tea bag and they have rectangular bags. A lot better then thr equivalent pyramid pag of PG tips
I'm from HK and our tea is kinda different...I don't think there's any milk in it at all lol-it's kinda bitter
You wanna drive Matt Pat crazy? Point out that he forgot to test how the water is heated. As a tea drinker myself, I can tell you, it makes a huge difference.  Common methods of heating are as follows. Microwave (definitely the worst) stove-top kettle electric kettle internally heated hot-water dispenser  Honestly, the electric kettle and the hot-water dispenser taste about the same to me, which is probably because they use identical heating methods. So, you can just merge those two into one and call it good, and it's simply a matter of testing 3 heating methods. Microwave Stove-top and Electric coil heating  (My personal opinion is that electric is the best.)
The Food TEAorists.
Wait... You are drinking from the same cups? Dont you know thats how shipping happens?
You put milk in tea?
that feeling when youve been making perfect tea without anyone teaching you
If you don't like tea come SA and try rooibos
Bruh you guys drink tea? I drink hot water. Yeah you heard me right. Plain HOT WATER. The best drink.
I have never tried adding milk to Tea, I didn't even know it was a thing. I'll have to try that next time. I've read cooking your Tea in the microwave, if you include the Tea bags, does help to release it better.
I agree with mat pat. The right amout of milk in tea is no milk. Because I'm allergic. But enjoy your tea however you want.
I do think most Brits now add milk at end and then stir it
3 or 4 a day those are rookie numbers
"Needs sugar"   I mean, go ahead and be wrong if you want.
Rules of  tea tea bags slit in for 3 to 4 mins Yorkshire tea is the best  Water in first from a KETTLE Yorkshire tea is the best  A bit more but not too much more than a splash of milk Yorkshire tea is the best You remove the tea bag last  And Yorkshire tea is the best
Ok, but what is the best type of water for tea? Anyone who’s had plenty of water that not all water is the same.
I know this sound weird but hold on to your brains for a moment. You guys @Foodtheory was convinced you took and isolated all the necessary steps in a cup of thé you never actually thought to sort of "boil" the thébag and see what happens? When you: put thébag in cup. Boil water (must be boiling hot). Pour boiling water slowly on the thébag, until required amount of water is achieved. And then add your other likeables such as milk, sugar, extra thébags.  It might be me but I believe thé needs to be strained by hot water just as coffee because I leaves🍃the bitterness out. Please make a follow up on this it would mean so much to me😇
do people add sugar to tea?
Yooo You put milk in tea have been lied to
I love that Steph's spider senses compelled her to save the loose leaf tea before it could hit the floor. Only to throw it at Tom Lmao!
*I'M NOT EVEN FROM THE UK YET I'M OUTRAGED BY THE AUDACITY OF THOSE US WOMEN* 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I currently live in Sri Lanka. We are known for having the best tea. I prefer high grown tea from Nuwara Eliya. To me adding milk and sugar dulls the flavor of the tea. I would recommend that you get a hold of tea from here. It may be labeled as “Ceylon” tea. There are many levels of tea. The Orange Pekoe label has nothing to do with the flavor. OP is generally the best outside of Gold Tips and Silver tips. This is a full leaf tea. The next level is Broken Orange Pekoe which is larger pieces of leaf. Broken Orange Pekoe Fannings  is smaller pieces with Tea Dust being the smallest pieces. As the pieces get smaller the tea will get stronger. In Sri Lanka tea with milk and sugar is called Kiri Te or Milk Tea. Nikong Te is plain tea with nothing added. Tea like wine will have different flavors based on the ground, amount of sunlight, altitude, etc. Teas from different parts of the island have different notes to it.
The best way to make tea is just to put sugar in it.
What if you put the milk water and tea leaves then boil everything together for 5 minutes?🤔
I want to know if they can really tell the difference between microwaving the water in a measuring cup and water from a kettle, I swear there’s absolutely no difference
Also me: *Since when did people put milk in tea-* 😶
I'm British and I looooove tea, and I've never heard or seen anyone put their milk first LOL  Also I'm a no milk type of drinker XD
I'd have been curious to see if there's a difference in using water heated in the microwave. Other than the issue of heating the mug too much, does it make any difference with the water if it's heated to the same temp as with the kettle?
Steph wouldn't like me because I do make my tea in the microwave
1:51 make sure that's spelled "moulded" innit
here's how you know you have the proper amount of milk in your tea step 1. take the tea step 2. pour it down the sink step 3. drink a glass of milk
As a brit i have to say 3-4 cups a day is rookie numbers, Not to mention only at cold times of the year, those are rookie numbers in the summer 😂
Heating tea water in the microwave is a travis-tea.
Everyone knows putting the Milk in first is stupid. I say this as a Brit
I might have an idea for why the milk-before-tea method produces a worse flavor. Because the tea is hot, it's essentially cooking/curdling the milk, thus making it more sour. By pouring the milk in after, it's similar to tempering the tea to even out the temperature between the two liquids and thus allowing it to better blend together without spoiling the flavor.
Part of me was hoping that they would use the "Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy" perfect tea
An entire episode about tea. Uncle Iroh would be proud
Good sirs I have taken it upon myself to attempt your tea recipe. Unto which I may lay my judgements. While I followed your instructions to a "Tea", if you would pardon my joke, I found myself in a quandary. Had I prepared this wrong? The lack of flavor, so uncharacteristic to what I associate tea to have, left me outright flabbergasted. Of course being a man who enjoyed sugars and the like I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I included some honey under the assumption that this would be permitable by your great council of tea aficionados. But this action only further left me in a stupor as it seemed even the overpowering sweetness of honey was dulled to an unrecognizable degree. And upon my tongue this dull flavor appeared to have washed away all semblances of my original cadence. Instead replaced by the overtly proper speech you are beholding for yourself. It appears that your tea not only removes all the joys of your sense of taste but also the joy of life as I know it. An incomparable amount of sugar, spices, and other such rich flavors will be required to compensate for this damage and restore my facilities. In conclusion your tea, while impressive in its own right and certainly a pinnacle of your culinary explorations, is simply unfit for consumption by any member of the human race that values the depth and richness that life provides with all of its wondrous palatable splendors. Even to this moment its life sucking flavor is firmly affixed to my mouth and I fear this empty feeling may very well be incurable.
You had one uncontrolled element in the final experiment.  Your glass mug was hotter because it was used to pour for the other two cups transferring more thermal energy to it before your taste test.  However, I'm sure you caught this after you did the episode.  I've noticed this from personal experience with my Keurig.  If I run hot water to clean it first and use the same mug to catch it, when I finally make my coffee it is hotter than an usual.
So you didn't actually check what way of heating the tea was the best. The part that is most contested. That seems incredibly dumb.
Ye im British and I love my tea and coffee very milky but thats just how I enjoy my drinks.
“Warm leaf water” Matt just summarized all of tea in 3 words
8:10 dream
You are adding the teabag after the water...wrong on all levels, you add the water after the teabag. Watch doc brown's proper cup of tea on youtube guys, he can tell you how it's made 🤣
watched a 20 minute video to tell me I've been making tea right my whole life
im drinking tea rn
I really wish you did a blind test on microwaved water and boiled water. I highly doubt you will find a difference.
I really wish you did a blind test on microwaved water and boiled water. I highly doubt you will find a difference.
Talk about a tea-rific episode~
I learned everything I know about tea, from the Dragon of the West, aka Uncle Iroh
Don't know bout u but up here in YORKSHIRE we have always put the milk in last and if u do it first ur a dirty nonce and should be arrested
wait you put milk?!
I drink tea every day, but despite living in the south, no sugar or milk for me.
My eyes and stomach cried
Ok but if you are going to have any more British themed episodes, you need to bring Tom back, he’s delightful 😅
I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled (loose leaf) tea - but that's just so sad...
The best way to make tea is...  ... the way that makes the taste you prefer.
You shouldve tried purified water vs non purified, fab video now making a brew!
Loose-leaf tea - most teabags have some plastic
Tea drinkers represent. Twinings on deck.  Savages put milk 1st, if at all.
Who told you we ALL put milk in first?! in my family that's treason! Its awful! Its always tea THEN milk (coffee its the opposite) if the milk is in first the hot water breaks down the emynes in the milk making it gross.  where as coffee, if you dont put milk in first you burn the coffee making it extra bitter.  also, the royals do tea first ;)
Not satisfactory
As a Brit I have always put milk in last.
bet milk is no milk
As a Brit' I've never seen or heard of anyone putting the milk in first in the 31 years of tea drinking I've experienced! Just some more disapointing british history 😂
The milk only goes in first when it’s poured out of a tea pot, the milk goes on top if using a bag, yet again Americans completely confusing British tradition
mat, the western way to brew tea is too thick and doesnt leave any room of other flavour other then catechin (the bitter) flavour in the cup of tea and plus adding milk to the tea will cover the natural tea flavor. I suggest a chinese method to brew tea using gaiwan, those step brew tea very thin even more into watery (very dilute) but in that way it's more pleasant to the tongue
So a theory on the milk order thing.  As you're pouring the tea from the kettle first, its aerated a bit and thus cooled slightly between the moment you're pouring the tea vs the time you're pouring the milk. Not much of a temperature difference, i know, but it's probably enough. Adding the milk first means that hot tea is coming in contact with the tea at its hottest moment so that is scalds just a bit more, while also adding much more air.   Basically adding milk first means aerated and slightly scalded milk mixing with hot tea.   Adding tea first means aerated and slightly cooled tea mixing with much less scalded milk.   It'd be interesting to test.  Tbh though, I'm usually a no milk in tea kind of guy.
the existence of the UK tea academy makes me happy
Maybe should have tried with different types of milk. Skimmed 2% or whole and other.....
If they used a pyrex cup I would have LOST MY MIND
Ok so not a big tea guy and that was my first time seeing that viral tea video guides  But I have some words to say about that video.if it helps I ak from the uk  Going in I was think it can't be that right, there a genaral idea of how tea is made that the world share right?  Apparently not. Not a single steam in that video was right.  Half a cup of of water? That just not enough water, Why the microwave, where is your teapot woman? (at least use a kettle), Far too much milk. Are you making tea or a warning a cup of milk to help you sleep at night?And you really just drop the teabag in there at the end there?   In conclusive. That "tea" (if you can even call it tea) is cong to be cold. It's going to be too sweat and it's going to be weak. That actually taste of the tea will be miminal
6:29 Stephanie's motherly instinct of identifying the source of dirt and stains kicking in
Yeah the microplastics from those pyramid bags make me prefer loose leaf.
The cool thing about this food theory about Tea is that in China and Japan, there are ACTUAL tea ceremonies and little tea shrines where the elite have a cup of tea. Of course, the "proper" way of preparing and serving tea is also taught only to the elite back then. It is a very VERY big honor for those cultures to enact the ceremony properly and they take tea-prep all the way to tea serving quite seriously. It's a completely established artform.
16:15 “we’ve upended the British tradition of putting milk in first” not a tradition, an adaptation for poverty, the rich people who could do it properly, did it properly, the less rich had to change the way they made tea to prevent their cheaper cups from breaking made it slightly wrong, so that they could make it at all.
Those pyramid bags leach microplastics into the watet
I steep it for about an hour normally  Bitter is good!
I know that they’re wrong, and American, but there’s progress, it wasn’t that long ago that they were using the Boston harbour instead of a teapot.
The milk goes in first if you use China, the sudden change in temperature can cause the China to crack, if you use porcelain like a normal person, the tea goes in first,
British people don’t put the milk in first anymore tbh
"Just rinse them out and save the space for things that are actually hard to wash" This. Every single freakin' day--THIS
Over-brewed tea  is my personal fav
Milk in tea is heresy
MILK FIRST? You sir are an absolute psycho! You have offended not only me, but also my ancestors
MATPAT! Here’s another question for this, what about: metal cups,other kinds of tea And I make my tea like this  Milk Tea Milk Tea Sugar Cup  So does this beat a trying else?
I want this man to be my science teacher. Is that just me?
the only tea ive ever ever drank is sweet, cold and from a bottle
okay it may just be me but i’ve never put milk in my tea and it sounds pretty umm unappetizing
For those of you who are English, about 5 teaspoons of milk.
Cowards! You forgot about kcup/Keurig tea!
Never clean your teapot, the flavour from the older tea stains adds flavour.
Another Brit chipping in here. Great episode and happy to see that I've apparently been making tea right this whole time. Though don't think I've ever met another Brit who would dare put milk in the cup first!
2 and a coo is the only way to have tea
Na fam British way sucks it's literally kills taste and worst way to make tea.  Indian Way You get every Thing you talked in the video and taste much much better  You Boil the water in a Pot while it's boiling You pour Sugar, Tea and for taste you can add ginger cardamom and let it Boil for 4-5 minutes and then add milk till the colour turn red or light orange then let it Boil for 4-5 minutes and then with the help of a drainer you van pour it in a gap i can guarantee you will find it way better than British tea no hate or any thing just fact
Was the final test with the milk order, brewed in the mug or in the pot? There is one variable you missed out. In the UK, we have builders tea, most common way of drinking tea here hands down. The bag is added to the mug, hot water is added and then the milk after brewing has finished. Some heathens add the teabag in with the milk first, then pour the hot water in. This would be a completely different test compared to brewed tea from a teapot that is poured into a cup with milk in first or after. Did you test this? I would like to know your thoughts.   Also, here in Scotland, Coo and two is the preferred method for a delightful beverage 👌
i thought milk in first was looked down on so milk in last was classier...but not for taste. i put milk in first just because i don't want to get out a spoon to stir it, i let the incoming tea stir it. also i'd never put the tea bag into even hot milky water because i *think* it inhibits the steeping. maybe the milk particles block the free exchange with the leaves. i tried it once to save time and was surprised how little tea flavor came out 😞hehe i seem to be immune to  overbrewed tea..i let the tea bag sit all day...and renuke it too...
17:12 to much milk
I whole heartedly disagree with the milk results.   None of those were anywhere near enough milk.   I typically do roughly a 1:1 ratio of tea to milk. Maybe have a tiny bit more tea than milk, but not by much. Weirdly, it kind of ends up tasting almost more like coffee than tea, but I like it that way.
I find it odd to use milk for tea but for years I use milk for hot coco so who am I to judge
Perfect tea Short
You haven't researched one variable. The type of milk. A northern region of Germany has a very strong and long lasting Tea-Tradition. They prefer to drink the tea with cream instead of Milk.
In bangladesh, almost everyone drinks 2/3 cup of tea everyday. But for me and my friends its different, 6-8 cup of tea is normal for us 😅
matpat is so father having that he is the father
Matt is right. No milk in tea is best tea.
My bf and i never heard of milk in tea. We use a kettle and get tea bags and use honey
Tip about not burning your hand on the cups in the microwave: put a metal spoon in your cup during the microwaving process
Boil IN KETTLE, put sugar in cup, put the tea bag in cup, pour in HOT water, add milk if you like.  And use bushells tea bags for the love of god.
Sorry Matt but Indian tea is better
For my birthday my husband got me a subscription to tea around the world love it
nice to hear I'm doing everything right with my fav tea UwU
I'm sorry did you call it WARM leaf water?? Well no wonder your tea sucks that's gotta be PIPING hot
Cup Sugar Tea bag Heated water Milk  Done, I refuse to do it any other way..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I pick it up from my father and my mother.
What about sugar
Now do coffee (evil laugh)
Try Arabic tea you boil the water in a kettle WITH THE TEA LEAVES you ditch the milk and put 1-5 teaspoons of sugar depending on if you want it sweet or not then you enjoy it's very tasty with kaak aka bread sticks
And on that day, Tiktok lost every single British subscriber.
Same I love tea 💗🍵☕️
I agree with Matt here I'm southern so no milk is the right amount
If pouring first was considered poor for British tea drinking, wouldn’t pouring top, the more rich probably government officials, be doing it like the old kings for Americans
Milk in last is correct
Man used the intro call out his wifes (steph) tea mug issue
(Comment has been changed) I tried tea y a y
Tea bags is the dust bags tea leaves gives you way more richness and healthiness.
Do not use tea bags buy actual tea leaves you would get a way better experience that way.
wait...youre supposed to put milk in tea?
As a British person, its always been a sin to put milk in first, so don't come at us saying we do it wrong because I have never known a single soul to do it that way
As someone without a kettle or teapot, what would be the best way to heat water? I know that microwaving is highly discouraged, but how much of a difference (if any) will there be if I heat it in a pot on the stove? With that, how hot should the water be before I use it? My family has a history of bringing the water to a boil, then pouring it directly into the cup with the teabag. I also saw someone else say this, but what changes should be made for other teas (herbal, green, iced, etc.)?   Love the video and all the hard work that goes into making them!
All wrong. The correct method is paper teabag, 3.5 minutes of brew in the microwave, an amount of milk I cannot describe to you (fairly low), and a spoon of sugar. Mix with spoon. Perfection.
That's not tea, that's hot leaf juice
Hey no hate here but would just like to suggest you don't say Assam region 😂 and just say Assam. It's the same as me calling Florida, the FLORIDA region. Just wanted to correct you. Love from india
Unless Thai or matcha tea milk on tea is gross
What about sweetener?
ngl i didnt know any tea other than sweet tea existed until now very strange
Who be putting milk in their tea? Freaking Yankees
Food Theory Film Theory- @MatPat made a video about tea so he could have an excuse to say "teabag" as many times as he wants on Youtube!   #ProveMeWrong 😛
𝓞𝓶𝓰 𝓹𝓾𝓷𝓼
Say man wtf y'all be puttin milk in tea
some tea's [that ive tried when sick with a bad throat cold] honey is a really great binding agent for you to add more or less into the tea, granted its all up to you to add the honey into it and the same goes for milk just like how most coffees are okay without the milk or require a special brand of milk, so it wouldn't surprise me that some tea's would end up requiring different and varying amounts of honey [most Walmart's in the USA sell probably the same honey just in a differently shaped bottle tbh-]
petition to call tea yummy leaf water
Don't give up on sprouting your avocado! It can take 2 - 3 months for them to sprout, the ones that I sprouted typically took that long at least. They really like to take their time :P Also you should sprout like 10 of them, then choose the best 4 or so to grow, you want multiple trees for pollinating later on as they don't give good fruit from self pollination.
The best tea goes to sweet tea way better than tea
Milk?
This is exactly how I’ve always been drinking my cha 🤣
my British boyfriend also steeps tea in water first, then sugar to dissolve so it doesn't ruin the amount of tea that can be absorbed, then a splash of milk on the end. My favorite cup is a double walled glass mug. It keeps it hot, but you won't burn your hands on the mug.
My dad drinks like a quarter gallon of tea some days
Wait they didn't test for  : if Microwave or boiling  water  tea is better ? Did they ?
I think you mean "Hot leaf juice"
Even though you used the same brand, I wonder if the tea bag was controlled for correctly - or rather if the explanation was correct. You suggest that the difference in flavor and strength is up to the delivery method - bag, triangle or loose, but this might just as well be a difference in quality (again, even though it's the same brand). So I wonder if you cut open a bag and use it as loose tea, if it will be closer to the bagged tea, or actual loose tea.  The end-result is still that triangle bags are considered more fancy and likely use better quality  leaves than regular bags.
8:30 have... Have you thought of shaking your teabag?
You should figure out what type of milk is the best and how much sugar and the type of sugar
Tea
What about the type of milk? Half and Half, 2%, Whole, Almond? Ect
Yeah with no milk is offensive
My family thinks im insane for putting milk in my tea
“Leaf water” brilliant words matpat, absolutely…brilliant
Come on this wasn't scientific. Sure splitting the difference in the amount of milk was better, but the difference should have have been split again to see if there was any noticeable improvement.
"We needed someone born in it. We needed someone *British* "  The Chinese: _Sadness noises_
The best way is the British way
Didn't even talk about the water, or the method of heating, as well as sugar vs honey, etc. Many other factors to discuss
In my area, which is Bengal...  We boil water and milk and then add tea, and after further boiling strain it... you might wanna try that if it is a better method... We Indians do like our tea a lot too.. afterall the British import it from us xD
Am I the only one who like the bitterness and squeezes the teabags anyway?
The thumbnail is wrong. Us Brits drink tea with milk.
I agree with Mat, the best tea is with no milk
As a non-brit, the beginning of the video brought unspeakable pain to me, but the rest was for the most part spot on. Though I prefer loose leaf, I haven't tried the pyramid bags myself, so I'll have to compare the two myself. Also completely agree with Matt as no milk tea is best tea, though it is quite good.
I'm with Matt on the "no milk". If you want milk tea, brew the tea in the hot milk.
And a lump of sugar. Or drizzle of honey.
#BestMilkIsNoMilk
How a British can be a Tea expert, as an Indian I feel outrageous.
I do not put milk when i make tea. Is it weird?!
Oh come on! Nobody but THAT woman in the whole world makes tea that way. You can't use one crazy woman's Tic Tok vid  to judge America.
Stop getting another cup. Just hand wash your single cup to use again and again.
What about cold tea
Taste test needed to be done blindly, I doubt it actually makes a difference.
using clear cups would have been better
tea sucks
What about sugar?  I like my tea whitoud annything, but most people were I live drink tea whit no milk, but whit sugar
*me who doesn't put milk in my tea*
Thank you, food theory, for actually teaching me how to like tea. ❤️
Film theory suggestment new merge mansion adds
Well I'm British
I have been begging every youtuber I know for ages. I am so glad to finally have this.
Food Theory: *How to make the best tea* Me: *hot cocoa*
I don’t know if you “upended” anything since I’ve never seen a Brit pour the milk first and then the tea. 🤷🏾
Love this episode don't know why but eh
I love the whole episode, except for one thing. I have always been taught you put the teabag in first and pour the hot water over the tea.😢
7:15 jones
I really hope that the clip of Tom dropping the tea leaves on steps hand has a lot of memes 😂😂😂 literally LMAO
No milk in my tra, only lemon juice
Can you do a theory about the history of the turducken
well when I moved to study university in the UK we had some classes about the cluture and they said always to pour tea and milk on top and that is the traditional way...
channel idea , suprise theory a channel where you post what you want that either does not fit in the other channels or is sooo huge it is a big suprise
why would heating in the microwave make any difference ?
I just put a big mug with three teabags in the microwave and add like a billion gallons of sugar
stephs reaction was so mom like at 6:24 just like “oop hes gonna drop that” and then immediately hand out
The best way to brew tea is to use loose leaf tea and a teapot. Teabags are more convenient but the bag should be steeped in hot water for at least 3 minutes. With regard to putting the milk in,this actually depends on the type of cup.used as the upper class had very fine China cups and so put the milk in first to cool the tea down as they thought it would crack the cup. Lastly,regardless of whether you use teabags or loose leaf tea,always use a quality tea ( I.e NOT Liptons)
I add very little milk to no milk, AND no sugar
6:30 i love how steff put her hand under his tea leaves just in case and perfectly catches it in time like she knew it was going to happen
wheres my coffee theory............................................................
im with Tea m Tea orist
You're all wrong, the pefect cup of tea is actually how my dad makes it when i'm hungover on a sunday morning
As a british person, i can confirm that if we don't drink 4 cups a day, we melt like the witch from the wizard of oz
Hi
Can we go a coffee version of this episode I would love to see if I’m drinking my coffee wrong
Let it steep for five minutes and then add a teaspoon of honey 👌
Stop making the tea joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this video omgg...g. but like....bestie  can you maybe analyze over somethign... heres my suggestion for a video topic unrelated to this..... analyze the new lankybox kitchen restaurant !! 😮😫😓😔💅✨️ yet again... I love this video i was slurping toes- i mean tea while watching ths!!!
India also has good tea
I love tea
I drank tea watching this🇬🇧
Maaannn you guys have GOT to try Chinese tea
Upset in britishnes
northerners are gonna be mad that you didn't call the leaf water a brew
Hey Matt patt can you test if sound affects taste Ik that you tested color and sight and ik smell affects it but does your hearing affect it and if so what sounds make your food taste the best?
as a brit i already did things the way that proved to be the best in the video lmao
I'm Scottish and I can indeed confirm that everyone makes tea wrong, except from us 😜
Still need to test what kind of milk is best, whole or skim. Cream or half & half
Tea from Teavana was phenomenal....      Until they shut the place down at my mall and now I can't get any of the Tea, there's no frickin' other branch >:(
Not trying to be offensive, but sometimes I think that the reason why the British add milk to their tea is either they like drinking tea but they're too classy to admit so they found a loophole, or that the bitter taste in tea is too much for their can't-handle-spice tongues 😂
So about that milk on top or bottom thing Idk I read about this thing in 5th or 6th grade that the colder currents always come below the hotter currents. I tried this with lukewarm and chilled water and found the water mixes better when chilled water is poured on top of the lukewarm water Idk if this applies here too
Heya, totally unrelated to this Theory video, but was playing catch-up with so older theories and finished the Pepsi having a Navy Theory video. The Pepsi taste test that happened with Nikita Khrushchev with the better Pepsi being the one with USSR water reminded me about the NY pizza Theory; Does water have that big of an effect on soda and what else (food, beverage, growth patterns of flora/fauna) does it affect?
I don't like hot beverages or tea.
I'm from South Africa and we drink rooibos tea to me is way better healthier and no caffeine taste better too, u can add cinnamon,lemon slice and pieces ginger help when u not feeling well
Thank you matpat. Milk is for the weak.
What about the milk in between
There Are Groups Of People That People Think Of When They Think Of Tea Asian People And English People
The fact that the type of milk was not brought into attention makes me mad
So glad these guys are not British. Otherwise, when talking, they would’ve dropped the T. Then suddenly it’s ‘Bo’oh’o’wa’ah’ without the T!
Food theory idea:How many pounds does Santa gain after eating all those cookies on christmas?
Milk in tea is gross 🤢 , I'll just use water and sugar thanks 👍🏽
I don’t add milk to tea bc yea
And if you listen carefully, you can hear thousands of British people scream in outrage.
can't believe a video made me drink tea again. thank you so much I missed tea more than I thought I would
Using science, they came to the correct way to make tea. This is how you make a cup of tea, straight out of the kettle, this is how I, a British person, have done it my whole life.  But when doing it from a pot, I think it tastes better, with the milk on the bottom. It also bubbles a little bit, which makes the first couple of sips feel and taste slightly different.  I prefer drinking potted tea, but doing it from a pot is like a ritual, it takes longer to stew and go through the rigmarole, so the kettle way is the quick and easy way to do it.
MatPat's Diet Coke is to Steph's hot tea.
Sugar or honey now that’s next ☕️🍯
As an Indian, our typical tea, which is called chai, is much different.
Pov *tea is just a leaf/vegetables soup*
If just one of you is sick
I’m British and I’ve been pouring my milk in on top for years, finally I have a video I can show to my peers to prove them wrong. Adding milk first also carries the risk of being absorbed into the tea bag so you lose some of that goodness. The way I make tea is to put the tea bag in first, then pour the hot water over it, stir it around for a bit then take it out, add my sugar and stir it in and then lastly add my milk. It has never failed me yet.
These titles are starting to get personal
Video Idea: Is it better to get frozen pepperoni pizza, or just buy cheese pizza and add your own pepperoni?!!! #NWO
This was a very good one. Lots of science here
Matpat you need to do a detailed explanation of the jack in the box lore
3-4 ALOT what never been to England
Well, I eat my pizza on paper plates and it tastes better then on a regular plate
The food theorists, check out LankyBox kichen cwick!
13:35  I feel the same lol
what about temputure
Usually with the teapot method, you warm the pot with water from your kettle first, empty it, then fill it again and steep your tea.
Tea is called sugar water 🌊 in my country
My grandmother makes tea with the coffee pot lol
YOU DON'T TELL THE BRITISH WE MAKE TEA OF ALL THINGS WRONG
Being British, me and my family have always put milk on the top. That way it just generally integrates itself better into the mixture.
Can you revamp stale chips and if so what’s the best way 🤔
Even I, a technical Spanish/Dominican and my brother in law, who is a pole (I learned tea drinking from him) know and understand this is abuse to this flavoursome beverage.
I was just about with you. Though the 5ml milk, how Tom, said he would make his, is definatly the way to go. Also with your milk first or after... Did you use a teapot for that? Because you shouldn't put milk on a teabag before the water.
Hopping on the tea train. One experiment that would be fun to try is how different things taste when blocking certain receptors. A good way to do this is with Gymnema tea, which blocks all the sweet-receptors in your mouth. Coming from personal experience it is super bizarre to taste all the food group, especially the one being blocked. Love your vids Mat!
Hey Mat u forgot to talk about with kind of milk to use like whole milk, 2%, or 1% milk
you need some Uncle Iroh in here
IDEA: Coca cola tastes sweeter when its christmas season.
as a relatively newbie tea drinker, this was both entertaining and helpful! though, i’ll stick with no milk :)
17.21 you said British tea =milk goes on bottom but in the animation you chucked away the cup with the milk on Top
My parents call our milk measurements a 'glug' which is when the milk bottle makes one 'glug' as you pour
Me who just grabs hot water and a tea bag
im so pissed that they tested tea container and NOT testing sweeteners
You should do American tea next lol
I agree with mat I don't like milk with my tea
tbh, i feel like the different "mugs" at the end should have had more variance - standard glass/ceramic mugs are nice, but thermoses and travel mugs are also commonly used to hold tea. I think the difference between a standard mug of tea vs a metal-lined thermos should have been tested, because the taste between the two definitely would have been different
I just wanna know if getting water from a Keurig would be an okay substitute for boiling - that's one method that wasn't covered lol
Steph eating the cups with the tea?? 0:36
Very very likely not the first to point this out but somewhat disappointed you didn’t include the temperature of the water as a factor. Definitely not something talked about frequently in English tea but most certainly a factor in other teas. If it’s a factor elsewhere, it’s likely a factor in English tea too!  Also sugar in tea? Why bother drinking tea at all then! Hashtag shots fired.
As a british person I gotta say that more milk is better. About 32ml of milk for me. I actually nearly spat out my food when I heard 5ml. You disgusting Americans. Also you didn't take into account of Water %. having 26ml of milk but only 10ml of milk wont be the best tea. Now if it was like 100ml then maybe but just pointing it out.
Make a video about the single ingredient(though about it after the single food)  that can give the most nutritional value and can be absorbed by humans
Warm leaf water😂😂😂😂  Mineral water, more alkaline water will extract more.
Wow that's so crazy (sips sweet tea)
The handle was hot because that particular cup is not meant to be used in the microwave. One meant for the microwave will not have hot handles. Same goes with other things. And that TikTok video made me scream. In my VERY BRITISH grandparents living room to which I absolutely refused to show them that video when asked if I was okay. I'm used to British "swearing" but Grandma-ma went full on American swearing (She found it on her own so I give her mad props for paying attention to how things are done on the Internet). Her darling grandkittens are having quite an effect....I might add most of her grandkittens are American by birth. We all were gathered via video call if we weren't near and told if any of us EVER made tea like that, we would be disowned. Much to the family's merit, we all were actually horrified at that video which then sparked many of us asking our American friends how they make tea. A question that never, ever came up before. Sorry for being a wee bit late to this par-tea.
As a British person, I have yet to meet someone who puts milk in the bottom of the cup.
CORRECT OPINION IGNORED  TEA CANNOT INCLUDE MILK
British subscriber here. I have it mostly with less milk and I squeeze the bag when it's taken out (but I add sugar so maybe that counters the tannins?) but everything else for the most part I agree with, and most people I know add the milk last already 😊
The flavor in food is in its moisture.  By adding the milk after using the thermal mass of the teacup to lower the temperature, you lose less of the moisture in the milk, and therefore, its flavor.
Food theory idea :how long can you survive living of  Vidmins
Tea,i love tea     Also bonelab theory when
No milk vs cream? I think you missed a big opportunity for experiments for this one.
Milk first?! Wtf I'm British I put it last too cool down the boiling water, plus not many people use tea pots anymore. Even if we do it's always milk last
but what really is an interesting thing to look into is, what is more efficient a dishwasher or washing dishes manually?
Wow I have been making British tea my whole life without knowing it-
Ah so the milk goes in after the tea.. Yeah we know, it was only so the cups don't break if you're making tea with a teapot and old family china. You can replace your daily mug, but you can't replace great granny's mug.
I feel like the places people immediately associate with drinking lots of tea is the UK and probably Asia, but us eastern Europeans also drink tea constantly
15:43 that "oh wow there is" is probably the funniest part of the video
Step away from my hot leafy beverage.
Milk? Give me cream or give me death.
Do it already, please A food theory on the right way to load a dishwasher Do you pre-sort cutlery? Ends up or down? Where do you put the bowls? I need answers
Also depends on the water that you use, in the north of England/ south of Scotland it's Beter when you add mil at the bottom
Also depends on the water that you use, in the north of England/ south of Scotland it's Beter when you add mil at the bottom
I very much agree with your no milk policy Mat
I drink lot of tea
you sure did make us mad
Hi food theory team I had an idea for a Christmas theme video How healthy is Santa's life style Since he also eats milk and cookies I was kinda wondering the actual numbers of calories and sugar he consumes
This reminds me of an essay by George Orwell, "A nice cup of tea" He kinda was on point
Stay away from my hot leaf soup or someone gets hurt
Just another Brit here: my family has been adding milk at the end for generations. Sorry lad, now about those taxes...
Heat the pot first. tip the water  out. add the bag. add freshly boiled water. steep for 5-7 min
3-4 a day.... try 3-4 before lunchtime!
Wrap it up with the dong tea.
British people:impossible
what if this is THE BRAZILIAN METHOD lol
I remember when my grandma got like 10k on tea leafs good times 😂
Dont add milk
what kind of milk tho?
0:35 Amateur. I Go through 3 - 4 Teapots a day.
Dude why don’t you make any video about the brewing techniques of coffee
It not tea unless you boil it on stove pot
Did just do a whole video about tea tasting and its history without mentioning East Africa and 🇰🇪. I don't understand how.
thank you mat for you RIGHT opinion about milk
the right way to make tea (personal opinion) put tea leaves directly in mug enaugh to cover the bottom, 1 teaspoon of shugar(optional), pour water filling the mug, when shugar is dissolved add a slice of lemon and press it a little on the bottom of the mug and drink when tea isn't too hot (polish recepie)
Milk in Tea is For PSYCHOPATHS... But That's None of My busyness
as long as I can hate on the British I can be happy forever
what about milk in the middle?
What type of milk?
he has to make a vid on that new lankbox kitchen lol
MATPAT WHAT ABOUT THE WATER QUALITEA
This Brit has never put the milk in first. I have a mug with a PG Tips teabag and a couple of spoons of sugar in, add the boiling water and then a large splash of milk and I prefer it weak so I take the bag out shortly. In fact I get two cups out of one bag.
I can't believe after all this work, you guys didn't take into consideration the temperature of the water when it comes in contact with the tea, it's literally the most important thing... this channel is a joke
No you actually don’t make lemonade you make life take them lemons back you make your scientist make a combustible lemon and you know the rest if you play portal two
I’m half Persian/ Iranian, how ever you want to call it. Anyway I’m qualified to tea 😂 I love tea I drink a lot everyday too, not as much as the average person, though. They drink tea like rounds of vodka or beer, or any alcoholic drink at a party or a gathering. It just keeps on coming. Whoever is hosting the gathering at their house it’s kind of your tradition/religion. Whatever you wanna call it for the host to keep on bringing tea and pastries. although we do not have it. With milk, we either have it with how much sugar, sugar cubes, honey, or we have these little sugarcane rocks, that we put them in our tea.   I’m also half French though, so I do like my coffee a lot too though. But I am more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker.
I'm British and idk anyone who puts the milk in 1st
Me when the intro comes : 😎😎🥳🥳😎🥳😎🥳
I'm like Steph too. Though most of the tea I drink throughouth the day do not contain Caffeine or else my sleep will be totally destroyed.
That tea catch from Steph was impressive
heres how to make good tea: no milk.
Anyone notice the peep in the background? 4:06
Great video!  Tea is best cold brewed in Boston Harbor.
For other Americans who also don't use metric measurements in our everyday lives, I looked up the mL to oz conversions. These are approximations. 5ml=0.17oz 26.9mL=0.9oz 48mL=1.62oz.  Apparently I'm pretty heavy-handed with milk since my "splash" looks more like the middle amount than the British "splash" of milk.
What kind of milk?
Hey matpat I found a cool video you should watch it called five nights at Freddy welcome to dreamworld
Microwaving to boil the water doesn't make a difference, but milk before tea bag is pure evil
Team no milk 😂
Want a creepy weird Video  just search up how to Effectively Apple
I like sweet tea :D
Theory idea: How long can you survive on only Thanksgiving leftovers?
Wait...... You put milk in tea...?
milk tea the best tea
But the pyramid tea bags are horrible for the environment!
Tea press all the way, 1st brew is for your enemies 😈 Give them the bitterness.
I bet you won't see my comment Mootpat also please give me a shout out😅
"not in a microwave" what's wrong with boiling water in a microwave, it's MADE for boiling water, boiling water is how it heats things, it is the IDEAL thing for boiling water.  given the known absorption of microwaves in water if you have a known quantity of water you can get to your desired temperature quicker and more consistently than a range or electric kettle. and it's not going to go OVER 100 c because water, so boiling is boiling.
Mat is right, the best amount of milk is no milk! I mean, it's nice with chai or other teas that have appropriate blends of other ingredients, but milk takes away a lot of the tea's own flavour, or downright ruins it if the tea isn't meant to be drunk with milk. Be mindful of the type of tea you drink before ruining it with dairy! Always taste your tea without any additions first. This has been a PSA.  Also never put milk in before the tea leaves, you barbarians. You brew the tea and add milk only right before drinking.  Also would have loved an addition of which sweetening ingredient is the best. Like, plain sugar is my go to, since honey has such an overpowering taste, but simple syrup would likely be the superior version.
as a modern brit if someone made me tea with the milk in first id cry
Little surprised you didn't mention that tea bags where never ment to be used for brewing tea and that they where simply pre packaged servings that you where ment to put in the old metal tea ball thing's...sorry I forget there actually name. People just dunked them in and the inventor just rolled with it
I feel that they should have done a final test: heating water via microwave vs boiling it with the kettle. Sure, they tried the TikTok version but that one not only had the microwaved water but also the portions completely wrong. So now that they have the correct portions they should have had Mat create a couple of tea cups, one with microwaved water and another one with boiled water, and let Steph and Tom taste both to see if they can tell which is which and if either of them is better. This would avoid their negative bias against microwaved water and see if they can really spot a difference. Also, the water would have to have the same temperature for both cups before preparing the tea so as to make it as equal as possible and so Steph and Tom won't know which is which by mere amount of heat.
Only 3-4 cups of tea? Oh sweet summer child... You gotta visit the UK and Ireland at some point LUL
You should do hot chocolate next is would be so cool
Nice teaory matpat
Watching this for the second time to bask in the success of a nice cup of tea. I used to steep tea for way to long because all I knew was that my mom had told me that if I want it stronger I should steep it for longer. Just made some tea(the way I normally do) but only steeped it for 3 minutes. I only changed that one thing and it made it so much better😌
Does KitKat have the loudest break?
Not one mention of reason for the disdain for microwaving the water? Psssshh, you didn’t sell me 🤪
The forth channel should be about books
Should have tried warming the tea pot before steeping vs. not.
I live in Croatia 🇭🇷 and i have never seen or heard aboat milk in tea. BTW i keep the flat bag in for 6 minutes and it's good. It's also what the box says
3-4 cups a day is about what I drink on my days off. I was actually drinking my second cup when this popped up in my playlist lol. Also milk in tea is gross... unless its oolong... or boba. (But I mainly drink herbals so milk in there is a crime) And I honestly don't get the hate for microwaved water! I do that or a kettle depending on how much time I have and it tastes no different.  That tik toker though needs to be in jail.
100% Milk with tea
This was pointless and i love it. Im here for it. And turns out ive been making my tea right for 20 years lol
But the British do pour their milk on top and is the more common method now. Its a class system as lower class people would pour it on the bottom as for the reason you suggested but the upper class people would pour it on top. I learn this from Jonathan Ferguson who is a curator for the British Royal Armouries. You can see his video called "You're Doing It Wrong: Tea and Milk with Jonathan Ferguson" on the Forgotten Weapons channel.
I wish you showed the tea in the cups😩
3-4 cups of tea is not a lot .... I drink between 6-12 cups a day.
Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳,,, and stop calling your (tea) British. it's.  Indian.  too!!!!!!
if you're putting milk and sugar in your tea you're already doing it wrong
Right. Basically you only put the milk in first if you are pouring from a teacup since it makes it taste nicer however this wouldn’t work with a kettle which is why milk second became the default, second you have to compare brands not just shapes, a Tetley teabag will never compare to a Yorkshire tea and third there is no correct amount of milk, I love a good milky brew but my mother prefers it builders style. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
Shouldn't drink milk unless you desire to gain weight. That includes skim milk. That will add on the most weight.
no milk in tea
I ll keep my tea with boiling water and a tea bag without milk! But I am not british but German.
3-4 cups of tea a day?  Those are rookie numbers. I have a 22 oz teacup. I have 4-5 of those a day.... Most of the pyramid bags are, unfortunately, made of a plastic cloth, and leave microplastics in the tea....
FOOD TEARY
Them: warm leaf water Me: hot leaf juice!!!
So I like my tea pipping hot, so microwave and glass mug for me!!!
Guess who's washing the dishes from now on...
okey but steph noticing a small wobble and catching the tea was so impressive and satisfying
arabs drink tea 5-10 cups a day
Hot water tea bag milk This is from a English girl
I like strong tea so lose leaf all the way. I have a tea pot for lose leaf and I have tea eggs if I don't want to make a whole pot.
Ugh, your tea puns are TEArrible.
tea is supposed to have milk?
I hate to be a buzzkill but was the brand you used the same all across the board for the tea bag style and loose leaf?  Not all tea companies are created equal and some may use lower quality tea.   You never specified if you removed the tea from the bags and resealed them to see if they would come out the same.  Also, another thing to consider is what kind of tea pot did you use?  A metal one may keep the tea at a higher temperature or change the taste of the tea (think of those metal tea pots from Teavana back in the day) or is a ceramic the way to go due to its neutral coating?    Plus, if water makes a difference as you say in the pizza episode, does water in general make a huge difference with tea?  Sorry, I'm wanting to know to make the ULTIMATE in ULTIMATE cups of tea.
just started this hope its not a tragetea...XD  but seriously you've been the best with your videos
Theory idea:milk first or cereal first 🤔
not even a single mention of Chinese emperor Shen Nung. you know they guy who invented tea? in the country that made tea first and got imported in the 1650s ?
Tea is just better
chai is the best
you know what you should do. do this but with hot chocolate.
Indians right now- MY TEA YOU BRITSSSSS
great video, matpat, but you left out a method; it's a lot less common, but I swear it brews a better cup: the percolator. You wouldn't think so, you'd think it would over brew but actually, I think it actually keeps the tannins at bay, especially if it's the urn variety. (seriously, look at your urn after you've brewed tea in it, and you'll see where all the tannins went. tea stains like a mother..
The last test he warmed the glass mug, also test a terricota mug that’s the worst for tea
4:36 ooh AHHH it’s HOT!
wait, americans think 3 cups a day is a lot?
Several thoughts as a britsh tea drinker. 3-4 cups a day is nothing. A cup an hour until dinner is my normal limit.  Milk after has long been the normal when pouring directly to a mug.  Milk first is predominately when using a teapot. The cooling the teapot gives means the milk doesn't scald, like you found in your test in a mug.  Some parts of the UK still do milk first and a mug. Colin Furze comment section on his tea making robot highlights this division. Something Colin put down to the hard Lincolnshire water.
You didn't check whether you should put the water in first and then add the teabag, or put the teabag in first and then add the water. That last one is how I do it, and I've heard it makes a difference. Also, four cups? Get on my level, Stephany, I sometimes drink an entire liter of tea in the morning.  😉
You missed a lot of things you could try, for example: brewing for five minutes but adding more milk (combinations between each category)
wait you actually use regular liquid milk??? where i’m from most people just use either powdered milk or condensed milk lmaoo
So going to get grilled for this. Boil water in kettle , put tea(earl grey either bag or loss leaf depends on what I have,  bag in mug and let it step for a few minutes. no milk, no sugar.
Wait a minute... I'm a Brit that's how I make tea!!
Just living for the thumbnail saying "Your tea is wrong", but as a Brit their optimised tea method is basically how I make my tea anyway 😎
0:08 ummmm thank you po? 0:09 THANKS
No your tea sucks, sweetened iced tea is clearly the best. 4 teabags for 1 gallon of water steeped for 30min with 2/3cup granulated sweetener, I've found half sugar/half splenda to be the best. Though I referred to it as iced tea, it is really good hot without the ice on a cold day or night.
Make chai
Mat...please leaf the tea jokes alone..you're in too steep
I use an infuser for my tea, I wonder how it compares to the pyramid bag.
I agree no milk is the best (for me) :D I would love to see Matpat try gongfu. No theory, just curious what he'd think. I found out about it earlier this year and bought a mini set (just the gaiwan with a smaller and a larger cup) for drinking tea through the day.
☕️Britain starting opium war do to tea
Milk seals the teabag and you get less flavour from the tea. So you need to put tea in after the brew for a mug, but you need the milk in first for a teapot.
I'm Indonesia i love tea
THE TURKISH USE TEA MORE NOT THE BIRTISH
Nobody ever says why heating the tea in the microwave is bad
I eat the tea leaves
my favorite drink during this time of the year is Mountain Dew
“She’s queen tea”? Come on matpat, you missed an opportune chance to call her royaltea
I know this is in the end a channel targeted to grasp younger audiences but claiming to create the perfect cup of tea when you only try 3 different variations per variable, the lack of variety weighs down on how accurate your final approximation of perfection is. one example would be the amount of milk, using only 3 measurements with a range of 40+ ml gives nothing more than a lackluster approximation and gives a lack of credibility for the final conclusion. this could be due to time constraints or to make the video more entertaining but in the end, it would have given a much better answer to the question "what is the perfect cup of tea?"
I quite like the bitterness which comes form squizing the teabag. My teabags are in flat circular Shape so you missed one
as someone who is chinese and lactose intolerant, i agree with mat, no milk in tea is the best tea
I love tea but I think my favorite hot drink is apple cider.
Check mate I drink ice tea
Loose leaf 🍃 tea no milk  or sweeteners.  Just my preference
Already a fail for not using PG Tips tea.
A flat plate is the best way to enjoy tea
Was I the only one who assumed that putting in the milk last would taste better BEFORE they confirmed it?
Ok but my tea passion appeared after some cold green tea in a Japanese event.... Also, milk in tea doesn't exist in Latin America (except for chai)
21 minutes watching, and I don't even drink tea.  That's how good this channel is.
There is a variable that you didn't test. cold milk or scalded milk.
So I had an idea for a Food Theory, it’s a stupid idea, but nonetheless-  Y’know those painted houses? Where the paint is toothpaste color? Yeah, what if that was actual toothpaste? Just buy a BUNCH of toothpaste, blend it, then slap it on your house. The question is though, how much is all the toothpaste, and, can it even stick ON the house?  Yeah it’s stupid af 💀
can you make a video about how long you should boil pasta for? or about if people should have died from eating food from Total Drama? maybe both
is this the way uncle Iroh made his tea? is this why it was so good?
I might be special but I like a teaspoon of honey without milk but that is just how I was raised to drink tea from my grandfather
but we do put milk on top 🥲
Nah dude. If you want goooood tea. Get a chinese person. British tea traditions come from china.
The hot leaf juice is too powerful
Asian seeing you pouring milk into tea:
Make a theory about ramen and what is the best type of ramen
Can you do a video on the sustanabilyt of eating ramen every meal? Do NOT STEAL THIS +TRADE MARK QUESTION BY ME
When boston couple, offers you join their tea party....
As someone who has never had coffee or tea. This episode was quite irrelevant to me.
He lied those are not all identical. They all have different letters on them.
yk the milk at the top tasting better makes a lot of sense to me. I can compare to how carbonara is made like you don't put the eggs yolk in first cause they'll cook you put them last so they have the opportunity to emulsify with the cream
I couldn't give you any stats but I 1000% remember being a teenager and being told to NEVER put the milk in first with coffee or tea because it somehow spoils the milk faster?  I thought it was impossible to be true and tried both ways and surprise surprise, the milk on the bottom had a sour taste to it.
BEST MILK IS NO MILK !
6:32 Matt's face when it first happens oh goddd
Also, if you enjoy the drink, the best vessel is always a rounded one - with tea, a ceramic mug is the best option, but choosing a globular shape where the hole at the top is smaller than the girthiest part of the mug all the aroma gets bottlenecked heightening both senses of taste and smell. (It's the reason wine tastes better out of glasses with such a shape, thus why so many wine glasses have them)
Should we all just agree that anything from TikTok should just be considered a mistake and never be recreated?
The best cup of tea is easy to make. You take a tea bag, place it in the cup, pour boiling water over the bag so that the water filters through (permeating the leaves as it does so, saving the need to wait for it to brew), then milk to preference, and stir. Sugar can be added at any one of these steps, though should come before stir.  But to truly be the best cup it must also be made by me. Sorry.
Can food actually control how smart you sre
Mas msa sam sma asm ams
I'm at 12:47.   Did you guys decide that tea pots were better but then determine the steeping time on a mug? Isn't that a bit weird, since the body of water of a tea pot is larger than that of a mug?
It's as Iroh said, the best tea tastes delicious whether it's served in a porcelain pot or a tin cup
Now we need a Part 2 where Matt tests which milk/milk alternative and sugar/sugar alternative are the best combination with this recipe.
Indian here who makes tea directly in milk
Or, now here me out, coffee. Because I'm Scots. British does not mean English.
Love the vid also have a theory of my own (it might be a big crazy) Ok so from cocomelon we learn all the characters names except the parents right. Ok so here’s my theory I did a bit of research and found some things. The dad from cocomelon and johann Schmidt (red skull) from marvel both have coppery light brownish reddish hair. They both have greenish blue eyes. And they both have similar jawlines. Their noses are also quite similar. And to top it all off the cocomelon family last lame is Schmidt. My theory is that johann Schmidt was living  quiet peaceful life with his wife and three kids, when one day he sees this fancy blue glowing rock in their yard and he goes to check it out. As soon as he touches it he gets transported to a different world in a less animated body. This works because the tesseract teleports people places. Ok that is my theory  If you are even still here thank you for listing to my rant.
I have a huge mug that I use for my tea, and I drink it a liter at a time. 🤣
The amount of British energy in this comment section is astounding
Tea before milk or milk before tea is like milk before cereal or cereal before milk.
Actually the British were correct with the order of milk and tea in the past, but it was the rich enough people that could do this, in that time that was less than 15% of the population at least, therefore,  the way do it stayed in part, probably should look into what experts says, maybe the knowledge hasn't been lost, but the way the information you gathered was made was by the majority knowledge which came from one branch of british tradition, I think, to lazy to look it up
George Orwell has been in shambles since the release of this video
Upon watching them add the tea bags/tea leaves directly into the mugs instead of a teapot, my very British mother frowned, shook her head, and said 'fucking amateurs'.
y’all gotta try the algerian mint tea, you guys won’t regret it because it’s so good and refreshing.
Ah yes, nothing like sharing mugs-
Sorry, Brit here, I've always done Coffee = milk first. Tea = milk last.   I've never known milk in first with tea...?
I didn’t see any reason that you gave, other than Matt being silly and burning His hands, to not use the microwave to heat water
3-4 cups of tea ha them be rookie number lol
FT! You need to check out James Hoffman coffee videos. I think there’s some stuff you could learn about coffee and tea through him
I only drink tea with milk when it's chai latte.
Too many Tea Puns
A LEAST OUR SCHOOLS ARBT SHOOTING RANGES IN BLOODY MATHEMATICS
I love how this episode went with everyone's reactions to finding new ways to make tea, or confirming they already had the perfect way.
u need the right tea bag
Im litterally drinking my tea
*obligatory english tea drinker response* about the teapot heat difference: a lot of brits who use a teapot warm it before using it by filling with boiling (or just very hot) water and waiting it to warm up before making tea. idk i learnt it from my parents who learnt it from theirs and so forth so if u find a teapot is making your tea too cold, leave boiling water in it for a minute or two and pour it out before making tea :)
Ngl thats litraly an irish cup of tea
can u guys do the right way to make coffe  id like to see that
I guess I always knew British folks put milk in their tea, but I have considered doing that exactly zero times in my life.
Honest question tho is do you put sugar in or not haha 😆
Love the experiment, but you can’t claim it’s the perfect cup of tea without considering what Asia has to say on the subject since they’ve had tea longer than the British
for some reason, I only like the fruity teas. Lemon is a favorite.
Not a question that Matt Pat would answer but what tea do you think would be the best for psychedelics?
Aww, no testing a travel mug just to see if it changes things?
I’m British and I’ve never met anyone who puts milk in first, that’s super weird
i have never drinked tea with milk, and never knew anyone did till now.
i agree with matpat, no milk in tea is best tea. both from a flavor profile and as a lactose intolerant person
Dude the British stole tea from china the true OG tea connoisseurs
Yorkshire tea is the best no competition
Where is the sugarrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Na the one she made is wrong everyone make a tea team in my comments and we British or where you are from we will make the ultimate teaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Note to self, don’t let Americans anywhere near my brews.
In Scotland we use **CIRCLE** Tea bags, no string
i actually expected them to facture in the type of milk being used, but i guess i'm overthinking it
food theory: how to solve world hunger
I moved to Turkey in 2018, I now consume much more tea than I did in England. That is tea without any milk.
The Tiktok tea made me nearly throw up and I only watched them make and taste it.  Hearing them find the milk on top is so amazing to hear since in baking things turn different based on order so to me it makes sense drink mix also would change taste. Also makes me happy I put my milk on top already unless I’m doing southern tea
M T
i am sorry but steph your not the queen of tea my mam is she drinks 7 to 8 cups of tea a DAY
5:57 none
FOOD THEORY IDEA: I’m pretty sure there is a lore for GOLDFISH. On their commercials. Can there be anything to theorize on them? 🤔
Wait for it when Steph and Matt both realize that their avocado won't grow true to seed and they'll eat the worst avocado in their entire life.
Try 6 i still dont have issue in body i wonder
I started drinking tea from this video and now I'm addicted to tea
british people dont actually put the milk in first anymore
3 top 4 cups of tea a day is nothing lol I drink around 1 to 2 liters of tea each day
We dont put milk on the bottom of the mug. That would be like putting milk before cereal which is wrong in every way
But what about the type of milk. What about using whole milk vs 2% or skim. And what about milk alternatives like soy, almond, or coconut.
*The Portuguese ppl watching this unsure if they should feel slightly offended/left out or not*
Meanwhile I'm learning I've scientifically engineered the worst way humanly possible to make my tea :P
My mom always makes me tea when I'm chilling playing video games so I don't care what math or science says otherwise, mothers home tea is always the best
DONT JUDGE ME! Ok.Listen. I'm Polish And so I don't drink tea with milk I drink tea with honey and lemon  So please agian don't judge me as I like tea with honey and lemon but I still don't mind drinking tea with milk. SO AGAIN PLEASE DONT JUDGE ME!
this video is asian erasure lol
Now they just need to try ALL the different kinds and blends of tea
@MatPat   I'm still not sure why you can't bring water to a boil using a microwave. A little bummed you didn't experiment with that variable.
Should have had simplynailogical on this one
I wish we could have seen some of the teas better
3:50 i think that's my favourite Rooibos Tea
Milk goes in last anyways, putting it in first is an old tradition
your tea already sucks cause it int Yorkshire tea
Have to do coffee next.  Percolated versus brewed etc.
let's start with this - milk in tea bleh, lucky you didn't make tea so thats ok. Tannin free tea is not tea if you can't spread it on a piece of bread you've done something wrong.   by the way, tea sealed in bags, secured in containers ... why not ordinary leaves in boiling water?
As a British person who is yet to drink tea I will make sure to tell my family about this
The best milk is no milk I drink my tea without milk nor sugar
Funny thing is I don’t know any british person that puts milk in first, myself included. We always put milk in second so i think milk was ever only put in first to protect the ceramics, but have changed the order since then for better tasting tea. This was a great video and I definitely learned a lot, great job 👏
1:07 milk doesn't go at all
amusing 👌
We already know how to make a proper tea https://youtu.be/N2rfHYq2dSE
Ok? Why are millennials associated with the pyramid tea bag, which was invented by a Gen-Xer? Also, why use a flat bag when Lipton introduced the father of the pyramid bag, the flow-through bag, in the 1950's? I'm guessing that was invented by a member of the humbly named greatest generation.   Secondly, the average tea serving size of 240ml in the US gets no complaint from me, however the average tea serving in the UK is much closer to 150ml...of tea, to which one would add 5ml of milk, per study cited. That's 30-1 not 47-1. While both are significantly less than the weird milk-tea the Té company suggests, your figure is 56% more tea than what most Brits would drink.  At the end the assertion, "I stand for science", falls a bit short with the suggestion of 26ml of milk when in your last test you clearly show three different sizes of teacup each capable of holding more or less tea than the next. Perhaps it would be better to say that you found the "Goldie Locks" ratio to be between 11% - 12% milk by volume. If your total volume (hard to tell from the video since there was no measuring of the steeped tea shown) was 240ml of tea, it's 11% while it would be 12% if your total volume of milk tea is 240ml. At the very least it would be more scientific.   Do not think I will watch this channel again but I do sincerely wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
All Tea Drinkers I know (as a British person myself) put the milk in last, I do believe the cheaper cups may have been the only reason as water then milk certainly appears to be the British way now. Milk goes last.  Like with cereal.
I'm from America. I've never been anywhere else. I've always been in America. Don't use microwaves to make tea. For God's sake. No.
I've been drinking brewed tea for years and I never knew people put milk in it nor that you're suppose to. I love my milkless tea.
Did Pat put a spoon inside the mug to properly heat up the water?!
No milk or sugar, you should put honey in tea
Him: Your tea sucks  Indians: You sure about that!
“Three or four cups a day”   Laughs in British 😂
I don't use milk for my tea
In east Frisia (germany) there is a whole lot more teadrinking than in the UK... I live near that region but still love their tea
All I know tea is tea and that a FACT
I took notes on this for perfect tea
My first time hearing putting milk in tea
matt and his wife are such a lovely couple
Glad to know I've been making tea the right way
You missed another controversial decision point: Does the teabag come out before or after the milk is added? Makes more of a difference than you'd expect.
No normal modern Brit puts the milk in first, we have rioted about this before
a turkish man : What people add milk?
I love everything about this - I'm a tea fan as well, but also the fact that you used your channel and time and research to learn how to make something that would make your wife happy - 10/10 great content.
for some reason the way he puts the milk reminds me a clip of matpat...
Wont the type of milk affect taste of tea?? Chilled Milk vs steamed milk??
The best way to make tea is to throw it in the harbor.
Ginger goes well with tea.
I agree wholeheartedly that best tea is with no milk at all.
*not my britsh self being offended when i read the title*
1 year ago: don't be in the same room without a mask or you'll die! now: drink out the same mug.
In India, we just boil water, tea, herbs & spices, milk & sugar to make tea, had no idea that is not a thing overseas.
just don't use a bag, get the leaves themselves from a shop and put a specific amount in a specific amount of water and put it on the stove and bam, done
meanwhile, us other europeans of the continent, just *dont* add milk to our tea
4:39 from my experience, the handle gets hot depending on the manufacture of the mug. My guess is they make the handle out of a cheaper material in some factories.
you can't MICROWAVE tea, that's disgusting!
I'm English, worked as a barista for a while, avid tea drinker. Never once have I heard that it's tradition to put the milk in first. Always teabag, water, milk, sugar.
what about the variable of the different puring heights as that effects cooling
I am from turkey and i can confirm my mom drinks 5-6 glasses of tea almost everyday.
T-PUNS!
Tom is so funny plz keep him for outher episodes
i dont wanna hear no Americans telling me how to make the perfect cuppa
Tea🍲
For me as a Thai person tea is just hitting me much better than coffee but I still drink both tbh
You should try Chinese style tea and learn how to get tea drunk
No one in Britain puts the milk in first anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!! We’re still one step ahead of you!!!!!!
Maybe it’s because I’m Asian but unless you’re drinking milk tea, milk in any tea tastes terrible lmao
Next video: Is tea soup?
Now that's a good american stand up comedy
Am I the only Brit who puts the milk in last?
Visiting Bangladesh, I've had the best tea over here, no matter whose house I'm visiting. The whole Bengal region is mad about tea, I'm sure that's true for most of South Asia and east asia. They boil the tea in a pot with the leaves, sometimes use jaggery goor (unrefined cane sugar with molasses etc) instead of sugar and use milk powder a lot rather than milk. Tastes amazing. In the UK, malty biscuit Yorkshire tea is the only thing that comes close.
3-4 cups of tea ain't that bad, I avg around a jug a day
Film is over brewed tea sign, but also scale in the water.
The background illustrated for the animation with the food theory things but also trying to look very old timey British is super cute! Kudos to whoever made that!  I say that as a brit! Also as a British person who is also half Iranian (another nation of tea) milk is optional, but a small amount is good, I also prefer to sweeten tea with honey if I sweeten it.
I love how MattPat finds out the we the British used to put the milk in first like way back in the 30s 40s & 50s & he just assumes that in modern day we still behave like such animal's 😂
I think I know why the milk first tea isn't as good, why it tastes sorta "sour".  The same effect that we see in rapidly cooking egg, scrambling, is true in this setting. The boiling water rapidly heats the milk, causing it to begin to spoil. On the other hand, adding it last exposes it to the heat more slowly and prevents the spoiled flavor. That's why adding it second makes it noticeably smoother and richer- you're not cooking the milk (as rapidly). 💖💖 But that's just a theory, a food theory. Bone apple tea
I think on average I have 1 tea once per decade, might be slightly higher
3:00 that's not tea that's an abomination
Ah! The puns! They are qualitea puns, I'll have to chai to make it. The only way out, is brew it. Sure is teadious, but I can do it. Just have to remember: tranquilitea. I'll admit, puns are not my cup of tea, but dang, are they beauteaful. Ok, I'm done. No more steeping in this. I need to be careful, otherwise, I'll find myself in hot water. I'm done being feistea. This was fun, I think it was tearific!
Shareing my opinion: Ice tea is better
If you wanted to go even further, you could have tried different water types and milk types. Just an idea for a future revisit (?)
Lotta sus vibes in this episode
wtf u put MILK?! in your tea?
I miss GameTheorist
at 18:46 matt pat uses the glass cup to dish out hot water, he basicaly pre-heated the glass mug. no surprise its hotter than the others
Okay, I usually adore your food theory videos; but today I was told by my mom I had to comment based on how much I was yelling at the screen. Not because I disagree (I do) but because for perhaps one of the first times ever I feel like you skipped over so much of what would be needed to get to your conclusion.   For one thing, every variable you tested needed to be tested again against all the other variables. You also missed a number of variables you have actively discussed in other videos, as well as others that felt crucial. (What kind of milk should be used? What temperature should the milk be when you pour it in?) You were too limited in some variables (There are so many other kinds of cups people drink tea from!!!) and in at least one place you jumped to a conclusion (Wow, the glass mug keeps the tea hottest. No.... based on what you showed us, you poured hot liquid into the glass, used it to pour into something else, poured more hot liquid into the glass, used it to pour into something else, then poured more hot liquid into the glass. It was not only filled last, but heated in increments. Had all three vessels been the same composition, it would have still been hottest. FURTHER you said, earlier in the same episode... that the tea in the tea pot cooled faster because it was less full than the mug and thus had more surface area. You specifically poured from the glass because it was the smallest.)   There are other things also to take into account as well as... you kept over and over talking about how much was the perfect amount of milk, and perfect steeping time (Actual unchanging numbers) while changing the size of the cups used. A larger cup with more tea needs more milk and more steeping time, for example.  This is why all variables have to be tested against each other. Like I said, I am huge fan of the channel and usually tune in because of how much you over think and overscience. This one just felt... rushed. And I get that it could have been, there may have been time constraints on your guest. It just... I was looking forward to the tea episode as someone who adores tea and drinks all kinds of tea all sorts of ways. But in the end this felt like another Youtube "This is the only proper way to make tea, because we said so" video.  Anyway, sorry for coming across as ranty. Like I said, big fan of not just Food Theory but your other channels as well. Have been for ages. But mom said I should comment instead of just screaming at the TV.  (If it helps, I spend a lot of my youtube time screaming "THIS IS NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS" at the TV in general.   Thank you again for these amazing channels, and once more, sorry for the rant.
I just now discovered that milk in tea is a thing, never saw anyone, anywhere mention anything remotely similar, and I drink tea regularly
You need to put the tea on the top.
Anyone else literally just brew their tea in a mug filled with hot water and drink it without adding a single thing to it?  No? Just me? Okay. 😅
The best way to make tea is in a large batch, cooled and served with ice in a big glass.  Maybe some lemon or sweetener.  Cheers.
Oolong tea! 💜
You forgot Japan. Shame. Ok, I assume there will a follow-up episode. Also for India, Middle East, China, etc.
Theory idea: Do doritos and mountain dew actually have any game-improving nutritional impact? If not, what drink and snack combo is optimal for gaming?
As someone who has been drinking loose leaf for years and has been getting into Gong Fu tea recently I didn't expect to get as much out of this as I did.
This is literally how I've been drinking my tea since I was a teen. I feel SO VALIDATED
Just because it’s the same brand doesn’t mean the taste is different because of the bag. I’ve tasted regular paper, organic paper and loose leaf earl grey from my brand of choice and they all taste vastly different with different bergamot and tea flavors. It’s not the brewing either it even smells different dry.
Twinings brand is super awesome qualitea especially with Earl Grey
Who puts milk in their tea... eww
The Brits had it right then, yeah?  What you're saying is: Those who afforded the more costly cups for tea, poured their milk on top - back in the day.
Ima go out and say it, I dislike tea
My subtitles when he says "why am I here" says why am I hair
Fun fact: teh tarik is the way to drink a tea but with skill. Or using a Chinese method, brewing the flavor till the leaf is come out rich.
Holy tea leaves, I finally have an answer for how much is “a splash”
royalTEA
I'm really surprised the first taste tests were not blind
So... no honey? Sugar? Lemon?
Not talking about Chinese tea while talking about better teas is sinful
Ok but the real ones know the only way to do it is strong sweet tea in a mason jar
British people think you're a psychopath for putting the tea in first
I khew it All along
My gosh I love them >< thank you editors, this was truly beauTEAful
Seriously what is the problem with microwaving the water...hot water is hot water 🙄🤦
You should make a theory to see if dogs like water with avocado pits better he just went for it
Hot water is hot water, so I'm surprised you didn't experiment with microwaved water. And then there's the American way to make tea you didn't touch on: throw teabags in pot of water, bring to boil. It's how we make it, because we make a gallon at a time and drink it from warm all the way to fridge temp. Oh, and sugar, cause milk does NOTHING to tea. Sugar needed to make tea not just dirty water.  But it's not like you did a very through test with the variables. 1, 3, or 5 minutes? Too big of a difference. Once you got 3, you should have done 2.5, 3, 3.5 minutes. 26ml milk as a middle ground? What about 20 and 30ml? Be more precise! You said PERFECT, not "close enough"! GAH!
the fact that hey were sipping out of the same cup lol
Its the opposite here in Australia mate'
Is Yorkshire gold truly the best tea.
It’s just a theory, a BRIT THEORY
There's a problem with pyramid shaped teabags: they're usually made with plastic. Under the heat of hot water, they leach microplastics into your cup. It's generally best to make sure if you can, that your bag doesn't contain plastics.
Matpat, the glass cup was hottest because you tempered it by using it to fill the other two cups. You basically pre-heated the glass cup.
If you wanted tea knowledge, I would think asia has britain beat for length of experience
I'm not kidding I drink four cups of tea a day too
I'm on MatPat's team for no milk in tea. Why would you work so hard to make the tea good, strong but not too bitter and then dilute it with milk? Yuck.
wtf is taylors tea???? it's got to be yorkshire!!!!!
Do a theory on bone lab
What a tearific episode, thanks.
Southern Sweet Tea is the only correct tea and i will not be taking and questions. Thank you.
Hi
2nd time asking how long can you live of soup of pho
I would have liked to see variations in temperature. 200, boiling, 180. I know many teas have suggestions, but that could have been tested!
I learned not to let it sit to long the hard way...
I have a better method. Boil some water, pour it into a mug along with the tea bag. Forget you ever did that and come back an hour later to find an extremely bitter cup of tea. Discard the tea bag and add milk until the bitterness gets to a level which suits your taste. It's good enough to stop you from worrying about letting the tea steep for too long.
I prefer dry creamer over milk. The malt taste just hits different.
this video basically proves. that i make the best tea. because this is literally how i have alway made tea.  i normally use a pot, i alway put milk last, and i normally only wait 3 minutes. and i only use a kettle, no evil human uses a microwave. and i normally use a mug but i prefer glass.
There is not a single person in the entire commonwealth who puts this much thought into their cup of tea.
So... Why didn't you taste tea that was made with microwaved water, vs boiled on a stove or in electric kettle?  I'd imagine it'd make no difference... But then again, you said the same about many other things.
anyone who puts milk first will be hung drawn and quatered.
Did you forget amount of sugar?
So I have been doing everything correctly besides the fact that I oversteep my tea. So I’m pretty much there! Nice!
Matpat: *Tries to make the perfect tea* Also Matpat: *Doesn't use Yorkshire tea* What you doing, man?
So my oddest tea experience was a tea i hated but my significant orher at the time loved and they had it with milk and sugar and i dident. And i tried it their way and it was suddenly good. I now think some teas are blended for milk and suger and others are ment for no additions.
The 'tea' in teabags consist of the dust from the floor where tea was stored ;)
Try kratom tea u have to be 18 to try it tho research it first it's great
Teabags? Milk? Barbarians! ;)
Only four?
Despite being born and raised in the U.S. I have never heated my tea water in the microwave
I'm sorry Stephanie, I have to heat my water up in the microwave 😭 I don't have a kettle and I don't trust myself to boil water in a pot
Ah yes I hate it when my cup cracks in two when I pour tea 😂
I use an electric kettle, no sugar no milk just honey.
im a brit but i actually never put my milk on the bottom, i always thought that the teabag goes in, then the water, sugar and milk last!
Food theory idea: is soy actually dangerous for males?
Milk in tead is so good tho
I would like to note an interesting thing I discovered living with my grandparents in Spain, they add cold milk first to the bottom of the coffee cup, but don't stir after they've added the coffee, this means that you end up drinking boiling coffee and then finally cold milk. This can be counter acted by "sucking" the coffee in, instead of just tipping the cup into your mouth.
I swear everytime I see a glitch effect on any of these channels I expect some secret
Milk first/second? - the only important thing is to have the leaves introduced to the water at 100oC. If you add brewed tea to milk that's fine.
Milk on top is the best
well turkish tea ways are different  we have 2 different pots one for water one for the tea  we just pour the tea leaves on the smaller teapot and add boiling water let it sit there on the fire once a few minutes pass just pour tea and some water if you like add sugar sometimes a small lemon slice and its done NO MİLK
Not sure why one would put tea with both water and milk.  Plain water and plain milk together does not taste good.  Plain milk and tea I do not believe would taste very good either.  Water and tea is how I have had it and that is fine.  An addition of milk would seem to just make it less enjoyable.
Um the fact that I lift my pinky when I drink anything in a bottle or cup ..... am I British now?
putting milk in tea is wrong.
all this tea and no sweetener added? I wanted to see if honey or sugar was better (I already know my preference, but what does science say?)
That's why of tips are now pyramid
Tea, Sugar, Hot water and then coconut and rice milk
the worst mug for tea is novelty ones generally they have small pockets of hot liquid that when you get to it it burns you
I don't know a single English person who puts the milk in first!
Milk in second allows you to compensate for badly brewed tea as well adding less to weaker tea for example.
What about additional bags, I typically use double bags to get a better flavor
I haven't even finished the video, but I know the answers 1) loose leaf 2) zero 3) see 2 (though for ingredients, I do water, honey, then tea leaves, not for taste, just for ease) 4) until you're done drinking it 5) my go to is ceramic, but I feel glass would taste better
Me sipping on my instant tea  Cool story bro
Spot on the splash.
You had the perfect opportunity to call it hot leaf juice and you said warm leaf water.
Balkan tea:boil water pour the mug, put the tea bag in,let it soak/cool after a little bit put sme lemon juice and a little honey and walla✨
I'm watching this as a British person, and I'm dying. Americans don't know $h!t about tea.
You should try pouring the water on top of the tea.
13:00 wait, excuse me. If you have 1/4 cup milk and 1 cup water that's a 1:5 ratio
As a British person I'm incredibly confused by all the comments about us putting the milk in first - I've never known anyone here to do that, it always goes in last!
no
Everyone up north makes Tea the way in the video, well done for figuring out that the southerners are objectively wrong compared to us superior up north
test
We do pour the milk on top!!!!
As a British girl I easily drink 5 - 7 cups a day
I’m surprised he didn’t discuss types of milk (almond milk, cows milk, cashew milk, oat milk) or milk percentage (skim milk, 1%, 2%, 10%, cream). Would have changed the final result significantly.
Your tick tock tea offended me
11:06  Pulling an Abbacchio
i am not from Uk but i love breakfast tea uk of course and i didn't use milk for once but honey i was love in instant
im american, so disregard my opinion if you want, but i just heat water up in the microwave, pour it into a mug w/ tea bag and sugar.
no sane person puts milk in first and what you have done is the normal way of making tea also yourkshire tea is better
I’m British and I’ve never put the milk in first so have I been doing it differently from the norm?
I do Tea, or some times Hot Chacolate.
theres difrint kinds of tea
Us estonians boil the water and then put the boiled water into the cup and the little tea bag into the cup also (we don't put milk into tea)
Water is very important to the final taste of tea due to water’s mineral composition and memory the most optimal I have found imo is remineralised distilled (restructured) water
missed the chance to say Royaltea
To get the best tea infused hot water the method is to get the most infusion in the lest amount  of time possible and that can be done by vibrating the tea bag at the surface of the water (leaving half of the tea bag out of the water) in a vertical motion which creates some what of a negative pressure pulling the teafushion downwards ,,,,, thats if your using tea bags
Now what type of coffee is best over all, what cup size and shape, what kind of filters, AND do you pour creamer in the bottom before coffee or creamer on top lol
You guys forgot to take into account hard or soft water and temperature of the water
1st of all y’all drinking your tea wrong, the sorcerer should either go upside down on top of the cup or the cup upside down on top sorcerer because the sorcerer is not for carrying your cup around on is so you can pore some of your tea in to rapidly cooling it due to its large surface area and shallowness, then you pore that sorcerered cooled tea back in to your cup cooling your cup of tea to the perfect drinking temperature
The British won't understand the concept of flavours even if they colonize the best food regions of the planet for over 3 centuries. Really a stupid and low bar to measure tea qualitea.
Figure this would be good to watch while I drink my tea
Why didn’t you do water temp…
7:15
Nah. Never put milk in first. Very rarely do I see people do that …. It’s wrong
What about the type of milk?
ok but like who still puts milk first- ive always put milk after the water 💀
ireland is full of tea ☕🍵
The Boston tea part joke at 6:29 is so underrated
The perfect cup of tea is no tea.
Nice TEAhory
I agree with you Mat, the correct amount of milk in tea is no milk.
They prolly heard about milk tea and just guessed how to make it ;-;
How dare these people disrespect british tea.
Do you guys add milk to tea? Grose
Food Theory! Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
3-4 cups a day? Or as we say in Britain, breakfast!
Hello Food Theory, when i was younger I used to not like spinage soup, so I used to guess how many spoons it would take to eat it up. The question is: what is the best method to guess the amount of spoons it will take? (Im swedish so my english is not so good)
OK I have a new theory Me and my friends debited about  is ice cream a solid or liquid? you don't bite the ice cream and u don't drink it so is it solid or liquid? Also is it just thick liquid or just beraly solid  P.s I'm sorry for my bad grammar
if you take off the avocado skin, wrap it in a wet paper towel put it in a ziplock and chuck it in your closet, it'll sprout in a week!!!!!!
On game theory do zardy's maze  please
I usually don't like tea but also, I've been making it wrong... (I'm the blasphemous person who squeezed my tea bags. I'll need to try the perfect cup)
One way to make sure there's a low (if any) amount of Tannins in your tea is by cold brewing it #NotMyFoodTheory
Lost me at milk 😆
The correct answer is milk belongs in cereal not tea 😂 and loose leaf tea all day!
Gonna need this for Cocoa next
Green tea with just lemon is best tea
I'm going to troll here and say eastern tea is better.  Give me a silk oolong any day.  And for all that is good in the world, do not use boiling hot water!  That would be as bad as using boiling hot water to make coffee.
So India has been making tea optimally since forever.
Wait? Why did the pyramid keep being recommended over the loose leaf?
am i the only english person who hates tea or maybe its my cameroon ancestors
Would have love to see an test on cup shape similar to the wine episode!
Stop saying us Brits do it wrong, we haven't put milk in first for generations! Every detail you mentioned me, my family, my partners family, etc have already been doing for years. 😂
Isint tea just leaf broth
3-4 a day is normal
Okay, now do it again with green tea from a traditional Japanese perspective!
🎶happy birthday to you🎶🎶happy birthday to you🎶🎶happy birthday oh happy birthday🎶happy birthday to you🎶(sorry. I'm late by 1 day)
Tea originated from China and the Indian Assam tea is actually a hybrid of a wild tea plant and a stolen tea tree from the Yunnan province area. I would love to see you guys enter the realm of Chinese cha ceremonies.
👈Lactose intolerant. What about nondairy?
Did Matt Pat just say they'd DRUNK TOO MUCH TEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As a Britt I can tell you that it is not possible to Drink too much tea!!!!
I've been drinking tea for about a year now, as coffee began giving me HORRENDUS heartburn. I was very apprehensive about using milk in my tea, but always felt like my plain tea with sugar was too light, if that makes sense. I went out on a limb and added a splash of milk to the top of the cup, and was pleasantly surprised. It didn't counteract the flavor, but instead complimented and gave it a very satisfying creaminess.   I figured, well the British have been doing this for literally hundreds of years. They've got to be on to something, and brewed tea has been my favorite drink since. I would say out of all Americans that brew 'tea' the British would probably be pretty happy with my methods, aside from the fact that I do not use a tea pot (yet!) xD  I will have to try putting the milk in the bottom again, though, and see if I notice a difference. The only reason I began putting it on top is because I didn't want the milk to cool the water to the point of ruining the steep, so I'm glad to see my method is the generally agreed 'correct' way.
Agreed. Best milk in tea is no milk
You forgot clockwise or anti-clockwise swirling as this is a VERY big argument in England
Hot leaf water= hot leaf juice......... uncle Iroh would be furious.
No no no you got to use Yorkshire tea bags that sink to the bottem
I'm a bit disappointed you glossed over the kettle vs microwave debate. The only actual scientific reason for preferring the kettle would be the fact that water in the microwave is heated less evenly, but that can be easily fixed by stirring...?
Tea without milk is better as you said
Iroh after reading the title: your tea in nothing but hot leaf juice!  Also, I wanna say that tea originated in China. Legend says that an emperor and his servant were under a tree. The servant was boiling water and a leaf fell in the water. The emperor, who was an herbalist, tried the concoction and thus tea was born. I did a project about how tea became an important part of British culture and it’s really interesting. I forgot some of it, but I think a duchess from Portugal grew up having tea as the perfected drink and others drank tea from her influence. I grew up drinking chai, but without the spices or masala. We boil water and add the tea leaves and milk (I don’t brew the tea so idk the order) and then when the tea is a tan-ish color with a layer of milk cream on top, we pour it into mugs and add sugar (brown to be specific). Then we eat it with a biscuit called cake rusk (rusk is pronounced without the k, so it’s rus). I plan on trying many more recipes of tea to try and see my taste preferences since this is the tea I drank growing up and I like to experience new things. The tea project made me want to try other variations.
The fact that I’m British and i don’t even use milk in my tea 😂😂😂
I've Never heard of a British person willingly putting the milk in first. So I'm not sure why this was the assumption here?  If anything you'd get accused of being a psychopath.
Wait.………. you’re supposed to put milk with tea???? I’ve just been drinking *”water soup”*
As English tik tik tea evil
Sweet tea all the way
Make turkish tea my guy.  Turkish Tea:   Get a Caydanlik (a smaller pot nestled on top of a larger pot. The lower and larger pot is where to boil the water, while the upper pot is where to put the loose tea leaves in water), Boil water, Fill 50% of cup with boiling water, fill 20% with the liquid in the upper pot (make sure to get fragments of tea leaves in the cup), stir a lot, either add 2 cubes or sugar or honey using a wooden spoon.
Matt, can you drop a link to where we can get that jacket?
3-4 cups a day? Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those up.
No this is how to make tea Turn on the electric kettle Put two teaspoon of sugar  Then the circular tea bag  Once the kettle is done pour the water in until there is about  4cm of room ad in a quick poor of mil so then there is still room for it not to spill but the tea is a light carmel colour and stir (I am british have been since I was born and still live in Britain)
Chinese people know tea ☕. Brits are just wanna-bes
The Boston Tea Party got me
we dont need to update, we already use milk on the top!
They are really shitea puns
6:53 missed opportunity to countdown from three, tea, one.
It's the same as adding milk to your coffee.
I never knew people use MILK for tea with no SUGAR
im surprised matpat didnt say *why* you put the milk in after; milk coagulates at 60 degrees C (as stated in his own video about tony the tiger) and by letting it go in first you're scorching it with 100 degrees. putting it in after allows the water to cool off before having the milk go in.
no one puts milk first in england
That tiktok lady was the clickiest clickbait troll ever and she won. No one makes tea like that
Bro looks like Bob saget
asians literally perfected tea lol
What what happened if you brewed tea in a coffeemaker? 🤔
But what kind of milk should be used though ? Red green blue…..👀
Nah, I prefer coffee.
There are two reasons why flat tea bags are so bad. Space during brewing is only half of it. The other half is the tea itself. Tea bag tea is ground and therefore oxidizes a lot more than whole leaves.
Having boiled and then microwaving tea there isn't a huge difference. At least not to me.  For me though I don't add anything to my tea, I just drink the tea by itself
I wonder if they are going to test the Chinese and Japanese methods as well?
3:51 yay my country
So, something I've noticed with my tea since I steep the tea without a strainer in my cast iron tea pot and pour it through a strainer into my cup, it tends to come out hotter since the tea pot itself was used to heat the water. I've found that adding the milk first, tempering it with a small amount of tea and then adding the rest in is better because if I add the milk last I've had it curdle before. I haven't had this issue with rice milk which is what I prefer but it's happened a good number of times with cow milk.
You should try making it the Pakistan way with ghur(type of raw sugar) . We call it Doodh Pati
What temperature water did you use? Very curious so I can replicate the perfect cup of tea. 😊
I present to you Polish tea:  Teabag first(pyramid shaped). Boiling water onto the teabag. Take teabag out nearly immediately and squeeze it out. NO MILK. Add Sugar/Honey if you want. Slice of lemon.
They only sipped a little bit of tea from the top, so I think that's why milk on top after water tasted better. It's good for the initial taste.
milk doesnt go into tea tho
Question because I never liked chicken noodles soup my grandma gave me chocolate ice cream instead and it helped so would chocolate ice cream help you get over your cold better? (Because cold for fever and chocolate to boost mood)
The BBC did something like this a few years ago in a lab. They used different kinds of water and different colored mugs. So maybe if you do a part 2 of this you could try those out  https://youtu.be/Fhuc6qOGNPc
I'm happy you pronounced Assam right 😊😊
not 20% of the watchers not even drinking tea
NO NO NO NO NO!!!! YOU PUT THE SUGAR AND TEA BAG IN FIRST! THEN HOT WATER!! AFTER THAT YOU MAKE IT AS STRONG AS YOU WANT WHILE STIRING IT! THEN ADD THE MILK AND STIR AGAIN! WHAT IS THIS CRAP! My great nan is rolling over in her grave at this.
In Germany they tell you to steep the tea for up to like 10 minutes, which I guess explains why I have to put in 3 spoons of sugar to taste anything but hot water
No brit I know has ever had milk first, I hereby revoke the British status of the guy in the video
You need an Asian person to perform gong fu tea
You think 3-4 cups a day are bad? Try 5-7 mugs in *ONE* sitting.
I'm absolutely with MatPat. No mik. Just sugar.
This confused my british brain…. No-one in Britain buts the milk in first 👀  Also the volume displaced by the tea bag = the volume of milk to add if you want to be scientific about this 🤣
Actually you haven't upended British tradition. High Victorian society put milk in second, due to there higher quality bone china. It was the poorer society with there cheaper porcelain put the milk in first. The more you Know. Another test for next time is colour. Apparently a red cup will make the tea Sweeter. Try a colour test next time. This is a message from a random from British man.
Matpat you’re in a show that has been nominated for an Emmy. How do you feel?
Wait, why not use microwave? I refuse to believe water remembers how it was heated once it is heated to the right temperature.
I feel like temperature of water could have been accounted for here as well...
3-4 More like 5-7 for me
Watching this from Assam, India while drinking a warm cup of Assam tea 🍵
You should also try to make some middle eastern tea it is close to how tea is made in the UK except the tea there doesn't use milk and it uses a higher concentration of " Leaf juice" and is amazing also they don't use tea bags but they use a kettle and the tea leafs to creat the concoction. Would recommend traying it will change your life.
hm... what about how much water we put
You missed one round!! One lump or two?!
Best yea in my opinion is East Frisian (North West Germany) Tea, where you pour the tea on top of a Kluntje (compressed sugar) and then add half a teaspoon of cream. The slowly melting sugar is enough for several of the small teacups used and adds a nice layering effect because you traditionally don’t stir the tea. First you have the nice creamy layer, then the tea with a little bit of both and then the last sip with a nice sweet aftertaste. There’s really a lot of East Frisian Culture connected to these tea times and the East Frisian Language also shows a lot of similarities to old English (this video shows that really well: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OeC1yAaWG34 ) And a lot of the tea culture actually also goes to the roots of British tea culture, so I can only recommend East Frisian and Frisian Tea Time for all the tea lovers in this comment section.🫖☕️❤️
I agree with MatPat. Milk in Tea leaves an absolutely disgusting aftertaste in your mouth, so the best one is just tea itself xD
Y'all are teaching me more than my science class
Ask a Chinese person to get the correct opinion.
No sugar!!!? Help I'm from South Australia is this weird in other places?
It seems that I will have to check the best time to steep my loose leaf tea myself
Just wanna throw out there, tea purchased in loose leaf form tends to be higher quality and you CAN get a pyramid shaped diffuser for it... So that's probably the best option for how to steep basically any tea just varying Temps and times by type
So we have the optimal steep time, milk amount and order, and optimal vessel for steeping with. Now just have to try it with different types of tea. And sweetness level. Everyone will have their preferences here. Personally I prefer Earl Grey with milk and a couple "2" heaping teaspoons of sugar.
nice. Now do the same woth Polish Pierogi
when making tea in a teapot your supposed to warm the pot not for some fancy hoidy toidy reason but to prevent it over cooling the tea once the pot is warmed you can pour the water into your cups to have them warmed whilst you add fresh hot water back to the now warmed pot to commence brewing    also you created a flaw in your cup testing method  you dosed the water using the glass cup but that meant you also preheated the glass where as the others where not they where also given water which had lost heat into the glass skewing results
Hey I was just watching the video and I was wondering what's the best way to stack a dishwasher?
As a daily tea drinker brit. I'm happy to see I am drinking my tea correctly.  Teabag and sugar. Then water. Brew for 2-3 Minutes. Then Milk.
This is basically Matpat thinking there was going to be no difference because it’s just tea and being proved so wrong.  Ps. Most British people put milk after tea
upended the whole history of british tea - as if normally people drink their tea milk first.... :') normal amounts of tea guys. fun epi tho
I would have loved a teapot vs in cup brew with both milk before and after comparison because my head cannon is it makes less difference with a teapot because of where the brewing takes place.
water always goes in first and i can prove it as such  tea should be brewed at around 80c too hot you over extract the tanins and it tastes bitter too low and it under extracts and results in a weaker brew  adding milk then water will cool down the water below the brewing tempreture   secondly color is a important indicator in how much milk to add for a set strength so milk last alows you to guage this more effectivley
Sorry, but traditions aside... NO-one is putting the milk in first over hear, and haven't since Victoria died. signed -- the entire UK
And source of water also makes a difference (thub water, branded waters, directly from spring of water)
MatPat can you save JankyLanky from the giant king crab Reginald?
bruhhh the puns
Ngl the real controversial test would be trying the brands in the UK and deciding ur favourite! That’s the real hot button issue! I’m a Yorkshire/twinnings gal
Uncle Iroh approves this episode
Drink chai instead Use tapal Danedar pati And olpers milk
Im on TEAm Matt in the milk war😅
I’m a bit disappointed and dissatisfied with this theory for it does not address the question, “can keurig tea pods contend with bagged tea?”.
0:56 leaf wthaer :how could someone say something so horrible
thank you for the puns, they were epic
Me: *Laughs in Chinese*
should've filtered the water
I mean I've never met a British person that puts the milk first and when they have they've been ridiculed that tradition is extremely outdated. These experiment has just proven that the common way to make tea in the uk currently is correct.
I am sick and I got Chinese medicine and it’s tree tea
Chinese tea best
As a person who doesn't drink chai, I have no idea what I'm doing listening so intently but oh boy is it slightly concerning -
Just like many Brits in the comments, I'm outraged that you think we put the milk in first in the modern age! We stopped doing that many yonks ago, like you said after our mugs were less likely to crack or stain.   The final tea is how everyone I know serves tea! 😹
Good news: we already add the milk last, at least that's what all the people I know do.
My conclusion is that this is the best episode so far, scientifically.   My reasoning is solely dependent on one factor:    CatPat
not sure if using the glass mug to measure the amount of boiling water to add to the other mugs would make the glass one be the hottest, it's essentially getting boiling water in it twice and then a 3rd and last time meaning it had the shortest time to cool down as well before consumption ( unless you used a separate glass mug top measure)
As an Asian person, I'm not a big fan of milk tea (it has its place), since I believe tea should be enjoyed at its most pure and basic. Hot water, and tea leaves, but don't steep it too long or you will end up with overcooked leaf soup.
Love the theory. I'm actually part of #teamnomilk too! So MatPat, you're not alone my friend. Since I don't put milk in my tea, I'm wondering if: I should put the teabag first, then the hot water OR hot water first, then the teabag?
if it comes to steeping i dip my bag in and press it softly 2 times with a spoon it makes for a strong tea with no sour acid flavour and makes for a very short steep time a tea pot  gives you weak and cold tea
Turkish people drink more tea than British people yet British are the ones famous for it 🙄🙄
I'm with Matt Patt keep the milk out my tea!
A DIFFERENT MUG EACH TIME FOR THE SAME DRINK ?! No. You can just fill it up again with hot water and put your tea bag (and whatever you want such as sugar) and enjoy. No need to keep dirtying more and more dishes that’s ridiculous
yall mix milk in your tea?
Steph and her tea burglary
16:30 Y’know ok, fine. We bow to our overseas former overlords or whatever, great, *here’s our taxes.*
i always drink my tea like that: bag in the mouth, then drink warm water, wait and then drink it finaly xD
Matpat: she is going through like 3 or 4 cups a day  Indian: you gotta get those numbers up. those are rookie numbers
Great episode, i love tea, but now what about, green tea, or chia tea, or herbal tea?
That sauna joke at around 9 minutes, made me think @matpat should really make a theory about sauna myths and try to use different kinds of saunas for it (electric and wood burning sauna stoves and an infrared sauna). I don't know which channel it should air, but it still might be fun. Or would it be too "mythbustery"? Even better, come to Finland to make the episode as a GT not live :D
Matt: ‘Tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice’ Steph: ‘How could a member of my family say something so horrible?’
My toxic trait is thinking I’m better than everyone else because I own the same Target tea cups with the letters.
Make an episode only on green tea!!! 😍
So as an American  I can safely say that Southern sweet tea is the best. Super simple, Ice, tea bags, and a boatload of sugar with a touch of lemon.
I am disappointed to find no references to the top 2 tea drinking countries in this video (tea consumption per capita)
How about you learn to make tea from INDIANS the place where it actually comes from? We actually put tea in the kettle and then filter it out rather than using tea bags. Oh and it contains like 90% milk.
I wonder if why milk after tea is better is cuz when the hot tea is added into the milk it kinda curdles more?? Dunno. Im no scientist.
You forgot the most important test: does boiling vs microwaving make a difference?  The answer is OF COURSE NOT!!! All you are doing is heating up WATER. Just WATER. Not some complicated mixture that unravels proteins at different rates using different reactions, just WATER. All you are doing is imparting the rules of thermodynamics to MAKE WATER HOT, one through metal conduction and the other through microwaves exciting water molecules. Anyone who shames and looks down on microwaves is a willful elitist and wants to be posh over being correct.  Be brave. Use microwaves.
I cannot abide this unscientific microwave slander
But what about if you move the flat tea bag up and down, thus moving the leaves around. Also, am I weird for not adding milk to my tea? I TOTALLY agree with Matt. Milk weirdly "waters" it down. This video left me with so many questions 😂 #nomilksquad Editing this a 3RD TIME (never comment mid episode), I'm shocked that the cup made no difference. Glasses make a huge difference in draft beer, at least I believe so. Guiness made their own glass for that reason. I would have thought tea was the same. Another food theory???
indians just boil loose tea leaves with water and then boil it again with milk to make it stronger. this is the most common way you see everywhere in homes and out on the tea stalls on the streets 🤷🏽‍♀️
I don’t know why I saw this? I’m a coffee guy ☕️
Thai Tea; a favorite
Iroh would be hurt by you calling it "hot leaf water"
Mzuzu tea is the best tea.
I'm with Matt, best milk in tea is no milk
Works for me. Though I have not used milk in my tea before.
What should the temperature of the milk be for best flavor?
3-4 cups...try 3-4 pots O.O also, i think maybe the glass cup was hotter because you poured the hot water in and then dumped it into the other cups twice. this is an old method used for cooling water to make green tea or warming up a cup so your tea doesn't cool when you pour it. the temp drops around 10-ish degrees F when you pour it in a new container.
My dad's ex was from the Philippines. She told me that they boil tea bags in milk. Never looked up if it was true or not, but I really like it. Camomile boiled in milk sounds real good rn being that I can't sleep.
British people don't actually drink tea from cups, they have a device in their mouth that pours a constant flow of tea into their gullet.
What ? no tea pun counter?
Asking this at the start of the video. Does pouring hot water in your mug/pot first to warm it up, pouring that water out, then pouring more hot water over the tea improve or change the taste? I read it in a novel once.
FYI many of those pyramid tea bags can leach microplastics in your tea.  Just buy tea and use a tea pot or a tea strainer for your cup.
Avocados can honestly take almost 3 months to show signs of a little root poking out. The orientation of the seed mattered on the one I got to sprout, because the seed was already split naturally when I sliced my fruit open to eat it. I knew on looking at it that it was 'the one', though I'd tried a couple different times before just to experiment on the potential. The seed that grew my little sapling had no other distinctive qualities to it in addition to the small opening and the not so scientific "feeling", but they take a long while, and _will_ split (in my seed's case, split even wider) when shooting their roots from this little 'nucleus' looking thing that isn't visible before splitting. I typically would maintain the water just above 3/4s of the total height of the seed which, when it finally sprouted roots, did so around that level. Be patient, and if you can find it make sure the line where it might split is vertical to "encourage" activity. (That probably doesn't help anything, but my two year old plant child is already 5' tall, needs a trim and a pot upgrade. 😵‍💫)  It likes to be hydroponic while continuing to develop the roots before switching to a training pot, just make sure no naughty small things hurt/eat it while it begins the upward process, though you will need to do the scary thing, and behead it at a specific height you'll want to look up. 6-7 inches iirc? Even the first leaf if it has one. I was legitimately worried about killing it, but it not only survived, it thrived. 😅
It would be funny if mat pat is makeing fake videos
Ya'll forgot Southern Tea. Can't believe it.
You are most definitely using the wrong shape vessel for most of the testing which DOES matter. Especially in the addition of milk. There’s even a proper pour method that is vessel dependent. Teacup physics
I never knew milk was commonly put in regular tea I thought it was only for ‘milk tea’ or for boba tea the more you know ig
Wait… MatPat I am British and I, myself, and everyone I have ever known have always put in the milk on top! :O
Did they forget about the water they used to steep the tea?  Mineral water, filtered, tap, etc.
no British person would be caught dead putting the milk in first, doing something like that will get you exiled
I have heard Gong Fu Cha is the best way, and that British way has a lot of flaws I will come back and edit this comment once I finish the video  Well no mention of traditional chinese tea, thatr is ok but maybe a comparison between gong fu cha, british tea, and other methods is in order
I’m bored so before you tell me milk first or last was better imma predict it. There’ll be a difference. Milk first tea second will be better because there is more tea so the tea will blend the milk and tea. Now I’ve never tried milk in my tea (yes I’m American I can see the Brit’s frowning at this sentence) but once this vid is done I’ll try it
what about sugar? do you put sugar into the tea and if so is cube or granulated better?
Tea is just water that is dirty in a very specific way
Oliver: Mommy I need to go potty Matt: Not now son, I'm making (lightning strikes) TEA.      anybody get the Invader Zim reference?
So i have a food theory, because i literally cant figure this out and iv tried looking everywhere:  Why does drinking hot drinks cause your back to feel like its in pain?  like hot cocoa or tea (sometimes it happens with food as well but drinks seem to cause it more often for me specifically)  Is there some sort of biological/chemical reaction to cause the back/spine to, essentially, go "nope" or is there something else going on...?
Rooibos tea
Loose leaf is the best way to go. It can also be used twice so it lasts longer.
Bro British ppl can determine the difference in tea that my eyes WITH glasses cant even see
I don't think this was mentioned, but tea bags don't use actual tea leaves, they use the leftover stuff from loose leaf and pyramid bags. That's why they're far weaker
As an Aussie here it was very enjoyable to sip my hot cuppa while watching this, even paused to make a second ! I love so much that I hate when I do keto, intermediate fasting purely because I love having 4- 7 milk teas through out the day
What about the water temperature? And tea leaves to water ratio?
You didn't do your literature review! Read "the lady tasting tea" by David Salsburg.
I dont use milk lol
Haha pleb imagine using milk do it the southern way and boil water, then put it and any flavor of your tea, then wait till it's brown, once it's brown put it in and drinking tub and then add water to fill it up to to brim then put as mutch sugar that your gut thinks alright, shake it and your done wait for it to cool down put some ice in it and drink
Heating water in the microwave is not a horrible way to boil water. It’s actually a tiny bit more efficient than a stovetop
I agree with Mat Pat.  Milk doesn't belong in tea and I do enjoy a nice cuppa.
я пил чай и увидел ето
The British have not been putting the milk in first for a long time lol. In fact, putting the milk in first is a quick way to make a British person angry 😂 this whole video just made me think of "Proper Tea" by Doc Brown though 😂🤣
In defense of microwaving water to make tea, sometimes you don't have access to a kettle.
Ask a British guy about tea?  Come on... my wife if Chinese, and specifically from Yunnan province.  That's where tea is _from_ , and the tea culture is much more ingrained. And come on, how can we take your contest seriously when you use tea BAGS ?
19:58 full summary.
Actually tea was invented in japan uk got it Later
I can already see Master Wu clicking the subscribe button along with Iroh and Master Splinter
Long time watcher and first time commenter of Food Theory. I loved this episode. As a (n American) tea-drinker, this leveled up my tea game!  I already did the kettle and putting in milk after the tea (mostly by trial-and-error, not because I /knew/). But, knowing the best times to steep tea, to default to the triangle tea bags, and the amount of milk to put in, well, I tried adding those three things to my tea regime just tonight for my partner and I and we both exclaimed how /perfect/ it was! Thank you!
Hot take I put coffee creamer in my tea
im sorry but you put milk in tea??? i thought it was just flavored water!!!!!
Good episode idea is to find out what establishment has the better coffee, sorry if this is already a episode I just started watching your Channel but so far I like it
Matpat we’re the hot ones video I have been waiting
This is quite interesting and funny to me as a Canadian. My families method was this:  - boil water - splash a little bit of boiling water into the teapot and splash it around - insert teabag of choice (pyramid tea bags weren't really a thing in our area) - fill tea pot with boiling water keeping a small amount in the kettle. - when tea is read pour remaining hot water into mug and splash it around before dumping it out -pour tea - add sweatener if desired - add splash of milk and enjoy tea  We were always told that warming the ceramics first was key as then their tea wouldn't get temperature shock and it was better at dissolving sweeteners.   Now maybe this doesn't matter as much in households that don't keep their house temp at 12-15 degrees.
You make the worst dad jokes
i need a theory talking about the Waffle House Index, like is it accurate and stuff
Stay away from my nature water and I won’t pour my coffee machine on you…..
I am sad that you didn't use the French press to prepare tea. It's the objectively best way to prepare tea and save so many tea leaves from being wasted!
I'm still waiting for a Helluva Boss theory over on film theory.
What exactly is wrong with heating water in the microwave? Is it the lack of control in how hot you can get the water, like too hot or to cold? I feel that milk should be optional. Like coffee it's good with or without milk.
Matpat, I also don't put milk in my tea
Best milk is ABSOLUTELY no milk.
I steep for at least 10m, squeeze the bag, and add ~1mL of milk
me not drinking tea while watching this
“She merely adopted tea, but others they were born in it, molded by it.” *presents a British person*  … asians 👁👄👁 wtf
Food Theory: How to make the perfect cup of tea!  Me, watching this with a cup of tea: Interesting
Y’all failed to test if the microwave heating actually changed the quality of the tea. You just assume, that’s bad science mr matpat. Maybe microwave tea is better than kettle tea. Come on.
Apparently I’m the only one in my FAMLY who has never had milk in tea
I prefer my tea in the harbor
They never stuck their pinky out
Uncle Iroh approves.
I was just making some tea when I pressed this video and now I think my chai is gonna be ruined or poisoned or overpriced or something.
The only tea I drink is iced 🥶 🥱
Ok, but making a proper British brew.  You put the teabag and sugar in the mug. Boiling water, and a dash of milk while it brews.  But tea is very objective. We all have our preferences. 1 sugar, Soy milk, builders brew etc  Then you need to consider brands. Yourkshire, pg tips, supermarket values.
they should try boiling the milk also one at room temperature milk and one with cold milk
Lol, here is one you don't seem to have thought of:  I brew it in my COFFEE MAKER (well, it used to be my dad's coffee maker before he passed away in 2013- but I am allergic to coffee, so I invented a reason to use it) when I plan to have more than 1 cup a day.    It's also good when I can't get catnip teabags (those have to be ordered specifically and are far too expensive right now), I can just put loose leaf organic catnip in the place for coffee to go, in a coffee filter and brew my catnip tea that way, if I plan to have more than 1 cup a day.  If I have 1 cup, I just use a stainless steel ball to hold my tea leaves in the hot water after it boils.  I usually have to add some other sort of herbal tea when making the catnip tea, though- because brewing straight catnip tea in a house with 2 cats (or even 1) is ASKING for disaster and chaos. Even some dogs act up when they smell catnip. You WILL be attacked (also, things in the house might get broken and it really looks like a warzone..... Making that mistake 1 time was enough to traumatize me. I will forever remember to put some other herbal tea in with it) if you only brew catnip tea without some other herb.
4:55 TEeeeaaaa *runs out of breath of laughter*
The fact that you didn't open this video with an uncle Iron reference is a crime against humanity!
What kind of milk was used?
15:46 the happy hop-pat
So there is Plen-TEA, Of Tea Puns in this Video, I like Drinking Tea Myself,  Its a great Drink!  13:40 My Mother likes no Milk in Tea, I like Milk in Tea, Its the way it should be, So Sorry MattPatt, But… Milk in Tea is just the way to Drink Tea!  18:57 MattPatt: *I JUST STAND* *FOR SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE!* Also MattPatt: Spills the Tea, *LITERALLY* {MattPatt Literally Spilled the Tea} *INNIT!*
Fun fact: Tea in some countrys was considered the devil's drink until the pope drank it and was like hey this is good man!
So close to a avatar last Airbender joke. Should of been" hot leaf juice" quote from Iroh himself
I hope that various British YouTubers and other content creators see this video, including CDawgVA.
1:25 If this channel ever does a video on a food or meal including fish, I hope that MatPat makes a "gill-ty" pun.
And then there's Midwesterners brewing tea in a reused pickle jar by leaving it in the sun all day.
am i the only person who knows that that happy farm thing with that mother is just a rip  off knock off version of the leviathans from supernatural the show it ticks me off that these people get away with this stuff its the same thing the whole story the idea is just a copy and everyone ignores me i know a lot of things
No Southern American sweet iced tea?
Milk? Wtff
What about heating the milk before adding it to the tea? I always do that because I take forever to finish my hot drinks. I preheat my cup as well.
That first taste test should’ve been a blind test tbh
am i the only one that wonders why theirs a Muppet in the thumb nail
as some one whos british, i was cringing most of the way.
C'mon Mat, everyone knows england isn't real. tea is just fiction 🫤
So ...like did they actually test water in the microwave?
I drink more cups of tea than steph especially if it is chai tea or English breakfast
Loved the video as always but there's one big variable in the mug test that I wanted to mention.  This is not me trying to say the team messed up or anything, a lot goes into these videos and the variable I'm talking about is only an issue because mat was trying to make the amount of water in each mug being the same.  The variable is heat transfer. Normally speaking this variable wouldn't play a part in the test but because  the glass mug was used to transfer water into the other mugs, the water has had the chance to  transfer heat to the room temp glass mug  before being transferred to another room temp mug and therefore will cool the water further. By the time the glass mug gets its pour its been pre heated by the previous two mugs worth of water and so the heat transfer wont be as great.  This means that we cannot conclusively determine if glass really would or would not  keep the hottest cup of tea solely based on this video's test.
Hi, I prefer my chai
As a Brit, the best milk *really is* no milk!
In my opinion, tea should not have milk in it. I feel it takes away the organic feel to it. Anyway, I'm not hating on people who drink their tea with milk this is just how I feel about it and how I like my tea. Also, what way do you have your tea? Like any weird combinations? Or where do you prefer to drink your tea?
So here is another expermient for yea. I heat my water in my coffee pot and pour it over my bags. You should add that as well as brewing it like coffee. See how that effects your current findings.
what about what type of milk
Me, enjoying my icy, diabetic-coma inducing sweet tea from a Slurpee cup: "Interesting."
What about water quality? Tap water vs. spring water vs. purified water etc.  I grew up with well water that was treated with various chemicals and filters to make sure it was safe. Bottled spring water greatly improved the flavor.
Yall make your tea with things other than water and leaf bags?
Milk in orange pekoe? Y’all are monsters! That’s for chai!
☕
I was really disappointed at how much they limited themselves in this episode. Tea is such a broad subject and there are a multitude of preparations they could have looked into that are BY FAR more interesting than British milk tea! I would love to see them visit the methodical practice of Gongfu or Masala Chai or Matcha! You could have at LEAST discuss worldwide traditions from OTHER tea-rich cultures instead of leaning sooooo heavily on the stale stereotype of Brits drinking tea.  For the love of Tea!  Is it too much to ask?
Ok, I'm a silly American, but when using tea bag, I use a spoon to gently push and hold the bag on the bottom. It seems to work better. However, my go to is a lemon and ginger blend, so I don't have to worry about tannins.
Milk in tea is an affront to the tea leaves.
Personally, it's about preference. I like boiled water better, 2tbsp sugar and NO milk. Steep for only 2-4 minutes.
My teapot keeps it hotter  Also the reason the milk first doesn't taste as good is because you're steaping the tea in both the water and milk producing a different flavor vs steaping it in water then pouring in the untainted milk
You really are a scienteast
I get that it’s sacrilegious to heat the water in the microwave, but the video never goes into why. That seems like it would have been an excellent variable to test! Does it actually make a difference how you heat your water?
Why so much hate on heating water in the microwave? I heat it in a microwave. It's fine. It gets water hot, who cares how you do it? I didn't know we had such heating water snobs. *rich guy snoooort* you plebe, you heat water in the microwave? I am sooo much better than you." Makes no sense.
I live on tea, a couple of litres per a good tea-day.  I approve of this episode.
I agree with matpat's milk stance 100%
That's not how loose leaf should be brewed though. Usually you brew it in one vessel and then strain it into another vessel. I think they tested that with the pot though…
I like tea with water and only water
You didn't actually isolate the microwave vs boiling, you only did that for the Tik Tok Tea. I'd like you to have shown that.
Last time I heard so many bad tea puns, I was watching a Simply Nailogical video🤣
I'm just seeing people commenting on their leafy soup/tea and it's history wow I'm learning all lot.
I can confirm pyramid  tea bags are far superior.
We need a "International Leafy Soup"
Milk bottom is better
Southern Style tea from the US Mat
I think everyone here in the UK puts the milk on top anyway
Uhhhhh.......... gold peaks green tea?
Bag, water, splash of milk....simple
Now we separate the boys from the men by using...Sweet Tea the true king of the teas
Is all this science for 6 oz of water, 8 oz of water, or something else?
MMmmmm... liquid salad :)
I see the wife of the owner of this channel actually have quit a good taste, something that actually is pretty impresive
Not gonna lie, was kind of hoping this episode would also cover herbal teas because the lack of caffeine makes quite a big difference when it comes to optimal steep time.  Maybe a follow-up for both this and Iced Team would be cool
I done it almost right. Other than the piramid bags. But in my defence piramind tea is not good quality in my country.
Could you do a episode of sri lankan food please
You also forgot whole vs 2% vs skim vs half and half.
I’m Persian and go through 4-7 cups of tea a day 😶
0:32 why does that sound like me
I want to see you guys take a go at Boba milk/ bubble tea!
Brew it, ice it, and jam it full of sugar. Done.
I love this video's positive energy/vibe (I don't know which word fits better). You can feel the surprise and excitement from Mat, Steph, and Tom. I had a smile for most of the video.
Should be drinking English breakfast tea
I put the water into the microwave for a minute then put the bag of tea and sugar and drink it with the bag still inside
I always put sugar and milk at the bottom. I do the same with my coffee. There is really no need to use a spoon and taste better. I was  Born and raised in American.
Wait… you’re supposed to put milk in your tea? I’m with Matt here, I just drink the tea no milk, boiling water and tea bags
So curious question since we were talking about milk tea and I'm a Danganronpa nerd, what is the consensus on brewing tea in the milk? I know that practice originated in Hong Kong so it wouldn't be featured here but a follow up video on "which region gets it right?" would be interesting.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAT!
Controversial tea brewing method, perhaps: I pour in sugar first, then the hot water from the kettle over and through the tea bag, which brews it quicker, and stirs the sugar. I use no milk btw. Tastes fine to me; thoughts?
That video... We gonna show you how to do tea the tic toc way and british way. Do the tic toc way, taste horrible. And for the british way? Struggle with a bag of tea, taste perfect. So to do a tea the british way we just have to struggle with opening a baag of tea pouch?
so like Mat I'm a fan of no milk in the tea,  I prefer a Green Tea steeped for ~3min and oh yeah: I microwave my mug of water to heat it up.
Isn't today your birthday mat
I was TEAreffied of the Puns which were going to come
Maaaan. Sweet tea in the south is made by the gallon lol
Just wanna say this milk on the top thing isn't a crazy theory or new discovery,  it's the way I've known to drink tea my entire life (as a london born person in the UK) but fun watch   food theory team ☕️🫖
Tea with milk is just wrong lol, thanks Brits  - Sincerely, a Turk
As of today 15th of november 2022 happy birthday matt pat :)
if you're going to the details, what about temperature of water??
Okay, so I generally drink herbal teas, since I don't have the spoons in the mornings to make a cup of caffeinated tea. But I do have a suggestion. If, like me, you can't access pyramid tea bags, you can get a similar shape and effect by taking your leaves(I get herbs from my garden and grind them in a pestle and mortar), putting them in a coffee filter - one with a flat bottom - and pinching the top up together and tying it closed with kitchen twine or clipping it closed with a small clip.   However, one thing that bothers me is putting the milk in before steeping. I let the tea steep, then add milk or cream, and a bit of sugar.
i never really liked normal(?) tea because it was bitter, i always preferred sweet tea. like tea that's 80% sugar. tea with honey is nice too
can someone explain why boiling water for tea is different in the microwave vs using gas? Both of them increase the water's temperature right?
Why, for a "tea expert", would you bring in a brit instead of someone from a culture that has a history of actually decent food and drink?
what about the type of milk? 1%, 2%, what about evaporated?
"All they need to do now is just pour their milk on top and they've got it" Most of us have literally been doing that for decades, in fact when us normal Brits spot someone in the wild who puts the milk in 1st it almost always causes a huge argument either in the household, in public or online
Me, a Southerner watching this with vested interest knowing that iced tea is the perfect tea form.  Make it by the gallon, drink it by the glass.
you have missed the second most important ingredient in your experiment. you did not account for the water. I heard that decalcifyed water would make a better tea
He got a million views in 2 days.  A 20-minute lecture on tea
That woman really put the water in the microwave, then the milk and then the tea? Its heating the water with a kettle, putting the tea bag in the mug, pour the water in, then the milk and you got yourself tea.
As a British man I ALWAYS put it on top with pyramid and every person,cafe,restaurant etc done the milk on top so you done what we do over here
Nice to know that your scientifically tested result is EXACTLY how I and everyone I know has made their tea for years. And yes, I did get irrationally angry watching that Tik Tok.
and my parents have 20 teas A DAY
Big love to Matt for his No Milk in tea philosophy
GAaAaAaAh YoU aDdEd ToO mUcH MiLk AaAaaAh
science teachers would love this episode
Also also. Water at 185 to 195 is slightly better than boiling of 212. #ijs
I could not watch this whole video as a British person this triggers me
You should do an episode about how we are losing more fiber in our foods and how to affects us . That would be a great video honestly and spreads awareness.
Gill Tea
yall put milk in the tee?🤣
Tea does not have milk. When you add milk, you create a different drink.
No no The days are getting warmer and longer here in spring
OK but what about loose leaf tea
4 cups of tea per day is a lot? I drink like 6-8 cups just after I return home from work.
Everything was perfect until Matpat started stirring in a circle motion. You'll get better mixing results if you go up/down, making two separate mixing points resulting in better taste!
Fun fact unrelated to making tea: (and correct me if I'm wrong) those mugs came from Target
I agree, Mat! No milk good! :D
Bro british tea is best im british
Make it with milk and you make the Pakistani, or the indian chai
You didn't  even make it with the best method. On a stove,  first tea with water and sugar. Let it boil and then add milk as needed. Then you increase the heat and let the tea rise and then turn down the heat. Do this a about 3 times. Much better tea the Pakistani way
Never thought we'd get a tea episode like this but it is very much appreciated. Also,no milk in the tea for me 🙅‍♀️
Trying to not sound shady but also say british tea isn't the best tea...try the origins of tea instead of the colinizer version...
Being from England everyone who doesn't put the milk in their cup of tea last tends to be ostracized as it is just wrong as a majority census.
Happy birthday Mathew
only 3-4
hot milk is better than cold milk.
so you brewed the tea for 1, 3 and 5 minutes... what about 2 and 4? what if 2 or 4 is better than 3?
Fun fact polish people use more tea in weight then british and they don’t have milk
i never add tea to my tea... and you didint try adding jam to your tea so your theory is INCOMPLETE!
Wait people pour the milk the milk first here in England but why you would need a tea pot meaning you need to drink more tea but what if you drink one cup usually 😵
As a Brit, I can vouch that no British person I know would even dare to put the milk in first. It was a tradition, like you said, but no one does it anymore, so we pretty much do it exactly right.
I was wondering how long til' our wonderful Spiffy showed up... ^_^
Living in Israel, literally no one puts milk in their tea here. I did come across it enough to know it was something people do but is tea with milk the default in most countries? Jesus christ
I don't like milk in tea
Only amateurs don't squeeze the teabag. *sigh*
Same for coffee!!!
My favorite tea is Russian Caravan
Not all Brits put milk on the bottom. I'd say mostly it's put in on the top these days
I'm shocked they didn't use a brewer. Add your leaves, add your water, let it brew, then pour into your cup
I'm surprised you didn't test a gravity pot for brewing. A lot of loose leaf drinkers (myself included) prefer to use them for the convenience alone, and I'm curious if there's a taste difference between a gravity pot and a traditional teapot.
Matpat pls do spooky month thoury episode
what about China they created the first tea you can search it up
As a leaf tea lover who steeps my tea for 10 to 45 seconds per steep, that has over 20 tea flavors and mixes, and have a teapot you can set to any particular temp, an "optimum" tea is whatever the f you want it to be.
Theres no Yorkshire Tea there, this is an outrage, you understand, AN OUTRAGE!!!!!
The immediate line of water or milk first being called arbitrary shows me how much less of a thing tea is in the US compared to England 😆If you're milk first you're a wrongun and that's that
Assam is a state not just a region. I'm from neighbouring Meghalaya, the (almost) rectangular state next to Assam.
3:56 Ireland ain't part of Britain 😑
They never did a side by side of ways to heat water.
Hmm, so the one way in which the traditional method turned out to be suboptimal happens to be the one way in which there is a known, and no longer relevant, reason why the tradition is what it is? What a surprise I guess
I’m with you. I like my tea without milk
Milk going on top is how I've always done it, and so has everyone I know.
Ok, you tested 1/3/5, but that's a BIG variation.  Where's the 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 minute fine-tune test?
We just make a gallon of sweet tea and stick it in the fridge 🤷🏻‍♂️ Edit: basically always homemade Milo's tea
I've actually used cream once
The tea bag shape probably does make a difference, but you should also be aware that the tea in most teabags is basically dregs and scraps.  If you look at loose tea (and the tea in those pyramidal teabags), it is in much bigger pieces and is not mostly semi-dust like paper teabag tea.  This might vary by brand to some degree, but looseleaf tea will generally be much better quality.  Also, I'm Canadian (= British tea tradition) and it used to be normal for me to drink about 8 cups of tea a day, from one very large teapot.  I've cut back now to about 6.  Also, I LIKE some tannin in my tea.  Adding milk to tea neutralizes a lot of the better nutrients in the tea, if that matters to you.
I wish they had touched on microwaved water vs kettle water more. It seems like it wasn’t a tested variable. It was microwaved and horribly over milked tea vs proper normal tea.  I can’t confidently say from this video alone that it makes a difference.
This isn't tea! This is just hot leaf juice!
why is the tea in the videos translucent thats not how you make tea 😭
I'm british and i've never had milk first, never known anyone who has
As someone from the UK this vidio hurt me emotionally
I think the best way of preparing tea is the Chinese way, as we have a kit of preparing tea that could cost tens of thousands just on tea leaves and the pot , also we would wash the tea leaves as the impurities of tea could affect the taste of the tea showing bitterness and the color would show how much impurities it has as it would be darker in color
Every time I watch a tea video I wonder whether or not I'm actually American...     I've been drinking tea since middle school and I always naturally did it the British way without anyone really teaching me. I also prefer tea to coffee. Am I British and didn't realize it? 🧐
Fun fact, the original name of my tea company was Hot Leaf Juice
Ok but steph should definitely just use the same cup all day, like come what the heck steph?
Maybe it’s a northern thing but we never put milk in first. Here we always put water first then milk. Didn’t know it was traditional to do it the other way. Please tell me Yorkshire isn’t the only place that’s does water first then milk.
It really pains me that you weren't weighing the water.  SCIENCE!  I would also watch the same test again but for green tea.
milk first or second is the same thing with coffee. there's a clear difference
I love that the thing mat doesn't think we'll believe is what his wife drinks and how much a day. Twas cute
What about suger tho 2 sugars stirred for 1 min
Steph: “wow, wow wow wow.” Me: *having flashbacks to Pitch Meeting episodes* 😅
Yeah!!  Single use plastic wins again 🤦‍♂️. The one thing I love with my tea is an healty dose of nanoplastic in my body. 🎉🎉  Seriously though, loose leaves teas are the best.
Happy Birthday!!
"Leaf water" Iroh will be furious
Did a test on every aspect of tea making except the temperature of the water ....😑
Didn't do a comparison between microwave water and kettle water. Disappointed.  Also there is no difference.
Making tea in a mug milk in last, make it in a pot, milk in first
＊ I think this channel needs a top down camera. You guys keep talking about the color and the cloudiness… but we can’t see it.
soup
How on earth is water quality not a factor here? It's the number one ingredient!
Some lemon
You forgot to test one thing matt and gang what type of milk is best in the tea.
Bro going on about proper tea but using teabags instead of loose leaf 🤨
Most Bristish tea drinkers put milk in after tea not before even though traditionaly they used to.
That sure was a nice episode on Food TEAory
Tea is not word anymore
Okay, but what about the kind of milk? I know many like regular dairy milk but traditional NL tea usually has evaporated milk (historically used due to shelf life but continued to be used due to the sweet flavor). Also, milk alternatives?
3:02 I went to high school with that girl. Her and her sister posted a lot of americanized British content
I like my tea made with two tea bags, wait 5 minutes, then add nothing (except when I want it a bit sweet, then I add milk and or coffee creamer).
No one in the uk puts milk in first so we are doing it right but whatever. Nice vid
What about cream instead of milk?
I have to ask, where the heck are Food Theory getting their information on British culture from? Idk about you but everyone I know, including myself, have always preferred putting the milk in second and think any other way is blasphemy and disrespectful to the cup! History says one thing, but we Brits managed to figure out the best order of ingredients long before you did
They really used the worst picture they could find for matpat at 2:19 lol
Weird to make a tea episode and act like the British are the be all end all of tea and it's not just another thing they stole
Your friend from across the pond was a really good add. This whole video answers questions I never had
as a Indian , i will say , try Indian tea one time in your life time it is a different experience
MatPat really out here like "hey did you know that an insulated glass mug keeps your drink warmer than a regular mug?!" like it's breaking news and not a marketed feature
The best tea I’ve had is myos
BRO I’ve been learning about osmosis in class today! Crazy coincidence
Me who boils milk and add tea & sugar to the boiling milk.......
What about hot vs cold milk?! Smooth vs boring
Matt Patt making a tea video without an Asian lol the colonisers have officially stolen tea. Lol
Theory on why the milk on top works better: Because cold things sink and hot things rise. The milk disperses more as it sinks to the bottom of the cup when you pour it on top, and the milk in the bottom remains more stationary.
You called tea, warm leaf water and I'll never not think that.
As a British person™️: the way I've seen everyone make tea is the 'perfect' method from the end of the ep is literally how we do it except it's normally round tea bags cause they're the cheapest/ most common
Just found this channel...time to watch them all
No milk in tea, tons of sugar or honey depending on the tea. I dislike milk in general tho
Asian Green Tea Vs American Green Tea next😊
Who puts milk in tea, thats disgustung
All of the people that drink tea with milk and/or sugar are heathens. That's not a refreshing drink, that's a dessert.
Racist
As a brit, I've heard the milk first or last debate but I've never personally met anyone who puts milk in first. I don't think people actually do that in the UK.
EXCUSE ME!?!?!??!?!?
if anyone wants my method here it is (im british) boil the kettle and pour about half maybe a bit more of the cup worth of water put a tettley tea bag in put one teaspoon of sugar let it boil for 3 mins add milk  stir done
The catchphrase for this episode should be 'How is it that this ACTUALLY makes a difference?!?!"
Wait so can I put honey in it ( haha innit)
That's cool. I learnt a fair bit on how the flavour of the tea can vary especially for variables I wouldn't have expected to make a difference (the tea on top of milk part for one although I actually do that). I would have done the first experiment on the steeping tool used  (regular tea bags vs pyramidal vs the spherical tea infuser) differently though. To make the type of tea leaves used exactly the same, I would have chosen one of the tea sources e.g. loose leaf and repackaged the leaves accordingly or cut open one of the pre-packaged, ready-use tea bags and repackaged the leaves. (I get that it's messy and somewhat inconvenient to do though).
I’ll argue you didn’t properly test loose leaf. You used a tea ball which doesn’t often give the tea leaves room to expand. I use a set in basket like infuser or an infuser that you steep the tea in and then set it on a cup and it drains out the bottom. Also like you Matt I dislike milk in my tea. Other then that I agree with most of this video.
I agree, just wash the Mugs, leave the space in the dishwasher for hard to wash stuff, I know that has nothing to do with the video, but I really do feel your pain on that Matt
I've never had tea. But as someone without a sense of smell, it's probably for the best. I can't stand bitter/sour flavors, so tea would likely be very unappealing to me.  Also this is the first time I ever heard of people putting milk into tea. I never knew that was a thing.
We are Bri'ish matpat you mispronounced it the whole episode
Okay you say no to microwaving your water, but you never actually tested a difference in water heater in the microwave vs in a kettle. There should be no difference as it's literally just two different ways to excite the water molecules into moving faster, you still just come out with hot water as long as you heat them to the same temp.
MatPat: “They just need to add milk on first.”  Me:”Already do.”
Yall all wrong.  Best tea is served over ice with a ton a sugar
honestly what about decaf tea it tastes different and what about circle tea bags
Happy birthday, MatPat! Hope it's absolutely tea-riffic! Here's to many more years of theories and fun. :)
12:34 -12:35 there's more milk the tea wtf
GET ME UNCLE IROH
Use a tea thermos it kinda pressurizes the tea and whatever else you make your tea with getting more flavorful tea
3-4 cups a day??? Pfffffttt those are rookie numbers
milk on the bottom ????
as a British person, we put milk on top anyway and find it kinda wired to have milk on the bottom :) guess we did evolve 😂
the only real tea is lipton
try Persian tea i recommend 100%
I think Christmas came early judging by the way MatPat was literally jumping up and down in excitement.
I like my leaf and bean waters
as a true british man I say that Tetley tea is amazing
Traditionally tea has salt not sugar....some of the oldest documents in existence prove this.
whos drinking tea while watching this(i am)
the three mugs with letters got me overanalyzing the video
You should check out gong fu tea from china, its a whole art with every detail looked at. Might be good for a follow up episode.
Thank you for this video, I have to use this as information for my project.
As a Brit, nobody I know actually puts the milk into the cup first. And also we rarely use teapots from my experience! The order most people I know use is: teabag, hot water, steep and remove tea bag, sugar and then milk last c:
I can't believe I'm going to say this but,this is how I make a cup tea as a British person  .cup(duh) .tea bag in cup .boil kettle  .add sugar  .add water  .add milk  .drink
Stephs mom eyes for the win XD
As a British man I suggest tea in a mug milk on top, tea from a pot milk in the bottom but that could be my working class background.
My method of making tea is boil water with the kettle to 80C and add into cup with the generic tea bag and then add honey, not milk._
I'll just take this scientific data and use all of it except the milk, as milk in tea is just... not my thing :')
I love tea
Excuse you, what sane brit ever puts the milk in first?!
Sorry Europe but Asians perfected tea LONG before you THOUGHT you did
3-4 cups a day is about how much I drink too. Also, I was a bit shocked that one of the tea mugs you used is the same style as the one I’m drinking tea out of right now.
Some other points to consider when making tea is the temperature at which you steep the tea, amount of tea leaf and water used for steeping and size of the "tea leaf" (fine tea dust vs whole tea leaf). I would agree with Mat that tea with no milk is the best. The unadulterated stuff is just awesome.
I never knew people put milk into their tea I always had the tea bag and hot water 🥲
I don't know one person in England who puts milk in first
I'm proud to say my family has made tea this ways for at least 3 generations so now i get to flex my superiori-TEA.  I'm kinda wondering tho what TYPE of milk would be the best? like semi-skimmed, whole or skimmed?
You should make a theory about Crofter’s Organic
Hot leaf juice
A properly prepared cup of matcha with 1-3 drops of honey, depending on how sweet you want it, is perfection.
Me: boils water in an electric kettle, forgets about it for like 15 minutes, pours over the tea, forgets about it for like 2 hours (the tea bag stays in the cup), remembers about it, drinks it. I think I'm doing alright
Why would you add milk? Sounds gross!
FYSA: You can only sprout avocado pits (in the Northern Americas) with pits from US grown avocados because imported produce is irradiated to prevent pests. The irradiation prevents the pits from germinating 😁
N:)E
"We want an exact brewing time"... proceeds to completely ignore the suggested ranges and use enormously arbitrary round numbers.
If you are going to take the next step; Does a spoon matter and what kind of material should it be made out of, and does that even matter? I think so, but I'm not a very good tea drinker, or coffee drinker... I guess I can try with water?
first time hearing of milk in tea
Brit here, we don't put the milk in first. I'm not saying the milk never went in first historically, but it certainly doesn't now. Still enjoyed the episode, though
Barista here. I noticed two things in this vid. First off, yeah, the 1/4 of milk in tea is getting into a London Fog or Tea Latte territory. A normal cup of tea shouldn't have that much milk, but there are drinks where you want that much.   Also, it doesn't surprise me that milk being put in on the bottom or top makes a difference. It's just like making a latte versus a macchiato. A latte has espresso on the bottom and milk on top and a macchiato is the opposite. The two have quite a different taste. Same here with the milk and tea.
Milk in tea?!?!?!?! I've never heard of that even the little bistros I've visited in Europe (London, Italy, Romania) never put milk in it its always just hot water and I'd add honey cause it's bitter af plain. That's interesting I'll have to try it with a little bit of milk
Interestingly enough, different varieties of tea require different levels of heat for varying amount of time to steep for best flavor. Your result is definitely valid, and some pints carry over, however, ultimately your data set is specific to the tea brand and flavor you were using, '
Tbh I'm surprised you didn't try testing one standard deviation difference  Also, you didn't test boiling method aside from microwave Vs electric jug, there's also a potor saucepan and kettle that boils on a  flame
Woah Woah Woah! Us proper british know the milk goes in after, but what about the type of milk? Skimmed, semi skimmed, whole milk? then there is biscuits for dunking, thats a whole other video!
As a statistician, little disappointed that they didn't bring up Fisher's Lady Tasting Tea experiment, which is an anecdote about the basis for statistical significance. I mean, you had a LADY (Steph) who could TASTE the TEA. Missed opportunity!
Also use semi skimmed milk, whole/ fresh milk adds a film over the top almost instantly, kinda ruining it, skimmed milk is just water pretending to be milk
I would also like to add a potential variable with different waters. 👀
Never ever seen someone put the milk in first?!?!
I know exactly ZERO British people who put milk in first. You will get crucified for putting milk in first here. We may have put milk in first historically for practical reasons (something I did not know, thanks for the history lesson), but we definitely have not done that commonly in my entire lifetime.
microwaved normal glass mug 3 min step 20 ml cold milk
Fun fact: tea was brought to England by a portuguese queen. Of course, many royal women after seeing the queen drink it, decided to follow her example and that's how tea became so popular.  The portuguese on the other hand, got a hold on tea after we established a colony in Macau, China. :)
what's the theory in this video?
I am the 1,000,000th view :>
My sister-in-law purposely BOILS HER BREWING TEA for about 10 minutes because she thinks it lets loose more caffeine. That’s tannic acid, not caffeine. 🤢
As a Brit, this intrigues me
mug, sugar, tea bag from Yorkshire tea, water from kettle fill near top, milk to fill rest of cup , stir, take out, count the money bubbles.
I used to make tea in the microwave until I realized if you boil the water it stays hot much longer
Wait ppl put milk in tea?! I always put lemon or honey in mine. Pffff lemon is waaaaaaaay better. Fight me
Mat with all tea puns, I will unsub or atleast the bell😮‍💨
You did miss one HUGE variable. Water quality. Case in point: A cup of tea in my hometown of Hull in East Yorkshire and a cup of tea in Guildford in Surrey will taste very different if the water comes directly from the tap, due to variations in the hardness, mineral content and general 'quality' of the water.  HOWEVER, put that water in a good quality filter (I use a Berkey) and the tea will taste practically identical (although not entirely as (most) filters don't do much about hardness and softness and it doesn't take much of a variation to to make a difference - Soft water is better btw)
I want to know if there a difference pouring the hot water over the tea bag vs sitting the tea bag in the water.
Can you please do a Food Theory on MSG.  PLEASE 😊 I want to know scientifically if it’s ok or bad for you.
fun fact: turkey is the country that drinks the most tea per person
British tea is basic, go for Taiwan boba milk tea, step on the landmine of cold tea
When I make my tea I just pour the boiling water in the cup , tea bag in and one spoon of sugar. Then I let it wait for 5 minutes
Where i live nobody puts milk in tea We just put sugar or honey in (Feel free to attack me in the replies if you find me stupid)
You should test whether milk, cream, or half & half is better. I personally like h&h, but my mom likes milk.
what about iced tea!?
great vid but..what about iced tea?
I don’t even drink tea and I haven’t watched this video yet, but I make it the right way don’t even come for me bro
But...hear me out.. do you steep the tea before or after the milk
British.. Not Chinese or Japanese? India or Africa ? The brits inherited as well
I wonder how many british people unsubsubscribed the second they saw the title...
0:54 How could member of my family say something like that
WHO PUTS IT IN THE MICROWAVE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS
My mom drinks tea as such: put teabag in her 8ounce travel cup, fill with water, microwave for 3 minutes (2:30 for the stronger units), no milk, and never wash the cup.   There's a level of sediment that is fused to the inside of her cup that, I'm sure, it's 70 percent stronger than it should be. She also uses the same cup for every tea, so I'm sure her Mint-Green Tea or Sleepytime blend are a little darker than they should be.
Do I have to use a kettle or can I use a Keurig machine do instantly heat the water up for me. Does that change the quality of the tea? I need answers MatPat!
Well, regarding the British tradition, as said in the video, it shows that the rich or upper echelon in life pour milk on top of the tea and the "traditional" are for poor people. This means that if you want the best, then go for the rich route 😂🤣
There's no way anyone actually goes milk first, right? I refuse to believe it. And I'm English.... So what's going on there
Please do this with green tea
Gotta say, most Brits *do* add the milk afterwards, and can get really weird about it if you don't do it that way.  imo, milk should be added first if you're using a teapot to pour, but if you're just making it with a bag in the cup, you'd add it after.  And yes, we as a nation have a  problem, no one's disputing that.
As a Brit I have never liked milk first, I've always preferred putting the milk in second 🤷🏻‍♂️
These teas are made for spilling
no milk in the tea. just no. it's wrong! Either drink the tea straight or dont drink it
I did not know that so many people drank their tee with milk
As a Hong Kong Chinese person, sipping my super strong Pu'er tea while watching this episode was a nice enjoyable moment. Though I can't have milk in my Chinese tea, it would have to be in milk tea, where the tea leaves are chosen for the purpose of making milk tea.
I'm from South Africa. And this is no joke EXACTLY how I make tea.  Minus the teapot. But hey. You can just wait for your tea to cool down
omg wikia
I’ve never heard ‘tea’ so much in a video.  I’m Indian and we cannot live without 3 cups of tea a day
I am willing to bet that the American standard for milk in tea and why it is so high may have a lot to do with how heavily lobbied milk is here and not actually based on how it tastes you know that milk has their hands in almost everything here. As someone who is very allergic to dairy it is nigh on impossible to find foods that don't contain milk in their allergy warnings.
As a Brit I've never seen anyone put milk first
I watched this from start to finish like, two days ago and something just now dawned on me. Why not run the experiments atleast twice in a row for the sake of consistency due to the variable that is the tea leaves. Those little leaf bits might have varying age, curing methods, sourcing, and such. Two peaches are only identical once in awhile.
I get the video was English, but it still feels odd to say the English way could be the right way when it's literally just all stolen methodology
I almost had a heart attack when he said “British person”
Ginger milk tea😋
Mat, you did not test Sugar vs Sugar Cubes vs Honey and optimal amount of it.
Tea is love, tea is life.
9:04 did Steph just make a Ryan George reference? Ooh! Matpat should try to find out if there is any Ryan George lore. EVERYONE in his universe looks like him. There's gotta be a lore there somewhere.
milk in tea?
Do you think one day you could get a southerner to come up there and make some proper sweet tea? I feel like it would be interesting to see warm tea people and sweet tea people trading ideas.
Matpat- "She merely adopted tea but others they were born in it molded by it we needed someone British"  me- Laughs in Asian
We really love tea in Eastern Europe too. Never microwave it, just sometimes drink it with lemon. Earl Grey tea with lemon and sugar is amazing.
I don't remember you testing for microwave vs kettle
I personally am from germany and we dont even ad Milk here.
Ngl I prefer ny tea with honey and lemon
Show 'em a samovar and watch their heads explode
WE DEMAND MORE TOM CONTENT!
talking about tea without the actual country who drinks the most tea a.k.a Turkey feels wrong
Steph: drinks 3-4 cups a day  me: WEAK!
Did he mention what tea he was testing with or was I just not paying attention
Oh boy this is going to be controversial, I don't know where you found your "Brit" but putting milk in first is looked down upon by the vast majority, might be a class thing, for a start putting milk in second means you can gauge the right amount of milk, which obviously we don't measure with ml, we judge the shade which should be He-man's skin tone
As a person from Georgia I only drink Sweet Tea, so this is interesting.
i ate while watching this video
Can’t believe you missed out on WHAT milk is best - whole milk? Semi-skimmed? 2%? Alternative milks?
You cant ruin tea for me >:0 My tea is great with its faults 😩 also, I drink a kettle a day. Lets have a tea party.  Food theory idea: Would drinking too much tea cause you iron deficiency •<•
Why would you add milk to tea? Ew.
Watching a video about an American trying to educate me, a brit, on how to make a perfect cup of tea... hm... Interesting (LMAO)
I make my tea with hot coffee and redbull. I like caffeine. I’m hearing lights and seeing voices.
What would have been a great conclusion would have been to take your “perfect” cup of tea and make it the same way the TikTok tea was made. Were her ingredients incorrect but her method was sound?
Debating the proper way to make tea Me: *laughs in Asian*
Tea puns. Well done Mat. 👏
I think milk first is traditional only for high tea / fancy tea. Traditional mug of English Breakfast tea in Britain is teabag>just boiled water from kettle>teabag out>milk. When I've gone out for an afternoon tea though, my parents put milk in the fancy teacup first then pour from the teapot. I haven't gone the hang of doing it that way though as my tea is usually too milky :(  (Random point - no one does that 'pinkies out' thing in Britain. It would probably be considered rude if anything, plus we call it the little finger.)  Loose leaf or pyramid tea bags usually have recommendations for the temperature of the water and stewing time as well (although some teapots don't have a filter so the stewing time is ignored), but classic tea bags are a personal preference. Also personal preference is the type of milk - skimmed milk is usually judged harshly, semi-skimmed or whole is exceptable, and the ultimate is Jersey Cow milk (even more so for coffee).  Another factor is the regional water - in Britain we have 'soft' and 'hard' water regions. Hard water contains more minerals and has a tendency to coat our kettles in limescale. It also apparently affects the flavour and strength of the tea. If you leave a teabag to stew in hard water too long the surface water forms an unpleasant 'scum'. I used to press the teabag to get it to stew quicker and avoid this happening, but it's not good for the tea flavour. Stirring is fine though.  Wow I knew more about tea than I realised. That explains why I keep getting it as a gift 😁
Milk tea in Arabic is Shai haleeb
This episode was just so delightful, insightful, and fun 😆🤭💖 Food Theory at it's best!
I dont get it why does microwaved boiling water make it change its taste
i actually tried this for myself and it was great!
*>=(*
3-4 cups a day is rookie numbers in the UK
I'm surprised you didn't test different types of milk
Sweet tea anyone
i've always love when steph is in the vid, she's so funny and never in an annoying way, just over all a lovely person.
India: Well actually, you add 1/2 part milk
I like tea like my ancestors did… so let’s throw it in the ocean shall we😅
The news reporting on these tea crimes has to be the most British thing Britain has ever Britished
a lot of us brits do put milk after it is even in a add that putting milk before is weird
Moroccan mint tea is the best
Do coffee next
That's surprising, no opening skits or title montage. But still, WOW, people are serious about their tea. And I thought coffee was a heated debate.
Why is microwaving water bad? I don’t think they explained it.
i like how they just completely ignored the chinese and indian ways of making tea…
Meanwhile in India.
You forgot one large variable: the water! Tea consists of 99% water, so that's no surprise. According to Brita, the film you get on top is coming from the polyphenols reacting with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. They also claim that hard water makes a big difference to the taste and aroma.  Would be interesting to have you compare tap water vs bottled water vs distilled water to see if that makes a difference. Also I think you should do a blind test in any case to ensure there's no bias.
Wait.. YOU PUT MILK IN TEA?
I grew up in the American Midwest making southern sweet tea but dating a half brit that learned how to make tea  from his brutish Mom, grandma, and all her side of the family. To say my tea isn't really welcomed in the house and I'm happy to leave it behind.
20:27
Catpat
Look up ISO 3103 for a good time
I was hoping for a bit more precision.  Don't just test 1, 3, 5 minutes - once you've narrowed that to 3, try 2.5, 3, and 3.5 minutes too!  Get it down to within a quarter minute before you stop!  Don't settle for "splitting the difference" on milk, test increments within the range until you narrow it to a precise amount!
You find that in Britain it's a quest you're born with to perfect the drink for the individual as everyone tends to like it in their own way
Ok, but what milk?
Since I was a teen in the late 80s, early 90s, living in Seattle, and making coffee and tea (and we didn't have a espresso machine) had always put the milk in sealed containers in the freezer to get really cold but not frozen before bathing. After getting dressed (maybe 20 minutes) I made the coffee or tea and while brewing or steeping, shaken my cold milk to a froth and measuring it out in a Thermos before adding the coffee or tea.   I remember being told to shock the coffee or tea and still aerate the end drink volume.
0:09 Me, in Australia, just having entered summer and preparing for immense heat that comes with it *sweating in envy
Oh 3 4 cups..... I have like 6 to 7 a day...😅
May I suggest coffee next?  There are a lot of techniques on how to serve the perfect coffee.
The milk order depends on bags or pot. If you are pouring from a pot of tea, then you add the milk to the cup before you pour the tea. If you are using a bag, then the milk is the last thing you add.
Matpat has a passionate hate for milks in all areas of his life

no chai 🥲
Hands down and pinkies up, the best episode of food theory ever.
finally!!! we hav a weakness against British....now we asians are fighting back for insulting our rice legacy >:) joke xD
We need a part 2 with Turkish tea i believe it IS the best
I live in London, I am British and I HATE tea. However due to our religion I have had no choice but to make tea for colleagues in the workplace and family. In todays Britain if I made my wife or my boss a cup of tea and put the milk in before the hot water I would likely be sacked and or divorced.. The majority of Britain add milk after the tea.
As a Brit I can confidently confirm that: I can't actually taste tea.. it's just like drinking hot water for me.. so... I just stick to some hot cocoa.
You talk about tea and you didn't even mention The Spiffing Brit? THE tea drinking aficionado who can make any tea perfectly with no exploits? I was half expecting a collaboration.
I might be reading to much into it but did matpat seem a bit bitter and annoyed throughout this video. Hope your doing alright man
27 mL of milk to how much water? 5 mL? 20 mL? 100 mL? 5,000 mL? And does water from a microwave really make that big of a difference if it's the same temperature as the electric kettle?
Ok, good episode. I learned a lot! Thank you! But I'm not sold on the  "do-not-microwave" point. 🤷
you should have tested the milk type as well
Matpat do a episode about the most refreshing soda
Honestly I was waiting for a difference between Turkish tea and British tea because turkey drinks more tea then British people but still it’s cool
-“We need international perspective, someone born in it, molded by it” Me: Chinese! Japanese! -“BriTiSh” 😂
I love tea ,,but I am from Bangladesh ,,,in our country we have tea gardens.
*looks at title* Well idk, my family is Chinese and we just boil water for the tea leaves. Very simple.  Meh, don't care for milk in tea. I like bitter but my family makes them nice and mild.
This video is just telling me I make perfect tea everytime lmao
How does one open this bag had me dying!😂😂
happy birthday mathew🎉
Now let’s add another variable. Which is the best non-dairy milk for tea?  Sincerely, an extremely lactose intolerant person.
There's no such thing as "TOO MUCH TEA".
Them complaining about milk in the tea  Me with my chai- intresting
This video is so streets ahead.
Y'all haven't even scratched the surface. Spice tea 😌
17:07 You didn't test the microwave. The only one microwaved was an abomination for many reasons. If anything is going to add a negative flavor to the water, it's the kettle which has had excess minerals baked in every time you boil water. The microwave doesn't have this problem, because the heating vessel is the cup, which will be affecting the water one way or another.
*Angry Asian noises* Have you checked how how Chinese and Japanese made tea the correct way? Temperature, water, type of pot, how many times the tea was washed… You know nothing about tea. At minimum you know nothing about the origin of tea - the green tea. There is full course and tea brewing competition in China and Japan.
Mat’s opinion of milk in tea is the Chinese way, the original CORRECT way 😂
Theory Idea: Has there been more fish or more goldfish consumed in the United States since its founding
As somewhat of an authority on the topic, your information is a little off. In the UK, putting milk first is seen as more common (of lower class). Everyone who isn’t a heathen puts milk “on top” in Britain.
I go through 3-4 pots of tea a day lol
While in Chennai, we would usually find tea that was brewed this way. Personally I hate the British method of making tea. The flavor of the tea and milk doesn't infuse and you can taste the milk separately. We usually brew milk and water together with some ginger. Once the ginger's fragrance has infused with the milk and water mixture add in the tea leaves. The resultant drink has no strong flavor of milk and has the added flavor of ginger.
What about the sugar???
I legit wonder if any British people will watch this video and change their methods?
As an American, I was told to, “use only milk, instead of water” Don’t hate the player, The games a game
It's interesting that you say the traditional way is milk on the bottom when, as a British Northerner, literally everyone I knew always out the milk on top and so did I. We also put the teabag in the cup then the boiling water. I have stomach issues though now so only have herbal tea now. Still like making it for my family though!
I'm British and Chinese and I interviewed my fellow Brits and they all pour milk lastttttttttt
What about the different types of tea
I can't believe you didn't end this episode by saying "bon appe-tea"!
You've took it to far food theory
Whole, two percent or skim?
You should have emptied the bags and filled them with the same leaves, maybe you just had a preference for the ones in the pyramid bags ;D Also heating water in the microwave is fine as long as you're not heating the bag with it.
But, matcha!
I am from assam 😁 loved the name pop out
I think i drink like 3-4 cups q day
Team theorists: *shows 3 shapes of teabags* Me: What about the great square of Yorkshire Gold! YOOORKSHIIIRE!!!!!!
Part 2: skip the sugar and milk and do a deep dive into gongfu style tea service
Anyone else find their familiarity and synergy just so heckin' cute ^-^
Yoo I have the same Spider-Man Avengers cup as mat, nice.
Wait a second...If you used different tea (the bags were prepackaged so you don't know if the quality and age of the teas were the same) how can you be sure the triangle bag was best? Shouldn't you have used the same source and measured the samples into each different bag yourself? You are usually a lot more careful than this. There is no way to know if the different tea sources were comparable.
I agree with Mat no milk is best.
I agree with Matt, best milk is no milk in tea.
MAS
What are the letters on your cups meant to spell out?
Yes you have made British people mad
I'm glad we got to see CatPat again
I once tried a completely different kind of tea which is cherry blossom tea and it was the best thing I've ever tasted
That moment when you realise tea is just warm leaf water
I have never added milk to my tea I didn’t know you added milk to it
"They just need to pour in their milk last" - Mate, we already do that. Pouring it in first is a Cardinal sin. This video proves nothing good Sir, gosh darn it!
As a British person I think I know why tea from a teapots colder, usually when you drink tea from a teapot you are at a cafe or a public place and you want to drink it straight away while at home when you pour straight to the cup it’s because your on the sofa watching tv or chatting to people coming over so you’re drinking it less / ignoring it for a while until there’s a break in conversation
You completelly ignored asian ways of making tea… tea bags and milk, half of the world will not even consider this as a tea
You all made the tea wrong.  You use the strainer ball and place the tea bag inside, then over the course of the recommended steep time, you instead raise the ball out and let the liquid slowly strain out. This makes the tea concentrated and much better.
Sugar???!!!
never knew people put milk in tea sounds gross.
darn would have been fun to see how much sugar is too much or too little.
Im honestly surprised that loose leaf tea didn't beat out the triangle mesh bags as most of the loose leaf tea i have had is miles better than any tea bag. though ive never tried the same brand side by side like this so perhaps it was just that the loose leaf tea ive had was just a better brand than the teabags. I have a famous tea shop near my house that ive been meaning to go to at some point and now my motivation is stronger than ever.
I have a tea suggestion for Stef it is peach ginger and dandelion's
she drinks so much tea "probably 3-4 cups a day" laughs in brit
Kinda food theory. For your car. Is it better to fill your gas at a near empty tank, when it’s 1/2 full, or every chance you get? What fill time gets you the best gas mileage and bang for your buck
Mat Pat, there's one thing you forgot to account for: the amount of time that the milk is in the tea. Milk should definitely be poured on top, but I've found that you get the best cup of tea if you add the milk in the last minute of steeping. Personally, I think that, if you add the milk after the tea has already steeped, the milk overpowers the flavor of the tea too much. But, if you add the milk as soon as the tea starts steeping, it cools the water down and it can't steep properly. But, if you add the milk in during the last minute, the milk is infused with the flavor of the tea to create a harmonious flavor but isn't in the cup long enough to prevent the hot water from getting enough flavor out of the leaves. I agree with everything else you said in the video, but you should definitely try adding milk during the steep time
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAT 🥳🥳🥳
Matt getting teaweeked out
MAS
Watching these videos become very teadious
(Idea, Starbucks water tastes wonderful and I'm not a water person but should be...  Heard they have some 3 part water filtration system. Would be interesting to hear of the best water and maybe what's the best for you. Wish I could buy Starbucks water by the jug.)
I had to let you know that my sons told me about your amazing show, and now we all watch it together. We love it! The science you explain is so interesting. We've learned so much! I love that my kids and I can watch it together and talk about it! You two are absolutely adorable, too! Thank you for all you do to make the episodes!
As a British person, I think nowadays the modern wisdom here (for most people) is put the milk in after.  Also, I never really drink much tea, but by coincidence I have been a lot more recently and I had to stop halfway through the video to make some 'cause it was giving me cravings lol. I burnt my tongue with impatience.
If its not coffee, coke, alcohol, or water it goes in the harbor.
A silly suggestion/question, what is the best ratio of peanut butter and jelly for pb& j
Matpat should have gotten the spiffing brit on this episode, he literally breaks games with tea
I have an electric kettle, which comes to a boil in 3 minutes, I put about 2 bags of tea in this 6 cup kettle, then I pour into any mug I like, with honey, not sugar or milk.
what about the TYPES of milk? Whole milk? 2%? 1%? Does it even have to be from a cow? Goat Milk? Oat Milk? Almond Milk??? WE. NEED. ANSWERS.
I think in the uk its more of a north/south divide as we in the north, for the most of us, put our milk in after. And yeah, it does make a better brew
no one puts milk in first
ofc he’s only covering british methods
You have to do Chai (not its not called Chai Tea, thats just saying Tea Tea), there's many variations of  it, Masala Chai being a popular one.  Maybe another 2-3 episodes with Tea from around India/Pakistan and another on East Asia (China/Japan/Taiwan/Korea etc)
I would prefer a blind taste test to remove any possible bias in the tasting. You can make the stuff to be tasted, but give someone the responsibility of selecting which ones are tasted in which order.
I wanted to see the most optional inflicting tea types but this is del to know
First shalt thou boil thy holy water. Then shalt thou steep to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt steep, and the number of the steeping shall be three. Four shalt thou not steep, neither steep thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.
Why milk though?  Seems so unesseccary. Tea is perfectly fine on its own. Just my opinion I guess.
The milk on top is better because its colder than the tea so the milk mixes well by sinking towards the bottom of the mug while the tea rises if that makes sense. Its the same stuff as convection currents
Oh my lord Matpat in the kitcken is an anxiety simulator xD haha
I mean hey you’re missing some thing like for another theory channel so how about like sports theory or something
I occasionally make tea in a coffee plunger (this coffee plunger is rarely used) wonder if it makes a difference
Tea pot tea is colder? Did you wake up your teaware? It's an important step in gong fu cha brewing. You don't want to put your brewing water in a cold dish or it will affect the process.  Steph, if you're drinking multiple cups per day, seriously check out gong fu cha brewing style. Lots of leaves, little pot, seconds long brewing time, lasts all day. Modern Rogue did an episode with So Han that's phenomenal. Talking about the old Tea-horse Road and the history of tea in China, different types of tea, tea that's been pressed into cakes, aged naturally, and increases in value like wine... it's an experience.
Douglas Adams and Tea from Adams' The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time   pgs. 67-69  Tea        "One or two Americans have asked me why the English like tea so much, which never seems to them to be a very good drink. To understand, you have to make it properly. There is a very simple principle to the making of tea, and it's this - to get the proper flavor of tea, the water has to be boilING (not boilED) when it hits the tea leaves. If it's merely hot, then the tea will be insipid. That's why we English have these odd rituals, such as warming the teapot first (so as not to cause the boiling water to cool down too fast as it hits the pot). And that's why the American habit of bringing a teacup, a tea bag, and a pot of hot water to the table is merely the perfect way of making a thin, pale, watery cup of tea that nobody in their right mind would want to drink. The Americans are all mystified about why the English makes such a big thing out of tea because most Americans HAVE NEVER HAD A GOOD CUP OF TEA. That's why they don't understand. In fact, the truth of the matter is that most English people don't know how to make real tea anymore either, and most people drink cheap instant coffee instead, which is a pity, and gives Americans the impression that the English are just generally clueless about hot stimulants.      So the best advice I can give to an American arriving in England is this: Go to Marks and Spencer and buy a packet of Earl Grey tea. Go back to where you're staying and boil a kettle of water. While it is coming to the boil, open the sealed pack and sniff. Careful - you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal. When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around, and tip it out again. Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of rightousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let's just take this in easy stages). Bring the kettle back up to the boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into a cup. Some people will tell you that you shouldn't have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk. If you think you will like it with milk, then it's probably best to put some milk into the bottom of the cup before you pour in the tea. If you pour milk into a cup of hot tea, you will scald the milk. If you think you will prefer it with a slice of lemon, then, well, add a slice of lemon. Drink it. After a few moments you will begin to think that the place you've come to isn't maybe quite so strange and crazy after all."
British have problems with the Tik Tok Tea Making, I had a girlfriend that would microwave the tea to death using one or more bags per cup. I usually don’t add milk to my tea, its a matter if I feel like it and what tea flavor I’m making, it's usually just sugar for me
It is important what kind of milk are you using?
Milk in tea is just evil, its something children do when tea is to bitter. So it proves that the Brits don't even like tea, and therefore the nation should be dissolved into any other nation ... you know something like the one they recently escaped from.
"Best milk is no milk in tea" Words of a true tea drinker. milkless tea people assemble
What about different types of milk?
today i learned people adding milk to tea is more common than i thought. i did not know people added milk to tea until last year when i started making london fogs. i for the most part just add honey or sugar to my teas.
Trick question. What stinks but tastes good?
..just warning boiling to scalding water or liquid can cause burns and if your hit it with a metal spoon it can cause a reaction that might make that microwave water do a reaction and splatter that hot liquid on you. Plastic spoons or wooden is a safety must.
Loved the video as a regular tea drinker myself. Glad to know the way I make my Roobios tea is the best way. However, there was three variable not discussed that may make a difference:  - Type of milk (Whole milk vs. Skim vs 1% vs 2%) - Type of kettle cooked in (copper kettle vs electric kettle vs stainless steel vs glass electric vs ceramic) - Additives (sugar vs honey vs splenda vs no sweetener)  If y'all decide to revisit this, that would be worth testing out.
If they pick anything other than loose leaf, I’m calling the whole experiment tainted. CTC needs to be stopped.  Update: I will accept pyramid bags. I don’t know that particular brand but many pyramid bags have loose leaf in them over beat to death and powdered tea leaves. You win this time, Matpat…..
My mugwort tea from Buddha’s Teas tells me to steep for six minutes and it tastes nice. Also my family loves to put coffee creamer in our tea, though I don’t do it all the time.
For loose leaf tea my family uses a hand held coffee brewer like youd see at star bucks and put the tea leaves into the mesh/fabric part then we’d fill the glass with hot water heated by a kurig then twist it up and let it brew.
I put honey in my tea
I love that you tackled this and found such interesting information, but I'm so sad that y'all didn't do an experiment on the actual differences between microwaving tea or kettling tea! I would be so interested to know if people can tell the difference on a blind taste test, and I've always wondered what would really affect it other than temperature I'm guessing!
I'm disappointed you didn't even mention ISO-3103!!
Also finished the video and the milk point is really weird because NOONE  puts milk in first in the UK now unless you're insane. But weird hes telling us to switch when we literally do the milk last. Also, Yorkshire tea bags for better flavour
i think my way of drinking tea is more offencive to the brits than this video is.  I heat my water with a kurig, stick my tea in a tea bell (metal not mesh) and i leave it there the whole time and let it get bitter cause i love bitter drinks. no milk, screw the milk.
You should see how many cups of tea my grandma drinks.
You should see how my sister made tea for me back when I was 6. Broke a tea bag poured in the leaves then filled the entire thing with just milk. Cold milk. Then she handed it to me and have it. I was of course suspicious but drank it anyway. Bits of tea leaves combined with milk is not a fun combo.
Already commenting but its a sin to put milk in first. This hurt to watch lmao
So what if we brewed tea with a coffee maker....asking for a friend.....
I forget people put milk in tea and don’t just drink it plain. I come from China and usually we just have it as is without milk or sugar added
Yah the Bri'ish were the ones to steal it and appropriate it into their culture first.
You kept putting hot water in the glass cup as you used it as a measure for the other two cups , so the glass cup got heated up more. Although I do agree glass is better. Instead of the loose Tea in that bubble ball thing, you should've put the loose tea just in the pot itself with the water as the tea has even more space to sleep in. Then you use a tea strainer when pouring out the tea.  Plus you forgot about the tea cosy, if we use a tea pot most of us use a cosy to make the tea even hotter and stay hotter . Also nothing was mentioned of the comparison between using  metal tea pots as some people use those instead of pot ones.  And about the milk thing. To be honest it's always been that half the country has always put the milk in last and the other half has always put the milk in first. Plus All the different brands of tea DO make a difference as there's different strengths.  So well done, but if you're going to do a REAL tea experiment then you've got to go all the way with this . ☺️☺️☺️❤️
You do not milk the TEA
They forgot sugar. And sometimes people do whipping cream. So, what about that as well?
mixing the options may have different results, like shorter with loose might be better.
Teapots are usually warmed up with hot water before brewing
Tea is awesome. The flavor is determined by the soil, climate, and cut. There is only one species of the plant, yet it has so many flavors and variations. Much like people, we're the same everywhere just molded by the environment around us.
aye
I make my tea by putting everything in a mug (water, tea bag, sweetener) and microwaving for a minute and a half. I will not be taking criticism or changing my method.
Maybe the reason I don't like tea is because I keep the tea bag in for way too long lol
Milk in tea?
But... But what if I actually like the bitterness from tea
Adding milk to tea D:
**ahem** Sweet Tea.   Thank you for your time.
im surprised you never made the tea pose joke
Also, one issue with the absolute LAST part of your experiment, about the temperature of the tea in the mugs, you said the glass mug was the hottest, but keep in mind you USED the glass mug to pour the rest of the mugs of boiling water. Thereby removing any cooling effect you would have gotten from the glass mug when the actual tea was made. In restaurants we heat dishware including mugs so the temperature of the dishware does not cool the food or drink, because it will VERY quickly have an effect on what you are consuming temperature wise.
Lovely episode very fun. Steph seems to be really hung up on not microwaving the water but I diddnt actually see that step get tested. What's the best heat source for the water? I'm just saying she's awfully adamant about that for it to have not been tested.
But what about lumps of suger?
I agree with Matt on the no milk thing. I personally prefer the stronger flavour of tea without milk.
I don’t like tea
I agree with matpat no milk a bit of sugar in my tea!
Iced tea is the best tea
Honey is obviously the best option for sweetening tea!
As an American dating a British person, this was very very entertaining.
The color of the drinking vessel can also impact your perception of taste (as has been shown with plates and bowls). The human mind is weird
Most Brits had switched to milk last long ago, once again were way ahead of our cousins across the pond
You cant taste the tea if you add milk.
Mat the best way to get space in dishwasher just make a tea vid
Just a daily cup up realitea
Just buy the gallon of sweet tea
seeing as you mentioned 80% of what we eat is connected to smell, i think it’d be really interesting to see a video about how those of us w congenital anosmia taste things differently
How could microwaving or boiling make a difference with water I can understand with the tea if you heated it at the same time since there would be microwaves going through the leaves but I don't get it with the water itself
You are correct, milk in tea is incorrect.
Even as an American, I don't put the milk in first and never will. It's like putting the milk before you put in the cereal
Calendula flowers and jasmine w double oolong, iron goddess, and red dragon. Pinch of hisbscious. No sugar needed. Passionflower is invited. I'm american.
Very good intro... My goodness
I was always taught that you'll scald the milk by putting it in first. Never felt up to challenging that, but sounds like it would explain that sour note in the milk first cup.
Flat bags work fine...just dunk in and out, let float, then dunk and few more. Done in 1.5 to 2 minutes (according to taste). Also, she was swirling the tea ball thus making the infusion stronger while the bags got no motion. *not that scientific Pat. 🤨
Ayo why are they booing you out of the room? You are right. The best milk in tea is indeed no milk in tea!!!!
What about those allergic to tannins? What then?
I room temp my ilk 1st. It hits a medieum.
It’s just hot leaf juice
How dare you
I would like to add that 3-4 teaspoons of milk and a bit of cream is Devine
The material test probably has more variables going into why the pyramid is better than the other two. I don't know what brand this is, but usually the tea in paper bags is ground up fines that aren't good quality, sometimes just dust leftover from nicer leaves. The problem with a tea bauble is that it's pretty small, and not many leaves can fit and expand properly. I don't know what leaves are in the pyramid, but I guess they're able to expand properly and are probably nicer leaves than whatever was in the bag. At least that's my experience.
I have been drinking tea all my life but I have never seen someone seriously drink tea with milk
No one can convince me that pyramid is best, loose leaf is so much richer in flavour.
Next, a episode dedicated to coffee. lol
Finally the tea episode. Also if you want to know my perfect cup of milk tea recipe. Water at 195 degrees F, seep one minute less then the instructions. Add milk first enough to cloud and reach top for a second (extra creamy almond milk). Honey (amount varies with cup size. Usually 2 spoon fulls for me). I eye everything but it works.
why do you people act like british tea is special? everyone's got their tastes
Had to pause. Yes everything makes a difference Tea is so simplistically complex. You get the tea you deserve. It's like rolling dice. Some days you jst dnt play.
As an african american this was inspirational
As a brit, I can safely say that other brits who pour milk in first are the enemy
Tea
Did not go into anywhere near as much detail as to compete with British tea aficionados I’m afraid… My best friend drinks 10 cups a day, and has been mixing 50 or so blends with each other in different types of loose and bag tea concoctions for different times and using different pots / serving methods for years to try to find her fave tea experience 😂 You cannot compete xx
Okay sure, but i'm with Mat. The best milk is no milk. You gotta do a part 2 where you test sugar, honey and lemon
When it came to the last test of which vessel to use you pored hot water in to a subject 3 time heating the glass and disstorting the temp of the tea its self
I have tea for the hole year
I can honestly say that I only agree with one rule - DO NOT USE A MICROWAVE! Honestly, if my kettle broke, I will just boil water on the stove before I use a microwave. I will not, however, be adding milk to any of my teas unless I'm drinking a chai blend or I want milk tea/no boba.
Ignoring the idea of adding sugar or honey I see 😂
Am I the only one that doesn’t put milk in the tea?
Do hot cocoa next
as an Australian, a lot of our culture is steeped in British traditions and lemme tell u. 3-4 cups a day is not a terrible amount. Using a different mug each time is an interesting choice though. I have one mug i got given by my sister for my 19th birthday and i’ve used it every day since (im 24 now)
Not me waiting for simply nailogical to be on this episode
As a British person, I've rarely ever seen or heard of someone putting the Milk in first and I think the default for people became to put the Milk in last, didn't know the detail about the Mugs/Cups breaking though I imagine that as soon as the better Mugs/Cups became available that's when they changed it, would love to see a video on the differences between brands (especially flavour, I've run a small test on that myself), the other things added besides Milk like Lemon (as mentioned in The Da Vinci Code), why we don't have tea machines that can make a variety of different Teas like how coffee machines do with coffee and how Tea is made in Asian cultures and how the different flavours affect things
What about water temperature? Every special-tea tea I ever gotten lists the water temperature on the brewing instructions
Another variable (mostly a British issue) is whether you squeeze the tea bag. Some do it for a stronger flavour but, it does release increased tannins. I personally enjoy strong tea, but steeped, not squeezed.
I’m British and I generally don’t know anyone who puts milk in first 😂
What about honey in tea??
as a chinese, i agree with mat that best milk is no milk
Why did the loose leaf not do as well as the pyramid bags?
I’d be more interested to see the difference between how Asian cultures make tea.
I've been working on sprouting an avocado for about 2 months and only very recently got a root from it
why not adding sugar to it
Steph's mom instinct that he was going to spill some of the tea leaves and put her hand out to catch it just before 😂
i think you missed one think, they way you prepare water. boiler, pot or kettle?
" How does one open this bag ? "         the most relatable thing I've heard anyone say in a looooong time
Team no milk in tea!
I have always done sugar in cup then bag then water over the bag finishing with milk after i remove the tea bag. Tastes perfect to me
I only like southern sweet tea and green tea . British tea sucks .
DO OMEGA MART AGAIN MAT
I'm super happy by the first Uncle Iroh Quote of leaf Water.
Hot leaf juice.  Anger Iroh noises.
Me clutching my American southern sweet iced tea: 😚🍵😊
I raw dog all my tea. Adding milk to tea should be a sin.
The only acceptable time for a teabag is in COD,  Gong-fu is the way to go
I live in the UK and I’ve never put the milk in first always after 100%
Skeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!!!
I think there should be a Chinese tea ceremony tea episode
You left a variable untested! The microwave!  Make the same cup of perfect tea with microwave versus kettle! You can leave no assumptions untested >={
Wait people put milk in tea!?!?!??!???
All the tea jokes almost ran me of tea ropes.
Laughs in Gongfu
microwave the tea bag, steep in milk then add water
It's summer though
Ok i might be ruining this but u guys didnt do the type of milk like oat or soy or almond etc
They could of tested microwave water vs kettle water to see if there is a taste difference.
My favorite episode, I LOVE THIS WHAT THE HECK. I think I needed this, idk. I really love tea. That's just awesome.
Everyone Knows deep down "Chai" is the best  ❤️ India
Possibly controversial    I am not a fan of warm tea. I much prefer ice cold sweet tea, especially from Bushes.
So what about ice tea? Is that to controversial lol
No blind tests? Doesn't count.
i had to pause to say, best milk in tea is no milk, im with you mat
I notice you said you brewed all the teas at the *best temperature* for brewing tea. I'm sure you probably got that from some universally accepted fact or tea expert, but why not also test different temps to see how it changes the taste, even if it may not be better-for science?
2/10 video, not enough Iroh
Me as a south east Asia watching this. Tea taste good with condensed milk. Regular milk in tea makes me feels bloated.
as a brit, there is a long going debate about the milk before and after, although we are becoming americanised with the usage of coffee surpassing tea drinkers, most I've spoke too on the topic say milk after the tea,  and they'd be right. I had an ongoing argument with my ex's mum about when the milk goes, even bought her a book on how to make tea for chistmas. zero regrets
I think in the milk in the bottom vs milk on top the cold milk at bottom might not mix properly because of being denser than tea and colder than it. So if it were stirred then only you’d be able to tell definitively if there were a difference. Otherwise it might just be a tea with milk sitting at bottom making the tea bitter compared to a tea where cold milk transferred all it’s heat while sinking down (as cold liquids are denser) and have a genuinely better mix. I do not know for sure though as I did not conduct the experiment myself. But kudos. It was a great video. :)
No
But how much water???
Did you know: the word "tea" comes from the Min Chinese "te" and Mandarin "chá"/"cha²", all written 茶.
I'm going to need a coffee taste test episode
Microwaving water for tea wasn't entirely tested. The tea was steeped in a water and milk mixture and would produce much different result than if the milk were added after (or not at all. I side with MatPat on the milk debate). I will continue to microwave water for tea. :) It's quick to make and most mugs I've used don't have a hot handle. Just be cautious.
Cereal first then milk, Tea first then milk. Such is the natural order.
I just need to clarify that us British are a milk on top nation. The bottom milkers were tragically wiped out in the battle of Earl Grey
this video really inspired me to write.   Like a virtual cup of tea, if you will
Not me brewing my tea for seven to ten minutes for half a decade because my nose doesn’t work and my taste buds are wack 😎
I genuinely didn't know anyone put milk in tea.
Iro, maybe this should be a proverb.
I drink iced tea so this doesnt apply to me
Don't worry about which plate you eat on? Sorry but that's actually pretty important.
After running the numbers, they managed to make a drink that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.
Do the same thing but coffee
Considering my preferred method for coffee is 2 or 3 shots of espresso with about 3oz of hot water and no sugar or milk I probably wouldn’t like British tea.
I got the optimal tea vessel for ya drink ot strait out the kettel
I sent you Some Basic Attention token
Surprised they didn't test color of mug.
15:35  anyone who cooks/bakes or studied quemistry will tell you absolutely yes, it matters a lot the order of ingredients, and many recepies are backed with hundreds of dollars of testing in diferent methods and many happy accidents, i can say there is a recipie of cake that has milk and oddly enough, lemon in it, and it doesn't get spoiled, the key is adding the lemon juice while shaking evaporated milk, cream and condensed milk, and it is tasty
OH the puns....
Every time is tea time - Indians (me)
Ah, it isn't supposed to be just any china, the legend is that bone china is the best for tea or serving food because it doesn't alter the flavor.  It IS often heat sensitive, but it isn't cheap, it is delicate.  You add a little bit of tea to it first and swirl it so you warm the cup then slowly add the rest to avoid cracking.  I'd like to see a follow-up to the container test and it would be nice to see Asian tea serving methods looked at as rinsing the cup and warming it is also part of that process.
Tea'm warm brown bean water, over here.
The history of the tea bag - it was originally a method to give out samples to people who were supposed to treat it like loose tea, but instead they kept it in the bag as it steeped.
I have never put milk in my tea ever. And for all these years, I never knew that was a thing. I just add Splenda to my tea and that’s it.
just let people enjoy stuff, no one alive was in those wars
I love all of the Brits in these comments who think tea is their cultural heritage. 😂
What about the lemon slice? What about sugar vs honey? To shame.
Ive been pouring milk after because of cereal habits I didnt know it had a difference
You should try this After water boils leave it set for 30 seconds and in that 30 seconds or more you make some hot milk Ok so after you got these you add in this order Tea leaves  Hot water Sugar  Milk preferably ⅙ or ⅐ of a cup  And it tastes so good
That's quite the vari-tea of tests
I'm not a tea drinker, but what I found most interesting about this episode was the fact that the vessel didn't make a difference in the taste. I'm a beer aficionado and a homebrewer, and it's pretty well known that different styles of beer are suited to different types of glasses. It's not just a visual aesthetic that has given us pilsner glasses, tulip glasses, dimpled mugs, and steins (just to name a few). It really does make a difference to the aroma and taste of the beer.
Oh you would kick me out of the window if you tried my tea. I use a porous cup, fill it up with water and place a bag in just to put it in the microwave for 2 minutes. The I take it out and almost immediately pour it into a glass filled with ice to cool it of immediately and I squish the bag while I take it out. To top it all off I add vanilla coffe milk. I drank this every day during summer
What, no variable on if it's better with or without a sweetener? And if so if it's better to go with something like actual sugar, or honey, or artificial sweetener and so on? I'm disappointed it wasn't even mentioned, regardless of if it is or not, and if your going to say its because its altering the flavor for the perfect tea, then isn't the milk doing the same? I only started adding some honey originally because I heard the British did it too, and honestly I like it better then just sugar, especially acacia honey, but that's just personal preferences.
A self proclaimed tea connoisseur weighing in -  - No microwave - we want uniformly heated up water - Milk before water (historically) - older (not great) China - cooler milk first will help not break China cups - Loose leaf tea - needs steeping for a shorter duration of time (cannot directly compare steeping times for tea bags, loose leaf etc) - More milk is needed when we are adding milk before serving when we want to brew tea for a longer time  (and longer brewing without milk = stronger, bitter tea)
I love this channel, and I love tea. I do not love how badly Matt and Steph and British guest did discussing tea. For the love of god bring in someone from China, Japan, or India to talk about “traditional tea.” I know Chinese and Japanese tea preparation would blow your mind, the level of control over the flavor by temperature and steep time to the varietal can impart drastically different flavors.
I don't think this has been done and maybe it's nothing but I just heard about a new thing in water flavouring where instead of actually putting anything in the water they add a ring on the top of the bottle that had various different smells like berries or lime and that alters how your brain perceives the flavour without having to put anything in the water. Surely there's a Food Theory in there where you either try various smells of which the ingredients wouldn't ever actually go in water and see if your brain still thinks it's tasting something different. Or alternately actually having lightly flavoured water and seeing if the smell is overpowering enough that it can still alter how you perceive the taste of the water and even overpower the flavouring that's already in there.
You should do the same thing for Hot Cocoa.   Which is better? The more traditional method with cocoa melting in a pot of milk or the Swiss Miss method with hot water, or is it something different? A combination of the two methods, if we use the Swiss Miss method should we be adding cold milk? Warmed milk? Different types of milk? Etc…..
Any chance you could do this same video with the best possible hot chocolate?!?
from the city I'm from (I'm a northener), putting the milk in first is a war crime and if you are found doing it you are ostracised from any friends / friend group your in. I Agree with that.
I almost gaged when he put that much milk in 😂
"You can tell there's a color difference just by looking at it!" As opposed to hearing it? lol
All of this "science" and yet you're ignoring that england has a scientific standard cup of tea for exactly this type of study. tisk tisk tisk
Please learn what a gaiwan is.
Is any one else screaming loudly at the screen yelling "ZERO MILK DO NOT ADD MILK. MILK DOES NOT BELONG IN TEA"   Yes I know British put milk in there tea. I don't care why would you put milk in tea it's gross Rolf.  What just me and matpat....ok
I am very disappointed to see that in a video all about tea not one reference to uncle Iroh was made, truly disappointing.
Hay you should do a spooky month theory on it
16:23 i can See the Camra/Vidoe Shacking From All Of Britten yelling into there Phones ( can you see it Too? )
Here's how you REALLY make tea: -boil water in kettle -add 3 tbsp of Lipton iced tea to a your mug that has a picture of you and Weird Al Yankovich -add boiling water -let cool -enjoy
A love of tea is one of the few thing the Irish and Brits have in common
The best cup of tea I ever had was from a tea house at the end of a Chinese tea ceremony. While the Japanese tea ceremony is mostly about the beauty of the ceremony, the entire purpose of the Chinese tea ceremony is to maximize the enjoyment of the tea. If you get the opportunity to experience a Chinese tea ceremony I highly recommend.
But… but… we already put the milk on second, at least I do although it is a hotly debated topic here in the uk
I remember my aunt scolding me while visiting scotland for putting the milk in first, saying it makes you look poor. AND NOW I GET WHY because it implies cheap drinkwear
And the next time you make tea you should totally use my idea but you’d have to buy like all kinds of different teas like lemon flavored peppermint and buy some peppermint spoons just for extra pepper Mintiness I guess you would say some like cinnamon tea Lemon lavender and like some of the same tea The British tea I guess but like kind of like newer I guess and I guess that’s how you make it mostly and you could probably add milk to it just in case because it supposed to be more like hot chocolate mix with like a bunch of different flavors of tea
In my family atleast, we always use boiling water, not boiled water.
Finally British Theory
Milk goes in tea??? When did this become a thing I'm so confused
coffee next?
FOOD THEORY IDEA: so I know that if you soak a banana in liquid nitrogen it makes the banana hard enough to hammer a nail into wood. SO if you subbed a hammer with bananas and liquid nitrogen. How many bananas would it take, and would you be able to substitute any other foods for other tools?
I’d like a coffee variant of this episode
Get water Hot ( boiling) .. put tea Bag in ,, wait till water is Cool, ( when waiting for Water to Cool , you are Steeping the bag up and down) then when water is Cool To the Lips .  then you put a little milk in , and Sugar ( if you like suger in ur tea) . any other order is wrong ..   see you need to let the Tea bag Sit in the hot water .. so you know, you get the Tea ,, lol ...  putting cold milk in , befor you Even Put the Tea bag is is usless .. that tea bag is doign nothign, its a cup of Water DOwn milk .
Love having other Theory team members appearing on the show and meeting them. Very nice to have made the acquaintance of Tom. I love Food Theory in general because we get to see our hosts instead of just hearing them. Also because we always seem to learn something new from an idea that more often than not isn't expected to really achieve anything by the team. So it's a lot of fun to watch.
I pretty much always prefer mixed tea so it’s got like a bunch of different tea packets in it plus hot chocolate I guess you could mix a little bit of coffee in with it I did once but it just turned out more tar but still it was really good Plus I think the other only thing I would ever drink on a hot day is mixed root beer because it’s got like half lemonade half sweet tea and have fruit beer and all kinds of different sodas like orange crush and Coca-Cola and like seltzer water it would be really good it has been a long time since I added seltzer water though To my mixed root beer but that’s OK I’m still happy with mixed Tea that’s why I think you should try it next time
My dad owns a tea store called hemp and Tea  in North Carolina the tea is really high-quality if you want to check it out
Despite Australia being a former British colony/prison I have never been a fan of the more stereotypical aspects of food culture from over in the United Kingdom. I've got relatives from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England so I've got most of the area covered. Shortbread from Scotland is amazing and I feel like Americans would like that since it's essentially just butter and icing sugar mixed with flour. All the good stuff. Vegemite or marmite was always at the breakfast table and while my family ate it I thought it tasted like something I won't describe here. Love a scone that also is thought to have originated in Scotland. Their sweets are great. Just don't look at what they eat for the actual meals. It's not great. Never been a big fan of tea strangely enough even though all my relatives have their favourites. It just brown water. I wouldn't go all Tik Tok method because at that point you're not drinking tea are you? You're adding colour, a slight tea flavour and a tiny bit of hot water to your milk and sugar, not the other way round. Just have hot milk at that stage. Why even pretend it's tea?
Now all we need is the "proper" way to make your coffee.
How to cook instant ramen pls, or a 101 different types of ramen ❤❤❤❤
i was About to say the SAem thing , rise the cup out , then put it in the Sink at the end of the day
MatPat, your "scientific excellence" left a lot to be desired... Where are the experiments with different types of milk on your tea?   How am I supposed to know which one is better? (in taste, not health) is it whole milk, is it 2%, is it any of the substitutes?  Matthew Patrick, I DEMAND ANSWERS (fake tirade concluded, great vid)
I am English, and I was taught that if the tea was pre-brewed, then you should add milk before the water if not vice versa.
Mf just made my cup of tea. Only thing I live in uk and have never seen a pyramid tea bag wtf. Also who Tf put milk first.
Which type of milk
I like tea!!!!
its not tea anymore if you put milk in it
Nooo when you’re using a teapot you must warm it first!
I love the fact that, despite the internet existing as she had to upload her Tik Tok, not to mention common sense (I wonder why my kettle is overflowing when I put the leaves in it?) this woman decided that she'd go to Tik Tok for her answers instead of a quick Google search. She had to be trying to go viral right? This is a Nyquil chicken situation. Especially for Brits when it comes to tea she's doing what amounts to a war crime at every step of the way.
I'm a weird Brit who doesn't drink tea or even coffee lol. I do make tea for others and am always bemused by all the compliments I get. Here's how I make it: Tea bag in mug Hot water from kettle poured in. Teaspoon compresses bag at bottom of mug half a dozen times. Bag is squeezed up the side of mug with teaspoon as I bring it out. Milk goes in. Stir. I don't think I do anything special but the tea drinkers do!
But WHY can't you use the microwave??? You never actually tested if it actually made a difference. You just tested the crappy TikTok method with way too much milk. Wouldn't it be better to find the microwave time length to have it at the right temp and THEN test it?
My fav hot drink is depression
Oh Matt, just an FYI, your "perfect tea" is exactly how its made in Northern Ireland.
as a brit it goes; teabag first then water poured over, steep it for a bit and then the bag comes out, sugar comes next if you're that way inclined and last but not least a splash of milk
Make a food theory blanket please!
Not just tea. How Americans make almost anything is somewhat controversial. For example, when Starbuck tried to open up in Australia and I guess assumed they'd be as big of a hit here as they are in America, they seemed to not realise Australia has a pretty hardcore coffee culture and what they do their "coffee" just doesn't cut it so after opening stores pu everywhere pretty quickly they were driven out of town just as fast. All I typed into Google was Starbuck in Australia and apart from the Starbucks website every single result on the first page was about how badly Starbucks had failed in the Australian market. It's actually quite interesting. Americans have a unique way of doing things that works very well for them. This isn't supposed to be a dig. It's just that for whatever reason the rest of the world isn't always as receptive. You do you America.
couldn't call it Hot Leaf Juice, eh? Matt?
6:17 😂💀
As a brit I never use a teapot and feel the order I do it makes sense. You pour water over the teabag and sugar, you then squeeze the teabag on the edge with a teaspoon to drain it and get the most tea out before throwing it away and you then add milk. Milk weakens the tea so it makes sense to create the strong tea first and then add milk or you're fighting yourself.
James may is absolutely going to hate it that milk last is a superior tea. During an episode of James may man lab, He had a augment among the camera crew of how the milk should go first or last.
To my knowledge, The flat tea bags are the lower quality leaves, and literal leaf DUST from processing the loose leaf... So there IS a difference in quality, even for the same brand.  Also no milk!!! I wanna taste the shrubbery
Wait, theres milk in tea?
Honestly I wouldn't mind seeing a part 2 of this with other teas
I know absolutely no one who puts their milk on the bottom, that tradition has definitely died out (at least in the north). I didn’t even know u were supposed to put it first?? 😭
I'm from the uk and you guys make me laugh 🤣🇬🇧
Guess they spilled the *tea* about our *tea*    *the jokes made me do it
In the olden days I was rich so I put my tea in strong mugs so I have always put milk in the top
I laughed when I heard stephanie say it needs sugar. put sugar in tea, typical american
I don't know anyone who does milk first.
This will be the best episode of the show...and yes I'm wildly biased lol. Also I had to stop the episode and comment IMMEDIATELY to state my outrage at the audacity of putting a tea mug in the microwave.....goddamn savages!
calling the daily mail a newspaper is incredibly generous
I was always taught to just add sugar and honey.
you sure steph is italian-american? you sure she's not... british.
So according to a quick google search for liden tea i should let the blossom soak for 15 minutes, so 3 mins for normal bags, 5 for leaves and 15 for blossom type teas? Or is it actually too much?
It's Tea, then milk then sugar. In Britain it's actually more common to do milk 2nd these days.  Bone china or glass are the best drinking vessels
as someone that also drink four cups a tea a day, this is the best video ever
What if u put almond milk in tea?🤔
Everybody in the UK puts milk in next, it’s completely standard.
I understand that there's a "correct" way to make tea or whatever, but like, let people drink the beverages they want to drink the way they want to drink them? Unless they're making the tea *for you* why does it matter how they make it? Imagine if I went around telling people that putting ice in their diet coke is the wrong way to drink it because I personally don't like ice in my cold beverages.
Fun fact: Tea Time is such a universal practice in Britain that their power grids actually have to account for the spike in consumption from everyone heating up their kettles at once
He should do a video of the McDonald's Mc Rib!
matpatt there was 1 thing you forgot to test and that was when you put the tea bag in. Im talking about the steeping. if you should just let it sit there or lift it and lower it back down over and over again like I do, and etc
You should do a food theory episode on the best way to wash dishes since it can affect how food tastes
NOBODY adds just one teaspoon (5ml) of milk. That’s extremely rare.
imagine putting milk in... ur tea.......
I’ve never put milk in tea😊
Yeah matpat is right, good tea is tea without milk.
One thing you didn't test is if microwaving the water actually matters
Let’s get an expert on leaf juice from Asia… from someone from a colonizer country whose country took tea from China and gave them major drug addiction instead. You might need some heavy caveats in this video cause I’m pretty sure there are experts with thousands of years more experience than the British.
Anyone with class can agree that Yorkshire Gold slaps twinnings or PG tips any day.
NO MILK IN TEA
Yay i adore tea
Why didn’t you try different kinds of milk?
Part two: Sugar methods       Honey, agar, traditional sugar? Dose putting the tea big in before your pour the water effect your tea  Can you tell I like tea
This changed my perspective of tea
“3-4 cups a day” “As it becomes the winter season”  What IS THIS? In Britain we drink 5 cups of tea a day every day of the year. This stuff runs in our veins.
three or four cups a day?  The entirety of the UK: THOSE ARE SIMPLY ROOKIE NUMBERS YOUNG LADY!
This was fun to watch, even if I prefer to stick to my herbal tea 😅
Yall shouldve tried diffrent sugar amounts also to truly get the perfect tea
1:50 nice dark knight reference
Look if your making Ur tea in a cup you always put the milk last. You would only put the milk first if pouring from a teapot, and even that is out of Vogue.  I don't know who that guy is but we need to see his English credentials.
Alright, but what if different milks were better?
So I don't use milk but does using whole, 2% or any other type of milk make a difference?
This came out perfectly with me being sick…bless up for tea when ill
Southerners watching this: "where's the ice and bag of sugar?"
One test I would have been interested in is adding the milk in warm vs cold.  I enjoy my hot beverage to stay hot for a while and not be immediately cooled down, would that affect the taste or just increase the duration it was warm?
5:54 As a person who is not British, though I live in Europe and we make tea very much the same ways as they on that (imo weird) island do, I litterally scremed at the top of my lungs "NONE!"  I feel like adding milk to a tea is as barbaric as one can be while preparing tea. I pesonaly would just throw up if I had to drink tea with milk (like when you are dared to do something really disgusting on a reality show, that would be my thing) and even if you ask people on the street 99,89% would answer the same way. It's disgusting, just... NO.  Fun fact _(Meintioned my Mat, but I was so infuriated by the idea of making tea with milk)_ : Did you know milk was originally added to tea because for a pretty long time Britain had (despite being the bigest empire where sun didn't set) no access to a quality ceramic, so their cups would break when filled with hot water. Milk was used to cool the beverage to a state where the cups wouldn't break.
You left out a key component; warm the pot or cup before making it!
The best kinds of teas are Twinings Earl Grey and Twinings Irish Breakfast, and at the end of the day, an herbal Peppermint Tea is wonderful. I typically drink 8-10 cups a day, about 2-3 Irish Breakfast, 3-4 Earl Grey, and 2 Peppermint. Sometimes I'll have Darjeeling.
3-4 cups a day whahahahahaha. So do we but we have them large 500ml cups
I agree with Mat milk does not belong in my tea.
Also first cup of tea while kids are still in bed is like a warm hug of the soul.   P.s. pg tips are superior
warm leaf water 😂
Milk was added to the cup first because the porcelain would break from the heat of the tea
Beste tea has no milk
i dont know what you think butas a brit I have NEVER put milk first
Nah im welsh and to properly make tea is tetly tea bag and 2 tea spoons of sugar and then pour water fron the kettle, swish it round and take it out, then milk
I'm really sorry but I don't like tea or coffee. I wish I did but I only like hot chocolate 😂. Still love the video, though. It's very interesting. Take this: 👍🏻
Nowadays us brits only put milk in after, historically only the poor put the milk in first.
Waiting for a video of the best way to drink coffe
I’m not British, but I looooove tea and making it and even I am mortified, borderline offended 🤨😒by that “hack” that that lady presented, especially when she used the microwave 😖. I did enjoy this episode though ☺️
15:17 I would be honored to own a cup that once belonged to THE MatPat. C'mon Mr. Patrick you know some of those don't match your set. Hand one over. 😂
MY TEA DOES NOT SUCK!             I drink *coffee* not tea.
Great video!
This frustrated me and made me laugh at the same  time
Can we do a second part to this? Where we talk about the right way to make green tea? Because most people use wayyy too hot of water.
There is a cartoon bunny face on the yellow background
Okay but what about almond milk, oat milk or any other alternatives? That definitely changes the flavor by a LOT and specially since a lot of people are lactose intolerant they can't enjoy tea with actual milk unless they decide they have no such weaknesses.. myself included which means I'll use regular milk anyways knowing the consequences 🤣
Milk in cup first is only when brewed in a tea pot, if brewed in the cup the milk goes in last to prevent the milk clogging the tea bags.
I'm barely a minute in and I just want to say as a big tea (and herbal infusion, cuz I can't be drinking real tea with it's caffeine all day) I have my one favorite mug that I reuse for several days in a row before washing. Quick note: I don't put in any milks or sweeteners, I think those should get a rinse out between fill-ups. Also, there is no objectively "best" way to prepare tea. Tea is subjective.
You never gave us the best suger recomendation, how am suppose to have the perfect tea now!
As an English person who doesn't even drink tea (yes we exist) the tiktok tea hurt me
look at matpats face at 11:37
I’m surprised they didn’t try putting the teabag in the cup and then pouring in the water
As Brit... I've never drunk tea so I don't care what you say about our watery milk
W MattPatt for making a good title
2 things milk dosent belong in tea and 2nd the longer you steep your tea the better it tastes
Happy to know I do all of this already xD as a British non tea drinker it’s nice to know I’m doing it right for others xD
Bruh my server at waffle house said if I let my tea cool or add some ice to do it quickly, it would basically be iced tea at that point. I was like... you obviously don't know hot tea. I don't prefer milk but I do add sugar, and cover and steep for a few minutes which usually pleases my bf who grew up with nothing but southern sweet tea and no real tea flavor...
I love hearing his accent 🤣
Putting the milk in first can get you arrested or exiled in many areas of the Uk.
I'm from the UK and I've never meet anyone put milk in first who does that it's like the milk before cereal people
A tad too many tea jokes. Still a good video!
👍 because I had to add an extra like scratch that I love this ❤
as a true Pakistani- THE FACT THAT U EVEN USE TEA BAAGGSS DISGUSTS ME. WHAT TYPA LOW LIFE- hii anyway im caalmm
im so glad for steph, shes gone from eating christmas trees to making tea. Happy holidays
Random person: How many tea puns can you put in a video Matpat: Yes, with certainTEA
Fun fact the uk power gird works at twice the voltage as US grid. This means the kettles boil much faster.
Me who doesnt drink tea:  “ … *ok* “
Great episode I loved it However, you did forget to try sugar or honey in your tea. & ice tea or hot tea, which one is better? There was so much more you could of did with this episode. Would love to see a part 2.
Honestly, I like hot chocolate better than tea.
Use condense milk.....
You got the wrong British person for this video.
What is up with not throwing out the extremes? 1 vs 3 vs 5 mins? Of course it's 3. 2v3v4 might surprise and help more. Same think with milk.
Nice video but I prefer hot chocolate so if you were to do a video on that it would be appreciated by us!
How can you forget to try different kinds of water knowing that tea is like 95% water?
At 16:15 saying you have offended Brits and our Tea is wrong. Go watch Doc Brown's music number on "Proper tea". No Brits put milk in first  Edit: Sorry guys. I love your videos but this is just a lower quali-tea video
Proper British tea. You know, from India
I feel like Matt absolutely despises tea but still is trying his best to remain impartial
Im learning about osmosis i gave this example is school my teacher considered it correct
I'm sorry, but you put the tea into hot water, and not hot water onto the tea?
pure tea no sugar no milk is the best
Mattpat I AM GOING TO SOFTLY KICK YOU, I have never seen anyone use milk first
Dont let uncle iroh hear you about tea is just hot leaf water also lots of dutch people also love to drink tea and if ask us for milk and we say yes we say een wolkje (a little cloud) but i think its the same as a splash
As a Russian, we fill the teapot with a very highly concentrated tea, and then we can use it many times by just mixing it with hot water.
Watching this as I make my morning tea and now I’m questioning everything
Oh, me and Steph use the same type of tea, cool! I'm talking about the English Breakfast teabags.
6:29 Steph's Spidey Sense tingled
meanwhile chai drinkers: 🤨
I've also found a big flavor difference  in how you boil your water. Between a kettle, a metal saucepan and a glass saucepan. The glass has the best flavor of tea in my opinion. I believe it is the metal flavoring the water.
I love how the final result was pretty much how I make tea anyway
Theory idea: best hot chocolate. With or without marshmallows, water or milk. Packet or homemade, hot chocolate or warm chocolate milk!
Of course you needed a reference to the first part of the "how to win at among us" video you made about a year ago of game theory. Don't think no one would get that reference. (In that video he says that others "mearly adopted it, but I was born in it; molded by games like it" and in this video he says the exact same thing just not directed at himself)
1. put the kettle on.  2. pout the boiling water into a mug. 3. tea bag in the tea. 4. take out the tea after like 15-25 seconds and chuck in bin. 5. put how many sugars you want in the tea. 6. put milk in.
MatPat is right though- the best kind of milk in tea is none.
All tea is wrong. Smells like hot water run over horse manure. Tastes like moldy leaves in hot water. I truly do wish United States would have went with cocoa instead of coffee but both are far superior in aroma and taste than tea. That's why the United States through that crap in the river, at the Boston tea party.
Why *not* heat the water in the microwave though?  Is it the idea that you're getting smells / flavors from other things that've been cooked in the microwave? If that's the case, would you also want a tea-specific kettle that only EVER boils tea / water for tea, in order to avoid other tea flavors / smells getting into your beverage?
What about Chai or matcha? I'm hoping for a series of this XD
I did this exact experiment during my first year of uni (uk) and we didn't find milk top or bottom mattered... but we made the tea in a pot then pored it lol
“She goes through 3-4 cups a day!”  I love how I’m from England so that’s genuinely a normal amount of tea. And that’s not including several cups of coffee as well (not talking about me personally but a lot of people I know drink this much tea and coffee)
Only watching for Uncle Iroh 👍
I honestly don't think milk would be good in tea, this might be weird but I use sugar and sometimes even lemon but tbh for me milk in tea does not sound good.
Dumb frog. Still living in Muppets era
Fun fact the difference between milk first and hot water first was originally class based the poorer brits would put milk in first to keep the cup cool as putting the hot water in first would break there poor person mugs Or so they say  And after watching the video I've realised he said that
I know you guys said that you couldn't think of any other variables, but have you considered how much of a difference small, medium, and full leaf tea affects flavor? Or whatever those different sizes of tea were. It feels like they could make a pretty big difference.
While milk first may be the traditional way, that's not how Brits make tea nowadays. Everyone I know adds the splash of milk in at the end
You guys pour milk in your tea?
and bye the bye, here in the colonies we do not measure by millilitres.  it's not sixty five ml, it's a quarter cup.  30 ml is two tablespoons.  27 ml?  who can measure that??
26ml of milk, okay, but how much water? Or do you put in 26ml no matter the amount of water? :D
‘3-4 cups of tea a day’ *pushes up glasses*…pathetic (me a British person on my 7th mug)
Lack of mention of China feels remiss
0:30 “3 or 4 cups” Me a British dude: *Pathetic*
putting milk in first will give you funny looks over here.
5:50 As a British person: 1. Pyramid tea bag, 2. 1milk : 5 water 3. Hot water, steap, then add milk 4. 3 or 4 minutes 5. Any thing but a travel mug, it makes the tea taste bad
17:11 Fun Fact: In Portugal where tea is a decent thing we don't drink it with milk. we just pour the tea and that's it. In everything else other than the mug thing,we drink it in ceramic think, we drink tea like our old british friends.
Uhm intro please where was it lol
in Britain as long as its tea we're good
Ill admit, as a lover of tea, as someone who drinks far too much of it, When Im at work I have no choice but to use a microwave, pour in milk then come back to my desk to add tea bag and a bit of honey. I get that its not proper but A girl does what she can with the limited resources available to her during a nine hour shift!  edit: when im home I do everything right, haha
What about water first vs tea bag first? That would probably make a difference.
APPLE CIDER???
Dear Food Theory,  I am writing to inform you that you forgot a variable that should be an entirely another video because why the heck not- it’s the amount of sugar that should or shouldn’t be added to a cup of tea and when to add z sugar to get the maximum taste.  I think this would provide another video of around 10 minutes and probably another spiffing afternoon of tea drinking  From your UK tea drinker  Ps: I always add my milk last the taste is just better imo :))
Matt I think the Simpsons are in Illinois since Illinois’s capital is spring feild I don’t think I spelled it right
I m Italian and I have never put milk in tea never even think about it
you should not have milk in it, if you do its an abomination
26ml of milk is how much on terms of "x parts milk to y parts tea"
Wonder how many of my british, tea drinking friends I can annoy by telling them they're making tea wrong.
Worst thing about this is the red capped milk
No British Person puts milk on the bottom that is a literal crime
I'm so disappointed that Matpat called it Tik-Toc tea and not Teak-toc
British person here.  How I make tea: Circle tea bag 3 teaspoons of sugar  Boiling water A drop of milk Remove tea bag Stir Enjoy
Ok mate I’m from Britain myself and if you tell us to stop our traditions then you’ll be rifting down those pear stairs
You should do other tea experiments from other countries too! (and coffee or hot chocolate 030)
If I want to make tea will go to the Chinese who gave it to the world!
I couldn't help but latch on to Steph saying "it needs sugar"... I wonder if using creamer instead of milk helps/harms the taste? Like do the whole pyramid thing and 3 minutes thing yadda yadda but then use cream instead of milk. Like how coffee drinkers add flavor by using creamer instead of milk? Would that lessen the amount of sugar the average person adds while still cooling the tea (which I'm assuming is the point bc I'm with MatPat here... why is milk?!?!?) AND getting the sweetness/flavor you prefer all in one? And since it's cream not milk does THAT go in first or last to make a difference overall? Hmmm...just a thought!
Fun fact: The idea of a tea bag was created by accident. It used to come in big blocks that they would just shave off a little at a time and long story short someone started selling it in a bag to transport it and the customers didn't realize they were supposed to open the bag
"once again, the middle choice is best" this is the goldilocks episode.
so this isn’t a collab with simplynailogical…🧍‍♀️ I guess I’ll stay and this will be background noise
they add less milk, but their tea cups are smaller than the mugs we use
in what way does microwaved water makes it different than boiled water though? Both are ways to heat up water, it does not change its molecular structure, there is some science missing here
don't you mean hot leaf juice?
then ... there is personal taste.   I actually like a long steeped tea.  my wife wants about two minutes.
why does classic tea belong to Britain???
i'm from the UK, and here we actually have the milk on top, or at least thats how everyone around me has it (i live between brighton and london) but i'd say that what you have concluded is relativly accurate. on thing i will mention is the brand, it's either yorkshire tea (or better yorkshire gold) for its great taste, or pg tips for it being really common, and their mascot is a funny monkey.
I like tea and im from the uk. I defor hot chocalat.
Whole leaf loose tea, basket style steeper, 3g tea per cup, 212°F filtered water, 5 minute steep, double walled glass cup, dash of whole milk, sugar to taste. Done.
how much milk? none.
You guys just let the tea swim all willy nilly in the teapot, I use my tea strainer in my tea pot. I also place lemon and ginger slices in there as well. It's yummy! Now I don't yuck no ones yum but I am not too sure about adding milk to my tea lol
I swear I'm like the only British person who doesn't like tea
Agree with u matpat, no milk in my tea please....however, I do like a splash of honey (helps soothe sore throats and helps with that acidic-ness if u leave the bag in too long....which, thank u to this episode, I totally do lol)
17:32 "What is the best thing to drink tea out of" - Of teapot
I want to know what part of the UK Tom grew up in because I don't recognise his accent.  Sounds to my ears like the forced British accents American actors use.
What about type of milk?  Skim, whole, 1% 2%
Making tiktok tea in front of foreign British sounds like one of  the worst torture method
I will never ruin my nice tea with milk.  However, if it is the cheapest tasteless industrial no brand teabag I can find, then yes, I can pour milk in it, so that at least I feel like drinking something, maybe.
But there are different sized tea Steepers, so wouldn’t a larger tea steeper that provides ALOT of room for the tea to move around in, be the best one?
hi Oxy gen!
You just scientifically proved that i made tea correctly
Yall should have tested whether it's better to pour the water over the teabag or dip it in
no
You should see if a lobster can be the president
For my tea I've always done kettle, boil, teabag in a mug- water on top, milk in, teabag out  I am British and don't like tea- though I don't do hot-drinks as a general so possibly the reason
As a brit idk anyone who puts milk in first, I've always put it in after. But a great video :3
It’s just the Scottish way of making tea. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
7:26 "It gives the tea leaves more room to move around"... ehm ... why not just adding tea leaves directly (without paper bags)
Y'all should make Gong Fu style tea
the fact everytime i saw this video i was drinking tea
fun fact some British ppl or just me always has milk on top
Ok, I want to start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this episode. While I am more of a coffee drinker than a tea drinker, I do enjoy it on occasion and it is nice to know how to get the best experience when I do.  That being said.  I am going to call you on one thing. During the last portion, when you said that the glass cup holds on to the temperature longer, that might be correct, but you also used that glass mug to pour into the other two mugs. Each time you poured the water from the kettle into the glass mug, you were warming up the inside of the mug and cooling the water slightly before pouring the water into the other 2 (still cold) mugs. By the time you poured the water into it for that mug's tea, it was starting at a warmer temperature within the mug and was able to hold onto the heat longer as a result.  Still, a good video overall and all the other information was very helpful. I am planning on a trip to the UK next year, so I will wait and see how the (presumably lots) of tea I have there compares in terms of preparation. Thanks Food Theory!
I will fight a person who makes that tiktok tea
1:51  - "They were born in it. Molded by it." - China, Japan, India? - "We needed someone British" - Pathetic
As a Brit, I've never known anyone to put the milk in first (You just can't gauge what the colour of the tea will be that way)
Wait does the thing say one day ago? How did I miss that I immediately click any theory notifications
What about sugar or condensed milk?
Whomst summon me the English one!! Thou hast spoilt thine tea. if it is to be warmed it will be in a kettle of either steam or electric opposed to the heresy that is a "micro-wave (shivers)
https://youtu.be/tR-3BMignl4?t=93 Food TEAhrist  ha ha. . .   ._.
Most of us Brits do pour the milk on top. The only time I have ever seen it done the other way round is at caffees, but you can just ignore that.
Point of order: 1 part milk, 4 parts tea, is 1/5 (or 20%) milk, not 1/4.
Did you not pre warm your teapot?
Wow. That's how I have my tea. I will have to try milk first to find out the difference as I didn't think it would.
htnaks
To be honest I had never heard of putting milk in tea until a few months ago. I always put honey in my tea. This video made me want some tea now.
I'm British and I love tea I go through 4-5 cups a day I've drunk it since I was 6 I'm 11 now actually I'm drinking one right now
You guys use water and milk for your tea? I just eat the tea leaves
Historic milk in first was due to porcelain cups ... they broke easily ... heatshock was the most likely thing to break them  Plus Tea was horrifically expensive, so milk first would let you see if the milk was off ... Tea was locked up   The Nanking Cargo - a ship sunk in the South China sea full of porcelain that sold for millions, the real cargo was the tea it was packed in the China was just ballast  Now tea cups are cheap, as is tea, and Fridges exist ... add the milk last ... LIKE ALL BRITS DO...
„It seems like [mugs] are like rabbits multiplying in my cabinet“  I‘m not a big Tea drinker, but my GF loves Tea, and this perfectly sums up how I feel about the cups.
Oof. Queen tea over royal-tea, missed out on a quali-tea pun there MatPat, what a missed opportuni-tea
Mat seems like he is nit interested and just tries to make tea interesting
You can add milk to the cup first or last if you are using a teapot. But if you are using a teabag in a cup, you cannot add milk first. The water needs to be very hot, just off boiling, to brew the tea and milk makes it too cold before it's brewed.
Love the episode and the theme you picked, but just like Steff, I'm a huge tea enthusiast myself, so in my years of tea-making, I noticed some more variables that I'd love to see tested:  1- How to heat the water? Of course not microwave, but I see some difference between slowly "heated over the fire" tea-water and fastly heated in an electric kettle (where also, the water is in contact with the metal piece that heats itself, what could influence the taste maybe making it more metallic-y  2- Whats the best tempreature? should we let the water boil like most people do or stop right before it? or even before maybe?  3- Stir the tea or let the bag soaking unmoved? I usually bounce the bag up and down, because it gets the flavour faster, but does it influence the final result?  4- Does the material of the "bag" make a difference? for example, the usual fabricky-bag vs. the metalic leaf-dipper like the one in the video or the ever more common plastic-dipper?  5- Should you dip your tea-bag in the hot water, or pour the water on top of the tea-bag (as I do sometimes because while I wait for the water to heat up I have already oppened the tea bag and rested it inside of the mug)? A Similar question would go for loose-leaves teas made in the tea-pot. Do you pour the hot water on top of the leaves? heat the water already with the leaves inside? or throw the leaves loosely on top?  Anyway, this are just some ideas of how you could try to improve your tea even more, and I know many other ideas might come since the world of tea is so fascinating haha Ah, and btw, I'm 100% on MatPat's NO MILK side of things haha, why ruin this perfect, simple drink by adding milk on it!
I swear to god if you make another tea pun I'll bash in your teath.
My tea is perfect cause I’m British 🫖🇬🇧
1:30 you mean cometea?
Question: does it matter what kind of milk you use for tea?
As a Brit, milk has never gone in first.
The film comes from hard water
I recommend brewing for at least 10 minutes and to squeeze the bag best tea you get.  Gives you that nice poisonous bitter flavor with the after tangle.
Stephanie is the expert of tea..
I like making royal milk tea- instead of seeping the tea in water. Seep it into milk directly. And make it sweet!   So good 🥰
Please, MatPat jumping when milk being on top or not makes a difference, Is Just so adorable Where can i get a husband like that too?
If coffee is soup, isn't tea green leaf soup?
I'm a brit and I have never seen anyone put the milk in first
I love how the conclusion was “the brits are right, just pour the milk on top” because everyone I know pours the milk on top — a Brit
Earl Grey is the best tea in my opinion as a brit!
I'm not offered but everyone in the uk poars water first then milk
Slight confusion. The milk was originally put In first because the fragile bone china of the early tea days did sometimes crack. This doesn’t apply now and any talk of one method being posher than another is irrelevant, just don’t put too much in. Definitely a big leaf, three minute, pot (or large bone china mug if in a rush) for me. I gave up drinking milk with tea after changing to plant milk, which is truly hopeless if you don’t want to overwhelm the tea. Tea should taste of tea not milk. It takes a weeks commitment to give up milk and now I can’t drink it at all.  It’s opened up a whole new appreciation of different tea flavours, Russian caravan and pure Assam being my faves.
Milk in tea makes me wanna cry
The best vessel is a 2 ltr mug
My one gripe with this video is the use of a tea ball for the loose-leaf tea. When loose-leaf tea is brewed, the leaves expand to 2-3 times their original size, allowing for an even extraction. A tea ball doesn't allow the tea leaves to open up correctly, leading to the weaker tasting tea in the video. If you did the same test again, but with a tea strainer that allows the tea to open up properly, the loose-leaf tea would have won easily.
Milk? No. Lemon, you infidels.
YOU PUT THE TEABAG IN FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!
Im a brit ive always done milk last
How mat, steph, and tom just trying making tea in the kitchen just made this episode better. (My opinion)
8:08 are they all using the same cup?
So by the logic of the teabags it should help to puff up your non-pyramid teabag, I guess.
I'm British you are wrong 💅🏻
Feel that first test is flawed when they know who and how it was made instead of a blind taste test.
as a british person, I only know one person who pours the milk first, and they have been relentlessly bullied for it
Ah yes MatPat, I fully agree with you. The best tea is milk free. And I'm British, so I'm commonly viewed as a heretic.
3-4 a day. That’s how many I drink in a morning
00:29 those are rookie numbers
As a Kazakh, I live to tea. 3-4 cups/day are rookie numbers!
I make my own tea from my own garden.
I’m an Asian British girl, born and raised in the UK and I make my tea with: 1. Use PG tips or Yorkshire tea 2. Put tea bag inside and pour boiling water 3. Soak for a little (I’m too lazy to wait 3 minutes so it changes) 4. Remove tea bag and pour milk till a nice colour appears (yeah I don’t have time to measure) Then serve.  Also no sugar!!  I have never poured milk first because then I would add the tea bag then water but the milk ruins the tea bag and I don’t use a tea pot.   I’m like working class so maybe I just don’t have time or money to. But I’m surprised and happy how close I was at making perfect tea already.   He makes tea different to me so I feel he’s wrong but maybe I am just different and wrong.  Edit: PG tips is pyramid shape so that is already correct  Also I am Asian so I make my Asian teas differently, first off: the temperature isn’t 100C but 80C
Who puts the milk in first? I’m British, born and raised, live in England and couldn’t get more British if I tried, and no one I know puts the milk in first and if they did, I wouldn’t know them for long because I’d cut them out of my life
I’m British and i always put milk last
You could’ve gotten a Texan to do it since we pretty much drink it from birth. From conception TEA from birth TEA graduation from high school TEA college debate against democrats? TEA got cancer TEA dead? ferment my corpse in TEA
im very sad this didnt cover even half of what makes a tea "best" water temp, length of steaping, water type (hard soft?), amount of leaves, age of leafs, tea cup material, tea pot material  milk strength.  sugar ect
As a brit I've always put milk on top lol
Now when red the name of the vid I felt hurt mate that you said our tea sucked come on why
Never once in the history of ever have i seen someone put the milk in first on purpose. Because ew. And because youd get ruthlessly judged for it
Almost definitely been said already, but the ‘modern’ tradition is usually water first if you’re making in the mug, but milk first if you’re pouring from a tea pot into a mug.  My understanding was always that putting a teabag into cold milk would mean a weaker brew because it could never get as hot as letting the bag steep in boiling water for a few minutes before adding the milk, whereas it didn’t matter as much if you’re brewing it separately in a teapot (preferably with a tea cosy on for maximum Brit points)
As a Scot, milk first folk get the glare. It's: 1 boil water 2 pour water into desired drinking receptacle  3 add teabag 4 wait 'til diffused or squeeze if in hurry (or non pyramid bag) 5 add sugar or honey, if desired (doing this now allows you to stir without spilling) 6 then and ONLY THEN add desired amount of bovine growth hormone! 7 enjoy 8 feel slightly guilty about what Britain's government's did in the past
British brothers tea beats cOFFEE
As someone who drinks their tea iced, I find this enjoyable.
Man tea is well good sooo cant blame her
Also what king of milk, is it milk, is it 2%, is it almond milk, is it cream, is it half and half, are you using coffee creamer to add flavor, etc
the one day I drink tea and mat pat is already telling me I did it wrong. lol
I am kind of disappointed that Uncle Iroh was not mentioned once on here!
Pour boiling water into your teapot to heat it up first.  DUH.  Loose-leaf ONLY, and if you can get a pot with a laser-cut leaf holder so much the better.  PLUS, tea should be enjoyed in a 8-ounce tea cup with a matching saucer to rest your biscuit on between blissful sips. If you take milk, 1tablespoon only in cup before pouring tea.  You're welcome.
I literally took notes on this one. I agree with Mat on no milk but definitely listened closely on the bag and cup parts
Here's how I make tea: hot water, tea bag, drink it! it's simple. try it!
Matt Pat you forgot to to use a WOODEN SPOON cuase METAL SPOONS take away the teast
Builders tea, how to make a proper brew: Teabag and sugar/sweetener in mug Boil kettle and get milk outta fridge Get ur teaspoon out Once boiled, water into mug on top of teabag and sugar, stir and steep for a sec (I leave the spoon on top of the teabag for a lil sec then stir)  Spoon out ur teabag and do not squeeze it gives a weird flavour Pour in a lil bit of milk until its as dark as ye old regular brick   Builders tea. Aka a regular british brew when your mam and dad ask you to make em tea.  For ref, everyone ive made tea for loves my tea.  Edit: also for ref. Im a coffee person myself, but I make many types of hot tea, i like fruitier teas and i love a good teapot for fancy teatime.
13:39  Mat gets me  "Best milk is no milk in tea " I will where it as merch
Here is the Indian way to make tea based on for 2 people:   - put a cup of water in the kettle (Kettle for you Ig) and heat it up to hot - add 1 cup of milk - Put 3 spon of sugar and 5 tea spoons - heat on high (mid - high) for around 3-4 min and done
Way to “spill the tea” 😉
um,  don't ya mean  Asian?  :3 With things like Tea being isn't it being again from Panasia and Japan then to the UK,  or was it?  lol...   then as  Europeans taken to America  with the whole  'tea tax'  stuff etc,   heh. eh.   oh well.   Still a funny enough thing.   Still just funny when people Talk Tea  if in the Americas about being a thing from the UK yet said things to the UK being from  Asia where  Bricks of Tea  having been along with rice  as a currency  before as much of the Gold Standard became as much a thing.
If you put milk in your tea then do you even actually like tea? Can you even call yourself a tea expert?!? Lol Also you didnt test the ‘pour boiling water directly over the teabag or let the water sit for a minute and dip the bag in’
There are a million cultural traditions regarding tea, and you chose the the worst one lmao. A little disappointed honestly.
amateur, i drink 7 cups of tea a day
AM FROM THE UK NAH MATE NAH NOT IN THE  MICROWAVE
I would have refused to drink that shi-tea tiktok tea, that woman, nay, WITCH, should be locked up for life in our tower of london and be forced to make proper tea for her guards until her meddling hands bleed and her fingers run red raw
TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA TEA
Im british and I do what was considered the best in each category every single time, tyoe of bag, length, amount of milk, poured on top (+ sugar) in a glass or ceramic cup whichever I have.
The mugs arent identical, they have different letters 😂
Boston Tea Party Summarized... that part killed me
I'm with Matpat. Tea needs no milk
As SOMEONE British, I find milk in tea ew.
Hmm, I wonder what the best way to brew hot tea is *clicks and takes a sip of my sweet iced tea*
Only 4 cups of tea a day. Im Irish and I know a lot of people who drink 10 cups of tea a day. Hmm amateur 😅
Love all the tea puns! Since our podcast is centered around tea, you know I had to watch. XD
Putting milk on the top is actually how people from the midlands(not sure about the rest of England ) is you put the milk on top
Say what you want, you’ll never Brit the southerner out of me I prefer my tea sweet. Also with a hint of watermelon, tho that may not be agreeable to everyone.
As a turkish, this video disturbs me in all the wrong ways...  Like how american tea making disturbes british folk.
As a resident british man I always put milk on top anyway
all
So does anyone also know the real use of saucers ? You were supposed to pour tea into your saucer and drink from it, pipping hot tea gets cooler much faster in the saucer, only poor pathetic plebs with small saucers drunk directly from the cup.
When you live in the uk but hate tea with milk: haha I’m in danger
I had to go make a cup of tea after this episode.  🫖
Tea Powder + Water boiling in a pan (boil it for 2-3 minutes)  Put your sugar while the tea is boiling Add milk by your preference (boil it for another 2-3 minutes)  Voila! Your Legendary Tea is ready - looks like MATPAT didn't think about not using the kettle to make tea, if done right this is the best!
Tea without milk is best tea, Mat is right.
What about what type of milk? Does that matter?
As a Brit myself, I have never seen anyone add the milk first
this is a *DRINK THEORY.* not a *FOOD THEORY.* the channel name is *WRONG.*        dont take this seriously bozos
no matpat just........no leave our soups alone.
Perfect cuppa? Yorkshire tea. Saved you 21 minutes.
On behalf of all apprentices and studio hands trying to make a good impression… I thank you FT! 🙌🏻
What about the type of milk?!
We do pour our milk on top 😂
Our tea isn’t wrong! it’s just not very nice to drink… good point
You can only really attain tea nirvana in a genuine British transport cafe.  The proper stuff is boiled for ages until really strong and then diluted with freshly boiled water and served in a mug with a generous splash of milk. Anything else is for toffs and pansies.
As far as I am concerned, you have omitted the most important variable: the origin of the tea used. My suggestion: Use Darjeeling-Tea, prepared in a pot, no milk. Result: Heaven.  Enjoyed the episode. Thank you.
who would have guessed an American on tick-tock doesn't know how to make tea  also you didn't use Yorkshire tea -_-
Haven't watched the video yet but I'm curious to see how a pressure cooker could make tea
Don’t tell steph I drink my milk tea iced
im English:-  we used to make a type of china (cups) that cracked if you poured boiling water in them, that is the only  reason why milk goes in first. i have much better china, so stuff tradition. i brew in a mug or pot depending how much time i have to enjoy my tea. usally a mug and loads of (soya) milk to cool it enough to get out the door. but in an afternoon with a friend, i will use a pot (i have at least 8) sit sip from a nice cup and saucer then chat
Your tea sucks... Mine is brewed from the toughest plants in east Texas through an old sock in a rusty bucket. Strong fortified goodness... Powerful
AAAAAAAA my ears got colonized
I have to say as someone who has a literal silver teapot and a true British heart ALWAYS PUT THE MILK ON TOP, I’ve actually ever heard of someone committing the atrocity of putting milk first until now!  ALSO: for the best tea you can get go to fortnum and mason, I recommend the Princess Anne mix Or the royal blend!
Coming from a Brit. And I say this with 15+ years of making my own tea. And neither of my parents or grandparents have ever made tea milk first. We've always made it milk last.
She should have a tea battle with ''Geoff Marshall'', to see who is the thee expert!
Hey! Where is Kermit the frog scaaam (Amazing content)
Best milk is definitely no milk! Also, "overbrewed" tea for the win!
I'm so happy that there is tea content it's always coffee or hot chocolate that gets the spotlight so seeing tea in the lime light.
Uncle Iroh is coming for MatPat for all the times he calls tea “leaf water”
1. Boil water in an electric kettle 2. Put teabag in a cup 3. Pour water, wait to cool it enough to drink. All done, finished. Idea of milk in tea is... weird to me
I did not know you even add milk in tea 😭 are you suppose to add it to every tea mix? 💀
In my country its summer
BEST MILK IS NO MILK
Why didnt you guys do microwave vs kettle? Thats like the biggest and most controversial debate
i just realised i already make my tea like that, the only difference is if my tea is to weak i might grab a 2nd bag and brew for about 30 seconds to a min as it gets about the same
We need another tea episode with further testing!
You're actually right though with the dish washer. The amount of extra water a dish washer uses vs just rinsing out the cup is insane and the space steph is using up with tea cups can be saved for dishes covered in heavier food
sir it the chinese way or asian way :D, British don't even know the deep of the teapot mystery
On behalf of America we do not claim that woman who made tea
Should I point out of the type of tea you're making. Cause everyone has a different preference of a tea they like.   Is it going to be mild, sweet, sour, super sweet, perfect balance and other selections and so on  Sure there may be several teas that one person likes but only one or two they Absolutely love And how they like it.  It's like coffee or other caffinated  products, aka sodas, Frappuccino, mochas, etc,  We all have all of our preferences so keep that in mind  I like peach tea with a bit of honey and lemon And weirdly cold raspberry tea for some reason XD
Mat you had such a good pun that you could have said you could have said this would be the perfect cup of tea
Please say they are using Yorkshire tea or there shall be dire consequences...
I’m British I know how to make a good tea I need no of you scientific nonsense good sir.
Wait... I'm British and I've never known anyone to put the milk in first 😂 How's that the tradition? 😂
**sips iced paper bag tea with no milk from a tea pitcher poured into a large water bottle** *”yes, I understand this episode of food theory”*
Hey Matpat can you do theroy on how long you can survive on one food
@ 6:31 Steph mom instincts kicked in 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The proper way to make tea: 1. Using the large paper type bag, heating water to near boiling. A drip coffee pot does this well. 2. Steep for about 7-10 minutes.  3. Fill a US Gallon container with ice, these are usually labeled for tea. 4. Put bags on the ice, if you sweeten add sugar now to the hot tea. 5. Pour tea over ice, add water if needed.  6. Squeeze tea bags. 7. Enjoy your proper tea.
Traditional British tea actually comes from India.  Ya that's on brand.
Watch the first 40 seconds at .25 playback speed, It's strangely funny. Also, should sugar be added to tea as well?
It's Finally Here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40XUrnMxM9g
As a British and Indian I would love them to make tea in a saucepan over a stove
9:00
when he uploads, i always have the biggest smile :) ty!
I'm still curious if there is a difference between using a kettle (electric vs stove) and a microwave. Obviously the meme is heating water with a microwave is a sign of poor taste, but is there an actual reason the use a kettle? I'd imagine the microwave would heat water more evenly than an electric kettle, but when the water boils the temperature is the same regardless.
I don't know any Brit that would put the milk in first! There is even a British comedian that did a rap showing disgust at anyone who would commit such a crime!
DO NOT SHOW THIS TO Southern Grandma's!
BUT HEY          This is just a theory            AND CUTTTTTTTTTTTTT!
So my next question. Whats the best kind of milk/ cream to use in tea? Another round?
I was actually doing tests like this just this past week, wondering if I wanted sto make the water hotter or colder, or steep longer or shorter
As a Brit: I NEVER put the milk in before the water. For me it’s always teabag, water, brew then add milk - any other way and I become elitist about it lmao.
Ok we all saw the mugs. M for Mat, S for Steph, but who is the A? It can't be Oliver's unless they spell his name Alliver. So, I am curious who is A?
Spoiler: All tea is wrong. 🤢
well, i definitely don't like British Tea i found
Just shouted "Whooo we are in GT" love from assam
if you put milk in first and something fruity after then milk starts to curd
*tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice*
I’m British and tbh I’ve always poured the hot tea before milk. I always thought that was what everyone did.
I've lived in Britain all my life and only one of hundreds of people over met actually drink tea
I like the theory. The only thing I find it dumb is that matpat didn't show us the differences, he just told us the differences between them, like the color of the tea after letting the bags sit for a while.
i have had so many brits angry at me (an asian) for drinking proper asian teas 🤣
I wish Food Theory would look into whether microwaving water to boil it somehow fundamentally changes the water compared to boiling it on the stove. Because it seems obvious that microwave boiled water is exactly the same as on-the-stove boiled water, but sometimes I run across a person who thinks otherwise. Like a girl I used to know who told me if you boiled water in a microwave, let it cool, and then used it to water plants—the plants would die; but if you did the same with water boiled on the stove, the plants would be fine. 🙄
I love how Britian's 2 defining traits are Big Ben and Doctor Who
This is the video that i wanted But it's missing few important questions How much water and how much tea do i add When i make a tea pot We don't use rea bags So how much tea is necessary for exactly 1 cup of tea
as a brit, i do not know anyone that puts the milk in first.  the only argument im aware of is sugar first or last. (if at all)
Just made the best cup of tea in my life. Thanks Food Theory!
Yeah, I'm with MatPat on the "bet milk is no milk" for tea.
Every normal British person makes it this way anyway
i always wreck my tea bcause i immediately forget about it while it's steeping lol
Sweet/Iced-tea drinking Southerners:  "Are we a joke to you?"
no one does milk first in the UK anymore and ur tea was just a little too milky but ur American so ima lower my standards. the main thing is that u boil in a kettle, mix and press before waiting 3mins for the steeping and then add a splash of milk, the colour will be ur best indicator for when it is right. At the end, add the amount of sugars that person wants.  in terms of etiquette, you must always ask all visitors if they want you to "put the kettle on" and then if they say yes, you ask if they want milk and how many sugars. one tea spoon per sugar. make sure it is served at piping hot so they choose the temperature that they want and it is good to go. always offer biscuits (u guys will call these cookies, we are talking about the cheep store brought one like digestives, borbouns, custard creams) and make sure they get offered another cup when ever the convo gets awkward and a bit before they leave.
3 or 4 cups of tea The British:pathetic     Im British I can speak from experience
"Boston tea party summarized" made me crack up
Hate to ruin your moment of triumph MatPat but as a British person I can confirm that most of us already put the milk in last here across the pond. The story goes that the less well-off put milk in first to protect their cups but if that's the main reason they did it, rather than for a better drink, it can be assumed the rich may have done the opposite. Either way, modern cuppage allows us all to ignore that old rule anyway and although even confined to Britain there is still a divide in opinion, I believe the majority of us do indeed add milk last, and rightly so. Also, Steph is right, it needs sugar. I can happily say though that although Britain has been offended many times by America's attempts to make a cup of tea, your science has done you well, and I hereby accept the results of your experimentation on behalf on my country.
Sorry to be that guy but did you just include Ireland 🇮🇪 in the UK map……. That’s hurtful. Gotta learn your history
I already poured it on top
Now I realize that MatPat is an actual scientist, but a different scientist, a foodasist 😂
tea is also popular in north Africa I live in morocco and we always drink tea everyday (on breakfast and at least once a day)
jesus christ i came here to watch a theory not get my mind absolutely melted because of puns
mmmplease, i will put my milk in first because my british instinct tells me to
That was a good tea party! Last time the Americans and British had a tea party, it was back in December 16, 1773
Is there something going on between Stephanie and Tom, we don't want another very public YouTube couple break up.
You know what they say about tradition: it's just peer pressure from dead people.
Milk in first or last was one of those things a Brit could use to judge social class. Upper class could afford the thin china cups that could break from thermal shock so milk went in first. Lower class people had thick clay mugs so milk went in after.   Thankfully it’s no longer important but you might still be able to guess whether a Brit has a richer or poorer background by how they make their tea.
The correct way is replacing milk with chocolate milk :D
We didn't get to see the tea. They could have just been sipping air. Can't you actually show the visual result please Matpat. Especially since we can't taste it.
3 to 4 cups a day those are rookie numbers you need to get them up try 3 to 4 pots a day and you need a bigger teapot also milk going in first was only for poor people I wouldn’t say it’s a tradition in fact there’s an entire insult around pouring the milk in first if someone was poor you would say they were “quite milk first” You’re not Disproven a tradition you’ve proven what was already widely accepted
I mean if we wanna go technical should have gotten a Chinese person as it was then that gave tea to the British. Therefore the original tea drinkers are the chinese
I 100% agree with you Mat. No milk is the best amount of milk. Also no sugar is the best amount of sugar (though my fellow Southerners may disagree ;-) ).
Tea is properly made in a teapot not in a cup. Also leaves not bags.
No milk in tea gang
Remember that lemon rant that cave Johnson gave in portal 2 , Can you sees if that's actually possible to make a combustible lemon? (asking for a friend)
Here’s a theory: Are nachos considered to be a salad.
Dip the whole tea bag in cold/room temperature water first before pouring in hot water. The bitter flavor from tea is because the tea leaves are burnt by the hot water. The cold water prevents burning.
As a southerner I’m offended that you didn’t get a southerner to help
It is a legal requirement for us British to make tea once not holding
Those tea puns are about as high brow as a frowning caveman, Mat.  Do better. Lol
just gonna say.. no one puts milk in first. or at least round here.
You used the wrong teabags, I don’t know if it’s available where you are but Yorkshire/Yorkshire gold are the best teabags.
who knew the tea was so complicated lol TikTok tea omgosh lol I wonder if Tom ever tried American sweet tea. I wonder if that's an American tradition or not? I've had what we call hot tea but the British have it down to a science lol.
Teabags are used in teapots often, not just loose leaf.
As a Canadian with British ancestry, I feel validated by these results. BUT what if the the type of vessel had an effect on the tea bag? (I.e. you’ve suggested that when your tea is brewed from a pyramid tea bag with milk on top, the vessel doesn’t matter, but what if tea brewed from a normal tea bag produces the best flavour overall only when in a glass cup?) I think further research (aka tea episodes) are required!
Follow-up experiment: determine the ideal steeping time for each type (flat bag, pyramidal bag, loose leaf) and compare the best versions of each.
gonna get called out for showing Cuphead instead Mugman for holding tea . . oof  wow Tiktok just knows little chemistry.  how is the cooled liquid in the milk supposed to do anything in a timely manner??
I was always taught milk goes in last as it would 'clog' the tea bag making it harder for the flavour to come out. No idea on the science there haha but I'm English and already do that 😅
SPANISH GIBRALTAR
Where the heck is the intro with like, matdonalds?
I'm here thinking all of these years. ALL OF THESE YEARS I THOUGHT MATPAT WAS BRITISH
Am i the only one hearing a beeping at 18:14?
Now let's do coffee! Like hot vs cold brew, milk to no milk, and how much sugar or something like that!
3 or 4 cups of tea a day: All of Britain and Ireland: pathetic
You should have got somebody from Ireland. They drink more tea per head than anywhere else in the world. I'm British but my grandad is from Dublin. I drink about 9 cups of tea a day but my grandad's side of the family but me to shame
When mat was saying how british people are born with tea or whatever well hes not lying    Also that tiktok triggered me
4:37 "Aw that's hot. That's hot."
cool now do coffee
I’m British and I have never met a weirdo puts milk first I had no idea that’s what people did
Can I just point out that when we use a tea bag we put the milk in last
3-4 cups a day? those are rooky numbers! i do 4-8 cups a day. Also turks drink more tea than brits.
Milk shouldn't be in tea
No cheap shots here, but …  One – It appears that you did not “warm” the tea pot. No wonder that the mug steeped version was hotter than the tea pot version.  Two – Adding the milk first does, as you say, prevents heat damaging the porcelain. It also allows one to verify the milk is not spoiled before adding and ruining an expensive cup of tea. (Historically: Tea $$$$; Milk $).  I am now searching for pyramid tea bags for my Twinings Earl Grey.
I’m British and I still can’t get over that tiktok tea. I don’t even use tiktok
Food theory is the only theorist channel that doesn't really make sense when you think about it. All the other channels are about theories, but food theory is using science proved facts for a video and the videos aren't really theories they are all true.
Did they actually test microwave vs kettle or was the tiktok monstrosity the entirety of the microwave test?
as a brit i can say most brits will tell you milk goes in last
The theorist tea party of 2022
New theory: is it a sustainable practice to scavenge for and eat roadkill to survive. I'm serious this is theory gold Mathew, you're an idiot if you don't do this.
I agree with Mat cow juice don’t belong in my leaf soup
Indian chai is the best !!
"Warm leaf water" Boy Uncle Iroh aint gonna be happy when he hears that
Americans making memes about British people and tea British people making memes about planess and towers
I hope no one takes any of this seriously.
Food theory idea: does tea actually go well with scones? Or should it go with coffee? Or even hot chocolate? *What about soda?*
Even when burning his hand, MatPat is still musical. You gotta love that.
Temperature is another big factor. The temperature of your water could be the difference between tasting burnt tannins or good tannins, ideally not using 100° C but around 90°, just a little under boiling temp
This just proves I’ve been making the perfect cup of tea my entire life
i already do that as a english person
I literally just clicked on this video and am form england and live hear in London. when I saw it I went straight down stairs and made my self a brew
Well i am from India and i feel that this video is still incomplete as tea is made in a different way in India
I'm surprised cold &/or sun brew wasn't also a test option. Then there's sweet tea, adding lemon or not, and all the other tea traditions around the world.
What about milk type??? Semi skimmed, skimmed, whole, lactose free, alternatives....
Basically an episode of “tea” lore and why it is wrong
“How much milk do you put in tea” me “no none no milk”
I'm not really a fan of tea and there are so many different kinds of tea that it's not possible to keep track of the few that I DO like. I'm just here for the science.
How about a theory about which Caesar the Little Caesar is based on
Personally I prefer my hot tea without milk and a bit more bitter.
0:31 same
You need less Loose Leaf tea for the same brew. Generally Loose Leaf tea is of higher quality than tea bags so the tea willl be of better quality. If you have it without milk you can taste the tea bag too [personally truiied this blind and 10/10 score]. Also no Milk is the best Milk
Funny how the thumbnail references Lipton tea, and it is by far the worst tea money can buy.  Like folks, how’s it “#1 in the United States”?
One random English person.... doesn't constitute an expert.  Stop referencing TikTok.
For better taste try not boiling the water as to not get rid of the oxygen in the water. Also the type of teapot helps too. I've found porcelain to be better than others depending on dark or light tea.
Contrary to popular belief, most British people actually pour the milk in last to their tea. Another point, the type of milk in your test is another variable in your experiment. Tea is most commonly drank with semi skimmed. This allows for a smoother, less sour taste even though poured into the cup first.
I don't see issue with boiling the water (the water alone) in the cup in the microwave, putting the bag in after and letting sit 3 mins
Me needing a 26.5 ml cup for my milk now
Life didn't give us lemons? We crossbred a citron and bitter orange. When life doesn't give you lemons just invent them yourself?
Why do women always love tea my mum also loves tea like why its not bad but I wouldn't drink it every day multible times on its own
I am British and while watching the TikTok I was literally screaming
Hi Tom (I'm celebrating you being British).
My content would be trash if i was a youtuber
For once make tea how Indians make, you need to boil tea leaves in water and then add milk and sugar and try it after filtering the leaves
this guy can open a high end restaurant with this information but simply makes youtube videos instead
im molded in tea?
normal preson thougts : four cups of tea a day is way too much   my/ most brits thoughts: only four cups a day? i have at least 6.
5:10 This is exactly the kinda tea I drink. I don't like tea. I like warm mixture of water and milk, with two spoons of sugar. And bagged tea or coffee from a bag. I am serious. Normal tea and coffee is kinda bitter so why would I wanna drink that
*osmosis* is the first thing iv ever heard on this channel and understood
What about sugar how much sugar should you add
The amount of puns is giving me anxie-tea
Matpat is the Coke guy and Steph is the tea woman
As a brit, i am taking notes.
as a brit, i don't know one single person who uses milk first so idk where this tradition is coming from
We here in the South don't make that stuff in mugs we take big pots boil water dump five or six tea bags into it and make two to three jugs after which we dump around 2 cups of sugar into each jug
Is quality of water is also a factor
I don't use milk in my tea but will try it out later. I once got a avocado to sprout though it took me a few months it was worth it. it is now dead. hopefully yours will sprout and make for a few years
I agree with Matt, I don’t think tea needs milk at all.
Not me pouring milk into my microwaved tea while watching this ☕🤏 👁👄👁
I love British people 😍
It's alright Matpat,  I don't put milk in my tea either
Ahhh! You heated the glass with hot water and then poured it into the others... Only to draw the conclusion that glass was hotter.  This is a classic part of eastern tea culture -- heating your glassware first.
3-4 that’s rookie numbers!! Gotta have at least 50-69
In India everyone has a preference in the tea/milk ratio, but usually is 50/50 or 60/40, and yeah no one has a better milk tea than Indians
Food or game Theorie idea: Cumbustible lemons Can you make lemons combustible? (From portal 2      cave johnson lemon rant)
So many tea puns. This was so funny
Why not microwave the water?
I prefer herbal tea.
Christmas food theory idea, figure out how Santa would survive eating all the food he does.
I thought they would also try different kinds of milk like normal milk and then like oat milk , olmand milk etc…
To be fair my mom drink chai and she has me make it pretty much exactly as you described, except we judge when the tea's good via colour
Rich people in Britain would sometimes actually pour their milk in after the tea as a status symbol to tell people their tea cups were very high quality
I thought he said to steep the tea bag for 30 minutes 😂
Squeezing the bag on the teaspoon is how the professionals do it.
"Warm leaf water" Uncle Iroh would not be pleased.
Who puts milk in tea??????!?!??!?!?
Why does everyone hate microwaves and water? I understand kettles dump some heat but you can't just wait for the microwave water to cool a little?
Irish people actually drink more tea then British people, and we do the milk after the water here
I live in London and all the Brits I know (including my wife) has their milk at the top and not the bottom
Rinsing out tea mugs for later same-day use is perfectly reasonable. You're just going to pour boiling water in there.
Queen Elizabeth watching this 😶‍🌫️
I just made the best tea ever, thanks to you
In my experience a lot of Asian countries and most of Europe don't add milk to their tea.
I'm British and always put the milk in last. Milk is added to colour the tea to the desired colour (which indicates the strength of the tea - darker colour = stronger tea). If you put milk in first, you could over milk it and end up with a very milky Tik Tok tea, but you can always add a bit more milk in if it's not yet at the right colour.  I also don't leave it for 3 minutes - who has that time? I pour water onto the bag in the cup which I find speeds the process and then take the bag out after about 30 seconds but do squeeze the bag a bit to get more flavour out. And what about sugar in your tea? Does that skew any of the results? Mat Pat, I demand a part 2. Great video as always
how my mom makes tea: first u boil water n then add the tea powder and ginger and sugar and anything else u wanna add, let it steep n reduce to half. then add all the milk u want. when this whole concoction comes to boil then u filter it into ur drinking vessels of choice n voila ur chai is done. also I don't have any quantities for this my mom just wings it n it always lands
I love tea. But question, would you say that this could carry across for all kinds of tea?
Wouldn't different (Milks) also change the taste of the Tea. If not why?  🤔
I want more of Tom in your videos!(sort of biased as  I'm also British) #MoreOfTom(GT FT FT)
They forgot that different water also changes the tea flavour
It's said that different teas need to steep for different durations. Will you one day do a part two for this where you test different teas? Best Steph would love that :P
um.. what about jiggling the bag as it brews (you get more bang from cheap, flat tea bags)?  and I NEVER take the bag out as I drink. give me all those tannins!  every other way is wrong
hard water vs soft water, whole milk vs skimmed milk
heh steph is an amatore i drink abt 6 cups of tea per day
I love how they say that England needs to start putting milk in second but I'm British and everyone I know puts milk in second.
We use flat bags and when it's done brewing it the pot and we pour it into the pitcher we put the bag into cold water to let it cool then squeeze the rest of the juice out of the bag
I think it's an oversight that they didn't make the same teas (tea bag, mug, milk) with just microwave water vs kettle water. You make the claim without backing it up with science. Why should the way the water is heated affect the flavor at all?
YOU HAVE MILK IN YOUR TEA!!! EWWWWW!!! THAT IS A NO GO IN NORWAY!!!!
Sugar and milk do not belong in tea! *Ducks and hides
Woah, you didn’t overthrow centuries of British tradition. Everybody I know puts the milk in after. And anyway, milk in before was never supposed to be better, it just protected the cup.
as a British- how dare thee-
And you didn't make ISO 3103 tea?
Bro don’t let iroh hear u call it leaf juice
17:55 - Oh, MatPat. There are SO many considerations when it comes to plating your food. Will just about anything work? Sure. But just like different wines and spirits taste best in the glasses designed for them, there is a treasure trove of advice on plating. Do we smell another food theory cooking up?
My sister reuses the tea bags and it is proven that it tastes stinkier☹
American tells us how to make tea
The microwaved water didn’t taste different though
As a Southern American I prefer iced sweet tea but  even I know Matt Pat missed a type of tea!!!!   The OG tea Which was sold in brick form I'm not joking back in the time of like the British colonies and whatnot he was in like these compressed bricks that you would scrape a little bit off of to make your tea That's the type that Americans threw in the Boston harbor!
I don't want milk or sugar in my tea
as someone from eastern europe, i personally don't put milk in my tea at all, but you guys made me wanna try this so bad 😭
Wait why are you wearing boots in your kitchen? That would be a great theory to cover. I live in Ontario Canada and no one, I mean no one wears shoes in the house. At least not with out being yelled at.😅
As a British citizen, everyone I know adds milk In after. And 3-4 Cups a day is a lot? That is typical morning round
What about water temperature 😅
2:58 and 20:00 I have to ask: why is the microwave assumed bad? It just heats up the water, so it shouldn't be that different, right? I just find it odd that it's the one aspect that went untested, but all 3 are assuming it's inherently worse in some way... Also, what mugs are you using that makes the handle super hot? Mine have only gotten warm.
Huh, no intro this video.
So I am British and I actually don't put the milk first so dunking on Britain most likely is just MatPat dunking on the elderly British people, since the only people I know that put the milk first are my Grand-parents good video though! :D
y'all not put sugar in tea?
Tiktok now scared me now for me being from Britain and living in England 🇬🇧 plus loving tea tiktok scared me
I love tea
Please stop with the tea jokes. They are tea-rrible
... The puns 🙈
01:46 ehheheheheh
Every Asian fan of yours just Did a very slow blink ………
I’m English and I have never once put milk in first
Lol I kind of really love when internet couples air their petty fights online, whether that's mugs taking up dish washer space or whether cups should go mouth up or mouth down in the cabinet or what have you xD
Personally I like to microwave my tea just very efficient on power and time
Listen mat.The queen is gonna revive and you are not gonna exist bro.i am worried for you
As a brit, never once met a single person in England who puts milk in first, always water then milk
To be honest, I've never seen my british family pour their milk first, so the brits have been evolving
1:43 MAT'S REACTION TO HER COMMENT XD
Lol I just eye it when it looks a bit brownish mid pour stop
Dude i didn't even know that you were suposed to use milk in tea honestly it sounds very discusting as i have been drinking tea with just sugar all my life.
I have to agree with matpat on milk in tea. I live in croatia and i have never had tea with milk nor do i think it would be good hahahhaha. We add sugar or honey as replacement for sugar.
Steph only drinking 4 cups of tea and thinking that's a lot, as a Brit, I have 10-15 cups a day. I've had 2-3 by the time I've left the house in the morning
Could you do this episode on sweet tea or iced tea?
Best amount of milk in tea is 100% no milk matpat trueing over here so hard and they just cant handle it
Tea is disgusting
I love Stephanie turning into @Ryan George at 9:00
Watching all of the tea mug exchanges and shared drinking still during times when covid is dangerous really made part of this harder to watch JUST because of those still-ingrained fears from the 2019 era. Not sayin anyone did anything wrong, but remember to stay safe Team Theorist friends!! Covid is still very much a world issue even though we dont get news on it anymore and even with vaccinations. My dad is fully vaxed and came down with it hard literally last week
We won’t get into how Chine, Japan, and other Eastern countries had tea for far longer than Britain right?
I love tea too............................................. when added 3 spoonfulls of sugar. No, not tea spoons....... regular spoons. And yes..... WITH top. I'm sorry tea without that amount of sugar just tastes like nothing to me.
I’m in love with tea so this episode was great for me
Ive never put the milk in first and im as British as it gets
Matt that british guy is smashing Steph
I just don’t like tea or coffee. That dirty leaf water can stay away from me
It has been 20 hours and watched it three times
Instructions unclear, added 26 cups of milk.
3-4 cups of tea a day!!!! That's nuts!!!! I didn't really believe you at first because thats way way way too much. Then i realised i'm like that with Pizza i have like 1-1.5 pizzas every 6 month period! I know I know talk about over doing it right? 😐
I think that we can look for the milk type to
British Might Are known for tea But the turkish are the Underated Champion
This time matpat knows it isnt his business
I’m British and I’ve always poured milk on top. Idk why but I just always thought that it was much better. I even forgot a lot of people do it the other way.
Milk supposed to go in food not drinks you disgusting me. Also i drink no tea (unless mom force to drink) no coffee (and never will) and no milk (never tried and never forced to)
Just learned I've been doing it right all along, lol
As an Englishman I have NEVER seen anybody put the milk in before the water for a cuppa tea (I have once for coffee and... bleurgh) This is the first time I have even heard of it happening Surely, I cannot be alone on this?
you should have used a tea cosy on your tea pot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_cosy
you guys need to make indian masala chai
I don't know anyone British that puts the milk before the tea, for me it like cereal you add milk accordingly
thank you for validating that people SHOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR TEABAG IN THEIR MUG AS THEY DRINK THEIR TEA bc it makes the tea more and more bitter as you go along drinking it
erm.....         this experiment is flawed and non factual as it is not using yokshire tea gold I as an angry bri'ish will not accept this travisty
My very British family never argue. The first I saw my mum pick a fight with someone was my with my aunt (on my dad's side so she didn't hold back) when she put the milk in first when making a cup of tea. Another thing my mum would insist on was putting jam on the scone first before the clotted cream, but if you were using butter the butter goes on first.
You put honey in it!!
Can u make  one about masala chai
guy martin explains the best way to make tea in his ITV interview
I'm British and I make my tea exactly like that. One variable you didn't test though is the type of milk, is skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk best? (I prefer semi-skimmed)
These puns are getting out of hand
at 17:23 they say milk on top is best but it shows the milk on the bottom.
I have a bit of an obsession with tea and you didn't give your loose leaf the chance it deserves. It also depend on you loose leave.   Whole leaf loose leaf is steeped for 5-7 and I use an infuser almost the size of the mug. Crushed leaves steep for less time and ground tea even less
pls come to Greece and try our tea bet you'll like and maybe will want 2nds
Hey MatPat, one more thing you didn't cover, which has been a seat of contention between my family and I. That's the temperature of the water used when brewing the tea. You want it hot, but not boiling as to not burn the tea, so would be good to know the best temperature. Otherwise, glad to see our British ways stay optimal for teamaking!
It’s  get water in the kettle and put the kettle on Get the finished boiling water and put it in a mug Put the teabag in the mug and stir it with a teaspoon Then you pour the milk in If you want you can add sugar And voilà you have tea actual drinkable tea. -A Scottish person
as a brit i've always put the milk on top lol
Sorry mat but I have to say  Steph is on some Rookie numbers for tea gotta atleast have like 10 or every drink you make   1 tea bag 2 sugar (3 tea spoons )  3Hot water 4 stir 5 milk a splash 6 remove tea bag stir and enjoy!
oh boy time to add weed to tea
Don't you dare touch my hot weed juice or else YOU WILL GET SHANKED
If matpat handled the election data we'd already know who won
As a British person, I’m not sure if it’s regional or just my family but I was taught to put in milk last.  Also you could experiment with sugar levels, what is too sweet or not sweet enough,
Unfortunately your idea of being consistent could have skewed your results, by using the glass cup as a measure it was pre warmed allowing it to hold the heat longer. It is standard practice however to do this when using a pot, also not to mention the use of a tea cosy to keep the pot warm whilst it brews!
That title the definition of coming out swinging
As a Brit, I wouldn’t say it is a British thing anymore to put milk in first. That is only really applicable if using a teapot.   Putting the milk first in a mug just lowers the temperature of the water, which means the tea can’t brew properly.
I only drink pg tips. With 1 sugar.
you guys drink tea with milk?
I am from the UK and I don't know anyone that pour the milk in first 🫖
Stephanie makes a very good point at the end of it needing sugar. There's a sixth/seventh experiment that could have been done. Which type of sugar should you use ( Regular or something like an equal) and how much to not diminish the perfect cup of tea? Part 2 perhaps?
If you don't use a tea cup that's like 1 liter, you're not consuming it correctly
Theory idea: Do you pour milk first or cereal first?
Man missed the brewing temprature 💀
Just saying but.. I put milk on last. I have a machine where you put how much hot water you need and yata yata, so technically it’s necessary to put the milk in first for me!
As a Northern Brit, this is exactly how we all make tea 😄
I don’t know any Brits who still put the milk in first
You should do one about same foods using same ingredients but tasting different in different parts of the world. I'm native Mexican but I recently went on a trip to the US. I tasted a lot of Mexican dishes made with the same ingredients but they tasted soooo different from the authentic ones back home.
3 minutes shall the time of steeping, steeping time shall be 3. One shall not steep for 4 minutes neither shall thou steep for 2 minutes, unless thou immediately proceed to 3 minutes. 5 is right out.
milk is rly not good with tea
The tea ☕️ from South Africa 🇿🇦  Is called Rooibos = Red bush tea which is a delicious and tasty tea made from the Rooibos
No milk gang
Question for Matpat. When you tested the milk first vs on top, did you pour already brewed tea on top of the milk? I have found that when I make a pot of already brewed tea in a teapot and pour it over milk, it tastes similar to adding the milk to the top in an already brewed cup of tea. However, there is a big difference when I put milk at the bottom, then add a tea bag and pour hot water over it. Because the tea is actually steeping in the milk, I find that the tea is creamier (similar to certain recipes for bubble tea or matcha). I am curious to know which method was used, especially since you used a tea bag.
wow u 3 are drinking in the same mug thats not good LOL
I've never seen someone use a microwave to heat water XD sorry, that just looked so funny to me
The perfect cup of tea  Use a normal kettle and use tea in it, pour as much as you think is the optimal and not too bitter, pour water and you're done. sugar would also make it more perfect
I would personally go with 25ml. That is actually a standard in medicine spoons and cups. Given the wild cards this video throws up, I could be wrong, but I seriously doubt one millilitre is going to make a difference. However, nobody does this and everybody goes by colour. I would call the colour of the tea in cup A medium amount of milk. AKA, Perfect. If your tea is the colour as the cup in the bottom left at 13:50, you've got it right.
3-4 is nothing compared to any member of my family lol! (we’re British) they usually go through around 5-7 a day!
Nooooooo not hte microwave
Uncle Iroh would be proud!
Y'all didn't even test microwaving the water!!! I would love to hear what differences you actually noticed
Oh this is absolute poppycock
At Buckingham Palace, they *don't* put the milk in first. I think that's about all we need to know about the right way to make tea.
As a self-described North American tea snob.... No milk IS the best milk, when it comes to tea (or even coffee). And, I must admit, I am partial to Yunnan (which is Chinese) as opposed to Assam.
oof
Just moved back home to the Uk and I feel it's my Dutea to watch this
I've heard that u can't boil the water, heat it, but it cannot boil, because it will burn the leafs
You never said what the correct temperature 🌡 for the water is!  What is it?   And also, what difference does the microwave make?  Why would the hot water be different?   What advantage is there to waiting 20 minutes to boil water on the stove?  Does the water taste different? 🤔
Brit here, My optimal tea:   Start with kettle boiled water as a base and pour in a teapot  Take an English Breakfast paper teabag (Or whatever shape you like you like) and add it to the teapot  Let it sit for about 2.5 - 3 mins  Pour into a more vertical ceramic mug, not all the way to the top  Then finally add 21- 26 mils of milk after  Sip
I never understood how it became acceptable to mix milk and tea. That's just so gross 🤮
There might be interactions between the variables of the experiment.
Ahh..... Youve finally crossed the line. I'm coming for you matpat
MATT! WATCH THE MOFERN ROGUE VIDEOS ON TEA!!! It's chinese style tea but I think you can find some really cool information in there and maybe do a part 2 of comparing Chinese styles to British? Just an idea xD
What about sugar amount?
Could you guys do green tea next I feel like it's always too bitter to drink.
Matpat made me feel vindicated on my milk in tea opinion
I'm British. My family have made it this best way for generations. Take that tea snobs!
MattPat is right, a standard cup of tea should have no milk.
You guys need 2 more variables, how much honey or sugar
No milk
Darling Tea is Indian
MatPat finding Steph drinking 3-4 cups of tea a day so much...*laughs in 7 cups British*
i have a friend that makes tea without the bags just the tea leaves and it takes a bit longer but it tastes better
This is going to be a spicy video.
I feel like this could have been a bit more thorough. I'd have liked to see after determining that 3 minutes was best for steeping to try 2 minutes 30 seconds and 3 minutes 30 seconds to see if one was better than the other. I'd also have liked to see comparisons on what vessel you boil your water in. Should you use an electric kettle? Or should you boil your water in a stovetop tea pot then transfer it to a serving teapot. Ceramic mug vs metal coated mug (keeps it hotter). I know some guides say to put a splash of boiling water in your mug, swirl it and dump it before adding the tea. In fact I've seen that more than milk on the bottom. Does this improve the taste of the tea? What if this is done in various types of mugs? Would it improve the taste in a metal coated mug but not ceramic or vice versa?
You went to the brits for tea? Not someone from Asian?
Did you take into account that the mug/cup should be stained? The more the better 😋
ok but when do you put the sugar
this is literally exactly how I make tea
I prefer to make my tea the traditional American way: throw that crap in the harbor!
nobody has tea in a teapot unless your a royal :/
I'm only at 14:33... but I hope you go back... seteep the tea for longer, THEN do the milk test again...  "too much milk" for 3 minute tea, might be perfect for 5 min tea.  ;-)
as a brit sugar in tea is blasphemous
At least he didn't say tea is soup.. he's learning guys.  This is how you make actual tea: put the leaves in the pot with the water, boil it, filter it, serve it in porcelain, drink it. No sugar. No milk.
lol british way is the right way of making tea? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 and making tea with tea bag is a very bad idea
How i make my tea: put some water in the kettle and boil it. Put the boiled water in the cup (instead of using a kettle, you could also get it straight from the coffee machine). Put the teabag in the cup and lift it up and down a few times. This prevents you from having to wait about 3 minutes. Pull the teabag out and lay it on something to prevent you from having to clean it. Put in sugar as you'd like (no sugar is fine too, but i usually put in 1 or 2 scoops). Let it cool down a bit so you don't burn ur mouth or tongue. Stir it to evenly devide the sugar over the tea. Last step: enjoy ur tea!
0:29 4? 4? That's nothing, you weak American bafoons. I go through atleast 10 a day. That's when I'm not thirsty.
You should've looked at the Chinese or Japanese tea ceremonies. The temp of your water, pouring out the first bloom, things like that make a big difference according to the people who do it.
What about the difference between sweet ice tea and hot tea? Because sweet tea is a staple in the south. Or how to make the best sweet ice tea?
As a British person who drinks more tea than anyone ever, I find that American video a disgrace to my Britishness and therefore will sue her for everything she has
I watched the first 5 seconds of the American woman making tea and said "nope" and paused the video
Oh boy, he just barely scratched the surface of what actual science tea can bring ;) 1st of all, never ever ever tea bags, it's just literally tea dust. Please, only loose leaf and good quality please, not the stale things you buy in regular grocery stores. Also, never ever any milk or sugar in it. Also, yes you can brew in a tea pot, but gaiwans are soo much better as an experience... And this is just a start....
In the Middle East we drink coffe and tea in in the middle of summer🗿
try asian and south asian teas
I like sweetened condensed milk in my tea.
As someone from the UK… We actually scoff at people who put milk in first. That’s a big no, no. So there’s a whole section here where you say we have been doing wrong. We haven’t put milk in first since like world war 1. 😂 we have had it perfect for many, many years!.. (Slightly disappointed there is a Brit there who didn’t mention this.) Also, came back to say, you didn’t test how much sugar you should have 😂.
You guys pour milk in it?  Are you both insane ?
Tom, it was wonderful to meet you. Thank you for gracing us with your excellent British presence for this finest of episodes. It was wonderful to see that the creativity that weekly entertains us over on Game Theory has such a pleasing laugh and sweet presence. *sips scientifically brewed tea in your honour*
As I tea lover I freaking love this video
Girl: let’s put the cup in the microwave Me (personally offended for some reason): NO! YOU ALREADY MUCKED IT UP!! 😨😭 Girl: adds milk.  Me: 😵
*Britain has joined the chat*
Pls do for coffee
Smoke it
There is actually an essay called' a nice cup of tea' by george orwell You can read it if you want
lol, uk expert on tea? LOL what a Joke!
gtfo milk in tea is like milk in coke
I'm not doing the whole milk thing, but I'll add that much sugar instead. Should be fine ye?
In Poland we actually threat tea with milk as a completely separate drink from just normal tea: Tea without any milk is what we call tea or more precisely "herbata", tea with 5 to 15ml of milk is what we call "zabielanka", and tea with more milk than that is something that we call "bawarka"
As an American that lives in the UK, as well, I think my husband, in-laws, and coworkers would sacrifice me Yorkshire pudding gods if I pulled what those peeps did:  How I make tea: 1)  Tea bag in empty cup 2)  Boiling water (either from a kettle or from an instant boiling water tap) about 3/4 full 3)  Let steep for about 2 minutes 4)  REMOVE TEA BAG 5)  Two teaspoons stirred in for about 10 seconds 6)  Milk poured in to about half an inch from the top 7)  Milk stirred in for about 5 seconds 8)  Attempt not to burn mouth
19:32 glass was most likely the hottest due to being used to pour hot water into the other two, which means that 1) the other two had slightly pre-cooled water, and 2) the glass cup was thoroughly pre-warmed. You should have used a different 4th cup to draw and pour the water.
MOM HE NOTICED US!!! HE KNOWS SOUTH AFRICA EXISTS!!!!
In iran we drink tea every hour
brit tea to Asian tea, is like instant ramen to gourmet ramen.
Team NO MILK
But that's none of my business.
if it helps, as a British person I've NEVER seen someone here pour the milk first
2:03  Tom's pun here, so subtle I'm cackling
Indian tea is the best
They got it completely the wrong way around. Putting the milk in first is not the traditional way, putting the tea in first is. It was tradition to demonstrate the high quality of your porcelain by stressing it with near boiling water before adding the milk. Putting the milk into the cup first was the practical way of doing it, for those that didn't have the finest porcelain (or weren't concerned with showing off their tea set). They alluded to that in the video, even. Taste testing aside, there are also scientific studies that show that putting milk in first makes the objectively better cup of tea, and they explain why it works.  If you prefer the taste when milk is added to tea, by all means do make it that way, just know that the scientific evidence does not support your subjective experience.
Upon ingesting TikTok tea, Tom and the entirety of the UK recoiled in agony.
I leave the tea bag in for 15 minutes but I didn't know that people put milk in their tea
I mean Matt, there’s no need to push the Brits to colonize everyone again.
So noone in team theorist adds sugar!?!?!? I add 2 teaspoons
there's an uncle iroh joke here somewhere but i cant find it
He isn't doing brewing temperature, which has a proven effect on the quality of the finished tea. Annoying. Will finish video anyway lol
So I'm at 6 minutes in and I do not think I will be mad at you because I am _so_ confident that the way we make tea in the UK is correct that I am certain you will get the same results. Science or not.
you guys didnt try outy of a french press, word on the street is thats the best
Gotta agree with Matt on this one, putting milk in tea is barbaric.
Not to be THAT british guy, but it is a well known fact that in the UK, if you put milk in before the hot water you are immediately sent to prison for high treason.
matpat is right  we iranians love tea and I even dare to say more than british and I love my tea with no milk
so let me get this straight, "British tea" comes from India?
For those who don't use metric - that would put the correct milk amount at around 1.5 tablespoons
13:39 Agree with Matpat 🤣If there's milk in tea, that's not just tea, it's *milk tea*
All tea is gross, still loved the video Matt!
18:55 why does it do that anybody
I'm not even from UK and I got triggerd
Who puts milk in tea? It's gross
Sorry americans but your tea is wrong
Hiya.
no sugar?
A part two involving traditional Asian methods would be nice.
got the same kettle as me
As a British person.. who was still putting milk first?
So is it milk or cream. My great great grand mother was english and she always said cream. So is there a different. 🤷‍♀️
Hey Matt,  Pretentious tea snob here.  Overall a fun episode and I liked watching the tea journey. however, there are two things that stood out I need to mention: 1) I saw a methodological flaw in the steeping part. your focus was on shape but not size of the steeping container even though your explanation talked about room to bloom being a factor. extra large flat teabags can provide just as much room as the pyramid for similar effects as they will bulge in the center as the tea steeps. as for the tea bauble, most of us tea snobs don't use them because they don't give enough room for the good leaves, and instead will use open basket strainers or let it steep in an open cup and strain through a pour though strainer.   2) I'm also disappointed that you didn't look into the chemistry behind the milk in first or tea in first question, because that is a fascinating subject. Adding the milk later can denature some of the proteins, leading to some purists to feel the overall mixing is compromised. The reason the tea you had was less bitter when adding the milk second was that when the milk is added second, it interacts with the tannins more, preventing them from fully expressing themselves reducing the bitterness. In teas with an unbalance bitterness profile, that can help to bring the bitterness back into balance. but if the tea already has a nice balanced bitterness profile, you can lose out (which is why there are some varieties of tea I just don't put milk in at all)  Other than those two issue, loved the episode and I can't see what you do next
With all your scientific tests, you all just took  "don't microwave your water" as fact without testing it.  Hate to break to all the Brits out there, and Steph, but microwaving your water is no different than any other method of heating it up.  The only real difference is power consumption in the heating process, and you might burn your hand on the mug if you use a microwave.   Microwaving water has zero effect on flavor and nutritional value of water.
And here I thought boiling water putting it in a cup putting a random peppermint tea thingy in the cup adding a concerning amount of sugar and honey into it was the right way to make tea.
Kratom?
This video reminded me a lot of goldilocks and the three bears XD
Do a food theory on the 5 second rule!
Looks like the theorist family ran out of introductory jokes.
Everytime I get new information about Stephanie I feel like we should be best friend (I say as I sip on my first cup of tea for day. While writingmy to do list where the first entry is BREW MORE TEA). It's weird because I normally hate other Stephanie's because the name is so common and I want to be unique. Some of that I'm going blame on your love for each other. When you talk about her she is the most awesome person in the world and vice-versa. Thanks for sharing your love the world needs more love in the universe.
I agree with Matt, best milk is no milk.
I drink 3 to 4 liters of tea almost every day in the year
You can't even buy tea in America their bags tate disgusting get some Yorkshire tea you philistines
Dude you gotta try the INDIAN TEA. HOW DOES THE BRITS GET SAY ON TEA! THEY DON'T ENEN GROW IT!
We finally got to see the real reason why we dumped the tea into Boston harbor
It'd be neat to see a sequel video to this where you test southern-style sweet tea. Which is usually made a gallon at a time. I make mine using a 12-cup coffee pot. I put about 4 flat tea bags into the top part where you'd usually put in the filter and coffee grounds and then fill the water compartment to the maximum of 12-cups, then turn the pot on. When that's done I take a gallon jug and pour the brewed tea into that and pour in 2 cups of sugar and stir that until all the sugar is dissolved. After that, I fill the rest of the jug with cold water give that a final stir and there you go. I've also heard of sun tea where you heat up the water with direct sunlight on a hot summer's day.
I can’t imagine putting milk into my tea. I brew mine loose leaf in a French press then pour in just a pinch of sugar.
You should have gotten someone Asian. Someone truly built on tea.          Joke
Glad to know I’ve been drinking my tea correct all these years (American). I was taught by a British friend of my moms when I was young but she never specified the milk on bottom or on top, so I always just put it on top.
Try Asian masala milk tea which are made in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and other south Asian countries.
I am British and have always seen the milk put in after, never before.
I am very surprised you didn't test water at different temperatures. Who says boiling hot water is the best temperature for tea? 🤔
Indians make their differently
I am Taiwanese, if there is milk in  a cup of tea, we think it is a cup of milk tea not really a cup of tea, that pretty shocked me when you adding milk in tea and called it just tea.
Next, please help us crazy winter ice-eaters, how do we optimize our ice eating, like do we buy bags of ice or make it homemade, what type of cup is best to eat the ice HOW DO I OPTIMIZE MY ICE DURING THE WINTER I made this comment as I eat ice
6:29 Those mother instincts kicking in lol
How did they get Tom Holland to join them for a video?
6:29 Stephs mom instincts kicked in 🤣
im confused that people think the milk goes in first, brittish here that behaviour is sinful
ITS TURNCOAT
I make my tea without milk
Food TEAory ..
You using the glass to pour others preheated your glass opposed to others, affecting the results of all 3.   Because your glass had already been introduced to 2 rounds of hot water, it couldn’t absorb as much heat from the 3rd cup.  I only know this because if I fill my thermostat with hot water before coffee, it last SIGNIFICANTLY longer.
Timing for milk in tea is a constant debate. Personal preference I am milk last AFTER the tea bag is removed. Doc Brown puts it best  https://youtu.be/Ei46KnXB3BA
i dont add milk to my tea
Please please stop showing us taste tests where everyone got to know how the object of the test was prepared.
Brit here I’ve never met someone who puts the milk in first
Beacuse tea is good
Not me sitting here already knowing how everything you guys discovered and amused that Mat Pat forgot one variable that’s common knowledge to most tea drinkers. Brewing temperature.
TIKTOKTEA
6:28 Steph knew it was coming. Mom instinct
confused, did you make the tea bags yourself to test? The paper bags contain a much worse grade of tea, even if they are from the same brand
You failed the test the most important thing, does it make any difference if you boil or microwave your water to heat it? Could you achieve the same results by pouring microwaved water into another container after heating?  I noticed that sometimes my tea bag gets little bubbles in it and other times it doesn't, depending on how the water was heated.
As a Brit, if I'm making tea with a tea bag straight into the cup, I pour milk last and if it's loose leaf from a teapot, milk first
i think the brits people will get pissed off by this but who cares.   so as an Indonesian in here we just boil the water put the teabag then the sugar THERE IS NO MILK IN TEA HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE, I actually just know people put milk in tea I will prob never try that accept when I go to englend and buy some tea and then maybe I will get taste culture shock
tea is gross lol
Bail half cup water boil it than add one spoon of tea  and one spoon of sugar than add half cup of milk let it  boil again and than drink it .dont use the tea bag
13:38 As a Chinese tea drinker, I agree with Mat. No milk is the way to go
Finally, the hard-hitting research the free world needed!
So I'm American and therefore wrong but I like my tea cold and sweet.
Milk in first is only applicable with teapot brewing, not mug brewing. Milk in first with a mug method just heat shocks the milk hence the sour flavour.
I like Tom want to see him more
Try nepali tea
I thought the story of milk in first vs. tea in first was the story of a vast and deep controversy in England with two large warring camps each convinced the other was wrong, not that there was actually a consensus. I think it's one of those things where each side is convinced there is a consensus until by chance they notice a member of the other tribe.
I usually whisk my tea after putting milk in   Especially with chai
Would have been nice to know if the temperature of the milk makes a difference or not since I never add milk to my tea
What about the sugar ?! What times the sugar go in ?!
... this actually helped, I have no idea how to brew tea xD. Maybe now I can do it in a way that doesn't taste like dishwater.
Anyone here from 50 tea recipes of the duchess
What about the sugar
So, the answer is boil water, throw into gallon sized jug, add 5-12 bags, add about 1-1.5 cups of sugar MINIMUM, stir, add ice, put in fridge for an hour ish, and BOOM.. Southern ice tea
Great--now do one on Southern Sweet Tea. It varies WIDELY from restaurant to restaurant, and often tastes old.
Fun fact! Welsh cakes go well with tea! (I think, I don't think I've tried it before)
I just wanna be clear that we Brits do NOT put the milk in first anymore, if someone does that then they’re just a wrongun
What? not only S add milk but SUGAR? -.-
You should try putting ginger in tea, it tastes good 😊
18:30 what about earthen
Make a video with mate
Skip!
Mama mia come to India we drink tea every  morning evening you name it . Not 20‚30% more than India’s half population. matter a fact India has a population over 3 billion
Definitely need more vids with Tom!
Please do the same for coffee!
As a Brit, milk has always come second
so you mean to tell me that the FILM ON TOP MEANS THAT IT WAS OVERBREWED??? HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS???
I never put milk or sugar in my tea anymore. It's just better and more natural that way. I put honey in if I'm ill, cause it helps.
If I recall correctly, Douglas Adams was very adamant about putting the milk on top, claiming that the tradition of putting the milk in first "scolded" the milk and ruined the flavour. He also at one point explained how to make the perfect cup of tea.  This was in the book Salmon of Doubt, and it's been years since I read it. So I can't elaborate more than that I'm afraid.
Meanwhile indians 1/4 or 1/47 water to all milk seriously i like milk tea, otherwise it tastes like water
People like this comment   if you like/love milo 😃
You say chai sucks? unsubbed
so many puns and you forgot       bone apple tea
Almost all the bags I buy have the ideal temperature and steep time on them to get the right flavour. Chamomile for example says 100C 5-10mins, while green tea lemon says 85C 2-3mins. My mum tends to make her own lemon ginger tea, putting lemon and ginger in boiling water. I do agree with MatPat tho, no milk in tea
Best milk is no milk!
British People had a truck load to say after seeing the thumbnail
In the famous words on Iroh (Avatar last Airbender) This is hot leaf juice
As a Brit i dont know what to think about this but the video was amazing keep making amazing videos Mat and Steph
You could have added witch milk is the best with tea that should be intresting
Microwaving water is the most efficient, quickest & "cleanest" way to heat it, yes even more efficient & quicker than a resistance heater based kettle; and as far as cleanest I mean that there is less chance of any off flavors being imparted to the water, such as from a poorly cleaned kettle for example. I definitely over-steep my tea, I drop the bag in and start drinking it 5minutes in, and don't remove the teabag. I typically use PG Tips teabags with honey as a sweetener, but no milk. I do also drink "market spice" tea, which is a loose tea made with cinnamon & orange peel as well as other spices, no sweetener or milk. I first had it at Pike Place Market in Seattle. Steph: "wow, wow wow wow" - was making tea super easy, barely an inconvenience?
i dont think i would trust the british on what' culinarily desirable
finally someone pronuonces india's state correctly
I need @thespiffingbrit to respond to this video. Also, no yorkshire tea gold.
Ok, but that's exactly how I make my tea
im surprised the temperature of the water wasnt a factor
Does Iced Tea Count Still???
Bro this video hurts me because I'm turkish and we don't put milk in out tea
no one's gonna see this, but ooF I have some thoughts:  1: obviously after pouring tea out of a teapot into a cold mug, it's colder. It had twice the amount of material to heat up. 2: 5 ml of milk in a cup, as in a teacup, which is more like 150-200ml instead of 250ml. So  more milk should've been added for the 5 ml one 3: beginning temperature makes a giant difference too 4: ofc the glass cup in the last test was hottest, since it was preheated when pouring the other cups   Other than that, it was nice to see tho
British tea > Turkish tea  it just tastes better
In egypt we don't use milk to make tea, If we do it's called tea with milk
Ok what comes after tea coffee
Wait you put milk in tea?
Who thinks that MatPat brewed many teas for those three cups each for every experiment? Except when limit ups and limit downs
Remember unconscious people don't want tea
To get the best tea, you just go to Ba Sing Se and go to the Jade Dragon
In this episode I get confirmation my tea drinking method is the best way.
The way y'all sharing tea mugs would be unspeakable 2 year ago.
Let's be honest here, even as an American,  that video hurts to watch cause no one makes tea like that but her.  My poor southern heart weeps for her and her family.
It is simple, in Iraq we just place cold water and tea leafs into a pot, place it on hot sand or coal, wait for it to boil, boom! you got perfect tea.
Every milk experiment is immediately invalid by virtue of having milk in a plastic bottle. There is nothing more disgusting than milk that came from a plastic bottle, with the possible exception of boiled milk that spoils less quickly than pasteurized milk. Boiled milk from a plastic bottle obviously wins the prize for being the most vile thing to have ever been invented by humanity.
This is the first episode where I've noticed Matpat's age catching up to him...
To be fair, most Brits these days put milk in afterwards anyways. The milk in first thing was a long time ago.
as an australian i do boiling water from a kettel tea than milk
Nice episode!! In my family, if you put the milk in first, it’s a big no-no! Always milk in last 👌 you basically made tea the way we do as a family! 👏🏻 🇬🇧
I'd love if you did Chinese tea!
I agree - no milk in tea 😊
I would've loved to see a round testing different sizes of tea leaves as well!
bro all the puns
To be fair, most people I know put the milk in after the steeping rather than milk first
There is an other factors different kinds of milk on the temperature milk
Yeah I know you don't have to rub it in my face matrick patrick
My s/o tried to tell me that microwaved tea and proper tea taste the exact same, so he made me two cups, one of each methods. They did not taste the same😭
Lol
matpat ist totally right, milk DOESN'T BELONG into tea
3-4 cups of tea isn't much realy
I just steam the milk and put the tea leaves in that
As a Brit who loves tea, I don't know anyone who puts milk in first. Everyone I have ever met puts milk in last so I dunno where you are getting the info that we put it in first but whoever told you that is patently wrong.
DAD in the back
Microwaving the water is the most efficient, especially in the US. Telling that you didn’t test that and just clung to your snobbish assumptions. Hot water is hot water.
So as a brit and I assume other brits will agree, the findings are basically what a lot of brits do over hear. The questions of 'yorkshire, tetley or PG tips', milk first or second as also cultural signifiers about you. Most people I know go for milk second. But I am down south. I wonder if up north is different?
I use a 1 litre jug for my tea. I usually have 1-2 a day.
The ONLY reason people started putting milk in first because rich people started being able to get bone china, and to temper the teacup, to prevent the bone china cracking... aaaaaand you basically just said it (& I mean basic in the broadest sense).  These posh cups of tea were made before the invention of teabags and were from teapots only, so the tea had already brewed.  I learned this a few years ago on a history documentary, but I can't remember the name of the 'woman of nobility' who made this method 'fashionable'.  Anyone who puts in the milk first these days must be certified a psychopath.
Milk in tea eh.. I never kneeeeewww
Oh yes Tea leaves and nuts sometimes soaked in water to make vintage Old Southern Tea
being british myself, i surprisingly put my sugar and teabags first, boil the water and pour either a mix of half the cup or just near the lip of the cup, then whatever milk i have only reason for the halfway water is if i want a nice creamy cup of tea, mostly because I love milk a lot, plus cups for me don't matter i've had rounded off bottom cups, and just straight cylindrical cups, neither matter to me, also with the tea bag in my cup I do tend to leave them purely for 2 mins only and yes i do squeeze them, but that's a preference of mine for basically drinking tea since i was like 10 which was 10 years ago
This video would’ve been uncle iro aproved
You didn't do a fair test about heating the water in the microwave despite Steph throwing shade at it... >_>
Turks never Use tea bags we just pour it in the cup
let me tell you guys how we make tea in bangladesh  step 1:pour tap water into pot step 2:put pot on stove step 3:turn on stove step 4:wait for water to boil (cuz our tap water ain't purified ) step 5:put prefered amount of grinded tea leaves in pot step 6:get cup and put tea net on top step 7:pour the leaf water into the cup step 8:put powdered milk and sugar (cuz i am pretty sure it does not change the taste ) step 9:stir well and done now you have bangladeshi tea (sorry if there are some spelling mistakes)
I've been told milk kills the benefits of tea. So your doing good Matt.
I drink 3-4 teas a day too lol
Jokes on you, I don't use teabags. As a full blown Asian, I brew it with leaves and leaves only.
As a British person, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone put the milk in first tbh
Why am I watching this lol
I'm British. Milk on top is the best way. Also, Yorkshire Tea is best Tea #facts.   Milk on top IS traditional, as you say, for the rich and those that could afford the good China back in the day. Since cups have become cheap enough for all, I believe we largely pour milk on top. I've never MET anyone here that does otherwise, so yeah, this is the British way, because we know how to make Tea :D ;)   I also lived in California for a year, there is no good tea in America :P
As a Brit I’ve never liked having the milk in first, always after, transitionally just a splash too
12:47 shouldn't it be 60ml not 48ml?  I think you got confused with the fraction to percentage.
Warm leaf water!?! Uncle iroh would like to have a word
Bruh us Indians start drinking tea at the age of 3 including me. And they get addicted to it when they're 13. Including me.
meanwhile me who always drinks tea but never added any milk: 😐
As someone who has microwaved water for tea, I burnt my hand like Matpat as well.
As a turk we drink tea everyday
Get a Moroccan in the next episode
Here in the Highlands if we put milk in the bottom instead of on top after its brewed it would be blasphemy. Scotland is the UK so I don't know where your "traditions" from the UK are coming from, here we drink a LOT of tea and this video proved that there's a reason we do things the way we do here in the Highlands.
Mat is right, milk in tea is just disgusting
why did you not try with sugar? I hate the idea of milk in my tea (never tried it tho) but always put sugar in it to sweeten the taste (seems like the same reason y’all put milk in it?)
Can y’all do a video on the coffee that was brewed in breaking bad? Is that kind of process possible with the apparatus in the show, if not what else would be needed, and is the coffee that much better as Walter said?
Such a high koalatea video 🐨🍵
6:17 I notice that type of milk wasn't listed (perhaps it will be mentioned later in the episode). I feel like another factor is whole vs skim milk
Should have a follow up episode dealing with Earl Grey and dealing with sugar vs honey as sweeteners, and if lemon is better vs another citrus fruit.
Pretty sure most brits put their milk in on top. I'm English and don't know anyone that puts it in first. I don't like tea, but I make it for my husband and milk goes in last
he is gonna lose his british passport
I'm Team MatPat on this one, No Milk!
I still think that the waterproof teabag is the best
Me, no milk, and sqeeze, i feel validated. I love bitter.
Matt, I honestly need your help here.  What did you do to marry an awesome woman who is totally out of your league?
I reckon you could have also brewed the tea with different water temperatures to change your flavor.
Hey Mat, avocado trees don’t grow true to seed. If that plant ever fruits, those avocados will taste nasty.
I still don't get how people can drink tea with milk,it just sounds so bad.I just make it by first adding water to a kettle then boiling it and then pouring it into a mug and adding the tea bag.
Best tea is indian Chai 🤭
As a British person I must point out that I was brought up on tea and I've never came across someone who advocates the milk going in before the tea
I agree with the milk MatPat
this is my first time knowing that people actually use Water when making tea in India we pour a cup of milk into a vessel add the tea powder (yes it is sold as a powder) wait till it boils and just drink it
13:05  isn’t a cup is usually smaller than a mug
Good tea innit MatPat?
The tea puns are keeping me alive
Wait... I just learned in some places they put milk in tea... (They don't know it is normal to drink 4 cups of tea a day in Turkey)
I have never put milk in my tea but I actually like it bitter. Also I haven’t seen the pyramid bags. I will need to find these.
"We needed someone British" Lord and Lady Mingeworthy
Matpat have you ever seen Doc Brown's "Proper Tea" rap? it was on a Russel Howard show and can be found on youtube. I'm not really a big tea drinker but most of us regular brits never put milk in first for tea. (but sometimes do for coffee because you can burn coffee, even instant coffees)
*Sipping lipton tea in Malaysia*
You drink tea with milk?
Mat pat. Do your research before assuming that the Brits are the tea enthusiets, BECAUSE YOU ARE WRONG!!! The real tea lovers are from Turkey, and this isn't bias, look it up! And as a fellow Turk, I can say that I drink tea more then I drink water (this isn't a joke by the way). Everyone thinks of Britan when they her tea, but no one cares about Turkey! But I do because I am from Turkey, you can tell because of the number of typos in this very comment!
Team no milk
I love your theories  and episodes,   I am surprised you didn't try Authentic Indian Chai ( Tea )   You guys need to try that
The best tea is the one with no milk in it....  *Letting the Americans and the Brits to boil and revolt on internet with my statement.*
Ofcs the milk goes in second thats how u do it in Britain this is not news
As an Frisian German, we leave our leaves in the can as long as we are drinking it. 20-30 minutes plus. We like it strong.  And we pouring tea first and after than a splash of cream. (Wulkje)
Team Tae wowow
Wait, i am british, and everyone i know puts milk ON TOP. I literally dont know anyone who does milk on top even the Doc Brown rap proper tea confirms milk doesnt go first. WHO DOES MILK FIRST?!?!
How dare you.
Honestly, not a fan of milk in my tea personally. I wasn't even aware that was a thing til later in my life strangely enough
Came for channel loyaltea, stayed for the puns ❤😂
I'm British and I have always put milk in after I've steeped the tea
As someone who has tended to drink tea 2-3 times a day living in humidly hot Central Ameica, now that I'm in cold Europe, my consumption is about to sky rocket through winter. :p So, thank you for this video.
Milk in tea is like pineapple on pizza. Just wrong. I'm with you Mat. XD
Yea but you didn't do the sip test the taste changes from the way you sip it
Asians be like: we dont measure anything
Matt : "Best milk in tea is no milk in tea" _"I see you're a man of culture aswell..."_ I 100% agree tho, milk in tea is for Cold Boba during college studies only [13:36]
Your wife's warm leaf water can't compare to my wife's hot leaf juice!
*says the tea is Indian*  "anyway so this British tea"
Matpat your Christmas vids were so good last year. I want you to make the most absurd video ever.
I live in Romania, if you're adding milk in your tea and serve it to someone, you're getting beat up
WHAT ABOUT THE SUGAR PEOPLE!
I also don't like milk in tea. It just seems odd to me
Steph drinks less tea than my mom. She drinks 6  - 7 of chai a day
The British guy sounds like James Hoffman but talking about tea. Edit: Tea is nothing compared to coffee.
I can't believe Matpat dedicated an entire Food Theory Episode to the definitive BEST and ONLY way to make tea and he doesn't even think to ask Spiff for a small cameo or voiceover. Truly a blasphemy, The Head of Y-Tea will hear of this treason, Matthew.
Wait you put milk in tea?
Tea bags tend to use leftover dust from processing tea leaves swept straight from the floor
The way we make tea in romania: add water, get teabag or plants put it in and just make it hot take the plants or teabag out and then your done, honestly i like the tea a lot.
Do a sequel for the perfect cup of coffee
You gonna make indians mad too because we start day with tea
It has to be evaporated milk tho 😤
in the end you made tea, the some I do every day. 🤣😂😅😆PS. I am English 🤣😂 got a good laugh watching you got your mind blown.
there is also a difference in quality of tea leaves in the bag compared to loose leaf
I’m a bit of a tea sinner myself, tea bag in before the water so I don’t have to wait for it to steep as long. (No milk also)
Current personal brew - 2:1 OP tea to Rooibos. Daytime tea 10g of OP to 5g of Rooibos in 900ml of water. Steeped for 5-10 minutes held above 85c and below 95c. Just enough milk and sugar to cut the tannins and be able to tell it's sweetened. Exact amount depends on what milk is available, whether you use table sugar or honey, and your personal tannin sensitivity.  Afternoon or nighttime tea 2 grams of OP to 1 gram R per cup steeped for 3-4 minutes, same temp, significantly less milk/sugar needed per ml of tea to cut tannins and be able to tell it's sweetened.
making my very sweet, very milky, very strong sacrilegious tea: hm, interesting.
Can you do an episode similar to this one but with noodles? I'd love to see the results and wether microwaving and just leaving it out make that drastic of a difference (all I know is that it just makes it less soft if you microwave it)
W matpat with the milk opinion
Im literally Watching this While I'm waiting for my tea to steep I'm watching a video about tea Well I'm about to drink tea
What about type of milk? Does it change between whole 2% and 1%?
What about different kinds of milk .... We have now, We have many different types of milk that are not cow's milk or animal milk at all. Maybe there is better milk .... evil laugh, evil laugh, evil laugh.....
I've read about the chemical difference in milk-in-tea and tea-in-milk a while back (like a lot more than 10 years ago), so I am very surprised that they expected the same taste.  In any case I have a bone to pick with the last experiment: You cannot stand for scientific exellence and pour the water like that! Unless you have preheated the cups by pouring boiling water into them and then out, every cup (and the water in it) has a different starting temperature because of the way you poured it. Would this detail make a difference - I don't believe so. But you know.. if you are going to be very detail-oriented, be very detail-oriented.
I always reuse my tea and coffee cops bc I just rinse them. I use them for those specific beverages anyway.
The tittle personally triggered me
Food Theory; the first YouTube channel to commit a British hate crime. But that’s just a theory
As a brit, the tradition has died out, the perfect cup for me would be tea bag in, hot water, add sugar, take the bag out and put about 10-15ml of milk in, and it's the same for everyone I know
Try indian style tea
Instructions unclear, milk turned sour.
Wait wtf milk in tea that's fucking gross
I saw the title and immediately just went. “Be very careful mat, tea is not an Americans best subject”
And there we are here, Baltics plus everything till Siberia - we steep our tea untill there is a "membrane" on the top. And adding milk is almost an insult. The more bitterness you taste - the better.
The Indian style: hi
tea in a microwave sucks
Seth McFarlane has a British love child?
u cant make real tea in a micro wave
All the parameters they say is the "best" isn't exactly true, but a good starting point, you should play around and experiment with all of them because there's a lot of variables they didn't account for, like wall thickness of the cup lowers the temp the tea actually experiences by a lesser or grater amount, how much tea to use per 100ml depends on the individual tea, where you live can impact the water hardness and there are things you can do to account for it. whether you pour directly on the bag or around it (called rim brewing) so you don't shock the tea with high temps that are slightly too high.  The thing with putting the milk in first, it was also done because it makes a better brew IF the milk is unpasteurised. they found that putting the milk in after made the protein molecules clump together, but found no difference with pasteurised milk. we don't have that issue now so after is the preferred method.
13:16 le indians 50% water and 50% milk in tea
Milk in first makes the tea look milky to me. I’ve always assumed this is because the milk “glugs” (very scientific) the teabag and doesn’t allow the tea to infuse properly.
Wait, you forgot one variable! Sugar. If say that's more important than amount of milk, because that's very much up to personal taste. Like, should you put the sugar in with the tea bag or with the milk (before or after?)  Also, do hot chocolate next. I can think of at least three ways to make that.
British viewers when Matt says “3-4 cups of tea a day” - 👀👀👀👀
Here’s the Dutch way to do it:  1. Boil water in a kettle. 2. Pour it into a cup 3. Add a tea bag until the water is as dark as you desire 4. Take out tea bag (5. Add sugar if you so desire)
1/4, 1/47 those are the same numbers, basically.  Just extra on the end of one of them!
What about the milk types
Thank you MatPat that is correct we as Tea despise milk being added.
As a Brit, i LOVE TEA, BISCUIT'S AND FOOD THEORY!
Maybe its an area thing but everybody i know who actually drinks tea  (im english) puts a splash of milk in last
Good tea does not need milk.
Every company taking notes 📝 free R&D
I just wanna know how I can get my tea not to taste like the bag 😩 I'm scared of the metal case thing I don't wanna taste the metal too! does anyone else have this problem am I leaving it in there too long what I'm a doing wrong 🤣🤣😭
Nice jokes MatTEA
I would love to know what Steph thinks about Rooibos tea, a type of tea from here in South Africa
But that's just one tea bag you have to do this as a series internationally
Should have also tried a turkish tea cup.
Do you swear like out of videos?
No milk in your tea unless you also are adding boba.  Also I love bitter tea.
The CGI on mat just keeps getting better and better
you should make a youtube channel called app theory and talk about the interesting topics like things that happened in the past of these apps.
I'm curious to see what would happen if you use a different kind of milk (Almond milk, Cashew Milk, etc). There would definitely be difference in taste and it would show if there is an alternative for the lactose intolerant folk (me 😭). But as an avid tea drinker, I really enjoyed this episode!!
I don't use milk in tea, I do add honey instead because I find that to make the tea taste better, plus it helps me heal my throat if I'm losing my voice.
Epsiode idea: What is the best time to cook a pizza? You could compare different times cooking homemade and frozen pizzas to find the best time to cook them both.
As a british person, I don't know a singel person who puts milk in first
I watched this even tho i don't like tea or coffee i only drink hot coco in the morning or any time of the day tbh but i enjoyed the video because i find the channel entertaining
For the milk on top debate. Could the tradional milk first have to do with refrigeration back when the tradition was born?
Water quality is the biggest difference between British and American tea. Most tea companies will make a hard water variety for use in "hard water zones" Like the US.
What about kind of milk? Almond? Oat? Skim?
I don't add water just add milk
"Warm leaf water!?" Uncle Iroh would be disappointed to hear that
As a Bri-ish person I cringed so hard watching this. Help
I'm British and we ALWAYS put the milk in after. We'll fight anyone who puts the milk in first.
who put milk first ? tea does not brew normally if milk get first, why this qustion exist in fist place ?
Being a dunkin assistant manager we use the pyramid tea bags and we put the ingredients in 1st then the tea bag and then pour in the 200 degree water. We try to do it first so that it can seep longer while you wait for for the rest of your order.
Wait who on earth puts the milk in first?  I don't know nayone who does that
why u insulting my tea TnT
13:38 based.
Don't put tea in bags
3-4 cups? Those are ROOKIE numbers.
As of the 6:15 mark I am noting that water temperature was not one of your variables
What about the difference between whole milk, 2%, 1%, skim, half & half?
I don't know about y'all, but I love my tea with no milk or sugar~ just some hot water and some tea leaves
I learned today I was making my tea wrong
Description is funny [short url link]
Next addition to the merch: the scientific tea set, with the measure glass for the milk and the Theorists logo tea mug and teapot... I'd buy it 🤣
As a brit, i and everyone i know would be disgusted if someone put milk in the mig first so i don’t understand what the rant about us doing that is for.
Can you make a food fury how to prepare crab aq
Here in Iran, we drink tea a lot, and without milk in it :)) Wanted to write so matpat is happy
this probably is my favorite episode of food theory to date!!
Duh, steph has found the key to heaven, oh btw don't u think 3-4 cups a day is alot i myself drink at least 12-15 cups of tea a day 👁️👄👁️😂
I'm more of a coffee or coco person so I don't really drink tea but if I do I have macha packets and yes from a microwave. But that's only if I don't have coffee or coco.  XD I guess I get a pass since I don't normally drink tea???
Indian version better
tea: exist  jchelle36: I'm about to end this tea's whole career
I am not an degenerate drinking tea I drink hot water with tea flavor
Youtube rewind 2022 please have matpat's version of "that's hot"
I'm with you Matpat, no milk for my tea thank you.
No tea is as good as atai u use a brrad u put water in it with some leaves u close it u add up to 2 tobat of sugar u poor it for a place way higher than the cup to have kchkocha and thats what I call tea   Edit: if you dare add milk to atai, I will find where u live
So that's what Matt means when he says on GT NotLive that next video with Tom will be something non-FNAFy...  *5head TEAse am I right?*
“f*** you matpat”                                 -british ppl
Avocados are poisonous to cats.. like every part of an avocado.  So you might not wanna allow your cat to drink the water from the one you're growing..
I know it would have taken a little more work but the scientist in me would have rathered that you did five tests in a couple of these experiments. This would give more of a definitive answer for the steep time and the milk amount. For example, 1,2,3,4,5 mins for steeping and 5, 15, 26, 37, 47 mL of milk.
I only put water in a pot put like 20 bags in and whenever I put it in a thing to pour stuff I put alot of sugar in mine.
Fun fact: In India tea is as popular as tea in UK. We drink 2 mandatory tea and whenever we feel like. When someone is starting to cook people ask "do you know how to make tea". It is seen like the first thing to learn in culinary.
I wish they did a blind taste test between microwaved water vs kettle boiled water. Microwave the water in a glass measuring cup then pour it into a mug. Scientifically, there should be no difference between the 2, and I'm sick of these snobs lifting their nose at microwaved water without giving any reason why (other than not wanting to heat the cup beyond handleable)
A little disappointed they didn't go the extra mile in commenting how the British way of making tea, and the Chinese way of making tea result in different flavors as well.
What about the spoon's material? Could that impact the taste of the tea?
weed?
we don’t generally put the milk in first in britain, though it’s definitely possible that we used to! it might have largely died out with better quality items as partially mentioned, i wonder if some of our great grandparents are still doing it! p sure we do have some remnants of needs based things based in history, like beans on toast from the war and so on. v interesting historical fact!
Followup: new evidence shows tea is best served in the harbor, and now we do the same tests with coffee.
Why do you pronounce it "dadda"? Its "dayta". And you've said it the right way before.  At first I thought you were messing with me but now I'm concerned.
What about the temperature of the tea?
im here for all of mat's passive agressive british jokes
I can't say that I've ever met anyone in the UK that has even considered putting the milk in first except for a joke
who hate tea ? i don't
i like milk in tea but i dont like brit
Does it matter wheather the coffee or creamer goes first?
Me a Brit: *puts milk in last when making my mum a tea* 😂
You grabbed a brit for the tea  Im laughing so hard right now
The thing with the milk is widely known and consistent with the British way. If you are brewing the tea in a mug then you put the tea in first as otherwise your scorching the milk when you add the boiling water but also your water has been cooled slightly by the milk meaning its not hot enough to fully extract the tea flavours. However if your brewing the tea in a pot (which should be warmed with a swill of boiling water first) then you add the milk to the cup first to cool the tea down to a more drinkable and enjoyable temperature
I get Mat and steph, they are married, but why is Tom so ready and willing to swap spit with them? 🤔 you would after the panorama people would be a liiiittle bit more careful about these kinds of things…..
Is... is 3-4 cups a day a lot?
No Yorkshire tea gold, experimental data invalidated, dislike incoming.
Why not add milk when you boil the tea? Seems kinda dumb, ngl.
No Variables pertaining to the water? Like the hardness of water or pH?
As an Asian Brit 3 or 4 cups sounds normal to me XD
Just use the same cup
HI
Who puts milk in first??? As a British person I’ve always put the milk last
Wait, what about the type of milk?
You can see Steph's "Mom Instincts" at 6:28 when she actually catches the loose leaf
anyone else notice there was no intro video?
As a Brit, it's been drilled into me that milk in first is a cardinal sin. So that might have been true once with the cup quality, but not anymore. Soooo its still the British way and Mat trying to dunk us for nothing 🤷‍♀️
i'm less than 2 minutes in and they've already lost me because they decided that the british should be the standard for tea
Matt at least steph drinks only four cups of tea, i make two pot fulls and drink it all in the same day. And these pots are like 7 or 8 inches im pretty sure.
Answer: No milk. Zero.
you put milk in tea?
Matpat, what kind of milk is the best?
Its also about what water you use to make the tea..
You. You!!!!!! How DARE YOU!! YOU DARE INSULT MY TEA. MY COUNTRY BECAME THE BIGGEST DRUG CARTEL WORLDWIDE TO GET TEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The level of heresy you'd go to for content. Now let me suggest this - fresh herbal tea. Not tea leaves, herbs. Hot water poured over it. Sugar is optional but not needed if you know what you're doing. Sage is the best but I have a hias
Hello matpat
The water you use also makes a difference 🙈
You also started with a hotter cup in the glass because you used it to measure the water for the other cups... so starting water temperature would be hottest in the glass cup
i cant believe that the way i've been doing is similar to the perfect tea, tho i love that sweet, sweet bitter taste of the tea bag
before I watch this video, let me say that if you disagree with the way I make tea... there will be words
Why didn't you get an indian since the tea is from india
You should open a restaurant with all kinds of "perfect"" foods and drinks
Why did they not invite the tea expert thespiffingbrit on to the show
No, No, No YOU are the one thats wrong
Matpat where is the chinese guy with the chinese tea, its my favorite kind of tea
Sees the word tea: *Asians enter the chat*
what about the addition of sugar? or does nobody do it
that was a pure waste of time and annoyed me ..... u was taking a lot with no value or something interesting
Next time: sweenters or sugar???
Wait milk in first is the British way? I don't know anyone that puts milk in first in England.
Why would anyone put milk in tea?
Bro how can you say, "we need someone who was born in it, molded by it..." Then bring out a British guy? Tea is from Asia! You even said so in your video. The right way should be the Asian way.
We already put the milk on top tho 😅
Tom: "There we are." Matpat: "👆👆👆👆👆"
you missed the biggest factor ... the water !!!! seriously there is tap water or something like distilled or reverse osmosis.... huge difference in colour, flavor and texture, yes texture !  I think this calls for a do over !
Wait what. You are suposed to put milk in tea. In Romania we do boil the herbs in water and drink it
How dare you sir, don't speak to me or my 8-10 cups of tea a day again!
U know ones britist because he sounds like will :)
3 to 4 mugs of tea a day? That's cute.
Want some tea m8?
this episode means nothing to me cause i don't like tea but still thoroughly entertaining
the links in the description are broken..
where are ypu supposed to boil the water then?
0:26 didint know his wife was a bit british. Anyone else here getting married to the ones that colonized you?
Those pyramid bags are pretty bad for the environment in comparison to the other options :(
I'm surprised that they didn't test microwaved hot water vs using a kettle vs using something on the stove! I'm sure the kettle would win, but I'm super curious!
As a Brit, I'm already triggered and I've not even watched the video yet.....!
You should do this with coffee
8:59 Steph doing her best producer guy from pitch meeting
What about the difference between the quality of the tea in the different bags, ie whole or partial leaves vs "tea dust" in many flat tea bags? #confoundingvariable ?
In Turkey, we drink like 6-7 cup of tea a day
Matt u kinda forgot the type of water that is better to brew ur tea. Yes, the type of water u use can change the taste of ur tea. Im surprised u miss this part.
When life gives you lemons you make lemonade anyone who's played Portal 2 Makes combustible lemons that burns your house down.
I'm disappointed that Mat didnt say Food Tea-ory.
Part 2: Exactly what you did but with 3 teaspoons sugar and sweetened powdered milk or something around those lines.  Yh.
yeah mind your fucking business matpat, it's my tea and I know what's right for it
*Steph drinking 3-4 cup of tea a day* Me drinking a giant can of tea and drinking it 3-5 time a day: pathetic
obsessed w the boston tea party joke
Forgot 1 key factor to test, steeping vs dunking.  You know, dunking the tea bag, where we get the phrase "tea bagging" to begin with. It's also how the flat tea bags are designed to diffuse the tea more, rather than just letting it soak.
0/10 never said "___ ____  not ____ (presumably "my") cup of tea"
"Warm leaf water" Iroh's ghost is yelling at us from the spirit world
I still don't get the "don't use microwave" argument. Why do I need a kettle just to boil water when a microwave can do the same? I feel like there wasn't enough research in that part.
Glass one was the hottest cuz it contained the hot water 3 times in a row, while the other one only contained the already cooled downed water poured from the glass.
No matpat you use cinnamon tea with extra cinnamon then add cinnamon and cinnamon CAN YOU TELL I LOVE CINNAMON
Around here in Pakistan we make it by Combining, around 3/4th water with 1/4 milk (maybe less) Or if you're powder milk fan the 1 tbsp in each cup Half tbsp of tea leaves for each cup And sugar up to taste We boil it on medium untill 4 mins or till color change then we leve it for how strong we want ☕
3-4???? That's minute.5-10 is normal
As a Chinese, I always feel weird to see people adding milk into tea, it goes straight into milk tea category for me 😂
a Brit here. The milk thing is a problem when using a teabag. The water used to make tea needs to be at 100C (212F). Pouring the milk into a mug first, lowers the temperature of the water and you don't get the full flavour of the tea. Pouring the milk into the cup first when using a teapot won't make a huge difference as the tea has already brewed and the magic has happened. The 'Tradition' MatPat busted wasn't. They just made tea wrong. Redo the test with tea in a pre-warmed pot and milk poured into a teacup, not a mug. You will find it tastes the same, or slightly better as a teabag in a mug, with boiling water and add the milk last.
Not offended me by putting milk in after the water, we don't have cheap porcelin anymore, anyone who puts the milk in first however is never asked to make a brew again
Hi Yorkshire tea here, king of tea's, terror of the tannin, master over milk,  stopper of the steepenning. I'm afraid your English person must hence forth be banished, milk only goes in first when using a tea pot, if in a mug it must be bag, water, steep, milk then sugar. This is the king of tea's decree.
I always go milk on top but decide how much by color due to variations in the brew.
Who care i prefer chai
As a Brit I am disgusted that anyone puts their milk in first. My parents raised me better than that.
in turkey we drink 17-19 glass of tea per day
When making tea I swivel my teabag bc I’m impatient and don’t wanna wait 2 - 3 minutes 😂
Hoo boy. Having seen first hand an actual fight almost break out over cultural differences over how tea is prepared and drunk, I can’t wait to see the “calm and reasonable” people in the comments
Only 3-4 cups a day. Rookie numbers 🇬🇧  Also everyone in that Kitchen sucks at making tea
As a British person (I might regret this haha) I agree with this entire video! The perfect cup of tea! Well done Food Theory and Science!
But what about reusing tea bags? Using one bag per cup seems like it could get expensive. Does reusing the bag for a second cup affect the taste?
17:20 bro the editors put the wrong png in. they liked the top milk and yet the editors had put bottem tea png, just goes to show that we are all human and matpat needs to give the editors just 5 minutes of sun light.
Ahh perfect timing for drinking tea
From the Asian perspective, the british have been making tea completely wrong from the beginning.
I literally drinking tea right now
I'm pretty sure most British people do milk second anyway, we discovered this year's ago
Milk on top or in the cup you never showed how you made it... I'm assuming you brewed the tea in a teapot first then poured the brewed tea into the cups. Because if you're making it by pouring boiling water into milk then adding a teabag and steeping it, then that's just wrong. It's not hot enough for the tea to steep
Food theory idea:does an apple a day really keep the doctor away?(week 16)
oi little brother, I see you as a well respected individual but i must vocalize that I was distressed on thy title and shall utter that my latte leaf broth beverage isn't bad in any possible way I look at it, say more and pay the price
Bon ApeTEA :3
I like that I've made the perfect tea the whole time
now do one with coffee
The reason adding the milk first changes the flavors is because the boiling water begins to cook or even curdle the milk. The thermal shock is too much and can ruin the flavor of the milk.
Try steeping tea for 5 mins, squeeze the bag to get a strong (high tannin) tea, then add 46ml of milk.
What about plastic leaching from pyramid teabags?
flat paper teabags collect so much tea dust in between the 2 layers wash them
Ah, So my family liking how I make tea the best is scientifically backed. Wonderful.
The tea of tea
"How much milk should you be putting into your tea?"  What about none? Tea without milk is just plainly better. If you put milk in there you're doing that because you don't like the taste of pure, unadulterated tea.
I don't see what's wrong with microwaving the water to boil it. I'm broke, if you want me to use a kettle, then *buy me a kettle.* ...Also, side note, if anyone's reading this who *has* loose leaf tea, be very careful how you store it. I *thought* the containers it came in would be good enough to keep things from getting in there, but I was *wrong,* and they got maggots. They weren't *rotting* or *moldy,* it was just *maggots.* Keep your loose leaf tea in an air tight container. Learn from my mistake.
In Malaysia instead of using normal milk, we use condensed milk as it has the perfect amount of sugar in it just 1 or 2 tablespoon is enough and VOILA a perfect cuppa!
Dad Pat is strong in this one
I only add milk to my tea if it's too bitter
Brit here with a question! I've always put my milk on top and when argued I was always told to say "putting milk in before the tea bag means the tea can't come out of the bag properly and makes the tea weaker" never knew if this scientifically held true. Obviously based on steeping the bag in the mug not a pot.  I'm ready for a tea saga.
now what is the most optimal cup of coffee
3-4 *cups* of tea a day? AMATEUR. I drink like 3-4 LITRES of tea a day.
I'm surprised you didn't compare heating the water in the microwave vs in a kettle. Is there really a difference or is it a placebo effect based on the idea that the microwave is somehow heating the water "differently"?
I already put the milk in last. Nice to know I had it right this whole time.
... bovine milk or goat milk? ~
Milk tea is not my cup of tea. Long brew and honey - that's the stuff though. I drink around 2L of this per day, every day.
proper way to drink tea is no milk and not removing the bag. the bag stays in there the entire time and get's sqeesed out in the end. tea is not bitter or to strong it's to weak and flavourless. i do not get how people can be such pussys that they need milk in their tea to make it less bitter when it ain't even got flavour to it in the first place.
We don't put the milk in first! Haven't done for decades you'd get slapped here in England if ya did. However it would be optimal to putting water boiled just that second and burning your fresh leaves. 78°C is the best temperature to steep tea in so it doesn't go overly bitter whilst still allowing a longer stronger brew time.
Can’t believe a Brit didn’t know milk goes on top, honestly never heard someone put milk in first
Another interesting „kind of“ tea is Cascara. It is made of coffee cherries, the ones around the beans. Typically they are a Side-product from coffee bean farming and only for waste, but you can also use it to make tea. It has caffeeine and makes this a perfect coffee alternative for people who dont like coffee because it tastes nothing like it. (Such as me) I wouldnt call it underrated it is just not very well known.  Would be interesting to know if somebody here knows it and even drank it before. Maybe itd be even a Food Theory worthy topic. (Cascara! The perfect coffee alternative?!)
what's the water volume in "one cup of tea"? what percentage is 26.5ml of milk?
The first brew of loose leaf tea isn't supposed to be drunken. The leaves are still opening on the first brew and I usually use my leaves for about 3 (good) brews.
Waw, this video caught me way stronger than would expect ! Need triangle tea bags now .__.
I may be in the UK, but I don't drink tea.
ISO 3103
Tea made by mom is better than any of your "TEA". I am Indian 🇮🇳
"best milk, is no milk in tea" TRUE! THANKS MAT! Here in Italy I've NEVER seen a SINGLE person that put milk in their tea. Thank you for saying the truth.
stainless steel cups/mugs definitely have a flavor to them that sometimes complement the beverage
one more Tea pun and am clicking off...
Tom hardy is also British, that works perfectly!
Wth is the tea in the thumbnail? That’s sweet tea, proper tea doesn’t look like that
3-4 cups a day? bish I drink 3-4 teapots a day.
Add a Dash of salt!
You forgot how much water should be in the cup and how long you should boil the water 🧐
Best episode ever
As a Brit milk last tastes better. I've tried both ways with different types of milk (red, green, blue) and personally green is best for smooth with red best for stronger taste
You should really consider doing an episode comparing the Tanins in different types of tea. As a south african I prefer "rooibos" but this makes me wonder if it has less ( or more) of certain components?
Im literally drinking like 3 pots of tea every day  No joke
I boil water in the microwave all the time. Genuinely feel like it makes no difference, but then again I'm not a tea snob.
Matpat should have just called it Teaktok
I am British and have been making tea the way MatPat suggests all my life.
matt being racist to the british as usual
Aight now do this according to asian customs
I agree with MatPat, best milk is no milk in tea
You guys should do something with an Eastern Tea service as well. This is all too much Western tea service, but I'd love to see something regarding an Eastern Tea service. Like, what's the healthiest tea? What sort of teas are more nutritious? Etc. Etc
I have NEVER PUT milk in first I have always put it in second
video 7 of asking matpat to make a theory on bonelab
BRITS??? JUST BRITS? HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN PAKISTANIS?
My takeaway from this is that the British debate of milk order has been finally settled.
12:35 So milk to tea ratio is 1 to 4.  In the example you gave however you said 48ml milk to 240ml tea which is a ratio of 1 to 5.  I’m confused, shouldn’t it be 60ml milk?
Is it just me, or are they starting to talk faster near the end?
As a "Brit" everyone I know already put the milk in last, but I did always squeeze the bag after but no longer!
me and my family drink roobios, and apparantly its not as delicate as englands dainty little tea, because it tastes the same no matter what you do to it
no milk gang
Wow
Come everybody knows Pakistanis are the actual tea experts.
thanks to this video, i found out I can use my coffee maker (its a frech press) to make tea, and have better tea than bags
best tea: green tea with 2 globs of honey
Imagine ruining a perfectly fine cup of tea with milk...
the way my family makes tea is. first put 50% water and 50% milk and put this mixture to boil on an open flame add tea leaves and sugar like 1 spoon each per cup and boil it till the colour looks good then just strain the tea into a cup and drink it edit: this is just shortcut way for quick, easy and good tasting tea.
Please do one about coffee if that’s possible id love to figure out how to make my 3 coffees a day actually taste good rather then taste like hot water? 😂😂 until then at least now I know I’ve been making my tea the good way
To be fair... Australians use more infused tea leaves than the brittish. They've narrowed it down to 'rounders' and tea bags which is honestly... ammateur.
2:59  every tea-drinker in the world screamed  Also as a avid tea drinker i suggest rednecking it and drinking it out of mason jars, contingent on the tea of course.
3-4 CUPS? Those are baby numbers! Maybe if it was 3-4 MUGS of tea...
So fun fact, British person here. The milk going in the bottom or top has been a huge contentious point here - I've generally put it in the bottom of the cup (though no more) but there's a second part to the history you were talking about. Cheap china would crack with boiling tea getting poured in, so people would put the milk in first to regulate the temperature, but expensive china would not. So, people who had higher quality cups that wouldn't crack would put the tea in first and then add milk as per their liking as to not spoil the taste. Thus, when now we no longer have this issue, it became a point of debate over here.
I choked when Tom said Special-tea 😂
Do Asian teas/brew methods next. Their brew methods look fun like their little tea pets, but I don't know which to start with
I've never seen a part-Italian and a Brit bond so much
i 100% agree with matpat that milk should not be added to tea. tea with milk is absolutely outrageous
As a Brit... I approve of all these cringey tea puns!!
You guys are funny!
Shut up... if anyone ever makes a cup of tea with the milk in first in England.... they will never live it down
I did a lab assignment with a 20+ page report on tea and coffee as antioxidants earlier this year. When Mat mentioned that tea is made from Flavonoids and Polyphenols all the memories came rushing back.
3 combo pun knocked me out...
Just use one of those tea pots with a filter built into it. Just brew the tea leaves loose. Bam, maximum flavour infusion.
No, YOUR tea sucks! Almost every single one of the "ingredients" they put into their tea making was WRONG!! I just agree with MatPat on one thing: no milk in tea! Period!
As a tea lover I'm so horrified by that 'hack'. That tea must have tasted like 100% sadness T.T
I am British and I put milk on top when making tea. Coffee I put milk in before water
I’m only half way down with the video but I have already learned a lot about tea that Is gonna be really helpful
While i was waching i was drinking lemonade,cocoa and tea and i thought that they woud make NORMAL TEA and try to make it better not that they woud just change mugs and i imagined what woud his son see like dad burning his hand on mug mom trowing tea on friend cat drinking avocado water THAT KID WILL HAVE TRAUMA FOR REST OF HIS LIFE and afterlife.
Coffee mate all the way
XD how many times will matpat burn his hands because of these experiments, I dunno but it'll never stop being funny, his reactions are just to hilarious
I was watching this entire video, ready to rant in the comments but y’all actually arrived at the EXACT way I make my tea 😂😂😂 as a person who also 3-4 cups of tea each day, I am very very happy 😄
I'm with Matpat on this one. milk in tea is wrong. lemon+black tea is the best combo
"we need a tea expert" and then they go to the UK 😭 bruh they can't even drink tea without adding things to it, you need an Asian  it comes from our land
If you make another Tea based episode maybe try to get a Turkish person to help since Turkey is the country that drinks the most tea (3.16 kg (6.96 lb)), other then that, this video was amazing!
oh you are wrong on this one matpat this is how you make tea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIac7kmuDUI and this is just the simple basic method not bringing it to perfection. brewing tea is an art don't insult it by using tea bags
This episode was sooo funny
I agree no milk in tea is best.  Also would love to see an episode about micro plastic in food/water.
Probably gonna have a party in Boston tonight, brb
I’m getting that Mythbusters feeling of wanting to tell everyone I’ve had this argument with “I TOLD YOU SO” 😆 I love this power trio, they’re so fun
We drink tea instead of water actually. It can be even 15 cups sometimes for pros like my dad & mom.
Okay but the country that actually drinks the most tea in the world is actually Turkey, not the UK, we actually do right by tea by not adding milk in it Also you gotta stir it using the teabag as it steeps, not just let it sit there
Tea is meant to be iced and sometimes sweetened, or thrown into the boston harbor
Day 12 of asking for a telletubbies theory
man i just boil water and leave my tea bag in the mug then poor and steep!
Make a theory about house of the dragon
3:50 I saw matcha
You put milk in your tea?
It's milk first when using a tea pot, because it's already mixed before it hits the milk, which is why it's better with a teabag doing the opposite because it's doing the same thing... Making everything else in the tea before adding the milk. I remember a study found that milk doesn't absorb the juices from the teabags as well as hot water
you drink tea in cups not mugs
You but milk in your tea?
Wait, what's so bad about microwaving your water? It's not like you're microwaving it with the tea already in it.
My dad grew up in Britain s but we make our tea like sugar first tea bag then boiling water and put some milk on top
I don’t like milk in my tea ☕️👌😅
Best tea, its easily chai
I’ve never seen ANYONE put the milk in first. I’m British (Scottish) and this is exactly how I make tea.
I always squeeze out the tea bags for that extra bitter flavour at the end. Being from Argentina bitter leaf soup are our specialty
how I make tea: 1. pour it into the cup from the jug
Not to be offensive but Stephanie's wrinkles are so apparent now than ever before. I understand that's expected with age but still.
MatPat:  Water quality makes the pizza crust. Also MatPat: Tea bag shape, how long to steep, is milk a top or bottom, and lastly the type of mug. We can't possibly think of any other variable that would affect the quality of the tea.
As a Brit I agree with everything here. Our family has always put the milk on top, for as long as I can remember. I don't know anyone that puts milk first, or I do and they are hiding their shame.
Matt might have Dutch ancestors... Who puts milk in tea?
I was so happy when he pronounced assam correctly instead of saying a Sam
I'm British. 31 years old. Never have I ever put milk on the bottom of tea!!!! Coffee yes! It takes the bitterness away for coffee. Tea, milk on top 😅
For the test where they had to choose between milk on top of bottom, the reason it tasted different was because of how hot particles rise and cold particles fall. Having the milk on the bottom meant that the tea and milk couldn't mix, but putting it on top made the liquids able to mix, therefor giving a more balanced result. That's my theory, anyway. My *paRticLE thEOry!*
I wonder if the type of milk (whole, semi skimmed or skimmed) might have made a difference to the taste? 🤔
3-4 a day? And she thinks that's a lot?  **Laughs in Ireland** 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   Edit: Does Steph not know what a pyramid looks like? That wasn't a pyramid...
Sure country which created tea dont know how to drink
What about southern iced sweet tea
No Milk is the correct way to drink tea. I would know, I worked in the tea industry for almost decade (I even made a video about overrated teas). If you want to butcher tea with milk then use the crappest, cheapest tea and brew it forever. I am a person who has two sugars though. It is like adding salt to a dish.
As a turk, i agree with Matpat. Best milk is no milk
my mum has like 3-4 cups a day
As a British person, I never actually learned the science of tea in school until now. Thanks Mat!
what?  only 1/4th of the cup is milk?  i straight up don't add water in my tea and boil the milk with the tea leaves, and it is definitely better than this thing tiktokers made it's basically chai but without the spices
So what I've learned from this is that, aside from pyramid bags which I've never seen, I've been making my tea exactly right all my life, even as an American.
as a brit, everyone i know does exactly this, never seen anyone put milk first, I think that tradition has been toppled already
YOU FORGOT WATER TEMPERATURE WHILE STEEPING… IT’s LIKE TEA BASICS 101
As a Turk, I am proud to say that putting the milk on top of tea is our tradition. Btw I was kinda hoping you would also use tulip-shaped glass called ince belli (slim waist) for the shape test.
Fun info for Chinese traditional tea: For good luck, when making the tea pot and cups, the leftover clay was used to make a tea pet, which you pour some tea on as a sign of good luck. There's color changing ones too to test the temperature of your tea, but it is a long term tradition. Plus, some ceramics will soak the scent of the tea (as mentioned by Matpat during the cup phase), so using the same tea regularly will cause your tea pet to smell delightful
COFFEE NEXT PWEEEAASDEE
Now i want to make a tea like in this video. Because where i live we make "tea" really different.: Boiling water+tea filter then lemon, and sugar. Sorry for everyone who know how to make a tea.
from southeast london, we put our water in before the milk?
I like sugar in my English tea
You need to warm the milk first then pour in the cup then mix the tea and trust me it will slap
You did miss one of the most important variables: the temperature at which you heat your water to. It makes a major difference and depending on the type of leaf and how the tea has been roasted in the drying process, the temperature of the water is arguably the most important part.
2:22, MatPat looks so...tired here.
at 2:19 Everyone : *cheerful* Matpat: *Looking absolutely deranged (he really needs some coffee bro )
I wonder what the British thinks about the Indian chai.
Matpat: our warm leaf water  Uncle Iroh: so you have chosen... Death
I’m surprised they didn’t test paper to go cups, Tim hortons is often a stop for me after I drop the kids off at school!
When pouring tea using tea bags. I find it more efficient to put the tea bag in before the water so that the teabag would get saturated with the water as it pours down and dosnt just float on top of the water.
My parents exclusively use a teapot. They add the milk into their mugs first, in the kitchen, and then carry the mugs through to the living room. If they added the milk after they'd need to take the milk through and have it sit at room temp until the tea is brewed, likely leaving condensation around the container, or, they'd need to dirty another container to take the milk through.  So, for the teapot method, I think adding the milk first makes most sense. It also let's them see how much milk they're adding, which is VERY important to them. Adding the milk first if you're putting the teabag into the mug is absolute madness!!
No milk... guys. 🤦‍♂️
My mom would just straight up pour ~200°F boiling water into the tea and step it for a few minutes; Same for coffee. However, I told her about how the temperature of the water, and the time to steep makes a huge difference.  Her response is that they're just tea/coffee, that none of that matters, and that you should always use boiling water. She grew up in Vietnam, I'm a Virginian-born Okie.
Wouldn't loose leaf be the best by just adding less tea leaves, saving tea leaves as well.
The way I, a Sri Lankan, makes Milk tea: (i know, nobody asked)  1. boil water 2. throw some pure tea leaves (no bag)  3. use a strainer to filter out the leaves and let the tea spill out 4. prepare a mixture of milk (i use powdered milk, normal powdered milk not baby formula) and sugar 5. mix and stir 6. drincc
My family puts water and milk half and half, just throw it in the pot with fine leaves 🙂 ....and sugar (......and very sometimes grated ginger)
Best tea is persian tea
As a Brit, you are assumed to be crazy if you put milk before the tea. It's just wrong to us. It's like the only people who can have more than 3 sugars are Builders, anyone else would be seen as a Psychopath.
Am I the only Indian who doesn't add water??
I wonder if the milk issue, depends on British milk vs American milk.
Thanks for this Food TEAory video!
You have also made a lot of Australians mad with this one
I always thought you shouldn't fully boil the water? I never let it go to the boiling point, and feel the tea tastes less bitter
I never knew that British tea gatekeeping was a thing until now  The whole idea that there is only one way to enjoy a certain beverage is silly and wrong. Sure there is a supposed way to make our classic British tea but as we saw in the video not everyone is going to like that the most therefore there is no such thing as a perfect cup of tea. Overall loved the video, it looked like a lot of fun to make!
For my family, we don't use milk but using sugar. We make our tea in a jug for family size with 2-3 tea bags and usually leave the teabags in the jug. Also, there is this type of teabag that doesn't have strings so you only leave it in the teapot. I am really curious about it as it doesn't bitter.
Is anyone feel a little shook about them sharing cups? Nothing wrong but it was intresting.
When is the spice chaser video coming
That TikTok video genuinely hurt to watch with each step. Also the idea of putting the milk first always sounded horrendous to me. The whole point of milk at the end is to know when to stop as you see the tea reach the desired shade. Same for coffee with me. Always milk last. Didn't know about the method of milk first to preserve the cups here in the past however, but that at least makes sense.  Water striaght from the tap, heated in the microwave then tea bag at the END? Sick mothers. I've never felt so attacked by someone doing something so inherently incorrect 🥲
No milk best milk
You are forgetting one important part of British tea the lemon or lime slide but that is okay
Tea Sucks! like what kind of scam makes you think that putting levees in hot water makes something tasty.  it doesn`t even tastes good! the first person ever to grow tea must have laughed so hard at the people who bought it from him.
I feel like ever since MatPat has had Oliver he has been making a lot more sad jokes. Just saying.
I'm actually drinking a tea waking this
Gotta rip those bags open and compare the leaves. There is a difference
I would have pulled out a spectrophtometer.
Look up My Proper Tea by Doc Brown
Actually u missed one variable, you could try out different kinds of milk as well
Honestly, everyone I know puts milk in after the water. I don't know anyone who does milk first. Maybe thats common in other parts of the UK?
As an English person I either have my tea without milk or with milk on top.
Add milk into tea and debates over that. Meanwhile here I am drinking tea with a small packet of sugar and drinking it in a metal cup.  Oh yeah, I guess we do have that here. I believe it is called Teh Gao (I apologise my Hokien is very bad), where they use condensed milk (?), I could be completely wrong here.  Anyone from Singapore, can you confirm this?
also try how they do it in china. The modern rogue made 2 videos on it.
Hey european here, we put milk kn tea? I just put boiling water, two spoons of sugar and honey and cold water to cool ita little
Poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooop
guys, maybe clear mugs will help further in visual explanation? ;P love the breakdown though!😘
The brits have been doing milk last for a long time
Fallacy here: the type of teabags: even the same brand of tea doesn’t mean that the same tea leaves are used. Normally loose tea is the best type of leaves- while pyramid tea bags at least claim to use loose tea (but probably are a level below; and normal tea bags are usually the broken tea and dust from the tea production.  So even the same brand uses widely different tea leaf quality in different bags… While loose tea might not be the favorite tea for a strong and balanced tea (and especially not in a tea egg). Smaller leaves infusing the water better than larger ones. So it is a very subjective and also difficult to determine factor.
I make fruit teas with honey and lemon juice so…
There is one thing ypu forgot and that is what type of milk works best.
Matpat was right, real tea doesn't have any tea. Also I don't know a single fellow Brit that puts milk first at all so yeah... we solved this years ago guys sorry
Matpat jumping in excitement was adorable.
Indian here. Disappointed that Brits don't even add anything to their tea. Sad sad.
spot of tea?
Could it be that the glass cup was the hottest because you literally put 3x the amount of hot water through it compared to the other cups...when pouring out the hot water at the end..
u all are wrong, spice chai is the real tea, it has the population majority. get rekt
I just drink my good ol Ito En oolong tea and call it a day.
1. A  dishwasher is for any dish that will not break, or melt. Washing dishes by hand is like washing clothes by hand. Use the machine unless it's not an option. 2. Milk doesn't belong anywhere near tea. I prefer my tea with fruit juice, or honey.
As a British person I always pour milk on top of the tea. The only thing I don’t really worry about is the shape of the tea bag. Milk goes before hot water for coffee (though I don’t drink coffee).
The titles reminds me of Megadeth
As a English person I can say that people do put milk last
they dunked so hard on tiktok tea that they failed to appropriately test microwaving as a legitimate (or not) alternative to heat up your water. It should be faster, more energy efficient and give more precise/reproducible control over the volume and temperature of your water and yet because adding the milk before the bag was such a failure, they said hot water from the microwave no longer deserved a place as testable factor... hardly a particularly scientific exploration when you think about it...
Tea is Turkish🇹🇷🇹🇷 you shouldn' t put milk in it.
Try Indian chai as well
Indian here : first boil water, add tea leafs and let it boil it for 2 minutes, then add milk and   sugar, let it boil for 1 minutes. And that's how you make tea.
What about the amount of stirs.... and .... counter clockwise?
Going to drink my japanese milk tea  🍵
"3-4 cups of tea aday" Me over here laughing in British, those are baby figures 🤣
The only thing they didn't consider are the microplastics in the pyramid teabags (& most regular teabags) & the fact that loose leaf tea is much more sustainable
You wanted someone British who knows a lot about tea and you didn't invite the spiffing brit? For shame
13:35 tottaly agree, my favorite kind of tea is a berry mix, water, lemon, and suggar. I have tried milked tea before and that was just not tea...
InTEAresting Never trust TEAktok
When serving from a pot the milk is added first.  When using tea bags in a mug, milk is last.
I'm disappointed you didn't collab with The Spiffing Brit, even if all you did was use a sound bite of him saying something about Yorkshire Tea and trying that.
I can appreciate putting milk in tea, but I prefer my tea milk-less. Makes the flavor of the tea stand out more.
Rooibos tea is the best tea in the universe  Fight me
Now I'm patiently waiting for how to drink coffee the best way, i am both a tea and a coffee lover so I'm really happy to see this episode to expand my knowledge on tea ^^
It's not possible to make tea while putting milk in first because the tea bag won't mix
I live in Assam. Next to a tea garden/factory.  We brew the loose CTC (crush-tear-curl process of making tea leaves from raw leaves) leaves in a pot of water till it starts looking dark red.  Then we add the milk in the pot WHILE it's brewing.  Sugar is optional depending on the drinker if it's for a couple people. If it's being made for a big bunch of people, then sugar goes in after the milk during the brew without any options being presented.   PS: Tea bags are too fancy for us.
I always grew up with if you're making tea in a mug: teabag, water then splash of milk. If you're doing teapot tea: milk in the mug first then pour the tea on top. They both taste different but they're both nice imo. It's really only old people that bugger about with teapots now though so they're the only ones putting milk in first 😂
OM bri-ish as americans would say and no one I know in my whole life has poured there milk first
You just did BRITISH tea. So what's next? CHINESE tea? JAPANESE tea?
I don't understand the microwave hate. I mean boiling water is boiling water (personally I love the kettle but still) [OH THE BURING HAND THING!]
They didnt test microwave versus boiling. seriously, why would water care if its microwaved or not?
First I have ever heard of milk in 1st. Also a good quality loose leaf tea is fun because the teaspoon of them re-hydrates into a cup full of regular leaves :D I got a five quid 500g box of green tea and drinking 6 cups a day its barely gone bellow half full :/
I'm from a small market town in Wales. And everyone I know follows the game theory recomended method for making tea almost exactly. After talking with a lot of different people from across the country over the years, the milk preference changes depending on where they are from. From my own personal experience a lot of bigger cities and port towns  seem to do it milk first where a lot of rural places / locations further away from the coast do milk last. This isn't an exact science at all. But it definitely seems to hold true from my own understanding.
i think we can all safely agree the best tea is an ice cold sweet tea
3-4 cups a day isn't much
But that’s just a theory of financial theory thanks for watching!
The best way to make tea is to fill a 5 gallon glass jar with water, hang about 10-12 bags down into the jar (strings held by the lid) and set it in the sun all day. The only drawback is you can really only do it in the summer.
Pro tip: If you brew it in a Pot and go to another room after putting the timer on, give the timer 2:30, because by the time you actually get back to the tea and have pured it into your second pot, it will have had 3 minutes^^
What milk?
brits vs tik tok
As a British person seeing that disgrace of a video made me feel ill
Now I need to learn the optimal way to make hot cocoa!
Wait. Ya guys are using milk in a tea?
Adding the tea to hot water ALREADY WRONG
Milk in second is way more normal in the uk than in first but it is a debate we still have.
So I recently did a coffee cupping which is basically the wine testing of coffee and the person who was doing it gave a very in-depth conversation about where coffee comes from and how it's grown. I think that would be a really interesting episode for you guys and I'd love to hear you guys take about it
3 to 4 cups? Pathetic. As a Turkish person I drink at least 10 glasses per day.
You're killing me emotionally with these damm puns
but does any of this make tea not taste like dirt?
You should try filtered water
As a Brit, most of the Brits I know put milk in last.
I'm surprised Tom didn't correct Matt as most of us Brits already pour the milk on top of the tea
Could've always tested 2-4 min range to see if it leaned more towards one or the other. Also different milk levels instead of just in the middle. But these might have also been tested and edited out.
If your tea comes in a bag, you’re already wrong and I’m with Matt. No milk.
Try to make red,green and orange Borsh from Ukrain (what do you think is the best
Y'all haven't had Indian Chai, and it shows.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT CONDENSED MILK IN THEIR
anyone else got the urge to ask matpat to make a video on chai?? as a indian i would love it
The best milk:tea ratio is 100% milk, 0% tea.  Also disappointed you didn’t test western teacup vs eastern teacup.
As a hardcore tea lover, this is all so obvious to me. Also, I agree with Mat on the milk part.
Whats better to sweatten tea, sugar or honey?
Coffee is still better!!!
I'm sticking to my American southern sweet tea
tea good
Would love to see u try Indian masala tea and conclude it is the best type of tea 😂
Well. Me and my mom have been doing right tea from the start of my career of tea sTEAler
Assam isn't a region my guy, it's a state of India like Illinois or Mississippi.
One thing as far as temperature is that by dolling out the liquid with the glass cup, you are "preheating" the mug so it's going to stay hotter for longer. A thicker mug with no preheating is going to leech out the heat.  I used to waitress and would always run hot water over the mug before pouring coffee because it makes it hotter for longer.
I must say that being from the UK I don’t know anybody that puts the milk in first…
(Before watching this video ) people in Singapore steap the tea in boiling hot water then we put condensed milk in
Watching this video with my morning tea.
I watch a guy that's makes all different kinds of knifes.  But while he is letting them temper in the oven he makes tea and some look like potpourri or just dried flowers .
Gotta do Chinese style
From the South in UK and milk has always gone in last!
thank you for validating that people SHOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR TEABAG IN THEIR MUG AS THEY DRINK THEIR TEA bc it makes the tea more and more bitter as you go along drinking it
I mean, I know NOBODY who puts the milk in first.
They aren’t even using the right pot
loose leaf or gtfo, tea bag sycophants.
why is the microwave bad? im not gunna boil water in a pot on the stove just for a glass of leaf water lmfao
There are sometimes oversights in these live tests and I can just mostly shrug those off. The entertainment is always there, in this one too, so it's not that big of a deal. But this one. There is so many things that I just can't accept all of it. You say that it's wrong to microwave the water but you never tested that alone against boiling, you talk about cups and I hope that means your freedom units aka ~240ml so there is some consistency. You even say that there are a lot of different cups in your cabinet and those are not scientifically measured. It wasn't clearly stated that how much tea leaves you are using with how much water each time. And you even didn't try different tea/water ratios. You wanted exact steeping time but you did it with 2 minutes intervals and didn't try something like 2m30s or 3m30s after figuring out that 3 minutes is better than 1 or 5. For the sake of not writing a whole book here I'll stop the nitpicking here. Keep goofing around, I like it and it makes me and many more laugh, but if you say you want to be precise, you want to be exact, and you want to be scientific, you have to do the tests properly.
We don't put the milk in first, https://youtu.be/Ei46KnXB3BA Doc Brown's rap might be a quicker version of this video.
Yorkshire tea gold is the only correct way my friend. *MILK FIRST IS A CRIME*
Try doing it in the Turkish way
milk first then cereal
This is all fine and all, when do you add sugar?
Me, an Indian, wondering when they're gonna make chai Also YOU GUYS PUT CHILLED MILK IN TEA WTF??? I never knew this My process is simple: Boiling water in a pan, put on stove Once it starts boiling, put tealeaves in (a teaspoonful per person) Sugar (optional) Ginger or ilaichi or cloves or whatever (optional) Let it simmer When it starts turning dark brown, add milk Let it simmer a bit more When it turn the right shade of brown, take out  I usually use my eyes for this entire process cuz I've been making tea in my family since I was 10. It was literally the first thing I learnt how to make so i can do it blindfolded at this point
Hi from the UK, I always have the milk in last 😂 glad that I’m not crazy lol
What's the big deal with heating the water in the microwave? Does it actually change the flavor? It's just heating the water up
Well we brits did it right  The only “wrong” way was just the way we protected our teacups.
6:55 Steph doing something important: not just dunk the tea into the cup but slightly stirring it from time to time helping it open up the leaves and extract more taste.  Also the quality in leaves and if they are whole leaves or grinded changes a lot
Your teapot was colder because you didn't use a tea cosy. If you brew tea in the cup you add milk after, if you brew in a pot it makes no difference. Your glass cup of tea might have been colder if you didn't preheat it by using it to fill the other cups. In the end the perfect cup of tea is however you personally prefer it.
is Asian and British team different? just a genuine question.
So hot water into the teabag to open the bag up, splash the moo moo juice after half a min and walk to room to drink another min after that. I'm the king of making tea sounds like
Trashes authentic tea making,  Gloats speed of microwave process. Burns hands on microwave heated cup. Instant karma. Deserved.
I was wondering which milk alternative would go best with tea
Mat, we put the milk in last. We're not animals.
Ooo! Maybe Food Theory could do an entire series on different tea types and best ways to have them? That would be might-Tea amazing! 🍵
To be fair you missed a lot of other variables. Water type, milk type, steep time
EEEEWWW! Did yoy just say to rince the mugs out! That's so disgusting! They'll smell of tea, attract insects and be a breeding ground for bacteria. Seriously! From eating food cooked in a plastic bag, and thrown about a washing machine to this, I seriously worry about your health.
3-4 cups? Amateurs! In Turkey generally people drink 7-10 cups a day. In the breakfast, chilling, eating snacks, lunch, sitting in a cafe with friends. It's like water to us. There is always a teapot on the oven.
The bags have a fluid dynamic phenomenon called Nernst diffusion layers that slow the diffusion process, if you jiggle the bags the layers are sheared and you can speed up the diffusion...also don't add milk first for bags as it further impedes the diffusion.
I didn't even know people put milk in their tea. I make tea with just water and the tea bag. After that I add honey and lemon juice. Guess I learned something new today.😂🤣😅
11:15 Am I the only one who likes bitter tea ?
>Best tea >Tea bag instead of loose leaf You can pick one.
#NoMilkInTea
Uncle Iroh would approve of this episode.
6:29 is the moment i prob would do the same lol, i just couldnt resist the attempt of doing it
the first actually useful food theory for my daily life. nevermind the conclusion is plain wrong as milk has no place in tea but still... useful
Indonesian here. Like MatPat, we also don't put milk in our tea.
Curious that the pyramid shape comes out on top. Yorkshire Tea comes in flat squares and is my (and alot of other Northerners) favourite teabag by far
i am sorry but when the word milk cam on screen i had to leave
26ml of milk to how many ml of tea?? What's the ratio??? You can't just say 26 ml is the perfect amount when mugs and cups vary in sizes
Need to see a version of this done with different coffees - Espresso, ristretto, percolated, drip, freeze-dried, instant, pod, Turkish, Vietnamese, the variety is endless and i think it would be awesome to see you guys test
Time to get people angry. I drink my tea with a few drops of lemon juice instead of milk (do not ever use both)
Hang on. Who in Britain actually puts milk first? I thought we got past that tradition a long time ago.
Nobody puts the milk in first ive never even heard of doing that
No one wants TikTok tea MatPat.
I've lived in the North of England for my entire life and I've never known anyone to put the milk in first... Don't know if this is North/South divide thing, but I'm happy that I have already been making the perfect cuppa
I can't stop thinking about how he pronounced "Assam"
I kind of want to see a theory on what food item pleases the most amount of people even with different preferences and stuff I think that would be interesting
im so tired of _tea_ jokes
Why would anyone even think to put milk first???
A food researcher from University of Newcastle Australia says microwaving the water with the tea bag in, makes for a healthier tea.  Food theory should have tried it.
I'm Turkish and the way my mom taught me to make tea was without milk. Now I have to compare my mom's tea and this tea but my mom would not let me add milk to tea. I'll try it anyway and update this comment. (If I can find the comment)  Update: I like Turkish tea more. No milk is the best just like MatPat said
Everything is wrong in these results… tea bag in pot, 4 min steep, milk first.
I like my tea with no milk or sugar
Milk first is not, at all, the British way. Sure, it’s the dirty rations era way but that’s never been a good thing. The way you know that milk first isn’t right is because nobody will ever serve you a teapot with the milk already in it, it’s always in a separate pot so you can add it after.  That and it’s obvious that milk goes after because boiling milk is always a bad idea.  Personally, sugar first, then nah, then water then milk after you’ve removed the bag
The perfect tea is actually Yorkshire Tea bags in boiling water then milk making it look like the colour of He-mans skin! Yeah my family already put the milk on top.
in turkey we drink mutated tea realy go look it up
I need Cristine to test this
What about a cup of warm water
I am with mat pat on the milk
Tea without milk is 100x better than with. Milk doesn't belong in tea. Especially if you get good quality tea. And not the shitty "British" tea.
The temperature difference at the end isn't because of the cups, but how you poured. You used the clear one to pour into the others. The temperature equalizes a bit between the cup and the liquid. You made the clear cup hot and then poured full-temperature liquid into it.
I’m surprised matpat didn’t run into the article from the university of northumbria where their scientists formulated the perfect tea equation and test that  TB + (H2O at 100C) 2mins BT + C (10ml) + 6mins BT = PC (at OT 60C)  TB = tea bag; BT = brewing time; C = milk; PC = perfect cuppa; OT = optimum temperature
BTW...rooibos (literally means "red bush") is an absolute gem that makes me proud to be South African 🇿🇦
I actually low key thought you were going to bring The Spiffing Brit on as a guest for a minute.
Honestly I don't use milk in my tea because 1 don't really like milk and 2 more importantly it removes from the flavor of the tea Edit: so maybe I added too much milk in my tea when I did it
Original tea comes from China
3 or 4 cups a day is much? 😅 I have a problem then 🙈  I have about 6-10 cups of leaf soup depending on the day
How I (a Britt) makes tea 1 boil water in kettle 2 put a teabag in cup 3 pour water on teabag  4 pour milk in cup 5 stir 6 remove teabag and let cool to desired temp and enjoy
As someone from the UK, it’s generally frowned upon to put the milk in first and I don’t think many people know someone who make tea that way.
Thank you for curing my anxie-tea
Yeah I am Team Steph as well! More tea for all of us!!Mat is so excited when they found pour milk on top of tea is better than bottom of tea.
Yorkshire tea
Bb bbbbbbbbb
Didn’t mention China/Asia once? In a episode about Tea. That’s a feat in itself. 😅
Indian here, we drink tea like anything in the world,  Indian way of tea is different...  Here more milk, the better the tea is, or more royal the tea is,  But the generally accepted ratio is 1:1 while boiling everything (water, tea, sugar then milk) together
Me an Australian: Waiting for Matpat to make a cordial food theory
The answer is Lyons. Simple
I prefer my leaf water cold
As a British person, No.
I just know that the people who enjoyed this the most are avid tea drinkers 😂  Now I wanna see the differences between kettles. I have a glass one I can use on my stovetop for the same reasons you used a glass mug. Can you taste a difference with stainless steel ones? What about cast iron, copper, or ceramic?
Hi! Loved the video so much, but just as a note! I'm from the south of England, and none of us put the milk in first! We all do it after. "Milk dear?" "Oh yeah, just a splash"
Am i the only one that worries when boiling water i poured into glass . I always think it will shatter
MatPats word of the day is: Tea
Get dunked on American tik tock
British tea isn’t good tea. British people don’t know how to make tea. The only good tea is turkish tea
What kind of milk 🥛🤔
I need to say, milk first or last is a debate over here 😂 sane people put it last, we don’t like to talk about the others 😂
Another variable could also be the type of milk
What about the sugar and it should be Yorkshire tea gold
There's a theory for you. The proper way to load a dishwasher. Everyone seems to have a different idea on how to do it to get the best wash. Idk maybe it's the people that I've dealt with in life but Ive had people have meltdowns over placement in a dishwasher.
Hope that matpat knows that British people already pours the milk on top
tea 101, miffy's and tiffy's are two sides to making tea. miffy's put milk in the mug first, and tiffy's put tea first. and putting far too much milk in tea can make the tea a nasty taste
Rush e rush tea
This whole episode made me go into Uncle Iroh mode 😂😂😂
So depending on time, I do make tea both ways XD milk on top is when I have less time and I use that method most times. When I have time I have milk at the bottom but I like more bitter tastes?
Drink the tea out of your favourite cup. It will make you happier witch will make your tea drinking experience better
I normally put the tea bag in for a couple of seconds and stir, then add the milk, then stir, and then squeeze the tea bag and take it out
What about green tea
Gotta say I expected another round of steeping at the 2 3 and 4 min marks but I assume they already spent a long time that day
I felt somewhat challenged the whole video
As a South African please try rooibos tea it tastes better than any tea you have in America
Loved learning about all this, even though I like my tea cold, no milk, and green. Thanks for making this episode! But, now you could test the source of the heat, and whether or not the microwave boiling option actually tastes worse. Also the location of the water, your pizza theory hypothesized that water makes different changes to bread depending on it's source. Also, y'all are in the south, how about a sister episode on sweet or cold tea?
Why not go to Asia and see how they drink tea???
Actually the top  countries that consume tea are  1. Ireland  2.Turkey 3. Britain
mat this whole episode is futile because in england its all about preference. you can’t calculate exact numbers because everybody should have their own specific way they want it done. some people like a lot of milk and sugar some people don’t even want milk . you can’t calculate people’s preferences.
Tea in america just doesnt taste the same... it's awful lol
If we are talking about Tea, then you should have called for an Asian for this😂. And for the delivery vessel, i would love you guys to try "Kullad", an indian tea cup for best ever taste of tea. And yes, i am Indian 😂
As soon as I saw this theory I knew spiffing Brit would comment on it.
It isn’t a tradition to put the milk on the bottom. At least not where I live, maybe it used to be but not now.
What about Asian methods? They've been steeping tea a lot longer
Not having Ceylon tea is a travesty.
Isn’t the graphic at 7:21 backwards? You decided milk on top was better, but the tea getting the boot (with the British flag on it) is a cup of tea with milk on *top*, not the bottom.
My *proper* tea recipe: tea bag in cup, then water boiled in a *kettle* poured over it, stir, remove the tea bag, then a few sugars and a splash of milk added (adjust the sugar and milk to taste)
As an Asian I agree with matpat Best is no milk in tea
I'm gonna get myself some alcohol and take a drink any time this man makes a tea pun
What about the quality or type of water? Should I use spring water, purified water, tap water? What about the type of milk? 2% , 1%, whole milk? Where should the milk come from? Cow? Almond? Pea?? We need more testing for the perfect cup
sooo, I'm making my tea in a Bosch coffee automat. using a refill capsule dedicated for only that purpose. getting hot water immediately, pressuring through the leaves in the capsule, boom perfect aromatic tea in mere seconds
Wait but what about comparing some good ol southern sweet tea?
off to make some tea rn
How my family makes tea, as Indians: 1 cup milk, 1 cup water, with 2 teaspoons of tea and sugar to taste - in a pot, brought to a boil and served piping hot in cups.
Now we need to know if it should be cereal first or milk?
2:56 I feel personally offended as a British person myself and want to cry
I find pouring the water directly onto flat bags fills it with air giving the leaves enough room to brew properly.
soo...chinese tea when
I'm not exactly a fan of how its "implied" a vast majority of americans make it the "tiktok" way(or similar), as shown in the video(that being with practically gallons of milk or whatever)  food theory is the channel I watch most, simply cause theres always tons of real data and proper real life fact checking that can/could be done even since it IS "just a joke/funny", its still what kicked off the whole video? and maybe that should be more properly addressed is all I'm saying💀 especially since it wasnt very clear with how much it was taken as "fact" or used as "example" rather, for a majority of the video :/  one last thing tho, it was never actually explained why you "shouldnt" heat up the water in the microwave as a non-tea drinker(bitter taste kills most foods for me😔) I dont quite understand fundamentally, if it heats up the water to the right temperature then theres no issue right?  at the end it was implied doing so would just burn your hands(nothing was even TESTED about the taste), but dude, just use glass? lmao glass doesnt absorb heat well directly from microwaves period, cause its GLASS and SEE-THROUGH and microwaves are just photons/electrons at a particular energy level I actually feel like I'm loosing my mind here with this one, microwaving tea/coffee shouldnt have ANY extra issues if its basically just water(I know milk would curdle, thats why you put it in after)  the rest here is just science mumbo, but-  before anyone argues for some reason, that "water is see through and so why does it get hot" or something its because of three things, that being density, heat capacity, and refraction/reflection water is fairly dense and so is more likely to have single molecules of itself be energized by the microwaves water is also a liquid whereas glass is a solid, the moving particles of the liquid will move around and transfer energy between each other as they interact with one another the faster particles are going, the faster the heat spreads out, and the faster particles are going the more chances they have to be hit by incoming microwaves, this is the same for cooling down in a fridge just with induction being the process of heat transfer(this is a REALLY simplified explanation for how heat capacity works, its also different for all liquids) lastly, once again water is a LIQUID, and glass is a SOLID, the WAY that these two things look CLEAR is very important when it comes to general physics glass is clear because its structure and material are both in a sweet spot that still allows MOST visible light to pass through, which is the most important part(tho many forms of light can still interact, especially with impurities inside or out) water is clear because its molecules are very "small" atomic weight-wise, and dont interact much with light in general but when it DOES its often just a slight reflection its pretty much the same reason why air is clear but smoke is opaque, not the full reason of course, light is complex but air is a fluid just like water is and so follow the same rules, unlike with solids
I've heard that British upper class people actually did pour in tea before milk because they had good china, but don't quote me on that.
We put milk in first in the olden days, current days you ALWAYS put the milk in last
Can you make a video on what is the best way to make tea middle eastern way
No ideal sweetener and amount?
I wonder if these are plant-based tea bags
As a Brit, I don't know a single person under the age of 70 that puts the milk in first. I think we've corrected for the better taste and the older generation were brainwashed to protect their parents crockery.
I'm from QLD, Australia and when I went to GA, it was weird seeing the U.S make teas.
Personally, I prefer a French Press for making my tea! It makes so much more of a difference!
I would like to see you guys compare british tea and indian masala chai
Why no milk being poured same time as tea??
It's interesting to hear them say the british tradition was milk first but all I ever hear is that milk first is sacrilidge. Also do they measure the amount of stirring of the tea?
7:15 "i just learned the word osmosis" -column fellow number🚫
But what about the sugar 🤔
the best temp for tea is slightly hot so it is soothing
I love how Stef just knew Tom was going to open the tea holder and had her hand read 😂
Is tea soup?
As a brit I know absolutely no-one that puts the milk in first
Also Turkey is the country who is the most one to drink tea.
As a true Brit I personally prefer to pour the boiling water, milk and tea straight into my mouth.  Best consumed that way.
Skiiiiiips!!!
13:40 to be honest I'm starting to hate tea with milk due to 2 reasons One being we don't usually use milk but powered milk (tea creamer)  my family use between 1-5 TEAspoons of it after realising tea was better than coffee I wanted it gave me the second reason Which is i didn't know the right amount even when milk is around it almost taste like milk  So you better show me how to add milk either full cream or not
At least rry to make tea the indian way
French press with no milk no sugar and no honey
When steph preemptively put her hand under the loose lead tea just waiting for him to drop it you could tell she raised a boy
You said "and no microwave" like it was obvious but you never did a comparative test. I don't see why boiling the water in the microwave or in a boiler should make any difference at all. The burning of the hand is just due to the mug being opaque to microwaves and heating like crazy instead of the water. But there are mugs that don't burn like that.
Huh never had milk in my tea Ya all I used was honey water and a bag of tea :/
im not taking advice from an american on my tea
16:49 Guy went from wheezing to looking straight like he was pulled by a string
S’bit funny innit.
"We needed someone British"
6 minutes 1/3 *half-and-half* (milk is for savages) 2 teaspoons brown sugar Giving you a middle finger
I remember the first time I saw a tea bag and I thought "There's no way the flavor can flow like this..."
I would like 1 variable. To cover the glass while steep the tea. I hear its a really big game changer
this is a crime to england
Something I think you missed at least in this video that I fully believe will make a difference - when it came to the milk testing, did you use a tea bag or the teapot? I believe that if you used a tea bag and did the milk first then the bag would brew at a lower temp, whereas if you used the pot to brew the tea and then poured that on top of the milk you would get a different result. It might be a matter of milk order should be determined by brew method.
Never heard of anybody adding milk to tea
I agree with MatPat tho. Best Milk in tea is 0/4 cups added. Thats the most tasTEA :D
I just leave my tea bag inside indefinitely and just refill the cup till the flavor runs out.
The best way to make tea is boiling water, then add the tea, then drink
Theory: cereal or milk first?
Sorry, I'm just looking at the fridge with the little art pieces that say "Dad" and "Oliver"
OMG 🫢 GUYS IF YOU USE A TEAPOT THE TEA CAN BE DRINKED SOONER!!! ALSO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 1 AND 3 MINUTES BREWED TEA!!! 💀
Tom, Steph, and Mat are the best example of when smart people get together and then immediately loose all their brain cells. It's great  Edit: it would be great to see this style of video again with other teas or even coffee/espresso
**Calmly drinks hot water in Asian**
I own one strawberry tea that has steeped SUPER bitter every time I make it. I’m excited to try these to see how it works. I want this tea to taste good so badly!
Steph: 3-4 cups a day Me: *laughs in British*
Finally someone who pronounces indian names  correctly
Sugar?
You said there are lots of teas. But no there is only one species of tea plant. its the growing region and the environment during and duration of oxidation.
Okay now make sun tea
Doesn't everyone wash their tea cups every time? *_glances over at tea cup in use for two weeks_*
Alright, I have my theory.   Everything strives to reach thermal equilibrium, or room temperature. Milk poured first hits the room temperature mug, warming the milk, even if only slightly. Pouring in the hot tea, which goes straight from hot kettle to milk, heats up the milk more quickly than it cools the tea, and hot milk spoils.   Alternatively, hot tea poured into a room temperature mug cools down, even if only slightly. The milk coming straight from its cold jug, cools off the tea faster than it warms up, lessening the spoilage I brought up earlier. The differences aren't dramatic, they're subtle. The theorists did spit the "milk first" tea out because it had curdled or anything like that, it was a subtle difference that turned out to be decisive. Perhaps the slight differences in what heats up and what cools down are enough to make that change in taste.   At least, that's what I figured was happening, that's why I always add cold dairy last to everything. Figured Mat would explain 🤷‍♂️
Uall still using tea bags ??
Matpat: pours three cups of milk into tea Me: *screams in Anglomania*
me who drinks tea every day:
Its curious that you considered the location of the milk as a variable but not the amount or lack of sugar and/or honey. Classic Food Theory
I'm glad that some people have truly realized Uncle iroh's teachings
*cackles in Southerner and gets out the sugar and ice*
It must be the sheer volume of water in the teapot vs. mug; everybody knows making ice in a tray using hot water will significantly solidify quicker than using cold. So, more hot water, faster cooling.
For why you put the milk second is because you actually start curdling the milk when you add hot water to milk, whereas adding cold milk into hot water does not cause the same effect. Always remember, Cold into Hot, never Hot into Cold.
You forgot about eastfrisian germans, we Drink more tea than brits, if I'm correct
another thing the internet teaches me that people just don't know iv been doing all this
As a southerner, this was a strange video. I completely forgot people put milk in tea.
Perfectly balanced
i like me some lipton
Milk alternatives?
Tbh as an Asian, I was about to gatekeep this. Though I’m miserable, I’m not gonna do it
Aint none of us actual brits since the 1990's used milk 1st, you should get excommunicated for that here.
tried this perfect tea with 2 teaspoons of sugar and man was it good
If that was the same glass mug that you used to fill the other vessels, then no wonder it was the hottest, because you pre-warmed it with several cups of boiling water already, almost like stoneware. Not sure if it was the same one or not, and I'm sure being insulated glass helped, but if it held the boiling water that was transferred to the other cups before being filled with the amount of water itsself, it would have taken on some of that heat and start at a hotter temp than the other mugs.
I dont even put any milk in my tea😅…. BECAUSE THATS THE CORRECT WAY!!
No, Matpat is correct for once. No milk. At this is from someone that would put milk as my second favorite beverage behind tea. Don't mix them, weirdos....
i only drink rooibos tea
Matpat forgot the type of milk ahahahaha
Since I drink quite often this will be of great use
I'm british and those people making tea was hard to watch
You don't wash the cup!
They keep saying to not use the microwave but they never tested if it actually tastes different
Fin.
Hey Matt, you forgot to test which kind of milk is best to use, ceramic tea pot vs metal tea pot, whether or not to use honey instead of or with sugar, which exact type of sugar is best, and exact ratios of water, tea leaves, milk, AND sweetener/s of choice. You're welcome. 😁 =^x^=
Try this again gongfu cha!
did anyone else notice that when Steph said 17:10  "pour the millk on top just plash it in there" the vary next scene has a contradiction where the the milk is on the bottom. this is not the only time ive seen this either there was yet another food theory video where they did the same thing. idk thought i should point that out in case this was not meant to be a thing.
I personally think such taste tests should be done without the taste testers knowing which tea cup is prepared in what manner.  Have someone off camera/not partaking in the taste keep record of what mug corresponds to what type.   Doing it the way you do does sorta lend some issues with bias and simply placebo or confirmation bias when testing.  *Edit:* The reason I bring this up is cause a study/experiment was done with some "experience wine taste testers" and they were served a bottle of cheap wine and a bottle of expensive wine. In the first test, the testers got to see what wine was what, and they all unanimously said the more expensive wine tasted better, had richer flavor, etc.  However, for the second test they moved the more expensive wine into the cheap bottle and vise-versa, without the testers knowing. The testers still unanimously said that the wine served in the expensive bottle (what they thought was the expensive wine, but was the cheap one) was better, had richer flavor, etc.   There's a reason blind taste tests are a thing as our other senses and expectations can skew results.
I already know the best cup of tea is Yorkshire tea
Wait Y'all put milk in tea?
With flat teabags I find it best to stir the bag
what about the INDIAN WAY....how was my country not involved. India was only there for 1 thing, you could've done more.
It’s hotter because you’re supposed to have your pot on the stove while steeping
"It's getting colder" Australians: I wish...
In terms of the order you should add your milk there is the issue of the fact that milk begins to curdle at 82° while water boils at 100°. So if you add the milk in second it gives the water time to cool down reducing the chance of having a more sower tasting tea. Also just heating your milk too quickly can make it start to curdle even if it does not yet begin to boil.
"Just rinse them out" I've never felt that the theory channels were this relatable.
What about types of sweetener in tea, like sugar blocks, honey, or sweetners? I would usually have honey with mine but I’m curious to what y’all think
what about different types of milk???
Tea is Indian made . That is the best Period.
‘We need someone *BRITISH* ‘
This works with any mugs I have but try it at your own risk, my tea goes a little like this:  -Fill the mug with hot water from a kettle almost to the top. -When putting in a teabag it should raise the water level right to the brim. -After removing the teabag, refill the cup to the brim with milk. -Stir clockwise or counter clockwise fast enough to make a noticeable dip in the middle of the tea, then begin stirring the opposite direction to stop the water flowing around the mug.  This is how I have made tea for multiple decades and I have never had complaints, only a few moments of praise. My mother is cannot indulge in dairy, so this supposedly works with non-dairy milk alternatives however, she could just be too nice to tell me if something's off.
Excellent. Now it's time for this but coffee.
Then me who brews the tea for about 7mins, squeezes the bag, then about 5-10ml milk and be like 'hmmm could of brewed it for longer'. Btw I feel like they should of tested tea bag squeezing and taking the bag out before and after adding the milk
I don't know why but we don't put milk in tea in france, only hot water and thé bag
noone in my family has ever put milk in our tea. just some honey.
in india we boil the tea leaves with milk no water at all
6:39
I'm confused do you think putting milk in first is a British thing? Like we'd hang people who do that if it were legal
Wait… you guys put milk first?
@foodtheory So as you haven't said why putting milk in after is important I would like to jump on that as I am British and have always been taught top finish with the milk as boiling water if not given time to cool slightly will burn the milk as such even though it's not scientific I usually count to 20 before pouring the milk in
Am I weird? I really enjoy the smell of tea but I really despise the taste
13:38 As a heavy tea drinker I agree Matpat
the sheer discomfort he had saying milk after is hilarious
...
Steph, reuse your mugs!
Im british
Finally, someone else whom doesn’t put milk in their tea.
Make a video about how and why India and Britain are so close with tea.
Anyone realize how much mat could like manipulate the economy? Like the paper flat bag market is going to plummet and the pyramid shaped bags will have a booming market
Here’s how I do mine I boil my water , put my sugar in my cup and the tea bag , pour the boil water in the tea and wait like 3 mins take it out then put my creamer in 🤤 boom and there you have it Bree’s Tea 😂❤ I don’t like my tea bag sitting too long and I don’t like milk in my tea
Nooooo! You need the tea leaves to swish around! Get two teapots and then pour them from one of the other through a sift after brewing!
you didn't check if some combinations are better, like maybe putting milk in first changes the best amount of milk to put in and maybe that's better than the best amount for milk last
Well indian tea exists
wha... you add milk?
I hate when people say british drink the most tea. Like search it up if you want but its China and Turkey.
In Australia we do sugar as well, usually 1 to 2 teaspoons
6:28 ... i swear i watched it a hundred times! *ded*
Good thing im not briish
21:18 - Tea Tea F. N.
Great video, but I want to see the sequel: How to make the best cup of _Green_ Tea.
This is probably heresy, but my favorite tea has sugar, no milk, and gets steeped for like 3 hours until I finish drinking it.  I also wiggle the bag around during the first minute and squeeze it out at the end to get all the flavor.
i think as an asian who loves making teh c for my family this makes me all sorts of happy
I am sorry but Hong Kong style milk tea is the best milk tea Dont@me
Tom was getting too friendly with Stephanie. Stay in your lane Son.
I'm glad at least someone shares my opinions on milk in tea. Thank you Matt Patt!
My British friend is going to be mad at MatPat if she sees this.
The Chinese in me is screaming at all that milk
3-4 cups a day? That's rookie numbers.
Not gunna lie, but at 17:00 minutes when Steph tells you how to make tea, that is how everyone already makes tea here in England 🤣🤣🤣 so thank you for confirming that the British way is the right way 🇬🇧🇬🇧
As a Texan, what confuses me here is why they are boiling the water. Just pour your water into a pitcher, put some ice cubes in that bad boy, and let it cool in the fridge while steeping for some lovely chill tea adding sugar at your preference.
16:44 only fools do it milk first guys, it won't brew properly with milk first
Blasphemy! Loose leaf is always superior to tea bag.
2:05 Tom finally got something to do that wasn't FNAF related! Good on you for keeping your promises, Mat 👍
No milk, Yorkshire tea. That is good tea!
You should of compared milk types for the milk poured like almond milk, normal dairy milk and other milk alternatives (also some interesting milk types like chocolate milk)
I don’t drink tea I drink Lipton :) I’m 9…..
In the most common chinese tea method we use loose leaves only and need to rinse it with hot water before brewing 😂
How does no one know the difference between milk first instead of top makes it taste diff and I’m South Africa.
Im like steph but 3 to 5 cups a day
I would be very curious to see this tested on Yorkshire tea
The amount of cup sharing will seep into my nightmares like tannin staining my insides. 😰
12:12 - But that's just a theory - a FILM theory.
This man's just few steps away from unofficially committing an act of war upon those Brits.
Yorkshire breakfast tea forever
Fun fact: In Poland a lot of people use a simple glass for tea or coffee. They have special handles that you can buy and put the glas in it, so you don't burn your hands.
You know as a Brit I had an unholy urge to wake up at 5am to watch this
Mat you GOTTA compare British tea to Chinese tea now.
Me, an Asian, seeing this video: *my people call me*
You should also factor in the specialty tea cups and specialty tea pots. Also you should see how many Native Americans drink tea and a lot of us myself including drink our tea with either or both Sugar and Honey. I picked up a tea cup that was specifically made for tea. And I also picked up a specifically made tea kettle with a steeper built inside. I hope you see this Matpat.
Me drinking tea and watching this episode: Intearesting...
Certain tea should only be steeped at certain temperatures or it gets bitter! Some tea should never even be in boiling water. You guys should add a temperature factor to this 😉
What about the star trek tumblenot cup?
this reminds me of "50 Tea Recipes from the Duchess" for some apparent reason
Am I the only one wondering if 1%, 2%, or whole milk will make a difference?
This is basically the Hyderabadi method of making tea
If you really think about it, it’s obvious that poring in milk first is better because putting the cold milk on the warm tea would create a convection current and make “self stirring tea” and I believe the reason the tea pot is hotter is because of the smaller open surface area, in a mug the entire top is open where in a pot only that little hole is there to let the heat out and in the pot the opening is to the side rather than above the liquid making it harder to let out heat.
it goes water in kettle boil sugar in  cup tea bag in cup water milk
Your voice is so nice 😌
Oh my I straight away liked the vid no joke when Mat said he prefers no milk I do as well but sometimes I put sooooo little that It was ridiculous when I heard what the US did (am from the UK btw).
I don't care if the puns were terrible, I will still laugh at them because I love jokes and puns, thank you for that MatPat.
If it helps make you feel better MatPat no one I know likes milk in tea and I work at an old folks home where they drink a lot of tea.
"In cooking the Holy Tea Cup of Antioch, First shalt thou put the Tea into boiling water. Then, of minutes shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out! Once the minute three, being the third minute, be reached, then removest thou thy Tea from thy Holy Tea Cup of Antioch and addeth thy Milk at thy pleasure, unless thy pleasure is that of devilish Tik Tok nature, in which case thy shall be snuffed."
so what if u dont want to add milk to your tea?
Hope they dont colonise this channel 😳
Hot water and a tea bag in a mug, nothing else is needed.
4-5 cups a day is rookie numbers  Should have added a paper cup... For the worse case scenario
Eh, this theory is just not my cup of tea.
Americans ruin everything, look at the pizza there
Milk belongs in tea? This man cant even open a bag and he is "british judge" of the episode? And then the sugar. Ah come on... This must be disqualified.
What a nice TEAorie
tea is without milk. change my mind
Every comment it TEArific. You're welcome. I almost forgot one more pun but I  am not going to say it because it would be TEArifying if you heard it.
@#MatPat @#Steph   Charleston Tea Plantation.  Charleston, SC.  Trust me...  better than EVERY tea from anywhere else in the world.
Aren't you supposed to wait 2 minutes after pouring tea then milk??   Didn't see that part tested....
i needed this video thanks matpat!
there is only one way to make a good cup of tea matpat ill sow you but i just need a little time to MuRdEr that insane women
I must have missed the part of the episode where they cool it down and serve it over ice like we do here in the south...😆  I've tried hot tea several ways and absolutely cannot stand it!  And putting milk in tea is just plain wrong. 😝
Me normally: Oh yeah, Matpat is my favorite youtuber, he's pretty chill  Me after Matpat says he doesn't like milk in his tea: I WILL WATCH TIL THE DAY I DIE Love you mat lol <3
1. I literally had two cups of tea today (which is not an everyday occurrence) so the fact that I just watched Food Theories current most recent video and IT'S about tea just delights me with the timing haha, I honestly find it funny.  2. I get major sibling vibes from Steph and Tom together and it is so funny to watch 🤣🤣🤣  3. "We needed someone *British*" Is so funny to me too rofl! I just wasn't expecting that line until I saw the silhouette and was preparing for something of that nature but the "We needed someone *British*" Is just so funny to me!
The only thing the British Parliament has agreed on over the last 12 years was sanctions against that microwave TeaTok lady. :|
What about the type of milk just the one you like or is there just a best one for it?
Bri'ish.
“Wow wow wow” Did Steph quote Pitch Meeting?
It’s like in the hello puppet theory… you said “that’s none of my business” in the title, just like you did in the hello puppets theory (like I said lol) and what I’m saying here is about the title picture with the muppets/Kermit the frog.
LIQUID THEORY
0:14 no, the days are getting shorter 😂😂
Did I miss where you tried skim, 2%, or whole milk?
Great video, enjoying a nice cup of tea (green tea, so no milk) while watching. One thing, though. Isn't "1 part milk for every 4 parts tea" 1/5, not 1/4? Or well, the other way around, I suppose. The text says 1/4, so it would be 3 parts tea and 1 part milk, making 4 "parts" total? Probably just a small speaking error, but still, that is the sort of stuff that trips up a fair amount of amateur bakers too.
I go through 3 cups of tea a day so yes mugs are a must
The oldest tea of all is actually from China since 8000 years ago, and it would be the best if you could hire one from that country...... But hopefully you'll be able to get interviewed by them. 🫖🍵(Or meee😁😂)
Matpat, come on tea is not British or maybe it is but the most people who drink tea is in asia, like turkey, iran, india. God sake in iran we have our own tea gardens?. Idk what its called
As a brit I love this and you missed the sweetners variable ... and milk never goes in first 🤣
I still don’t get people drinking milk in tea
They got a British guy instead of a Chinese or Indian person? Huh???
Now I want a collabe with mythical kitchen. Seeing Josh and Matpat figure out food myths
This channel just continues to get worse every week.
As someone who lives in Scotland and is Scottish were the he'll is the sugar we have always added sugar matpat got it rong for ones
NO MILK IN TEA GANG HEREEEE🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ hahahhah
What kind of milk are you using whole almond 1% or 2%
Ice tea is better
Haha, I didn't know people put milk on tea until today
imagine using milk in tea
Haven't finished watching yet but Matt is right on this. The optimal and correct amount of milk in tea is 0.00ml. Anything more is flavouring to taste.
Thank you very much for this information! I will definitely start making my tea this way now.:)
But in Australia it's the opposite
I loved this episode!! I’m not British, but I’ve drunk tea British-style since I was a little kid, and when it comes to milk I usually judge by color rather than amount—the best, most magical cup to tea is a burnt-orange color. It’s extremely hard for me to pull off, unfortunately, I usually have to have a certain mug, catch the teapot at the right time while it’s steeping, splash in the right amount of milk…it only happens once in a blue moon. Also, about the teapot—someone introduce MatPat to tea cozies! Teapots generally cool off quickly, so you just pop a tea cozy over the pot and it stays hot for hours
do you guys not have sugar in your tea-
4:10 You actually don't want the water to boil. 90-93°C is the perfect temperatures.
The best tea is CHAI.. noone can change my mind 🤷🏽‍♀️
Good teary
5:32 true er words have never been spoken XD
Bring in a pun counter   And a tea coubter
Oh come now. Everyone knows you can't make proper tea if you don't jiggle the bag.
I drink 8-9 cups of tea a day
You silly American let my tea alone!
I once wanted to try milk in tea and then I saw lemon juice in the fridge and put in both (i was like 14, don't judge OK?).  Don't do that, the milk turned sour, I wasted a whole cup
Milk in tea? I prefer two drops of lemon juice  if anything.
It's always cool too remember that people figured some of this stuff out hundreds of years ago. But some were either lost to time (romans steam power) or some corporate scumbag wanted to reinvent the wheel for profit (elan musk).
No sugar??? That’s just soup……
Did Shen start making Food Theories?
when do you put the milk in? like .. immediately? seems like another variable to me ..
I MISHEARD! 26 ML OF MILK NOT 26 LITERS, THERES MILK EVERYWHERE
Ive never heard of putting milk in tea, sounds gross.
Please please please please please try Turkish way of making tea! Pleaaaasseeeee
I love tea my family loves tea. My great grandpa made the best lose leaf tea ever luckily my mum got the recipe cause omg it's sooo good
No no u put in mostly water then microwave then pit in the tea bag then u stir in a little sugar and if you want, a splash of milk
The only way to drink tea is ice cold and loaded with sugar!
I do like my tea a little sweet
As a tea enthusiast, I agree with them on everything but few and it's not mentioned in the video, First, the water's salinity differers maybe the most. Second, boiling the water in a pot for 1 min is going to make a remarkable difference. Finally, loose tea floating in a pot after boiling is just amazing.  And in the end, I enjoyed the video, and it made me think of remaking the IKEA circular tea filter into a pyramidal shape, Thanks for the video.
Rage Chinese : tea with milk is called milk tea  not TEA(X  tbh, I only know now that tradition  English tea has milk
**Me watching the video** wait you guys put milk in tea?!
Try the Indian way of tea
USA: Why do you put milk in this, it needs sugar. UK: Nonsensical laugh 😃
I was wondering if the temperature of the water effects the tea..
How bold of you to assume they are independent!
Absolutely LOVED this one! #leafSoupForDaWin #NeedsSomeSugarTho 🤣
3-4 cups a day ? Pffffft, step up your game Steph, that's a rookie number.
No, no, matpat is objectively correct. The best tea is milk-less. We aren't drinking boba here
I am currently drinking Rooibos tea and this is the perfect episode of Food Theory for today.
I came for tea suggestions, I left with the idea of some sort of tea vessel yokai that endlessly reproduces more mugs.
You can’t tell us British what to do, isn’t that right Wallace and gromit
Tea puns on point.
15:45 Someone needs to make a meme out of this
Great video! I’m surprised you didn’t test pouring water over the tea vs dipping the tea after pouring. That’s one of the main tea debates I’ve known of.
‚Warm leaf water‘   …is it leaf soup?
Love how Steph's mom instincts kicked in to catch the tea leaves
Turkish people actually drink more tea per year the Brit’s are like 4’th
"Warm leaf water"!? Never would I think I'd hear such a horrible thing in my life!
Nah nah, in aus just go outside, grab a handful of gum leaves, put ‘em in the billy can and boil em. But don’t forget to swing the billy can around and over your head to get the leaves to the bottom of the pot. Boom, tea 👍🏻
Matpat is correct, the best part of tea is not having milk in it, for me I just love my tea with nothing except sugar it's nice
Funny, where i live we dont put milk into tea, just water and honey for taste
"we've been trying to sprout that avocado for 5 weeks" LOL
why am I convinced the secret 4th channel is gonna be meme theory
why you call "tea" but use milk? Also what's the difference between milk tea with "tea" that use milk???? ALSO don't mad at me because when i am making tea I don't use milk but sugar
Flat tea bags expand when you put the tea bag into the microwave with the water
Oh Boy! A new episode of Myth Munchers!! ........wait a second
I guess any sugar needed will be handled by the milk added?? Never had milk tea before.
This is all well and good, but what about green tea? Surely that has different needs for brewing the perfect cup, being much different than that British stuff.
Okay. These tea puns are pretty good. You should claim or copyright such levels of "proper-tea" jokes
Matt: you make the British tea  Brit: how do you own the tea bag?   Yup! Gonna be legit! Duh you dumb brit. You don't open it, just toss it in the harbor!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Hold on are people adding milk to their tea?
Hm, this one was very interesting.
You guys should have also tested "kulhad" cup
Seriously?? You brought in a BRITISH person as the “tea expert”?? Wow.
Funfact: The UK only drink 201 L per person in a year, East Frisia in north-west Germany drinks around 300 L per person/year
Accualy Turkey is the Nation with the Most tea Drinked by person
Southern tea is better better than british
but ... xmas is in the summer .. lol.
Loved the episode, tea is literally my life. HOWEVER, I argue that the best cup of tea is served out of a tall ceramic cup with a removable ceramic lid. Keeps the heat in, looks nice, doesn’t burn your hand, and you can still sip from it. Need I say more?
My best guess for why milk first vs milk on top makes a difference is temperature. It's possible that the tea is still hot enough to cause the milk to start to curdle if you put the milk in first, where as if you put the milk in after you've poured the tea it has had a chance to cool a bit, possibly just enough to drop below the curdling point of the milk.
I'd like to suggest milk first but when the tea is coming from a tea pot.  Mmm Mmm
In Germany, we just offer you a beer. It's our cuppa.
0:32 me a turkish person:pathetic
i revoke mr british mans britishness, not once did he complain about the lack of an electric kettle over the pond
I'm going to make tea the wrong way on purpose and post it on the Internet on purpose to start a making national food wrong war
I’ve been trying to get Into tea making more and this vid just helped so much ! I like green and chai the most I’ll try what I saw here and see how that effects it!!!!
They live in North carolina and they didn't touch the "southern us, Iced sweet tea?" Which I'm sure is an abomination to a looooooot of people.
I love tea, and while a lot of this just revolves around personal preference, this gives everyone the opportunity to have the perfect brew regardless. Now I can finally understand the conception with the matter of fact that I was doing tea correctly all my life and everyone else is crazy!
Glad to see some Twinings tea there. 🫖☕
Delicious tea? Or deadly poison?
- It's also because loose leaf often uses whole uncut leaves. The whole leaves have less surface area. Bags usually have tea dust. - Unless you're making a cold sugary drink, no milk in tea. - You may want to experiment with frothed milk. - Gong Fu Tea method FTW.
*Laughs in COFFEE* ...that poor milk though! It did not deserve to wasted on that hot leaf water.
3-4 cups a day that's rookie numbers i drink 5-6 a day
Okay, but what kind of milk is best? Skim, 1%, 2%, VitD/Whole, Half&Half, Light Cream, Heavy Cream, or powdered milk dissolved directly into the tea?
0:12 Except if You're in Australia PS love tea
atleast in india , its 2 : 1 ratio of water to milk , sometimes even like milk heavey ones , so its 1:1 milk to water ,
Best way as a American to drink British tea  is with salt water
In my family we just have a whole jug of tea ready everyday. Sometimes two.
Dont tell em about Texas sweet iced tea.
It's always the same people making the US look insane 😭
Gonna make some British folks angry. I use a coffee maker to make tea.
I have literally never put milk into my tea and I love tea. I don't even want to try.
What about sugar
With the teapot vs pyramid: another reason the temperature could be different is that the hot tea was poured from one vessel to another. That allows it to go through the cooler air and then land in the mug, which is a lower temperature than the teapot. Some of the heat would leave the tea in the process to the air and to the mug.
Was about to make a comment about the water temperature since most people use boiling water but you actually have specific temps for specific tea until it was mentioned I will save my British anger for now
Bruh like 1/3 of my tea is milk
We all know that milk never comes first. Think of the cereals.
No milk
Objectively, the best way to prepare tea is the Boston method, disposed of
Having milk in your tea is disgusting
Mat Pat is such a liar, those cups at 6:38 are NOT identical, one has a M, an A and an S this is a joke, I love your vids
Meanwhile me being weird in this cold weather: "I kinda want Ice cream."
I've heard that putting the milk in first means the hot tea won't scald the milk. In fact, I think I read it in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and you can't get more British than that.🇬🇧
Ok do sweet tea next
I am from Assam🇮🇳 and tea here is literally the best in the world
the not one and not five but three thing reminds me of monty python and the holy grail's holy hand grenade.
Have you tried Indian way of making tea. It's almost like going into a war in the kitchen. 😂😂😂 I am Indian, so you know.
i feel you mat, i don't like milk in tea either.
Masala chai is the best tea
Other comments: saying something about tea  Me, an Indian that has fallen for MatPat’s big brain trick: The pronunciation of “Assam” was **_chef’s kiss_**
"Warm Leaf Water" is funny because it's accurate.  Also I have never even heard of anyone putting milk in their tea until this video.
I prefer the 5 minute tea personally. I like the bitter aftertaste with the right amount of sugar.
Fun fact: Root Beer is technically tea, and its the only tea I like.
I was actually anxious there wouldn't be a "Food TEA-ry" pun coming along!
PG Tips (a popular British brand of tea) have been using pyramid bags for years, and currently they're my favourite bag. Though I'm currently enjoying loose leaf  from a brand I could not remember what it was.
The vessel section, you preheated the glass mug by using it as your measuring cup.  Pouring water into the china cup was sloppy and would have experienced evaporative cooling.  You also didn't debunk microwaving the water vs. a traditional kettle.  Heat the water in the microwave and then pour it into the teapot just as you would from a kettle.  You had so many confounds in your one mug of microwaved water for tea that there's no way to draw any conclusion from it other than that specific combination of factors was disliked by all three narrow palates.
you use milk in your tea?
I totally agree with matpat, tea without milk is the best unless when i feel like drinking milk tea
I’m pausing the video to say whatever electric kettle Stef uses, I’m going to buy one cus I’ve been wanting one forever but don’t know which brand to trust. I trust Stef.
How I make tea : take a cup fill it up and boil it in a pot put the tea bag in the pot and wait 4 minutes meanwhile put powdered milk and a half spoon of sugar  in the cup then when the tea done pour the tea in the cup and mix it with a spoon (this recipe is for one person)
I too drink 3-4 cups of tea a day, so she's not alone.
Matpat is RIGHT! Best milk=NO milk
Man I may get a lot of hate for this, but as someone with a dull sense of taste I don't ever remove the tea bag from my mug. It's always a little too watery otherwise.
I love tea, but never with milk and I leave my leaves in too make it more bitter.
Why do they have mugs spelling “Sam”?
Can you make a theory if a doll is the same as a figure? me and my friend got in a fight about it. I think that a doll is a figure but she thinks there different. Like isn’t a doll a type of figure??
"Why is the handle so hot?!?!"  Because you're a moron and had a wet handle when you put the mug into the microwave.  If your handle were dry, it wouldn't get hot.  See, here's how microwaves work:  They excite water molecules causing them to absorb energy.  You don't actually cook food in the microwave but rather excite the water molecules that are already in there.  The more you know, I guess!
Should have made them blind taste microwave water and kettle water teas. I doubt anyone could tell the difference
Down here in South Africa one of the most prominent tea's is "Rooi Bos"  Kinda wish to see how Matt pronounces it
I shall continue to spit in the face of England and make my sweet tea in the most blasphemous way possible.  Microwaved, steeped for an hour with a flat bag, and loaded with sugar.  Because freedom is sweet. 😎
This is all wrong, all of the premises.  If you start with a tea bag you might as well use instant coffee powder.  Microwaving water is wrong, not that it matters with tea of that quality.  Loose leaf, higher quality versions are something else.  Assuming that the average British person knows a lot about tea because they drink it frequently is like calling a redneck an experienced beer enthusiast for drinking a 12 pack of Milwaukee's Best Light every day.
About science and  basic term is wrong. Don't expect much for experiments. Any way warm water (kettle), tea bag in warm water (to taste) normally 3 mintues (more a strongertaste). Remove tea bag unless using tea pot. Add milk (if wanted or to taste). Also add sugar as before. Stir done. Forgot tea cups and  mugs are different sizes. A tea cup is alot smaller. The UK guy should of known this as all English tea drinker should. That tea cup is not a normal tea cup ( maybe for USA but not UK).
Milk in tea always sounded gross and I thought it was a joke. Apparently it's actually a thing.
I have to correct all these people that say adding milk is the way to do it. My Southern Bell grandmother added CREAM to her tea. There was actually a big argument about it among the family when I was a kid. It's entertaining to look back on, now, LOL.
Ive only met a couple of people in England that put milk in first and it always resulted in them being named and shamed at some point lol! Milk first with coffee, is a debate that is common here, but with tea the majority of us go milk 2nd!   Also looks like you forgot about the great stirring direction debate and if/how that would effect teabags shape and steeping time!!  If you crack out a teaspoon and stir while it steeps, then you are increasing the movement of tea leaves, not only does this give flat teabags a chance, but also improves rate of osmosis and decreasing the amount of steeping time necessary. As for stirring I opt for roughly 6 fast swirls in each direction , but some people swear you only go clockwise, while others insist on counterclockwise!  Im a little surprised you didn’t go into science of why water first it superior!! We all know heat increases the amount of movement in molecules, so when you combine tea and hot water it increases reaction and improved steeping. By adding refrigerated milk first, you are reducing the max temperature the tealeaves/bag will be exposed too.  Hopefully that makes sense.l.lI’m rubbish at explaining this stuff lol!
3-4 cups a day? Them's rookie numbers.  In all seriousness while I am English I don't drink that much tea, but I know people who drink tea almost exclusively as their form of fluid intake.
Um, iced tea?  Where’s the experiment for that one?  Did you forget it in the avocado water?  Also, can you make avocado leaf tea?  Also, what is your favorite color of Lego Mug Element?  I need to go buy some rare Lego Mug Element colors…..  goodbye.
12:30 NGL I just leave my tea bags in my mug until I’m done drinking my tea or there no longer touching the water
No one I know has EVER done milk first in England. That’s just wrong.
You fools forget the sweet iced tea  Forget the measurements here is how u do it: Heat water unit hot in the sink Pour sugar for about 5 - 10 seconds Pour glass with Ice Place the rest in the fridge
I'm sorry, but I will never make my tea with milk. I hate milk and I would never add it into my hot water. I don't care if anyone has an issue with the way they did it on TikTok, I don't drink tea enough to do anything more than heating my water in the microwave. Sorry not sorry.
Huh the "perfect way" is exactly the way everyone I know already does it here in australia
I love how the theorists are proving so many TikToks wrong !!!
As a Persian seeing milk in tea burned my soul
Tom letting the intrusive thoughts win
I don't put milk in my tea I just use lemon and sugar and see some times honey
The next video for Steph is reviewing the tea  from different regions of the world or is that too controversial.
Watching this while drinking my first cup of tea of the day
At about 18:18 the traffic t highlighted on screen does not match at all what he’s saying. Screen says something about thin cup lip being this for easy drinking, he talks about cup insulation though.   (Half way through writing this I realized it could low key be about an ARG I love the theorist channels)
They forgot to science out the water temperature. People often say 90ºC is the best to avoid burning the leaves, but would 80º, 70º or 76.543ºC work even better? I guess I'll never know it now
Someone call the spiffing brit lol.
I prefer looseleaf over the pyramid bags not as a matter of taste, but as a matter of waste. Most of those pyramid tea bags are made of plastic fibers. :(
Tea gives me life!!!!!!!
they keep dunking on microwaved water but never test if it makes a difference, and i dont see how it could the waters getting boiled either way SO UNTIL I SEE OTHERWISE I AM USING THE MICROWAVE FOR ALL MY TEA.
Aren't you supposed to put sugar into tea, or have I been doing it wrong past 5 years of my life
What’s better for you as a over all, leaf water tea or powdered leaf water tea?
The perfect cup of tea is the good ol southern sweeeeeet brotha!
I actually agree with mat that milk doesn’t belong in tea.
"How much milk should you add?" Me: NONE!!!! Thank you MatPat 🤣🤣🤣 If you're gonna put ANYTHING in, it's gonna be honey.
Iroh would be very disappointed hearing it called warm leaf water
Sorry, but coffee is just tea. Same idea. It's bean water rather than leaf water.  How do you wash a teapot? Cleaning the spout seems hard.
I actually DON'T like tea myself, or coffee for that matter, my warm drink of choice happens to be of my favourite soup, plus not everyone adds milk and/or sugar to their tea and/or coffee
Who puts milk in tea I know who a fiend thats who
6:28 Steph with the spidey reflexes
Cool video, but I’ll stick to Chinese gongfu tea making
“BOSTON TEA PARTY SUMMARIZED” IM SOBBING
why not test microwave vs kettle tho? cause I know some people who say there's no difference or that they prefer the microwave, plus it's not always possible to use kettles/hot plates for the water
I'd love to see you repeat this with other tea preparation methods, maybe not the ceremonial ones though
I like tea and coffee but  I’m not making the tick tick milk tea lol
I'd love to see you repeat this with other tea preparation methods, maybe not the ceremonial ones though
…. Your tea is wrong.😢 my tea is matcha the only correct tea lmao
I'm with MatPat... I drink tea (usually WAY overbrewed), but NO MILK EVER.
this is FoodTeaRY
haven't we learned from cereal already that milk doesn't come first?
you missed the opportunity to say "bone apple tea" at the end and I'm mildly disappointed.
But.....steep at what temperature......WHAT TEMPERATURE DO WE STEEP AT FOR 3 MINUTES MATPAT?!
all these tea puns reminds me of shen from bluechair.
This episode was *tea* ming with puns and I hate it
There is something wrong/funny with Matpat.
"How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?" - Uncle Iroh in response to MatPat at 0:56
Now, we need an optimal coffee theory!
Matt is correct. The best tea is with NO MILK. 👏👏
American tea is made by taking boxes of tea and throwing them in the harbor and leaving them there for 2 weeks to steep.
Must be a southerner thing
What kind of milk
Best milk, no milk.
Basically this entire experiment "This isn't gonna do anything" 3 minutes later "Oml they're different-"
When I make tea i use about 1/4 - 1/3 of whatever cup I use for half and half, and I will add milk powder for extra milky flavor. Also tea bag first then water then milk powder then milk.
Uncle: this tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!  Zuko: Uncle, all tea is just hot leaf juice
Seeing Skip made me think, why don’t we have a Skip plus. He is a founding member of gtlive after all. We have a peepacho (peepatwo) plush, we should really have a Skip one.
Now I wanna try some tea heheh, and this is another informative video on Food "Tea"ory.
Mas
Food Tea-ory
Talking about hot drinks, I've always wondered, if you do milk:coffee-6:4 would wake you up or if the warm milk will override the caffeine and make you sleepy, I've done it after dinner and slept well
Next question! How many sugar cubes???
Never tried milk in tea. Usually just add sugar to mine.
And here I am drinking chocolate milk as I watch Matpat talk about tea for 20 minutes straight
Matpat: So the final possible variable that we can think up here is delivery vessel. Me: What about best type of sweetener and ideal amount?
And now onto the next food theory, which country has the method of making tea. Will the British win? Or will the be beaten by Asian countries like China, Japan? And what about India? Or perhaps Morocco? Sri Lanka? Turkey? Argentina? Russia? Can Kenya beat them all? Stay tune if Matt Patt ever read this.
To start the correct answer for if milk goes is tea is no. But if you are going to put dairy into tea, I find best is sweetened condensed milk.
Seeing them react to that tik tok tea video made my day  I knew it would be a riot but it was better than I could have hoped <3 Edit: quick note that might make people angry, but… I very rarely get mad about bitter tea. I’ll drink tea that’s become so bitter it puckers my mouth, but maybe that’s where the “coffee” perspective comes in to me? I hate coffee. I hate how bitter it is, I hate the flavor, but I’ll drink it once in a blue moon when I need caffeine, and I think that’s how I am with overstepped tea? I’ll usually drink that hella bitter tea because I need caffeine and it’s not so bitter (like coffee) that it disagrees with me
Okay so as a Brit (leaving out the fact that i'm also Indian and theres a way for us to make Indian tea plus you can also make actual milk tea without water too) i basically do all the optimal methods of making tea stated in this video.  BUT!  I will hold my hands up - there was a period  back in my young teen life where I used to put milk in first because I was trying to be more efficient with my time by putting the milk sugar and the teabag in whilst the kettle boiled (don't worry i learnt my mistake lol).  Now though, because I have a huge mug and i'm just lazy, I tend to just leave my good ol' PG tips teabag in my mug to steep as i drink because why not (p.s the 'english breakfast' rectangle-ish teagbags are whack and do NOT represent english tea at all lol).
Never drank milk tea, I know it's popular nowadays but it's weird to think putting milk in my tea lol
boil water in a kettle. tea bag in cup, pour in hot water, up to the bottom of the top joint of the handle. steep to desired strength. dont squeeze, but shake teabag to get excess flavor out. add milk as desired, for me, to the top of the top joint of handle. stir with teaspoon until it no longer looks cloudy. wait a few minutes, then drink.
we need a coffee version of this video!!!!!!!
As a British person this video is not ruining my tea experience
how come nobody told me tea had milk in it?!
Im so high that when he said leaves from Asia I literally thought he meant weed
sorry but who puts milk in tea? tried it once and it tasted much worse.
Matpat: which is the best way to make tea Me with my milk: ‘interesting’
Tea in your favorite mug taste better because you like it better. Its basic science.
you didn't test paper cup or thermos tho
watching this while chugging down a cup of tea
Is it weird that this is the second YouTube video I’ve watched about milk first or last in tea when I don’t put milk in my tea at all? Nah.  Here’s the first for the curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCuaWqhVvIc&t=567s
But like... The type of milk
I prefer my tea without milk, but that's due to lactose intolerance.  There are some teas that absolutely have to have milk to be good, and for those, I use soy or coconut milk.
Coffee episode 2.0. Tea = soup.
Wait I’m in South Africa and I’m confused what tea is native to South Africa
The best tea is made in the southern United States is served cold and gives you diabetes.
The Country consuming the most Tea is Turkey...and they drink it without milk... Much fun with Part2 MatPat 😂
I agree with Matt, no milk. I want pure tea flavor.
If you want good tea go to Pakistan and India 🇵🇰🇮🇳 where it's made by hand by vendors in the road
India: You missed sugar, ginger and cardamom.
Yes but what type of milk   ?
Meanwhile tea connoisseurs and old people from the birthplace of tea in China: you put milk in your tea?!!!!! ☠️☠️☠️☠️
4:37 Why does MatPat sound like Mario here 😂😭
I'm pretty sure the amount of sugar is preferential, but when do you add it? Does the type of milk affect the taste as well?
Dont call tea hot leaf juice or face the wrath of Iroh lmao..
milk does not belong in tea
Seeing the title and the first few minutes had me ready to be mad as a tea crazed person but I’m sooo glad it turned out the way it did.   NEVER put your milk in first, steep your tea for the correct amount of time and the milk amount is a personal choice.
So... How did you  figure out the optimal temperature? Is it written somewhere?
This channel put the phrase "There is no bad question" to the test
Which British tea are we talking about? Earl Grey, Lady Grey, English Breakfast,  Yorkshire.....etc
yknow whats funny? i never put milk in my tea. sue me brits
I don’t put milk in my tea. 😮 I have something in common with MatPat?!
Hot leaf juice.
The fact I got a t mobile ad on a video about tea cracked me up
More overthinking necessary. We know that 3 minutes is better than 1, but what about 2 minutes? 4 minutes? Same with the milk; keep removing milk by 10ml until it tastes too watery, then keep adding milk by 10 ml until it tastes to milky. You'd need 21 cups of tea to determine the even-more-precise numbers. Once you pick the best option from below, you can move up and down by 5 ml milk to get it to the nearest teaspoon (and let's be real- you're not going to be more precise than that).  1:30 + 15 ml 2:00 + 15 ml 2:30 + 15 ml 3:00 + 15 ml 3:30 + 15 ml 4:00 + 15 ml 4:30 + 15 ml 1:30 + 25 ml 2:00 + 25 ml 2:30 + 25 ml 3:00 + 25 ml 3:30 + 25 ml 4:00 + 25 ml 4:30 + 25 ml 1:30 + 15 ml 2:00 + 35 ml 2:30 + 35 ml 3:00 + 35 ml 3:30 + 35 ml 4:00 + 35 ml 4:30 + 35 ml
I really want some tea now...
Steph..those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers up.   Just kidding. My neurologist hates me.
I don't drink tea and thar vid offended me
As an American it's good to know I'm mostly correct in what I'm doing. However, I'm going to stick with my mug over a pot because I like my tea piping hot. Also, none of my favorite teas come in pyramid bags so I guess I'll have to cut open the paper satchels and go loose leaf.
I got some tea biscuits from Wal-Mart in the green box. How do you eat these the right way?
Shocked you didn't control for temperature of liquid. Arguably just as important as how long you seep
His missed the opportunity to say hot leaf juice
Other then Thai milk tea and a proper chai, I have to agree with MatPat on no milk in tea.
Tea and Honey not milk
You put milk in your tea??? Your insane!
I would have liked to see them try the difference between microwaved water and stove boiled water.
well some of us LIKE oversteeped tea lmao
Forget the british i want to know how all the different Asian cultures prepare and make their tea! Tea is an Asian thing anyway.
So, if the leaves have permeable holes. Can you brew tea in a coffee maker?
The other thing I’m noticing about the glass cup is that you used that to pour into the other two cups as well. So the ceramic mug and china cup had cooler water because the act of pouring from the glass cup to the second cup cooled the water more. That isn’t phrased eloquently, but I’m hoping the thermodynamic principle I’m getting at is coming through.
But I love the tannins
Waste
not joking my mom dosnt drink water at all just tea
You didnt test the Flow Thru tea bag that has a folded bag creating two chambers
Tea... more like TEEHEE..... the good old days
I didn't know it before, but Germans leave their tea bags in until the cup is empty. Once I knew that, it made so much sense as to why I do that. You see, I even get the rest of the water out of the tea bag at the end. xD Basically tea bagging in my mouth there.
35k person to like this video!!!!
I wish you told us what is the prefect amount of sugar to add to it's not too sweet but also not too bitter
I like cold tea not warm tea and I don't use milk in it
you know I feel like instead of calling it tik tok tea they should have called it a monstrositea
Right so, nobody puts the milk in first here 🇬🇧
Assam  I was born there 😏😁
As an indian im used to having tea with milk but that tiktok woman put a bit too much milk in her "tea"
We got dirty bean water, and warm leaf water.
Just want to say I love this channel. So full of info, facts and other tidbits that really keep me coming back. Cheers.
I am an Indian
I dont put milk in my tea... though I also normally only drink green and herbal teas lol
I wonder why boiling water in a microwave is a no-no, and why you didn’t test that variable. What if you can’t afford, have no space or can’t find a tea kettle? Does microwaved water really make such a difference?
It does matter what plate use for your food. If you used a pewter plates and eating something like tomatoes you could get lead poisoning.
"Your tea sucks".... proves that how I've always made tea is right...
Tea is a southern specialty in America water, tea leaves, and sugar amount whatever yalls Grammys tell you 1-100 dashing per gallon me I use about 78 dashing/TEA spoons
I leave my teabags in for about 2 hours. I put in the bags about 7:38 AM and finish by 10:00 AM.
I like to boil the water and tea together until it is a dark brown. Then pour into the gallon pitcher with a cup of brown sugar  or in summer time because I live in the Mojave desert I put tea in water and be in the sun for about four hours then add brown sugar or honey.  The metal cup from  your channel gives it a slight metal taste. But not a glass cup.  Hopefully next would be green tea or sweet tea.
In my home (India) we make tea differently .First we use vessel and put about 70% of water and 30% of milk then we add tea leaves without bag just directly no tea bag then we  add sugar and heat it for around 3 to 5 minute then we use a strainer and put it in the cup
The way I make tea is to pour hot water over the tea bag, but my dad puts his tea bag in cold water and then microwaves it. Then he adds a handful of ice cubes. The way he makes tea is disgusting, but he won't change his ways.
Rooibos RULES!    No milk
I’m a little disappointed they didn’t give the microwave a fair shake
"there's a clear visual difference"  proceeds to NOT show the camera
I love how everyone agreed that this way was the best, then immediately complained on different fronts. Fun episode.
Team no milk here.
meanwhile me from the southern usa drinking the most ungodly and sweetest iced tea know to man
I'm sorry, I'm 100% sure besides science being involved with food a lot. That Mattpat made food theory so he could write off any and ALL food purchases on his taxes.
Karl Smallwood over on the Fact Feind channel (well on his "untitled side channel") actually did a video to show Americans how to make a proper cup of tea and he said that anyone who puts milk in first is wrong and if they ask you to do so you politely but firmly ask them to leave
13:36 I agree so much here… Milk and tea don’t go together
As someone from the southern U.S., I wanna know the how all of these experiments play out with iced tea (except for the milk, milk in iced tea is criminal) and I wanna know which is better (the correct answer is iced, but I wanna see their opinions)
Cool I will try this 😊
Another big factor is the temperature!
This was pretty epic
Matpat gets it, no milk belongs in tea. Personally I like a stout tea that's been brewed for 10+ minutes. For me it's water and teabag only in a 24 oz cup.
e
Matt should add more guests to his videos so he and steph aren't the only people suffering
Could y’all do a coffee version? Folders vs kureagg kinda thing?
Somehow I'm "unique" compared to my other fellow americans because I drink tea without milk or sugar/honey. The base tea flavor, at least with the types of tea I buy, are already nice and complex.. I also don't like milk or too sweet drinks. Loose leaf tea blends are also nice, people should really buy it more.
I drink a half gallon of hot tea everyday. Earl Grey. Straight. The way men drink tea.
No milk in tea is the best.
While watching this episode, I brewed myself some coffee. It's 8:00 in the evening and I don't want to talk about it.
Is it not customary to...stir the milk in??! That's the only way on bottom or on top makes sense to me. Properly blend the flavors
What about cold brewing your tea?
i honestly did not know you were supposed to put milk in tea
What about wassle
This is neat and all, but wasn't there a whole thing about those pyramid tea bags releasing a bunch of microplastics into the tea?
Steph with those mom reflexes - catching that tea before Tom even opened the holder.
I think you'll find that the vast majority of British people will say that making a cup of tea putting the milk in first is an absolute traves-tea. About the only scenario where it might be acceptable is if you're pouring already brewed tea from a pot into the cup.
"Wait, y'all are microwaving your tea?"
I agree with MatPat on his 'milk preferences', the best milk in tea is no milk in tea
Asian tea is superior
Bro I am super disappointed , what about the water !    Can water be boiled multiple times ? What's the best temperature ? What's the best boiling method ? What's the best water brand/source ?
Me just making ice tea by putting tea bags in the coffee maker
I’m offended you didn’t test microwave vs kettle. You constantly decry the microwave, but never once did you think to test it? For shame!
MatPat just come to India we have the best tea
Na you all made the tea wrong you first bush water up a tube that warms the water ya the same time then you slowly poor the water over and you reapeat for 15 mins then you take your tea and put ice in it and stir
As a person in Kenya we always put the milk first.(maybe it's only me)even though Kenya used to be a colony of Britain lol
You should talk about how Arizona ice tea is made or how they kept their business alive. By the way I do like tea without milk annoying sometimes.
Is so concerned about what the brits  think about tea while the country they occupied and wrongful ruled to get said tea is just a footnote.
If a follow-up to this is done, I'd love to see: 1. The effect of Washing the tea - That is, a quick hot water 'brew' of loose leaf tea that is then poured off prior to the normal brew.  2. The second brew - That is, after you've finished a pot of loose leaf tea / used a large leaf tea-pyramid, is the second brew less bitter? How different does it taste? I've always heard that high quality tea SHOULD be able to be brewed twice.
They forget the type of milk 😢
This video was so beautiful, I almost felt teary.
Who puts milk in tea? I didn’t know that was a thing till now
Why was the loose leaf tea worse than the piramid tea bag? I wonder if steeping the loose leaf for less time (or more) would increase the quality.
funnily enough, as an avid tea drinker myself, i literally NEVER add milk (mainly due to lactose intolerance and milk alternatives being a bit pricey where i am). i just boil some water, throw in a teabag and some stevia, then im good to go :p
I only click this video because it had Kermit on the front
A great title for the video. Hats off to whoever though of it.
As someone who switched from buying tea 3-5x a week at Starbucks to making it at home about 2 years ago, I loved watching this video. Since it’s much cheaper and quicker to make at home, it’s cool to know that there’s so many ways to go about making it.
Only heathens in the uk put their milk in first, milk last is the only way
So glad that my home state of Assam got a shout out. Though, I should add that the tea locally consumed by the people of Assam is way stronger than the one the Brits consume.
Am I the only one who remembers Alton Brown's tea episode on Good Eats? Where he went over how and why you make the best cup of tea?
What about the type of mike like i mean should I use my almond milk or my soy mike because some people like me are lactosenolern and the perfect tea could be imperfect ones someone uses the wrong milk so just a question
I usually make my tea in a cast iron teapot. I heat my water in the kettle and while that's going I add my tea leaves into the infuser basket and then add my water, leave the basket in for 30-45 seconds, remove the basket and serve. I don't use milk in tea and for me sweetener  of any kind ruins the flavor of the tea. Good well brewed tea needs nothing IMO. I also usually drink green tea, mostly sencha and hojicha as of late, loose leaf of course.
i clearly dont drink enough tea because i didnt know your suppose to add milk to it
*le gasp* HAH?
Blimey!
me: _1 cup of coffee a day ;  bagged, herbal teas when sick ; and occasional hot cocoa_ don't limit yourself, drink all da safe & edible things!!
Guess you can say tiktok tea got…   *T E A B A G G E D*
aka The Mat-est of the Pats Min-Maxes Dirty Leaf Water
1:40 she could have said "My name is Steep-hanie (or S-tea-p-honey) because i'm steep-hed in the stuff" 20:02 honestly i don't understand, hot water is hot water, how does it matter how you heat it up, microwave or kettle? i have a Pyrex measuring cup, i use that to boil water in the mic and pour it into my drinking cup
What about the SUGAR! But there is a real preffrance on that
Matpat looks so tired in this one! Hope you are remembering to catch some zzz’s in between all the hard work and entertainment you give us!
6:29 wow steph's motherly instincts came right in and knew what was about to happen😭😭
And then there is the way we brew tea in my country, no milk.
If you like Tea, milk has no place in the equation. A good tea, like a good steak, requires no additional splash of anything, and deserves to be enjoyed alone.
Would love to see y’all do this for coffee as well!
Oh the Indians are fuming... Make a sequel in a few months, and call me as the special guest.
The temp with tea is big too! Don't boil water for green tea!
Putting milk in tea is the worst thing ever Texas sweet tea however is just perfect try it
Steph's epic catch of the tea leaves me in tears 🤣 such a good catch!
You did not go into if sugar or honey makes the better cup of tea, did you do this on purpose or just forget.
Y didn't y'all test sweetners? Most people i know here in Montréal take some kind of sugar. I like golden or brown sugar, my mom prefers honey, but my grams takes it classic like y'all. Artificial sweeteners r a plethora of options to test too. I ask for a sequel please. Great episode. Thx  :3
My tea is twisted. So it can't be wrong. Love you Matt. No hate just disappointed.
#nomilkintea
I love tea
How can Americans tell me, a British person, how to have my tea? You literally threw crates of it into the water! That’s not how you make it!
it's ok mat, I don't take milk with my tea. then again, I heat the water in a teapot via microwave, then add the teabags to the pot to steep and then pour in the cup with 2 sweeteners but you do you 🫖☕🎩
When will Americans stop telling us how to drink/make tea but realy im so upset u didn't use Yorkshire or pg tea
I'm confused by the microwave bit - it's the one thing they took a couple shots at but never explained or tested. I mean, heat is heat - I can't imagine the heating technique making any real difference.
Every topic on Food Theory feels like a science fair project people do in Elementary School. And I’m all for it
I'm from Nepal and almost everyone drinks tea here at least twice a day. I would like to add another category to testing tea ie. Drinking technique : Sip vs Slurp.
Wait what about initial water temp?
and the teapot makes a difference
Has anyone on Team Theorists made contact with one The Spiffing Brit? If there is another YouTube gamer that is a king of Tea, it would be him. Where's the colab!?
Me *sees the video title: there’s no way I as someone who doesn’t like tea would need the  info in this vid Also me *clicks video almost immediately
British "people": /j
As a Brit, everyone here thinks if you put milk in first you are wrong so idk why you think it's still a thing, it may have been historical but it's despised in modern Britain 🤣
"Three Identical mugs" No no, they each have a different letter on it.
Where did they disprove the microwave?
I think we found Uncle Iroh's favorite food theory episode.
Oh how I wish for a good tea video about good tea. British tea is sadly not that
what about deciding between which milked? I'd usually have green top or semi skimmed, which i think id the norm here in britain. worth a try
... Now I'm imagining one of those 384-well pipette plates but with slightly different variations of tea in each of them.
In my country we use evaporated milk (concentrated), also milk first!
ok, nice ... but can you grow an avocado from a pit?
I prefer my tea cold without milk.
*Watching in Australia* "It's getting cold...." Hahahahaha no... No.
18:25 Taste and Smell are separate senses. The taste isn't influenced by the smell, the flavor is. Taste is just what the chemical receptors of the tongue sense. Flavor is everything (taste, smell, texture, temperature) combined. I'm a pedant about this because I'm a congenital anosmic (person born without a sense of smell) and get tired of people thinking I can't taste because I can't smell.
He preheated the glass cup by using it as the measuring cup. This episode would have made teahouse ghost have a come apart...
"get dunked on" first of all, great pun (if intended) but also we NEVER put the milk in first, it's like blasphemy. teabag, water, steep, take out bag, add milk and sugar, stir. some people take the bag out after the milk and sugar but that's not the point, you never put the milk in first, we fixed that problem a looong time ago.
This might sound a little weird, but I personally think that this world would be a better place if we didn't drink tea
The Absolute disappointment
I prefer honey in my tea over milk
"Brita gotta stop putting milk first" - I've worked in a coffee shop, hotel and bar, and have never seen anyone do milk first.    I think your information on that one was outdated.   You basicly learned how to make a British standard tea...  Also - loose leaf is usually reserved for flavoured teas. Like your rhubarb and lemon, green tea, Earl Grey, Rhooibus.  Also Also!  I'm a 30 year old born and raised English man. And I hate teas.  Don't drink them.
when you think about it the order of pouring does make sense. Like, the tea and milk would have different densities to begin with, so with one arrangement the two liquids are forced to combine both with diffusion and with gravity, while the other way around is just diffusion.
Breteash are wrong
Nice to know i’ve been doing it completely wrong  I just boil water in our smallest pot, add the tea bag into the cup, add water, add [sweetener] wait to cool, then stir between sips
All the southern people are confused because here there is one tea sweet tea
I personally don't put milk in my tea. The way I make it is boiled water from tea pot, then packet (flat paper packet), then sugar, add ice (specifically 6 cubes), and mix
The best way to enjoy tea is by throwing into the Boston Harbor.
I would love to see this happen again but with other types of teas
Wheres the sugar? No not the milk
Hugely disappointed that they didn't test ways to boil the water too. Stef even says "not the microwave" even though it's the fastest way to boil water.  Apparently the microwave can result in cold spots in your water. Interesting.
Can we get one on Ice Tea now? Please? #teamsweettea
Well tea so here is my blend 25% Darjeeling Tea and 75% Assam Tea because i like it strong and Assam tea is pretty strong. I don't use tea bags as we see this as things for western people. just put them in water and strain it .  Now if you add milk it will taste completely different i personally don't add it only water, tea , little bit of sugar (or not) done.   If you are sick you can also add ginger. If you want to try something funcky use some spices.
The lose leaf is the best quality and the flat bag the worst (fannings and sweepings).  If the lose leaf was too bitter, they just need to dial in the water temperature or the steeping time. And really the best would be lose leaf in a pot as is the Asian method.  And if you need milk and sugar to make it palatable, you have bad tea. Asians don’t use either traditionally. The tea speaks for itself. Like coffee, milk and sugar covers up flaws.
If they weren't doing this by hand, I would ask for more data points. Maybe there's a local maximum near pyramid/3 min/26mL milk, but maybe 3.5 minutes and 20 mL actually turns out better. That'd increase the time to make these experiments drastically though.
calls for someone that was born into tea culture. Doesn't bring in someone from China or India.  Sir this episode is a SHAM.
4:43-4:44 "Why is the handle so hot‽" Right there, there's your next Food Theory topic: why does porcelain, China, etc., when put in the microwave, seem to get hotter than the food we place on it?
Personally I always put coffee creamer in my tea.
I agree with mat no milk in tea the creamy texture is just off putting to me with the teas taste
Why didn't you test teas with salt? It's a time honored American tradition!
I would love to see a real tea expert if this gets some sort of revisit.  There's a lot of elements that are known for those who go really deep into tea, and things that were not tested.  For instance, a lot people preheat their teapots.  That would have made a difference in the temperature.   I personally prefer a tea infuser, in which you put loose leaf tea, pour in the water, and later it drains out the bottom.   The time and temperature changed depending on your method and tea variety.  Of course, this gets pretty from a food theory area into just proper tea technique.
I let my Earl Grey steep for too long before and it was so bitter it overpowered the normal flavor. Never again 😂 11:04
Can't believe Tom finally got away from only being in fnaf videos.
Can you survive off sprinkles lol
Day 3 of asking Matpat for a Film Theory about Brey Wyatt/The Fiend.
I really enjoyed this episode it was fun, but I have a theory request at a Wawa or any “cheaper” coffee place how do i get the maximum amount of caffeine for the cheapest price I want to pull all-nighters with ease without spending loads on coffee
Thank you for all of the qualitea puns. I will enjoy telling them to my teariffic friends teamorrow.
This is by FAR one of my favorite Theory videos (across Game Theory, Film Theory, and Food theory)! The combination of Matt, Steph, and Tom has just the most enjoyable chaos I have ever seen ever. I wish we got to see more of team theorists but also I respect their privacy. <3
According to my wife, the pyramid bags tend to be made of plastic and let microplastics out into your tea. Not sure if it's true, but may be worth considering!
Wait, a gallon a day isn't good for me?
What was the size of the cup
ceylon tea is the best
MatPat: I can show you how to make the perfect tea. StampyLongNose: Hold my cup.
You should reach out to gaijin goomba, and try this with japanese type of teas.
It's just tea.  Buy it in a bottle, get the sweetened stuff Drink it from the bottle, save the cups for something worth using a cup for. Stop whining about it.  It's just tea.
5:32 "This channel is built on the premise that I can overthink anything and then write it off as a business expense." The most accurate summarization of the theory channels I've ever heard.
*laughs in boba tea superiority*
If you want a good festive, herbal tea, try a cinnamon apple tea.  It's my ultimate comfort beverage
The only thing that might affect it on the mug side is a tall mug vs a wide mug. If the milk can't properly mix with all of the tea, as you sip it, you'll likely get some "un-milked" tea sitting beneath the layer of milk. You can simply fix this by either pouring enough milk in fast enough that it hits the bottom of the mug OR lightly stir your tea.
As an American I can say for certainty using a microwave for anything is coin toss on if it's made right
Kettle boiling water; 2 bags of Earl Gray, steeped for 2min; twist over spoon and squeeze; splash of cream.
"Just rinse em out." Easily the hardest I've laughed all week because that totally struck home. It's not like it needs scrubbing guys, just rinse it out and save whoever you live with a headache (or 4).
I'm sorry I can't with the mug sharing! 😅
I’ve had tea but I don’t like how it tastes period. I don’t like the bitter earthern nature.
less than five minutes in and I've already heard the word "tea" thrown around so much that I had to go make myself some. I'm more of an herbal or roobios girl myself.
One of the factors that you didn’t consider when it came to the mug was that the China and ceramic were one step removed from the kettle. The glass was poured directly from the kettle. In Jewish Law, one can’t “cook” on the Sabbath so when making tea, the hot water needs to be poured into a tertiary cup so as to cool the water enough that it’s not “cooking” the tea leaves. The water is still too hot in the kettle and secondary cup. This could be why the glass cup was hotter than the other two and NOT because of the material…
I learned this from a dude who loves coffee but the reason why you get a difference from pouring and milk first or last is because when you pour in milk first it's more likely to get burned
You can tell when someone grew up with a dish washer when they don't reuse the same cup for the same exact thing...
I went through this tea phase when I like 9 and I loved earl grey that had water and went in the microwave but in my defense was while we were traveling a lot so most of the time the hotel would have kettle water
I want to see you guys tackle Asian tea methods, Chinese, Indian, Japanese etc.
Steph was dunking the pyramid teabag in and out of the tea repeatedly, though. No one else was doing that. Dunking forces the water through the leaves more than letting it just sit, so that kind of discredits the idea that the bag alone makes a difference.
I'm surprised you guys didn't think adding the milk on the top or bottom would change the flavor. I still remember learning that the positioning of ingredients actually does matter thanks to your hamburger (I think it was the Krabby Patty?) episode when you found that out.
Where are my Gong Fu Cha drinkers when Matpat said their goal was to make the best cup of tea...3 min brew are you insane 😂 more like less than 10 seconds. Love the episode as always Matpat
i microwave ine because i dont have time
15:56 I always pour tea first to let sugar dissolve because cold milk does not dissolve a lot of sugar
I've thought if they want to impress people with certain teas, they should include extra sweeteners and flavors that make those teas so appreciated. As opposed to the bland colored water.  Bags with sugar (or stevia) added, maybe powdered cream. Something that can go in a Keurig ?
PG tips are so glass.
no milk in tea all the way also where is the sugar representation
I'm with you on team "no milk", the only time milk should be used in tea is if it's something with other added flavors like spiced chai.
Okay is anyone else wondering who's mug is the A? The M obviously MatPat and S obviously Steph but who is the A
If tou want to ensure a good TEA always drink Yorkshire tea.
ahh 3-4 cups of tea per day..rookie numbers, i drink iced tea literally all day everyday, i got through on average in the winter 1.5-2 gallons per day, in the summer that ups to about 3-3.5 gallons per day...luckily i can somehow afford it, but yeah...rookie numbers XD
I know that Christmas is coming up but hear me out what happened to hot apple cider or cold
This completely dismisses the existence of, um, Asian milk tea, which is clearly superior.
Strange unexpected potential twist on the milk before water factor, I drink it milk after water 90% of the time, but if you can find it and are willing to afford the little extra cost, un-homogenised milk first with the tea bag in while the water boils, then water added and steeped actually makes an even better cup of tea.
I love all hot drinks. Tea, Coffee and Hot Cocoa! <33
Uncle Iroh would scoff at you for calling tea _warm leaf water,_ but he'd love your approach to teamaking.
I’ve always put the milk last because of the change in temperature. Back when I was 14, I was overthinking it and decided that what I’d learned in science class about warmer water diffusing faster applied to my tea.  So yea bag goes in while it’s hot, sugar goes in and is stirred while it’s hot, milk or cream goes in last to preserve the temperature.
But what about putting in water vs the tea leaves first? Dave Gorman has a thing about the proper way to make tea, and the tea leaves go in first with the water on top. The water mixes the tea so all the water is mixed, instead of have a wet bag of tea.
Well that's a hot take Matt actually I never tried British tea I only had American tea
No Caster sugar vs granulated sugar?
I feel like they forgot the water variable
You know when your British when you do sciencetific research about tea and recommend what type of tea bag is the best for tea
The fact that it goes from getting dark at 10pm, to now being dark at 5:30pm in the course of about 2 weeks, is indeed a total body shocker.
Gonna make every brit ever angry ... Iced Tea is better.
Best way to make tea. Bag. Hot water, 4 minutes, bouncing the bag a bit every minute or so, then a splash of milk, thermos mug to sip all day
Tea
I just don't like milk
Sister this with Coffee now. french vanilla creamer please
6:35 Why is nobody talking about "Boston Tea Party Summarized"??? Am I the only one who likes history jokes???
I’m assuming the glass is the warmest because you used that mug to fill the other mugs.
Part two for health? This is all taste, I'd be curious to see an episode on stuff like antioxidant+caffeine extraction, and if you should really be concerned about microplastics from those tea bags
MILK. IN. FIRST.
Me an asian who doesn't add milk: what
Next question is does the type of milk have an effect
“When life hands you small green leaves” Me: you make dru- Matpat: you make tea Me: oh 😅
I've never even heard of putting milk in tea, I just drink the straight dirty leaf water
Totally ignoring the southern sweet tea, iced tea and sun tea...
I just made a cup of tea as soon as I saw how to make the best tea. The only tea I had was Chinese green tea... I think green tea I just looked at the box the box was green
East coast Canadian.  Fire three King Cole two-cup bags in a thermos pot. Add 1.5 litres hot water from electric kettle. Seal airtight.  Forget about the pot for 20 to 30 minutes.  Remember.  Pour 750ml into a cold steel double-wall mug, add maybe 10-15 ml milk, no sugar  Slam it back in around five swigs  Go back for all the rest in the pot 10-15 minutes later  Repeat process every 90-120 minutes
why does this channel specifically remind me of old kids tv, like a modern irl spin
Pass on the milk in tea.   Also best tea is real southern sweet tea.
Now I’m craving a cup of tea and I don’t even like tea.
Tea has no milk!!! Ok? If you disagree you are wrong
matpats right tea is best without milk
I mean common we all know Chinese tea is the best tea. And y'all put milk on your tea? That's literally just milk tea.
Ah yes,very classy Matpat☕😌
I always pour the milk first so uh
this needs a part two with blind tests so there is less prejudice ( even though the some tea will still be obviously bad)
You're supposed to fluff up the flat teabag!!!!
Spiff should have been hired as a consultant.
Matthew Patthew, get a kitchen scale!
MatPat: WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT'S THE BEST ________!!  Everyone else: But-but that's impossible!  MatPat: NOT FOR US!!
4:50 At least you have some water in there, I remember one time when my friend offered me tea with milk end the proceeded to put a tea bag into a full cup of milk
I'm gonna cause a war.... make an age of chaos... Ice Tea is the superior being >:D None can compare.
Semipermiable mebraines
my thoughts on why 'milk first' was more sour and such is because the hot water likely scalded the milk as it was poured in. pouring the milk second cools the tea and helps prevent scalding, whereas pouring the tea second quickly heated the milk and scalded/soured it. its also a matter of how fast you pour it, since when you add milk second you instinctively pour it slower so as to not overflow your mug, which in turn lets the milk and tea meet temps more smoothly and also prevents scalding the milk. When you have more room in the mug you feel free to pour it faster, therefore, again, scalding the milk because too much heat was added too quickly.  My personal method of making tea that I've always used, that happens to closely follow what the conclusion was in the video, goes as follows: Heat your water to near boiling, not a full boil or you'll blanch the leaves, and pour into your chosen mug (I use a sturdy ceramic one) with a pyramid bag if available (though I use the rectangle ones too) after approximately 3 minutes, remove the tea bag and add a hearty splash of milk (which I guesstimate is the 26 ml of milk like suggested) then, since I like my tea sweet, I add about two droppers of liquid stevia extract (which I would guess is like a quarter of a- or a third of a teaspoon of liquid stevia extract, or maybe less)
HEY MATPAT!!! YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN BOILING WATER IN THE MICROWAVE!!!  https://youtu.be/1_OXM4mr_i0
Yeah, great. 26ml of milk. Super scientific there. For what? For every tenth of a football stadium? For hollowed out coconut? I need proportions dammit! Use a metric for the volume of tea! Any metric! How big are your cups here?!  Even the classic "banana for reference" would be appreciated.
I’m surprised ur not covering HMF on here
Hot sugar lemon tea !!!!! say tea in replies for tea army
Well our coffee is better right? Lol
eeeew, why milky tea?? gotta agree with MatPat on this one. Milk only goes in coffee and even that's a stretch
Nice but what about the Asian way verses the British way of making tea? I know it is probably  a matter of preference in taste, however there is the health benefits  to consider. I would like to learn more about flower tea (where you seep a flower instead of just the leaves). Does flower tea provide a better flavor?
fun fact: if you want real tasty tea buy them directly from sri lanka, it's so tasty that you don't even need to add milk nor sugar
What about the type of milk
Which theories do you apply to your real life?
hihihihihihhihiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Me who doesn’t use milk. 👀 Yes I do drink coffee with no creamer or milk why?
Here in the south it's cold and filled with sugar
So when do you do southern sweet tea. It’s the best.
steph holding her hand under the loose tea preemptively and catching it perfectly is just *chefs kiss*
Ok now do fruit tea 😂
What if you stir the leaves while brewing?
You forgot to test cup shaped tea strainers.  Unlike little ball strainers they have lots of room for the tea to steep.  I'm not going to buy from the limited number of manufacturers who make pyramid shaped tea bags and probably charge twice as much.
Modern day American drinks tea An American from 1776: Traitor.
Aside from the fact that taste is completely subjective ( for example I like both honey and milk in my tea and I like my tea hot and sweet compared to alot of people who like their tea cold and bitter )   This video seems to miss the point, you can techcinally prove what test is the best but your sample size was only 3 people , that's not taking into consideration other styles and types of tea , such as southern tea , it was only looking at traditional British tea.   Either way drink it how you like it even if it might not be scientific
I’d love to see something like this for soda or coffee
only 4 cups of tea a day! rookie numbers
As a Canadian i've drank tea since i was about 5 and i think being part of the Monarchy gives us more British sensibilities when it comes to tea and i've never seen anyone microwave water to make it only to warm it up if it's gotten cold but even that's rare.  My personal preference is to use a large travel mug and get loose leaf tea with a box of empty tea bags i fill when making a cup then add around 26 ml of milk and maybe 2-3 teaspoons of sugar for the perfect cup, currently drinking some Pumpkin Chai tea that's excellent.
I don't know any British person who doesn't hate putting milk in first. Everyone I know does  Tea bag in mug Water in mug *Wait appropriate time* Milk
One bit they forgot to test.   water first vs tea bag/leaves first?
Now here's a question of my own.  Does it make any difference to put the bag in and then pour the water, as opposed to putting the water in before the tea?
Who tf puts milk in tea
you guys missed a couple of tests. sugar. how many lumps make it perfect.  sugar in first, middle, or last.
While the south is over here making cold teas full of sugar
Where's the Boston River test
For the record, since I am not sure it was mentioned, pouring additives before or after only actually matter based on the type of drink. If you want a drink where flavor is fully distributed, you pour the main substance last so everything mixes properly. If you want more of what all of you liked, you are having a drink that is surface cooled enough to drink faster. You taste the sweeter cream flavor which then more subtly introduces the lesser sweet (or savory) flavor. Just wanted to mention that.
The correct amount of milk in tea is no milk
I don't like tea, and I don't know if matpat puns are helping or making it worse.
You guys forgot about water temperature. Depending on the tea you're making, temp makes a difference.
South East Asians sitting in one corner using condensed milk in their tea and frothing it. Tasty tasty Teh.
One thing i learned growing up with the flat bags of tea, if you want it to taste better, you have to raise the teabag out of the water, and then re-submerge, repeat this action until you get your desired result. I usually go based off of color and transparency, so for me personally i want the color of my tea a little on the darker side, so I'd dunk it roughly 15-17 times my mom on the other hand likes it lighter, so she'll only do it 7-10 times, and yes I'm serious when i say it tastes different if you do my method, than just normal steeping, nothing against it, it's just what i grew up with
I've been sick these days so I've been having hot liquids most of the time. Watching this analysis while drinking my tea 🍵 as well made the experience much more tasteful.
As I sit here watching purposefully extra steeped tea :D
Cant wait for the spiffing brit to see this
Shroom tea ftw
i drink hot Choco a lot, even in summer , i maybe I'm weird
Matpat if i hear 1 more tea pun im breaking into your house and pouring coffee on the private area of all your nice pairs of pants
The best tea is steeped in Boston Harbor.  'Murica...
Wait... you're only supposed to steep tea for 5 minutes max???? ... I don't think I've ever steeped tea for less than 8 xD
As an Arab the way we do it in my country is by not using teabags, we use kettles instead which in my opinion gives it better taste and you would get a darker tea.
Those pyramid tea bags are often made from plastic mesh, which have been reported to release huge amounts of micro-plastics (especially when exposed to hot water). If you use those please look for what type of material the bag is made from.
finally one about tea
The correct amount of milk to put in tea is stop doing that and have an Earl Grey instead.
watch the next episode be "Is the cereal REALLY better before the milk?"
Watching this while drinking tea, lol
🥰🏆
Wait who puts milk in tea?
MatPat: those god danm millenials trying to make tea different. dude, YOUR a millenial!!!
Where did the hot water go? The mug was full of milk!
The best tea is actually fruit tea, tyvm
glass was the hottest because you prewarmed it twice by using it as a measuring cup! xD
Agreed Mat!! Best milk in tea is no milk!!
I think the reason the milk tasted sour when it's on the bottom is the water is so hot it scalds the milk but when done on top its cooled off enough
AAAAA THE PUNS
tea is gross, drink soda🇺🇸
there are places that will serve you dried tea leaves in a ceramic teapot, that are good enough for 4-6 individual hot water steeping sessions, each time getting different results, making this more of an 'experience' you enjoy over time, like 4 hours or so, than a typical 'british throwing the kettle on for a mug of tea in the morning'.
I wanna see mat make milk tea or Boba tea now
Milk at bottom doesn't overheat the milk. Also hard to say that taste buds attuned to American food should be objectively right for everyone, including people from India, china, UK ect.
Some weirdos will put milk in first but you never put the tea bag into the cup of water & definitely not the microwave. Maybe you should test which kind of biscuit goes best with tea too. Scones, malted, digestives, jam, TimTams, lots of choices.
I have NEVER had tea in my life, sorry brits :(
Challenge: Take a sip of tea for every tea related joke this video makes.
so i been making tea correctly
The British way is milk on top...
Why keep commenting on the color of the tea, if you just use opaque vessels to brew it in? Why not use a glass mug and a glass teapot?
You know, the Brits have no room to judge about tea considering they didn't even know how to make it so they stole China's tea. (It's a fact. Look it up.) I did like the "Boston Tea Party Summary" though. Very nice.
What tea you drink dictates if I add milk or not. Always been an add milk last girl if any at all.  Another variable for me would also be warm milk or cold milk.
Just want to say, I am American and I never ever put water in mug then microwave. I honestly just use kettle then just put tea bags in the kettle before pouring. So not all us Americans do the whole microwaving to any British across the pond here.
Great video but I wonder why not the type of Milk was tested
and we have the boston folks way, just dumping the tea in the river…
But Mat Pat... What type of milk is best???
I prefer chrysanthemum tea But normally drink green tea because finding the flowers is not as easy as you think
I think we can all agree that the most shocking conclusion from this video is that Matt had an electric kettle.
But what type of milk is better because they have different flavors so I will like that to be explained
Sweetener? I put sugar in my tea.
If it’s none of your business why are you making a video on it being your business?
I agree with Matt. No milk in tea Is better
What about making tea in a Keurig machine? K-cups and just using it to heat the water?
no one in britain puts milk in first
the puns.... it's too much
If you're really worried about cracking the teacup, put a metal spoon in first.  The spoon will absorb some of the heat and minimize the chance of cracking the cup.  I do this for hot chocolate, too.  But you might want to test it and make sure it doesn't change the taste!  But you're still doing the tea wrong.  You're supposed to refrigerate it and serve it over ice!  ;-)   Earl Grey makes a surprisingly good iced tea, BTW.
Finally Tom gets to do something else than fnaf xD
I know its a thing but no one i know in Britain steeps their tea its way more efficient to just sture the tea bag for 10 seconds and take it out
What is this blasphemy! Milk and sugar in tea. Just brew a more palatable tea there are thousands of different teas. Why brew it like the British when the Chinese are way more knowledgeable with tea. The brits don't even grow there own tea. They're drinking it with milk so you know there palates are toned on fish and chip and not the thousands of different food traditions China does have over millennia. Just going to a Chinatown tea shop would provide better information on quality tea leaves and brewing techniques over your regular British industrial tea drinker.
I think every British person can vouch on how you will be shunned out of the country if you put milk in first
"Tradional British" aka stolen from Indians
Interesting. Your taste test on milk v tea first reached the exact opposite conclusion of the college study that came out a few years back (sorry, don't remember which college and do not want to search, Google hates me). Their findings were that adding cold milk to hot tea with all it's tannic acids  insta-curdled the milk and soured the brew where pouring hot tea into cold milk raised the temperature gradually without shocking the milk (similar to the process of coddling or tempering eggs for a sauce).
TikTok isn't good for anything else. Let's be honest here. Also, WHEREDIDYOUGETTHATCUPHEADCUPIWANTONE!!!!!!!!!!
He should do a theory about Coca Cola Dreamworld; the dream flavored soda, do dreams really taste fruity or citrusy or do they taste like other things. What do dreams taste like really?
only 3-4 ill drink a half gallon of if i  have it
Have ya’ll ever tried your tea cold?
What about running the water from a keurig?
I don't use milk in tea, but I do use it in coffee. (Well, half and half, usually.) And what I've found is putting milk in last gives you more control over it. If I put it in first and then the coffee, it might end up being too much or too little. Put milk in last and you can put just the right amount in.
hoppy matpat
me who just throws a tea bag in hot water and leaves it for anywhere from 5 min to 2 days
Where's the Yorkshire tea?? Now, you must do a British tea tier list. Rate our teeeeeea!!!!!!
I found this very informative, but I wonder if there is a coffee equivalent?  That might be a little more involved due to the different methods for roasting or drying the "bean" as well as saltwater vs freshwater brews.
The perfect cup of Tea is a cup of yorkshire tea or yorkshire tea gold. For people that know the reference we are just perfectly balanced with no explotes at all kind of people
I would like to see the Asian perspective on the perfect cup of tea along with the British.
No rinse cup simply refill.
I prefer sweet tea
Tom let his intrusive thought win with dropping that tea on steph's hand 🤣
Milk? On tea? Im brazillian and Im in shock. Also curious.
3:00 you can just see the concern in their faces
Matt says get dunked on while every household ive ever seen puts milk on the top.
Imagine Having your entire plant based evolution end in a kettle
I'm not British, nor do I have TikTok, and *I KNOW* that the "TikTok tea" is *VERY* wrong 😅😂😂!
anyone else trying to figure out what the letters on the mugs stand for (m, a, s) math, no idea, science? maybe Mathew, no idea, Stephanie?
You should have a _"Conspiracy Theory"_ series  First episode. I vote for 911 or Con Trails
i eat cookie and watch this video
"One thing she lacked: the international perspective..."  Me _(not paying attention to the video)_ : "Ah, the Asians."  "...We needed someone *British* "  Ah, okay
It's weird to see this episode to "figure out tea" when there's thousands of years of tea history that already did that. Just put loose leaf in a French press for the recommended time and temp and strain to cup
Okay, now that you've done the british way you can do the america way. Sweet tea baby!
I’m somewhat disappointed when it comes to the milk in this episode. Scientifically it doesn’t matter which goes in first(milk or tea) they still mix the same way no matter which is moved to a different container first. So I can only assume that it was an act
How much sugar?
The simple fact this was not a collaboration with the spiffing Brit is insulting, I'm pretty sure  reanu keeves would like a word with Matt Pat
Your milk amount finding is super-close to being just 10% milk, if you use a nice round 250mL cup.
I'm still curious about the difference between the microwave and regualr boiled water? Why does microwave water taste different?
Why was the microwave thrown out without the science?! Where’s the taste test on microwaved water versus stove and water heater methods?! Come on MatPat!
Microwave it, put in honey, add decaf, tell the UK to deal with it. 4 easy steps lol.
This entire video is wrong  you put water in a mug  microwave it 2 minutes (Remember to use a oven mitt to take it out) Add the tea bag,  Milk or creamer, Than all the sugar In your kitchen then your done
My drink is microwaved monster
I'm a brit, and I've never put milk first in my life. Utterly ridonculous to be frank.
I'm so glad that you didn't go the news media route and say that the international standard cup of tea (an actual regulated standard) is supposed to be the "ideal" cup of tea. But it's actually just an easily reproducible cup of tea for testing.
That tik tok video was awful😂
U.K here, you can't say triangular tea bags are the best when you haven't tried Yorkshire Tea.
I mean, now you've got to do a lemonade and/or iced tea episode
Matpat: tannins are SUPER bitter.  Fernet Branca: Are you challenging me?!
American: tries to make tea British people: HERETIC
This video actually made me re-watch a bunch of Video about ISO Standard Tea Making. ISO3103.  And I think I am more confused about if the British go with Milk first or Milk later. (The ISO Standard says Milk First, with Approval from UK, and Disapproval from Ireland.)  I've always done Milk later, as I would observe the color change to get the amount of milk correct.
I thought when life gives you lemons you "Make life take the lemons back!"
"Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out."
Fun fact about herbal tea: it’s not technically tea and can’t get bitter the way other tea does. It’s kinda impossible to really go to hot and you should steal for much much longer than you would any other tea! I didn’t know this before and was basically ruining my tea lol.
I only drink southern sweet tea 😂 I can drink a gallon in less than 2 days
Tea is a leaf soup  Prove me I'm wrong 😅
I'm pretty sure the reason pouring milk in first/last affects the taste because of the rapid temperature increase of the milk (my Dad talked to me about it for half an hour once, it was an interesting conversation).
what about aisian tea?
19:34 I will say that anything milk related in a plastic cup is nauseating. Anyone else feel that?
8:59 I see what you did there! 😂
Saw the thumbnail, immediately hoped we would get The Spiffing Brit. The video would have been perfectly balanced. 👌
12:32 stop..stop..stop..
Very few people in the UK still put milk in first. I'd say the vast majority put the milk on top and would ridicule people putting the milk in first.  Also no-milk with sugar is the superior tea
I'm with you MattPat. Nest milk is no milk.
You left out the water quality variable, how many minerals in there, and what would be the result and taste with like, Distilled water for control group purposses
Having used water from a kettle poured onto a teabag in a cup and water heated in the microwave with the teabag put in afterward I can say the only discernible difference is that the latter method is more convenient.
Is it bad I almost mistook this for a film theory video same mattpatt just food
I'm with MatPat on this one, milk ain't doing the tea any favors. And this is from someone who loves milk. I like the bitterness of tea, and I like balancing it out with a good glob of honey (which I find tastes better than sugar, and it's healthier.)
Steph, friendo, reuse your mugs 🙏🏻
Is it possible that the type of milk changes anything, 2%, 1%, whole, skim, dairy free (almond,soy, etc.), lactaid, I need to know!!!
Me over here putting honey in the tea with milk
biggest problem is that most of these were not blind tests
I had some lotus flower tea at a Buddhist temple. It's has such a strong perfume essence. I loved it but not for every day and not 4 cups a day.
I boil my water in the microwave in a glass measuring cup then pour it into my mug with a tbsp of loose leaf (in a tea ball). My mug has a lid, so I put the lid on during the steeping time.
My green tea leaves float sometimes
What about wood to drink out of
I need TheSpiffingBrit to see this, I don't know why, but as soon as the episode began all i could think was "what spiff would say about this?" and now I need to know
Just remember don't offer tea to unconscious person, unconscious people don't want tea
We should put a pun counter next time
Does not matter anything chai is the best
Chinese here. I agree with Matpat that milk isn't necessary in tea at all. I even love tea for the bitterness. In many Asian countries tea and milk tea are completely different concepts.
As a person who also drinks a lot of tea, you definitely don't warm the water in the microwave.
Adding the tea to hot water will never give you good tea. You need to pour the hot water over the tea in order to release the flavour. Even if you agitate it for ages you will never get the full flavour doing it the other way around.
MattPatt is there a way big companies are stealing the flavor or the quality of our food same way they are stealing the amount of food while keeping the same price like in your video “They’re stealing your food!” Because over the years I felt like the taste quality or even just the quality of food hasn’t been the same maybe that’s because I’ve grown out of those flavors or is it possibly that they’re taking away the quality of food?
You forgot the main ingredient as a variable! The quality of the water makes a big difference too. For example filtered Vs unfiltered water makes a surprisingly big difference, especially in the UK where the water is quite hard
Hi
3 to 4 cups a day is not a lot! Just get a mug, make tea, and when you finish it, go refill it. One mug a day, the right amount of tea.
ok , now make sweet tea sun because southerners will argue over it being better than any other tea. and yes, milk in tea is wrong. use creamer.
"Ladies and gentlemen it's that time of year again, the weather is colder the nights are longer" And the McRib is back
As a tea nerd I'm salty XD
How to make tea (coming from a scottish descendant of a Glasgow raised grandma):  Step 1: boil water in kettle until it whistles  Step 2: pour boiled water into cup with tea bag Step 3: let tea brew  Step 4: add a little bit of milk Step 5: enjoy!   Everyone else: I put the kettle in the freezer
Can you bring him on more often?
Fantastic and hilarious video. I don't typically put milk in my tea, but it's nice to have it.  My question is.......what about the time in regards to elevation?   And maybe the taste was affected by the original materials vs today's materials? Just a thought, I guess.
How about green tea?
Kinda disappointed they did a whole episode on tea without mentioning Türkiye even once
the microwave.... Which should be the next video by the way... is often used wrong. just slapping something in, punching in the time, and bob's your uncle, is just wrong. you need to set your power level to the correct level depending on the food or beverage you're trying to warm up. Which the watt range to get your maximum effectiveness for a microwave is between 650-850 watts. Which in a 1000 watt microwave (the most common you can get in the US) is power 6,7, or 8 respectfully. Take note it's called an oven for a reason make sure you have a pot rag to get you plate or mug out when done.
i live in a country where it is summer
I didn’t even know your supposed to put milk in tea  Also you should do a redux where you determine the best water for tea
Matt pat is truely a smart individual as the correct amount of milk in tea is zero.
I agree with Matt. No milk
A little bit of sugar is nice but i don't have cubes I use only 2 packets of sweetener
Did anyone count the official amount of “tea” puns? 🤣
Can someone explain to me how that huge test range of 1, 3 and 5 minutes is more accurate than a minute window for each different type of tea bag?
Is it just me or is milk in tea not normal
My tea consists of any teabag within the pantry, possibly different types, way too much sugar, at a temperature that makes a pyroclastic surge look like an ice storm.
I need to try this... because I make "adhd tea" a lot, which involves forgetting that I made tea, and then finding it hours later with the teabag still in it... just dumping in a big spoonful of sugar, and bam. Perhaps because of this tendency, I have come to really like that lip-puckering tannin feel -- I actually even usually use 2 teabags (but for 16oz or 20oz cups).  But I'd really like to get the sense of actually-good tea... because it's one thing to have your own personal preference, but I do feel like I've never properly respected That Which Is Tea... if that makes any sense 😅 and having these steps to follow might help keep me on-track and keep my tea from being abandoned for hours!
What about the water? Deionized, distilled, tap, mineral, spring, purified...
Maybe that's why they put milk on top of lattes
6:35 YES!!!!
MatPat: "Am I getting to real for you?" Me: *looks at wife who drinks 4+ cups of tea a day all year round* "yes"
Ya’ll forgot the best kind of tea bag, the circular one!!
20:38 why wouldn’t there be a Diet Coke in the back
This episode inspired me to use my boiler kettle again...  Nice!
I'd love to see a theory about the importance of tea in history. The book "For All the Tea in China: How England Stole the World's Favorite Drink and Changed History" by Sarah Rose is a super interesting read for anyone interested.
Now do hindi and chinnese Tea, also you should get Steph a cute Tea pet
as a British person i watched the whole video just to know ive been doing my tea the right way haha 😂
Already watched 1 minute and this sounds just like my mom
Hello, Brit here You only ever put milk in first when you use a teapot. When the tea is already brewed milk first should be fine.  When tea is brewing, milk last
Mattman. I am very much born and raised within the mighty UK region. I do not know why nor how your in-house Brit has given you such a horrible way of prepping our delicious bevs but as a loyal tea truther I am appalled, offended and betrayed by this so-called "traditional" method. I'm sure many of my people have taken notice to the horrendous order and methods taken to have made such a staple of our land but I will cry out nonetheless!  boil kettle throw bag into the cup directly pour boiling water into the cup dowsing the bag well and good leave for around 2 minutes squish the tea bag at the bottom remove it and throw away mix those last remnants together  pour the milk of your choice in but ONLY a dash mix together  wipe the tea spoon dry and add any sugar you like TEA  But one thing we will never be able nor should possibly stand is to ever put the milk in first! It will immediately bring shame and well deserved untrust to the tea, yourself and your family as they have not taught you the proper way of making the tea and spreading this defiled "method" of violating everything we stand for. That and if someone does not want tea, don't make them drink it.
I would like to see Southern tea versus British tea
why would you ask a british person about tea?  Like all their food, it is kinda.. bad.  British tea is like American beer.. just because it is a national obsession doesn't mean it is good.
At 18:45 why didn't you just use a scale to measure the water poured directly from the kettle into each cup?
i dont know a single brit that pours milk on the bottom
milk first is for when you make it in the pot, if you're making it in the mug it's milk last
I usually make my tea by boiling the water in a kettle, it's honestly off putting to know that people boil their water in the microwave for any reason, and I use a teapot, though it has a little strainer to keep the leafs out of the tea when you pour it, I steep it for 6 minutes, because I didn't know better, and then I pour it in on top some sugar, about 3 tablespoons for about 2 cups of tea, and I don't use milk. One thing I learned from this video is that I'm steeping my tea for way too long, which might be why i put a lot of sugar into it. I do agree with Matpat on milk, though, I don't remember if I've tried milk in tea, but I like it how I make it, so it works for me. I do drink it from a thermos that I drink all my tea from, so that might be affecting it, but it's convenient and keeps it warm for a long time, which is a plus because I sometimes get distracted playing a game or watching a video, and it also fits just about the whole teapot in it, so it's very convenient. So I've learned that I'm doing most everything right, sans the milk because I don't use it, but it's refreshing to know I'm not that uncultured
Well, this is very interesting. But, I believe I shall continue my current practice of putting 20 flat, paper tea bags containing finely-cut green tea in 1.25 gallons of cold water, letting it steep for anywhere from 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, and then adding a random amount of honey. I then either serve it cold or put a cup of it in the microwave for two minutes.
Who puts milk in tea???
Something to add as a note is the pyramid tea bags are often made out of plastic and micro plastics as a result with the boiling water is something you want to avoid (plus more plastic waste) so paper bags are far superior
So any theory as to why milk first or tea first should make a difference?
Show us the tea color don't just drink it
Matpat didn't sing 🎶 "hot on my fingies" this time 😤🤧
best tea is no milk in tea agreed! that's the way we drink it in our country
So you are wrong in the UK if you put milk in first. Here is a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei46KnXB3BA
Leave your milk out of my tea!! Milkless tea is the best
Can you guys should do a whole series of tea , like looking at Chinese gongfu tea
same cup?
Who adds honey into their tea🍵 ☕? I like a strong herbal peppermint tea with a tiny bit of honey 🍯 (can't drink caffeine and also lactose intolerant 😔) .
I do not put milk in tea from mexico
Lol we need to tag the spiffingbrit  he would be so mad
Here in Ireland we drink ALOT of tea. My record stands at 10 cups in one day.
You should do a food theory about how to not tear up while cutting up an onion I would like to know and so does my mom we watch your videos ALL THE TIME it is very entertaining and interesting I hope you make my theory some time!
I also have no milk, but I add cold water on top so I don't burn myself
Zero, the answer is zero milk, it's absolutely disgusting🤮🤢
ok yes the tic tok tea is pretty bad but just using the microwave to boil water instead of the kettle is objectively fine, just do it in a pyrex liquid measuring cup or something not the cup you're gonna steep in.
At around 3:39 you missed a tea pun, it’s all part of the mulTEAverse.
You cowards have no idea of the power of Southerners and their iced sweet tea. I can drink a gallon of tea a day, every day.
4:36 Another Food Theory video with the MatPat "It's Hot" song and dance 🤣🤣
14:31 why did you guys leave the milk open?
I feel like this should've been done with a blind taste test.
As a person who drinks sweet tea, this whole video is confusing.
Usually I have a La Croix when I watch these videos.  I had tea, without milk.
Watched this while drinking tea 🤣
"can overthink anything, and write it off as a business expense."                New favorite quote. Thank you for brightening my day!
Us Brits do put the milk on top. As you have pointed out, putting milk first is what the lower classes did because thermal expansion would break inferior cups. This is why referring to the "milk-first" sort of people is an insult. Us Brits do no wish to associate with that sort of people.
I was lowkey hoping that they got the spiffing britt as the ultimate tea expert/overlord.
I usually make tear with loose leaf and a drip coffee maker.
Love the episode but I have to say nothing beats southern sweet iced tea.
I'm expecting to see the Spiffing Brit.
Ideal tea: - Use your coffee percolator but without coffee grounds to heat the water - Use two bags of tea per cup - Steep them for five to ten minutes - Be sure to squeeze the bag afterward to get all those delicious tannins in there - Add one or two ice cubes to your first cup or several to chill it to ideal drinking temperature. -- PROTIP: You can pour tea into an ice cube tray and freeze it to make sure future tea has tea flavored ice available, so you can chill it without watering it down - Don't add dairy, that's gross! Milk or cream is for coffee, not for tea or hot cocoa!  I drink a pot of tea once every couple months, usually if I _really_ want a drink of something more flavorful than water but can't handle the amount of caffeine in an additional pot of coffee over my norm (such as if it's late at night).  Ideal coffee: - Buy the cheap bulk coffee grounds, like ones with the brand name/iconography of the store you're buying from rather than the likes of Folgers or anything fancy or that has its own restaurant - Use half as many grounds as directed - Add whole milk, half and half, or heavy whipping cream to taste - You might want to add an ice cube or three to your first few cups of a pot, but like tea you can pour coffee into ice cube trays and freeze it to cool down coffee with  I drink one to three pots of coffee this way every single day.  Ideal hot cocoa: - Fill a cup with hot water; the tap running hot is usually warm enough -- I said WATER, not MILK, you weirdo! - Add a packet of hot cocoa powder - Optionally, stir with a peppermint candy cane if you want a lot of extra sugar and a little tiny bit of extra flavor. Mint chocolate isn't for everyone. - Don't drink more than one of these a day; coffee and tea you can have in abundance if you don't add sugar, but hot cocoa is literally just a liquid candy.
I fully expect the next game theory to be about the science of teabagging How deep, how many times, the ideal interval for the best effect...
South UK majority of us put milk on top
Let's agree,  we gotta quote MatPat on the "OoOoH oOoh That tea is hawt!"
Wish the camera showed the tea color
Today I found out did this.
I agree that the best tea is the one without milk :)
You missed honey
I don't have a dishwasher 😗
I think the reason that milk on top is better is because it is more dense, because of that is sinks down and mixes with the tea, with it on the bottom it doesn't travel through the tea, therefore it doesn't mix. Also, I think that the classic tea cup would be the best, granted it doesn't change the taste, but if you want to get your tea at maximum quality it should be as soon as possible so that the aroma and thereby flavor doesn't have time to get out, to do that we can't be waiting as long for it to cool down. Granted, the difference is so small that it won't matter but if we really want the best we need to factor it in.
I'm not sure how likely you guys would read this, but I'd definitely love to see a 3rd alternative for the milk part:  What about putting the milk into the water (in the right ratio) first THEN boiling that water milk mixture, before putting the milk in? Because that's how my sister makes tea (but no she's not British, so we're curious)...
I’m with Matt Pat. Zero milk in tea.  Milk in tea sounds awful.
I was hoping they would do a kettle steep vs heating the water in the microwave steep
Matpat: How much milk do you put in the tea Me:*still horrified that anyone puts milk in their tea*
also it was the poor of the poor protecting their precious porcelain, not the masses, the rich had to put milk second
Mathew this is desperate
6:37 can we please talk about this-
I can't lie that video with the microwave tea actually has me gagging
What about sugar in tea?
Indian tea better 🗿
That gym analogy lol.
now we need cream or jam or sandwich scones
Who puts milk in tea!? *sigh* yall are wrong
Warm leaf water?!? Uncle Iron would be disappointed.
this is literally how northerners in england make their tea. congrats on proving we are right and london is wrong xD
They should make MEME Theory 0:32
As a Tea lover, TikTok tea now will forever haunt me
I love the british people gate keeping tea when they literally stole it from other countries, and they criticize the ways the origin countries do it
By Allah milk doesn't belong in tea
Sweet tea is the only type of tea I drink
6:29 steph’s mom instincts kickin in right there
Thank God he got a British person in there
As for why milk on bottom tastes different than milk on top it is because with milk on top you are scolding more of the milk than you do with milk on the bottom. Same reason why you do not add liquid egg to a hot liquid. You will curdle the egg. But you will not curdle the egg if the hot liquid is added to it.
You forgot about the sugar one lump or two or possibly more
Personally I enjoy 1 min brew loose leaf without milk, so- I support your thoughts MatPat!
I agree with Matt on the milk in tea
She really can't rinse her mug and reuse it for the day?
but what about what type of milk? whole? 1%? 2%? almond? soy? coconut? rice? pea? cashew? lactose-free? a combination
Do lactose and non-lactose make a difference? I'm lactose intolerant, and these two milk types are clearly different, so will this difference affect the "perfect tea"?
Only 4 cups a day, those are rookie numbers for someone who drinks iced tea. I drink like a gallon a day
Never heard of adding milk to tea
Why not microwave the water? I've seen you two cook scallops in the dryer -- I don't think tea with microwaved water would be a road too far for this taste test... :)
Stef'x pins were way better than yours Matt.  Just saying.
STEPH  SAYING "WOW WOW WOW" IS TIGHT
This video proved I make tea right. 😀... But then I am British 😛
You didn’t make “british tea” putting milk in tea originated in thailand
Am I weird for making tea with just hot milk
Just came to check if anyone yelled about them not pre-heating the tea pot... 😅 Boil kettle, full tea pot, fill kettle, boil kettle, tip out tea pot, put boiled water in tea pot with tea. Makes a great tea, but also why I usually shove my loose tea doofer in a mug and go.  Also one of the great things about tea is everyone likes it different and it's super easily customisable! Everyone's tea taste is valid and accepted.  Except TikTok lady's. That was odd.
best milk is no milk i would say also
I got yapoun holly in my yard, sweet wild caffeine leaves
I use one coffee cup I always keep full, i go through about 2L of coffee a day
I don't have a teapot, so i have to use the microwave.
3:07 that's has meme potencial
At what step do we add sweetener if preferred, and what form of sweetener should we add (liquid or solid)?
15:46 happy bouncy 😆
As an Asian who loves tea, this video has made my day. Thank you Matpat
oh come on you cant recommend not to use the microwave and not even test it
Is it possible that the glass cup was also hottest since it was pre-heated twice when filling the other two?  I wonder if Spiff would have something to say about his episode.
Me this whole video "so they're gonna throw it into a body of water right"
This is such great Food Tea-ry! Ok so I've a question after actually seeing the video. What kind of milk? Half and half? Whole? 2%?
It sounds like you just got an Australian cup of tea. I've never seen anyone go milk first and the milk volume here is more than 5ml
6:29 the betrayal in his eyes.
"there's a weird sour note" Yeah, because you're fucking scalding the milk.
How about experimenting on chinese Kungfu Tea to see if any of the extra steps makes any difference and not just a etiquette. The same can be tested for Japanese matcha making.
Why can no one see that "tiktok tea" was a troll
I’m British and tbf we put the milk on top mostly anyway
3-4 cups? Them's rookie numbers, gotta up it to 3-4 pots
I do not like milk in my tea
Sharing cups in the covid Era is love. They must have really good healthy insurance + vaccine and boosters
Can you do this but for green tea?
So much drinking from the same mugs... *~shudder~* Can never bring myself to drink after others. It just seems so...gross. The lack of Yorkshire Tea is also disturbing.
Whooo wtf deja vu with Stepfh talking about the multiverse, wasn’t that in. Video?
Well, now I need to find a brand of tea that uses pyramidal tea bags to try this. I also need to buy a kettle. I want to taste just how good this tea is now that MatPat has spilled it.
i, a british person, have always done milk last. anything else is incorrect
Yeah... where did the UK get their tea from?
For me, yea, sugar, milk. Boom
Surgar...?
Wait you actually put MILK in your tea?
I'm with Matpat. No tea should ever have milk  in it.
You are doing it the British way by putting milk on top you only put it in the bottom of you brew the tea in a pot first. As you're cooling the brew first. The standard British builders tea you out the milk in last if you make it in the mug and you didn't try it in a polystyrene cup
interesting...
while i am not going to dispute how to make tea i am hating how they decided microwave over stovetop. They didn't make the same tea with both experiments they just made the obviously bad tea in the microwave and made the good tea on the stove which does not prove which boiling method is better.
Even as a non tea drinker, I enjoyed the video and I just wanna add that I really enjoy Steph in all your videos. Every time she’s in a Theorist video she’s always insightful and very funny. I’ve seen YouTubers bring their spouses in on videos before and a lot of times it’s awkward and uncomfortable but Steph always is so cool in these videos. Thanks for the amazing content.
As a southerner this feels slanderous
Savages tap water? Nah filtered water always and nothing beats fresh tea  leaves
Ok I agree with Matt no milk what so ever unless it's a milk tea like boba or Thai tea. But also I disagree with how they did the loose leaf. That metal ball isn't good, get a tea press. Essentially a french press but for tea.
As a 2-6 cups of tea person myself this is just giving me joy
How much sugar do you put in tea
5:22 You say that like there is something wrong with being content. It's what the british tea is best made for, relaxing; taking a couple moments to not be stressed or complaining. To simply be content.
Is the Christmas tree cookies coming back this year? 🎄
Only the Brits would think "Wow this LEAF WATER is too intense, I should add some milk"
The reason the milk tastes "off" when you add it first is because it allows more time for the milk to CURDLE as a result of the heat and tannins!  As such, adding it at the end means that the milk stays smoother!
Correct me if I’m wrong but I didn’t think many Americans put milk in our tea? I just put sugar in it
I have my tea no milk no sugar and super strong.... guess Im a heretic.
so i actually tried this,  and this might be how i make my tea from now on lmao
The best tea is suthern sweet tea.
I’m British-Irish and I have NEVER met someone who puts milk in first that would be heresy!  2 teaspoons of sugar in a nice bone china mug first.  Loose Leaf in a teapot.  Add boiled water from a kettle or pot on the hob.  Brew for 2 minutes and mix so you get all the extra tannins.  Add a small splash if milk.  Extra strong, Extra sweet, and just the right temperature.  Enjoy with a chocolatey biscuit whilst watching the Great British Bake-off.  Quids in! 👍
You are missing one variable that I use every time I make my tea: honey. It soothes your throat when stirred in, but to avoid it being too sweet I squeeze the teabag after brewing it for 3 and a half minutes. Milk is inferior, and I refuse to put it in my tea. Even Matpat agrees with me here. Anyways, I am still making my tea with honey until you disprove me.  EDIT: Yes I use a kettle. I am not a monster!
This tea knowledge is gonna come in handy for me in the next 5 minutes. Thanks for helping improve our tea drinking experience. Also I'm kind of surprised a video all about tea made no references to tea fanatic Uncle Iroh from Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Steph should be in more videos. Just saying
so here is some more tea snobbish stuff for you:  tap water is chlorinated, this can effect the taste of water, so is distilled, mineral added, cholorinated, meneral water, or filtered river water the best water. then you have to consider skim, 1%, 2%, whole, almond, Goat, horse, or ... human.
You used the glass 'cup' to fill the other two... that might have made it hotter because it had three times the amount of hot water going through it so it was hotter to begin with.
You should have figured out the optimal amunt of sugar
Can you do Indian tea next? I am curious about it. They don't use leaves in the tea
Well I hate tea, so non of this applies to me
What about the type of honey?
14:40 Mat I'm dissapointed you didn't call it a tetraTEAdron
I'm most definitely sharing this with my friend who is almost as avid as a tea drinker as Steph! I'm not a fan of tea, but she loves it, and I don't understand why she goes for hot leaf juice as a first choice.   Also, I agree with Matt, milk does not belong in tea at all XD
Y'all are forgetting the most advanced technique. Using a coffee maker.
Meanwhile Asians are disappointed at Matt for barely mentioning them and their thousands of years of tea history vs the English few hundred.
As an American who doesn't like tea (or at least I haven't found one I like yet)...  Drink whatever you want. Try new stuff but if you like your drink, just keep drinking it. Enjoy it. Who cares what anyone else thinks, they can make their own tea
Unlike you I have a sophisticated palate and I enjoy the taste of tannins that's why I like dark red wine cabernet sauvignon... I always squeeze my tea bag.
Now it’s time to make gaels perfect coffee maker from breaking bad
Where is the Spiffing Brit. He should have simply materialized.
U should have the British guy In more episodes
*Sips my Sweet Tea by the gallon* This is what peak performance looks like.
What about honey or sugar? Do they play a part
I'd say that method of hearing the water would be a good criteria to test as well. Microwave, stovetop, electric kettle, whatever else you can think of.
A metal cup would have changed the flavor for the same reason it does beer.
When I make tea 🍵 I take a pyramid shaped pg tips tea bag shake it put it in the mug add sugar let it brew squeeze it then add a splash of milk I like tea coffee and hot chocolate
Me over here drinking peppermint tea straight.. no milk, nor sugar…
The Brit talks a big game, but he can’t figure out how to open a simple bag. Here’s a helpful hint for those that don’t know: the tops and bottoms of bags like that are serrated, meaning just grab the bag near the middle with one hand and with the other, pinch near the corner and rip down. The serrations make easy ripping points. It is literally what they are there for. I know some packaging can be easily torn down the seam, but not all. EVERY ONE IS MADE TO RIP DOWN THOSE SERRATIONS EASILY.   You’re welcome.
I make my tea by in this order Tea bag, sugar, boiled water wait 1~2 minutes, put in milk, take the bag out and enjoy
I have never made tea in the microwave. If anything, boil the water on the stove. It’s like 2 minutes slower
For anyone who has made tea with a microwave, how do you manage to burn your hands? Don't you just take it by the handle or do the handles on some mugs get hot throughout the process?
I didn't know triangle tea bags existed! Will have to try them now.
Tea with milk (or for that matter, oatmeal with milk) still sounds bizarre to me no matter how many times I hear it.
How about not adding milk at all... I mean I didn't even know people add milk... I just drink some Earl Grey with 2 small spoons of sugar or honey. I tried it with milk... that stuff is undrinkable to me!  Edit: 13:37 MAT PAT THANK YOU. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS IT
MatPat is GOAT!! No milk best milk!!
"Seriously she drinks like 3-4 cups a day!"  *me pushing my 11th cup today out of sight in shame* 😂
Me: looks at mugs MAS Massachusetts  Boston Boston Tea Party???
I find it weird people put milk in tea that doesn't sound good
you are all wrong its southern sweet tea, sugar, lemon, tea , and sun.
Me putting milk in tea for the first time to see if it is actually worth it. In my opinion   ...meh.
TEMPERATURE!!!  Ya put coffee in 100 degree water it'll go bitter. You aim for circa 80 degrees. How does that affect tea?
I actually did not know one was supposed to add milk to tea. No wonder it didn't taste right without some sugar.
Some objective falsehoods in this video. Saying you need to use an electric kettle for instance is just objectively false. The only part which matters is control of the heat of the tea.
anyone else bothered by them dunking the tea into hot water instead of pouring the water over the tea leaves?????
What about the type of milk you're putting in? Whole milk, 2%, 1%, skim milk? I don't know anything about tea, so I don't know if there's a standard for what type of milk you use in tea.
Food theory be like Let's anylise and do algebra with vegetables Hahahah this guy has to be the smartest person online
Hot chocolate
You should do tea part 2: tap water vs reverse osmosis water.  You'll be shocked.
Like everyone else in the comments I’m British but my only comment is is 3-4 cups of tea a day a large amount my dog drinks more tea then that a day
Not one Uncle Iroh reference. I'm disappointed.
Mmmm hot leaf soup
They forgot something they should have tried diffrent versions of milk
17:20 shouldnt the animation be the other way around with the milk on top kicking the milk on bottom away? 😅
I love tea ☕️ finally a food theory episode made for me
As a Brit, not one person I know puts milk in first. That tradition was toppled long ago, my friends.
Im dispointed  in you for not testing fine leaf tea for coarse vs whole leaf shame.
... Tea is so easy to make Well and I don't see how Americans typically seem to have trouble with it 😂  Tea of choice (who cares, it'll taste the same anyways?) Sugar (optional. Any more than 2 teaspoons is instant diabetes and you will be incessantly mocked for your crimes against humani-tea ) Hot water until you have about half an inch of cup left (less room left if you choose to use a larger vessel, as one always should) Steep for ~3 mins Fill rest of drinking vessel with milk until either safe carrying limit is reached or desired colour of tea has been achieved.  Bonus points if you use the classic Sports Direct "mug".... (steph would probably have a heart attack when she finds out she could drink all 4 cups of tea at once).   Less scientific, but far more standard at least in the mythical Midlands 😂
I demand coffee edition now as I hate tea 😂
YES! MY METHOD IS SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED ALONG WITH THE BRAND OF TEA I ACTUALLY LIKE!  so, i'll try and keep it to TL;DR shortness, but, the way i have always doen it is as follows: Bag in mug first (don't drink enough to warrant a teapot) Then Water (steeping can vary a lot) Milk In To Obtain Optimum Colour Bag out (i know i shouldn't squeeze it but i always do, too satisfying) and voila, the base tea, if you want sugar you add that after you have your base done,doing it pre-milk kills it, and especially doing it pre water kills it, it has to wait till the bag is gone, that way you get more control as by the time sugar comes you are more alert to get your specific right amount rather than just dumping it in first not thinking about it  also, never put coke in tea, tried it once as i know it has a lot of sugar in it thinking it'd work to sweeten it and i couldn't find or get any sugar at the time, NOPE, just makes it horrid, like imagine eating a lime slice on its own, while lime is nice you don't want that rind flavour.  Also for any none-UK peeps reading this, i like PG Tips, it started because of the funny monkey, johnny vegas and the Dog The Myth The Legend Gromit Mugs, but i genuinly won't get anything else these days, all other teas taste off in some way
See okay, but you've completely ignored adding sugar! I make my tea in basically the "optimal" way: hot water, steep for 3+ minutes (I actually really like the stronger flavor), add sugar while the bag is still in and stir, bag out, milk in. And that's probably going to annoy people. XD
My parents did a Russian way as in we put in tea bag or whatever in pot of water and bring boil and let it sit and then pour in cup and may add sugar or honey but usually just have with lemon. It makes tea bags last longer or great for making ice tea later. It does make a stonger tea. I also like making Chinese way with leaves.   I love how different cultures and family make tea or coffee. Also my older sister loves Thai tea.   Also usually used glass mugs. Also used lose tea sometimes in fun metal tea holders one shaped like fish or acorn lol
I put coffee cream I'm my tea. It's delicious.   Welp! Time for everyone to hate me!
What about Japanese tea method?
How about the difference in 2% and whole milk??
W PAT DOGGING ON BRITISH PEOPLE, WOOOOOO MAKING FUN OF THE BRITISH WOOOO
I think pre-heating your cup as the measuring vessel probably made the biggest difference here.
I am an absolute tea snob. I love pure green tea. Adagio is where I buy all my tea so it's like a vacuum for my money
Hot take, Indian tea is best tea
May I suggest you try condensed milk with your tea?
Personally, while I do like hot tea on occasion, the vast majority of tea I drink is American sweet tea served cold.  And I steep mine for a LONG time, making it very strong and sweeten it quite low compared to the stuff I've bought pre-bottled.  It does help I make two gallons at a time using a condensed brew and watering it down to two gallons.  I also prefer not to ice it and let it chill in the fridge, but will if I don't have a choice, the flavor changes with ice.
Fun fact use room temp milk over cold milk I promise it tastes better.
How proper geezer does it: 1. Cup 2. Bag in cup 3.Kettle 4.Pour 5. Ster 6. Bag in bin 7. Drink
You mentioned that cups would get the taste of previous cups... over time. Living with a bunch of tea drinkers, I have seen of a lot of the ceramics start to change colours. So it may hold true for a cup with 5+ years of extended use.
If there's one thing I've learned from baking, it's that in the kitchen, everything makes a difference.  Every little thing.
Mext week yall gotta do real tea. Southern US style sweet iced tea
u put milk in tea? i always was told to put sugar if i want it sweeter
I’d love to see a video like this, but about root beer floats. Test how different brands of root beer and ice cream mix together, whether it’s better to put the ice cream or the root beer first, etc.
and the perfect tea couldnt be just the british way
I like my British tea steeped in Boston Harbor
Hey guys, I know you're American and all, but 3-4 cups of tea or coffee is a slow morning in many countries.  Keep it up though, you'll get there ☕
I like sun tea, is that tea?  Coffee please.
I want to see a sequel video where you switch out milk for sugar and honey, since those are both common sweeteners, as well as having different kinds of tea as well, just to see if there would be a difference or not
Is tea soup? You leave plants and meat in boiling water with some spices to basically make any soup, that means if you do basically the same without meat and adding sweeteners like sugar or honey into boiling water you make tea, so basically it has to be the same because it's the same way done, you put stuff into boiling water and cook it out to make the water taste funky.  Another question:Is Smoothie stew? Smoothie is basically fruits and vegetables shredded down to a goopy drinkable substance. Stews are Also vegetables that get shredded down and cooked and served as a goopy substance. Before you say smoothie doesn't gets cooked, stews get served cold or even cooked without adding any heat, like cucumber stew that has variants to its recipe(I personally prefer to make it hot and eat it warm, even though most people prefer it cooled down idk why). Anyway, Smoothie is like the Variant of cucumber stew where you basically shred down your food, don't cook it and have your smoothie, but cucumber stew is stew. So why is smoothie smoothie and not stew? Before you say because most smoothies have fruits and vegetables while stews only have vegetables, Pumpkins are per Definition No vegetables because they have seeds, same goes for cucumbers, because they are also pumpkin plants. So this rule doesn't actually apply to stew. So smoothie is in fact cold cooked and served stew.  And now the most important question of the internet, is cereal soup?  Some soups are liquids that get cooked and then stuff gets added like Pho. Milk gets cooked to 60°c because bacteria needs to be killed, that's called pasteurisation and you rarely have milk packages that don't have the "pasteurized" label on them because it's (at least in my country) a requirement to do so(or write down if it isn't pasteurized, but about no market actually sells that super fresh milk) so that applies to cereal. Some soups also get served cold and added stuff to them, like Cereal. You add either your milk to the cereal like a logical thinking intelligent individual or you add your cereal to the milk, but the way you add which ingredient doesn't actually change it being soup because see how pho gets served:You take your rice noodles, vegetables and meat and then add the steaming hot broth on it to cook the ingredients, so you have to add the ingredients first to cook them. So basically cereal is soup defined by all arguments I just thought of while writing this comment.  Please make a food theory on this though because atp this is the most important question to be answered. I need a whole episode that defines when something is tea, soup, stew, smoothie or cereal and what makes it that, but the most important part is finally answering THE question fr.
I love tea, give me a fist pump Stephanie, we buds
Some say that this video was a bit tea tea-dious
Matt's right about the milk.  I do indulge in the occasional milk tea when I'm in the mood for something sweet to drink; but when I want traditional tea, I don't want milk.
Its not taking the factor of the water itself. Where the water is sourced, if filtered, what particulates are in the water, and temp of water makes difference in osmosis and steeping.
But there is an option that was neglected. What if you pour half the tea, then add the milk, then the remainder of the tea? I'm not saying its an efficient option, but an option nonetheless
Man, tea in milk is just like chocolate pizza. Doesnt fit
why just do British tea ? there is all sorts of teas from around the world , you can show how each one matters in different ways, some religions or countries dont even use milk have a different pouring method and even steeping method as while ot get certain flavors look at al ltypes of asian teas too  japn china and india all have a wide sortment of teas fro mhot to even one for colds and remedies as well
And if there small green leaves from canada you know what to do ;)
Can you do green tee next?
Um.  That last test, you were using the glass mug to dole out hot water to the other two, preheating the glass making it lose less heat for the steep.
Proceeds to drop tea leaves as MatPat says "leave"
You missed something regarding the vessels. The color of the cup also changes the flavor. If I’m not mistaken red taste best
Bro I thought y’all were in NC I feel like anything but sweet tea is blasphemy here
Steph has a fucking 6th sense for spilled loose leaf tea lol
16:43 is that senku's face on that flask
I usually add 1/3 of a cup of milk in my tea (but with more flavors)
Good to know I've been drinking my tea the correct way.
I saw the title of this episode made some bed time tea and grabbed a blanket..
In the first thirty second it’s come to my attention that MatPat doesn’t like tea
Interested on a how many teaspoons of sugar test
This came at a perfect time, since I was thinking of drinking tea again
🙂👍
that entire place sucks, it's like ohio as a country (france is ohio as a country and bisexual)
Not minute enough, Matpat. You should have tested using different types of water as well, such as distilled vs natural, straight from the spring water vs tap water.
Would uranium glass make a difference 🤣🤣 Also, would it?...
And I'm sitting here, sipping my herbal tea.(It's good!)
I'm like five minutes in, and I'm thinking ... the tea bag needs to be in hot liquid to steep.  The milk is cold, so it's going to impede the tea from releasing flavor, right?  I can't possibly imagine how this is a good idea.  Of course, the amount of milk I put in my hot tea is zero, so what do I know?
the thing is, I was watching this while drinking tea.
Now we need to protect matpat from the angry Brits.
Oh I've never heard of adding milk in my tea? I should try it.... obviously I'm not British
Why would you put tea in the microwave...
The thing about the hotter tea cup is that it subverts the reason for pouring the milk on top. When the tea hits the cup it cools a bit, so it doesn't cook the milk as much when the milk is added.
YES  I Speak For The People When I Say  WE LOVE TOM WE WANT MORE TOM TOM IS GOOD!!!
Milk has no business in tea end of discussion
But the question is, why are you putting milk in tea
i personally make my tea by putting in my tea, putting hot water in, waiting, taking tea bag out, putting in honey, then splenda (to your taste!) then put in your choice of creamer and sip. Hope this isnt too terrible or blasphemous :)
I understand the "M" and "S" mugs but what does the "A" mug mean??????
From what I'm understand not many Americans have a separate thing where you just heat up water in a kettle is usually just heated of the water in the microwave cuz it's the quickest and easiest option.
Disappointed you didn't test disposable cups. I doubt it would have been better, but for the sake of thoroughness I think it should have been included.
Meanwhile, Japanese teens and otakus watching this be like, "I-i-i-indirect kissu!"
Dang British people.
5:58 Answer: optional
I don't drink british tea... I drink tea made in a completely different way than both british and americans...
I’ve never been so invested in learning about tea 😂
But what about using a teabag in a teapot? Or adding more milk to an overbrewed tea? Less milk to an underbrewed tea? Sugar vs honey? How about lemon? Kettle on the stove vs electric kettle?
Indeed the correct opinion
MatPat is such a *tease*
Best tea: Ice Cold Sweet Tea  2 cups of sugar per gallon minimum.
Matpat, i am so disappointed in you. If you truly did your research, you would've considered the Indian tea, or what some might call "chai". Afterall the origin place of tea is India. You sir have completely ignored our country. I hope you notice this some day, but even if you did, i am pretty sure you won't acknowledge this Bharat mata ki jay 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I was just about to make my cuppa and decided to check out what I was doing wrong first. Turns out not a lot, but the one place I did change things was the bag shape. I use flat bags because that is what my favourite tea comes in. So a quick hack. By pinching the sides of the flat bag and pulling them outward, I was able to create a rhomboid shape (like two square pyramids with their bottoms connected or a d8 if you Tabletop RPGs) and then used those to make my tea. I have to say, the difference was amazing. So don't despair if your bags are flat, just pull the sides out so they form a rhomboid giving the leaves plenty of room inside the bag, and then get to steeping!
We use concentrated milk(or or highly viscous sweetened milk) with our tea. I think we need to update the statistics of people getting Type-2 Diabetes again
...... Well, never drink tea in Britain. I apparently have horrible taste. Too much milk and adding sugar....
6:11 The one on the top right is my fav :)
I'm with MatPat on the milk. Best milk in tea is none.
Lemme defend the microwave for a minute- sometimes it’s the only thing available to boil water. Our stove is broken, we’re broke, and for a long time we just couldn’t allocate money for an electric kettle until recently. So, it doesn’t seem as “fancy”, but it still gets the job done. The tea will be hot regardless.
How is the Food Theory already at over 4 millions subs??! The last time I checked it was only 1.14 million-   I am so glad food is being handled by such a seriously and scientifically dedicated grasp by Matpat.
The spiffing brit is gonna be mad
I completely agree; best milk is no milk. Personally, I like the bitter flavor from steeping tea 'too long', as it and the bitter flavor of the stevia I use cancel out and make it perfect. Of course, my tea vessel is probably a little out there: a no-longer-thermal water bottle.
“Did he just call tea warm leaf wat-“ “ I’m more invested in the puns-“
Yeah now i know boiling the tea out of  the   filter and then  filtering the tea after making it is the better option
Loose tea is most often far superior to bag tea.  I'm not a tea snob, I'm an AMERICAN TEA SNOB the very worse of the worse tea makers. I use a bottom diffuse teapot. I actually own 3. They can be difficult to clean.
I’m from Canada I like maple syrup 🙃
They should be using Yorkshire Tea Gold
So what I've been doing for years is now a clock app thing?.  <×< leave my microwave boiled water alone clock app. I just boil the water.     tea bags, sugar and milk are added after. And also filtered lol
I'm British and would never put the milk in first, though partly that's because I always brew my tea in the mug, and you definitely want to brew/steep the tea first before you add milk, rather than trying to brew tea in a mixture of water and milk, which is why vending machine tea is awful. Another reason for milk on top is because you should add the sugar to the hot tea before you cool it down with the milk, so that the sugar can more easily disolve through the tea, meaning you use less sugar to gain the same amount of sweetness, and you don't end up with left over sugary mush in the bottom of the cup after you have drunk your tea.
4:42 When a ceramic item says it is not microwavable safe it means taht you will burn yourself taking it out. It wasn't to preserve the decorations on the plate or cup but your skin. The iron content in non microwavable ceramics with heat up with the microwaves an therefore make the cup itself hot. So your moms precious Garden Rooster Pfasltzgraff dining-ware is able to go in the microwave. Just make sure you are careful.
Getting to the end of this video and this is more or less how I make my tea anyways so I was just ahead of the game when it came to measuring the milk I just did it based on colour depending on how much tea I'd make.
"The British are coming, the British are coming!"
Brits do put milk on top, there's shock horror if someone puts milk first
Hi
You guys put milk in it?? Is my state just weird??
I don’t understand why people like coffee it’s just bitter and gross.
missed opportunity to collaborate with the spiffing brit
I am with you… The exact perfect amount of milk in tea is zero.
Tea is gross
My dad was telling me a story about how his Asian coworker brought whole leaf green tea from home and just threw em in with no bag or infuser and added the water  Now that’s the only way he drinks tea now
Why would anyone ruin a perfect cup of tea with milk?!
No one puts milk in first here I've seen fights break out for less...
I already have a problem with this on the first test. What psychopaths are sitting around waiting for their tea to steep? Just watching a cup of hot water? I always use a spoon to press and squeeze my tea bag and then burn my fingers a little at the end when I pinch the bag to get out any extra tea juice. It takes a fraction of the time and your tea should get just as strong not matter the bag. How is this not common sense? Edit: I'm sorry, squeezing the tea bag makes it worse now? I challenge you to do it my way food theory and see your slight for what it is!
Can of Arizona Sweet Tea... done
I love tea so much! 🫖🍵 This is my favorite episode of Food Theory!
marking things off as a business expense is TIGHT
Steph: "I drink at least 4 cups a day" Me, a Brit: "I drink 4 mugs for breakfast" Seriously. I have a 1 pint mug and I'll have 3 to 4 of those before I leave for work. Also... No real Brit adds milk first these days. Heck. Most of us use tea dust teabags and brew in the mug by adding water and beating the teabag for 20 seconds. Also... 12-15ml of milk is the sweet spot.
Milk first was due to how easily the old porcelain cups would crack or shatter. Adding milk first would help temper the cup. Until bone china came into use.  Also you forgot to warm the pot!
take my likes!
Most of this just seemed like what I would expect logically. Especially milk on top or bottom, just thinking about the difference in density of a cold liquid as compared to a warm one. Warmer liquids are less density and just will rise to the top and along the way naturally mixing with the colder liquid, where as colder liquids will sit on the bottom and not mix as well. It's a pretty common science experiment in schools.
Milk in the middle of the tea!
As a Chinese person i say bs lol
Here’s how I make tea.  Gallon Tea bag, water. Boil just till bubbles  Put 1.8 cups of sugar into bottom of pitcher Put in fridge till cools Pros: Taste good, Last some time Cons: If you do it wrong you’ll get tea leaves in the bottom of your pitcher
I just drank tea, its a signal
Matpat is right. No milk in tea.
Only lady grey needs milk, the rest are better withouth
If you go to China, or India, or anywhere else, you will get noticeably different opinions on tea. Just because the Brits took it doesn't mean their standard is THE standard.
I'm British that literally the way I make my tea anyway and milk always goes on top only thing that made me mad was it wasn't Yorkshire Tea British #1 tea
It's not warm leaf water, it's hot leaf juice. 😂😂
I think you need a bigger infuser. Those clamp ball kinds never let my tea breathe enough, so I get basket types that sit in the mug and give the leaves almost full freedom, then you just pull the whole basket out. Also you didn't mention anything about preheating any of the vessels? That can make a lot of difference in temperatures, especially if you're steeping in that mug/pot with water boiled in a separate kettle.  Its bad science if you didn't take the vessels stealing heat from the water into account.
you missed the round tea bags
I’m a tea GOD
Perfect sweet tea: 1.hot water poured over tea bags 2.add sugar & mix 3. Add cold water until almost full 4. Mix again. Perfect pitcher of sweet tea
For a brief moment I thought they actually were going to get the spiffing Brit to guest on this episode LOL
Man 8-BitRyan will be furious.
as a british person, i have never in my entire life seen anybody put milk on the bottom, or even actually use a teapot really.
Toy theory
Mats cup of tea needs to be erased from memory
BOBA TEA >>>>>>>>>>>>>> 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Tom is an impostor Brit. I don't know a single person that puts the milk in first.
Now its time for COFFEE testing!? Please
i am an american. i like putting a loose tea bag in a coffee pot and letting it boil for a few minutes, then i put honey and some sugar all in a large ceramic mug i own. i am usually a coffee brewer but i dont mind tea every once in awhile
Um warm leaf water. . . I think you mean Hot Leaf Juice  Uncle Iroh FTW
I wonder how SpiffingBrit would exploit tea making to achieve the best cup of Yorkshire tea.
You’re not alone Mat! No milk is the best milk!
I don't Drink tea w/ milk. Sugar cubes or sometimes honey.
How is heating water in the microwave different from on a stove or electric kettle?
You saying the British way is the right way is kinda funny as my British grandma makes it that way. Pour the water into the mug with the teabag (though she isn't strict about type of teabag), add sugar if desired while the tea is hot, and add a small amount of milk on top.
No metal cup, like a copper cup? 😞
My grandmother-in-law always makes me put the milk in first because putting it in last "scalds the milk" xD
Who drinks tea with milk? Try subbing that out for a bit of honey.
Kermit the frog on the thumbnail made me proud.…….                                                                                                   I am Kermit the frog.
Milk in last is the way I have always done it in the UK and the best way
My inner southerner says sweet tea is best
im in the 'NO MILK' camp - I wish to taste the TEA not cow juice
Omg who ever pours the water, in the cup, then the milk and then microwave it then I will immediately consider stabbing them
There's been some reports lately about the plastic content of those pyramid bags, and that steeping with those is causing us to digest plastic in our tea. The paper ones are apparently also affected by this, since some companies use a plastic based glue to help keep the bags closed.
Milk isnt suppose to be in tea
I actually would've loved to see one more test in this to see if it made any difference: Microwaved water vs stove-top kettle vs electric kettle? So many other small changes had an effect, maybe this would've as well.
Now that you know how to make tea the right way, don't forget to pay your proper tea tax.
Okay, British here. Firstly you’ve not tested sugar and when that should go in, part 2? Next, a true Brit would already know that a teapot makes it colder faster. Also surprise surprise most Brits do add the milk last in the younger generations and just do it into a mug where as the older generations use a tea pot and add the milk in the cups. I believe this comes from the older generation getting it how it comes whereas the younger generations are very picky. Everyone I know takes their tea differently and won’t drink it if it’s not right. If you offer a tea in Britain at your house it is most polite to ask how do you like it, with a polite response being “are you sure? I’ll make it, okay then … in the mug, weak/strong a splash/lot/no milk  and number/no sugar.” Anymore than 5 sugars then you must make it yourself as you cannot admit it to people. I’d do a survey for people asking where do you live (USA:state name, county name or UK: country name, county name) how do you take your tea: milk sugar strength. And what method do you use. Also you touched on shape but not brand and it’s be interesting to see your reaction to the differences in tea bag brands, I know people who’ve turned down tea due to the brand they buy.
All parts of an Avacado plant have a chemical called Persin in, which is toxic to cats, so please don't let your cat be drinking that water regularly or ingesting any part of the plant.
What about sugar? Is there a right way to add that?
It also comes down to just personal preference, 3 people ain't no definitive evidence  And only 3 data points on milk amounts
No uncle Iroh, no Spiffing Brit...what massive mistakes have y'all missed. Blasphemy.
it's simple! tea bag in followed by hot water add milk and sugar stir clockwise remove tea bag. easy
the video contained no info about unhealthy side of adding milk to a tea. i'm disappointed
This video triggered some traumatic honors biology flashbacks 😭
I am American and I have to say this was cool
Just got done drinking green mint tea before I watched this
Only 3 to 4? So I must be crazy to drink around 6 to 8 depending on the tea. And I'm not counting the gongfu way of brewing I mean the wester way lol 😆
13:41 Matt is 100% right on this one.
So going a bit deeper into the milk part. How well stirred in the milk is can also alter the flavour of the beverage
Or just drink Iced Sweet Tea... Like a good southern person....
Gamer Tea Bath Water
Adding milk first only works if the tea is brewed in a pot, the tea bag should never touch the milk.
I always use sugar, not milk, with my tea
Never used mifal. Amateurs.
That’s an awfully hot…….anyone?
I quite frankly didn't know people put milk in tea.
What about iced tea or iced tea lattes?  When I make the latter, I make a tea concentrate first ... about 2L of boiling hot water poured over 8 tea bags under 0.5L of sugar.  Then I leave it to steep ... often overnight (it's usually cold).  Then I squeeze the drippings out of the tea bags back into the concentrate and put it in the fridge.  Then before serving, I combined 100 ml of tea / sugar concentrate with 400 ml of cold milk.
Great vid but one thing I thought that they would also test is water temp cause depending one the heat would change the taste no?
11:59 that film is lessened if you are using clean water aka one that’s gone though a water filter to remove stuff like calcium that can turn into limescale in your kettle as you boil it.  The water around here is extremely heavy aka full of calcium that leaches in from the rocks, we have to descale our kettle every few weeks or so to stop it from damaging the thing, it also hits the showers and taps (when I was taken in earlier this year one of the taps started to form a stalactite, I was only down for a month with C19)
You should do ‘what food is the most aerodynamic?’ For Kindergarten 2
Kinda jaded that other types of brewing methods werent included. Like turkish samowar or hot sand brewing.
I really hope yall warmed up the milk a little bit
Don’t you British people go think we forgot about British bake off 🇲🇽👀
One other variable: adding the tea to hot water vs putting the tea in the mug first then pouring in the hot water
Steph:  I drink three or four cups a day.  Me:  (after drinking roughly a half gallon so far today)  That's adorable.
Working at a tea shop right now and ooh this video emotions, Both good and complicated ones
Matt is wrong. While I don't put milk in my tea because lactose intolerant, I do put non-dairy creamer in as a replacement.
But mattpat and co, I like my tea dark and bitter. Especially if I’m adding sugar, honey, or other additives.
Millions of Asians are crying, why are you putting milk in tea
I pop my tea bag in the water and then microwave. IDK how kettles work--don't have one and don't really care to have one--but microwave but 1-2min in the microwave taste good enough to me, so. Despite the state of my microwave (I think it's damaged from that one time I microwaved a grape and the few other times I wanted to melt some butter hh), it doesn't come out tasting funny.  I think it's weird that they put milk in it, let alone on top after microwaving the water and before setting in the bag lmao 😭No really a milk fan. Probably because there's a 50% chance I explode. My digestive track is volatile. The exploding applies to just about anything I can eat, not just milk. I think I should see a GI lmao. I do like bubble tea though, and my fave milk alternative is oatmilk, specifically Chobani extra creamy.  And I love pyramid bags! The shape is just so fun. Cool to know they are at the top of the tea preppyramid aha.
Nothing beats a good ol' glass jar of UN(!)sweet iced tea with a splash of lemon
was almost convinced they were doing a collab with spiff on tea
I wonder what uncle Iroh wouldve said
“The dish washer is full of tea cups” Me thinking he was making a dark joke about Steph:
I wish you had done a metal cup aswell in the last test
Ha...sweaTEA...
He compares all parameters but doesn't compare the amount of water to steep the tea bads in lol Aka the ratio of tea to water
Its killin me, as a British person i have never known someone to put milk in the cup first, its always been milk after tea
title: your tea SUCKS! Me who already made tea almost exactly like this:
BOSTON TEA PARTY  XD
Hey Matpat I think y’all got the graphics backwards 17:20.
"This tea is nothing more than hot leaf Juice!"
Anyone who makes tea using a tea bag and zero aromatic spices like cinnamon is in the same boat as microwave lady.
Thank you matpat after watching this video I made the best tea I've ever had in my life and converted a non tea drinker with the perfect cup of tea
6:35 made me spit out my tea 😭🤣🍵
I think you need to specify that the British are big for MILK Tea, there are a lot of places that have more non-milk Tea (China, eg)
Whilst this is a great episode, I’m just here appreciating the Boston Tea Party joke 😂 it was very well timed
I make my tea like this… I boil water in a kettle… Pour the hot water into a cup… And then put a few teaspoons of sugar into it… Stir… Wait a bit… And I’m done.
My wife was happy to see Steph getting a positive video experience. In her words "That woman is a saint for putting up with Matpat, he made her eat trees!"
the only good tea is cold and sweet
I agree with Mat: best milk is no milk in the tea
My perfect tea is, using a kettle, honey (instead of sugar), and NO MILK
And then there’s us southerners, who make gallons of tea at a time and dump cups of sugar in it
As a Chinese, all of this hurt me, we don't put milk in tea at all. We just drink tea. Now they just drinking boba
Now how do we feel about boiling water in a Keurig with no pod?
If talking about tea you guys should try the Indian version its the best tea in the World chai is India's love after all
MILK IN TEA??? nahhh i only drink my tea like i drink my liquor .. neat
This just makes me want to see MatPat and Steph try Mate cocido from Argentina: store bought bag vs  traditional yerba mate draining method
The correct opinion indeed!
im British and I’ve decided to NEVER have tea for 16 years now. It’s funny to see peoples reaction here.
So the best way to make tea is the way we (the brits) already do it?
For the love of god, why didn't you use transparent mugs?! I want to see the results as well, mate!
I never add milk to my cups, tho a teapsoon of honey instead
As a British enjoyer of tea, I found this incredibly interesting. Thanks a lot, guys. 🎶  It would be awesome if you could cover another staple of British culture: What’s the best thing to eat when you have a hangover?
You didn't test the type of milk.  Skim, 2%, whole milk, cream...?
Within 5 hours!
As a US southern, This is all wrong. Sweet tea with 0 milk is the correct answer.   Just Joking of course.
So... Can we expect a Food Theory tea kettle or mug?
Spiff is going to have your head
Another brit with another opinion here and it's regarding milk in first or last.  In my personal experience, if you're using a tebag in a mug, milk goes in last.  If you're using a teapot, milk goes in first.  But sugar goes in before any of it.
Could've tested when to add sugar too, before pouring the tea or after or after the milk. Sugar cubes vs loose sugar?
So as a resident Slav man I've never, ever put any milk in my tea, or rly drinking to much milk of a regular basis. So can someone explain why are Americans and the British once by that matter so obsessed with the  conversation of milk?
so in your champagne episode, yuu mentioned in wine, glass shape mattered for aroma and taste, does it also carry over for tea?
The whole of England in the comments like: 👁👄👁
As a British citizen I have never seen or heard of anyone putting milk first in their tea and saying its right. Quite frankly I got shouted at when i did it.👍🏽
Omg!
i have 2 slightly differnet ways of making tea an the method depends on if i am using bag or loose leaf, just remember when making tea a lot of it is personal preferance in strength, milk ration and sugar, so experiment till you find your preferance, a veey interestng video.  Bag-  its sugar, teabag, slow pour water, stir gently, steep for about a minute an a half, add a small amount of milk, stir gently a second time, squeeze the bags (only when using cheap bags, which happens sometimes, sadly more often these days) then drop bag in bin, tea made in about 5 minutes (including bloiling time)  loose Leaf- warm teapot with some of the boiled wate then pour down the sink, (possibly a personal quirk of mine that i picked up watching great gran and grandma making tea in a pot) a leaves in strainer(i actually use a loose leaf tea blend, not the inside of a teabag), shake gently, leave for 5minutes, add sugar to cup, add a splash of milk, gently pour tea ensuring a steady flow of liquid into the cup, gently stir, normally reserve this for when i have people over as this way takes a little more time and effort.   i do however use the loose leaf method for herbal teas (i like loose blend teas) this is normally done as a calming/comforting thing, when im stressed or sick ill often make a pot of herbal tea grab my snood, a heaty wheaty (one of those microwavle grain things, really good, my fave one is lavander infused) and hunker down on the sofa to watch something that takes little processing power as i enjoy my tea.
“How much milk is the correct amount of milk?”  The correct answer? None. Don’t have to worry about how much milk you put in if you don’t put in milk
We make out tea in the coffee pot
#relatable
But what kind of milk Matt
You guys should've tried teh tarik, then maybe us Malaysian, Indonesian and Singaporean would get triggered or something
no way bri'ish people!?!?
for tea bags i use it for ice tea in a sense. you fill a bottle with water add your bag but keep the string hanging at the opening and close off the bottle with a cap, let sit for a few hours and got yourself some ready to drink ice tea.
I’m with Mat on this one. No milk in tea
Honestly English or American always put milk that’s wrong unless your drinking English types of tea but if your drinking a Chinese tea don’t put milk and what about honey does no one use honey on tea I wouldn’t but I heard of it
Insulated blown glass cups are really expensive. Most of us back home use clay cups for tea. In truth, about as effective as ceramic. ... Our tea leaves are a bit different though...
You kept saying not to use the microwave at the end, but did you actually test that variable?
i actually hate tea so ... yeah  (if yur wondrig y its cuz the flavor is completely watered down and yu can try to leave it in for longer but it just makes it stronger not less watery)
Dang this vid makes me thirsTEA.    LMFAO
ok, to get the avacado to sprout the easy way put it in a zip lock bag with a moist paper towel.  throw that in the pantry for a week.  It will sprout roots and you can put it in the glass with the toothpicks then.  sometimes it takes two weeks for roots to sprout.
As an Chinese person, looking at tea drinking, and how Britain took the tea culture......but well, they popularised drinking tea so kudos to them. But how I drink my tea is with free leaf jasmine tea in a teapot and served in small tea cups and usually with a meal with friends and family, owh and NO MILK!
Okay, but why is the British guy cringing at the amount of milk in the tea when there's literally a drink called the London Fog that is 50% tea and 50% milk?  Also, the glass mug was probably the hottest because you basically pre- heated the mug with hot water twice to fill up the other mugs, while the transference to the other mugs, and the mugs themselves, cooled down the water in the other two, non-glass mugs.
i'm british and have never heard of putting milk in first. always put it in last, so :/
Brit here, and here's my tea method: Earl grey tea bags, add cinnamon, and coconut sugar (has a natural caramel flavour) Pour in the kettle water, and stir around for a moment then squeeze it out Then add a good amount of milk and stir again (MatPat commented that squeezing releases bitter tannins, but the thing that releases it most is TIME. Time steeps tannins, heat steeps caffeine. So hot and fast gives the best caffeine to tannin ratio) (Squeezing is also traditional for 2 reasons: getting every last drop literally, and makes disposal easier with a drier bag) When having tea at other's I'll ask for normal tea with 2 sugars and "way too much milk" (aka about 1/3 total is milk) Milk makes it actually drinkable temperature and dilutes the bitter flavours  I should note I'm hypersensitive to bitter flavours though, so use fast steeps and milk and sugar to help counter the natural bitterness
9:50 this is why u have to pour boiling water into the pot and dump it out first. miss this step and u FAIL. EDIT: tho ironically, u liked the tea colder? it’s probably better to steep when it’s hotter?  2nd edit: i’ve always heard traditionally in britain u put the milk in after, atl that’s what ur supposed to do in a formal setting.
I'm going to brag to my biology teacher that one of my favorite youtubers talked about Osmosis.
This video did not have enough, or any, Spiffing Brit and that's a pretty big failure if I'm honest. I mean, he is the arbiter of all things tea after all.
"British tea" is bootlegged from different cultures in Asia & Africa. If you were looking for the BEST tea, Britain probably wasn't the way to go lol
Didn't include sugars ones. Not a complete experiment
3-4 cups of tea? Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up.  Your friendly brit across the pond 😄
Bro these dad jokes are really kicking in
they know how to make a proper British tea now maybe they will do a Asian Indian and American comparison?
Spiffing Brit should watch this.
there's one more method you didn't do. you didn't temper the milk prior to adding it to the tea.
As someone from the South(USA), I've never had any tea, even remotely like this. Our tea(sweet tea) is cold and very sugary, without milk. Might be interesting to try this out sometime.
The only think left is to tell the spiffing Brit.   Lol. Yorkshire tea for the win!
Yeah, I won't add milk into my tea.
As a Brit, be careful. Wars have been fought over for less. By the way, Milk first and everyone knows it! Also, always Yorkshire Tea!!
"Why is tea here... just to suffuse?"  Well... if even the "commoners'" teacups are made to withstand the temperature differences nowadays, it should be fine... but if not, then, well, it's not just a teacup we're concerned about losing, right? It's the tea that we're trying to avoid breaking the cup with in the first place.
Fun fact: The pyramid tea bags were created by the illuminatea for mind control and world domination purposes 🙃
This is the video I've been looking five years for. Thank you matpat
Coming from Colombia, I had absolutely no idea that people put milk in tea
Actually in the South East of the UK most people I know DO put the milk on top - I think it is a southerner thing. Not a me thing tho - I have no milk like Matt, I actually like the bitter taste.
I agree, no milk in tea is the best, no matter what hot tea I drink...Earl Grey, Bigelow Cinnamon Stick (aka Christmas all year round), Teavana's blends, etc!
But what about microwave vs boiling 🤔
#JusticeForMicrowave You can ruin any tea with 10 gallons of milk. I don't own a kettle or a tea cup. Do I just boil my tea in a soup pot? Probably not.
Then there's what my mom called 'sun tea' - taking a big glass jar, fill it up with water, put in 8 or 10 tea bags, close it and leave it out on a sunny porch. Take bags out and store in the fridge. You become almost an expert at pouring that tea pretty quick when it's a massive glass jar to lift just right to not make a mess. It was mostly a summer thing yes. Still nostalgic and nice.
SQUEEZING THE TEA BAG IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP OF THE PROCESS!!!
I'm not sure about traditional methods but pouring the milk in before the tea is seen as a high crime in the UK punishable by permanent banishment from the kitchen.......the milk ALWAYS goes in last.
I feel the top/bottom milk experiment doesn't take into account the traditional method. You start boiling the water -> stewing the tea in a teapot, then while that's happening you use that time to get the milk out and add the right amount of milk to each mug. You simply pour the tea in after that, perhaps asking if anyone takes sugar.  You want the temperature to be high when you stew the tea and the temperature to be a little more mild when you add the milk. If you add boiling water straight to milk, it may sour the milk, especially because adding water/tea to the milk will mix it faster than adding milk to the tea. Additionally, you cool the water that the tea is supposed to stew in with the cold milk which may dimimnish the tea's flavour. When you go teapot -> milk, it's essentially the same to adding milk on top except the milk should mix in faster. In both cases you combine stewed and slightly cooled tea with the milk though apparently the teapot will be even cooler than if you just did it with the mug, so in theory, the milk-bottom + teapot method should be the best.  Which is to say, the traditional method is best, not only for efficiency but for taste when serving an audience (this is very important for the UK! Drinking tea is more often a social experience than drinking coffee is). This, however, may not extend to solo tea drinking due to the fact you'll likely not use a teapot.  IN SUMMARY: The test Matt & Co. used is valid (You cannot see it, but it appears they've poured boiling water into milk instead of using a teapot which has spoiled the milk) but the conclusion that has been drawn is incorrect (they did not follow the traditional method, but said that the traditional method is wrong). I invite Matt & Co. to repeat the milk-order test with teapot stewing instead and they may even find it to be just slightly better. In any case, I appreciate the video.
I am the tea- I got two teas in my name and tea is my favorite drink! This is the best episode of food theory! ❤️❤️❤️☕️
And the moka pot ? You can make a stronger infuse
I so wish this video will be on the British news
Wait in my country we dont use milk. I didint know people did that
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
One thing you didn't consider is that you pre-heated the glass cup by using it to fill the other cups. Therefore, your end results with the glass cup being hottest is invalid.
As a Brit, you get lynched for putting the milk in first, I know no one who does this and if they do I don’t want to know them or drink their tea
Man just declared war on Bri'ain
Game Idea: Take a drink every time theres a tea pun.... and hooo boy will you be up all night with an acute caffiene overdose!!  ... what? I'm talking about taking a sip of tea? What did you think I was talking about?
I guess I'll take there word for it when it comes to how the tea is looking.....I WOULD LOVE TOO HAVE SEEN IT TO BUT.....
Ha, Brits could hardly be considered experts on tea. They've only had it for a scant 300-500 yrs compared to India & China's over two thousand.  They don’t even grow or ferment their own tea. They get other people to do it for them!
you forgot to fill in the liquid milk or powdered milk part
right im starting to think only my grandma and i- and now my cousin- make tea the way we do. we use paper tea bags (i didn't even know pyramid teabags were a thing), let it step for however long (between 2-5 minutes unless i forget its there), and then add sweetened condensed milk. the amount varies, with my cousin adding two spoons (she loves her tea sweet), my grandma adding a little less than me, and i usually put a bit under half a teaspoon. not the actual measurement, but like those antique looking spoons. ive never done it with milk, but now i think imma try it after i finish my current cup! (if you couldn't tell, i am american. please do not make tea how my cousin does, it is atrocious. nothing should be that sweet.)
I counted the tea puns...... well..I tried.. I lost count at about 6849
It’s a partea at boston
Milk on top , i am from the UK most people do it like that .
TO MANY PUNS!!!
Honestly hate milk in my tea, I just drink it as pure water with the tea in it. 😅 love the videos team theory💪♥️
And they called me crazy for adding tea to my milk. Sweet tea. You're in the South now Matpat, join the cult of sugar.
Feel like if you're adding milk, the extra temp from brewing directly in the mug is a plus, not a minus..
Anything below 10 min is just water with a tea flavour.  Fight me.
I never liked tea 😌
We already know the drinking vessel affects the experiance. Weren't you the one that did a video about drinking glasses for wine and how they can effect the taste and experance a lot?
Sorry to burst your bubble Matthew but we already switched to pouring the milk on top a long time ago…
To my fellow Starbucks baristas, how long do you think it will be until corporate makes their own version of this video and makes every barista watch it
for me, the best way to steep tea is leaving the bag in until it's cool enough to drink, then drinking it with the teabag still in, lol
Let the Turks _steph_ in.
Lol I never use milk, I use free leaves/square bag and brew for 10-20 minutes, dependending on how bad I want to drink it.  Anything below 10 min is just water with a tea flavour.
As an American from the south growing up drinking sweet tea this was so weird to watch. So much is unrelatable and wrong to me. The idea of putting milk in tea at all seem so wrong.
make a food theory about making and tasting Pakistani and indian chai and your mind will be blown, the amount of varieties and Flavors these countries has to offer is mind boggling and how they are prepared
I love drinking tea, but I always drink tea w/o sugar, honey or milk. Just plain tea. Although I drink tea w/o anything added, I do appreciate and sometimes drink tea w/ milk or honey but no sugar. I always go for honey as alternative for sugar for a cup of tea.
As an Indian person, British tea sucks and is barely tea, chai is where its at.
If i lazy im nuke my water in a microwave. But that's really really rare
I love your videos ❤️‍🩹🥰
5:55 None. None ist best. (In my humble opinion)
I agree with matpat. Chinese tea don't use milk and tastes just as good
But what about tap water vs pure water? Or different types of milk?
the one variable I find missing is the type of milk, if whole milk, skimmed milk or another type of milk might be best
dont put milk
6:36 I lost it at that joke. Qualitea joke.
I am an American and I have drank tea since I was a little guy back in the 70's. I love tea, except for Earl Grey (ugh) . Loose leaf tea is almost always better than the tea bag stuff.  It's better quality . Tea bags can sometimes be made with not the best tea. However, in the UK, there is a line of tea bags called Builder's Tea. It's a robust and flavorful tea bag blend. Builder's Tea is fantastic. I have put in a link to a British Pathe tea making video from 1941. It's an interesting watch not only for making tea (during WW2) but for the way they talk and how seriously they took the tea making process. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnvYymrCn4g
They didn't test the microwave vs. anything else... I'm still cooking in a microwave, I live in a college dorm
I’m British and I’d never even heard of anyone putting the milk in first so I doubt that part is gonna upset many people
Personally I put my cream in the cup first, but I also foam it up before pouring (and it’s vanilla creamer and not just plain milk).
I prefer my tea in the Boston Harbor
wow
You put the tea bag in before water the water hits the bag causing it to mix the tea much quicker
I'm sorry but 3 to 4 a day are rookie numbers
yall put milk in tea????
Great ep, but I feel you missed a trick by not testing teabag in the cup/pot before or after water is added. They lead to different steeps.
As someone from the UK I have never known someone putting the milk in first, I seem to remember a rap about it too
Ah but the true tea fanatics amongst us Brits know to use loose leaf tea, not teabags. Save those for game theory. Edit: I know that’s not what you found but that’s because you used a bobble, not a tea strainer that just sits in the mug.
No milk in tea for me. I add lemon juice instead
Weren't there microplastics concerns around the pyramid teabags though? At least all the ones I've seen are made of plastic rather than most other teabags using some kind of cotton.
Also the colour of the cup is important, apparently red is the best colour for cups as we associate things like warmth to said colour
My cousin makes his tea by boiling the water in a pot withe 6 flat tea bags and then puts it in a pitcher and adds 7 CUPS OF SUGAR! Yes 7 CUPS
The milk test makes sense. You are essentially heating it and in turn kinda cooking it a bit with it on the bottom...hence the sourness mentioned.
Yo Matty daddy you forgot a variable,   The type of milk you're using 😮
I'm English and I live in England and I tried tea once and I didn't like it and I've never drank it ever since then, so I just don't drink tea. Most young people here drink coffee, it's mostly people middle aged and up thst drink tea instead here...
I’m British and have honestly never heard about such crimes as putting the milk in first… 😬 Milk always goes last!
If steph really likes tea she shd move to india but the living conditions are trash and a lot of other stuff but the tea is great (im north indian)
Very cool video! BTW you look tired Matpat. Make sure you don't get burnt out, I enjoy your content.
Good thing I’m not British, or else I would be outraged
Fun fact: there's an international standard tea brewing method. It even has an ISO number lol Tom Scott did a video on it ages ago
It's so interesting how many people have never heard of putting milk in your tea in the comments when that's the way I've mostly had tea my whole life.
I also think that no milk is better Mat-Pat.
I love in the uk and I’ve always put the milk on top, never heard of anyone putting it at the bottom
Also you forgot the variable of type of milk - that is a hot tea topic in Britain
Wait, why isn't Steph using the same tea mug throughout the day? My mum has multiple cups of tea a day, and she always uses the same mug for them.
Anyone else of the opinion that the variables  (steep time, volume of milk) we're not granular enough to determine what the *best* cup of tea is? Like what if the best time is 2.5 min instead of 3?
I'm honestly disappointed in y'all standing for "science" but dissing heating water in the microwave. Scientifically, water boiled in the microwave should taste the same as water boiled on the stove. You should have at least tested it, instead of dismissing it out of hand.
Texans:why would you put milk in your tea
I have never had tea. I mostly just drink unpasturized milk, and hot water if I'm cold
Will you cover different methods of making tea than just British hot tea .ex. Iced tea,sweet tea and others
a video on Tea? where's The Spiffing Brit when you need him?
Man I'm not even British yet looking at how Americans are """"""BOILING""""" (notice how many quote symbols are there) their water in the microwave HURTS MY EYES
Me being British using this anyway: mhmmhhh AMERICANS 🤭🤭👌👌🤏🤏👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
As a brit I know NO ONE who puts milk in first. That may be historically accurate but it's blasphemy. Also the amount of milk you add to your tea is very personal and it's usually done by colour not by quantity.
Brit here adding my own two pence, milk on the bottom in the modern age has never been a thing, rule of thumb milk in first for coffee, milk in last for tea
6:36 🤷🏻‍♀️ I see what you did there editor(s)
For a true tea test have a southern person make tea with a British person in tea making because there is a big difference between those two for instance southern sweet tea does not use milk while yes we do use more sugar I don’t think it’s worse since British tea requires you to use milk and maybe honey southern sweet tea uses sugar lemon and sometimes honey
I've seen various Brits on social media say the optimal amount of milk is however much liquid is displaced by removing the teabag, which my irl Welsh friend has confirmed. That would probably equate to about 26.5 milliliters?
1 thing you forgot to test... Clean teapot vs 'used' teapot
Same steph I absolutely love tea I've lost count of how many cups I've drank in a day before
you coud have said "TEAk Tok"
Agreeing with matpat no milk is best
The tea in the pot and the tea in the mug were the same temperature. It was the act of pouring the tea from the pot into a second vessel, a room temperature mug, that lowered the temperature of the tea. In the service industry a good waiter will preheat teacups or coffee mugs by filling them with hot water and pouring it out so the mug won't totally zap the heat of the beverage.
I do not put milk in my tea. Just the sweetener.
Asian perspective: I'm with Mat -- milk only belongs in milk tea. Don't put milk in your tea unless you're trying to get boba, guys.
!CHALLENGE! If I where to be stuck inside a room for the rest of my life with exactly 345,123 apples, 450 cooked bacon, 1,050 cooked steak, 58,231 bread and 1,968,342 corn. How long would I be able to survive if I ate 4 meals per day? (Breakfast, lunch, Dinner and a bedtime snack)  (IK you're prob not gonna do this but you can if ya don't have a video idea)
Mmm maybe the milk on the bottom would be better with other different settings? Idk
"warm leaf water" IROH WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
I just finished a web comic all about tea and different recipes and formulas… Test number 1 it could have been a slight change from the metal of the bobble paper and muslin cloth tend to to do that according to the comic they also can hold “flavor” if it’s been used with other tea. Test number 2 tea pots also can  hold flavor and brewing in a pot is gonna hold temp longer cause that’s what they are designed to do. Thermal dynamics and what not. Test number 3 can we repeat this with coffee for us rebel Yankees? (I don’t drink milk in tea but I do enjoy a little coffee with my creamer 😆) depending on the tea type, milk amount will differ and which one first (tea or milk). Last test, this is one of the biggest items discussed in the comic. Different types of tea need different cups and tea pots.
I'm with Mat, no milk is the best milk to put in tea.  😊
As soon as that lady put it in the microwave I was screaming
MattPatt you forgot to test the classic American sweet tea methods of boiling the water and tea leaves on a stove top and dumping it into a pitcher with sugar and adding water. The tea journey is incomplete.
Not British but Persian, for those tea lovers who wanna step up their sugar cube game get Zarrin hard sugar cubes. Simply place on your tongue and let the sugar dissolve into your mouth as you sip the tea, the sugar cubes are super dense so you can get a good couple mouthfuls of tea in before they fully melt. Anytime I happen to drink tea I always use the Persian sugar cubes, their the best.
i don’t care what’s perfect, im using loose leaf, a splash a milk and a spoon.7 of sugar and carrying on my merry way
Can you do a theory on  some Romanian traditional food like: sarmale,piftie,ciorba de burta,mici and more food that you can find online
Steph doesn't do hers sweet tea style?! This is the south, how could she... T.T
I have ALWAYS put the milk on top and I'm British so I have no idea were the idea of it before came from those of us north of London have NEVER done that.
Shoulda went with Chinese or at least some other Asian country for the "expert" considering that tea originated from China and not Britain. The British literally stole tea info and tea itself from China.  If anything the British are just 1 step above US Americans in terms of "Tea expertise"
What about different types of milk now wouldn't skim milk taste differently than the whole milk in the tea which milk do you use .
Glass, porcelain, and glazed stoneware are going to be pretty similar. You should have tested travel cups if you wanted to have a nasty cup of tea. The hot water makes plastic lined mugs practically leech a plastic taste and whatever coffee was in there last into the tea. Metal lined is better *if* you're fine with a potential metallic tinge. It's very subtle, so I'd vote it as the optimal travel mug type. There are glass/ceramic ones out there but I think they're more expensive and potentially breakable 🤷‍♀️ Disposable cups are by far the worst. Starbucks already screws up by scalding the leaves by using water that's too hot but then it's in the nastiest vessels man has ever put tea in. What a waste!
How dare you not invite the spiffing Brit to make a cuppa! He is literally the perfect YouTuber to collab with on this topic lol 🇬🇧
As a British person I can say I have poured milk on top my entire life, I NEVER knew ANYONE would put milt first
On the subject of milk first, that’s how my Chinese mother drinks her tea (kinda). At Chinese restaurants our tea is piping hot, and is refreshed by adding boiling water to keep it scalding. My mother says that the key to drinking it hot but not too hot is to only drink the top half of your cup. You allow the bottom half to remain, which will mix with the newly poured tea and cool it to the perfect hot sipping temperature
did steph actually burgle that tea
DEAR MATPAT it’s sweet of you to dedicate an episode of Steph’s interests.
If you ever do another episode like this try a red mug. The red colour makes your brain think fresh and hence makes whatever your drinking taste better.
My gripe is the British didn't perfect tea, most of what they know about tea they got from the Chinese, India etc. Places that had tea for thousands of years first. It's fine to say we're using the British method, but MatPat, don't act like the British somehow innovated tea.
Excuse you Britain, the Dutch make great tea! But also being here in America, you gotta watch out for Southern-style tea aka "would you like some tea with your sugar" lol.
I prefer coffee
Quality tea actually is: One mug One bag  Nuke for 3 minutes  One pound of sugar No milk 15 min steep time
UK tea. Closer, closer, closer. Ahh there we are.
Tonight on The Food Theorists: MatPat get's Canceled by the British! Tune in at 8:30pm
Love your videos ❤😂
I'm gonna make everyone mad with how I make my tea, lmao. -Put water and paper tea bag in a mug at once. -Microwave for 2 minutes. -Add splash of milk and three tablespoons of sugar. -Watch as tea-loving brother has a stroke. -Enjoy!
to fix your dishwasher clutter just be a good husband and get her one of the self heating mugs she has to rinse them out
milk in tea is NOT for me
Wow
Do you know why the British are so keen on imperialism, coloniaism, and capitalism?  They just really love their proper tea
This episode makes me pretty uncomfortable framing the ik as the OG tea drinkers and then saying that most of it originases from india. Together with the "asian leaves" remark I feel like they perhaps should got closer to the actual source? Or perhaps just said fameus for their love of tea we will... insert the UK. Just instead of framing them as the OG tea drinkers
Ah yes hot leaf juice
The best tea is "steeped" in a harbor 🦅 🇺🇲💥🎆🎆🇺🇲🎆🎆💥🇺🇲 🦅
I want 8-bitryan too watch this
I’m living for Tom fixing his glasses like every 5 seconds
Adding milk before the water is debated a lot in the UK and its more the older generation that add milk first from what I've seen. My sister and I add water first while My parents prefer milk first.
Better question what about fruit teas and non leave teas like I'm drinking a raspberry tea right now let's actually really really good
So, if you dump the leaves directly into the teapot, don't they end up in your cup after pouring?
I've always put the milk in first and squeezed the bag. I don't even leave it to steep. I'll have to do my own experiments now.
11:50 the glasses push-up lmaoo
it seems ironic how my girlfriend loves to drink Tea LOL
I also don’t add milk to my tea. Just Honey or Sugar then I enjoy my hot cup.
What are the least and most filling foods/drinks?
1:35 I love your wife. Her demeanor doesn’t look like she’d crack a joke so it’s really funny when she does.
I'm going to argue with God to get a taste of tea
As a brit who doesnt like tea, i still had a visceral reaction to the title of this video 🤣 the tea culture cuts too deep in this country man 🤣 how am i baited by something that i literally dont care about
next up: Best cappucino (getting Steph's italian citizenship revoked part 2)
Ur forgetting what type of milk to use lol,great vidio keep it up
From Britain - I've always hated it when people pour the tea into milk or even worse brew the teabag in milk, not water. It has forever and always been tea brewed, teabag out, milk in for my family.
No Spiffing Brit?
How about different types of milk. Or whole, 1%, 2%, skim?
Every single English person agrees milk onto is superior and rightfully bullies anyone who disagrees
Make this with the Moka, coffee, etc
As a Scottish man who has made tea his whole life, I was very upset at the ordering and ratios of the tea. I've always did; teabag and two teaspoons of sugar in a cup, boil kettle to your liking in terms of heat, pour in water 1/2 way full, stir thoroughly for 10 - 15 seconds making sure you touch the bottom of your cup in order to disperse and dissolve your sugar properly, pour in milk 1/4 or 1/3 if you prefer, and enjoy. I think that tiktoker sent me on a villain arc btw...
If your drinking your tea from a mug your doing it wrong already.  2:40 wait is that a microwave she is using to heat her water up? I’ll give her points for effectiveness but she gets far more negative points for not obeying the Ritual of making tea.
i find that when i have a cup of tea if you stop steeping your tea just before the film on the top starts to form it tastes the best, im guessing that is because no tannin's are released but you get the best draw from your tea leafs
during my tea high time, I had a traditional made chinese tea pot.  These r porous...which results in a cool effect.  U have to brew only one sort of tea in it, because the facts which r stated at 18:08. But if u used it for quite a while, u can simply put hos water in it, and it will still get a nice tea flavour.
Good Choice of immediately taking off the edge of this provocation. Because no one in the Occident will take any food mistakes pointed out by an American.  The reasons are numerous. -And often disgusting.-
As a Turkish person that goes through multiple teapots a day. NO.  You shouldnt even use teabags. First boil your water in a kettle, and then add the water to the tea leafs and let it boil for some more time. And then you can drink it with some lemon or sugar. No milk. Paper bags are lame.
Yo am I a psycho for preferring the tannins concentrate. I double bag my tea and then squeeze the bags before a remove them and my bags brew for 5 minutes +
Hits on microwaves, doesn't actually test if microwaved water of the same temp actually TASTES different after brewing tea in it versus a kettle.  My guess is it won't....  (Assuming you actually use your brain to read the manual to calculate the cook time for a glass of water per volume and the wattage so you don't overheat/superheat the water. You could also use the automatic function if you have even a modestly decent microwave. +1 if your microwave has an inverter for more even heating. Work smarter, not harder.)
I don't know anyone who puts milk in first for the tea, that's just weird (working class brit)
i (a born and raised tennessean) just read the title and thought to myself, “matt’s about to offend a fuckton of southerners and, i am so here for it”
(8:59) Steph: Wow… wow, wow, wow. Me: *Violent flashback to Pitch Meeting*  Also, MatPat jumping up and down like a happy kid gives me *so* much joy. Also (x2): I think might be my favorite episode of Food Theory *ever* .....Tom and his accent had nothing to do with that, by the way.
I guess thanos was right
As a brit I've always steeped for 3 minutes and added the milk on top with roughly the amount you found, nothing new learnt here, except we brits have been doing it rite for ages lol. I will say I've never screamed no no no so many times at a video once I saw that tik tok version...
Why tf yall putting milk in tea??
I love that Tom got his loose leaf privileges removed!!! ☕️🫖
As an Asian woman and a tea lover who grew up on tea with milk, I think Matthew is right. It tends to depend on the tea you’re drinking, but the right teas don’t need milk. Then again, my favorite tea is “Paris tea” which tastes like oranges and cream without milk :)
I'm with Mat... Why milk?
Autumn- lol I have 3 cups of tea a day all year round😆😆😆😆
If you think 3-4 cups is a lot then what is my consumption of 1 letter of tea per day?
I was litteraly on the edge of my thinking it was gonna be episode three on how to eat your Christmas tree
Um, the right amount of milk in tea is zero
As a proud Englishman, the best cup of tea is always Yorkshire tea loose leaf in a teapot. Taylors of Harrogate are the supreme overlords of tea in my house
Aah yes... The British.. the originators of tea..... From India...
Matpat is correct 0 milk I didn’t even know people put milk in tea 😀
Ok the one things that stops me from enjoying this episode to start off with is the fact that milk in tea is a normal thing to do...? No one ever, at least where I come from, puts milk in tea at all, restaurants dont even serve that option, so seeing that this is a huge part of the video just doesnt click with me at all, its like why is this even here
I sorry any brit putting milk first are lying
Almost surprised The Spiff Brit wasn't in this one.
You gotta squeeze as much tea out of the tea bag as possible then add milk to your taste  At least that's what we do in my house
I love everyone acting like microwaving tea is the greatest sin of humanity and I’m over here with my executive dysfunction like “you expect me to BOIL water EVERY time I want tea when the microwave is RIGHT THERE?? who has the mental ‘spoons’ for that?????”
With the milk on bottom or top segment I need to clarify, were both cups brewed the same way or from a teapot? There's gonna be a huge difference between the two if cold milk was poured onto a teabag before the water was added.
Yorkshire Gold!!!!!!!!! Spiff #1!!!!!!!!!!!
What type of milk though - we have skim milk, 1%, 3% or whole milk......(in Canada and assuming same elsewhere?)
Love this video, just wished u showed us what each cup looked like each time 😂
So, do you add the sugar before or after the milk?
I'm sure the whole reason the teapot tea was colder was just due to the heated water dissipating it's heat to the larger vessel. Preheating the the tea vessel be it mug or tea pot with hot water will definitely reduce this heat loss.
As a Canadian of recent British ancestry, my Great Gramma would use my guts for garters if I put milk in the cup before the tea. You charge the cup (pour hot water into it to warm the cup), THEN put the tea in, then whatever extras you desire. She also never served up tea that wasn't steeped at least five minutes, I can't drink watery tea as a result (was she wrong to give me tea you could stand a spoon in? Probably. But it's what I know lol). Blech. Another thing (that is entirely debatable, I am sure) is whether a seasoned (read "Tea stained") tea pot produces better flavoured tea than a freshly scrubbed one. *edit* Upon watching, you should have a tea cozy on the teapot to keep it insulated.
Speaking as an Englishman: NEVER PUT THE MILK IN FIRST!!! If you have milk.
So the only question I have left is...... Which type of milk should you use. 2%? Whole milk? Skim!?!
As the average 7-cups of tea person so this episode is great for me
yeah the aftertaste is really bitar
But you forgot some of the most vital steps! Clock wise vs anti clockwise  Leaving your tea bag for the three minutes or impatiently mixing it hoping it will defuse faster and the most important ingredient love ❤️ or in my case sugar
“Great here’s our taxes.” 🗿
Uncle Iroh approves your experiment.    Thank you for the tea, it was… delicious 😋
This was fun to watch! Pretty sure pouring the water over the tea instead of dunking the tea into a vessel of water also makes a difference. Being lactose intolerant I don’t drink milk tea. But I do enjoy tea!
You all need to check out the comedy tea rap soo good lol
As a daily tea maker and drink here in the UK, you overlooked a few things.  First, don't fully boil the water, bring it to as close to boiling as you can without actually letting it boil. This is particularly true for Asian teas.  Second, putting the tea bag in the hot water or pouring the water over the teabag already in the cup. I find that tea is much smoother and stronger when you pour the water directly over the bag. My hypothesis is that when you put water in first, it cools just enough to change the reaction it has with the tea leaves.  Last, tannins are a bigger issue than mentioned in the video. Not only can they add a bitter taste, but it has a strickening effect on your taste buds that gives you a dry aftertaste.  I fully expect to see a part two where these are all addressed!
“As a bri’ish person” shut up no one wants to see the same 3 comments on repeat
12:38 is going to haunt me
What about the milks temperature, like cold milk or room temp milk, or maybe warm milk?
So maybe this a southern thing, I'm not sure. My family does Tea VERY differently, no milk at all.   What we do is we take a large pot and Boil the water with Tea bags inside after its starts to bubble pour it into a large pitcher, and pour water ontop till pitcher is filled. Add sugar and stir it.
I would like to ask a question. When talking about the amount of milk in tea, were cup sizes taken into account for the 5mls in the research done? I was just thinking that a small tea cup holds much less than even a standard mug, let alone what most Americans think a mug size is (thank you Gilmore Girls). 5mls would go a loy further in a small tea cup vs a mug. Just a thought.
the guest appearances of Team Theorists is so cool!
Theory idea: Coke and tic tax released new coke tic tax’s, and I need to know how many get one serving of coke
We need more tea episodes.
Japan, South Africa and china make better tea. British people disappoint me in their tea. As tea was invited by an Asian lady
Damm it, I simply love how this whole video I was waiting for it to end so I could say "This Food *Teary* wasted one opportunitea for pun". Only to see it shown at the end https://youtu.be/tR-3BMignl4?t=1277 They let no pun escape them this video, correct me if I am wrong
The correct order: Sugar, teabag, boiling water, milk
I’m Ireland, 3-4 cups of tea a day is nothing. The average Irish, old man would probably have at least 6 or 7 a day with extreme tea drinkers having easily over 10.
I think you had enough tea Buz
This is just too ingenuous, making a video specifically targeted at British tea obviously gaining most British people and then having the rest of the International fan base also watching it because it's on a theory channel  But yes I do drink 3-4 cups of tea per day
You’re English guy needs to come home for weekend.Almost  Everyone I know hates putting milk in first. We know how it works 😂
You forgot two(maybe 3 depending on how you look at it) more variables. The temperature of the water, cup and teapot. Enjoyed the video though, now I know not to squeeze the loving daylights out of my teabags
Ok, wait. You keep saying "don't microwave, boil it" and yet no testing was done to control for this? I demand the science!
#FoodTheorySquad
Important to point out that plastic pyramidal tea bags slough off BILLIONS of microplastics into the tea—McGill researcher Nathalie Tufenkji did a study confirming the results. Horrifyingly, you can actually see the accumulation of microplastics in the tea when it is steeping. NOBODY should be using plastic teabags, EVER!
Depending on the material you boil your tea it can also enhance the flavor
I really don't understand why "expert" tea drinkers are so appalled by heating up water in microwave. It makes literally no difference if i heat it up in microwave, electric tea kettle, or stove tea pot. I've done all versions and if i'm making many cups at once I'll just use the stove and a larger kettle but if i'm making a single cup, i just throw a cup of water in microwave (I heat water in a measuring cup then pour it over tea in mug i'm going to actually drink out of). I cannot tell the difference at all no matter which method i use to heat up the water. However I do prefer loose leafs vs tea bags, i've had a much more enjoyable flavor experience from whole loose leaf's then tea bags and that's not even something even tried in this video.
China made tea first smh
The last thing you should have tested is if putting sugar before the water will change anything. My friend and I will constantly argue about this. Personally I put it in once the tea bag is out and she puts it in before the water even goes in
1 question what type of tea is being made because it isn't answered throughout the video
you just made a standard cup of tea - noone adds milk before without using a teapot
okay fr what's wrong with heating water in a microwave? 🤔
I think i can smell this video
They didn't test the point I was MOST interested in: is microwaved water really so terrible?
why are you even putting milk in your tea?? that's disgusting
I'm british and always and my family always puts milk on top
Milk first is a sin against god
Unless you are brewing your loose tea separately and combining your brew with hot water in the glass its just not the same for me
Bruv who puts milk first
I think the thing people don’t understand is the real reason the America left England was because despite all the kinds of teas they had they could never give us the tea we wanted most Liber-tea.
I never put milk in my tea
Personally I’d steep a bag of tea in a tea pot for 5 minutes
I just realized you use PowerPoint when making these videos.
This video reminds me of the 3 bears. One is too hot, one is too cold but one is just right.
just tried it, it’s great.
I can’t wait to see Matpat in making a Chinese tea :p gonna learn how different type of tea pots and how to clean tea before pouring balanced hot tea afterwards.
“3-4 cups a day”: me being British- rookie numbers
So many errors.
BUT HOW MUCH SUGAR?
The Irish method is absolutely clear (the best):  Boil the kettle  Pour water into pot Put leaves into pot Let them dissolve and strain  Pour into cup and add milk  There is one acception earl grey you should be put to death if you put milk into that and it’s a war crime if you put sugar into tea
As a Brit, I have never put milk in first. That is sacrilege, milk in last every time.
HA! I have been awarded the BEST TEA MAKER in multiple settings: work, home, parties, the shower. All you did was prove my British way is the best way. BUT you didnt tackle "agitation duration" aka stirring.
So, they tested so much. But why didn’t they test the best type of milk? Like 1% 2%, whole milk?
Turkey 🇹🇷 left the chat
I actually do worry about the plate  my food is on.
not to be rude but I think matt forgot to put on his makup
*sits here sipping tea made in my keuregg with zero milk*
I drink like 6 per day tea
Leaf water? Did a YouTube channel just declare war on England?
As a Brit I stand by the fact that milk goes in after the milk. Hot water first into mug then add tea bag then milk and stir to taste.
as a true englishman i would av youre socalled brit in sec
Tea bag tea sucks
I think you guys forgot something: milk added during the brewing process.
This is just burger stack order but with tea
as a member of the southerner community, it’s an out rage that there ain’t any sugar in some nice iced tea. y’all are in SOUTH CAROLINA, why there milk in the tea without sugar!  thank you
They didn’t figure out whether putting the tea bag before or after water makes a difference
We have an m cup, an s cup, and an a cup. Is the a cup for ash?
Didn’t the Americans throw over a bunch of British tea during the Boston tea party
Cope mat.
I don't take milk in tea at all.  But I do sometimes do lemon, and am sad it got no attention here.😁
I agree with MatPat the best amount of milk in tea is no milk
17:55 funny enough there is a food science about plating. Gordon Ramsey talks about how you eat with your eyes first. It’s the sole reason why you don’t see brown plates with meat because they blend.
as someone who squeezes out the bags and goes 50/50 on the milk, this video offends me. But I will try it your way in the morning (although, I don't have the pyramids)
Spiff on his way to the top of these comments. Step aside. Step aside!
I'm British and I pour my milk on top, sooooo?
This is probably going to be controversial, but if you're planning on making a gallon of tea with the flat tea bags Boil it with the water. Put it on low or whichever you prefer if you're trying to make it quickly. Keep in mind this is a trick we used down in Alabama for iced tea so it's probably not gonna translate well... Heck it's probably already blasphemous but hey we Americans are backwards XD.
As a man from Dixie I personally prefer sweet tea
Sounds like the "putting milk on the bottom" was known to be worse, but was still a necessity born from poverty. So really, you've just tasted the difference between English tea, and peasant tea.
Where is Yorkshire Tea Gold? Where is the Spiffing Brit when you need him?
I have stef beat. I drink about 7 cups of tea a day. Yes I am a Pyschopath
That "How americans make tea" video disgusted me for a bit. Not because she heated the water with the microwave but because she didn't even let the tea leaves soak before pouring in cold milk. Pretty sure she just made warm watered down milk with her method.
Im not happy with the 26 mls of milk. Why didn’t they try different measures like 13 ml?
Did you put the milk into the cup then put the teabag in to brew with the milk in there? that is totally different than making the tea in the teapot. and having the milk in the cup. Milky hot water brews the tea differently
The point about the difference between different cups for the tea reminds me, years ago my family and I discovered that *root beer* tasted markedly different out of a plastic bottle, a can, or a plastic cup. Iirc the best was the bottle. Brought out more of the flavor and retained the carbonation better.
Avocados are not "true to seed". So you are not getting any real avocados out of that seed..... just sayin...
I make tea by putting a circle tea bag in, putting kettle water in, taking tea bag out, putting a little milk in, add sugar if want, then done
As a Brit tea drinker in a tea drinking family, NO-ONE PUTS MILK FIRST !!!!!!!
im from the uk and in my house we tend to put the milk in last but more cause the tea is brewed in the mug so the water needs to be there first.
Looks tastea!
This whole video is a crime. All tea needs is water, tea, sugar (or sugar water), ice, and some lemon. Milk goes in coffee, NOT tea.
The cat just leaked the next vid 😋😋😋
Speaking of rinsing out all of those tea mugs, which fabric makes for the optimal dish scrubber or towel? Jute? Cotton? Nylon mason line? Cleaning optimization seems like an episode to me, if not a few.
An experiment where most of it tasted good, that's a rarity.
British may have brought the saplings but the tea belongs to us Indians. And we bloody well make it better than them. My parents would disown me if served them teabag chai instead of properly boiled. And trust me I'd do the same.  You want proper tea or CHAI -  Boil water 50%(total vol) with ginger / half to 1 inch cinnamon / 1-2 lightly crushed or openned green cardamom pods.  Then add a heaping tsp of tea leaves per cup. Let it steep for a few minutes. Add milk (the rest 50% of the volume). Then let it come to roaring boil 2-3 times. Add sugar strain and enjoy. Thank me later ✌️
The reason the handle to the mug was hot is b/c the mug wasn't microwave safe.
I have a cup of coffee with milk, well, on normal days.
"How much milk do we add?" None. Tea is just fine on it's own and you dont need and milk in it
Tea is an infussion you can mix to your taste. There is no better tea than the one you like. My dear grandmother (rip) would surprise us with different blends of her own. I'd suggest experiment subtle variations Ceylon, Darjeeling, English... and don't be afraid of using threads... not everything has to be dried old tea in a bag.  Enjoy!
hol up... u guys put milk in your tea?
You add sugar and make it ice cold.
The only complaint that I have is that this wasn't a double blind test. So the results might be a result of a placebo or bias.   Very minor complaint.  But fun episode regardless.
As an American from, what some would call the south (Virginia), I prefer my tea Sweet! Not over sweetened mind you, just enough to sweeten it up. Also, there is just something about hot milk that sounds disgusting . . . unless its in hot chocolate.
steph only has 3-4 cups of tea?  Pathetic. my grandma can do better
Me and my family are the only ones that we know of for putting the milk in first, you can blame my mum for that one.  And yes, i am british
I'm about to throw cows into the harbor. If you want to be a pretentious then just steep your tea in warm milk and go to bed you child.
Agreed no milk in tea. Also no milk in coffee either. Milk takes away the flavor from the tea and coffee. Now if you have a vary strong tea like Yorkshire gold then you require a splash of milk to mellow it out.
You missed out several tests. Does the colour of the cup effect how your brain persevere the taste, the temperature of the water and also is filtered or tap water better
Lol ah yes the expert on tea is the British...the British
Milk was put in first when the tea was brewed in the pot, not the mug. Also, and most important, you didn't test the same tea. Paper, pyramid, and loose are different sized leafs.
In New England we say the best way to brew tea is to throw it in the harbor. LOL No really we drink it the British way too. I wont lie I to microwave it and use tea bags but I know its better when you take the time to do it right. I'm just lazy and don't want to.
Bruh just use one cup fot the teas
am i the only one who steeps my tea for 2 second and not several minutes lol.
Now you need to make a video about making the best coffee from the grounds up.
That TikTok was a disgrace. I can see why it made headlines
So you didn't prewarm your teapot?  Also, WTF is this milk mishegoss? This ain't coffee that needs to be made to taste like not itself before it's fit for human consumption.
I was under the impression the best way to start a civil war in Great Britain was to walk into a room and ask everyone how to make a proper cup of tea and just wait for the fighting to start. But I'm a filthy Yankee, so I could be wrong
Steph: drinks 4 cups of tea per day British people: pathetic
"3-4 Cups of tea" Are you Kidding me That's Insultingly Low
I’m also a tea drinker
would whole milk vs skimmed milk vs semi-skimmed milk make a large difference? i personally have semi-skimmed but i know some people who use whole milk (i'm a brit btw so i know enough tea drinkers)
i never EVER use milk in my tea. hot water and sugar is for me.
Um, what about honey?
as a consumer of gourmet loose leaf tea exclusively this video is gonna be interesting. I'm literally the equivalent of the coffee guys who bring their own french presses into a lecture hall in college LMAO
@spiffingbrit
So I was unironically making myself a cup of Earl Grey while I was listening to this video and now I feel like a monster because I've always put a splash of half and half in my earl grey never just straight milk.
I'm Irish if that adds anything but I put the teabag first then put hot water in, beat the bag with a teaspoon for a little bit, 15-20 seconds then take the tea bag out or leave it in and then add a drop of milk so the tea is a nice light brown
I agree with no milk
Thank you MatPat my first reaction was. “Who on earth puts milk in their tea?!?”
As a brit, this video has made me lose all respect for Americans.
I can't wait to try this with New York water. I wonder if it'll turn out like NY Pizza is the best because of it's difference in balance
British person here. Milk in first (or MIFing) has been incorrect for years. You'll upset a lot of people by putting milk in first. Until this video I've never heard of milk in first being "correct"
ill try this method
What about the best biscuits to have with tea?
I love how Steph and Tom are in visible pain while you're making the Tik Tok tea XD
No milk in tea is best in my opinion.
how to get cancelled by the British in 21 minutes or less
I've seen how Americans make tea, please do this one right mat
Ah, the real reason for FoodTheory... Writing food off as a business expense. MatPat is amazing
I know my tea sucks I live in the us
Good tea shouldn't need milk. If you've gotta "mask/change" the flavor, you're not experiencing the leaf juice in it's purest form. Unless you're meaning to make a late or something. But then I argue.. That is no longer tea, it is a tea DRINK.
Matty Patty I WILL SMERE YOU WILL BBQ SAUCE
Matt's Square head looking like Minecraft Steve. Besides. You don't put milk in tea, you put lime!!
Here's the thing, as I understand, British NOBILITY, who COULD afford better higher quality china that wouldn't crack to heat shocks, and could replace them if they did, DID do tea first milk second. The queen did so every day until her death. So the British are still right about tea, it's just their peasantry hasn't yet adjusted to living like kings of old.  A similar situation is people who still put sugar and self-rising flour in cornbread even though they're using better cornmeal now. After the Civil War during Reconstruction, back when they were using Field Corn cause that's all they could afford, it needed that to not be hard and taste flat, basically adopting the recipe of former slaves. Meanwhile the rich (or stubbornly proud) families kept using Sweet Corn like they always had. So now there's a culture war in the American South about sugar in cornbread, because some people's traditional recipes are working under the assumption you're making due with animal feed.
The best milk is entirely dependent on the tea. Chai is best as a high milk tea, but keep your lactose out of my jasmine!
I think factor 5 should have been temperature of the water at the start of the brewing process. From what I've heard, is that in green tea science, this is a major factor. Just an after thought 🤔
I kinda wanna see more tea episodes..... My favorite tea is chamomile!!!!
The glass cup was also the hottest because you pre-heated it by measuring the hot water for the other two cups.
OF COURSE YOU DON’T PUT THE MILK IN FIRST!!! THAT IS A CARDINAL SIN!!! WHAT KIND OF GEEZA WOULD EVEN CONSIDER PUTTING THE MILK IN FIRST!!?  Probably a torie…
my grandma made me drink tea with milk sometimes.  I hated it.  as an adult, I have tried it - still hate it. so like.. its the best tea for SOME people I guess.. but I feel like milk just obscures the taste of tea.  if I'm not drinking it plain, its honey and sometimes lemon.  P.S.  controversial opinion.  I do not associate best tea with Britain and never will. they have merely adopted it.  /hide
the correct amount of milk is no milk, tea without milk is best tea.
I think it's important to note that regular tea bags, pyramid bags, and loose leaf are all made with different grades of tea. The way you brew isn't the only factor there.
I’m British and I was not aware that you’re not supposed to squish the tea bag when you take it out! I always press it against the side to get the most flavour! I’m ashamed I’m sorry
As a Georgian I find hot tea to put it nicely not good and will always stick to sweet tea
Best milk is Baileys
As an Eastfrisian, and thus a world champion of tea drinking, I acknowledge the british way, but prefer the Eastfrisian way of a set ceremony style, special tea blends and cream instead of milk.
So when do you add sugar?
I would just like to note as someone who just primarily drinks store bought iced tea I'm just sitting here like 'Ya'll put time into your tea? and put milk in it?'
I love Mat’s tea jokes
As a british person i know no one who puts milk in first. Also they say they want specifics and just leave it at 3 minutes. I need to know how many seconds, also exactly how many ml of milk. Personally i have just a splash probably 5ml is right for me but i like it strong and slightly bitter
typically, I press the teabag against the side of the mug to get all of the good good out of it
Where intro :(
I'm a British guy yeah and I have never seen anybody put milk in the mug first
NO MADPAT the best cup of tea an empty cup... COFFEE SUPREMACY
As someone who's British person I do agree with what you've done except when should you put a tea and sugar. Which the tea can affect the taste due to the movement of the water and not just convection currents. Also mabey the colour of the cups effects the teast. Just that you missed but 100% offended but enjoy keep up the good work and I'll garentea I'll stick around
Guarantee you that this episode only exists because Steph and MatPat had a bet and MatPat lost
My dad used to cut the tea bags open and pour the leaves directly into the coffee maker. It was incredibly strong, but REALLY good tea. Stephanie probably isn't THAT southern though 🤣
I think this is my new favorite food theory video! It has everything I appreciate. An interesting topic, Matpat VO, live experiments, delightful Steph appearances, tea, the appreciation of good tea, jovial Tom, Tiktok failed experiments, inquisitive Matpat, and Skip!
If using a microwave to heat water is gross to you, know that you're probably not a smart person.
Can you do the same thing for coffee?
Just my personal opinion, but: - if you add anything except for the hot water to your tea, you're not making tea, you're making a tea-based cocktail - if you don't like the taste of pure tea, this means that either you don't like tea in general or you haven't found the right leafs  - I have nothing against adding milk or sugar to my tea (but I don't call this mix a tea) - teapot is not the only good option, you can also try french press or samovar. Tea baskets come in various shapes, not only the spherical one you had - as a teapot might be thicker that a cup, it may have a higer total heat capacity (assuming the same material). Thus, hot water will cool down more significantly in a teapot at the biginning of the brewing, making the brewing temperature sub-optimal. I commenend pre-heating your teapot with hot water in advance
Your puns are crimes against humani-tea.
and now for the national tea song:  "Leaves from the vine Falling so slow Like fragile tiny shells Drifting in the foam Little soldier boy Come marching home Brave soldier boy Comes marching home"
I know what time it is, but it’s tea! Bring in the Russians
"today we're only going to be lifting our pinkies for the classic british tea"  aka the worst tea.
ive never seen anyone put milk first here (i’m from england). i put the tea bag in the cup, hot water, stir and steep, sugar/sweetener, stir, milk, done
I'm with you Matt, no milk in my tea. Thanks
all the british people watching prepping their crumpets and tinnies for any wrong move
Weirdest tea rules ever, we usually have around half an hour or 40 minutes if its cold and a little bit of bark or twigs inside to make it more raw. Then usually no milk or sugar but a little bit of honey or if you have it i take some coffee to mix in it. then it becomes just right
Somebody should count how many puns are made
As a Brit. My way of making tea would infuriate most people. I have 3 spoons of sugar. I steap my tea for any time between 15 and 30 minutes. I have an outrageous amount of milk. And I drink it immediately because it’s at the perfect temperature for me. I will do this up to 6 times a day. Or on the contrary I will have no milk and no sugar but steap it for the same amount of time and have it last me about 45 minutes in drinking time. Sorry not sorry to my fellow Brits.
Bruh
Mines between coffee and hot coco
What about pouring the hot water through the teabag.  So teabag first then hot water on it.
Adding milk to tea is for the weak, I don't want to dillute or "mellow" my tea, I love it for what it is pure.  On the one hand it dilutes the tea flavour, whikst at the same time it's not enough milk to actually make it creamy, so you end up with a weaker tea that has just enough milk that it draws attention to how it lacks the creaminess of dairy.  If you really want to combine tea and milk, boil milk and steep tea in that to make a tea infused warm milk, then it's actually creamy without diluting it.
Fourth option: throw it in Boston Harbor. Now there's a party.
Y do americans always show tea as transparent. I have never seen a transparent tea.  Edit: except for iced
All I learned from this video is that I’ve been making tea better than the British this entire time
iced tea is better
Gotta say my favorite tea is a mixture of fruit and spearmint
I really sat here watching 20 minutes of tea drinking. Gosh I am British 🇬🇧 ☕️
as a brit, I am glad to know my way of making tea is the correct one
This didn't ruin my experience of British tea, I dont like it, but i was raised on Chai and indian tea traditions which probably makes me a biased person
When it comes to picking the right cup/mug: the material isn't as important as the thickness of the lip.
Ill never gey that milk in tea. I tastes and looks like someone just shat in my cup
As a person who uses the Gong Fu method for tea, this video does nothing but scare me.
Best way to make British tea if youre American. Is to throw that junk right in the Bahston Haba.
You going to do the scientific best cup of coffee next?
as a British person, I can definitely say, I don't know anyone who puts the milk in first, and if they do that, they are wrong. milk always goes in last. also, brands are a HUGE factor when it comes to the quality of the tea and its flavour. Yorkshire Tea Gold in my experience has been the best quality tasting tea I have ever had, but if you want a good idea of the best tea brands, I recommend watching the spiffing brits tea tier list.
How about type of milk?
i live in the north of the uk and ive never seen someone put milk in first?? lmaoo
As a South African I've never seen anyone, except psychos, pour the milk in first
Gotta agreee with MatPat. No milk in tea.
Why?! Oh my god that poor tea!! Wth. Stop.  I'm not even british and my favorite tea is Japanese tea. The introduction of milk at all is concerning. No no no no. No caffeine too.  And yeah, you want strong flavoured tea, poor the close to boiled water on the tea leaves. I like soft flavoured tea, so about two minute steep after. If you can smell your tea while it's dry, shorter and no pour. And a table of sugar if you prefer sweeter.  Take it from someone who's refused all coffee ever.
In the UK, putting the milk first is akin to killing a puppy.
i have never heard of a single person putting milk in first, thats just wrong. sounds like something theyd do in the south though
20:00 is when they do the list of what to do and what not to do
I prefer the loose leaf containers just for the feeling of steeping the tea.
there's. milk. in. tea. ?.
6:29 He let the intrusive thoughts win.
I was not expecting 3 puns in the same sentence. (Edit): 5 in the same minute.
How could you not touch Turkish Tea?
There's also a difference in quality of leaves across the teas, classic tea bags can basically get away with filling there's with tea leaf powder, pyramids have to be a little bit more selective but can use bits, where as loose leave is usually full leaf with no degradation from the packing process.  ... You actually didn't test whether microwave water is worse than battle water, only that the tiktok method was dumb.  Yeah... No, this was bad, like really bad, from a testing standpoint you didn't really address a lot of what is debated, for instance you came t a conclusion for a mug of tea and then assumed it would be reflected in the pot so you didn't check to see if the vessel affected brewing. I don't think you prepped the pot with cast away water before filling it for brewing, you set all the teas if varying quality for the same brew time, if though you acknowledge their brew times should vary,  you brewed the loose leaf tea in an infuser even though those are widely regarded to negatively affect the taste, you didn't test brewing temperatures, you had one cup per sample, you took no time to insure the amount of leaves were equal across bags to loose leaf. Like some things are things only a snob would know, some where things you should have known, but these tests were too basic, and never actually addressed if microwaves were bad
I personally agree that milk is on the top
still tastes good. me likey.
I love tea, but I prefer herbal tea, which isn't usually made with milk/cream and sugar. It also doesn't have caffeine.
What's the flavour of tea with milk? I only use honey or sugar
I’m disappointed they didn’t test microwaved water vs hot water pot
The worst afront to tea since that thing in the Boston harbor.
Nobody puts milk in first nowadays.
You got stupid variables (like cup shape) but didn't bother with either of two very important ones: water temperature and how many times can you use the same tea bag.
There is no "classic tea" with milk, only inferior ones, since milk destroys caffeine molecules. At this point either drink decaf and be happy or leave this earthly plane.
bruh i just put the bag in hot water and is goooood
... I actually agree with Matt... tea is fine without milk
People who don’t drink tea
I favorite tea is made my Lipton, it comes in a powder and is called iced tea.
Drink more tea. 4 cups is not enough.
I usually add the milk after steeping it and removing the tea bag
Just wait for the British people to watch this. You'll regret everything and nothing at the same time.
As a British person. I hate tea.
MatPat, I hear you. The best milk in tea is no milk in tea.
Matt looks likes he is near a mental break down
Interesting.   It would be good to have a final comparison of you best cup with a full, pre-warmed teapot with loose-leaf tea. (One teaspoon per person plus one for the pot) and let it brew in to pot then poured through a teastrainer into the cup.  If you do it that way, it won't make so much of a difference whether you put the milk in first or last, because it will already have been fully steeped in boiling water in the pot, so the cold of the milk won't lower the brewing temperature. (I'm a Brit, btw!)
Me a southerner and can't put milk in tea~ Sun tea- tea left in a glass jar in the sun till it's to your liking add sugar and sip.  This tea has less of the bitter oil and has a strong flavor (Boil methods) Sweet tea: tea with lots of sugar great for whenever Ice tea: tea with ice 👌 perfect for hot days Warm tea: the tea
I am surprised he didn't try different type of milk
Milk in tea?!
personally i feel in Britain we use water first milk last both myself and everyone i know who drinks tea does it that way
wait y'all put milk in your tea
The no microwave preference is never explained
If you're wondering about the milk on top vs bottom, assuming no mixing has occurred, it's most likely due to convection processes. Cool milk on top allows a current and diffusion of temperature to be created that is likely smoother than the reverse option with cooler liquid, i.e. the milk, staying at the bottom and not likely being able to react with the tea as much as milk from the top. Well, that's my best guess anyway.
How would Iroh feel about this…..
Why can't I put it in the microwave?
Spiffing brit wants to know your location
Iroh: *Spittake* "This 'tea' is just hot leaf _juice!"_ Zuko: "Uncle, that's what _all_ tea is." Iroh: "How could a member of my own family say something so _horrible?!"_
In 2022 what the BLANK isn't controversial these days!!??? Drink BLANKING tea how you like it.
6:28 motherly spider senses ACTIVATE
There is also rectangular teabags
Can you save me a cuppa, chaps
2:55 why must you hurt me this way
Milk on top vs bottom, how were they made? Teabag or teapot?  If making with a teabag milk should always go in last, if made with a teapot, it's debatable (but it's traditionally in first)  We need to know your scientific method!
Me: Is it going to be hard to make a subtle Ryan George reference? Steph at 8:58 : Super easy, barely an inconvenience!
The only reason boiling water in the microwave is an issue is possible safety issues, but if you even remotely know what you're doing thats easily avoided. Still, an electric kettle is a nice kitchen appliance to have and I recommend one to anyone who boils water ever. Also, really bothers me when a video acts like tea is primarily a british thing.
You put milk in tea?
As a British person, hearing all these statistics about tea is irrelevant, I already do all of this by nature, except I had never even heard of milk first.
One thing I've always argued about with my mom is that you have to put the sugar in before the water and the two of us will likely never agree on it...
Does the plate really matter? Well if it's a lead plate and your eating tomato's, kind of does
Can somebody explain to me *why* you don't heat your water in a microwave?
We stopped putting the milk in the bottom of the milk after the Victorian era
The True Answer is Milo's Sweet Tea
The funny thing is my old work had a “tea latte” that was half water, half milk, with a tea bag
Mat is correct, milk does NOT belong in tea!!!
I personally like the bitter punch of the tannic acid
How dare!  As a Brit, I've always added milk first, and everyone I've ever known also adds milk first.  Not sure where you got the impression Brits put the milk in first.
important thing/variable-  Paper bag Vs pyramid bag- pyramid bagged tea is usualy differently prepared and the bag is silk not paper. The leafs are bigger, higher quality  and it's usually more expensive (at least here in texas)
before I continue watching I'd like to say that I agree with Mat, no milk in tea is top tier (shall update if I try it with milk again at some point lol) and that's coming from someone who can legit drink a gallon of milk in a day without issue Also so far this is making me realise I've been making my tea at least kind of wrong as usually what I do is boil the water, put the tea bag(s) in for 20 minutes, and then put it in a cup and add around 2 teaspoons of sugar lol  edit: just watched a bit more and apparently milk on top was better and it saddens me to say that's like the first way I tried it and disliked it lol
Oh gosh. The way he dropped the loose leaf tea into her hand was perfect.
As a British person i say you are drinking to little
Milk in tea is disgusting, I agree. Just give me a splash of lemon and I am a happy boy.
BRITAIN WOULD LIKE TO: KNOW YOUR LOCATION HAVE ACCESS TO BROWSER HISTORY
It’s not brewing in the pot that cools the tea. It’s pouring it into the cup.  You expose the hot tea to more cold  porcelain.  Also, pouring it through air has a cooling tower effect on the hot tea stream.
As a British guy who consumes Steph level amounts of tea, (easily 3-4 cups a day), and since I was a kid, it was always:  1. Boil water in kettle 2. Put tea bag in mug (for making a cup for yourself) OR 2 bags in a teapot (if making enough tea for several people) 3. Once water has boiled, add to cup or teapot, depending on desired quantity.  4. Wait 3-5 minutes to steep (this depends on the kind of tea itself you're drinking as well) 5. Add a teaspoon or 2 of milk, to taste, possibly also sugar. (This again depends on the kind of tea.) 6. Enjoy.   As someone who drinks a lot of different kinds of tea, I won't always add milk or sugar. For my standard 3 cups of Earl Grey/day, I'll add a little bit of milk, but no sugar.   However, for something a little sweeter or on the fruity side, like a chamomile, or perhaps some loose leaf tea with little bits of dried fruit and such, I wouldn't add milk.   So that's maybe the other factor that could've been taken into consideration with the experiments. It also depends on the kind of tea itself you're drinking as well. Just my thoughts. :)
Me watching this video while my mug of water is in the microwave- to be fair it’s filtered water and I’ll be steeping it for an appropriate time and using honey, not sugar and no milk
Speaking of proper order of operations, are you ever going to do a follow up on your cheeseburger topping order video with the submissions you asked your viewers for?
As a British person, I make my tea almost exactly the same as in this video.  Only difference is I use flat Yorkshire Tea Gold tea bags and not say PG Tips pyramid tea bags, but yes I put my splash of milk on top in a mug after about 3 minutes, maybe 2 if I’m in a rush. I DO NOT microwave my water.
curious about the use of honey as a sweetener rather than sugar
6:10 Braden (Captain Kidd) is makin waves out here
Insanely unexpected turn of events.
As a Brit’ish person tea is our life and we declared several wars for tea !!!!!!
As a Brit, this video was surprisingly inoffensive.
As matpat said, best tea is without milk. Different traditions in poland. Also more tea variety, such as mint, lemon lime,
I love milk in my teas  Nowadays I use soy milk since I don't do lactose but it still works
I would like to mention that the 1/47 and 1/4 numbers for the milk to tea seems odd as it is 1/4 to WITH 1 cup or 1 cup WITH 47 cups of tea. Wouldn’t 1:4 and 1:47 ratios be a better representation?
Aged Chinese whole leaf tea >>> tea bags
You forgot to see what difference order of adding milk has
Having the hubby brew tea with our auto steeper kettle while watching about tea
okay, i'm def steph, seriously my first word is shai which is tea in my native language and i also drink 4-5 cups a day tea drinkers rise up BUT SERIOUSLY THAT AMERICAN WOMAN PREPARING TEA IS INSULTING MY ENTIRE RACE OF PEOPLE also you forgot a teabag style, no bag (yes, that is a thing) but yeah it's kinda cool how they agreed on which tastes better
I noticed you missed one thing: adding milk before you steep, vs after you steep. This actually changes things quite a bit (basically determines how well you notice the milk). If you want to taste milk more, add it after. If you want to notice the milk less, do it before.
Funnily enough everyone I know will get mad at you if you even suggest putting milk in first! I never have milk in tea. I did when I was younger (and always put the milk in first much to my family and friends horror) but nowadays nahhhhh  I’m my family we make baby tea half milk and half water for the wee yins to have, we’re addicted from the start
Ok but who else has put coffee creamer in the tea
No more puns. Please…
i don't know if it's just my family but here in Brazil there are only two ways of doing tea. "Normal" tea- leafs brewed in the water, just that, no milk / Milk tea - tea BREWED INTO THE MILK, no milk added to the water, the milk REPLACES the water
Me also a Stephanie who loves tea watching this video: 😦😦😦😦
AYO WHERE THE FOOD THEORY INTRO
Fun fact: the first time tea got shipped to england it was sent by portugal as a gift because portugal had just figured out a new route to India, and tea got its name after the letters that were written in the shipping boxes.
Omg I know you didn't just say that 😨 every brit knows milk goes last  Is Tom even British he should know this basic info 😂
The reason people added milk first in the past, was because they used fine china (cups) and were concerned the heat would crack them. So yeah definitely milk after is better as it allows the water to remain hotter and stew the leaf's better
Mat's diet coke addiction and now steph's tea addiction
And you passed over the sugar or no sugar issue?
Have a tea-rrific day everyone 🍵☕🫖🧋
So sad to see them only explore the western brewing methods.
So when is the Tipping episode coming. Obviously the results will be skewed to not paying tips because you have a large Non-American base
The fact that Brits have so thoroughly claimed tea - INVENTED IN ASIA, keep in mind - as "their" defining cultural trait is probably THE most brazenly-colonialist thing I've ever seen.
Am I the only one questioning why the UK is being considered the supposed authority on tea and not China or Japan?
I mean only psychos still put milk in first even in the uk. This includes my dad
Food Theory idea: why do some drinks stain clothing and others don't?
I’m with you on the no milk in tea lol
Uncle Iroh would be proud
Tom is so much taller than he looks on gtlive (yes I know that he is usually sitting but I'm still surprised) Also I now need to make a cup of tea 🍵
Milk first was to protect the fine china origionally used to consume tea! Milk first isnt right anymore haha
when is someone gonna make an Uncle Iroh joke?
where’s spiffing brit when you need him
Love how they're all unanimous about not using the microwave, but never explained why that was a bad option, or even experimenting with it beyond the full tictoc method.
I'm watching this video while drinking tea
Dawko will be mad
Live MAS?
As a Brit, I don’t think i’ve ever seen someone put milk in first, that’s just wrong
As a Brit I ain’t never seen anybody put milk in fist
how about metal mugs/steiners? i use them for my milk/coffee/tea...
Cries in hand-washing*
But the british way _is_ tea first...
i argree with mat no milk is best tea - (though I like fruit teas more then milk teas in general)
Tea AND Skip?!💖💖💖😼
Japanese Tea>limey tea
After watching this, I made myself a cup of tea.
I think you missed an important factor here: the temperature of the water. It clearly have an impact on the tea, some wants the tea leaves to hit boiling water, others want it just below boiling point or even colder. Also, did the microwave impact the taste or was it just MatPat's burning himself that disqualified it? I know using a microwave is wrong but the science me can't explain why.  “No,” he said, “look, it’s very, very simple … all I want … is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen.” And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn’t get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company. “So that’s it, is it?” said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished. “Yes,” said Arthur, “that is what I want.” “You want the taste of dried leaves in boiled water?” “Er, yes. With milk.” “Squirted out of a cow?” “Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose …”
The same people that put their milk first, are the same ones who do that with cereal.
3-4 cups of tea a day?  us brits go through that in an hour xD
I think the reason why Matt does like milk in his tea, is because his dad never came back with it.😂😂😂
"she merely adopted tea" yea so did the brits
No milk in tea is PERFECT!
The first time I was exposed to the idea of putting milk in before tea was in the intro to this video
As an American who grew up with a Nana from The UK, she always made best tea. Even when learning as a barista how to make tea and tea lattes. I only like my Nana's hot tea. 2 teaspoons sugar, hot water and a small splash of milk with her tea of choice that day(can range from green to a herbal blackberry) 😊
I'm a British and I like tea
Just to note, as someone who likes tea a lot, a lot of tea pots and books about tea will recommend “preheating” your teapot with plain water to both heat the pot and also rinse out any stuff in the teapot. This same thing that might have changed the results of the tea cup heatedness since the inside would have been heated not only once but three times with the other two having lost heat to another cup before being added to the other ones.
As a certified Bri'ish man. I am appalled at the way those tiktok cretins made their tea. Though I am chuffed you decided to try and make the perfect tea (our way.. or at least the manchester way idk). This video does not ruin my tea experience!
What, no Gaiwan? No Gong fu cha? No chanoyu? I'm sorry, but "British" is not a proper category of tea nerds.
He didn't do temperature variable.
Agree or disagree if you will but i make my tea by boiling water in a kettle then individual placing a tea bag in the mug stir until mixed Then remove the tea bag, now i can do either one of two things, i can either add sugar to the tea before the milk of after pouring the milk, after i add the sugar and the milk i would stir the tea until the tea tastes sweet Is me making my tea without placing the milk at the bottom wierd
As a Brit I can tell you the ONLY way to make tea   Put tea bag in mug  Boil the kettle with fresh water  Pour boiling water into tea bag Leave for a minimum 2 minutes  Then a small splash of milk and a tea spoon of sugar if needed
Nice! How I do it mostly fits with what make the "best" tea. Yay!
This is odd timing because as of like yesterday I suddenly became interested in tea (I usaully dont like tea but i decided i give it another chance)
not even 2 min in the video and those jokes gave me a stroke...
as a brit first off I also tend not to have milk but when I do I have NEVER put milk first and a lot of people at my college seem to agree milk is that last thing to go in the cup
Hey Ma tPat! How many cup of tea can u make from 1 teabag?
The only British "tradition" you've shaken off was how poor people made their tea due to low quality cups that they couldn't afford to replace the cup if it broke.  It would be nice to see a coffee version of this, as I have heard people making coffee by adding milk to their coffee before adding the hot water, which would be interesting to see how that stacks up against other methods of making coffee.  P.S: Sometimes if you are going to add sugar to tea you'd put that into the cup before you add the hot water.
the temperature in the last exteriment... you warmed the glass cup twice before filling it with the definitive water, in the coldest cup, that water went from cold glass to cold cup, the second from warm glass to cold cup, and finally the glass already hot got its water... , that would explain much better the diference in temperature.
I don’t love that the teabag had a bulge
In Pakistan there's another variation of tea called "doodh patti". No water is used. It's just milk and tea. Which means that a lot more tea is used, but it tastes pretty good.
I like homemade hot chocolate I also like herbal tea
The milk first thing depends on tea pot or bag straight in mug, too. For a tea pot, the tea brews in the pot,so adding milk first is fine, but you do not put the milk in before the teabag! Didn't test for that difference, did you?
Hey Matt Pat. Can you bite off your finger like a carrot?
as a brit i always put milk on the top
I know this would be a question but how about the type of milk because the milk like almond milk or silk milk
Strange that you didn’t go thought brew temperature when you went though the trouble of time.
people drink their tea with MILK??!?!??
as a chinese person: no.
Wtf??? Milk??? Wtf is wrong with you?
Why am I hearing The Spiffing Brit laughing maniacal like ?
The puns in this episode were TEAdious... 🌿
Why are you guys all drinking out of the same mugs
normal teabags are fine, it isnt needed to use a pyramid teabag but if you want to then it's up to you. Have tea how ever you like, you're the one drinking it but if you are making it for someone else ask them how they like their tea.
When yall talking about color, it would be nice if viewers can see the color
Dang it Matt Pat quit TEAsing us
3-4 CUPS A DAY!! english and irish people: pathetic

I'm afraid that the results in this video are skewed, and/or tampered with. First up is the steeping. I saw Steph stirring the sieve around a bit. It is slow, but could make a difference. You'll have to make new test results when the bags and sieve are just sitting there, are moved around now and again, moved around constantly, and at different speeds. Another factor to consider is dipping the bag after steeping. Straight onto the saucer without dipping, dripping or shaking? Let it drip? Shake it? Dip a couple of times before all of the above? On that note, need more combinations of water, tea and milk order (in a cup). Pour the water on the bag, or dip the bag in the water? Pour the milk on the bag then the water, or the bag on the milk then the water? At least 7 different combinations can be achieved here. Now lets talk about the cups. Not only are they of different materials but also different shapes. True, these are the things you'd find in your typical teacup store, but my mother has drunk tea out of different cups with almost the same shape and has tasted a difference. Chances are that while the material seems the same to the untrained eye it can be a difference in quality, who made them and how cheaply. Not to run up your bill, but if you want to have accurate results on whether different materials (non-porous) make the tea taste differently you'll have to have cups made in the same shape and size. As you said, the wider rim makes it cool down quicker, and sometimes can affect the taste (steeping in a more rapidly cooling water).  Now what do I know? Cinnamon & Apple, some lemon in and honey on the side when one gets a cold. And no, no milk for the lactose intolerant.
UK I see ppl just love coffee.. so.. just some Britain's like or love tea.. HOW MUCH TIMES WILL THEY MAKE TEA JOKES COUNT SOMEONE COUNT PLZ X3  I actually hate waste so I do water get my tea bag out and water out of it so no waste. I do big cups so like it strong. Then! Then can do the taste like sugar and milk to tea bag won't soak in the sugar or milky goods to trash..
But what’s the best milk for tea🤔🤣
i ad suger to my tea, i think thats a veriable you forgot about.
Matt patt thinking that 4 cups of tea a day is a lot. You should just go meet the average British adult, they likely drink more
*Step away from my leafy soup and no one gets hurt!*
Am i the only one who doesnt put milk in my tea??? It sounds so gross
hi
Problem with the temperature in the glass mug, you used the glass mug to fill the other mugs..  you raised the starting temp of the mug by pouring hot water into it several times before using it for tea
Gong fu is the best way to prepare tea
So the best way to make British tea?  There is so much variation to making tea (steeping, water temp, milk, mixing green tea, etc) based on the type of tea leaves.
I was wondering how much material for the kettle would play into the taste. A porcelain, an aluminum, or a copper kettle
I am a British person but I dont rly drink tea
Needed a tea video
Tea is for the Asians
I love tea...especially Bigelow brand. I have every flavor they make except like 2 that I don't like
The Spiffing Brit entered the chat.
As a British person I don't know anyone who pours milk first
idea: can u straggle someone with a pasta noodle. specifically angle hair pasta
What's the point of microwaving the water if you're just going to cool it down with milk *before* putting the teabag in?
I thought my mother going to the ER this morning would be the worst thing, but dear god those puns. The Instanitea
You did not go into the type of milk (whole, 2%, skin, half and half or condensed).
Once again Tik Tock is the worst place to get culinary advice.
Now that we have this video I want to bring a big controversy. Are coffee and tea, the same thing. My basis on this is basically what a tea is considered, an infusion, and coffee is just the same, water that's infused with the flavors of coffee.
*You have provoked the British Empire.*
I think matpat fails to realize in a teapot the time you wait for that water to cool is the same time you wait for it to cool in a mug. Literally no difference except you pay for a teapot
It would have been pretty nice if they tried different kinds of milk to determine which made the best flavored milk tea
What kind of milk do you use? That is a massive deal. Whole milk and skim milk are WAY different!
I believe that loose leaf tea can be strapped for many times and as you keep using the leaves the taste gets better.
When you announced on of the tests was how much milk to add I was immediately like “best milk is no milk” and then mat pat and I shared the same opinion so thats nice. The only time milk is okay in tea is when its cold milk tea possibly with tapioca or boba. Definitely not  hot tea and milk.
Yeaaaa tea is meant to be ice cold and full of sugar
The only time I've seen people put milk in first, is when the tea was stewed in a pot, rather than the mug. And that only comes from knowing its sat for a few mins, and you're confident in your brewing skills. But, still, even that is a risky move. Milk last is easier.   Never tea first if it's a water in mug situation.  Then again, no milk is the best solution overall
Now what if you steam the milk first?
This video is so wrong
I like tannins, in my tea.
me, a chinese person: 🥲
Waiting here for Spiff
Wish their were more closeups of the colour
I will say, in the East Midlands we do add milk last. Good to know we are doing something right 👍
Overbrewed tea is like soapy water but good tea just hits different
He really is bold yknow risking people just starting the video disliking and un subbing not even watching the video.
Having declared NOT the loose leaves as the best is a clear error in methodology. Since it IS much stronger, you dont need as much of it as the shitty off cuts of the low grade bagged tea...
I'm with Matpat. I don't put milk in my tea. Only a lil sugar.
does anyone else put in sugar..
How... this is the first video where youve actually took the easy way out. Youre getting old matpat. Young you would have tested every combination of every variable... but you didnt :(( also you should have bought triangle tea bags, opened two, put one into the classic paper bag and one into the little claw to stop the.. idk age, storage condition, leaf quality and amount of tea from changing the result
As a British person I always felt milk in first was blasphemy. Now I can point them this way in future. Thanks for winning my tea based arguments in the future!
As a person of England I am in disbelief of the way they put the “tea” in the microwave
yeah tea sucks hot cocoa is best
Hmm I normally used whiskey instead of milk
Since I'm more of a coffee person, I'd love some coffee testing
Milk first or after is a common argument among brits on how to make tea, while some regions tend to put the milk in first (Mostly up north where the china would have been cheaper more often than not, to the south where most would have good china and put the milk in after) Also you didn't explore sugar in tea and when it should be added or have a tea cozy for your teapot!
As a British person, I can say that nobody under the age of 60 puts milk in before the water. It's like pouring the milk before the cereal. Weirdos. Also, as for what vessel you drink out of? I'm a firm believer in tea always tastes better out of china. Teacup or mug is irrelevant, it just has to be china.   Also, the fact you always put the water before the teabag and didn't try THAT the other way around? I always do teabag first. Why wasn't THAT a tested variable?
Britis are gross
I'm going out on a limb here, but I bet mat voted for biden.
Tally-ho consulting us Brits on this subject. I’m the same: 3-4 cups a day. I’m a real Mad Hatter. 🇬🇧 🎩 🫖  Having said that, WE NEVER PUT THE BLOODY MILK IN FIRST!!! 😡 Wherever you learned that is rubbish!
I put tea first, hot water and then sugar (optional) and milk (optional)
Yeah no British people pour the milk on the bottom anymore lol
as a brit, its actually seen as weird if you put milk in first, some people do it, but its far more common to my knowledge to see the brits add milk on top
As a British person Wtf Never put the milk first do not put it in the microwave you are a psychopath to do both those things
You used too much loose tea/ or not enough water with it.  Loose to is more economical in providing more taste while using less tea.
You all got it wrong... Sugar and milk DO NOT belong in tea! It's best consumed unsweetened with a lemon. Also, water gets poured OVER the bag. Not heated with the water.
Tea bag, boiling water, remove bag, sugar (if any), milk. The only way. And I can defend every step if anyone would like to fight me. 👍🏻
As a bengali/indian, everything in this video is offensive to me, and as the original tea country, all of you are wrong
tea mugs get used for certain teas and over time the cups get stained whick is hard to remove over time
I personally prefer Irish breakfast tea over English breakfast tea. Also my dad's favorite part of having a cup of tea is sucking the tea bag after its done steeping. Don't ask me why, no one knows but he does drink his tea and coffee straight so it might have something to do with that
I'm British and this video was fun.. Will say the milk first or second is a taste preference. From personal experience I prefer milk first.
I ask matpat: ehem please make the most sour lemon aid (with the most matalic after taste aka ruining the lemon aid) making it have a matalic after taste ruins it so please here my plea  Love, FoxClawz ☺
I dont leave my tea bag in haha, I move it up and down until the tea has a certain color and then take it out
And then the rest of asia says other wise. I wonder how this compares to traditional styles of tea service?
Woah a minute in and the order is being questioned  As a Brit I can guarantee it’s tea bag then water then milk then sugar if wanted  You can see the levels of diffusion from the colours in the mug and it’s clear what order is the best  In fairness a teapot and milk or just when milk is added is debatable
Milk on the tea is so bad...
As someone who doesn't drink tea the milk thing was a complete surprise to me
Green tea gang represent. (With lemon of course)
Royaltea :3
Hi, 15 cuppa a day guy here. You always put the milk in last! You also have to mind that Scots have better water than the rest of you.
I feel like your dismissal of heating the water via microwave was unfairly biased based on the fact that you only tested it with the "TikTok tea" which lost out, seemingly, due to the presence of far too much milk. Further testing is warranted if you truly want to make the "perfect" cup of tea. Does the method of heating the water matter? Microwave vs percolator vs boiling on the stove? (Personally, I just run water through my Keurig without a pod inserted.) Also, I use the flat paper tea bags, but I don't just let them sit to steep. I swish them around in the water, and I feel that this helps the steeping process develop stronger flavor faster.
Me: *sees title*  Me: MAT HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT TEA! *calls spiffing brit*  Sees rest of video: you're on thin ice
Lmao as a fellow North Carolinian I steep my tea for about an hour and then add copious amounts of sugar into it
Oh geese, hot drinks. The stuff that burns your insides so the church tells you not to. The only tea that I've ever heard is ok to drink is urbal tea. And that stuff is disgusting. Also I hate hot drinks, I don't like getting burned in any way shape or form.
All of the differing tea opinions are fascinating but I'm just happy we all seem to mostly like tea, one way or another.
The microwave is easily one of the best and most cursed inventions of all time
Video idea: Can you bake a cake with playdough
you forgot about sun brewed tea you gotta try that too
I love lemon ginger tea
I'm sorry for saying this small little factor but depending on which earl grey you buy at tesco you can get a circular tea bag I know the own brand definitely has these circular bags but I'm not to sure
So who's the A mug for? M for Mat, S for Steph. A not for Ollie or Skip. Who the A for!?!
This is a tearrific video
I’m making tea while watching this episode  And also I’d recommend using different methods of brewing loose leaf tea
I’m watching this video while making tea
I got excited when you said you were getting help from Tom from the UK, I thought this would be a collaboration with the Spiffing Brit, lol.
The next one would be to see which type of tea is the best
As a British person if you put the milk in first you shouldn’t even look at a tea bag again
I add coffee creamer 😂
Well to start with you failed not having Yorkshire tea, the best tea. Then by even contemplating adding milk first I have to report this video as a hate crime
tea is bloody garbage, mate
Sea of Thieves Diet survival please
Matpat's opinion about milk in tea is completely correct
MatPat shoulda used Yorkshire Tea Gold. That’s the best tea in Britain
As a Texan, hot tea is only for when you're sick
This video has been very informative, I shall enjoy tea for the first time ever!!!
I'm disappointed that they didn't actually test boiled water vs microwaved water. They just said "Oh, microwave bad because you'll burn your hands!" as if oven mitts or tea towels aren't a thing. I want to know how microwaving your water makes your tea bad, because there are tea snobs out there who lose their minds when people microwave water.
I have always prefer tea over coffee, I´m not brittish
Less than an hour ago I watched a video about making coffee
As an American the microwaved tea physically hurt.
I like to not even worry about brew time for my tea lol I just leave the bag in and start sipping once it cools down
I've tried tea a few times and it just tasted like scented water, I guess next time i'll try it this way and see if it tastes any different
But whats the difference between microwave and kettle water? Also if you have another avocado pit, put it in a bag with a damp paper towel till pokes out a root. You can also peel the dark brown skin off the pit after soaking it in warm (but not hot) water to help with mold. You could do an entire theory on avocados 😂
Bubble tea experiments should be a sequel
Mat forgot about whether you put the water or teabag in first
As a ceramic artist, I am weeping. Guys, please PLEASE do the material test again and actually get a decent testing sample pool. When I was in school, we were actually encouraged to do this kind of test regularly with all the cups or mug we would make. Ceramic mugs vary a lot and if you get one from an artist, they can 100% make it so that it will affect aroma and temperature a LOT. Ceramic itself has a lot of variables. Stoneware, porcelain, and red clay bodies will all have different heat retention. Thickness of the clay also varies things too. A flared out lip or a thick base will affect things heavily. A single mug does not adequately reflect the variability that is ceramic!
My family had a Keurig and I just put the tea packet into the coffee pod slot. It tastes great with any tea.
I'm a brit and I have NEVER seen anyone put milk in first, that's not the british way so we dunk on you americans
3 or 4 cups? Those are rookie numbers :p
I dont have a kettle
I almost jumped out of my window from all of the Tea jokes
Wow, discovering tea is better if you make tea properly... What a shocking revelation
I don't really care HOW my tea is brewed. So long as it wasn't in a microwave, and it has some honey or sugar in it.  Also, I am a HUGE fruit tea person and Chai person.
He’s not British if he was putting milk in first I’ve never known a single British person to put milk in first we always put it in after the water is in and been stirred enough
A BBC Tea Doc, said that Tea should steep for 8 min
For the lactose Intolerant of us,  milk subs?
This is my favorite food TEAory episode
I have never put milk first. Not a fan of tradition, i prefer better taste
you forgot about the milk variable. there's a billion different kinds of milk these days and i wonder if what kind of milk you use will have an effect on the taste of the tea.
I put in milk last
An Anarchy way: Milk then Teabag then Water
Thanks matpat for telling us to put our milk in after our tea but unfortunately we have been doing that for at least 80 years considering that's how my grandparents taught me 😂 The tradition broke a while ago.
Southern sweet tea is peak tea
I expect at least one Uncle Iroh reference.
I’m American and I was able to live in England for a time. They made me a tea lover but I don’t make the tea like they do. I actually do put the milk on top but after watching this video I might make some changes to the brew time.
Milk tea is no tea. For real, your tea loses all positive health propertieas if you add milk
I 100% agree with matt, the best tea does not contain milk
I didn't know you put milk in tea- i always just put hot leaf water with sugar
They ignored all of the other regions that make and drink tea, like China, India and Japan.

Really enjoyed this video! Would love a part 2 or more comparisons of drinking vessels.
But you missed one argument that's common among my friends; do you put in the milk before or after taking out the tea bag?
Mat did you do the milk on the bottom version combined with steeping the actual tea in a tea pot? Surely the tea leaves themselves are what is creating that sourness. But if you put milk in you cup, and then pour tea allready steeped in a pot into that cup you should eliminate this factor. And that would still make the British way the correct one.
The milk on botum and on top can also aply to creamer in coffee. My mom swares its creamer on the bottom where as dad says creamer on top
Pls comment section tell me, do Americans dont drink tea or is matpat trying to be sarcastic by saying that stephanie is special?? Im really confused and scared for how horrible America might be if he was serious 😭😭😭
But can't the other options change the previous outcomes? As in, maybe for a Glass cup more milk would make it better, or a round tea bag for 5 mins.
never seen anyone put milk first - all the brits
Who puts milk in tea?
I'm with Matpat on this one. Tea doesn't come with milk in it. Just honey or a small bit of sugar.
man more patterrz is gonna get a bit steamy when he sees this
Tea Tok !?
“Boston tea party summarized” I can’t 😂
Also when using lose leaf tea you need to rinse the tea leafs to waken the tea leaves also the frist cup of tea with lose leaf sucks its better to use the second steep of it because the tea flavor starts to more prominent
As another British person commenting. Putting milk in first is one of the worst things to do. Its always a splash at the end
I don’t even like tea 😅
Are the mugs they are using Labeled Matt and Steph?
Are the mugs they are using Labeled Matt and Steph?
You missed something! water type, a lot of tap water is what is know as hard water. You should redo with purified water, hard water, soft water etc.
when i saw them cut up a teabag and name it "loose leaf" i dissvalidated the opinion of the video.  Also, the tea pot should be filled with hot water before the tea is steeped. ITs so that the porcelain gets warm, and downt cool off the tea too much.   jk, love yalls videos
I do tea classically.  Pour hot water to the tea leaves.  Wait 2-5 minutes. And drink after that.  Don't really like bagged tea.
Why didn't you test the temperature?
There's no way I just wasted 1 hour pressing the left arrow key to keep hearing him say HELLO INTERNET...
I never put milk in my tea.
You live in North Carolina now, Matpat, so you should know the best way to make tea is ice cold with sugar, southern style ....
Love you guys but just so you know everyone in Britain DOES put the milk in after the tea, unless you’re very old or insane. So basically we’re right about all of it 😂
3 to 4 cups is nothing
I don't really care. everybody taste and interest are different. it's like making the perfect wheel and expecting it to fit on a smart car, on motorcycle, a 18-wheeler, and a off-roader. there is no right nor correct way of doing anything food/art related. just because most people like it one way doesn't mean everybody like it that way.
Tea an burgers have layers in common
Hmmm
Where the sugar at though? 😆 My husband is british and said you gotta cover the perfect sugar ratio 😋
That's how we make tea in New Zealand 🇳🇿 just not fussed on the bag shape so yea welcome to the right way to make tea 🤣 we knew it all along lol
Mat, you should get some Rooibos Tea for Steph.
I agree with mat why milk lol
The only reason milk was put in to tea first was, because originally back in the days of olde, Tea was served in thin China cups and hot tea would break the bone china so cold milk was added first to soften the blow of the hot tea. Today folk drink out of mugs & paper cups etc so that milk first doesnt matter. Also back then Tea was hellishly expensive & only for the higher society types and locked in a caddy that the lady of the house would keep upon her. Bit like sugar was when that first became a thing, I mean if you look into what the first uses of sugar were it would boggle the mind. Also it was drinking tea that made people eventually realise that boiling the water killed germs as people who drank tea didn't get ill as much as those slurping rott water. Don't quite remember how this came about but it did somewhere along the chain.
Y'all should try this experiment with coffee and enjoy the chaos that unfolds when the caffeine hits everyone!!!! 🤣🤣
As a portuguese, i'm just here to say T.E.A or Transporte de Ervas Aromáticas... I don't know, but it seems like a very portuguese word. I mean, just ask to Catarina de Bragança, the portuguese monarch that took the habit of drinking TEA or Chã to England when she married Carles II of England. Well, i apologize for that, but stop know us for our strong coffe that we took from Brazil natives and start know us for the hot water that we took from our friends from China lol. Also, how does England get the fame of drinking Tea and be the european country that bring the tea to the world when it was us that first drink it in Europe? Mat Pad, just make a video on that!!!!
I’m a Brit and I’ve always poured the milk on top
I'm with MatPat. I prefer no milk in my tea. I like to taste the flavors especially chai
I would imagine that putting the milk first makes the tea taste more sour because your heating up the milk suddenly and quickly. Where as when you pour tea first, the milk diffuses into the tea from the top and heats more gently. Which also makes me wonder if hot/steamed milk would make for a better cup of tea vs cold milk.
Polish cup of tea. Tea first, boiling water second. Do not use milk, you can use sugar if you are a pus... too weak. And drink immediately when it has over 80 C degrees, later it loses taste.
oh please guys I hope you dont divorce over a washing machine. like me.....
You're all wrong, it should be iced and sweet!
Sad US sweet iced tea
The UK and US aren’t the only tea drinkers. Watching Pakistani people drink their milk chai is an experience.  Safia, at reactistan, makes hers on the stove. Water, leaves and milk all in the pot, then poured through a sieve into a mug. They all seem to swear by it throughout the day.   Me? Coffee. No tea.
Ok but where is milk vs cream?
I love tea and I'm Polish. I drink few mugs of tea a day and more than 3 or 4
ELLO GOVNAH, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?
that on mam and daughter ruined tea no tap water KETTLLLLLLLEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YOU put milk in tea
Steph and I would get along great. We both love tea!
👏👏👏
As a Brit im confused… I never put the milk in first.
I put honey in my tea
Also matt you should of investigated whether blue or green milk is better (if yankees have different colours, who knows)
Finally!
I'm American and I don't put milk in my tea also I drink cold tea if I want hot I make coffee
Ok but the mugs though... If M is Matt and is Stephanie... who's A? Is it like Christmas? Is it Ash's mug? Who's A ? Afton ??
PG tips explains almost this entire videos message in less than 30 seconds 8 years ago. https://youtu.be/IWQtX0-9aZ0
Why didn't you bring Matt Rose, Grian, Mumbo Jumbo, or any other British YTer to taste test afterwards?
I learn more from this video in 20 mins than 1 hour in science class, you should be a teacher. Thanks MatPat!
I like my tea bitter and strong tho xD
I’m going to be radical and say no milk in the tea.
Did you know that tea is a soup?
its just fucking tea
Tldr: Yorkshire tea is the best
Steph I'm with you! I fill my dishwasher with my tea mugs too!
MatPat, DailyMail, is not national newspaper, it is fucking international yellow tabloid!
Pretty sure the reason the glass was hotter is because you used it to pour on the other cups
My fellow Americans, yell know a kettle  is only 20 dollars.. and you almost never need to replace  them
My parents always put milk in first and I always add milk last, thank you for backing me up. I can send them this if the debate ever comes up again 😂
But what is the best type of milk there's cow milk, almond, cashue, peanut, hemp, goat, soy, coconut milk, and others
Professor Layton approves of this episode lol
One of the reasons your glass mug was hotter may have been that you were using it to fill the other mugs. The other two got hot water poured into cold mugs whereas the glass cup was already warmed from having hot water poured into it twice before. Also, I thought I read that you were supposed to warm a teapot with hot water which is then discarded before filling it to steep the tea. Otherwise, the water that you heated to proper steeping temperature would be cooler than it was supposed to be. And I'm with MatPat on the no milk in tea, though I do occasionally like a touch of lemon in it. Cheers!
7:02 I can't help but wonder why would anyone wear fancy shoes inside their own kitchen..?
This whole episode is extremely passive aggressive.
I didn't knew tea had milk in it, the way I do it is just water, the teabag and a bit of sugar
Funny story! I always drink my green tea wrong. Anyone who drinks green tea knows that not only is the "best" kind the matcha powder, and not meant to be boiling hot. However, I drink the cheap stuff that comes in a box in little bags from the supermarket with the hottest water imaginable. Unfortunately, I have aquired a taste for it. It's my cup of tea. I don't know why lol
I’m British and I find tea is best in its most generic form. Don’t overthink it. Please. Please don’t overthink it.
We so need an extra episode about how much sugar should be added as well xD
Wait, people drink tea with milk?
I SHALL DEFEND MAT ON THE WHOLE NO MILK IN TEA!!!
I'm amazed that milk is what people pour in tea i always did sweetener or pure tea, never in my life have i seen a person put milk in their tea
Tea bags are for poor people. Only loose leaf tea is good and tea pot is superior. I agree with the milk amount chosen. 4 minutes. You also forgot the honey. You get yourself a jar or orange blossom honey, dip a tea spoon into it and allow the honey that clings onto it to stir into tea once you add your milk.
Porous? Who's drinking out of cups with holes?
the puns.... THE PUNSS
As someone who also drinks 3-4 cups of tea a day, I'm just grateful to you for making this. Now I know how to make perfect tea! Not even the tea-rific ammount of puns is gonna change that.
Also water temperature also affects tea taste and water quality ie minerals and chemical additives depending if your government puts chemicals in the water to help clean the water
You missed a factor: when it comes to heating the tea, you tested microwave or kettle, but what about a teapot (as i, the one you put on the stove and it whistles when the water is boiling)?  It feels like it should have been included.  Also, I would find it interesting to see an analysis of what's the best way to make milkless tea.  What sort of sweetener works best, for instance, and whether putting it on bottom or top matters.  For me, in my tea (my favorite is Lady Grey, but Earl Grey is also quite tasty), I put a copious amount of honey in first before the water.  But it would be interesting to know if there's an objectively better way that I haven't tried.
I actually never tried milk in tea, maybe I should try it mhhhh
Milk in tea pff, that's not tea.
The proper modern British way to make tea  Add sugar (optional)  Add your Yorkshire gold teabag  (what else?)  Fill cup with boiled water to 90% of the volume of the cup (account for displacement of teabag)  Leave to stew for 5 to 10 mins (Or if you forget, 45 mins😅🤦‍♂️)  Remove teabag, not optional  Add milk so it makes up around 5 to 10% of the tea
I agree with MatPat.   Get that Bovine juice out of my tea, you heretics!
What if pour milk and tea sametime?
only 3-5 minute steep time? I literally just leave and let it sit for like 30 minutes
Tea actually was give to a british queen by the Portuguese and on the crates there was t for transporte
I’m not British, but I do like me some tea. 😮
Wait, there's major oversight imo! What about warmed milk? Warm milk wouldn't curdle as easily, which is what probably happened to the milk-first cup and why it was sour.  Also for coffee you'd use steamed milk (capuccino) or warm milk (to add into an espresso)... So why not for tea? Why was this not tested at all?
How could you drink tea with milk.... ???
I can't stand milk in tea, so I'm on your side MatPat.
They didn’t try the different types of milk…
*SIPS IMPERFECT TEA* MMMMMM
Tea is is just bad in general.
I think they forgot to mention if they use spring water or tap water
I’d love to see the Spiffing Brit in this comment section… that’d make my day
but other than the burning hand, why shouldnt use the microwave?
How you get the water boiling doesn't matter! Microwave doesn't have any effect on taste of the water. As lone as you have it at the same temperature for the same amount of time. You just have to experiment with the right amount of time to run the microwave and how long to let it cool. The perfect ratio is up to the individual, but I promise there is a way to make it perfect for you
i may be a bit crazy in my tea habit. i let my tea sit for about 10 minutes, with no milk and 1-2 teaspoons sugar
There is literally nothing wrong with microwaves, stop gatekeeping heating up water.
Gonna go make tea using... eh, most of what I learned here today. Don't have pyramid bags.
I'm pretty sure almost everyone I know makes tea exactly like that lol, what I'm questioning is whether you should remove the tea bag before putting in the milk or not cuz I know a few people who leave the tea bag in when they pour in the milk (which is arguably wrong in my opinion)
The puns. The puns. ❤❤❤
I have builders tea
Love ya vids man
I love herbal tea. I use as little sugar as possible now and I still love it
The fact that Matpat had to explain that there where different types of tea made me realize exactly how British I am. Like????? This isn't all common knowledge????
No French press?
I have never put milk in my tea, and I refuse to add it in the future
Do you guys pay Simon Whistler royalties for redoing his content?
That's way to much milk for one cup of tea...all you need is 1-1.5 teaspoons, if you need to add any milk at all. Also, East Frisian tea is the best!
Brit’s don’t put milk in first. Traditional Builders Tea is steep, then a splash of milk
i like tea
As a British person I have never seen anyone put the milk in first and would be very concerned if they did
Me being from Poland and seeing milk in tea: wait... is that even legal?
the PERFECT amount of milk to add to tea is EXACTLY 0mL
An entire video about tea variables and not once did they put the tea bag in the cup before the water.
As an American who occasionally drinks tea, here's my method.  Lazy Method Step 1:  Get a measuring cup (at least 1 cup) full of water Step 2: Heat at high power in the microwave for 2:30 Step 3: Pour water over the tea bag in the mug Step 4: Cover the mouth and let steep for 5 minutes Step 5: Add sweetener (two teaspoons of sugar or some honey) Step 6: Let cool for 3-5 minutes  Non-Lazy Method Step 1: Get a medium-sized stove pot and fill it with 1-2 cups of tea. Step 2: Cover and heat until boiling Step 3: Transfer water to mug and add tea bag Step 4: Cover the mug and let steep for 5 minutes Step 5: Add sweetener (two teaspoons of sugar or some honey) Step 6: Let cool for 3-5 minutes  The lazy method is quicker, but the tea is weaker tasting. The non-lazy way is slower, but the tea has a more robust flavor. Also, I only use a pot because I don't have a tea kettle.  I also don't add milk because I don't like the taste of it, and I actually prefer to use just enough sweetener that it's not bitter but not too much that it takes away from the flavor.
See, the problem is equating British with "traditional" method...
Brits gonna have a time with this one
He's right, milk belongs in coffee not in tea
Wired no intro
what difference does the microwave make? so long as the water gets to temp, it doesn't matter what happens. Is it a concern about other smells/flavors leftover in the microwave?
11:00 but, I like bitter tea, I despise sugar as a Brit
For me, milk in tea is some kind of crime
Brits caring about “proper Tea” when it’s their colonial destruction of a 1/3rd of the world that brought them tea is very on-brand.
You actually forgot a variable: water temperature. Most teas are not brewed both boiled water but a little bit below that point. Apparently that changes the oxygen content of the water and the flavor
im scared of matpat tbh
I'm a bit disappointed steeping temperature wasn't covered, but otherwise a good episode.
ROFL I'm on the exact opposite end! I like peppermint and lemon ted with some remon juice mixed in!.
Your tea sucks you don't use real tea you need to use lose leaf tea and not use sugars
Cup of tea, mate?
What kind of milk did you use?
Food TEA ory
Well if your in north Carolina, y'all should probably try some sweet tea stuff
On sprouting the avocado: if you've not done it already, a food theory about how avocado species (and other fruit/vege species) grow from seed or grafting would be great! Eg, the potential of that avocado to produce a tree that makes tasty avocados is incredibly small. Same with apples grown from seed. But some other veggies - no probs! Grow them from a seed and you have no problems. Interesting, huh?
Why should I not Heat my water in the Microwave?
MILK DOES NOT BELONG IN TEAAAAAAAA.  I'm from Canada and we take our tea pretty serious at least those of us that drink it.  Milk in tea is practically a crime as far as I'm concerned,  a little bit of sugar or honey but just barely.  in a well made cup of tea it doesn't need more than that.  but now all I want is a good cup of tea so i don't have to imagine that tictoc tea ever again.  also you should be pouring the hot water over the tea bag not putting the bag in the hot water.  this episode made me cry for the tea
0:09 People on the southern hemisphere: Yep, preaty toasty weather of 40°(Celsius)
now do this with Oriental tea LOl
the only reason milk was added first was because the tea was already hot and steeped were as if you are making it in a cup you add milk after your tea is steeped
Oh... No... The spiffing britt ain't gonna like that.... Well unless yorkshire tea gold is involved in this.
Also no milk is best tea. Just a bit of raw honey. That's what I'm drinking while I watch this.
blind taste test of tiktok tea vs regular would be better
My Southerner senses are tingling…
So turns out I drink it the right way and always have. Nice! 😁 Gotta get myself more of those expensive pyramid bag teas though.
As a British person I can now point to this when I pour the milk in after the tea. However I agree with Matpat... no milk (in tea or coffee) is the best milk!
Horace would say "aurea mediocritas", golden middle way.
am I weird for never knowing that people put milk in tea I’ve only ever had tea with water
Now for all the other teas
You actually did make the brits mad, just read the comment section lmfao
Yeah, but only Brits drink tea with milk, where I'm from we often put a slice of lemon inside instead
i prefer punjabi chai and nothing can stop me
Mate é de longe o melhor chá
steff drinking alot of tea sounds like a Caffeine addiction. Drank multiple teapots worth  per day before i stopped.
Am British and love tea
Steph that's nothing I got a friend who goes through 4 or 3 a morning
People might get mad at me for this,  But what about sugar? Or honey in your tea?
Sorry, I'm a bit too southern for this. I don't drink it by the cup, I drink it by the pitcher.
Drink Tea how you want to. If you want to make it like the King is about to taste test it, go for it. If you want to make it like you live in a trailer and have 7 shotguns, do it
Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh
Lol as a British person, my tea addiction is not seasonal
I heard a tip with tea bags was to dip it in and out of the water at least 3 times before letting it seep in the water.  I also use the water from my Keurig coffee maker, but I don't use the K-Cups.  Not sure what the k-cup tea would be like.
MatPat is right, tea is WITHOUT milk :) Great video, only you can do so much dumb science and get away with it by saying it's a business 👌 !
bruh tea in portugal is wather on a mug microwave for about 8 min let it chill with the tea packet/plants inside  (theres one wich is 3 pieces of lemon peel and honey in the water and its pretty good)
Here's a method you didn't cover. I use a French press for my loose-leaf tea. It's normally a device used for making coffee, but I find it pretty useful (just... don't use it for both coffee and tea, my French press is dedicated to tea use only). Unlike the other tea-bag methods, it lets the leaves float around in the press and steep from all angles, and as long as you're not overfilling it pressing it won't squeeze the leaves unnecessarily. Not only is this useful for normal "boiling water plus leaves" tea, I also use it for cold-brewed tea, which I've sometimes started the night before and re-heated next morning. It's a very different flavor as most of the bitter tannins don't leach into it (they dissolve at the higher temperatures), even from a lower-grade orange pekoe.  But sometimes of course I don't want to wait and just chuck a tea bag into the kettle-boiled water in the ol' pot. Sometimes simple is all you need.
Cereal first or milk first?
I love the episode.  But my question is, did they heat up the cups and pot beforehand?  Did they use a cozy to keep the pot warm?  I drink mostly green tea, so my temperatures are lower so I can use different techniques to lower my tea's temperature while brewing, but with british more so English Breakfast, it is recommended you heat up the cup AND pot, so the heat loss from the transfer of the hot water isn't lost.  Losing that heat will result in not as fully opened tea leaves.  Usually hot water into a cold cup will result in a dramtic change in temperature 5-8C which is considered outside the range for tea.  Temperatures are important in tea!
NO MILK IS BEST MILK BOW DOWN TO YOUR LESS CALORIC OVERLORDS!!!!!!!!!!! (drink what you want i could care less as long as its not mine lol)
I haven't watched the video yet but as an american southerner sweet tea is the correct answer.  Get a pot of water 2/3 of the way full. Boil. Let steep. Pour in pitcher with 2 cups of sugar. Squeeze out tea bags. Fill the rest of the gallon with water. Enjoy. Also best served with ice. 😁
The TikTok tea caused me actually physical pain as a British person.
I'm more of an american sweet tea type of guy, milk in tea has never been good to me
You forgot one variable: The method of accquisition. Did you buy it at a store, grow it yourself, or turn an entire empire into a drug cartel to trade for it?
There shoulda been a chinese guy because tea did start in china
You should have followed George Orwells perfect cup of tea recipe
As someone from Assam, really appreciate tht we are atleast mentioned... Here two of the most preferred tea leaves for milk tea are CTC and Orthodox... Thank me later...✌🏻😁
This is exactly how I - a British person - have been making my tear for years. *Insert vindication gif here.*
For me as being Irish. Tea is a natural part of my life. All ya do is boil the kettle. Put hot water in till there's like a fingernail between the tea and edge of rim of the cup of tea and add a small dribble of milk. Also I drink it with the tea bag in the cup and tea bag goes in before the hot water
..I just drank tea today after a long time   this is why we can't have nice things
As much as I hate to disagree with the brits, we make our tea the same way in Ireland.
"warm leaf water" gives "hot leaf juice" vibes and I just wanted to let you know Uncle Iroh is very disappointed in you for calling it that.
... but why not microwave the water tho?
They never proved its better to not put it in the microwave to heat up the water, just that too much milk ruins the drink.
he's British how can he have straight TEAth
I would love if you could do a video similar to this with hot chocolate please.
Glad to know I've been making my tea the correct way this whole time
other things to test which the did not do here is best water boiling method (percolator, microwave, kettle, pot, etc.), sweeteners (sugar, artificial, honey, etc.), and water temperature (boiling, steeping, and consumption temperatures). Then they can test variable combinations to see if a tea of the best individual variables is better than teas with a mix of variables. They may spend all of the next day in the bathroom afterward.
OR you can buy Tea I drink sweet tea
I think milk first would men adding tea to Milk instead of tea with milk
IM BRITISH AND THAT TEA TIK TOK VIDEO IS JUST WRONG I HATE THAT PERSON SO MUCH 😭😭😭😭😭
That's so weird, the British guy has the same last name as me
It makes sense that putting the milk in second would taste better.  Pouring the boiling water into the milk would probably disperse it and cause the milk to "cook" faster.
The answer is obviously milk, 1 sugar, 1 English Breakfast teabag and 1 Lapsang Souchong teabag.
Watching this with a mug of tea :)
Try some ceylon tea next time ✌️
Your entire selection between bags and loose leaf is completely invalidated because the quality of Assam in each is different. The quality also affects steep time and temperature. Bags typically contain more offal like twigs and ground dust whereas pyramid bags typically have better quality and loose leaf can be ordered at many different levels of quality such as whole leaf and the quality of that while leaf by growing season or farm. Point is the very first premise here that everything else is built in is on no way controlled.
As someone who is obsessed with tea I am a little disappointed you didn’t consider steeping temperature as a factor. From personal experience, it has a huge effect on the flavor.
3:57 Éire is not Britain also would you like a new car
Loved Stephs pitch meeting refrence 😂 9:00
Just wait 'til y'all replace regular milk with condensed milk.
As a tea drinker I loved this EP. If they revisit this I would love for them to try some other brew types and vessels.
milk, DOESNT go in a GOOD cup of tea, AT ALL. milk goes in coffee, not tea.
I'm English. No one does does milk first you Muppet.
NOONE IN THE UK PUTS MILK IN FIRST
If you use the one cup for so long it may release aroma and flavor
You shoud try to sweeten it with honey
Zach from the try guys has great tea
No one puts the milk in first
I LOVE warm leaf water!
The worst thing is not the microwave, instead that the cold milk was added before the tea is actually brewed. I mean with this amount of milk the liquid has body temperature. How could any flauer come from the tea at body temperature?
They did not try warming the milk to 50C first?
Me (german) thought britsh tea was peppermint tea + milk I guess I can’t be more wrong about that  But I liked it 😅
I dont put milk in my tea lol
As a Chinese person, I don't care lol. I enjoy all kinds of tea (unless it has too much sugar, then it's just an abomination)
Did you just call tea warm leaf water? Uncle Iroh would be VERY disappointed
Cool
Steph: drinks 3-4 cups of tea  Me a British person: is this an American joke I'm to British to understand
Why do I feel as though now Matpat is passive aggressively going after brits after this video.
wait so… you genuinely think that we put milk first?????
This vid: *adds milk to their tea*  Me, an average Filipino/Asian guy: You add milk to your tea?
3 shall be the number of the steeping and the number of the steeping shall be 3.  Also... which type of milk is best?
i dont think i have ever microwaved water for tea we use to make suntea alot when i lived in Nevada and outside was an oven
Ah yes the infamous video. I saw that outrage on r/tea on Reddit. I swear it’s been reposed on there at least 10 times this year.
Milk always after
2:55 She has horrendous taste in improperly Prepared Tea.
You didn't show how the tea infuser was packed. I have a feeling you overfilled it. You're only supposed to fill one half of a tea infuser and even then, no more than 2/3rds full, so that the loose leaf has room to move.  I've also a feeling that the position of the milk exposed different levels of heat to it, denaturing the proteins in the milk more or less quickly, which altered the flavor.
Make a scientifically perfect cup of coffee(like how Gale did from Breaking Bad)
There is scientific proof that red mugs make tea taste better, somehow they missed this but they got a lot of details. Also, never seen anyone put milk before the tea. And I'm British
I definitely prefer tea without milk
Nobody in the UK puts milk in first ....
This is basically that one fairy tale in which a girl intrudes some bears homes and they keep choosing the exact middle option to deal with her.
When they forget there is different types of milk, and that some people have sugar too  Good video overall though
I love how many dated memes are in this video, MatPat is truly a Dad.
As asia who drink tea every day she is fcked up holy smoke its killing me from inside
Also on the thought of updating traditions, vegans love tea too. Would be nice to explore vegan milks and see which is best in tea.
Meanwhile the Asians be judging as they sip their og brew 🤣🤨
I can’t go one day with out tea. 🇬🇧 even my rabbit drank tea! We had to switch to decaf 😒
trying to discover tea ceremony practices through science instead of tradition
nowadays the British Cup of tea is: get a mug  put in the teabag (optional) add a teaspoon of sugar  pour on hot water and keep the teabag in if you wish add milk   stir and enjoy
Dear Matt Pat Coca-Cola made a dream flavor what do dreams taste like
AVOCADO is DEADLY for CATS!!! even it its only the water, where the avocado is in it
The norm for modern British cups of tea IS tea in 1st…? Doc Brown literally did a rap about it, Colin Furze has to consistently defend his reasoning for putting milk in 1st because it’s not the norm… Your Theory lacks data!
In Britain the tea goes in first -_- as a British person this is how we've done it
Personally I like a blob of honey in my perfect cuppa - perhaps sweetners could be tested next?!
I make tea in my microwave
Optimizers making warm leaf water
There should be NO milk in tea. If you truly love tea, why would you dilute it?
I didn't know people put milk in tea is that a real thing?
I go though at least 20 cups of tea per day
A food theory tea set….   Id buy that for sure!
The glass mug was also the hottest because you poured it last.

As a Dutch person (and regular tea drinker), I never knew people poured milk into tea... And I'm never gonna try it out
BANNEEE
I’m skeptical to how you could possibly improve my tea experience. I time my steeping time to perfection.
Me who is British: *spits out tea* btw, Steph, 3-4 cups a day? I drink twice as much as that! 😂 ☕️
3 or 4? Those are rookie numbers
*side eyes in East Asian*
You missed an opportunity. Queen Tealeafa
That is very bri'ish of you
People add milk to tea? I just add a teabag to hotwater and a spoon of augar
I don’t use milk
Ive been drinking tea for 30 +years and milk is always last in ... My parents always did... My grandparents always did . Whoever puts milk in 1st needs knocking sense into them.
Milk in tea is not my cup of tea, if you will. You know what is though? HONEY in tea. It's simply the best.
Meanwhile, me, ethnically Chinese: "What is this milk in tea business...Y'all crazy."
As a Brit milk should always be on the top
As a canadian im watching this snowfall and whispering out my window "the british are coming"....for mattpatt cause he did the thing.
No, YOUR tea is wrong
Lol, I like how even though they explained that the UK used to pour milk first to not break their cup and not because it tasted better, they keep bashing UK for pouring milk first and saying it doesn't taste as good.
The tiktok tea gave me such stress. Cause that was so much money worth of milk 😂
Tiktok recipes tend to be the worst foods I've tried
did mat just reference Bane at 1:49 lmao
You have a cat???
Why not microwave the water? I don't get it, because I mean hot water is hot water.
Do NOT boil your water. Heat it to 90 C (195 F). Boiling flattens the flavor.
Where's the Spiffing Brit? I want his opinion on this 🧐
bullshit i shouldn't squeeze the bag i want it strong and bitter
I'm British this is how I do it: Teabag Hot water 1 or half a teaspoon of sugar Let it brew for a couple of mins  Add a splash or 2 of milk  Stir  Drink You are welcome  Extra tips: If you want the end of the mug sweeter than the start dont stir Add more sugar for extra sweetness  Add a second teabag for much stronger tea You are welcome
Should have got someone from the north cause we could have told you the solution right away, it's how we do it here
Ah, but MatPat, you failed to account for one Very important variable; Convenience! It doesn't matter what way makes the best tasting cup of tea. The largest quantity of tea that people drink will never be the top-shelf variety. The people who drink the most tea are those who chug it from a 52 ounce Big Gulp. What kind of tea is it that they drink? Southern Style sweet tea, served cold with plenty of sugar, and most often made with instant tea powder. Make whatever claims you want, but when it comes to what tea people actually drink the most of, convenience will beat out flavor every time. That's why the number of cups of coffee McDonalds sells in a day absolutely dwarfs what Starbucks sells a day.
"Don't burn your hand off..."  I mean, you could just not have shitty mugs? :P My mug can go in the microwave and the handle isn't hot, unless it was *wet* when I put it in the microwave.
Doesn't she mean she's "Royal-Tea?"
what about the actual quality of the leaves ?
Telling a Brit they're making tea wrong sparks debate, and this is gonna be a fun one. When I found out Americans MICROWAVE tea, I did not have a good time
Matpat, I am ashamed of you. Warm leaf water? You could have at least went with an AtLA reference and called it hot leaf juice.
I expected it to taste bitter when tea was added on top of milk, and to have a mixed flavor when milk was added on top of tea, both were added at the same time, or milk was added first but then stirred after the tea was added. Considering that's exactly what happened, I feel like they just didn't stir it after they poured the milk first, so the lighter, more watery (less viscous, I suppose?) tea wasn't able to break evenly into (and thus "auto-mix") the milk it was being poured into, whereas the heavier and thicker milk was able to shove the tea out of the way and auto-stir itself in the process.  TL;DR: I don't think they stirred their tea, and thus pouring milk on top tasted better, because it was auto-stirred when pouring. Pouring tea on milk will just make the top bitter and the bottom sweet if you don't mix it.
Being from the uk obviously you know  tea. That is part of your curriculum
11:11 The UK Loves their tea so much that they made a whole academy
This would have been a great chance to cross promote with @thespiffingbrit as he knows how to drink perfectly balanced tea.
The fact i almost poured water into my cereal while listening to this is reason enough why i watch these videos….now i wonder what cereal with water tastes like
I enjoyed this episode as a British person! The scientific way really is the best way to drink tea!! The ONLY time you should put milk in first is if you brew it via a teapot! That way you're not burning the milk as you're pouring the hot water in. The tea is already at an optimum temperature and it blends well with the milk that way.
Anime you made a team
your ruining my tea... THE TEAAAAAAAA!!!!!
I don't understand why they say that heating water in the microwave is worse than a kettle. Did I miss something? Theorists, what's the reasoning? Isn't hot water hot water no matter how it was heated?
I got here in the first hour
earl grey tea is the best
also as a brittsh man i would say try diffrent tradional teas. we got india an pakistan chai ... as a person who done experiments profesionaly at collage, i would reccomend expanding your research over tea leaves so you understand how method of peperation matters and flvours the tea leaves absorbed.
I don't think the British are the end all be all of tea. I'd rather get tips from someone from China or India tbh.
Is chai tea acceptable to british people  🤔
Alright follow up Theory   Import English breakfast and decide the best tasting   Ones you should include: Lipton (it’s bad but it is the American tea so it’s required) PG tips, tettle, Yorkshire tea, and since it’s my go to thompsan’s punjana (it’s a local company so I don’t think it’s all too well known outside of Northern Ireland
Those pyramidal bags are made from petroleum products, though.  That's just more plastics. Reusable cloth bags _also_ allow movement. And loose tea leaves are very economical with far less packaging. I hope people will consider this.
Matpat failed the most important part of science.  He didn't create the perfect cup of tea, he crafted at best the perfect of THAT brand and type of tea. A different brand and type of leaf will taste different depending on how these variables interact with those leaves!
I prefer hot apple cider
I'm disappointed by the lack of Uncle Iroh
Hi
My grandmother always told me you need to heat the tea pot with boiling water and replace with new boiling water before you brew the tea.
As a British person, I can say that we stopped putting the milk  in first generations ago. I'd say it's more of a stereotype loosly based in fact as most Americans don't even know why we did it.
One variable you left out was wether or not steamed milk, cold milk, or warm milk make a difference.
who adds milk to tea?!?
17:22 Missed opportunity. Not only have we thrown off centuries of British tea-ranny
I've been drinking tea (Earl Grey; hot) for almost 30 years and I've never put milk in it. I've never seen or heard of anyone putting milk in their tea before today. Captain Picard never ordered milk in his tea. Even in the (admittedly few) British TV shows I watch nobody has ever been seen putting milk in their tea. So, I learned something today.
I drink a hole kettel of tea a day
I re-use my coffee mug all the time. Maybe wash it once a week and rinse it in between.
Theory idea: why do I have corn in my s*** but ate no corn in the past week
Part 2: What's the best kind of fruit to add to the tea. :)
13:40 I totally agree with Matt here who wants to add something that's flavorless it's milk to something that as tastiest tea?
as a British man ive been doing it the correct way the whole time except id recommend a smaller amount of milk on top, Around 16mL is where i found it best but milk should ALWAYS be last for taste :D
I'm Brit and I've never put milk in first in all my time drinking tea which is all my life  I've always used the rule  Milk in first for coffee  Milk in last for Tea  As for how much milk.... Definitely a splash.  Definitely in ceramic mug  Steep.... All depends on your how much time you have.... I usually make the tea first... Let it steep... Go do something else then go back to it.  Tea is the best.  I prefer 'Yorkshire Gold' 😎😁
"Needs sugar"....coffee creamer instead of milk. you still the creaminess of milk but the added sugar to those who like it sweeter. People look at me weird when they see creamer in the fridge but see no coffee anywhere lol
13:37 100% agreed
No one in Britain puts the milk in first, that's just weird.
Milk first was a southern tradition used by the lower class as people couldn't afford the correct cups, but higher class and those in northern England (usually because they made the cups) had the right cups and could put milk in last. That is why a traditional tea set has a small jug for the milk so you can ad how much you like after the water has gone in, usally just after or while steeping.
an american telling the english their tea is wrong. what a  git
Should do iced tea vis sweet tea next!
14:02 “26 mL, this is what I expect from milk tea” me filling almost half the mug with milk:  👀 😥 🙈
The title… y u rude tu me
MASTER OOGGWAY
no way people pour milk in tea
Title “YOUR TEA SUCKS” Me: aggressively sips kettle made with a triangle tea bag tea that was steeped for 3 minutes with around 26ml of milk that went in after the tea. “RUDE!”
Judging the order of milk pouring isn't finished until you have finished the cup. Pouring the milk last will make it taste sweeter at first. But will it continually remain so? And how does the milk last over a period  of twenty minutes of tea time?
also the reason the glass cup was so hot was because you used it to pour into the other 2 unless you accounted for that
Wait, why not boil in the microwave?  Boiled is boiled. The water molecules don't behave differently by method of boiling.
0:56  I think you mean “hot leaf juice”. Am I right, Avatar fans?
I don't know if I'm crazy but were they using the same cups?
Well that explains it all.... milk? Sugar? In tea? Hahaha shut up ... there's something wrong with yall
Matpat you forgot how to stir your tea when you add the suger, clock or counter clock wise, or when you add the suger in the first place. But don't worry I did my homework. You add the suger last and stir forward and backwards or up and down, you are welcome in advance.
osmosis tea taste the same as i remeber but where are those who shared the memory-british zhongli
If somebody is going to drink a cup of tea every time that Matt patt is gona make a terreble pun im gona Give you  10$
They didn't actually prove that kettle is better than microwave and I find that may be a massive difference in flavor.
'Warm leaf water" 🤣 along with all the other puns, I'm dead. I'm also currently drinking tea.
next time to "pour the right amount" -- just use kitchen scales.  overall this is a weak episode. you could try different sugar amounts, sugar first vs later, different leaf sizes, imported vs local, making large amount of tea, try different tea cultures (with same cast, preferably) part two, maybe?
Matpat: mentions small green leaves  My brain for some reason: WEED
Sugar?
The spiffing Brit needs to see this.
ok, 26 mil of milck.... in 1 liter of whater??.... in 100 mil of whater??
Man I can't wait to watch the 3rd instalment of how to eat a Christmas tree after christmas
3-4 is rookie numbers
Sorry to say (UK resident) but I literally don't know any tea drinkers that pours milk first as we all know how it affects the brewing process. The only experiment that did surprise me is in the mug vs pot comparison. I notice a *huge* difference in flavour when using a teapot so I would have expected the difference to be quite obvious.  One thing I would like to ask though. Have you considered trying the experiment using Earl Grey? good quality blends are a lot more fickle on how you brew them to get that aromatic flavour so it makes me wonder if all your research still stands.
That a lot of tea pun's
Milk doesnt belong in tea
No milk for the win.
The british way is not the best way. Neither is the American. Chinese tea is the best no contest
as an asian person, i totally forgot that brits add milk in their tea. you can imagine how much i cringed when that tiktok showed them pouring in 50% milk to steep the tea leaves in
MatPat is correct Milk doesn’t belong in tea
the only thing that annoys me is you didint test boiling the water in the microwave vs boiling it in some other container since it should absolutely not matter which you choose, water is water whether its molecules are adjudicated by microwaves or convection.
We Turkish people probably have the best tea out there and we are the no.1 in the tea consumption in the world. Brits have no right to claim tea maybe asians but definetly not brits
bro chill with the *tea* joke combo 💀
no milk on my tea
how does the method of heating affect the flavor?
I like my chai tea
I hope that none of you have mono...
I still think Rooibos tea from my homeland South Africa is best. Tastes great with milk, without milk, not sweet, sweetened with honey, sugar, sweetener. It’s always great.
Any Spiffing Brit sightings yet? I'm sure he'll recommend using Yorkshire Gold tea. I'll be honest, I splurged a bit once and bought a box of it. Best tea I've ever had.
Matpat really wants to go to England
Now make a video with green tea 😏
I know this is irrelevant but my hair is looking noice right now.
lacks yorksher gold
That woman is not a representation of Americans making tea
You forgot the milk steaming option
I think you didn't give microwaving your water an objective chance, you mixed all that crap in there. Why does it matter if you just microwave your water? What happens if you heat water in another vessel and then pour it into a separate tea cup? There really shouldn't be any difference.
I used to put milk in after but then I tried milk first and found a better difference but there must have been a few factors that made it so. Either way as much as I appreciate what this video concluded I'm still gonna make tea my way. Great watch nonetheless.  For the curious, my perfect cup of tea goes like this: Honey first, just enough to coat the bottom of the cup.  Milk next, straight from the fridge, about 1/5th the cup amount. Then the typical basic teabag, ideally I like to wedge it in the cup so it's suspended over the milk. Lastly I add the hot water, from a freshly boiled kettle, directly onto the teabag to drop it into the milk. Once filled I double dip the teabag before using a teaspoon to poke it and help the tea leaves disperse around the bag better. 3-5 minutes later (I like my tea strong enough like but yeah the whole 3 minutes thing definitely holds up) I scoop out the teabag and finally I give it all a good stir, as if I'm starting a little whirlpool at the bottom which I slowly work it upwards.   I'd legitimately be really curious if Steph and/or Tom try it and what their thoughts were.  ...*sigh* I really want a cup of tea now
Big flaws here, Matty-boy.  1. What tea are you using to test? If it's not high quality, there's going to be a mix of off-cuttings and dust in the product, and that will make your results inconsistent between different tests. They also could be sitting on a shelf for a year before you use them, and different seasons yield different qualities.  2. By limiting your analysis to the differences between American & British tea, you're only comparing arguably the two worst methods in the world. They both use a lot of water and very few leaves steeped for a relatively long time (a minute plus instead of 20-30 seconds). Usually the leaves are of lower quality for western brewing because you're not really going to get much flavor except bitterness from them that way.
No milk tho
The funniest part about this is that matpat is actually right. You shouldn't put milk in your tea because milk blocks all the healthy benefits you get from drinking tea. So, while it may taste better with milk, scientifically, it's better without.
26 ml is roughly 1&1/2 tbsp  For anyone who was wondering
When I lived in Germany my roommate introduced me to spearmint tea with honey. That's my go-to tea now.  And my optimum vessel is an MST3K mug that says "Chocolate Jones and the Temple of Funk."
As a brit, those who put milk first are wrong but I don't like tea so I don't know how different it tastes
Tom looks like British Muselk
"Warm leaf water" Yummy!
British tea is the worst version of tea, they can't season their food, why do you think they can make tea?
Most people rejected his message. "The best milk in tea is no Milk". They hated MatPat because he spoke the truth.
for your information, i have seen many British people do milk second so you lose also let's be honest if America did it would be so inaccurate as to what is great
What about a pyramid bag IN a teapot?
Oh heck naw they decapitated cup head 😭😭😭
'breaking down how to make the best cup of tea scientifically.  First, best shape for the tea bag".  Well that's your first problem, using a tea bag is like trying to make the best cup of coffee, then breaking out the Maxwell House instant crystals.  You need whole leaf tea.  Also thanks Mat for saying no milk in tea
why would you ever put milk into tea
You guys put milk in tea!?! I’m in Britain and I have never done that
You are wrong in every way, squeezing the tea helps loads, you should ALWAYS add milk last and  you should stick to ruining American lives, not British ones.
3-4 cups of tea is also how much I drink.
but is teapot tea traditionally made only one mug's worth at a time?
As a brit I am annoyed that you say we put the milk In first no one has every made tea that way anymore
Can you do a video about herbal tea?
We alreay know Food Theory doesn't need to find "the best cup of coffee" since Buddy already discover that in Elf. "Congratulations, everyone! You did it! 'World's Best Cup of Coffee'!"
I love these videos with Steph and other theorists. Everyone is so charming and fun to watch!
Goldilocks would be proud!
Ive never heard of any brits pouring milk first
Question. Why wasn’t type of milk also a variable?
Is I've been making my teas perfect?!. Even though I'm British I didn't know that it was tradition to put milk on the bottom, to me that seemed weird. I've always like to see the colour of my tea and that's how I know that there's enough milk in the tea.
I still don't like dirty leaf water.
NO MILK IN TEA!  (outside of iced tea... but hot NO!!!)
I feel called out by the microwave bit 😅 my stoves broke and I HAVE to heat my water in the microwave when I want tea 🍵
That is what I do I just add a teaspoon of sugar
4 the tea pot it should be 1 scoop/bag for the cup and one for the pot so if your making one cup in a pot 2 bags are needed
You neglected one of the most important variables… temperature, which varies with the type of tea as well.
“We need someone born and raised on tea. We need someone-“ Me: Chinese! “British!”
MatPat: Ladies and gentlemen it's that time of year; the weather is getting colder- Us in the Southern Hemisphere: Not on my propertea. (I'll come up with a better pun soon. Give me a minute.)  PS: As a South African I have to say: Rooibos tea is *SO* nice and you obviously have rooibos tea merged with chamomile and stuff so if you have the opportunity to try it please do. Honey goes really well with it if you're one of those and Red Cappuccino is (not a real cappuccino it has no coffee in it) a cappuccino-like drink made with rooibos.
TikTok tea makes sense, it wouldn't be the first time Americans ruined a bunch of British tea. In fact it's kinda a national past time, starting in Boston.
0:40 Relatable, I use the same cup for pretty much everything.
“3-4 cups a day” not enough.
Okay who in Britain puts the Milk first? As a Brit (okay as a British Indian I makes tea the old fashion Indian way, but still British.) I have never met a single person who put the milk in first, you always add milk after. So if this is a tradition, it's a tradition that's went out of fashion decades ago.
We do put our milk in last, only out-of-date posh sods do milk first as they use a tea pot for every drink, and that's only because their butler makes it for them.
hahahahahaha  prepare for the biggest storm of negative comments you have EVER seen. every tea drinker is convinced their way is the BEST and ONLY way and anyone who disagrees is a filthy animal and they'll fight to defend their view
Getting only a brit for your tea episode.... Oh China, Japan, and India are not gonna be happy
I'm from the south and I put the milk in after the steeping process but my best mate is from the north and she puts the milk in first. That's the argument we can continue to debate and no matter what matpat has to say it won't end there lol
Fun fact: the Irish drink more tea (and less beer) than the British.
Can we get a tea bobble triangle shaped?
I can safely say that as a British person, neither have I or anyone I've known ever in my life put milk on the bottom we all agree that milk on top is better
There is literally an ISO standard for making a cup of tea. I wonder if they cover this?
The milk in the cup first only applies when you have already brewed your tea in a pot, if your brewing the tea in a cup you put the milk in last unless your an animal. So no throwing off British tradition. Though I mostly just drink earl grey so I don’t add milk anyway 😂
Mat pat is suth a kild som time its so cute
Don't let The Spiffing Brit hear about this video.
Ah, come on Matpat, you can't diss microwaving your water without full on testing.  Also, if Stef wants 3 to 4 cups of tea at once, you should get a 32 ounce cup.
If you really want your mind blown, try tea with cream. It is soooo good. I know that there is the whole myth that cream curdles faster in tea compared to how much time milk takes to curdle in tea. But as far as I have heard, the difference is insignificant. But what do I know, I steep my tea for 10 min, and I need either some milk and sugar or cream and sugar in my tea.
Water in kettle, teabag in mug. Add boiling water to mug, then remove teabag after brewing, add sugar and stir if wanted, then add milk. Simple. None of that 'milk on the bottom' nonsense. Cannot explain just how much this video annoyed me. Still loved it.
I’m with you Matt, no milk in tea is the best amount 😂
As the God of barista i am shocked that they were seriously suprised about quality difference in the tea "bags"  i always though tit was common knowledge that tea bags generally use lower quality parts of the tea and are due to that reason cheaper and lack in flavor  especially the flat ones.  the pyramid ones don't suprise me that they won tbh.   lose leaves are better for personalizing your tea in all regards so it's more suitable for refining it.
beginning log: There hiding something I just don't Know what I feel like something watching me but I don't know who WHO AM I?
3-4 cups of tea? That’s child’s play. The national standard is like 8 in Britain
Stephanie looks like she's got some juice tea bags 😏
Since I'm going to the UK for school in January AND I love tea myself, this video is so helpful!
Milk in Tea is gross...
What, they didn't test one of those plastic reusable gas station coffee mugs?! MatPat I don't know about this.
Except all of this is invalid because everyone knows you have to put the tea bag in first, then pour the hot water over it, not dunking it like a limp Oreo
You missed a perfectly good opportunity to go: “when life gives you lemons; YOU BURN PEOPLE’S HOUSES DOWN!” Lol, perfect gaming reference while also being a good theory channel.  That said, maybe you should see what it would take to get a lemon to burn down a building, while also having a game theory video on the Portal games.
This is one of the ways I ingest my green leaves..
wheres twitgamer when you need him, he is the master of all thing tea
20:35 So are we not going to talk about Skip or...
The end of the Tea puns will be quite the re-leaf.     I'll see myself out
Mmmm tea
We pretty much do milk last in our English household anyway, but nice to have that validation. I'm curious about alternative milks on a scientific perspective as to which is the best in tea? (You know, combine two previous Food Theory episodes!) I'll 100% always drink with cow milk, but my partner uses oat milk. Would be good to see which of the alternative milks with the same three tasters is the best and if it overcomes cow milk, goat milk, etc. Spoilers: goat milk in tea just tastes of goat.
Did they made a Theory about warming up the water in the Microwave VS Eletric Kettle VS Old-Time(Iron/Copper) Kettle? I think is a strong enough veriable for the Tea, No?
Somewhat unrelated but once a friend of mine made a prank call to someone i know in a British accent and they immediately responded "why are you British?"
Okay, now my question: why does tea always taste like just hot water, or hot water with milk, or hot water with milk and sugar?  Everyone around me can taste it fine, so it's not in the preparation. I can smell it. I can taste stuff in general. But my entire life I've never been able to taste tea, even trying loose leaf, double bagged, triple bagged, more steeping, different varieties. Never.  On a more scientific and less personal note, I would have to find it again, but I remember hearing somewhere (Fact Fiend?) that scientists have actually done full tests on if milk should go in first or tea should go in first, and scientifically, chemically, there should be absolutely no difference, but in taste test studies, majority of participants could taste the difference, got it right with surprising accuracy during blind tests, and most preferred milk first. Which is weird.
I am British and I know no one who puts milk in first, that seems very weird to do
Does the kind of milk matter, or the place of the waters origin. Because I remember in a previous video when New York’s pizza was the best because of the water.
If you want real tea you need gong fu cha
As a Brit, I’ve always been told milk last, as back in the day the upper classes would use sugar cubes, and adding milk first wouldn’t be hot enough to dissolve the sugar properly.
Eggnog
This was the first time I thought the experiments weren't really good enough. I hoped for a binary search-style experiment to find variables like the perfect temperature.
im turkish, in my opinion, i find milk in tea very disgusting
U do know that no normal person here actually does milk at the bottom, even the poshos with teapots have little milk pouring things so the milk can go on top, u have not overthrown any superiority here 😢😂
love the puns!  DRINKING UP!
You have to rinse the teapot with hot water first, then poor fresh hot water back into the teapot, then steep the tea.
ME AND UNCLE IROH HATE TOU!
I mean technically, you probably should have gotten someone from India/China as the “tea expert” 😅
Experiment 1: Is anyone but me bothered that Matpat is using the 'M' mug but Steph isn't using the 'S' mug? I understand if they don't have an identical 'T' mug on hand for Tom, but at least match up as much as you can.
wait you put milk in you're tea?!?!
Please matpat for the Irish people do a video about mash potato 🥔 for us
Matpat, what about Asian countries and tea.
i always put milk in last after the tea is done brewing putting the tea bag in the cup with milk in it is just weird
I don't know how all y'all do it but down here in the South the only tea we know is sweet tea
You need the heat to steep the tea. If you cool it first with milk the tea doesn’t steep. Milk at the end stops the steeping at the right time.
Bri'ish
Il take my sugared southern style tea over any other tea any day
Pfft, 3-4 cups. I drank at least 4 liters of tea per day during summer (three 1,2L teapots).
As a British person I must genuinely say this is the most interesting video if ever watched
I am British this is how I make tea and everyone I know makes tea like that
Literally just made a green tea to do dishes with before supper
Yall made me want to drink some tea. Now I'm making some vanilla Chai but...my kettle is dirty so I have to microwave the water
Okay but what about sweeteners. Honey or sugar and how much of each
Seeing this video reminds me of an old anime I think was called Rozen Maiden that took tea prep very seriously and made me curious if the things they said about their teas were accurate.
wait.. i’m British… and I don’t make tea any of these ways… (I boil the kettle, put the teabag in the cup, pour in the water, sugar then milk.) Is this odd to any other brits?
I hate milk in my tea, but I like honey in it
I'm pretty sure that Tiktok video was created to enrage people and get attention.
W-wheres the intro... WHERES THE F*£}×±∆ INTRO
As a brit that title already offends me
mat pat is right no milk in tea
You really overlooked the microwave variable. How exactly does the taste get affected by the microwave being what is used to heat the water compared to heating on the stove or in a kettle? Which is the best way to heat your water for tea? I understand heating it in the microwave can heat the whole mug and burn your hand, but if that's the only down side, an oven mitt or rag can help to retrieve the mug, if it has no affect on the taste or steeping of the tea, I don't see a valid reason to hate the idea so much, especially when boiling in a pot is far more dangerous when you try and poor into a mug, and most people cannot afford a kettle, so they just make do with what heating appliances they got.
Go food Theory!
I feel like for a more accurate experience you should've also talked about sweetener ie none, artificial, sugar or honey as lots of us have one or two sugars in our tea. Also atleast here in dorset milk is in afterwards
I feel like it coulda gone even more in depth. What if optimal time is 2:30 but 3:00 is just closer than 1:00 or 5:00? And why NOT have the no milk control? The gaps for each experiment were too wide, in my opinion.
I was concerned about this before I watched... But it turns out the best cup of tea is exactly how I have it, and how I've drank it almost all my life - as well as my close family 🤣. I would note that it's very uncommon for British people to add milk first nowadays, it's almost always last (if it's a good cuppa anyway!) If you go to a tea room you get it in a teapot with a small jug of milk so you can make it to your taste 😊
I am british myself and I am appalled that at the end of the video you claimed brittish tea was wrong when YOU YOURSELF said that it was the traditional way of making tea NOT because it was the best but because it didn't damage the mugs, many a british I have seen put milk on top so one might say we have evolved our way of drinking tea but the traditional way will never change, and some, like me will remain loyal to its tradition.
You are saying all we need to do I put it on top is what we already do, no one puts it in first ffs
Now the real question is: should the milk go in before or after steeping the tea
I’ll have to experiment myself because I usually make hot water in a keurig, I’ll share my results when I found out
Now do this but for Iced Tea
Thank you for improving my tea. I used to make my tea in under a minute,  squeezing the bag to make it stronger, faster. I slowed down and took the time to do it right. Infinitely better. Thank you.
Drinking tea while watching this :)
Matpat you used command f to find all the tea's in the script right?
Then why did you make a video then if it’s not your business?
16:30  There's not a single person I'm aware of that wouldn't look at you in abject horror if you put the milk in first in front of them.
I can safely say for the whole of the UK, no one apart from sociopaths over here puts milk first. And dark teas you can put milk in it, light teas like green tea don't need milk.
Typically things mix better when thick is added to thin rather than thin added to thick, like honey added to milk rather than milk added to honey, or I'm just wrong. Would love to see milk and tea being poured into a cup at an equal rate (the last of the 5ml of milk goes in with the last of the larger amount of tea goes in) to see what that would be like.
Asians(like me) usually just drink tea.   No milk No sugar  Just plain tea.
in my opinion i say you shouldn't put milk in your tea because it sounds gross but i cant be talking because i never tried it but im just saying no milk is good for me also a coincidence that im drinking tea today because im sick and this video comes out
Follow up question, why is microwaved boiled water the worst? Like stove top boil water, kettle boil water, and microwaved water; why are they so different and why is microwaved the absolute worst?
I'm not really a tea drinker but I never knew people added milk to tea.
Hold up. You think the Brits have the monopoly of tea? What about the Japanese? Asia in general, where the stuff orgiginated from?
Brit here. I can so no self respecting tea drinker ever puts milk in first and we look down our noses at those who do
I use honey soooooo
You forgot one step, should the bag go in before or after the water
Steoh anticipated the loose leaf tea making a mess and she was correct xD
2,033RD COMMENT AND CAME AFTER 1 HOUR
Apparently the water temperature when you start steeping is important. It's supposedly a little under 100 celsius. Some mountaineers were supposedly complaining anout bad tea because the boiling point high up in the mountain is lower, meaning the right temperature to steep couldn't be reached
Not me boiling my tea for 20 minutes and wondering why it always come out bitter concentrate! >>;;;
I agree with matpat, tea is better without milk.
Even though my whole life was spent in the UK I HATE milk in tea especially because I can't have milk bc im lactose intolerant D: so milk just is really bad in tea
I only use honey in my tea
3-4 cups? I drink 2 litres of tea a day.
As a Pakistani this video is too hard to watch.
Says he is gonna talk about Classic British Tea, proceeds to talk about Indian Tea. /facepalm Also, there are older tea drinking cultures than the British.
as a brit i love this :D
I like bitter tea, sue me  Upsetting everyone who sees me make tea 🤣
Meanwhile, I hate all tea. Just all of it. There is no good cup of tea to me.
I am a brit and I was caught off guard when the teacup was put into the microwave
Wait but should the sugar go in before or after the hot water is poured?
Food theory idea: if you were to jump off a ten story building, how much marshmallow would it take for you to survive.
As a Brit, I don't think I know anyone who puts milk in first.
Can't believe they never actually compared microwave tea vs kettle tea (without milk or that whole tiktok recipe). This is one of the most well-spread things that Europeans clown on Americans.   Beside's that, it would've been interesting if they included Japanese Royal Milk Tea where they outright carefully brew tea on milk for a long time to not include any watering down.
I love the lip smacking.
Every British person looking at this video watching him make it hoping he does it right
Yall have a nice kitchen
Ok, but have you tried putting tea in a coffee maker? Takes all the effort out of steeping
Did you just call it WARM LEAF WATER Iroh would be ashamed
What about simultaneous milk
Slayed
Being fair the “splash” is just people deciding how much they want to fill up the cup up after putting water in
WARNING:  The level of puns used in this video easily exceed...<insert Vegeta scouter meme>...OVER 9000!!  Viewer discretion is advised.
Other than Matpat burning himself, no one addressed why not microwave water? Is there any taste difference?
what about heating the method?
Definitely going to still boil water in a microwave, tho.
If you want to make a real good tea you should boil the milk with a living side then make it sweeter with honey instead of sugar and puts in it glass it should thin glass or metal glass with cinnamon this how they make it in India and it's really the best way to do it the British way it just trying to do the Chinese way which is actually better than the British way but it's less good than the Indian way the Indian way is the perfect way sorry British
Matt Parker did a video testing the tea-milk order 5 years ago, and the answer is surprisingly… maths. You're gonna love it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCuaWqhVvIc
Lead plates: Allow me to introduce myself
All the microwave is doing is heating the water. Sure the heat transfer method is different than the kettle but nothing in the water has changed.
Theres nothing wrong with microwaving water. It is exactly the same as heating it any other way. SMH
I hate and love how many puns are in this video
Unfortunately this video is biased since British tea isn’t classic, it’s Japanese or Chinese tea
The weird sour note with the milk on bottom probably came from the fact that hot tea was poured on the milk most likely slightly curdling it turning some of the lactose to lactic acid
Samovar
Also the glass one isn't poured into anthor so it might explain it being hot too
I didn’t know people put milk in their tea, where we live we put in one teaspoon of honey instead
I loved the puns in this video
🐨☕️ video matpat
meh lack of combinations to create unique variables. like steeping tea longer might work well with different amounts of milk to get a creamier texture but keeping a balanced flavor.
dandelion coffee is the best
Matpat, only old women put the milk in first. :)
I’m British and I hate tea
okay, but what about sugar  Also, as a brit i dont know anyone that does milk first
Pov: The entire British audience
As a man of Caribbean living the only one True tea is guarapo. Just basically star anise tea and some other medical herbs
Get a cup of water put it in the fridge hit the beverage button take it out put a teabag in it then make tea like that until it turns brown then put it down the caramel Stir It throw away the tea bag and go to your room and Slurp in the middle of the night cuz you're freezing and that's why you make tea
if tea is just warm leaf water then dose that make coffee warm bean water
Best tea is with a full bag of sugar and iced
Yes. Talking about the color and how it looks without showing anything. Nice...
Proper British tea... Not Yorkshire?!?!? Disappointing!
11:41 "You can till that there is a very clear color difference" *NO mat I can't* but thanks anyway
i'm from england, and i literally don't know anyone who puts milk in first
Yall still didn't explain the difference between boiling water on the stove vs in the microwave. obviously you shouldn't put the teabag in the microwave but I don't see how the source of the water's heat could effect the process.
I'm glad to know that I have been making the scientifically best tea every day. ☕️
So, is there some reason why microwaving the water was written off and not even tested?
Ok…as an Indian person, how is this video going to impact my chai enjoying experience.
Who goes to the sauna with their clothes on?? How barbaric!!
The best preparation of tea is iced sun tea. I won't hear anything else.
Woah, woah, woah, you’ve forgotten two major criteria, What about using multiple tea bags, and what about adding extra flavors?
I remember mom taking 12 different boxes of tea, take a couple of tea bags each separate them into two ziplock bags to save for later, case in point she had 12 separate tea flavors all in one, boiled in water, and then saved it in a giant jug to drink a cup a time for later
I'm 'guilty' of using the mircowave to heat water for tea-making but the key difference between this video and my application is I use a glass measuring cup not the mug itself. Run the microwave for 2 minutes and 10 seconds... it's piping hot water ideal if I'm in a rush. Just pour the hot water into the mug, place the tea bag wait another 3 minutes remove the tea-bag and it tastes pretty good. I tend to drink fruit teas so I skip the milk part.
i prefer iced tea
I don't like tea it's very gross (sorry England) but it's interesting to see what all goes into making Tea, I also don't think I've ever heard of milk in tea I thought it was only tea leaves? The Theory channels are always teaching me so many interesting things about topics I'd never once thought about
I have never liked hot tea, but give me a nice cold iced tea any day. Maybe that should be the next episode: making the perfect iced tea. How much sugar? How much lemon? What kind of base tea? Chilled or with actual ice? Etc.
Where’s the Spiffing Brit when you need him?
who would have been perfect for this would have been the spiffing brit. : 3
I added milk to my tea during this video and it did some good. But I'm also part of that group that needs an overwhelming amount of sugar. I really needed the hot tea for my throat, but it was too hot. The milk cooled it down while also making the tea a bit richer and less like flavored water and the new temperature made it so my throat is feeling better but without burning my tongue.
I have only ever put the milk in last, and so is practically everyone I know. I am being deported tomorrow!
As a Brit I do my tea in the way that was the winner so I support british tea is still the best
I'd like to see microwave vs boil interest variables
First with the other thousand
another variable could be when the sugar and teabag should be added
I drink as much tea as steph, and am as excited about this episode!
What did you say about tea☕️
I would love if matpat made a history channel, then he could write visiting nations as business expenses
I like my tea with 2-3 cubes of sugar, no milk or cream,  and steeped for 5 mins.  I always squeeze my teabag.
Tasty leaf soup you got there, Matthew Patrick (sorry if I wrote your name wrong, I work in a Starbucks/j)
0:17 Or if you are one certain spiffing brit...
Yall live in North Carolina like me, gotta say I'm disappointed by the lack of sweet tea representation (I know its November, we drink it all year)
3 billion people think tea worldwide and you're only worried about pissing off Brexitland?
Milk DOES NOT BELONG IN TEA NEITHER DOES SUGAR IT IS LEAF JUICE DELICIOUS GOD BLESSED LEAF JUICE
There’s something lacking in these teas. Honey. It may not be the English way but as somewhat who often had strep as a kid and disliked sore throts honey is a must have in tea now otherwise it doesn’t taste right
The title of this video feels like a personal attack and I'm willing to die on the hill that my sweet tea is amazing. Not too sweet, not to bitter, the perfect balance of sweet and flavorful. Everyone who has tried it has loved it and I will die drinking it.
you forgot one thing do you stir clockwise or counterclockwise
oh not the tea guess I’ll grab my bo’oh wa’er and maybe a biscuit
I have NEVER put milk in my tea. I’m a tea, sugar and a bit of honey kinda gal but now I’m thinking about now adding milk
Mat is right milk doesn’t belong in tea
Who tf puttin milk in tea
The got this science to a tea.
this is exactly how us brits make tea and if a country that puts kettles into battle tanks so that a cup of tea is readily available at all times makes it that way then you are making it right
Who gowing to tlll him most brits do put milk on top And not every one use to put milk at bottom
I'm in North Carolina I will drive up to Raleigh and smack you if you keep making horrible puns
The difference in temperature between the containers is due to the fact that you poured water into the other containers through a glass cup which warmed up in this way
3:08 as a Southern American I have to declare this woman has committed a sin against tea and therefore must be brought in for her war crimes!!!
Fir a single cup you do not use a pot   While the pot is a good way to brew it the simple cup method is more efficient   Simply put a tea bag into an empty mug whike boiling your water in an electric  kettle once it had started boiling pour into the cup on top of the tea bag (for efficiency pour over the leave section) steep and stir to your pallet, remove bag with a tea spoon (wooden sticks are only for take out and even then that’s an annoyance) then pour in your desired amount of milk (personal favourite is an NI semi skimmed)
Calling milk in first “the British way” is strange to me. I’m British, I’ve seen a fair amount of tea. I’ve basically never seen milk before tea. It’s like milk before cereal, it just makes no sense. It’s always brewing the tea first then putting milk on top
I don’t know if I’m late or early about this but Happy Birthday matpat I saw your birthday was in November on your old Kirby video 🎉
Lipton breakfast tea for the WIN! 🏆
Petition to make a episode on Maggi 😌, indian take on ramen noodles
I live in the UK and while I have heard that some people do milk first in the UK everyone that I know puts yea first already.
I would love to see this experiment with cold brew vs. regular brew vs. sun brew. each has it's own unique flavor. I would love to see a contest to see which one everyone thinks taste better.
Hot cocoa or marshmallow soup? Seriously?!
No milk
As a Brit I can tell you it's considered very low class to have milk first. Which makes sense if the whole cheap porcelain thing is true. I've never seen anyone here add milk first.
Uncle Iroh: Look what they need to do to mimic a fraction of our power
Nobody today puts milk in first we all do it milk in last not exactly a huge upset here 😂
15:20 congratulations Mat!, that’s called doing the dishes! Give yourself a pat in the back!
the fact "of" isn't capitalised bothers me
13:35 As a man of Chinese descent. I must agree with Matpat here and say, yes no milk is the correct amount.
*Tea was originally invented in oriental China. #JustSaying .
I'm amazed you skipped the sugar+!!
Post watch, No mention on sugar? Have we forgotten the classic 1 cube or 2 for a classic english tea? And should the sugar be put in the cup before or after the tea? And also, METAL kettles are the best for steeping.
now you've gotta do this experiment but with coffee
Then there’s us southerners that boil the tea in a pot and add more water and a ton of sugar and refrigerate it.  Also you forgot to test which type of milk is the best
Our leaf soup
There's no difference between boiling water in the kettle vs in microwave. As long as your water is the right temp, not too high, not too low, it's identical. Sad you didn't test this... Microwaves are faster and more efficient than kettles
Now Matt will have to talk with the spiffing brit uh?
i like bitter tea. and microwaving water is ok
*ahem* Iced sweet tea
"Best milk is no milk in tea" ☕
that traditions is because of the poor the rich dont really do that
Spiffing Brit is going to have beef with Matpat.
Milk in tea, too British for me.
As a South African you need to rooibos tea (rooibos it's Afrikaans in English it translates to red bush but never call it  that) its a healthing tea
Man, I hope Matpat can try some traditional tea ceremony, Chinese to be particular, that is the can of worms beyond the Fnaf lore.
That's crazy to think about that British tradition where they put milk at the bottom got upended in this experiment so in other words it was way better if you put it at the top. I'll remember this when I make tea again at some point
As someone from the uk I and everyone I know puts milk on last. Cafes give you the milk separately so you can add as much as you want.
How could you do all these tests but not test whether microwaved water actually makes a difference.
Stop those dad/mum jokes!
As an American tea drinker, I am actually invested in this episode.
Remember to drink your tea while eating the national British dish, fish&chips
one day matpat's going to do a theory so strange that it gets him put on an fbi watchlist but that's just a theory
Meanwhile the OG Asian tea drinkers have been drinking tea with full leaf and dump the first brew for thousands of years
I wonder how many british people got mad when they watched this
I don't think that the tea cup material experiment was done correctly as the hottest cup was also the one used to pour water into the others. When the water was first poured into the glass cup the coldness of the cup may have cooled the water which happen again when the water was poured into the first cup from the glass one. For the second one however the glass cup was already warm which wouldn't affect the waters temperature however the cup that the water was poured in was cold which would cool the water slightly but not as much as the first one which was cooled by two cold cups. Now lastly with the glass cup it was already warm when the water was poured which didn't let the water cool.  Considering this we can see why the results were as is.
Using Kermit means you automatically have to be in a @devilartemis video.  Sorry Matpat.
Is the "tea first, milk second is better" pretty much down to cold milk wants to go down, hot tea wants to go up, so pitting them against each other makes them mix better?
Do you mean TeakTok tea?
As a Portuguese person I am astounded to learn that there are people who drink tea with milk
I think most ppl don’t just plop their tea bag into the cup. You jig it up and down to have the leaves moving around in the tea bag and release the flavor quickly as to not let the tannins leach out.
Make the same but for coffee.
Mat theory idea Santa is the 😈 sorry bad at spelling
This should have been made with The Spiffing Brit.
You never actually tested microwaved vs boiled water. For all those Tictoc stuff that they did wrong, heating the water up in the microwave does not really do much of a difference compared to boiling it. Well, other than 3rd degree burns...
Jokes on you, I don't drink tea
This video reminded me that I am out of tea.
I just make some home made herbal tea with warm water a bunch of sugar and steep for 15 minutes
let me stop you here, go and try the Iraqi tea then come and reply to my comment.
One of the big divides when it comes to tea between Ireland and england is that Irish people (like myself) put in more milk than the British and put it in last instead of the first. This video just validated the Irish argument. Another thing most people don't know is that Irish tea mostly comes from east Africa unlike the Indian British tea.
Can confirm that no british person has put the milk in first since a long, long time ago.
I've always splashed milk in after. My view of it (my experience and opinion) pouring hot coffee or tea onto milk scalds it quick and spreads it outward from where you pour and gets hotter. Quick rise in temp for milk is not good for flavor, like putting a glass of milk in the microwave. Pouring the cold milk in after is a stream that flows and cools. Cold milk flowing behind and into the warming milk prevents it from scalding while the overall temp of the drink lowers and stabilizes. It works reverse when the goal is to cool a drink with ice. Ice first, drink has heat pulled away by the ice as it makes contact with it.
Disappointed he didn't address the microwave. Why is microwave water different then kettle water so long as the tea is added after?
I put milk first so I don’t accidentally overfill my mug but otherwise, yes to everything. Pyramid tea bags all the way
them dudes was beefing over tea bro 🤣
I drink so much tea I changed my last name
Say hello to Boston harbor, because you’re tea just got dumped!
0:35 w h a t.
@The Spiffing Brit
You’re right it’s not your business with that title lol
Didn't expect supposed underdog Matpat to casually drop the objectively correct opinion (it's more of a fact but I don't wanna sound rude) that *the best amount of milk in a tea is NO milk.*
As a British person I've never met a single person who puts milk first.
I’ve literally never put milk in my tea unless I’m making Boba 🧋
Steph: 3-4 tea mugs a day Me, a British Person: Pathetic
As a Turkish person this video hurts me that you guys used milk 😭
I'm British. I see tea, I click.
So you basically was pouring the hot water and he's spilling it yeah that's going to be a little bit of an issue in terms of the amount of water but I guess that probably won't make a difference right? I hope not
The British upper classes moved to tea first milk second in the 1800s I think? In the early 1900s "the milk in first sort" became a way to refer someone of lower class :)  Other than that great theory!  (I can't believe my first ever YouTube comment is about tea)
19:25 it seems to me that the temperature of the mugs could be affected by the fact that hot water was poured into the glass mug first and then poured into the others, which is supported by the fact that the glass mug is the warmest.
As Asian it feels weird  seeing milk in tea that ain't bubble tea
Who puts milk first?
The best way to have Brittish tea is to throw it in the Boston Harbor
How do you British people in England feel about putting sweet cream in your tea instead of milk I do that
As a fellow tea drinker, we need more Steph-sponsored episodes
13:36 You had me right there. Best milk is no milk. Tea is an entirely different drink with milk.
from the uk, and honestly never heard of putting  milk in first. but everyone i know has also put the teabag in first, whereas you dunked it? unsure what that would effect.
Im british, you always put tea first then milk, this is programmed into our DNA. I dont like hot drinks (including tea) but i still know how to make a good cuppa
The British stole the tea, just like they stole Indian food.
im british, i frikin HATE tea. coffe is worse.
Annoyed at how annoyed this video made me 😅 also milk goes on after for most Brits ✌️
just boil the water put it in a cup and put a teabag with 2 spoons of sugar
Please do an episode on MRE's  -Which is the healthiest? -Do they have a laxitive pill in them? -How to cook one (unconventionally if you want)?  And some more theory ideas. -Why do we have 2 stomaches when it comes to eating dessert? -What is the best way to prepare hot chocolate so you don't burn yourself and have to wait 20 minutes for it to cool down?
A splash is generally more than 5ml, for a Mug but would be fine for a tea cup which is generally smaller.  i am i a milk first person so i can prep it all while the kettle boils and as it cools the cup sooner so its safer around the kids
Only 3 to 4 tea that nothing
I don't like milk in tea
Now they should make a part 2 with no milk and honey/sugar instead.
Milk in tea really depends on what kind of tea you have some none is best others cream/milk compliments the teas flavor
Giving that Turks drink 3 times as much tea as Brits you should have invited a Karaboga
The tea jokes tho
.... just ask Celeste. She'll tell you how to make tea properly. 🤷🏼‍♂️
The secret lore of fansville
3:48 missed opportuniTEA to say varieTEA
If we're talking tea, shouldn't we include southern sweet tea as well?
11:40 You cant get a hardfast number here... There are too many factors unconsidered that grtly affect things here. Temperature, humidity, and air pressure are all gonna play a large part in steep times but so will just the type of material used for steepin in. An aluminium/thin steel teapot vs a cast iron teapot plays a huge part here.
scratch milk and use cream or heavy cream. way better.
By the way in the UK we put the milk on top instead of the bottom now
*drinks his preferred blends of tea from a mug that was brewed in a brown betty.* I get mine like quite a few Seattlites, from Marketspice or Murchie's. What's IN the looseleaf bag can be just as important. Next batch is Huckleberry flavored and worth it.
Milk doesn't belong in tea if I’m being fr 😑
I relate to steph I can go through 6 mugs of tea on a good day
gotta say this vid made me feel a lot of uncertainTEA about whether or not I was making my tea correctTEA or not
I can think of one variable you didn't test, temperature of the water during steeping.
I was watching this whole thing while drinking coffee
So the tea I don’t drink is wrong? Enlighten me, please/j
did you not talk about steep time to mirror mat on a gtlive
Also, you didn't test the Justice League Alfred theory of do you pour water on the tea (as opposed to pouring the tea into the hot water) so as not to scald the tea leaves and does it make a difference
Tea is so stereotypically correct
I only drink iced tea.
THIS IS MY EPISODE
1.5-2min is ideal. depends on the type of tea for me but 3min is too long
I find that tea is best with no milk and just two tsp of honey. Then again I did use cinnamon tea for my experiment
The British WOULD care more about how they make their tea than how it actually tastes. The Brits just don't wanna admit they did another thing that we made better lmao
As a representative of the uk we will be bringing you some "development"
I feel obligated to say I’ve only ever seen ONE BRIT in my ENTIER LIFE put milk first
Haaa I love Bri'ish people there my favourite. I wish i could as gentlementish as them
You need to take your wife to Fortnum and Mason or the Ritz in London.
What about half and half instead of milk?
trust me, in Britain 99.99% of people put milk in second. its looked down on to put in in first
TEA!
THIS IS MY VIDEO!!!!!!!!! As a British person, this does everything I consider right!!!! I just squeeze my tea bags instead and don't use triangle tea bags
As a British person i agree with everything buuuut NO ONE PUTS MILK ON BOTTOM IDK IF THIS IS A SOUTH THING BUT THAT ISNT THE BRITISH WAY YOUR A PSYCHOPATH IF YOU PUT MILK FIRST
"The British Way is the Right Way." As I hear Klaxons firing loudly in both South and East Asia. And Scotland. And Ireland. And Africa.
I’m British and my favorite cup of tea is a Yorkshire cup of tea and the order I make it is tea bag, sugar, boiled water, stir it, put the tea bag in the bin then put milk in and stir it again
Still what kind of milk is the best?
watched this while drinking hot choco. what about yall?
Nice to see Matpat got a special guest on this episode so that Steph isn't the only one suffering the entire time from her husband's wacky antics.
Next theory idea, HOW TO USE YOUTUBE FOR TAX FRAUD
Try green tea
As an avid tea drinker... this was amusing and interesting.
Can you brew tea in a clothes iron?
I’m British and I have never once in my life seen milk first. It’s always water on tea, followed by milk. You just proved the British way is best.
uhh Ive been steeping my chai tea for quite a bit longer than 4 minutes also milk first is horrifying
I don't even drink tea and the Tiktok tea made me gag. Why would anyone do that madness!
:)
apparently i have good taste in tea.. huh
As a lifelong member of team 'add milk after tea' I'm happy to know I'm on the correct side of this issue... but also I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight unless someone gives me a plausible explanation as to why the order makes a difference ??
WHOOOO! I've been making my tea correct! LET'S GO!
I think I won,  How I do my tea! Scottish blend - pyramid bag Steep for about 3 mins Add about 15 mls milk on top In a mug Small amount of sugar, 1 cube or 1 tsp And obviously kettle not microwave
The map at 3:55 is wrong, the Republic of Ireland got its 26-county Republic in 1939 jussssstttttt before WW2
The spiffing Brit would like to know your location
Am I the only one who has never heard of putting milk in tea
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 no milk in tea you're funny Mat............ Oh wait you're serious.
As a British person I have never put the milk in first
"None of My Business", it always has been.
Why are Brits considered the authority on tea when they first imported tea from China, and then had their supply cultivated in India (by illegally smuggling tea out of China, no less)? Both of those countries (and many others in East and South Asia) have more complicated and diverse tea cultures with a far longer history than the Brits, and they actually grow their own tea.
I can finally prove that the way my mother makes tea is wrong
Am i the only one who doesn't use milk 😅😓
Wait you put milk in tea?
You're saying that you're about to offend British people. But, it's quite a common debate in the UK whether you put milk in first or not. With it almost universally being accepted (at least amongst people with taste buds) that milk should be added last; especially as the cold milk can affect the tea steeping by lowering the temperature. The only person I know who puts the milk in first is my mother, and her teas are always awful!
MatPat's right, the correct amount of milk is no milk.
Nope those tests ain’t done till you drink the tea out of a mason jar
As an Eastern European, I can’t imagine tea without honey and lemon
I was just listening in, not looking at the video and at 1:52 I was like oh so you have a Chinese person on the show? and when Matt said someone from UK I was like nope lost me 😂
As a Brit I want to say that I have never seen anyone ever pour there milk in first it may have been an old tradition but not anymore 😂
Matpat acts like the milk last being better serves to prove that the brits haven't had the most optimal way to prepare their tea the whole time, but as he himself says in the video milk first was only done to protect cheap mugs, not for flavour preference, it was only the poor who did milk first, the wealthy poured their milk last.  While it's interesting to see a genuine difference between milk first and milk last, but that's not a dunk against the UK, considering I don't know a single person who puts their milk in first
20:46 Hello. I am British.  We have a great debate in this country over the order in which to put milk and tea, and there's actually words for it: Miffy - Milk In First or Tiffy - Tea In First.  The overwhelming majority of us do it the correct way, which is Tiffy. Yorkshire Tea (the only reputable tea retailer on the isle) officially endorses this, as well as literally every person I know. Your employee is either from the south or the midlands, so he is from the south. He therefore has strange opinions not shared by a majority of this country.  Please take caution in your future endeavours with him, as he may attempt to take you cheese-rolling, or to a football match where one of the competitant teams has a cannon in thier logo.  (In all seriousness he's a great on-camera presence and extremely funny, this is all in jest. Except for the part about milk definately needing to go in after the tea. That is dead serious.)
Tea bag in the Mug/teapot add the Water leave it to Brew Mash the bag to force the juice out. If in teapot pour into mug and add milk to taste
As an English person, I've never once heard of anyone putting milk in first.
Wait, you add milk to TEA? What are you doing  Edit: thank you matpat for your correct opinion during your meeting.
The way I make tea over in Ireland is 1. Boil water in the kettle  2. Pop your tea bag in the mug then pour the water into said mug 3. Pour whatever amount of milk you want into the mug   I tend to leave the tea bag in, though some people take it out.  Enjoy your tea ☕️✨😁
as an Irish person, milk goes in AFTER the tea, our colonial overlords made it so we couldn’t get tea in Ireland until much later on, by this time the cups being used were suitable to hold boiling water (in England there cups were unsuitable and would crack so they used the milk to cool it down, this was not resolved until later) since we had metal and thick ceramic cups there was no reason to add the milk before, so we put the milk in after  Adding milk before water angers me in the most unique way  *would also like to note that African tea is more common
I'm with Matt, best milk is no milk, just a nice pure Earl Grey for me.
Mat knows the right way to have tea 13:34
I agree with Mat. I don't like my tea having milk. Coffee on the other hand goes well with milk (even better cream).  For tea, tho, I prefer adding a splash of chicken stock
This man must be knighted for his achievement, if only her majesty could try it.
By the way, in Poland tea with milk is called "bavarian"
I have to agree that the perfect amount of milk is none
I swear pouring milk on top is the British way. Me and everyone I know puts milk on top
Out of curiosity how many types of tea were tested overall?  Every tea is different and results may vary as a result. Also Teapots can be put in a tea cosy to maintain temperature.
as a British person, i would never put the milk first! always tea bag, water, milk then sugar
This was a really fun episode. BUT: I have heard that temperature actually changes the flavour a lot. You actually shouldn't put the leaves in boiling water because the boiling creates the bitter flavour (I can't remember why but I think it's because it's a bit burned). So I am surprised you didn't include that as a factor. The temperature at which to put in the tea leaves, best temperature to drink and the best temperature of the milk to be at when pouring it in. (But I don't want milk in my tea either Mat so I care less about that one. Still curious XD)
? Britain only live in tea. U want to know tea? Talk to the people who first discovered and cultivated it.  Few things Asians agree on, Chinese taught us how to tea
Ya’ll didn’t do temperature of the water. XD
Me and my fam been making tea like this for years lmao
Funny, I actually perfer my tea without milk just like you mat
As a scotish person wee do put our milk on top
That first 'attempt' at making tea made me sick in my mouth. Yorkshire tea is clearly the test tea. Tea bag first with water and leave for about 3-5 minutes, splash of milk and one tea spoon of sugar last.
fun fact the Irish drink more tea than the British so should have grabbed the Irish
Where do you get the idea from that we put the milk in first? Only weirdos do that,  every person I know puts milk in last.  Doc Brown says it best....  https://youtu.be/Ei46KnXB3BA  We also have a saying, the perfect cuppa tea should be the colour of He-man.
One question: Is tea considered a broth?
Nice
I don't understand what's wrong with microwaving water
A thing I want to point out is that Chinese people don’t add anything to tea when they drink it, we think it’s kinda weird 😂
ngl I'm kinda of tea master in my family I've always made it look like they've been to heaven with the flavour and here's a tip for steph if she's interested stir the tea around for a little bit before you add the milk. Weirdly that's my trick.
Gasp What about the most asked question for Britan Shaken or stirred
In poland tea isn't drank with milk. Its just tea and sugar
as a brit i have never put the milk in first and no one else in my family does
You antisouthern tea is our main drink of choice
LONG LIVE THE TEAAAAAAAAAAA.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've tasted tea with milk, i think its disgusting
I’m British and my genuine reaction to “3-4 cups a day “ was “only 3 -4 cups PATHETIC
some one get spiffing britt in here i wanna see mattpat and spiff go at it over this xD
*sips tea* we stole it from china hahaha   edit: we do put our milk in last
I didn't even know that so when you squeeze a tea bag into the tea it makes it more bitter. The way my grandmother and I do it, is we wrap it around the spoon and the string squeezes it out so we place the tea bag on the spoon and then wrap it around till it does squeeze but it's not squeezing directly like how you're saying so it never tasted that bitter
idk, I didn't see them test boiling vs microwaving water though to see that there isn't any actual difference in tea quality from that. Then again, I brew 1.5 gallons of tea at a time, sugar it, then leave it in the fridge and drink in over the next couple weeks (:
2:18 look at his face
I think Apple Cider is underrated when it comes to hot drinks in the winter.
Alright as a British person, I am going to teach you how to make tea properly. Put water in kettle, put kettle on pour boiling water into favourite mug, size and shape doesnt matter put in a tetley tea bag and wait about a minute before taking it out (leave it in for an extra few minutes for a stronger tea known as Builder's Brew) add milk and sugar to taste, everyone has their own personal preference Tea
6:29  Stephs love of tea kicks in, saving the mix, but then her inner American kicks in and he TOSSES IT IN TOMS FACE XD
Tbh I'm from England and I didn't even know ppl put milk first
What has more cafienne, tea or coffee?
We always microwaved a bowl with the tea packets in it and then put it into a big container for the the with a lot of ice
Matt: "Your tea sucks!" As an Australian, I will be offended on behalf of any Englishman.
‘That time of the year…’ except in Australia were down here dying of heat exhaustion; tea isn’t an option 😂
Over here at S.A🇿🇦 we are also highly addicted to tea, atleast my family is so my point is Americans can't make tea, like do you guys know what a ketel or ketol is?
I am a Gong Fu... Tea Drinker. Tea is not just hot leaf juice, if you do it right
Tea is also a good beverage when you are going through a cold, I drink maybe 6 to 8 mugs with honey and lemon. Tastes great, sour but not overpowering because the honey is just sweet enough and at the end you get a big sweet finish.
Can you do a episode of which tea is better for your health like herbal tea?
Yeah, this is gonna be the first food theory video that I call bullshit on. I'm from Turkey, we grow and prepare the best tea so....... I'm gonna stick with our ways. No milk, no bags, beautifully brewed tea.
About the type of vessel: in Chinese tea culture, it is common to pour some hot water into your cup and then pour it out - before actually pouring the tea. This is so that the cup doesn't leech the heat of your tea, as the fluctuation of temperature can diminish the flavor.
OI ! 3:56 take ireland out of that graphic of Britain! I will not have this blasphamy!
2 minutes in. Already want to tear my eyes out. The tea puns. Oh dear Lord, the puns.
My rule is that if you can't recognize the tea leaves, its garbage tea. Seriously, fork out a little extra cash for some nice loose leaf (be mindful of the sourcing), and make sure you use nice water, and you'll have a great cup of tea. Also a nice ceramic teapot helps. And I never put anything but maaaybe a little bit of sugar in nice tea. I mean, sure, its a bit snobbish, but goddamn do I enjoy a nice tea.
I feel like the Spiffing Brit would be all over this video...
Oh Matt is totally getting cucked by this guy
Hold on one minute. What kind of milk? Whole milk? Skim milk? 2% or 1%? What about goat milk? Camel milk? This experiment is NOT over! @14:38 This aint Food Theorist approved, we need more tests!
let's do a fun game, count how many "tea" jokes there are
I won't put milk in tea
As a Tennessean, all this is wrong if it’s not a glass of ice cold sweet tea
Ok but are you team Earl Grey or team Camomile? Also surprised you guys didn’t bring in spiff as a tea expert. Guy literally lives on the stuff.
(I am really sorry) Matpat will you "teabag" me
hello
Idk y’all didn’t measure the brewing temperature at all, and that is important and different for all kinds of tea
“Classic” British; tea comes from China
This is actually nice because we brits can now optimise out tea skills to be even better than before.
I like that the best tea essentially is the normal Indian chai 😂. Medium milk on top with tea pot. Next time add some spice and you can reach the next level.
Darn it matpat, you could have asked the Spiffing brit. He is the greatest youtuber when it comes to tea
If We would Still have Dislikes This Would be The most Hated Video In the World
am I the only one that doesn't put milk in tea?
"oh wow there is" just sounded british to me then matts exicitment was funny
You know I would have thought the teapot was hotter because I would imagine there's more heat trapped in there but seems to have been the opposite
I'll definetly pass on the milk.
learned so much as to why I hate tea..... I dont hate tea, I hate the tea my family makes!
I avoid triangular shape tea bags on principle. They're basically made of nylon, which is a kind of plastic. Laboratory tests have found that these types of bags release microplastics when exposed to high temperatures. That's something that I don't want to drink on a daily basis.
My mum has always smashed away around 8 before lunch, I wish I was joking.
I personally don't put anything in my tea because there is no need to....the reason cream and sugar is used for coffee is too make coffee less bitter but with tea you can do that by steeping for a shorter length of time....
I prefer my green tea with just hot water!
Why milk just why milk
milk in last has already been a thing in adverage household just look at doc brown's rap about it?
I'm surprised no one reported that tiktok channel for war crimes.
I’ll say before watching. As a British person. Best way to prepare tea is to steep the tea in a small 1-2 metal kettle. Then to pour it on your cup with some sugar(if you want) in and then a little of your cream of choice.
“3-4 cups of tea a day”   Me: Laughs in British
As a British person it was never tradition to put Milk in first, that solely because of the old cups, as soon as mugs became common place putting milk in first fizzled out
NO MILK TEA IS BEST.  Im with Mat, milk tea just change the tea so much
Im amazed you didn't take into account the type of water, mostly cause of that pizza episode. Probably not much of a difference but hey, ya never know.
I feel this is cultural appropriation. As a Brit I’m very offended. Very. Microwaves are murder.
No Milk in Tea gang rise up
*Looks down at cup of tea, brewed gongfu style in a gaiwan. To each their own, but I'm with Mat on this one, no milk is best milk. cheers!
That's  not a tradition it's just something some people did everyone i know all agree milk last this video nothing interesting you had to grasp at straws to act like you found something new
I re-use my tea mug until my mom gets mad and takes it to wash. She calls it gross. I call it seasoning. Like cast iron. (In reality, I am just lazy) The fact that Steph confiscated the loose leaf holder. >XD 6:31  Edit: Nevermind, my seasoning idea is right! It makes my tea stronger! 18:12 Honey is better. Has a smoother taste that goes really well with tea. 21:00
Why didn't you just ask TheSpiffingBrit?
I only like milk in my Chai.   I didn’t like tea as a kid because there was milk in it.
I'm with you MatPat, milk and tea do not mix 👍
meanwhile, in britain, everyone pouring milk after water yet still being screamed at for putting it before
I was honestly not surprised that pouring the milk or tea first would make a difference. Any bartender will tell you that you pour the lighter drink first, then the heavier one, because it will mix better.   What was happening was that by putting the milk in first, you were pouring the lighter liquid on top, and it wasn't mixing as well, meaning the flavor would be different.   To be fair, this is a team full of nerds, I wouldn't expect any of them to know a bartender's rule of thumb :p  (I love your guy's work, just had to speak the truth)
WHERE IS THE INTRO!?!?
I know he’s experimenting with different video formats, but I really miss the old food theory format
If Steph is queen tea she must be RoyalTEA
3-4 a day? That's rookie numbers
What is the taste difference between microwave, kettle or on the cookingplates (sorry forgot what they are called in english)
I agree with mat on the whole est milk tea is the one without milk
is it bad that I am British but make my tea just how MatPat just did? 😭
3:53 Stop callin coloniser tea the "classic" tea >.> Its literally not and it shows your eurocentrist biases that you dont even notice.  ETA: Tea Academies exist the world over and its hilarious a Brit in my comments thinks they are a Brit thing only xD
STOP TEA MILKERS!!!  In the name of Matpat
3 or 4 cups ?    I have 1 Liter before 14:00
I think there should have been a test for the microwave that more accuratley controlled for variables, as the tiktok and british teas were different in more ways than just heating.
*****SPIFFING INTENSIFIES*****
This is my FAVORITE kind of food theory. I will absolutely make tea this way next time.
did matpat just forshadow dishwasher optimization at 0:40
Goats milk is my favorite for tea or no milk
Most of us brits put milk on top that's what we know never milk on bottom
MatPat About Steph: "No exagerration, she's going through like 3 - 4 cups a day"  Me: Pfft, lightweight. My father used to drink at least 20 cups a day. (That's not a joke. He constantly had a cup of tea in his hand at all times and would drink it down within 10-20 minutes then immediately go back for more)
Fun fact: The UK is 4rth in tea consumption
Hah, nice, as someone who drinks a lot of tea, I agree in nearly every point of your video. That's nice 😊 The one point a disagreed kind of is: Pyramid bags are very nice indeed, but as buying plenty of loose teas with different mixes, I prefer a cotton net. But I also make a whole teapot then. That's nothing for just a cup or mug...so we're fine. I fully agree with you, kind of =)
I don’t drink hot tea often, but after watching this I’m craving hot tea🤷🏻‍♀️
the best amount of milk in tea is all milk no tea
Matpat think the right thoughts here, no milk is best milk.
I always keep my tea bag in 😥
Ultimately the only thing correct to any one individual is what's the best taste the them.  That hotdog organization or whatever it was can deny ketchup all the want as a hotdog condiment, it's the only one I like, and everything else they consider valid is disgusting to me.  Yes, I'm calling the entire food taste testing thing bullshit.  And if anyone calls bullshit on that, go find that one Alton Brown show where one competing cook wasn't allowed to use salt on her french fries, and the judge called them "over seasoned" with too much salt.
"Why am I here? Why am I here?", as a fellow brit I emphathise
I wonder how long Steph had to plea for him to finaly do an episode about tea. She probably had to pull the wife card and as a fellow tea drinker I'm glad she did. 😂
"With the incorrect option ignored"  I fixed your stupid script
You didn't actually test if microwaving the water was any different. You only microwaved the tictok tea which had all the other different variables. I guarantee in a blind taste test you couldn't tell the difference if the form of heating is the only difference.
I wonder when þe’ll make þat tipping video…
I agree with you mat
8:59 Ryan George. Is that you?
Wait... MILK FIRST?! That's NOT a British thing! I've never seen anyone in the last 26yrs of my life putting milk first.
Do a video about the game outer wilds and see how realistic it is ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I do the ancient Chinese style of tea called 功夫茶 (Gong Fu Cha) if you would ever like to learn about it! I promise it's the best tea you'll ever have
Me when I saw the tick tok as a British person.                    🫣🫣🫣🤬🤬🤬
Mat thinking 4cups is a lot:  Iran,turkey, India, the uk and... :
licorice-mint is the best kind of tea, change my mind.
you guys add milk?
hello there im matpat and im gonna ruin your lives
as a brit if i said in public to put in milk first i would be lynched cus no one does that here
food teary
Tea originated in China, so what are you talking about by interviewing only a British person?
McDonalds tea☕ soo good
I don't even add milk. But that might be because I grew up Russian.
British have tea because of China and India. Look it up
Yes 0:44
I'm still not a tea drinker...i taste no difference. But i did get to try a butterscotch tea today.
As a British guy we all put our milk on top
Does Matpat realise British people don’t put the milk in first?
Is there a difference in taste between boiled and microwaved water?
i cant drink tea but for some reason this is probably my favorite food theory video ive watched in a while
Why... would you ever put milk into the tea???
You don't  need milk for tea I alway make my tea just hot water so you want to mess with me let the flood get open to me
Kermit
As a british person i hate tea but when i used to make it for my mum, i never once put the milk on the bottom- its like milk before cereal.
Did anybody else get up to make some tea while watching
I was expecting to see a turkish tea too. you know the most tea consuming country per person in the world by far
"Hello! Avocado Cat here to remind you that while tea does taste good, always remember to drink some water." 🐈🥑
I'm a minute in and I'm already shocked  YOU PUT MILK IN THE TEA??? I just take warm water, put a teabag in and some sugar..
Me and my dad drink 9 gallons of tea per week
Teas from China. She said hundreds of years. More like thousands
Didnt know that steph was bri'ish
1:52 Turks: ????
so... as an American who enjoys loose leaf tea.... do people really put milk in their tea? that sounds disgusting
“Thou shalt steep the tea bag for three minutes. Thou shalt not steep it for one or two minutes, except it be on the way to three. Five, is right out!”
So when are we gonna get the episode where Mat does the boarder blast challenge that got mentioned in the Taco Bell episode?
13:35 mhhh hmmm i agree
See now we need to pit the British way vs the Chinese way
Tea Is tea that is my opinion on that subject
Come on Matt, that was clearly a satire attempt of British Tea. Those people in the TikTok tea were trying to offend as many Brits as possible.
I'm British and I put the milk in last but I also put the tea bag and sugar in first before the water
I drink like 3 gallons of tea a month..
I agree with MatPat, milk in tea is not good
3-4 cups is advarage for us Brits also most people put milk last not first
Tell your wife to pick a cup and reuse it.
Now for the important questions MILK or CREAM and what kind of MILK or CREAM
It’s Tea Time
"Why is the handle so hot?!"  YOU PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE!
*Sees topic for the movie* If there isn't an Uncle Iroh mention I unsub...
0:48 that's sounds like a pretty good kids show Or maybe  a spinoff of Ben ten's upgrade alien
I have a theory you may get a video from spiffing Brit soon
HAH, try telling my grandma that! She has the BEST tea ever!
Semi early
Waits for spiff to show up in the comments 😂
It seems that you have NO idea what happens to a tea mug if you just try and 'rinse it out', you might want to look up how tea tans the inside of mugs if you don't thoroughly was them each time.  Also, milk first hasn't been a thing in the UK for years except for people who are philistines. Milk in first was discarded when the electric kettle came along.
He is very clearly English not "british"
I would like to know who drinks anything warm yes I know I'm weard
I think he is trying to reach out for help. You can clearly see in the InvestTEAgation team pictures, his wife and their UK friend both look splendid but him ? he looks like a drug addict who didnt sleep for 5 days. Why would anyone in their right mind chose that picture ? I believe this is a cry for help 2:18
So the video's conclusion is that we were doing it right all that time.   Anybody in modern Britain that puts milk in tea first is a heretic. The British guy in the video is letting us all down 😂
That's how she makes her tea? no way! NO WAY! I always add in whatever tea bag first and then I boil the water and then put in the water and then I'll add the milk after  Edit: funny homemade method of making tea partially made sense from a scientific standpoint but adding the milk after. Guess I was a genius the whole time
As a Brit, this *H. U.  R. T.  S* to watch
just clicked on the video, haven't watched it yet. but I made sure to get myself a nice mug of sweet cold tea :) ok time to see how I'm gonna die from it
can't wait to see the coffee version lol
putting the milk on top helps it seep down evenly throughout the drink but putting milk first just keeps it concentrated at the bottom right??
3-4 cups Thats a normal morning in England, speaking as someone born and raised here
It was my des-tea-ny to watch this
I disliked bc of the tea jokes ;-; also I am from the UK
This sounds kinda Nice,  Tik tok tea, tiktoktea tik... tok... tea...
I've been waiting for this video since I first moved over from game theory <3
'We're optimisers' he says earnestly while glossin over his unoptimised dishwasher full of mugs where there cud be salmon cookin :P
I’m surprised you didn’t bring up the kettle itself tannin and stainless steel react to one another and bond meaning if you brew in a stainless steel kettle it will over time become more and more bitter
I wonder what difference different milk would have
Even I knew that not how you do it Microwaved tea isn't bad tho
When do we get food theory merch?  I want an apron.  I also adore Mat getting excited like a little kid on Christmas when his mind is blown from the surprising differences of making TEA.
I have a question my mom puts lemon in her tea instead of milk does that change anything with the flavor and stuff?🤨
You have offend the England army
I raise you only peasants who couldn't afford good mugs out in milk first, the upper classes have been doing it right for centuries
( *spiffing brit intensifies* )
That TikTok tea is ungodly
I feel for no reason as a British person that i feeI I should be offended lol
All the tea is ruined with that milk...
How can you call this the definitely best way to drink tea when you didn't even TRY sugar or honey???
Y’all put milk in tea..? I usually just put water 😀
I honestly brew tea with a reusable Kurig pod and loose-leaf tea on the "strong" setting. Makes me wonder why they didn't consider Kurig tea as a testing possibility.
I steep my tea for about ten minutes to make sure that it's nice and strong. Add just a bit of sugar, and you're done. Milk ruins it. And rinse out your mug you lazy animal!!!!!
You didn’t try different type of teapots or heating the teapot first versus not… !
And yes, the absolute best amount of milk is 0 ml.
I like that I already do the majority of these things! I brew for 3:30 personally, and have a little less milk, but for me I like a bitterness
Matpat, you're missing a crucial factor about brewing tea. Try brewing it out in soft water.
Finally an episode for me.
Nobody mentioning how mat is absolutely right about tea being better without milk? If you’re adding milk to make tea less tea-like or ‘mellower’, you probably should choose a different beverage
The fact that the paper bags dont actually let the water pass through the leave is why I take the tea bags by the strings and gently pull the bags back and forth through the water. Of course, that only works when you're using a cooking pot rather than a tea pot. But, those of us who drink cheap tea and dont have expencive kettles must make due with what we have
I NEVER knew that people put milk in tea. That’s entirely new to me. I don’t do that at all.
I need to just say I love the MatPat's family dynamic and how he's matured. I hope Ollie looks at videos like this when he's ten and goes "they still make jokes like this!"
Put the bag in first,  Then add boiling water from a kettle Serve.
How dare you Sir, Yorkshire tea is the best tea and it will always stay that way.
Food theory idea how much bread does it take to make a couch
Oh matpat! every nanna knows you heat the pot first , no wonder it was cold 🤭
No sane british person actually puts milk in first also. A varriable you missed was putting the tea in then the water rather that dunking the tea.
I was the 2nd view baby
00:21, I guess I'm MatPat's wife now.
Many Brits would scoff at the idea of milk going in first 🤢
The Spiffing Brit would like a word with you.
Biggest issue is you should have done blind taste tests. The fact you all knew which was which each round makes the results far less meaningful. Your expectations would have effected your decisions. With blind tests, you'd have just picked what you liked best.
Take a teabag, put it in a mug. Add the amount of sugar you want. Then pour your water (boiled in a kettle) aiming at the bag to diffuse the tea a bit. Add a splash of milk. Stir and press the bag against the side for some more flavour. You can leave it in a bit but that’s just preference.  That’s how I do it, I hope it’s not too controversial.
You are incorrect "It is hot leaf juice" - unkle iroh
I legitimately wrote these steps down
That means we Frisians had it right for all those centuries.
15:27 in a bowl of cereals, definitely not in tea
I’m Scottish and I don’t really care about tea
What is this she doing I freaking love tea bro taeeèeeeeèeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I like my tea strong and sweet or realy sweet and still strong
Milk for tea 😂 Milk for cereal 😎
where's the intro????
I hate how even the UK takes credit for the most tea drinking even though it's like 4th and number 1 in tea drinking Is turkey
Who puts milk in tea
T bag. lol
I have always wanted to try British tea but I will tell you one thing you have not lived your life until you had some Texas sweet tea and even then the best sweet tea is from a Mexican restaurant with some breakfast tacos in the morning 💖
The topic of this video is not my... cup of tea... (I prefer hot cocoa this time of year) lol
Stop hallucinating
I think there could be another factor: what type of milk?
Chinese tea is the better than the crap from Britain.
A food theory questions I've had for a while is: would it be possible for a restaurant like the one in the end of Ratatouille to exit? Like in the legal sense.  Because the restaurant from chef Gusto gets closed because of a rat infestation, but then they just open another restaurant and dont solve the rat problem?? So would the people that eat there need to sign a waver or something? Like if you get sick it's not on us type of thing? Idk it's something that really bugs be about the ending of that moive.
Don’t let the smithing Britt watch this video
🗿
In other words he made tie for his wife and she told him he made it wrong
They just keep rolling with the puns. And I love it!
Next food theory how to make chocolate milk
Matpat: lecturing me about how to make the ideal cup of tea Me: mate, I'm British. I know all this. In all seriousness this was a very interesting video, but then again all of your videos are.
What type of milk thou
As a Brit I can tell you tea is a hot subject here, it's been a subject of debate in my family.
They discovered Irish tea is the best lol
As a British person I always put my milk on top. I never knew about the milk on bottom tradition
I'm from North West england. And (as I can tell) there is only one way to do it. Gen a tettly / Yorkshire tea bag. Put it in the mug. Put the water in an electric kettle. Put the water in 7/8 of the cup. Stir with a teaspoon for 30 seconds. Take the teabag out. Top it up with milk. NO SUGAR. Everyone has different preferences for the amount of milk but for us Northerners, I am pretty sure this is the agreed apon way to make tea. The way you did it is the southern way (heants the accent) we use normal tea bags not the wierd pyramid ones. We can be sometimes seen with a special tea pot which perfectly distils the tea or what ever but they are rear. If you got to a restaurant and ask for. tea they'll probably give you a pot. You're doing it all wrong. Green tea is better anyway. Take this into account. Thank you. Love your videos. Thanks for reading. Bye
matpat getting cucked
you missed a variable. a lot of tiktokers actually add honey instead of milk
I've been feeling under the weather lately, so it's just perfect that Matpat makes a video on my favorite sick drink :)
I'm english only way is first of mug mine is a platinum jubilee queen one Yorkshire tea bags only acceptable one boil kettle tea bag in 2 sugars then put in water leave for 3-5 mins then 0.5-1 second dash of blue milk(whole milk) then squeeze tea bag against side of mug untill it's as dry as possible dispose of tea bag stir and enjoy
im getting annoyed at how the thumbnails feel a little bit... clickbaity as of late. And im *not liking it*
love from assam 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️ best tea video ever 😁
Everyone knows you don't make lemonade with the lemons. You burn life's house down.. with the lemons.
Kermit wouldn’t do tea wrong
as a brit, i make my tea by heating up a kettle, put a teabag in the mug then pour the water in, then a teaspoonful of honey or sugar, and some milk.
It is my responsiblity as a Turkish person to say this      Turkish tea is best tea
I speak as an English lady that loves tea.   - I've never put milk in first!
Love my mint tea with honey
Was that a Ryan George Pitch Meeting reference at 8:58?
Tea is gross
If you microwave water to make your tea, you don’t deserve to call yourself a tea drinker
This begs the question, is there a difference in how you boil water? I don’t see how microwaving water is any different than in an electric kettle. It’s just different ways to transfer heat.
its funny they framed straya guy as british guy
3 or 4 cups of tea a day, mate those are rookie numbers
... but doesn't everyone use a spoon to squeeze the tea to their own preference?
Britain's not gonna like this one Matpat 😐
You sir are safe now from spiffing brits shenanigans
I feel like the fun in life gets zapped out of things by this channel and the overthinkers behind it, I love the theorists bur I think everything gets spoiled in a way.
the only way is getting uncle iroh to test it
I'm so gonna make tea this way from now on...for the most part. *Dips the tea bag a couple times because I don't wanna wait 3 minutes*
I don't know anyone who as ever put milk in first. I'm in the UK. It's just not a thing
Matpat: "warm leaf water" My brain: Uncle Iroh: "How could a member of my own family say something so horrible!?"
May I just say, Matthew. Please don't do coffee after this. I've seen the HEMA community up in arms before. I don't want to see two barista champions react to a Theorist video.
I'm with Matt on the 'no milk in tea"
Loved the video! Although, I'm surprised you didn't tackle the question of whether or not scalding the pot/cup makes a difference to the taste. I know a couple of Irishmen who will die on that hill.  Also, Skeeeep!
Okay, but do you put the tea bag in still water, or do you pour the water on the tea bag?
Don’t worry Mat, I support milk-free tea. Don’t get ahead of yourself though there are exceptions (boba).
Pls look at my comments on your latest game vid
OKAY LOOK THE BRITS ALMOST ALWAYS PUT THE MILK IN AFTER I KNOW ZERO PEOPLE THAT PUT IT IN BEFORE
Matthew puts translucent tea in glass mugs...
i think it'd be incredible if you guys set up an overhead camera for the countertop!! then we could see the tea.. XD
Steph: “I’ve practically fermented myself”  Matpat: *Puffed Cheeks of soon to be howling laughter not but a few frames before the next scene*  Gonna be honest, that is by far the funniest part cause I know that was genuine XD
everyone: i put milk in my tea  me: screw milk, i will have my tea with lots of sugar
0:55 "HOW COULD A MEMBER OF MY OWN FAMILY SAY SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE"
should have had the spiffing brit
Im British and have never known anyone to put milk first.. I always do it: teabag, hot water, let that stew, then sugar so it dissolves fast in the boiling water, then milk to bring the temp down
most of the uk pours the milk in on top
The truth has been spoken: best milk, is no milk
The thumbnail intrigues me
Best tea in Brazil is called beer.
you only put milk first if its a THIN bone china cup. nothing else. strangely that material makes a massive difference to the flavour, and thats also when milk first prevents cracking.
When Matpat said they need someone British I thought of Dawko in a heartbeat.😂😂😂
still sort of wrong on the milk the best way is to heat the milk and water together, if you add cold milk to hot water you burn the milk. that why the milk second tasted better because the cup cooled to water down a bit more  burning the a bit milk less.
May I (as a Brit) inform you of the correct way to make tea.  1. Insert the teabag (into a pot or cup depending on if it’s a quick cuppa for you and a mate, or a full on formal event.)  2. Hot water poured from a freshly boiled electric kettle  3. Stir and press the teabag in the side of the cup with medium force (don’t tear the bag or knock the cup over, but don’t pay it and say it’s a good boy either.   4. Remove teabag once it has brewed to your preferred strength, judge by colour.   4.5. If in teapot pour into cups  5. Add milk and sugar/sweetener to your taste and stir it in with the same teaspoon from earlier.   6. Remove spoon and serve.  Also brand of teabag is important.  Some prefer Yorkshire tea Some prefer PG tips But real ones use twinnings.
is matpat racist twords the brits?
As a life time tea drinker with stakes in both england and japan I absolutely agree with this entire video, I was expecting you to test whether heating the milk or adding cold milk was better and if roasted tea leaves vs boiled tea leaves had a better taste.
I don't like tea so.
"You're not supposed to squeeze the tea bag"  Today I learned
Bro does every one put their milk in the tea cause I just put hot water and the flavor
I am practically a sweet tea professional, but hot tea isn’t my cup of tea 😂
Tom is such a cutie!!!
So keep making my tea the way I’ve always made it? Thanks Mat. Now for the sugar debate!
I watched this while drinking tea
Hi
Now I'm not a major tea lover I have had tea before but I'm more of a hot cocoa man myself. But I wouldn't turn my nose up if someone brewed me some tea
I've always disliked the flavor of most tea. But my dad almost always made it for me, and after watching this, I think he was steeping it for WAY TOO LONG WE'RE TALKING, LIKE, TEN MINUTES
Qualitea brings back memories of charlieissocoollike! I do miss her sketches. Though I get why she's left YouTube
Excuse. Me. WHAT DID YOU SAY!!?  RULE. BRITANNIA. BRITANNIA RULE THE WAVES.
Me and my husband, both british, watching this like “…everyone pours the milk on top now guys. Plz. We have for at least 30 years.”
They forgot the most important aspect of drinking tea: pinkie out.
Being British, my ideal method for making tea is tea bag first, boil the kettle pour the water in, while pouring hot water in, use a teaspoon to ground the inside of the bag then add a few drops of milk. Yorkshire tea bags are the best.
wait i’m american and i never made tea before and i didn’t look up how to do it because i thought it was pretty plain and simple … i over brewed it (not knowing that was a thing until today) and i thought it was too biter and i’ve never drank it again . i needa try to make tea again the correct way 😭
First of all, can we please stop call british tea tradition tea! Tea comes from Asia, the british dont invent it and nor the develop it. They just steal it, like every piece of culture from other countries. And that is even not a theory or a food theory. It is a fact, a science fact! Bon Appetit!
wait until mat finds out that turkey consumes the most tea
As a brit that worked in a café where we sold a lot of tea, most people preferer milk on top. We actually used to make fun of the few that had milk first. Just thought u might want to know.
As a British person, I think putting the milk in first is a crime against humani-tea.
Thanks Mat-tea Patty. The tea puns are annoying. Puns are my exper-tea-se. **sigh** Oh well. As an Aussie am traumatised watching that TikTok tea. It's making me cry to tea-rs.
wait, you're suppose to add milk?   also, question: is butter-up toast better than butter-down toast?
It is brew-tea-ful to see traditions stay hot.
it tastes better if you put iron water in it
As a chef I love when y’all make discoveries I had to explain to get my degree
what about stirred not stirred
Matpat sure loves word "whopping" x))
5:32 ah yes the reason this channel exists
This is how you know I'm American.   I don't use any milk or sweetener. It's just water and tea bag.  I use faucet water.  I put the tea bag in the cold water.  And then...  I put it in the microwave for about a minute and a half.  To add to that, I stir the tea but leave the bag in for the entire time I'm drinking my tea.  I'm down to try others things (definitely trying out the triangle bag vs the normal type) but I'm sticking to using the microwave. Unless that tea is noticeably different in flavor, the time I save on getting that liquid to my lips is worth it.   Oh I also love my tea (and coffee) very strong. Like punch me with each sip. Like I went and just munched on my teas and beans and let them seep in my mouth.
It is cool to see a more international food theory episode as food varies a lot around the world, food theory often focuses on very US only foods.
as a British person, can you just not??
Mat pat should check out doc browns my proper tea
An American could never make the perfect cup of tea
What about a kreig?
I love the jokes and its the best perfectTEA level!
To trigger people more, we need an episode which you compare British, Japanese, and Turkish (wildcard but did you know they are bigger consumers than Brits and have a special glass for it) way of tea making 🧿🌻
5:56 the correct answer is a sploosh
I think you just made a nation mad
Lived in the UK my whole life. Never once have I seen someone put milk in first and not get clowned on for it. Were already 2 decades ahead of this vid
Im making fancy tea as I listen to this 😌
I aint takin no tea advice from an american
Does anyone else not like milk at all in their tea? 😂I just heat up water and leave the tea bag in the whole time to get the strongest flavor possible😅
I never understood, why people put milk in tea, never liked milk tea personally
There are different tea for a reason mat
Should have tested water in a microwave versus water on the stove or on a electric kettle
Anytime I’ve made a pot of tea I would use my coffee maker I would just put the teabags in the top part, now for loose tea I would actually have a special craft for It
As a brit I don't think I've ever put milk in first I think new British generally does milk on top
TIL people put milk in tea
Does anyone want to introduce him to greatest uncle?
My Dad uses a Kuerig. Your move Mat Pat.
When life gives me lemons i make lemon ice tea
Hey Mat and team, you forgot something. THE WATER! Just like the pizza episode can water make a difference?
Would love to see your take on Turkish and Chinese tea. The use of purple clay and etc.
And why shouldn't we boil our water in the microwave? When it have after the boiling the same amount and the same temperature, it should not make any difference...
Was the reg bag, pyramid, loose test all using the same brand of tea?
Hot into cold, curls. Cold into hot, is alright as it lowers the temp rather than raising it
me not using a tea bag 😁
I thought she is gonna end it with this episode has been Tea-rrific
The Brits are coming for you mat
When you just learned all the science in biology class
Can I be in your next video
I’m on matpat’s side keep that milk out of my tea also steph said it “it needs sugar”
8:36 the only issue with this is that triangle tea bags have a lot of microplastics, which are probably harmful to humans
all tea taste disgusting,I don't know why people like it,it taste really bad
Wait, y'all put MILK in your tea? I just put sugar in-
Leaf Wasser/Soup Sucks 👀 Ohhh Steph better come in to save the day (Kekw)  Great work 🍵 Team, Enjoyed the 🍵 Vid immensely. Science will usually come in to save the day & find better ways to enjoy our food/drinks. Hope your doing well, Keep being Awesome & Safe Bros 🍂 🍵 😎 👊
As an American I am confused why they put milk in tea
Tea related story time   One time when I was about 8 I made camomile tea and I put it in the microwave to heat it.   i did not put it in a microwave safe cup I used a plastic cup. When it was done I drank it and a few minutes later I threw up.  I am almost 20 and the smell of camomile tea still makes me a bit queasy.
I'm down with you Matt. Milk does not belong in tea. Definitely in coffee though.
Where's the sugar science. Mat. How do I do a sugar. How do I do a stir? I've heard it makes a difference. Do I put in the sugar, then the bag? Or no? How many sections should I split it in to? You're leaving me in the dark, I'm drowning in tea, and I have no idea if it's even good.
Why milk on top makes a difference: milk proteins can bond to tannic acid, forming insoluble complexes that have the umami taste of the protein and none of the astringency of tannin.  This process works better with higher heat, so when milk is added on top, more of those proteins will reach the higher tea temperature and soak up more tannic acid, as opposed to milk on bottom, where the tea is instantly cooled to milk temperature, bringing the solution up to final temp instead of down.
Did Pitch Meeting give you permission to say, "Wow, wow wow wow"?
What about the temperature of the water when steeping tea?
if you eveer tasted tea my aunt sells, you going say way differendly ;p
She drinks 3 to 4 cups of tea a day? *laughs hysterically in british*
As a brit myself I would put a tea bag and sugar boiled water and then milk. I didn't know a devil would dare put milk first.
For the last test "cup test", you poured hot water using the glass teacup, which probably caused it to be way hotter than the other 2 cups. I know it wouldn't make much of a difference but still wanted to point it out.
TEA SUCKS there fixed your title
Meanwhile Egyptians:here's my 4039493393930304040040404th cup of tea for the day
17:20 I already put milk on top I don't know why this is a new discovery for Americans
Lol Tom made a film theroy during the Brew Time part. Lol
How many times do they say tea?
Lol.  Warm leaf water!  Also, I've always thought milk in tea was an abomination.   Lastly, I enjoy hot tea but frankly an entire pot is just not enough.   Ergo, iced tea is just better.   Note:   sweet tea is too sweet.   Sugar is an enhancement not a main ingredient.
I make my tea in a pot, and put the water and teabag in at the same time, and then boil it, and add the milk at the end, and strain the tea into your mug.  Not sure if this is a thing punjabi people just do or what, but the many ways that people make tea is interesting.
Matt is right no milk is the best tea.
BREAKING NEWS : mass riots occur all around Britain as so called content creator "mat pat" makes the worst tea in existence
Wait, you people put milk in your tea? Where i live milk in tea is never seen or heard of its just water, tea bag, kettle, some sugar or honey.
I'm surprised they didn't specify the water temperature
0:35 btw you can use tea cups more than one time :,(
0:31 i can relate to steph.
Do a doctor who theory? on film? don't know what about tho.
My mom tips half a milk bottle cap in her tea and best tea has milk in British so my opinion here is law
S/O to my country South Africa for being up there with the greats in Tea I guess 😂🤞🏾
Props to Steph for seeing a few seconds into the future and catching the tea that Tom accidentally tried to deposit on the kitchen counter. Honestly, a lot of mom energy there.
Way to perpetuate the ruining of tea by Europeans
As a Southern we don't partake in hot tea with milk.
WAS THAT THE TARDIS???
Be fun to see a coffee version of this video
As someone who enjoys "southern style" sweet tea, I agree that the best amount of milk in tea is 0ml. Was also relieved that this episode was for specificly English tea. While watching I remembered that the tannins from tea and the persimmon fruit can be used as a first aid measure for sea snake bites while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. I wonder what other common food items can be used to apply first aid, when resources are limited, while waiting for an ambulance.
The last pun was for the outro.  Well played, MatPat.
In India we have 100% milk tea with sugar
I like iced tea way more than hot tea and also I can't put milk in my tea because I'm lactose mean I could use almond milk but I have never tried it and I don't know how it'll taste
I'm hoping you do more research on the other entities as well it would be appreciated.  one for each type of tea preferably also for chili and green tea would be next see if there's any more differences that can be noted?
what kind of milk is also a variable; whole, 2%, skim and other kinds
As a South African who loves her tea and grew up drinking a lot of it, this video really speaks to me.
Matpat really said “the queen died let’s diss the British dirty water”
Honestly, as a brit I have never seen anyone put milk in first. Might be a Southerner vs Northener thing (I am from the North), but everyone I know puts milk on top.
Huh, well that's already what I've been doing (I use teapot over bag in mug tho). So that's neat. Also, no milk. MatPat is correct.
Matt Patt used his best photo for this episode.
Just going to sip my Chai tea and watch this TEArrable Video cringing and crying on the inside… you see this TEAr! 😢 you did this to me! Now I’m all punny!
Can't help but move that there's no scientific reading behind not boiling water in the microwave. Seems like it's just "Matt doesn't know how to handle hot things" and "lol TikTok bad" for that
I like how mat takes 2 extremes and a direct middle and says the middle is the best.
The fact I just got done watching The Spiffing Brits recent upload and this auto played next... O.O  I wonder if Spiff will become aware and send you Yorkshire TEA XD
What the everliving FRICK did you just say about my tea?
As a brit, never heard of anyone putting milk in first.
MatPat calling outright his tax right off is something he usually does not talk about
I agree with Matpat No milk in tea is the best
Why didn't you try steeping the three bag types for different amounts of time to compensate for the type of bag?  They should be much more comparable even if the traditional flat bag takes longer to achieve the same strength.  This would be a better comparison.  I would expect one might be more bitter than another, for example.
Tea ☕️
As a Northern English tea drinker from along line of Tea purists I was very surprised that anyone ever added the milk first.  It's considered very uncouth to  "scold" the milk by adding it first and yes we Brits do take Tea far too seriously, especialy in the Midlands and  the North.  That was another informative fun video. Thanks
also ur supposed to preheat the teapot.
I stand and live by irish Lyons pyramid tea bags
45 minutes ago!!
As someone who has visited London British tea sucks I'll die on that hill
Im british and have decided that this is a skill issue. Grab teacup Add teabag  Boil water Once its boiled immediately pour Add some milk (or don't if the welsh stole your tounge) Stir Remove the teabag Drink it
Newfoundlander here. First boil the water. Pour over tea bag in cup. Steep, squeeze the bag, and remove.  Add Carnation milk and sugar. Stir. Enjoy.  Oh, and the tea HAS to be Tetley Tea brand! No substitute!! 😁  Edit: I only steep my tea for like a minute max, so squeezing the bag isn't has bad for tannins.
i thought everyone already knew tea tasted different if you put the milk in first. if you put in the water and then the ribena concentrate you can barely taste the ribena but if it is the other way round it is a totally different story
Scoffs in British* only 3 a day, thoese are rookie numbers
Wait milk in tea sound odd to me
Me as a British person who had superior taste and puts the milk ontop of the tea💂‍♀️
as a brit, everyone i know does exactly this, never seen anyone put milk first, I think that tradition has been toppled already
One variable they haven't considered is the temperature of the water you steep the tea in. Too hot and the leaves burn.
1.) Use whole leaf tea. 2.) Pyramid bags are made of plastics. Don't use them. 3.) The best tea is made in a Gaiwan using the Oriental method.
any one else drink tea with no milk (or cream)?
lady gray is amazing and you can not change that
the spiffing Brit we need to know
I haven't really tried tea, but has anybody here tried Ube boba?  It's delicious!!! 😋
Oh boy, here we go. I'm going to predict that this may talk about tea ceremonies and how bagged tea is actually crap tea. Oh, and also the tisane delineation. All I know is that the video hasn't started in earnest and I feel tea drinkers from the depths of Reddit clawing their way in.
Mat needs to open a restaurant called "The Theorist House Of Tea"
This is just the standard way of making tea though? At least where I come from. I've never seen anyone make it differently.
👍
Wait... you guys drink tea with milk?
Me: "Loose leaf will always make the best tea!" Also me: *steeps tea for way too long, making it bitter*
14:35 As a British person A is the perfect amount because the colour is "Heman colour"
I will stand by an unglazed fired clay cup. Being porous is actualy good as long as you always use it for the same drink every time (Oh and no milk :D)
As a Brit putting milk in first is criminal. Most people consider you tapped if you put the milk in first now.
Welp, good to know I've pretty much been making my tea the best way possible since the beginning. The only thing I need to change is getting pyramid bags rather than the basic flat ones. Still tastes good in flat bags though if the pyramid ones are over your budget. Also, I recommend trying with cream or chocolate milk for more texture and flavour once in a while. It's good. 🙂👍
Teabag Sugar (if any) Water. Milk.  Stir. Drink.  Enjoy.
We need to make William afton the perfect tea, it will reduce the number of child murders from him.
This was a really interesting video but as an actual Tea Sommelier, I found the whole thing eye twitchy 😂😅
If you want excellent tea then just come to India and try thousand types of tea which are much more taster and better then your British tea.
Food : exists   Food theory : nope something wrong
Never had tea with milk In it
Matpat... I use to like you. I don’t even drink tea but I am British. Edit: OH! You confirmed what I’ve been saying my whole life!
Err the most important thing in tea making is the hardness of the water and you guys totally missed it madness
Wait you guys don’t put sugar in your tea?
Me watching this who didn't even know there was supposed to be milk in tea like: Is that why I've never liked any tea that I've had? (Always made by me or my mom, who taught me.)
And can you please pray 🙏🏻 for my family my dad has pneumonia 💉🫁 and my mom has nose 👃 issues and her taste 👅 but I think they pretty much recovered ❤️‍🩹 for the most part anyway and can you please pray 🤲 for me and everyone I know to live longer and achieve all of our life goals (that’s not sinful and/or disrespectful of course) please🙏🏻⛪️🔔⛑🔯🏥🌠🤲🏙🤞🏻🌇🌃✡️✌🏻☮️☦️🏞🌌💒🌆🌄🎇🕋🕍🕎☪️🕊✝️🛐🌅🧎🏼‍♂️📿🙏🏻.
Can you do a theory on film theory talking about anything you found interesting on the owl house.
Yes, no milk in tea Free the tea from the milk!!!
Ok for all the barbaric Americans you make tea   1. Put tea bag ( Yorkshire tea ) in first  2.put sugar in the cup  3. Then pour hot water in after boiling in a kettle 4.then take out the teabag and put it in the sink or a old cup  5. Then pour the milk in and your finished
Is no one going to discuss the fact that they are ALL drinking from the same mugs? As a germaphobe I literally wanna vomit. I'm screaming! Mat and Steph I get they are married, but some random dude just drinking out of the same mugs? After COVID just ended too? How is no one else upset about this.
Great video but what about the type of milk
How did you test your milk or tea first? Teabag or teapot? Because if teabag, then yeah,  cause milk first stops the tea brewing.  If teapot... no idea.
Somebody get hold of The Spiffing Brit ASAP
I don't normally comment, but I feel so strongly about this. If you talk about poor people historically pouring the milk at the bottom, then the poor people couldn't afford decent cups. Therefore, one should look at what the middle to upper class were doing as they could afford what they liked best. British people do consider pouring the milk on top to be proper. Sorry Tom - you've been in America too long
This is great info but the amount of sugar is also a matter of importance! I usually go for a 1/4 cup(50g) per liter when making a whole kettle, so about 10-15g per cup of tea and it's perfect!
I’m already shivering in sugar
I like to imagine they told Tom to do the most accent possible or recorded the bits where Tom sounds the most British just for this episode.    Could it be True? With these people possibly.
No milk = best milk, I agree.
You should know how to make the perfect tea because uncle iroh taught us how 😭
1:06 you fucks use milk in tea?
i know u have a brit with you... but your still wrong. its a proven fact that Americans just cant make tea.. plus ur tap water is grose. and taste wrong
*laughs in iced tea*
I would like u to try actual Indian tea from local tea stalls like gather some information about it (not actually going to India) try Indian tea it is mostly milk and a little water just trust me ok?? Try it it is very *GOOD*
In conclusion the British way is the correct way except put your milk after the tea. So... how tea is at my local British themed tea shops. 😅
Spiffing brit would like to know your location
Are we going to do sweet tea next?🤔🤔
66104th
Mention how tea comes from Asia but don't include how Asian countries drink tea, considering they have various ceremonies dedicated to tea drinking and intricate process about how to do it, plus since that's where tea originated, it should be one of the contenders.  Also not taking into account how the hot water affects the proteins in the milk... There's a whole cooking process for mixing hot and cold liquids where you warm up the cold liquid first before mixing to avoid causing issues with the milk proteins.   Though I suppose the whole thing is subjective and pointless anyway, still would have been nice to see them think it through a bit more.
As a brit myself I can confirm pretty much the entire video. Milk has to go in last. For me I brew in a mug because who owns a teapot, remove the teabag then add a splash of milk and by a splash I do mean hardly any milk, just enough to slightly lighten the colour will do.
6:35 If it wasn't already, you could mark this video as educational!
I'm going to be the real here I didn't know people put milk in their tea until today usually what I do is just figure out a way to heat up water put a tea bag in it stir and then drink
This whole episode is how wrong everyone is
Yes, the best business expenses, the ones that make no sense.
In the Indian subcontinent, we have this tea-like drink where we boil tea leaves in a splash of water and then bombard the remaining water+tea with milk to the top of the cup, Boiling that mixture until it's aromatic. It's called doodh Pati (literally "milk leaves") and I'm curious as to how that fares against the traditional British tea.
It’s from our lovely time as an empire when we imported tea from the Chinese and turn went to a little while then and then after we went to war we use the British the British Raj and the Queen Queen Victoria the first imported a lot of tea and one curry person as soon as she go to the prime minister she introduced him to the lovely tasting curry
I am a super sweet tooth. Bring on the sugar!
Welcome to the Club,  Steph. ;-) I drink my teas without milk. But with shugar and lemon. Actually, it's an idea for an episode: is lemon in tea makes a difference?
The real purpose of this video was for Matpat to be passive aggressive about his dishwasher
Here in Britain I remember when my mum first brought the pyramid tea bags when I was in high school gosh that was a while ago
Well today food theory taught me that if I want stronger tea, I should just use more tea leaves instead of steeping for longer
The Microwave it's causing me pain
I dident know I was going to be in this one
Early enough
As a heavy tea drinker this is the best episode ever.
Did I miss the negative microwave result? Why can’t you use the microwave?
This is going to sound weird, but I would also have tried to make the tea with tape water and bottled water to make sure that it isn't another variable 🤔  (I say I would because I've never done a proper tea cup so I need to learn to do that first 😅)
The best warm drink for the cold seasons for me is Broth, just warm broth
This feels like a personal attack on the spiffing brit 😆
We needed... A Brįtįsh Þərsøn 😈    just the way he said it
You should play SlendyTubbies III Campaign, its a really good and unique horror game. It also has some lore! Nobody made a theory about it yet.
As a British person, I have put milk last my entire life and have never even heard someone even entertain the idea of putting milk first, its not a bowl of cereal, it's tea.
British? Really? They merely adopted it
Steph: Probably 3-4 cups of tea a day Me, who takes a litre of tea with me every morning: weakling
TEA IS BEST BREWED WITH SALT WATER AND SERVED IN BOSTON HARBOR.
I thinks that the Russian semaver glass cup  is the best way of serving tee it's just so much more presentable and looks way better than a kettle and it makes mixing other herbs with your tee much easier.   I personally boil water in a semaver then I put my tee leaves add some saffron cardamom and a stick of cinnamon the aroma taste and the looks of this are HOLY. It will take more time and money but it will make your day give it a try.  And mat is right best milk in tee is no tee.
Someone: makes TikTok tea Matpat: breaks into house and makes the perfect tea Also Matpat: "THIS IS THE TEA YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE DRINKING"
cheese
What's particularly wrong with heating water in the microwave? Exactly: nothing. Of course adding cold milk before adding the tea leaves (in whatever form) is a no-no. But the microwave is the least of your problems. It absolutely does not matter how you heat the water. And no, don't add milk to the tea. Matpat is right about that.
If we're doing bad tea puns let me say that Steph (sorry if I wrote it wrong) is really prea-tea. Just wanted to say that, she's neat. I like seeing her in Food Theory episodes. Big fan 👍
My family already puts milk in last lmao
"warm leaf water"  🤣🤣🤣🤣
13:39 "Best milk is no milk in tea" Correct! I take my tea without milk or sugar, and it's great that way!
Steph is a _God-tier_ parent, seeing Tom's wobbly hand and out of the corner of her eye and catching that tea in a split second.
i hate this 🙂
Stop, no milk shall be mixed to tea anymore, I've had enough. Stop doing that I'm serious
@The Spiffing Brit
Huh.... I always put the water in first. Tea, maybe sugar, water then milk.
That’s not how you make tea that little idiot no no I make it first you put the water in the kettle and then you put the kettle to boil depending on how much water you put in and then you put it in the teapot for about 20 minutes free to brew when you pour it out into a cup then you put the milk in if you like sugar do you put sugar with a sugar spoon A.k.a. a teaspoon
I’m a Brit… This just confirmed I’m doing it right…. No one in my family has ever put the milk in first… Was hoping to be more mildly annoyed.
I drink 10-14 cups of tea a day and drink them out of pint glasses. There is no stopping me
jokes on you I drink hot chocolate, not tea
*What kind of etard puts milk in tea?!?!*
Ko
I have never heard of anyone putting milk on the bottom
Hey guys it a new theory in which I tell you (the British) that your drink sucks
Won't lie, this video slightly triggered me but I guess it could have gone much worse so I'm glad of that:)
Most brits do put milk on top, you'd be hard pressed to see Brits putting milk in first at all. There's a reason rich people in ye olde days did it that way too.  We also have a type of spoon that is specifically designed to press the teabag to get a stronger taste, without the bitterness of letting it brew too long. Any teaspoon does the same job, but pressing the teabag against the wall of the mug does make a stronger tea without bitterness
Dam was hoping he would cover mushroom teas or mushrooms in general because of how powerful they can be
I have to go with MattPatt. No milk. But I also have to agree with tiktok. It needs sugar. My favorite hot tea is English breakfast with some sugar. I’m from the south. I don’t think I could survive drinking tea without sugar.
Stop my British torture
Every Brit is on Edge watching this
You mean,u never tried a French press or coffee maker,bruh,actually...
61k viewer thing is me
My Sunday afternoon drink is coffee, with masala chai tea that has Cinnamon brewed with it, then the splash of milk on top.  I typically stir after adding milk but maybe I shouldn't.
As a life long Brit you just told me what I already knew. And just to be clear, I don't know a single person who puts the milk in first and I have no idea where that myth that we still do comes from.
WAIT........do you guys not stur your tea once you put the bags in?
Watching this while drinking tea as an American
I drink tea like a man: without any milk.
17:05 Hol' up. You never actually did a control for microwaving the water.
Tea tends to stain as much or more than coffee. Rinsing the tea mugs generally would joy be sufficient.
BEST TEA, IS TEA WITH LIME!!!!     edit: I will stand firmly on this hill
I am a little confused about your "loose" tea in a metal capsule which is smaller than the pyramid bag... Just get a bigger tea strainer instead of making the pyramid bag the winner. There are tea strainers that are almost as big as a teacup itself. The pyramid bag is not superior to loose tea.
Mate, putting the the tea in first then the milk is the right way in Britain. I've never met anyone who thinks milk in first is right
I put coffee creamer in my tea.
Yo, boil kettle, put teabag in mug, pour water in mug over teabag. Add milk after brewed if you fancy.  British tea made, boom.
As a Brit who use to put the milk in first (I found it easier to gauge how much milk I had put in that way) I was often ridiculed by my fellow Brits for doing so. I tend to put the milk in second now and its more common that way now here too! I have also noticed the tea tastes better that way even though I was sure it wouldn't! Fun video guys!!
Tea no Milk just tea
matpat might have just started world war 3 with this video, you know what that means. . .BRING OUT THE HOT TEA CANNONS!
I personally think why they don’t give an exact time is because just like most things, taste changes between people’s preferences.  So maybe some people believed 3 minutes was the best while others said 5. So literally best choice is to say 3to 5 minutes. Just a thought maybe it’ll help your hypothesis going forward. God bless
I absolutely love Tom's reactions and responses in this. Just the casual 'Oh wow. There is.' got me good. 😆
I'm gonna be honest with you, I think the only person, I know of, that puts the milk in first is my Nan. I think most of us have stopped the whole 'milk first' tradition ever since the rise of kettles. You can still put the milk in the cup first, but it's usually just a case of popping the kettle on, sitting in the living room while you wait for the water to boil, hearing the click when it's done, pouring it into the cup with a teabag, adding the milk then sugar (to your taste). It's just more convenient to pour the water first because it takes you a few seconds to get up and into the kitchen and, adding the time it takes to get the milk, pour it then put it back, the water will have sat for a bit and won't be steaming hot anymore. Idk, though, it might just be my family's way of doing it.
This was an intresting episode of Food TheorTEA.
The water used  is a variable you missed.I suppose there is  an endless list of water you could go through. A cuppa brewed in Inverness is going to taste different than one made in Berlin, due to the difference in the water. Interesting video all the same, nice one.
Agreed Matt, milk in tea is horrid.
For anyone interested: Inside the Factory (a UK tv show) did an episode on tea and they brought in a scientist who studied the tea making process and figured out how to make the best cups of tea.
Cold brew
Why not preheat the cups/teapot with hot water first? Is that not a thing anymore?🤔  Also, I’d love to see MatPat tackle noon chai.
Whoever puts milk in first isn’t British or their a nonce
*Laughs in tea snobbery
Matpat: its none of my business  Also Matpat: makes a 20 minute video about it
The only good tea is southern sweet tea... facts. Sugarless tea is for psychos!
Qualitea content
If I ever go to England I will probably never go back and you will know why  🇬🇧
At this rate, Food Theory is basically Food Experiments
Ah poor Steph 3/4 cups a day I drink close to 10/12 there is even when and how you should do it
So, it's proof that milk should go AFTER the cereal!
Don’t worry I drink 3 to 4 cups a day is expensive the milk and have the tea bags but everyone has one add two a day four in the weekend
You couldn't even bring up ISO 3103. There is a defined standard for brewing tea, you should have at least followed it once and said, "oh that's horrible."
You know, as a part of the IB program, if you take chemistry, you have to design and complete your own chemistry experiment, write-up included. Because I'm a tea addict, I decided to look at the chemical reaction between the polyphenols in tea leaves and calcium carbonate in hard water that form a yucky, scummy skin on the top of your tea if you leave it too long. Turns out, adding just a few drops of lemon juice can keep your tea significantly fresher.
I have a sister, one time she made the tea, and put in WAYY more sugar than normal, very sweet I don’t recommend, sorry Jess
Nah Pu'er tea is the best
When I saw this title: "Uncle Iroh is either gonna Love or Hate this:/"
Omfg I'm pretty sure Steph's mom senses kicked in at 6:29 right before Tom spills his tea leaves.  Her face screams "This man will not be able to stop himself from opening that thing and I had better be there to catch the mess."
I don't like milk tea lemon tea is 1000 times better
As a British person I can say there's a huge argument over whether milk should go first or not, we even did it in a physics lesson proving my personal opinion that milk goes after because otherwise your tea cools down much quicker whilst it's brewing.  It's also completely personal how you like it but putting in the microwave is a sin here.
Im English
I’d say we put 5ml or a splash when there is also a spoonful of sugar to level out the more bitter tastes
Green and chamomile tea are delicious!
That's not a Pyramid, it's a Tetrahedron.  Yes, that's what got to me.
Putting cream in tea makes it undrinkable. Lemon juice is the way to go.
Felt the need to watch a video on tea as a Chinese person. ( I feel like people forget Asian countries like China and Japan are also really specific about tea probably more than Britain, with elaborate ceremonies and rituals, specific teapots, equipments, tea leaves, and so much more)
I'm British and I put cream in my tea why didn't they???
a beu-tea-ful novel-tea what a tea-riffic idea
being from South East Texas it means Sweet Tea is King.
I feel that dishwasher comment. Very real, very appreciated. You can use 2 cups in a day at most if you rinse your cups - one mug for coffee/tea and one glass/tumbler  for iced drinks. There are edge cases - hot cocoa is hard to rinse - but most of the time it is 2!
meanwhile me over here in the netherlands being discusted by the idea of putting milk in the tea
0:09 tea is not a drink just for cold weather, I have drank tea every day of my life sine I was about 5.   Wait it's never warm in the UK.
I'm with you Matpat, no milk tea is best tea.
Don’t nock brutish tea 🤬🤬😡😡😡
Why does Matpat use the zombie picture of himself
my grandpa put milk first in his coffee so he doesn't to stir
I just use the little bags lol. With sugar and milk and honey, sometimes no honey, sometimes lemon juice, it just depends. But somehow I do too much sugar and I should try not too. XD
Are secret recipes legal?
to be fair the traditional way didn't exists because we thought it made the best brew but rather it stopped the mugs from braking and no one I know uses it today.
British are not born in tea they just stole it from India and make it there own.
I'm British, I drink tea, and I don't know anyone who puts milk in first. That's nonsense.
No no no, you place the tea bags at the bottom of the coffee pot and send some water through. Then you pour your tea in a cup and add sugar and milk.
I agree with matpat, best milk is no milk. Imma be honest i find milk in tea rly offputting personally
Here's a final test for Matmap what about cold brew.  I let my tea brew over night in the fridge in a glass pitcher.
My mom who came to America from China likes tea
I'm waiting for "Heeeeellllllooooooo Fresh sponsored this video" to be the intro to one of these
Bro what type of milk is the best on tea now?
This is totally not fixing my tea experience as a British person who totally doesn't love tea lol
Hate to break it to you, but most British people these days do milk after tea. The milk first method, pretty much died out as quality mugs became more available, these days only older people go milk first.
3-4 cups a day? as a brit i'm offended, thats far too low
To be honest I'm british (northwest england) but everyone I know puts milk in after. You'd get a roasting if you put milk first in anyone's cuppa here.
I agree with Mat, why do people add milk- Does it actually help the tea?
Do you write your entire electricity bill off as a business expense?
Hey MAtt, I had a question that I would honestly like the answer to the satisfy my inner theorist. I have been getting a lot of VeggieTales on my tiktok recently and one song in particular "Pizza Angel" made me think. "Wait. They eat pizza and directly say 'tomato sauce'. Are the VeggieTales cannibals?" Also why can they telekinetically move things such as the pizza they eat?
Did anyone else hear the ring doorbell Wait that is my bell
brit here - i have never EVER met anyone who puts milk in first 😳😳😳😳
I don't anymore, but there was a few weeks when I was going through anywhere from 3 to 6 cups a day
Oh no Matt WHAT ARE THOOSE?!?! 7:02
i have one question, should the water go into the cup first or the tea bag?
Mmmm, the taste of human trafficking. The true British flavour
since when did people put milk in their tea that sounds disgusting
In terms of drinks Steph is royaltea
I was born by tea in the land of tea here in the UK
as an English person I can definitely say that we take a gcse in tea
Call me a monster if you want, but I use the closest thing to a kettle in my kitchen for a brew. The coffee machine. Edit: because machine boils the water and you can use it as a makeshift kettle.
This made me remember, a university professor had released a mathematical method to brewing your tea.
If you're making tea in a pot, it makes sense to add milk to the mug first. If you're making one mug at a time, you add the milk last. Either way, it is critical that the tea meets the water first to infuse the tea-ness, and the milk be added after to temper the mixture and add its flavour profile.
Not a brit here so like why do they put milk in the tea? Doesnt it ruin the taste?
Less than 4 minutes in and Steph gained massive respect from me with her opinions on that video. Love from the UK
🔥🔥🔥PLEASE do a theory on how big the Erdtree in elden ring is
godamn this channel feels like a tv show
Glad to know I've been making perfect tea my whole life.
NGL 18:55 was the hardest I've laughed at a Theory video in a long time. You tried Mat it's fine. 😂😂😂
In regards to the milk before or after part of the video I am reminded of a quote:  "Tradition is just peer pressure from dead people."  -Nils Leonard, Twitter, March, 28th 2019
16:40 who puts milk in their tea first?!? Also I don't think British people put their milk in first?
Such a subjective topic....
I'm a Brit, i like Tea  lets put it this way 'I'm not as chuffed as I would be if this video was NOT about Tea'
As a British person, Ive never met anybody who puts the milk underneath
Only 3 or 4 I drink 5 or 6, who makes their tea with milk
I switched my afternoon coffee to a green tea a few months ago. This was helpful. I bought a case of green tea from Costco and noticed they were in a weird bag type I hadn't seen before, those pyramid bags.  Other than the potential to burn my hand, is there any taste or quality related reason to not boil my water in the microwave? Seems like boiled water should be the same either way.
My personally loved tea is dark tea with two spoons of sugar, maybe one, and half of teaspoon of honey, like little bit.
I make tea a bit different but I am still british so here's how I make tea, i start by boiling water i put the water in a cup, I add a tea bag mix then remove then i add milk. I btw I ad milk on top
Most people in the UK put the milk in last as it's more convenient. If you do it first and are using a teabag, you lower the temperature of the steeping fluid so you get a weaker extraction.
I get the joke (Tea =British) but wouldn't have made more sense to also get an Asian tea expert's opinion since that's where tea originally comes from
I guess you can say this theory was, _Tea-dious_
I squeeze the tea bag to SPECIFICALLY get that bitter taste because if not the tea tastes weak
Team magreb here, the traditionnal way to make tea here is different from the british way. You start by boiling the water in a kettle(or the teapot directly) then you pour the water in the teapot with the tea inside, then we drink from the traditional glass ... glass, and we dont add milk, it's discusting
the correct amount of milk is NONE >:(
does steph not reuse cups? or is that a strange thing to do?
Chai is best. Period
I'm Sorry but @charlieissocoollike did it the proper (british way) years ago, and even got the proper press for it.
Nonsense, all Spiffing Brit watchers know NOTHING beats the POWER of Yorkshire Tea!
personally i dont like milk in my tea but that probably because my familie from Poland
The best kind of tea is, dragon mint tea. Change my mind
as a british person, I genuinely forgot you people have a season in which you don't drink tea. wild
This is technically a drink theory not a food theory
Yeah, screw milk in tea, if you gotta add stuff for your tea to be bearable you have a problem
Wait people dont have their tea super bitter, tbd thats probs why i use 2tsp sugar which my mom screams at me for doing
Steep -milk vs milk-steep
why would you put milk in tea
Yep, that's how I've been making them all my life.
“British tea” I didn’t know they grew tea in Britain! “…from India” Oh…
mat: we bring more quality to our lives with these theories   also mat: I practically live inside a closet
As an avid tea drinker I am happy you guys made this episode
I’ve always wanted to try Flanders’s hot chocolate from The Simpsons movie
Tea is best, and Americans have made sweet tea to enjoy all year round 😏😏
The thumbnail brought back PTSD from that Muppet Crumpet commercial
My only criticism here is that you chose not to bring TheSpiffingBrit for this XD
These vid topics have been excellent and the execution even better. You found the groove matt
Tea
Why not have a camera that can see into the mugs so we can also see the difference? That would make it better and easier.
When I brew my tea I steep for up to 10 minutes. I like the tannins sometimes.
As a coffee Brit (the minority and basically a criminal) I need this for coffee next.
its almost time for pine tree tea
I'm a huge tea lover and I've perfected my technique over several years, my method is quite a lot different than most.
Only 11 tea puns? I'm disappointed gang.
also I know I JUST commented but I, as a British man, have a way of making tea  1: throw water in a kettle and boil it  2: throw the teabag and sugar into a cup 3: put that water into the cup once it’s boiled (wow incredible) 4: add some milk 5: stir 6: halfway through stirring take the teabag out 7: stir again 8: get drunk ( on tea that is )
Hate tea, not even herbal tea. But I do agree with the milk. In hot chocolate, milk/heavy cream alway comes after. Hot milk almost always turn sour unless you do it slowly. I guess pouring it after near the cooler surface is slow and cold enough not to sour and culled the milk.
In the last experiment, you preheated the glass by using it to measure the hot water for the other cups.
3-4 cups a day? I kid you not, I can gladly drink at least 12 cups no problem
Not sure about tradition of milk first? Ive always done tea first and milk after, better ability to judge colour then. Also pyramid tea best tea, PG tips number 1
2000st
British people:every word of what you just said was wrong
Good Eye Might
we need someone *british* sorry but this is funny for no reason
What temperature was the water? How much water did you use?
Us Brits be like: Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power
I actually like the Tannins at the end! So i will continue to squeeze it into the glass! 😏 I also don't have access to a tea kettle! So the only option is the microwave
As a British person who has only ever liked tea with milk going in second, thank you for validating my tea skills
I think this is one of my favorite episodes of food theory! I love tea so much and I’m glad that, for the most part, this is how I make my tea 😁  (I don’t have a tea pot and when I make tea im the only one drinking it so it wouldn’t make sense to use one, and I do add a LOT of sugar cause I like really sweet stuff 😋)
Sun tea next?
Odd that this doesn't mention sugar or honey...
I once tried to make tea and I put the metal tea kettle in the microwave and it lit on fire
Milk in tea? Barbaric!
Not the 3x tea puns
I always get weird looks when I get asked how much milk I want in my tea or on occasion coffee with my reply being just even to cause the chemical change 😆
Just me watching this video and microwaving my green tea.
|i LIVE IN THE UK
as a northern british person i can claim that i have never met someone who has put milk in first. So this must be a southerner thing..
0:56 Hot leaf juice!**
When they were testing the steeping time, their mugs in the AMS order are my exact initials😅
the cooler tea from the pot is only a benefit if you immediately drink it all. Otherwise it's gonne be cold before you can take the next cup
As a person who drinks tea for breakfast all day every day since I was 2 I will enjoy this
Lol everyone in the UK already swapped to milk in second as soon as mugs  stopped cracking. 😛 So about for 100 years or so.
I'm drinking tea while watching this video lol
Why wpuld warming the water in a microwave matter? They say this several times but never test it. Why would how you heat the water matter?
Waiting for Spiffingbrit to enter the chat and declare war.
Still did not show the best cup of tea: sweet iced tea with lemon
I am sorry brits, but you gotta learn from Indians for tea. The way we have mastered it is second to none.
I put marshmallows in my tea today      (I hope that offended you)
So many tea jokes.
First off my comment about doing the merch was right on the money and second off one of the few times I will agree with Matt Pat no milk is good milk tea!
I love this channel I have been watching since the first vedio but this is the closest I have ever been to unsubscribing. I'm sorry
Like iced tea better
No milk no cream no honey no sugar..and the bags stays in until the tea is gone.
What about the sugar?
Squeezing the teabag is mandatory
What's a British doing holding a cup of tea with arms open?  Tea posing
You forgot an important variable, the water
The whole premise of this video is quite flawed because you're assuming that British "tea" is not an atrocity itself.
it's time to spill the tea
It's okay Matt, I agree about the best amount of milk is none.
Finally a GOOD OPINION
But why tho, the difference between adding milk in tea versus adding tea in milk?
Loved the episode, however, I will keep my tea how I make it.  I boil my water in the microwave, except not in a mug, in a glass Pyrex measuring cup. (So I know how much water) I use the microwave because the tap water where I live is really prone to scaling so using a kettle absolutely destroys it from the inside out. I use to boil my water in a kettle, but when I moved here I stopped for that reason.  I use square tea bags because I can't find the kind of tea I drink in any other form and I sweeten my tea with a bit of honey.  I also disregard the usual steeping time because I have a stupid big cup and it takes a long time. I also don't add tea or milk being I'm lactose intolerant and I find that I like the taste without it better.  All in all, I know the way I drink tea is objectively wrong, but I will continue to make and drink it in my wrongness contentedly. Quality video, keep up the awesome content!
1:40 “Royal-tea” was right there. 😞 EDIT: 21:27 WE DID IT! 😆
HOW DARE YOU CALL IT HOT LEAF WATER
So, my method of putting a tea ball stuffed to the brim into a gallon of water and leaving it on the fridge for over 8 hours isn't the right way to make tea? (2 hours for a single cup)
As a British fellow who has always put milk in last, this video did nothing to actually help me, but I do now have evidence that my Grandad putting milk in first is wrong, opposed to just telling him he's wrong which is what I've been doing up until now
I have never heard of putting milk in tea, but I have heard of putting alcohol in tea
love the video but ive never met anybody who puts milk in first everyone puts it in last
Tom is my new favourite character in the TCU (Theorist Cinematic Universe)
Hold up, you put MILK in your TEA???
.. you... wh-why put milk in tea????
I feel MatPat missed out every single person from South Asia: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, with Afghanistan and Bhutan to some extent. Pretty sure my Indian parents would love to know that their tea is s**t. /s
As a British tea enjoyer everyone agrees milk on top in the modern age, hence why the rich always did it, but point is in Britain u will almost never find a person putting milk first (Also tea isn't that enjoyed as widely as you would think, we are just a very loud minority)
I don't know why but I feel like this was aimed at the spiffing brit
Can you do a is daredevil possible?
Still liked the theory even though i don't like tea.
As a Brit, I agree with Matt. Best milk is no milk
I'm watching this when it's been out for only 30 minutes
Matpat, love your channel bro but if there’s a color differences in each tea couldnt you film it on your camera and show us instead of just telling us there’s a difference 😢
I tried a few of the tea that you made it was well it was something
but.... but I love my tea :(
0:30 only 3 or 4 pathetic
Yeah
As a Brit, I have always put milk on top. It’s a big debate because it’s so even spread. Such as how you pronounce scone or whether is a bap, roll or cob
I love teeeeeeaaaaaaa😀😀😀😀
I don't drink tea but as a British person this video aggravates me to my very soul A) You put the tea into the cup and then pour water onto so the water moves the leaves around more. B) Loose leaf is better if you pour the water onto the tea like you are suposed to they move around the most and there for release more flavour. C)...the other things are forgivable but this is not. No one, I repeat NO ONE puts milk in first it might have been traditional for the poor years and years ago but trust me no one does that anymore. I do love you MatPat but I think you need a larger sample size in Britain.
3-4 cups a day? Thats rookie numbers steph. Rookie numbers. Get to the double digits queen
Am I early?
Don't forget, the theorists now owe us a summer variant with sweet tea and the pefect batch.
I drink English Breakfast Tea everyday lol
can anyone explain why you shouldn't boil water in the microwave?
I'm British and I don't know a single person who puts milk on the bottom
Matpat you forgot Yorkshire tea
YOU RUININ TEA! ON A CHEWSDAY?
tea isnt british
I'm so uncultured that I just learned today that you are supposed to add milk to tea
But when life gives you lore, you make a theory! A GAM- FOOD THEORY!
I solved the problem Tea is best...               Without milk
I'm British and I have always put the milk second
I agree with matpat. Milk doesn't belong in tea
My Favourite theory channel
I didn't even watch the video yet but the of this video made me wanna drink alot of tea immediately
Good to see Tom in non-fnaf video 👏🏻  But I'm kinda confused, if you put milk in your tea, doesn't it mean that the product is now should be called as milktea? 🤔
I’m very surprised on why are you guys did an experiment with different types of milk? That would’ve been one of my variables.
Anybody else enjoys suckling on the tea bag when they're done or is that just me?
I'd argue the standard way in the UK is water then milk now
Wait you forgot something what to put first a cube of sugar or the tea itself or the bag before the water
I’m more of a Jasmine man myself. 🫖
I tweeted the idea for this episode over a year ago and I'll just imagine they saw it and take full credit,
One little thing you didn't check was cold milk vs warm milk vs hot milk.
Those tea cups are NOT identical.  They have different letters on them!
I never thought I'd see the day where Matpat nerds out about bri-ish tea for 21 minutes and 31 seconds.
No intro?
I don't drink warm normal tea like other people, I drink cold sweet tea. That's the kind of tea I like, not the warm stuff that most people prefer, or at least most people I've heard about. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just saying, I like my tea cold and sweet.
Do you more British food theory I want to see more of Tom
Incorrect not wrong.
4 comments down and I see a bot. This sucks. Youtube do something.
Excuse me what
Yikes MatPat, is your hand okay? I know what it feels like but not over that large of an area. Be careful next time, I should also take my own advice but I’ll still give it to you. 😅
I haven't even watched the video yet and I'm so attacked.
Tetley tea bags are the best tho
So is it blasphemy to make tea in the coffee maker?
tbh as a brit i dont know anyone who doesnt add milk on top
What a thumbnail
uk:     what
Sugar: am I a joke to you
I hate that I was making tea during this and I was making it so wrong
My favorite, salad water.
Right what's all this then
i drink 3 cups of tea a day as well... neat
personally as a brit, i pour my milk on top so actually we are right and youre wrong
The brits should know what they’re doing with tea. You don’t go to war as the largest cartel in history for subpar tea.
MORE OMEGAMART PLS MORE OMEGAMART PLS MORE OMEGAMART PLS MORE OMEGAMART PLS MORE OMEGAMART PLS
Mhm, tea is tea
As a Brit you forgot the most important factor, the water where you live.   At my house Yorkshire tea is best, at my Mother's house PG Tips is best.
I love your cheesy puns so much they make me laugh all the time 😂
Where's The Spiffing Brit reference?
Ask anyone in Texas, and they will let you know... The best way to make tea is with a buttload of ice and sugar... (hold the milk)
2:19 you look high on methmtea
When ever there is some thing mat pat is theorying
So happy that my opinion is the right way people who put milk bottom are very strange
Catpat for the win
To me, a Chinese person, milk intea is either go big or go home. Make it a tea flavored milk drink or make it proper tea. None of that "splash of milk" bs that only worsens/weakens the taste of both components  Edit: MAT YOU ARE SO CORRECT!
20:47 i swear that's what we do
They should've done another test with microwaved water. Does it really make a difference?
You should make more British food and test test it with him
East inda trading company here i come
6:25 Fun fact, that "pyramidal" shape is colloquially known as a "humbug", or in scientifically; a Tetrahedral.  also, from what I've heard the temperature of the water can have some impact on the quality of the brew, but I couldn't tell you anything specific....
Huh. I never added milk to my tea. I typically use a boat load of honey and mostly because tea tastes like hot water. Even the fruity ones like pomegranate. We also have an "insta-hot". Basically scalding hot water straight from the tap. Gonna try this tomorrow morning.
I don't even make tea and that tik tok outraged me. Like, so much milk and you're close to overflowing the cup!
*RUUULE BRITANI-* 💀soz am bri-ish  and people have different tea preference my mum likes a lot of milk in it and my dad likes enough to make it look orange (which is barely any)
These kitchen episodes with Stephanie, simply hit differently. Love the content guys!
The British are being represented in fooooood theory and as a Brit I approve this tea
Leaving after the 4th tea pun 😕
The true tea lovers are Indians, from 3 teas a day to 7 teas a day, you'll find them all
Sorry I Brew my tea in the milk or not put milk at all
In Turkey, we don't use milk.
We can all guess who what game theory is up on the shopping block this week it has been another crack at Final Fantasy 7 I mean you can't make all these gym jokes without making a cloud
23 hours and 35 mins till this is 24 hours or 1 day old

As a South African person Rooibos tea is a daily thing to drink and it is delicious
But what about sugar!?
4:03 Sri Lanka just choked on tea
I love how they're not trying this with coffee because they would literally get murdered.
ngl i dont put milk in my tea at all i thought ywas wieard
What about type of milk?
NERD
As a brit we learn this by accident by existing
A perfect cup of tea. All of Britain just got triggered! 😂
Im sorry but the leaf water comment got me hahaha
Does you calling tea warm leaf water have anything to do with jackcepticeye calling coffee dirty bean water
I Love This chanel, I always laugh If thers a pun because puns are the best. But I also learned so much I learn a lot about the world and human body, and obviously about food and drinks keep up the good work madpat Because you’re teaching us every day.❤❤❤❤❤
I am british and I put milk in after, because that is the true way
As a Southerner who grew up drinking sweet tea, this wont affect me I hope
12:42...am i dumb? why was 240ml divided by 5 instead of 4? it said "1/4 cup milk", not 1/5....im so confused
Should try some nice indian masala tea too.
No milk in tea thats an abomination
I guess I've been making tea wrong
Uncle Iroh would be proud
1. #mahsa_amini 2. iranians are the people how drink tea the most cuz they drink at least 11 MUGs of tea in a day
861
as A brit:  I am yet to come across someone who  does milk First. Due to modern mugs. Milk on top is the best, how I was taught as well
Do a food theory on why MSG tastes good
American tea is all milk and super, and no tea, what is up with that
try hunny in tea
Watch your tracks Matpat, I can hear the Spiffing Brit over in the horizon.
How dare you :)
💀No British person in there right mind puts the milk in first where are you getting this info💀
This is making me think of the ‘myth munchers’ series on mythical kitchen. You got a shoutout at mythicon during a podcast and you should definitely see about a colab with mythical kitchen since you’ve been on gmm
'three or four cups a day.'  Me:  ROOKIE. NUMBERS.
1:41 Missed opportunity to say she’s royal-tea
well then
I can tell you put a lot of time into your episodes and I really like ur videos! Keep up ur work it is really “working” for you!
But Matpat, tannins are the best part of tea. The correct way to brew tea is with a pot letting the leaves stay in the drink.
shouldn't the type of milk as count as a factor?
Ello
“Warm leaf water”   Yes,now i want Warm leaf water  Edit: i got me some warm leaf water with honey U-U
Okay I do it again, i comment before i read the video, no I am not doing tea wrong, I make it super hot so all the healthy stuff gets into the water and then i wait till its cold, then i drink it and my stomach feels better, I think I know how to do... oh wait *blocks his weeb brother before posting this* I think I know how to do fucking tea... okay lets see how much I just embaressed myself and how much I am doing completely wrong which I obviously do.
Wow
I'm from the uk and have a lot of experience with tea but this is on another level of disgusting                                                                                                                                 jk
26ml of milk to how much water?
This episode was certainly my cup of tea.
I also go through 2-4 cups of tea 😭
You cannot make a proper cup of tea without a teapot and loose leaf tea. or Builders tea boil your water put in the cup drop in a tea bag PG or Tetley and wait at least 2 mins splash in some milk quick stir with a spoon flick the bag in the bin an serve done
here is an interesting idea tea brewed in a French press with eggnog
I'm from Northern England and I've never heard of anyone putting milk in first. It's ALWAYS boiling water first
Well now I want to try tea.
Aww. Watching Skip drinking his water out of the avocado sporting pot makes me miss him reeking havoc on GTLIVE.
I often feel I am a bad British person cus I don't fit the stereotype of a tea drinking royal lover. I really hate tea. I hate the taste of it. It's disgusting and rank and just nope. But I don't like coffee either. Again just nope.
AY IM BRI'ISH
0:55 hidden text might be wrong with the letters, i can only do so much. :X2VPI(or 1)_89(or U)AL_ _ _ i put _ for each letter/number i couldent see
Nahh you need loose leaf for the best builders tea - strong but milky (not as milky as tiktok tea dw!)
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?!
You will wake up with a completely exposed liver and stomach
Wtf I just drank some tea which is not what I usually do I usually drink Coca Cola am I getting stalked??!!
as a British preason im glad to find out that ive been making tea the best way the whole time
matt. choose your words wisely. us brits have nothing to lose without tea.
I steep for 30s on the clock
Tea lore 👍
My favorite type of tea is TEAquila
I'm honestly shocked at the pyramid bag bit...I'll have to keep an eye out for those
the reason the teapot was cooler was because you didn't preheat it
British army coming after mat
16:41 Except you implicitly acknowledged that the upper classes would add milk to their tea rather than the other way around. Checkmate.  17:55 You may not worry about the plate, but it’s been proven time and time again to have all sorts of effects such as perceived satiety and portion control.  19:30 The glass cup tea was the hottest because of its insulating double-wall, not because of its material. Repeat it with a single-wall glass cup and you’ll find that it quickly loses heat as well.
The punsss im calling the police
Second
Spiffing Brit gonna be mad.
Do people drink tea with honey or sugar?
Now we have a theory on TEA of all things? What's next? A theory on the correct way to eat a grain of rice?
Wait Stef only drinken 4 cups of tea every day. Did you ever see a turkish famely whe drink 8 cups of tea every day (man i love turkish tea)
All tea is bad, I don’t like any tea 👹👹👹
EARLY SQUAD
Our government also sucks too
Just finished the vid
Matpat can you do a don't starve /don't starve together lore/time lime on game theory. there is a lot of lore on YouTube
Best way is putting tea bag in the mug then hot boiling water then milk and remove the bag as soon as preferred strength is achieved and remove the bag by smashing it against the side of the mug
density my friends. the denser liquid goes in last. this allows it to mix better.
Next video: making tea in a dishwasher
Steph is just like me. I drink 3 to 4 tall cups of hot tea a day. Whether it’s summer or winter it’s always hot tea. Straight no milk or sugar.
Good to know Mat is a Tea Purist like me
Possible Christmas Theory: what is the cost of all the damages done in the National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation? Would the bonus he receives cover it? So much stuff gets broken in that movie. I feel like it would be a fun theory.
Are you sleeping well, mat?
Mmm yes tea
Zero milk please, THANK YOU!
So I am British and don’t like tea but it’s still my culture and I won’t let you Americans ruin it 😂😂😅
Is there a difference between a stovetop kettle and an electric kettle?
When the news about the American making a monster in a cup an article spelt Britains like britons
I think this might be my favorite video on this channel. The dynamic of Mat, Steph, and Tom is hilarious!
No comment about how the FDA actually put out a warning about heating water in the microwave due to the danger of superheating & burns???
I never put milk into my tea
I'm british
Watermelon
*BRI'ISH*
I have to ask this: to make a tea, you have to pour milk in it? I guess I've lived my whole life in the wrong way.
Hmmm this is a preety   teariffic episod hmmhmhm 🤵🤵🤵
i like tea in bamboo cups more than tea in porcelain cups
Steph and I have a lot in common, including drinking lots of tea and a love for puns lol
It hides now. As He is preparing to make his next move. A silent war between the two halves. Each yearning for control. It has the truth but He entertains.
What makes me laugh is that they say that the uk needs to change the way of doing it but we already did, literally every tea ive ever drank had the milk second not first.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STIR THE TEA
You should try Pittsburgh 🍵 it's called Turner's best tea in Pittsburgh
I can't agree more  best milk is no milk
PEOPLE PUT MILK IN THEIR TEA????
Watches theory about our national drink, thinks about showing tea-aholic mum to see reaction. Might need a victorian couch to catch her when she faints.  Joking aside I was making dear mama's tea when I was 10, and her way was very stirct. Boil the kettle, put boiling water into empty tea pot. Refill kettle and Reboil said kettle, before the kettle boiled empty out tea pot put in 1 tsp of tea per person and 1tsp for the pot,  (max at 3 tsp more than that and you'll have a stong concoction that will have the wrath of every ancestor apone you, i would know)  Put in boiling water and steep for 5 mins, should be 3 mins but i was a rebel that didnt listen to her but she likes 5min tea now so mwahaha. Milk before tea (her prefernce) if you add sugar you will suffer. Nowadays if i 'volunteer' to maker her tea then i make a pot of coffee for myself and my Dad.   Look after 18 years of 'proper tea making' i will only drink tea if i have to, gimme coffee!
Mathew you are not alone I am with you in that opinion that tea should be just a soup of rehydrated tea leaf without milk
even tho tea usually isn't my cup of tea, this still was interesting
British 100%
For the milk argument, I would say it depends on the tea variety. Some teas I personally believe are better without milk while some are better with milk. I can’t quite point to exactly what is the reason, but some teas just taste much better without milk.
This is why Food Theory should be run by a British person.
TRIPLE BOTS WHAT THE FU-
I dont think ive ever met a brit including myself who puts milk on the bottom
Bro in my part of China we just dump the leafs in the water
Me watching attentively even though I've never drink tea in my life and don't want to
Awesome! Now do one for Japanese teas, please!
I can’t take anyone serious who uses teabags, lose tea leaves only.
Now do the same experiment with coffee
milk or honey is a no go for my mom, cream is the way to go
Best milk is indeed no milk
Food theory idea can you power a tv with lemons
R2-D2 mug
When Dr. pepper theory

Tea just chilling on the counter: also matpat: I should make a VIDEO ABOUT THIS but it’s none of my business.
cold tea is better
Milk in tea? Man idk that just feels wrong
😢😮❤😂

Anyone remembers when Tom Scott said he didn't like tea?
Wouldn't traditional tea come from Asian countries, since they had tea way before Europe?
Mocking laughter in sweet tea
All the British people banging on the soundproof glass trying to tell the woman not to put it in the Microwave.
amazing thumbnail
Hi
Ill save you the hassle. Best way to make tea, boil the kettle, pour a little bit of boiled water in the coup, pour that water out put you BARRYS teabag in and put boiled water, stir while also using spoon to mash it against the edge and take the bag out, finally add milk if you want.
Have to agree with Mat. Best milk is no milk.
Mat pat has never seen a British dishwasher before lol
People put milk in their tea?!?!
I saw that viral video of microwaveable tea and it irritated me extremely, but that was ages ago
this made me want to make tea. Got my ginger turmeric triangle tea bag and put it in my ingenuiTEA container with the strainer at the bottom. poured in boiling water, waited 5 minutes and drained it over a cup with milk and sugar in it. delicious.
Matt : "your tea sucks"  British people : so you've chosen death
Awesome and cool! ^^
I don't put milk I use honey. It taste better
i used to exclusivly buy arazona sweet tea... then i found pure leaf sweet tea... i dont drink any other types of tea anymore.
Hi I'm British, and you have chosen death
You're not a married couple until you make passive aggressive comments about how to properly load the dishwasher
I'm living for the tea puns in this episode!
Iroh: This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice! Zuko: Uncle...that's what ALL tea is. Iroh: How can one of my own family say something so horrible?
The earl grey I make now seems cursed. I steep it in a metal pot (after heating water) for 20 minutes, wait to coold off almost to room temperature, and chill it in the fridge 👀
I'm not kidding, my grandma drinks 15-20 cups a day.
they warm it up in the microwave cuz they dont have kattles right? or atleast most dont have kattles is what i heard
“you could say that she is queen tea”  sure yeah but  what about  *royaltea*
Uh oh I just had tea
I drink way to much tea as well, but i got into tea half a year ago and i thought putting milk in tea was an American thing because coffee(btw i don't like milk in my tea)
Them: 25 ml is the perfect amount of milk!  Me: *uses 50% milk 50% water* perfect!
Yorkshire Gooooooooold
Four cups a day wow I can make so many jokes about the fact that I really outpace your wife in Cups of Tea but also what size are her cups maybe the problem is she's not optimizing how big her cup should be I mean I go through five cups of the big huge giant goat versions. Although then I went back to water. But seriously there's a simple solution to solve your dishwasher problem get her a bigger teacup put your very merge to the extreme by getting the 20 gallon thermos! That's all if I can go through 1 L of Tea every hour I think you can at least get her a 20 gallon cup or at least a 10 gallon you get hats in them.
Nah but it’s still  •tea bag •boiled water •thennnnn milk
made it
so about the 3:53 with the pinky. and with that have a new video idea: how did that came to be? (not a serious question on my part since i know the answer, but was curious about it before knowing the answer) what kind of quirks gave us history in the realm of meals & simiular and for what reason?
Uncle Iroh would love this episode
Definitely can agree with Matt on this one, all of the tea I drink is entirely without milk, though I definitly do love me some milk in my tea as well once in a while
My winter drink of choice is Theraflu tea. Me actually drinking it, when this video popped up.
“Not my business”  *proceeds to make a whole video about it*
NO ONE in Britain puts the milk in first for like the last hundred years, anyone who says they do is just trying to flex being British to get camera time. The only reason it ever went in first was because in the 18/19th century you have those dainty, fine china cups that would stain more easily or be damaged by heat so the milk went in first to protect the chinaware, if Tom's telling you thats the 'British' way he's just trying to show off being British in America and impress dumb Americans. What Stephanie describes at 17:00 IS the REAL British way and Tom's faking in order to try and use being British as an excuse to get face time on a video.
Me thinking a russian man will start ww3 Meanwhile matpat starts ww3 after making tea
I’m English and I would like to say it’s non of your business how we make tea
HOW DO U GUYS COME UP WITH THIS STUFF?
I only just now got the notification for this Edit: sorry for messing up the 666 comments
I love tea. Always preferred it over coffee even if they all fall under the umbrella of coco in the drink spectrum. Can't say I don't like milk in my tea as something about about creaminess doesn't fit my pallet for teas and it is just that I tend to get the bathroom runs more the more milk I add to tea. This is coming form a person who has a very high lactose tolerance.  Edit:why was there no test for microwaved water VS electric boiler VS kettle VS pot boiled water?
OMG THE SUBTLE PEEPACHU IN THE BACKGROUND- 3:46
I love tea ^^ I drink it almost everyday but .. Pouring milk in tea is something I can't get used to.. can we just appreciate the tea as it is without anything ruining it 😅
Food Theory:  Your tea sucks, but that's none of my business.  Me:  Evidently it is, because you deadicated a video to something that you claim isn't your business but you make it your business by bringing it up.  🤣
Queen LaTEAfah ☕️
Wow that tiktok tea video was painful
The video was super.
Pre video meeting: Can we steal a catch phrase from another channel? 8:58 Super Easy Barely An Inconvenience
3-4 cups is a lot?? Um, try going to England 😂
The absolute distress on Tom's face at the milk bit in that viral video. I can't. 😂
Gong fu style tea brewing remains king
you and your wife are too cute
Matt's right! No milk in the tea! :D
8BitRyan should react to this
Never before have I been so offended by something I 100% agree with
Matpat takes normal, everyday experiences, over thinks every detail, and leaves us loyal theorists with information that will mainly be used to annoy non-theorists with seemingly unimportant facts about seeming unimportant things. 👌
"Your tea sucks." Top 10 ways to trigger any British person ever.
Herd brewmuni-tea
its milk first only if its from a teapot, if your brewing in the cup then milk last.
I like fruity stuff like jam more than herbal tea
Squeezing the teabag after is the only option
What I do is add cold tap water to cool it down. So in stead of adding extra milk and making ur tea milky u can still Cool it down.       So u add hot water, tea bag ,take tea bag out add milk and then a drop of cold water
Wait your supposed to put milk in tea?
Matpat spills the tea, on tea.
Am I the only one that mircowaved the water with the tea bag. Also I never added milk but instead coffee creamer.
The only way to make tea is  1. Boil water 2.put teabag in cup (Yorkshire preferably) 3.add sugar (if wanted I would say do do it) 4. Pour boiled water into cup/mug 5. Stir water 6. Add milk 7. Stir again  8. Squeeze teabag at the side of cup/mug 9. Remove teabag 10. Stir one last time  11. Take to living room  12. Drink while watching tv 13. If wanted eat with biscuit  14. Repeat process
GOOD OL’ BRITONS
Man I love tea
I always want to see where the thought process for the food theory videos. Like they are the strangest yet funnest videos of the theorist videos.
Microwave tea
IM 631ST YEAHS YEASH THIS IS GREAT
she shouldnt be drinking so much tea, it has caffeine in it. it also stains the teeth.
Your tea still sucks, it's British. Pu' er tea is the best tea, check out Jesse's Teahouse on youtube. Calling teabags the best tea is like saying soda is the most caffeinated drink. Have the base requirement, but it's still blatantly wrong.
Am I the only one who drinks exclusively teavana fruity tea? Cause I hate tea but I know it's supposed to be healthy so I drink the tea that's basically juice and then add so much honey that it becomes basically just honey tea
English guys be going mad
love you
It’s me. My dishwasher is indeed filled with cups because of my intense tea drinking habits. Steph, you are not alone.
Current last for less than a second most likely
Wait 3-4 cups of tea per day is a lot for Americans?
This showed up while i was making tea.   Perfect
I do love my tea
The flag in the thumbnail says mayday... Nice 😅
Hey there's this Spotify show called matoat theory videos using your videos
I didn't know people put milk in tea....I never add anything to mine. So....heeeeey
Current last
Tea for the people
I don’t know what the Brit’s did to you, Matt, but it must’ve been harsh.
Do a theory for the Sony Spider-Man universe most specifically the mid credit of venom 2 and morbius plus the future of the franchise
Does he check the comments
As a brit i have a legal obligation to say that tiktok tea looks worse than death
0:56 I believe it’s pronounced “hot leaf juice” thank you very much
Does the average American even have a kettle
I love that matpat use the Kermit the frog drinking tea for the thumbnail 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's just puns lol
I drink about half gallon of  homemade sweet tea alone every day
Hello everybody
This is stephanie’s dream episode😂
BIG mood with filling the dishwasher with mugs!!!! (Also, any excuse to use the phrase "big mood" 🙂 )
Can confirm, I was the tea...
Fellow tea drinker, it’s Time to rise and free our fellow tea drinker, Stephen from these bad tea puns
I'm British and I put boiled water with a tea bag. Then milk. Then stir and then add sugar and that's the best
Tik Tok tea isn't even milk tea, it's tea infused milk.
Tea isn't food, unsubbed.
oh come on! if you want real tea. go to japan and perform theyre tea preperation ceremony, now that is tea!!!!

Haven't watched jet, but as someone who drinks a lot of tea I already feel triggered.
"How much milk should you add to your tea?"  Me:  None.  None at all.  Not a drop.  Do not adulterate.  No touchy.  *shudder*  I mean, at least you used Taylors, which tells me Steph must have been the one to choose it.  That was a good choice.
how to make tea 1. put tea bag in the cup  2. pour small amount of milk 3. boil the kettle 4. pour the kettle to the cup 5. swish the tea bag with a spoon 6. remove tea bag 7, drink the tea
Meanwhile, we here in South America Experiencing California weather x∞
Tea is the best
But hey, that’s just a TEAry. A FOOD TEARY!
I can tell from all the puns that this video will be very high qualitea.
As a Brit, I feel like this video is cultural appropriation.
your mom
Sake.....you forgot sake
10 minutes yooooooo and a other video  noice  1 hour ago
Too… many… puns…
Matthew: "Your tea sucks-" Me:
Matpat: Your tea sucks… But that’s none of my business.   Me laughing as I don’t drink tea: Sure it definitely sucks.
IMO, everyone's perfect cup of tea will be unique to them. There is no *ONE* perfect cup of tea.
Tea is overrated
😂
3-4 cups a day? Those are rookie numbers, we need to pump them up.
I’m a Brit how dare you disrespect our tea how dare you say that how dare you
0:56 "Warm leaf water"  Steph: "How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?"
i'm just saying but the brand teapigs makes the best tea
Hi
Well this all sounds like a terrific way to really mess with the Heart of Gold in a very important moment
You Made my fav drink more confusing than everything else
yay 10 mins so earlyy
As an American, I love me a good cup of sweet tea.
You can upload 20 minute long vids but I cant upload a 9 minute long vid.
You need to add subtitles 😭😭
Matpat is basically declaring war in the british
As a man who loves his tea and is a Brit. I need this episode!
He is speaking the true American language🏈🇺🇸🇺🇸🗽🇺🇸🇺🇸🏈
every British man is watching this video.
No the only tea that is acceptable in the UK is Yorkshire tea
Wlecmoe to food thoery
i drink no joke 10+ cups of tea daily
Nobody's watch the full video the is crazy 🤪!!
It's the best way for me if it's the most efficient way to brew gallons of country sweet tea.
AUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Hmmmm  leave broth
bullshit
Matpat: not my business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Proceeds to make a whole video on it
That viral video was faked for views
MAT PAT!!!! HIIMMARYMARY IS BACK!!!! PLZ FINISH THE THEORY!!!!!

15:45 matpats excitement and bounces are super adorable 🥺🥺
Hi mat love your videos!!!
I have no idea what this video is
Feels weird being this early 🤣
Well, Spiffing Brit is gonna dislike the tea choice, he's very specific with his brand of Yorkshire Tea.
why am I here I don't like tea
yo that dish washer comment was nah 🤣
6:39 these mugs are identical *proceeds to show mugs with different letters*
The best tea is yeo’s chrysanthemum iced tea in a packet purely because of nostalgia bc it’s the drink you always have when I go to my grandmother’s place (she has traditional Chinese tea but as a kid I hated it)
This is how I make my tea 1. Put water in a kettle 2. Put teabags in. 3. Put on stove to warm. 4. When ready pour tea in cup 5. Put a little amount of milk and 2 spoons of sugar. 6. Give a little stir. Enjoy.  Edit. This is what we call “Chai”
Could you do one for coffee and well. The best  home made coffee
*bri’ish mode engaged*
I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m joining the Brittish and other tea lovers to fight MatPat in the name of tea
-Inserts VLDL's Milky Tea
Or just drink coffee
Poor steph just got ahand full of tea from a knee jerk reaction
well American beer sucks
hii love the vids
I'm sorry.. 3-4 cups of tea is a lot?  Clearly have never met Spiff lmao
7 minutes!!!!
hi
Mine is flavored water
He should have called this episode Food TEAeory! I'll walk myself out
vat
Please stop with the TEA jokes.
Fun fact: arabs drink more tea
Ive never been so invested in a theory before
Kermit the frog here to say lemonade is kind of delicious
“3-4 cups a day”   *Laughs in British* rookie numbers
0:14 I don't let Mother Nature dictate what I can or can't have.  If it's the middle of a snowstorm, and I happen to be craving ice-cream, I'll eat ice-cream.  If it's the middle of a heatwave, and I'm craving a hot drink, I'll assume that I must be having a stroke because I don't like hot drinks.
*sees thumbnail* Oh no mat pat How are you still not cancelled

I love tea so I can't wait to see what crazy theory this is!
Hello internet welcome to tea theory
at 2:19 matpat looks so depressed-  and what about diffrent TYPES of milk? like almond or dare i even say chocolate.
im with picard on this one. earl grey it is. all day every day.  And im with Matpat on this one. No Milk is best milk. if i want to drink milk...guess what... i drink bloody milk. but when i wanna drink tea...i drink tea and not milk.
As a brit that tea makes me wanna throw up
“Invest-tea-gation”   That’s a good one ngl  (All the other “tea” jokes are really good to in my opinion)
I love the title
EVEN MY 6 YEAR OLD NEPHEW THOUGHT THAT HOW THEY PREPARED TEA  WAS STUPID-
Your tea SUCKS... But that's just a theory!
This is the first time i've heard of putting milk in tea
Behind the scenes steph has matpat at gunpoint in the recording closet.
Oh I love Tom! Glad to see him on this channel
Thank you matrick patrick.. now i want tea...
