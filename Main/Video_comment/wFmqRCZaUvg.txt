You can say whatever you want about colby, but that guy can TALK. He is also a great wrestler but talking is his number one thing xD Hopefully he comes back for the title.
Colby's the GOAT
Coming back here Usman was right this whole time, Colby does respect Usman.
CANT BELIEVE THIS CARD IS OVER ALREADY
Colby's the best even though he lost
That’s what they all say chandler, that’s what everyone wants to do, most of them who flaunt at the idea of becoming champ get their asses handed to em. Hashtag gaethje
Looking forward to Usman woopimg Cuntington's ass. Can't wait to see Zhang Weili redeem herself against Rose's Big head ass.
"Coming from the great state of the 305 of miami."
Oh how I wanna be in Thug Roses position. Looking back at recent accomplishments with a whole heart
more Colby please
Stay on your bike Rose,  Weili looks a little tired, you might need to help her get some sleep. 😉
Chandler and Gaethje two of my favorite fighters
Colby, while in the car: "What's driving me is revenge.."  Colby's driver: "Am I a joke to you?"
Thug rose was so hot when she was on TUF with long hair omg  😍
“Trumps everything hes done” “no pun intended”
Yoooo
Colby Cringe Covington
They ain't paying rose enough money.
i had no clue will ferrell was chandlers coach
People like to say Usman "faked" an eye poke in the first fight but those same people don't acknowledge that Colby was the one who actually tried to claim an eye poke at the end of the 3rd round after taking a shot straight to the jaw.
Lands in New Jersey .. Colby “we in NYC baby!!”
That pso rite shirt or whatever it’s called is awful LMAO looks like a sports bra on your chest brother
4:01 Jon jones spotted in the background.
Usman displaying true class, showing respect for Colby even though he's been saying a lot of crazy things
Rose seeing a chiropractor about that TV height?
who the fuck said chandler vs geathje is the peoples main event what is this guy talking about
Michael Chandler doesn't deserve another title shot. Justin Gaethje doesn't deserve it either. Whoever wins in December 2021 must fight vs Islam Makhachev to defend his title.
The Trevor trio is a fuckin powerhouse in its own right. Already seeing myself lose my voice
My god, when Chandler learns a new word, he just doesn’t let off. Every single interview. This time it’s “beneficiary”, but shouldn’t it be “beneficiaries” because it’s plural!? Jeez chandler…He’s not here to for a long time, he’s here for an annoying time…..
Colby is so good….he makes me hate him almost as soon as he opens his mouth. Its quite impressive.
Kamaru looks like a bug
Rose is the best ufc champion
It took way too long to get to Colby. He’s the people’s Champ! 👊🏻💥👊🏻
His coach looks like a girl with those braids.
Colby would never show Usman respect , Because Colby has NO class , Colby needs to be HUMBLE.....His PRIDE will and always will be his downfall. PRIDE always comes b4 the FALL.......God Bless you Usman and your Family.
What a card
Justin is really the best with his fans. My boy has a picture with him he got at the usman and Masvidal fight. He said he was extremely humble.
No disrespect but how do I have a nicer living room than thug rose? Dana needs to pay them more
I specialize in the Gender ID field. ALL of the women in MMA UFC are really men 💯
46 and “feelin it?” C’mon coach, then you might just be the one doing something wrong!
7:48 too jazzy?
All on Trevors Wittmans corner will loose ...
I think Pat Barry is my favorite human being on earth
For those of you dense enough to actually believe Colby's antics, Colby is a great guy but the UFC thought he was too boring and threated to cut him so he had to create this heel character to sell fights. He's awesome and I hope he beats disrespectful Usman thinking he's better than GSP
Rose 🌹 is so beautiful 😍 and such a bada$$
110521
7:25 how can you have your TV up so high? My eyes and neck would hurt wtf
Man I'm telling you guys if Corey Sandhagen goes to Onx with Trevor Wittman. He will become a champion.
chandler said the first round vs oliveira was 10-8 him?? yeah he won the round but def not a  10-8
Justin is just so real man idk how anyone can hate on him speaks his mind and then he fights like a warrior gives it his all everytime and is just so damn good!!!!
Gaethjes interaction with that fan was a good thing to see!
Damn Trevor Wittman sure knows how to pick em hey. Crazy how any fighter that’s works with him has their stand up game gain levels crazy fast , especially the boxing aspect of it.
Justin and Kamaru both loose Saturday and everyone gonna cry
Chandler is sparring in a hat? What a weirdo lol
Let's go Justin. I don't think anyone is beating charles though.
Love Usmans attitude
Go Usman. Best of luck
Love him or hate him colby can fight, his character is goofy though
Have to say Usmans style is next too none. McGregor-esc. 👔🔥
05:49 When the beat dropped in the Rose's UFC montage and Pat Barry started bopping his head lmaoooooooo
That’s all the air time Colby got?? 🙄👎🏻
Usman is about to smash and expose Colby again. Then Colby will cry and complain he wants another match.
4c1c1424
4x14x44xx
22221x4x
That kickie footie technique on the speed bag, from Justin was so creative.
42441
222424
How can Justin AND Michael win? They’re both great.
GL bro <3
I ain’t sayin shit but the way pat gets pumped for rose at 5:53 it just melts my gosh dam dark ass heart. I love it
It's sad how rose is a UFC champion but still live in a small ass house💔
Usman is a good dude. Love Colby too!
Colby + Joe Rogan + me are cool
Imagine stopping connor for a picture while he's jogging, he would sucker punch you, then his security team would block out the sun so nobody could see or photograph you getting assulted.
How embarrassing that Usman’s dad is trash.
I think Chandler is going to hold himself to the first round knock prediction and get it done early! I think Justin is coming in with a little bit of a disadvantage.. a) Being out for a year  b) Being dominated by Khabib changes people..  but anything past 2 rounds I think Justin takes the W I thing Weili gets a finish. I think Usman wins by finish or decision.
I like Chandler, but he didn't get caught.  DoBronx just displayed  how much 'in octagon' experience he has when Chandler only has 'in cage' experience.   the difference is monumental when you think of this here MMA as a whole.
Pat Berry and Rose look like such a beautiful couple! I wish the UFC would do a deep dive on what brought them together and how they met, so cute
Yall just made that fans day! lol
colby pandering to racist idiots. He knows what symbols to use, and what words to say. Doesn’t take much to fool the fools… 😑
Kayla, this ones for the birthday boy! Get out for a sec yea?
This SUCKS. I like all of these guys (and gals) fighting. They all have my respect. It’s hard to pick who I want. Whoever wins - we win - I love it.
yay more repeat footage. LAME!!
someone get a child to show these dopes how to make a 10 min freaking video!!!
“Up in NYC” airport says New Jersey lol
Ready too rise the roof with "THUG🌹🌹Z"...🥲
Looks like hes in the booth about to drop a verse
Geathge bout to sleep this dude.
Even Though Colby puts a great show in the press conference i think he is so down to earth.
Colby carries this entire card on his back by himself.
Soon as Coby goes in front of the media he is colourful suits and brings political prop, but in that car he had bust down everthang 🤣
"i love you, but you dress like a fucking dickhead" -kenny powers if he met usman
I swear Rose is being held hostage by Pat Barry lmao
Colby will win....
Thumbnail got Colby looking like he the hardest out right now 🔥
Chandler looking forward to the title shot when he still has Justin to get through....
I dont hate Chandler, he seems like a nice guy, but i just dont think he has what it takes to be a champ
Michael Chandler looks fast because he has very short levers. It is enough that the opponent reaches out his arm and puts a hand on his head and with his fists we will see him catch flies.
I like that Kamaru “Trumps” bit, lol.
Michael Chandler has his heart too close to his asshole. And it's not his fault that he was born a dwarf.
How is Justin's ground game so bad with Usman in his camp?
Elevation training works against you
Why does Zhang get a rematch?
How could you not love Gaethje!!!
Michael chandler doesn’t have a chin, they only path to victory is his wrestling because if it’s a straight stand up his getting ko’d in round one.
Waltz right in and fought for the title .  Olivier waited 10 years.  Habib waited forever
OMG ITS HILARIOUS DOES ANYONE REMEMBER OSMAN BEGGING COLBY TO FIGHT HIM FOR YEARS!!!! AND COLBY WAS DUCKING HIM!!!! ITS HILARIOUS!!!!
Please  calm down sir mr Chandler Namajunas  and usman is main event you are so nooot there yet. Maybe you opponent are but you are a nothing
To see the level of respect Justin has for his fans really speaks a lot about his character. Nobody should be scared to approach someone they Genuinely look up to and I thank Justin for that
Corny Covington smh. His trash talk was good before. Now it’s just....trash. Hopefully his skills improved. I still wanna see his face get cracked again tho. Let’s go Usman!!
Covington is an absolute unit. But, Kamaru is a different animal, and big boy. Hyped. This card is everything.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🥀🥀🌹🌹🌹🌹🥀🥀🥀
Hate when fighters say “I was winning until I got caught.” YOU LOST. Other guy was the better fighter that night plain n simple
That’s so awesome for Kayla an Miguel I’m happy for them, also Justin Gathje is awesome to his fans one of the best
U can tell by the Rose watched the promo, she knows it was a fluke win...
Justin's such a nice guy talkin with that fan
I have known since their first fight that Usman respects Colby since he is the only one who makes Usman laugh 😁
Colby is the wish version of chael sonen
For the first time Rose looks kinda buff
Bro Colby said Miami was a state😭
Welie gets a 2nd chance to retain her title and Stipe is where again?
Zhang is a brute, cave woman, hence if cannot sneak something violent in then she will be ah a handful for anyone to handle imho, incl Rose. But Rose is so sneak and technically sound, beautiful to watch her fight so cannot help but to hope she show up in form and confidence of her life.  I understand Zhang's excuses last time was for Chine people and the pressure on her in unbelievable, problematic for sure and the Chinese are so collectively proud and determined views on themselves in relation to the rest of us, so I get that... But still excuses so yeah hope Rose somehow can repeat exact same ko, same time frame and location in the Octagon, cause any excuse would be too bad even for the Chinese and I cannot stand excuses, downgrading towards the superior woman that night imho.  I may lean right more so than left, traditional at very least and no radical changes before we actually have time to understand the actions down the line. But hey, still hope Usman shut him up a little bit lol, either way Usman is on another planet imo so money on him.
I did rehabilitation in Deerfield beach.... I hurt my nose...
Colby went from righty trump supporter to 2 chains real quick…
Classic
Man, even Colby's trash talk is boring
I wanna see Colby become champ from his hard work but man, I’m kind of expecting it to go like Usman’s second fight with masvidal. Wanted to outright beat him the first time and this next one is a statement. I’m expecting him to stand and trade with Colby.
2:30 :"I realy love it when you use this motion with your hips"... Okay arkward.
Chandler sure talks the talk. Now he just needs to walk the walk.
Man I get it, Colby is only where he is because of the persona..( yes I know he can fight like a motherfucker) but facts are facts, he was going to be cut from the UFC and his persona saved him. So yeh I get it, but it’s soooo fucking cringe to watch !!!!
Chandler vs McGregor would be great cus the later probably thinks he can win and Chandler will humiliate him. Can’t see that guy coming back to UFC
Ok... Kamarus pants tho.
New York City, the city that never sleeps but hopefully they make an exception because I'll put him to sleep. Damn thats a great quote
I’m a big Colby fan so I’m hoping he gets a fair refereed fight and is able to put his pace to use. Usman is a good fighter but I think Colby is a tad bit better. But that’s why they fight to find out who’s the better man that night!
I wonder if Gaethje loses, rose loses, what would be going thru Marty's head entering the octogon
Since when did stevo become a coach for Michael Chandler?
Imagine if Woodley actually acted like Usman, people may have actually liked him.
I like Usman but I like Colby also-Usman is a better sport about things and how you should act toward your opponent after the fight,Colby is a little bit more high strung,lol..In my heart its Colby but my mind tells me Usman if I had to put money down-Sorry Colby-Usman is a beast and a very,very talented one at that.
Coby try's to hard to act cool 😂😂 he's a 🤡
wait: coby flew on a g-5 but they picked him up on a bus? I smell fake news
Colby might be the Josue Vargas version of the UFC. Watch out Saturday night, we will find out
Chandler has false dreams
How many times is donkey boy going to use that line? "They say the city never sleeps but I'm putting Marty to sleep blah blah"
always bet on all of Trevor's students and smile on your way to the bank.
They say NYC never sleeps but hopefully they make an exception cause I’m putting Marty to sleep-Colby double C Covidington
1:45 is that someone's Trans Gran hitting pads?
islam will be the champ 2022
Ima believer! Lets go Brandon!
Don't trip I will. Don't need your permission to do that.
I love UFC!
I thought Rose was lesbian
Here is my Predication: Usman, Rose, Gaethje all win
Trevor Wittman will be a curse, mark my words! All 3 of his fighters are going to lose
What kind of shoes is justin gaethje wearing ???
Kamaru has finally found his way with his words, he has always been sooo good inside the cage but now with the last few fights in his bag the way he finished all his best opponents he has gained that confidence and it shows.
Colby still talks shit .. Haha .. Anyways.  Good card on this one .. Wont missed it .
Rose is hideous now
why none of these vlogs have Weili in it?
Em bedddd edddd 😝🥳 fuckin fight weeks boys.    Picks..  COLBY ROSE CHANDLER VERA BURGOS
Greets from Virgin and nerd(Colby voice)
I wouldn’t interupt a UFC fighter training or exercising to take a picture, just out of respect.
I'd like to see Colby win for what could be the UFCs greatest trilogy
5:45 can anyone please tell me where can i find this promo
Just wait until khamzat comes.
Fj
I want Colby to win!!!!! Marty loves juice!!!!
Theirs nothing I hate more on fight week than the sound of an embedded episode ending
UFC ALL STAR EXTRAVAGANZA! 🤯 🔥⚡🔥⚡🔥⚡🔥
When I saw the thumbnail, I thought it was a white guy making a rap video and then realized it’s promotion for Colby’s fight lmao
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
What's up with the aspect ratio?
I feel bad for Colby being stuck in that cringe gimmick of his . He’s talented got amazing cardio . He should drop The act.
Rose 🌹 living life like a college freshman with that house decor..  let's go champ
Lets go, Colby!!
You heard it here first! Chandler attempts to kick Gaethje and gets KOd
I hope Rose wins again UFC clearly trying to get a chinese champ in Zhang.  They wanna break into that market.    LFG ROSE!
I love ufc embedded gives u a look at fighters before showtime!
I am 26-0 picking last 26 title fights. Reply TONY to get my 3 picks for this weekend. You won’t regret it
What did I learn from this?There was only two fighters in this that you can see are truly humble,the rest are selfish d**ks,acting like they're fighting for humanity or something ughh.Rose and Justin seem like good people.
Usman makes bank and he shops at thrift store idk how I feel about that 🤣🤣
Does anybody knows what designer of those boxing shoes Trevor Whitman is putting on?
how the hell does Chandler get Will Ferrel on the pads?
More Ian garry
Usman is a McGregor wannabe
i think winner of gaethje v chandler gets title shot, loser fight islam, and then when islam beats them he gets his title fight
Man if Chandler thinks he's going to implement those leg kicks against Justin and think he won't welcome leg kick for leg kick he's going to break first
Chaos 2.0 is coming this Saturday baby!!
Nice hat lol.
The Trevor Wittman Card
Oh hell, I like this version of Kamaru. The sincere and straightforward attitude without trying to be rare or a strange persona, make me appreciate him as a complete fighter even more. Kick arse Sir!
ive said it b4 and now again, chandler will Never be champion.
colby covington 🎆🎆🎆
i'm not watching any of these witchcraft previews but my guess is colby loses on saturday before the african also loses in another 7 months to the middle eastern guy . i personally don't care who wins but i'll be rooting for colby when i watch the fight.
whelp, looks like gaethje will get the first ufc handstand ko.
2:30 kinda sus tho
What did Colbys jumper say that they had to blur
Usman should dress like this instead of a damn bum at pressers
Kamaru even dressing like Colby for this fight huh
Coby going from a G5 private jet to the free hotel shuttle bus is hilarious!!
Colby: "comin from the great State of Miami"
Whittman: "He's (Colby) the mentally-toughest fighter at 170 outside of Kamaru" ...  *Laughs in Khamzat*
Minute 3:34  CU: What's up bro JG: what's up... CU: Sup! r__r JG: Wassup... r__r  Hahahaha hilarious
karmara has terrible taste in clothes , he needs connor mcgregor help
Rose I don’t want a long drawn out thing I want you to end her like you did last time
Greetings 🤓&😇
Marty looking like a damn clown in that suit.
Usman is probably the nicest champion ever unless you're talking smack to him but he is super respectful it's been a amazing journey for usman he will perform Saturday he will ko Colby Covington in a bad way
who is the chandlers braid guy
Colby, rose, and chandler win mark my words
Stripped for not fighting Colby?? Hilarious
cool meeting with Gaethje
Literally nobody is called Chandler's fight the people's main event.
I think Kamaru is starting to realize he’s not good at talking shit, and that he doesn’t have to. At this point you can’t argue with his resume.
Khabib vs Whitman for Coach of the Year
Rose lives a pretty humble life style..
I'm glad we have a champ like usman so kind and humble and yet a fuckin monster
I don't think Kamaru can get knocked out. Not even being a dick the dudes head looks like a cinderblock. He looks like a light heavyweight lmao. If anyone can get it done Colby can. This is going to be sick! Colby has vengeance bro he's been wanting this since the bell rung at the end of their first fight
There are a lot of people who would be annoyed when that couple followed Justin for a picture during his exhausting workout. Good on him to not only engage but do so in a genuine and nice way. I may be a Chandler fan but Justin gets nothing but respect from me. P.s no hate to the couple they were obviously just excited to see him
How many times you see fighters getting fitted for suits before McGregor?
Notice how cringe the whole Embedded got when Colby showed up
Covington is so cringe, does his act actually work?
Damn someone go in an decorate Rose's house!  She needs some major upgrades LOL
Justin the type of guy to beat the type of guy.
Ima be honest I bet Kamaru is truly surprised how tough Colby is because I didn’t think he’d last a round wit kamaru lol
Trevor and Khabib, coaches of the year
Your running on the wrong side of the road
How can you not like Usman:         Colby “I’m going to kill you in the cage and drop a nuclear bomb on Nigeria.”                                                   Usman “I know Colby respects me, he just puts on a persona for the world.”
Man give Trevor some xanax on Nov 6 with all his pressure
it's nice to see fan's saying thank you and good luck  after picture
colbys a whole snitch 🤡
Let’s go Rose Thug!
rose loses, chandler wins on points cuz he wrestles the whole fight, and marty knocks out colby in round 2
Never seen such an evenly matched card. All these big 3 could go either way 👊
Usman looks calm while Coby is anxious and that's easy to know who wins. The calm one wins.
I hope chandler wins
I'm very excite
lol rose saying Zhang thinks she's the best even though rose has the belt? didn't she just get it back after her getting slammed on her head???
Skipping through the CC parts. No one but incels are interested in that guy outside of the octagon.
This is why I like ufc so much.
Colby "Vanilla Ice" Covington
Let’s go usman
Never thought I’d say this but…. I Hope Colby wins
If Trevor gets a clean flush he is hands down coach of the year!
Chimaev is coming for Usman man I cannot wait for that fight
Michael chandler is gonna knock that bum out
You got to give it to Colby, he really does believe his own BS 🤣
For MMA fans this 2021 Christmas came in November
Thanks YouTube for the “did you know men could have multiple orgasms” ad while at work
3:44 Justin " El Cucuy" Gaethje
I don’t care about these journeymen  Show me Makhachev vs Oliveira and Khamzat vs Usman
How all y’all loosing and keep expecting a title shot 😂😂😂
Colby only has 4 KO's that proves he can't punch and with wrestling Usman has 100% takedown defense and is the bigger and stronger man on the ground. Usman can take a punch (better chin) there is nothing that Colby can do with him. Sad stuff when there is Black man between you and your dreams and he already pounded you out.
I understand accepting losing is tough but Colby has every excuse in the world as to why he lost! I highly doubt the UFC ever entertained the idea of stripping Usman because he “didn’t want to fight” a guy he already stopped! Should be a good fight though
Trevor, Khabib’s father GOAT
“In the first fight I was just fighting, now I have balance on my feet” that is the stupidest think i’ve ever heard. maybe if he said he was fighting to emotional it would make more sense, but that quote was dumb af.
Colby's gonna get trumped by Usman again.
Painfully corny
Colby v Usman 2 ganna be boring asf both ganna take time an wrestle
Usman size is too much for Colby I think. and Whitman knows it. If Colby had 15 More pounds on him he would be unstoppable
Champ Covington 2.0
I love that Kamaru gets Colby’s schtick, even he knows its just funny
Islam will beat everyone.
none is talking about 4:24
red rocks colorado. U2 played there and produced their seminal album from that gig. This weekend is going tobe sick. Unfortunately I think Usman has went to different level. Colby is he only one out there who has the tools to win,just cant see it happening though
No way chandler deserves a title fight right after this one if he wins
Someone tell Chandler he's 2 more wins away from a title shot lol, guy just walked over to UFC lost in a title fight and thinks he is going to run in back with 1 win over justin? Aww thats cute.
Rose ❤️❤️❤️
Go usman, rose,gaethje im a huge fan from Oregon
This card is going to be insane. Gaethje vs Chandler and Rose vs Zhang are going to be absolute wars.
Better watch your girl around Justin man. You look like a couch potato and she probably hasn't seen passion from you in years. Now you put her next to a professional athlete.... you taking a chance man.
Conor wasn’t lying a few years ago when he said “they all wanna dress like me” ever since he came onto the scene everyone now wants to wear tailored suits
No one's saying Gaethje vs Chandler as people's main event. Smh we are excited about colby vs usman 2.
Fake usman ... Yawn ... fake caller ya boring give up belt u cheat!!!
Great card
What hap
I see Colby Covington, I click.
Kamaru is an awesome guy
I don't see Zhang weili here
Nothing like an Embedded episode after a hard workout
Where’s zhang?
Let's go Weili!
Man this card is giving me goosebumps
Lets go Colby and NEW!!!
I cringe whenever Colby speaks. I feel like it takes so much effort to keep acting like a dbag this whole time but he’s too far in to stop.  😂
Let me get it from the back 🤔
Bro Colby is gonna come in and wrestle
Naw Rose, I don't want to see a drawn out fight. The less you get hurt the better!! Lets do a repeat baby!!
My money off Colby
THIS WEEKEND IS GOING TO BE EPIC!!!
Fake news man got himself some ugly threads
Bro Iron Mike is a little high saying “a lot of people have been saying our fight is ‘the people’s fight’” bruh nobody has said that
Usman winning for that pun alone
That interaction with his fan. Justin is hard not to love man.
Eat the leaves and the grass people
THE ROSE 🌹 is the best UFC figther female and male best striker most technical watching she make fighting look like art. May GOD keep her safe & give her a win to remember 🙏
Why is he wearing a cap in training lol. Tool.
Colby is the best
Kamaru's dress sense is terrible.
Covington is greatest bitch, usman kamaru is best champion
That was badass of Justin to take that video with dude
"I REALLY LOVE WHEN YOUR USING THIS MOTION WITH YOUR HIPS" my wife says the same thing
I love Colby covington cuz of the trash talk but i know 100% he’s going to lose if not then its going to be a draw
Colby is going to come out to Vanilla Ice song LOL
Thug Rose 🌹 All DAY
Chandler saying his fight is the "peoples main event" is fucking delusional.  Real fans want to watch Rose v Zhang 2 and Colby v Usman 2 more.  No doubt Chandlers fight will be a banger, but this card is set up exactly how it should be honestly.  Usman and Covington might be another fight of the year contender, we'll see!
The only time Colby has to enjoy his moment is pre-fight post fight he’s going to look for an excuse.
SHOUTOUT TO THE BEST TAILOR IN DENVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY GETTING SOME RECOGNITION!!!!!
Colby covington in the thumbnail looks like he's shooting a rap video that's promoted by WorldstarHipHop lmao
If Colby was confident he wouldn't have said "hopefully". Bro is gonna get smeshed.
what if Wittman's team loses all 3 fights??
Damn. Rose and (Pat) Barry, When are you going to marry? It feels like Pat's been "fiance" for about as long as Embedded has been running. "Thug Rooossseee!" - Cormier 🌹🌹🌹
0:30 sup Michael, this is us on earth, come back here boi, the main event is Usman smashing Covington since he gained a lot of confidence since their last fight, Colby is so dead, and he doesn't even know it
I want a shoutout
Colby the kinda guy to land in Jersey and say, here we are in NYC! 😂
Usman is a respectable champion who acknowledges his opponents’ strengths. George St. Pierre was the same way.   Some new fans in this era that have fragile little egos get uncomfortable with that because it’s the way confident men act. Or they just expect cheap WWE bullshit.
Chandler can leave the ufc now thanks.
Colby vs Juiceman is the peoples main event. Fuck outta here
Good card and 💎✋ AMC
is anyone going to tell Michael Chandler that he's not going to beat Justin Gaethje?
Rose punching the air seeing Petr win
Fuck this card is stacked stacked. Best lineup prolly ever
Rose looks like a small siamese twin attached to big Barry
Camaro Usman
Usman shopping for suits 59.99 for 3.
justin adn kamaru faceing off calling "whats up". back and forth is hilarious
Arms raised  Covington Zhang Gaethje
If he's gone disrespect u disrespect him back Kamaru
Nah Chandler Usman Covington fasho the people’s main lmaoo
Zhang!!!!
Very beautiful scenery, desirable to go
Great state of Miami?? 😂
Here for CHAOS!!!!!!!!!!! Go Colby...
Justin is the fucking man
COLBY FOR PRES
Colby got fake chains 😂😂
I need Rose's giant bean bag chair
Come on Gaethje...mess up dana's plans to give chandler another title shot.
Anybody know the video/trailer rose is watching on her tv?
Rose and her opponent 💯🔥💪🏻 Micheal Chandelier 💯🔥😎, Gaethje sucks and Colby vs Usman isn’t worth watching regardless what happens or not happen.
Michael Chandler. I love him, serious and respectable man, but Justin will smoke him… Sorry
LETS GO COLBY 🇺🇸
I’m so nervous for Rose vs Zhang 😭
remember when pat barry was almost 30 and groomed a 16 year old rose? but he's so funny and quirky right? gives him a pass? hypocrites. the posts about her being 18 are pr posts trying to hide it but there are multiple interviews from the two where dates are given and they add up to her being 16. they said it freely back then and now try to hide it. dont support that fucking creep preying on a mentally ill person (she's said she is multiple times so im not making that up either. all facts direct from their mouths). dont delete my comment again, ufc.
Justin has become such an unlikable  fighter.  Such a whiner 🤨
Usman and still!!!
Co-Mainmain
Here is my prediction of these epic fights: Chandler wins by TKO. Rose wins by unanimous decision. Colby wins by unanimous decision.
War Colby!

Rose ducking Esparza. But i don't care. I love her regardless.
Michael Chandler stand up needs to stand up
i wonder what colby's chain was they blurred it :[
Dana, pls pay these guys. They entertained with their lives on the line. Boxers are getting  all the bags, yet most people won't miss these ufc cards for canelo v plants.
Colby is getting slept like street Jesus
1500 feet sounds like nothing....people should train in Ecuador! 13,000 feet to 15,000 feet above sea level. Its no joke!
fake Marty
Some people never change.  MCGREGOR,  COLBY SAME SAME.   Usman said he respects him and he' says that crap.
Chandler climbed to the top In one fight: UFC is a joke
Rose looks like a small siamese twin attached to big Barry
Chandler vs Gajie I can't wait someone is going out so hard to pick its like chaos vs controlled violence lets gooooooo !!!
KUKU IS GOING TO OBLITERATE CONVINGTON HE AINT READY BRO KUKU GOT DIFFERENT HANDS NOW.
I hate how people call close fights robberies
2:30 “That’s what she said!” 😜😄😂😂
I think the rose fight is gonna be a brutal one lot of blood
Kyoji Horiguchi will win the bantamweight two-group championship on December 4th.
Why Colby’s fit looks kinda clean😂 got the ice on and all
Colby says NYC. But he's in NJ 💀. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T SAY "MADSION SQUARE DO IT."
bruh not even gon lie… i love colby’s trash talk! dude funny asl
Pat and Rose's relationship just seems so fucking weird
He comes from sea level can someone explain for me
Usman ko Colby he has wrong attitude for a start
whats wrong with usmans head? dude looks like a klingon.
Sick that he still got a photo with the fan even after that HUGE run. Real down to earth guy
Insane to think this great amazing fight card with great fighters in it not getting nowhere near the 10 million dollars weak ass sorry ass Caleb plant is getting at the same time this card is going on
Can’t stand Michael “Salesman” Chandler. Wish he’d just STFU.
Kimura Usman, Soviet Namajunas, Dustin Gaethje, it is Trevor Whittman's UFC event 😂
Usman by TKO, hes a just whole different animal but Colby won't go down without a fight
Trevor Wittman for Coach of the Decade. Definitely Hall of Famer
yeah, after those pants selfies, go Colby.
Malibu’s Most Wanted Vibes from Colby 😂😂😂
Gaethje will flat line michael chanler
no Michael Chandler, you do not have kicks. You have wrestling and overhand right
Colby bout to get that Strap!
Chandler 10-8’d Oliveira?!?!  Dude is buggin
No pun intended lol yes
Colby and Usman are actually both enjoyable to watch these days. I got no dog in this fight.
lmao no one talking about Usman wanting a picture of his ass on 8:20?  Makes me love the guy even more.  Haha
Trevor should take cory under his wing, if anybody can light that fire  in cory its trevor!
*5:50** song?*
LOL skip to 3:40 for that magic
Michael "conceive , believe, achieve " chandler
🌪 chaos
I don’t know why Zhang gets an immediate rematch?
Colby immediately shows up cringe af lmao
Team Colorado let's Go win or lose And Still double Champs 🤙🤙🤙
1M views in 1 day!
Rose looks like a small siamese twin attached to big Barry
who is that dork in the cage with the ponytail (nate diaz 2016)
Usman is awesome
Usman by ko
2:30 ... wow trevor
Concentrate on gaethje bro💯dont look pass him
Gaethje really is the best man🥺
How does Colby Cringe's last line make sense...?
lol, Colby is so lame 😂 He’s trying so hard to be something he’s not.
Sick fights this weekend. I just wish the canelo fight wasn’t also on. Hopefully they put a halt to that fight; until usman finishes Covington.
i like Rose as a person but when she mixed mma with politics just f0ck
Trevor Wittman is a hell of a coach to train Rose Justin and Osman it's going to be a hell of a fight on Saturday night
Wow usman kind of dresses like a lesson teacher iykyk
I'm going to play a nice 'Usman' Ugh, that's not kamaru.
Kamaru Usman win!!!!
I do wonder if Usman is doing the opposite of what Colby wants. Colby does better when he dislikes the person. If Usman is being cool it might throw Colby off.
Kumaru and Colby are both good dudes. Kumaru just opens up easier. Colby is balls deep in the act but fair fucks to him, he wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that.
The great state of the 305 Miami huh….. regular Rhodes scholar this Covington I see
All this for them to lose to Islam  and Khamzat in 2022😂😂
Those chains on Colby 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so fkn funny clown ass. I like how Dana hates him so he like let’s give him a 15 sec clip at the end lmfao
Why is Rose's TV so high up? My neck just hurts watching them.
Rose must lose. She is super fake.
All three of Trevor Whitmans fighters on the same card? Somebody's not getting the training and attention they need for their fight
DRAGON ENERGY
3:24 PAUSE
3:37 was that serious?
For the record Chandler won the 1st round against Oliveira 10-9 not 10-8. I don't know where he's getting that BS from
Covington is a typical Trump supporter: delusional, pathological liar, inadequate, and envious of the very people who him claims to hate.
Michael Chandler is CORNYYYY
Iam rooting for colby. But after watching this, iam a fan of usman. Well spoken, truly professional. And if he wins, ill tip my hat. And sleep well knowing the belt is in good hands
the winner will fight islam after that talk about the title
Michael Chandler talks soooo much
Justin trying to speed bag with his feet😂😂😂 dude seems pretty cool.
colby lookin like a rapper who fell off 2 years ago but wants to show he still has money 🤦🏽‍♂️
Winner of Justin/chandler should fight Islam
If Charles knocked your ass out. Justin is definitely going to knock you out. Just sayin 🤷
Colby is bringing some fun and hype to this card!
Chris Pontius holding mitts for Chandler 🔥
colby is done after this beating 🤣🤣
Just waiting for Usman's barber to make an appearance for those tight fading skillz
I really respect Chandler as a person but even if he beats Gaethje (unlikely IMO) he's not deserving of getting his second title shot in a year.  If that happens it will be so disappointing from a fan's point of view.  Dariush and Makhachev are both more deserving.   Chandler needs to beat Gaethje this weekend and follow that up with maybe a win against the loser of Oliverira vs Poirier to get to that #1 contender spot.
ONX is just straight up a fan favorite gym. What legends, fighters to the coach.
Usman is a great champ
1:24 being the champ in the ufc doesn’t really make you the p4p best in the world technically, does it?
I'm not bashing, but Rose's place looks my apartment in college with my roommates. How much less are female fighters getting paid? Maybe she's just saving that money.
Trevor is the best mma couch in the world
Kamaru is showing a lot of respect for Colby to be honest. He KNOWS that Colby is the real deal when it comes to a contender. He could just be like everyone else and throw shade on Colby and kick the guy everyone hates but he actually stands up for the respect he believes in. That definitely means something.
Justin n Chandler. Gonna be a fuckin BARN BURNER 🔥!!
Let’s Go Kamaru!!
Pat barry committed a crime
Just something about Chandler seems like he’s a little boy. Especially compared to Justin. Let’s see what he’s got against a real hardass. Let’s go!!!
Also rose is an inspiration to me, quiet one but always showcases her skills on the embedded but also in the ring. Doesn’t need to trash talk just needs the day of the fight, come on thug Rose bring it back again 🤪
Rose looks like a small siamese twin attached to big Barry
Best Card of the year
Rose and Pat look dirty asf
I felt the cringe  @8:36
Usman already fought twice this year both for title shots and now to Colby I have no doubt he will win against Colby either by Knockout or submission.
Sure colby they were going to strip the most active fighter in the division
No gonna lie if the fight goes to distant Rose is going to lose
The ufc is on fire with these views
Rose looks like Jack from Mass Effect
I think it’s dope to hear Kamaru show Respect where it’s due. Colby is NO JOKE. I hope someday Colby drops the character and show Kamaru the Respect he is Due as well. The Rivalry is awesome, but two amazing athletes showing Respect after is nice to see.
Thanks for putting Colby at the end.  It made it easier to skip him!
Come on Colby chaos Covington you can do it!!!!
Co main e main
See i really like the realness in this. If all these Colby haters can’t understand that even Usman sees past colbys persona and respects him as a fighter then there’s no reason some of this audience shouldn’t. Colbys a great fighter and people try to discredit that just because they don’t like his gimmick
Honestly thinking about it, don’t know if Chandler can beat Poirier but I have a feeling he could actually beat Islam if no one else can. Kind of a rock opera scissors thing, that’d be awesome if the belt keeps changing hands, we’d get some banger fights
Good to see colby back
This card is going to be insane. Gaethje vs Chandler and Rose vs Zhang are going to be absolute wars.
Let's go!
I'm praying for Namajunas, that she's good as she always been... And for Justin, you are  not going for Himalayan marathon, so don't take it easy being in high elevation.. Oh great man!! I called him great and humble human. Hey Covi, get ready for another hard time... Don't mind, that's what it's gonna be!! See ya
Pat berry is probably close to the corniest person in mma. Also feel like he beats and manipulates rose.
I like Weilie Zhang a lot... but can you imagine if Rose just starches her again? lol
Dam I thought Colby was about to start rapping at the end there
G5 😆😆😆😆😆 1 trip and he is broke stop mate your literally  done for
If chandler wins he definitely doesn’t deserve another title shot if he beats Islam yes 👍
That last clip is giving me stretcher flashbacks
Even though usman has never been the best trash talker or anything like that, he’s a purebred fighter and I like seeing his defence and his rise. Didn’t take too long to get noticed but he’s a sure p4p number 1 and will deffo go down as one of the greatest. He’s a beast and made of granite
My only Concern for Khamaru is those bunions Daýyyyyyum!
"Can you see me now??" - Usman's Hairline
chandler cannot and should not have 2 title fights in 4 ufc fights! evem tho im.a fan its not right.
Justin is going to destroy Michael
Rose looks like a small siamese twin attached to big Barry
2:30 Thats what she said.
Kudos to Gaethje for taking a moment to make a fan's day after a tough training session like that. That's cool.
episode was great... until colby showed up. i just can't stand that fake character cartonish a**hole. hope he gets knock the f**k out again. go usman! hold that belt until khamzat gets a shot at it!
we clicked this video for colby
Damn colby and usman are actually elite level mma fighters, so excited to see them fight again!
Thank you Dana  for Nov.6 !!!!!!!!
I'm guessing we won't see anything about trump from Colby this time. Gotta give him props on that
I FUCKING LOVE CHANDLER!!! Mans hella well spoken and is a tANKKK
Chandler is awesome for the sport and a very likeable person. I just don't see him beating Justin though💪👍👊
I love how the fakest guy on the roster gives him the nickname of fake news Marty come on bro look in the mirror
Double unskippable ads? 😒 cancer
Who guna be the groomsman at Barry & Rose's wedding? Cuz Barry doing all the grooming
Doesn't matter what they do. The Russians are coming, as was displayed last week they are in another league.
Rose needs to grow out her hair again lol
Lol the main event is definitely the peoples main event didn't even know Chandler  was on this card lmao also he isn't even the draw for his fight its Gaethje dude is full of himself
I want to give Rose my horn
1st time Usman being likeable
Damn how calm does Usman look. And his words.. you can tell he’s in a great place
Even if Chandler wins, 3 fights/1 loss in ufc and he gets his 2nd title shot? Dana White privilege.
No Weili coverage?! Hope the episode will have some.
The city that never sleeps is Vegas bro lol
TV too high
Shit, I just looked up from eating my food and thought WTF is Megan Anderson doing there, striking away with her top off? 1:30
I just want Rose to get ktfo
3:47 That's some Tony Ferguson shit 😂
2:41 haha it's so true colby pretends to be the bad guy even usman knows that.
Drop episode 2 already.
I like Mike Chandler, but bruh, Usman vs Colby 2 is FOR SURE the real maim event and peoples main event
Chandler/ Justin, I think either of these guys beat Olivera, Chandler just had bad luck in their first encounter.
Seeing Wittman, Gaethje and Usman together having a laugh is just so genuine.  Sup brah? - Sup? Sup? - Sup? < Proceeds to work on that speedbag...with his legs >
I need more philosophical Chandler
I don’t know why people chose to dislike Usman.. it is competition he is supposed to be confident of his ability. With that being said he is just mire calm here
After a couple of years…i think we can ditch that fasade, colby 🥴
Usman has gotten so much better since the last time he fought Colby but that guys a fucking tank it’s gonna be a good fight
Kamaru has to be faultless for this fight. If he is off by 1 degree,Colby will be the new champ.
Thug rose 🌹
Colby thinks he's the Mayweather of mma. He can fight but too much excuses. On Nov 6 usman go make sure there's no time to complain. Colby go get put on a stretcher
Chandler is Def NOT the " Peoples Main Event" lol Chandler would Never beat Dustin Poirier..
I love Colby Covington❤❤❤
Why on earth did Wei get a rematch when she was flatlined so quickly by Rose? Let me guess, Dana wants his precious Chinese Market to grow? Ridiculous.
I love all the fighters competing but I hope it's a 3-0 shutout for Trevor Whitman.
Michael vs Justin is not the peoples main event, I haven’t heard anyone say that except for you Michael. The main event and the co main event are the main events of this card and those are the ones I’m most excited to see. This is not Khamzat Chimaev, you are not THAT exciting..
I have all of Wittman's warriors to win this weekend. So excited for this card. LETS GO!!!
Kamaru will loss Chandler will win
CHAOS🔥
The mindset of Colby is Allll off and wrong. Cant wait to see him lose again.
Colby you in Jersey not NYC
I want Oliveira to keep the belt for some more years.
Colby looking an Eminem Stan
Colby, you  scary delusional!! Hiw is Usman sacred  of you  when he BEAT your  ass smiling.  come on..don't  be acting  crazy.  granted, you  brought  it to Usman I fine style...But he BEAT you smiling
Trevor only trains a small number of fighters but next Saturday all of then are fighting in the same card. Not even henri who is in a big gym has so Many fighters in the same card.
Usman has come on so well
Was Usman’s real name “Marty” in college?
Champ Usman! That has a Great ring to it  I'll keep saying it Champ Usman!
Trevor is what we say Credit Card Team ma man will be Cornering Justin Rose and Usman
can you imagine if Colby wins and becomes the champ?! holy shit that'll be crazy. just for that, LET'S GO COLBY
Colby is the best
Want to see Chandler get eaten alive by Islam if he wins. No title
why do people prefer to look up at the tv...
Yeah mike I don’t see you getting the title shot after getting knocked out 1 fight ago
It will be interesting to see the new version of colby and usman both have different coaches since their first fight. I expect colby to attempt a  few takedowns and usman to throw more combos.
Colby needs to defy the odds and cardio his way to victory against the CEO of EPO who's also incredibly skilled. Good luck to both and let's go Brandon!
8:30 and on you can skip it. You'll thank me. Hahaha fooking clown!
colby vs usman 2 thers on time to blink
Colby lands in teterboro nj Colby: we just landed in nyc
Wittman:"Your great to your fans" Justin whispers to wittman: yeah only coz embedded is here.. They could kiss my hole otherwise"
Got to say usman has deff earned that respect
The limited edition character Sea Level Chandler is unlocked by Gaethje
What does Rose spend all her Winnings on.. The state of her gaff.
That bitch Colby funny😂
This may be the card of the year. I love Chandler, but I’m not seeing his Visio of him beating Poirier. But this fight will be amazing, and I would love to see him win and get a title shot
Best card of the year?
All these genuine great people then it ends with Colby jack
Usman win by Colby
I hope Colby wins
Damn i havent recovered from last week and UFC spoiling US ITS FIGHT WEEEK
Michael Chandler before the fight :  "This is a fan favourite fight, we are gonna put the show"  Michael Chandler after he gets hit by  Gaethje " Ohhh, I m a wrestler"
Going for Chandler on this one
usman gonna beat yo azz again .
Then islam will take it from you
You can feel the energy, 🔥 3:33
And newwwwwww
Lol says the guy who got his face broken last time
Whitman is corner for 3 final fights of sat.. so crazy
Love him or hate him Colby is a character 🤣🤣
Tbh cmon Michael... ur not the "peoples main"... we just wanna see you get out in ur place.  You and olives were gifted that title fight.. let's be real
since I have conscious Pat Barry is Rose's fiance...
Back to back ppv‘s with absolutely stacked cards we are being blessed right now
Colbyyyyyy
Damn let’s go Colby
i think he's gonna prove us all wrong
Yessir. A good Lil run at red rocks will do ya good
Gaetjhe got some deadly donkey kicks to the throat boii!!!🤯🤯
Did he just say he beat oliveira 10-8
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
8:30
i always imagined these fighters livein mansions and drowning in money but it seems like they all have very humble lives. I guess Dana is the guy makes the dough
Lmao imagine the UFC telling usman if you dont fight colby we will just strip you and move on
iight usman the Trumps no pun intended got me. i laughed
I don’t know why Chandler thinks he’ll get the next title shot with one win after losing the title fight
Gaethje’s fan with the smooth handshake save 😂😂💀💀
No one:  Gaethje: lemme rock that speed ball with my feet *yayayayayayayaya*
Every single one of these fights is so incredibly competitive. So much so that an upset really isn’t crazy in either title fight. The gaethje v chandler fight is something we all expect to be stopped early, but really it could go the distance too.  Amazing card all around!!!
GOD BLESS
"Trumps everything he's done, no pun intended" - Kamaru Usman got BARS YOOOOOOOO!!!!
Usman and Justin by KO\stoppage. Zhang vs Rose, despite how it went last time, its a 50/50 imho
mans taking ass pics of umsan
First time when I'm more interested in the woman division fight.
I know this is gonna be a great fight but they are not promoting it enough and they are competing against Canelo this Saturday. Even though I like ufc I think Canelo takes it this Saturday
Love how after the "eye poke" Usman grabs the wrong fuckin eye lol
Colby is a broken man. I can’t imagine being that angry every day. He is a sad Colby.
Come on chandler everybody know's you never deserved a title shot! Beat islam then maybe
Colby should of been fightin Leon Edwards before gettin an automatic rematch but the UFC's rules apply differently to certain fighters apparently.
I really like Usman and I feel he's way better but for some reason I really want colby to win.
Usman is surprisingly becoming very likeable
He may best Justin, Dustin and Charles but nobody is gonna beat Islam. All roads lead and end with Islam.
Usman makes me laugh 😂
Who you got this weekend? not who do you want to win, who do you think will win?  I got Rose, Colby, Justin
If you live in NY, I can get you tickets to the press conference
Colby living in a fantasy world where he thinks Usman is afraid of him. God love him lol
I think Kamaru is in for a rude awakening. His confidence is so high after Masvidal but Masvidal and Covington aren't even on the same plane.
Wow, what a selfish fan; “hi I know you’re in the middle of training and laying on hot asphalt, but, duh, can I have a picture?”
Excited for the jokes after the episode where usman gets a haircut
Was it me missing it or is zhang not even in this ....
Rose has Stockholm syndrome
A picture of Covington and the words Go Puff on the thumbnail?
GET OUT THE WAY COLBY TRAIN COMING THROUGH THE COVINGTON EXPRESS SAYS CHOO CHOO CHOO
Kamaru been unstoppable since he started cycling...
Deep down, I think Colby and Kamaru actually don’t mind each other.  So hyped for this fight ❤️
Usman has no calfs Elevation training only matters if you're fighting at elevation. Rose is going to get hurt. Barry will still be a creep and a below 500 fighter
what a punchline in the end by colby, but respect to marty for obviously  becoming a better person.. i think character is the only thing marty misses and is on his way so gl to both
Chandler vs poirer would be TOOOOO SICK!!!!!!!!!
What’s the font used for titles in this video? Clean af
Gaethie and Usman look the same size...
These modern suits are so ridiculous. They size them 2 sizes too small and the patterns are so flipping ugly. People will laugh at this shit in 5 years.
Love Michael Chandler! Hope he comes up with the Win
UFC- Ultimate Fighting Championship i love watching your YouTube videos I’m a huge fan
More Colby!
09:22 as long as we are not the one’s sleeping you’re good.
I just don't see Colby beating Usman.  Chandler lost when he was given an undeserved opportunity, this time give Islam a title shot. Rose has better fight IQ than Weili anyway Antonina Schevchenko needs to join that division.
3 bloody fights. What a card this is going to be. Usman ain't letting go of the belt easy, same goes for Rose. We are most certainly going to see alot of blood shed.
Funny as hell kamaru with the suit and now Colby got in chains and shit lmfaoooooo this is just a bit weird
Chandler just sounded so cocky in the first clip
That’s pretty gay how Embedded called that fan who got a pic with Justin Gaethje a “Justin Gaethje supporter” lol
The winner of Gaethje v Chandler has to fight Makhachev. Both have already had title shots and just like Charles Oliviera came up and out of nowhere, Makhachev has done the same and should be given an opportunity.
3 fighters from the same gym?
I feel Kamaru will win, he is a experienced champion now, who has been through war so many times, he knows what to expect from Colby, the only thing is fitness, if he can keep his fitness at top level, he has got this, the one to watch out for in that division is Khamzat Chimaev, he is a awkward fighter, and can bring new tools to counter Usman stylistically.
Trevor witman best coach ever
Who the fuck gets sparked ko then say it was gon be a 10-8 round before I got slept
Chandler was born for this fr
Who the fuck losses a match win one then gets a title shot this man is trippin
Colby Covington is the first openly black trump supporter lol dude has no idea whatbhebis
that patt barry dude..something is not right with him
Another 6 episodes of Chandler's life ambitions
Whoever wins this is going to fight Islam and then whoever wins that is going to go for the title, that's how I think it's going to go. Oh and they're going to be fighting Dustin.
I am the best 👍💯
I am lit for this card 😍😍
Colby and Marty both wearing Rolex Day-Dates.
Both gaethje & chandler are no match for Islam.
Shout out to that tailor. I swear mma fighters have the worst bodies for suits; big arms and shoulders but no chest. Built for sport not aesthetics
I think records indicate who’s the best rose has more losses than Weili just saying
Covington got nothing on usman
realistically can Colby beat Usman now? the improvements Kamaru has displayed since their last fight compared to Colby’s is astonishing.
dam i love colby
One day I hope when colby talks he actually makes sense.. listening to guy is just so depressing..  No Colby, no one believes Usman was gna get striped 😒😒
Guys I know usman has one belt with 4 defences but why has he 5 belts at the gyms wall. I thought ufc gives a red rubby for each defence to your current belt. Please if someone knows about the belts tell me
People who think Justin vs chandler should be the main event are fucking delusional. The main event will prove itself Saturday night
Hope they wire Cobe's mouth shut again. The king of excuses.
Jeah Baby jeah soo on 🔥🔥🔥
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A BUSY NIGHT FOR TREVOR WITTMAN.
gaethje just gained a fan in me that was dope.
New ww champ ❣️✌️
Colby always acts like he said something..😆🇺🇸🥊🏅
Colby about to get fully murked this time......this will end like sonnen vs silva because at the end of the day silva finished sonnen twice.
didnt know st pierre was on this card
Colby cringe Lord is back. Good to see he's still a nice guy trying to be a heel.
atleast it’s easy for the crew to grab usman gaethje and rose for the vlogs lmao
If colby beats this version of Kamaru man that would be fucking crazy im actually rooting for him
4:01 that sign   Jeff Navitsky: 👀
I wish Colby would be himself after he gets a win
I think you should train pads with shoes off, kicking and punching feels toty different with shoes on and off look at the Whitman camp.  And Justin take your goddamn shoes off the mats. Drives me crazy.  Kamaru why you wearing the same print as Connors oh wait then he puts the pants on ahahahaha. Put those clothes on for the after party man. You need help with your people Champs status. I wish I could manage half these guys, I did it in the early 2000s but the game was totally different back then.
Marty hahahaha gets me everytime
Like if Usman annoys you
I hope Justin wins but I think Chandler might catch him slip’n. Hope it stays standing. Hope Rose puts that stamp on it & would be funny to see Colby actually win but doubt he has the power to really hurt Usman. Volume is great but power shots win rounds. Just ask Sandhagen.
Kamaru is such a professional, complete and respectful champion. Big fan!
Bro I’ll pay for this card twice. It’s just that good. And you got Canelo vs. Plant as well. It’s gonna be a good ass weekend I’ll say 😌
The "im putting Maru to sleep..." was cringe.
Colby looks like the blue man wit that blue lighting in the bus😂
Anybody keen to see Alex Pereira
Trevor is a negative Nancy
Colby!!!!!!!! Let’s gooooooo
Coby bro you're getting your jaw wired shut again 😒 from Kamar.
Please stop running on the asphalt
Everybody start praying right now that Colby and masvidal will win their next fight so we can get Colby vs masvidal 😵‍💫
He's an empty vessel, Covington that is. He's the loudest in the room. You know what Confucius says about that.
Chandler thought he got 10-8 against Oliveira??? HAHAHAHAHA
Colby goes from wearing shitty suits to wearing fake chains such a troll haha
Nobody is beating Makhachev anyway.
Damn clickbait
Why is Chandler talking about getting a second championship match? He had 1 fight in the UFC then undeservingly got a title shot when others who worked harder were more qualified and deserving. Now he thinks he should get another match after one fight again? The guy is annoying asking for too much too soon. He won 1 round. He couldn't get through more rounds to find out if he'd be better. They both hurt one another. Difference is one guy didn't stop while the other couldn't continue.
I like Gaethje but I’m rooting so hard for Chandler
Rose is scared
Kamaru is the best fighter but just needs to let politics out of his mind. Or apply his wonderful skills to understand fine politics, not the mainsteam soup medias gives us.
If colby pulls this off, that would be craaazzzyy
Rose no 11
Give Colby more time. Hes the one we want to see
Covington must be getting tired of his act he is putting on, I feel bad for him
Man I strongly believes Islam will smash Chandler. Dana White do this fight
Imagine if all Trevor Whitman’s fighters go 0 for 3 😳
Gave Colby like 45 seconds!!???
trevor whitman getting the most screentime in embedded
chandler is so well spoken its almost cringy
Lol man hyping after getting wrecked haha. He's a great enough fighter not to do all this nonsense smh
colby was so happy with his closing line
I really want Justin to take chandlers soul 🔥🔥🔥
Whatever Chanel says to bet on, just do the opposite. 100% win ratio if you do this.
Colby needs to sleep Marty
Chandler gonna get kod
Damn Colby got some drip
Chandler gets slept
I cant wait for the press conference 😂
Colby driven by revenge and anger and Marty been getting smarter and smarter is what's gonna make this a lot shorter this time around. There is nothing in Colby's game that's tricky it's just his volume and he will try to get in Usman's face maybe even wrestle and that will be his downfall.
M
I would enjoy seeing an upset where Colby would win, but I can not see this happening :/ Like Kamaru is a huuuge welterweight. I feel like the difference in power is what favors Usman. But maybe if Colby has enough stamina to go for takedowns and mix it up with his striking, then I can see him coming out on top.
Gotta feel for Colby. He has no people around him 😔😔
Pat Barry is such a creep
Go colby Go colby !🔥
How great is our god rn?
YouTube won't let me say "let's go Brandon".
You don’t get back to back title shots LOL s dumb chandler
How annoying is colbys voice I can't stand listening to the prat there just something about him that makes you absolutely hate the man he's cringy to watch to especially when he's paid the ladies to stand with him in a pool or some pathetic speach he comes up with
wow Usman has the worst taste in clothes. XD
Michael Chandler did not 10-8 Oliveira it was 10-9
Leggo Chandler!
Isn’t Las Vegas the city that never sleeps? Lol
Pat Berry looks like a creepy guy
I think colbys gonna fuck him up. Usman literally cheated the first time around.
How can you not love Justin Gaethje man! Would be great to see him as Champ.
If there r 2 guys that can beat Usman R Colby & Masvidal
Let's GO COLBY whoooooop Usmans ASS!
Micheal chandler talking shit on Oliveira makes me laugh yeah you beat him first round but you got Tko’d 😂😂😂
Why is Kamaru’s tailoring guy so wholesome 😂 I wanna be friends with that guy
2:30 “I really like when you do this motion with your hips” 😏
Bro for some reason I hope rose gets knocked out
Usman is unbelievable but I hope Colby wins just for the utter carnage and meltdown it will cause on the Internet
So no one is gonna talk about how Rose's tv is almost on the fucking ceiling? 5:48
Gaethje is the best. Treats his fans like gold. I'll never pick against him.
Michael chandlers voice crack at 1:33 was funny af
Colby is just like Trump, just air...
I hope Rose comes back out on top, and knocks her out again, but I feel it might want go the distance!!
Usman has the mentality of a champion. Colby is coming with vengeance and so much hate for usman too sad that will cause his downfall again. Gotta respect someone that finished you before.
Fucking hell usman is boring to listen to
"wisdom I acquired, TRUMPS everything he does... No pun intended" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Usman and Colby gotta respect eachother. Usman knows he’s the only challenge
Wittman an absolute MVP
love to hear usman talking about Colby like that
...Trumps everything he does 😎🤣
the best thing colby covington ever had in his Arsenal was the moster that is ATT behind him without that and with those weird nobodies he's with and seeing Usman with whittman its kinda hard to see anything other than the same progression we saw between Masvidal 1 and 2
U should fight with makacev
Any of u blokes know why covington keeps calling usman Marty
I'm gonna parlay on the Whittman squad. Hope Justin doesn't get too reckless.
Is it possible not to like Gaethje…
I m not interested in this fight after watching khamzats performance
Think Chandler is ready for these Gaethje leg kicks? Haha. Gonna be some fight. Explosive power all over the card. 🔥🔥🔥
Usman's a bum and he only fights lightweights
Next title shot.... Islam!!!!!
The whole vibe really tooke a turn when Colby showed up
Fake gangster from the hood
Dang Gaetjhe took some time to have a chat with the fans really is awesome, in the middle of training too!
Justin looks at usman and thinks dam bro what have you been taking lol.
Colby is trying so hard to be confident.
Colby’s cameo at the end 🔥
Looks like very humble digs for Rose and Pat. Considering he had a solid career and she's the champ, you'd expect even a little bigger tv, haha. Dana keepin all their blood money.
Viva mexico EU de mierda
Usman is one the nicest fighters in the UFC, yet a vicious beast in the octagon!
KAMARU EPO user, cheater, but no one calls him for it, disgusting !
3:47 what in the Tony Ferguson
usman chandler & zhang my picks for this weekend
Michael Chandler is getting KO'd flushed by Gaethje. I'm sorry for Gaethje's next component after Khabib!
9:15 Colby always talks like there's a posse of morons behind the camera ready to go "OHHH" every time he finishes a sentence
Usman will win
Usmans a known juice head. Big spotty back on him
Usman vs Covington. Usman with TKO or KO in Round 4
The thing I observed from this besides the amazing talent is how cheap the UFC is.  Either Rose and Barrie are banking all their money or not getting paid.  Look at Rose's living room,  looks old and dated like a grandparents place.  That's not how Champs live.  Cheap ass Uncle Dana!!
FAKE MARTY USMAN!
Colby destroy that faker usman
LetS gooo colby!!!
Colby 💪🏻🔥
Colby Cov fight weeeeeeeeeeeeek!
3:46 If Justin isn't a Golden Retriever, I don't know who is
Interesting that Chandler thinks he's going to beat Oliviera after Justin meaning that he thinks Oliviera beats Poirier. Will be a very interesting fight for sure
This is a great card really is.
2:30 out of context is the best thing that happened to me this week
Gathje Usman Rose all dubs
Tony the type of guy to use headmovement while sitting on the barbers chair
colby looks like he's in a space station in the thumbnail
Anyone who finds Rose attractive likes young boys.
I see both the belts changing the hands !!
I hope this ppv crosses 1 million buys
Us man next career move = Llcoolj rap style.
Another epic card coming up this weekend! Can't wait
someone will tell mr chandler that his fight with gaethje isn't the people's main event
no pun intended with trump but you were front row of his rally 🤷🏽‍♂️ good luck to both men
“Corny” Colby Covington
Coby for the gold 🥇🥇🥇🥇
Good luck with Islam at 55
Geathje is done son! 💪🏻
Did Colby start listening to rap ? Lol
I can’t believe this fight is in a few days
chandler acting like hes a fan favourite is a joke
Chandlers coach reminds me of Matthew Lallards character in the movie Hackers
No one calling out Islam
I'd like to see fans asking for pictures with Trevor Wittman as well...  Ps: guys, since when does Slim Shady do MMA?
There's something about Pat Barry?? Idk he just weird
Im a massive Michael Chandler fan. Best of luck brother!
That dude with the ponytails had some Pop.
Thug Rose is sexy asf!
If Colby loses his trash talk won’t be taken seriously again
Pat Barry is a creep change my mind.
Love that colby got just 1 min here but is in the thumbnail 🙌
Good
Chandler get back in line pls
This tym covi will get belt
How long are we going to call Pat  the fiancé? Been about 5 years
This whole time Colby’s only been focused on Usman. That’s his difference. Everyone is missing that
Fuck no this man chandler shouldn't get title shot till at least 3 to 4 fights
Chandler doesn’t beat Dustin by any chance
Rose looks like a small siamese twin attached to big Barry
Absolute Criminal of the UFC to only have a Minute of Colby
I think Islam needs a title shot before chandler
Usman has this in the bag, it could go 5 rounds or 5 seconds though, I can’t wait for it.
Personality no.6: Humble Usman
IM ONLY HERE FOR COLBY
Michael Chandler stand up needs to stand up
Colby the type of guy to bring your cheating gf to bed and convince her to stay with you.
Am I the only who hasn't come across anybody saying Gaethje v Chandler is the people's main event? Literally the main event is the people's main event lol.
Marty from Nebraska. Born in Texas
I hope trevor didn't bite more than he could chew man
So we all gonna ignore the fact Justin just tried to get the speed bag goin with his feet?😂😂
Chandler, Rose, Usman
Colby couldn't hide the laugh at the end
Khamzat Chimaev will eat you all !!!
Colby is a funny guy 😂😂
I don't care what the scorecards say. Chandler definitely did not beat Charles 10-8 that first round.  He was in a submission attempt and in a body lock for near enough 2 min. Gtfoh.  PS Big John agrees with me. And he wrote the rules.
Bro imagine if he's the who sleep. That clip will be meme for sure
Coby somehow able to come up with such cheesy quotes.
Justin gaethje just seems more chill every time you see him with a fan.
Wittman has reached 25% hate of Ali. And that's a lot
People’s main event lol
Chandler talking about him and Justin being “the peoples’ main event.” Bullshit dude. Yea it’s a great fight but I’m sure 90% of ppl care more about seeing Usman and Colby fight. What a weird thing to say and bring up. Especially against a fight as big as Colby and Usman. You dumb Chandler.
Colby chemp 💪💪💪💪💪
Justin even beats up his fans 😂
😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Usman went from being my most least liked champ to I’m never missing that guy fight it’s crazy how fast he evolves and Colby is insanely good too
This guy talks a lot of shit man😂😂 your gonna lose AGAIN
“The great state of 305, Miami” -Colby “Madison square do it” Covington
2:53 that was beautiful
Colby doesn’t believe what he’s saying lol he knows it’s gonna be a nasty beating on the weekend
Michael Chandler will whip Justin like Khabib did
It's only on Tuesday. So much hype in this videos already Keep them coming
Trevor Wittman the modern day Mr Miyagi🥋👊🧘🏽‍♂️
If Usman - Gaethje and Namajunas won all together, Trevor Wittman must be inducted into the Hall of Fame as a historical coach.
Come on Colby go get it!!!!
Even if you beat Gaethje, you need to fight someone else before you get another shot at the title. Having a title bout twice in 1 year that too debut, is injustice to the remaining challengers. But we all know, as Tony said..... 'Dana White Priviledge'
with colby this one
you can tell you're dealing with a literal geek if they think Colby's trash talk is any good. Literally the most overhyped, underwhelming thing about the guy, yet all the betas cream themselves because they think the sport needs another Chael Sonnen
Why doesn't say f..k off on Usman,s suit? If he wants to be like  Conor Mcgregor then it has to be like that
Go Colby! Go Rose!
Feels like if Colby cant do it, no one can in the 170 division.
Comon usman and the rouse 🇳🇬🌹
I was rooting for Colby to win the first fight, but man I want Unman to KO him this fight. Colby is way past due for a major humbling experience.
Colby is the GOAT
Imagine all Kamaru, Justin and Rose get a win. Trevor Wittman must be the number one guy on press conference
Usman sounding like a good & well matured champ. Well done to both of you. We know what both of you will bring to the arena so may the best man win!
Was waiting fir this embdded. Cuz thug roseeeeee🌹🌹🌹🌹
GET ROSE SOME NICE HOUSE PAT YOU LIVE LIKE YOURE ON CRACK
Marty not being cringey here, for once
Another great weekend of fighting is coming! Can't wait!
Usman is more dangerous than past his now a hard striker and wrestler..  Usman will dominate step by step in every round it will be 2 or 3rd round finish
What just he sad at the end 😁😂 New York City doesn't sleep at night and I'm gonna make an exception, make him sleep 😀. Maaan Colby is so brave!!!
Colby won't scrap I'm telling y'all he is going to look for a submission early when Usman least expects it and wins🙆‍♂️🔥 biggest upset in UFC history😅😅
This is going to be a great night and a awesome pay night for Trevor Whittmen
Chandler got the title shot after one win thinks he deserves it again 😂. Get in line buddy and get a few wins
Colby is putting me to sleep with his lame jokes..
Colby the biggest dork out there hahahaha
Thanks.
i got kicks bro lol ok show them next fight smh
Videos with colby's thumbnail are doing better numbers that justin and Chandler
Colby: “the great state of 305 Miami”
Chandler seems small for 155...
Well how d fuck Is that even a question 🤣🤣🤣
Unrelated but at 4:45 that is a fkn awesome tunnel haha
Crazy to think that Colby thinks Dana was going to take the strap off an absolute goat like Kamaru just because he wouldn't fight his bitch ass hahahahahahahahahaha
You will never best Justin even.
Usman will win easy. Hes stronger, faster and has gotten smarter over the year since they fought. Colby is the opposite - not many fights and has gone to a lesser known camp
Rose is mentally slow??
Usman flat footed Marty
Let's go colby beat that Marty fake newsman👊👊👊
Colby has the cringe level of the ultimate karen
Michael Chandler hype train derailed. His legs going to be destroyed in the first round
Wish we had PPV in 🇬🇧
Who ever wins between Justin and Chandler needs to go through Islam to get a title shot.
Why is Cov acting more Black than the Champ?🤦🏽‍♂️🤢🤮 And its crazy to see how Justin is pretty much the same size as Usman😱
The fix is in... Colby Covington is fighting Kamaru Usman in Trump's hometown... Why wouldn't the UFC allow the fight to be in Nigeria?! Kamaru has earned the right to defend his title in his home country. He's very close to being the best Welterweight of all time and instead the UFC makes Kamaru fight Colby Covington in Trump's hometown?! Colby Covington hasn't even earned the right to fight for a championship in the city his daddy lives in! Kamaru ate everything Colby had the first fight, then dismantled him and broke his will. Colby was left making excuses for his own cheating tactics.  I have a feeling we won't see the same Kamaru this fight. I can guarantee you that they have found a way to cheat Kamaru Usman out of winning this fight, and it will be very obvious.. Could be something as simple as tainting Kamaru's water but I'm sure those devils on team Colby have many tricks in their bag besides the fact that Colby is permitted to use EPO without being caught by USADA. That's what happens when you shake a "Dragon's," hand, you become a cursed serpent! The shit is rigged. I want Kamaru to win but it would make no sense for Kamaru Usman to win both fights from a UFC business perspective.. There needs to be a trilogy and the UFC wants Colby Covington to become a champion and take over the reigns from Conor McGregor as the new UFC bad boy. Unless the Lord God Grant's Kamaru this  meaningless victory, in a meaningless sport, in spite of the devil's cheating tactics then Team Colby will steal this title as Trump stole his first Presidential election.
Bang CEO is gonna love them blurring  the logo on Colby
Look at Colby's face like the panties he rented
Shut up Chandler you only beat Hooker. You will struggle to stay top 5.
islam coming micheal
Chandler is cringe
People are acting like Colby also hasn’t gotten better 🤦‍♀️ may the best man win I’d like to see Colby win tho
Chandler saying he Will beat Dustin i highly doubt that🤔
Most excited for Justin Gaethje!
Don’t care what Colby says, Kamaru still beat tho
Not hating.. but those gotta be fake rocks on Colby's chain....
Rose's gigantic sofa pillow.. Comfzzz
Gaethje is such a good dude.
Sea level chandler
Ha ha 🤣🤣🤣
How the fuck is that even a question
I want covington to win just for the stupid shit he’ll say😂
Anyone know what time the main card starts Hawaii standard time?
Not a Colby fan but I think he wins this 2nd fight
Usman is boring as shit. Centre on Colby. He’s a funny guy
Let's go Brandon
After the last event I’m convince the Russian are gonna take over all these weight classes lol
2:31 That's what she said 😂😂
When Covington comes on he says he's in NY and you can hear the car hitting every pothole lmaooo
No footage with Iaquinta? Lame
4:00 Heisenberg buried $80mn here, just get the co-ordinates baby
2:22 In my opinion, THIS is exactly what true martial arts is all about. Respect, recognition and training to showcase your best skills against your opponent. I am glad that the fake rivalry facade is beginning to crack, I hope that the community let's and promotes Colby to do the same.
That was smooth my ousman, “no pun intended “
What was blurred out on Colby’s shirt?
I like how they ended it with Covington talking shit... lmao
Checkmate: Usman showing class as Colby is still ramping up his poser-trump antics. Man vs Child. Colby looking like a dweeb like he calls other people.
Trevor Whitmans camp taking home 3 dubs in one night easy
9:00 colby talking outta his ass like usual
Usman is growing on me dudes a stud and seems super humble
What if Colby wins
Hahah Trevor might be the most paid in the game if he comes through with the trifecta
641k views in 10 hours on an embedded this fight is obviously hype for even casual fans.
Usman fought 3x as a champ after they first fought. Colby fought washed up woodley to earn title shot and people hates usman.
The winner need's to fight Islam that makes since. I was shocked Danna said he had to fight another top guy after 9 straight. He has dominated all those win's. Islam is the number one contender he should be with no dispute..
Pat Barry is mad sus
Rose needs to upgrade the pad… geez
Without Trump as President, this fake Colby gimmick is boring now and awkward
Usman being himself is very likable. Usman trash talking is very cringe.
Gaethje, you are running on the wrong side of the road. Run on the left side so you are facing traffic, kids gonna get run over copying you, cheers and be safe!
That pun as fully intended Kamaru
2:30 that's what she said
Usman is a good fighter but he is copying conor McGregor
When Usman was talking about him and colby’s respect for each other that was some real shit
I don't think Justin will cut it he will lose
Chandler's stand up was sloppy against Charles. He isn't a stand up fighter and neither is Charles. Chandler does level change's when he throw's, he lean's in exposing himself. They were worried about the td is why they have been caught. He can't do that against Justin. I think Justin is going to put him away in the 2nd. Nothing against Chandler I like the guy. But he met his match in Justin, he is better on the feet and has more power. If Chandler can't take him down he will try to trade. It's not a good idea. Khabib absorbed hard ass shot's but it's Khabib the guy is made of fuckin steel.
Let's go Brandon!!!
Notice Justin is fighting Chandler who is trained by hooft and just trained by Trevor. Note also Usman trained by Trevor and used to be trained by hooft.
Colby going to get finnished in this one.
Trevor is the coach of both champs also justin. I’m thinking all three of his fighter lose.
Usman gonna break Colby's jaw again.
Kamaru back to being the split personality guy again.
Chandler is a clown.
Chandler doesn’t deserve a title shot, he need at least 2 wins for the title shot again
Rose cannot say shes the better fighter, she got a lucky kick. will see Sunday i hope it will be 5 rounds for both fighters :)
go chandler!!!!!
Kamaru is so much less cringe and I appreciate it greatly
Guys do you know the Video rose namajunas  watched where She won the title. Looked lit
Colby,Zhang,Justin animals are hungry Usman,Rose,Chandler better bring their A game
That tv placement is horrendous
Kamaru still on ROIDS Cycle and EPO i see.......
Coach of year?
Don’t get me wrong I love the Wittman camp, but there is a possibility he is spread too thin
I want Chandler and Covington to win......Bring some spice to the UFC :)
Usman is a good level headed champ. It's cool to hear when the champ has respect for his competitor even though they have a bitter rivalry going on. Covington does do a lot of crazy stuff but dude is a tough guy he backs up his words. It's going to be a awesome fight between these two animals
Honestly i do feel like islam should get a shot chandler beat dan and got a shot then dan wins his next fight and islam runs through dan i think its only right he gets a shot next honestly
Let’s go colby and chandler !!
Trevor “Kamaru is better than Kamaru” Wittman
IF(big if though) this whole card comes together and no one drops out. It might be the card of the year
Lucky fan, met Justin and is on embedded lol
Trevor is coah of the year. Especially if all of his fighters win.
hey is asking $100 bit too much?
Colby will give Usman his toughest fight, but Usman seems to be years ahead of all the other WW’s.
I originally didn’t like usman but I do now.
I want to get a bigger TV for Rose...
Nobody "walks through" Justin or Dustin
2:31 That's what she said
Okay so who’s winning?? I want Colby to win but my money is on Usman. Justin or Michael? This is a tough card!
Imagine if all 3 of Whitmans fighters lose back to back to back, not gonna be a good look lol
Usman will gas out
Glad to see Colby's jaw is back to normal. It'll hurt more when Usman smashes it again. lol
Chandlers getting bullied😭 He said he beat Olivera 10/8 But got knocked out like a midget  Gaethje  Khabib A diff level forshure
Let’s go Colby! I hope he can pull it off and during his interview with joe he screams “Let’s go Brandon!!!”
Sanford MMA is a beautiful gym
Expecting pretty much the same result as the first fight between Rose Namajunas vs Zhang Weili, once the champion Rose Namajunas finds the right rhythm and timing. UFC Welterweight Champion Kamaru Usman has gotten so much better than the first time he fought and finished Colby Covington, it's very likely that he'll finish Covington again, and it might even possibly be faster in this rematch.
Lmao…Colby is only in the last 10 seconds of the video and delivers the best line in the entire video!
Damn Izzy was right usman dressing sense in ufc is second to none. Those suits are great
islam can get the winner of gaetje and chandler........and if he win....he deserve tittle shot against the champ (winner of dustin vs charles)....thats it....no short cut
Madison square do it
We all know when fighters rematch with Usman what happens    - Jorge Masvidal
Thumbnail looks like Colby just dropped a music video 🔥😂
I’m sorry bro but nobody thinks you vs gaethje is the main event hahaha how come nobody told him this..
3:34 Whats goin on?? they have to train at the same cant and they dont like eachother....oohhhhshiittt! thats f**ked upp
Really appreciate the class out of Usman the whole way through, and I'm a Troll
Justin😂
Rose's TV's practically mounted to the ceiling hahaha
The Nigerian Nightmare vs Chad
Bet the house on Colby ! 👊. Snoozman
I was having fun watching this embedded but then Colby showed up
Sooo pumped for this card. Chandler, Gaethje, Colby, Usman, Rose all on the cards
I feel like Usman wrestling have decreased because he think he's a striker right now but Colby is in a much worst fight camp so it will be interesting
Let's go, Chandler!
Wow Sea Level Chandler Vs Elevation Gaethje
it will be all chaos
Can’t stand Colby he always talkin shit he needs to humble himself and usman is going to do just that 💪🏽‼️
Chadler beats Gaethje
Nah the winner got to come see Islam or Beneil. If the winner of Gaethje and Chandler get the title shot then the rankings are a complete joke.
Good to see Colby finally getting his worth
43:01 had me dying
Damn Colby is corny AF. Hope Usman knocks him out cold
This dude Chandler just gonna act like Islam don’t exist? Bitch, the winner of you and Justin fight Islam for the number one contended
LETS GO NOV6
Kamaru the McGregor waanabe,the irish accent stealeer usman.
Yes by that thumbnail:  Colby is In the Studio......
You beat him 10-8 the first round?? lol I wasn't even sure you won the round
Rose had made over 1.4 million and still living in that house! smart woman, smart team. invest in the longterm and make sure you never go back to the old days. cheering for Rose again!
@ 9:15 Classic Colby one liners
If Colby is abel to save himself from that deadly jab then he's surely winning
KAMARUUUUU
Rose, Pat and Trevor are a great team. Gaethje is a legend and Usman is a warrior. What a card
Let's go brandon
Michael “ I may or may not shoot “ Chandler even though I said I was gonna stand and bang
Let's go Colby and newwwww
why on earth is Rose's TV is so high up lol
Don't know why, usman showing respect to colby seems sign of weakness to me. After seeing this, for a reason i now know colby winning this. Mark my word, colby winning this fucking fight
He said i will beat Dustin ,   😅  I’d like to see it  He’s still got Gaethje in front of him ..
23133
C level 🤣🤣
Chandler vs gaethje fights Islam and the winner of that fights for the title
Why can’t usman always be this normal and likeable it’s his cringe that usually makes me hate him but I like him more when he is being normal
Colby sounding like he's been rehearsing his lines. Needs an acting coach if he wants to sound more natural with gimmick.
Chandler is such a dumb guy. You will never get that championship fight again. Plus he speaks a lot and that is irritating
Stacked card
When the promos are giving motivation to the fighters you know they are epic!!
Colby not sleeping nobody.. feather punches!
23323
332323
13333
2313
Lol when the political shit is insane to the point where actually talking about it is important Colbly stays silent. He’s a fake Persona obvi.
No pun intended mwah, u just put respect on yourname 😆
Rose is the best
Lol why tf would they strip usman
Thank you UNCLE DANA...
Gaethje basically never been down and out from getting chinned. Chandler has.. that's how I see this going.... Although if he beats Justin. damn. he's right there again. He was beating Oliviera in that Rd. 1 and got overconfident.
Usman asking the tailor how much the suit is off camera😂😂
I hope Usman puts away Colby early inside 3 rounds.
2:40" ik he respects me ik he does" Yes kumaru bro we all know that he's actually a good guy who wants to put up a show
Chandler colby rose
Oliveira vs Chandler was 10-8 first round?? NO WAY!
Sounds like Usman is done. He sounds like he wants to move over to boxing.
Wait til Trevor finally sells his gloves to a MMA organization, he’ll reach God Tier
Ali: Usman is a bigger star than canelo. 😹😂 Explain why canelo has his own gym?
Chandler says gaethje / chandler the peoples main event😂 what about usman vs covington?
Gaethje cold for being so nice to that dude after doing a PB on a 1,300 incline in elevation LMAOOO
VVS covington in this joint lol
LITERALLY NO ONE WHO MATTERS SAID FIGHT COLBY OR GET STRIPPED. Fuck why do we have to turn UFC into WWE and put on these dudes that talk shit that everyone knows is bullshit fake nonsense. Is there anyone that actually gets excited for the Colby gimmick in 2021? WeirdChamp
The people champ Colby Covington, let’s go!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
3:26 That's alot of words for saying *my fighters roided*
When there's a shortage of goods, UFC graces us with back to back UFC Championships.
When Rose said "it's my job to not get fucked up." I had to laugh with anticipation for this fight. Because I don't care how many people are upset if fight's aren't drug out. I just want to see how each fight plays out. Some just happen to take a few moments is all.
8:22 those pants! Hahahaha. What a dork.
Watching Pat Barry get excited and amped while watching Rose's highlights is awesome...he literally couldn't set still and was on the edge of his seat...she's awesome
And Weili? Fuckers!!
Greetings nerds and virgins
Hearing Usman say that made me hold up second. That’s maturity
All respect too Usman but if Colby wins which it's highly possible, man what a upset that would be.
Sounds Colby is trying to convince himself that Kamaru is afraid to fight him
Let's go straight to Usman vs Khamzat that is THE FIGHT
Islam and Khamzat will be the 155 and 170 champs in coming months....it's just matter of time and couple of fights for both of them.
Usman is just a terrifying Human. And I think with Trevor as his main coach, there is nobody who can beat him. If you look at what Trevor Whittman did with Justin Gaethje and Rose Namajunas.   Rose is literally the best female striker that has ever existed in history. Her footwork and overall striking technique and stopping power, is better than any female combat fighter in history. Justin Gaethje literally became a new fighter, after his 2 losses, when he returned against James Vick. Gaethje's power and technique was completely transformed, and he looked like a new fighter, literally overnight, with the help of Trevor. Imagine Usman being the best striker in the UFC, combined with his wrestling, and his raw athleticism.   There is no way anyone can beat him. If I was Colby, I would wait for Usman to retire, instead of rematching the new Trevor Whittman variant of Usman. Usman can inflict life altering damage (he may have permanently ruined Jorge with that punch to the jaw). Colby could make just as much money by waiting another 1 year for Usman to retire and go into boxing.   Colby truly does walk the walk, and he isn't just talk, that's for sure. In the first fight, Colby literally almost KO'd Usman with some beautiful shots straight to the chin. Colby was using loose, flowing punches that really had some power. And Usman admitted after the fight that Colby's punches were pretty good. But if Colby changes the technique completely, will he still have that level of precise power? It's hard to imagine him hitting Usman any cleaner, or more accurately than he did in the first fight. But Usman was rattled for a couple seconds and wobbled a bit in the first fight, so he isn't completely unbreakable (like Jon Jones).
"Trevor f**ing Wittman" in jon anik's voice..what a freaking card.
Annnnnnd newwww!!!!
I'm scared for colby man. Usman is at a point where he's unstoppable and mentally he is on another level. He's coming for colbys head like the masvidal fight
Trevor Whitman coaching both champions and Gaethje on this card is crazy
real fighting fans are going to be watching Canelo vs Plant not this backyard fighting
If you beat Justin you will have another title shot Lol you must be delusional.
I legit thought coach was Steve o with long hair
This is the most likable I've seen Usman in any piece of media so far. Glad he's starting to act more (seemingly) genuine recently.
Usman's Level Of Fighting Is At Goro's And Shao Khan's Combined!
I want Colby to win. Will bring freshness to the 170 division
Were gaethje and usman trying to fight .
Someone please get Trevor to pound to pound no 1 ranking for best coach
Chandler beat hooker a crap journey man, chandler hasn't done shit whys he acting like he has,,, bushit artist Justin gathie will slaughter chandler put money on it
2:40 RESPECT to usman for that! 👏🏻
I’m sorry but there is absolutely no way Chandler can take big shots from Gaethje lol his poor weak chin is breaking quick
Let’s go Colby!!!
Let's go Brandon!
I thought Ozzy Osbourne was doing the  pads at first
Usman and my boy Jorge 🙌🏾are tougher than Colby at 170. Colby is good fighter tho but, Usman is on another level. Usman is the Champ for a reason 💪🏾 🏆👍🏽💯. Great fights on Saturday, can't wait!!!
Colby is cringe af but it's hilarious 😂
Chandler is gonna beat Justin
Kumaru playing genius mind games with Colby, killing him with niceness ;)
i want chandler to win justin is bitching alot chandler vs dustin  benniel vs islam should be the best
I need Coby and Mr.plant to pull the upsets!!!
9:17 *turns back to cameraman* “…how was that?”
Colby is a Good fighter, but he has only fought once since fighting Usman, while Usman has fought 3 times,  it is going to be a long night for Colby, Colby needs to use his wrestling more, and not to give up if he fails to take Usman down on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd attempt, continue with wrestling pressure like Khabib does.
Usman will probably lose this fight. Let’s me honest here. Despite me not liking Colby outside of cage, he’s a fuckin savage in there. He had usman rocked but then usman faked a nut hit, then faked an eye poke. He got about 6-7 minutes of break to recover from that. That completely fucked up the work Colby was putting in and I feel like he could have finished him.
I hope Colby gets him this time.
Colby has never put anyone to sleep, such a poser!
Get your parlays ready. Chandler by tko, rose by tko, Colby by tko.
Glad to see Usman is no longer the most unlikable guy on the UFC roster. Actually came across as a solid dude here.
Usman has improved since going with Trevor wittman…..now it’s time for colby to show off the new tools…if not he’s in for a long night….I’m rooting for colby but I’m not counting usman out by any means….he’s the champ for a reason
Can't wait for this banger of a card.
Colby at the end landing on a private jet, then proceeds to take a hood bus to the hotel...
I feel like Pat kidnapped Rose, and she cut her hair off so he would quit fucking brushing it in the basement.
No pun intended 😂😂😂
The only person going to..sleep..is Colby... and his Jaw...LOL 😂🤣😆
glass chin chandler NGMI
Trevor Whittman:  Having them all on the same card is putting a lot of pressure on me. There is a different environment in the gym. Justin: trying to work the speed bag with his feet while standing on his head.
I feel like usman evolved more than convington since their last fight, I might be wrong but i kinda see convington going out like masvidal
Colby went from the most hated to kinda beloved now. Dudes just putting up a facade to make money. Sucks that the best in the world have to be entertainers as well. Anyone who knows mma knows Colby is almost equal with Kamaru and I hope he gets the W but also becomes more active. He’s too good to be wasting his prime not fighting 2-3 times a year.
What is up with Rose's house..
This is like the yan vs sandhagen fight, Im rooting for Covington but I’m placing my bets on usman
Usman is so disciplined I think he's got this forsure
I expect rose to snipe her again, can never count out Weili though.
all these strikers fighting to lose the belt to a wrestler at last. irony as if this has not happened before
i hope who ever wins between gaethje and chandler has to fight islam for the #1 contender spot.
2028 Micheal Chandler: I will beat (insert champs name here) in the first quarter of next year and get that UFC gold wrapped around my waist.
Trevor Wittman will be very busy Saturday night
Chandler is talking rubbish at the start of this video it’s a great fight but it’s not the fight everyone is talking about lol
Cards like this don’t come often, everyone enjoy, pay for it to help your fighter get paid. I don’t see how rose could do any better than that sneaky head kick but let’s go! I’m pulling for Rose for sure, Colby, and gaethje but would be happy with a war either way in Justin vs Chandler and Usman vs Colby. Usman is a killer.
I feel like Chandlers kill or be killed style will be the end of him.
Colby weili chandler
God I hope Colby wins this.
Trevor is playing UFC coach mode with all the op fighters.
What a night this will be. Fights fights fights
Usman by first ever foot stomp TKO, Rose wins a tough decision, Gaethje KO's Chandler in the 2nd. Trevor Wittman GOAT MMA trainer.
Colby’s trash talk is so brain dead. “The city that never sleeps but hopefully they’ll make an exception ‘cause I’m putting Marty to sleep” … dude, hire a writer or something smh
Doesn’t Colby remind you of Malibu’s Most Wanted!?
I think that  random picture missing in Sanford gym use to be Usman
Rose - I'm more deadly than Chinese covid
I started this video on 2% a few minutes ago and my phone died just as Colby started his shtick. God is real
I literally can not stand Chandler and I don't even really know why
Chandler is dreaming , he needs at least two wins fir a title shot i mean bro you just lost s championship fight
I just don’t see wittmans fighters losing tbh
Usman just wants to be mates
Hey chandler you wish
Colby shouldn't keep this one as a pure striking fight again. Beating Usman on feet is now is an uphill battle.
Trevor is making usman a better person.
Lol chandler is dreaming he has glass jaw
Covington ain’t scare he coming for that belt but Usman won’t let him. UFC
Impressive how Usman moves like that while having flat feet
Lol funny how Colby still talking shit., bro you got your jaw broke and got put down. Just stfu already, the shit talk makes you look like more of a clown
MARTY FAKENEWSMAN YOURE DEAD!!
Michael Chandler is a fight fans dream
I wanna believe Colby but......🤣🤣
I swear this card is STACKED, i don't even care who wins, i know its gonna be a good show, it'll be nuts is Colby and Weili win tho, trilogy fight again.
"Shut up" Colby just "Shut up"
Chandler thinks he deserves another title shot already lmao
Rose is a anime character in real life
PAT BARRY!!!! lol
Is it just me or is Kamaru becoming likeable? I think now that he’s more secure in his position and genuinely believes that he’s the best in the world he’s becoming so much more authentic
Colby 2021
I was waiting for Zhang in Cejudo's bedroom
Kamaru has really come into his own. I like him now lol
Put usman kumaru with Khamaza 🐺 he’s ll eat him in 1st round  khamza is hungry wolf 🐺
Who is Colby training with??
Can't wait for this one! I'm not a Usman fan but he's theeeeeee most improved fighter in the whole league. Hands down. Damn it!
Usman: I know he respects me 😁.. Colby: MARTY FAKE NEWSMAN.. You're DeAD !! 🤬
God damn Usman is a badass.
Colby "USA" Covington
Chandler vs Gaethje, that fight Is going to be sick!
Wtf this coby talking
Make "Crap-ington" Crap Again
This has potential to be the greatest main card ever
Colby’s camera times like 30 seconds and still more entertaining than Snoozeman🤣🤣🤣
Just wait until Hazmat gets his hand on Usman 😧😧
LETS GO COLBY
😁😁 to all these guys overlooking Covington, even Khabib acknowledge he is a beast who really know how to fight, and will be Usman' hardest fight..
Chandler is delusional, another title fight after justin?
Michael chandler said oliveria hasn’t lost a round since 2017…. He lost to Paul felder that year
Micheal chandler doesn’t realize or may just not know, his worst fear about to be upon him. Sadly even with a blowout k.o win he isn’t fighting for a title next unless Dana is nice enough to make the winner of Justin/chandler face islam for the interim belt. Worst nightmare for chandler is Islam. Same for the fans. Ain’t nobody interested in them dagestanian leg huggers, if only khazmat was 155, and could clean out them bearded rats. I respect them but they’re fighting style couldn’t be anymore lame
Colby looking like 2004 John Cena.
Usman's era is over
Marty Snoozeman sells so many PPV’s they put Colby on the thumbnail where he only has a 15 second cameo on a 10 min video lol 😂
Kamaru usman, and justin gaethje training side by side, sparring and sharpening each other with trevor friggin whitman directing the show ought frighten the absolute hell out of every elite fighter in their weight division.. and all up and comers as well.
I didn't know Anthony kedis was Chandler's coach
7:58 what is that? Last of the Mohicans.
trevor having to split up kamaru and justin was so funny
How could you not respect Usman, he spoke no trash about a guy that shows no respect to anybody.
Gaehtje is a damn animal tho. And lately he’s been even scarier because he’s learning patience.
Justin gaethje is my favourite embedded fighter  lol
Bro the way Colby talks sound more sinners given his skill doesn’t match how he talks. Sounds like a fool and then he put the smack down and your left thinking damn didn’t see that coming. But he told u
This is awesome I remember when we would wait months in between ufc events.
Colby is such a fucking clown
wonder if rose goes to the same barber as pat🤔
Genuine usman is monumentally more likable compared to that persona he puts on most of the time
Can someone please explain to me how Colby is such a douche, but he’s so good and focused..? I seriously don’t understand how he’s that good.
Who does everyone think has more pressure on them in each fight usman and rose because they know if they lose they get an immediate rematch or Colby and Zhang cause if they lose they can’t fight for the title until the champion finally loses the belt which could be potentially longer then the rest of your career
I think Colby's antics is all an act just to bring in views - either way it should be a great fight. Hopefully his jaw doesn't break again.
Not relevant to the fights, but how the hell is the co-main fighter living in a house like that? No offence, but are these competitors seriously underpaid or what? The best in the world at what they do, yet they live in small homes.. interesting.
Kinda trumps everything that he does  Usmans best bar so far😂
Everybody respects each other it seams. Nice, good card!
Huge night for Trevor Wittman.
All three of the top fights can go either way. They are all very close. Damn!!! going to be a fun night
So many people say it’s just an act being Colby ?? Fact is his just a Goose
Winner of Justina gaethe And chandlers faces khabibs cousin..... looser of kamaru uzman vs Colby faces chivaev khamzat.. I should be the match maker for ufc.
Guess the lens cap was on for the jet ride :/
Fingers crossed for no leg breaks 🤞🏻
I think Hazmat eats them, I mean beats them both. Dude is another level of scary.
Colby is the real king of cringe.
Rose Namajunas looks like a miniature female Marvin Vettori.  I just noticed this.
Kamaru the most famous Nigerian dandy, cheater 100% EPO
Usman is a lot more likable when he’s not ripping off old Mcgregor lines and trying to be someone he’s not.
Damn good card
I'm still surprised Colby can still move his fragile jaw. Usman is going to smash him again! Does anybody know if Jorge Masvidal ever woke up from that POWER nap Usman gave him? Asking for a friend. 🤣
It seems everyone under Wittman is hard to beat!!! great team!
2:31 … Trevor, oh Trevor you nasty Boy
It would be MMAs biggest upset if Rose, Gaethje and Usman all get finished in the first round.  Trevor might kill himself
Thankful to be able to see colby and kamara fight again. Probably the best matchup i have seen in a long time and watching them both fight is a work of art
Chandlers chin is suspect. I take Justin in this one.
I don't think Chandler or Justin will get the title fight...the winner will fight Islam nd that fights winner will get the title shot
Just wish usman would get popped for steroids already holy shit
Trevor's training 3 champions wtf how does that even work. I can't even train my weiner dog
Keep dreaming is not going to happen Justin's going to kick a mudhole in your ass
It’s bullshit that Joanna and Weli both got the rematch when rose beat them, and she didn’t when she lost to Andrade
"Hey bro, let me interrupt your training for my instagram stroy, yeah?!"
I can feel the fake entertainment promo from Colby but I still love it cause the fight is real - Ant Jonez 218
This is gna be good
Usman and Covington fight was legendary. I hope coby does win so there is a 3rd fight. Bring on UFC 268! THUG ROSE!!
Best card of the year, top to bottom.
Damn, Colby got a super chain.
I like Chandler but c'mon it's Islams turn at the belt.
I love every fighter on this card! So pumped for these fights lets go!!
Is Colby slowly turning into vanilla ice?
That lead leg of Chandler will be a balloon 🎈 if he doesn't stop Justin in round 1
Who cares about these clowns. Khamzat’s coming and they want none of that smoke, bro.
Usman is right there with gsp yall colby lovers bout to learn that once he breaks his jaw again
Kamaru has a good attitude. I'm rooting for him.
God man pat and rose really love eachother.  ❤  you can't help but see these people as role models.
These Khamzat fanboys in the comments are rapidly becoming as the Conor, Khabib and Diaz fanboys
He’s not here for a long time
Title shot has to be earned chandler. Face Islam makhachev or be next to him for a title shot. He has a nine win streaks. You are WL
Colby wants to get revenge for usman breaking his jaw last time 😂
Colby all the way . Rocking the gold link .. Yes yeah
Colby has ascended to most cringe
No way kamzaf is running through usman . Look at the muscles on usman . He’s on another level than the Asian he fought last
@2:31 that's what she said
Covington is a clown.
Cannot wait it's absolutely fantastic this card UFC 268
WEILI ZHANG EATS HER IN THE REMATCH!
The realist I've see Usman in a while. I agree with him. Colby's caught up in his gimmick, but I think he respects Usman just like Usman respects him.
Colby acting like a rapper now...
Kamaru is fighting and behaving like a true champion now, he matured a lot and it shows
All of them took the clot shot
Rose seeing the UFC countdown
Fuck, rose is hot🥵
Colby such a 🤡🤣
2:52 pun intended he really forced that in and laughed at his own joke. Fucken love this guy, can't wait to see the third fight in Africa trying to win his belt back.
1:03 .. if this guy chandler thinks he will get a titel shot if he wins is pure jokes man😂. But if he do win and it actually happens thats straght favourism from Dana because never in the history of UFC has it happend that someone got a titelshot after ONE fight, LOST, fought another fight and been given titel fight again. Everyone in the top 5 deserve it more than him specially dariush and machatjev.. no matter the outcome that fight!
I like colby & kamaru. Just glad there's someone who can actually challenge usman
Looks like Covington is trying to drink his own Kool-Aid. And it's blue.
Michael " beneficiary " Chandler
Pun intended
Usman by Murder
Michael Chandler just comes off as a douche to me 😂. I think its just cuz he likes talking so much lol. I always have to skip his parts.
8:23 pause
marty so weird
Lmao Colby flew from Florida to New Jersey cos he couldn't afford to land in LaGuardia or JFK airport
This is so tough on me I'm the type of fan who hates when fighters I like fight eachother, I LOVE rose but really like weili so I'm leaning towards rose I really like Justin and I really like chandler so that one kills me , I like Colby and I like  usan  I might be rooting slightly for Colby because I feel like the ufc will get rid of him if he loses   the over all feeling is no mater who wins I'll end up bummed for who doesn't win
Fans of Trevor Whittman, read an article from years back called The Hurt Business, 1 year inside Grudge Training Centre, Trevor's old gym. Amazing read.
I smell another BROKEN JAW. 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Hoping Colby puts Usman 2 sleep.  Takes that belt for a short time before Chimaev takes it for a long while.
Pat Barry rules!
Usman loves Colby for ppv payday that he gets from him because unfortunately in our sensitive age, Colby triggers a lot of people and people want to pay to watch him lose and also besides being a great fighter he’s a great promoter by playing the guy that pisses of people.
If chandler beats Justin, then he will fight Islam for a title eliminator. That would be awesome
Nice to hear Usman be humble you can tell he's at a place mentally that's beyond where the rest of the division are.  I'm excited to see Usman perform
I always thought Mike was pretty corny but dudes got heart, I love his mindset wish him nothing but the best but got root for AZ boy Justin Gaethje!!
4:02 CEO of EPO crossing
Gotta love a fighter with a good dog painting
Dustin Poirier will DESTROY Chandler
Chandler is OVERRATED
Card of the year
We are here for colby
Fight fan crisis.... UFC or Canelo vs Plant! Send help please
Gaethje,namajounas,usman are the winners the rest was losers
If Usman beats Colby the 2nd time..he cleared the division
Chandler has been pretty active. I think he will win tomorrow
Justin I need altitude to win lol
I feel like Colby or usman gonna  try some wrestling this time ? Both will gas some energy there and then go full combat
Kamaru's nasty jab is going to be the difference maker in this fight. I want to see an upset but I just don't see that happening
The fact they hang up a replica of every single Usman defense is laughable, that’s what the rubies are for. It’s time for a new champ.
Gaethje fights for the title if he wins, Chandler fights Islam if he wins
Terrible suit.
If usman beats Colby ‘convincingly’ he’s in goat talks
I know a man on PEDs when I see one and Usman is absolutely one of those guys. I’d put everything I own on it.
5.22 heavyweight holloway preparing for dc🤣
Half Milly views in 6hrs, Chandler is bigger "Needle Moover" than Nate FKIN DEEEEEEAAAAAZZZZZZZ (Joke obv lol but Colby got that Needle Moving to FKIN  11)
Man that’s so damn cool being from Colorado and seeing these stars in our backyard. How dope. COLORADO GANG WHERE YOU AT
If chandler wins he’s fighting Islam next
You can hear someone throw up at 1:09 😂
felt like i watched the last embedded episode yesterday, cred to dana and the entire ufc that we just had that banger of a card and just 2 days later we 're already here on the first embedded episode on a new killer card
Chandler has a delusional perspective...
I’m putting Marty asleep in msg haha
Justin, wei, kamaru
Colby,gathej,rose 👍👍
That tv is crazy high above the fire place
Usman’s camp looks dope, I would spend hours in there just shadow boxing lol
What excuses will Colby's fan come up with when Usman, the GOAT, wins for the second time?
Usman is a monster I love how composed he is  this guy is a straight killer
*I can’t wait for this press conference*
Usman you got this!!! And Still ❗️❗️❗️
why doesnt rose, one of the pfp women fighters, get a bigger tv?
Colby is a hell of a fighter. I hope Usman koes Colby.
Henry hooft is cornering 3 fighters also, man is a legend
Is that will Ferrell holding the pads for chandler
1:00 forgot this guys name? The one holding mitts for Chandler
Justin : gotta train hard for this fight  Also Justin : 3:48
usman the best💯
Gaethje Chandler is going to be straight fireworks
Just skipin Usman's parts here
Knowing that there’s a lot of top ufc level fighters here in Denver motivates me.
1miguels ole lady gotta dump truck!!!!
I love how Colby flew to New Jersey and thought he was in New York. Proud Trump University graduate with a degree in American geography. 🇺🇸
Usman needs to put his Bob bar a little lower.
Justin gaethje has negative swag
Colby needs to develop a sense of humour. The best trash talkers get laughs as well as saying the tough guy stuff, Colby doesn't even get pity laughs.
Colby gana win
The fact that people are giving more credit Colby for losing than Usman is laughable. Seeing comments like "Usman is better when he is respecting Colby" is also hilarious. Just say you want Colby to win. Too bad he will lose like Trump again lol.
Colby with the great ‘city that never sleeps’ bit at the end!
I love my boy Chandler but I think he's a little confused about the UFC crew?... These UFC boys are playing for KEEPS Mikey!!! Gaethje, Poirier, AND Olivera!?... That's a TALL ass order my brother... That's a TALLLL order. GL!
He can’t keep Trumps name out his mouth 😂😂.
I really used to like Rose..
ufc 268 is 🔥🔥
is it just me or is chandler extremely unlikable
Chito Vs Edgar gonna be 🔥 🔥
micheal "i got one win ill get the title shot"chandler
Whitman team going 0-3
Colby lookin and actin like an unsigned SoundCloud rapper 😌
I want rose to lose so bad.
If and when Usman wins this fight, he will be no doubt up there with the best fighters across all of combat sports. He's at GOAT status already, losing this would spark doubt amongst many but a win here is the cherry on top.
Why is Rose's TV so high up
Not buying any of Usman nice guy act
Us man will be the goat someday and nobody will be able to deny it!!
Colby time
Sad part is, kamaru pays top dollar for those suits. Colby goes to best buy.
Ufc is in a serious decline
I like how Colby creates his own narrative of an alternate reality. Like dude you went night night in your first fight, what makes you believe he’s scared now?
surprised Usman is the one with the terrible suits this time around
Rose 🌹
He landed in Jersey and said he landed in NY.  That's my only gripe with this episode lol
Americans fight Americans. Brazilians fight Brazilians. Why is it that Russians don't fight Russians? I think the last Russian vs Russian fight I remember was Alexander Emelianenko vs Sergey Kharitinov.
Michael (NO WAY I'M GETTING THE VACCINE TO FIGHT IN NEW YORK! [but also, i'm fighting in new york, shhhh🤫🤫🤫]) Chandler.
michael chandler is so confident, not saying if it's bad or good but he really is
2 week straight of embedded😩❤can't ask for nothing better
colby head movement gna be a challenge for usman this time around, colby reckons he been developing it this training camp and utilised against woodley but usman different still will make for a good fight
I want to see makachev vs chandler or gaethje for his next fight! Both great matchups!
God I hope Colby wins the belt and the whole crowd chants fuck joe Biden
Marty is very unlikeable
Colby going to sleep simple
my god usman is a fucking huge 170. i think if it wasnt for that colby would beat him because his skills match if not better usmans accept he has the crazy velocity and cardio that usman doesnt, however if a guy is longer and bigger and at least 14-20 pounds heavier then skills can go out the window. if colby is the SLIGHTLY better wrestler then it wouldnt matter because he is way smaller and its the same with the strikes. i think usman wins again he's just huge man
pat woke up gonna make the cameraman feeling in danger
I like chandler but Islam better fight for the title before him or Islam face winner of gaethje/chandler then winner of that fight poirier/olivera
Of course he didn’t wanted to fight you Clown Colby, he beat you already, he stopped you, it didn’t even went to a decision, he put you on your ass twice, he broke your jaw, he smashed your face, and the ref had to saved you from going to sleep and making a bigger fool out of yourself. It makes all the sense in the world to not want to fight your weak ass.
Usman has grown into a real champion, guy seems so disciplined and focused on getting better.
Colby "John Cena" Covington
"I got kicks" 🤣🤣 Bro you about the learn the hard way about kicks.
Michael chandler sounded like the guy that wrote essays for people
Colby looking like a "island boy"
I fucking lost it at 3:47 XD hahahahahahahaha  the dexterity
Colby gonna take the belt!! Let’s go!!
2 embedded weeks back to back 😱💦🤤
Chandler has all the skill sets to win , all around better and more dangerous fighter but his chin might not be able to take a gathje bomb. Gathje is capable of eating a few
*Marty* *Continues* the *trend* of *Ugliest* *Suits* I've *ever* *Saw* before the *Big* *Fight*
Ol skinny legs Kamaru aka chicken leg champ
Trevor Wittman is the coach goat (to me anyway)
Gaethje v chandler... usman v colby.... good fights. no one really cares about any other fight on this card. I'm not interested in seeing 2 women fight tbh
Chandler’s hat is dope.
Best card of the year ! LETS GO !!!
Khamzat Chimaev 😳
Makachev > gaetje > chandler
Colby, first round KO..  AND NEW
People Running With Fake Nut Shot Fake Eye Poke Is Just As  Delusional As The Person Who Starting Saying It (coLby)😂😂😂😂😂 Marty Fake Newsman And Still!!!!!!!!
I totally agree with Justin. I can't stand people that won't spend a minute with their fans. There are situations where maybe you can't,  but most of the time,  if you won't give a fan some time, you suck
Colby is the best UFC fighter of all time! GOAT
Mr. Bling bling Colby Covington.🥶
Hey rose   She will be try this time to make the fight more physical . So watch out .   Last round of Jessica andrade fight was physical . I think that's the only way to beat u. So watch out .   I am very excited . I am praying that you win . You are the best female fight on the planet . Thank you for fighting like a True champion
Notice they didn't show any training of Colby lol
Cringe Covington....
“If he didn’t fight me the UFC was going to strip him and move on…” wut 🧐
nigerian nightmare going to have his inner lion bring down, claw to death Colby, once again.  4:35 gaethje i know you like to think you're right doing elevation training, but that only works if you are BOTH at HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  You may have to adapt to thicker air yourself - so good luck to that thinking you have.  we'll see.   i've seen people go from mile high training to training where i've been at sea level before and they weren't able to catch up(i was running longer distance than them i'm sure)
why kamaru face like joe frazier?🤔
These fighters need to just accept that only 1 person can be champion. And Chandler won’t become tf especially with Mackachev lurking
Rose isn’t the best lmfao traumatized from the bus incident like 9/11 trauma
Colby gonna take some Unisom cause he’s gonna catch some Zzz’s
Nothing about zhang for the whole 9:37 minutes 🤣🤣
Usman is mature and keeps it 💯 he is also a trump supporter 🇺🇸💪🏻
Man seeing Usman show respect to Colby like that, says a lot about Usman as a man. Respect to you Usman!
Tbf Trevor is insane coach god bless him but i think chandler TKO, colby by decision and rose wins by ko again.
Colby always bringing the comedy and the cardio, Juiceman always bringing the cringe and the EPO
okay, that last line from Colby was borderline cool
Mad respect for Gathje- being as good human is better than all the fame and money in the world.
Justin will best chandler like no one has the win will be everything for justin
I dont think we've ever witnessed a more delusional fighter/competitor than Cloby Covington, dude really has not much of a chance of winning this scrap
Chandler and Justin.  Getting ahead of themselves . Islam is coming boys . Charles Olivera on notice too .   Islam is the man to beat 2022 will be exciting
Colby’s one liners are hilarious where does he come up with this stuff. “City that never sleeps Hopefully  they make an exception because I’m putting Marty to sleep” 🤣
None of these guys is in Islam Level
THE CHAOS
Putting 5k on Colby. That pun was good Marty,  but puns don’t win fights. LETTTTS GOOOOO!
It's The Wittman Show
Here come all the woke sjws crying about colby and say "he broke his jaw" when in fact he didnt. Lol.  Imagine their minds blowing if they knew Usman was MAGA too.
That GoPuff tho 🔥 🔥 🔥
Using Colby in the thumbnail and he’s barely in the video UFC already knows what’s up
We can use a Cobly as a champion, it could be fun.
Kamaru and Justin saying sup to each other over and over again gave me Stepbrothers vibes.
Colby missed everyone of those opps for a good soundbite. 🌽
Usman looks so light on his feet wtf. Whitman is a beast of a trainer
That last line by Colby was great lol
Crazy card! There's no doubt that Usman and Colby are the two best at 170...Lets go Brandon!!!!
Hahah Justin’s rabbit feet on the speedball 😂
Khamzat vs usman ...iam waiting
Let's be honest, we all know who the best fighter in the WW division is, and he's not even ranked.
To those who say colbys lines are cringe..at least they are original unlike Usman who's stolen multiple conor lines and colbys lines lol.
8:36 homie look like a clown, hope he wins tho it would be crazy ngl.
Love chandler man!!!!!!🔥👍🏻
Colby hasn’t slept since he lost to usman lol
waiting for the Justin handstand party memes...
Idk I’m not hype for this the same way I was hype for Yan
I really don’t like seeing people get battered and bruised, but when I do see it I want it to be  Colby Covington.💯
3 wins for Trevor Wittman
Lol Colby wasn't coming out of that jet 🤣 his capping.. this dude too funny
2:31 wait what !
Striking coach reminded me of the late, former champ Evan Tanner.
"I am the best!" Weili "Thug" Zhang after she cut her hair like Rose
So bummed that we won't be able to see Strickland vs. Rockhold. At least they could have found a replacement for Rockhold but they scrapped the fight altogether.
I know he can be a bitch but people sleep to much on Colby man. Look at Usman’s last fights, only man who gave him a challenge was Colby. Either way gonna be a good fight tho🔥
Here for Colby.
Bruh Chandler lost his mind, who saw a 10-8 in the olivera fight
Wow..400k views in 4 hrs? Colby draws
2:31 SUS
Win or lose between Usman and Covington...the roof would EXPLODE  if they actually embraced respectfully after...
That pun was ABSOLUTELY intended.
Great state of the 305 lol. Corny Colby
Cant wait for Colby to whoop that nerds azz
Don't worry guys..Islam is coming to hunt you all...
It was like 40 seconds of colby and it made watching this whole video worth it
Chandler, Weili, Colby. Bet it.
3:47 He definitely learned that from Tony
Ahhhhh Justin Gaejthe, my man
I dont see how Kamaru didnt have balance on those flat ass feet before 😭👏
U should see Justin and his coach's attitude b4 khabib's fight on JRE... U can definitely tell they were over-confident...
Still don’t get why chandler gets hate. Dude has been nothing but class! Guy legitimately wants to entertain us fans!
Chandler v Gaethje winner should fight Islam for No.1 contender. And yes i havent forgotten but i honestly dont even know where to put Dariush in this current situation. Sorry but yeah.
Justin by handstand kick ko
5:24 I couldn’t agree with Justin more, people are always standing up for celebrities when you are in their position you don’t get the right to deny autographs & photos with your fans
I think Kamaru will win again but I’d like to see Colby win to shake things up. Justin/Chandler fight is going to be epic. So hard to pick who I want to win that one. Will be happy either way.
winner of Gathje v chandler faces Islam for number one contender spot
I am sick of Colby  , honestly the persona is just overboard.   It's like a used cars salesman trying to sell you himself.
Colby doesn't even believe his own BS anymore
No way that Colby put him to sleep, the best outcome would be to outpoint him and win UD
Gaethje looking just as big as Usman if not bigger standing beside him
Chimaev v Usman is gonna burn down the house
I like how Weili tried to give herself the man haircut to copy rose. Shes going to need more than a haircut to beat Rose this time!
Clarissa shields should go there
That gym is reppin
Colby is getting finished eariler this time.
3:42 lmaoo
Not a relevant comment but I still find it cringe how they pushed ribas last "ppv" talking about her much improved hands, everyone knows she would still get sparked in the 1st round vs a top 5
Usman under Whittman is just on a another level. He already had the grappling but now that the standup is catching up to his grappling and he's stopping fighters just makes him an absolute problem for anyone and he can fight just as hard in the 5th round as he does in the first.
9:11 The highlight of the episode
I thumbed up as soon as Usman said no pun intended. Great vid.
Why would you train cardio against a fighter with 0 cardio?
Trevor Wittman creating real killers. What a legendary coach!
Michael Chedlar talking reckless
9:18 :-)
Poor colby..
I’m sorry but whoever in 155 is fighting Islam next
Chandler, Poirier, Gaethje, Oliveira, all good guys and incredible fighters. Sucks that only one can be champ. That being said, I think Dustin is still the most deserving.
Cant wait to see colby get destroyed
Colby is the only fighter with the skill set to beat Usman, but Usman is the P4P king.
I would’ve asked for a pic with Trevor Whitman as well. Man’s got 2 current champions in his gym and is a great coach. ✊
The money line between Usman and Covington is so far apart. I had this fight a 50-50 until i saw the bookies having Usman as a heavy heavy favourite!
I be in my girl ear like 2:30
Chandler said the same positive talk before fighting olveira and look what happened...
This card is stacked!!
Sea level chandler will win
It’s crazy how Trevor turned all of them into great strikers.
Can’t wait til USMAN flush the TURDoftrump
chandler needs to be a commentator with bisping and DC. he is so articulate
Colby spent all his  ufc check, on them si diamonds
Gaethje gonna drop Chandler with a hook then awkwardly finish him by handstand kick KO late R3.
Khamzat vs Marty from Dallas!  LFG!!! Love to see that fight
I hope all 3 win.  Gotta support fighters my home town.  Also I’m frankly sick and tired of Colby’s shtick.
I'm pumped for this. Im especially pumped for thug Rose and Weili though lmao😄
Justin is a nice guy for taking the time to greet his fans.
Usman getting a little like-able. Props to his new coach for helping him mature.
Wonder how many excuses colby will come up with after this one?
Colby will land that liver kick again. But the ref won’t save him this time.
I’m eating chocolate as I’m watching this. I feel like a piece crap now. No more!!!
You know etc lol
Dude.. hey.. lmao
Let’s get it colby
why did they blur colbys chain at the end
A lot of people don't realize that Colby has to change into this persona so that he could sell fights and the UFC wouldn't cut him.
I dislike both of these fighters (Coby and Usman) but I dislike Colby more. He’s a piece of shit. Chandler has been a loser since he came to the UFC… how does this guy still have a shot?
1:09 💀
Khamzat coming for you Usman
Someone tell colby that the 305 miami isnt a state moron
I use to really dislike chandler...but after listening to him a few times...he's very likeable
Marriage conselour Kamaru is back
Lol Colby looks scared already
I hope Chandler beats Justin , Justin has just been soooo annoying since Khabib mauling
Let's go Chandler !!!
1:30 Me when I choose hairstyle in UFC 4 mdrr.
You can't compare this coach at ONX  to John Kavanaugh. None of those fighters are double champions.  None have achieved as much as John Kavanaugh has achieved with Conor McGregor.
Chandler and justin who ever win get Islam for contender
Oliveiras standning finish this guy, Thats a "WWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOW" This is another level Chandler u gona sleep bro
Im sorry Michael Im a fan but yours DONT get a title shot if you beat Justin...you would need another fight with a top 3 ... then you can go for it again
Please Colby come out to Let's Go Brando!!!!
I dont get how anyone finds rose attractive. She can definitely fight though
I gotta get one of them bean bags 🌹
Imagine if all three of Trevor’s fighters lose :O
Usmans legs are so entertaining
I’m convinced Gathje is litterally impossible to not like.
Let’s go Brandon buy shib
why do  i get the vibe there is some uneasiness between usman and gaethje lol
Trump Colby 2022
The city that never sleeps is Vegas. Dumdum
I can wait usman beat the racist again.
Love him or hate him, there’s no doubt we need more people like Chandler on the lightweight division, man’s been fighting the best fights every three months
LETS GO COLBY!!!!!
Trever Whittman got his hands full.
i’m rooting for colby on this one, i like usman, but i love colby’s persona 🔥
There's a calmness to Usman. I feel he's ascended to another level.
We’re getting spoiled with these fight cards. 30 October and now 6 November.  Wow just wow.  Can’t wait.
Cap… Chandler is not beating Poirier
I really hope that’s Rose’s 2nd apartment.. the pay gotta get better
I could totally beat Marc Cuban tf up.
Justin gon win this one no doubt and Marty probably
Pat “the Pedo” Barry met rose when she was underaged and he was a grown man. Just posting this incase anyone forgot. Pretty odd that he’s gotta be by her side at all times in every embedded I’ve seen. Never out of the camera or spotlight when she is involved it seems.
So the clown mandate NYC put up only applies to Kyrie lol 🖕🏾 NYC
Just realized that Justin Gaethje is what Hael Joel Olsement (the kid from the sixth sense) was supposed to grow up intl.
Chandler's mom telling him that he's the people's main event.
Imagine still taking Colby Covington seriously
Justin  will kick his legs til  there compromised and tko him
Credit to Usman for saying he respects Colby.. you can tell he was a little uncomfortable being filmed trying on suits.. lol if you pay attention you can catch these guys out of character.. my favorite is the FACT Masvidal and Colby are still best friends outside the ufc🕵🤑
Gaethje vs Chandler is also Trevor Wittman vs Hooft big fight
I like chandler seems like a top fella, but them wars have took a toll on his chin, I don't believe he can take a shot as well as Justin, I see him getting sparked
All that money and rose and pat are living in a dumpy apartment....love it!
Majin vegeta vs Goku = Covington vs Usman. That’s how I see it lol
I feel usman said something pretty accurate in this.... that the first fight was just emotions they both just wanted to fight each other I think this one will include alot more range with submissions and grappling but I see Colby landing in a scramble
Usman knows Colby is his toughest fight
Card of the most annoying personalitys. First time I can't watch these episodes 🤦
What's the outro song?
2:20  Rose's house looks like my grandma's house.
This makes me like trevor whitman sooooo much more. My new rankings are 1. Bareman CKB 2. Whitman Onyx 3. Mendez AKA 4. Brown ATT
Colby.       I think he’s got a real shot to pull this off.    I’m predicting.   4 th Round TKO  And.   NEW
Gaethje is da man🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Schtick schmick the dude is a douche.
“No pun intended” 😂💪🏽💪🏽
colby is distracted with his 2nd lifestyle. 100% focus into what makes you a great fighter is what makes champions.
Kamaru is just a straight up good dude. Hard to want Colby to win, when the champ is such a perfect embodiment of the title.
Chandler nor gaethje get the next title shot. Do they not know this. They are going to give it to Islam. Then they can fight winner
Kamaru Usman time ✅
i was right about glover winning by submission, this time usman will win via tko
Usman openly acknowledging how good Colby is despite the antics is really refreshing.
Colby practicing that last line for two hours for him to say it that one time
I haven’t heard anyone say chandler vs Justin is the peoples Main event. I for one am pretty hype for Colby vs Kamaru
No belts will exchange hands
2:53 Usman’s is really growing into a personality, that joke was pretty funny ya love to see it.
That meme for this video looks like Colby is about to drop bars.
The position of Rose’ TV is upsetting. Creek in my neck watching them watch it!
I think if Justin fights like he fought tony I think he can win
The thumb nail looks like Colby is about to spit the hottest free style of the Covid era
ONX labs is the best
colby would be an admirable fighter when he puts a pair of socks in his mouth
Colby!!!!!!
Everyone should root for Colby so that we get a trilogy
Colby should have saved that line for the press conference.
Colby would be awesome if he stopped playing a part.
Look like usman was finding clothes at some Arabian gas station
By watching this video I kinda like Usman now, he’s being genuine in my eyes. This fight will be serious 😈
2:30  Just here for the comments on this.
Colby covington
Wittman training 3 fighters for this event?? Hope no one gets the short end in terms of individual focus and training...
Hey Chandler, don't forget to zag this time...
All the hate and memes alone if Colby can win would be to hilarious , can he do it ? We will see.
Kamaru is one of the most stylish fighters on the roster
I want to like Chandler but I can’t help but  think about what Josh Thompson said about him being fake. I can see that .
Covington with the corny jokes like always.
Kamaru si actually cool when hes not speaking like hes telling a scary story around a campfire.
Rose is going to lose
1:43 Red riding hood being training hard for the rematch with Big bad wolf
Lmfao with Gathje and his handstand kicks
lots of delusional ppl in the comments lol... Colby gonna make this shit look easy... Mark Goddard aint there to let fake newsman get breaks for fake nut shots. AND NEW!
if colby loses i’ll probably like him more than if he wins, i feel like he’s more of a sore winner than sore loser based off his camera personality
I hope this time it goes as respect.... i think they might respect...
Good luck gona b fights of the year for sure
Hope Chandler doesnt throw blind overhands from close range again..hes got all the tools hope he fights smart
i don't think trevor wittman has to leave the side of the octogan just have a seat reserved for him saturday night
Justin with the leupold shirt lmao true good ole white boy🤣🤣
Trevor wittman card
The Wining is chandler,usman,Rose,alex perriera
Thumbnail Colby is bout to drop the hottest mixtape of the year 🔥🔥🔥
Colby doesn't show respect because showing respect doesn't sell the fight . but there both phenomenal fighters.
2:30 bit sus coach
I just dont like chandler he thinks he deserves a Titel chance after he beat gaethje... get real dude you hat 1 fight in the ufc, that you lost.
3:34 👍😂
No pun intended 😂
I was hoping they'd do Gaethje vs Chandler as soon as I knew Chandler signed with the UFC, it's the best fight to make if you wanna see a proper war
Covington and Usman respect each other a lot if Colby acts like that is because he wants to distract Kamaru and sell this fight as well, both are great fighters and we expect more than the first fight
IF, and its a big IF, chandler beats gaethje, with all Justin’s hype… we’re looking at the future champ tbh
Colby wants another broken jaw
Trevor Wittman is definitely the main character of UFC 268
Gonna be one of the best cards of all time. 217 level shit
"The great state of Miami". Colby's such a dumbass
Dude got finished bad. How can he really trash talk…
Greetings nerds and virgins
I wouldn’t say the people’s main event, everyone wants to see usman Colby 2
Colby Covington will get *everyone* watching the UFC again for better or worse
Lol Colby gonna get rocked again. Can’t wait for his fans fade back into their shells until the next antivax rally😂😂
Why is Kamaru whispering to the tailor 😂😂
Colby is always must see cringe tv.
I hope Justin stop this little guy 😂.
Rose "I am the best and the best is blessed" Namajunas
Idk why, but I see Marty ko’ing Colby in the 1st round sadly
Kamaru is super humble. He doesn’t even know how to pop his shit. But he still a gangster
how is the gaethje fight more for the fans than the Usman Covington fight
colby so delusional its not even funny
Chandler and Dustin kinda talk the same
Lol at Colby being a supporter of racist politicians but then biting all his style inspiration from black culture.
Can't wait for rose to lose. Thats all
9:13 Colby "Cringe" Covington strikes again, undefeated
colby is such an unlikeable person
Mann I can’t wait!!!!
Coby looking Urban as ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn Rose lives in the town I was born in!
People are riding oliviera off like he doesn't deserve that shit. I was there. Chandler was cracking him with shots and he came back to win like it was easy. Poirier isn't a guaranteed win. Though I love Dustin, I don't think he walks through him like everyone is saying. Still wanna see gaethje vs Poirier though. If Chandler beats gaethje, it's going to be a toss up for the title. Those 4 are bad dudes. I don't see the Chandler gaethje fight being boring in any way shape or form.
Covington tries so hard to be hard and it just comes off as child-like.
Chandler has “Dana White Privilege,”  he tells Dana when he wants to fight for the title.  Let’s go Justin!
This is gonna be a great fight week, hope all these fights are absolute wars
Everything Chandler says sounds like he’s reading off a script.
colby needs to stay away from the clubs he doesnt know how to dance he moves hella awkward 😂
Usman promises to break Covington the other jaw . and  than send him back to Asia
Islam v the loser of gaethje v chandler lets go
Can’t freaking wait
Colby’s like the high school bully in the droptop convertible that’s not his calling kids dorks and then gets his ass kicked
Chandler reminds me of overeem. Solid all-around skills but always susceptible to a TKO because the chin just isn’t there anymore.
If revenge is your driving factor, you’ve got some stuff to work on.
I love Thug Rose, my favorite female fighter, but I could NOT watch a fight with her lmao constantly talking and saying “oh no oh no watch out!” Lol nope.
Chandler is cocky and overrated. He's talking like he's been in the UFC for 10 years. Smh.
Charlie
Trevor is a gangster
Covington‘s Trash Talk is just as Cringe when he rehearses it in the Mirror🪞
I can’t see chandler ever being the champ whilst Islam is in the title picture, the guys way above anyone in the lightweight division.
I'm wondering when does Colby get out of character... Must be exhausting been such a poser every time you're in public...
Ok i like justin after how he treated his fan
Really hope Usman beats Colby..he’s so fake and cringe. Usman actually has class.
How Colby had literally 10 sec of this entire vid and still stole the show is beyond me !
That's not even a G5 Colby
Our lord and savior Colby Christ Covington shall rise
colby looking like he droppin a diss track in that thumbnail BOOOOOOOOOOYYY!!!!!!!!!
Let's go Colby!
Trevor Wittman the literal King maker. He has Justin, Rose and Kamaru.
COLBY COVINGTON!!!! YOU ARE THE MAN!!!! GREETINGS FROM GERMANY
I hate is when fighters accuse each other of being scared to fight. Usman is not scared to fight you bro.
I like how Usman evolved, as soon as he settled in as a champ... This dog isn't about barking anymore, he is only in for the biting.
Usman will knock Colby into the nearest black hole.🙄🤦‍♂️🤡💩
Colby is chael and usman is Anderson Silva
THUG ROSE♥♥♥🥊🥊🥊
Thug rose !!
Charles Olivera knock Chandler fk out , he still talk about first round
Time for minimum 1440p vids cmon UFC!!
Usman will solidify he is the greatest welterweight of all time November 6th.
For how good usman is you think he would ko the fucking dude who dresses him lol
Trevor Wittman will go down as one of the greatest MMA coaches of all time.
People doubting colby, must not have watch the first fight where marty quit and needed a time out. Thats a tko.
Boy what a dandy!
Imagine only coaching 3 fighters and all of them are on the Main Card, fighting for a Title or #1 Contender Spot. Trevor Wittman will go down as an Absolute Legend in the sport of MMA!
3:34 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If that tailor ain't Iraqi
Kamaru is a great fighter but I think he’s colour blind. Let your wife chose the threads dude... 😣
colby was whoopin that ass and got fucked over because usman was manipulating the ref...these two dudes might be the most unlikable in the game, but colby is next for that strap.
Am I stupid or does Micheal Chandlers striking coach kinda sucks at striking
1:49 He'd still kill me but what kind of punches were those lmaooo
No pun intended lol Usman
Wow, how things change. I disliked Colby for his antics and Usman for being boring. Now I think Colby is a great entertainer and Usman is a great champion. I got Colby for split decision
Chandler is talking about getting a title shot he just had one we all saw how that went . Enough lip service
Can't believe I'm actually routing for colby.. and routing for rose and Justin.
UFC 268 is violence personified
Trevor wittman needs coach of the year award
It's weird that Colby does Black voice so much....🍞
How are there still colby fans ? Lol Dude is a bum wannabe vanilla ice trumpanzee. This shouldn't even be fun to watch dude got worked in the first fight and Usman has gotten even more deadly since then.
Yo that’s sus 2:31
The witman teams best asset is they learn to don’t telegraph. Rose against wei or Usman v masvidal and burns would be great examples
Colby is an American hero, just like his buddy Donald Trump. Together these men represent the MAGA brand.
Colby out here keeping White Boy Summer going 😂
& TAKE THIRTY-FIVE 09:15
I like Chandler as a being but to think he deserves a title shot after a win is kind of silly to think. Islam should face Daruish and winner between them should get the next title fight. Justin and Chandler can face the loser between Dustin or Charles for a possible title fight.
Did you just hear that?? 3:10 ,bet 20 bucks this guy did not hhear about Khazmat
Colby you can't put anyone to sleep lmao
Literally no one is calling Chandler-Gaethje the people's main event.  Good fight tho
🤔.... i like  Khaos & Kamaru
I’ll tell you something. Respecting your opponent is important on all fronts. There are a select few who actually have the courage to get into a cage with another human being and lay it all on the line. I like Chandler &  Usman’s attitudes. I appreciate Colby and Justin too. They know deep down it is not necessarily winning and losing as much as it is bringing out the best in each other. Putting on a show for the fans. The extra stuff (bad blood) is just a little icing on the cake. UFC 268 should be fantastic.
If Colby wins I'll eat my Maga Hat
Coby for best anime villian of 2021. He be like "what's driving me is revenge" lmao.
When Michael says “he think he’s the #1 contender” 0:30 had me dying because Justin earned his way to the top. He’s gonna run thru you easy. I have high faith you about to go in deep water with heartless Justin
Zero percent chance that Colby puts Usman to sleep
Colby lands in NEW JERSEY-  “Whats up, getting off the G5 we in NYC”  Uncle Dana obviously didnt think you’re worth the direct flight huh bud!?  How was the 30 minute taxi ride in that stinky towncar into NY?
Khamzat Chimaeve: ... loading ⏳⏲ 🐺
Usman's striking progresses from fight to fight. I can't see how Covington gonna win...
I really like Chandler and Justin.  Sucks one of them has to lose.  They are both everything that is great about fighters in MMA.
Usman, magnum zhang and chandler
Miguel with the lightning fast reflexes to switch to that fist bump 👊🏼
If Justin wins he is next, If chandler wins then Islam is next
Justin for the ppl
Usman is gonna dust Colby this time around I have a feeling. Rose wins by split decision and chandler wins by UD.
Rose gets the same cut i get
lol smart of UFC to use Donald Trumps favorite fighter as click bait!
No Michael, Its not a 2ND title shot next if you beat Justin
I hope Colby goes for a double leg in there first sprawl like he did with Woodley, if the rumours about usmans knees are true and with him seemingly focusing on striking with Trevor could be a good option maybe.
People’s main event??? Shut the fooook up chandler
I just hope Colby don't get rained on or sweat while wearing those fake chains cause the fight could get cancelled for having a green neck or getting his neck  infected
Bruh, Usman is in Baryon Mode. 😂
I don’t think chandler should get a title with a win on Justin honestly
Sorry for Spoilers but  Usman , Namajunas and Gaethje
Wittman and Co. for the WINS And please all be a TKO or KO, No decisions 🪘🪘🪘
Rose wears the pants.
Thanks for the video
Colby gonna sleep 4 sure
I’m beyond excited for the press conference
I wanna see colby win so we can watch a trilogy
Colby renting a private jet flight just makes him look so cringe. And I am a fan of him....
Take notes kids- Usman wins people over when he’s just himself. When he tries to be cool, he loses people.
Okay that was a good line by Colby to end the episode lol. “They say the city never sleeps, but hopefully they can make an exception because I’m putting Marty to sleep in MSG.”
Chandler talking about a title shot.. He just got slept by Olivera and has a good chance of getting slept this weekend.
I love Colby but that was SO corny 😂
I hope colby gets it done, that will be hilarious
cant help be feel creeped out when i see Pat Barry
Hope that orange hat ain't for sacrifice or enlightenment only time will tell I guess
What the hell is Pat Barry waiting for? Marry that woman already
If trevor whitman had a donkey come into his gym it would leave top ten pound for pound.
The contrast between usman’s respect and colby’s goofy doofy is stark.
those pants is whack
I dont think Chandler vs Gaethje will be exciting as we think. I think Chandler handles him. I cant see Rose beating Weili this time. Usman beats Covington I think. I think this fight delivers though
Never been a fan of colby but i hope he does get the belt
I can't fooking wait!!
Am I the only guy who can't stand Rose
Nooo way should Chandler get a title rematch if he beats Gaethje! That would mean 2/4 of his ufc fights are title fights..meanwhile Dariush? Makhachev??
Guess Colby wants other side of face broken oops...
Go Covington but I like the other
Feel like Usmans gonna lose.
I feel bad for Colby if you look at it as a whole…..he’s had to create this character that a lot on the roster hate him for….a lot of fans are with and against him.   He made the move/ decision very quickly as he knew he was being dropped regardless the outcome of the fight he was about to fight! Dana told him….so boom Colby created the character and his style of fighting changed all to follow his dreams!! Credit when it’s due…..he’s a great fighter and I’m intrigued to see what game plan / Strategy he bring this time! We all know Usman is an absolute beast and dissects his opponents. He’s getting better and better each fight. I do believe if anyone is to do Usman….it’s Colby. Excited for this card
I'm here for Colby
Pat & Rose = Dr. Evil and Mini Me
17 ads per 3 minutes of content...
Gaethje the man
This foo Colby serious?
Coby's so full of Shiite.
Who told chandler his fight is the people’s main event? Lmao I love that fight but cmon now acting like the main event we got isn’t insane
Imagine if colby actually beats usman we will never here the end off it🤦..
Chandler can’t possibly think he’s getting the next shot lol
Usman makes it very hard to dislike him lol
Been supporting Rose from her long haired days in TUF, and Kamaru from the Blackzilian vs ATT series. Proud of their growth. Discipline & commitment got them to their goals.
Lol what’s with the damn turtle neck shirts?
I think Colby and Kamaru will be friends (at least friendly) when they both retire.
The noises the movement usman doing everything to replicate canelo with his boxing lol
Honestly Justin is gaining a lot of unearned respect, he did a lot of good fights in the past but all he does right now is talk big when he had the worst performance ever in the history of people fighting Khabib. And the guy is not even active but ridding the glory of Usman.  If he wins, he will fight for the title again and gets beat again but if he loses he will be Kamarus waterboy, the best waterboy on the planet.
Colby acting like he has ko power lolll hes never kod anyone
In my opinion its crazy that a star like Thug rose lives in a house like that while the 15th player on a Nba team lives in a huge condo or has multiple manions.
I lose brains cells listening to colby yap! smh Usman by Ko in 3
I'm a huge Colby fan but I genuinely like Usman as well. His evolution as a fighter and man has been cool to witness
Justin will break Chandler…
Dustin vs Chandler would be sick, hate to see either guy lose
0:20 "People's main event"  Nah mate, that would also be Usman vs Covington.
Usman’s suit looks like a “Lumberjack’s Dinner Jacket”
Usman has NO style
I wanna see either justin or michael to vs Islam that would be a decent fight what do you guys think
you gottas love colvy
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!
The great state of m’aimai
No way is Chandler-Gaethje "the peoples main event." Usman-Covington 2 countdown video has more views than the other 2 countdowns combined.
Namajunes does not give off the vibe as champ. I feel she sells her self short.
Justin lookin like a Nurmagomedov or a Makachev for a minute there
Colby is a clown and Usman going to knock him out
Khamzat will eat you all for his low carb high protein snack.
Usman stealing Conor lines and now fashion
Crazy to think Chandler is 1-1 in the UFC, and literally thinks he's up next for the title lmfao.
Chandler is delusional if he thinks he gets another title shot this short after his KO loss. Even if he wins he’ll have to fight Islam for the title shot
Can’t wait for this card
no pun intended
fIINniSsh HIM!!
Colby reminding me of John Cena corny af ☠️awesome fighter tho
Colby saying he's gonna put Usman to sleep just sealed his own fate.
Gotta love Colby
This card has my bum tingling with excitement.
Hyped for this one. Please silence coby...
Mizzou
I can’t stand Coby , he look stupid , but I am happy cause I know Usman will broke coby face again .
Michael Chandler becomes less likeable Everytime the clown opens his mouth 🤡
somehow both Colby and Kamaru are way more wholesome than before the first fight
Wow 10 seconds of Colby the press treating him dirty just like they did trump
It’s pretty astonishing Trevor is coaching all three of them, but am i the only one who feels that’s too much?
Colby gets it done this time
3:25 Make Colby feel his size. Once you go black, you never go back.
Colby and Chandler and Rose win
"me vs justin gaethje the main event"? But Chandler is aware of what the main event is, right?😅
Welcome to the UFC Ben Askren. Ohh I am sorry Michael Chandler 😅
I hope one day Islam eats Chandler
don't care for Covington as a fighter but man do I like his politics!!!
Colby 😂
Don't know if why I would expect anything else, but I like that a fighter such as Justin Gaethje is running on the side of the road like any random middle aged man would do
Why does chandler think this win will get him back to the title picture? Isn't he 1-1 in the UFC? Jan was a champ and didn't even think he deserves a rematch after he lost the belt.
3 tough title fights for Trevor. Absolutely legendary‼️ I'm going Usman, Chandler, Rose...
With Usman, Rose & Gaethje all in the same camp its really gotta feel like they are going to war. No better way to kick it off than with Gaethje either.
I think I’m making Colby a favorite right off rip. Why? Because the level of awkwardness Usman will have walking around with his new boo Trevor Whitman will be too much when he’s around his ex fling and b.f.f Henry hoof and chandler
One thing is guaranteed. Rose will cry like always.
I think I can speak for most and rose is one of the last people I want to see go on a long drawn out war. We know she can and will win but I just want to see her win and take as little damage no matter how long the fight goes
I just dont like usman...he just seems fake to me...amazing fighter but theres a reason people dont really like him
The deja vu card.
Great card..
Pat Barry is a very unlikeable person.  He tries to take Rose's shine whenever he has the chance.
Hope Zhang gets booed again just for the heck of it
What a fucking card
3:35 yeah, I love me a street title bout
Kamaru don’t really say slick shit. But that trump line was slick 🤣🤣🤣
Ufc is a drug man. Fuckin love it. Love fight day/nights
So far for this embedded we’ve got some stupid ass shit off rip. And as surprised as I am that I still have some hopes for micheal chandler, these stupid ass hot takes are so cheesy/long winded and ridiculous you just can’t take him seriously. He really believes A: that he will fight Justin gaethje a guy who I consider to be unfinishable , stop him early enough in the fight to where he doesn’t take damage in order to fight Charles/Dustin in his words “the first quarter” of 2022 which is not only a long shot, it’s impossible and absolutely will not happen lol. Because regardless of win or lose, chandler going to walk out of that octagon (most likely in a stretcher win or lose because as much as I can’t stand usman, gaethje (who is a killer and has never had an easy fight) will ensure at the least chandler can’t walk because gaethje will break both legs and tear both knees just to make chandlers legs immobile. It’s a great mindset to have, but chandler homie, if you beat gaethje, the only guaranteed fight you could pull of getting is the real #1 contender fight vs Islam because unfortunately for u, and any guy thinking he’s got a title shot, Dana will force them to beat Islam first. As far as I’m concerned the only 4 men fighting for a welterweight or lightweight strap not named khazmat or Islam will be Dustin Charles kamaru or Colby. Because the two winners of those fights have already seen who they fighting next. Chandler may as well retire if he loses. Because he’s not getting another shot if he loses. If in chance he defys the laws of fighting and knocks out gaethje which again I don’t think is possible, he would not be next. He’d just be setting himself up for a tougher fight. If I’m micheal chandler I’m walking into Saturday with one goal, kill or be killed literally. And if my opponent is killed, I’m taking half the 50gs Dana giving me to pay a hitman to take out islam so I can then claim to be the #1 contender because sadly the leg huggers reign isn’t over and just like everybody else, chandler vs Islam would be short and sweet. Why? Because it’s not skill in sambo striking or wrestling guys have problems with vs these dagestani leg huggers, it’s their confidence. Dummies like hooker, gaethje game plan around they weaknesses instead of honing they strengths and walking up and punching these ugly looking no ears having ass mothafuckas. The only guy who proved to be somewhat of an issue to khabib was Conor. And he did exactly what u need to do. Show ultimate confidence and punch them dead in they face. Otherwise if they don’t respect your striking they will literally walk all over u while they make love to your toes as they have both set of toes entangled in they ass crack as they making u look like a toddler underneath them
So cool to see Usman show Colby Covington respect like that. He’ll be remembered as a great champion even after Chaos takes the belt from him.
Colby is legendary as one of the only clean fighters in the UFC.  Nate Diaz said it best, everyone is on steroids
Michael " tony Robinson" chandler
Gaethje is a real one.
Nah Colby ur in jersey my guy lol
The UFC keeps on delivering. It’s pretty incredible actually. Can’t WAIT for this card!!
Usman is a beast but we’ll see an insane fight between him n khamzat 💯
i'm rooting for Cloby, but Maaan Usman is an Animal, The Beast !!!
I think it's odd nobody is talking about Beneil Dariush. He just beat Tony and is the mix for title contention. Even if Chandler or Justin fight a masterful fight Dariush is just there. Also we have Islam lurking in the top 5
Love how cool and nice Justin is with his fans, like he said it takes no effort at all to show love back to his fans
Colby didn’t take off his Vanilla Ice costume
Colby is the best heel of all time, I love it.  Somebody has been listening to his uncle Chael
Lol its hilarious that Colby trains at a mostly Brazilian mma gym .
Usman is more meaner badder then the first fight
Ozzie went from eating bats to coaching Michael Chandler 🤦‍♂️. Talented......
Micheal chandler don’t sleep on Justin
Dustin and Chandler would be a war. I just don’t feel chandlers chin is up to par with Justin or dustins. He’s a savage everywhere else
Man, i rocks with Mike but number 1 contender will be winner of Islam vs Dariush
I'm tired of this revolving title shot BS Chandler should have started at the bottom and worked up.  Justin losses to Khabib and still thinks he deserves another one Weili gets to fight for the belt she just lost WTF.  I want a real competition
This will be the 1st UFC event I have ever attended, been watching since UFC 1 when I was a teenager.
Co main a main
GO GET EM COLBY‼️👊👊🇺🇸. Vinny 🇺🇸
Colby and his delusional fake character. And his Casual fanbase🤡
3:24 size matters
At 3:44 there’s a sign that says “PED xing”   Jon Jones must be in town to watch the fights
I really like chandler but it ridiculous he thinks he deserves another title shoot if he beats Justin , you got fighters with 9,7,4 win streaks that deserve that shot
Colby’s getting his belt back
"They say the city never sleeps, well hopefully New York makes an exception on Saturday night cause I'm about to make Usman go to sleep" 😂😂😂. Line of the year
That guy met justin and made it on embedded !!
Chandler thinking he get another title shot with a win over Gaethje, does not know who Makhachev is...
Khamzat kills all in welterweight
POOR COLBY DUDES A WALKIN DEADMAN
billy q burgos fight being crazily overlooked shows how good this card is
Crazy how Chandler thinks he should get a another title shot if he beats Justin!?!? Islam is on a 9 fight win streak he deserves it
Micheal “the fans wanted this” chandler.
Colby had practice on that last one
Usman is legit no doubt. But he’s arrogant as all get out.
Islam needs that title shot 🥵
I like Colby for this one
lets go brandon
09:16 they say this city never sleeps but hopefully they will make an exception when I sleep Marty on saturday in Madison Square Garden
i like usman when he talks sense,respect.
chael thinks everyone should be a heel, but i don't think that's really what sells these fights.  not a big fan of Marty, but seeing him speaking like a gentleman sure makes me like him a lot more...
The ufc was not gonna strip usman for a second that is the wackiest trash talk I’ve ever heard haha
Michael chandler carries himself so well and is a brilliant speaker. Would like to see him commentate for UFC in the future.
Chandler thinking he’ll get a title shot after this if he wins—-> 🤡
Just so nobody is confused I want to clear up that Miami is not a state.   The only thing real about Colby is he is legitimately stupid. That part isn't a show.
Chandler won’t win against dustin, nor Islam, maybe gaetchje but prolly not
islam to fight winner of Justin and chandler?
yo justin, you are supposed to run on the other side of the road
The city never sleeps
2 weeks of Embedded in a row? Christmas came early
Everything about rose is perfect apart from the fact she has no hair
I hope chandler utilizes more of his wrestling in this fight.
I'm so hyped for this one !
Colby!   Rose!  Chandler !!!
Colby says he putting someone to sleep........he aint gotta finish to his name tho😂🤣
There‘s no fcking way Chandler gets the next title shot Even if he knocks Justin out in the first second
Colby: We just landed in NYC.. no brother, Teterboro is in NEW Jersey...
Trevor wittman= you're defintely a good striker.
What a statistic from Chandler. Won a round in a title fight 🙃
Lets go Br4ndon!!
Jeez 🤦🏽‍♂️ Colby Covington trash talks a lot. Might not like him but he's definitely a good fighter though. Usman is really going to put him to sleep this time around. They're just not on the same skill level anymore. Usman has way better ground game, striking, stronger chin and now body kick combos. The only issue i have with Usman is he doesn't check calf kicks which Colby might exploit but won't make any difference
Even Kamaru's shit talking gets better. Really starting to like this guy, he fucks everyone up. Would love to see him against Thompson.
I got Chandler, Rose, Colby goin into this card 🥊🥀🇺🇸
I love when Kamaru is just himself he is so charismatic and likable. When he tries to act like a McGregor it is so off putting and disingenuous. I hope he continues to just be himself.
I didn't recognize coby without his trump hat
Anybody Know Name Of Song At 5.47 Please
So Kamaru left Stanford MMA because he could not get quality one on one with his previous coach. But his current coach will split his time between kamaru,rose and justin fighting at the same card... WTH?!!
Lmao Colby’s pulling up wit that same energy Jorge did in the 2nd fight with Usman 😭 boys gonna get beat way worse than the first one.
Trevor wittman the goat
Usman is right. Colby puts on a front but deep down he respects Kamaru.
Usman probably has some good tips about his old teammate chandler.
Why does Marty having another male , I think , taking pics of his ass in some confused looking pants😂😂😂😂
Gaethje all day deff one of my favorites along with Rose. And fuck Colby for making me pick usman again
Pat Barry's reaction to rewatching that headkick KO is hella dope!! So much intensity! LET'S GO ROSE!!
More colby
Like two seconds if Colby? Wtf
Justin vs Michel could be it’s own main
i could not watch these videos if i was colby waiting to fuck a metaphor or whatever, think how many people get better at freestyling each time you hear them in Rapping for example.  Colby is just bad at talking but he still try's with no progress and its almost the best thing about him. its Mind Bottling or is it Mind Boggling I dunnobut its on my Mind
Putting Colby as the thumbnail instead of the champion Kamura usman says a lot of how far colby came. AND NEWWWWWW
Colby such a G.
Chandler you are assuming Poirier loses. Slow your role dude.
Go Colby!!!
Usman needs to man up and go up to 185.  Isn’t he tired of beating way smaller guys?  Although Khabib did that as well, never moved up to 170 because he knew he’d lose
What is chandler talking about lol. The people’s fight is Usman and Colby
Winner of Chandler/Gaethje fights Islam for next title shot IMO.
I think Usman is as close to a lock as you can get. There’s no real punchers chance from Colby due to his lack of power and I also don’t see a submission threat. Add the fact that Usman only gets better as fight goes on... I mean it even looked like Colby was gassing and Usman was hardly sweating. He may be the goat
i feel like usman discovered lately that colby was doing a WWE character to keep things interesting.
Wittman treble incoming. 2-1
Colby gunna get wrapped silly guy 😂😂😂😂
Usman was trying on some god awful threads
Usman is the type of guy to say "oh goody" when he's happy
What's with the pad holder having pippy long stalkings haircut? That is the gayest thing I have ever seen.
Lets see Who Deserves to Fight Khazmat and Islam. They are the Real WW and LW Champions.
Gotta love Colby 😂
Justin gaethje or chandler winner shouldn’t say they deserve a shot without going through Islam they’re last fight was title fight they loss
Colby in the thumbnail dispite being in the vid for 30 seconds. UFC knows who the draw is.
Islam should be next in the title picture, if chandler wins somehow because he just got finished in that title fight after just one ufc fight
man im still hyped up because of the last UFC event 2 days ago there is another banger event just a few days away !!! HYPED
Usman is going to win in the first or second round.... he is scary af
Chandler thanks he is the shit! But he ain't shit!
Chandler go to onix to train
I love hating Colby Covington.  he's like the Darth Vader of the UFC lmao
should never be gaethje or chandler for the title after this match - the winner should face islam and then the winner of that should face poirier/olivera, UFC need to stop this DANA WHITE chandler privilege!
Team Ian Garry
I have a love/hate feeling with Colby he's such a badass
Usman has ascended to Ultra Instinct
The real question is, did Kamaru Usman's barber make the move to Colorado to be part of champ camp?
I have a feeling we're all expecting a slugfest between Kamaru and Colby, but after realizing how reckless they both were in the first fight this one's gonna be a pretty tactical fight with not much activity.
Damn this could be fight of the year contender 🙏
9:15 i wonder why they blurred Colby chest??
They say the city never sleeps but hopefully they make an exemption Saturday because I’m putting Marty to sleep! 💤💤💤 - Colby Covington
I’m just here for Colby and Usman interactions
Bro i like Kamaru alot but Colby is repping that 305 so this one is hard🤔🤔
Chandler’s smoking crack if he thinks his bout’s more fan fav than Usman v covington 2
Let’s go Colby !!! And New!!!
Rose, grow that hair out gurl
Why Colby look like that suburban white kid that got rich parents but tries to act ghetto
Peoples main event??? 😂 you got KO and JG coming off McTap. STFU 🤡
Rose Namajunas is a badass
Shiba army
Winner vs islam for a title shot.
Justin Gaethje looks and talks so much like the apparently kid
Michael chandler I’m afraid I have to break the news to you! Unfortunately you’re not getting that belt even if you win this fight you will have to fight Islam and we all know how is that going to end !
I think Chandler, Usman , Rose will win
After Gaethje lost to khabib he’s been nothing but a tool so I kinda hope Chandler catches him hard. 🤷‍♂️
Colby covington is like that pesky car salesman at the outdoors lot you just wish would give you some fucking space...
Mike leave the hat outside the practice room
This is the first time we herd Usman be himself I feel like
NO ONE said that’s the people main event lol Kamaru is def the main event
When I hear Colby talking I get diarrhea
Kamaru was so happy with his trump joke lol
Every fighter ever "he's been avoiding me"
This is gonna be epic!
LFG !!!! CMON COLBYY !
Fantastic event, man, I can't wait to see it. The Jan vs Glover event was so impressive I even forgot this thing was also on the schedule.
Justin Gaethje reminds me of that one really bad kid in school that was skinny but always naturally strong as hell
Chandler doesn’t seem confident
Damn.   I like chandler but Dustin is too big for him.  I don’t see anyone getting Dustin except makichev
Lets Go Colby
Being chandler’s friend must SUCK. Guy probably comes into the bathroom and screams at you while taking a sh*t just to make sure your doing your best.
All 3 headliners are Wittman fighters
Kamarus pants look like my grandmas couch
trevor is going to struggle to get all 3 to win on sunday he should just focus on one
so hyped
I feel completely baited with that Colby thumbnail
Usman vs Covington 2 is must see tv.
3:40 Some Tony Fergunson's shit right here...
Justin talks like his nose doesn't actually work
If chandler wins I don't think they give him title shot unless Dustin beats oliviera which Dustin. Will beat oliviera.
💥268💥 I can’t wait
8:23 Usmans friend kinda sus
I dont think Chandler's jaw can handle Gathje's power, might be two broken jaws this weekend.
those pants on kamaru looked cool as sh$t!
I like Colby's enthusiasm, but it is unlikely he will be putting Marty to sleep. More like, the other way around,.
Usman vs Colby main event.  But chandler vs Justin could be the co main event
why Chandlers coach loading up so hard on those punches
How long was he waiting to use that Trump line
Lesssgo Brandon.   U already know
luv how usman und justin were confused, they were like: are we enemies? are we fiends??
Hell of a card.
There's no one more delusional than Michael Chandler 😂
Always like Usman...and believe he will knock Cobby's out
What was the brand of Colby’s hoodie ?
Chandler better have installed a new chin
Why’d they blur Colbys chain?
Yall sleeping on Colby big time. Can't wait for this Saturday.
Fucking Colby man Watta TROLL I love it brother. Get that title 🔥☄️
why is justin bigger than kamaru lmao
Tony the type of guy to sprawl when his granny hugs him
i used to like Rose but i feel like she has become arrogant and disrespectful to her opponent
Dustin vs Charles, then Chandler and gaethje both already had recent shot, so you do Islam vs Dariush for number 1 contender fight Decembers winner, then winner of Justin and Chandler for that first defense
Only one problem for Chandler. He’s facing Gaethje.
Gaethje is the People’s Champ!
Kamaru footwork looks crazy
Haha i love Covington / Usman word brawls.
ty
Quavers have more flavour than Chandler
Colby New Champ
honestly islam chandler might be a good matchup
Too snazzy? Too Snazzy?
Whether u have 1 fan or 1million fans u should always make time for them love seeing fighter not ignoring them like some do
Mr. Covington. I got a quick question 4 ya. After this fight Will you end up with a broken eye socket this time?
So Usman buys the cheapest possible suits. 🤣🤣🤣
❤ Thug 🌹
I can’t be the only that is really really overly excited to watch this card!
“A lot of People have been dubbing me and Justin gathe  fight as the people’s main event” said no one ever
This dude Michael Chandler just said his first round against Oliveira was 10-8?!? He had your back what are you talking about?!
Usman looking sharp
Colby landed in Newark and drove up to Teterboro 😂😂😂
👍🏼
If Colby doesn’t walk out to “Let’s Go Brandon,” by Loza, he’s missing an opportunity.
No way Chandler comes close to getting JG...  As much as I can’t stand the Texgerian, he will beat Colby Jack Ass.
Usman covlby rematch should be good but Woodley Thompson should have been good too
2:30 Trevor gotta chill out
Go puff is still a thing huh. Figured they would have been done out by the bigger ones
Justin so cool man
hey it seems like Usman is getting chill. I like that energy way more for him. cute Trump pun
Triple C training Zhang tho. She will be unstoppable!
Lol 😂 Colby be having me dead 💀. He’s literally a troll😂. He not putting nobody to sleep
Colby going to bring that belt back to MMA Masters and I love it - Hate either fighter or not. We are the ones that are lucky to see these guys run it back!!!
This is gonna be freakin awesome!
There is just no way Usman is natural, you can smells EPO like D.
chandler is as cringe as it comes
Thug Rose 🌹 That card is a banger !!!
Gaethje will do horrible things to chandler 😭
Chandler isn’t going to beat Dustin porier that’s comical to even fathom
What a card. Can't wait for this weekend. 🙌🏼
Justin Gaethje is the type of guy to beat the shit out of that type of guy
Coby's mascara game on point.
colby will retire after this. what a fraud
All those belts on the wall...man, what a legacy.
Chandler is so well-spoken, he would have a great career as a commentator after retirement.
3:45   Trevor Wittman : There's just a different environment right now in the gym 🤨  cuts to :  *Gaethje doing a handstand while kicking a speed bag with his feet*
Bro this card is going to be very very interesting.
Colby Covington for the win! Lets go! This card is stacked. I love being a UFC fan.
Oooohhh weeeeeeeee
Respect to that suit guy. We’ve all got a suit guy like that, telling us it’s good, even if it ain’t good.
Usman going to sleep Colby at the same time he did jorge Colby only gotten worse since the last fight
lol Colby tries so so hard to be cool. And he is nor cool.
2:09 Marty “Kevin Gates” Usman
I’m looking forward to Gaethje vs Chandler just as much as I am Usman vs Covington BUT I think Usman vs Covington is going to make me a lot more anxious
Chandler already angling for that commentary chair. Dude loves the sound of his own voice
10-8 RD against Oliveria, Sure  buddy..more like a 10-9
Lets fucking go thug rose!! 👊🌹
Who thimble down this, and why. This card is amazing
winner of chandler / gaethje should fight islam for the next title shot. or they just give it to islam at this point and go with daruish for the eliminator
Keep dreaming you're not going to get it Gage is going to kick your ass you too much of a show-off.
music of minute 5:48?
Chandlers saying he will beat Justin and should be next for title shot I think he's scared to fight Islam
What's up, what's up? What's up, what's up!
Trevor Whittman is the best coach in the world.
winner of chandler v justin should fight islam and winner gets title shot
Charles wins Justin gets the shot Justin wins Justin gets the shot.
Michael Who ? Spoon fed by Dana ! You herd it hear first.
And New… WW Champion Colby Chaos Covington!!!
Colby is not playing a character. He’s a legit douche bag.
That ending was 🔥 🔥
Saved the ufc some money on traveling 😂
No khamzat no party
Colbys gold chains look like Halloween jewelry...
155 is so insane!! Do Bronx, The Diamond, Chandler. Gaethje, Dariyush, Makhachev!! My god.. there’s gonna be so many insane fights in the next couple of years.
also suprised Ali isnt in the gym with usman
ngl i laughed when colby said the sleeping line with nyc/usman
Lol Chandler thinks he is gonna get a shot at Poirier before McGregor.. lmao that’s wishful thinking. Interim title is as far is this guy will go!!
damn Colby is corny😖
Chandler going into a war !  Insane , this fighters hunger !  Amazing card  Can’t wait !
D U M B Y   B O R I N G T O N   IS JUST DUMB, FAKE FIGHTER IN THE UNIVERSE, SHALL BE THE SAME SHAME, USMAN WILL SLEEP HIM ON THE 1ST ROUND, MARK MY WORDS...
The elevation in Colorado is no joke.  The manitou incline is intense
chandler gonna KO justin stiff hopefully knock his eye straight
It feels like the rose fight just happened Jesus.
If Colby pulls this off and wins, it changes the entire division.
This is going to be so hard for me to root for any specific fighter because I respect and like so many people on this main card
Usman not ducking you colby he will fight whoever is put in front of him you are a great fighter but I think Usman takes the win.
Usman seems a top top lad when he is not being cringe. Great points on mutual respect. Obviously he knows colby puts up a fake persona to sell ppvs and deep down they both are top warriors with mutual respect for each other.
If Chandler thinks he's getting anther title shot if he beats Gaethje hes dreaming or delusional. Makhachev is next in line after Poirier, or winner between Gaethje & Chandler Vs Makhachev.
My predictions. Usman, Micheal, Rose
Kamaru waaayyy too big for this weight. Lol. He is huge. No one ever knocked masvidal out in his whole career and usman does it with ease..i call bs. He is on something. His veins are raging every time.
@9:23 Perfect shot of NYC and NJ... driver with no lights on at night...
I love justin such a nice guy, hope he smokes chandler!   Also colby is delusional if he thinks usman is scared of him.
Almost thought the thumbnail was fake news, had to watch it all the way through =/
I got zhang , Justin and usman , wouldn’t be upset if their opponents won tho , great card !
Colby is sick that man can fight
Marty hasn’t been as cringe so that’s good. But his sense of style is jus as bad.
Rose's TV is waaay too high. Weili can exploit that stiff neck
ستكوون معركة طاحنة بينهما 🔥 نتمنى ذلك
Put Chimaev in that card.
It's awesome to see Usman grow into himself. He's a calm, kinda corny, daddest man on the planet who's devastating in the octagon. His game does all the talking for him. He has the composure and mentality of a GOAT.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Funny  how chandler thinks whenever he beats someone he gets title shot 😂😂
Colby, gaethje, rose for the win
Colby is always convinced he is the reason for everything... bruh he busted your face beyond repair, you still look different. Metal jaw isnt going to save you from simply being out classed.
Gaethje was too anxious against Khabib. If he ever matches up against Makhachev, hope he stays more relaxed.
Super awesome to watch embedded two weeks in a row :-)
Ok chandler..
Pat Barry: *Fiance* Rose: close enough..
For Wittman to 3 champs out of 3 fighters he works with is truly astonishing. I'm surprised more fighters/trainers come together to have a much smaller camp so they can truly improve
Colby is the man. He gets thirty seconds of camera time and use his picture on the embedded promo.
This card is straight 🔥 can't wait for Covington to knock out Marty fake newsman
The most exciting card we had in a long time
Colby beating usman this time if ref doesn’t help usman 😂
Ok that trump pun from usman was funny 🤣🤣
2:40 got that convict cap
Does anyone skip chandler’s part in the embedded like you would do it for amanda nunes?
Is Colby supposed to be a swag lord now?
It’s scary that Usman is still getting better!! Hope Chimayev has at least 2 or 3 more fights before matching up with Usman. Hope it doesn’t wind up being a Mayweather vs a very young Canelo.
Usman, weili and Justin for the wins, 3 finishes
Imagine  Usman vs Colby is a boring grappling match Rose vs Zhang is a boring chess match Chandler sits on justin for 3 Shane vs Billy is lacklustre  Edgar sits on Vera for 3
Colby literally has NO fear of Usman, Crazy! That kinda of confidence, craziness and ability... Dangerous. I think this is one of the top cards ever!
Imagine Dana makes Khamzat the backup for the main event
I love Usman and I always get worried he might lose. But this dudes confidence makes me confident he will show up, show out, and still be the best in the world
Colby got WAYYY better at the shit talk it’s fkn hilarious now
Chandler holding on to that "10-8" round for dear life
A wise man once said, and I quote  “chandler’s the type of guy to give a motivational speech at a funeral”
Fook the jab and I’m not talking punches.
Lets go
Make embedded great again
Usman thought that Trump line was so clever Lmao.
Colby is delusional. How is Usman afraid to fight him when he’s been the more active fighter and was the last person to beat Colby like what ? Lol
Sorry brother I like you but khamzat will smash you bad
Thanks for the video, UFC-ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP
Colby 'Broken Jaw' Covington, will get KO'd in 3 this time 🙌🏼 Waiting for his excuses 😂
Colby looks a failed gangsta rapper, stop it Colby, no pun intended. We all know the history, that Dana was gonna kick you out the ufc because you were too boring, but now you're over compensating bro.
Fckn love justin gaethje
chandler is delusional
Trevor Wittman coach of the year !!!
Feel like the camera guys should just stick by Trevor Whitman at this point lmao
And still the Nigerian nightmare kamaru uuusmaaaan
colby tries so hard to be a bad ass. talk in the cage man. we know your top of the food chain good bro but its cringy
Min 8:37 John cena in the house... you can't see me...
"I'm putting Marty to sleep in MSG." Dude hasn't finished a fight since 2016(and no the Woodley rib inury is not a finish). Usman is gonna whoop him again.
Remember these guys are entertainers, the fight is real, but only business. May the best man win.
we're fucking lucky
Does colby have any mates?
You were stalkin him.....
Can someone tell me why Colby calls Usman "Marty?"
i dont think rose likes yan by the reaction to his win hahaha
I might actually pay for this PPV!
coby training in a gym with nobody, doomed...
I got Rose, Justin and Colby.
Refreshing to hear Kamaru mention that there's mutual respect between him and Colby whether or not it's said publicly.
😁😁😁 I can’t wait til the press conference. The weigh ins and fight Saturday.👊🏾👊🏾
9:14 💯
Yikes. Weili watching herself get knocked out with the most serious look. Rose watching herself win and laughing.  Hope she’s taking Weili serious.
Pat Berry: Rose you the best in your division Rose: you ain't
If you put Eric Cartman and the farther from American dad together then you get Colby covington
Love Rose's death stare.
Islam is coming
Haha you can see Pat Berry getting antsy when he see’s that head kick
I wasn't sure about Micheal Chandler before he moved to the UFC, but he actually seems like a pretty genuine dude! Will be interesting to see who gets the W on that fight
I’m an American. I live in GA and everyone and everything around me says root for Covington but I’ll be damned if I’m going for Usman. He is such a great guy and is a proper champ. Colby may be god guy too but certainly doesn’t act like it. I think I’ve just gotta go ahead and say it, let’s go Usman!
Are you serious? Instantly after 267 we get this banger??? Bless the MMA gods
i wanna see chandler vs islam 👀
Justin: “I’ll get tired no matter what.”   That’s what happens when your nose doesn’t work!! Fix your nose Justin
what a card..... cant wait
“They the city never sleeps but hopefully they make an exception cuz I’m putting Marty to sleep Saturday night” Colby is back 😂😂😂
Pat "And STILL... Rose Namajunas' Fiancé" Barry
People should just hammer Usman with Khamzat questions so he'll know that the reward for beating Colby is a fight with that monster. Might diminish his enthusiasm a bit or motivate him even more.
Trevor Whitman is the best coach in mma💯👍
Rose is going to get her ass kicked , all she is doing is watching reruns of herself calling herself the best while Zhang is got all triples C secrets
Expose Kamarus limited striking bout sick of  people respecting his fake pressure, hes got nothin after 1-2 fn roid hammers , not fair
If love it Colby gets the W but Usman is something else at the moment.
even if rose wins against weili, she still isn't the best
Trevor Whitman is defs getting awarded fight of the night
Never use to be a fan of Usman but Usmans personality has matured. Only a few years ago he was getting uptight when someone would call him by his old name. Now he's showing respect to his rivals and is more in control of his emotions. I'm a big fan now. I when Kazmatt is ready I believe it will be a very competitive fight. Still Colby is no joke and Usman will have to bring his A game
3:47 Tony Ferguson furiously taking notes
Chanderler will need another win if he beats Gaethje, why would they give him the same fight after 1 win, he needs to face someone like porier, Dariush or Islam for that shot
*Ready*
I was actually rooting for Chandler because of Justin's comments on Charles but after this idk who to go for 😂
3:47 Gaethje with the secret ancient training technique
Chandler talking only about himself as usual, and talking about beating people he's not even fighting. Meanwhile Gaethje's just doing the work and being as humble as can be at the same time
coby is copying jake paul now, with those chains??
Only way Colby wins is if he is on his bike throughout.  He was better during the first fight but Usmans physicality and power was too much.  Usman gets significantly better each fight so Colby likely doesnt have much of a technical advantage and has to rely on his physical advantages like his speed and cardio.
That colby entrance tho 😂😂😂
We need a new champ marty is too boring
LETS GO USMAN 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏻
Marty loses
Colby Bless Everyone and have a great day 🇺🇸
Colby rose gaethje
bro usman may have acquired many skills but that fake charisma will never be one of them lmao
Colby should not be fighting right now its only because the UFC pampers this guy since he's a white conservative republican Trump supporter he's going to get rocked again just like Masvidal kudos to Kamaru for that
Iggy got some little Otto bitty ankles calf kick him into submission Colby look at em ceo of epo got no meat on calfs bust that iggies ass
Colby is irritating because he tries to be, but he is still not as irritating as Kamaru .. I can't stand the way he speaks, his facial expressions, but also the fact that he tries to sound like a doctor of science .. too much self-assertive
I got Chandler winning 80% I got rose and weilie 50/50 I got Usman winning 80%
3 fights in the same night! And one after another, wow that's a lot work for Trevor
Greetings nerds and virgins
Lets GO CHANDLER!
Colby giving rapper vibes
I would have bet anything chandler was juicing but he looks just as good under usada. Dudes a beast
Usman is so evolved as a champion that he’s not worry about Colby and sees the man behind the persona.
MORE COLBY CMON
Best fight card of the new year
Listen , I know Colby isn’t too liked because of his trash talk & all that Trump BS … but in that cage Colby is A DOG ! He’s capable of beating Usman , no doubt about it. Looking forward to a good fight 💪🏻
Trevor Wittman will bring home 3 big wins and 2 belts!
Colby thinks Miami is a state…
Has Colby ever dressed in chains and street gear?
MMA GODS BE PRAISED!
I respect how Usman is not overlooking Colby like he’s no actual challenge/threat. I feel like it’s gonna be another brawl perhaps with some wrestling. Definitely looking forward to seeing those two go at it again 😃🍿
I've said it before and I'll say it again... I love the kamaru that's real and genuine but the kamaru that puts on the bad boy act and tries to talk shit and act hard is the worst person ever. Just be you usman and you'll get alot More love from the people.
chandler dont deserve a shot he just got ko'd he needs alteast 3 more wins if he wins this, he lost like last month by ko lol
Usman with the Trump jokes? That's class.
haha coby thought UFC would add some dope music to his last line, editor took a chill pill for the vlogs.
Kamaru Usman and I have the same Tailor.
Chandler gon shock a hol lotta ppl
wow i just realized this is this saturday. thought 267 and 68 would have been a few weeks apart.. hell yeah !!
Look how much mitt work footage they show of Chandler. A ton! Tiny nuggets in that footage. Multiple combos. They want their own guy Justin to win and this is the best way they can give tiny insights. The editors always give the 'UFC's guy' aka who they want, the less sparring footage. And no, shadow boxing is not even close to the same. Just footage of Justin running. That said, huge fan of both guys. Rose is straight killer and Coby/Usman. Damn best card in years.
Hey chandler, no matter what happens you are not getting that title shot with one W. If you do, dagestan will invade the US.
Calm kamaru is different
That clean Onyx gym with the belts on the wall is so sick.
Usman, Weili, Chandler....those are my picks
After fighting Jorge Mazvidel userman needs to fight somebody that's at least competitive
"That was the longest spar ever" Lol. Rose is a killa
Bro chandler does not deserve another title shot just after 1 fight
Talk about a stacked card!
Chandler is always campaigning to be prom king.
If Justin Gathje wins, he get's a title shot. If Michael Chandler wins, he gets Makhachev.
Am I the only one who noticed that thick ass snowbunny with the gaethje fan? Hellooooooooooooo Karen😍
Roses shit always weirds me out.
Colby 4 Prez !
“10-8’d Charles Olivera in the first round” OK MICHAEL
Mikey Chand is such a badass
I like how Michael Chandler said, “If I win I’m in a title shot, and I’ll beat Dustin Portier or Charles Oliveira for the strap”  He said Dustin first, basically picking him to win the Strap . We know what time it is lol
Will Ferrell looking good padding up Chandler
Colby is Jersey not in New York relax dude
3:46 lmao I love gaethje
Cocky ass Chandler still talking like he beat Charles. It'll be lovely to see Gaethje beat him this weekend.
Chandler has to take this fight to the ground,plain and simple.Gaethje is too strong with his standup game.Footwork,technique,timing,speed and accuracy are all in Justin’s favor.Trevor has turned Justin into a striking machine,lol I haven’t even mentioned his leg kick game.Just remember,straight punches beat overhand looping punches.
Any one else wanna see Colby win just to see how many excuses they come out with and how mad people are lmao
"The great state of the 305." I remember my first beer...
I hate that Dana drives a new Ferrari that gets delivered to him personally and the majority of his fighters don't live any better than I do. The fighters are killing there self daily for us and I wish they had more! I know they chose to do it but I think they deserve more.
Ufc camera crew are really catching a break because half the fighters are in the same city and gym
2:31
Seeing rose and pat living in a normal blue collar home is awesome but damn dana pay them
Colby is the people’s champ! Kamur is smug!
its nice to see everyones last embedded before khamzat murders them all
Yes the city never sleeps Colby…
That Trump pun from Kumaru was hilarious
Let's Go, Colby !!!!!!!
Khazmat gonna kill him
Colby prepared that last line for so long 😂
This card is so fire 🔥🔥🙏🙌
“You are the best to your fans”, except DC lmao
I have Section 100 Tix for UFC 268 Live @ MSG! So excited for this !  This is always the highlight of my year, I never ever miss UFC when it's in town in NYC
From Abu Dhabi to NYC back to back weeks. UFC is doing huge things
I would LOVE for CC to win but I’m not betting it. He’s a great fighter. I’d also like for RN to win but I want JG to lose 🤷🏼‍♂️
Dude kamaru is such a humble dude ! I’m rooting for Colby but damn why do people hate on Kamaru ! He is the best welterweight of all time !
DID THEY JUST SHOW a Private Jet in the backdrop with Colby & then only to take the BUS. This doesn't add up Bro !!!  LOL
SOOO HYPE LETS GO COLBY
I think Glover is 4 years younger than Trevor Whitman and just won the title, unreal.
Usman is disingenuous af 😒… but he’s a badass
I expect a bout like Usmam  Colby? Colby is gonna push the pace,& try a couple TD.If he stay away Usman  Colby is more active on the feet. & more accurate just no real ko power.heart says Colby command sense says Usman.
Colby, in the thumbnail, looks like he’s in that scene from belly, where dmx and Nas are walking in the club
😻🤲
I genuinely think Justin can beat Dustin , so hope he beats Chandler
Sanford mma is a really nice looking gym
have to skip over snoozeman or i will overdose from the cringe.
Epo usman... piss test the shit outta him everyone knows hes on shit
Chandler's chin is laughing so hard when he says "he will beat dustin, justin, and charles".
Trevor whitman is the mike dean of coaching
let’s gooooo
Let's go Brandon!
2 weeks in a row of embedded lets fuckin gooo!!
Yo no lie, I’m going with “vanilla ice ice” Colby this fight.
I just hope and 🤲 nobody gets seriously hurt 👨‍⚕️
Whos the huge pilgrim girl hitting pads???
Colby spending all that 'Bang' money for one trip to Vegas
Mike "FDA Approval" Chandler
2:30 im counting the minutes that turns into a short.
Kamaru trying to be mcgregor with the suits🤣
someone said why is chandler training with will ferrel
will never understand people training with hat on
Im still thinking who will do the backflip after the fight
How can you respect someone who fakes getting hit in the nuts???
i cant stand michael chandlers positiveness i hope he surfer something in real life so he acts like normal person
Colby you dont put shit to sleep in your fights. High output with changing volume but sorry sir your not putting to many guys to sleep in the UFC. Its just the facts bro 💯💯
2:30 Trevor's legendary Training 🧐🧐😂
Michael Vasconcelos THE GOAT
Idk if being taken down and getting your back taken for 3 minutes and then getting a knockdown is “winning 10-8” lol
Who's the "realest Ni**a" in the UFC ? Lol let me just cut this down to the two main guys..  Mike Perry ? Or  Colby Convington ? Lol
Just a man in braids throwing bombs
Why is Colby’s head sooo big
Guys I feel bad for Kamaru, Colby is going to hurt him bad.
Colby is HARD to watch
Man Trevor has his hands full in here.
I'll name my kid Colby C. If he wins tonight.on God
Let's go colby!!!!!
I broke your face 😂
Kamaru has become likeable. I hope he doesn't go back to his tiring thug routine
Kamaru usman a very matured human being
Usman needs to put on that pretty pink Dress at 7:38 to make his body look more feminine
Shouldn’t they have like 2 conferences by now?
Kamaru jacket for that suit looks fugly
Justin is such a god damn amazing guy. I hope he gets the belt soon.
Hope Chandler smashes Justin. Dude is a crybaby now days. Chandler/Colby for the win.
Lets Go Brandon!!!!!!
I HATE DANNA WHITE. U SUBSCRIBE
8:26 That pant fit ain't it, champ
Anyone wanna bet money that Kamaru gona retire if he wins? . He dnt want that kamzat smoke that's for sure.  I dnt blame him tho
UFC is on fire
training mama in a garage in the middle of nowhere would be nice
0:20 literally nobody is saying that... @MichaelChandler you are a bum go back to the G-league
Rose look like GSP 😂😂
I haven’t been this excited for a card since the last Rose card.
This best ufc  fight of 2021
Chandler is delusional. He does not deserve a title shot after he gets this win. He needs atleast 2 more wins on top of that
i love colby but usman is made of granite just look at the dude
Hooker got caught, and Chandler got the title shot. Shouldn't Islam get the title shot now? UFC is an American company, and it's okay to prioritize American talent. But at least accept that American fighters have priority over talent.
FIGHT WEEEEEEEK
Colby for ufc President!!!
Colby called miami a state, must still be dazed from that last fight with usman xD
I’m not a big fan of Usman myself. But I don’t think he’s gonna lose. I think he will go undefeated until he is done then have a great career in mma broadcasting or podcasting after. No one is gonna beat that guy he’s just not a normal human.
At least it’s guaranteed that we gonna see a backflip whether Gaethje or Chandler wins 🤸‍♂️
What a great card. Have to admit, i hope Usman and Zhang get the wins. However, i'm wishing a safe, fantastic fight to all the talented, incredible competitors on this card though. Well, maybe everyone except Colby. 🤣
Chandler I got kicks gaethje about to show them leg check kicks 😂
The city will sleep when Colby enters the ring!!
chandlers loss to oliveira somehow still seems like a win for chandler
Usman is a stand up dude
Man after this second and more dominant win over Colby, what more can be said about Kamaru Usman? We're watching a new man enter the greatest of all times debate.
I’m taking Usman, Rose and Gaethje to win.
Colby is a cornball but half of his complaints seem valid...he just approaches the situation like a BIA...GL
Gaethje v Chandler THE PEOPLE'S MAIN EVENT
nobody kamaru: I manifested that
Why did Khabib never have to fight anyone twice?
This has been said before, but nobody wants Colby to win
Colby is scared I can see right through that. 😂
7:27 he said Petr Yan
За Чендлера, Вейли Джанг и за Колби Ковингтона.
I want colby , gaethje , rose 🌹 to win but I don't underestimate Usman
We're def gonna hear that ny never sleeps line recycled at the press conference again lol
1:35 “finish him” in a high pitched voice 😂
Two of my fave fighters in the main event who put on one of the best fights I’ve ever seen.  Can’t wait!
Usman got is family behind colby got fake ass people behind him .
The black pants that Marty had on.🤮
Let the games begin
So covington talks out of his ass usman said he wanted to take everyone for a 2nd go to show his dominance in the division. So he took out masvidal already. Then covington. After this will he go at it again with burns. Or who. And oh that woodly and covington fight was trash. Everyone one knows woodly is not the same. Should have been vicente loque or burns.... Not washed up woodly
Totally rooting for Thug, Gaethje and Usman to win this week!!!
I love colby covington so much what a fighter and he says whatever he wants.
Really wannna see hooker a welter weeight
All that revenge and talk by Colby not gonna help in once that bell rings.  Usman in 3.
Chandler over here saying he 10-8 Charles in the first round. LIE. it was 10-9 on all 3. Trying to make himself look better🤣🤣 Gaethje about to smoke him💨
Making the embedded crews job easier 3 fighters from the same camp.
Colby Covington has been my favorite fighter for so long let's get it bro
I have Justin working Chandler over in this fight. You can bet Trevor W will have a calculated gameplay for Justin to follow and lead him to the promise land.
Hearing Usman give Colby respect makes me respect Usman I have never been a fan of Usman but that might change lol may the best fighter win 👊🇺🇲
What was Colby wearing in his neck that it had to be blurred out?
Colby look like a rapper hopping off the G5 like that with all them chains 🤣   Excited for this!
Fuck it I'm on the colby bandwagon move over guy I'm hoping on board choo choo
Colby fashion advisor must be his nephew.
Marty Fakenewsman getting TKO in the third!!!
Pat berry the biggest pimp in all of combat sports, my man!
Colby will beat your Harold and kumar looking ass
is the press conference and weigh ins open to the public?
MORE COLBY!
Colby is the most toxic and racist fighter in the ufc
Rose look like a dude
Snoozeman becoming likeable? Wtf is this... he's usually being cringe and copying mcgregor
Bruh the only thing that sucks about nov6 is i gotta watch these fights and the boxing ppv at around the same time lol
Colby has his Jake Paul starter kit on.
Back to back PPV baby!
i hope Covington's ring rust falls off first round, I'm looking forward to him taking this belt :D
best outcome of main event would be if they knock each other out
No Chandler no one thinks ur fight is the main event 🤣😂
0:55 Chandler that was not a 10-8 round, period.
Colby round 3 TKO
Let's go Colby
And new welterweight champion!!!
Tengo muchas ganas de ver ganar de nuevo a Justin.
Why do most of these guys look ahead so much 1 fight at a time man and it’s a good negotiation tools also
Anyone gonna talk about how Kamaru's suit didn't even fit properly.... looking like a linebacker with those shoulders
Try adding resistance to your runs, weights strapped ons or your back that kind of thing. To gas you out quicker push your cardio rate thru that wall. lol
Colby beats Usman Masvidal beats Edwards Dustin beats Charles Usman retires to let Masvidal fight Colby for title Masvidal beats Colby becomes WW champ. Diaz beats idk Diaz fights Masvidal for WW title. Diaz knocks Masvidal out.  Diaz wins WW title. McGregor comes back to beat Chandler & Poirier becomes LW champ.  McGregor has a pop at Diaz 3 for WW title , McGregor becomes 2 x champ again !!!
Lol Chandler you are completely forgetting about Islam Makhachev man common it shows how scary he is to all of you.
Finally the embedded is back !
I've become a big fan of Chandler I can't lie 😂
Somebody needs to fire DC from commentary team.. Thats need of the hour
if chandler wins he won't get title shot he will get islam 🤣
These guys in the main event are fighting and struggling for the belt. Khamzat would toy with these bums! 🇷🇺
The height of Rose's tv must be hell on her neck
CHANDLER FOR THE WIN.
What is as cool as "UFC fight week"?
In just one short year usman has become super likeable and Colby has concreted his cringe.
Can't believe we're getting another absolute banger of a card after last weekend. THANKS UNCLE DANA
Usman is so cringe
What did they censor at the end on colbys sweater?
Gaethje and Thug Rose hands down my favorite current UFC Fighters.  I’m so ready for this card!
after how chandler folded in his titel fight, im hesitant to belive he'll win. but watching gathje fold like he did against khabib, and I honestly dont see how he'll win either. whats the point of having decent hands if you have 0 wrestling? chandler better put his wrestling shorts on this fight, screw being flashy and entertaining. he needs to get a damn win to justify his big fat paycheck.
2:31 well then …..
Colby most dangerous when his back against the corner … ufc abandoned him and he murders Maia… now his entire gym abandoned him and here he his
Why should Chandler get a title shot after he just lost one??
Usman's a beast weather you like him or not
Thumbnail sucks
Why does Kamaru change his personality all the time, he was mad at Covington in the countdown vid then now he's all of a sudden nice... I'm confused af
I hope Usman keeps acting like this so I can like him, but he will find a way to ruin it at the press conference
Absolutely insane that we are getting this card ONLY A WEEK after that absolutely insane event in Abu Dhabi!! Can't wait man, UFC really ending 2021 with three crazy numbered cards!!
Chanlder touting him and Gaethje as the peoples fight.... You are literally parked behind Usman, Covington 2
Frank screaming '30 seconds!' at the end 🤣
I like how rose doesn't splash her money and buy unnecessary things to flex, regular house, regular tv, regular couch. It just proves that you don't need much to be happy
Dude. Usman at the top of his game. Mentally too.
Hope colby gets the strap
Rose is the best
Damn, pat berry didn’t say a word
Chandler going on about him and Gaethje being the peoples main event, no it isn't, looking g forward to it but anyone who seen Colby and Usman 1 knows that the main event, is the real main event
"Bout to get that belt, you can't stop us."  He did last time 😂
Rose is so beautiful she should let her hair grow
Does anyone else dislike chandler? 👎
Джастин гейджи 👊👊
justin learned the upside down speedbag kick from josh fabia
Legend has it Colby's first words were ''greetings nerds and virgins''
Wherea the best place to put a $500 bet on Zhang to win?
Colby putting Marty to sleep is Square Madsn Gwarden
Colby is gonna sleep Marty Fake Newsman and the trilogy will be the greatest trilogy ever.
Chandler says stuff like how is Islam number five when he beat one ranked guy, well Micheal you got a title shot of beating the guy he beat last also you believe you deserve another title shot after another win... hypocrite
Alright the trump gag was pretty good ngl
Chandler x Oliveira round 1 was not 10-8.
& we’re right back on the tracks to another chaotic fight card. No better time to be a combat sports fan
Looking forward to Micheal Chandler fight goin to be a tough one but great main card 👊
I believe whittman going 1-2 this time around
They only showed Colby for like 20 seconds😂
9:15 Look at him all happy after dropping one of his rehearsed lines
Cobe is going to be just like McGregor while Usman is beating him up Covington's going to be saying hey lighten up man it's it was only business lol
Can't remember Colby sleeping anyone - talking about sleeping the bigger & stronger Kamaru - ok!!!
I’m predicting Colby puts Usman in trouble and Usman comes back and tko’s him
people's main event is too much BRO!
Who is here for Colby's trashtalk?
mike 'i won the first round 10-8 against oliveira before getting caught' chandler
19 years in this world and I've finally found my dream job, I'm now a professional Justin Gaethje Supporter
the scenes if chandler and oliveira win and they do a rematch lmao
the saved the best for last colby covington got this
Gonna be interesting to see usman and Covington grapple
ISLAM MAKHACHEV gets the next title shot
Interesting how Wittman's guys do so much training on their own rather than with a partner. It's always just them and Wittman in that giant white room.
How can you not like Michael Chandler super humble and super confident!
Hoping for a covington win....
FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That coach of Chandler cannot throw a jab ffs
I like this humble Usman
Seeing the “respect” side of Usman is refreshing. Be great to see more.
Colby and Chandler will win.
How he can think Michael Chandler is next în line to title, în front of Islam M,this is crazy if is happening
Paddy walks through Chandler
That gold on Colby looks like it would turn Michael Blackson’s neck green
J
I wonder how many times Pat has accidentally yelled when he was with Rose " Im coming TREVOR" right before he came? Rose - " Pat, can I grow my hair now?" Pat -  "absolutely NOT."
Usman for the win
J
J
L
Can we take a moment and thank Uncle Dana for blessing us once again <3
3:47 Justin's NEW finishing move! Wow!
V
Wittman got his hands full... Jeeez luiiizz..
I want Colby to win so we can see another a rematch . Because those 2 are the best WW in the UFC
The Russians are making these guys look like ametuers , I hope Kamaru is the guy to slay khamzat .. no one in the lightweight division is going to handle Islam makhachev . These guys need to step their game up its a Shame how these Russians are so dominant.  I see no one defeating Islam or khamzat
7:58 Usman in that suit looks like big old Joe Frazer
I hope Kamaru isn't neglecting any wrestling training because Colby will probably try to include some this time in the hope Kamaru won't expect it after how the last fight went.
Usman championship mentality is insane
Colby may Kill himself after this loss, he can’t be humble after. It would kill the character he portrays. There’s no coming back if he loses again.
I cant imagine a world where Colby knocks out Usman. But who knows, Im excited 4sure.
Khamzat should be on this card as well since he’s fresh still
I pictured Michael Chandler as a gay bar owner and now I can't get that image out of my head
Please Justin KO Chandler, who ever wins get Kahbib fighter!
Pat Barry is a groomer..... that is all
Weili Zhang turn into a dude for this fight.
Covington gonna lose again,no doubt...
Colby's the kind of guy who makes a burn and then explains it moments afterwards to make sure people understand how smart he is.
2:30 ... SUS
am i wrong for thinking theres no better matchup for usman than covington?
Chandler is getting knocked out again
Colbys sayings are 90% lame lol but sometimes he says funny things. Still, I like him cause he tries. And while I dont mind Usman...He is just so lukewarm with the personality of a cardboard box 😜😜
I honestly hope Chandler doesn't get seriously hurt.
I genuinely dont hate colby, I would be quite interested in fact if he did win this weekend. But having said that, I just dont see any possible way he wins
Chandler has great plans.. to bad all of them will be crossed by Islam...
Those the fakest chain i seen yet
Everybody get rich and get bored start dressing like curtains.
Bruce buffer voice* iiiiiiiiiiits time! For 5days, of ufc, 268 EMBEDDEDDDDDDD!
Love how Justin said how much energy did that take after taking the picture with the fan just shows you how humble dude is
I honestly cannot wait for Michael Chandler to retire to announce fights. Don't get me wrong, he is exviting fighter to watch, but way better soeaker than Bisbing, DC or Paul Felder
Who tf funded Colby's jet?
Colby said “New York is the city that never sleeps but I hope they make an exception Saturday night cuz I’m putting usman to sleep” lol 😂🤣
My 6 yr old is as tall as Chandler. Without the small man complex too.
Please let me live long enough to see this event 🙏
Chandlers dreaming lol if he wins he fights Islam next
Colby is the king of cringe🤦🏽‍♂️
Why is this card the same day Canelos? I can't afford buying both. Well, Russian streaming will be.😞
Good luck colbyyyyyy
This card is sooper  stacked, gr8  way to roll into the holiday season, honestly combat sports in general is winning right  now, boxing is back and we have some young stars getting  the exposure they need and deserve. This weekend is loaded ufc and Canelo vs Caleb "getcha popcorn ready folks...... yessssuuh let's get it!!!!
Anybody Remember When Earthworm Jim Vick said Justin Gathje was only 28, punch drunk, and slurring his words but then JG sparked Vick unconscious?     Well JG won that fight but it doesn't mean what James Vick said wasn't true.  I love both fighters but  Ill take Chandler at a +170
Looks like Rose is either living very modestly or hasn't been paid properly. Her house is quaint.
LETS GO BRANDON!!!
Chandler may think he will be next to fight for title, if he wins with Gaethje. Let's not forget about Dariush, though. 7 wins in a row. He may be fighting Mahachev if UFC scheduls such bout and winner for that fight against Poirier/Oliveira. Point is, there are some people who deserve title shot first more than Chandler, who had his chance recently.
I think Islam should get the winner of this fight between Justin and chandler
Holding mits with fucking pigtails!!!!
Usman is huge idk how he makes 170
Unfortunately I think chandlers got this one BUT chandler vs Islam would be wild. Idgaf about poirier
It always amazes me how much of a balance Justin has on being a genuinely nice guy and at the same time being one of the most violent men on the face of the earth.
Gaethje looked much bigger then Usman, and is 155 PDS.
Chandler🔥
The hype on this card reminds of George’s last fight with rose and dillashaw on it . Team Whitman has to be major favorites
Chandler is so corny
Chandler trying to bate me with his bull 💩 theories.. Colby with bedroom cardio and one lines 😂😂😂
who remembers 30% usman
Useman a bad mann .but cobly can winn
I hope Usman wins, I cant stand coby what a bellend. Li wins and justin loses if he doesn't beat Chandler's legs up
Not gonna lie I only clicked cuz I saw colby with chains on
usman got the worst taste in clothes and suits lmao
i hope if colby wins he stops the cringe act
Conor had a purple suit just like that Marty… 🧐
Just think the winner of Usman and Colby might get the opportunity to throw hands with Kevin Lee, talk about pressure I wouldn't be surprised if they both try to lose on purpose.
Trevor got Usman dancin with his footwork
Colby obviously respects usman. But I wanna see usman get his head kicked off for the trump pun. It’s OK to be American no matter what people say.
Trevor Wittman is like being sick into your own mouth and swallowing, guy has great fighters not a great coach he’s over rated.
I want to like Usman because he’s a great fighter, but he’s just so weird
I can't wait to see Colby beaten and broken laying on the mat again as usman gets his hand raised again
9:16 does he actually believe that crap?
the thumbnail made it look like Colby is in a fuckin rap music video
colby is not putting usman to sleep. if he does then repect
hEY look at me Fisher Price My First Gold Chain
Hopefully more colby and gaethje next embedded.
I think Colby and usman should just let their ugly ass suits fight....so gross Idc if they are 10000$ fugly as hell
Colby is so cringe
LETS GOOOO
Usman's polo hanging on for dear life
I'm a 45 year old in with 8 years sobriety and a dad belly. I wanna go train with Trevor Whitman and have him teach me how to punch and fight. Arrrrhhhhhh!
What's up with these MMA media channels leaching off the UFC vids comments as of late lol
Colby " I'm low key gay and I need women around to look straight" Covington
Justin gaethje the type of guy to use a speed bag with his feet
why the colby's chain is blurred lol
Blah. Blah.. blah. Look you got a big L last time, Mikey. You gotta get thru JG first....I really hope Gaethje puts Mr. Punchable face to sleep!
Nah even if chandler beat Justin he aint getting the title shot right away
Go colby🔛🔜🔝
Every card has the potential to be the FOTY lol stacked
Justin’s a bum journeyman
I bet the hardest job for Trevor is keeping those two animals from going after eachother during camp lol.
"They say the city never sleeps, but hopefully the'y make an exception Saturday night, because I'm putting Marty to sleep" The City doesn't have to sleep for you to knock someone out. That  makes no sense. Perfect Cringe Colby though. lol
Jesus usman go back to stealing lines but fuck sell the fight!!!
Colby went from maga man to john cena lol
You have to fight Islam first
Colby will try to wrestle this time. But Usman is just on another level. And still...!
The ‘it trumps everything’ comment from Kamaru oehhh first joke/trash talking thing from him that I liked
No Ways that was a 10-8
IM FUCKING READY UFC!!!!!
if Covington would focus more on his game than his lame WcW promos, he might be able to compete. Fights over tho, Usman too big too strong.
I like Colby but Usman is just slighty better everywhere, he gonna get the W again I feel.
3:11 is that a punch doll of Trevor
Fan boying in front of your chick lol
Good episode. Chandler came delusional. He wont beat Gajche let alone Poirier.
If chandler wins, islam is on line for Title fight, if justin wins we will fight for title… no was chandler gets e 2nd chance that fast
I skip over Kamarus parts of the video… dude is annoying
What a card!
How can a man dislike Gaethje? The man's a absolute Legend I really hope he takes the win although Chandler is also a very likeable fighter
Trevor Wittman with the MMA triple crown.   Could you imagine being behind 3 champions.
I don’t think chandler deserves another title shot soon at all. There are so many other guys that should get a shot or that he has to beat.
No wonder Colby acts the way he does…. He’s living in Florida!!
Chandler deserves if he win justin the title shot? What about islam? He deserves title shot more than michael even if he wins justin.
I don't think either one should get a title shot regardless of outcome. ISLAM DESERVES TITLE SHOT
Honestly what's taking so fucking long, this fight build up is dragging,  be fucking Christmas soon
Covington still talking slick🤣😂well the jaw still works fine buuut you still got beat up🤷🏽‍♂️Usman you can at least pay for the wire for his mouth and have ice packs ready for him this time🤣😂🤣😂👊🏽
chandler really think hes getting another title shot islam is the next one
Gettem Colby. Can't wait to see this fight.
Я болею за Усмана
Finally Usman acting normal and not like Cool J… I like Usman a lot better when he’s not acting this fight should be fun
I Hope Colby beats Snoozeman 💥🥊👍 Rich from the 🇬🇧
I can see Chandler going heavy on his wrestling after eating a few leg kicks. Could spell disaster for Gaethje, given his lack of groundgame.
Imagine, getting your jaw broken then getting stopped and STILL have the audacity of being that level of a disrespectful bitch towards kamaru
I love Michael chandlers energy
When did Kamaru become so charismatic? These vlogs are gold as always
Covington comes across as extremely insecure with all his jibber-jabber.
They edited out Colby's Bang Energy Bling. 😂😃😂😃
You don’t but you deff get Islam
Ok- STOP SAYING VERY WITH  JAMES?! 🤔 Dammmm I’m very very very hyped!! for Saturday 👍🏻  🙏to UFC
Why he call him Marty lol
“Dana white privilege”
Here for the culture
How sick was that McDouble cheeseburger 🍔 Yan gave Corey with that spinning back fist and the follow up.  Holy F*ck that fight was sick.  Yan is ELITE AF.    After the Smesh Factory vs the a world card,  boom into this fight week.  We are spoiled as fans lol
Colby is a nice guy. Always been a fan. Like Conor he knows how to put asses in seats, but away from the cameras to normies like me, he’s a nice guy. I met him in passing while waiting for a flight. I got his autograph, chatted with him for 20-30mins and he took a pic with me. He didn’t have to do any of that. I thought he was gonna tell me to F off. He didn’t though he was cool.
UFC 268 on one screen and Canelo v Plant on the other
Justin needs to shut Chandler the F up..
Just imagine if Colby wins.. ahhhhh
2 weeks of ufc embedded fuck yeah!
Trevor Wittman Coach of the Year 2021
I see chaos in the thumbnail I click faster than lightning.
The fact that Colby has a fade, is wearing a jersey with a Goldlink will ever not be funny. What a character
2:52 Lol this is the first time Kamaru Usman looked sympathetic
Pat Barry gets visibly hype while watching the promo lol
so crazy to have two ppvs back to back weekends. has that ever happened before?
colby didnt use his fake tough carachter since fighting woodley, looks like he doesn't know what to say anymore, just like connor, irrelevant.
Being a die hard UFC fan and having seen so many killers come through the sport I don't know why but Colby Covington to me is the scariest opponent on Earth.
Former PFL champ Justin vs Former Bellator champ Michael
Usman really is the most active champion in the company. Thay says a lot.
Lets fucking go Colby!
Hope chandler and colby win !!!
Chubby chandler wanting a quick route to the belt. If he beats gaethje then give him makhachev
I hope i heard chandler wrong when he said some ppl think his fight is the main event. Love the guy, but cmon
I’m a simple man, I see Colby Covington I click
Colby should absolutley show usman respect after he takes his belt
Let’s go Brandon
Coach Trevor is a Goat. He made Kamaru's striking deadly.
Although I wish, I don't think this fight will be even competitive. Usman is just on another level with Wittman now.
Chandler no one cares that you beat Oliveira 10-8 in the first round. You lost the fight and that’s it
Man I like chandler but I hate the way he talks…
I really want Colby to win.
Usman look like he got weak legs. People should throw leg kicks at him
Video starts at 8:35
Colby "THE GREAT STATE OF MIAMI" Covington
Justin Rose Usman ✔️✔️✔️
Miguel looked like his hand was hurting after that fist bump lol
Mike acts so entitled. Hes had 2 fights in the UFC and thinks he shouldnt have to work up the latter. so annoying
4:01 crazy to see jon jones out there
Colby is a legend
Colby pulls out and khamzat gets in . 🎉
Colby out here sounding like J Rock.
This is gonna be epic. Im glad chandler is here
2:31 that’s what she said
Crazy how Usman has become so original and likeable since he’s been with trevor
Usman going home in a bag
No way chandler gets a title shot after this even if his dominates Justin he still need one more
big fan of colby but big props to usman for showing respect to colby made me really like him awesome usman
Focused Usman is a scary site ! Usman by tko early
Kamura Colby Michael and Justin all former collegiate wrestlers ima have to join my community college wrestling team
Rose Justin kamaru  Same gym  Their coach bout to take a huge L All three gna lose 😂😂😂
I hope Colby gets to become the ultimate feelings champion
I wonder what was blurred out on Colby's shirt
Gaetjhe,  Rose and Covington.  Screen shot this one I'm calling it first.    Then the Rubber match Usman sleeps Covington to get his belt back.  🤷🏻‍♂️
Wish Rose would grow her hair back out she gotta big dome
When was the last time Colby put anyone to sleep
Noone deserves the next lightweight title shot than Islam Makhachev!
Trevor Wittman should get Proformance of the night, hands down!!!!!
bOoTsTrApS
@ufc aren’t you guys being bias by not including Weili in the description? Smh
Dana gonna be on suicide watch if Rose wins again 😂
Thug 🌹 gonna put on a spectacle again baby!!!!
I feel like Justin’s nonsense will ruin rose and Usmans concentration! He’s a doofus.
This press conference should be fun
chandler and rose skip button please
let s go
WHEN CHANDLER SAID MANY PPL ARE CALLING HIS FIGHT THE PEOPLES MAIN EVENT WHAT HE REALLY MEANS IS HE WAS WATCHING ARIEL HELWANIS SHOW AND WHEN HE MENTIONS THE PEOPLES MAIN EVENT IT SOUNDED SO COOL TO HIM HE HAD TO USE IT TO EXPLAIN HIS FIGHT BC AINT NOBODY CALLING THAT THE PEOPLES MAIN EVENT WHENS HES ON THE CARD WITH USMAN VS COLBY
Colby is a legend
There's not a single person calling Chandler and Justin the people's main event
Maybe one day in the future we will look back at some stacked cards like this one and say "They don't do this stacked cards anymore, the starpower is so high back then."    Appreciate this moments, who knows maybe one day this will all change.
Huge upset is Colby wins
Hoping Chandler gets it done. A fight between him and Dustin would be 🔥  He might be the only guy in the division with the strength to stop Islam doing what he does best as well.
Colby, please win. It's been an rough year, it would be good to win one.
Im so fucking pumped for this card. First marty vs colby fight was one of the best fights Ive seen. I think colby takes it this time.
Chandler talking about how he's gonna beat Dustin Poirier or Charles Oliveira in the first quarter of 2022, sounds to me like he's looking past the guy in front of him this weekend. Justin Gaethje ain't no joke..
Pat "the child groomer" Berry
I feel like Gaethje got a stuffy nose allllll the time
Juicing is getting the usman crazy af
Khamzat is the fighter that nobody wants to fight.
Nothing against Wittman because he is the shit. But it's hard to imagine that all 3 of his fighters will get his undivided attention this weekend.
I'm rooting for Rose and Colby.  Rose is my favorite UFC Fighter.
No pun intended was a great line
Kamaru Usman is p4p low talker.
So we aren't gonna talk about 5:10
Usman is getting moring likeable every fight. He knows he does not need to trash talk now. He can be real.
I can't stand Chandler, idk why I just hate that dude
The winner vs islem 👌👌
respectful takes from the champ usman
Why does Usman go for such horrible outfits despite having a really good physique?
I wonder who's telling Chandler all those lies that he'll get a tittle fight if he beat Justin, that's if he can. Islam is the real deal my man
Colby is possibly the biggest douche in America right now
Steve-O is coaching Chandler😂
Colby looking like vanilla ice 😂
Justin “Scissorfeet” Gaethje
Damn Usman is chilled AF. Guess Coby will be smashed
i see usmans head is getting bigger, not just his forehead , his whole head.
ufc 268 will be one of the best !
If chandler wins and  gets a title shot right again( like he thinks it goes) i will stop watching mma, like islam said they both fought for the title. Winner against islam for shot is okay
Trevor Whitman gotta be coach of the year if he pulls off three wins here.
I'd love a random ass clip with Justin gaethje being ridiculous with me
The antics are cringe but Colby can fucking fight i still think Usman will beat him though
Colby’s face on Embedded 1.  I’m watching right now!
GO USMAN...............lol
colby aint going down this time its going to be fight of the year.
Good Lord NY looks like a shit hole!
Best jab in the welter weight division?
I cant stand Colbys persona.. but during that 25 minutes, hes an elite fighter. I cant help but cheer for him.. got a feeling Usman is gonna do him like he did Jorge. Cant wait to find out
Colby has persona to be the best trash talker and best fighter at the same time
Chandler gets Olivera in the rematch but he’s not beating Poirier, not at this stage.
Justin wins tko 2nd round and he’s gonna fck chandlers leg up. Kamaru wins by split decision  Wei li getting a 3rd round KO
These ufc cards have been crazy
Islam is the truth. Read the Qur'an
Notice how every one is talking about their opponent, but Chandler keep looking forward to other people. That’s not a good thing.
9:15 someone’s going to sleep on Saturday, but it ain’t gonna be Usman
GAETHJE MY FAVORITE FIGHTER
4:03 PED KING
Hope Buffer gets back, because it's not the same without Bruce😔
Protect this card
Kamarus joke was pretty good lol
I like this Version of Kamaru seems Colby isn't the only one being a Heal
Wittman and co going 3-0   Saturday can’t come soon enough LETS GOOO🔥
After Usman vs Covington I really hope Khamzat gets the winner! That dude belongs in the conversation.
Kamaru Gathje  Namajunas  Whittman fighters clean house 👌🏻
This is a dangerous class weight to be right now because of khamzat, he is there to smesh and w.. does not matter which one pace he can defe
Nice! Usman with a Trump reference.
feed me those back-to-back embedded and crazy cards
2:30 My wife Giving me some kudos after sleeping with her.
Colby!!!!
UFC should have cards that are all one gym vs another gym.
Colby please win I’m tired of these usman fans n I want 2 c another American champion
Marty juice man
Lets hope either Usman or Colby pulls out of the fight so Khamzat can jump in
Usman is showing respect to Colby,Colby is done
I want Islam vs winner of Justin Michael
Colby covington kamaru usman respect each others game deep inside.
Such high level fighters, with relatively similar styles, and are evenly matched. What a card man.
Chandler is nr1 Bullshit !
Usman Rose Gaethje Burgos Edgar
First comment!
Colby looking like Chet Hanks lol
Ah Colby will be Colby, good to see him back.
fk it bring khamzat vs neil magny in as co main !!! he didnt get punched once and magny was in training camp for 6 months lets go
Chandler won't know what hit him
Kamaru is a nice and wise killer
Trevor Whitman 3 - 0 other coaches  … find me and break my balls if it doesn’t happen this way on Saturday
This main event feels pretty irrelevant...Khamzat would easily smesh both of these guys in the same night...just line 'em fake gangsters up for King Khamzat!!
lol the peoples main event is OOZEMAN VS COVINGTON
Let's go Colby
Zhang looks like triple C with his haircut 💈
colby finally got his speeches coming out crystal clear lmao no slip ups yet
Trevor should've just let them have at it😂😂
Am I the only one who wants both Chandler and Gaethje both to lose and never sniff the belt?  Chandler says the same generic crap and gaethje is an idiot meathead who apparently doesn't think grappling is part of mma.
Gaethje is very good in stand up fights ….. he ended tony ferguson’s 12 fight win streak …
hellyeah.
3:47
Kamaru is hilarious
Marty fake newsman
Colby new champ
Does chandler really believe dana will let him immediately back at the title shot like that?? Gotta go through islam buddddd
back to back paperview lovely
this is his again I support him but thinks he will lose the same
SCREEN THIS: ME AND THOSE WHO LIKED THIS COMMENT, WE'RE NEVER WATCHING THE UFC, IF CHANDLER GETS ANOTHER TITLESHOT AFTER JUST 1 WIN...
Who the ruck says Chandlers fight is the people main event, hell outa here. We all want to see Usman put work in or get worked on.
Having Trevor Wittman is like a cheat code, no matter who you are, you are getting way way better with him, I like Colby but he doesn't have this level of coaches around him, and you can't really close that gap in knowledge, Trevor is the best, I wish Colby was training with him.
UFC was to scared for a press conference with Colby “Chaos” covington
Chandler:  People are dubbing me and Justin as the Main event. Me: Dude you're on the usman colby rematch card. No shot bro.
Islam vs winner of chandler/gaethje and the winner of that vs winner of oliviera/porier
I can’t freaking wait.
You can see greatness coming out Trevor Wittman's pores....!
let's see some more justin and nelk collaborations
These should be 15-20 minutes long, in my opinion. I love every moment of embedded
Would like to see the winner of Justin and Michael fight Islam for the next title opportunity, after Poirer.
Usman by TKO in round 3.
The Kamaru and Justin friendship is underrated.
That last line by Colby was corny as hell. Almost outdid all of Marty’s cringe press conferences.
Colby will be champion ☝
How many and newz we gon hear this weekend?
Rose looks like GSP wtf
Chandler can make a better commentator than a fighter
I like that Usman shows respect to Colby. He knows it’s ‘only business’
Team Colby
Colby in the thumbnail looking like he in a rap video
Sort of reminds me of when Whitman coached Cyborg to victory over Nunes.  Oh wait, Amanda shocked the world.  I'm thinking Colby gets this one.
Rose 🌹 is a proper bad ass. Looks like she should be in the men's bantamweight division. Feel sorry for Pat not having no hair to grab ahold of in the bedroom.
Let's go Brandon! Colby dropping gems at the end
man if justin rose and usman get it done in impressive systematic fashiom that would be unbelievable for trevor
Kamaru will break Colbys jaw. Permanent damage.
Chandler, the only fighter besides Bryce Michal wise enough to speak out against this Covid agenda.
Would love to see ALI abdulaziz vs Wahlid ismael
Why do we always get gangster fake thug usman when there is this guy? if he dropped the gangster mentality and acted like Marty, he would have a lot bigger fanbase.
No way Chandler scored a 10-8 round against Oliveira
Go chandler!
More Colby
Let's go Colby.
No one is calling Chandler/Gaethje the "People's Main Event".
colby the funniest dude in the UFC
the UFC has missed colby
Colby only pulls out in the bedroom never in the octagon 👊
Justin *dying* Fan: I have a photo with you from 5 years ago... Trevor: just give him a second (he’s literally dying) 😂
the city that never sleeps lol Colby swish
If Dustin and Channing tatum had a kid he would look like Michael Chandler
How did he beat him 10-8 in the first round? He almost got submitted iirc, did judges actually give him a 10-8 for almost finishing Oliveira but almost getting finished himself? Or is he just saying that?
Talk is cheap
Im even more hyped  about this card than i was last weeks card
Why is Pocahontas hitting the pads?
I wanna see chandler vs Islam.
Kamaru's reading the comment section so he knows what to say lmao
Nobody gonna talk about chandlers striking coach hitting pads like a straight amateur?
2:45 this is real Usman and people need to give his credit for this
Nobody should be the #1 contender without beating Islam, period.
Colby asked Dana if he can film a scene on Dana's jet.
Just saw Colby grabbing that buss down miami cuban link! Lets get it Champ!
chandler might get Ko'ed....🤣😂😁 See pat get amped from that highlight, he's got her back. Hell and back kinda guy.
Islam about to smoke everyone in top 5
Gaethje and Usman look the same size. Difficult to believe they're in different weight divisions.
let's go Brandon! team colby lol 💙
Colby is gonna send kamyru back to his nightmare
Everytime I hear that line  "I am the best" from rose, I almost break , rose is the best
1:03   4:03
Chandler, sorry but J G is too good.
Crazy to think that Trevor Wittman will be corning Justin Gaethje, Rose Namajunas AND Kamaru Usman this weekend. What a legend.
Chandler’s chin ain’t holding up
Just one word: VIOLENCE
Greetings nerds and virgins
CANNNNNNOT WAIT!
Colby Champ💣
Colby so scared to fly to Newark he flew to Teterboro😂
Kinda wanna see chandler fight Islam
Trevor got a little too excited at 2:31
I'm going out on a limb and taking who are probably all the betting underdogs to win their fights. I'm predicting all Trevor Whittman's fighters lose even though I predicted Usman and Rose to win the first fights.   I've seen Usman get wobbled against Colby and Burns. His footwork and timing arent as good as people suggest. Colby has been working on getting off the center line. His timing and footwork is actually better than Usman's. Usman just punches harder and straighter. I've noticed Colby training to punch straighter. I predicted Rose to win in the 1st fight against Weili due to her movement. I highly doubt it'll catch Weili by surprise again. Weili was already a beast and she's training with Cejudo to fix holes in her game. And the Gaethje/Chandler fight, well that's basically a toss-up for me. I think Chandler is a bit more explosive and technical and Gaethje needs to work on his gas tank/energy management. If Trevor can keep Gaethje disciplined like he did against Tony then he should win. But I think Gaethje is gonna be the old Gaethje and swing for the fences.
This time Snoozeman won't have Goddard to save him.
You ain't getting a title shot after beating Gaethje bud
Colby i know u like to talk trash, but dawg u r delusional saying Usman is scared to fight U....
Colby didnt have a stoppage win since 2016- “ Im putting Marty to sleep”
The CEO of EPO, Marty Fakenewsman, Snoozeman, Juiceman, The Nebraskan Nightmare will take the biggest L courtesy of Donald Trumps Favorite fighter 🇺🇸. Guaranteed!
ridiculous that if chandler beats justin he gets the second title shot in 3 fights. he beat hooker who islam also has beaten with ease. islam is ducked by the top guys in the rankings while amassing 9 win streaks at the same time. chandler has that dana white privilege 100%.
First voice to be heard..... Michael chandler
Win lose or draw. Or tie or no contest.
Of course this card would drop during No Nut November :(
Putting Covington in the thumbnail to get more views
I still going thru emotions after 267 and they dropin embeded for 268....it's to much for my brain.
I don’t think the Chandler fight is gonna be that close. I think he gets Gaethje outta there pretty quick
I'm sorry but neither Gaethje nor Chandler deserve the title shot
Usman - Trump jokes aren't funny when you are paying 5.00 a gallon for gasoline.  Trump jokes aren't funny when Biden is working on giving half a million dollars to ILLEGALS who were separated from their children. Trump jokes aren't funny when Biden can't function.  The U.S.A is going down and you got Trump jokes. Stop being so foolish.
What did they blur on colbys shirt?
Love Justin toooo 😍
I’ll be there on Saturday, can’t wait nothing like ufc at the garden
No more title fights Chandler, you argument is shit
Pat “the predator” Barry
I think Chadler wins.
Let's go Colby 💯🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. Screw Izzy and Marty snoozemen from Texas Nigeria.
Outstanding. A coach with 3 of his top 3 fighters at the gym in the last 3 fights. He’s gonna have a crazy coaching night!
Here we go
Colby trying to hard to be cool and Marty has about 7 different personalities. I don't like either one of them so I don't know who to pull for.  I'm definitely rooting for Justin and Rose though.
Never clicked on a video so fast in my life
Lets go KAMARU USMAN Smesh him 🤍🔥👊👊☝️
I hope Usman loses but he probably won't, as cringy as he is dude is an absolute savage. Goat potential.
RIP Colby
chandler's deluding himself. he didn't win that round 10-8
Michael Chandler really won the fans over. Nice to see.
Even tho I'm rooting for Colby ..  knowing Wittman is the coach..makes it a little harder to visualize a win😂 Wittman might very well be the best coach out there
I bet 3 of my internal organs to the Albanian Mafia in favor of colby winning, please colby merk the ceo of epo
I would like to see Colby Bring that Belt back to US!  An American deserves that belt.  Not some sellout, who grew up on the US tit, but fought for another country like Snoozeman
Im sorry but this ridiculous...Kamaru finishes Covington and after that has 3 title defenses. Covington being the one chasing the belt has one fight with Woodley but believes he deserves to fight for the title again as soon as possible. It was a exciting fight and i do want to see the second bout, but he is being given way to much credit.
any time they show chandler or colby: 😴😴😴
Lmao is Colby going for a rapper persona now that the Trumper thing is played out!?
Colby really the corniest dude in the UFC
Cejudo has embraced the 🥶 🍦 BING CHILLING, Rose better watch out her social credit score is getting low.
I actually want Colby to win lol 😭😂
What a card..edgar vs vera..and billy q vs burgos are some great fights too..what a night this will be!!!
That tailor on his A game. He knows this is a customer you keep. America the home of the great
So nice to get a bit of content every day
Colby is such a good guy! Very likeable!
Really appreciate that they put a random fan on the embedded.
Colby is so cringe, idgaf if it's an act, it's so unnatural, just reeks of fakery, you can tell none of these chicks even want to look at him lmao
Hopefully Usman/Covington will have Someone like Dan Miragliotta as a ref.  He won't buy into the fake nutshots and fake eyepokes.  Usman is going to lose.
Gimme that chaos...plus money 💰 gonna be a banger
the last sentence of colby killed it
How was the first round a 10/8
colby bring me back his head
Usman is juiced
Chandler 2 fight win for title
I hope usman doesn't retire if he beat Colby, I really want to see khamzat vs usman🔥
Not even capping but I forgot about beneil. he should fight the winner of these 2 then the winner of Dustin vs Charles fights Islam next year
Usman is so soft spoken it's endearing. lol
Pat Barry is mad as a box of spiders.
wen does Brandon fight?
Let’s go Brandon!!🇺🇸🇺🇸
Just imagine all of Trevor Whittman's proteges getting the win.
hilarious cause theres no way in Hell Colby didnt break his jaw, and theres no way in Hell usman would be stripped....Ever
Justin looked like Forest Gump running up the road.  LOL! Mad respect tho.
The only person in the 155 pound division who can beat Islam isn’t in the division anymore 🦅
Does Colby hear himself? I genuinely wonder what he thinks he sounds like
Crazy shit for Trevor Whitman to have his fighters as the top 3 fights on the card!
Colby would be a entertaining champion lol
🥊🥊🥊🥊
Usman should have won an oscar for his performance in the first fight
I really admire Colby. Dope fighter. Pro-Trump. Patriotic. Shit talker. But I’m a Nigerian Nightmare fangirl. Really looking forward to this rematch. I got chills thinking about it.
*Jorge Masvidal:* Oh, so you're from the 305 now?
I think Usman vs Covington will yet again be competetive. Just not as competetive as the first one. I think if Colby has any chance of winning, he must clinch Usman, try to grapple even if he is not succesful, make Usman work, use lateral movement,  avoid the jab and the big right hand. I think Usman wins by tko RND 4 or 5.
maru isn't on roids,  he's just nigerian..  -from a nigerian.
2:31 paulo costa to adesanya
If Colby wins this one the trilogy will be one of the greatest
Trevor Whitman getting ready to bring back more belts to Colorado.
chandler nobody thinks your the real main event over colby you clown
Dana, 50Gs for the Embedded Crew they out here working overtime.
Usman vs Covington, MMA get can’t better
Coby is so corny
It be crazy if Trevor Wittman went 3-0 that night!
I think in the wrestling exchanges, Kamaru edges only if he utilises his power wisely
Colby by UD. Covington v Usman 3 in May 2022
You will see both of team.huwww!!!!!🐺
268 could be fight card of the year!
Is Usman on juice or not? His back his huge and traps inflated. Makes me truly wonder
Kamaru gonna whoop that ass
We love Usman and Justin
Chandler, I like you man but everybody knows the peoples main event for this card is the actual main event. With peace and love.
Michael Chandler is delusional if he thinks with a win he’s getting another title shot.
Jesus, Chandler loves to talk about that one round lol
“Trumps everything he does” 😂 good one champ
Rocking with all 3 of Trevor's squad! 3-0 Team Elevation!
Lets gooooo
I hope that if Dustin wins in December they give him an action fight against Chandler or Gaethje and not just throw Islam at him to get another Dagistani champ. Dustin with either Chandler or Gaethje again is a guaranteed action fight.
Gaethje vs Chandler, Rose vs Zhang and lastly Usman vs Colby 2... *MMA Gods have truly blessed us this year* 🙌
Usman got that champion mentality his calmness is terrifying.
Let's Go Peoples Champ.
tbh if chandler wins he has to go for 2 more wins[ that also top 5 imo] to get back to the title ..then its fair !!!
Was just looking for this a little bit ago. Needed this in my life.
Trevor Wittman is about to become a very rich man after this card
i son't believe kamaru and colby have balls to fight khamzat
I like u Chandler but I don't think u should get another shot at the title even if u beat Gaijhgie there are more deserving fighters it's not fair to get another shot so soon when u already had one recently.
It's Chandler's last chance. If he looses he'll be turned into a gatekeeper just like Dan hooker
LETS GO BABY!!!!
about time
Let’s go so excited for this
If the fans actually want to see the Colby-Usman trilogy, they should all cheer for Colby & boo Usman, and maybe it'll throw off Usman (like what happened to Zhang Weili)
Nigerian latrine nightwear💩💩💩
Man i love this stacked card!!!!
Ha ha ha.
This is the Kamaru that people will like, the humble and honest guy that can fight
Early let’s gooooooo
Colby be looking like a roadman in the thumbnail 😂😂😂
Siiiiiiiick card!!
It's so hard to have positive vibes when you have someone like Chandler that loves stroking his own ego. I really hope Gaethje leaves him laying unconscious
Colby Chaos Covington by 1st round decapitation
Finally been waiting for this
3:43 damn Gaethje really did absorb Fergusons soul.
Ah yes, embedded week 🥵
Yo UFC, show some more of the under card fighters on these embeddeds they deserve a little love too
canit wait to see khamzzat fighting those guyuys
I love that Iron Mike knows exactly why this fight is happening
No way Chandler deserves another shot this soon. His first title shot hardly even earned. The guy can't just keep having a single fight then a shot at champion.
Lol I got caught
BACK TO BACK WEEKS OF EMBEDDED
“Greetings nerds and virgins America’s champ is back with the pick of week”-I honestly can’t wait too much fire we will kill it in MSG and all fight are great to be main events so it will be great to come together with everyone and watch
Kamaru with the Trump pun. That was Cleverly hills 90210
Guys all this is fine but....where does Kevin lee fit into all this?
If anyone has Too pull out we need khamzat as the back up🏆🏆
Kamaru’s evolution is insane!! It’s gonna be a repeat but he’s putting Colby out earlier
It's official Wittman vs ufc rosters😂😂
Michael chandler is crazy if he's thinks he gets a title shot again anytime soon
A definite fight of the year on this card
No matter who wins, we gonna see a backflip for sure!
This tryna find out if Gaethje and Kamaru was Actually Abt to Square up
Chandler is a great guy honestly I hope he will achieve his goals. Either way he can have a great future as a commentator / analyst even if he never becomes champ
If Usman pulls it off he is the fighter of the year no doubt.
Usman is so full of EPO! Uncle Dana pays off USADA to make sure his money makers never piss hot!
I can’t wait the press conference,I already know it’s gonna be 🔥🔥
Justin breaks Chandler in 2
Colby will rip Marty fake news man ceo of epo off
Chandler's coach has the Skyrim hair nobody ever chose.
Lets go Colby!!
Someone said, “chandler’s the type of guy to give a motivational speech at a funeral”
I rewatched Usman vs Covington fight again just now. It's nowhere near as close as it was made out to be when watching it 1st time around. Rogan was hella biased and clearly wanted Colby to win. Watch it again with that in mind.
The last embedded Seemed Like just 2 days ago🤣🤣
And still 🇳🇬
Question: how does 5mg THC compare to 5mg CBD ? I usually take 5mg THC to feel relaxed, how much CBD should i take to get the same feel?
SLEEP HIM COLBY
Obviously start off w/ Chandler
Could be some Fight of the Year contenders on this card
I actually don't believe this is happening, i haven't gotten completely over the showcase that was 267 and now there's already embedded no.1 out for 268, wtf Thanks UFC
Come on Usman let's do this
Chandler's argument for the title contendership is so weak lol. "I'm the only guy who beat Charles 1 round before I got knocked out" cmon man you ain't conor
Why UFC putting Colby's face up like he's some draw? Justin, Chandler and Usman are way bigger than he is.
Usman 👽🌍
Gaethje is Dead Anymore.
I was waiting for colby to hit us with that "Greetings nerds and virgins"
Kamaru's gonna destroy Colby.
Colby really sold his soul, teammates and family for nothing. He’s not even a draw 😭
Michael Chandler is the type of guy to promote a little league baseball game and make everyone hype.
Colby will walk out with Kurt Angle entrance music and whole arena will chant "You Suck, You Suck', can't wait 🔥
Love Chandler, but he needs 2 wins at least before getting a title fight
So crazy that we're having two numbered events back to back......the last one really delivered and I'm sure this card will definitely be lit
Loser of Usman vs Covington fights Khamzat RUN IT UNCLE DANA
Here we go people!🔥
Colby been preety quite in this lead up.
This usman vs colby 2 is gonna be so interesting
🇮🇳 🙏 Namste . Let's go colby Covington.
Welcome back Colby!!!
Covington, chandler, and rose!🌹Let's Go!
Usman EPO cheat
I clicked on this with utmost speed.
I think with Colby as champ the division will be much more entertaining, imagine the build up to a fight if it’s him vs Khamzat or Masvidal. Way better than Usman tbh
3.55
I can't wait, I can't f-ng wait.
Dana White for president! Why not ? He's a real deal leader
