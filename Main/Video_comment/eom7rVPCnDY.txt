Oh he’s gone….
DID HE DROP THIS SONG !!!! 9:30
Song?
I love how he so close to Jason that mf the truth !!! GOAT
doodle bob type beat
0:55 How does he not remember that?
He kind of reminds me of Lil Wayne…. In a way. Not just being from Louisiana.
Dead wrong for interviewing him off them drugs glad he’s better now😂😂😂
He wanted him to stop and at least think about what he said instead of trying to hurry and run the next question.
Nah to see young boy in  person making a song in the studio is legendary he ain’t even want to talk to the guy no More but the guy still got a one time legendary moment .
7:37 what’s tune ? - Sâ©️
That’s how you know he’s cloned he didn’t remember that guy he was in an interview with lol I already knew he was replaced
Aboriginal Native American, Louisiana black/copper brother in Utah like a king lol
Anybody know what kind of pop filter he’s using??
…did he mean, Your talking too much for MY interview?? Like he wanted to talk more?
That MF beat hard ASF🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 what's the name of song?
Wow this interview was powerful, iykyk whats going on here and with YB! 💚🙏🏾

He reminds me so much of lil Wayne back in his prime ngl
Garbage music hahahaha
Always amazing to watch how people live their lives
This is why you don't do drugs kids.

editors tried everything at their disposal to hide the interviewer fear
When did noise & chaos become music.. surely its demonic. May the young and old listen to Christ calling
Nah I could see why Top love Jason
Jason ready for the turn up he ready to make top go wild,btw it's 2025 and I'm watching this video more 4 times
I love Youngboy but it's giving demon 🥴 I need a pray after this and I don't even do that 🤦🏽‍♀️
3:59 epic 😂😂😂

Nxkka said get ur nails done , then proceeded to act zesty af during the interview , like ,
it’s sad to see how he mentioned the sneaker shopping he was so young and energetic back then now he just buries him self home with that k2
to me something seems wrong with him and his music. the music is not popping like before, the spark in his face is gone.
im tryna be like yb
What’s the name of the song
GOD YOUR WILL BE DONE IN HIS LIFE. DELIVER NOW IN YOUR NAME AMEN!
4:52 his voice is so angelic  Ts touched my soul😇😇
Who still watching 2025😂😂😂😂❤
Biggest interview and the audio is the worst possible quality.
Notice the interviewer was “talking too much “ after YB was talking too much about the music industry 🤐
i wanna be at home with him 😂😢
He was about to reveal some real deep sh*t then go like "man you're talking to much" lol 😂
best video complex has ever done
💯
You know he may have surpassed Wayne finally in overall IDGaf fame
Jason started dancing i would to ngl the pay must be good 😂😂😂

the engineers are my favorite part other than him they really know how to go with the flow
He finally dropped the song… it’s called Out My Mind
Jason be turnt
YoungBoy looks and sounds like he has serious mental issues. Dude needs some therapy
The Gravedigger Mountain Era of YB was so 🗑️ but iconic…  he’s forcing it… but that’s how it be when the fans say he can do no wrong..  you tend to feel like everything you say is 🔥 and there’s no struggle to make quality because it’s so easy, all you have to do is rhyme
am i the only one that finds it crazy that he doesn’t remember Joe? i feel like that spoke volumes
Jason a real one
Song is out and so fire 😮‍💨

Free YB🔝
Pray for the souls of these men. YoungBoy and Cheese know what they are a part of yet they still do it. And it is the same people who absorb this kind of destructive music that applaud him for his genius way to perform and conduct himself. What if I told you that listening to his music can rearrange your reality? Because it does. What if I told you YoungBoy is no different than Diddy? Because he's not. So many lost souls. So many people on the wide path. It's heartbreaking. May God change their heart. May God saved them. God's will be done always. Amen.
Jason really get this dude hyped up
He voice sounds like the little boat things we used to have as a kid, I think they called a kazoo
He flashed 🤣
The important significance and talent that can be found in producers/sound engineers is insane from this recording session alone making it all sound cohesive 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Vlog here
Possessed
What song is that he rappin
Sounds demonic
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿😮‍💨
Lol I would never tolerate this much disrespect. Will I be given a billion dollars? Or am I getting emasculated on camera by someone who struggles to put a sentence together for nothing?
Props to the engineers making hits outta mumbled ad libs, inaudible slurs and everything in between. Technology is good but wit someone who has the ineptitude to utilize the potential of the equipment and the artist is overlooked and underpaid for real
Can't talk to much let da sh goo

Folks love Jason
YB either very bipolar and depressed or on some crazy drugs
I remember when he did the sneaker shopping and the fan at rhe door YB boight lil dude a pair

Yb got da best engineer in the industry Issac Garcia a W
You can literally tell he’s being consumed by demonic entities, he’s no longer himself, he’s being controlled physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. Only the Lord can set him free. May God encounter that young man before it’s too late. 🙏🏾
Man this mf high as a Goodyear blimp😂straight dope fiend 😅 smh way to influence the young ones.
No amount of money is worth your soul yb.... Smh  yall need to listen he said he not an entertainer and he also wears a inverted cross. smh. Jesus is king period.
YB the goat. Hope he put them drugs down
Why YB talking like Monique on “The Reading”
Gets creative at 3am the witching hour, said himself the industry is demonic looks, moves, and talks like hes being possessed  that "you talk too much" looked like the demon in him telling him to shut up. To me this looks like a confession as well as a cry for help but idk it could just be me
Bro it sad to see youngboy like this from the 38 baby album to now he changed alot
Middle of recording a new song “I’m resting right now” I love it bro is high as a kite 🪁
song?
There’s something so sad with this whole interview. I feel like youngboy is a good example of how humans can bury themselves. Man need all the help he can get
The way his Engineer vibes With him is how you create greatstudio energy and that’s how you create hits
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭
Very eerie
Need this song asap
That’s talking too much woulda got me too 💯
Interviewer was uncomfortable on the low. 😂
_Sound crazy without Auto Tune 😮_
That is how it done fam on spot lyrics 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He is off alprazolam
The fact that he can just raps off the dome and just hear a beat and know what to say really speaks on how good NBA YoungBoy is. He doesn’t right down any lyrics ever, he just knows what he wants to say and just make the song off that. It’s crazy how much this man has accomplished in just 8 years of making music
I’m praying for him look like he drugging hard again from when he was sober Ik wat it feel like trying to do wat u used to do but after two month of being sober coming back can be hard 🙏🙏🙏🙏
He aint want to get to deep on the illuminati using him as entertainment so he told dude he talking to much
" we gone have a lot of fun 🥶🥹
This dude is tweakin
sound enjineer so feel it fr
you can tell he been trying to change his mindset
He is really hurting lately… something has been off with him… it’s been really bugging me… idk if it’s from using or something else but it’s concerning and sad
“Your talking too much” wasn’t nba young boy to the interviewer that was satan to nba young boy
I'm actually worried about this dudes health house arrest doing something to him he dosent even feel like a real person
What im gettin is YB knows he gotta gift and he love det shi buh da industry has a entertainment part of the business they gotta uphold and dets not who he is.
Got that junk with the big E……
🐐
That’s exactly how I flow all I need is one line the rest from the soul💪🏾💯ima” Ayy run dat back from the top” til  dat bihh right
GDM🏔️
That song wack
At the end yb love everybody ❤
Lol man why it looked like some gta graphics in the beginning of the video or it just me 😂😂😂😂
This guy is definitely in the spectrum
Say what you want but top got a big heart bro been hurt so much but still tryna be right
When is he dropping the song
What song is this lol
This is what PTSD is like😂
Whats the name of this song or did it not drop?
Hey, he did that song. It was interesting to watch his process so thank you YB and Complex.
Damm that bipolar shii. I could not be around him more than a minute or two. Dude seem like he manic depressed. No thanks, just Too emotional for my liking!
Joe: “Thank you.” YB: “No, thank you.” Honestly, gave me chills. The raw energy from that, whew! 💚🔝 capturing the process of an artist’s artistry 🔥
4:51 the engineer doing wonders if he's sounding like that without any effects
What is the song called?
He sounds like unknown artist
Wow… great music…
He’s sounds lonely
How low can you be to be with a Little boy who is MARRIED with 2 Kids that live in the same house & you’re all proud sitting there acting like YOURE the girlfriend 🚮.
what song was he recording
Does he just constantly stay high?
Devil deep in his mind
He acts like a somali pirate bruh😊
His music is horrible sounding
“That k2 got him started “
The interviewer was asking to many questions not that he was talking to much just asking unnecessary questions that don’t need to be answered
What’s the song called
Buddy came out the gate wit some lame @ss questions
Bro this man just said….”industry”…….”demoni…..chose to “be apart of it” 😢…..& y’all saying y’all proud of him ……smh I can’t listen to em no more bro that’s sad fr
Does anybody know the song name he was recording ?
Bro extra faded off that lean
😂😂😂😂😂
Dude is truly a puppet
Energy of this whole video feel off.
Yb a cool guy
He said “we” talkin too much. And they clearly heard him say “we” and not “youre” but still put typed the wrong quote for what reason? i have no clue
Something about young boy tells me he ain’t happy
"no, thank you."
Telling young men to " keep their nails done " seems like someone wants to push the agenda of turning all men feminine
Did he call himself never broke again because he made a deal where hes gonna be rich for as long as he lives?
What's the name of the song which he was recording
🗑️ 🚮
That song was hot trash😫💀💀💀
I pray that young boy would turn to Christ the fact he said he’s part of demonic industry and nobody batted an eye shows how the enemy is leading people astray. God Bless y’all. ❤
Stay in school kids.
wht song he made in this video?
4kt
4kt
Live long youngboy
Why it had to be 3am when he gets creative? Asked the interviewer at 2:38
I got a bad memory but it's nice to meet you again respect no kap

Louisianimal 🐐🐐🐐
Brooo 🥊 in legendary 🎶🤣
I won’t hold you I thought that was my crib on GTA for a second 0:19
😂😂😂 IM CONVINCED THIS M/F is SLOW AND THE DRUGS DONT HELP
Nikey 💚💙❤️💯🔥🔥🔥🇹🇹
Young boy needs to leave house arrest
Wow, people actually listen to this unstable 🤡?
Sold his soul he look like hes in tourment but his songs are fire n its effortless the devil is in his head telling him what to say! Ill pray for you my boy 🤞
Dude literally says its a demonic industry and he chooses to be apart of but yet yall are feeling bad for him … yall so obsessed with celebrities and blind, doesn’t make sense. Find God🙏🏽 3:25
This is unofficial officially the video to this song
That mf high asf😂
I get saw vibes idky
i love that so talented its scary vibe they give with these interviews. same thing noisey did with lil durk !
Its always finna be at home with youngboy, then it'll be locked up with youngboy.
Fast food rap 😂
Smh I thought this boy was popping. He's absolute trash juice.
My last 2 brain cells: 8:50
God bless that producer! He just LITERALLY tuned 💩 into a 💎 fr!
He looks and sounds like an African witch doctor. How do yall not see that this man is trapped by the cursed gods of the canaanites. Cursed by the gods of Canaan. They lost bro, why serve them. Jesus Christ offers freedom in the Holy Ghost. Stop sinning. Repent before it’s too late and they take you.
When y’all realize the true things that are going on in the industry you look at these things differently. He just openly said he joined a demonic industry **illuminati** they’re not even hiding it anymore. When the men kept asking questions about it. He said you talking to much. Meaning he can’t say too much he already said enough. Wake up people, open your eyes.!
Did anyone peep Cosmo and Wanda in the beginning? ⚡️
there ain’t yb
Pure talent legend.
This guy is sick , his mind is messed up fully controled by demon spirits 😢
Welcome To Grave Digger Mountain.
He was so high he didnt mean to be hostile, or show "growth" he was just FADED the whole interview
Love to see tha RAW TALENT AT ITS BEST YB🅿️5💯
5:27 Punching us in then we hear ourself and get to add more is too cool.
how supreme not send him a stack of them tees???
People fail to realize is that his addiction is what gives him his passion
Thats a bad caption job. He didnt say You talking to much, he said we talking to much.
T.R.A.S.H. Period.
Let’s stop upping ppl who talk about murdering their own people and poisoning the youth well just a thought carry on
I like how his manager support his music thats true love
te camera recording makes me feel lie hes bout to pul a syrnge out
4:40 ts killed me 😭😭😭
Revelation 13 It’s all coming to the light 🤍 Yes they made their choice but we need to pray for their redemption even when it feels hopeless
These dudes be way too high
Y’all keep saying made a hit 😂😂😂😂😂 love the person hope him well that shyt was trash my opinion tho
When you're meant to be at the top.....THE WORLD CAN'T CANCEL YOU NOR BRING YOU DOWN!!
Interview was over once the beat started my guy!
This interview is straight comedy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He sounds like Wayne but more out of it and younger too
Drug induced boy. We all have our demons but choose how you combat them.
Demon time 3:00am
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Talentless period
He said it clearly “ Demonic Industry” and he chose to be part of it meaning ain’t no going back!!
This young genius need to stop doing drugs
ain’t nothing legendary about this dude 😂😂
4:52
Listening to young boy rap has to be hard lol. Sounds like an old man who has been smoking for 40 years.
Jesus is the WAY, the TRUTH, and the LIFE. No one comes to the Father but by Him. Repent and trust in Christ.
when he said i aint got no money to give i felt dat 💯💯💯💯
If this man have a OG keeping him right he will be the biggest thing out . He s not about talking .
young boy music sould like he regurgitated it....
Being rich doesn't make you happy ladies and gentlemen. it comes with a lot of stress. Rich on the outside but your soul is broken down
I wish the audio could be a little bit better
Them playoff 8’s my fav ❤
Yo sit up straight😅 I can’t respect a grown man acting like he just took the needle out he’s arm!
Psalms 96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
0:27 YB aight n•••a let’s do it bih his first words of advice 😂🔥💯 1:22 the way he looks it’s like he regrets it already 😂
"I GOT MY GREEN MASK ON, IM TRYINA GET ACTIVE WASS HAPPENIN"

You can FEEL his energy when he hop on the mic. YB a legend
How he control his vocals is low key crazy I don’t even like this man music either 😂
This dude needs help . It’s clear he got mental problems
joe was shitttn bricks :/
Jelly Roll x YB
There’s drake and 40 but now it’s YB and Jason.
If you ignore the captions and listen close you can hear that he says “we” talking too much, not “you’re”.
U talking too much 😂💔
Release that song now! I'm replaying it over and over.
Was Joe Budden right????
Deeper meaning in the interview Fr most of y’all won’t see it
😂YB funny asf
Why is this stuff even on internet, is this who we respecting and following now? Geeked off his mind smfh
He look bad what he on? Him and Kodak on drugs frfr and somebody need to help them
“This a demonic industry”
Sickest interview of all time
This is Sad bruh!
this ain't the real nba youngboy this def a clone
Yall be tripping that boy kentell he ah special one man.....he's more than jus talent🔥🔥🔥
Nba young boy acting like a female. Str8 bit tbh.
Did anyone understand a word he said without the subtitles
Bro need to drop the song
Who comes back here just to listen to the song until it’s released lol
Greatest of all time 🐐
No wonder his music so trash
Apart from Curry and Peso, no other artist has over a million views on Complex YT channel 🤣🤣🤣🤣 YB 🤞🏽
He needs delivering and Jezus will save him
Interview turnt into a Stu session legendary!
HIS ENGINEER DANCING ITS F***G HILARIOUSSS TF!!!
It’s crazy how much money 💰 and and fame rappers get. Just for sittin in front a Microphone and doin that
I’m pretty sure he is the demon. And now a Mormon one on Lean🙄
Grave diggin MTN 🤞🏾🙌
His music been so 🤮 lately I can’t wait until he can leave Utah and work with other producers too
8:53
I fw Yb, but why people av ta be so wasted wen they agree fa interview. Av sum respect an conduct yaself better. Surely not too much ta ask.
Trash
Drop this song Top
Can someone please tell me the name of the mic he is using, I’ve been looking for it
This is what it looks like when you sell your soul and all you want is money to get paid but on the inside you empty smh
The sinister  music in thr background makes this interview  creepy
RIDING ROUND IN A DROP TOP W A STOLEN GLOCK
That’s syrup music
COMPLEX, YALL KNOW YALL SHOULD OF SENT TRINADAD JAMES TO INTERVIEW TOP
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Young Boi Look Like Slo B
It was nice to see the producer get up and vibe with YoungBoy NBA
And it slap! Sheesh!
Listen! He told y’all a lot! Praise 🤴🏾
Felt like we was there with you Top
7:40 for the song😂 dude so fuccin hard💯
YB has a broken soul. He needs ALOT of genuine love. He’s damaged. 💔
My boys needs love and genuine ppl around em. He’s beyond damaged and has been through a lot! (You can truly see it)
From his own admission, the music industry is demonic. This is why I left the music industry years ago to follow Jesus Christ. Jesus is alive!
4:50 Hahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahah
The beginning look like he just turned on GTA 5 😂
Bro stay in the middle of nowhere 🙁
This man came from nothing, his own mother wasn't even there for him when he was little but he still made it.   NBA🏆
Dis interview is amazing great job 👏🏿
“I don’t know nothing about no fashion.. check out my nails “
Jason i see you b**** wat it is niwkaaaa 😭😭
Free meechie baby
I’ve watched this over 100 times 🔥🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
next time somebody goin get whacked cause of talking too much😭
"gravedigger mountain" lol GET OUTTTT😂😂
Dayum his place is absolutely gorgeous. My man has immaculate taste.
YB and Jason a vibe fr they started turning up in that bih 🔥
He needs Jesus  Christ 😢
Cringe this is weird!
Idk what is more depressing. Watching this man with so much material possession, depression, drug addiction, and demons go through a rollercoaster of emotions in 10 minutes, or the people in this comment section praising him. This dude is one bad day away from throwing all away. I’ve seen dudes in trap houses or on corners with the same characteristics and the only difference is they aren’t millionaires like YB. Watching this interview made me feel super uncomfortable with the state of young people in America and their false profits.
i hope he drop this on his next project!
Keep your 💅🏾  done 😂 That's ya mans.
His pants have their own seat
Dude is so drugged up he can barely speak he will clean up or die young
Sit down
Standing all up on me look like I’m being interrupted all at the wrong time
Som Nawh a lot of times  folks just need to sit chill observe
Man this is trash
Young boy really just sit in his house and record
Yo sip lean out the triple cup that wild man😂
I wanted to see the dude reaction when young boy said “Aye u talkin to much”
I love how it starts. He done grown so much ❤❤❤
Goat
house arrest got my boi chillin dont care bout nun😂
Ummm ...That music recording was pure confusion.   Sorry but he is CLEARLY drowning in Drugs, Demons, Depression & Dissolusionment.   It's Like watching a semi-living Zombie 🧟‍♂️   And no one is saying anything to help him.  Pay attention to what he says about the industry....   WORD TO THE WISE  👹Never Sell Your Soul for Money 💰   If he could talk and reverse the curse - he would. Unfortunately, he feels like he already took the oath so he's in too deep now.  But there is hope for him....
he’s high outta his mind lol
Nahh this man is the goat fr 😭😭🐐🐐
Sad this young man creative his music is so good he needs a good monitor he can dominate the charts and reach a billion $ but if he stay with this mindset and addiction unfortunately we will lose another great artist he reminds me of juice wrld he can do it all I would only say juice is better than him in freestyle anyway yb need to clean himself man just make music make millions and have fun stay away from all bs enjoy your life don’t leave this planet too early
I just feel like nba to rich to have that Squeaky of a chair recording 😂
He's annoying. Always trying to be dark and mean, it gets old
i love that the engineer matched energy with the music... thats love frfr  energy to surround yourself with
He starts making music at 3AM 😂 demon hours
That cheeseburger cold
He was talking too much not the interviewer
grave digger Mountain!!!!!1000
Need to drop that song 🔥
That boy sitten side wayzzzzzz after 3 minutes into the video
Grimboy413 ready to come through for ft. Boy 💯
he needs to stop drugs
No way anyone enjoys this type of music.
I want YB to continue to heal and completely separate his self from everything, so he can go on a healing journey. Like Left Eye had to. 💙💚
This whole dark persona he switch was corny at first but I dig it now 😅
All these nice camera and no mics 😂 sounds bad
What’s the song tho ?
I need a interview next 🤘
His producer Cheese makes him the superstar he is. Insane.
This what u call retired young!!!!❤❤❤
Was he sleepy?
Dude looks miserable fr
Stop making junkys to rapstars
REAL & RAW ASF !!!!! He will be remembered as a legend
Bro❤
If youngboy  can sing  like this crazy  I can do too I am ready for action been crazy of of my mind hahaha 😂😂😂😂
You know he started blushin and he got butterflies when yb hit em wit that u talk too much 😂😂
man just straight up told us the music industry is demonic, as if we didn’t know before, its just crazy how we aren’t waking up. God bless america and God bless youngboy
No thank you
What a true gentleman. 🔥

I love it
Y b been through somethings 90percnt of y'all ppl will never...

Usually when someone says they have a bad memory then that means they do to much drugs 😂 but in all seriousness I like how he keep everything 💯
You can tell he enjoys recording more than anything, that’s the only time he can let loose a little
This lowkey depressing
Y’all can’t afford microphones? Why tf I’m hearing echoed audio?
Nice podcast
Dude is low key starting to sound like Wayne 🐐💯
Besides his music 🗑️ he kept real on the interview he definitely in a demonic path for the fame
This man needs medication
What is that he has around the mic? 🎤
U fighting a real demon
Man u talking too much 😂😂
Walking around on egg shells who needs that?
.Straight up, how we know he's really creative?Maybe because the voice is sad why the music hits you?
Them drugs again
Couple things yb needs good people Jason is a legend for what he does 2 can’t ask yb to much anyone with a lifetime worth of pain you gonna bring something out that ain’t good
Goat

This guy is as high as mount everest.
Only if y’all knew the reason he said “you talking to much “
"Oh yeehhh"
4:54   🗑️🗑️🗑️🚮🚮🚮😂😂😂😂
Wears an upside down cross for a sponsor just for money, always feeling depressed, because Jesus Christ is longing for him to turn to him because his love is the only way to heal his feelings of loneliness caused by the devil, literally says it’s a demonic industry, yet yous cheer him on to keep going I use to be his fan until I realized these are just false idols being used as a weapon by the devil. CHRIST IS KING
The whole comment section is brain died. yb look soulless
🔥🔥
Bro chose the most secluded spot for his house arrest. Not a single opp will be able to slide on YB.
He’s miserable you all can see it and still ignore it. He’s warning y’all. The music industry is demonic. Take good look at him he’s tired and on drugs and alcohol this Jason dude is making him worse. He needs to grab what ever money he has and just start a genuine business, and move on from this it’s ruined his life and he’s very lonely big house and no body there it’s empty
Dude gotta get off the lean, he looks depressed af
The song he made during was fye asl
Thought Jason was Negan
We talking too much
i was shocked when
😂😂😂Lol it’s like this expected a whole other person
This man talk like lil phat when he high asl 😂rip lil phat

N.W.A  What does that stand for?  It’s still going in 2023.. Nothing has change .. Pad yourself on the back..
YoungBoy has honestly improved his music 2023, hes redeeming it
Who really understands what NBA is say tho ?
😂😂😂
Wat song is this
Man when the white guy started dancing that put a real smile on my face 😂😂 u call tell he got good ppl around him fr
Demons and Drugs
Black kids are done for right before our eyes and most ppl see but don't care cause it's entertaining
This comedy I swear
That Wasn’t Yb Talking To The Interviewer!!!! That Was Satan Talking To Yb!!!
you guys know young boy is not going to read any of your positive comments right? most celebrities only respond to the negative ones. you guys really writing letters to a mf who would probably spit on you
🔥
That man youngboy started charging up when he put them headphones on.
The most misunderstood person
He sound the same in person as he do on the song...and we still cannot understand what he saying😂
What is he on.. literally
He use jason so much cause he comfortable wit him
YB in this video reminded me of JuiceWrld
Wow, I have a brother who acts like that when he gets so much intoxicated, soo he's for sure, under influence of some stuff, just look at him 😅😅😅
He got a few demons in him that need to be exorcised 3am is  the time they help him write them lyrics ☠️☠️☠️☠️ these artist be knowing what they dealing with trying to act like their soul wasn’t sold for riches and he from Louisiana their energy different there.he like Mary magdelin with them 7 demons in her he gotta about a legion in him
Pay to have comments. Pay to have views . Crazy
this was cool af
We just witnessed history
It’s crazy how he don’t remember I remember
It was the hug for me...
Yall aint hear what he said👀 pray for that man
I like the shirt for some reason
🗣️🗣️ that’s not yb 🚨
If you want a engineer and a producer like what you saw inbox me
I hope Jesus Christ gives you a pass my brother, I really love you❤
That’s crazy cause he really is trash but I guess that’s the new norm🤦🏻‍♂️
WAKE UP YOU SLEEPER THE TIME IS LATE THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND.
JESUS IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE  LIFE NO ONE GETS TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH HIM…
He really just said he is a puppet in a demonic industry and it’s to bring destruction….. To who? Who listen to his music? Just like new other artists with upside down crosses saying let’s worship satan then say he is not real or they just playing WAKE UP YOU ARE IN DECEPTION IF BELIEVE JESUS IS NOT THE WAY THE TRUTH AND LIFE
Respect 😂😂😂❤💯😎
If this is what kids call hip hop then I'm right still stuck in the 80s to 90s and early 2000s
He need to drop that song !
Misunderstood 🎭🔥🔥🔥
Something is really wrong with him
I dont wanna do too much talking., dont rub me the wrong way 🤣🤣🤣   just said he didnt wanna do too much taking soon as it start .. later in the interview " man we talking too much "
Demonic industry ?
No way this how Yb is. This can’t be real.
Thats a demon talking
This man chose this industry and he definitely got demons but he gone keep them all for the dollar......Dollars over souls is the business 💯
we not gone act like the song was goin off doe right in front of our eyes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Made a song in 30 seconds is krazy
Rap has fallen all the way off. His music is beyond trash
This dude is on drugs….BAD….and everybody around him gone let him self destruct cuz he a cash cow
The goat!!!!!!
Y’all not seeing his cry for help🙏🏽
He told that guy he was talking too much because he was so obviously trying to go down a line of questioning! He wasnt actually trying to listen or comprehend what nba was saying.
if it was not for Jason that ankle monitor would have been gone Jason been keeping him mad chill
Yea that’s a clone
Bro off the percs heavy
What song is this he making
Once the producers dancin like that he’s extra paid😂😂😂😂😂😂 8:41
Bru I need tht song he was recording asap
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Raw talent...unedited
Jason really bro dad lbs 😂💯
He on that dogfood
You are CRAZY if you ain't just see what this man did... literally showed us the process. Between him & 0:18
that song was trash AF
Bro literally said he’s in a demonic industry then right after told the interviewer he’s talking too much. Y’all more focused on how it was “rude or funny” but not listening to what he just said and why he’s trying to silence the interviewer. Y’all need to wake up Fr.
It's a Shame to Be Rich and Can't be a Normal Person in Reality it's no love living Shelter and so far to Go
Anybody notice how that tv was long asf and got short??😂😂😂😐
In them videos he so gangsta on this interview he sounds like a little scared boy
How can you respect a person who sold their soul 🤦🏻‍♂️ he literally said it and u guys gonna ignore it right..? 😏
This young man works with the devil u can see it in his eyes 👀 we living in the last days !!!!
Drugs
Song wack ASF 🤣🤣
Yb friends needa to stop him from taking whatever drugs he taking😢
Dude think he is the hardest lol
Bro 😂😂 hate talking too  much
Legendary
Never liked his music 😂
dude absolutely cooked!!!
🤍
Put that cup down write some yu missing out 🤟🏾😤
He said “I ain’t doing no talking” in the adlib cz this ain’t gone be no regular interview and we gone have fun
That’s exactly how juice made every song of his but better at putting the song together
So he owes Drake some money???
“Part of a demonic industry I chose to be a part of “ 😔   HOPE HE FINDS THE WAY OUT  THIS FOO DONT EVEN GOT A SOUL ..
Very very spuky place where they locaded.Them wood's up to no bueno 🙎🏿 Darck Place
Release the song asap pls
Leanin😅
Free Top💕-he don’t look ok🥹
Youngboy really wants to leave this demonic industry,but once you give yourself to it there is no going back son, word.I'll put my brother in prayers
Jason turnt 🤣🤣
Joe La Puma tryin' to get to CNN now....
I just wanna know how Jason processing all that headphone bleed and the mic stand keep getting knocked 😂😂😂 u ever recorded vocals with any of those “eyeball” type isolation shields, they whack and give a horrible boxy sound. Gimme that vocal chain homie !!!😂😂😂
He said hes talking too much because HE said too much and really ultimately brought everything into a nutshell. He pulled off a move to "scratch that" by saing "you takking too much" lol
I understand why he said “you’re talking to much” He was like right in the middle of his thought…building prob about to say more…and the interviewer ask a diff question …
the goat
Young 🥷🏽 really hard,, First time I ever just really listened to how he coming.. New respect for the youngin
Name of the first song? 😂😂
goat
Kentrell is a very colorful individual may he find peace and stay blessed and continue to be the talented person GOD made him to be 💯🔥
The idustry seems like a sad place to be. No matter how fkd up or sad you are the audience just keeps on cheering! Instead of house arrest he need some rehab facility. Juice wrld & Lil Peep should be an example that depression + drugs lead to death!   An episode of the Therapist would be good for him. Overworked & ALWAYS doing music being stuck in your head is not healthy!  They always look/act happier when they was trying to make it out the trenches. After a few years of the industry & getting arested over & over they end up doped out.
is this song out yet???
Song??
Top Jason real 1
90% of yall dont even get what youngboy said about the industry😢
His gremlin ahh voice when he raps 😂
4KT🐍
Evil resides in Utah
He is real ASF Slime
i wanna b as lit as he is 24/7!!! 💯💯💯💯
Weird af
Idgaf bruh but NBA keep it up man let my man's know he doing good I know it's a sad world but it's gonna be ok
Mane just made a song for a interview
Listening to him is destruction. He says it himself
Million dollar worth of game otw 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro he need to drop that song
That's why majority of his music sound loud asf with echos. He rap in a opend living room.
He's a tormented soul
This is far out nice nice camera work man
After seeing this I don’t want no parts of his music cuz it’s made with pour depression and with a dark soul poor baby
Yall better wake up and stop thinking that life style is only riches cuz it more darkness then anything else
Really look at how depressed he really is ppl just see materialistic things, but he says it with the industry and that money comes self-destruction. He’s telling you his story then he stops the man almost like that man has something over him that made him so comfortable to start talking. He said you talk too much and got up and walked out, but the baby started revealing how he really feels that little man right here is depressed and living in straight darkness
He said I’m really not no entertainer he said I can’t even talk too much about it. Everything is not to be spoken or spoken. That means that boy made a deal with the devil but his lifestyle and he said he just rolling with it because he pretty much made his bed.
He knows his music influences others... said he'd change... change ain't easy as we seeing💯
Who else thought them was gta cars😂😂😂
Wake up clowns wit all dat foolish congratulations & respect...ya'll should be more in tune dat the industry is demonic & he's being honest about pushing the demonic agenda 2 destroy the lives & souls of anyone who glorifies the industry 💯
This shi inspiring
He said he talking to much becuz Yb got comfortable n said what he just said it's da question he asked b4
everyone in the comments on his D so heavy
Shout-out to Jason
I can relate to yb lowkey 😮‍💨💯
NBA youngboy’s whole personality is rotten
People will know it's demonic and yet they'll call themselves fans; and wonder why they become violent.
The editing on this is on another level.
This new generation is weird
I like how he mead the interview different thin others that’s why he’s at the top to media or journalism, can twist your words and that’s why he cut the interview short and made it his own video
That song is fire asf he needs to drop that asap
Drugs are bad
The old him is LONG gone ✌🏽🙏🏽
👊🏾💫.RR!S$,
Bruh he said we talking to much not you ?? Y’all need to open your ears !
He raps like a soldier singing in the cadence while going to Battle
We need this song
Jason been around him so long he dancing like young boy and all 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:00 is legendary 💯. It’s true but look where he’s w 🔥🔥🔥
"Demonic industry that im part of"
4:00 The Moment Wen You 🖕🏽 Up  🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣 Dude Looking Like Huh Got That Look On His Face Like Don't Start No 💩
2:37 3am Hour The Devil Hour
Hot
0:18 I thought bro was playimg gta online
Yb is now full of dr*gs ?  Cabt understand the music or the lyrics unlike b4
Real icon
He don’t remember doing sneaker shopping with Joe?? Huuuuh.. at his age memory that bad?!?!
The 1st thing I realized is no matter the passive aggressive his intro, he showed his true heart and spirit in that wholesome embrace when manz said “I met you before”.  You gotta pay attention, a gangsta true heart will always show if they have one.  When you grow up like some of us grow up we have a shell of survival that has and still protects us, but we really loving and kind and sweet and helpful and cool af!   The only reason he said “you talking too much” is because the question that was asked made him speak on some deep shyt and he realized and wasn’t willing to go any further! He’s smart af! He’s a sweet young man a lot of ppl say that, but he has had to defend himself in the harshest way that has stained his spirit!  He was doing great when he stop doing drugs but tv demons came grabbing for him and he ain’t strong enough to break that hold just yet! He has time to grow more! A whole life to live!!  This young man is a legend already what until he fully evolves on some Kevin Gates shyt he’s gon be unfuckwithable!!! I only mention Kevin cause that man car from such darkness and to see him evolve into his spiritual has been beautiful! Growth and love is the cure!! …..THE TRUTH!!
The way he treat people that cater to his art is terrible.
Better drop that song
5:14 💀💀💀💯
He Diablo
This was dope
He needs to be on house arrest in Arkham asylum.
He was telling himself he's saying to much...did yall get the message😢 To have the world but loose ur soul😂😢 Demon don't need p3n😮
IS IT ME OR IS HIS SKIN SHINING AND CLEAR ASL.
this boy voice and the way he talk change along his fame😂
Nicca sound like a dirtbike
The energy of you is a gift of God. that  gift that most don't realize they have already. I like the fact  that he speak his mind always on guard but still manage to still try to love. It's a cold world outche and we all live in it. Salute to you youngun. Coming from A 49 yr old listener..outta Atlanta......king
That song was hard af
I don't think the interviewer understands how lucky he is😢
Yb said its demonic do yall still think its a game ?
People still drink lean? What a loser
03:59 best part

I believe NBA young boy was not talking about the interviewer talking to much he was talking to himself he was about to expose the industry n you know what happens next to people who try do that look what happened to Dave Chappelle
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐🤨😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐🤔😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😑
That song isn’t out yet?
Drop
This is raw talent 🔥 He just made a hit off a beat he neva heard all off the head & fast toooo🔥🔥🔥
Remember when Lucifer took Jesus Christ to the top of a mountain and showed him the kingdoms and all the things in the world could be his he only had to bow down and worship   hi … Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God. and him only shall you serve.
I need this song

The song he made on the undecided album?
I would’ve gotten up laughing and left if I was the interviewer 😂

A real good person 4 REAL just keep it real and respectful and he will show you the same RESPECT! LOVE YOU NBA youngboy!
Is that a black and mild in his sandwich ?
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Making the same song over an over is legendary 😂
That's crazy how good the song came out just like that 😂 mind blowing
💊
He said "aye we talking to much man". But they're gonna push a more fearful narrative and make it seem like a threat directed towards the interviewer.. listen and see how something like a caption mistake can shift one's whole energy
the process! gotta luv this guy
was that english
Anybody Believe In Clones 😅 ?
Youngboy did a song in 5 minutes, an it was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did he drop that song???
You are making nothing but noises
I be recordin just like him too and dont be havin no one in there straight off da top

Why they start it off like a crime/prison show😂😭 nun they others start like this
he drop this song?
He’s giving off juice wrld vibes.. hope he doing straight!
No personality or professionalism at all,  he's an angry miserable rich young black kid.   RIP G•Money
He's not an entertainer he a puppet to destroy the black community the same people who own the record company owns the jails
7:50 song?
Youngboy the realest 🐐🐐🐐
ending it with YB saying thank you is beautiful.
They wouldn’t try him like that  he’ll flame them next song

Dear person, I do pray you give your life to Jesus while you can ❤❤✝️
Bro the coldest on god look how fast bro did that song mane

This is like watching Tha Carter documentary from 2008. So many funny Youngboy moments in this
Cheese moving wild 😂
youngboy is truly a goat, and he has done alot of good things for this generation.
A whole hit on interview.
He's. Obviously back  on the drank 😂😂😂
He’s sold his soul and hates it
I got a bad memory it’s nice to meet u again 😂
🐐🐐🐐
Bro That House sounds so lonely man 🥲
Song name?
Bro is living life like a demonic oracle lol all secluded in the wilderness just pumping out evil influenced music.
Pray for him

👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾😤😤
Song name ??
The difference between this and his old ig lives is crazy. He is the goat but I hope he gets the help he needs
songs fire af
Top laid a song in a interview under 5 minutes with no writing and just hearing the beat for the first time. 😮😮😮Bruuh
Jason the best ⭐⭐⭐
Dat ninja jus made a hit right there and Complex was there to witness. If they wasnt right there, we would have another verse on that track 😏 jus saying. I kno he was feelin dat beat and had more to say 😈. Shout-out Top
This guy a demon
It’s so obvious he’s been replaced. It’s hilarious.
All that yelling u a whole clown
He a 🤡 clown
The goat fr. 🐐
Top
Wise words from TOP…   “It’s all in your heart, in my heart”
Its ironic how satans horseman "Goldie" choose that skinwalker Mormon state of evil to call home 🤦‍♂️
Everything he’s saying from 2:20 and on is subliminal to the Illuminati and satan worshipping
His whole "act" needs to go bro 😂 his biggest issue in life is being a brat, grow up "young" "boy" ... cuz a little "boy" is all u is, and somehow u rich, this world is wild 😅
🔥🔥🔥
Telling complex you got a bad memory as of remembering him is legendary
People that call him a genius because of the way he’s acting. The man is a mix of social retardation, life trauma AND A HEAVY AMOUNT OF DRUGS.
Me personally I wouldn’t take that type of disrespect from yb 😂😂😂if I was you I’ll do sum bout that😮😂😂
If the devil/the father of lies is real then God is real repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and turn to Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world🙏🙌🗣🕊🔥.
👀 This dude is wack AF 😂
i love yb
Nihha a clown that k2 got him like a crackhead
He sounds weird af when he talks 😂
So he tryna free styling songs he a goat🐐
7:40 what’s that song?
The beginning part felt like a walking dead intro
10 minutes of nothing
Young boy will never hit the same after watching him make that hit 😂😂😂
That intro like when the main character travels to an ancient temple to learn from a mystical shaman
From 3:20 to 4 y’all really need to tune in at what he saying…are you sure you want dat major record label deal ??? I just rethought about it myself
This dude can't handle fame. He probably jerks off to himself with how big his ego is.
2:00😂😂 nah fr😂🦾
I gotta be seeing things are tripping is that jay the youngin baby momma Jordan?somebody tell me I’m tripping
bro is tweaking heavy
He needs to drop that song tho
Lord, these kids need Jesus 😂🤣
Character 😂
Nobody can ever make me hate kentrell 💚 he so different
Who else rewind a few times to hear the song he made 😂
this is fanastic jornalism
Jason gotta he the coolest producer ever
so sad
idc YB goated for real
Hes possessed
We missed the messages hidden in plain sight huh
I love YB
Man yb on pills addiction, he even told his own therapist he feels more depression and Alone, i undertand but his lil addiction and lean is only dragging him down the wrong hole, I hope he gets the help he needs
🐐🐐🐐
He 2 different 😭😭😭
This guy got a drug problem he going to crash out
I'm soooo proud of him! He's being the most calm him!
That’s song was fkn fire
I miss the old yb they got him 💔
I hope he's okay
This mayne said this is a demonic industry that he chose to be apart of
They low-key giving away his location 😂
this was not it lol
When I saw the triple cup I knew this was finna definitely be like no other interview
Aye he need to drop that song 7:14
What song is this?
Lil Wayne made it seem harder being in the studio🤣💯🔥
i just wish this dude was sober
Y'all praising him for being autistic and overly emotional 😂😂
Was i the only one that saw the stain on yb jacket 😂
NBA the Goat
YoungBoy seems paranoid of what is he going to say in this state, while being fully aware that some of the reporters like to ask the set up questions. That could be the reason he's acting this way.
YB living off in the mountains
Hopefully when yb finally able to leave house he becomes more happy
Yb a comedian fr
Lean makes you an anry person; thus why he had that random mood swing an told dude he was talking too much lls
Boot up
First to do this. Turner interview to video shoot
Ok😂
I got a bad memory…cloned or mk ultra
Idk, the girl and guests felt unconfortable and its just because of his aura. Them drugs got him depressed.
I seen a druggy recording and an admission of guilt of a demonic industry
Said it himself the industry demonic
They using me as entertainment translation they us me to destroy the youth
Yb my favourite artist of all time but 1 thing is for sure that the mic is solid than a mf😂😂😂
All I see is souless person trynna find himself
Yb bout his business don’t let mfs play with it !! But always do the right thing or try at least!
Yb is definitely this era lil Wayne he has his own vibe and he just legendary
You can tell soon as he came out he wasn’t feeling it
Joe and Complex tried 😂
We want more 💔💔💔💔💔
The engineer and him dancing together 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro off the wock
🇧🇷
🔥 exclusive complex legendary
What good is there for a man to gain the whole world but to lose his soul.
This easy
Hé on point  Jason got caméra no talkin
U was the first to sit there. In his area.    Vibin  that’s cool.   He get it from his daddy.   He too emotional.    That lean.  Reality sinks in
Thank u
God bless you young boy dont let this industry get you. God bless you handsome young man. A young legend 💕
Why he make a banga that fast tho song hard asshit 😂😂
I see what they did there. But the sneaker guy threw me off
Lol thank u, no thank you... 😅
I’m irritated cuz now I want the whole song 🔥🔥🔥
Soon as young boy said that goofy ahh ish to me I would have leaned over and slap the taste out his mouth
🚮
You can tell bro still hurting in many types of ways, always been a yb fan, hope he gets what he deserves
breh yall got this negative narrative around YBs now that yall cant even see that he is ONE OF THE GREATEST to ever do it. hes mad talented and diverse…he even acknowledges that the industry is DEMONIC & Only Entertainment……he may have been “manipulated” but he is aware and is NOT conforming. Only playing his part in the decision and choices he made.
Lol they interview a session
Nah this ain’t it
I thought it was hard to understand him until he started recording
Engineer was going to crazy 😹
Its something about utah bekuz kanye ye went there when he had a break down & now nba yb. Must be a mk ultra base there 😢. Sad asf

Wonder how much you paid for just that 😂💀

He’s such a goat🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
I think he was talking to hisself when he said u doin too much talkin
Man that’s just goat Activity right there 💚🖤
I genuinely believe YB can make a country sound and it’ll be a hit
Yb too much he makes making music look easy but bro just made a godly song without trying

*This interview or lack there of was an amazing insight into where Kentrell is mentally. I'm praying for him man a lot was said here without him "talking too much" he is very wise.*
Lil wayne is the GOAT  if u tattoos on ya face u got it from Dewayne carter is the GOAT 🐐  to many rapper's  wanna be him so much he's a trend  setter ❤
He works everyday 😅
Thank u 4 not panting ya nails  nba 😂
All in his heart but points to his head
They gone let the truth of the situation go over their heads 😞
He so weird to me trying to be tuff all the time and y'all think its gangster smh!!
YoungBoy just confirmed that his not an entertainer,but he is being used as an entertainment..And he belongs to a demonic industry so..I would be careful about that message. Cause he means that his songs are demonic 😈👹👺
Love you NBA youngboy❤❤❤
Utah is beautiful
Cheese and yb like dre nd snoop 👀
Him saying it’s demonic is real & that’s how you know he anit cloned or replaced yet & that’s why they black ball & hate him but they can’t fr cuz the fans keep em alive
I be laughing so hard when YB be dancing!! He be hitting it doe.
Rhtym is trash...
YB better ❤
YB 🔥
Mannn, I love this mannn so much!!!❤
Ik it was so awkward and nerve racking for the interviewer or atleast I would be 😂
He drop this song yet ?
The interview asked the right questions, and that's why he said he was talking too much. If ykyk
For all those saying they tired of his sad music y’all need to know he been on house arrest for more than 1 year now that’s why it’s affecting his mental health his manager been saying he losing weight bcs of that
Lol telling an interviewer you talking too much is weird and disrespectful why agree to it if you going to act like a female
Why and how to this guy have fans? His whole vibe is corny. The dumbest ppl in this world gets lucky.
Closest thing to Pac. The boy is gifted ⚡️energy different and you almost want to hug him and tell him it’s ok we got you.
Give the engineer a raise because that room is not treated 😂
🔥🔥🔥
Wow❤
“I got a bad memory” haha wonder why

Bro people in the comments don't know what talent is, they say his talented just because he did that freestyle on a hard ahh beat, nah everybody can do that freestyle, he was just basically went aggressive and yelling about his experience car and how he  keeps he's gun, how he handles his opps and harmonizing on the beat that's it. This is not talent and the beat was just good.  And I don't hate youngboy.

He needs genuine people around him to help him get past his addiction. He is super creative all in all
Bro be on the drugs, yall see how his skin tone seem glossy
A real self centered person you can tell Top don’t like answering NO questions he vibe by himself
I wonder what Complex was trying to get out of this interview, because intent was not met.
He tried to hard for this video
😂😂goofy
Grave digger mountain 🤣🤣🤣 Stunna Island soon??👀
💚T🌏P wanna reach out to him 1day💡
You lying if you say this ain't the realest interview out right now💯
This man fried. Somebody who cares about him has to get through to him
Seee how the industry is using him for his energy
Jason real 5 dw up with yb
It takes nothing to impress this clown generation smh this dude a bipolar drug addict but because he rhymes some words together, people see this as special? Have mercy on our souls man
Im worse then him
This was all scripted right ? 😂
Ngl that bih was hard🔥
That lil dude is the closer thing to Michael Jackson
top making music is just how I pictured! he to real for this industry!
Top
When yb in the studio I can feel the energy through my phone 🔥🔥 he was born for this
💚
4 minutes in to the interview “man, you talking to much. man” 😂😂😂
He did say he gone die before Christmas we just don't know the year.
Y’all blind
I love the yb interviews man he’s a interesting person that we dont see a lot and tbh most rappers dont know this but the more we see them on the net the less we listen to they music so rarely seeing yb makes most ppl listen to his music to see what type person he is and finding out what he’s going through from songs this why I fw yb man been listening to bro before the fame 💯
My opinion is.....the message not positive deliver,the music is negative which the white supress loves,white supremecy loves,it's gonna effect allota ears,and the negative demeanor is going to continue in black community Kidd's,up coming Kidd's at dat and create young menace. Nothing positive my opinion...TO MANY GROWN MAN FOLLOWERS NOT LEADERS HES STILL YOUNG NOT ENOUGH HISTORY IN YOUNG BLOOD TO UNDERSTAND WAT HES CREATING, THE MUSIC DEMONIC LIKE RAP GAME NOTHING POSITIVE DATS WHY ANDRE 3000 QUIT IT WAS TEARING HIM APART HE NEEDS WISDOM AROUND HIM WERE U COME FROM DONT MATTER U CAN CHANGE NOT WISDOM AROUND HIM
hope YB finds peace you can tell he really going thru something with them demons out there
Jason I love you so much
4 minutes into the video and he rubbed him the wrong way 😂😂 I knew it was gonna happen I just didn’t think it be that quick
Y’all gotta listen to what he saying, THEY are controlling him. We all know that’s not yb
🖤🪖🍃🤌💯🤝
3:56  If someone said I’m talking too much I’d say the same thing back at em 😂
This the lil Wayne of our generation
Bruh do not like being on camera for too long 😂💯💯 felt.
Bro after he said gave his speech I would of said let’s rap this up🤣🤣🤣🤣 brah off the drugs ain’t no telling what he wanna do

They aint even eat that hamburger
“ yb we’d like to do a interview “ ask a question  “ mane you talking to much “  💀💀💀
At least bruh self aware of the music industry is demonic and he chose to be apart of it but refuse to self destruct by the the hands of them
🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾laadarka fanka😈🎤💯
What’s the name of this song!?
Youngboy been in the Industry too long he got weird
The 🐐 of his generation no if ands or buts 🔝 ❗️
When yb said “man you talking to much man.” And did that finger point. Fa me trying to interview him that he agreed to shoot. I woulda instantly   :DURK I HAVE HIS LOCATION 🤣🤣🤣
Dammm

4:43 🏍️💨
They thought they were going to talk about clothes and this ended up being a music video
Bro that dude is over. His soul gone. No more life in him when he speaking. I don’t think it’s only because of the codeine
🐐
Real rockstar
Funniest interview
Not feeling it at all.
Luke 11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
MY BOO DON'T LOOKING TO GOOD I WISH THERE SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR HIM 😂😂😂😂
Drop!
What y’all did to YB
ii love me some jason . ❤‍🔥
How often you get to record an artist while they recording in an interview lol…….YB BETTER💚
aye he showing his true self in this video but this video has so much potential (meme wise)😭
This song should be drop real soon. YB GOATED FR 🐐 ❤
Who else come back just to listen to the song ? 🔥😂
They should have sent someone who is more relatable to the artist.. 24hrs either the artist was an opportunity to create a dope documentary
I swear I thought the front of his house was a GTA mission
The GOAT
no way he gave these 🥷s a set of rules @ the door 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THANK YOU YOUNGBOY 💚
He doesn’t say “keep the camera rolling 24/7 my friend” he’s saying “keep the camera rolling 24/7 ON MY FRONT”
Car just like gta5😂
this motivated me to nvr go broke
interviewing this guy is not for the weak!
Soooo why did he do the interview 💁🏿‍♀️😂
UGHH I LOVE THIS MANNNN
Now if u don’t think Illuminati is real yb basically just told everyone without even getting to deep into detail about it , told the guy u talking too much pay attention 💯
After done watching I have go to the lab to if I lose any brain cells…
King youngboy❤
Hate from Earth
I keep coming back to listen to the song!  7:40 💚
Yes such talent but he's like he gone  so  fried so sad
Bro voice is fried 😭😭
Bro sounds like doodle-bob
He’s soulless
People hyping this behavior up are insane and enablers.  There’s no reason to accept an interview at your HOUSE if you’re gonna act like this
Young boy holding that cig like a old man lol
WTH happened to hip hop? 😢 this is sad
This man voice sounds exactly like the songs no autotune
He just dropped a master piece without trying just goat activity💚
“Man Your talking too Much” 😂😂😂😂😂
Did he just ask that man “wea the Herein?” 7:04
Man what song is that?? The one he started recording during this video
Y'all laugh but he serious
The relationship him and Jason have is dope you can tell that’s really his mans fr

He’s gone have to face reality when the drugs stop, it will change him forever or he will die.

I have a bad memory !! I felt that
Humans do not deserve to go through pain like this. Even if hes doing it for the money he deserves real love.
Jesus loves I hope his soul is saved soon
How he taking you wouldn't even feel at home man😂😂
GTA 6 GRAPHICS ARE CRAZY!!
complex is lame for misquoting YB.. He says “we’re talking too much”.. so lame and they making him look bad
Moral of the interview is don't talk about the industry
NBA
He is in a dark place sadly
💚
He said keep the cameras on 24/7 ya'll giving us 10 mins😢
Jason turning up boy 😂
He's drinking lean on pills high out of his mind he needs help he needs to get off the drink and the drugs he's so talented but just not in his right state of mind, he needs a true friend to help him when he can't help himself god bless everyone 🙏
They must don’t drug test him no more
Bro is pure entertainment 😭😭😂😂
Bru ahh tew different
Bro this interview was crazy YB instead of talking about what he does …He simply showed us the whole process. Less Yapa yapa more doing.
Dude made a hit in 60's sec shid crazy
His brain is fried to a crisp and people are calling him a genius.
😂 that's not NBA Youngboy where is he NBA youngboy don't sound like that
dude really dont wirte at all
Bruh really a loner if you peep his personality he don’t like the fame
It’s a demonic industry , that I chose to be apart of
These rappers really think they the real gangstas. Lol. How you gonna set up an interview, bring the people to your house, and then treat them like they some salesmen that showed up at your door?.  B**** you told them to come.
I dont know nothin bout fashion big dog...keep your nails done guys...trust me, this fool know more about fashion then most females. This fool extra zesty.
Exploiting at its best
NBA Young Boy never disappoints when coming to his music career, bro you are a fucken Super 🌟

Feeding him potion, letting him make music, and he out the way.
That house arrest is really worse then jail. I love me some yb but you can see he’s really hurting in this video. He cheers up a little around Jason.
F the world, feel the fury of a chosen man. Km chosen to NBA Young Boy. The world hates me too. Keep your head high bro.
Grave digga

Yb genuine as a mf tho

I LOVE YB TILL DEATH. PLEASE ALWAYS STAY SAFE TILL THE END. LOVE YOU YOUNGBOY. ❤

Yb music is for us Yb fans If you don’t like it move around 😂💯💯this song been stuck in my head an it not even out
The process raw asf
Even dude interview is a hit lol
Never Broke Again🔥
More like YoungGirl with his little attitude towards a dude there to interview him.  Lame dope fiend!
It's a shame he is always drugged out.  Dude needs real friends and family in his life.  No real friend lets their boy get this bad.
Thank you YB for letting us in for a few……
Bro don’t look healthy
Sounds like he said “WE talking to much” ion think he was tryna be rude or disrespectful maybe im tripping tho
Man them views different dawg 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Had that man scared to ask questions smh yb ain’t have to do all that!
The way Jason and Top match each other's fly is crazy 😂🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂studio seesions with NBA gotta be crazy
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nikka was talking too much. Looking off somewhere else while hesitating to get a question out. At that point, it's time to back off and get yourself together.
“ imma treat y’all with the most respect “ as he gives the rudest intro ever 😂😂
Their convo amazing
Brooooo young boy such a goooffyyyyy
Weird how YouTube won’t  Monetize this     But other videos with not no foul language.   YouTube has to monetize this if it does for other videos
🐐!!!
1:25 bro was done with the interview already.
Yb favorite alive go crazy nba youngboy .
Stay smooth YB were glad to have you here.
That song might be titled “Gravedigger mountain” with him in camo standing next to a goat as the cover. (His endorsement pic)
@5:05 “Pounch me innn”😂😂
Jason is a surgeon
to see his process is crazy and just like that another hit
It's really a trend to hate YB smh. This was a really good interview💯🔥Ya'll really need yall ears cleaned out btw. YB said WE'RE talking too much. He can't say too much about what the industry is doing to get at him. Ya'll hear what ya'll wanna hear, then call us YB fans d riders and glazing. If dxck that much on your mind, just come out already☠️☠️☠️
drop the song man it goes hard asf
Lost!
Youngboy seems like a shell, just empty. He made his choice yall...
What song that is
YB made me subscribed to complex… love u boy
Straight trash, too much electroshock treatment 😂
this is sad but i guess it is a never ending cycle of pain for these artists
Best vid this year💚
This man is possessed 😂 bro is a toy living in the middle of no where
That lean got him way to lit
He’s so serious 😂
he is obviously not mentally ok... get this man some help
💙🫂😪🙏
He is one of my favorite artists for years but he just seem like he be trying to be too hard 24/7. Like bruh relax sometimes.
Yb is different
For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have everlasting life
YB IS A Dope Fiends
New TV KNOWHOW
demonic industry
That song he recorded gone be a bangaa
One of the best ..he really stand on bizniss
This dudes a Fkn goofy 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
His gangster days are over he’s tucked in the mountains in Utah he’s done with society
He got syrup all on video yeah top be drugged out but it’s cool when he is not when yak is
bro laced
So no one sees the stutter(attempt to control what he says) 3:26 and his self projection at the interviewer after saying some heavy stuff, 4:00  he dropping hints👁️
That boy brain is deteriorating in those mountains..and if I’m not mistaking one of his conditions on house arrest was to not use drugs…he’s clearly drinking codeine syrup..
" is...a demonic industry that i chose to be part of"
Raw content fr, this was good
“I got a bad memory” 0:58 😂😂😂😂
He might as well name the song Gravedigga mountain ‼️
when youngboy get off house arrest and do his first show it’s gone be crazy! but the 🏔️ in utah look amazing as well as his house!
JASON THE DIFFRENCE IN TOPS LIFE
He all alone there no people no house no car dam broo just mountain

Yhe way yb look st sum 1 weird😂😂and uncomfortable
Nah dat song hard 😂😂😂😂💯
Oh God

Stay off drugs kids
I’m very sure that YB was talking to himself when he said “man your talking too much” listen to what he was saying before the switch
Goat 🐐 YB
This man just laid a song in under 5 minutes🤯🤯🔥🔥👑
I wish he could just talk normal listening to him gives me brain damage but I miss da old yb

This man’s eyes tell a long story of death and pain.
Shoutout to the random uneaten cheeseburger mackin on the table the whole interview

When you surround yaself with people who only say YES, everyone else does talk too much I guess
Bro really different 🔥
He's high asf 😅

Nice scenery  of his home 🏡 🤗
He don’t even sound like NBA young boy I really think them white boys really controlling him like his producer’s JASON
He just blanked . Literally the greatest
This nikka a next level performer
I’m now fluent in the language of Activis
He needa drop that lil song he js created 😭🔥😮‍💨!
I’d be scared if I was in the studio with yb 😭😭.
only place you’ll find this mf is locked away in his dungeons
Drop this
Tbh I don’t like this man’s music, but the vibe in the studio session is like no other
SOS DOPE
why they make the interview so ominous
Jason the hype man 🔥 I can’t wait til they go on tour 🤷🏽‍♂️🎯
the youngboy in its natural habitat
Drop the lean youngin
That song released?
People in here really looking up to youngboy 😂😂😂😂
When bro raps..shi jus a yap sesh

Surprised this kid is still alive
“You talking to much” Proceeds to Drop a garbage song. 😂😂😂
That last thank was fr he meant that. The world never gon look at him the same after this, a positive light
Why he so polite doe
How imma greet mfs when they come to my house
His producer faking hard
“li top niggha, ride round inna droptop w ah stolen glock”😭😭
that boy top had a mood swing “mann, you talking too much” 😂
Real Krabbypatty in the background 😂he know  the secret formula
Thank You Jason😮‍💨💯✅ coldest engineer/hype man
The interviewer thinking yb is gonna hit him when he told him he was talking too much is crazy 😂😂😂😂
Dis how he recorded return of goldie
I fw YB but that house look depressing asf
This is some low iq type of music. I don’t see the hype in this song at all
This how i record especially off da gas
jason was in that mf piped up 😂😂😂
YB was friendly but protective at the same time. He made NBA. Don’t ever forget that.
Watching him record he sounded like a whining kid , i cant lie 😂
This is an influential person in America. What a disgrace we have come to and it’s horrible for black music too he has no talent for Nothing.
y’all gone ignore him saying he is in a demonic industry, and that he accepted the fact his being used as entertainment. That’s fw his mental and you can tell. Praying for YB🙏🏽❤️
Homie drinking lean
Top  A DIFFERENT Breed
Bro really just told him “you talking too much man” like this ain’t a interview💀💀💀top something else
YB is the type of person I'll never want to get close to no matter his status.
We need more interviews like this showing bts of his music process
Yb tuff in soul
Why he put that voice on
You can feel da pain u can see da hurt
Thought he was married
Timeout who shawty 😂😂
Something not right with him.
I feel like the industry was behind the judge decision on just putting him on house arrest. They have a plan behind Yb and they know they just chewing him up rn cause his name is hot but watch when they don’t need him anymore.
I done watch this mufucka at least 10x 😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I be tryna imagine yb back outside and I’m ngl he still gone be on that bs😂😂
"something aint right in Utah"-- Dj akademics 😂😂😅
He's production unit is crazy... Didn't expect it to be that good 😂
Nba the goat fr
Yb and me just a like we got anxiety, depression, and paranoia😂
This interview was weird how y’all felt about this, I didn’t like the energy if yk what I mean like vibe it was weird like something is off, maybe I’m trippin, someone let me know?
YB in his own world, raw talent
mysterious kid
son is doodoo
Ain’t no way y’all think this hard
Lawdddyyyy dude him frrrr⛹🏾‍♂️⛹🏾‍♂️
Jason’s great😂
Don't do drugs kids
This guy need Jesus
Thanks COMPLEX!!!!
He needs help it’s so obvious.. why is no one helping him? He’s abusing drugs and obviously hurting in the inside. Send help!
to sum his behavior n everything up is that he sold his soul n destroyed his life
Drop tha ✍🏾
bro that’s not yb😂😂😂
😂😂🤣🚼You're talking too much man,,
That’s that Molly bih u talking too much
Why he all aggressive at the start
I love the Cosmo and Wanda cars
This interview went tupac real early
Jason got turnt for a second lol
Havin wp tell your story lol I’m done with entertainment industry
he actually said “we talkin too much”😂
Lets Get Active should be the name of this SONG 🎶 💯🫡
Bro just gave us a sneak peak of him making a hit
When he started rappin I lost it 😂
Complex blew it don’t ask him no questions just record bruh
The demon inside of him stopped him from talking,please guys stop listening to this demonic artists and give your life to Jesus Christ
Boy bout gone mane😂 let that boy leave 🤣🤣
the music real
2:21 is he talking to the youth? The whole interview looks like a horror movie fr 😰
I blame the judge for keep ĺetting him abuse prescription drugs the wrong way
Speechless Fr  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐐
GraveDigger mountain album otw😂
Art? This is nonsense
What is this garbage?
Pay attention to what he says about the industry, and kept it real and said he chose to be apart of it, much respect to youngboy, can’t get no realer than that, no excuses at all, straight realness 💪🏾
All I can say I am from Louisiana and have affiliate with people who know him and when he first came into the industry,The young man had more life in him. He isn’t happy and he’s older so his conscious is more evolved and Now he knows what he signed up for. My heart goes out to him cause I have had an invitation to join Satans army for my talent, but I walked away
Jason ancestors rolling over in they grave right now😂
Nba is a lil different.. a lil weird.. but hes dope and has mad talent…
The best 10 minutes I ever watched
This ain’t no sneaker interview
Song name??
Dude rubbed him the wrong way “mane you’re talking too much”  and YB made a song 😭😭😭🔥🔥☠️💨
NBA spilt the beans a lil there… he didn’t want Joe to talk on what he just said. Listen and take in what hes saying…
4:39 bro started sounding like my car 😂
NBA YoungBoy's body guard was not lying when he said YB is weird
Yo said I have a bad memory nice to meet you he'll nooo yu better remember yo I mean my memory are Bad but I'm not forgetting yu once we meet good or bad that's on my parents grave
He treated him with the most respect at least🔥🔥
Yall missing the important part , DEMONIC INDUSTRY and like he said can’t speak to much cuz it continues
Bro just made the meanest fkn song bruh fr
4:57 searching for my ops😂🥷🏻💥
Crazy intro 💀😂

i thought the intro was gta
Yb need to drop that song Jamaican flow
Yb made a song off the top 👏
I love him but he's crazy.
Dranked out
Youngboy don't pretend to be other person just to please someone, he is himself no matter what, that's rare
Ehh I think he should do a nice rebranding, to the point where he drop this Youngboy Moniker and Name…He should put heavy emphasis on that Top name
Bro how this video drop to #5 on trending in 50 mins😂
Hes most likely gonbe be dead next year rip
Bro living in the mountains
You can hear the pain in he’s voice
He goin in studio sess on point
Is nobody gonna talk about the girl that walked in with him? What happen to jazz
They got him
"i hate the new yb, the bad mood yb, the always rude yb, spazz in the news yb. i miss the old yb straight from the go yb,set on his goals yb, chop up the soal"
This kinda embarrassing
Demonic industry 🤔
LIT 🔥
Gotta love this rented houses... And cars... And watches 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Why he look sad
Joe NGL bro hella respect to for doing this bro rs 💯
Nah them mood swings and his whole demeanor screams pills
Yb introduction is gold itself 😂😂
That song goes crazy
He don’t write his raps too straight off the dome
Why didn’t he show yb the old video they made before to try and help him remember 🤦🏾‍♂️
#2 on trending tuff glad y’all doing interviews with yb fr
Yb better 🥷🏾
Imma treat y’all with the most respect.. ever
who else watching from California
The scariest interview ever
Writing would do YB wonders…
💚💥🔫
When Jason started turning up 😂
What’s the name of this song he did
Grave digger mountain
Are we ignoring that he is doped up out of his mind? That man’s half dead.
Bro is now going mad😭 free him
Youngboy high off nail paint
Mans is literally carrying hip hop on his shoulders nearly alone atp. The rap game is sick with so many fake hittas tho..the Real ones gotta be militant lyk him
i could freestyle a beat one take
This song harder then the whole album🔥
These rappers feel themselves to much and forget the ppl that help put them there….
Dawwg dat ay kmon les record sum different 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Drinking lean while on house arrest is crazy😳
Bro he need to drop tha song
So yall miss the whole "its a demonic industry"👀
He said “we talkin too much” in regards to the industry- he realized they was talkin to much when the interviewer was about to ask that last question. Folks be on point fr
Mane bipolar 😂😂😂
“ I got a bad memory, it’s nice to meet you “ this isn’t the same young boy he did sneaker shopping with the voice ain’t even the same
I bet this interview was longer than 10 minutes but dude so weird and trying to be this anti social dude that got all this attention complex was like nah delete all this other b.s 😂😂😂
Free yb from house arrest
😊😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅
I can't keep defending this dude anymore 4:54
he told the interviewer he talking to much 😂
Can we start a petition to get this man off house arrest??? I pray he be released from all things that hunt him he seems scrambled Lord help him he need you I need you to heal him Amen
Why came out the like the grinch when he finally let them come to his cave 😂😂🤣
Free YB
did bro just say it’s a demonic industry and he chose to be apart of it 🤔
Hopefully you guys are down to do another vlog or interview with him when he gets better or off house arrest cause this turned into a studio vlog so quick 😭
I see why all of the songs are different it's all of the top of the head
If you think this dude makes “art” , go get your head checked!
This the new micheal Jackson
This man is on hella drugs pray for this young man he’s a victim
Despite his inability to communicate. Youngboy is a genius. He’s too real for society in a way
The first artist to turn a complex interview into a Stu session!! The goat !
Bro just made a lowkey hit 😅
24 years old and "Black" in America 🇺🇸🧐 I see a "Drug Addict" with "Mental health issues" he needs alot of "Therapy" praying for youngin 🙏🌍💵🇯🇲
Loved the new video 🙏🏼🙏🏼💯 I have so much respect for nba youngboy  🙏🏼🙏🏼.
That song hard af is it out now? Ridin round wit a stolen car
Definitely Joes hardest interview to date.. NBA is hard work!!
I know the interviewer highly uncomfortable 😂😂
🔥
Yb funny 😂😂
Goofy ahh possesed guy
love this dude bruh 😭😭😭💚
Oh yuuh we need that song 🔥🔥🤞🏾💚
Bro is not in a good place man. Seems mentally unstable tbh. I pray he receives the health, hope, light, and love he needs 🙏🏼
Call me whatever you want but don’t call me late for lunch 😂👈🏻
When the clip started I thought it was GTA for a minute
BRUH THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIS HOUSE ARREST NBA YOUNGBOY IS CLEARLY GETTING MENTALLY ILL
so glad yb ain worried about no mess 🥹💚
So I’m not a fan nor do I listen to his music, why does he act like that? I’m asking the older followers not the kids who glorify him. Is he autistic? Is he bipolar? I’m not trying to be disrespectful but his demeanour is very irregular.
It seems cold af out there 🥶
What’s the song called 😩😩🔥
7:20
Raw asf
So anyb else miss 2018 top ?
💩💩💩4:51
Gravedigger
YB just better💚
He don’t take the goods benefic of the mountain with this codeine
My boy NAMED his spot  GRAVE 🪦 DIGGER MOUNTAIN 🏔️🏔️  HE'S THE REAL
Im reading the comments and i find it funny how majority of the comments doesn’t acknowledge what he said him knowing the industry demonic and they use him and it being self destructive…shi crazy like we really accepting all this bs
Everybody gone wanna do interviews like this now and make a song on it 🔥🔥🔥
YB wanted to tell bro ahh take a seat in the beginning all that standing over asking questions lame.
Ai said he searching for oppssss
Lean Flow 🥤
Lesson: Know your audience, listen closely, read body language. Sometimes you may think youre having a good convo but really just annoying the other person.
I'm 230 dayz out and Im watching young boy
He exposed the industry… its obvious he knows his time is coming … he’ll be a huge sacrifice
This kid nba young boy needs help 😅
Smh
🐐
Young boy too high bro😂😂type sh** im on right now 🍁
this is why yb is the goat
He ain’t gangsta he just need a hug.
so we not going to talk about these perfect burgers !!
Good interview but we just gone ignore the fact how he said he sold his soul and how the elites use him????
Bro YB always drugged 😭😭😭😭 he’s too funny and scary at the same time
So if he can’t leave the house how I this supposed to be real
Knowing that he knows this industry is demonic. This guy needs deliverance
He said “ ay we talking too much … not “ you talkin too much “ 😂
I hate this interview he not at his best mentally and emotionally I can tell cause he back on lean. I am praying for you Kentrell ❤
This why everybody hate him. He just a goofy
need song
"It's all in my heart" But points at his head😂 6:53  He hella high that's for sure 😅
Lol what a 40m0
I could’ve sworn he said we gotta finish it
Mane the goat fr 🔥stopped the interview and give em a first hand look at how make hits really just helped the platform ever more💯
Y’all should’ve asked what he thinks of all A.I. Youngboy songs on YouTube or ask him about his song No Sleep.
I see now That “ you talking too much” Wasn’t personal it’s what people here to see but no script 🤷🏾‍♂️💯 I agree If you interview me let it be a conversation not a narrative driven interview
Mans went for a interview came back with a unreleased song 💀
Some of your closed captions aren’t accurate.
Always listen to Top…
Yooo YB wild for that
"Art" 🤣
Amazing Kentrell 👑
That was a real man hand shake
Producer got turnt😹😹
Wow… so beautiful and so so painful. Saying so much yet absolutely nothing at all. I appreciate this person for being so vulnerable. I appreciate his people and complex for offering this opening ended display of support. This is a difficult situation for all involved, yet y’all presented “a way” (I can’t think of a good word to describe it). Interviewer can be so intrusive-words, questions, plans can be so loaded. Sometimes observations, the picture being worth a 100 words, is the most informative and enlightening way to encapsulate a message. Art all around.
This the funniest craziest interview
Yb just literally made me fear being a musician 😕
YB stressing me I hope my inspiration ain't gon die 😪 yb don't look too good 😕 we need to save him fr 💔
Yb betta drop dat song🕺🏻🕺🏻🔥🔥🔥
This man is crying out for help.
We love you yb 💚
Demon 👿👿👿.getting ate alive

Release this man off house arrest already
This fool straight Rockstar, this complex special and this dude really could careless
Young boy é louco 🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro don't even got the Kaotic Eyeball he got thr Alctron 😂🔥
I didn’t know if I was watching a  interview or a episode of Goosebumps 😂
Youngboy never disappoints💚🔝☝️
Man the worst bars I ever heard in my life😂😂
Guy ya'll need to stop entertaining this behavior of Top, what he's doing is cool and all that... But the man really needs help, he really been trying to tell us it's serious, let's rather figure out a way to get Top some help!!!
4:00 how’s the interviewee gonna tell the interviewer he talkin too much 🥴💀
That Should Definitely Be The Name Of Whatever Song He Just Made 😂🤌🏾
That drank in the video can be used in court, gotta be moving silently.  Sad because you can clearly see the house arrest is taking a huge toll on him...
2:04 I felt that walk off 😭💀 🚪🚶🏾‍♂️
Made a song in 5 minutes that was better than all your favorite rappers combined 🐐
So is every artist in this generation this f*cking weird or is it just this socially handicapped/  traumatized kid?
Tryna get active what’s happening 🥷
Its getting harder to rock out without actually rocking out he yb and he got the voice but he held down cant rap about nun cause he can't move
Mk ultra is crazy 🤦🏽‍♂️
Demonic industry is right...I hope he is ok behind it all.  Yikes, he doesnt look good.
Insane talent 👏🏽
Gravedigger Mountain
Give jason his flowers
I had the opportunity of meeting your mom, and showed her the cover arts I’ve created for you YB. I was born with one hand, and faced so much adversity growing up. I thought I wasn’t gonna be able to take care of myself as a man and my family. I was denied my childhood dream of going to the navy seals. Watching you give out game and showing us it’s possible through your page continues to inspire and motivate me to be the best version of myself and to stay focused on my purpose. I’m Manifesting that I’ll be at 1Million Subs one day and I wanna say I thank you for being that inspiration Kentrell 🙌🏾

The Goat Fr 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Watching your creative process was insightful. Your commitment to your work is noteworthy. You've shown the effort involved in each track's creation. Looking forward to hearing your new work. Keep innovating.
Is everyone ignoring how he said it’s a demonic industry 😂
That was mad disrespectful. Organize your day so you don't have to cut the interview short. The interviewer who came to your house. They're literally your guest and you just cut them off so you can scream garbage on the mic. This guy is mentally ill. He needs help.
At Home in the Safe Zone
"Man you talkin too much"
For quite some time I’ve been trying to understand this kids music I’m still not intrigued, it just sounds like a bunch of rara
fire salute young 5 doing his thing
Top really losing himself man

I see he’s really trying to change you could tell he was a demon keep it going bro
Young girl gone 🚮

Whats wrong with this guy 😂
Jason definitely top tier engineer
🤣🤣
😂😂😂
Strange guy to say the least
New Michael Jackson
I bet this was the most complex interview ever😆😅
I used to feel bad for some if the yutes but they know and are fully aware of what they do and put out to the youth, sry lil dog it's all about the cash for u, that's why u surrounded by evil 🤷🏽‍♂️
U can tell bro hurt
he said "you on gravedigger mountain" 😂

He got a bad memory..yea right...clone
What’s crazy is this man made a song that’s for sure getting a million views once it drop on YouTube in less than 30 mins

Dude crying for help and nobody notices it
Gifted
6:33 he said “I’m rusty” not “I’m resting”
The world can never fulfill you. Only Jesus can. He will find Jesus. He is in pain you can tell, & he said it himself it’s a demonic industry & he’s running with it, also it’s self destructive. Pray for NBA Youngboy. Jesus loves you.
One minute this man on “stop the violence”, it’s all love type energy. The next he out here projecting a type of character that he’s not to be F’d with looking like he on ALL the drxgs 💉💊. Reality is even funnier than the movies.
Yooooo!!! Complex Thank you!! 😮‍💨🔥💯
Yooooo!!! Complex Thank you!! 😮‍💨🔥💯
Yb went off on everyone 😂

It’s a demonic industry bruh whaaaa
“I chose to be apart of a demonic industry” Shesh I love you top don’t let em break you 5️⃣💚
I just hope when he get off house arrest and start doing shows and tours that nothing happens to him whether it be jail/prison or some type of altercation.. the rap game has already lost wayyy to many talented artist, we need ppl like YB and Yak to stay healthy and free for as long as they can be
top is so inspirational
Fastest I ever seen a song get made
Bye I woulda left cause he just Retarted 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only these mf get to interview yb haha
"Jason man im fuxked up im out my minddd" dat boii snapped fashoo 🐐🔥🔥
He said we tlkn too much as in about the "indrustry" and his situation of "not being a entertainer" if u can catch the drift
W jason W Yb
Let this man off house arrest for real
gimme a engineer and producer and i can turn up like that too😤 (im in htx for any upcoming producers that wanna try to lock in)
dam w3ird0 jajaja
I’m honestly not impressed. Bro looks like he’s an addict and needs help. Really weird that others aren’t noticing.
YB better than any 💚
I bet lil rye watching this taking notes😂
It’s like if Micheal Jackson was evil
I got a bad memory
Top one of a kind
No one talking on how he mentioned he chose to be apart of the demonic industry ???
Straight greatness

I can’t be the only one who cringed listening to his voice while he recording
Green flag activity.🤮🔥
Looking like a horror documentary 😭💀
NBA making music like Wayne
He canceled the interview and dissed the interviewer instead
"Keep your nails done b**ch" 💀💅🏿
“Engineer top flight”.
The greatest of all time
THEY USING ME AS ENTERTAINMENT! IM NO ENTERTAINER
👍🏾💯💯🔥
spoke to cuh like he was a creature😂
“No, thank you” felt that 🔝🏔️ That was raw
Joe thought he was doing an episode of closets and ended up watching this man make a whole song 😂
That man just be in his house tweaking all day ain’t none of yall notice that yall just wanna talk ab the song. 😢
Bro jus chillin inna corner onna couch at the end yooo😭😭😂

🥷🏾🥷🏾🥷🏾
Why youngboy exposing is self out like that 😂

Demonic industry
Hands down one of the best interviews from nba

That’s a weird young man but you can tell he has a good heart

Jason n Top snapped on that song within a blink of an eye
Such  a good actor 😂
Mental health is a real thing! Big up to JLP for keeping it professional and for putting up with all that
Bro be so fried tho 😂 Idk what he be on but I’m glad it don’t affect his work ethic .
Yb>>>>>>
im a big fan of youngboy but dont do lean bros
This interview was short because they were vibing during "playback" of tbe song, then YB abruptly told him to "get out"! 😂
Yk these always turnt ✡️🤞🏽
Nah YB Different😂🔥
He definitely needs to stay away from major urban cities cause he's too valuable n for sure don't go back to baton rouge. Get in n get out, I don't listen to him cause I'm older but he's very talented and a generational figure, he can transition into jazz or soul when he gets older that's the type talent he has.
😂😂😂yb crazy ❤
Greatest
Top trying, he seen alot so ,imagine the view .
Am not an entertainer 😢
The greatsest ever💚
🤣🤣🤣 yb a gangster fosho
🤣🤣bx flashed
That was hella odd and made second hand embarrassment for joe lol
🔥🔥
This dude's ego is hilarious.. hes a B- Artist..
Needs to drop🔥🔥
Name of this song
Subscribe if you think video will hit a mill !!
It takes young men like yb to change the way the young men operate… BLACK PEOPLES MUST START OUR OWN RELIGION… STOP DESTROYING OURSELVES… STOP DEPENDING UPON OUR ENEMIES… RESPECT OUR QUEENS… FEAR NOTHING AND PROTECT EACH OTHER…🌈
YB music is kind trash
How is he still on house arrest if he won the trial
80% of the captions wrong & misleading especially saying he told dude he talkin too much when he ain’t say that
DROP THA TRACK!!!

Youngboy , past, present, future… nothing matters… we all human… we all make mistakes… peace gone be difficult to find… therefore… live in the moment… live ur best life❤️
Heavy drugs
What did I just witness?? Gravedigger mountains 😭this dude told that man "you talking too much." Youngboy needs to be hospitalized because aint no way this man is highly functioning or functioning at all. I can't get these ten minutes back🤣🤣 take bruddah off house arrest. Brodie sipping lean and smoking cigarettes. Bad combo. Nasty work.
Why they shoot this like its a paranormal activity movie
YB Fa President

BIG S/O to Jason for keeping Youngboy sane and coaching him through his obstacles💯 We need more ppl like him in this world..
This dude ever getting off house arrest??

Hi young boy.
crazy how he made the song like that 🔥
Put this man in a mental hospital
Man u talking to much bro 😂😂😂
Everyone heard the music but missed the message.
Ash that square and eat the sandwich bro
Tell top drop this 😂😂😂💚
Gravedigger mountains is outrageous 😂😂
Is just meeee ,Jason Engineering that’s my closest friend …..
Ok, this says more about the engineer MORE than anything else. He is lucky to have his producer. This dude was so wasted and literally yelling baby talk into the mic.  You don’t need to be on some Rick Rubin zen stuff to produce a good album but LITERALLY how can the fans feel good about listening to this knowing their fav artist cant be giving this his all and can hardly function because how wasted he was. His crew should have really protected him a bit more and not let him get on camera like that. Just my opinion.
I talks exactly how he rap 😂
this mf basically freestyles every song this for the people that say he fell off, this says diff making hits off the dome
this is actually insane, i don’t think i’ll ever listen to any of his music but this just showed me the genius  behind himself and his supporters.
lol junk
I know dude was scared the whole time while in that interview
" No Thank You "
He high just saying anything n y’all follow this clown? He look like a cluck fr
No way bro don’t remember the sneaker guy😂😂😂

It shows music u don't gotta put to much thought. If it comes from the heart it gonna be felt right . I mess with YB all day ❤. Thank you complex , u was patient with YB interviewer & Cameraman 💜 even if it wasn't what y'all came to do . YB different n I see y he don't like alot of ppl he antisocial n he don't care to tell u he don't like you in your face 😂😂❤

💚💚💚
😮
that song so hard
He sound like a baby
He back on them drugs y’all lol
I think he is tired of being on house arrest as well its time those people let him off and live
Everything an artist pushes, implying that they sipping on lean, smoking, and getting their nails done.....is in their contract to push those things. I'm 40+ years old, never got my nails done and I'm fine.
Triple cup my Styrofoam 😂
what a joke lol, get off the lean bozo.
Forever dumber for watching this
He needs to name the song gravedigger mountain
No lie YB talented fr
This song Going Gold already 🔥 🔥
He’s clearly mentally disturbed and yall ain’t even say one word about it in the comments. Pray for this brother man.
Crazy to compare this interview to his complex sneaker shopping video.
Jason I’m out ma mind ❤
My boy Top Da Dada
blood that was a crazy way to kick off the interview 😂😂😂😂😂
Pray for this young man
i need this song foe yb foe i need this song foeee
We needa get him off house arrrst he need help
Where can i get a hype man like jason😂😂
Little off topic but any of my music people in here can answer this for me? How does his vocals not sound boxy* in a untreated room like that with a lot of reverberation  Literally also you can tell that mic is def picking up all that squeaking on the chair. I run a TLM 103,Apollo,  khaotica eyeball and my vocals sound decent but cam never really get rid of the boxy Sound
Not one conversation about shoes 😂
Dat studio mix was too raw 💥💚
Bro really got a good heart tho
What’s that sweater?
This whole interview was dark and sinister lowkey
Lol the song was low key hard fr
😕 He needs to be off of house arrest!!!!
Can uu make these interviews with yb longer
How supreme going use youngboy and not break em off some  🤦‍♂️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I see they make sure he’s high.he cant even talk
Greatest Most Entertaining Interview Ever….So Raw And Unexpected… 💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yea bruh gt Issues 😂😂😂
I honestly would like Bobbi to try and interview YBNBA just to see how uncomfortable she'd be (or maybe they'd find common ground who knows).
Y’all go watch “Bring em out “ by Youngboy 🔥🔥
Everyone saying how monumental this was when it looks like he needs help. God bless
🔥🔥🔥
🔥
We all need to say a word of prayer for YB because this man is suffering from something serious! He’s begging for help…
He better drop this song tho
That song he recorded was 🔥🚮
This boy is gone, man…I hope he is only high for real! I'm not his fan but it's sad to see a young man, so rich and living a dream but with his mind destroyed…When he talks talking how the music industry is a demonic industry you can see that it's not good up there in his head for real….
4kt 🇯🇲💚

I mean the cadences, the raw vocals, the rich sweet and organic beats,I'm blown away! The lyrics, the melodies, and the overall production are simply amazing. This album is a masterpiece and a true work of art. Thank you Kentrell for sharing your talent with the world 🐐 the word play the storytelling, and the lyrics on this is just astounding.

NBA act like he can’t handle interviews 😆; his whole attitude vibe was off to me , and the fact he a Libra ♎️: I’m still shocked and disappointed; most Libra men are the sweetest and loving and welcoming. He could do better with additude just saying 🤷🏾‍♀️.

YB is the new Wayne….dropping music left n right. He definitely off the lean, but that’s what house arrest will do. It’s a prescription. Hope he he gets thru this 💯
Joe was talkin to much 😂
Grave digging mountain 😂😂
Free YB
YB Better
Super authentic and different interview that’s for sure! Y’all already know we here sending those daily positive vibes from Houston everyone!
Gravedigger mountain 🏔️ has me rolling!
Jason turnt up fr lol
Damn....I felt a certain uneasiness throughout the video
He acts and looks like my dad who has been on drugs for 30+ years. Is he always like that or is he acting?
LFG 🐐🐐 s/o JASON 🔥🔥🔥
I feel like I just lost brain cells!
Jason a whole mood
That mane told him he talking to much.
YBBETTER💚

Love you man❤
Free NBA
Is he okay? Or is he just always like that?
FREE YB THE GOAT🐐😤
Joe sketched out lol
Faded to the extreme
YB hella weird
29:12 literally NO ONE said we should become one political party yet he slid the whole conversation to discussing the merits of a one political party system.  This is why I can't be on either side.  They don't debate the points and just shift the discussion to the most extreme possibility on the other end to improve the strength of their position
i swear hes missing some chromosomes.
Trying too hard to be tough lol
It’s so up when he gets off house arrest
Y’all should have looked at the sneakers
🤞🏽🖤💚
