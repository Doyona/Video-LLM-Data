This is on my YouTube playlist for on my school bus 😂
Hidden talent, keep it hidden 🗣🔥🔥🔥
#1 favorite song ❤❤❤
damn instead of listening to this ass fucking song you should watch the 1986 Transformers The Movie for some real bangers! the soundtrack is really good and the animation is stunning for what amounts to an hour long toy commercial from the 80s'!
bro spelled "reckless" wrong lol

Damn! This shit ass!

Hi babymax gusto mo bang gawan natin ng tono yung sulat mo❤

Dream you can’t sing for shit gravy, carried the entire song
WE BE WEARING A MASK WITH A SMILE WIT THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️

That minecraft line from yung gravy was too cold
Can u sing worlds smallest violien
child lover 😮
I think solo was better... No offense
this is shit
made me stop my edging streak instantly become non erect.
this is so skibbidi
honestly idc what anyone says, i may not like dream but he makes good songs sometimes
percentage of good stuff on this song = percentage of hatching a dragon from the dragon egg
Dream-best singer who I know 🫶
I hate dream with a burning passion and the fanbase but I guess you could do worse, it’s decent
a song like a "dream" ✨ .. sry😂
one of the songs of all time
"dream plays hoes", no he 'plays' minors
I only like dream's  song.

If dream starts playing games he should make a dream smile mask but which is VR mask
I really like this one

This song gave me goose bumps

aight aight aight but jokes aside, this is actually not too bad. It's a song.
i like this song 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
To anyone that says this is not a good song: don't eat sh*t
I love music of his❤❤❤
Thought you were saying "confront this feeling" after listening enough times I wonder if people would argue about that if you didn't post this like they did with Fall Out Boy in like 2012
yung gravy’s entire thing is just having fun and goofing off on beats, but this is the first time where it sounds like he isn’t having that much fun. damn.
omfg i wish i knew you made music sooner
Sus remix 💀
Banger

gravy carried that, you can tell gravy and dream either wrote their own parts or someone different did dream's part because my man dream got the bars, enstate prohibition.
XDDDD DREAM IS SHIT
zzzz
🤩👍
This one is so good
this is much better then the mask.
Dream, this is sill your life. Its ok if you want a new dream, just don't mess it up with or without an audience
dream what happened to your minecraft channel
when you realize that most of dreams community is like 12 this song becomes a little worse.... also yung gravy's part was literally just him bragging, that isnt rap, be more like actual rappers next time, dream should do a cover of rap god
This song reminds me of that one time I broke my fucking arm throwing a dodge ball
Minecraft backpack reference thanks . 😅
Your cloning aporatis has opening
I can't believe dream has come this far I LOVE THIS! We all love dream 😻
I have been on Everest once idk where i was higher on Everest or when im hearing that song
Good 🥴👌
Its truly happy for you dream and i know all of your followers and subscribers are as well and its a disappointment that your manhunt videos stopped but i will support you and whatever your true passion is
Good luck on your new passion 👍
Wow
I wonder if Dream is a Roomie fan, this sounds like the music he could make.
Have a good day🙂
This is horrible only the 10 and 12 year olds like this it’s so bad
this is great don't get me wrong!......but I would like to see more manhunt videos!
I dont like dream but this is actually such a banger
This is master peace
He done so well😊
Lmaooo the part where gravy says I linked dream now he’s playin hoes and I started playin Minecraft had me dying literally the best line of lyrics I’ve heard all year incredible song
Cringe
Minecraft man hunt?
First Dream song where the feature doesn't carry and loses me in the song.
WE TOUCHING GRASS WITH THIS ONE🗣🗣🔥🔥
Dream x Gravy 💀
soooo cool😍
You know what I hate? That kids think they are cool if they hate all his songs for no reason, like they probably don't even listen to them and just jump to hate comments
Do 6 hunters already
i hate this song
Dreams vocals are the corniest thing ever but gravy carried
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO THIS IS SO GOOD YOU'VE GONE SO FAR KEEP GOING ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Banger!!
My most favourite songs of dream are 1. Everest 2. Change my clothes 3. Until I end up dead  4. Mask
Que buena canción la voy a escuchar un montón de veces 🧐
ngl yung gravy carried this ass song
Happy birthday dream! 😊😊
Dream if you are reading this i went to say pls come back to manhunt videos your videos are great and I will always watch your minecraft videos I hope you can come back to manhunt I am dying to 6 hunter ❤ : )
Dteam can you come to China to climb Mount Everest？😂
"i linked dream with a fine lass, now hes playing hoes and i started playing minecraft" that line is actually fire
Your heard him smh.. he’s high

Happy Birthday Dream
My cousin named her baby Everest the day you post this song so know she plays it for her baby

Man I swear Dream's Song's Are Inspirational right after he Showed he's Face Reveal Ig
"So High Like I'm On Everest" We Know Dream, We Know💀
Dream started playing hoes and I    Started playing minecraft 😮
Song is cool, but I'm not a fan of the rap part. It just break completely from the rest, in lyrics, music and clip (in the clip video). The tone shift is just weird, and it break the rythm of the song. I guess it was for the feat.? But honestly not sure this was the best song for such a feat. it really doesn't mesh well.
George better slap him😡
dream is ass  fight me
This is some motivational music I love this ❤
The goat is back 🐐
I feel so bad for Dream man. All the people that forced him to put the mask back on just weren’t real ones, but the real ones are still here. We got your back man
you did it again Dream, this is good
Reminder that if you can't say what's actually wrong with the song in a negative comment then it's invalid. Dream's improving, this chorus is pretty catchy. Keep it up :)
i expected this to be shit, it wasn't
Hola
Not the usual Yung gravy song
Dream, your songs helped me through some tough times. you may not realize it, but thousands of people are blessed by your songs. Keep up the good work! 🥲

The amazing thing is that the background music of note blocks starts from the very beginning and fits perfectly throughout the whole song
Sounds like a marshmello song ngl
Why every youtuber tries to become a singer 😂😂😂
Dream should make a song with other melody rappers like post malone, drake or gunna.
Dream listens to DrippinSoPretty I bet.
ok
Hey Dream. Have a good day love your music never give up. I don’t wanna see you being brought down by people it just makes me sad.

Espero algún día poder hacer una colaboración contigo ;/ aunque sea difícil;[ (soy de México) me esforzaré en mi canal de twitch para lograrlo, lo prometo :")
"Seperating the art from artist" is this song to me cuz i hate dream and cuz GYAT DAMN dream and yung gravy be spittin straight bars 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 User-ec7 where you the hell you at !? b***h
Need an albulm of collections
jokes aside the song is a banger.
Okay but dream this so good keep it up
Hey alexa, how many minor youtubers can you fit in the tesla
Omg
🫶
dream try to make a good song impossible challenge
Hopefully it's just weed tho 😢❤😂
I'm only here for Yung gravy
Your not a singer bruh 😭
Drem Garvy 🔥
i love your musc will you do another smp?
-hey fream i saw your first version of this song
That is legit dreams house
Best collab ever never expected it to happen from my favourite artists
Honestly, this song to me reminds me of how I feel about Techos' death. But it's really good.
Honestly I’m not tryna hate but he should focus on music rn I mean his voice is kinda good and he should try more music and branch out I say that as a non dream fan, music kinda w ngl
Another 'Dream song', another cool song! :)
Yooooo
I love Dream and Yung Gravy, banger.
This song would be nothing without gravy
GRAVY
That movie Limitless was a banger
So...people told me George and Sapnap sing in here, yet... I don't hear them... If you know where they sing can I get the timestamps?
kay why ess (not respectfully)
Are you done with Minecraft and the dream Chanel I’m so confused pls comment and tell me
My two favorite artists having a collab wasnt on my 2023 bingo card
fuck dream but this song is fire
that's what the mask is
Gravy is 🔥🔥🔥
honestly good redemption from that the mask shit
dream have a brilliant voice❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
This is trash
This is actually fire ngl
love u dream❤
I'm begging put lyrics in bio it's MUCH easier
this song is a vibe

Yea 0:38
yung gravy’s part >>>
This deserves way more views
SUPERB !!!!
dear god this is horrid
bro took hold of the music industry from technoblade
Ngl, some of these comments are dead ass rude.   ANYWAY. I'll always love your content and I really like this song and I can see the improvements from your first one. Good job on this song Dream!
Fire!
let's be honest here the only good thing about this song is gravy it only has views because he has 30 mil subs and he only gets 300k views that shows it is not good (except for gravy)
Les GOOOOO  Love Ur Songs
dream has actually progressed so much, this shit is actually listenable, or its just gravy counter balancing the cringe
dude i didnt think this was gonna be this good but damnnnnn!!!! im in love with this song well done dream.
DREAM PLEASE NOTICE ME, I don't have Twitter because i'm a Youtube person and I just saw someone uploaded a shorts video about you twitting and saying that you don't want to upload the song "Trust Issue". I'm wondering why da heck did you not upload that? IT'S SO GOOD! PLEASE UPLOAD THE FULL VERSION. I'm begging you to upload TRUST ISSUES song. If you don't wanna upload that, then maybe let us people that doesn't have Twitter to know reason of why you didn't upload it?  I'm so sad you didn't upload Trust Issues😞
this definitely is the music I would like to play repeatedly when I am free from my heavy workload :D
Ayyyy, epic collab! Amazing as always, great job King! 👏💚
awesome music dream, never expected this collab if imma be honest
Me personally I would’ve preferred it with gravy’s verse and collab

dream!!!!
Such a sick visual! Love this so much
I love this <3

Came from Yung TikTok and didn’t disappoint.
I have been having a hard time with life this month this really just helps me relax. thank you dream.

Can u teach me how to make song
My opinion on this song turns around every time when Gravy pops in <3

Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
Gotta say I definitely didn't expect this collab it's really good tho !
WHY DOES PPL HATE ON THIS MAN HES A LEGEND??
AWWWH MY HEART THE ENDING ALL OF THE DREAMTEAM SANG🥹
Common young gravy carry, bro out here breaking his back
is GOODDD
دریم چرا ویدیو نمیزاری توی چنل خودت
This is awesome!
😮I love this song sm, it's now one of my favorite songs😍
What are you high on dream? 😂
i will buy the album.  :)
Achievement made: Dream on 🔥 🔥
so goooooooood
Bro how is Yung Gravy on this 😭
DREAM UR HIGH?
Wow I genuinely didn’t expect this  to be good. 😅
Young gravy had a good verse ❤ dreams was trash 🗑️
i love that sapnap and george are included :]
Unrealease this rn
❤❤ so beautiful 😭
i actually really like this🫶🏻 the chorus is gorgeous
what an L song
Genuinely a good song!😀
Dream and Yung Gravy collab was not on my 2023 bingo card
This might be gravy's hardest verse
O.M.G is awsome this is song 🔥 🎶
oh
it's crazy how dream went from roadtrip all the way to this absolute banger
i came in with super low expectations but this was wayyy better than i expected. sounds like yung gravy might’ve written his lines, in my head the worst features they had to have forced him to follow those lines right? 1 critique is that i hate the “down down down” it takes it from real song to minecraft song to me even though that’s probably weird. change that line and this could’ve actually been added to my library.
he’s plays h0£s and i’m playing minecraft ❤
Gravy 🔥
‘now he’s playing h03s and I’m play Minecraft ‘ 💀💀  love the song btw 🫶🏻🫶🏻
We need a sapnap x dream collab
... Nah... this ain't it, fam... love all his other music, this one's not for me...
Another head bop❤
Banger 🔥
This is so SOTY!! :)💗💗
S tier.
Lit
love it so much
I wanna know who will be the 6 hunter
Loving the music recently.
This is my new favorite song of dream 😭💕
This man can make song so beautiful they make me cry of happiness
dude, the beginning of the song it’s like note blocks from Minecraft. Do you hear it?
THIS IN "LATE NIGHT DRIVES" >>>>>> 🔥🔥
We all love you!
Dnf
I didn't know Sapnap and George are in the song too! How come there are no credits in the description mentioning that?    Btw, AMAZING song my dudes!
Like the song keep up the good work.

This song is very Good
Es una hermosa canción ❤
An absolute banger. Well done Dream so proud of u! <3
Good job guys😍😍😍😍😍
HOW? YUNG GRAVY?
This is such a banger I don’t understand the haters
This feels like a aftermath of until I end up dead, I love you for doing this Dream. ❤
Not sure Yung Gravy’s lyrics fit with dream’s lyrics but overall it’s a good song 😊
*Adding to my Spotfy playlist*
im a day late but still planning to jam to ur songs dream!  gg king
🫥
Wait... this song is alright
you have such a good voice i reallyyy love your songs
YOO THIS IS ASS
Wait this goes hard- 😭🖤🖤
You deserve the world Dream keep on being you and reaching for the stars!
Dream got that side hustle 🔥🔥
Love it ♡
the audacity you had to drop this noise with a yung gravy ft  on the same day as big daddy T Scott is crazy
YUNG GRAVY???
Me encantó está muy bien 😊 y me gustó mucho el vídeo (jamás pensé que DREAM cantara asta qué se me ocurrió estar de chismosa 🤣) canta muy bien tiene bonita voz 😄 ( si hablo español si no entienden traducirlo✌️😎 )
One word.       WOW ❤amazing job dude
dream ruins the song tbh
Even my cat likes your music.
Ever since Dream has shown his face, his views went down. But on his Music channel- it went down too? These musics Dream is starting to make is epic! They need more views
i skipped to yung gravy's part
WHO DON'T LIKE DREAM, GET OUT AND NEVER COME BACK BECAUSE HE'S THE BEST AND HE DON'T NEED YOU HATERS TO JUDGE HIM.  Cool song man!❤
Pog
Dream what happen whit "total diconnection" and "because i'm paranoid"?
This is actually really good
<3
Never thought I'd be seeing this collaboration in my life, but DANG am I happy I did. Not only did it sound Great, but it also shows just how much you've improved over the years. You're making a lot of progress, and it definitely shows! I can't wait to hear the other songs you have slated for release this year, but until then, take some time to recover from your surgery.
estoy obsesionada desde que la escuche en el stream de spreen. Me encanta 🤍
loved this

FIRE BEST SONG DREAM
dude dreams songs are amazing.
Bro I love when he says "Call me crazy, I don't mind cause (IVE BEEN DOING THINGS I LIKE)" LIKE YES DREAM, YOU TELL THE HATERS!
Music video soon?
this is the certified song of the summer, you never disappoint dream, either it be videos or music. you helped me get through so much crap in my life and I can't thank you enough. you deserve nothing but the best and all the love.💚💚
It’s perfect
Perfection!
Its kind of sad some people feel like they aren't allowed to appreciate dreams voice because he is a minecraft youtuber. The dude can sing pretty damn well. Never thought he could.
To he honest. I don't like dream and only listening to this because of gravy but this is actually really good🤝👍
uau it's amezing
good work dream
❤❤❤ so good
george and sapnap voices blended in :,)
ngl Yung Gravy carried, but imo one of dreams better songs
Bro His Voice❤️❤️❤️
love u king!!! youre amazing!
My father always said…  “Life isn’t fun without a struggle in it, but some struggles lead to tragic endings.”

Good ❤
Good job dream!! Good shit
Amazing Video! Good job, Dream!!
Not really a fan of this type of music, but Gravy’s flow is bompin. Dreams vocals are great. But like i said, not a fan of this kind of feel good ‘safe’ type of beat, it surprised me with how good it actually was
OMG
：０
This is actually good
I don’t listen to Gravy but even after watching his tik tok about this song, I wanna say this  Whatever you paid him for that verse. Wasn’t enough. He killed that shit
This shit is ass dawg even gravy was dead 😭💀

The way that I somehow didn't even know this was a thing, then saw it on my recommended about 3 mins ago. I've listened to all his newly released songs live, and now I didn't even know this one was coming until almost a whole 24 hours afterward. It's a great song, and I love it 👍
OMG I LOVE THIS

Dream is improving his voice to the Music, It's truly amazing for him to have so much talent not only to be a God of Minecraft but also Music in this industry
This is surprisingly catchy
Dream paid a ridiculous amount of cash for this feature
i Fuck wit it!
QUE BUENA CANCION LOCO
The quality change from mask is so apparent in these recent songs, I'm excited to see the future of Dream's music

LYRICS:  Dream: I've been sleepin' in all day and starin' at the stars at night Call me crazy, it's okay 'cause I've been doing what I like I don't know how I still look up when I feel down, down, down Can't fight this feeling I love what life's been dealing, 'cause I'm  Dream: So high like I'm on Everest I ain't ever coming down, I ain't ever coming down Living life like limitless There's nothing else but right here, right now So high like I'm on Everest I ain't ever coming down, I ain't ever coming down Living life like limitless There's nothing else but right herе, right now  Yung Gravy: Still up on that mountaintop, gettin' mountain top Counting guap while she counting licks likе a Tootsie Pop (Woo) Watering your daughter while you're watering your crops And the only time I sell out is the day my album drops (Woah) Your mama call me pops, A1 wit' the sauce (Sauce) They love me at the dentist, baby, all I do is floss Got my money just right, call me Goldilocks Everything is iced out, Gravy on the rocks So fly, I'm a specialist Shorty at my residence throwin' it back like she tryna reminisce Holy Rollie, you would think I had like seven wrists Fuck the opps, like its enemies with benefits They tried to leak my tape, but it only fits on IMAX With my stamina, it's more like a timelapse I link Dream with a fine lass Now he's playing hoes, and I started playing Minecraft  Dream: So high like I'm on Everest I ain't ever coming down, I ain't ever coming down Living life like limitless There's nothing else but right here, right now So high like I'm on Everest I ain't ever coming down, I ain't ever coming down Living life like limitless There's nothing else but right here, right now  Dream: Lose the ticket, miss the plane Catch a sunset on the drive Say I'm reckless, it's okay I'll still get there right on time I don't know how I still get up when I've been down, down, down Can't fight this feeling I love what life's been dealing, 'cause I'm  Dream: So high like I'm on Everest I ain't ever coming down, I ain't ever coming down Living life like limitless There's nothing else but right here, right now So high like I'm on Everest I ain't ever coming down, I ain't ever coming down Living life like limitless There's nothing else but right here, right now
Such an amazing song ❤❤

I never in my life ever guessed of Dream and Yung Gravy would do a collaboration! Yall literally killed this music!
Don’t stop doing music dream pls
Why tf gravy why tf
If they learned how to make music. It would still be bad
This collaboration is awesome! I’m sorry but to me his music is pretty good❤
Had a great day. Its night time. And listening to this is making ne feel like my words are sung.

IM PLAYING THIS ON REPEAT
Roadtrip will always be the best song he has made though  Edit: ok nvm this one is the best ✋😭
Excuse me while I go put this amazing peice on loop for the next few hours while I go play Minecraft
i have a conspiracy theory: dream and gravy worked together because dream's fans are fatherless so gravy can fuck the mums
🥰💖
Ameee amer❤❤❤
You go, boy!
THIS IS A BANGER !!! I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG OMG 😍😍😍
It feels like Dream's found his voice. Obviously he's made multiple songs but the last couple have been consistent in his tone and balance to me. His music sounds like something Id hear when I was in 12. It's very well done. I'm glad he's making music since I can tell he's enjoying it a lot. Keep up the good work and I cant wait to see what you dish out next
Why is this actually a bop
bro this is trash dawg 💀
this is amazing!! never thought a dream and gravy collab would happen but yall voices matches so good! lov the song 🫶🫶
IT SOUNDS SUPER GOOD!!! congrats dream <3

Legend
THE NEW SUMMER SONG
This is honestly amazing, it’s insane just how far Dream has come <33
PEOPLE SAY HIII TO MEEE
This is just perfect🤌🏻
SLAYYYYYYYYYYY
singing still isn't the best and you're relying on auto tune and good production; lyrics aren't anything special but you're gradually getting better--atleast you're not nearly as bad as a soundcloud rapper--maybe eventually your music will be good. good job on improving
AMAZING AS ALWAYS
WILL ANYONE SAY HI TO MEEE
Just When I Thought The Song Will Be Clean It Drops The F Bomb🤬
DREAM, THIS IS SO GOOD IM SO PROUD OF YOU DREAM!!  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💚💚💚💚💚
YES FINALLY I LOVE IT

I love the fact u got George and Sapnap to sing with this
Never I thought dream would make the best collab ever
How the HELL are Dream's songs not on the radio yet!?!?! And if they are can someone let me know what channel or station please??!?!?!
🫶🫶🫶
When you've been listening to Yung Gravy and you see your homepage, and there's a Dream and Yung Gravy song. You both killed it, this song is awesome!
This is so catchy HELLO?
the only good part of this song is when Yung Gravy was singing
It's soooo good!!  Luviiiit
im so here for dream's music era, this song is a banger and I love how real it is
Dream know that we love your songs and everything you do. I HAVE SUCH AN AMAZING FEELING WHEN I LISTEN TO YOUR SONG AND NOTIFICATION FROM YOUR CHANNEL. As for the song, it's gorgeous. 😭I would love something from your shop related to songs (we will see with money) I would like to have a cd ❤ (If I'm not mistaken, because my English is a bit weak and I don't know if I understood correctly haha)
all the jokes inside but nice
HOLY SHIT?
i love you dream cause your songs give me motivation and i leissn to them when i train
this is by far the most catchy chorus from your songs imo, and i really like it! only thing is i wish sapnap and george’s voices were louder in the chorus, since i believe this is the song they sang in, because i can’t hear them at all and i was looking forward to that a lot. but im so excited to hear your new music!!
Can't wait dot the dreEP. I love this song so mutch allready
wtf?
AHHHHHH!! ITS SO COOL AAAAAA
OMG OMG ITS FINALLY OUT AAHHAHAHA ITS 2 IN THE MORNING BUT I DONT CARE OMG 🤭🤭
Dream & Yung Gravy, this is a great time to be alive! 🙏🏼🔥
OMG THIS IS AMAZING ❤
Honestly his songs are getting better. Don’t even like dream all that much
OMG THIS SOUNDS SO GOOD 😭✨✨🤩🤩

Best dream song with change my cloths
YESSS WOO ❤❤ AMAZINGG
I link Dream with a fine lass, now he's playing hoes and I started playing Minecraft 1:19

YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAA

Just woke up can't wait to listen to this 🤩 Update: As I thought the song was amazing I'm probably gonna listen to this on repeat for a few more hours, you did great Dream and all of us are proud of you :)
So high like im on Evereeeeest, I'm never coming down I'm never coming down
This sounds like a song
This makes me soooooo chill and it makes me want to dance and turn this up louder!  Keep up the good work dream!
I really like it i have list this song now on my head and I really like it and I hope Dream we’ll do one of the Dream team
Dont really care for yung gravys verse, its very high contrast to Dreams (like, M rated vs dreams E rating), ill probably find an edit thats just dreams part of this one lmao. Still, overall enjoyable song and I love Dreams range! Like, the amount of styles and genres he plays with in his music is super fun!
J'aime toujours autant les song de Dream ( feat ou pas )❤
Dreams parts: 🌧️☁️☀️😇😭😞😁  Gravy’s: 🥵🤩🌶️📞👩😈

Gravy Carry frfr

MAAAN, I LOVE IT
And whoever don't agree they're going to get slapped
I know this is fire
I'm from Poland and it's nice to hear. Regards 💚
HYPE listening non stop. i love the teasers for the album. if its as good as this, i am excited as hell
the beat is nice but i feel like the lyrics and or execution of them are a bit out of place
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT OMGGG 💕💕
nah cause that yung gravy verse actually hard
this is a good song, my 2 new favs are "Until i end up dead and Everest", what song is going to be next? and keep up the good work dream and also be more great every day. 💜💜💜💜
Dream isn’t MinecraftER, he is singer now!!!
early cs y u post at night
Another masterpiece music by dream
It's different. I like the beat and Dreams vocals. Yung Gravy just feels a little out of place, at least for me.
nice song❤
SO PROUD OF YOU 💕
oh my god 😭
ESTA VEZ TE LUCISTE DREAM!!
WHAT A NICE SONG
The song a banger and his skill are getting a lot better and taking on another level. ❤
the chorus is an absolute bop
beautiful Dream 😌💜💜  1:59
Another day another slay  I'm just SO PROUD
Wow I must have been so out of the loop bc this came out of nowhere for me lol pretty fire tho
Was just listenting to your past songs and I just realised you released this new song 55 minutes ago! Nice.
Woooo esperando el EP muy buenas canciones SUEÑO!!!! 💜
This is hipe!!! I like it, Looping......
Im so proud of how far you've come keep up the great job and such a beautiful song keep up the good work
Very nice
Because how did I literally just see Yung Gravy TWICE at summerfest and he did a collab with Dream!?! I’m d e a d
Llegue, tarde pero llegue, temazo
Es la peor porquería que he escuchado en toda mi vida, mejor ponte a hacer videos de Minecraft falso❤❤
Nice
hes playing hoes and im playing minecraft is the craziest line ive ever heard in song and i listen to afro man
Never thought of dream being a famous singer now
on repeat tbh
You're doing such an amazing job! We are so proud of all you've done, thank you for all your amazing content. Stay happy and healthy ❤
Te adoro con toda mi alma Dream, has avanzado tanto sigue así 💚💚  I love you so damn much I’m really proud of you and this song is fire, funnily enough I heard it first here than in Spotify, love you my man keep up the good job 💚💚💚
i love you and i know you will go far in your passion
Amougus
w
I can't believe that George and Sapnap are singing this song too!Always love Dream,so proud of him💚🧡💙
I love this song ❤
Nar this song actually slaps tho this is gonna go on my summer playlist ASAP and it will be played in the car on family road trips
I actually love this song and uieud. Both are so amazing<3  Definitely my two fav songs from dream
Its better than i thought it was gonna be! Which is always the case with dream songs/pos         (I mean that in a way thats like "yea its gonna be good" but then its better than that)
And Dream continuing the trend of unnecessary rap verses. Dream actually sounds good but man.
I would have never expect this collab ever! I absolutely love the outcome it's amazing I'm going to be listening to this on repeat until I learn every single lyric and continue even after because it's different and I love it!! 🥰 I'm so proud of you Dream and how far you've come!!!
Another banger❤❤
TE AMO DREAM, ESTA CANCIÓN ES HERMOSA, ESTOY ORGULLOSA DE TI Y DE TDO LO Q HAZ LOGRADO, AMO TU CANCIÓN, ES UNA HERMOSURA 😭😭💘💘💘💘💓

ESTA INCREIBLE, se me pegó y es la primera vez q la escucho. ❤
Who would’ve thought ever that dream and young gravy would have a song I mean I didn’t see dream and Alec Benjamin either lol or even just dream writing songs bruh☠️ this is all crazy (I fully expect people to respond with “crazy? I was crazy once”) and I will be disappointed if you don’t
