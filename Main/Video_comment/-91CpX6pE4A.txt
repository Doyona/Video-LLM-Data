Just corrupted as heck. Dancing in hope to immediately go back to normal as soon as we step out of the pandemic.
I have never witnessed my country 🇬🇧 being ran by such clowns it's a joke we're a laughing stock this video sums up Britain, Boris Johnson should never have been in charge of our country, talk about failing he literally became pm to completely humiliate us as a nation complete 🔔 end.
They won’t be laughing and dancing when the election results roll in. This arrogant behaviour will cost hundreds of thousands of votes. It certainly lost mine.
No one in that jumper deserves to pull
Typical Tories-rules made to be broken
Disgusting
This is to the JUDGES if you don't like what the government is doing with the ASYLUM SEEKER  YOU THE JUDGES HOUSE THEM IN YOUR  HOUSE, TO THE GOVERNMENT GET US OUT OF THE ECHR THEN YOU CAN SEND THE BASTARD ASYLUM SEEKERS WSRE WE WANT THEM TO GO, SCREW THE JUDGES YOU JUDGES SHOULD LISTEN TO WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANT, YOU HOUSE THEM UP IN YOUR BIG HOUSE WE PAY YOU TO WORK FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE TRY NOT TO INTERFERING WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO AND THIS IS WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANT THE ASYLUM SEEKER  OUT FROM OUR COUNTRY ASAP.

Lmao
I work in the service industry in the outside section of a garden centre and had COVID twice in the past 3 years (2nd time when working) despite following much of the basic common sense rules. Granted I had it mild both times but it’s worse than any colds I’ve had and to think those Government people were laughing for actively breaking common sense rules sickens me.   I was grateful my 2nd COVID experience wasn’t as bad but I wished as soon as I woke up I decided not to go to work (the lifestyle garden centre sent us emails saying it was up to us to decide if we felt safe turning up with it) as I half suspected when I woke up that day I had it as like with my first time it made me feel shit upon waking up after poor sleep. My boss even said he noticed how much better I looked by the end of the week whilst still having it but I was glad I hadn’t unintentionally passed it on to any of my colleagues
Love it ❤ yes 😂
THE LABOUR PARTY IS VERY VERY WORRIED, BEACAUSE THAY KNOW IF NIGEL FARRAGE BECAME THE TORY PARTY LEADER, THAT WILL BE THE END TO THE LABOUR PARTY GET NIGEL FARRAGE AS THE LEADER OF THE TORY PARTY THEN MYSELF AND MY SIX FAMILY MEMBERS WILL VOTE FOR THE TORY PARTY ONLY IF NIGEL WAS LEADER OF THE TORY PARTY, RISHI SUNAK AND JEREMY HUNT ARE THE TWO MOST USLES, THIS  IS THE ONLY WAY THE TORY PARTY CAN WIN.
The only way the TORY PARTY CAN WIN THE NEXT ELECTION WILL BE IF NIGEL FARRAGE WAS MADE THE PM  NOT OTHERWISE THE TORY PARTY WILL BE OUT.
TORY PARTY, you can still win the GE if kick RISHI SUNAK AND JEREMY HUNT. OUT.
I think I'm more horrified by the terrible dancing of that couple.
Fines. Bitches!
Tory=Thief and Traitor and always will.
They completely despise the public, absolutely detest us but the public vote them in. British IQ must be very very low 😂
The absolute contempt that is shown for the general public is unreal.
A few of the names of these entitled, arrogant reptiles would not go amiss. Why should these little tory SPADs escape attention, criticism, unemployment? Who are they? Particularly the wannabe Gordon Gecko in the braces. 😡
Off there heads
Oops
my uncle died of covid, my auntie and niece weren't even allowed to be in the room with him, he died alone. meanwhile these toffs were throwing maskless parties, ignoring the rules they set and acting like nothing was wrong. i HATE the conservative party.
Look at those Tory tossers.
What happening about this? The Met have gone very quiet on something that should have been easy.
i want to know why every single one of these people featured in the video have not been arrested and charged .... nothing , not a single one of them has been held account for what they were doing ,and no doubt still in their cushy well paid jobs, makes me sick to the pit of my stomach
Cretins
Are they alive? And why hold out on this for any amount of time?
he first thing to do to get the economy back on track is to charge wealthy people for using the nhs tax the shareholders that have there finger in most company pies bring back nationlisation so the private sector cant ripp of working class people any more. kick out the house of lords who scrounge of the tax payer to sit and snore in parliment do i need to say any more.
What a shit party ….. ain’t no party like a Tory party   They don’t show the bit where they all masturbate thinking of all the worthless plebs not seeing their dying relatives
Its getting tedious now. A £100.000+ investigation now by Police who have better things to do, will result in a dozen  £200 finest. What a result.
Hypocrisy at its best.
You’re telling me people had to watch their loved ones die through a window and attend their funerals over FaceTime in the name of the lamest office party of all time??
All of these pricks are disgusting.   Not the fact they partied by lied to the country and made rules for all of us and had people dying alone in care homes and hospitals without their families.   Absolute fucking pigs end of.
What a bunch of dorks 😂
Your Tory lot are little slugs
Bunch of cunts
Haha, i imagine you must feel like an idiot if you obeyed these people for 2 years while they where just partying and knew the rules where bs.
Look at them 😂 cunts for sure world’s pathetic and during this they where dancing around like clowns well hope they drop dead themselves 🖕🏼
getting rid of the psychopaths is key... we are able to identify them very easy nowadays
Anyone know who the woman in the red dress is? She’s 🔥 - love me a thicc tory toff
I’m from the US and our leadership was just as bad.  Governor of California, Gavin Newsom was caught having a birthday party for a lobbyist friend at the French Laundry, Former Speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi had a hair salon open for her during lockdowns.  Former CNN reporter Chris Cuomo was caught riding his bike in public when he had covid, but on air he told the public he was on the brink of death at night..  All while his brother, Andrew Cuomo, former governor of New York, was acting like a bug bully.  Andrew Cuomo caused countless number of deaths by putting covid patients in nursing homes!  All these politicians (no matter the party) who forced unreasonable measures on us while failing to abide by them themselves, must be prosecuted.  If these people get away with this measure of hypocrisy, their abuse of power will be worse next time the opportunity arises!
Vile cunts
Disgusting creatures
Looks like the undatables club
That takes the biscuit!
The irony of this video is the poster of the 2 metre distancing.
The fickle nature of this country is on full display as the plebians revolt against their superiors
Put all these Privileged Tory Parasites in stocks in the middle of Trafalgar square & let the public who lost loved one's during the pandemic deal with them as they see fit !
Seriously serious.
Not Partygate, PPE CONTRACTS party Where's our UK money???
They're Taking The MICK !!!
Proper cringe can't believe these idiots run our country and that goes for all mps and parties would love our military to take over🇬🇧
Despicable people. They could have taken Covid home to their families. 😡
The Joke is on the Public! They Don't Care about Us! We are a Laughing Stock! 😂
Tory scum no more need said
Did he give her one?
Doesn’t matter if you think COVID was real or not. This was a rule and everyone should stick by it.  This is sickening
Why has this video suddenly been leaked ? how many more are there we are yet to see I’m sure this is just the tip of the iceberg, Sunak is staying out of the way and no doubt in hiding the coward that he is, bet he’s crapping himself, Johnson isn’t going to leave quietly, he will leave a trail of destruction as he has always done
This is exactly what I'd imagine a Tory party would look like.
Remember one thing: this proves that they never believed their own Covid policies.  Every job lost, every billion pounds wasted, every vaccine injury, was based on a lie.
Oh please, like theyre the only ones. I broke the "rules" every damn day and know a hell of a lot of others who did but yes their hypocrisy stinks thats all theyre  guilty of
Thay should all be fierd
U nas w ubekistanie zbridniarze krzywomordego to damo robiły .
What a bunch of immature idiots, sack them all.
Just think while people were dying and their families couldn't even be with them,,while we were all clapping for our NHS every Thursday night,,while families were separated from seeing each other,,this so called government the very people who should lead by example were not only breaking the rules they were mocking them and us at every single party they attended,,,if this lot don't get voted out next election then god only knows why.... shame on all of them,,,,oh another thing my mum missed seeing her young grandkids for several months I bet that lot still seen their families
Utter disgusting why didnt this video come out sooner during the  party gate scandal bloody tories they told us the public not to see loved ones stay home and follow the rules while they had party's didnt care it was a slab in face it felt like families wore loosing loved ones to covid and couldn't say goodbye disgusting we need a general election now
Some of us lost loved ones and we couldn't day goodbye, some of us had divorce because of  hardship lockdown did and affect on mental health. Some of us lost our jobs, health and livelihood, part of our soul, and they did this whilst scarying us with fines and punishment for breaking the rules.......please lock them up, strip them off from their privileges. Anyone who was fined during lockdown for breaching the rules should be reimbursed after a catalogue of hypocrisy by the people who layed the rules
Thats gotta be the crigniest dance ever
Typical crusty plebs. Need a good smacking off mummy.
This entire situation is beyond stupid.   Stop acting like this is the crime of the century.  Who gives a rat's ass?
Slapper in the red and a greedy well fed belly thinks she's stunning. 😂
They should all go to prison for misconduct in public office
Zero self awareness 😂
Jail the fkn lot , Tory bastards
Come on folks too many just blindly complied, truly shocking to witness that level of obedience to absolute drivel. Really !!!!!!???????
To think that our countries security and financial health is dependent on people like this is really scary. Pillocks!
Sack them all!
I see two crimes, just from this clip:  1. The dancing 2. That sweater.
Sorry but if you actually listened / believed anything the government were telling you during Covid, you should be mad at yourself and nobody else   Worst thing is, people actually chose to lock themselves up and not see their family because their government told them to.  Hopefully that'll be the last time they listen
Disgusting
Fck me, absolute nerdy cretins. Fck the lot of em. Tory's are just horrible, truly the nasty party
Contempt for voters
Politics seems to attract the most vilest of people
The  GOVERNMENT  IS  A  FOOL   SACK  THE  LOT
WHAT  FOOLS  THESE  R
Privileged white people
Good on them, rules were pointless, glad I ignored them as well.
The dancing is so weird it looks AI generated.
Why did they film it. Keep quiet and leave no clue if you don't want anyone to know. Not very bright are they
Nice beginning for the Bring Back Boris party....or should I say: parties...
Disgusting,  they danced while people died alone in hospitals. May they too die alone Ameen
Good to see The Mirror telling lies again. I’ve read reports this was at number 10 when it was at Tory HQ. Two different things. This was instigated by civil servants
Yawn.......
There beyond disgusting while people lost lives and died alone the torries showing people what a disgrace they are
Hopefully next year these entitled upper class m*rons will be out of power. Vote the tories OUT!
Whatvare the names of these people?
Self-Entitled Narcissistic C**ts
This looks more the office than writers of the office could ever imagine. On TV they'd get cancelled if they wrote a script where a retard dances with a girl whose head is almost as much too big for her face as her body is too big for her dress. You could write a whole show about those 2 characters fumbling through life.
I bet they are all at work this morning laughing at us
Every one of them should get fined. If this doesn't lose them the next election nothing will!
Wankers.
Stop crying Boris took in 3 million Chinese from a virus country in lockdown thousands of illegals & you cry over a party, you English destroyed a small Island in 60 years with mass immigration & illegals you love terrorism mass white child rapes gun kinfe drug crimes Eastern European criminals are flooding in 70% of street robberies are by blacks & you promote them daily the English are vanishing from football TV Streets & politics
who are these twats i dont give a fuck about them having a piss up but look at the state of them and there running the country god help us
Hangings when?
The conspiracy theorists were right
These are the kind I tried to talk to at a demo outside their conference in Manchester when Cameron was PM. Took a civilized attitude , brought up social care crisis, bedroom tax etc. I talked with a minister he was respectful although we didn't agree, that lot when we talked with them were looking down their noses and didn't have anything coherent to say. One lad said , caring for his disabled mum and at college, your lot are going tax us for an extra bedroom in a small house. They said, why don't you get a job, and an another house? I was livid inside. But I didn't let them get to me. Nil compassion.  I'm glad I missed that party, in more ways than one. Rubbish dancing by the way.
Seems fake and all so coincidental!   Ie; we’re controlling you (that feeling)!?
Great while we were all struggling in isolation these guys were laughing it up. Disgusting
Disgusting excuses for human beings they should be fined and locked up. They were laughing at us
What's worse than a Tory? A young Tory. Bunch of brown-nosing little sycophants.
Arseholes the lot of them
Oooopps.... unlucky..... what a bunch of pricks
Its not the party is the problem but the discrimination. Just imagine these people making decisions about you , your money and your countries life.
THE VIRUS WAS INNOCULATED INTO SPECIFIC AREAS OF SOCIETY AND THESE PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE A REAL CURE. NO, OF COURSE NOT... YOU MUST BE A COMMIE CONSPIRACIST...
The rich getting richer lockdown and the poorer getting less and that's a pity the seven sins of greed Conservative failures.
Discusting bryond beleif
Covid was a big scam
Sack the lot of them..., period...!  They knew, what we are all now starting to know.. We have all been taken for mugs here..
Sickening🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮
Anyone with any sense knew that the lockdowns, mask wearing, social distancing  etc were just silly, so silly.  Look at those stupid rules just plucked out of the air. You only needed to look at History, The barrington declaration etc to know that it all wrong.  Oh but all of those in the public sector workers  just loved it being on full pay for not working. Remember Labour just wanted us to lockdown sooner, longer, harder look at the rules that Scotland and Wales had to follow. ALL OF YOU MOANING NOW. YOU LET THIS HAPPEN. YOU ALLOWED YOURSELF TO BE LOCKED AT HOME. YOU PUT ON A FACE NAPPY.        Funny how you all came out to march for blm why not lockdowns? This is on you letting it happen.
I lost my mother to COVID. A very real thing and what was done was and is very wrong but, this witch hunt has gone on long enough. He's gone but people can't move on with grief, If every time you look at the news or read a paper, there's Boris Johnson. Enough is enough now. I don't remember the media going after Tony Blair after he sent us to war looking for something that didn't exist, to just to jump into bed with Bush. Because, of these two there will never be peace in the World and now our children and children's children will have to watch their backs forever and because, of their actions millions have died and will keep on dying. People have a right to go and watch a concert and actually get home after it but like I've said, we'll all have to watch our backs forever, that's the Blair legacy. Get another story this is boring now.
lmao class. legends
How to say, I told you so, without having a smug look on my face 😏
The police are ‘investigating’. Literally not one person in the U.K. believes that any politician will face justice
Disgusting they have no morals at all
They are laughing at YOU!
I can't believe the Tories have done this.... .... ....... .................. .......................... LOL
You tube won't let me post my comments up on this. Due to my rage n wording on these monsters.
One rule for us totally another for them.
Who actually cares about this? It’s been 3 years you’d think people would focus on things that actually matter.
Until citizens literally stand up and hold all these tyrants who did this stuff to us accountable, nothing will ever happen. They just laugh and think their untouchable. We have to go after them personally, courts will never convict them. We must do it ourselves
they should be robbed of their honours, positions and fined the maximum amount
Ya ya such fun, 🤡🤡
Meanwhile, we were all caged like fucking animals.
Enough is enough get the consert party out and get them out of being the 2nd party
These people are disgusting. They don't give one shit about anybody or anything but themselves...and yet they run the fucking country!
How low must you get to be employed by the Tories? Rock bottom no doubt! These degenerates deserved to be imprisoned and the scum Johnson included! How disgusting can you get?
They have to be stripped of the honours otherwise it's just a mockery which it probably is anyway
Why is everyone acting surprised? They're bloody tories! They've never been any different.
My mum needed hospital help and we couldn’t.. I hope to see you in my area .. as they say the hills have G*^^ .. absolute bastards hope you rot
Man said House of Lords 😅 listen 2023 house of pensioners don’t get it twisted bruv. They be at bingo tonight hoping to spend the night with 88
Labour or cons.  Look at them they look like spastics call that a party call that dancing and they run the country look like a bunch of monkeys weak fat posh twats      you changed your rulers for this weak retarded runts to rule you and you wonder why shits fooked up carry on voting because your just the same weak humans
His Should have his OBE striped from him and the rest fined and sacked
I dnt see the problem..... If they wanna party let em party? They work hard enough, cut them some slack, newspapers just want something to write about.
Hope fancy jumper doesnt have a wife. Definitely banged red dress toff
I am most grateful. Shout, shout, let it all out. Expose all the f...ery they've been taking about.
All I want to know is who is the guy in the turban
We should tear the whole stinking corrupt system down
This country has been ran by idiots Boris should be in prison with all his Mates its a disgrase how much more the British People have ti take
Seems staged to me..
Ha, ha, ha. Aren't we having such fun wilst the plebs are being arrested for sitting on a public bench or having a walk in the lake district.  One for rule us, wilst the tories  do as they like. General election now.
Who the f**k wears braces?????
and our Queen had to sit alone at her beloved Philips funeral. utter disgrace
We all went without whilst they wined and dined on wine and cheese !
Are they on drugs or something?
Filthy tories I think this lot have broken the UK 🇬🇧 absolutely broken it
This is what happens when you vote for the tories yet so many people are still dumb enough to do it
They should all be sacked and charged! Starting with Ben Mallet, the helmet in the Xmas jumper, and the fat bird in red. Shameful awful people!
They are all nonces and paedophiles
Shocking, what hypocrisy! They should all be fired!
Have they all still got their jobs...One is left to enquire!? We know one Who hasn’t!? And I do not see him there?
Unbelievable, shame on them
Was we supposed to take it seriously. I know a few hundred year olds died but i just got some lemsips and cough mixture
However disgusted you might feel, can we not just move on otherwise all the bleating will go on forever and it won’t change anything.  There will be thousands of people all over the country that met with friends and relatives when they shouldn’t have done, is Scotland Yard going to chase them down too?  There are significantly more important things to be concerned with such as:  rising inflation and interest rates, energy costs, lengthening NHS waiting lists, strikes across all public services, poor housing conditions, poor community services etc, etc, etc.   For the sake of the country just get a grip and sort the things that matter.
Fucking sickening toffie nosed tw@!s Seriously these people actually hate the general public. They have a sense if entitlement above anything
Nice to see they were having a nice time, whilst I was unable to be with my wife in hospital giving birth to our still born child 38 weeks into pregnancy.
And there will still be people that defend the government for lockdown rules.
What a terrible dance? Tories suck at dancing too...
Scripted synthetic distraction garbage!  Who cares?  How does this even make news?
Makes me so mad .
Everybody in the comment section has a relative that died during covid-19 and couldn't attend their funeral. LMAO
They all look like little weasels 😂
Problem is our focus is on the 'party' Not the the fact the ruling elite (and there servents in the video) treat us like something they stood in. We need a change, a big change. Ideally before they start WW3 (again, they will live it up while we starve and our sons are sent to die)
All those that think it’s funny and what  great fun you had while some folk died without there loved ones present I do hope you all have  a slow and painful passing when you leave this mortal coil😂
What a bunch of slimey rats, my son had to endure long periods of isolation while he battled bone cancer while my wife and i were trapped in hell trying to get him through it on the phone,i think we are well passed the need for these self serving scum.
They tried to put fear into everyone as did our own SNP dictators and in most cases it worked I visited my 91 year old mum every day during lockdown she has dementia and not seeing us would have destroyed her we do all her shopping and meds etc as she is completely housebound and no one was telling us otherwise can't believe just how gullible folks were over this 😢
We need to start doing what the french are doing
Is this the first time these people have drank alcohol???   Matey sees he's being filmed and automatically turns into a salsa instructor, then face plants the table... Whilst two goofballs in the front are giggling like it's the first night Mum has let them stay out after 6pm!!!
What's more disgusting  ,,the moves
Man should go prison just for that jumper.
Look at these clowns. Utter fools. Hope they are heavily fined for this deplorable behaviour during covid. Sickening
So whilst people died alone, whilst nurses risked their lives, whilst doctors did what they could to give people a dignified ending, whilst midwives delivered babies over zoom, whilst hospitality workers lost their jobs, whilst pub landlords and restauranteurs lost their businesses, whilst communities lost contact, whilst families were torn apart, whilst women suffered the highest rise in domestic abuse, whilst loved ones waited in silence as their life partners died miles away all alone, these oxygen thieving scumbags partied and joked about it all.. The Conservative Party should never be forgiven for this despicable behaviour. Boris should face criminal prosecution just like the normal everyday people who ‘broke’ lockdown rules. He should never be allowed to see the light of day, lock him and his cronies up and throw away the key..
As if you could be so stupid as to keep video evidence! 🤦🏼‍♀️👏
They lied to us during COVID, and yet we believe all their lies  which will lead us to nuclear war with Russia. The country is f.. up just name it crime, living expenses, inflation, corrupted politicians, NHS finished and etc.
Hypocrisy at it's highest level, this members of Parliament are hot mess. We had in the past the expense scandal now the Boris partygate fiasco.
Disgusting yobs the lot of them. This is the culmination of the Neo liberal experiment into the cult of the self!
Surely this is evidence that rules were broken...so what now???
If it’s bending the rules that people had died over they could’ve atleast made the party good. ffs I’m done
Who was dumb enough to video it?
Put a list of all the names of the people. Name and shame and fire the lot!
The real crime is that dancing
Fuking twats
I think this country is approaching boiling point where people will have had enough of all these useless idiots that are supposed to run our country and reward themselves with tax payers money and waste the rest.
And this actually comes as a surprise to people? People actually thought that these charlatans were honouring the lockdown?
Next general elections. 28 January 2025. Vote this vermin out. I hope they never find employment again.
They all act like privaleged uni students. Scum bag
Must I add I wouldn't attend a party at that time lol must be mad, crowd of people in a room I wouldn't want to put myself at risk
Tories out now and never allowed back in. They are the party that are completely disconnected from public feeling or sentiment and dont care about ordinary people. Scandal after Scandal and country has gone backwards. Dont believe any more of their lies. Get out now
So why is that those that attended the party aren't in the same trouble as Boris
This sickens me to the core.   I worked in social care in older peoples services. Older people were living alone and couldn’t see their families. A lot of them became very lonely and some gave up the will to live.    These awful people in this video and this government are bags of shite. 💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩  They are not serving the people. They are sticking their fingers up at us all.
Worst party ever, no hookers at all
People will know who they are and act accordingly.  They wont be able to hide.
They look exactly how I expected and acted the way I thought
You have one life.. Your own father in a bed slowing being killed by something you can even beat but stick by him till the last moment. You don't even get to attend for the very last time you'll get before he will be gone forever to bare witness you. And these wank stains are partying having the time of their pathetic lives while something from yours was taken out and you didn't even get the very thing everyone should be able to do at the very least. Disgusting that people even voted for the dog looking ballsack if it wasn't enough that tory's are bad enough we let one win anyways.
DISGRACE, SCUM, FILTH!
And I was not allowed to attend my Nans funeral
Those are the bunch of people virtually govern this country. Make Britain great again!😂
nightmare blunt rotation
They new it was a mild illness for anyone under the average age and so many people fell for it and went out and got there experiment injection. Well done to all the millions who didn't bow down to tyranny and take the poison
None of them are good at this point we may as well become the 51st, 52nd, 53rd and 54th states of America
WHY SO SHORT AND ALMOST UNSEEABLE. That was better
Disgusting and taking the piss of those who couldn't even hold the hands of their dying family members...and we certainly don't want another pakistani for mayor
Sickening
youre a idiot when you film your illegal party
People know there faces now the gang of rats in the future I will do the opposite to what these scum authorities tell me twats
The only thing missing was Rita Ora and her guests
And someone recorded it on a phone, stupid cunts. its like telling a journalists a secret and asking them not to share it, but its who killed Kennedy. Film me whilst i murder someone but please dont post on socials. Seriously cunts
Doesn't surprise me horrible bastards out of touch with the real world and labour and any party would be the same scumbags
Oh good, looks like they knew it was bullsit
We told you so. Are we still Covidiots? These guys don't look too scared to hug do they?
A proportionate response is expected, as soon as possible!
Scum. Their lives will now be ruined as they did ours.
I'm lost for words. They will never be able to lock us down ever again.
You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.
Har har hardy har har. Some animals are more equal than others
Oh my!...partying whilst a 'killer plandemic' was killing millions world wide.🤡💩 Proves how seriously they weren't taking it! Talk about "do as we say, not as we do"! I'm just glad i didn't let them poison me and mine.😤...and I can guarantee you all the MP's were carrying on as normal, whilst they ran the country into the ground.🤬 Anthrax sandwiches all around next Christmas party.😂
Fuckwits.
Spoof 19
I bet the women in red got humped all over
One rule for us, no rules for them! 🤬
😔💔😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😷😔💔mum⚰️💔😥😥
yeah possibly time now for people to wake up and push back against everything that is being used against us. Governments do not have the people's best interest and instead are rather we roll over to their every command. We need to unite and push back on everything they are allowing to this country. If we don't finally start realising this collectively then unfortunately that means we only have ourselves to blame. And don't think Labour are any better which is likely why even that they put this out. We need change and I don't mean by way of filthy immigration
Where is David Brent?
Dirty scumbags
What will they do apologise on television 📺 then go to there next party 🥳 spending and living like kings 🤴 😉
Out with this rabble!
And a spokesperson for the bailey campaign said this is an old story we have apologised the matter is closed..even now after this video they show contempt and arrogance toward the british public
We are taking orders from these inbreds!!……..you know when you see 2 lions attacking 20 buffalo and you think, those buffalo must be really stupid!! Thats us!!
This is disgusting, but it’s okay when two people walk on top of the mountain to give them and fines and they party indoors this country is gone weak people shouldn’t tolerate this
Cretins
So how has the police investigated these law breaking conservatives and came to the conclusion no one broke the law or may be they are in the pockets of these law breaking people.
We are all little sheaps, we believe every single word of them we been so long time indoor for no reason we haven’t seen our lovers ones for long time and they was partying every day
And to be clear, these guys will have checked it was OK to have a party…someone gave them the go ahead
I think every family who lost a loved one to Covid without being able to be visited should be compensated
Me and many others couldn’t attend our loved ones funerals & these guys are laughing about bending the rules 🙁 they’re need to be held accountable!!
Lol and people still believe that it wasn’t a load of crap lol 😆
what a deplorable bunch of w@nkst@ins indeed. F*ck!ng disgusting party.
That's terrible. They should be put in jail
What insolence is this.... I think these people are really without conscience...... dancing and partying while people couldn't even see their parents..... What a disgrace.....I really wonder don't they deserve any accountability for what they've done ???!!!!!!......
Bant
As per usual the cunts in government get to break the rules! Absolutely bullshit, the government and the fucking police are a bunch of two faced cunts
Civil disobedience would be the best remedy. But common folks don't have balls.
It’s time you all woke up why are you surprised half of you probably voted for the bastard you do not live in a true democracy you live in a corrupt state of self serving money and power obsessed’individuals’ wake up grow up and start critical thinking.
I hope (but doubt) they are all out of jobs.  Disgusting and disgraceful
To be fair, this disturbs me far less than the fact that the Tories are systematically ruining the UK while giggling all the way to the bank.
they should be ashamed
Like no one else broke the rules ffs grow up
Can't dance can't run the country Johnny Vegas gatecrash the party rock and rolling
What's the big deal. It happened and will happen again. No rules for the ruling class or influentials
I will never vote again. These clowns have cost me my vote.
The dancing is just as shameful
😠🤬
Just wait till Russell Howard gets his hands in this, he rip them all to shreads like he always does👍
F**k the tories!!! Justice for the 97 🔥
Do the girl in the red dress and the chap in the clown pullover still have jobs??????????
It took so long for this clip to surface and why?  How many more will become available to the public from whatever source?  This will trigger people watching it and can one appreciate why!  Extraordinary and should this clip be surprising by now?
are those dancing morons tories ?  they way they dress and move, they are more like limp dumbs
Well they can kiss their changes of getting back into power good bye.
That jumper though 🤣
A disgrace they should all be put in prison
Every single person there should be sacked
The fat chick can’t dance
Are those weirdos running our country....They look fucked
The fact that no one questions wether this was filmed by paid to shut up actors is scary.
Disgusting
Who remembers the mother and daughter fined for briefly meeting in a park and slated.... To them and everyone else you need to reclaim your money and get your records cleaned. The Government is not fit to govern resign!
All looks so staged this , like it was meant to be released to the general public as a test to see if they kick off. Terrible acting
What dumbarse thought it would be a good idea to record it all. That just shows what morons we have running the country. And the morons who voted them in 😅
Absolute fuckwitts
DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍻
All wankers
Not just conservatives   All parties are guilty
Meanwhile the real criminals like Michelle Mone live off the millions and millions they conned from the tax payers with their dodgy PPE contracts…..
Trust a politician?  Never. Vote again?  Never.
Who atcully gives a shit 👊😂❤
Are these civil servants?
If people still vote Tory after this then god help us..  these bastards were laughing at us all while we followed the rules set by these c*nts!
This is why I never got the shot
Yeah well the people let them get away with it as usual stupid little sheep
😔
Laws are like cobwebs : catch the tiny things while the big things break straight through
British government in a nutshell, completely corrupt, and yet we will most likely still vote them back into power at the next election. Time to pack up and leave this broken country I think!
Wow!.So my poor dad died alone in hospital and we had a tiny funeral for him while the people telling us we couldn't see him were clearly having a great.time totally ignoring the rules.
Con Vid 19
Look in the dictionary under Tory. It says wanker or shows a shit stain.
A good 80% of the population broke the rules, quite whining about it.
What do you expect from a bunch of self entitled law breaking marauders???
All the parties and politions are despicable, lying pawns. None of them care, they only care about their masters and coin.  Same with the media and coorporations, all in the same circle.
This is enough now lock them up for 10 yes each. People died and died alone because of these scum
The sad thing about this is all those in the video will just simply walk away without any charges.
Torries are all SCUMBAGS!🤮
Id need alot of drugs to find anyone at that party either romotely interesting or attractive
Everyone on here a bunch of hypocrites.  What about the raves that went on... you bunch of tards.  Get a life.
It's simple. They knew there was nothing to be scared of. We've all been had.
and to make it worse there is a F*****g Sikh  in the fore ground , I thought this lot upheld virtues
I'm more annoyed that they all knew the rules were bs but still implemented them, never forget that.
Time to abolish the government. They are not needed. Start a fresh with ordinary working class people
What a cunch of bunts!!
False flag.
The police should be investigated for not giving fines to these Tory staff. The corrupt government and the corrupt police?
They should all be fined or imprisoned.  But that won’t happen!  Welcome to England, one of the most corrupt countries in the world!!
Wankers
absolute cunts
So whoever took this video has somehow allowed it to fall into the public domain. . . .so now we have disgusting behaviour, an untrustworthy friend, and I have to say the jumper is questionable too.
I think most voters by now are suffering from Long Conservatism .
I couldn’t see two of my grown children over Christmas because I followed the rules
Boris need resign disgraceful
This is why people look at the UK as a Joke
He wasn't dancing with her, he was bullying her
That dancing is criminal.
Each and every one of them should have been booted out they knew exactly 💯 what they were doing, so its one rule for us, and this bunch spineless clowns do as they want open your eyes people
wow people never got to say goodbye and these people just did what they wanted
They should all be arrested, charged and prosecuted now no excuse.
Why ain’t they being punished like bojo they should all be sacked and fined a hectic fines
Tbh I don't give a fuck because I did the same thing because I knew the whole thing was a load of over exaggerated shite 😂
F**k the elite!!!
No great surprise all the main parties treat the electorate with contempt. For goodness sake stop voting for these clowns at every election will you never learn VOTE REFORM PARTY for a complete change see what they can do.
Labour will still need a miracle. No Max Clifford to help them into power.
While people layed dying and family members couldn't say there goodbyes and these people were doing this. They don't care about you or your family. Time to get rid of all MP's and take our country back
Don’t know why everyone is so surprised tbh, what else do you expect from tories
Tories for you
😂😊
Exactly!🤬🤬This shower should hang their heads in shame, folk dying in hospital and their families couldn’t visit, but the government party on regardless, look at our late Queen sitting by herself at her husbands funeral, so so sad to see that on tv.  But no, the government carry on partying.  Makes me fume, one rule for them, another for the likes of us🤬🤬
Who cares
Why are we even listening to these corrupt politicians
" Do as we say,not as we do."
And there’s those that still stick up for boriss I wonder why…
O well there not the only ones 200 other people in the uk did it as well
Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  It’s high time we looked at a new modern political system because the one we have at the moment isn’t fit for purpose!
I think the reckoning will be swift
I lost my job and They was on the Party 😢 They should pay for us recompression.
If i said im not surprised it means it was to be expected oviesly what makes it much worse they got cought on camera which means they have to live with the embarrassment for what they mocked about how we supposed to follow government warnings if there is their officials breaking their  law themselves 😭
well this is a classic case of being caught with your fingers in the cookie jar heads should roll
The English are deeply ashamed of not being who they used to be
What’s worse, the rule breaking or that idiot thinking he’s a smooth operator?
But people will still vote for them in the nxt elections so what can one do they are nothing more than maggot shit i have more respect for period blood than these tossers and they are running the country
Thats only shows how deadly it was. Coroneus scam
i knew several people who took their own lives during lockdown. unable to mentally cope. The mainstream media did nothing but sell fear 24/7... so they are just as guilty for acting so disgusting. We will never forget what you did !!   F/U
You really couldn't make this up.. they all appear to think they are 'entitled' shame on you. Just spare a thought of all the love one's everyone lost during the pandemic..
The government is extremely corrupt, but the people are so passive they just let it happen.
Where is Boris 🎉
We should have someone in "power" that is totally honest, like Diane Abbott or ze Kier starmer.  Or for the epitome of honesty, how about Tony Blair and his alcoholic sidekick Alistair Campbell? Im sure a little lie has never passed their lips.
Disgraceful but entirely predictable. In entitled clique born into status. It wouldn't surprise me if the fallout from this video brings the Government down - I think the odds of a General Election by the end of 2023 have just shortened considerably.
Why haven't they been charged?
Honours and knighthoods are usually given out the criminals and paedophiles in particular by the tories and monarchy
The red-dressed Tory properly sleeps on the floor that event, what Tory dance  😂😂😂😂
Utter scumbags,all the people that died shows the tories have no respect at all!😡
Why have all these people not been sacked    !!!!!!!!!!
Clearly that is the 1st time he has danced with a female.  The state of the pair of them.  One big joke to the tories
Why they don't seem scared of COVID. Did they knew something which general public didn't know
Torys had a party, liberals did and also labour. I’m sure that 80% of the population must have broken a fair few rules themself, so therefore I find it  hypocritical.
No matter the betrayals, the toffs in England will STILL vote for them and the Loyalist, Unionist idiots in Scotland will as well as they represent the brogue wearing establishment.
Well shame on the people who actually listened to these lot and stayed away from there own flesh and blood because they said to do so.
Labour did same while on one knee
Showing there true colours
couldnt give a toss tbh stop putting this shit on the news
Not very good dancers, are they?
Soo embarrassing ! Scumbags
The only fools were those following the rules, not those breaking them.
The stress I would go through with my teenage daughter at the time to get her to stay in and to take it serious.. To tell her no she could not even have 6 friends over to celebrate her 17th birthday which was in the December...Was my sons 18th the same month.. Missed out on her prom as well and here are these cheeky f**ks partying  like kings and queens without a care in the world!! Did they take the pi*s out of us public or what.. Those poor people in nursing homes who never got to see their sons  daughters or grandchildren again and passed away alone.. To come on our tvs every single day and threaten us if we broke the rules is one big pi*s take.. And to think we listened to them 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I wouldnt be surprised if they receive threats, they should all be in prison.
Give em an inch hey !! and an OBE to boot, nice gig if you can get it, and as always it's not what you know, it's who you know ! an incestuous and tightly-knit collective of individuals, deeply entrenched and interconnected in their endeavours. people have woken up, things will change . . .
Horrible, horrible bastards. Had us all scared to even cuddle loved ones, and they were doing this. Horrible, horrible, bastards.
Despicable qnd cretinous behaviour and Johnson rewarded them.  Unspeakable.
You scumbags my Nan died because of you scumbags
Sickening!
This is sick and disgraceful.... everyone has made sacrifices but not the Government....
I'd be less annoyed if I could see a bottle of goose and a baggy . Not blossom hill and sausage rolls, that alone  deserves to be put in the stocks. Flipping useless set of wolly pops. Lots of love Neil
Hoorah Henry's at it again 🤦🏻‍♂️💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷 well done conservative toffs club 👏
No one cares
Firing squad needs to be a thing in this country
Bastards!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 United Kingdom
So what 🤔
They are self absorbed tossers.  They should be ashamed, but they won't be because they don't care.
Should all be arrested and throw away the key no wonder the country is in a mess being run by these corrupted imbeciles 🐍 🐍
What can you say , the investigaters will be friends of the tories as usual so nothing will come of it. The whole of the tory PARTY should face action including a £10,000 fine for breaking covid rules and a ban from working in parliament for life. As a tax payer i feel as though they have taken the piss , laughed in our faces and turned a blind eye to all those who lost love ones , DISGRACE
Sorry for your loss.  Utter bollocks. How dare they . Take any honours away . They are a disgrace
This government is an insult to us citizens and even though this they still graciously rip us off daily control everything we do it's about time we looked after our selfs
Bunch of posh wankers running the country
When I first saw the video, on tiktok, I thought it was fake and I laughed.
Someone cannot be honorable at all if they are doing those things
The government should pay back all the fines that the general public had to pay minus £50. All the knobheads in the video should be sacked if they haven't been yet.
You were as foolish as these clowns if you listened to the government nonsense during covid
Rishi need to b resign.hE involve in this shit
Personally, I couldn't care less. I broke all the rules. No V-jab, kept working and kept socialising. If YOU feel upset it's because YOU fell for the bull💩.
Government:" No going out to unless it's absolutely necessary and no parting"  Also Government:" Let's take the piss and host a party when people can't say goodbye to dying family members"
Toffs typical liars
good on them
they must be making loads of money, allowing them to buy loads of foods, cos they are all quite chubby lol.
My friends wife lost 3family members during Covid. I think only something like 9 people were allowed to attend. These parasites need bringing down a peg or 10 remove that OBE for a start
So proud of myself that i didnt get the vax and didnt follow any of the lockdown rules.
makes me think just maybe the mps didnt get the clot shot as they knew what was coming
One of the rule breaking parties lol absolute bunch of @@@ts get them all out 🎉 never vote Tory never trust any of these people. New societal governance structures needed that are intelligent , fair open hearted with the emphasis on wellbeing and happiness of citizens and nothing else . Good health roof over head quality food on our tables and people looking after eachother . Time for this whole charade of grubby little privileged pig swill to be flushed down the toilet of indifference 🎉
I’m getting convinced at this point that these videos are made up and nobody cares. They seem awfully specifically exact.
Disgusting, simply disgusting.  People dying due to covid, people can't see family due to covid, hospitals struggling due to civic and these lost are having a bloody party.  Why don't they spit at the dying and dead while there at it.  What a bloody joke.
Bunch of twats
i was in the hospital with COVID and have three doctors working on me to save my life. I will be recovering from this for the rest of my, I guess i am living long enough the see the people that was dancing on peoples grave during COVID.
My dad died during covid and I couldn't travel during the lockdown to see him before as I believed to try and stick to the rules. Most of all these mps just lie and think we're idiots
And 2 years ago the media couldn't post this for what reason ? How much did this film clip cost the anti British media  ?
I had to watch residents be ill with covid and die without their families around, ive even ended up with long covid while still following the rules and I can no longer work because of how damaged my body is.   Boils my piss seeing this and they should all be jailed
The absolute contempt for the public. We're literally a laughing stock to them while families where denied saying goodbye to loved ones.
well,at end of day there enjoying themselves so they are.🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳
Don't fall for this distraction.
Bojos bozos - these people work in our government!? Bunch of clowns 🤡
I will never ever vote for Tory anymore.
Whilst it's abhorrent that the rule makers were doing this, let's not pretend that everyone was following the rules. There were loads of parties broken up, and plenty of people meeting up outside the rules - including people working in care homes and NHS workers.
Prison comes to mind
I'm glad they where breaking the tyrannical lockdown rules, so was I!! Just wish we'd go after the media figures who pushed lies about the vaccine and covid and politicians who inacted tyrannical laws. but no lets be fukin petty instead
The point is they knew there was no risk. The survival rate for COVID was 99.97 %. What killed people was ventilators, loneliness and trauma and remdesivir which caused acute renal failure , which in turn caused multi organ failure and death. Oh and not forgetting Midazolam which was procured by a certain Matt H which was used as sedation of the elderly.
Undiluted scum
The tory party and the fools that vote for them disgust me.
state of that soy boy creature in the jumper
All government employees need removing and they ALL need replacing with some real people, not overpaid Eton toff-nose idiots
It must have been so Funny to them that at the same time they were partying, people were suffering and dying alone. They should all be fired.
Utter cringe.
Says it all about privilege to the few.
The entire nation who had to stay indoors should be compensated financially and very healthily too. This isn’t funny in the slightest anymore and the people of the Uk need to get what’s rightfully theirs.
The houses of parliament needs to go
my only consolation is that they all look completely unfuckable...well, tories, innit...
Wow, it's footage of the parties we already knew about, shocking.
Hahahahaha!!!!!!!!!   Unlucky you dumb sheep, I was doing the exact same!
Not bending.....
More fool everyone for listening to these clowns
This is disgusting when I was unable to attend my wonderful Aunts funeral😢.
Absolutely disgusting and pure stupidity of their actions . The consequences of their actions doesn’t show they are remorse for what’s they did . One again the tories has lied and  cheated the publics with lies, on the other hand mislead the parliament. To be honest they should all be ashamed of themselves. Apologies won’t cut this and it’s too late . Damage is done
👎
This is another example they knew something we didn't... lockdowns, social distancing were totally evil.
Sub-human scum.
Posh above the law CUNTS!!
These people are mocking the masses. Disgusting and deplorable.
Hard to find words for this 🖕🖕🖕
It's not hypocrisy, it's hierarchy.
Paid actors
Apart from anything it’s a crime against dancing. What a complete codpiece.
Every single one in this clip should be sacked have a £10,000 fine and 6 mths prison…….but this will never happen 🤬
why am i not even surprised …
so while all of us would get fined a massive price for not socially distancing and had to stay at home whilst my education was ruined in 2020, you have these scumbags who try to help run the country are having a piss up when people were dying and some couldnt say goodbye to their loved ones, schools were closed and people in hospitals were working day and night. how are they getting to celebrate when we were suffering in lockdown. all of them should get sacked, and the fact that police were trying to cover it up is disgusting, theyre not doing it for others, theyre doing it so their assess can get paid from the peoples hard earned money by taxes. police who do this are nothing more but pigs
Because it was all made for control,the pandemic was man made, they should be held accountable.
What an idiot recording that.
The precious rules were always nonsense. Especially the elbow handshakes and the masks on for the cameras but masks off behind closed doors
Well done UK for voting this lot in ....
NO SURPRISE AT ALL. WHEN ARE THEY ALL GOING TO GITMO?
00:27 says it all really.
Typically no class, even with the dancing
Tories cunts
Disgusting we need a general election now
That disgusting posh scummy laugh at 1:05
Well, they can't jive properly for sure .
Scum just wait until you get exposed for your fake scamdemic distractions we're gonna come and break into all your houses
Everyone in that party should be sacked...Now...
labour are just as bad tbh what we need is new main party's but that will never happen because everyone will just vote con or labour that's the only thing that will shake up the political class in this country
Absolute idiots
What a disgusting bunch of self-important, entitled, privileged individuals or as I prefer to refer to them as...... a waste of skin.
Try locking us down again, I dare you.
Wtf
You bastards think your above the law you mother fucking wankers
Why is this only coming out now? We could’ve all been free.
Lock them in prison for a very long time, so they can learn that mock and lie to society is a very bad idea.
Scumbags should be sacked !!!
these people obviously were doing this in secret   and boris did not know  , there is two sorts of people in this world . one is the type that will do  want they want  , when rhey want like starmer went a hundred miles to have drinkies and a curry with people he did not have close working bubble . with no mask  helping to spread covid   enjoying himself and getting everyone to lie about it . then the others  that do as there told ....unlike all those who chose to sunbath in hyde park and other parks  because it was their right , also spreading covid as they were all close to each other . then of course the ones who went to the beach   to sunbath because it was their right during covid  but nothing happened to them   , covid rules did not mean them  . hospitals closed their doors to fealitives not boris , because the doctors and nurses never went home from the start of covid and many of them died  whilst looking after your realitives  and  did not see their familes before or in death , their families did not complain  they excepted their fate because they were doing their job ,trying to stop covid from spreading , which all those selfish lot who says its their right , well in this case it was not , the doctors and nurses and staff had the right to  live through this awful time ,  more right to stop you coming into the hospitals  as they could not cope  20 hour day  or more ,   so they had rights  and im with them 100 %  ...........
Despite evidences of how terrible Tory are, some people will still vote for them 🤦🏽‍♂️
Bunch of crooks ...
How naive to think the Tories were the only ones partying.
These are the kind of people that mock the working class  and believe they're so much better.
If you invite a dog into your house don't be shocked when it shits on your carpet
Thousands broke lock down rules, parents couldn't send their kids to school its not safe but thought nothing of packing them like sardines in a tin at the beach , the million protest against lock down complete with music and djs , the raves the party's,  remember the labour mp who attended a wedding with 300 guests , what about beergate. Just pack it in because some of us know what this is really about , mischief making before the next election .
Families lost loved ones and this is what they do and deny it there taking the piss this is just plain wrong they should be ashamed of themselves
And this is something that people with inch of brain supposed to be surprised about? Than again streets are full of idiots in masks....
I cannot forget when at the start of Covid a 10 year old boy died and his mother, who would have laid her life for his, was not allowed to attend his funeral. Whilst this lot partied.  Shame on you. I pray you experience such heartbreak as you caused to this poor woman. Perhaps that will make you better humans.
Any of you idiots that followed the "rules" are just angry because you never had the balls or the brains to think for yourself and not compliant with the BS.
Such a bunch of losers….how do these idiots make it this far in life!?!?
The thing that's most shocking to me is the people that are shocked that the tory's would A do this  1:22 and B then reward the ones who tried to covered it up  wake T F up 🤦
Fucking disgusting. People couldn’t attend their loved ones funerals because of rules these people put in place yet they are happy to dance, laugh and ignore their own rules.
All these fat fxcks make me laugh i was going through chemo alone while these shxts were dancing wheres the justice
What a disgrace. They made us take them jabs aswell. families, business, mental health all declined all the whilst they were sniffing cocaine and drunk partying.
FOR ME, THERE IS A MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION THAN BREAKING THE RULE. CAN YOU FIGURE IT OUT?
My father DIED sad and lonely in hospital because we couldn't go and be with him.  Absolute pieces of site. 🤬😡🤬
Every single selfish idiot in this video should face the full force of the law alongside bojo.
Meanwhile my mum died in hospital from a stomach disorder, alone and terrified, as we weren't allowed to visit.
Servile pricks will keep voting Tory though
What a chain 😡😡😡😡
Unspeakable.
Disgusting unforgivable behaviour, they should all be sacked and never allowed to work in anything connected to politics again. For life
No one likes a tory ...bunch of toffs
Disgraceful
The queen sat on her own while this mob and they are a privileged mob get drunk and dance . Disgrace the lot of them .
The biggest crime here is the dancing.
Mainstream media reinforcing *The Narrative* © The Globalist Cabal 2020
Lock 'em up
Question id like to ask is...did the knob in the christmas jumper get his end away with the porker in the red dress😂😂😂
I can guarantee there are more of these clips ... just waiting to be unleashed on the run up to the election...
i could not go out side but they could party...welcome to the uk people.....
I am curious how this video has come to light, and also why it took over 2 years to do so.
Who cares? Covid was never a threat and anyone with a brain would have thrown a party as well. I never listened to the restrictions and if you did you are an idiot. Case closed.
This people we lost….the people we couldn’t see.
Exactly why all these bastards including Johnson and Sunak belong in a dungeon. Absolutely mental how these lot are allowed to lead Britain.
FUCK tory scum
We can all respond to this absolute piss take….. Vote Labour, the lesser of the two evils… Get everyone you know to vote Labour and put an end to this right wing tory bullshit.
Led by a clown...........
Party time! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Disgusting.
Fucking scum the lot of them
Standard Tory behaviour.
I’m a Tory and it’s these people who should be given the boot and have their honours revoked. You should come down hard on them and I’m so glad Bailey didn’t get in as he was a very poor choice and I suspect he was just ticking a box. Disgraceful.
these people look like they been planted there
Fuck these politicians all out for them selfs pieces of shit all of em
Its like a load of puppets doing that evil laugh, acting like they know its all a scam, it is, too many of us here on earth and they need some way to depopulate, alot of you are so easily minupulated into beliving anything its way more scarier then this video lol
T*ssers 🙄
If this doesn’t force a MASSIVE protest outside parliament, nothing will. This country needs to stand the fk up now, enough is enough
For me it looks staged for the cameras....the hole thing looks to be a staged setup against the conservatives but more against Boris....And to be clear i have zero faith in any political party...we deserve better
The rules were never needed, shame on those scumbags that implemented the whole scamdemic
At the beginning of the lockdown, i received literature from the government informing me to stay at home, as i was vulnerable, due to ill health. My daughter delivered my shopping and dropped it off in the hall, using a spare key. On April 2nd, my sister died (not of covid) and i couldnt attend her funeral. In the meantime, Bojo and company were partying. You can imagine how i feel !!  🤔
SCUM THIS IS WHY GREAT BRITAIN IS NOT GREAT ! SELF NONE IMPORTANT SCUM AND PIE BOY LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!
Not only did the ignore the rules they made, but they mocked them, disgusting
The lower you sink morally  , the higher you rise socially , politically and financially  .
For thirty torturous days, my father and uncle battled COVID-19 from their hospital beds. Each day, we awaited the dreaded phone call, bringing news of their worsening condition. Helpless and desperate, we clung to hope that slowly faded away.  In those early days, we shared anxious phone calls, seeking solace in each other's voices. But as the weeks passed, hope slipped away, and our worst fears became a reality. Ventilators were their final lifelines.  Thirty days of sleepless nights, whispered prayers, and endless tears. And then, suddenly, it was over. They were gone, leaving an irreplaceable void. We were denied the chance to say goodbye, to hold their hands, to find closure. The pain of that loss consumes me.  Witnessing the callousness of privileged individuals partying while we suffer, my stomach churns with disgust. It highlights the stark contrast between their indulgence and our shattered lives. Humanity feels lost, and hope dims.  Yet, amidst this darkness, I refuse to surrender. In my grief, I find resilience. I will continue to honor my loved ones by nurturing compassion.
Bloody shameful.   I will never vote for any party thats in parliament ever again.   Evil the bloody lot of them none deserve my vote and they wont get it.   The reform party for me
Anybody who stuck to the rules is a fool.
What a bunch of self entitled tossers
God they even look like Tory Boys - Harry Enfield was so accurate
🤣🤣they really don't give a monkeys do they and people wonder why I don't vote.
Doesn't this prove it was not what they said it was. Was it the great hoax? Did they lie? Were people were dying of pneumonia etc and not this covid19? Surely if it was as deadly as they said then they too would have been too frightened, like the rest of us to mingle? 😢
They all need to be put into jail
If we have  another lockdown and told we can't visit family, and loved ones then I will ignore that fact, seeing this footage, clearly shows the ignorance of the downing st staff, they don't give a rats arse about the rules, and you can hear their laughter.. like many of the govt, they all broke tge rules, yet none were prosecuted.
When are warrants for arrest going to start for Treason?  For them ignoring NUREMBERG convention laws that they imposed on the public then ?  Now theft is being committed by them, with price rises where they have shares with Gas, electricity etc.,  Why are they allowed to steal from the public?
What a fkn bunch of bastard's
Yeah like i was following lockdown rules, yall just mad your cucked and trusted the gov.
Makes me feel even better i ignored every rule. If you followed everything to the letter and you're upset by this then I'm glad because you vilified and attacked people like me. You only had yourselves to blame.
They think they are above rules we have to obey. 😂They truly do
Its just a witch hunt though..none of us are really angry that they didn't follow the rules they was giving out.
The whole thing is sickening, those needless deaths caused by the mismanagement of dealing with covid correctly, those that lost love ones and couldn’t say goodbye, imagine dying on your own? It’s sickening because those in charge got it wrong, done as they pleased whilst enforcing draconian rules they didn’t follow themselves.  Then you find out these rule breaking piss takers are getting honoured?? Beggars belief.  It’s a shame Labour are not the party they should be but my god anything is better than the tories.
Fake...this wasn't filmed then...its been put together since as they wouldn't do that silly obvious dance....psyop..
The new it was all bullshit think about it if was so deadly these fkrs certainly wouldn’t be doing this shit it is all bullshit vaccine are hurting people be ignorant all you like but it’s a fact
Who is the voluptuous lady in the red dress? 😍
Just affirms what everyone with an iota of sense knew in the beginning,an absolute scam of a”pandemic”with no real danger to anyone.
So why has Boris been penalised for these lot having a party? Do you see Boris taking part?
They should all be sacked and taking to account… Conservative  corrupt prats . Make me so angry 😡. How many people dying this time but they have a laugh 😂.
People couldn't have their families together for loved ones funerals and yet they was all laughing at us braking the rules themselves....people had to pay hefty fines just to get out the house and yet they where all laughing at us.
Stupid people with their stupid policies 100,000 people died because of misconduct
Only idiots believed in covid19 and vaccines. fucking uneducated brits .
What a joke is the western ethics😂.
Unfortunately no surprise here, absolutely disgraceful.
EVIL PEOPLE .
Absolutely f**king outrageous!
As we have already said.  Non are fit for purpose.  When will the nation react to such treason.  They laugh at you all from the beginning of their lies. Waking up yet.
I hope everyone remembers this last 3yrs well . Use your free will and free speach while we still have a voice . Vote with your feet at the next election . In fact why wait ?  voice it now and get the un elected out !!!
Interesting how they zoomed in version so that they dont show those other people caught
The establishment knew there was no new danger to anyone. But ramping up the fear pretence, was the only way for people to take the draconian measures seriously. This is what control freaks do.
i went to illegal raves during the “lockdown” period 😎
Just wanted to say a huge thank you to all the clowns who voted and supported the tories into power. You all deserved a medal of honour. Your government laughed and partied whilst we watched our loved ones die from a distance.
Dont know why we are being shown this we all know nothing it going to happen.
They should be done for treason.
verman
Dickheads
All should be fired
Loxkdowns were very wrongful,but all politicians that partied during the scandalous covid period should be sacked
Its crazy seeing all the people who are saying "I was responsible and didn't go outside for months while they were partying!" You weren't being responsible, you were being gullible. Most will never be able to admit that they've been had.
And yet, even after this, I bet there’s still people that like Boris because they can’t bring themselves to admit who they voted for is the lowest of the low.
BASTARDS..
What’s more sickening is you morons never realised you were being tricked, yet you criticised anyone not wearing masks and keeping 2m distance. It was a obvious deception all along. What makes this a complete disaster. You sheeps continue your dear support for these crooks! You are more concerned about race and immigration. Your own kind are shitting on your faces 😂
These pieces of filth... After everything they put the people through, all the rules they enforced to keep us away from our loved ones, they cannot even do the decency holding themselves to the same standards. Instead they celebrate, fraternise and laugh in the face of it all.  We all knew they were scum, that politicians should not be trusted, but to go this far... May God pray for their souls, for I'm not sure I can.
just usual public school boy c*nts
All dishonest  x
Pathetic worthless scum. Absolute pond scum.
Hellish jumper is a terrible dancer!😢
😤😡😠🤬 i had a very lonely and i was living in emergency accommodation at the time.
Every one of these b.....ds should be named, shamed and prosecuted. Scum.
pussios. x10. prolly on packet too.
Funny how footage from a private party as if by magic manages to appear on the website of a hostile newspaper. Couldn’t they have just captured their voicemails?
Looks like a really deadly pandemic…. I’m sure they were terrified
Tory toffs taking the piss out of the dumbasses that voted for them!
They are laughing whilst people were dying. Disgusting.
Tory toffee nosed liars, don’t know the meaning of real struggles or hardship. Disgusting, and like most, lost all hope in any government running country affectively
Was the camera guy trying to expose this or just really fucking stupid?
This country is an absolute joke 😂🤮 from Utterly corrupt police gang to its Utterly corrupt politicians and parliamentary standards .. ALL of them as full of bull💩 as the next 👍🤮
💩
The woman in red has a cracking set of melons 😁
Wanker’s! We all stayed in and suffered as we did what we were told! This country is a joke!
Can't believe you sheep all fell for it
Thats why I don't trust people
We are the people of this country and we vote people in,why are we putting up with this? We need to put an end to all these toffs treating us like peasants and show them what we really think.
Bunch of cunts
obviously they are having a party they just printed 700 billion and gave it out to all ther friends !!! can we investigate that and not the party you nincompoops
And who says white guys can’t dance? 😂😂
disgusting... not sure who is worse.. if them... or the people who voted for them...
How sickening to see the contemptible behaviour of our Ghastly Government
Why are ppl shocked by this? They do what they want cos there's no reprocussions besides a small fine or a short suspension. If u know u can get away with bending the rules, ur going to do it. There needs to be zero tolerance policy for politicians and government bodies.
Wankers..... make us pay for them to enjoy themselves but we couldnt stand out to even chat with neighbours..
Who's the bitch in the red dress?
I never followed the rules from the start cause I knew it was aload of bollocks and not a threat to the majority anybody who believed and still believes anything these politicians say is a complete fool they tell you anything u want to hear and lie to your face to get what they want and do what they want behind closed doors. At least I’m upfront and honest about what I think and my opinions it’s a shame more working class blunt people like me are not in positions to make good change and provide representation for a large group of people who are currently not represented in our parliamentary system instead you got these two faced liers and snobs calling the shots and deciding what’s best for you when they have nothing in common with you and your issuess.
Imagone of media had no bias, damn.... what a thing that would be🤷‍♂️ Idiots call yourselves journalists 😂
Fucking arseholes , need a new Guy Fawkes ASAP
Who would have thought that people are just people? If anything I’d say it just attests to the fact that the entire situation was ridiculous
Covid was just a test to see how many people would listen to them and use all fell for it like sheep walking around with your masks on the next step is taking cash out of society and having all digital currency which they will have full control over.
I was a so called key worker during the whole thing working security. I was spat on multiple times, verbally and physically abused and largely left on my own to deal with a public who were incredibly angry with all the measures that were introduced. A minority were fantastic, but mostly people treated us like we were not even human. I had a 1 year old daughter I could not see, she lives with her mum and despite both of us doing the best we could I know how desparately hard it was on her mother. The poor people I was tasked with protecting were treated so unbelievebly badly by members of the public too. Ladies on the shop floor would be crying every day because of the abuse, even though they and I as far as we were all aware were risking our lives coming to work to provide people with food In the best way we knew how, even though guidelines from the government and the company were contradicting and confusing for everyone. Im well over six feet tall and can handle myself pretty well, but I know I cried more than once. Those ladies have children of their own. Imagine going home to your kids after being spat at by multiple people during a viral pandemic! I was also threatned with losing my job if I did not have the jab, which I stood my ground on and flatly refused every time. I understand it was unprecedented and we were not prepared in the least but that does not excuse this kind of behaviour while loved ones, neighbours and co workers literally perished before our eyes. I guess I was lucky I had a massive bout of something really nasty about 3 months before it appeared in the news and didnt get sick again.  I dont know why people havent got to the stage where these people are forced out, I dont know why people arent absolutely livid with seeing all this, but I am, and If I met one I doubt I could contain myself. The flatulent sacks of shit have only ever been in it for their own personal gain and absolutely NOT because they want to serve communities. As great man once said, "the very fact that someone would actually WANT to be a politician, should automatically ban them FOR LIFE from ever becoming one".
Just typical Tories, arrogance beyond belief...
Wheres boris, they only showing the low level Tories why, to think these Tory scum helped spread the virus no facemasks no social distancing, while our NHS nurses were working the best they could, to save us with deep Tory cuts to our NHS, then sunak drags our nurses through court, wef Tories are vile nazi's.
It makes me cringe. I’m half expecting to see David Brent
i should have been a politician instead of wasting my money on Msc in power systems. I work as an engineer to secure clean and sustainable energy and minimising the challeges in the electricity network. I work hard for a government owned company and follow strict lockdown rules. Yet you see torri cunts pissing away the publics money whilst in lockdown.
Covid was a con get over it you followed rules living in fear no jabs no mask never even a sniffle
They were not scared as they knew there was nothing to be scared of. 90 of the uk population are mugs.
Good for them I was breaking the rules and I never felt more freedom. 😂
My aunt died over lockdown, I got to say goodbye but thanks to these restrictions I wasn’t able to go to her funeral but her prick of an ex husband got to go to it  I was really close with her growing up and then didn’t see her for years due to family drama and only got to see her once before I learned she was dying  I wish every single one of these low life scumbags who took part in these parties nothing but misfortune for the rest of their miserable life and that they wake up every morning by stepping on something sharp. Scum of the lowest calibre
Surprised Surprised
One day they will have to answer to God
You never mention the labour party and the newly promoted police officer who investigated Durham gate
I don't even feel sorry for the people that obeyed the rules and are now complaining and wishing they had done things differently now given the facts. If you had have just opened your eyes from day 1 and realised it was all one massive con you might not have been so easily swayed.
Self entitled bastards. They have no respect for anyone. People who couldn't see relatives as they died but they could party away- scum. I'm just so angry. Bet nothing happens to them as they're in positions of power.
I wasn’t allowed to be near my dad in his home for the last 7mths of his life…disgusting disgraceful
Are people really surprised? I expected it. OF COURSE our politicians weren't following the same rules they imposed on us. But, as usual, they won't be held accountable for their actions. They never are. Ask yourself: will they ever be dragged in front of a judge and tried? Nope. Oh, but the plebs were fined and jailed all over the place and even spied on by the police. So much for freedom and democracy. That went out the window when politicians saw the chance to grab absolute power. And it doesn't matter what Party is in power. They all sing from the hymn book.
Time to get rid of these parasites once and for all.....and that includes Labour, they would be no better, the system is completely corrupt, for god's sake WAKE UP!!!
Bunch of bellends!
Interestingly , who leaked this video for what purpose, and there again after such a long time. Are the Tories, looking up and spitting on themselves in the name of revenge?
This is outrageous, but there will be NO ACCOUNTABILITY, our politicians have failed us for generations they are inept corrupt, unethical immoral mercenaries .....the police the civil service are just as bad.....we need a new political system and a NEW PARTY...VOTE REFORM FOR OUR CHILDREN'S SAFETY 🇬🇧
GLAD your ALL being exposed for the shi you are.
Jokers. Sack them all.
Zip it you mugs and stop your whinging. If you took any of it at face value and obeyed ‘their rules’ more fool you. Just remember and don’t get fooled again.
Did anyone really think this wasn’t going on
This is the people who we call our leaders what a joke of a country we always have something to say about other countries but this country is done out here.
People seem very upset about this
Corrupt scum. Get this party out ASAP.
That ladies and gentleman was the reality they knew they were not in any danger whatsoever.. I’m being honest like a complete sap I did as I was told even though I was confident most of what we were being fed was scaremongering and propaganda all in the name of control.. never again will I fall for that type of shite again
Bring back the good old days of pitchforks and torches..... They think they're above the law because they probably are but they aren't above a pitchfork up the backside
Only a Tory would wear a ridiculous jumper like that! It probably cost several hundred pounds. When I first saw this I thought it was a comedy sketch. O well it just shows you how unfit for power the Tories are. Arrogant and entitled with no scruples whatsoever.
Disgusting !!.
Tory scum
Who are the two dancing? 😂
All whilst those losing loved ones had no choice but to let them die alone. Absolutely sickening. These entitled morons thinking they’re above everything. No conscience. Quite devastating to be honest! Never should these people ever be allowed in a position  of public office.
😡Sack the bloody lot of them! Vile, sneering creatures!😡😡😡
We all knew this was happening.. absolute scum these idiots!! People were in hospital dying and families couldn't even spend there last moments together!! Nothing will be done as it's totally corrupt..
Wankers sack them all and jail them
As a Hospital maintenance engineer I was during this shit show A on call 24/7 and B to be in theatre to keep an eye on surgeons panel to ensure everything was ok during Intubations.. plus ensuring the "corpse corridor" was clear and also the morgue.. and these Tw@ts wonder why we took early retirement..I observed that tbh I am not heartless but decided that I need to spend time with family and doing simple things that make me happy , champagne and Vol a vonts in a cringy party isn't it .. haves and have nots will ultimately bring consequences PS I used to work at MGN Oldham so I know full well the Mirror doesn't let the truth get in the way of a good story b4 anyone chips in .
Funny how it took three years for this to surface. We all knew it was bs. 😂
Who cares, we all broke the rules
apart from anything else, it looks like the worst party ever
Fat one in red can move
Good,  it proves the whole thing was a scam.
Discussing
I feel sorry for the idiots that  followed their ‘masters’ rules . . I saw through it from the start. 56 unvaxxed and awake. I hope people seeing this will realise you are your own ruler - no one else rules over you.
That must've been some good cocaine
This just shows the shower of shite running the country.
Disgusting...
Yet I couldn’t be with my dad for the entire 3 days he was taken from his care home to hospital with sudden stomach pains. He died alone with no visit or contact from his only daughter. He died of a twisted gut in late 2021. Nothing to do with covid. Yet after he had died and they had called me to say he had suddenly deteriorated and I was allowed to go, after leaving me sitting in a room for over an hour, after he had gone, they asked if I wanted to see him then ! Too late 😢
I feel sick!
Absolutely pathetic for bending the rules especially when we couldn't see our loved ones during those times
One rule for them, and one rule for everyone is never acceptable. Never mind all the rubbish covid deals done. Utter contempt. May  they reap, what they have sown
LOCK THEM UP!! 😡😡😡
Because they all knew it was a con 😅😅😅
Anyone who follows any future lockdown restrictions and doesn't take to the streets is a coward.
Each and everyone of them should be sacked and stripped of any honers they have been awarded.  Disgraceful behaviour,   while others could not be with loved ones while they passed away.  Or sit next to and comfort each other while they buried their loved one.    Unfortunately I've come to the conclusion that you can't trust anyone 😢😢😢
They should be all sacked!
The above the law party showing the country how trustworthy and honest they ate and how much they care about the people
But the great masses will do nothing apart from complain online. There needs to be a rebellion. Failing that. Nothing will change.
My friend couldn't go and visit her dying husband in hospital for 6 weeks cus of the restrictions, yet this scum expect our vote next year, well they can ----- off.
this actually looks like a BBC production to me, a bit fake or scripted. or maybe that's just how posh people party. Fishy scumbags!
I really feel that politicians need to have their lives further observed and scrutinised generally as a formal requirement of their job.   It's easy for them to tax us working people out of the arse during a cost of living crisis where record numbers of people are relying on food banks while they avoid taxes by owning offshore accounts and partying during a deadly pandemic whilst being the same people declaring 'strict covid restrictions'.
They all deserve to be imprisoned for 500 years alongside Trump! Sickening!
If anything like this happens again, i beg we all just ignore these IDIOTS
This "Government" is a sick joke and it has to end!
Well.. i think this proves covid was a scam .. not that it wasnt serious but that we put our whole lives on hold.. stayed indoors.. our young people kept from school from socialising.. families not allowed to attend hospitals.. i even got a dressing down in a supermarket for accidentally walking the wrong way up an aisle not realising it was one way while covid rules applied i felt ashamed even tho i knew i had done nothing wrong.. and these people were behind the scenes getting awards and laughing at every one of us.. well i hope the next time they try to scam a whole nation and push a narrative people will think twice before blindly following the government who clearly dont give a monkeys about us!!!
That one guy in the suit had the most Tory laugh I've ever witnessed in my life 😂 twats
How awful people having a drink and dancing - how dreadfully ridiculous that people are still going on about this.
Charlie looks like he made an appearance too, particularly braces.... my dad died 19th may 2020, his funeral was 1st June and we were allowed 16 people when there would have likely been way over 100, the Tories had a party 20th may and I find it unforgivable.
Disgusting
Thats the dryest party I ever did see, sorry 😆
Never followed this Covid nonsense. Remember folks the worse thing you can ever hear is “It’s your Government here how can we help you”
Absolute scum I hope everyone in this video rots from the inside out. NEVER AGAIN will i listen to the British Government
👈👈👈 Lawful, legal peaceful solution to all our problems. In accordance with our Constitution.
They all want locking up
W⚓️s what what what. 🎉
Any mention on the corrupt kangaroo court? Always knew there was something fishy about the witch hunt to oust Boris, from the msm, tory remainers etc. Our politicians are incompetent
Total scum. That bloke needs proper Salsa lessons
they are all corrupt and traitors and whole bunch of bastards!
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH...they deserve to be stripped of all titles and the whole lot should spend time in jail !!!!!
They don't seem worried about a killer Virus? Why not ?
Sack them all ,
Oh yes. You can see how Boris got confused.  This looks nothing like a party. Just another boring work meeting! 😐😖😡
String em all
Ah democracy, it's their freedom to have a party why do you peasants care, come to China if you prefer communism
The reason country s fucked sunak borris Torries
Looks like covid is wasn’t the only rules they were “bending” if you know you know ❄️
Unbelievable 😡😡😡😡
I hope you all wake up. When we were imprisoned in our homes, this is what our higher-ups were up too.
Howell !are you how or well while you ponder over these existential questions with your  very limited intellect might I address you as Sir Ignoramus
Filth
Anyone who dances that bad should be sacked on the spot
Absolute cunts. Imprison the lot of them.
People "Die Alone" while the Tories party. This proves what they "REALLY" think about us. As for the rest of the Tories, they had to know all about this. 🤥🤥🤥 Their public wages are more important, so they kept their mouth shut and continue to do so. This is what the bast**ds would say to you if you criticised them. 🖕🖕 yours. They are nothing but 💩  None of them would piss on you if you were on fire.
Insubordinate bastards
You're all there saying how low they are, how sad because others didn't see their families when really you're all deflecting, not saying it's good what they did but you won't admit that WE ALL (everyone) broke atleast one rule in lockdown as it was a rare situation none of us had ever been in, and alot of us were pretty down and maybe just needed a little break/upper,it's just being human really. I think people are just gettin too heated over things in the past that don't really matter anymore,think on the future instead  😊
I admit I voted conservative in the last election.  I know nobody here cares but I promise, that will be the last time  I do that again, ever. Even if I’m tempted by their manifestos and by some miracle I like the conservative leader. That party is dead to me.
It’s disgusting
Still think Andrew Tate is crazy?
Their guffaws are very typical and disrespectful
Old news. Couldn't give a fook about them having parties, more concerned with the rules that were falsed upon us. By both LabCon
Everybody's form of protest is to comment on these videos. Get on the streets and make it happen, people! Get them out, I'll be there you.
Glad I wasn't the only one who didn't treat covid like Ebola...
These people are running the country scums
Have you ever observed a dickhead in the wild before, here are some prime examples. Hope this can somehow be added to their resume's when looking for work in the future.
Sack them all
Scumbags what do you expect
Oh dear
"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." -Benjamin Franklin  Don't comply with nonsense rules/dictats  mandates/laws. Peacefully decline  Went to 10 lockdown protests some were against the rules/laws 😂( unreported in MSM ) My wife and i I had a great Christmas with my 75 year old parents, my sister, 5 grown up kids all didn't wear the ridiculous face nappies throught the scam - all unjabbed all coincidence free.
politicians taking the public for idiots and that news
F*ck the plebs,we're different.......Bullington forever.
Watching this makes me so mad. The fact my dad had cancer an I couldn’t see him when he needed me.
Vote Tory, get Tory.
Fool me once........
All of the main party criminal leeches need to go, tory and Labour they all p*ss in the same pot! Good money for old rope, they go about destroying our country, while the people suffer, bet none of these have missed a meal or worried about there children's future! The level of corruption stinks!!
out out out
This behaviour is a different type of evil.
can we have politicians who like weed, shrooms and peace, rather than ones who like alcohol, cocaine and rage...
In the public ranking, politicians are worse than the prostitutes😂
1:07 when I think of what a Tory is, I think of guffawing berks like Mr Red Tie over here.
I bet labour were partying just as hard
Tory rats 🐀
Who cares, the treason by all politicians is the real story not being told
I assume all the general public fined for breaking the lockdown rules will be refunded??
Theatre. Nothing will happen.
I couldn't attend my own grandmother's funeral, but I'm glad some silver spoon cunts had a good shindig 😒
Yet morons will still vote for them
Literally all of them are criminals, and yet still the idiots are going to vote them back into power come election time
After Bojos recent ousting at Uxbridge. A local man was asked what he thought  His response was... I like him. He's an idiot but a loveable idiot.. This is the mindset of a large proportion of the British voting public.
This is exactly who Tories have always been, and English people are stupid enough to keep voting for them.
Shame you sat on that story for over 2 years. You should of released it straight away. I hope harry iniahlates you sc*mbags.
Anyone found to have been involved  and who received awards needs to be, sacked, put on trial, and their award revoked.
This lot of scumbags are partying while the normal people with morals and integrity followed the rules even if it meant not holding a loved one when they were dying or at a funeral . We the masses need to rise and unite to stop these thieving ,corrupt and dishonest politicians and take the power back to people who care about each other
LETS DRAIN THE BLOB
Sack them all!
Tory voters would still vote for them lol embarrassing
Anarchy for them, socialism for corporations, capitalism for the rest of us.
VOTE THEM OUT!
Labour did the same thing but we'll keep it very quite.
I was expecting snorting cocaine off hookers tits......
All should be sacked!!!!
Those bastards make my blood run cold. Get them out, all of them
Look at these A...holes, these people get on my last nerve...  They imprison and fine, and charge us if we did the same.... but this is why you can't trust government, they always abuse power ... always! WE the public should take note and stop listening to these hypocrites when they try to tell us what to do, many have lost love ones who died alone, because we stayed behind closed doors and didn't travel ... and yet these rule makers are the biggest rule breakers.
Nasty bastards 😢
I don't know what snotty nosed middle-class voiceover that was, but if you want a working class perspective on that ...
I said goodbye to people through text, they partied.
No comments…
People and the media conveniently forgetting that Labour were caught breaking the same laws on numerous occasions? Yet ignored by the media
Who's the twat in the jumper cavorting with the fat bird?
Loved ones couldn’t be with dying relatives but Tories throw parties and laugh about it. Really shows the difference between us and them.
How disgusting to see them 😡🤬 so many family’s lost their love ones and they couldn’t say goodbye to them or go to their funeral 💔
Scum is as scum does.
How the fuck can the tories come back from all of this 😮😮😂😂😂😂
If this is true what a shower of pricks……….🖕
Excuse the language  but every one of these fuck wits should be out of there entitled positions.
This is like a scene from a crappy bbc show.  Fuck these people. Fuck them all.
Is this for real? Who the hell do these people think they are. Shame on them
Arrest the lot of them lying, cheating bast*rds. Wtf do they think they are. I’m raging 😡
the problem is ,the british have no backbone anymore and will do jack shit about this ,and they will keeping voting for these crooked sleazy con artists .when your outnumbered  by retards .nothing will change . they convinced half the country that brexit would be a walk in the park and britain would be richer . what they really meant was, they would be richer . the most corrupt government in british history ,just ask a brexit voter ,tell me how your life has become better since leaving the eu .and watch them get brain freeze .half the country where made fools of , by this government , they fell for it hook line and sinker  ,including the farmers and fisherman . even if labour would get into power ,i feel the uk is to far gone  , to much damage has been done by the tories . billions of pounds of money has been filtered to greedy tory mp,s friends . the corruption that has happened over the past decades has been shocking .
Scum of the earth tory party .
cockwombles. Sack them all and fine them millions.
Utterly shameful. This is why so many have lost faith in politicians.
Sack the lot
There is a law for the Politician's and a law for us, We had our Christmas in 2020 with just my 1 son who lives with us, No family at all & they were living it up!
Why are these people still in work, and why where they not prosecuted
Rules apply to everyone except for people in power 😒 people were even fined for opening gym etc……they need to be punished somehow
They should be out of a job because this is wrong and I'm certain many will strike if these end up in higher positions in politics as many couldn't see loved ones and others suffered from mental health being inside lack of socialising while these clowns have fun
The following members of My family died and I couldn't even attend to see there funerals because of soo many restrictions placed!!!! *Both my uncles *My Godmother  *My partners grandma and grandpa (abroad)!!  My father was hospitalised. My stepbrother after visiting his paternal mother was also hospitalised. Should I add any more sorrow you donkeys put us through!!!!! I feel like punching each and every one of those clowns 😢😢😢   I'm sorry but if we did what they did then we would all be in jail.
Disgusted
I wouldn’t trust the government and it’s no different here
Wow
Hope they all get done over, scum all of them
No two ways about them all they should all be tried in court and then all have the normal average jobs or on the doll lol
Oh so what if he did😢. Most of the country did. Don't say they didn't because we all know different
Who cares you were all brainwashed that being near each other was bad and them and a few of us knew it didn't matter the public are just generally stupid and emotional in decision also a hive mind that has a lower average iq than room temp
There should be heads rolling for this.
Brainless morons allowing filming and shows how low the whistle blower is to sell their soul to the devil to make a quick buck. Where were the senior tories to rein these twats in?! You cant tell me that media groups didnt have the odd party either, i know alot of us general public broke the rules on a few occasions. Nonsense story the media are obsessed with.
All those who were not allowed to see their loved ones before death!😢
This is a complete p'@@@ take! All those not been able to see dying loved ones etc....The vision of our late Queen having to sit alone at Prince Philip funeral & these twats laughing!!...Disrespectful!!..A hefty fine should be put in place!
There was never any need or justification for lockdown, which achieved nothing but misery - and they knew it. Meanwhile their cronies were enriched and ennobled and ordinary lives made misery. Never forget; never forgive.
Get over it why do people actually care? It was a hard time for everyone we all had little parties and that can everyone stop being such hypocrites
You bloody sheep still don't get it. The whole covid and vaccines was a test to see how easy you bend, and you bent over backwards and took it right up the arse. Why are they laughing and not wearing masks, because they know it's all bullshit. Even after all these videos are coming out you're still crying wolf and thinking they're endangering lives, the only danger is the mass brainwashing and lack of thinking for yourselves. Return to watching Coronation Street and drinking Tennants while your free will is stripped away.
previously i asked relection....when they made new PM internally and the people allowed for that also....then the clown is not the politicians its the people who allowed it
And yet the moronic British public will still vote for them come the next election.
While our loved ones were dying, here they are, in total disrespect and laughing at the fact too. About time another Guy Fawkes was resurrected!!!!!
😡😡😡😡😡😡 i am very disappointed
And you all honestly believe no one from any other party "bent the rules"? Of course they did they just didn't get outed for it because they weren't "in power" stop wearing your rose tinted glasses
So many sheep followed the rules. You've only got yourselves to blame for trusting the government and the so called science
They were and are all laughing at us. We couldn’t visit family in hospital, we couldn’t go to loved ones funerals. People stuck to the rules no matter what, and some of them never lived to see the end of Covid.   Meanwhile the Tories partied and stuck two fingers up to every decent person. They’re an absolute disgrace. Hopefully people will remember when we get the chance to kick them out.
disgusting  behaviour,
Sickening, beyond comptempt 😡😪😪
You're telling me politicians lie....shocker
Who is the girl in the red dress? Asking for a friend. She has some good quality tits..
Bloody Liars !!  SACK THE BLOODY LOT OF THEM !!
Pedophiles.
Half the country broke the rules. Hypocrisy from some of the British public. It's still not right they broke the rules, but so did half the country.
Dirty B@stards!!!
Scumbag c*nts, why is anyone surprised! 😠  😡
All government is force and all governments are liars
Who really fuckin cares anymore? Like half the population weren't having piss ups at home!!!
Turds , that is all
Send them all including Boris to Rawanda
From bean to cup, you fuck up!
Typical arrogant Tory youngsters in training for their future careers as arrogant Tory MPs! God help our country's future.
How dumb do you have to be running about recording it all, let alone being recorded. Wonder what else they've gotten up to prior to this.
This is sickening. No more no more
Meanwhile my brother with learning difficulties was in a care home and could not understand why no one could visit .. 2 months later he died from natural cause with not one Member of the family allowed to be with him as he died …..I was 300 miles away and am disabled ..otherwise I would have created havoc at the care home  B***ards!!!….NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET!!!
Bet you all wish you didn’t follow the guidelines now you see how they didn’t …. Sheep
They took you all for mugs..
Given the Mirror Group's record, why should we accept the authenticity of this footage?
People will still listen to these demons and go and get v....d!
We were unable to see our father in-law who sadly passed when these clowns were partying, the all situation needs overhauling... what does the villages do for idiots when these clowns are in town
I had to sit separated from my dear dad while we wept at my grandads funeral, my dad was heart broke and I wasn’t even allowed to put my arm around him , meanwhile, these posh kunts are dancing and having the time of their life, now don’t get me wrong, labour is just as bad, they would rather help a refugee than a homeless veteran, they also can’t even tell us what a woman is, so I have absolutely no faith in them either, we need a new party, a down to earth logical pro British party, a patriotic party that loves Britain and loves freedom
I agree with all the comments but looking at the bigger picture now we know they lied and the lengths they was willing to go to WHAT ELSE DONT WE KNOW they feed us lie after lie with the BBC and delete you if you don't agree or question things QUESTION EVERYTHING
What an absolute disgrace. At the time they were having a great time I was having major surgery and wasn't able to have visitors for the two weeks in hospital. Others couldn't even be with there loved ones when they were dying they should be utterly ashamed of themselves. They should be locked up.
People would have thought twice in 2016/2019 maybe all this wouldn’t have happened but they’re people who get brainwashed easily   Maybe now they’ll re consider who they vote for now and maybe get a real government who doesn’t disrespect the country behind their backs or faces   A real government who could make everything cheap and abolish all the ridiculous laws made by the Tories
and all stupid sheeps go to take 5 jabs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
yet plebs vote tories in every time - oh yes you do especially pleb wimen who counted 1/3 rd of all tory votes for thatcher in the 80's..how'd that work out fer yee ?
Absolute Scum
Lock yourself in you will catch the virus i went all the time out and still havent cought anything 😂😂😂😂😂hypocrite people
watch Talk TV defend it, ignore it or blame corbyn
Dos 2 dancing clowns make it so much worse!!!
Scum - No other word for them.
Scum bags! Absolute proof of manipulating the public!
Tories deserve to lose every election for a very long time because of this shit.
Where I live these insane rules were rarely if ever enforced at all (south bham area), I only wore the masks during the bulk of 2020, I was never accosted by any of the state milita ('police') at the time nor did I ever see any of them patrolling supermarkets etc. I look around now and I still see the societal devastation these 'rules' caused, shops have never recovered, many remain closed down, my local Mcdonalds still has the old plastic screens up from the time, and I still occasionaly see those vile face nappies discarded on the streets from time to time. This mass panic had a cost, and you lot prefer to ignore it for the most part, its mostly why your utility bills are so high, why you are paying far more for goods etc.  This is ALL our faults for obeying these slimeballs at all, for going along with it, and no, the lockdowns didn't stop the spread, it only prolonged the inevitable of all of us catching it, it was going to kill who it killed one way or the other (an yep, it got me aswell, I was out of commission for three weeks barely able to even walk, I didn't need the hospital thankfully, but my breathing got me sweating at a few points.)
holy fuck they are awkward inderviduals, no sense of style or flair, I was just waiting to see if they compare  pockit protectors. And they should all be up on charges at lest 15yrs each
As we have known for a while, we are ran by criminal scumbags.
Sack he whole lot of them all MP’s from all parties knew exactl what was going on , Parliament needs to be pirogued and  a knew party formed ASAP.
🤮
I never listened to the rules did my own thing from the start
So this is how they spend tax payers money and it’s one rule for them and one for those that pay their salaries they seem to have a lot of disdain for all those that suffered during lockdowns. As usua the useless police will do nothing
What els do we expect from these cunxs? That's all they are... cuxts !
I broke the lockdown rules. Because they were a unjust rule. I’m a Englishman and I will not be locked down or obey any unjust rules or laws. This was a unjust law and or rule.
Disgusting  but not surprising every single one of them should get fired and forced ro pay compensation. Sorry will not make it better. The tories are horrible lying Disgusting liers and dancers
That's why us urban ppl of London UK NEVER took & followed NONE of the government rule's & we NEVER had any vaccines . You really think we listen or follow you fool's NEVER 💋💯👍🇬🇧.
Haha how they just swinging around like we locked down
ugly tories at work
Whilst my husband couldn’t say goodbye to his dying grandmother…… this is what they were doing.   Lock  Them Up
The Tories will do ANYTHING to cover up the fact they have been complicit in the biggest scandal this country has ever faced. During the pandemic, we were imprisoned against our will, killed in our tens of thousands by evil and incompetent ministers, had our public funds robbed blind by Tory donors and "friends". Now they honour lawbreakers, barbers and young temp girls. They have taken the piss and abused us all for 13 years. Prosecute and jail them all and I don't think much of Labour who stood by bleeting occasionally and just watched the complete destitution and havoc they have caused this country. Treturouse scum all.
When you think some people were  branded conspiracy theorists...
Just think of all the SHEEPLE who got the scamdemic jab because THESE clowns told them to, baaaaaaah
They actually seem normal. Of course they broke lockdown rules, and lied, who didn't? Imagine it was you given the task of managing Covid and having to start enforcing unprecedented lockdowns. Nobody is prepared for that. Give them a break. They're only human. People were throwing parties when  Thatcher died after all... I'm not sure we're best placed to judge them. Whilst it's a shame (for lack of a better word) people couldn't attend funerals or see loved ones, I can't see how these people (who work together) letting their hair down is any of iur business. How many others didn't get caught who aren't in the public eye?
Covid was a scam itself and they must know that the virus was harmless themselves
No facecover 💦😷💩 want public apology and sacking. The can't be rules for 1 , Then rules for other .
No one stop you from living your life in lockdown apart from who followed the rules myself & all my family friends still saw it each other it was all about control added just proves how easily manipulated most of society is you were all there with you face muzzles & your hand sanitizer
my best mate died during covid lockdown. having to tell family and friends we can only have 30  and to keep distance was horrible. to see these c***s dancing and laughing makes me sick. they made the law they are not above it.
I couldn’t even go in the vet when my dog was getting put to sleep I had to say goodbye to her outside and pass her through the window so I can’t imagine the anger of people who couldn’t go into hospitals when family members was dying! Rats the lot of them!
Here either these people were suicidal and didnt care catching deadly virus or they knew something about this virus that we didn't know. I can't fathom how these people mix with each other at times where people are allegedly dying in 100s young and old because of that virus (unless this was a big game  we were fooled into it and they knew it)
They should all be sacked
How many of your journalists sorry I mean activists done the exact same thing
The most sickening thing about the honours list is the fact that the public will pay for these bellends to sit there for life!
Proper nerds 😂
Well what do you expect from that lot
These are the people who are running this country. Any wonder why things are as they are?
We let a bunch of corrupt c####. But act surprised they are doing what they wmat like they have done for ever. Surprise me with something not torys laughing. I expect nothing less from any one from government
As if the Labour would have done differently. They are all one and the same. Part of a club. Selling bullshit to the pleb and dividing us to reach power. Democracy is a joke. At least a monarch could be killed by his circle for being a bad king. In democracy, they steal the money, bring bullshit regulations during their 4 years, play with people's lives and suffer no consequences for their poor decisions. They get to retire and live on our money with no accountability nor incentive to be just, responsable or wise. They inflate our currency, restrict our freedoms, but you know - it's democracy and power to the people? WHERE? Democracy is a scam.
These should be charged for murder fucking clowns I’m so pissed so many family members died during covid and couldn’t say they’re fair wells
Fucking Tory scum
The only point of this is to produce anger. Propaganda it's time the other puppets get a turn. No vote the best vote
And yet people will still vote for them 😡
Privet tovarishch😂😂😂
These people are vile.
Is there actually a functional brain amongst these entitled zombies? "Do as we say not as we do!". Guess what? Next time we will all be partying on the streets. Going to arrest & imprison an entire population you evil hypocrites.
There really are some despicable people in positions of power in this country: they do what they want.....then BS their way out of any problems. Whichever way you look at this situation: someone is lying, and that speaks volumes about the people that govern us. I,m  not sure who will win the election, but the torys need   to be removed from office, that l do know.
Ok ok so we all broke the rules it was a over reaction
Guy cant dance, nearly knocked the cocaine off the table.
10k fine for the organiser, or are they above the law
They're all sick in the head and corrupt to the core. I'm sick to my stomach seeing this. My thoughts are with those that have lost loved ones at this time and yet weren't allowed to see them at their dying hour. Hold your head in absolute shame, you Torries disgust me to the very core.
I, and my family mist two years  whithout seeing my parents for Christmas. Absolute shower of precious Bastards.
Buddy dancing has been watching too much WWE
How do I block this garbage paper
Looks like a good party 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 we should have all been invited 💪🏼💪🏼
Room full of geared up nonces.
I too laughed about breaking lockdowns.  Where's my attention?  The lesson is don't be a sheep and don't listen to the government when they've a history of lying about everything
Jail them all. If we did that, we'd have been arrested. Scumbags.
Get rid of the lot of them forever
Get the jab..
How ridiculous every one I know pretty much broke the rules, which wasn't cool as I work in the NHS but it was usual. Labour all did as well and there are pictures.. why aren't they all sacked?
Nothings going to happen to any of them
Just enjoying a bit of fun!....it's good !!!
That was not a party. That was unattractive Tories trying to justify their existence.
Matey boy dancing like a prat in his grandma's jumper is clearly coked up.
Scxmbags
Clearly knew the "virus" was no threat to them or anyone else whilst the rest of us cancelled Christmas and couldn't say goodbye to loved ones. What a shower of @hit. They all are. This country needs reform. Quite literally!
Conservative toffs taking the piss at our expense as usual
So while people were threatened with fines, arrests etc for merely checking in on lonely loved ones. A massive mental health crisis for those who lived alone. The government just decided that they weren't going to follow the very rules they set. If a more serious pandemic hit, the government would have a hard time imposing any sort of restrictions on people. They lost the room.
People are so thick. Behind closed doors Tory’s have been taking public money and have been lining theirs and their friends pockets through cleverly crafted schemes. Who gives a sheet about this stupid party.
Contemptuous behaviour aside - the party looked pretty crap
Laughing, and cheering - this is very disrespectful behaviour to those people who were dying from COVID and other illnesses let alone not being able to see family too before they passed.  It's like they're dancing on their graves. Shame on you all Tory cretins.
That  moron in the awful jumper  trying to dance with the bint in red!!! Lmfao  what a pair of twots
Really down to earth lovely people we have the privilege of having to run our country. I can't decide who's more competent, honourable and popular. Labour or Tory?
This looks like a scene from the Office !
And they say other countries are corrupted.😂my question is what about current Tory? Are they any better?
Their laugh makes people so angry
Either Bozo was aware of this when he awarded these clowns their dishonours or he was not. If he wasn't then clearly they should now be recinded. If he was aware however he should be banned from office for life and his whole dishonourable list should be scrapped.
You can never hide that bigger lie....
Moving forward from this whole situation we should be far less willing to have our civil liberties stripped without a fight. Next time they tell us we cannot leave our homes (or visit dying loved ones) without what they deem to be a 'valid' reason simply say no, their power only exists when we allow it to.
Parliment needs a huge clear out
The dancing was pretty criminal as well
Yep, there should be consequences for this abhorrent rule breaking
All of them should be fired with immediate effect.
My favourite Aunt was dying in a Nursing home 200 miles away whilst these cunts were dancing and drinking. Scum. Total Scum. Same as any brainless pratt who has voted conservative.
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Put the lot in prison the dirty bastards
Piss taking bastards! People couldn't even see dying loved ones in hospital while this was going on.
Bru fuk the system  joke ting
Disgusting behaviour from all of them 🤬🤬🤬🤬
People had only themselves to blame for complying with the crap governments doled out worldwide.
This is sickening why we waited to get into shops not being able to see family and friends sack the lot of them
I feel so angry at seeing this.
CUNTS.
Lil rats look at em
One of the saddest moments for the late Queen was when she had to sit alone in church for her husband's  funeral , despicable ! They could have allowed  her daughter  Anne to at least sit and comfort her  !!
BITCH THINKS SHE'S ON STRICTLY  ☝🏾
How many people died alone because we were told to social distance!! I nearly missed the birth if my son because of that bullshit and these guys were on the sesh!!!!
Biggest pieces of shit I've ever seen, now everyone who got fined during lock down should al be immediately refunded, the thing was a farce from the off
Face it how it is......we scum they are not..... ..that is how they have always looked at working class..........we are little bitches doing as we are told to make their lives easier
Good for them at least somebody had a good time don't really care about any of this
Despicable
To the gallows with the bloody lot of traitors
They knew it wasn't serious and after a couple of months so should everyone else.
In the past 5 years every thing has gone to sh@ while the wages of mp’s have risen
But we don't want Labour either, time to rise up and remove BOTH and rebuild the system from the ground up.
Honestly, it's been more than a year now if people are still crying at this get over it. Yes they broke the own rules so did half of the country. It's not as big of a deal as they make it. Even though I must say it's annoying to see them smile and laugh thinking they are above the rules
they laughed and joked because they knew it was a scam all along
Shows me how the fear and restrictions were overblown yet they were happy to take our freedoms from us.
This is exactly why i didnt follow any rules
Disgrace.
This makes me so fucking angry! I lost my nan in 2020 and got it had to have a limited capacity funeral then I lost my second nan a year the day after my first nans passing and I had to say good bye to her through a window, I couldn’t go in and see her and tell her how much I loved her and these idiots doing this! If you vote for the tories then shame on you!
My nan died during covid , and the one and only time we broke covid rules is when the hospital(reluctantly) let us go in and watch her die , hold her hand and all that. During this time , 4 different nurses came in and told us we can’t be there in the room , while my nan is less than 30 seconds from death. If I ever meet boris Johnson or any of these knobs , I will use this video to explain why I mirdered them
How old is this ! The police investigated it months ago and no fines were issued. A bunch of toffs just doing what many did in lockdown anyway. Idiots, the lot of them.
I really have a hard time giving a damn about this. "Rules are for the obeyance of fools, and the guidance of wise men"
Andrew tate  is right look at the state of these geeks they need the strong men to be push overs and even sent to war so these weak geeks can try rule  the world .
Prison.
I would of been laughing to and you know what so would most of you lot! Get over it, the rest if the world is laughing at us, there's way more important things we should be worrying about not this bollocks!!
How can anyone vote for these clowns? They’re just mocking the British public now
Who are those 2 twats dancing?
Yeah, because like some of us, they knew it was bullshit! Shock! Should have listened to some of the people you called "conspiracy theorists"!
I think I'm more insulted by the fact that they are too incompetent to keep it a secret by not filming the party
Definitely a work event.
Disgusting snobs. People lost out on so much, while you liars cheated the public....I hope you are proud of yourselves. You are the proof of what the government is all about. 🤬🤬🤬
They all look likes clown just like Boris him self. I still can’t believe British people actually made Boris prime minister of uk.
Anyone who wore a mask, got vaccinated and bought into all the fear and farce deserves the misery and slavery they so desire.  They'd eat shit if their masters in government and media told them to.
Looks more or less exactly how I'd imagine a Tory office party.  Very depressing scenes, I hope it was worth it
The last time i seen my mum was through a hospital window and you have these waste of spaces running our country... Shame on them all
Scumbags
Never forget what these control freaks did
Remember, Labour is equally guilty.
The next bs crisis is climate change you will see them racing v12s as they're telling you to walk.
Are we supposed to be surprised by this. They scam the whole country every minute of everyday.
Absolutely shameful display.We should never ever of listened to these lockdown zealots who showed utter contempt for the rest of the U.K.💩
Fucking scumbags
lock these criminals up
Now I know why ppl abroad call us Brits cold blooded slaves of the system. Imagine this happening in France 4 example.
Now do labour antisemitism, fun game.
Bots are already trying to defend this. DON'T BOTHER. These people are disgusting. Dancing and boozing and laughing while people had to die alone.
Fire all of them
How sad that those nerds actually think that is a party
I bet anything the other parties were doing the same thing......partying 😂
They should be fined and sacked. While they are breaking all the rules and having a laugh and joke they had no respect for the pain some people had to go through during lockdown either watching family or friends die be it through a window on the phone or what ever makes me sick and to think that tools like that are running this country what a joke.
Can’t believe people waste so much time and money talking about such shit, everybody knows…or they should that any elected official of any party is only there for their own good and couldn’t give a shit about the average Joe public……that’s just a given….get over it and move on. The UK must be the worst country in the world for wasting money this kind of crap.
They've been in power so long they think they're untouchable. Meanwhile they car crashed us out of Europe on the slimmest of margins, with a stupid but very effective slogan and we're now living with the results. Rampant inflation. Nothing in the shops and interest rates through the roof "Take back control" really meant "completely lose control". F charlatans.
No one is even surprised they did this, it’s shocking but not actually surprising. And none of them are really sorry.
The laughter of those who think they're untouchable
Complete foolish drunkards trying to dance (cringe) 🤢🥴🥴
😮😮😮
we are the fools for complying...lockdown was a nonsense ....dont blame them for breaking the 'rules' ....get angry with them for imposing rules on us that were not needed....
Labour are going to flip so, so, many seats next December!
scums
This is some serious typical comedy movie type, I can't actually believe someone really recorded this and actually said "As long as we don't stream that we're bending the rules"   there's just no way we live in this world.
bring back the guillotine
Still believe the narrative do you ???  Fools !!
Never trust politicians or there policies!!!!
When people couldn't even visit their dying relatives ... Un fucking believable.
For my sins I’m a diehard Tory, but this is sickening to watch. What a bunch of muppets, I hope the police prosecute them in retrospect & the numpty awarded an OBE has it rescinded! 😡
This is disgusting; my dad died alone in hospital without me and my mum, I actually got physically forced out for visiting my dad even though I was wearing the right PPE
Tories are the ones who need to be kicked out of the country
Are people getting it now? These people have nothing but contempt for you, the country, the law. Entitled twats.
Mother Fuckers!
Tories = Globalist Policies, Great Reset, CBDC, Introduction Of US Private Medical Companies Into The UK, Transgender Medical Procedures On Children.  Labour = Globalist Policies, Great Reset, CBDC, Introduction Of US Private Medical Companies Into The UK, Transgender Medical Procedures On Children.  Don't Vote Labour! Don't Be Fooled Again!
These people should be in prison!!
Still people will vote tory.
Pigs
Technically you could argue that it wasn't a party as there are far too many gimps and rejects at it to classify it as an actual party
imagine if something happens to their families 😏😏😏😏
Until us all start to critically review the book call Animal Farm, and strat to think critically, order than that,  the masses will always be used and suffered the most.
No one was closer to the 'experts' and the 'scientists' than the cabinet.  They knew the restrictions were over the top.  The real idiots are the ones who believed in it!!
Toffs being toffs. More people need to learn to play the system rather than feed it
to show you how corrupt the whole establishment is, they (met police) will "investigate" the matter and find nothing suspicious to press charges. Meanwhile, this vid was on hold for maybe years now, and came out just now after Boris has been suspended as an MP. Finally, Chris Witty, who was the "voice of science" during covid period, is in the HoL immune from any scrutiny. Media could have published this video 2 years ago, but they played their part well....
They’ll still get voted in
Thts  why people don't respect the law anymore.. when they see videos like this
Not that im condoning this as acceptable, everybody i knew broke the rules during covid. Why is everyone so hypocritical?
They all deserve their faces kicked in or stage 4 cancer. Both seems fitting.
Tories can't dance for toss
Welcome to our corrupt government and police force absolutely embarrassing to our country and monarchy
these people are scum. not the slightest bit of care in the world, laughing and dancing away. I, fortunately, didn't lose anyone during the lockdown... but I know people who did and could not be with their loved ones in their final moments....whilst these tossers were partying away and threatening to fine us if we broke the rules... I'm sickened by the way it was all hushed up and meaningless apologies given to try to make it right. Not a chance...I hope they get fined and lose their jobs.
Scum floats to the top
They should be arrested and locked up,people in positions of power should have tougher sentences not lighter, scumbags
Strip them all of every "Honour"
😂😂😂😂 I like
Tell me, sheep. How many of these high-ranking psychopaths died for the tall tale you believed without question?
Just goes to show how much contempt they have for all of us, even Queen Elizabeth stuck to the lockdown rules while “her” government were laughing about it behind her (and our) backs
Go on and laugh at us. You all should be my e ashamed of yourselves but you are the Tories so you don't care about anyone else but yourselves
Lol we are the slaves
They were laughing at us during Covid they are still doing it. Bunch of lying self indulgent shysters the lot of them.
honestly, who didn't broke the rules, we are here blaming people off yet we have more serious stuff to focus on... lets forget the past and move ON already.
They've got some moves... Pity they can't run the country or obey their own rules as good.
The fool in the jumper...should go straight to prison....for just being himself!!!
And these people have the cheek to tell us what we can and can’t do
This is disgusting 🤢🤢🤢😊
They laughed at you, while you swallowed a lie as big as a cathedral and obeyed like a sheep.
I am so appalled by this. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for this. Whether you were all in a work bubble already or not, we were instructed countless times not to host parties, not even garden or park ones with the theory that if alcohol is consumed at any such gatherings it will impair people's decision making abilities and therefore they will not observe social distancing rules. Pubs and restaurants were shut down for months on end because of this ffs, so much so that Rita ora and her fiance had to bribe their restauranteur friend to host their secret party but still got caught in the end.  This is so appalling.
I worked as a funeral arranger during this time , I witnessed families not being allowed to hug each other when they came to visit loved ones at the funeral home because they lived in separate homes … they were respecting government rules… i along with many others witnessed people going through added heartbreak during this time … 5 people at a funeral and asking families to choose their 5 .. and all the while these vile disgusting people danced laughed and ridiculed them .. I am sickened and my heart goes to all those people who suffered and still do
Fuckin joke they are but they where not the only ones most of the labour party had a party too they are all fuckin corrupt no wonder I don't vote what with this and the fuckin boats this nation is done for disgusting
Totally out of order ,said Gove (that we got caught)
Privileged toffs with standards lower than Whale Shit.
This sickens me to my core. My mum passed away due to COVID complications, I was only 19 at the time I’m 22 now, but she was a key worker, she had to continue working through the pandemic, she always wore her PPE and worked tirelessly through such a devastating time. But even with all the precautions she took, all the rules she followed that was enforced by this government, she still passed away. Seeing how they laugh about breaking the rules that their government put in place just to host a party is disgusting. I am a independent student now with no parents to support me, I’m still struggling but I continue on for my mum because I want to make her proud. But I can never forgive this government for their behaviour, unprofessional, criminal comes to mind as well.
Sit them all down and give them a good dose of Pfizer that should send them to exactly where many unsuspecting people ended up because of their filthy lies. Evil on a grand scale
I… am… Jack's… complete… lack… of… surprise.  😢
Im glad I collected and took my mother back to her home daily through lockdown, no covid and quality time spent that I had not had with her since childhood. She passed last year unexpectedly within 48hrs due to a bleed on the brain and covid wasn't able to be used as the excuse or cause. Never blindly follow these arrogant self untitled, selfish far removed stains on humanity
Proper Fucking dick heads.
They're all doing it. Labour, Conservatives, Tories it doesn't matter. Until people stop voting this nonsense will carry on.
absolutely fucking disgusting
For all the ones who complied you deserved everything you got, Baa.
Absolute crime against humanity
Chin the fking lot of them
the rules where trying to protect the country, what they do behind closed doors has nothing to do with that....
Well that's stupid.
It breaks my heart to see this. I lost my Mum and my Little Brother  in 2021. I could have spent so much time with them in our home if it weren’t for those restrictions. Hurts and makes me angry. Very angry.
Sack the lot .Burn the place down
Bet non of them went to a state school .
To all the ppl blaming Boris over this yes your are correct his an idiot, but don't for one second believe this wouldn't have happened if it was someone else. These pillocks and I mean all of them don't speak for the people it's a free ride to richness. Sack em all every last one
This is the new political party video by the conservatives abroad party your vote does not matter  the British prime minister is elected by non British citizens who join conservatives abroad and get to vote whilst giving donations to the Tory party. Wonder why American Boris and Rat man where non elected leaders
Covid was just a tool to scare people and to create fear and control, which it did. Meanwhile people died without their loved ones next them, others suffered  in silenced as they couldn’t see their friends or family, all while doctors and medical staff did TickTock videos and parliament drank and partied. If you noticed, the masks and social distancing disappeared once Boris and those in high power were behind closed doors. Now we are paying the price for their deliberate actions, the “cost of living” crisis, isn’t it amazing how quickly they come up with these slogans? Build back better, in this together… 🤔meanwhile we have extremely high food bills, over the top energy bills and the rising cost of mortgages. All of this could have been everted if we’d stayed open and continued as normal.
I love how we're all supposed to act surprised at this. Like Johnson wasn't a complete clown since way back before he was even Mayor. Back in his University days, he got David Cameron to do that thing, you know, with the pig, but that was a long time ago and he hasn't done anything remotely funny since. He's like an albino Orang Utan with Down's syndrome. Ook ook, does Bo-Bo want an ice cream?
There is a social distancing sign on the wall! It is not just BJ, all who supported him and put such a character in charge and kept on lying until the sun came out are responsible for BJ ‘s behaviour.
Outrageous. Shocking... Also seems like a boozed up rager...
So far far away from the public and we pay their wages, Disgusting privileged S**t's.
These guys are definitely using cocaine
Absolute scumbags
I didn't really follow the restrictions that much either when I was testing negative for COVID. Obviously when I was positive I self isolated... You know, using reasonable sense to make reasonable decisions, not fully zombifying myself to whatever the government told me to do on any given day. So I guess this didn't annoy me that much because I'm not at all surprised.  But to everyone else, this is a lesson you need to take with you. Do not trust the media, do not trust the government, even when it's labour, even if you like the PM... Think for yourselves, otherwise you're going to be made to look stupid.
Glad I didn't take the vaccine and evaded the rules wherever possible. The entire situation was extremely stupid and dictatiorial and they very well knew it, but somehow expected every one of us to follow the rules while  they were dancing, getting drunk and having parties as they always did.
Great jumper 🎉🎉just shows you these clowns are only in the job for themselves
Those of us who got branded as conspiracy theorist’s by the MSM, knew this whilst it was happening & now the MSM are acting like the purveyors of truth & dignity! Government & MSM are the real criminals throughout the whole Plandemic!!!
It literally knocks me sick and enrages me. These are the epitome of toffs blatantly putting themselves above the law and above the very people they serve. All the unimaginable suffering people were going through and this ? The police are culpable too. They should all be prosecuted. They disgust me. General election now.
Ah yes because the tories were the only ones.. not just the entire governemtn
Bill Gates said that Covid affects the elderly, the obese and the diabetic. He knew. We should never have locked down younger, healthy people. The lockdowns were political and didn't work: See Sweden - the lowest excess deaths in Europe and they didn't have strict rules. Those in power new this and so weren't afraid to break their own rules. They should get jail time. Never forget. Never forgive.
If you are watching this and you voted Conservative, give yourself a smack right now - look yourself in the mirror; ask yourself what on earth you were you thinking and then smack yourself for being daft.  How did you not know the Conservatives were a bunch of sleaze balls?
So many people were laid off due to covid, businesses went bankrupt and some people couldnt see their families... if this isnt proof that covid was a hoax then i dont know what is.
This government party clearly can't even organise an actual party🤣 give me a family zoom quiz anyday over that tripe
How long as The mirror been sitting on this? Why not pass it on to the police, Sue Gray or the Privileges Committee the moment you came into possession of this damning evidence?
Tory Scumbags
Tory leadership has to end regardless of who else is in the running
Glad i use to to proper parties this is so lame
It’s a club and we ain’t in it !
Tory party= scum party.
get rid of labour and conservatives.
Despicable statue chuckers worse
Sums it all up
We need names of these pathetic excuses on human beings.
Complete narcasist arseholes. I have no faith in labour or the cons. Disgusting people.
This shows how unnecessary lockdowns were used to control people and destroy the economic. Class action lawsuits should be filled against the conspirators without any delay.
Makes me happy that I never followed their ridiculous rules seen all my family and friends everyday had parties at new year and for birthdays and this is why because I refuse to be controlled by privately schooled millionaire morons !!
What a bunch of cockwombles !!!
It was all fake to begin with and we was the dummies!
I know it won't happen, but King Charles should sack the lot of 'em and call a GE like NOW!
Beggars belief.
What chance do we have when people like this show complete disregard for the law and respect for the citizens of our country.
I have known since I was 17 years old and my Dad was a miner that the Tories are abhorrent conscienceless privilege driven demons - is this a wake-up call for the rest of you?
Disgusting!!! When we were promised a 5 day window to see our loved ones over the Christmas period, only for it to change to Christmas Day only for 3 households to meet in one house.. we lived in fear of Covid 19 and being told by government on a daily basis how many deaths there had been from it. We stayed away from our families because we were told to do so. What a joke!! Even the late Queen sat on her own at Philips funeral because of restrictions the government placed on us.. Shame on them !
This looks like a shite party!
The Tory party makes my skin crawl, as well as Johnson himself
These fuckers make me ill even the dancing looks nasty 😂
Sheeps deserve this
This video is peak Tory…..very uncool, very clumsy, very out of touch.
It’s all coming out now just waiting for labours party videos
My great grandad died during covid and all I could do was wave at him through the window. Whenever I think about this I get VERY angry with these horrible people, and I feel so sorry for my poor Nanny who he stayed with when he was dying. To think that whilst people are dying these adults were partying hard in a basement ILLEGALLY and laughed and joked about it. AND THEN BORIS JOHNSON LIES ABOUT IT SAYING ‘they never happened’! 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬😢😢😢😡😡😡
I must say that this is very sickening and disgusting. we saw people dying alone and families unable to say their goodbyes because of the strict rules. The rules that were made by the very same people who were having parties like this one. I even remember one son who cried looking at his mother from outside her room from a small window.
I’m so glad I didn’t follow the rules. Having these lot telling the average man what to do and when joke.
Well they won't make strictly come dancing that's for sure!!
Utter knobjockies
Total Tossers!
Scumbags
Imagine breaking the rules your own party introduced and drawing the ire of the nation's aggrieved, to go to _this_ absolute tragedy of a "party".
And the corporate compliant virtue signalling baton swinging cowards in blue. Will still protect these shabbos goys
Let's all post comments, forget about this by tomorrow and carry on dancing to their tune yay!!
Should be mad,but Now I don’t care,the Entire Western world except Sweden,went through Unnecessary bullsh*t lock down,and there were poor outcomes,Sweden went a different root ,the fit and strong got on with their lives,and the Swedish state ploughed money into protecting the vulnerable ..Its Over Now,sick about hearing about the lock down era,it’s done and finished..The State lied ,Simples
what are we mad at? the fact the lockdowns were so pointless the people enforcing them didnt feel the need to abide by them or that they didnt abide by the pointless lockdowns?
bro thought he'd get pussy
They tell us to follow the rules and yet they cannot even take their own advice. Its absolutely ridiculous 🙄
These bastards owe us later bar opening times now 😂 absolute imbeciles the lot of them
Please do not fall for this double bluff - a social gathering is not and will never be a crime. Take a moment to consider the countless real crimes that were committed during that period of time by these people and how your outrage has been misplaced if you are emotionally engaged with this
Lockdown 😂 😂😂😂 what a joke
😅😅😅😂
SCUM, LOCK EM UP
I want these heartless tyrants out of the parliament! Sometimes, I wish I wasn't British and this is one of the reasons why!
Do all Tory boys laugh that way? Scum
This video highlights the fact that the government can never be trusted. Ever.
My father died in hospital , confused and alone, he walked into the hospital on a thursday afternoon and died monday morning , i still find it hard now to understand , we were allowed in once on the sunday evening by that time he was not talking and sleeping , i never got to say goodbye to the man i adored all my life, who was there for me every day i needed him , we wasnt even allowed a wake as they closed pubs the day it was suppose to be on , i couldnt even carry his coffin into church , this is disgusting so many people are in the same postion as me , but we can never get those days back , id give my whole world up to sit n hold his hand and say goodbye , good ,hard working ,honest people were left to die with no loved ones , while these mongrels are partying makes me sick , william arthur hancox born 23/04/1952 died 12/10/2020 i love you dad , and miss you every day xx
Loooora Lora why do working class families want these toffs in charge they’re not the same toffs of the past when this country was powerful they’re like kids dressed as adults. Stop voting Tory muppets.
Just what is the history of this tape? Why did it take so long to surface? This video would of fri3d and toasted boris long ago...and what about the people who were there who got lordship peerage honours last week? All it does is that it confirms everything everyone knew about the tories that they were lying about the BYOB parties that happened in number 10. Its disgusting but not surprising.
Thing is, the media, BBC and sky news. They all new this was going on and only after Tictoc exposed it did the mainstream media excluding BBC, put the evidence out. BBC wouldn't they do as their told by the Nazi party. That's just my opinion
Who voted tories ? If you did  Sorry to say if you lost people then it's blood on your hands  Did u really think tories cared about you 😂
remember people, you're just plebs to these toff "keep it in the family" types. especially if you read a red paper like the mirror. designed to keep you in your bubble
What a mess!
Not only they’re bad they’re stupid why film it and not delete it haha if you’re gonna be immoral at least be clever about it, but I’m glad they weren’t.
I can see where the 'plandemic' crowd are going with some of the comments here. This is only going to increase the sense of paranoia, which is a highly unfortunate by-product of this reprehensible behaviour.
Should all get a fine for letting him wear that jumper.
So many of you MASSIVE ballbags voted for this party, laughable
Mirror spun garbage
Contemptuous entitled bastards!
This is what entitlement and privilege looks like in 21st century Britain. Everyone in the video should lose their jobs and livelihoods.
This party looks shit anyways, no way I would risk covid to go to a boring lil office social
Vile.
You must stay home! You must stay home!
It is funny that this may be what brings them down but they done far worse than this. For example their policies needlessly killed 10,000s of thousands of people. They stole public money. They have made millions of people's lives misery through austerity and other policies. They have increased the number of people reliant on food banks exponentially. They have wasted billions of public money to support America's dodgy foreign policy in Ukraine.  They have fecked over the NHS workers by refusing to give them a fair pay rise. They have passed draconian legislation that would be more at home in Communist China, that makes it extremely difficult for people to protest or strike, i.e. taken away their democratic rights. I could go on but I am sure you get the point.
It shows how pathetic politicians can be
Our Uncle Frank died from covid In hospital after a head injury fall and had no proper funeral,and we lost our Mum who never gained her confidence or strength to go back out and wasn’t able to hug her because of covid for last part of her life!!!The rage I feel is unreal right now!🤬
And this is why we need to get rid of these overpaid vile cretinous criminals. This video just shows us all how there is absolutely no respect given to the population of this country. They see the very people who actually fix and build everything in the uk as disposable things that they can mock at will.  Disgusting 🤬
When are criminal charges going to happen?
Scum, labour all the way
.The English are deeply ashamed of not being who they used to be .    Reply
Disgraceful - this should bring down the government.  It really is on a par with launching an illegal invasion on a sovereign nation that lead directly to 300,000 Iraqi deaths.
Actual fucking scum the lot of them
My mum died from covid in March 2021, I didn’t get to see her on Christmas or at all durning those months meanwhile they are partying and laughing about it, absolutely disgusting lot, lock them up and throw away the key
Not surprised, It’s the first party these losers ever got an invite too
First of all, the obsession with this by the media is mind boggling. I know the media is dominated by the left, but this country has been 'gripped' by this 'scandal' for about 2 years now? Secondly, if any of you numpties actually were daft enough to follow government dictates, that's on you. You're the stupid one. I didn't miss Christmas with my family. Some of them flew in. I think part of the reason for the 'outrage' is that people feel embarrassed that they followed the 'rules' and surprise surprise, elites didn't. Most of it is fake and politically motivated.
I say boycott the Mail newspaper for employing that rancid liar!
Sack everyone that was there or involved and strip all of any honours. While they were telling the country to do one thing they just plain did what they wanted
I wonder how much they got for providing this video to the newspaper as many people will be angry  now as many people were told not to see there family during covid. but the couples dancing :O This is why government get away with things as money talks.
Devils
they wont even acknowledge the excess deaths every week, they knew it was all one big fat plan, they knew what the who the un had plans to do, we know klauss shwaab and any political leader coming from this cult into  top gov jobs is all planned they tell you this to our face , we really do need them all takin away for a long time behind fucking bars.
Sickening
I've gotta go laugh where was this news paper when starmer and many other Labour party mps in Northampton  answer nowhere to be seen get honest cover both sides not one
Complete and total MSM attack as if it was all planned by Dr Evil, ask yourself why…… politics
Wait..was the a deleted scene from the office Christmas special..so much material, the cliches..you cant write this stuff. I want to know if the people dancing ended up snogging...
What do you expect from a party of human sewage. I wonder if any of them ended up losing someone.
Irrefutable proof that the "covid" pandemic was a scam.
One rule for thee another rule for me
I would take that lady in Red for a ride anytime. I wouldn't say no. I wonder how many of them have got dead family members because of this party. That would be funny. And if these fuckers are getting OBE's and Knighthoods, then its time to give Jimmy Saville his back. Hows about that then folks
Never shall we comply again
Disgusting.
vermin the lot of them.
Toff scvm! Fvkk every single Tory. You're all the same.
So I suppose this was a Tory party tory party?
Utter scumbags. This isn't about party politics. These people aren't elected mps but civil servants.  They should have been sacked for gross misconduct.  A fixed penalty fine is just not enough
The bad dancer man is now probably thinking he's going to be on Strictly now, that's how  the selfish tory party MPs think
The country won’t listen again
Don't blame the tories, blame the imbeciles that voted them in!
They risked their own lives, knowing that they could die form coning into contact with each other ?
I lost my parents on the December on the 14th 😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
Tories being Tories. Arrogant and entitled, as ever.
Morally bankrupt it’s not what you are it’s what you do that defines you SCUM
Why the fuk do the people in government think there above the law. I lost my nan and father during covid and could see them. I should get a government payment for my hardship as they don't care about anyone. Uk is doomed with people like this in power.
We have been fined for gating together with family and these people are enjoying and breaking all laws no one gonna do nothing
Disgraceful the Tory’s are, utterly disgusting.
The elites won’t practice what they preach. Who would’ve known? 🤷🏻‍♂️  It’s not like the ‘conspiracy theorists’ said this time and time again.
Jokers
Why are these people not being prosecuted.. At this time I remember people being dragged into police vans for less.. Snobbery at its best ..fcukers
Imagine being a conservative supporting these people 💀
Just goes to show you can't trust any politicians in the UK, complete liars every single politician
Absolute scum of the earth. Makes you wonder why they felt safe doing that. Makes me feel like they intentionally blew it out of proportion to control everyone for 2 years, like all those conspiracy theorists were saying
😡
Joke I lost my dad through covid while these jokers party 🤬
So what we were all breaking the rules and it was encouraged either execute the man or leave him be there should be no Inbetween, what a sad life people in Britain live absolute nobodies
Ponces and nonces
Like sheep people followed lockdown rules, swallowed imperials bogus modelling stats known to be wrong from the foot and mouth, took untested jabs by the millions and then cry because you were all fools.  Next time someone says they will take your liberties away FIGHT not cry afterwards.  There are lots of freedoms being attacked right now from police forces not processing any firearms licences without any kick back to ULEZ and 15 minute cities… confining people to single areas and restricting freedom of movement.  Don’t cry on two years when a politician can move through ULEZ zones in your city and you cannot!
Unforgettable evil vile monsters.
what a set of dweebs man, state of them absolute boring losers.
WHAT THE LIVING FU-
I wonder when The Mirror obtained this video?, is it recently or have they been sitting on it for two years?.
Privaleged Prats.
Can't be trusted to run the country.  Can't even dance without crashing into tables
This has all been dealt with so making a big fake indignation deal out of details now is cheap, interesting how the pro EU traitors think if they all say the same lie at once it will magically become truth..
W🤡RLD
Quod erat demonstrandum...May I kindly suggest that next election you people elect adults?
Would love to say Labour were innocent in this...but they were pushing (and abusing) the lockdown same as the Tories.
Sewer germs
There needs to be a revolution right now!
This will probably still not wake people up to the fact covid was bullshit and the government work against you... if people chose to not visit family during Christmas thats on them... taking orders and shit from dictators who laugh behind your back loooool  this is great Britain we are free to do what we want...
Call me old fashioned, but do we really have to say "fine them" and "sack them" as though it's a remotely proportionate penalty? Are we absolutely CERTAIN that extra-judicial firing-squads have outlived their purpose? Just food for thought...🤔
I can't see Boris in this video - where is he?
Yep, they set this up whenever they want to get rid of people within government who don't dance to the tune of the masters they will get rid of them and they always appoint who they want Trust mirror to report this , no stories on how someone who makes £5000 a week from scratch or your fake lottery anonymous winners or what about the fake unclaimed tickets
👎 Love to see the numbers 😮
Politici, the people don't need that F ups. Worthless persons
Scum the lot of em
My best friend who was like a uncle to me who gave me good advice and always was there for me died during covid and because of covid laws I could not say goodbye to him at his funeral I had to sit in my car outside the church watching from a live video I could not hug any of his family and pray for there loss and yet these corrupt sick heartless people got a little slap on wrist a £50 fine and was able to laugh about it behind our backs 😡😡😡😡 no one will ever listen or trust anything the government says anymore screw the lot of them 🖕🖕
Why should Boris be allowed to give out awards if he broke the law? Whilst he treated us like animals to be caged, they got to have fun, and then laugh in our faces, whilst the army and extra police enforcement were sent out to detain us. The government makes me sick, a bunch of psychopaths, all of them. And cowardly ones too. when there's another epidemic, they are going to hide in their bunkers and leave the rest of us to die. They left people to die during Covid and he's giving out awards, so they don't hurt his feelings and give him some shitty pretend status, absolutely disgusting!!! The government and sycophants should be ashamed of yourselves. Not to mention I haven't forgotten all those nurses and drs who walked out on patients to leave them to die in other countries and yet our country got shouted at for trying to make the general public happy, during their breaks. I haven't forgotten that!!!  I don't care if their other countries and it's none of our business, it is my damn business, if other countries can pick and choose to forget us when it pleases them. That was a crime they left hospitals empty, just cause their governments told them to! The whole thing is a joke, just so you know the next time there's a bloody lock down family and loved ones, friends are invited. Disgraceful.
Not a.chance.inhell
They aren’t “bending” the rules, they are straight up “breaking” them.
The police didn't issue fines for this party due to lack of evidence. Which means that somebody deliberately hid this video from the police. Which is perverting the course of justice. Which is a very serious crime. Or, The metpoliceuk are corrupt.
Every fucking one of them who was at that party need to be sacked and prosecuted.
Wankers
Meanwhile the rest of England had to watch their  loved ones through a smart phone while they where in a coma.
How the rich get their  privileges
This is why nurses, and doctor's are striking  for more pay. More importantly more respect and recognition
No shame at all, just full of lies
OF COURSE the evil Tory scum don't stick to the rules.  They make them to apply to US, not to themselves.  THEY don't need to obey the law:  who would prosecute them? - they own the police.
You have tp ask why wasn't this put in the paper alongside Boris standing in the doorway. Why weren't these young idiots arrested. Amongst others who joined the party 🎉
These people are running the country? 🤦‍♂️Wake up people
Scumbags! First they take Russian money for the Brexit campaign, they were slow to acknowledge that a pandemic which resulted in 260k plus deaths and then this rule breaking parties during COVID whilst many were dying. Why is this party and members allowed to even exist?
What a bunch of c u n t s
So many people broke the lockdown restrictions. I saw countless people holding parties and coming in and out of each others houses in large numbers.  	I really think there are much more important things to focus on right now than who did and didn’t ‘bend the rules’.  	I remember swarms of people heading to the beaches and parks, and most people were scared of Covid and disapproved but those people that weren’t haven’t all been rounded up and prosecuted. 	Lockdown is long over it’s time to move on.
Is this actually a surprise to anyone?
TWATS
It's not like Brois and crew will live for ever death will come to them too and they will also be alone grave. If they was to live for ever then I'll say oh! No! they are winning 🥇 but they are simply on the same boat 🛥 as us. They so deluded and confused yet they know from right to wrong how do the function. 😂 They all will face The Judge in court by Allah The God. AL means The and ILah means God. The God.
So these guys broke the LAW put in the place and only get fined, if it was me I would of got prison time :) people lost their whole lives while these people were having a fun time at our expense, remember their faces for when your having a bad day and one of these cunts walk past you.
Funniest part is the current prime minister was at the party’s as well yet the press seam very quiet about that.
What makes me f sick is that these see you next Tuesdays will be re-elected...
What a bunch of cunts.
the makers of the rules, they're immune to their own rules 😂
All must be accountable & fined each one  £20000
Name and shame and then sack the lot of them.  The woman in red should be sacked alone for being a rank dancer.
Time for Nuremberg 2.0, straight to jail no costly parliamentary investigations paid for by the taxpayer, up in front of Judges and peoples juries asap.
There are many issues with this, but being stupid enough to take a video of this has got to be up there. Only a complete idiot would have videoed a party during a covid lockdown. Luckily they only run the country!
😂😂😂I can’t be angry at this as I ignored the rules the whole time
Imagine breaking rules for this dead ass shoobz! Tory’s though innit they would sell their nan for a line of Charlie…
Cocaine and alcohol 🎉🎉🎉 everybody happy there
Pity they hadn't all caught it and got rid of em, and that idiot and tart in red, should all be put in jail.
The story here is not rule breaking - it’s that they all knew lockdown was a scam
They’re running our country!
I'm here for the 'posh wankers' comments
What a bunch of tossers
Any real men about?
Didn’t get to kiss my stepmother and thank her for all she had done for me 🙏 RIP Val  it was all lies , they knew they weren’t at risk ! We must never forget what they , and the so called experts did to us !
It's probably a Tory thing where unfortunate rules apply to "the little people". Right?
OMG !!!🤪 Really, !!! How did this leak and how can Boris now defend his comment "I know i lied but i did not mean to mislead the house". How can he now say it was a kangeroo court that threw him out of the house of commons ? Rishy was also at these parties, should he not also resign ? Immediately ? if not why not ?👯‍♀👯‍♂👯
The Government mps can only fail upwards Hmm any other job you be sacked lol
Don't give a crap about the country and its people, just party because if you make laws you are above it. This is what you get if stupig people can vote, they choose stupid leaders.
My mother has been a nurse for the NHS for over 30 years and she caught Covid through looking after patients, yet only after contracting covid after the first 2 weeks she was being pressured and then forced to go back to work due to staff shortages  and these people in government were partying to contribute more to the pandemic rather than being a solutuon! Disgusting l! 😡
Could job I didn't  stay in the house
Imagine, these are the leaders of the United Kingdom's Of Great Britain, Scotland & Ireland, as well as it's colonies.
Point is Boris has never believed that the rules applied to him, so the minions beneath him will just have the same attitude: they’re all just a bunch over - self -entitled  privately- educated  Tories who think themselves above the law. If Boris can break the rules with impunity, why shouldn’t they? Chaz in Brentwood
If this doesn't tell you that covid was a scam then you will never wake up. Most people just see people breaking the rules. I see people that that were not worried about covid because they knew the real facts and not the blown up hipe that the media all spun us. Remember all the PPE contacts and shares in vaccine companies which many managed to profit from.
Sickening and evil.
I just can't summon the outrage expected of me at the sight of people living their lives.   Didn't care when Starmer was seen having a beer. Didn't care when Boris was in the No 10 garden. Don't care that these people were eating and blowing off steam. The lockdown shouldn't have happened in the first place. That was the real outrage.
name and shame everyone on this video
If you still defend these draconian lizards you're a mug and deserve to be humiliated for the rest of your life.
Shocking we must vote Labour😂 and on the revolving door turns
Christmas Jumper Boy thought he was getting his h0le after the party.....
Tory CUUU*TS
Like we don't know how bent & corrupt these politicians are anyway 😂😂😂😂
Disgusting.
Utter bastards.
Covid-19 was such a deadly pandemic that the rule makers didn't believe in their own rules.
Wtf even was that
Go on lads, such great men!
They are ALWAYS partying while people are dying.
Why no one's mention about cocaine there,  was sullied. She have nice @@ but she is 🤮 .
Dance moves from the 1920s and that jumper is hideous
Apart from the deplorable behaviour of these people in the face of what was happening at the time, it's also sickening to see what kind of people are involved in the governance of this country. This is the ugly face of privilege and arrogance, a bunch of junior twots learning how to treat the rest of us with utter contempt.Has anyone named and shamed everyone appearing in this video? This should be career-ending for them.
Anyone who votes Tory really do require psychological help.
Tory Scum
What a pack of b*****s
Even if they didn't get filmed - do those in attendance seriously think KARMA wasn't watching ?  KARMA: knows all, sees all, hears all.....
Diabolical liberties
assholes
Bunch of MUGS
Rules for thee  but not for me
Wow.  How surprising.  I'm so shocked.  Thankfully I had the common sense to not be a dumb lemming and I also didn't follow a single dictate of 'guidance' or even consider getting the experimental and dangerous vax 🤣😂🤣 It was a scam and you all fell for it.  You are pathetic lemmings so no wonder you are ruled by clowns.  The best part is that you will all do it again the next time the lever gets pulled 😂🤣😂 Pathetic.
We were told a zombie virus would take us out the minute we went outside. Why were they so relaxed about it all? Perhaps they new something we didn’t!
You're nothing jokes. Every single one of you. You're a disgrace to this country and can't begin to imagine how the families of who has lost loved ones along the way well you're an utter joke and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Pathetic and downright disgrace.
Who is the woman in the red dress, she’s 🔥. Reminds me of Prof Fergusons lockdown lover.
Son of b-s.
😮
While we were denied burying our dead, disgusting scum
Its not their fault you were all dumb enough to comply with absurdly stupid rules put in place. And you would do it all again!!
Absolute scum. Watched a grandparent pass away through the outside window of a nursing home as I wasn't allowed into the home during covid and these nonces get away with this
Should be charged and locked up like the privileged Elite Mps.
This dancing is the worse activity to have taken place in the entire history of Covid rule breaking. They should have been arrested by the MET for that alone, let alone the rule breaking.  How embarrassing
****ing b******s!!!!!
Please who really cares they all working together so there is no danger to others  If the labour and conservatives was to put the same energy into doing there job for the constituent we would be sinking in the uk today
Is this really a suprise ? we all know the tory party are all about themselves and not the british public.  Always have been and always will be. Whoever votes for them in next general election i despair , and need to wake up.
and as always, nothing will come of this. Us normal people would be thrown in prison and this lot get away with it all. I'm also calling it now...Boris did not have Covid... If he did then he did not have it serious. He just hid away to make it seem worse for him to fit the narrative
At this moment, the entire West is now became a joke. Absolute joke
Yet again no one asking the question why did they party .. it’s simple they knew it was all bolloxs and not this deadly plague msm news would Have people believe
Every single one should be prosecuted and locked up,pigs animal farm springs to mind.
to top it off they can't even dance...
Wtf is going on here,some of these people were honoured in the new years honours list,really what a load of bollox ,people were dying and relatives couldn’t see them at the hospitals ,just awful feel so sorry for the relatives and friends that couldn’t see there loved ones wile these burks were having a party shameful,well done Boris award the guilty people
It's high time these people were dealt with properly they need to be in fear to understand there are consequences in life. Just gonna say it these lot need a good beating a bit of fear installed back in them that if they think they are untouchable they will be brought back down to earth accordingly none of this investigation crap they never even get done with anything in the end anyway.
Looks like a scene from the office
Where was my invite
Lost family & friends and did not let them in because of their rules and these guys are breaking those rules. Cannot bring back all lost but let’s get justice for their unforgivable + unforgettable lies!
Can you believe the police didn't even fine them for this when ordinary people got £10K fines for much less (and yes the photo was extremely damning just by itself to anyone with functioning brain cells, this video removes all doubt)?  Also, Johnson and Sunak's £50 fines are an insult, that's like fining me 1p.
So when's the court date?
Fcuking disgrace
And these people govern us. We should govern them and kick them out of office. Remove his OBE . Dear Government do not try to enforce lockdowns on us again we will not obey. Saying we cant see loved ones cannot leave our area Nazi Government And I hold Boris Personally responsible for this latest rule  break party more will likely emerge they have contempt for the British people and the victims of Covid.
The country will vote them in again, nothing will happen.
Utter scumbags is the only words for these morons
Cheers 🎉  ( with best wishes from the conservatives )
Can we please just put them all down? They are all scum and have no right to be considered human.
They ignored their own regulations for a party!..... That party!?!?? 😑
Government needs a massive change. Throw all these stuck up politicians to the wolves on every council estate.
Why is everyone so surprised they’re politicians!!! All they care about is power and lining their own pockets!! WAKE THE FUCK UP! Slave minded NPC NATION!
Why aren’t we all doing something about this together?
This is ugly crying in party form
If you had half of a brain cell, you would realise that these people were all probably vaccinated and its only a rule for the British public as the majority of us cant be trusted to be honest about having covid or spouting all that mumbo jumbo about not getting vaccinated due to xyz reasons. I mean there were several arrests in my area alone due to small business owners like hairdressers and nail salon workers, doing it in their back gardens. Not to mention the idiots across the road from me that on 2 seperate weekends had a large party, which the police did nothing about when i phoned to get the arrested as it was 1am and they were screaming and drinking like muppets!
and people will continue to vote for these cunts...
Can someone let me know what important news this goofy subject is hiding ?
Ima be honest nobody cares
Shittest party ever anyway. Bellends can’t even do that properly
Despicable!
Looks a little fake, I'd like to see the time stamp if you will, if true they are all PIGS
Quite a range of studies now showing that social distancing and lockdowns did no good whatsoever.  So ironically the stupid rules that they are ignoring - should've been ignored all along.  I know plenty of people that still had small gatherings, e.g. we didn't want my niece to have no 16th birthday party.
Tossers  ...and they can't dance.
Why is the dancing so skittish? Genuinely makes it seem like a party in a mental asylum
Just a bunch of sausages sizzling
I lost my 17 year job because of covid.  I'm off to see a solicitor now.
Typical tory scum
We need to get rid of this poison in the parliament it is disgrace
The audacity of these absolute criminals! I've known people who were arrested by police and handed out fines for seeing their dying loved ones during lockdown. These are the real criminals!
As we can all clearly see this was an essential "gathering" strictly for work purposes. Now let's just MOVE ON, shall we?
Knobheads.
They all should be in prison
Neeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrds
Absolutely disgusting
Hope y'all got your vaccine 🤯🥳🤡
The Grassing Bxxxxxx who leaked the Video is as Guilty as Boris and should be outed and Punished too.
Sack them all with no pay off or nothing…our queen sat alone people couldn’t say good bye and these tossers take the piss like this.. honestly it’s a fucking joke under the magna carter which protects the people against this surly it’s time for us the people to say enough is enough we need a reform
Investigate labour parties too.
Sooner or later, these people will be jailed. It may take 10 year, or 20 years. But karma is real and it will catch up with them. If not in this life, they will burn in hell or be reborn as cockroaches. But there will be punishment.  It's not just about breaking their own rules. Their lockdown broke the economy.
I've renamed the Conservative Party to the Absolute C*nts Party.
At this time my Dad was on his deathbed couldn't see or speak to him just left a note and some fresh clothes. Bastards.
C*nts!
What a shit party 😂. Bet they played musical chairs. Money can't buy you taste.
Tory Values 🤣
Partygate
This lot make me sick to my stomach.  Then there is Sunak acting like he didn't know a thing...  Lies, lies, and more lies!!!
their laughs would have turned into horror now,
The real outrage shouldnt be they had a party,it should be that all political parties knew that covid was a big fat nothing burger. The question should be why did they impose all these tyrannical restrictions over 2 years,what is the end game.
Morons and buffoons just like their imbecilic blond leader.
These are the people who run my country ffs 🤦
"Yea Laura.. what do you think?"
Sack the lot of them. Out of touch with reality snobs laughing in our faces.
These people are a disgrace, why their not being charged i dont know. Its sickening to think that millions of people work hard all their lives and this lot are handed honors right left and centre. The tory party are absolutely  shockingly disgraceful,  surely another party will walk in at the next election. It makes me ashamed to be british. What a load of low lifes they all are.
Disgusting.... People couldn't even visit their dying loved ones in hospitals ... Pure shame!
I'm not surprised at all. Governments constantly break the rules, this one just happened to be filmed and shared. Imagine all the instances that were not filmed and shared.
Why bother imposing regulations that you don't even believe in? This shows how baseless and vacuous the Conservative government is. The more serious question is; "Why would anyone want to be ruled over by such moronity?" If, in a democracy, people get the government they deserve then the British have got to be some of the dumbest people on the planet.
I'm not shocked at all, it's been a long time since the Tories have had any principals.  I'm just amazed people keep voting them in and make excuses for them.  Some people justify it saying "All politicians are as bad as each other" funny how it's always the Tories that get this defence for one thing after another.
Boris has done such a good job in showing why the House of Lords she be abolished.
Rather have COVID than be at that party, looks absolutely shit ...
Vile tory c^nts!!
As long as we dont stream bending the rules!?!
Absolutely disgusting and why did Met police not even fine them. Also police on gates and policeman at door of No 10 didn’t report how many people were going in and with carrier bags of booze. The Met police once again not doing a proper job and allowed these idiots to get away with flouting Covid rules and so many innocent people dying. Shame on both Boris Johnson for all the lies he told and Met police for not doing their job properly. I have got to say Conservative Party are an absolute disgrace and thank goodness Met police don’t cover Lincolnshire where I live.
Typical entitled toffs.
This is silly... It's not organic, it's not natural. It's not reality
Don't you feel stupid for complying then don't you?   Karma is a bitch!
Bunch of satanic bastards!
Why is nobody asking the most important question here - which is 'why did they feel so unthreatened that they mingled like this while telling the public a deadly disease was on the loose'? The only logical answer is that they knew there was nothing to fear - THAT'S what you should be angry about, not the fact they are mingling, but that they had terrified 90%+ of the population into not doing so (to the point many never saw their relatives again) You can take it to the bank that if there was anything to fear those scumbags would be in bunkers
Is it? Are they? A video has been released but there’s nothing to confirm anything 🤔 Screaming a BS push but what the heck the sheep will believe anything these days, even that 💉 will stop you from dying instead of possibly causing their death.
Bunch of lying two faced gobshites.  Each and everyone of them should be fired,  fined and jailed.  Let’s see them laugh and joke about it then.
When in 2019 many of my colleagues (mainly Tories, highly educated well paid professionals) were enthusiastically voting for boris I was asking them why they were voting for a serial liar and a charlatan they all looked shocked and disappointed at my words.  3 years later, they’re all complaining, they’re all “shocked, “this is sickening “, “deplorable “ etc.  Where was your brain and common sense in 2019?  You got what you voted for stupid idiots
Tory twats
snobby tory cunts
'Lady in red, is dancing with me,  cheek to cheek.  She shouldn't be, illegal see.   They just won't know,   So why should we confide?   The public won't get,   The raves we have to hide...'     Labour 2024 Campaign Anthem.
Now do you see it was all bullshit. And we're still suffering with a stuffed economy. Just learn for the next one ffs..
Why are they not afraid of catching the virus in this video?  Why no fear?   They seem to know something the public did not.
Good luck trying to get the country to comply again like we did for lock downs.  Now we have seen all this I expect mass protests and riots if they try to mandate things like that.
Vile scum.
I partied like this 2020… while most of the sheep were grazing alone
How can they sleep at night. Name and shame!
It’s not even like they were flexing on most people, most people ignored the rules,  They are flexing on people who were oppressed which is pretty degenerate
Bunch of neeeks 🤮
Nightmare blunt rotation
Honestly, did anyone REALLY feel surprised by this footage?
this is why the guillotine was invented
Yes well what more can we expect from those who see themselves as upper class in their mindset they have more rights than the so-called lower classes ( in other words the working class and poor ) but at the end of the day they are nothing more than a bunch of ignorant self serving self righteous dimwits and that's why we in the north have so little respect for them .
I can tell you something if ever there is shit like this again nobody will follow the rules
cov-id 19 is the biggest scam of the century!
I wonder if the guy in the jumper copped off with the bird in the red dress? 🤔
It is just a happy work event, and no cocaine used.
'We all live in the world of The Absurd'!!
If you still believe in covid. Your a mug. And if you've had those shots (which not one of these people had) you're an even bigger mug. It's was a test. And all people proved is they don't need much telling to go out and put that shit in their system... Bahhhhhhh Bahhhhhhh Bahhhhhhh. Sheeple
Fair play to them.. I broke every single rule and did my own thing too.. if you followed the rules you are a clown. I didn’t even get vaxxed.. caught the virus and had like a year off work on full pay.. same again please it was a right laugh
Dancing Twats!
Hang on, is this Kate Joseph a labour official?
This is one of the many reasons Tories are hated.
This demonstrates two things:  1. These people have forgotten (assuming they ever knew in the first place) that they are the servants and WE are the masters.   2. These people knew full well that Covid was a serious threat to barely anyone other than the extreme elderly and extreme infirm of society.   For what they inflicted on their masters they should be punished.  And Labour is no better. They wanted to enforce even stricter measures than the Tories did.
All fines must be paid back in light of this absolute bullshit…this lot should all be fucking fired…but instead they are honored…as usual the rich deciding they are a cut above and the rules dont apply
Tory Scum
They're like rules for them and not for us smh
How is Boris to blame for this?  He wasn't there.  It's hardly likely that he even knew about it.
Member when Handcok was responsible for forcing COVID patients into care homes?  What ever happens to him?
This kills me to see. Sat at home like a "good girl " unknowingly I was wasting valuable time with my beautiful dad. By the time lockdown was lifted he was diagnosed with cancer and gone within weeks. Still the hospital wouldn't let me in to spend the last but of time I had with him. Ì will NEVER trust the word of our Government again! Next time they try to lock us in for our "own good" to "save our NHS" which is already a shit show the whole country needs to tell them where to go!
Total respect to them! I want to be a Conservative now and act like a complete self serving asshole! I want to feel the bloated sensation of being among the few who can break the rules that the cattle of Britain have to follow! I want privilege and to dally in Latin and dance the dance of death denial and the illite instep while the tax payer pays me! I’ll be fucked if I’d wear that jumper though!
I can see 2 white hobbits and just white privilege all around
Dont you worry Boris I also partied during lockdown you not alone. Shame you enforced masks for everyone when pfizer admitted they doing it ob purpose. But now they have different toy to play with ukranian propaganda making nazis innocent. Corrupters
How pathetic is this video? Shame on you
Turns out the people who work for a deplorable party are deplorable themselves. Who knew?
Perhaps talk about how they knew lockdown rules were unnecessary so ignored them but forced it everyone else? Labour would have been even harsher
It's all about obedience training as the new communist takeover starts to bite..make the people feel betrayed and helpless and crave strong leadership and solutions, which will come in the form of full digital totalitarianism and a new feudal elite.
How dear you break the rules
Disgusting display of contempt
You lot are incorrigible , why the moan moan sob sob !Boris Johnson is one of you ,he didn't arrive on planet earth from Planet X or isn't another bloody immigrant trying to impoverish Great Britain by invading  your bountiful island he is one of you lot very English, very white  ..Maistre must be laughing his skull off in his grave ,as I quote him :“Toute nation a le gouvernement qu’elle merite.” ("Every nation has the government it deserves.") .Just to rub it in to the thick skin of the Rosbif
This is sick who they think they are disgusting people
These dicks shits and the master clown himself are why our country is the shambles it is now. Thanks for that you f***ing w***ers!
The posh boys and girls don't need to bother with the rules.
You always get one dweeb at a work party bad dancing and trying it on with someone he works with. Embarrassing
So did Labour, the SNP and the Greens. They ALL did it.
just think at xmas covid time we were all stuck in doors kids went without that year.. and that was lockdown why these lot were having a party.. piss take i would say..
Liars all of them
thats it everyone, suck it up and get angry about it. lets all argue over a party over two years ago like we dont have any bigger problems to worry about.this is what we mean when we call you sheep.
Have and have not. . .the fearful sheep doing as they are told while the overlords dance on the graves of the dead. What a wonderful country !
Absolute bas#####
Remember that people had to die alone in fear or relatives couldnt comfort each other at funerals whilst piss heads at no.10 danced, drank and laughed whilst they were "bending the rules"
Should be a message of never vote Tories every again.
Yeah and the MSM like the Mirror were also supporting the narrative you bastards.
I think these people are absolutely disgusting they should’ve been sacked. I was losing my mum I’m sitting here crying all disgusting hypocrites never trust a government again in my life I just cannot believe how angry I feel
They stopped people from holding their dying mother's hand???  They stopped people from going to funerals???  Disgusting scumbags!
I visited my mum in a nursing home and had to talk to her through the window, she couldn’t understand what was going on, she died in August 2020 a week after her 92 birthday, just had to leave gifts and presents at the door. They made fools out of us.😡
Who's laughing now
this leaves me absolutely steaming....bunch of *********ers
It’s time to revolt people. Fight the corrupt system
they are a bunch of dishonest law breakers
after all this time these vids only come out now? does anyone want a straw to suck this up with? how about a pump to  just pump it in?
I cannot describe in words how angry I am that we were so fooled - to misquote G. W. Bush Jnr "fool me once shame on me, fool me repeatedly then you must be a Tory" -  trust these clowns with yhe NHS, you must be joking .... Tory politicians really will party while people die, then they'll dance on our graves - this video is the proof (with many more still to come) ...
Is it too much to ask that these low-life maggots are rounded up, put in a skip then the skip dumped in the North Sea?
Never ever ever again trust the tories or Labour, vote reform next election before its game over
This is what listening to your government does. And most of you fools have taken the vaccine tut tut
When i couldn't attend my Nan's funeral, this makes me hate the Government even more, pure chunts!
That's right  everyone was following the rules.... Uhuh
Vote the cunts out, what an actual disgrace for what reason did you do this? Just so you can sip on prosecco and nibbles from waitrose before sniffing coke in the toilets? Was it worth it? I want everyone who is seen to have attended to be fired and stripped of all mp privileges, never allowed to work in politics or law again
Don’t fall for the phoney Kosher propaganda.
Satanist
Why are people surprised?  You have been scammed. And its your fault. Bunch of idiots
If you followed the rules, you were stupid. Not these people partying. You should be mad at yourself for being duped.
toff pricks
I want to laugh at all the COVID Karen's right now
What a group of social misfits!
What no masks Ben Malice name change no I miss heard?
What the public HAD to endure, families torn apart having to know family members are dying and they cannot be with them, unable to help old and those in need. We then see videos like this.  Not only should every single person involved be stripped of job, title and fined severely, THEY should be imprisoned for a very, very long time. This is beyond a disgrace.  STAMP THIS OUT HARD, make them PAY. DO IT.
I did not comply to any of the madness. It does not hurt me to see them enjoy themselves.
Matt Hancock went on live TV laughing about it so I'm surprised anyone is shocked when they did it right to our faces
This is all the evidence you need to know that  1) the police failed to prosecute the first time rumours arose, given there clearly WAS evidence of rule breaking... 2) There is one rule for leaders & politicians, a different one for the rest of us... 3) What they thought of us (their comments show contempt for the public that they serve) & the rules they set for us while people suffered nationwide, people died, relatives sometimes did not get  to see/say goodbye to relatives, people died alone, some people did not even get to go to their relatives' funerals to say nothing or those that suffered depression & those who committed suicide during lockdown because of their loneliness & the social distancing rules that these people in this video were gleegully breaking themselves...  I wonder what things we never got to see because no one recorded it?  Aside from these serious points, it does look like a bad scene from 'The Office' where staff are having a party, and it looks like they all got dressed by their mothers, apparently...😂 So another lesson learnt, never, ever take fashion advice from a young Tory...😏
This is why Animal Farm needs to be taught at GCSE in schools. "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." If BJ and his sidekicks aren't the embodiment of Napoleon and his pigs respectively, then I'm Jesus and can walk on water.
For decades, I have maintained this belief: We, the people, are ultimately governed by the leaders we deserve. If we truly deserved better, we would refuse to tolerate the current state of affairs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Let's have a big booze up when this toxic tory lot all get put infront of a judge to sent to prison!
Torys are suck
Haha this doesn't surprise us in the least the Arrogance of the Tory party will be it's downfall at the next election. These morons set the Rules and Broke all of them during lockdown. God help us all🫣🤣
Everyone of these should be fired or forced to resign, bunch of posh twats taking the piss
That right-wing soy boy desparately simping is the most nauseating thing about this whole video.
Completely taking the piss Tory rabble
Wankers
The House of Lords needs to be gone.
They should be arrested by the Terrible Dancing alone 😳
Don’t be mad that they did this, be mad that you listened blindly.
This is what happens when you vote Tory nonces in
The sooner we realise politians are upper class privilaged toffs with money that put on a fake show in public the better.
Clowns 🤡
I bet most of the people moaning about this are the same people that took advice from these criminals without even questioning any of it. If that's the case then you have no right to moan, if you think these criminals do the jobs they do because they care then you are either gullible,stupid or ignorant, probably all three.  If you vote in elections then your just as complicit as the criminals you vote in. Reap what you sow.
With hindsight and knowing what we now know about the vrus, the vaccine, lockdowns and masks they are doing the right thing. Shame the scientists didn't tell everyone else the truth
People don't seem to understand the Rules set for us by these people , especially conservative middle classes , Rules are only eve broken if you get caught , the only way to success is to break and bend rules , the deal is are you smart enough to avoid being caught ., nobody should have listened to the rules there was a section of society that the prudent rule lovers followed and it ended in tragedy sadley for some but you was told by thousands of what now can be considered heroic people as they risked fines and prosecution and being placed in custody for their freedom  , while the rest of the country, poured scorn and disdain upon them and allowed these hideous politicians to steal your freedom. i hope you all look at this video and remember in the future  that you being obedient to these wretches is the problem with them , because they know they can get away with it because your so servile and obsequent to them .why wouldn't  they be like this video there's no real risk of punishment is there  ?    you see if more  people were willing to break their rules for us , then then have to behave in a fitting manner because rule breakers are dangerous . so im afraid that the british public are responsible for creating these politicians . if there's no come back no danger they will do this , its human nature .
Scumbags
A purge needs to occur in British Government.
It’s all so disgusting when starmer was having a booze up to . The whole of parliament needs to be closed down.
It’s not just Boris it’s the entire party looking down on us and laughing
They don’t seem at all worried about covid 🤔
Ha ha you are literally watching actors playing a role 😂😂😂😂😂
People died, old and young vulnerable people who lived alone were left isolated. I could go on, no masks here. I feel sick to my stomach watching this. The whole conservative parry should be removed from office.
Absolute disgrace! They should be banned and all do community service!
What i find most disturbing is how dumb these people are !,  they are possibly our future government figures, Wow who films themselves breaking the law (morons) . Who snitched?
The bottom of the barrel.
But they told u it was invisible,and now telling u its u that need to pay for staying at home for three years.
Sack the lot of them, utter disgrace, while the country suffered they party. I`d love to meet them face to face !!!
Fed up with the tories
Typical
Bunch of wankers looking even more stupid than normal . Good luck with your careers after this guys. Has there ever been a bigger free hit for labour than this year ? You could put a pigeon in a suit and still win the next election based on this constant lingering shit show that the tories are putting on .
These sort of idiots run our country
Looks staged
Guarantee more than just alcohol for some.
Tories being Tories.
Just call a general election. If this was a boxing match, the corner would’ve thrown in the towel by now the Tory party may as well, just pull the Band-Aid off, give themselves more time to try and win the one after that it’s just embarrassing
Loads of people moaning about how they did as they were told and stayed at home and are now disgusted by the government making them look like a mug. What dod you expect? I didnt listen to any of the lockdown bullshit to start with. Got about my day as i always have done and i didnt care as i knew it was all a charade and ot was just a form of control. People should have never listened
Yeah keep voting for these trashes. One of them needs to be choked out for sending a message.
Just proves the government don’t care about anyone but themselves as long as we don’t stream it and yet they did load of plonkers
A British lying? I can't believe it....
I've so much more respect for them now 😂
Forgive and forget? No, hold to account, sack & remember
Mate. Lets just say it. Why is it all Tories doing it? Entitled t*ats
This looks and sounds fake as fk
They need jail time .. people suffer with mental health and lost love ones whilst they party and laugh .. shameful
My father was in a hospital suffering delusions in his last days with pneumonia in a hallway texting me that they left him without a blanket freezing and he didn’t know what was happening. Wow just wow. I miss my dad so much as I still picture him there alone and wish I could have been with him. I’ve never wanted to punch through a screen before so bad. Last time I felt this little responsibility I was a child - They are no more than that running a country.
Wankers the lot of them
Chinless WANKERS.
Biggest scam in human history.
They broke lockdown rules because they knew the whole thing was a fraud, you really think if it was so deadly they would be partying?.
A country which tries to tell rest of the world on morality , righteousness , fairplay , rule of law , equality and democracy falls very short of standards it tries to codify , it then becomes the laughing stock of the world as nobody  takes it seriously, but it still insists being called GB because Sir Rees -Mogg said so.The English have a very unhealthy relationship with their past it goes back to their issues with shame.The English are deeply ashamed of not being who they used to be .
Whilst the rest of us were fined and branded .
These people Disgust me especially when I wasn't able to go to a hospital to see my dying partner or even go to say goodbye at the chapel of rest. These people should be strung up!!!
Absolutely unbelievable they just don't care they should all be fined even now
plebs
There were no parties....I never lied! It’s all a stitch up!
My dad had died in April 2020 due to covid and in the same year my dads father couldnt take it anymore that my dad his oldest son died and he died of heart attack because of the pain , I wasnt allowed to see my dad in the hospital and yet things like this ...really make me angry the fact that they are the people who made these rules and there were people who broke them got fined but yet those in power broke the rules already from the get and go..is painful ,it makes angry and its sickening they should all be punished heavily regardless
When is labour getting done for this?
Oh give over!...show some respect for conservative party officials..The rules were there for the many, and rightly so..These folk were in a bubble..so they did no wrong
What a terrible party. Looks like a scene out of The Office.
Bunch of crooks...
So many people couldn’t see their loved ones…so many people couldn’t attend funerals….so many people had to follow these useless restrictions…all for you to be partying away without a care in the world. Scums of the earth. Fuck you all…I hope you all return to the pits of hell from which you were born.
Fucking little pricks... I couldn't see my mate who is in hospital with covid and he passed away over Christmas, and look at these bastards doing what they're doing, shame on all of them
Not defending. Bur just like most houses in my area. No-one cared unless they knew someone ill with covid. To this day I have not met anyone who was ill from it. That is about 3000 so far and all they knew too. Adds up to average 3 million who knew no-one with the illness. Rarer than being run over by a Robin reliant
Trouble is Labour are even bigger scumbags then the Tories it’s madness 😡
Are those dancers on 10 boosters?😂
This is probably a bit medieval, but I firmly believe that everyone in the video should be publicly flogged !
This country is falling to rack and ruin thanks to clowns like these.
Wake up England.
There never was a real threat to health and they want you to forget the “take it for others “ when now we know don’t we it didn’t stop transmission .
I think the cameraman was a plant
What a ridiculously terrible looking party
Small businesses were forced to shut down their doors, Families were pushed into poverty. And these creatures were enjoying drinks & party - Such a shame 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sheeple following these muppets rules got us in this mess.
Dodger tories
Bastards partying while my mum was dying in hospital of covid disgusting
Just pure Tory scum.
Fcuk the tories !!!
Dirty lylng bastards torrie are all of the same cloth they did not care people were dying and not seeing love ones. Whatever happens to the tories now they deserve it let's hope another goverment pays them back.
Fucking imbeciles
I could not visit my beautiful sister in hospital, before she sadly passed away from catching Covid. This video shows the heartless contempt of these smug, spoilt, privilege Tory snobs, who metaphorically, were spitting in the faces of us who lost loved ones and those who suffered and found it tough, but still obeyed the rules. Shame on them all for their callous contempt and lack of humility.
🤢🤮
Exclusive 😂😂 these videos was on telegram days ago,main stream media still playing catch up
Prob none will loose job or benefits though
As a funeral director, this is lower than low, if they had lost someone they would understand how disgusting this is, love to all families who have lost someone and will never get over the magnitude of the effects COVID had on them and their loved ones.
What party does the sun back? Blind leading the blind. Anyone heard of Rupert Murdoch?
Like its a suprise??? More bull than Texas them lot!!!!😂
Bastards
cleanse it with fire
These political leaders never say anything true. Blair, Bush, Brown, Obama, Johnson, Biden, Trump, Truss to name a few. None of them ever get held accountable. None are ever sorry for their crimes, their blunders.
So Fuvking fake
They all should serve life in prison
Arrogant, entitled and spitting on the public who had all their Christmases cancelled. Shame on them.
Fucking wankers
This is what all "our leaders" did around the world.
They are all bastards , selfish entitled bastards . That’s the real face of the conservatives . Like Nero they fiddle whilst  Rome burns . My great uncle died alone in a care home . He’d loved for 95 years and he was sent home from hospital infected . He inadvertently infected other old people. Many  died because of this governments policies and he was ten times the man these scumbags are . If you excuse this by voting for that party again then you’re no better . I’ll never forget what they did .
My eyes cannot unsee that dancing.
Sucking dancers
They all look like the typical tory as well 😂
One rule for one, one for another. & folk continue to vote for them. Pure scum 🤬
You will always find them in the kitchen at parties
Shameless, the most concerning thing is that we promote these people to this position.
My fucking grandad died and I couldn’t go to his funeral or even see him leading up to the days. Yet these pisspots think it’s funny to break the same rules I would have been shunned if I done so.
Dont you dare all moan now its over,  90% of you were the ones following all the rules and looking down at those that knew exactly what they were  doing at woudnt be manipulated like a little zombie, i bet youve all got your jabs and stood behind the glass watching granny and grandads final moments alone because you was told too
This is whats caused to outrage and not the Tories tearing apart the NHS as we all knew they would???
I am shocked at anyone who ever believed that the same rules on anything applies to everyone including the rule makers. How naive. I am sure that senior staff in the Newspapers in their innocence didn't think it applied to them either but held these films and many more back to maximize impact.
I feel sorry for the people who took the bait hook line and sinker and fell full force for the tyranny the government gave out. I for 1 didn't and simply went about my normal day to day activities. Seen loved Ones.and knew this would happen! And as a pure blood I Also resisted the juice jabber !!
This motley crew should go and hide under the nearest  rock and never show their faces again in public.  Scum!
LOOK .... IF your Tory there is nothing wrong with this at all and if your labour its wrong !!!!! but if was labour doing this its wrong and your Tory ,,, ... its plain and simple ... have to remember if you had of been drinking BEER doing this LABOUR would of said it was fine ...
Jail these cnts 👊🤬👊
Sweaty limp wristed Conservatives if there was a world war they would be in their secret bunker partying
Being a dementia care worker through the pandemic seeing all the patients families unable to hold them, not being able to be by their families side as they die. The pain and struggle it was to work there and see these things, whilst not being able to see my own family whilst these idiots are here drinking and dancing with eachother laughing at the fact they’re breaking the rules is absolutely despicable. All you did was clap for us lol.
Enough is Enough People, There Must be call For General Election or Re-Join The EU Now, There just Taken the P*ss now and at our Expense.210.000 died 10 million on UC and they Continue to Gas light us. This why Scotland will Be Free To Join The EU, They are Not Our Master's.
An absolute disgrace
All the politicians were doing. Local politicians were having large family get togethers while people got handcuffed for not wearing a mask
What is the collective noun for a group of useless, egotistical thugs ? Perhaps “Political party” would be a good suggestion….
Everyone a shite head. This will haunt them for ever.
Tories scumbags
If this doesn’t tell everyone that there was NO danger at all. I don’t know what will. And yes that IS the most important aspect of all of this because the lie itself allowed them to set rules that impacted how people died, rules that tore families apart, rules that governed everyone’s freedom of speech and movement.   The fact that the fines they received were a small punishment is not the point.  They should not be financially punished because the fines issued under the guise of covid should not have been an option in the first place.   If they have to pay their £50 fine then that student who had a party has to pay their £1400 fine.   The fine as punishment doesn’t address the total corruption of political office enforcing total and absolute control over a nation by deception.
Arsholes the lot of them
The utter contempt the political class have telling the whole country Lockdown, no mass gatherings, no holding parties or you'll be fined, can't see your dying family members. While they were bending the rules mass gatherings and holding parties. And Labour would have Locked down even harder. Keir Starmer also had a party.
Wake up ffs  Old news mate.  You know our government has practically handed over all our power to the WHO ?  Opt out of WHO dictatorship!!!
Well for all of you that still believe in the system, good luck to you as this is the smallest of criminal acts your government commits against you on both sides of the political spectrum .
So .. where is Boris in this party ?
I couldn’t go to a family funeral and wasn’t allowed out of wales. It’s discussing absolutely horrendous that none of them have been done for this. What you expect one rule for them and one rule for us. I won’t ever vote ever again for any of the corrupt lot 😡
Their is always different rules for tories. It's the reason I would never vote Conservative. They're the leeches over society and always have been
I dont no what was worse theire behaviour or the dancing.. Muppets
Disgusting cretins.
Two lads fined £10.000 each for a snowball fight , these smug bastards should be fined twice as much and sacked
This is what the government is all about they don't live by the system so why should we its all about control and they can do what they like and get away with it
Lockdown guidlines ... never was a rule for anyone .. sheeeeeep
These people should never hold office again they are FILTH
This is really twisting the knife in disgusting.
You can't blame them they sharing some of the profits from the face mask contract consultants fees 10 billion for a single repeat contract from china. If you share 10 billion you is dancing you is drinking you is fornicating you is going to hell.
On this day a further 232 deaths were recorded owing to COVID-19; I hope these people are criminalised!
🙏 🪦  all
And that why we need a completely new election party for the people . All these posh stuck up wa*kers will never change !!!!!!
They were practicing herd immunity
The worst people in the country vote Tory.  They don't even agree that this was wrong. Lamp posts are too good for them, but the day is coming.
Nobody in this comment section even remotely broke any rules.
I feel sorry for those that stayed at home and decided to not see the friends and family when they are dieing. Talk about prioritys. So much virtue signaling in these posts. Get a grip hardly anyone stayed home. Buch of liars.
It was all a lie. From the vaccination programs to all the lockdowns. A socail experiment to see who would fall into line. I hope those of you who did comply have woken up.
"It's all just a work event" they'll say. Fuck these self-entitled bastards. I hope the lot of them never get in Parliament again.
Once again the cesspool Tories demonstrate utter contempt for the British people. Pull my string "stop the boats" little fishy Rishi and his rat pack government are finished. Not my PM.
Bloody idiots. All this when no one.  NO ONE. Could visit dying loved ones in hospitals with covid.  This is utterly disgusting.
Personally dont know a single person that stuck to the rules and the larties we  had during lockdown were positively epic
Crooks
This country is screwed…
These are the people who lecture us not to listen to experts and there are those who foolishly listen to them
Fucking bastards
yet… people will vote for them again…and again
Tory oiks at their worst
I feel dead inside seeing this.
fucking scumbags and we could not even go to funerals. sack the lot of them
If only they could have had this attitude towards all the globalist and the elites telling us what to do from their private jets and islands. We're an island with our own government we'll deside whats best for our folk. But their just spineless demon's captivated by shinny sparkly trinkets. With utter contempt for their community.
sack the lot ...  its full of rotten apples ....and we are paying this lot of scum ....clear the swamp.....do not vote for scume
I broke lockdown every single day, I’m proud of it too. Come at me
Makes you wonder where they get the videos from and why all of a sudden are they willing to show it? Why not 2 years ago when it happened? Must be pay day for someone….
I can tell you what I think of it… 🤬😡🤬😡
This is a fabricated distraction, don’t look into it too much.
Sunak really has his hands full, doesn't he? I smell a GE around the corner...
....or they knew the Covid restrictions were not intended for the purpose they were crafted and carried on as normal because, for all intents and purposes, life was 'normal' for those who were privy to the facts.  Food for thought.
The video that lost them the election
Tory scum
Everyone saying "I couldn't see my family or do this & that during lock down" I think more fool you for listening to these corrupt inept useless politicians...I did whatever I wanted during lockdown because I knew it was a load of bollocks and that these toffee cunts were doing whatever they pleased too.. moral of the story stop begging to be ruled and controlled by government and just do what's best for you and your family
Target everyone in the video with home visits Time to take the country back Boris sleaze Johnston Jail him
And they lectured us and threatened us to stay in doors all while there partying they're supposed to represent this country the whole party is a disgrace also taking are rights away making illegal to protest and criticising the government in the future will see you branded as an extreamist and will get a visit from Prevent its all been widely reported in different news articles
And these are the people want to listen to all governments are the same crooked and don’t care about the public but don’t worry us normal citizens will be fined stupid amounts of money to see loved ones and family memeber who are close to dying and get major punishments for so and they get to do what ever they want us British citizens need to act on this
For those below who was duped into this nonsense, let this be a lesson that no one should ever come between you and your family EVER !.
most embarrassing part is that dancing ooft
While people's family's out there dying when covid was at its peak there drinking and laughing it up..sooner or later every fucker on this earth needs to stand up together..enough is enough
Corrupt lying tories!
Sick! Corruption
I hope everyone remembers this the next time they try to illegally take our freedoms away under the guise of it being for the 'greater good' or 'social benefit', 'protecting the vulnerable'! Never allow this to happen again. Bastards.
These are the people we are supposed to belive have our best intrests at heart? Any one else had enough of this system that only helps the rich people?
So have they all been investigated and fined ??
Even the Queen sat alone in her mourning and yet the rule makers were breaking them and making people suffer as they partied.
Could you imagine if we have another pandemic and it goes to another lockdown? People will look back on this and shove two fingers up at the lockdown. We're in for a disaster
Wow 😂 English people are easy to control next I heard that they want to stop protests
This makes me feel ill
Just look at these clowns… what a embarrassment
Ladies and gentlemen truly asked yourselves if this thing was what they said it was these sorts of people would be the first ones to not leave their homes with fear of dying, one of the greatest con job went down and all of us were mugged off plain and simple these are the people that have access to the real truth and if they are cuddling up together like this with no care in the world shows you there was no virus to fear made fools of you and send you to take your millions of vaccines and God only knows what impacts it will have years to come an your health
My problem isn't with what they are doing in the video, I did exactly the same things during "restrictions" - I carried on as normal as I could. I'm angry that they have the cheek to think they can tell me who I can't and can't hug but having flagrant disregard for their own damn rules
They didn't realise it was a party
I feel sorry for those that couldnt see that absoloutley everything they went along with was bs . And all those who wete called conspiracey theorists were right (as usual ) .
Beware of these types of people they look harmless and sound important with  their ive been to university voices. We are  being lead by school prefects.
The ones that make the laws never follow them is anyone sursprised?
And there’s idiots that will still support and vote for these cons
They clearly understood that the ‘rules’ were total nonsense, not based on scientific evidence, just the members of SAGE playing with society, drunk on power. Imagine having the power to totally control the lives of 60 million people!!
Tories and Labour, 2 cheeks of the same arse.
What a bunch of wankers
Utter WANKERS, they fiddled while " Rome " Burned !
Get the filthy pigs out on our next vote
Totally and completely unforgivable behaviour whilst they had us all locked down. NOW ITS TIME TO PAY THE PRICE.
Bunch of posh little toffs when this country falls and the people stand up these type of People will be under there mums arm in bed sobbin how scared they are ..everyone of there time is coming and will come..then let’s see if they still find it funny
Tory scum
Torys Brain Ltd
Wankers all of them . Labour conservatives. All of them . Any one who thinks the get to tell others how too live and what it should cost them is a peace of shit
England : middle-age country ruled by the richs
Clearly a work event, who doesn't dance at work?  Also kinda ridiculous that you can get a peerage just for failing to become the mayor.
I think they should all get a fine
Total Bollocks !
The same people whose government imposed restrictions that meant businesses could not function properly. Unforgivable. Bunch of scumbags
And yet we sit and follow their rules. Way to go human race
I want my money back for all tests when travelling
I live in Ontario Canada. Our crime minister left Quebec and visited family in Ontario during Easter whilst lecturing us on social distancing. These double standards are engaging.
Missed my aunt’s funeral while these fuckers partied
I was fined £100 just going grocery shopping with my mate and we took safety precautions very strictly and then got told off by the feds 🤬😤
The aggressively bad dancing is one of the most annoying visuals from this video. It’s like watching two coked up squirrels mating on a waxed floor. No sense of rhythm or grace. It’s almost as if they’re dancing out of spite.
ITS A DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR WHILE ALL THE BRITISH NATION FAMILYS SUFFRING WERE SUFFERING
And this is why I never "obeyed" the ridiculous and pointless lockdown regulations.
🤣
I was fined £200 for being out doors the day i was relised from prison and these fuckers where doing thsi shit nah i gey a fine again im pitting downing street as my address fucking pm can pay it
This people are politicians? Omg
Scummy fuckers. If this doesn’t show that we need a change of leadership then what does? December 2020 was when no one could go visit their loved ones or friends over Christmas, but these fools can throw a party because they are “in charge”? Absolute scum bags.
I would ve never let me not see my loved ones when they were dying. No rules or doctors could ve stopped me to hold their hands
So no tory mp's there....what a waste of time
To those who continue to vote for these wretches, shame on you!
And yet, come election time, people will still vote for these and labour and nothing will change.  If you are disgusted by the behaviour of these scum, do NOT vote for the main 2 parties, or the lib dems because you will only get more of the same. Stop electing idiots.
Are they dancing or is this a new professional wrestling company coming to the scene soon?
Bunch of c*nts the lot of them.
I feel sorry for the sheeple what belived this rubbish then had the audacity to call people with open minds conspiracy theorists well we all know what this was about and we know it was not a virus
Arrogance that only the entitled selrfservatives could think acceptable. A party full of people that think it's ok as long as no one finds out. Pretty sure that's the same stance taken by most criminals?
Mail newspaper just given Boris a position working for them  . I'd like to see the entire national boycott the Mail newspaper and any other organisations / business that gives Boris employment . Unite together to rid the people of the UK of Boris presence .
Yes they are all uppity liars, tell us something not known
Tory voters should wear this as a badge of honor and will always be reminded who there party is.
Hypocrisy at its best. While we were told to isolate these clowns 🤡 were partying
Hands up if you're bored with this nonsense
All this is still happening Tore corruption
Disguting
What will surprise me is if any action of an kind is taken.
Those who got OBE during tory time should be reconsidered.  Its a shame that this country also becoming like Asian countries, where the RULES are only applicable to the Poor and Weak not to Politicians.
😡😈😡😈😡😈😡😈⚔️
lying scheming rats, and we allow these bastards to decide what happens in our country?
Minimum prisonment please, they actually took the piss , these resignation is not enough... Unbelievable and people still defends these clowns
Only fools would accept another lockdown. The types you see still wearing facemasks
It doesn’t matter who you vote for, but how can anyone think Boris was a brilliant Prime Minister after all this. He’s a disgrace to his country as are the ones who stand by him. His honours list should be terminated except for the ordinary people who deserve them. He’ll be forever known as the lying leader of the Conservative Party and U.K.
Horrible Tory scumbags
Those two dancing are definitely in relationships and definitely not being faithful.
If you're going to have a party, make it a good one. This looks like a shite time with a bunch of utter trollops. Fuckin idiots. I had to stay locked up with my great dad and his mad family. For months!
Ugh! Tory boy in the brasses look's like he has escaped the 1980's
Out of curiosity, does anyone know where this video came from ? is it from Boris's whatsapp messages ? or was this part of the evidence they already had ?
Only the most cold blooded, entitled, narcissistic socio/psychopaths could dance, party, laugh, floric like this and at the same time force the rest of us to stop celebrating our children's birthdays, weddings and most cruelly of all, to isolate our elderly, sick and dying at a time when they needed our company, love, hugs and kisses more than ever! These vile smiling assasins all need to be prosecuted for breaking their own laws and imprisoned. How the country isn't in complete uproar demanding justice shows how pathetic we are.
They’re not evening “bending” the rules (not even rules, laws), they’re straight up breaking them.  Someone may as well take a gun to this lot, they’re no longer human as they’ve clearly lost all sense of humanity so I doubt someone would get charged for murder. They’d probably be seen as a hero to some.
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU AEE OBEDIENT AND BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE SCAMMERS TELL YOU 100%  LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT LOCKDOWNS AND 15 MINUTE CASHLESS TOTALITARIAN FUTURE THEY ARE PLANNING FOR YOU 🐑 😊
I wasn't able to put to rest my grandad but those fuckers were partying?!? Hope they take a long walk off a short cliff
If this is not the end of them than I truly don’t know what will be … has anyone got Mr Fawkes email or mobile?
This country will always be fucked and down in the gutter!
Difficult to make out what was being said. It sounded mostly like:"Ahohee haw ho hohhe haw." The fat woman in red and the fat bloke in the criminal jumper also seemed to struggle making out (one fewer Tim Nasty And Dim running about hopefully)
Six-toed born-to-rule pony fuckers
While I'm not surprised, they're absolute C❗U❗N❗T❗S❗all the same. 🖕
What absolute moron would decide to record an illegal party? lmao. The footage would have always got leaked eventually. Idiots
Gb news and his cronies are justifying, defending  charlatan bojo sycophants  party gates and his lordships  holders 🤨
Thats 1 shit party, pun intended 🤫
And people really think these people care about us 😂😂😂 clown shit but also the papers are only showing us this to try be down with the people but they lie and hide shit too 😂 can’t trust none of them
Just goes to show the whole thing was a sham. If it was that bad, the people the most in the know wouldn't have dared do this. I'm glad I stuck to my guns and gave those covid rules and the jabs the finger.
Convid
Little wonder the public despise politicians.
Reptiles
It's like a scene from the thick of it and if you still support this group of Tory weridos then there is something seriously wrong with you
An independent report into a labour council boss who attended a leaving drinks party during lockdown is to be considered in private. Kate Josephs, chief executive of Sheffield City Council, attended the Cabinet Office event during a previous Whitehall role. A cross-party council committee later appointed an external investigator to look into into Ms Josephs' actions.
Only 1 word for this treason ...Guillotine...
Once the masses realise these so called Politicians are making it up as they go along! there will be No Hiding place!
Why am I not surprised?
Truely sickening. The last 2 years of medical school were horrifically disrupted because of these BS rules. When I did go to placement I’d literally see dying and demented patients having the presence of their families refused because of these rules. They were offered IPADS instead. What a fucking farce. This country has gone to the dogs. The sooner I leave the better.
This is just wrong, "do as we say, not as we do", looks like no matter what country you are in, you are still ruled by hypocrites.
Sickening. Degenerate subhuman scum.
I knew from the beginning of the plandemic it was just bullsh*t and all about control.
December 2020🤔 yet we’ve all known about this for 3years🙄 What a piss take of us all🤦🏽‍♂️
And charlatans bojo wants £115,000 free money each year? Seriously?????
The two dancing need a personality transplant and shame on the people watching for not saying ‘what the fuck are you two doing?’
Remember that the lockdown destroyed the economy. It isn't just about conservatives disobeying their own rules. Their rules broke the economy. All of them need to be jailed. If the oppossition does not advocate jailing them, I will not vote.
I had covid that time, sick with a chest infection in my room alone. My 76 year old mother slipped in the kitchen hitting her head and back and i was bedbound, i could not help her. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUTING BEHAVIOUR FROM THE TORIES.
I dont even care. You people who want to cry about this should know that A. It's your own fault for buying into project fear, and B. All this actually shows is that the people who were telling you to be afraid knew that it was all unnecessary and silly.
If don't laugh I'll cry 😭 😂😂😂😂😂😂 the cheek!!! The damn audacity!!!!
FFS! Anyone with any sense knew these rules were ridiculous and made no difference what so ever. There were hundreds of thousands if not millions of people up and down the country had “illegal” gatherings. Some of us even drove hundreds of miles and met up with people outside of work in a non work venue to have drinks and a curry. Even though the rule of six was in effect.  As we know now on hindsight these rules around social gatherings where never law; only guidance portrayed as law.
The December lockdown was imposed because of a lack of hospital beds. These pricks risked 20 of them getting Covid for a really shit party.  The man laughing because of them ‘bending’ the rules is a perfect indication of their attitudes
We couldn't even say a final goodbye to my Grandad on his deathbed or hold a funeral while these clowns were partying and breaking the rules that they put in place.
Like now all of a sudden, now that's it's all been said and done and the damage along with it, now!.. now we have footage, emails, stats, and proof in general that all this was just a load of 💩. Like the Epstein stuff too. We are all fools.
Look at these normies
We knew this years ago. Can we just cut to the punishment?
who cares? Any smart people didnt follow the bs rules anyway, only the sheep who listen to every instruction did that
And that’s way the Tory’s are really hated now
What is the point of showing them?? I don't get it honestly, like something will happen to them. Another video that is all, get use to the idea of seeing those sort of videos regularly. NOTHING WILL HAPPEN- PERIOD!!! It has always been and always will be. Instead of them being jailed for serious amount of years,  you just sit down and watch and comment🤮 The saddest part is that they know it and probably still laughing even now while we are all sitting down and just writing  useless comments.
Conservatieve didn't want a lockdown. That was the left.
The guys who brought you Brexit and killed your economy. Well done!
The Tory Party needs flushing down the toilet!
What’s that? Dirty dancing remastered?
I’m one of the few that didn’t find lockdown difficult, I actually enjoyed as I’m a loner anyway & prefer my own company but what makes me angry is that my dad had a heart attack during the lockdown & nobody was allowed in the ambulance. As per usual it’s one rule for them & another for us. Bastards.
Boycott government simple . How by? Well for starters be self dependent.  Hows that done ? Use your dam brain people . They gonna replace warehouse workers soon with AI so good luck
Absolute disgrace, they should all be jailed
Anyone who lets someone take a video of you while partying when it's illegal to is  not worthy to be anywhere near a responsible and lawful job. These people feel they're above the law because they think they are too privileged who don't give a damn about anything but their careers, pay packets and how to get up the ladder of success. I have to pay for them. I'd sack them and take away any awards. All of them. Fed up with them. So angry.
But despite of all this we must understand that the conservative party is the only party capable of making Britain great again.
It's time the people ran the country. These monkeys will all be in jail. No more governments, no more dictator's, no more wef. We take our country back and send everyone back to there own countries to do the same.
Any pictures of Starmers Beer and Curry party ?
Britian behind the scenes hide alot .. dangerous
*REMEMBER - IF THEY WERE DECENT HUMAN BEINGS* they would not be Tories
And everyone else wasn’t allowed to visit dying parents and grandparents.
Give them all a 5 year prison sentence and an extra 2 for the two numpties dancing in the background.
So covid was indeed a massive scam, and we are really seen as sheeple peasants.   If this doesn't prove it nothing else ever will, wake up people!
woah, now that’s what i call a party 🤦🏽‍♂️  are you all really so annoyed about them having their upper class jollies ? or deep down & truly, is the anger with yourself & your embarrassingly weak compliance with such an easily identified scam ? you didn’t follow the science’, you followed the TV.
All pissed up what an outfit
people will still vote the tories anyways
The head of the Police should be charged not taking actions based on the evidence. Bloody fat liar Boris and g his cabinet should be out if politics for life!!!
Only one word W**kers
Who gives a fuck. Honestly. Wish I could keep this non news of my feed but always gets through.  Sensible people didn't care about covid, and they don't care about who did what in lockdowns.
Idiots and Fools!!
Who the hell is that mumbling the dialogue - and the proof of when that was taken is ???????
The fact that no one in the room had the brains to say stop filming and delete that video now shows that the country is run by idiots
Oh do you really need this to open your eyes? You are all shocked now? Like if it was not clear from the beginning that it was a scam, but back then everyone was obeying a clown and his puppets and locked themselves into their houses 😂 Ridiculous
Who puts clowns in power? Blame them too as well as these animals! They think they are above the law, put them behind bars and set an example!
What a bunch of horrid cretins
My neighbours did exactly the same thing at Christmas 2020 with a housefull of family over which ended up with a pissed up argument in the street. Meanwhile people were watching their loved ones pass via facetime. Trailer trash.
Just proves lockdown was complete bullshit lol
Slimey slugs....
Everyone in this comment section is apparently tired because whenever anyone says anything it’s immediately replied to with “wake up”
I laughed too, I got on with my life just as normal during lockdown… worked every weekday visited my family, I never once limited myself because of stupid rules… didn’t even get vaccinated and I’m still here feeling good 🙂
Conservatives really are low brow tasteless arseholes.
Revoke their honours !!
Silly 🐑. You were shocked at us when we said it was all bullshit. You called us conspiracy theorists and here you have government aides who will have known just how “dangerous” convid was taking the piss out of you!!!
Because lockdown is for plebs but people are fucking stupid and they belive everything they say in tv and then they will call you are  not responsible person because you dont wear mask in shop 😂😂😂😂😂 and who wear mask now? I never taken that vaccine and will not take ever. Best is the fact covid finished just day after day and them older stupid ppl dont see nothing suspicious about it
What I find most disgusting is the way they act. The men in this video are not men. They are spineless little posh wimps. Any man could walk in there and punch one of them in the mouth and they would all start to cry! Look at that little weasel dancing in the background it's actually like a like a comedy sketch. Well you lot voted them in. I certainly never.
Next time they try and pull another lockdown {six weeks to flatten the curve} just remember this and tell them to stuff it!
lmao and I couldn't even see my family idk if I should laugh or cry
They've turned our beloved Europe into a third world ghetto. Caring more about unvetted illegal migrants who've commited heinous murderous crimes against our own peoples. Letting in psychopaths and war criminals . Rip Nottingham victims and all those women raped and killed . Totenlichter 💀
Everyone in this video needs to be fired and not allowed to be in politics ever again.
Anyone under 65 wearing braces is by definition a twat and WTF is that guy “dancing” doing spinning that girl around so much? Is his goal to get her so dizzy she might sleep with him?
Nobody should be persecuted for enjoying their freedoms, rule-writer or not. People seem to forget that the government was forced to make the rules by them.
No Respect, No Responsibility, No Human Care. These are the people looking after us. It’s messed up!
i new that lock down would be a waste of time and would not be followed by the leader's . if people where to look deeper i bet you would find not one police officer politician  . let us face it no one in authority  would they are all above the law . so way are people so surprised at these revelation's ?
Who cares? We all know the "pandemic" was blown way out of proportion by the media, the virus is rarely even spoken about these days. It's in the past and forgotten about like anyone with half a brain knew. I just feel bad for those that are not as intelligent and are easily manipulated by our propaganda machines.
Honestly what I want to know is who's been sitting with this video for all these years and only just released it now!?
Next it will be Sunak and Starmer were at it.
RIP to my grandma, and yours too.  One day we'll find a shoulder as soft to cry on. Thanks for the smiles. I'm so sorry y'all ❤❤
Rivers of tears should drown this type of disorder/sickness but 'rats' survive. Not for long though One would Hope, but the problem is that they multiply, they spread, they are able to float with the Turds. It must be the adoration of Devil which affect some people's brains, making them Tolerant, in acceptance of Debauchery, Division, Brutality, becoming Servants of Paedophilia, of Incest, Some deranged, vile, twisted, perverted characters, raised with the purpose to murder Morality, supporters of Freudo-Marxism/Masonry and way beyond these Rotten Phenomenons (The Cults, the Faithless, including those pretending to uphold healthy values, principles only to please the Baa-Baa and/or camel Fools). Wake up!
I hope all those people at that party get fired from their jobs
This is what happens when you doing believe what your saying. Do as I say not as I do.
All politicians and their associates can NEVER be trusted. I'd go as far as completely changing the political system and sacking every last one. They behave like school children in parliamentary debates and have lost all courtesy for differing viewpoints.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Looks a bit staged tbh.
Disgusting, all of them need fining and sacking, they are laughing at us...
This happened just after my mother was infected with Covid IN HOSPITAL.  She held on until 10th Jan '21. These sociopaths deserve every misfortune possible. 🤬 The 'social distancing' posters are on the pillar right in front of them too... 🖕🖕🖕🖕
I feel sick watching this
The way in which this country is governed must change.   The ministerial code needs an independent rewrite and the rules changing so that the electorate can move as one to oust corrupt leaders and governments much earlier.   Change of leader should equal a public vote. This country has failed, Brexit has failed, the economy has failed, this government has failed. We have been built on lies, falsehoods and distraction. The Tories must go and go quickly.
Let's be honest, is anybody surprised by this behaviour. They laughed at us while people were going through hell. They're a despicable party overseen by despicable people, they couldn't run a bath nevermind a country. They look after themselves and their cronies while the rest of us struggle to eat. My condolences to all families who lost loved ones,my own included. Absolutely disgusting.
The police won't do shit no fines issued just as useless as a tory also remeber folks you have to walk past an officer to get into downing street and they never exposed what was happening no womder nobody trusts them
Despicable 😡.  I caught COVID in March 2020.  Being in hospital with the nurses saying we need more body bags.  Hearing the Doctor fighting to save the Lady in the next  beds  life.  Her dying with no one to hold her hand.  Watching MY Mother dying on Christmas day was the worse thing ever.  To see them having a party is deplorable.  They should all be struck off.  I hope they all rot in HELL
Let's not forget what fuelled these parties. Cocaine and ripping off the public
The year the Xmas was cancelled - I presume they don't have parents.
Wow Such Self-Entitled Cunts
And Johnson has awared them with Gongs ! How can the King condone this ? He is supposed to be head of state yet he appears to be in full agreement. What the heck did we fight WW2 for ?
Could be arrested just for those dancing moves ffs
This is just distracting us from the real issue. The lockdowns shouldn't have happened in the first place.
They want everyone outraged it's all part of  their master plan! Rich toffs want ti control everyone!🤪
If this don’t wake you up I don’t know what will
It’s time for the Tory party to go - the contempt with which they have treated the British public is sickening. If they can’t lead by example, they aren’t fit to lead!
Tory scum
Line them up against the wall.  I was ready for revolution when they cheered and laughed at cutting public sector pay. How people can vote for these criminals even now is beyond me. It's gotta be cult-ishness it can't be anything else
I’m not gonna lie there’s no point bringing all this back up We’ve been here and done this 😊
legends
Get them all out
It's interesting that the people who were closest to the primary sources of information about the virus seem to have been the least worried about it personally...
Fucking hate torys me corrupt fucks
If it looks like an arsehole and talks like an arsehole then......
this dos not look real it look's an act  are these actual member's or actor's acting drunk ?
Nobody asks the question “why were they not scared for themselves and their families?” If it was so serious, why are they happy to behave like this. Lots of blaming and pointing fingers, but never getting down to it!
What a bunch of dickbags
So the whole dictum of social isolation, separation was for nothing? These bigwigs therefore knew some secret...which will never come out
Tories eh?  Thank you England
Evil scum on a grand scale this filthy vermin needs eradicating forever evil evil filthy lying corrupt scum
If you listened to this bunch in the first place then who is ready the 🤡
Strip them of everything and keep this story running until they have nothing left and finally put them face to face with the family’s who lost people for them to justify their action’s
Why would you film yourselves… absolute twunts lol!
I'd say I feel sorry for people who didn't see family etc but you're stupid and should never have let a goverment dictate something like that. Fight for what's right even if it means being arrested.   Many of us didn't pay two minds to the goverments rubbish and we are not remotely surprised about what's finally coming out. It's always been this way, peasants suffer while the top end laugh at us.  My family went to our nans funeral and nobody could do anything to change that. The fact everyone didn't question why a vaccine that they claimed you should take to stop the spread was clearly not stopping anyone from transmitting it.
The way we all followed like sheep retards
down with the tories
If there aren't serious charges brought against the tory party, this will be 1 excuse for the start of our civil war.
Over here in India, politicians do it ( cheating / fooling the public ) all the time. The only difference is they don't get caught. Like they say, a crime is not a crime unless you get caught...
what about 200,000 children bombed to bits in iraq in an “ILLEGAL WAR”.anybody responsible?this nation is full of fake and narcissist feculence including many in the comment section.this scandal is kindergarden play compared to what this country has done to kids in iraq KNOWLINGLY!!these are the same dance they did when children were bombed to bits in looking for WMDs!!!!while doctors and nurses dying to save people in this country they were CHEATING THE COUNTRY!!!shame on people of this nation,not to bring these sh….t to answer!
I know a song that says..The FAT LADY IN RED by the group simply red Any one remember this song?
Tory stuck up scrotums !
You telling me then two freaks dancing ain’t of their tits on coke
Bunch of posh privileged pricks
lock them up im sick of the lot off the scum ,time for a republic for the people
cmon people these fckers take the piss all the time and you put this country in there hands ..FUCKIN WAKE UP THIS WILL NEVER CHANGE..THEY EVEN TOOK THE PISS OUT OF THE PAST QUEEN WHEN HER HUSBAND DIED ..THESE ARE ALL TRAITORS OF THE CROWN
You risked it all for a dry ass party 🙃
Expect there are other vids of parties out there
the general people were being laughed at as they hit their pots and pans at 8pm 😷
The Cons and Liebour are two wings of the same Vulture
Absolute scumbags!!
There was also another quote from George Carlin, it goes "JUST THINK OF HOW STUPID THE AVERAGE PERSON IS, AND REALISE THAT HALF OF THEM A DUMBER THAN THAT"
The biggest geekfest of a party I've seen 😂😂😂
why aren’t the police being questioned about this? why did didn’t they charge anyone for breaking the law? and then to add insult to injury, Boris gives his cronies peerages etc is utterly deplorable! the awards should be rescinded  immediately.
2 fucking years they stole from you all ... 2 fucking years ! loved ones die in hospital ALONE ... old people not having any family being able to visit them, they must've been laughing their tits off watching you morons banging your pans ... where the fuck is your anger folks? riots for some twat called George Floyd who held a loaded gun to a pregnant woman's belly whilst she was pregnant BUT this nothing... silence. do these people look like they're scared of a pandemic? NO! BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT WASN'T AS SERIOUS and here we are in an energy and cost of living paying for those 2 years /// supermarkets making billions while we struggle ... the "pandemic" only did one thing and that was to further the divide and a blatant attack on the middles classes and shop owners please tell me? how certain big chains were allowed to open whilst others had to close ... it seems the difference between conspiracy and reality is just TIME
Thankyou to whoever filmed and released this video to the public... These people, and MPs in ALL parties now, would expect us to fight and die for this country in a war but they ALL treat us with total contempt (see the exit by ALL parties from the house of commons when Bridgen tried to call for a debate on covid)..i and many others spent over a year of my/our life in solitary confinement and put my/our life and career on hold just to try to help others be safe (based on the information we were given at the time).. These people and the MPs who broke the rules too should be thrown into solitary confinement for the same amount of time, and forbidden from ever holding a public office or civil service position ever again.   There are people in the comments sections trying to divert attention from key points being made by trolling or being argumentative about other issues so please stay on focus and ignore any attempts to divert attention away from the contemptible attitudes of our MPs and civil servants in too much of life now when us plebs have to struggle just to heat our homes in winter or feed our kids these people are laughing at us while they get rich through kickbacks and contracts and pulling each other up the pole..  Best wishes to anyone reading this from Rolland at Castle Hassall
Omg the dancing alone is criminal!
They will all receive punishment for this 🙏
Everybody complaining about shit that was all so obvious in what was gonna happen anyway, you're all to blame aswell, not being funny but it's true. As George Carlin once said "If you have SELFISH, IGNORANT citizens then you are gonna get selfish, IGNORANT leaders"
Absolute scum of the lowest order, every one of them
I stayed home because I have a heart condition I was classed as in the high category groups this really p1sses me
I've been saying it for ages there laughing at us, it's are distractions while there get the cbdcs through the back door and ubi, scs, and one app to rule them all etc etc, hopefully they won't be laughing for much longer
sack them all, jail them all. they broke the rules we were FORCED to comply with.... their rules might i add. there's alot of words we'd love to call these scumbags but ill stick with that one coz its allowed and wont get me accused of hatespeech or racism or bigotry or sexism.... bloody hell we cant even speak anymore can we
Disgusting excuses for human beings.
Imagine holding a lockdown party and it being absolutely shit
Despicable, this country is turning into a laughing stock.
Name ane shame each and everyone of them. Get this asshat government out of here ffs..ruining put country
But we were all just right wing racists for believing this right 🤣?
I think they have know now that as soon as the next election comes up.. they're fucked
scum of the earth, rotten to the core..
Just as a reminder, Boris said this didn’t happen. And if it did, they didn’t breach lockdown. And if they did, it’s your fault.
Sorry but the people themselves brought this about by not standing up to the government. All political parties laughed at those being compliant, knew they could get away with it. Those that queued up for their jabs, followed the restrictions and rules I hold fully responsible for the mess this country is in. If they had refused they would not have got away with it. Millions of us ignored it and knew it was lies from the start.
It was a celebration that their lockdown plan worked, simple as that!
One rule for them & one rule for us - despicable actions by the tories 👎
To the retards who voted for a Boris Johnson government, what did you expect? He’s spat in the public’s face so many times. This is on you. Utter fools.
The Tories got blood on their hands. These fuckers been getting away with cold-blooded murders in daylight, because they're too comfortable and complacent. The state of the country
Right so these geeks and losers are in some sort of power position in our society? Are you flippin joking ?! We have geeks like this taking the piss out of all of us ! I’m glad I never stuck to the rules because I knew it was all over the top and illogical but I’m angry because they scared so many people into hiding ! And it ruined life’s people missed love ones passing away etc because these prick wanna sell more vaccines and keep us enslaved
Let’s hope there isn’t another pandemic hey…… Public won’t listen to any bullshit rules now
Good, we all should have laughed about them and not followed like sheep. Don't listen to your government
This is what happens when rich kids get power.
Horrible lizards
It might be time for a revolution
My wife's Dad died because he gave up he didn't understand why people couldn't visit him in the home he was in he suffered with dementia . He thought his family didn't want to see him or care - he gave up with life and died with broken heart. My wife is deeply heartbroken knowing this still hurts everyday ,  I hope these people above get what they deserve and all who we're connected to this utter disgrace they need locking up and the key thrown away.
It always was & it always will be about control. A system set up by elites to gain power. It doesn’t matter about the party or the politics. If they tell you it’s about sustainability or you must think in a particular way then you are the people they what to remove. The suffering people went through under the lies of elites & politicians supported by the media. When they all knew it was one big lie.
Just when you think this despicable bunch of over privileged morons can’t sink any lower, they take being obnoxious to a whole new level while sticking two fingers up to every single person who followed the rules, even in the most heartbreaking of circumstances. Absolute shameless scum.
Meanwhile I wasn't allowed to visit my Mother who was dying in Hospital at the time.
One of the most socially awkward parties I’ve ever seen
that guy in the christmas jumper was horny
Theyre matrix and all you clowns will still follow there rules
This footage is the last straw to wake up who have been deep asleep. This is telling you not to blindly obey what these so called elites impose on people.
Who paid for this party?
Total scum. The queen sat alone at her husbands (of 70 years) funeral. The Queen!!!! And these rats think this is acceptable. General election NOW!
Vermin vermin vermin  throw the fukin key away from these bastard my mother died 20 people separated  in church couldn't even touch each other and that vermin scum tory prick gets an OBE  unreal
I don't usually vote but I will at the next opportunity just to get this lot out.
That guy in the Christmas jumper spins that girl one more time, I’ll spin his jaw
🤬🤬🤬
They should all lose their jobs and all pay the maximum fines just as the general public had to
So Johns's advice came from these people.
They all need the sack an put in jail
These people are meant to be our leaders
Soon everyone will know all governments are scumbags The biggest criminal organisation there is! Open your eyes they don’t give a sh!t about real people
bruhhhhhhh can you all get some hobbies, literally i broke the rules you broke the rules stop dividing yourself.
Everyone of these sh@tbags should be in jail and never allowed to work in government again
Now you know what to do when they impose restrictions on you and your family whilst they can do whatever they want.  I believe the COVID lockdown was an experiment on how far those in power can take it.
I'm fed up with this worrllld - Tommy Wiseau
Couldn’t give a kcuf you propaganda machine
It just proves, that all the c*o*v^i^d madness was designed and orchestrated to scare the population. It is obviouse, that if so called "virus" was so deadly and dangerous as they claimed,  they would not laugh about it. But they new very well it's been a global scale psyop...  For me it was clear straight at the beginning, whenn Cumming was visiting his parents and just disregarded all the moronic rules. If there was a danger, he would not compromise life and health of his parents... (Guess, this comment will disappear soon ;))
WTF did you idiots think was going on?  these rules were obviously ridiculous from the start! some people were talking about it, but no, you IDIOTS labeled them as 'antivaxers' and 'conspiracy theorists' you sat back and said and did nothing as media, government and social media imposed communist style censorship, and now you IDIOTS are acting all suprised, the left are a disgrace for going on so willingly with it all
If Ben Mallet had a scintilla of integrity or respect for the human lives lost just on this day alone, he'd decline the OBE. Not even Messina can't fix this one for you, brother. Grow the f*ck up.
What is that dancing...omg that should illegal
You followed the rules because YOU are ALL FOOLS, rolled up YOUR SLEEVES  and let them do as they pleased, that is how FOOLISH YOU ALL HAVE BEEN.
We should bring back guillotines
evryone of the beta gits needs an ass kicking. Tory scum
I'm from 🇭🇳 and I tried to live my life as normal as I could. Why? Because I knew that Covid rules were ridiculous they were all based on extreme fear and the politicians never followed any. This is why  I don't believe nothing the governments say or the W. H. O. says
Prison
"That's not her boyfriend" 😂
My grandad was rendered comatose due to covid. We couldn't see him at all. Not even to visit because the risk was too great. We were told he is goung to die and we couldn't even go to say goodbye . He had a DNR put on him when he went into cardiac arrest and he somehow had a miracle and survived. He missed 4 months of his life because of something out of his control and we couldn't be there when he woke up. I had to see him start crying because he missed christmas.   Meanwhile they were out partying and breaking every rule possible. So not only did they lockdown the country too late but they also broke the rules that ordinary people followed and have unfortuantly passed away. If it were up to me they'd all face a short drop and a sudden stop for how they betrayed the citizens of the UK aswell as the ruling monarch because even she followed the rules set in place when she went to her husbands funeral. Quite frankly I don't care what your opinion on the monarchy is but to see an old woman alone in a church because of her husbands funeral should upset you. This behaviour from the Tories has gone on too long to be ignored by anyone
this makes me feel sick to my stomach.....those people have no shame and no humanity
If you actually followed the governments rules then you are an idiot
tory scumbags
What a bunch of inbreds!
Gimps the lot of them check they fucking space cadets dancing
The fact the people are shocked by the fact that the government play by their own rules is more shocking to me. Time some of u woke up
To be fair, they were all at it. You'd have thought that, if there was anything to fear from covid, those with most knowledge would have been most frightened. That they weren't speaks volumes: lying bastards, all of them. I will never obey, & indeed WILL GO OUT OF MY WAY TO BREAK, any future lockdowns.
They just lough straight into your face so keep voting for them. I should go vote but they all the same so FUCK THEM ALL!!!
I wish public hanging was still a thing
I don't actually care they broke their own rules. The real question is, why did everyone accept those rules in the first place?
There will be those who think we should move on from this atrocious, self centred, dispassionate, mocking behaviour. My question would be  "how the hell  can we"  ❓
It's despicable ‼️ One rule for the Tories and one rule for us ‼️🤷  How does that work❓  Sorry Tories, you have completely fallen from Grace through lies, deceit and Cover-up! ‼️  The whole Nation should protest for a week to initiate a   **GENERAL ELECTION**  NOW ‼️👍‼️👍‼️👍
Nobody can defend this. Even in the comments, the only 'defense' you'll find is admitting the Tory party is corrupt 'but the other side's just as bad' (citation needed)
legend whoever recorded this, no arguing no about the part now
Put them in the jail!!!
As much as I disagree with the behaviour. Would all political parties not be better off putting their heads together and deal with what's going on instead of  piont scoring
Tories - Cucking Funts..............................!
Ok let's hear the usual suspects defend this bloody mess.....
And what will their punishment be for breaking the rules they made?! F ALL, that's what, I bet you. If the law is not going to punish these scum, like the law would punish a normal citizen, the normal citizens should punish them!!!
Just get these dicks out of power!
They are all pathetic examples of the human species.  When you have lost family members and you didn't get to say bye to them during their last moments, due to stringent rules in place, to then see these imbeciles mocking us, it takes the p***.
Wasn't the Mirror a Boris-supporting newspaper?
The parties aren’t the bad part. It’s the fact they stopped everyone else from doing the same. Covid CLEARLY wasn’t a good reason to stop weddings, churches and funerals if the most elite in society were partying it up
So King Charles is expected to smile and give this guy an OBE? 😂 MADNESS
Those in so called government are scum. I hate them
The public need to be held accountable for stupidity, I was told i can't walk my dog in a empty field because it's dangerous 😂, i also watched as mankind's dumbest would drive about by themselves in a car with a mask on and the windows up.
As  a Nurse that has questioned this pandemic the entire time. This just confirms all my suspicions that this was and always has been grossly exaggerated. These people should be in prison.
One of my colleagues was rejected from going to Poland to attend her mother's funeral. Her soul is to this day crushed by guilt and sorrow and these people party and dance like there is no care in the world. I had to get vaccinated to see my father who was diagnosed with cancer, another friend had to endure 2 weeks of quarantine while her mother was dying in the hospital with police checking her location every hour, and they are laughing and celebrating. I am just waiting for videos like this to surface in every country because they were not alone in doing stuff like this.
Shit like this is why I haven't voted in any capacity for a year, not voting for any of the sleezy political scumbags anymore.
I blame the idiots that voted for him and the rest of them in.... You get what you vote for....
Pure vile disgusting behaviour,these clowns have destroyed eny confidence the public have in them, has for the next election 😂
Absolute scum.
all on ❄
Is there anyone out there who didn't think this was going on? How many TV drama's etc. were filmed during lockdown because there was no shortage of content on the BBC. Trees in full leaf during what would have been lockdown summer. Scammed.
You’ve had this video since Dec 2022, as shown in the article by Pippa Crerar, so why only release it now?! You’re as complicit as the rest of them!
Right from the beginning, I was thinking, if this was a disease like Ebola, NO-ONE would bend the rules - politicians or public.  But they enforced this cruel nonsense on the country, causing untold suffering.  And all the time, laughing in our faces.   They have vilified Boris, but almost all of them were guilty.
This is why the Conservative party must NOT get in at the next election,  it's time for change.
Tories the biggest form of Cancer to England to Date what a wank government they need fucking off
Those were the people telling me to get vaccinated? Why on earth would I listen to them lot??
They're all scumbags
Sooo eerm....... When are we starting the revolution guys? .. About time don't you think?
Dirty racist torys as usual doing what ever they want
Don't these people have any shame OR self-respect. We should put them on a boat & send them off from our shores never to come back on pain of death if they do !! Brainless hooligans !
And the people who tried to tell you what was going on were ‘conspiracy theorists’ the people who were peacefully marching in London to wake everyone up were brutally beaten by the police and cheered on from the sidelines by the people that were in power.
Don’t blame them really the rules were a joke it was the publics dumb fault for following them which I never did.
You should make them pay all them fines that people may have gotten and then they should be put behind bars themselves I think our government is an absolute joke this country is a failing society and we need people that know what there doing and know what the people need so we can make this place better
I can assure you thats more than drink.
The crime was putting fear into the feeble-minded and getting the gullible to lockdown when it wasn't needed.
Who's there, who are they, what year is it
Well I'm not one to question my betters - one of these people has been given an OBE - so I'm sure there was a valid reason for the Torys lockdown party.
Truth of the lie....right there.
What a sewer
Fuck the tory cunts. We need to scrap the entire political system in this country. Every last one of them is corrupt, the house of lords are all nonces.
And that’s why I don’t believe a single word politicians speak, and never will
I don't know how people trust the UK government after this.
Looks fake as fook😂, sorry don’t buy it.
This is where our taxes are going.
Bunch of effing degeneartes
Bloody Etonian toffs.
I don't blame tories it's the alcohol culture which drags any intellectual individuals to break the laws. It's time to ban alcohol and severe punishment for drug users and sellers...
Love it, I never listened to the silly rules
You peasants won't do shit about it though
Revolution is deeply needed 😢
They should be more embarrassed about that dancing
WHILE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET INTO EACH OTHER MY DAD WAS DYING OF CANCER AND DEMENTIA WTG UK THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE CONTEMPT OF YOU'RE HEROS IN POWER THAT LOOKED AFTER YOU AND  SAVED YOUR LIVES , SORRY I MEANT JAILED YOU FOR YOUR SAFETY
Shame on them! Heartless bastards
No good you lot posting this now. All the media in this country backed the nonsense. I won't forget that although it seems everyone else has.
we had photo evidence we knew what was going on from DAY 1!
Looks like a decent party to be fair 🎉👍
The fella in jumper trying to get shag the sad little Tory twat
Absolute scum. Bloody politicians only feathering their own nests. The worst part is nothing will happen as they’re protected, the system is so broken and it’s the vulnerable and ordinary hard working people who always suffer the most. They’re all the same, scum bags who can’t be trusted. Absolutely disgusting, they should hold their heads in shame but then none of them have a moral fibre in their body.
Absolutely sickening! Disgusting corrupt government that were elected because the British people are thick enough to fall for a slogan!!
Meanwhile I'm holding a phone to a dying women's ear so her son and daughter in law could say goodbye.   Then I sat next to her and held her hand until she died, she was end of life.
Lock them up just for the dance moves.
The most shocking thing is that people are shocked.
Imagine being unable to see your loved one as they're about to pass because of rules these guys put up. Meanwhile they'll happily break it for a party
Tory Vermin. Their time is up.
And whilst they partied my parents were sat at home wondering if I was going to live. I was 18 years old when my parents said goodbye to me before I was taken away in an ambulance.
Absolutely sickening 😡😡😡
I kept telling everyone this was very likely happening. 100% that this sort of thing was eventually come to light. I can’t say I’m surprised and I hate it when I’m right.
Who cares!!
They're snakes no doubt but you people are just as bad for listening to what they were all peddling. It was all a farce, they knew it was nowhere near as dangerous as it was supposed to be. No country wanted to be the one that said "wait... this is all nonsense" so the situation just kept escalating with stupid kneejerk reactions. I carried on living my life like nothing was different.
You think this is bad, check out this year's excess deaths 😮
Who cares 100% of Bristish people broke the rules lol nobody stayed home you goofs
Ahh, that Boris... he's a right laugh. Let's make him Prime Minister! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
They laugh at people following them. There is a massive difference.
I think people seem to be missing a nuanced point here, the point is that lockdown shouldn't have been a thing to begin with, no restrictions, you was less likely to catch covid outside in the sun where its destroyed under UV light  But we got gas lit into thinking this was clever by politicians & scientists that didnt follow the rules they put in place, rules that should have never been in place to begin with  But lets be honest, id wager alot of us didnt follow all the rules regarding lockdown aswell  But ill reiterate, these rules & restrictions should never have taken place
Absolutely disgusting. My brother-in-law died of covid while they danced and partied. A Nottingham student got a fine of £14.0000 for having a party during the lockdown. While these shameless millionaires would have got a measly, £50 fine each. Where is the justice?. The police even tried to cover it up and not release the names of those involved.
That lady in the red dress looks like Angela Rayner to me. It must be a Labour work meeting.
One thing is definitely a dead cert, the Tories WILL NOT WIN the next election.
Fckers!
Absolutely disgusting
Why would you film this and expect to get away with it 🤡
Stay at home save the nhs was the message during covid No more then 6 people in a support bubble I lost a friend of mine and saw many people suffer with loss of a family or friend, This is fucking disgusting
Looks like deleted scenes from The Office
The Queen sat completely isolated during Prince Philips memorial service...😢😢😢
Look at that twat dancing 😂
Dec 14th 2020 was my 70th Birthday which I spent alone without any family contact . What a shower .
What is needed, sunik has to resign as well as ginger Johnson getting a kick up the ass, call a general election and no one should vote.! This is what runs the uk. Absolute disgusting.
🛎️🔚 every single one of them!
None of this is new or shocking tbh. When they first made these rules no one really wanted to follow them. The minute i saw pictures of Corbyn and co breaking the number limit at some point, and some SNP people travelling here there and everywhere when that was banned and when the Tories were caught breaking the rules all i ever got from it were that the people who made the rules didnt believe in them so it cant really be that bad and i too didnt bother following the rules aside from the ones like masks in shops which would have been more hassle then it was worth.  If i remember right back when this started the Tories initially just wanted to tell people to wash their hands until the media and public demanded they did more. So even fromn the start they never believed in the rules they were setting
Karma should’ve gave them a hit of Covid so badly
My fucking childhood dog died and I couldn’t be there to say goodbye in the vets while these posh little entitled twats had a party. We should take a page out the frenchs books and start making guillotines again.
Still most of the British people's will support these politicians. 😕
Party while the rest of the country suffer is despicable. Apologies are not enough and criminal action should be taken.
They are just as awkward at a party as I thought they would be. Every single on of them owes the people an apology and immediate resignation from any public post they hold. They lied and the laugh in our faces while we watch our loved ones die and were not able to say good bye or even give them the send off they deserved.
you see this then remember the queen, sitting completely alone and isolated at Prince Phillip's Funeral
My best mate was dying in hospital with COVID whilst these pricks are breaking every possible rule know to COVID and man
the country filled with idiot citizens that will keep voting for conservative they deserve what they asked for do they not?
So if Tories are still voted by their constituents even with this evidence of double-standardness during covid, then it’s easy to say that the UK has never learned a single lesson at all.
This is absolutely disgusting, while the common person suffered deprated from their loved ones and many died on they own as the restriction dint allow anybody to visit, while all this these hypocrites are enjoying the social gathering. All of them should be fired or resign,!!! Same as the fucking leader no brain Boris monkey...
Thank you God ❤ I honour the light in you, I honour the light in everybody 🙏 ❤️👍🫶❤
I had to watch a family members funeral from a live stream whilst these f**ing wet wipes were living life to the max..  I am beyond livid watching this sh*t! F***ing DISGRACE.
Shows me their childish attitudes, they are not fit to be part of the UK Government
I could not visit my mother in hospital...we were wiping everything from the supermarkets and wearing masks...keeping 2 meters ect ect.. Yes, this lot thought at the time it did not apply to them. Members of the public received fines...complete joke!
I was limited from seeing my dying grandma because I was told I couldn’t visit her due to restrictions and these F****** were doing this. Boris, you and your team are the scum of the earth and deserve nothing. Karma will come back for you.
There you have it. That's what you're really voting for. Honestly, what is point in all that green leather and mahogany when these are the people who occupy the seats? The people running the show are so blatantly corrupt. Boris Johnson repeatedly lied to the country and the houses of parliament and yet on the news they're still presenting his case as though there are two sides to the story. Truly the stranglehold our government has over the media in this country is criminal.
I'm still paying a 2,500 fine for being in my friends house to go the toilet , this video is going to the court tomorrow, absolute rats
Here they were partying, whilst I had to pay an extra £1200 just to be able to fly back home to see my granny's final moments. I wasted 2 precious days as well waiting for results.
Like the old days we use to say “Do As I Say, Not As I Do”
She some egat,yuk
I didn’t get to say goodbye to beloved nan as she died alone whilst these rats were partying
Decadence
fucking nonces the lot of them
Corrupt government - I hate this country! 😡
My brother aged 53 died of pancreatic cancer in November 2020. I couldn't go to his funeral due to Covid rules at the time. This video makes me sick to my stomach. How dare they behave like this. Should all go to jail.
So great that a clown with no honor like boris can name people honorable... what a joke of a country we are
Two faces bastard's!!!
If this is a party then the event planners should be sacked. Looks more like some cake in the break room at the office, with social distancing signs that have been ignored (like most people done at home anyway judging by the number of "family members" in peoples houses at Christmas). I'd prefer an apology for lockdown, & to compensate us they'll reduce tax for a year, and maybe throw in a few more bank holidays, oh and reduce the state pension age. Let's turn this to our advantage :P.
Arseholes
What with this, Dominic Cummings driving to Barnard Castle to ‘check his eyesight’, and Nicola Sturgeon’s sidekick getting caught travelling to her holiday home at weekends, there is absolutely no hope of people following any restrictions in the future. I’m now really cross with myself for not visiting my 87 year old mum for months, for fear of prosecution. In future, I’ll use my own judgement and common sense when the Govt issues any sort of directive, as I suspect most people will.
A££h@#*s
Every one else gets hammered for this but the Tory elite get rewarded!
Can't blame them for laughing to be honest. COVID was only a concern for poor people with bad health conditions.
Everyone of them scumbags should be sacked and given a massive fine or put in prison 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉.. tossers
Disgusting plebs
What can you say? Total scumbags.
Not a brain sail between them and this is the people running the country 😢🤷🏽‍♂️
If you all lined up in 2 mile queues for your shopping youre all as dumb as these are.
Entire tory party all of them should be fired and banned from any gov job ever again. Fine and Jailed. So sick of this shit
Hmmm... So it was totally true then that the Tories - like many governments across the world - implemented lockdowns and other restrictions without having any intention whatsoever of respecting these themselves. Who could have imagined??
Haha my post exposing the gov and covid has been removed for "hate speach" 😂😂😂
And what have we got to look forward to? A slightly lighter shade of Blue. The whole of British politics is broke and has been for a long time!
Lock em up twats
Cool
No excuse to simp... Ever
One rule for the elitist another for the rest absolute hypocrisy
Are we actually ever going to have any justice for all this. The U.K. is a fkin JOKE.
Everyone needs to see this
Wankers
This is why you shouldn't vote for Tories, they have never been a party that worked hard for the poor and their fellow man. If you read up on history, their party was created for the sole purpose of benefiting the richest. The Tories have always believed there should be separation from the high class and low class of society and this video is a perfect example of their mentality of one rule for the rich and another for the poor.  The reason we are suffering right now is because idiots out of racism voted for the Tories for brexit, the Tories are elitist scum that don't give a second thought towards the working man that keeps this country going.  They tell us to get used to being poor as giving more money will rise inflation, yet will spend tax payer money on private jets and fancy luxuries that they could afford themselves ( looking at you multi billionaire Rishi Sunak) which also drives inflation.  WAKE UP PEOPLE, THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS CORRUPT, OUT WITH TORY SCUM.  WE NEED TO SORT THIS OUT AND PUT PEOPLE IN CHARGE WHO ARE COMMONWEALTH PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT SUFFERING IS LIKE AND WHO WILL USE THAT BACKGROUND TO HELP THIS COUNTRY, NOT BLEED IT DRY!!!
That couple dancing 😂 like watching a couple of toddlers hyped up on sugar in the garden in the summer
we as the public allowed this to happen...
Yeah but, if Jeremy corbyn was elected instead, the country would have been bankrupt & Keir starmer can't even define what a woman is? ❤️🇬🇧
The biggest thing is the cringeness
We don't want nor do we need anymore clowns in power we have more than enough.who have done nothing but fill their pockets and run this country to the ground.and they tell nothing but lies how to make false promises . They all should be held accountable .
glad they enjoyed themselves while my whole life was ruined by not being able to sit my gcse's, lost all my friends, now have severe social anxiety and depression, can't afford food, can barely pay for electric and bills and lets not forget a WHOLE ASS LIVING CRISIS.
We dont care! I dont care if they had a bouncy castle also! Boring
Be assured of one thing: these 'people' are not the ones to blame.  Nor are their bosses - Johnson et al.  The ones to blame, the ones with blood on their hands,  are the ones who voted them into power because everyone else knew what a cabal of liars they are.  If they didn't realise back in 2019 (before the pandemic), they know now!  RIP those who had to die alone, away from families and loved ones, while Boris & Co partied.
Anyone still stupid enough to have the covid vaccine?
At the time I couldn’t say goodbye to grandparents…… Get them out…. GET THEM THE FUCK OUT.
Looks exactly what I imagine a Tory party to look like..
They should be stripped of all titles and assets, put in stocks and beaten until christmas.
Absolute fucking scum. Yet they will see no justice.   In an ideal world they would all be dead while the innocent that died without being allowed to see their loved ones would still be here.  I hope one day karma hits every single one of them HARD.
Absolutely disgusting smug scummy dirty Tory baxxxxds
Clearly a spoof
What a bunch of pompous, arrogant, contemptible, self serving vermin.  People were dying and loved ones were told they couldn’t be with them, whilst these rats broke the rules and stuck two fingers up to the entire country.  Sooner these lot are gone the better, f*cking disgusting
Stuck up rich filthy bastards
The contempt they have for the people of this nation knows no bounds
I wanna see more labour leaked footage
Scumbags: blue blooded, pony fucking scumbags.
Sack the filthy scum, every single one absolute disgrace
Ah well, folks will just moan on the internet, nothing will change, and two sets of rules will continue existing. Action is needed, and action isn't found online, but we're also too divided and arguing over pointless labels to ever be unified for said action to happen
And?
loooool who cares? the party looked dead anyway. please people stop being mugs and forcing everybody to sit at home alone with two condoms and shin pads on. turn off the tele, go have a shit, go outside, be free, be together!
And everyone’s trusts the jab 🤡
Why did he get an OBE firstly he's a law breaking criminal and what has he done to deserve that. Most people with OBE's have raised millions for charity what has this dope done.
Only fools follow rules.
If the tories win the next election, im done with this country. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
Maybe they don't think this is a "party" and to be honest they would have a point as that looks like the shittest party i've seen, bench of twats every single one of them
I feel physically sick when I think of everyone who died alone … we need justice .. these all need prosecution..
Feel sick to the stomach 😢😢😢
Kings run Kingdoms. Emporor's run Empires. I won't say who runs our Country...
That twats laugh at the end just reiterates the contempt they have for us. Horrible toffs.
I lost my Grandmother who lived in a nursing home across the street and was told I could not come in in her final moments, while working in the ambulance service. I didn't see my family for 6 months. No funeral.
THESE  JUNKY british anti english isles TORTURERS ARE  people in public office commiting T0RTURE THAT IS PUNNISHABLE TO L1FE IN PR1SON AND THEY KNOW IT THEY ARE EXPERTS IN THE LAW AFTERALL THEIR POLITICAL BRITISH UK GB MPS VOTE THE BRITISH UK GB POLITICAL UNIONIST OUT  VOTE FOR A ENGLISH ISLES GOV
All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others…
"Well done 'The Mirror', for exposing these Tory💩 Scumbags!!"👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Q
Why is it Coming out Now Three Years Later?
Why would  you film  your self  breaking  the rules          Strange behaviour
Twats 😡😡😡😡
Get ready for project blue beam folks
Thank you Tory party this is the best gift you could possibly give the people of the UK and the world - lockdowns don't work we will never have to listen to the likes of you lot again!
Students don't party as much as Boris and his cronies
They just don't care, we are irrelevant to them and if we aren't allowed to see our loved ones to say goodbye, that's not their problem, entitled arseholes every one of them and one of them got a feckin peership!!  Disgraceful but not even the slightest bit surprising.
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
And some of these got HONOURED in boris's list the other day...... the british public MUST BE STUPID to NOT SEE their VOTES allowed these people TO EFFECTIVLY BATH IN TAX PAYER MONEY.... then.... now.... and IN THE FUTURE. - this country DESERVES to be ON ITS KNEES.  get fooled... PAY the price. - and for everyone, like me that were predicting every part of what came, or worse... they dragged US down with them.
Rules being broken by the rule makers . 😂
And just think people were being arrested for going for walks on the moors!
"Ahh, just like the 6th Form Common room back at Eton dont you know".... W*nkers.
Tory scum
One word for all of them; cunts. While they were all fucking about thinking they were above the law and better than the rest of us, I was making sure social distancing was followed to the full as I was looking after my dad who had lung cancer, making sure he was safe from any infection to make sure he could get the best life without picking up covid. Hope they all get publicly hung and sacked, along with other people who bent the rules because they were too fucking selfish and stupid, fucking up getting this country safe enough but you all know who you are. Cunts.
It's an absolute disgrace. There's no way they are doing that dance properly. They need to straighten their backs and move with more fluidity. It just looks too mechanical. In future I would suggest that anyone attending office parties have a few dance lessons beforehand. Losing a bit of weight would also be helpful. Best wishes, Johnny Muscles
Good job I didn't follow any lockdown rules. This is a lesson to the nation do not blindly follow and believe what the powers that be have to say especially when it comes to not seeing your family.
Total disregard to the depressing rules that they set for us during the lockdown. Conservatives are an embarrassment to the UK. Labour better win the election next year
Imagine what else was done by these criminals in lockdown of which there is no video evidence.
Bunch of corrupt twats like all politicians that have ruined this country!
All the people who couldn't be with their loved ones in their final hours, all the people who took their animals to the vets for the last time and couldn't be with them in their final minutes. I hope these waste of a skin losers whose faces are everywhere get their comeuppance. Miserable little oiks.
Vile, odious, lying Tories - the one constant in British life.
Ew, they are like children. Such snobby personalities, I’d love to spoon the eyes out of each & every one of them & force feed the eyes to their parents
Remember when politics was about politics?
Haha... And you stayed home... Haha... Everyone who followed the "rules" is a more ridiculous human being than those we can see in this video... Hahaha... State loyalists, look at your masters.. hahaha
BASTARDS THE LOT OF THEM!!!!
we are just all a joke to them
Smoke and mirrors....
The party was abhorrent given the circumstances. I am no condoning it in any way whatsoever, but who on earth thought it was a good idea to film it!
All still have jobs
Good for them not falling for the Fear Porn. Unless they were pushing for lockdowns too.
Almost as if they knew that the whole Covid was just propaganda used to control the public who many then were made to believe they were sick.... All parties in Parliament are corrupt.
Fucking scum bags! Every single one of them needs to lose their jobs and any privileges
I went to school with ben mallett 😂 he was a sneaky one
This is  what you get when you vote tory. They don't care about you, only there to serve themselves. EVERYONE knows this but still votes for them anyway. So if you voted for them and your loved ones died, well that's tough I'm afraid, blood is on your hands too and you asked for this to happen.
Who are these people breaking the law and order? Oh the ones who made the law.
Absolute Corrupts! Not fit to lead!!
'Great' Britain 🇬🇧
No rules for them a whole bunch of rules for the public. Same shit different day !
Tories are toast, but no other party is worth voting for either
What a bunch of punchable faces
shocking
Some snakes were at this party, paid off to release the footage when called upon
Alone dying love ones where relatives were forbidden to see, while these fools partied! Makes me sick, never again will I believe there lies! GET THEM OUT!!! 🤮🤬💯😡
the trouble with any politicians is they are unaccountable for there actions. they live above the law so it would seem. well that needs to become a thing of the past. all politicians should be fully accountable for any thing they say you do just like everyone else.
The worst nerds ever Such an amazing embarrassment , I mean look at the state of it !? Only a matter of time before the bulk of old tories start dying out in big numbers , hang on in there humanitarians ! ❤
What a cringe party
Bunch of arseholes
Not did they just ignore their own rules they did it by having a shite party wearing aweful jumpers.
Goes to prove how "deadly" this virus was If anything
Absolute fucking parasites the lot of them
W*nkers
Tories being cunts? Shocker. Congrats to the fools that make it their mission to vote these useless cunts in every single time. You're losers.
That dancing was horrendous 😂
I bet the brexitters will still think the the sun shines out of their dick holes.
Good to see the fat bird in red get some exercise. She needs it
the lot of them should be fired
It was all a lie. Biggest scam in history and they were laughing at us throughout. They told us that mixing with our closest relatives (even on their death bed) was dangerous and people actually believed them and obeyed their draconian rules & regulations until they were exposed themselves. Good luck getting our compliance again.  Never trust the Government.
Posh bastards they should be jailed
The real crime here is that "dancing" frightening
But when they give u all your favourite topic of the day...immigration,your commen sense goes out the window and you are blinded by delusional nationalist sentiments while they sell your country to the highest bidder
What a bunch of ‘tory twats’
I don't know what is worse, the bending of the rules or the horrid dancing. Both are scary.
In truth the media and the public wanted to lock down (try to recall the actual events), the government merely enabled them.       It also goes to show freedom is not a right it’s a privilege that can be revoked at any time. The media, the health sector and the whole political establishment was complicit in this.  There were a couple of dissenting voices, namely Lord Sumption, Peter Hitchens, Professor Henegan.  Everyone will forgot how very few people openly raised their concerns early on. They predicted the consequences that we are are now facing, the cure being worse than the disease.
This is so disgusting. I couldn't see my grandfather before he died, and tory are LAUGHING at us as they break their own rules having some stupid christmas party.
I don’t know what’s worse the disregard for the public or those ‘dance moves’
All politicians are criminals
Law dont apply anymore  dont hurt anyone ,if you can get by without stealing etc  growing weed is no longer illegal as far as im concerned , sooner every garden in te UK has a summer crop ,cant jail 71 million of us can they
Tories out!
I think I'm more angry that nothing is gonna be done about this. A stupid investigation will be held, but nothing more. Meanwhile, we all sat inside, unable to visit loved ones, and some (like myself) were unable to visit dying loved ones for their last moments. Something's gotta change. We the people need to rise up.
What like the titled toff and 'growler' Raynor didn't laugh at us when they broke the rules! They're all the same, just different coloured shit sandwiches, a pox on the lot of them. They're all in the 'club', and us serf's aint.
Fought for my life for 2 weeks in hospital, covid was absolutely brutal. My family couldn’t get information wether I was alive or not for 4 days, the hospital was pushed to the point of failure. 2-3 nurses to a ward of 28 patients…I couldn’t see my family, and for those who passed away in front of me, while I couldn’t do a thing to help, I sorry. All this was happening while my government, who should have done more for the NHS, instead of lining their pockets with shady PPE deals, who forbid anyone visiting loved one, partied like it was any other Xmas.
Why weren't they scared of the virus?
Fucking toffs.
prancing about right under the stay 2 metres apart notice what a set of wasters disgusting scumbags
The cun t in the Jumper looks like andrew Stephenson MP for Lancs. the lying toad.
Tory entitlement at its finest. What an utter disgrace. I work in the public sector and am an essential worker. I worked away from home throughout lockdown. If we had done that we would all have been fired! Apparently the rules don't count if you work under Boris Johnson. What a joke
I am sorry to say that none of this will bring back the time that people lost . Time with loved ones was priceless !
i wonder how much barrels of gunpowder go for these days...
''Psst pssssst Boris, you better leave now before this video gets released'' - some insider at the tory party, probably  Meanwhile Sunak being asked about it tomorrow, while he's having a photo op in a Welsh farm after commuting via RAF helicopter:  ''I know nothing and I have ordered an enquiry, while I am focusing on my 5 pledges, We will halve inflation this year to ease the cost of living and give people financial security. We will grow the economy, creating better-paid jobs and opportunity right across the country. We will make sure our national debt is falling so that we can secure the future of public services. NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly. We will pass new laws to stop small boats, making sure that if you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed. Thank you''
My old man died during this time. We buried him ... just us 4 brothers, socially distanced, gloomy day - in the rain, not a funeral befitting such a good bloke  ... so many people couldn't say goodbye. And these jackasses were getting smashed.
Won't be long until we have a Labour Government 🙏
That dancing.... Shameful
Many MPs were at it including Labour come on people vote Reform UK give some one else a chance
PURE SCUM
I didn't really want to believe it. But now I do😢.
all of them should lose their fucking jobs and be fined massively
I couldnt go and see my dying nan but these tossers can have a dance
The party aside, I honestly don't understand how ordinary people could ever vote for these kind of people. What exactly is it?
And yet people will still vote Conservative.
Bunch of mongs run this country even bigger bunch of mongs populate it 💼 ✈️ seeya
lets be honest, most of us were doing this ourselves...most people i knew were...
The last days of Rome
Hey Everyone. Dont forget they hold this recording for 3 years and didnt release it to public ! so what reason they doing this now ?? This is distraction of something else !
My dad died just after covid, I didn’t see him for 18months, I could have seen him for a holiday mid covid but we had to play by the rules… these little rich kids laughing in the faces of everyone that lost people… wrecking the nation and laughing at us all.
well looks like the people in charge wrote the rules just to break them
I laughed a lot whilst breaking lockdown rules
Side effects of alcohol and stupidity 😅😂🤣😂😅🤣 no wonder why the whole economy is messed up
Meanwhile hundreds had to stay isolated as their loved ones died alone. These precious little crybabies are so far removed from the sadness, death and destruction their government decisions cause. Someone needs to force these people to live on a low income council estate for a year. Then they’ll see what they’ve really done to their people.
Cook, Pass, Babtridge!!!!
Same system you vote for years that F in the a..s over and over for many years and you keep doing it you must be idiots!
No fear of this terrible virus which was going to wipe us all out here  what were they being told
Tories = scum
Ones starts to think if they took it seious....are they even jabbed up whilst they forced u to take it
People dumb enough to not pay attention and realise how useless the rules and everything was, dont deserve to complain.
All political parties broke the rules. Don’t forget starmer did it too we saw the video and paper evidence but got off. They all should lose their seats. Just proves it was all BS.
Well those kids will all be working cash registers by the end of the year lol
My mother in law died alone in hospital as we followed the rules. I am so angry and hurt this government is truly evil.
Sick🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Tories OUT!!!!
I know 2 colleagues and a neighbour who were not allowed to attend their love ones funeral with family and friends because of Covid restrictions. These politicians are disgusting.
It should now only be referred to as the 'dishonour' system.
This is one of the parties that were investigated by the police. Yet . . . NOBODY WAS CHARGED. Why are those police NOT being investigated ???
I broke all the rules too. Turns out there was no reason to follow them. It's your fault for having such blind faith in politicians - people you've known all your lives to be liars. They've been fooling you for decades, said jump and you went 'how high?'
More fool for us. They are hypocrites BUT educated. They understand the machine the spin and PR that was unleashed on the masses.   They know that lockdowns don't work (and was never the policy for institutions like the WHO for a reason).  Everyone here seems 'outraged' at the wrong thing. Still. But deep down, you're angry because you were duped and swallowed the cool aid.
If you followed these rules, you were a fool, brainwashed by the Media, if you injected the coolaid, you were an even bigger fool, if you are outraged , its because you are still a fool, still brainwashed by the Media.
How anyone can trust or support the tories is beyond me. This is a sickening level of self entitlement and sheer bloody arrogance...
Ah yes, divert our attention to this planned scandal, why not? When you wont tell us the sinister truth going on with the WEF and the other ruling elites.
Dancing around the Social Distance signs that they told us to obey.   A perfect metaphor for the Tory Party.  It's them and it's the little people.
This has asmack of fakeness to me.
My mothers funeral wasn’t even 10 minutes due to covid. Mean while, these wankers were… I’m too mad to even talk about it
More fools you lot for following it and being fucking sheep.
Let’s be honest here…how many people in the U.K. done the same???
Rats! But, yet you get CLOWNS who still vote for these imbeciles
Cretins
Surprise surprise, the tories are the shower of c@nts we all said they were.
Also shows you how weird and awkward these freaks are
Tory filth
I feel vindicated I never followed any of those stupid rules they created.
Levelling up!!! 😭
Cops beaten up eldery's or pregnant woman for not correctly wearing a mouth mask. But politicians stay abive the law. These politicians deserve the tribunal.
i don't know why people are getting upset watching this. they were always a bunch of deceitful bastards and they were voted in
I couldn’t visit my elderly mum who was in hospital with a broken hip  All the lot of them should be fined then fired from their jobs, and I mean all of them  Wait until the next election and see who’s laughing then you lowdown dirty bastards 😡
They are all as bad as each other, simple.
Meanwhile my mother who was dying of cancer was busy cancelling all her plans. instead to sit and rot in her house until the end because the covid cult threatened her with fines. Cancelled my brothers 18th birthday mini-rave and a once in a lifetime trip to Florida. You told her she couldn't even have people round to visit. (We did visit anyway, distanced in the garden) I hope the covid cult all suffer terribly. Genuinely, these traitors (and the enforcers of their lockdown IE police) should ALL be strung up on lamp posts.
This fits what we know of BoJo and his clown troupe They say a regiment adopts the character of its colonel.  Whilst I do not want to suggest  anything soldierly about the Floppy Johnson, this fits precisely that adage. We knew this about him many years ago. We all knew it. Some voters thought that what may be endearing in an infant with no boundaries can also be the mark of a leader.  It cannot.  Lesson learned.  Trump and Johnson are of the same mettle.... which, it turns out, is not much mettle.   😮
What the fuck is that dancing 😂😂😂😂😂
Could this be fake!?! It’s like watching a scene from the office
The honours given to those participating in ANY of the parties need to be  taken back.  You cannot honour these people who partied when others were estranged from their loved ones seeing their elderly relatives through windows and possibly dying from COVID.  How dare they even think they should get away with it.  Honours for breaking the rules....no way.  Write to your own MP and demand these honours be removed.
look like a bunch of total pratts anyway !!!! thats the government !!!!!! This must neck them all SURELY ????????????????
breakin lockdown ?..who was daft enough to be locked down anyway
Looks so staged & fake. I bet the real party they were snorting coke & getting sh*t faced. He loves that spin move though
Unfortunately people where so deluded during covid. Not once did I believe these scumbags would follow any rules set by them, not once did I follow a single rule myself. Fear mongering from day one and a constant push for you to get a jab that clearly has had an effect on people’s health wether you want to admit it or not. Heart attacks and strokes are through the roof but people still want to ignore it all. We were all lied to, accept it and start ignoring everything these evil scumbags in charge say to you
Strip them of their honors.
The arrogance!!!!
Breaking news: there is a shortage of piss due to the Government taking it all.  Honestly it is just astounding the egregious contempt for the people they are supposed to represent. Scandal after cover-up after f**k up from this Government and they are still running the country. You'd think that at a certain point they would collectively make the decision "Look guys this is just really embarrassing now, we've totally ballsed up so many things that honestly it's cringeworthy for us to pretend we can fix it. Let's just admit we don't have a f**kin clue and go back to conducting our morally questionable pursuits in an arena that doesn't impact on the lives of an entire country"
When the next elections come, vote Karma.
Good for them partying , the rules were pathetic .
And to think one of them (Shaun Bailey) is now in the House of Lords with a peerage for life, paid by us, thanks to Boris.
please show this all over the UK as much as possible before next elections so finally we can see what kind of arrogant wasters we have in the conservative party.....the entire conservative system should be closed down....hwah hwah hwah !!
When you watch this video just remember what sacrifices you made throughout the pandemic and lockdown. Did you lose a loved one and were unable to go and see them. this video and many other reports should be scared in your minds when you next have the opportunity to vote in a general election.
Fire then all! Not just Johnson. They all need to go. Lying backstabbing assholes.
Wat een duf feest. Om daarvoor een besmetting te riskeren.... 😅
A cannibal tory filming everyone enjoying themselves and then deciding they can make some money out of the video?
Who was recording and why release it now and not earlier ?
Send every one of the scum to the Ukrainazi front line as cannon fodder. Shows how useless the Met police are if this isnt evidence of breaking the rules. Send them to the front line as well.
Hardly surprising, every MP ends up in the honours list because they do 'such a hard job' compared to the rest of us mere mortals. We wouls be unable to cope with a life on a record high wage with every increasing expenses for second homes. Maybe we should call it the dishonour list instead.
I couldn't attend my nanas funeral  I'm outraged by this  But as usual nothing will be done  Horrible people absolutely disgusting
The Conservative Party has taken arrogance to a new level in your broken country. I feel very sorry for all the good people struggling with the crises just to keep their heads above water when being pissed on from a great height. Perhaps the hundreds of millions of taxpayer money spent on royal events in the past year would be more productive if spend improving ordinary people's lives.
The Fascist Party fiddled whilst Britain burned!
Utter scum. All of them- Labour Tories LibDumbs the whole lot are pure filth.
They disgust me. Then again what do we expect of tories? One rule for them……
Infinite arrogance.
That couple dancing are just delighted with themselves 😂😂😅😅 These people knew there were no risks involved. They knew the general public had been lied to, to ramp up the fear and facilitate control of the masses. And will there be any real consequences for those responsible for those who were happy to cover for those responsible ? I very much doubt it
Stupid fckers.
I am a prison officer, dealing with 86 prisoner's per unit with maximum 3 staff, we went to work then straight home, I had to watch my mother in law, along with my wife and and 2 son's watch their nan die through a window, anyone defending what they did is just as culpable, it doesn't matter whether you believed covid was real or not, it was a legal obligation made by this lot not to behave in that manner.
If anyone votes for these soulless scumbags at the next election they need their heads testing
Disgusting upper crust idiots, with no compassion to the British public, I won’t be voting conservative ever again
Perfect example of politicians having no fear of this so called deadly virus while telling others to be afraid. And not only did the majority go along with it all, they were mocking those who told you not too.
The whole thing was a scam I feel sorry for everyone who fell for it and complied with the nonsensical rules. Our politicians clearly weren't afraid of the lurgy
This is why the only way is dictatorship. None of these people would have jobs in one, as there would have been no elections to have a staff, and thus a stuff party, for.  Any party would be seen as disrespecting the orders of our Dear Leader, and well, you don't want to do that...
On behalf of those who lost loved ones from the pandemic, I declare that everyone featured on this video are scummy bastards.
Honestly, I had to double check . . .  I thought I was watching a clip from the Office for a moment   Despicable !
Worst of all is the messy footwork and too much rise and fall!
I’ve always voted conservative, not now 🤢 makes me sick.
Tory scum, i blame the pricks who voted them in. btw hows brexit going for you?
Send them to jail
I honestly think the whole lot should be sacked right away!!! No wonder the country is in the state it is now where lawmakers only make laws for the real hard working public and strangely it does not apply to them😮
And should we need any other reason to get rid of politicians this is it.
Our poor Loved ones that died alone, it all seems now like a complete fast, as when this was happening at the exact same time these disgusting drunken hypocrites where partying and laughing. Everyone of them  should be immediately sacked from politics, and for there punishment a stint in prison so they can catch up on there lockdown time.
About time the media showed the truth, along time coming. Now for: European International Covid summit 3? WHO treaty? Excess deaths?
Marie Antoinette moment.
Probably all public school educated twats.
Guess i'll have to keep voting tory, these people seem to really care about the British people
It also shows how deadly they thought the virus was. As we were being inundated with 24 covarage telking us all how many people died day by day to convince us all it wasnt worth seeing your dying Gran or to have a funeral for a loved one, this is how deadly they thought it was. Its nonsense.
One rule for them and another rule for us
This is what a real toffs party is like, fucking shit.
Scrap HS2 and use that money to hold the biggest ever public enquiry regarding this bunch of parasitic entitled  low life scumbags ,every single one of them should be under the spot light and seriously prosecuted for their actions regarding the lock down rules , and I bet a months wages even more revelations would come to light that are nothing to do with covid, even Sunak should be dragged to court because of the obscene PPE contracts fixing, we the people need someone in our corner other wise we are heading towards ruin.
Cunts!
everyone just don't ever do what these people say ever again MPs don't have the solution to problems MPs are the problem
what drugs are they on fuck me i need some
How do politicians expect me to trust them? Lying bastages.
Anyone watching this, who supported Johnson’s candidacy, should feel ashamed. He was a known quantity. Always was, always will be.
I  would just sack these public school arseholes... Thinking they are above the law and common man.... Same old story..... Total pricks.
We could've all been doing the same for the whole time but the primary goals were to fear monger ones into taking the inoculations as well as making the big pharmaceutical companies lots of money. The Plandemic was never as serious as they made it out to be. It certainly was never about health. Crazy to think that governments all over the world participated in one of the biggest lies in recorded history.
Tory WANKERS.
If the Metropolitan Police are monitoring this site then start investigating. Then they will have to charge/fine.
I bet not many of the party-goers took any experimental big pharma injections , did they fook , disgusting what’s been done . Never took any myself luckily 🙏 load of nonsense from the start 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
Well done to The Mirror for publishing this outrage. Once again the useless police have failed to do their duty. Too busy obeying their political masters.
PURE BLOODY EVIL
And two of these arseholes are put forward for HONOURS they should be stuck off the list with immediate effect and all the people in this clip should be fired immediately what a JOKE 😡
I never followed any lockdown rule unless I had to cos i knew all along it was a big scam and this just proves it I just feel sorry for all the people who fell for itand actually belive these people care about us ....there's still some wearing masks even now
pillocks
You all got fooled.
How can these people by running the country they should be ashamed of themselves doing this while so many people was suffering.
In effect these creatures along with the other rule-breakers Johnson and Sunak are saying: 'Just think while all those ghastly pleb's are standing outside their NHS slum hospitals waiting for mum or dad to die we're in here having such fun!'.
This make me 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
That picture of our queen sitting on her owen at her husband's funeral and this lot do this. Vile selfishness
Don't reward them. Prosecution for criminal conspiracy would be a good thing, then open the Russia dossier to seal their fate traitorous Tories, thieving fraudulent, lying every time they are elected! Check out their records in Parliament all of us should, at the same time! Then you see how much they've actually taken from 90 % of us for over250 years stop the UKs. Managed decline, asset stripped death at the hands of the rich, thick cheating classes
Who now is going to obey a potential lockdown situation if another virus appears in the future?
Disgraceful  On a lighter note.  Bird, long hair, red dress.  I WOULD
Sooo glad I ignored the rules. What feel really daft if I hadn't...
I'm actually glad it was such a shit party.  What a bunch of fops
Nothing but a gang of a***holes. Undiluted SCUM
have the sheep woken up yet to all there lies NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGIVE THE TYRANNY
Animal Farms Napoleon would be proud
Apparently there are other videos to come to light.
And some minister's keep defending Bojo the likes like Rees frog and dorries please for the sake of all the people that post loved one's please please vote these horrible People out once and for all
Surley the biggest questions should be, WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE DISEASE  THAT MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE SAFE TO MEET FOR PARTIES WITH NO SOCIAL DISTANCING, WHILST CONVINCING THE NATION THAT THERE WAS A DEADLY BAT FLU THAT WILL KILL MILLIONS?
Fuck the tories
These people goes to hell, English pricks  who thinks they are above others, disgusting
We absolutely need a general election to clear out this Tory dross from that sty of a parliament. The Tories are spivs, liars and crooks. They are an affront to the democratic process and to the rule of law. It would surprise no one if there was a Met officer on duty outside the door of this room.
THEY WERE ALL DOING IT, EVERY PARTY.
All we need to know is who is the person taking the video.
Half expected david brent to walk into shot 😂😂
It's almost as though the people spreading the bullshit somehow knew it was bullshit.
😂😂😂It does look like a terrible party though!!! Gotta love the socially distancing posters on the wall 😂😂😂 What idiots.
The conservatives are showing you who they are, believe them, don’t vote for them again. 1 rule for them and one for us who fund them.
now you know where your vote went
People forced to die alone while these pigs partied, laughed and enjoyed themselves...........and here i thought the tories had run out of ways to make me sick.
Just shows that covid wasn't as scary as they made out, forced vax's on people and stopped loved ones from seeing each other and soon.  Sorry but the media are as bad for their scare tactics.  Looks like the so called conspiracy theorists got it right after all
Who fell for covid 😂😂😂
Yet initially the police did virtually nothing. More proof the Met are as corrupt as the f@cking tories.
Terrible dancers😂
...and yet somehow they peddle a narative that it's all a conspiracy. My father died and I stood at an outdoor grave with  my mother, my three children and a priest at a graveside; my brother could not attend as it was a different region. He passed in hospital and I could not visit him. Shame of these people and shame on me for following the rules, I will not take any notice of the direction from government again. This country has been destoryed by the people who asked us to elect them to look after it!
Name and shame these people on TV News please.
These people are so poisonous
There are lies, damned lies, and there is Boris Johnson.
Tory cronies are bottom of the barrel excrement that will not wash
Wow
Never trust the government, when will people learn that they lie for a living. Biggest transfer of wealth ever over these last three years. And let’s not talk about the 2500 excess deaths per week in the Uk that’s happening now..
My mother was dying alone in a care home while these reprobates were partying
Each and every one of them should have their name and photo published as a warning to others of their absolute contempt for the public and the fact their honesty and integrity is not of a standard for any present or future work position that requires trust. Scandalous .
Is this an actual JOKE?
Scum bags ….total scum bags
These criminals need to bee locked up
Strictly Come Dancing Tory style. Bunch of absolute 🤬s Hope this goes viral but this lot have no shame. I feel so sorry for all those who lost loved ones during this time, unable to say goodbye to them. Sickening. And to think people were Knighted afterwards. Scotland Yard decided not to investigate this event because they accepted Tory lies about it. 🤬
Why is this even a thing, arrest them
The worst think about it is the drunken dancing, get better moves guys
That's a violent jive
They should all be fined and more importantly why haven’t the police taken any action?
Absolutely appaling and despicable , people died and could not send off there loved ones. This was a frightening time and to see this video emerge makes me angry. Laughing because you think you got away with it...Think again. The time is now for change and this government really does not deserve our trust and our vote no longer.
That jumper, those braces and those dance moves are criminal if nothing else.
Watch people try defend this on bbc lbc ect some presenters and some callers and texters
Pisses all over those that lost relatives and loved ones during or around that time.
I would also like to see more  of the other political parties being exposed.  They all did it....
Absolute scum
They don't seem scared to take the virus home to their loved ones. Makes you wonder
Literally what you imagine a bunch of toffs to look like at Conservative HQ
1 rule for the plebs, another for our overlords
That’s how secret freaks are enjoying the fruits of Lie by acting like imbeciles.
I wonder why in the heart of Conservative HQ they thought it was okay to do this. Probably because they think the rest of us are the plebs. They'll be a surprise for them at the next general election when they are all turfed out.
The UK  A country led by corrupt liars, who fail to lead by example.  A Royal family that seems to have no shame.  And a Police force that is full of sex offenders.
The rules were utter nonsense designed to keep hysterical media and unbalanced attention seeking “doctors” like ferguson happy. Anyone with half a brain could work this out.  Nonetheless, having foisted this idiocy on the rest of us it would have behooved them to at least pretend to take it seriously.
They should each pay us regular people some premiums as a penalty. Let say 200 GBP per resident
Just Tories been Tories. Laughing at the plebs
If thats a party I dread to think what their funerals are like 🎉
Dreadful! What is more despicable is there is no police action taken or fines given out for rules breaches. George Orwell was right, some are more equal than others
This is biggest Tory’s scandal since Profumo affair. 😮
SHAME ON THEM!!!
Honestly Boris rewarding his cronies with honours and Lordships is sickening.
Sack and jail the lot of them
What sickens me is that the police are said to have investigated this already and no fines were issued. The police involved in that investigation need firing as well. They are just lackeys for the Tories.
This is because the lockdown rules were ridiculous, unnecessary and none of us should have agreed to follow them
It is OK, we had parties every weekend at home too. If you believed any of the rules and followed you wheee a fool, and probably still wearing a mask
But no one told me it was a party
I've supported the Conservatives since 1987. Now they disgust me. I will not be voting for them in the next GE.
Get them out of government.
I honestly thought it was a spoof/setup watching the two dancing in the background. Looks like scene from the Office!!! These people were running our country. Shame on every one of them .
Labour MP's openly butied and laughed about grooming gangs, zero ramifications, far worse crimes yo be worried about
u were told about the bullshit by many of us also the irony of gates in the advert has me creased up....
Went to the right schools, so reckon they're untouchable. And to a large extent they are.
They was all doing it labour and tories and the mainstream media all laughing at us but we will have last laugh when ur all out of work and out of business because know one watchers the tel lie vision it's all in the name
I. Blame Brexit voters for enabling this government
Just because I didn't get to visit my dying father, it doesn't mean these wonderful people don't deserve a party while they laugh about it.
I despise these people.
Johnson is really for it!
Have to wonder why this wasntreleased at the time
That's why if we have another pandemic,we all should just ignore the rules and act normally Especially looking at this arrogant lot partying away 😡😡
This clip just sums up what the Tories really are
They should all be in jail  - drunk in charge of the country !
Love the social distancing signs, oh the irony.
The only 2 people dancing in an nation and they dance like a pile of shit. Anyone in that party has been a total social outcast just look at them.
They do what they like and the rest of us like it or lump it even get fined . Then for them peerages and rewards for it all . They take us for fools . We are not but we have no choice . Lie upon lie and keep it all hidden for so long , maybe not hidden but kept out of the public eye  We really are held in contempt
Tory scum
They all look like cunts.. you voted them your the problem. Hahah I’d love to see there faces this morning.
You know the whole shit show is nearing its end when you hear Rees Mogg got a knighthood. Morally corrupt does not even come near. They actually do believe they’re above us all and we’re the ones that put them there. I’m angry and I want an election.
The most annoying thing for me is that they clearly thought they were getting one over on us all, they thought they more important than the rest of us,balls to speaking to the police, the police were fully aware as they were taking all the party rations past them at the front door of number 10, corruption top to bottom.
And fining a Hairdresser £10,000 or is it £27,000 ? more for breaking rules. Absolutely disgusting, and words fail me.
This video will open a lot of wounds for people who could not hold the hands of their loved ones as they lay dying. Every one should face the sack. The point of the rules was to stop the transmission of an airbourne virus and it being passed in the community by asymptomatic individuals as much as possible. How does these actions safeguard against this? I'd throw them all in jail.
wow this makes news ppl having partys!!!!! do you think that there isnt anything more important to do then this????
What a bunch of tossers.
Just the mayor we need. Vile.
The really sad part is that you all obeyed these people's illegal mandates and actually believed they would do the same.
Time to dig Cromwell up. Clear the House.
Wtf did i just watch 😂😂😂😂 if thats a party they need locking up just for that
F... ING Disgraceful. It's not right. Whilst all this was going on them having a great time with Expensive Drink and food, which was all paid for I might Add. My Nan had to Bury my Grandad they had 52yrs of Marriage. ❤️ They had 8 children. 17 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren. They had Brothers and sisters still alive. My nan was only allowed to pick one person to be with her at he's funeral. It was devastating for everyone. 😢😠😠 But what's going to happen to them?  Maybe get the Sake? But apart from that Absolutely NOTHING...
My mum got Covid, had a stroke, and took months to die. Had to visit her behind a perspex screen, but I got to hug her once before she died. Seeing this makes me ashamed to of being British, and having to share oxygen with self entitled public school retards like these.
😂
Dirty bunch of corrupt cunts.
Wow just wow. Not one fking covid mask in sight. All those at party have to be sacked and charged. Time for Tories to be booted out. Party's over!
Bunch of disrespectful bastards
😳🤦🏼‍♀️🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮Shame on you‼️🇬🇧
And we know this is true how?    Old news, who cares?
Covid scam
They should be in jail
Rules? What rules? Rules don’t exist for the Conservative Party! 🤮
I can't believe that people are surprised by this. Our leaders knew that covid wasn't dangerous to 99% of the population.
Oh no what a shocking surprise.
If the government had made covid guidance the responsibility of the public and not tried to enforce it on us like a totalitarian regime then none of this would be happening to them now.
Of course, you are far above us, above the people who REALLY WORK!!!!
What I find completely mind blowing is that the government's signs  of "you must stay two metres apart " are clearly visable in each shot. For me, this rubs salt into the wound. Clearly, Boris's statement that at these meet ups, all rules were followed is yet another lie.  I don't know why this video has only just been released? I wonder if the Conservatives would consider this relevant for the up coming Covid Inquiry?
I have extreme hatred for these 💩 heads 😡
Sickening. Labour no better. Main parties have lost respect for themselves and the public.
Politicians are world wide liar’s.
Anyone out there that is let's say in the 50 to 69 bracket that has voted these erse holes all their lives can you please take a look in the mirror and ask yourself if you can vote for them again. I know I won't.
WANKERS ONE AND ALL!
Very poor dancing
Tories.
I thought Starmer's curry night was investigated and found that it was a meal while at work? Not asking for a torrent of abuse, just to clear things up. I honestly don't think any of them can be trusted, it's literally a lessor of two evils.
The tories for the next 10-15 years, are over
The blame on all this is on the Brexit and Tory voters who voted Boris and the tories in, I’m sorry to say but it’s the voters fault
It is clear once again that the UK has never seen a successful revolt against the elite. They feel entitled and safe. 1000 year uninterrupted rule by the upper class is the cause.
These two faced TORY SCUM are treating the ENTIRE uk population with UTTER CONTEMPT. No wonder the laughing chimpanzee sunak, is ALWAYS LAUGHING......
“Make rules, break rules, don’t give a fuck like a tory”. “I make the rules but only I can break them” “do as I say, not as I do”.
To be fair,,we took absolutely no notice of the lockdown rules,,and did exactly as we wanted...Went to see relatives,,birthdays etc etc...If you couldn't see through their bullshit,more fool you..
Excellent footage! Well done to the person who released it.  It takes balls to throw yourself under the bus 😎
Fuck and I went to a party in a council estate and left in cuffs with a £30 COVID fine😂
And the Met didn't have enough evidence to fine anyone??????
Disgusting and their leaders are being honoured! What a contradiction!!:How on earth did the UK sink so low
Anyone who votes for these creatures needs locking up with them
CORRUPTION - honours list is basically jobs (honours) for the boys!
We suffered whilst these so called leaders didn’t care .
Yes, they were idiots and hypocrites. But like lots of other people also breaking the rules up and down the country, they obviously knew the rules were simply stupid and unworkable. The real people needing fined/locked up are the officials who capitalised on people's misery throughout lockdown, and the BBC and World Health Organisation whose catastrophising with skyrocketing predicted death tolls caused the mental health pandemic we're now living through for the next however many years. They're the real villains here.
Vote them all out and never ever vote for them again
Fecking muppets. What a shitshow! Unforgiveable.
We had to cancel Christmas that year and it would have been the last Christmas we would have been able to spend with two of our loved ones 😞
And the MET looked into this event and found no evidence of a party, im not a copper but this looks like a party to me? Maybe Rishi can remove the OBE and Shaun Bailey Knighthood because attended at the start and had his photo taken with them.
That guy in the jumper "dancing" is really creepy.  Also, you voted for them now you're complaining - as if anyone ever thought the tories gave a toss about anyone but themselves lol.
Are those two twinkletoed performers hoping to get on Strictly?
His dancing skills are deplorable
It makes one blood boil.. they are disgusting 😡😡😡
Eton Rifles……
They were having the time of their lives, drunk of champagne and god knows what else while the elderly were dying in their thousands in care homes
Proof white people can’t dance 😂
These dorks are part of running the country?! UK is done!!
It's informative to witness the genuine immoral scum of the world. Disgusting but edifying to identfy who these people really were. Let them dance solo in a confined space
Yes we know they're utter contemptible a-holes, pls everyone have some sense and vote them out with tactical voting, yes we know Labour ain't great, but srsly...
It’s cos the whole thing was a scam to see how subservient people were gonna be
DISRESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ANYONE WHO DEALT WITH LOSS AND MISSING OUT SPECIAL MOMENTS WITH THEIR LOVED ONES DURING  LOCK-DOWN! 🤬
They never learn, do they?  How many times does it take for these idiots involved in politics to realise that _NOTHING DODGY_ remains secret anymore?!  If you're in _ANY WAY_ involved in politics -- an aide, a butler, a civil servant, whatever -- you've got to be *_SQUEAKY BLOODY CLEAN!_*  🙄
Did they really know something the rest of the population didn't know?
I wonder if whoever is leaking these videos has a hatred to the government.  I am sure lots of videos are available about other political parties but  that doesn't cause so much upheaval.  A bit hypocritical.
Take a person. Remove their conscience. Take away their morals. Erase any humility they have. Wipe out any empathy. Erase any commonsense. Inflate their ego. Add in a very large helping of selfishness and greed. Result = a Tory.
It amazes me that people are shocked that this was going on. The whole thing was one big farce.
Exactly why I ignored the covid rules and vaccines. Fuck all the people that judged me this is why! I knew I was right
Absolutely dreadful.
Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi....
Very cheap people partying. Shame 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
How fake is this this is a set up Buy the new world order
Laughing at us, just like they always have been. 😡😡🤬🤬🤬
Have a think if you ever voted Tory - do these people care about me?
These are the people who are running this country into the ground
While my mother in law lay in bed on a ventilator with her fingers dropping off one by one. She lived, just.
Is it genuine though? It looks more like a scene from 'The Office' than an actual party. My verdict? Could do better Mirror.
Disgusting!
Stupid idiots
Dancing like a Tory should. FFS
Dancing on the dead !
The Met need to be hammered. Their quiet approach of, well we need to hand out some fines to satisfy the public so we will hammer the minor office staff( it will look hard line and they wont have the means to contest) and just one to Johnson and Sunak - Met being terrified of big wig lawyers. That will look as tho we are doing something.  Clearly, Johnson was at several. The Met stinks.
What about the people who had to pay illegal fines ?
If there's another more serious pandemic in our lifetime, and the government announces a lockdown, will the public comply as they did before?
Not one of them afraid of catching the dreaded covaids though were they and yet people still believe it was a life threatening thing.
Every party was laughing at us.
They are all a bunch of tossers that didn't care people were dying while they parted away, absolutely disgraceful
What a farce, the governments of today and in the future will ruin, have ruined this country. As for this lot, drunk on power, and Prosecco.
This perfectly illustrates the utter contempt the Tories have for the general public. Any of them that are due to receive honours should have them stopped. Scum of the earth and a shining example of how rotten to the core the Tories are!
I couldn't visit my grandparents and they eventually died. How do you expect me to get on with my life as normal when those in power mock me in this way? I want revenge!!!
Which proves lockdowns weren't necessary and have cost more lives than saved by some margin. If the risks were as high as the evil behavioural scientists stated the politicians would have been in hermetically sealed bunkers. Even the laughable Ferguson with his flawed programming and as with his models for Foot and Mouth an equally disasterous modelling programme, was apparently so relaxed about the risks he regularly crossed London to shag his married mistress. All while ordinary people we being arrested drinking coffee on a deserted beach or harrassed by Police in a queue for coffee as to where they lived and were fined for being too far from home in their opinion. Why aren't we asking the real questions?
Who's the tw@ in the stupid jumper fhooking wanchour 🤡💩
If this is true I want all this people punished greatly, Boris screwed it up for everyone, Boris was to later to act, Boris was warn 3weeks before Covid was heading towards the UK, still can remember the Italians warned us where I saw hundreds of people wearing masks, my 88 year old gran was very happy in her care home, until Covid struck, limited times to see her through a pane of glass, she didn’t know what was really going on, we saw less and less of her because of strict lockdowns and not to go out, But it’s ok for Boris and his merry people to party on, because of this, I will not vote for this party again, to upsetting to talk about it fully, but gran didn’t make it, she passed away during 1st lock down not of covid but of a broken heart. The care home was on full lock down then, and no staff and no patients got effected none, which was a miracle,  I got a light case of Covid in the December 2019 then it was broadcast to the Uk on the March, over 3 months, Uk is very relaxed of doing things it has done for years, but the events have pasted us and we have just got to remember those who are not with us today,  now the evidence is out there and telling to the world, I saw a news article online which was erased shortly after of the Covid virus 🦠 was originally a mild virus, but 3 scientists genetically modified the virus and an accident happened, that’s where it all started from a lab, in Wuhan China, look at the news now the evidence and one of the scientists is being named and shamed,
When will people realise that the Tories believe they are above ordinary folk. ELITE CLASS.
Sick bastards that think they are above the rest of us. Vote labour and make them pay!
Interesting: who leaked this and WHY? Stop being manipulated. Ask who is using your anger and for what purpose?  Why now?
Shows exactly what they are ,always have been and always will be
Bunch of drug addict
Not in the slightest bit surprised by anything in this video... but...  Gawd, reading through many of the comments here from the brain dead morons who proudly attempt to proclaim that Covid was all just some sort of hoax, that they ignored the lockdown rules themselves and laugh at others who did obey them, it just reinforces a simple FACT...  That FACT being... The UK sadly has a huge population of brain dead waste of space basket cases, completely naive, gullible, incapable of free thought and are the very reason why only after the good ole U S of Eh this little island of ours has no future when those are the kind of irrelevant useless wastes of space that are the UK's future (most likely all potential Tory voters, Tory MP's or Tory Prime Ministers)...  Hopefully another pandemic will come along soon that only affects the brain dead and wipes out all of the above aforementioned oxygen thieves that currently infect our land and are the reason why we live in a time where most are less educated than people were in the so called "Dark Ages"...  PS: Why isn't science looking into what is clearly some severe and incurable form of Dementia/ Alzheimers that has clearly destroyed the tiny minds of living brain dead that inhabit most of Grim Britain today !!! Then again they do serve one useful purpose I suppose and that is LAUGHING AT THEM...  PPS: For the Twatter/ social media generation who will proclaim that was too much to read or can't read it without the help of a grown up then... I am indeed talking about YOU... but you'll never know it because you are thicker than shite and won't have got past the first sentence... 😉
Imagine having to work with that lot, let alone having to socialise with them…..
Meanwhile my dad was in hospital and lonely because he couldn’t have any visitors.
Wow I honestly thought it was a monty python sketch....this is  insane.
Its Father's day today 18th June 2023 how do you think I feel?
This makes me feel sick to my stomach.  After lecturing the nation on it's our responsibility to stay away from living our lives whilst doing this.  This is narcaissm at it's finest.
For facks sake these clowns run the country !
I fucking despise tories 😤
My daughter died of cancer on the 12th August 2020. We couldn't see an oncologist because of covid. We obeyed the rules.
Working lunch surely?
This is all a distraction and made to frustrate viewers. Instead reject news, block all media outlets and spend the time you did spend on them doing fun stuff or learning new skills
Says it all could not see mum when she was in hospital with pneumonia which then 6 months later she died the Tories don't care about the people.
I dont think they  "bent"  the rules    .................    "Smithereens"   more apt.
Should be renamed Walleygate what a bunch of bastard hypothetical gits
those two definitely fucked on the parking lot after
Tory scum
They are literally taking the p**s. Absolutely disgusting, beyond contempt.
If u locked your stupid self away because the government demands it then its on u! Don't you see the very ones (Msm ) pushed it hard! They should be the ones you are angry with ? The government never tell the truth but media is worse.
I wish people would start a fucking riot already!!! 😡
It is an absolute disgrace what these people did. My brother died in that month from the consequences of corona. He was only 47 years old. A funeral with everyone from family, friends and colleagues was unfortunately not possible. When I see these images I get very angry. It shows once again that there are people who are shameless and think strict rules don't apply to them. The former prime minister has deliberately lied. Unreliable bastard, that's what he is.
Yes, the hypocrisy is totally rife and they all need to be punished. Having said that, the covid lockdown was an absurdity and should never have happened, the left side of political thinking, including the Mirror fully supported and indeed, encouraged this idiocy and mostly still do!
That's a party?? That's what I vision hell to look like
Nonces
Family members dying alone, some couldn’t even go to the funeral of their love ones, it had to be digitally stream and they pull this? Unreal.
Stupid rules. They should not be punished for breaking the rules but for making them.
Utterly morally corrupt political system from all sides. 58 years old and I will NEVER use my vote again.
Sick people 👀🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧these idiots are running the country god help us and signed us up to net zero
More honours for the country's finest tripe
Is this actually a party? And if it is, do the people attending know that it is a party? And if they do, were they actually attending, agenda-wise and according to their notebooks? And if they were, who did they share those notebooks with?
And Shaun Bailey who was at this party is now in the Lords.
I couldn't have a proper funeral for my daughter.  This is why I will never vote again,  the whole system needs a change
Whitest party ever 😂
Lamest party I have seen.
Criminals
They Should All be Locked up
nothing but utter scum
Everyone was stupid enough to believe it in the first place.  Always question things, don't just heard up like little sheep!! 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑. 💉💉💉💉💉💉🪪🪪🪪
Walgelijk!!
Its a disappointment to see such - lets not destroy (more) for the sake of. Many mistakes/misbehavior happened (covid lockdowns) - show it and in some let people learn from it.
Tory twits doing what they do best - being obnoxious, insensitive, uncaring, unthinking idiots!      Quelle surprise!.
Contemptuous arrogant bastards! Many persons lost loved ones and couldn't attend funerals ,yet these dirty slime scoff and mock. Should be imprisoned.
Come on this is unbelievable they were knighted after this 🎉you couldn’t make this up
I didn't know this episode of The Office
Oh wow humans acting like humans. That's incredibly wrong. I'm so outraged.
Conservatism is about Christianity and Jesus.  You scumbags. Worthless Brits.   You always say in History books in 3 days  the lower countries fell to the Nazis. It is five in the Netherlands. We held longer then the Belgians at Eben Emal.  This is also a Historical blunder. Go to Church and be treu conservativs and stop with politics spread the Gospel You fools.
few things are more disgusting than the people running the country
tory voters will still vote for their tory mp, because they are obedient, compliant and in need of mutual affirmation
The hatred I have for these people is on another level.
Some are more equal than others I guess.
These people think they are above and beyond the law, show no respect for the people that they govern. It still saddens and angers me…
Disgusts me to the max
I will never ever forgive what they do to me I couldn't see mother my mother till this I still remember when NHS CALL ME saying that your mother gotten weaker and weaker they gonna take the mask oxygen I don't no what they call it but anyway .I can only watch my mother from live cam stream .she was by herself in that room 2days watching my mum suffering she was begin me to huge her or touch my face she couldn't and I couldn't just seen my mum her last breath I screaming my in the living room I call for help no body come and passed away from that moment till now I see the image how she was struggling her breath when was dying .when couples weeks I see the news the prime minister and his members they have a party I will never ever forgive them what they did to me I belive this happen to others people as WELL.  ALL I CAN SAY TO ALL MPS AND PRIME MINISTERS NO FORGIVE THEM TILL THE JUDGMENT DAY
They were not breaking the covid rules.They were just attending a leaving party to boost moral during covid.🤣🤣🤣
Is that the same as hospital staff ?
Honestly i've done the same... cant throw any stones. They are just humans. (Unpolitical view)
They're clearly the labour party
i honestly think i’d rather be isolated than be at that shitshow
Knowing you're breaking the rules but stupid enough to film it anyway..
They need locking up.  Absolutely disgraceful.  Labour were just as bad, especially in Wales and we have the evidence for that too.
Dont blame em, covid wasn't that bad and most of us didn't follow the rules when we didn't have to. However they should be leading by example! Even if they bumping shoulders everyday and not different having a drink at end. But who sold the vid and for how much🐀 And im sure the labour party vids will be out in few years time
waaw that party looks boring as fuck
It's a known fact mp's untrustworthy bent lie it's shocking I sat at home alone through covid,every person in this video should be fined sacked and thrown out into the street,the person taking the video and released it has just stabbed all these in the back,this is how low they stoop all bad eggs and scum of the earth Boris was right he was set up by his own workmates yet again more sleeze.
SCUM OF THE EARTH!!! HAPPY I AM NOT BRITISH!!
And Tories still going to win
Bailey is a complete sell out!  That's why He is regular on GB NEWS with all the other corrupted, white rejects! 😳 He is a disgrace to black people! 👨🏽‍🎓
What’s worse than these posh Tory twirps is the ones walking round with their trousers down still supporting them, knowing full well they are being laughed at and mugged off daily. This country is embarrassing and simply let down by those who choose to support and vote for a party they know full well isn’t capable. The tories will always be rats, it’s the dense people still cheering them on that is the problem. Wake up people. Any party, not just labour, could outrun these freaks.
Shameful.... really angry that we all following the rules but Tory arseholes didn't 😡
These people are absolute vermin !!!!
I did too.
left or right, all of them need their heads off their shoulders
You absolutely lied to us and told us it was "law" to stay indoors and "stay at home".  What did you do? Party it up, no credibility, the charges dropped last year should be reinstated given the evidence.  You deserve no respect and take the shame.
Is this video for real? It looks like something out of The Day Today.
Yet Keir Starmer can have a party, sorry work meeting with beer and Pizza and get off scot free. Maybe because he is a sir and was head of public prosecutions, he is immune.
As much as I agree with helping Hospital flow with lockdowns, essentially locking everyone up whilst taking the absolute piss, even without being legally obliged to let loved ones suffer and die on their own, is a monumental fuck you to the public.
“We must kill 800 000 civilian Iraqis and call it collateral damage for the objective of filling our cars with oil”  “We must stay in our houses, feed our kids Satans monitor and mask you up like dogs”  “We must give this tax money for our proxy war in Ukraine so we can take geopolitical territory against our rival civilisation”
Gotta say, this party looks dead :/ This was not worth ruining your career over.
lmao yet I couldn’t visit my sick mother during that period and got stopped 6-7 times going to my night shift work for no reason 😂 mugs.
The atmosphere of party itself is the most criminal part
Fucking bastards
is that dancing or martial arts?
Labour just needs to show Starmer telling us what a woman is over and over and his party video over and over .
That knob dancing lol
But covid turned out to be a load of rubbish. So aren’t these pioneers of discovering the truth over false media hype? I’ve tested positive for covid twice and I felt absolutely nothing. I can only come to the conclusion from my own findings that covid was a dress rehearsal for the first global obedience test. Now we’re worshipping black criminals as martyrs (George Floyd), cross dressing paedophiles who dance in children’s assemblies and activists that destroy art pieces worth millions. Not to mention those just stop oil idiots who stop ambulances from saving lives. What are we actually doing seriously?
A spokesperson for the Shaun Bailey campaign said: “This is an old story. We repeatedly apologised for this event at the time. It was subject to a nearly year-long police investigation. The matter is closed.” It's the dumbness whoever ok's these statements to treat the public so stupid that we're not supposed to notice new evidence.  bozo xPM  not alone BS'ing voters eternally.
Cunts. Lockdown stole so much from me. Make them pay
This is further proof, as if it's needed, that we were never in the midst of a deadly virus.
After seeing videos like this I asked some of my friends if they still believe that the lockdown measures during covid were justified and if they worked.  The answer was : the science says it worked 😂😂😂😂
this was 3 years ago who cares
I was not allowed to go in the AMBULANCE WITH MY DAD & YET THESE TWATS ARE DANCING & having a party! Fire the lot of them & issue £10,000 fine to the organiser!
can someone please call a no convidence vote in these lot, fkin scumbags stealin lives and happiness at christmas
And English people laugh with 79 people who died on tragic accident Middle of the ocean 🌊 because they were immigrants,but they should protest about government which it’s breaking the rules cause the think they are above everything. All politicians are a big lier. I applauses the media for this cause they found out and I’f wasn’t for them we never could found out the politicians breaking the rules big time
scumbags
I honestly feel sorry for the families who couldn't see their loved ones as they died. Regardless of political views, everyone can admit that this is deplorable.
Looks ded. Tories are really living up to the reputation of the bullingdon club there.
Can we not round these people up and SACK THEM
Are you boring f&cks still going on about this crap?  Try reporting about something important like the Westernised version of Marxism that the left are trying to impose on us in the guise of Woke social justice.
And Johnson said he didn’t lie 😂😅
People were suffering, not being able to visit sick relatives, funeral and wedding guests to a minimum. The plod using extra force to make sure people were obeying the rules. People actually dying alone, no visitors at nursing homes Matt Hancock agreeing to administer Midazolam with drugs that diminish lung capacity. This is why so many died in nursing homes, I call that Manslaughter .  What an utter disgrace these people are . Not only Conservatives but Labour too. I still have to force myself to go shopping.  They should all be charged under a special law,
Sack them all!!!
Transport Police ignored people breaking rules on Scotrail trains throught lockdown. Teenagers running riot on the trains, no masks etc. Selfish members of the public held loads of illegal parties too. Then you have the rule makers doing the same. All have blood on their hands.
The Mirror is a propaganda arm of the left.
And don’t forget the fucking Labour Party also doing it, evil starmer was photographed doing the same but because he’s from the loony left. NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
This is NOT about "law breaking", it's about those in the inner circle knowing, full well, that there was NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF. Let that sink in.
was attending the party a punishment, that looks dire
Does this honestly shock anyone?
ALL THIS,  WHILE I COULD NOT SEE MY DIEING DAD IN HOSPITAL..! AND ONLY 11 ALOWED AT IS FUNEREAL..!  WHILE THOSE SICK, LIEING £U<K$  HAD PARTIES..!
Crazies
Looks like the worst party ever.
one party you would not want to be at, and not just because of covid
If covid was an ebola or plague level disease for the vast majority of the population then all government staff would have been fighting over spaces in specialist bunkers. The fact that they weren't shows that it was only harmful to a minority like flu ( who should have been specifically protected), and that the whole pandemic was massively hyped.  No one's reporting the current excess mortality rate though, that is higher than pandemic rates. Due to what and why ?
$¢um
Tory's would.. get skinner on to them. Question is, who's phone is that? GRASS 😂 i wonder what Lara thinks of this?. 😆
Merry Chrismas you mofo feckers 😂😂😂 I will have to punish the bird in red with my jingle balls and 3rd leg. Naughty girl 😂😂
Labour just need to show this over and over before the Election.
Clearly another Stratton incident , will these individuals now they have been caught bang to rights do the decent thing and throw themselves on their swords ? I think this is another slap in the face of organizations like COVID bereavement and this should tip the publics response ,after all enough is enough
Risking their lives during the peak of the deadly Covid, true heroes for sure...
everyone made fools of themselves. which was funny. all these people following rules. haha. i ignored it all.
Totally disgraceful. They should all be fined/sacked. We could not visit our pregnant daughter in lockdown and this lot were laughing at us.
should arrest and fine every last one of them
See you next Tuesday Tory wasters.
Bunch of Ugly fuckwits!
The police job is to protect the big thievs but arrest the small thieves
While my father was dying of cancer and I couldn't see him because of restrictions on travel ...these cunts were partying...ARE YOU FOR FUCKING REAL!!!!...
They partied nearly as well as me and my friends did during the plandemic. Public were taken for right mugs lol well, most of them.
They didn't belive the overhyped bullshit about convid  either
While this is bad, what is worse is that no party fixes illegal immigration.
the class system in this country needs to be utterly destroyed. sick of Toffs taking the p*** they all need to be at Nuremberg 2
every singe one needs to be fired. Total contempt for everything and every one. Vile
DISGUSTING SEND THEM ALL TO JAIL
Thats labour definitely winning the general election then
Typical hypocrisy that’s become standard practice for our politicians, doesn’t seem to matter which party they’re in as they’re all as bent as a nine bob note. If I had my way I’d have them publicly birched.
These things are going to come out bit by bit drib drib as more people get annoyed by what might be regarded as lack of fairness where some people get gongs in Johnson's resignation honours and most others don't. It would have been better if he did not have an honours list...
The entire country (UK) has been designed over the centuries,  to benefit these types of people and keep the rest of us in our place, unless we change that, this type of abuse of power, will happen, again and again and again.
VOTE TORIES OUT……
For anyone who has lost a loved one during COVID-19
What?! Politicians being dishonest and playing the public? Can't be, it's almost like the public is electing them and crying afterwards for elected individuals behaving like people doing people things
It want be surprised *, if all them people that lost there lives threw covid   *the familys will sue the goverment *
A*** holes I watched my friends get sick and some die caring for covid in hospital struggling with not appropriate masks and ineffective Ppe . I strongly dislike all of them . May karma hurry on and bite them
Look how pale some of the guys are... not just alcohol...cocaine aswell... When are politicians going to stop taking drugs...
the public laughed when they went to the beach in the pandemic including having illegal raves , wake up everyone done it .
There's a good reason why, Never vote Tory and Never trust a Tory are so relevant! This go's equally for the Labour Tory Party under the Zero integrity Establishment plant the odious Zionist supporting Tory SIR Kier Starmer, Tories are Tories whether they are Blue or Red!!!! Vote Left, VOTE GREEN AND STICK IT TO ALL TORIES BOTH BLUE AND RED!!!! 🤔🙄🖕🍋💨💩👎👎👎👎😬😱🤪🤤💚💚💚🌍.
They just dont care kick them all out of politics they think it's a big joke people  dying cant See your loved ones
as if we dont know the rules any apply to some... wakey wakey peeps has been going on a long time and will continue long after we are dust.
Everyone complaining needs to shut the fuck up. You all voted for this. Bunch of wining bitches
Tories are of a type. "'B'Stards".
Because they knew they were in no danger...while they terrified the public. Media are complicit.
Twats
Clearly these people didn't think Covid was a treat. Yet they shut down the entire country becouse they knew they could.
Name them all and shame them.
Disgusting
Most of the UK have no right to be angered at this footage. The majority of the public 'gave' the government full control over your lives and even your bodies (no jab, no job.) It was clear to a small number of us that the public had gone COVID bonkers. You bought into the lie. Now we're all paying for it!!!
Scum scum scum  Funny was it !! When people couldn't go see the relative s in hospital  Locked down not be able to go anywhere  You know what will happen to these people ( nothing  Like Johnson the tosser  Hope they rot in hell😡😡😡
Any tory voter now needs to serious rethink their moral standards in this party because its clear the whole political party is just one big corrupt rule breaking load of f**ks!
Starring one of Boris Johnson's former aides.
Laura's not happy!
There shouldnt be anyone prosecuted for breaking lockdown rules else you would have to prosecute the entire country. The people who should be prosecuted should be every single MP that voted to put the lockdown rules into law!
The Conservative Party...putting the 'n' in cuts. Vomitworthy individuals.
They knew it was BS Sweden didn't even lockdown.
I was wondering when Malcolm Tucker was going to walk in and bollock everyone, but this is reality - sort of
Tossers.
We ware lockdown and they ware having parties 😡😡😡
Totally looks like a party worth ruining your career and reputation over tbh
Those criminals knew perfectly well that lockdowns are extremely illegal then they laugh when they break it!!! They laugh while illegally destroying peoples lives!!! God Bless all politicians
Tory c🤬🤬🤬🤬!
Fairytale of NY, 😂 It was Christmas Eve babe In the drunk tank 🎵
Who cares about lock down party? Let's focus on economy and how to lower the taxes and scrap these ridiculous social benefits that make society LAZY !!!
Maybe the police will do there job now there is  evidence probably just send out questionnaires again this is a slap in the face to anyone that lost people during that time
Fucking scum bags.  TORIES = SCUM
Don't care about the parties. I care that they locked us down unjustly. Someone's drip feeding these videos for max damage.
Working class Tory voters were gifted by their government with having their family members die alone in an under staffed NHS without enough PPE. Good God! It must be horrible to be a low information Tory voting fool.
Who's here because the Mirror website's video player is rubbish?
Tory officials laugh about breaking lockdown rules | EXCLUSIVE     2057pm  17.623        folk over the road had parties folk down the road had parties people in general had parties (when they all claimed to be recovering from your covid or dealing with it)... who cares? not me. and this covid crap made no inroads into my life where depriving me of anything remotely personal is concerned... yer all unmitigated fraudulent expletives whether bending the rules breaking the rules or when crowing from on high with yer moral high ground... i just wonder if these guys had ever been to a get together... it kindda shows.. as for laura????  p.s looks like the builder's compound outhouse they used in the cruisers creek video... ahahahaha..
Ben Mallett needs to be interviewed under police caution tomorrow morning.
