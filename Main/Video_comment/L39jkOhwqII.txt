Wow, what time was this? I am planning to go this year
Meanwhile london is just on the ferris wheel 😂😢
Best fireworks ever
$50 million in Fireworks. Worth every damn penny
Had to revisit this I remember it from last year, it still holds up
O
Happy New Year
Now it’s 2024
Countdown for 2024😁
El mejor año en el que he vivido sin duda, gracias por todo 2023 ❤
Good
On my bucket list
what's the spot to watch this gorgeous firworks please?
meanwhile the fish: 🤩🤩
Song name
So excited to go this month for the first time! Have no clue where to go yet!
Where in Australia is this
New world coming
J
Those fireworks are amazing
I LOVE ALL CITIZEN AUSTRALIAN BUT NOT  I LOVE DE GOVERMENT  GOD BLESS AUSTRALIA.
First major country (sorry NZ) to celebrate the new year. Yes I know parts of Russia are ahead in timezone but that part of Russia doesn't count!
Driven over that bridge and the western harbour (Gladesville Bridge) many times and it just seems like its just a big chunk of steel. Amazing what they can do with it.
Take that Melbourne. You may now be our biggest city (although I think it's still Sydney if you include the satellite cities of Wollongong and Gosford) but we still are the global city of this country and you can't put on anywhere near this spectacle!
Fireworks happy new year abba
Awesome
Welcome 2023 this is middle of year
Song?
On that day I was at my cousins house they had fireworks so we decided to  pop them so we popped the first 2 then we kept one for Actual new year which was on 12 o clock so we waited then it was 12 then we ran outside to see other people’s  fireworks but the parents where already popping our firework with out us knowing so then people finished popping there’s and we went to see ours when we went it started raining so we just did it in the backyard then the brick slipped then. We ran inside I was screaming and all my cousins and parents where screaming and then it almost got on my auntie but lucky us god looked at us and helped us escape 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤
You can use these count down timers in your projects freely .https://youtu.be/69FwwZYXGUk
The silly belief that a New Year's Eve party is anything special rests on at least three fundamental misconceptions.  First: The coincidence of the calendar is a reason to celebrate. Second: the predetermined breaking point at twelve heats up the party mood. thirdly, the more people get drunk at the same time, the more awesome the whole thing is. The opposite is more likely to be the case
Beautiful city beautiful music video song Like this ?

Amazing.  (2023)
I didn't know you can set off fireworks off a bridge?

We’re so lucky we’re in Australia sydney to see this beatiful moment
Perfect spot for proposal beautiful fireworks 😍💓

Awesome show! I want to be there sometime. Does anyone know what music they used?
Sydney and London performed best in the whole world. Fact is fact.
It's a new year and Seeing how everyone is happy together with their family this festive season still breaks me. After my husband walked out on me and our three children, it's been hard trying to cope without him, providing for them alone and the house has been mentally and physically draining,  I can't even provide for my kid's basic 3 Square meals. But I could only hope for the best this year.
Wow
Sydney flexin pretty hard
Different new networks covering Sydney, Australia play different musc. I like the energetic, upbeat electronic dance music here. I don't know what music, if any was presented for the love show here.
Wow!  Sydney, Australia does it yet again for 2023!   Amazing, spectacular, professional fireworks done with an obviously large budget!
I will Become most successful person everybody knows  Me in 2023
What is the name of this song?
awww I missed it I was so tired! lol
Dec 2023 this year is going be difrient Kitty no more cove 19
So buautiful
Absolutely beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Wonderfully synchronized show.  2nd best in the world, next to London.  Some, like New York, were ominous.
When I heard about Australia,  I'm thinking of my Son Jayson de Chavez Soriano,  I  wonder how is he? Is one of my Son whose is the sweetest of my Chinese and when his crying  have problems even about his relationship with his girlfriend,  he comes open to me. And being a mother I gave him a advice and  He feels alright.  That's why I wondering how is he? And where is he? I miss you MY SON Jayson de Chavez Soriano..., i always love you and thinking of you my Son, by the way even Jennifer your sister she's also not home.  Just your brother Kuya Jobert and Your sister MARRY JANE DE CHAVEZ SORIANO.
One of the best New Years fireworks show I ever seen  Then was France ✌️🎼 they do a very good job selection of music 🎼🎼🎼🎼
Watch: "The End Will Come | Prophet Dr. David Owuor | November 6, 2022" on Repent and Come Out of The Great Tribulation.
ប៉ះជាមួយramboមិនខ្លាំងទៀត
I thought London's fire work display was great, but now that I see what Australia did....OMG! FANTASTIC!!🎊🎉🤘🤘Happy  New Year from New Jersey, USA!!
AMAZING
Happy New Year you draconian prison colony
Wow!!!!
😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I forgot something. I would have been in 1 of those boats looking up & really enjoyed all those colors. S.C. again
soooooooo beautiful!!!!!!!!! I was crying because I missed the American show. I missed the ball dropping. but this like the song says I'm feeling the love. they know how 2 do it. magnificent. thanks Australia. love from S.C.
Happy New Year Australia 🇦🇺😊👼🎆🎊🥳🌇🤩❤️😍
Amazing
That's the best I've ever seen! Well done Sydney 👏 When my daughter saw it she said, P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney!
Not much to celebrate over there anymore
WOW, that was beyond fantastic. Superb show Sydney. ❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤
Anyone know the name of the second song please?
Australia has nothing on my neighborhood.  It sounded like a warzone all night.  So much so that my huskies were left cowering under my bed and wouldn't come out until this morning.  Then they started up again this evening, and my one dog is hiding in the bathroom.
Fire the editor
With a pagan calendar Who said it's a new year Doesn't kake it so
Ah yes another year of tyrants taking away basic human rights you go Australia!!!
That was honestly one of the best fireworks displays I've ever seen
This is way better than the ball drop in my opinion, mostly because it's an actual celebration and not just a big advertisement
Great ad placement right in the middle of the show.
Stay free and don’t folly’s corrupt governments ordrs
Did anyone notice the pictures on the LARGE DISPLAYS ON THE BRIDGE at the end? TAKE A CLOSER LOOK!m😮😮😮😮😮
The were the words “FOLLOW THE LIGHTS HOME” over and over while the word “SATAN” is flashed on the bridge! 😮 FOLLOW THE LIGHTS TO SATAN ALL YOU GOOD SHEEP ….. 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
PROPAGANDA IS EVERYWHERE AND THE PEOPLE DIDN’T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE BEING BRAINWASHED TO DIE! 😮
Aren’t they supposed to be locked in their houses
Happy new year to all 🎉  Check out poland new year celebrations below, https://youtu.be/beymC1s3AZs
I do not know what this song is called but, when I have read the description I saw the people who sung the song
Anybody know the music?
Happy new year I play cookie run kingdom so I hope the fourth super duper rare cookie comes out this year. I hope you have a good 2023. 2023 is going to be better than 2022. I love the music. It gives me mr beanbone and moonlight cookie vibes.
Me: Don't use so much fireworks. My neighbours immediately:
I guess China is entertaining you!
We’re those fireworks made in China?
That was cool 😎👌👍😀😄🙂
What’s that opening song ?
What's the music is?
Australia is pretty good at celebrations, protecting civil rights.......not so great.
Can someone tell me the song playing during the fireworks?
Who is the dj? What's the song?
First song is Light Me Up by Stace Cadet and KLP.  Being released on Jan 11th.
Wow

Happy New Year to all the Kangaroos!!🥳🥳🤬🤬🦘🦘🦘🦘
I want this remix song official release.
They've put on a great show ngl, way more fun to watch than the corny Ball Drop.
I love how over in England, and Australia they make fantastic firework displays for New Year's eve. And then over here in America, the best thing we can do is confetti and a colored ball descending behind a tower... :/
Happy New Year🤩🎀

A ton of idiots in the comment section allow bright lights to lull them into forgetting  Australia had isolation camps and law enforcement bashing people's faces over a virus with a near 100% survival rate.
Buon  2023 di pace per il mondo intero  auguri da naples italy  🤗❤😘👍

What song is this?
HAPPY NEW YEAR AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺
* In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.   (Genesis 1:1) * And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.   (Genesis 1:4) * And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.   (Genesis 2:7) * Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.   (Isaiah 43:18-20) * They sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.   (Revelation 5:9-10) * Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.   (Revelation 22:14) * For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   (John 3:16) * Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   (Acts 16:31)
En efecto, fue el mejor espectáculo para recibir a 2023

Yes - one of the Worlds Best !!!!
Dubai's was much better.
Okay, can you let me in now ?
Bad ass. Wow.
Song?
It was a spectacular fireworks show. I am hesitant to say too much because the Australian homosexuals want me to move there. I refuse to encourage or condone homosexuality in any way, shape or form.
Wow!!! What a display!! Happy New Year Australia!!!
Australia is ruining the world farming market with JBS they are corrupt they are illegal they are miss treating animals they are trying to starve North America it’s a joke
Australia is not best at anything… weirdos and globalist companies and ruining world farming with JBS

You win
Happy new year Australia. Australia is the best fireworks
Sungguh menakjubkan.
Beautiful 🎇🎆🎉🎊🪅🧨🎆🎇🎊🎉🎈
I'll never understand why Australia hasn't hosted a World Cup, yet.  They deserve it.  Instead, the tournament is going to the U.S. again, with a bunch of unappreciative leftists waiting to ruin it with their social garbage.
https://youtu.be/poKtl0pSHr8
Just thinking what the aliens must be thinking. Why are these humans brightening up the sky globally. Sydney, New York, London, Dubai. They must be thinking that us humans are very weird lol.
can someone please tell me what's the song at 3:50  ? Love the tracks used here. Lyrics sounds like "hey now, you left me your phone, you left me your phone " lol
Wow. Fantastic from USA!
👍👍👍👍

I'm an aussie and I went to see it with my family friends and it was beautiful and we hadn't gone in a few years to see it together in person. I'm really lucky and happy I live in Australia❤
From the show to see, i’m sorry but i have to say, the global air that is really, and already very, terrible.
Sydney is the international gold standard for nye celebrations and I say that as a Melbournian
Congratuleicion from México
Amazing good party

You would think the Aliens would be summoned for an event like this......
Sydney fireworks are epic in size and complexity, with warm summers night,1.5 million people very little crime, and safe Amazing God bless Australia.

Happy New Year AUSTRALIA ❤ From AMERICA 🇺🇸
nice video-graphics composition. The city's beauty is nicely highlighted, in contrast to the busywork of the Dubi jerky confusion. Beautiful fireworks. Thanks.
So pretty and a spectacular display 🎉
compare this to new york that throws a bunch of trash all over the streets and thinks its great
Los mejores del mundo
That's the definition of a perfect entrance into 2023
Wow! What's the name of that song....and artist?
From AU and on behalf of every decent person on the face of the planet, HAPPY NEW YEAR to all but especially to those in Ukraine. Our thoughts, hearts, and prayers go out to all. Those that are now refugees living in other countries, those hunkering down where ever they can find safety, those that are no longer with us, and those facing the enemy head-on in the trenches.   May 2023 bring you much success and long-overdue happiness!
Australia knows how to do it right
Amazing .. Happy New Year💖🎉
Boring same thing over and over.
HAPPY NEWS YEARS 😍😃😃😃😃😃
Happy ne year bro.

Another new year ..another load of 'b******s'. The end of the world is coming. Believe all the PR and BS you want, just for one good night out... but all the c**p remains and more class division and control will come. Happy New Year to all the spineless wonders and lemmings. In the words of Gregg Lake,' ..hallelujah, Noel , be it heaven or hell; the Christmas we get, we deserve..'
its always about theceye and the giant
Happy new year everyone!!
2023 will be the worst year ever Remember that
Same old same every year.....ppl may be wow with missing last year's  celebration due to covid.

3 Minutes was good enough. But nice! Happy New Year!
Always impressive and spectacular. An awesome welcoming ceremony from the Country Down Under, ushering the New Year to us. May 2023 be your best year ever, in JESUS Mighty Name, Amen 🙏
The New Year is welcomed in homes,hotels,centers of cultures with dear friends. What is this , you are spending money on these light, you are scaring children and animals whith it. It so cold and not appropriate for the HUMAN race, not to mention that aggressive and faceless music,unfortunate. Where is this crazy world going?
name music?
