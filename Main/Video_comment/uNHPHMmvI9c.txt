One of the most iconic solo perfomances in cycling history
I would like LR to work a little with this please. Something as important to a racer as this demands a little more than 3 mins and 29 secs. FYI I predicted the 2023 world champion on march 16th 2017. No really.But admit I thought it would have been in Australia
I hate cyclists, they take up to much room … and plus the dress like sissies
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ouï je fais confiance technitoit témoignage venir trouver tout suite maintenant svp merci
Well done keep up the good work
Well, if you can't win the Men's race. Join the Women's race.. hahahahahahahahaha
Wondering How much did that kid got paid for that crash clip??
You guys should hire the TdF highlight  creators
Terrible highlights
nice ride.. MVDP GOT HEARTH
Such a great defeat from MVDP.
I think, for once, the UCI have come up trumps by amalgamating all the disciplines into one place
1 week to release the hightlights. I was waiting a movie!
wat an absolute BEAST of a rider
What a race what a time to be a cycling fan🎉
where is Jonas Vingegaard  🙂🙂
This recap is downright shameful
He Rides Like an Alien with endless Power.
Lanterne Rouge pls save us!
3 minutes highlight is an absolute joke
where remco?
WAS THAT UK PRIME MINISTER at the crash
You can do much better with highlights then this
We want to see the whole race.
Bravo à Mathieu Van der Poulidor !! 👍👍🇫🇷🇫🇷🏆🏆
Does anyone know who makes the Netherlands Kit?
🇪🇷🇪🇷🇪🇷🇪🇷🇪🇷😍😍😍
The prove, that Boa System is a real bullshit
did this on zwift
idk, hello 1975 England... 😎 -Love from '23 Amsterdam ❤
Too much cropping going on here AND it's late ... UCI, you can do better than this
Terrible highlights
I wasn't able to watch this race live due to travel. For two days I've been reading what an awesome race this was and was so excited to see the highlights. This is what you produce? Awful, awful stuff.
Pogi on the podium amazing
I hoped he would win last year in Oz but had his chance spoiled by some off track bullshit. Im so glad to see him don the championship stripes, I really think he's the best one day racer cycling has seen in a few years.
Love the spoiler right in the thumbnail, smart!
I've been opening youtube over and over since yesterday for the highlights and this is it? 😂😭
The pinnacle event of their own World Champs and all they can come up with is this?????
Worthy champ. Beast of a rider. 👏
Beast 🔥
These highlights and the coverage in general were an embarrassment to the sport….
GOAT!
Awsome !! Even if he fall and the binding on his right shoe is broken, he still won! This is the world champion! A world champion wearing the national flag of his home country.
Still looking for the XCM highlights.
Bravo,complimenti.Ha vinto una corsa, finalmente.
Are there any images of the final kilometers/finish of the riders who came into 5th-10th place? I think they didn't even show this in the live coverage?
The uci commentator add’s nothing ever, I have to put him on mute.
What's the purpose of the uci world rankings points?, Van der poel won the championship 2023 but he's not the most points can someone explain it to me I'm just new here 😢😅❤
congrats MVDP, you deserve it with no doubt. wow that attack😱 So sad for Tadej , next year champ for sure...you're the best!!
A lot of people saying how amazing it is for Pogi to beat Mads in a sprint. Well kudos to Mads for even keeping up with MVDP, WVA and Pogi. By the end Mads was way too toasted to put up any sprint.
Wow, what a beast!!
@uci you call this highlights?? just embarrassing the awful job you guys do to promote the sport
I was there...an unforgettable day.  I was happy that MvdP won fter THAT fall...some man!
One of the longest races of the season and all you could come up with was 3min of highlights SMH
The fact that I paid for GCN+ and can't watch ANY of the UCI World Champs races is absolute garbage ... I guess growing the US fan base isn't worth it?
XCM WC highlights, please!
MVDP #PHENOMENO EPIC 🇳🇱🔥🔥🔥🌈🇨🇴
Glad to watch this race live from YouTube... Amazing race and more amazing feat from MVDP, well deserve victory...
3 minutes!? really?
Definition of power.
Come on guys, go back re edit (show the battles and the highlights ) and repost.  You can do!
im a wout fan, but MDVP is a beast. Congrats!!
Kinda surprised that Lanterne rouge can provide much better content with basically no funding nor sponsored compared to the UCI….
King of one day race!!!👍
Not even do a live stream like what you always do every world champ race, Instead you guys did the BMX Race. And the higlights are awful and too short.
Where is the video about XCM???
MVP - Vindicated, check✔
disappointing highlights
3 min highlights for a 6+hours race, gee thanks UCI
3.28 lol
Sounded like the commentator calls him Crashew Van der Poel at 1:39!
worst highlights ever! when you hire an editor who knows nothing about cycing and coming from UCI? LAUGHABLE!
Can anyone has the link for the entire race ?
Can we have longer highlights please ... ?
We already knew what a beast MvP is, and he proved it again today.  After wrecking and breaking his shoe, he puts MORE time into the world's best riders.  Congrats and better luck next year WvA.
Compared to the 10 minute highlight reels that also tell the story of the day during this years TDF, this is absolute garbage. We all know MVDP won... paint us a picture.
What an amazing race. And how good is Van der Poel?!
Why the delay? Day and a half to release it? Seriously?
What a hero
great tactics - hitting just before the rain
Pay a better editor. This summary is a disgrace to this race and to the qualiber of the event.
For the love of god, just pay Lanterne Rouge to do it for you
Ahhh yeah cool.  6 hours of racing in 3.5 minutes, 24 hours late. Wow.....
What highlights? These are snap shots.
Poor editing and chopping the highlights. Pogi was third, where was he in the highlights. Whoever in UCI media that put this together needs remediation on how to put race highlights together 🤦‍♂️
Everybody stop bitching about the high-lights, spend some $$$, get a subscription. I flew to Scotland, drove to Glasgow, walked to George's St hill and was rewarded with Mvdp's attack right in front of me at the hump, after the park on their right. He swung left, hit the gas, said goodbye over the top! Would have never seen it/ filmed it if I was at home counting my $$$$.
That took so long for such awful content.😅
This highlight reel is an absolute insult to the actual race.
ㅈㄹ 멋있어 반더풀..
what a garbage recap of what seems to be a wonderful race.
Well done putting the winner in the thumbnail 🤦
lol why do you guys chop this race to sub4 mins
What a crappy video. What crappy highlights.  Where’s the rest of the video???
The UCI doing UCI things by just uploading this piece of cr*p  Guys, just realise that you don’t really have the competency to publish highlights, there are several choices available (lanterne rouge)
Cadê o XCM com o Henrique AVANCINI vencendo?
Thanks MVDP. You won me $1300 NZ dollars. Legend.
Monster van der Poel 🔥🔥🔥, what a great performance
01:40 that moment when Van der Poel crashes in-front of another cycling legend. Christina Mackenzie, Land's End to John O'Groats record holder.
Upload after 2 days wtf uci
Why not have proper highlights commensurate with the enormity of this race - like 15-20 minutes instead of 3 minutes?
You are the best Van der Poel
even gcn didn't post this
Congratulations bro 💪💪💪💪
If there was any kind of climb category 3 or higher we all know who would’ve won. The best and most complete cyclist in the world.
it's like the uci and most media outlets don't even try with these "highlights".....
U call this a highlight ?
A worthy winner on an appalling course. The best riders in the world deserve so much better than this, Scotland has so much to offer, not a Deliveroo/Uber Eats World Championship.
Pogacar beating Pedersen in a sprint after the way he was feeling is legendary stuff.
Almost fell asleep watching this🥴
Pog beats Mads in a sprint. The legend…
This highlights cut is an absolute joke, and an insult to what was an epic, action packed race! Shame on you UCI channel
Guys just hire Lanterne Rouge for your highlights, this video doesn’t show nor explain basically anything
took them 24 hours to make some highlights and they are 3 and a half minutes for a race that was 6 hours + and packed with drama and highlights. c'mon guys it's 2023 this is embarassing for cycling!
Dear UCI. Was watching the race partly live yesterday and looking forward for good highlights. Which these highlights are not. How do you have this 24h delay for these 3.5min?  I am really looking forward for something 5-10min on GCN or Lanterne Rouge. Other races do it so much better (Giro, TdF, Cape Epic...) Please try to improve here. Almost dont need to say what I now expect from a MTB marathon highlights video...
Amazing 🧡
Crash U Van Der Poel , and win anyway. Bravo.
Cropping this race in a 3:28 recap is an absolute insult 🥲.
No sense highlights . Is that a joke?
Why didn't the UCI Livestream this event as usual!!  👎👎👎👎👎👎
wonderful!
Miss too many highlights, italian team pushed , then trentin crashed, the morrocan in the brake who celebrate passing the line. The morning brake nothing ... the highlight of the highlight ;)
Hire the same people who made the videos for Le Tour
This highlights package was awful 😂 we need Lanterne Rouge to save us!!
I wasn't able to catch yesterday's race due to travel commitments (and a big time difference being in Canada). I had read numerous news articles on how exciting it was so naturally I was really looking forward to watching the highlights when I got the chance. From what I've read these highlights don't seem to do the race any justice...for a federation that oversees ALL of world cycling you'd expect coverage way beyond what they've offered. Please UCI take notes from all other sports and channels (GCN, TDF, World Rugby, Formula 1 to name a few) that produce quality and in-depth highlights. Extremely disappointing how long it took to release the highlights as well. The quality of these highlights directly affects the growth of this wonderful sport! Please do better UCI.
6hour racing, 3:28 highlights xD
Highlights of the tour de France is just different 🔥
So many morons skipping the barrier, and blocking the road.
On the bike Van Der Poel is an absolute machine, but off it he looks like he is 12.
Highlight reel could have been better?
Finally.. 24hrs later.. 😡☹️
