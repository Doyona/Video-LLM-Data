My team is Real midrid
Good
Very hope
👏
Boehly think Chelsea is better than everyone
How much did Real Madrid pay the referee for that red card ? (It's the only reason Spanish clubs have been so sucksessful in Europe)
Gutted for Napoli , shame they missed that penalty
Madrid getting to 11 semifinals in the last 13 years is crazy
Ronaldo's goal scoring at Real is legendary and will not be forgotten. But when Benzema retires there should be a statute of him outside the Bernabeu. His service to Real has won the hearts and minds of all that follow 👏
Lamped well and truly by a much stronger team
The ref though😢
Tommorow it’s Real Madrid vs chealse again and I’m going!
I'm a real Madrid fan and my dad is a Chelsea fan so he was heart broken when real Madrid won😢
james had a stinker
4:00 this is why real madrid is dodgy
fancy sacking Tuchel
1:33 4:50
1:09  2:32
What the hell is that music they are playing after Real score? Dreadful idea.
Chilwell is such a bad player 😳😳
How anybody, let alone the Chelsea board, for one second, thinks Frank Lampard is good enough to manage any team in the premier league, let alone Chelsea, needs to book themselves in for a brain scan.
if cucurella did what he's paid millions to do and stayed close to Rodrygo then Chilwell wouldn't of got sent off. I've had enough of this guy
Might be controversial but I thought Kepa looked quite good in that game
Funny thing is we all knew rm would win
Kepa The Blagger
if the english teams take out vini then they have a chance against real madrid
I’m a united fan but I genuinely think mendy would have had a stronger hand on birth of them goals to prevent them
Real didn't even hit top gear
I mean i feel like that red card was a bit weak
Two undefendable goals well taken .. but not much to fear from madrid
Real or Man City will win it this year
Frank Lampard hahahahaha
lampard here lol.,.well
Steve mcmanaman does my head in 😡😡😡😡
Koulibaly is utter dross
They Should Ban, Real Madrid Vs English Club
Currently I respect Modric and Benzema more than Ronaldo and Messi.   2 great players that don't get the headlines they deserve especially at their ages.
I am Chelsea fan, second game very difficult, very rear Real Madrid lose 3-0😂
What's wrong with this reptilian's hand 🤔
Real Madrid will rip Man City to shreds.
🎉
2:40   does anyone see??
Vini is incredible
Boehly: 3-0 win Actuality: erm try again
when are the men in the white coats going to come and take this madcap Chelsea owner away 🤣
If only Chelsea had Thomas tuchel.😢😞
does help having a decent keeper lol
Todd "what is he smoking down thier" Boehly
haha reece james got torn a new one
What a shot by modruco
chelsea heading back where they belong
chelsea are gonna get relegated now they lost abramovic
Agent Lamps now adopting the Pep, Jose, Arteta casual cardigan / jacket Euro Manager look.
Chelsea outclassed, Madrid with one foot in the semis.
Real Madrid vs AC Milan final will be mouthwatering 😮 a first ever final between the Champions League’s two most decorated clubs 😮 it’s gotta happen
Fofana 😆😆😆
Great game honestly Chelsea should have played a bit better unlucky to have been beat wish I was allowed followers and to be noticed
Gotta be Real Madrid vs Man City Final
Not many players make Reece James look like a snail.. vinicious however
Fofana and koulibaly are absolute nightmares
Was the stadium half empty?
I rather have zakaria and Kante and enzo second leg
Vini puts it on a plate for Benzema time after time
0:43 this passage here chelsea do everything right every game until the finish. We haven't had a top attack/front 3 since 16/17 season man
GOLLLLLLLLLLL
Reece james is so overrated 😂
Kepa is a joke of a goalie.
ramadan benzema here we go!
Real will always be the kings of Europe imo .
This chelsea team needs a good manager someone who can actually guide them, they have quality but no strategy
would have that real could win the champions league again. this was a very easy match for them
Some players need to learn to get more of a chip under the ball when 1 on 1 with keepers, they always go for low driven shots or directly at the keeper when they’ve gone to ground to come sweep it. Mount could’ve easily of had that goal in the last min if he didn’t just blast it at courtois or go where any experienced keeper knows it would be placed. Besides that great game
Frank Lampard is getting sacked in the morning if they don't win the second leg
My boy Benzi with another one
Chelsea became a Soulless club after the UK Government Stole it from Roman Abramovich, and gave it away to the Greedy Americans who knows nothing about football.
Hala madrid
Benzema owns Chelsea fr
I’ve never seen Chelsea so lacklustre while going forward. Why do top teams and coaches get it so terribly wrong when playing out from the back
Surprised to see Kante and Mount playing for Chelsea again.  Kepa really isn't what Chelsea need between the sticks, Mendy needs to be installed to Save Chelsea in the 2nd leg
Very lucky 😂
Kepa has to go.
Real Maaaaadrid are winning the champions league
Lampard's just playing real life FIFA..stealing a wage lol
Vini cooked Reece James 🔥🔥🔥
Lampard is two for two losses,perfect for him😂😂
Kepa is a good goalkeeper but he is no top, Chelsea need a top one
Anyone seen Mudryk?!?! 😂😂😂
Spanish go down so easy such a dead league
Will that ground ever be finished? Very strange...
The fact Boehly thought his team would win 3 nil shows he knows nothing about football at all! 🤯🤣
People really thought Chelsea were gonna win 😂😂
Like the way tussle started outside the box. Flys into the box to get a Pen.
Hala Madrid
Super frankie lampard! 😴
Madrid vs City semi then
Real Madrid to win the UCL this year.
I’m sorry but that chilwell foul wasn’t a red card he barely touched him
Chelsea put in a decent performance. If they could score they’d be in it for the second fixture
James got torn apart by Vinicius Jr all night yet BT Sport didn't spend 30 mins analysing every possible moment. But when TAA does the same...
Are the players who were involved in this game, better than Zeyach? Zeyach is top player and has more experience in the champion's league. I am happy for Zeyach that Chelsea lost
😂4th best team & firm in London. Still, they have done it on a shoestring...oh, hold on.
Fofana looks like he could be Jesus younger brother 😂
Conor Ghallagher, Felix, Sterling have never won the CL. Stop playing players that have no experience in winning this trophy at the bernebau. Should have gone with two mids and three attackers we showed way too much respect.
I don’t understand how RM didn’t score more goals...Chelsea can’t be that good!..Can they?
all we need is a proper striker that can fit in and play in more than 1 play style. Lukaku would fit into this team well but loads of chelsea fans don’t like him anymore
It had to be a red tbf. Cucurella went too far forwards and rodrygo was through so chilly did what he had to do🤷🏽‍♂️
Chelsea lucky to not concede 4 or 5😂
DONT WORRY THIS IS ALL PART OF TODD BOEHLY'S MASTERPLAN!!! WE TURN THEM OVER AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AND THEN WE'RE ON TO THE SUPERBOWL!!!!!!
Still a winnable game for Chelsea and Madrid are beatable
We need a no 9 Osgood Dixon .Drogba When will the penny drop ?
that's a very harsh red card.
That co commentators voice is grating my ears. Imagine living with that
Kantes through balls were so dangerous
Chelsea need another 700000 million pounds  What a signing Enso Fernando
Liverpool heavily linked with mount the way he gets that ball out of his feet and gets the shot off in split time is unreal Liverpool go and get him
Chelsea was really competitive team before this new owner. I still don’t get why he sacked Thomas Tuchel!!!. He completely destroyed Chelsea.
How much have they paid for this lot ,, Sunday league at best .
Real got some mad old players still in the starting 11 also love how half the crowd can’t see the match with them ugly banners everywhere 😅
All the stick Trent got and it just shows how good Vinicius is that he rinsed Fofana and James .
The absolute bias punditry yesterday backing their boy Lampard was pretty horrendous. Chelski were dominated but apparently they played "well".
our deffence must improve
i bet chelsea gonna win second leg 1-0
Cant lie that red card is a bit harsh, i get that hes last man but ive seen that exact same foul given with no cards at all in other games
nice one todd. long may the chelsea struggle continue 😂
whar   a  great  improvement's''
Imagine if we had didier up front chelsea legend that man what a player aaar the gud ol days😌
That lad Kepa in goal is lucky to even be playing the game professionally.
The fact that Chelsea fans thought they were gonna win and Tom bohely thought they were gonna win 3-0
could i have a shoutout and just subbed pls
Get mendy back as GK
James defending against vini was comical
0:28 Chelsea got the wrong manager back.
Chelsea did well to only lose by 2 goals, I thought Madrid would rinse them.
Chelsea are good
Well we all knew that was coming 😂
That ball from Alba though 🔥
Benzema has scored more goals then the combined Chelsea striker's 😂
Well done Lampard..
In reality, Chelsea have no chance of getting through
Chilwell should deserve it
Mendy is taller. Saves both of those. We'd have half a chance at the bridge if we had a striker that could actually put the ball in the net....
I'm so happy that we won!
Asensio coming from the bench is a different breed haha
Little Todd - all that money…..
Guy
real dont stand a chance against man city they have 12 Benzemas in Haarland pmsfl
Chelsea will have a match at home 🏠 They could go through. Chelsea always plays better at home 😊
Vini is just incredible
He might not have scored but jesus christ does Valverde like to thump it when he shoots
SIGN A BLOODY STRIKER
Frank lampard is definitely robbing a living. Worst ever Chelsea side I've seen in 32 years. Considering the players they have if teams below them start getting points I can see Chelsea in a relegation battle
Frank dressed like Marty mcfly on the touchline!
Chelsea is a laughing stock they got lampard as  manger alot worse then potter 😂😂
Why were Chelsea playing chigwell and cucurella 🤣
Cucurella needs to piss off for free he caused the red card cause hes an awful defender
Chelsea, Liverpool Celtic, there is  no difference in quality, Real Madrid are on another level
Chilly took one for the team because Cucurella got caught out AGAIN. Kepa let another shot from outside the area beat him.. ( where’s Mendy?) midfield lose heart because no one up front to finish. Thank god for Kante. Boehly is hapless
Potter wasn't the problem ??
Nice to see Lampard hasn’t lost his touch  Played 2 lost 2
I mean, I expect them to lose 5:0 soo……….
Oh dear god. Hope I miss frankie boi lamps. 🎉🎉🎉
I watched the match chelsea like played like 🧀
Frank's back to his ex and she's wondering why tf she let him
It was a farcical decision to put Lampard back as manager!! The man doesn't setup his defence. V.Junior and Rodrygo all glided past James and Chilwell effortlessly for the whole game, pulling the centre backs out of position. The goals came from 1) allowing players too much space and 2) not paying attention and 3) being too slow to react. The whole club is in a mess. With a deluded owner at the wheel. Sacking Potter mid way through the season was non sensical and hiring Lampard of all people was even worse. Poor Thiago Silva's reaction when he was subbed said it all. "What the f*ck am I doing here?"
Chelsea are literally the new banter fc club
AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHGAHAHAHAHAHHA
Chelsea will win 3-0 in London as Boehly predicted
Even though Chelsea lost and played terrible it was funny to hear the commentators saying Madrid were poor 😂😂😂
I didnt know touching someones arm was a red
Thiago silva is highly underated
Given Boehly thought Chelsea were going to win 3- 0 amply displays his ignorance of football.  Up there with all his vanity signings yet no striker & the sacking of Potter who was handed  a poisoned chalice of trying to blend the mishmash of players. & to compound matters then hires serial failure Lampard.............  Chelsea down were they belong I'm afraid.
American moment for Todd boehly. Thinking his chelsea side could pull of a 3-0 W, delusional
Chelsea going out and going down
imagine 3-0 comeback in 2nd leg
Imagine Chelsea making the comeback
They might have won if their corner back didn't get ejected
They’re unstoppable. They’ll win the CL again
Vini jr making a mockery of every RB
Thiago Silva is so overrated
I’m not a Chelsea fan, but they certainly had their chances…….but, what the hell was Chilwell thinking? PS. The pressures getting to Frank, he getting a monkeys arse now!🤭
And just like that we’re out this might be our worst season I’ve seen
Frank's back!
I thought Valverde was arrested
Should have been 8-0. Ascensio still playing?
What chelsea needs now is a striker nd a backup striker more like 2 experienced strikers nd one young star nd they will be good, cus I watched the game nd they played good but fofana needs to stop starting
Chelsea actually played ok till the sending off. Will be a miracle if they were to pull of the win in the second leg.
Goal music at 'the biggest club in the world'. Embarrassing...
Now Chelsea can contemplate the odious decision to sack TUCHEL......
Fofana is so trash
Tbf chelsea did better than i expected ngl
If Chelsea had a striker then this game could have been very different
That was the wetest red card i have ever seen
Madrid Vs City Final would be EPIC 🔥🔥⚽️⚽️🏆
I'm wondering if Felix will ever get a sweat-on during his time at Chelsea?
Benzema is just too good
Vini is a beast the ball control and 99 percent of times wins one vs one he is the most dangerous real Madrid player and before u say goals lol he does his job and creates looool and trust me will score if needed world class.
I hate this friggin irritating sporttttttttt
What a match
Typical British media - wanting the English side to lose. Headlines saying strike in Madrid! and sink.
Felix shows early why he's been passed around by clubs , no quality when it's needed. What the hell was Chilwell thinking lol idiot.
What a record in the premier league by FAT FRANK
boehly u mad man
Red card? Have a day off
Real Madrid v man city in the final, but real are the champions league team.
Men v Boys I’m afraid. Much like the boardroom at present, millions upon millions wasted on players not playing, millions upon millions spent on players who are simply not worth that type of money and to top it off an interim manager sacked for not being good enough in his last 2 jobs brought in to steady the ship. Frank who will get a free pass as he’s passionate about the club and one of our own despite proving beyond reasonable doubt he is nowhere near ready to be a Chelsea or any premier league manager.
Valverde shouldn't even be playing football right now.
Joao Felix couldn't score in a house of ill repute. 🤣😂😅😅😆 Pathetic player, considering the money is 'supposedly' worth.
The last time we won, we had an Italian and German managers. This time we have an English manager. Means we will not be winning it 😂
I could possibly be WAYYY behind on the rules of the game here but SURLY at 2:40 Thiago Silva got away with a back pass to Kepa Arrizabalaga did he not?
Huge gulf between the teams when it comes to making runs off the ball, if the other players put the same effort in as Kante they might have got something out of the game.
Real kept the score low on purpose. It should have been 4 or 5 nil. I hope their next flight ends in disaster
Some ofthe comments here show the absolute stupidity is involved in football, People slating Frank, he probably 100% thought he would never be chelsea manager again 8 days ago and now he's just taken on the Champions League winners ? but some people be like "Frank the gift that keeps giving" even some so called Chelsea fans giving up already, True blues know what Chelsea can do in Champions league underdog situations but everyone is sleeping on them already.
Kepa Arrizabalaga is one atrocious goalkeeper.
Chelsea are such a meme right now. 😂😂😂
I hate it when teams celebrate someone getting a red card.
What a game Kante, Tiago and Enzo had tonight, could have been 4-5 without them
Chelsea fans must be so sick of their club in every aspect imaginable
Белия кенеф пак се измъкна
😂😂😂 Chelsea outclassed
Benzema is on one again 💥
Chelsea are out if was 1-0 they can beat real but now bye bye Chelsea for second leg .
English Commentators Every Year every UCL games vs English Teams  “Nothing Fancy about this, Just a simple move, A simple give and go”  every time Real Madrid Score against an English Team 😅
They forgot to show Toni Kroos shot 84'
Chilwell owns himself in fpl.
600 million to be a mid table team is crazy littered with poor, past it players no centre forward spine of the team is weak.
Easy game for Real, the already took Liverpool out.
Hahaha sling it R-boys 😂😂😂 Brilliant
Honestly English Commentators can't help being bias against Spanish side when the win or winning. It was all about Chelsea & a commentator said madrid played nothing in second half. Flat display....really?
Imagine what Benzema could've been without having to service Ronaldo and Bale. But then again, Ronaldo.
Vincius junior beast
The Lampard way. Potter was probably a better manager. At least Potter had success at Brighton and carried them here in the champions league and now Lampard is ruining it!  Olu Igbekele Sports
Vini jr absolutely cooked Reece james and fofana
HALA MADRID . VAMOS 15 TROPHY !!!
13 losses in his last 16 games  lampards form is very consistent lol 😂
Vinicius jr. Está em todas. Grande puto.
Did T. Silva pass the ball to the keeper?
Vinicius smoking Reece James for jokes must be Trent's fault lol
What a dive by vinicius
Vini Jr is on another level, unplayable,but commentators act like he doesn’t exist, I wonder why…
Chelsea are sh!te
Chelsea have absolutly died this season lol the USA affect 😂👍
Not 1 piece of man marking, Madrid had all the freedom they needed. Chelsea got of lightly in my eyes
6 hours, 61 shots at goal. No goals scored in 6 hours of football.   What's happened to Chelsea?
Did anyone notice that Chelsea were still very much in the game at 0-1 before Chilwell was sent off? Then played half an hour with ten men.
Chelsea play like a league 1 team 😂
It's a real possibility now that the Emirates could be the only stadium in London to host CL football next season, not many would have predicted that at the start of this season eh.
Man City will smash Real Madrid sadly, so need Bayern to pull of a comeback which seems impossible 😭
It’s remarkable how bad Koulibaly is. Benzema anticipated the rebound way faster than him and got himself there first. He’s got exposed after leaving the Italian league. I would predict the same thing about Osimhen and the other dude at Napoli - once they leave, people will discover they are not that world class.
On behalf of the Chelsea fan base I would like to publicly apologise.   Not just for our terrible performance this season but also for our owner who not only has lost the plot but clearly he now wants to be a clown for a hobby 😤😩😭
2-0 was generous to Chelsea they were beyond poor
Vini Jr is the best player in Europe
Oh dear Chelsea are finished
Courtois is a special keeper
This Chelsea owner is a joke. He sacks thuchel a manager who gave these Chelsea players self belief and from an average team into European champions and thinks with lampard Chelsea were going to win 3-0 what an embarrassment.. This owner needs to shut his mouth and not comment on anything. Roman was silent and his success spoke.
Semi finals about to be crazyy city vs real
Lampard is a professional conman. How many millions will he rack in end of the season, when he leads Chelsea to a 13th place finish? 😅😅😅
Man benzema wish we could see him play the world cup man is such game 👏
Felix had 3 yards on militao and seemed to be running in mud.
It's not over
Chelsea were so second-best and short of ideas it was embarrassing.
King of Europe
Ramadan Kareem at his finicet
Can't believe lampard wasn't the answer for Chelsea 😲 it's like firing managers over bad spells doesn't work 😱
Frank is in serious danger of not winning a single game with this side, they look terrible, good player's not playing as a team, what's happened to Chelsea
Vini is RAPID
'All road leads to Istanbul'  One job.. 😂😂
All season Chelsea still continue to play social distance football LOL long balls miles apart that's the problem. Terrible team
Chelsea so close to that 3-0 win
What a gameee
is it just me or is madrid such a quiet team i get they win every game but i see little to no passion correct me if I am wrong though
How much of a liability is Chilwell? Brainless player.
This Chelsea team  is the weakest team I've ever seen they don't play seriously 😒 😒 😒 😳😳😳
Enzo what a waste of money
Chelsea could never have won this game but to go into the 2nd leg 1-0 down would have been almost a win for them. At 2-0 down however, I think it will be too much to ask for them to score 2 goals and keep a clean sheet at the Bridge...unless something weird like a Real red card happens...
To be honest, 2-0 at the Bernabeu with 10 men? Considering how bad Chelsea have been this season? It’s seriously not horrible. Odds? Low. Impossible? No.
As atletico supporter, we did well in sending Joao to Chelsea. What an average player. Disaster financial operation for us, perfect for benfica.
He is no 100 mil player
They brought back a sacked manager…things can only get better:)
Wow ! Real Madrid played this game so well , typical of them in big games camavinga controlled the midfield so well in this game not to mention valverde love to see city v Madrid again !🎉
ASENSIOOOOOOOO what a strike
The Chelsea players a still living off the past glory of a few years ago
Simple reminder that Messi won Fifa best player over Benzema lol. Ghost back to back UCL
For anyone who doesn't like seeing the English clubs do well in the CL KO's Madrid are your saviours, so far from last season to now they have beat Chelsea, Man City, Liverpool, Liverpool, Chelsea and soon to be dead Man City, who is Man City? Who is single handedly taking down the English clubs in this tournament? Madrid. They might aswell call it La Real Champions League from now on
Lamps balding... Must be a stressful job😂
Mcmanaman is the worst commentator. Sack him and give it to McCoist
Tap in merchant
600 million for this? Insane.
Reckon the 2nd leg will finish 3-3 on aggregate and I'll keep guessing, not a chelsea fan but defo a lampard fan
Ahh well, at least we can rely on City to carry the English as usual.
ramadan benzema is something else
Rüdiger should of been playing for Chelsea 😅
Lampard back at chelsea just shows how lost they are
Are all Chelsea staff blind?!! Do they see how the goalkeeper is rubbish?
This is Real Madrid. We don’t have to dominate in every aspect to win the tie, we are happy being clinical when it matters the most.
Joao Felix is not confident AT ALL. That is worrisome, extremely so. For what he is meant to do and to have no confidence is an absolute L for Chelsea. RLC should’ve played to dominate midfield. Unlucky red for Chillwel. Expected better defending from Fofana..
Chilwell is a liability, joke of a player.
Thats chelsea out
Poor Rory. Can’t wait for The club’s reaction to this
The reason Chelsea lost tonight was because they didn’t deploy their 4-4-3 formation
Chelsea, believe or not, they gonna win the second game and go through semi-finals
Lampard 😂😂😂😂😂
Rare to see ancelotti celebrate like this
Sacking Tuchel was so dumb and sacking Potter in the same season was also dumb
Wasn't felix offside
So happy when benzi scored but Ronaldo should have stayed
Vini JR, Rodrygo and Benzema have immaculate chemistry  And Vinicius is no.1 winger right now. Period
This Keppa is nowhere close to Chelsea level, he's bang on average. Chelsea must focus now on finding two players (GK & CF), well we need a manager too😆
Chelsea if they were smart should go and bid for Benzema in the summer
For the millionth time stop playing a back 5 if we want to compete. Our squad is a 433 type formation not a back 5. Jao felix didn't join to play a back 5
How beautiful this ball is
It’s too easy
I am a beginner YouTuber and would really appreciate any advice on how I can improve my videos.
Vini is a BALLER 💥
Lampard working wonders
To be fair this was at the Bernabeu and Chelsea had some good opportunities. I don' think it'd be totally unrealistic for them to come back in the second leg.
The only team that can rip apart this Real team is City. Without Haaland, they still created chance after chance and should have at the Etihad by 7 or 8 goals. This year, with Haaland around, Real better be on red alert.. City on their day will make any team like a dog chasing a bone.
Chelsea can do this.

Why’s the caption benzema strikes but he didn’t score?
Real Madrid Vs AC Milan final 😃
Gotta love Robbie Savages’ non bias commentary - so refreshing 😂
Real Madrid 2 - James Corden 0
Chelsea need a keeper
Not enough people talking about how overpriced Fofana was!
Reece James let Vinicius get past him so easy if that was Trent he’d be slaughtered
If Benzema wins the UCL I'm 100% sure he's gonna win the balloon dor over Messi lol.
Ramadan Karim is different 😉🤩
Reece James got ran riot
That 1st through ball for Felix was offside no?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What baffles me the most with BT commentary or just general English commentary is the audacious digs to Real Madrid as well as other teams outside of the premiership. There’s never praise for other teams, It’s always about how 💩 WE are, NOT how great THEY are. Are we forgetting Real Madrid are the current champions and have won this tournament 14 times, that’s more than the WHOLE premiership combined. Real Madrid, like Milan have won most of their champions leagues in seasons they did NOT win their own league. Which speaks volumes about their respective leagues.  I watched this game under CBS, it’s refreshing listening to Ray Hudson. He’s an absolute gem and his commentary actually matches what WE are actually seeing. He doesn’t sound like a bias mouthpiece or a bot switched on bitter mode.
Sack the lot, the players get paid obscene amounts of money and for what? Also, Frank Lampard was a great player who achieved everything at Chelsea but maybe as a manager he cannot cut it. Also, Man City will DEFINITELY win the Champions League this year.
ancelotti has what he wants with this madrid side, as fly as he is, total different prospect from his milan side from 2000's, more sublime, patient, ruthless when needed
Bro said Chelsea 3 nill
Real Madrid owns the CL. 🫡
glazers do not care do not put money in do not by united kits and do not buy from sponsers till the glazers are gone turn off the taps manchester united fans
LAMPARD NEEDS TO USE THE 3-4-3 FORMATION!!!!
The greatest team of all time.
glazers do not care do not put money in do not buy united kits and do not buy from sponsaers till glazers are gone turn off the taps manchester united fans
Shud never have got rid of rudiger smh
Chelsea all over the shop. Real Madrid showboating evidenced by the almost 'rabona' at 5:36
Real Madrid have had easy opponents in the knockout stages. Look where Liverpool and Chelsea are in the premier league. Man city final would be a good game.
Never a red, real vardrid
Asensio one of those players, like Isco, that needs to leave Real and shine he is so good man I'd take him at City tbh
Really quite surprised that Chelsea aren't already out. Still got some hope for the second leg. But then again they've got Frank at the wheel.
Nothing better than Chelsea losing hahaha
Enzo looking like a bargain with his performances since joining Chelsea!
Big Body Benzo !!
Carlo Ancholloti is underrated manager
Vincius destroying 2 English right backs in Trent and James already is crazy😂😂
Benzema is so deadly in front of goal.
‘Wash ye mouth out son and go get ye fathers gun’ 😂
Another ballondor for Benzema ان شاءالله
Real are winning it again aren’t they?!?
No disrespect intended, but with Frank back in charge did we really expect anyyhing other than a result like this?  Does Boehly have any clue as to what he's doing?
gona be city vs madrid again wow hope its like the 2022 game
Another loss on Frank’s CV 😂😂
As a Chelsea fan , im just happy Real MAdrid decided to show us some mercy for some reason. Those players, played as if they were playing a warmup match against a poor side that they didnt wanna embarass 7-0. We all know if they wanted to, this could easily have been 5-0.  I'm hurt to see Chelsea play like this. Its a pain unlike any other tbh. Its not the loss thata pains me. Its the lack of effort. The players were cowards out there. No one was willing to bet on themselves to take a shot. They couldn't even make successful passes. I lowkey wish i could just wake up tomorrow and no longer be a Chelsea fan, but sadly...it doesn't work like that.
Asensio goal remind me of militaos goal against Liverpool
Tie is wide open
Benzema is a beast !!! Algerian legend
No more kebabs for fat frank
What does that biggest flop Enzo do? My gosh what a waste of money
As a Chelsea fan at this point, I just don't get wound up about it anymore, yeah we're sh*t but what can I do🤣 I just enjoy football regardless and appreciate good teams and players for what they are. And hopefully with time Chelsea can get back to what they once were.
Stupid Chelsea fans thinking that they have a chance😅. The owner is a clown
Game over.  Chelsea are a train wreck of a team devoid of any tactical awareness.
Sterling should of stayed at Man City that’s what u get
Why is that stand covered?
Team of legends and a legendary manager. Can’t not back them to win it all again really
Washed Out Chelsea had zero chance here
I love how they all say well done for diving haha.
We've got super frank lampard! He know what rival fans need! Cucu at the back James Charles in attack Chelsea on the way to championship!!!🔥🔥
Love how everyone rinses Trent’s defending when Reece James was getting rinsed tonight by Vini
City are going to absolutely wipe the floor with Madrid in the semis
Lampard was kicked out before for being an incompetent clown, he's still an incompetent clown!🤡 Boehly will destroy CFC.
sacked next week
nah ancelotti still has a fantastic touch though even at his age
silva n kante only players that want to win
Haven't pulled that clear 😂There streets ahead of this Chelsea team.Unfortunately Chelsea are here to make up the numbers this year in my opinion.Real weren't great by their own standard but they typically show why they are European Giants once again.👌No English team will be lifting the trophy this year!!City will get to the final and fly the flag for England but it will be another statement that English premier League isn't where the best football is necessarily played.Napoli already deserve to lift this trophy and I pray that they do especially at the expense of a premier League team.Over and out 😂FORZA NAPOLI 🎉🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇹🇮🇪🏴‍☠️
Kepa is a terrible goalkeeper, he never surprises.
Bye Bye Chelsea.
Frank thought he was going to sneak one 😂😂😂
Lampshade just losing like Potter lol..
We've got super frank lampard! He know what rival fans need! Cucu at the back James Charles in attack Chelsea on the way to championship!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦾
What’s lampard going to do ? They sack him and then bring him back , what a joke Chelsea are
That midfield positioning at 3:50 by Chelsea is absolutely shocking😂a line of traffic cones plus Felix blocking the passing lane to the crowd
Vinicius jr has a vendetta against English right backs
Benzema vs haaland
Chelsea might aswel enjoy their last time in champions league. Newcastle will take over their position for the next decade with the Saudi trillionaires owners. Nor do I see man city, man utd, or Arsenal giving up the other spots.
Getting sacked in the morning....
Kepa is such a joke
Benzema is Mr Champions League
Up until this point I was uncertain who would win this year, but it's absolutely evident that it's now City's to lose
Madrid showed their class in moments but were somewhat underwhelming. Chelsea are incredibly fortunate not to be at the bottom of a much steeper mountain.
Chelsea should be thankful that we didn't rip them apart.   Ngl, if it wasn't for Thiago Sliva we would of won 5-0
Reece james humbled
I think if Chelsea had a spine like courtious in goal, Rudiger in defence Hazard in midfield, (no striker, Chelsea don't do strikers..) and Anchelotti as manager, I think Chelsea would do well. 🤔
The blues aren’t going to beat RM 3. 0 at the return fixture,they are as good as out.
Everton reject
If haaland scored that exact same goal. Rival fans would slate and riot at him. But for benzema I don’t see this hate the hate is unreal 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Bezema goal hangs a lot
That's not a bad result for Chelsea away
This thumbnail is getting familiar
Fat Frank @ the wheel fucken hilarious YNWA
Everyone knows Chelsea are masters of bus parking, but they didn't park it hard enough this time. Should've just had all 11 players stand on the line for 90 mins 🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍🧍 🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌
Madrid in the champions league are just too good
rory jennings ripping his hair out
"All road leads..."   What is this commentator smoking??
I don't like Chelsea but I hate Real Madrid.
1 madrid corner away from my 33/1
Chelshit
Tbh lampard's getting a bit too much stick atm. He's not even been in the job a week and we're expecting him to take a team that's been s*** all season and get a result away against the european champions. This was an improvement on the wolves match, he wasn't even back 24 hours before that match so it's no surprise chelsea lost again tbh. It's easy to target him but chelsea aren't exactly gonna be fixed in a week
Typical same old Chelsea performance an absolute disaster lmao. As a Man Utd fan it was funny to watch Chelsea getting completely outplayed
Covered the team names, turned off the volume, squinted and pretended it was Leeds. MOT lads. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ramadan Benz
Great job by Frank hope he gets the job full time, the fans deserve it 😂
Now I have watched this, I am off to Farley TV for the interviews 😂
352 formation with a false manager
1 man down against RM and only 2 - 0. Chelsea did well tbh.
James who I respect looked like a championship player with Vinicius causing carnage!
City will bury either of these
2 but it could have been 5
If Frank Lampard really cared about Chelsea he'd have refused that job. He's clearly not up to managment and he's ruined Chelsea's last chance of any glory this season.
Todd must be hating his life rn
Frank is a gift that keeps giving 😂
Whats the commentators name again hes got the best voice lol
Potter was the problem
Valaverdes shot power is insane
Mason Mount is perfect for us (LFC), he can’t beat Madrid either
Man City did much better against a much tougher opponent. they seem like the most dangerous side rn
Vini Jr has been player of the season for me in the cl so far. Turns up in every big game for real.
ramadan karim benzema is a beast
Cucarella is not a CB. Gets dragged out of position. His mistake led to the red card.
It’s enjoyable watching chelshit crumbling 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd say there was a small chance of a Chelsea comeback if they had a striker of any note but they don't, even Aubamayeng isn't in their European squad for some reason, I see Chelsea putting some early pressure on at the bridge but without scoring and then Real will score a goal or two on the break to put themselves into an unassailable lead.
Asensio only scores bangers
nice to see mcmanaman absolutley bumming real in everything he says as usual
Chelsea need strikers!
Ancelotti: the legend goes on!
Courtois brilliant unstoppable performance once again
Chelsea are said to be thinking of sacking Frank Lampard, and bringing in Frank Lampard for the remaining games of the season.
asencio always comes in clutch
It's mad RM have the potential again this year to win the champions league.....utter domination in that competition.
Too much bias this lampard, still used the clueless gallagher
Just hand Madrid the cup again now. It's theirs again. Don't know quite how they always do it, but they do and will again.
Brilliant game, there no stopping Real Madrid
Chavski were never going to beat Real at the Bernabau
ChelSEA all at sea. Lol😂
Chelsea were terrible. Madrid are no where near as good as they used to be. It was an average ucl team beating a terrible one.
Honestly for the sake of heritage Madrid are the only team that could realistically beat city and apart from citeh fans nobody wants city winning it 🤢
As pretty much expected
Lets be honest, if Haaland scored that Benzema goal, he'd be forever called a "tap in merchant". But because it's a Muslim Real Madrid player scoring it during Ramadan, it's an "insane goal"
I’m a Chelsea fan I hope we get relegated and lose to Brighton on Saturday 😂
Ha Chelsea will lose again in second  game. RM will be 3 1 winner
Benzema is gonna be one of the greatest players, ever to play in the champions league for some time.
Chelsea spent 75 mil on Fofana, 80 on Havertz, 75 on Kepa, 50 mil sterling, 50 mil Cucerella, and 80 mil Mudryk who didn't even get on the pitch tonight. These are just a few names. I know all teams make bad signings but that's shocking transfer business. No wonder they are where they are
Chelsea need new goalkeeper ..kepa 🤔👎
3:4:3 formation is needed put the old squad back in
Simone is a great manager he knew Felix was a waste space and a lazy overrated player, sterling as usual was useless, the whole team bar Thiago were useless and playing with no passion.
On how Chelsea is managing the club I will be surprised if they win another UCL in the next 10 years.
4 games in a row when we haven't scored....we need a miracle from above
Sterling is a good player but he only scores with a 3:4:3 formation like he scored at home against Dortmund which was a good goal
Who’s here after Boehlys prediction 🤣
Tell me why wasn't Ziyech playing?
What a player Vinicius has become man oh man I know Benzema is the main man and rightly so but Vinicius is involved in almost every single attack and he's always creating so many problems for the defenses of any team they play against
Sterling.  Absolutely rubbish.  Overpaid prima Dona.   We could all tell the commentator was totally biased.  English.
Lampard master class
Best Chelsea player on the pitch tonight??  Well he's 38 years old his name is T-SILVA
Enzo looks lost, wasted potential at a money hungry club
Sterling had many chances to make runs and walked
Vinicius Jnr Is underrated …That Lad is golden
Why are Real Madrid so good? Is it the game plan or the players that they select.
I don't understand where Chelsea spent 600 million? On what ..bought all down class players..one unprofessional got sent off
Benzema - goal in his style...
ALABA was about to go for the rabona cross at 5:35
Terrible defending for the second goal
It could of been 6 or 8 nill to real by half time, very unlucky, suprised KEPA didnt bottle it with the onslaught! Was impressed by real's pressing and 1 touch football. This team seems really together and knows their individual roles. Vincius Junior looks very dangerous! what a player!
Chelsea look like a side that needs to buy some players.
Welcome back frank😂
So much for winning 3-0 😂
could of put my house on real madrid to win this at the beginning of the week
Let's get rid of the owner that gave us the most successful 2 decades in club history and see how it works out 🤣🤣🤣
¡HALA MADRID! 🔥 Chelsea wasn't disappointing tonight, it was just a matter of levels.
Joaa Felix is curva gy
Great English in the VERY FIRST SENTENCE - "All road leads to Istanbul" 😂
Frank's doing well 😂😂but he's a nice bloke 😅
Chelsea are so lucky that real didn’t score like 5 on them 😂😂😂
I am so confused at Kepa's decessions.
Let's be honest. We all want to see City vs Real Madrid. Pep finally wins the elusive Cup or Real Madrid wins it for the 15th time. 😅
Still very much do-able for both teams. Chelsea will need to get lucky but still a chance
Joa felix always puts on pressure on keepers no end product he did same thing at athletico Madrid
And they gave him a two years contract extension:-)
Mannn Real are just that good.
Madrid looked like they were having a kickabout in the park
I would like to thank Ancelottii and Madrid on the behalf of Chelsea fans for sparing us, cause it could've been real bad.
The Lampard effect continues😂😂😂😂
Chessi in the dirt😂😂
Thiago Silva 38 years old, rushed back from injury &, puts in a great performance like that. What a player! If only Chelsea have strikers that can finish.
Carvaj motm
CHELSEA REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO WIN LOOOOL🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this english commentators are so bias 😂😂😂 shameful
Benzema will score goals until he's 100 just always in the right place lol
Still I have hope for chelsea home match ❤
Chelsea were just ripped apart with some early defensive bookings, especially leading to the goals and Chilwell's red card. The defence of Chelsea wasn't the best, letting Vinicius Jr in with a easy cut-back towards the box so Real Madrid can play a violent part in attacking against Chelsea's back-line, leading for Real to keep control of the game. Apart from the defence the Midfielders like Kante and Mount sparked great chances that weren't finished, Kante playing a 1v1 pass to Joao Felix but Eder Militao and the Defensive shape of Real Madrid's full performance was well. Although Real Madrid didn't control the game, they got the 2-0 win, ready for a night at Stamford bridge, WHAT WILL HAPPEN?
We’re waiting for the bridge don’t worry
i see frank doing well again
If Felix was as good as he's supposed to be he would have scored that chance in the 2nd minute.
Can’t believe there were chelsea fans happy with the appointment of lampard he’s a failure everywhere he goes.
Real Madrid are Clark Kent in La Liga and Superman in UCL💪
I think Vinicius jr is currently one of the best players in the world because he gets past opponents effortlessly and creates countless chances for real Madrid and he scores so many goals i think he will be in the top 5 in the world if he carries on like this.
Madrid will be kicking themselves for not getting at least one more goal because of the circumstances of them being a man up for half an hour of the game but Madrid are dangerous away from home too. They won at Chelsea last year and Liverpool this year
Still can’t believe how much we sold chilwell and fofana for 🤣🤣 Chelsea fans actually thinking they were gd deals
Surprised at how well chelsea started the game tbh, they were very confident and good patterns but madrid never got out of 2nd gear. They will face a whole new level if they get man city
Todd Boehly is the kind of person who would unplug your life support machine just to charge his phone
It's Lampard. What did Chelsea expected 😂 he's worse than Moyes.
Back in 2018 Thibaut Courtois left knowing full well what was to come at Chelsea
Can't complain tbh, we are still in the tie.
BT Sport commentators were particularly bitter about this one  Kudos to Madrid, efficient as always.
The second goal was like Messi last second goal vs real madrid
Super, suuupa Frank!
Chelsea should have been 1 nil up after 2 mins.. Some good chances. I still think they will go through to the semis. Madrid should of punished them tonight.
I heard somebody say it would be 3-0 Chelsea
What a shame 😂
Chelsea haven’t scored in over 360+ minutes 🤯🤯
Martinelli gets that Joao Felix chance and it's in the net.
Unfortunately, our team has become without personality, there is no fighting spirit, they play as if they are qualified . Benzima fasting Ramadan waww big difference between hem and our players
The fact that Boehly thought Chelsea were going to win 3-0 is just crazy😂
Boehly’s predictions for the match were as good as his management of Chelsea Football Club
Nothing without Roman's dirty oil money
Let’s be real chelsea fans, wtf were we rly gonna be, a danger 😆?
Get in real madrid
Real Madrid dominated, but Thiago Silva, 38 was sensational. Leadership, defensive awareness and experience of the Brazilian Rolls Royce is execeptional
Watching today's game,Real Madrid looked a normal team than expected gived than it was in Bernabue.Chelsea contained them well.Chelsea just lacked central striker no 9.With this performance Real Madrid will be a nice meal for Manchester city who are world class😂
Vinni had Reece James on toast tonight 😂😂😂😂
Silva still at it at 38. Ages like fine wine.
Another Lampard masterclass
Where are the famous c.f.c ?
Chelsea missing a number 9 up top is evident. Midfield was good at the start then it just felt like they gave up! They’re lacking motivation and ruthlessness nothing like Chelsea from before.
Both ties this week for English clubs have felt  like group stage games , the atmosphere at bernabau was awful today and the etihad was not dead but it didn’t feel massive but that could have been weather related cause it was shocking as it took a while to fill second half.
I saw a poll that people voted on and lots of people thought real Madrid would win and that's what they got.
Wouldn’t be surprised if Madrid win the UCL again
I remembered  when Chelsea  fans said Mudryk  is the next  Hazard after he dribbled 78 years  old Milner 😂😂😅
Ancelotti vs master tactician Frank the plank there was only gonna be one winner 😂
Also thought Carlo should take over at Chelsea in the summer lmaooo
Would've taken a 2 goal loss before the game started. Didn't see any reason to believe we can overturn that in the 2nd leg but at least there's something to play for. Felix is a criminal for that miss however, no justification for him to be made permanent.
Ramadan Benzema strikes again
Another vinzema goal 😅
Upside for Chelsea - At least Lucy Ward was off commentary tonight
Hala Madrid, y nada más.
Former Chelsea goalkeeper and defender did a great job against Chelsea
BT commentators did not disappoint. Always so biased. Madrid had the most comfortable/easy win of the season today. Playing like they are in training. Yeah, they weren't at their best and should really have won 4 or 5-0 but if Chelsea played like Madrid, they would be talking about what a dominating performance it was for Chelsea. Madrid showed why they are the most talented team in the world. Also 2-0 is actually a great result, since complacency is also in Madrid's DNA, it's good to not win by too much. Madrid will cook them at Chelsea
Benzema during ramadan is just different gravy 🔥 🎉
Benzema is 35 and fasting and scoring hat tricks wow mashalllah
If they do their jobs in the second leg, what a game between City and real we have on our hands 🙌🏼
I’d say only team to stop them right now is Man City
Todd needs to sell the club, it will bring pain on continuously
Top away performance from Chelsea, super Frank turning things around already
I don’t think anyone realises how bad we were today. Playing so cautiously against a team that don’t really press just invites pressure. With that performance we’re basically out anyway.
Vinicious Jr top player for sometime
BT Sport's commentary on this game was shameful. The English bias was unbearable 😭
Chelseas defending is awful. They should go for that CB Rudiger ................
*WHAT WAS BEN CHILLWELL THINKING!??!?*
1st
Lampard continues where he left off
Chelsea had chances. I feel for frank. Courtais was great
Chelsea : "At least we didn't get any yellow card suspensions...  Oops Cinderella got Chilwell sent off 😲"
I genuinely think asensio deserves to go to a club that would respect him more, he is one of the most underrated footballers in europe
What more can we do, all I can say is I’m thankful to Real Madrid for not ripping us to pieces. I know laminates intentions was to hit Madrid on the counter but chilwell and James kept pushing up and for the first goal our midfield was way to packed and that allowed Carvajal to play a beautifully lifted pass into benzema
get cucurella out my bloody club
The fact that Chelsea have spent around 600 million and are an absolute shambles right now they could get in trouble with FFP
Give them the trophy already
Chelsea- a points giver of a club!
Madrid had no fans so they covered the seat with sheets lmao thought this was Man City for a sec
Lampard doing the biz
I would’ve preferred if we had lost against Dortmund in the previous round. No bloody point of this tie with our terrible run of form. We need to focus domestically
Ramadan Karim at it again
big benz bro 🥶
Benzema is unreal, honestly the best striker in the world right now.
Imagine Chelsea getting relegated after spending 600M
Another great performance by lampard they are impotent in front of goal Madrid never got out of first gear it should have been a mauling by madrid
Real Madrid whenever in the Champions League: Imma knock this MF out!
Valverde putting all his anger in that shot and is imagining that the ball will hit baena 😂🤣
Chelsea back to them normal selves
Did Chelsea sign Frank Lampard as caretaker, or Frank Spencer? 😂
1st comment
Chelsea played a good game, hopefully they can get the win next Tuesday, COYB 💙💙
Not bad for a mid-table side
Benzema just always comes in clutch

Seen so many Chelsea fans in the build up to this tie saying how it would be so like Chelsea to win a big UCL game like this whilst having such an awful season. 😂😂 So deluded. The Roman era is done. Boehly's is the banter era. Get used to it.
Todd Boehly: Chelsea winning 3-0 🤡🤡
What an impact off the bench by Asensio.
Ramadan benzema coming clutch
