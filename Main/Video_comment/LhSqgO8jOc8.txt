The Cycling GK is also hitting Bangladesh mate ! Best of luck !
Saint maximin is the best skilled in the league
Love your VLOGs Ben and the behind the scenes look at pro football clubs are fascinating. For instance the regular COVID testing that all footballers are subject to. However I have to say that the swabs administered by Donna at min 0.29 was an absolute joke. The swab barely went up your nose. Have done a few of these and that swab is supposed to go so far up your nose it hurts.
Could you give some goalie tips for even tho i am a forward i want to be a keeper
love ur vlogs!!😍
1:35 Adam haha
i love saint maximin hes my hero
That covid-test isn’t done properly, just saying

Saint Maximin is probably the most skill full player in the prem when it comes to tricks and flair
Love the videos! I think Saint-Maximin really lives up to his name as a Saint, his control and speed on the ball is incredible and I idolise him when it comes to my game. He's a wonder to watch, just like The Cycling GK!!

Hey Ben another cycling gk here hope u have a great day

This is legendary. What a guy
Maybe you should be practicing your kicking??? Or donating wages to charity . This blatant exlpoitation of your position at wfc to the clubs detriment is awful to watch also shows exactly how you spend your days with the squad don't expect me to waste my money any more on you . You will dismiss my comments but wfc season ticket holder for 20 years who won't go back
Hi ben can you pls keep putting the gopro in the middle of the goal because its so much better Thanks mate cracking game!

"Fozzy is a right ledge mush"😂😂😂😂😂
Why not vlog some of the big games always just teams like Brighton Aston villa how about we see a liverpool or city game??
My man's is a hero for the Gucci headbands
POV: You were crapping your pants when you saw where Ben’s laptop was sitting😬
Why haven’t we seen behind the goal footage this season? Looking forward to the Liverpool game
Saint-Maximin is such an amazing player from dribbling to his skills its amazing.
I wish you were allowed to have the Go-Pro in goal. I dont see how it affects the Prem. Cus it would be nice to see what is like with the Big teams and the packed out stadium etc. Cus you have some big teams coming up soon so it would be nice to see what is like against them.
Allan Twitter is goated
ASM is such a great player. A champions league level baller, at a team which doesn't usually live up to his own level. Really hopes he joins a great team in the future
Allan saint maximain is a true beast winger!

Honestly think Allan is criminally underrated. Such a talent on the ball. Can’t wait to see him shine under the new regime at Newcastle. We haven’t seen his best yet by far. Wish we had him at Liverpool.         …And having his MW shirt would be amazing also 😂
I really want the shirt because I'm a newcastle fan and I've never had a game worn shirt but you have probably all ready give it away😣
Saint-maximin is a baller, really would love his shirt!
Saint maximin is an absolute joke
I think his very sharp and very straight forward in atacking, not too much skills.  Would love that shirt, greqt game for you tho boss

Saint maximin is possibly the best one on one dribbler in the prem, under a top manager he’d be dangerous
ASM is a quality player, one of those you'd have on any team, he's proved that anything is possible!
Saint maximin is a baller. Should move to a bigger club
You are the best!
ASM is more than a baller, he has swag for days in the way he plays to the way he dresses the guy is literally on fire.

ASM is so good to watch
ASM - a player in a couple years time the streets will never forget
Saint Maximin is a baller
Best thing to come out of France since the croissant
Best thing about Maxi is you dont know what way he's going to go next, and he can make defenders look silly he's that good, would be a great squad player for a top 6 side. Keep up the good work Ben, love the channel! 👍

Absolute baller
ASM. It’s the kind of player the young aspiring players need to look up to. Very hardworking and always makes himself available. In it for the team, not himself.

As a Die Hard Newcastle Fan We have seen a few good players come and go! But he is loyal, he has had the chance to leave but stays by the club who believed in him from the start. Great baller who hopefully can lift us to new hights. Love the vlogs keep it up 😉🖤
Allan Saint-Maximin is such a skillful player and a joy to watch… He is also not too bad on fifa!😅 Great vid👍🏽

Allan Saint-Maximin is absolutly amazing!
Absolute baller
Allan is good but not as good as you on the ball ;)
ASM has been outstanding in Theselius first game of the season
The best footballer on Twitter, it’s good to see more players being themselves online, not a bad player too!
ASM is probably tone of the biggest ballers in the Prem. Contraversial decision but I feel at another club he would properly thrive.
Saint maximin is by far my favourite player for NUFC. I know he only has 2 feet but sometimes he is so fast it looks like he has 3!! I would love to have his game worn shirt Ben. Love the  vlogs too! 😃
It’s probably too late but I really want that shirt. ASM is an absolute BALLER, always pulling off the unexpected, he’s so skilful and I’m genuinely happy when I watch him play
I would like gucci maximin shirt please
Thankyou for being real, genuine and positive :)
Allan Saint-Maximin is one of the most talented players in the prem!
I’m at 45782 overall ranking in fpl Anyone higher than me???
asm is very good i hope he can stay fit for whole season so we can all watch him a lot
Unbelievable player that Saint Maximin

He’s superb 👍🏼
Great player and a great skiller Big up  Love you mate keep up bro   Love from denamrk
St Maximin is as entertaining on the pitch as you are on your vlogs!
Great video Ben. You're a real tonic for anyone nit having things so good these days, keep them smiling. Dunno what your FF is like now but it needs a bit of tinkering, no pun with your new gaffer intended. Balance is a bit skewed having both Ron and Rom.  Could risk it for a biscuit and free up funds: Lloris to Ramsdale, gungho maverick Ronaldo or Lukaku (who's recently disappointed) to Whang and get Son, maybe De Bruyne in the midfield. Anyways best of luck for yourself and Watford for the rest of the season and stay well and happy.
ASM is unreal..great player!
ASM is a brilliant player. No matter how Newcastle does, he's always at the spear point of their attack this season and always bringing his A game.
I want the shirt so bad
St.maximin is a great player you did great to keep him quiet
Am a Newcastle fan.Ben foster u are awesome keeper I love your channel I watch always
Put maximin in a top 6 team he’s the best winger in the league

Hiya mate I'm in Newcastle for uni at the moment would love that saint Maxine shirt to hang up in my accomodation ❤
ASM is too good for us (NUFC)!
he's an all round great guy
i reackon ASM is going places he’s so skilful on the ball and he surely must be in yours and other keepers nightmares whenever you are coming up against him. I wish to see him play at arsenal one day
I’m a Cov fan and you stay in the prem your outstanding
Allan st maximin is the best player Newcastle has to offer, coming from a Newcastle fan he just fills you with hope every time he has the ball which no other player we have can offer when we are battling relegation
We probably should have beat you by 2 or 3 but you played a blinder
The best to ever do it🖤🤍
You should give away your shirt after games as double the winners and ur a legend
ASM is my friend Callum’s hero would be a great gift to win for him
ASM is a baller but needs to go to a bigger club IMO
we miss the go pro in the goal
ASM deserves a national team call up 💯😍
Saint-Maximin is a baller, teams must be more than scared to play him. What a lad!
Saint Maximin is great for the premier league but Newcastle have to play him in his best position where he can get on the ball and run at players
Go on then 🔥🔥🔥🔥
ASM is a baller, so good! Need him at my club 😂😂
I’m not gonna lie I’m loving seeing u In the team and I LOVE the blogs but It doesn’t feel the same as when u had Will Hughes :(
"Sorry, it's just started raining" that's alright mate we're dry here sat at home watching 😂
He’s in my fantasy team what a baller
Saint maximin is quick skillfull and also great in fifa with the 5 star skills. Wish I was that good. All the best 😄
What sells model do you use ?
“Saint-Maximin, on the wing, he got one man down just being him…“ the song says it all, he’s just a great player and it’s fun to watch him.
ASM is an absolute baller. He is electric. He’s so sharp it’s a joke, he worries me honestly.
Surely he's Gucci's best sponsor 🤯🤯
Alan saint maximum is so underrated and he’s a baller he could do anything
Maxi is amazing Probably too good for us unfortunately, be lucky to keep ahold of him in the January window

Alan is the definition of a baller
Ben please can I have the shirt, it would mean so much to get it from one of my favourite players?
Allan Saint-Maximin can provide a spark at any moment of the game. His technique and skill is remarkable. Replaces the flair Ben Arfa had years back for Newcastle with more attacking prowess.
Baller
ASM has definitely shown improvement since he started and its crazy to think of what he'll do next!!
Saint maximin jersey
Saint-Maximin is one of the most skilful player and a Great player to watch love your vids👍❤️
ASM BIG TIME BALLER
ASM he’s far too good for Newcastle I’m amazed he’s not been snapped up. Can’t believe we’ve got another manager , welcome Claudio
oi
Saint max is a 🐐
Legend
The best
Saint maximum is a mental player could you imagine him and adama traore in the same team the defence would kittens just at the thought of them 2 running at them
Love to see Allan Saint-Maximin in the prem... but how many watts can he produce on the bike? I guess we'll never know haha
maximum is crazy good and sharp as a knife
Proper Baller 💯💯
Saint-Maximin is a mercurial talent but the thing that will take him to the top of the game is not his pace, strength and trickery but his attitude and desire. He works his socks off and cares about the club and fans. Unfortunately he will leave at some point but he’ll take that great attitude with him, combine it with his skills and make a name for himself on the world stage.
Il literally put it up in my fire station, on the wall , the guy is flames 🔥🔥
Love all the features you get on the channel - who'd expect Ramsdale and Pie Face in the same vid!
Very good player. Loving the blogs as always.
ASM is top 10 in the Prem! Absolute Baller!!!!
ASM is one of the most exciting players outside to the top 4. should be at a better club (Football wise)
Great vlogs. Would love the jersey. From a Leeds United fan <3
Saint-maximum one word baller
Alan Saint-Maximin is so broken that I feel I watch fifa instead of Real football when I watch him playing. Insane !!!!
One word for saint maximin underrated
Mate I’m a NUFC fam and itd mean the world if I got his shirt
Our maxi what a belta on and off the pitch ⚫️⚪️
Saint maximin is a freak on the ball, maybe the best dribbler in the prem!
Plz i love Newcastle fans and sm10 is one of my fav players from pl no cap
Saint maximan absolute baller.
Love it !!
Absolute machine , Gucci
guys a baller
alan saint maximan is a future baller, he just has to get into a better team and i think he will fit in better and take his talent to another level
Hi ben just wondering what gloves you use
ASM is an absolute baller... That is all!
the most exciting player to watch in the prem
ASM is fuckin insane and Liverpool should sign him
Saint-Maximin is a future superstar !
Saint maximin baller🔥🔥
Allan Saint-Maximin is a joy to watch, just as long as it isn't against Watford. ASM will always get or create a chance, thankfully the boys slept him reasonably under wraps.
Saint-maximun, as a Newcastle fan he is the best player on the ball I’ve seen at the club in my life. Great player and gets me out of my chair every time he’s got the ball
saint max too nice with it
The bloke is a beast
Saint maximin is an absolute dribble god like salah. Its a pity that his talents are at newcastle. Hope in the next season he will get a big money move to top 6 clubs to prove his ability as a speed dribbler like sarr and zaha
Saint maximin underrated baller with amazing energy and lightning speed,the skills help too
Was at the game and every time Saint-Maximin got the ball he looked a real threat.
Maximin is the best, so underrated
Collab with Bfordlancer48
saint-maximin is quickly turning into one of my favourite players
Huge Newcastle fan , Love ASM. Dangerous man on the pitch at all times.
Ben I’m a Leeds Utd fan but I love you’re channel - it’s great to get a pro footballers perspective on the day to days within a premier league environment. Class mate … keep it up
Xisco Munoz got sacked. What are your thoughts?
Asm is ridiculous but he should be playing down the wing 🤷🏽‍♂️
Allan is amazing. Would love the shirt
Obviously Saint-Maximin is cracking to watch. Had to bring him into my FPL team a few GWs ago which has been a very good decision, man could've scored at least 5 in the last 3 games I swear.
Huge Newcastle fan and St Maximin is such a baller he’s carrying this Newcastle team👌🔥Big up Ben Foster as well what a legend, making some huge saves in that game!
ASM absolute baller, no one’s sure what he’s gonna do next most of the time and i’m not sure he does either. so wild
asm is an absolute baller
Saint maximan what a player he’s world class should be at spurs maybe?👀
Maxi is far to quick
Saint maximin is one of the best players outside the top 6 simple as that
I think the best thing about ASM is that although he's a typical tricky flair player, he always seems to put a shift in and actually still enjoys playing.
Saint - Maximan is absolutely unreal, so unpredictable
Some say the gucci head band never comes off
Asm is such and underrated guy. Always gives a mind boggling performance. Treat to watch
Get well soon big bazzla ❤️
st maximin the goat
Allan saint max is a tt player should’ve scored against u!
As entertaining as always!  Love your videos and keep going mate, I would love to see that shirt of Saint-Maximin in my hands. Dreams would come true 🔥
Absolute baller, Best French-man in the league🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Gucci the 🐐
ASM class player every time he steps on that pitch too fast need him in my ultimate team 🤣
Hey Ben I think Saint-Maxmin is class when he went to Newcastle he was always going to be the biggest threat. What a baller
Ben you just stink of positivity keep it up mate!  Saint Maximin on the otherhand is sure to be going places soon. Has improved his play so much and is somehow still only 24. What a player. Such a treat to watch him!
Simple really, how can you not love ASM. What a player. One of the few players who bring pure magic on the pitch with their playstyle. A pleasure to watch.
Do a collab with Bfordlancer48!!! plsssss
A S-M is easily one of the most underrated players outside of the top 6 and no doubt will get a massive well deserved move eventually
You’re the 🐐 mate! Would love to win the shirt🙏
Saint Max gonna get himself a big move playing out of his skin
Saint maximum is so good so skilful I could imagine how scary it is to play against him I am amazed with what he does on and of the pitch
Saint maximin is a class player to watch and every single time he plays my team, he pulls out all the stops. Defo going to be one of the best in the next few years whether at newcastle or not
Saint maximan unpopular opinion top 5 dribblers in the world right now
ASM is an amazing french winger. Every defence should be terrified of him
Saint maximin gives me hatem Ben arfa vibes what a talent 🧊cold 🇫🇷 🪄
Saint maximin is amazing

Saint-maximin is too slick on the ball. V entertaining to watch, not fun to play against in FIFA though
Saint-Maximin is one of the most dynamic football players I've watched, love to watch him and he’s ripping it up at Newcastle.
Saint max is so saucy, I'm at Uni in Newcastle and love seeing Gucci headband play week in week out 🕺🕺
Time to bring ASM into my fantasy team!

Allan Saint-Maximin what a player! he is unstoppable at times!! if he gets a bit more help from his teammates playing upfront, he will score a lot more goals, and what a treat he will be for us FPL Managers! Ben, you gotta sign up Allan!
ASM well underrated, think hes missing the partnership with Wlison atm, but can still create something from nothing! Always worth a punt on the fantasy football as well!   P.s how have i only just noticed this channel!

Ben what do you think about Xisco being sacked?
Most friendlies lad in football
Knew that had to be a Midlands accent. Lol. The way you said “Salah”, “what” and “you” was the giveaway and your Wiki confirmed that lol. Midlands accents outside of Brum/Wolves area are more neutral but also very identifiable by the way you pronounce certain vowels hehe
maximin is class
Saint-Maximin is a baller and a half. The skills on that man leave you speechless
Saint - Maximin is our only hope of staying up. What a legend

Cheers for the vlog gaff. Top class baller maximin
Saint maximin is a beast im so confused as to why no big team has went for him yet.
ASM is brilliant. Could possibly be the only reason we stay in the premier league (toon fan obviously). Think he will go on to massive things once he’s more consistent with the end product and has better players around him. He’s hilarious on the socials aswell. Love the channel Ben, you’re a legend! Kept Watford in the game last week and won the battle with Murphy at the end to get the draw.
Can u do a collab with BFordLancer48
Saint Max top baller. Don’t call him Gucci for no reason
ASM is electrifying and has a resemblance of watching Neymar or Ronaldinho. Entertainment at its finest!
Saint maximain is fire💯

Aright Ben did you save a pen in the kop end a few years ago? I hated you that day ! Lol nice insight to the premier league !

Asm is actually one of the best dribblers in the prem he’s a real joy to watch, nearly as good as this channel 🤪
Unreal video Ben, I’ve never seen someone get the ball and dribble more than him ! He’s a baller.
ASM is an absolute baller
Where’s the go pro ?

Hey Bfordlaner48 want to make a collab
What a player. His dribbling is ridiculous and will definitely be their player of the season
Saint Maximin is so unpredictable. He can dribble with both feet at an elite level which makes it hard to defend for the opposition. He’s a world talent. Enjoy watching him when i get the chance 🇫🇷

Saint-Maximin is such an amazing player from dribbling to his skills its amazing.
A-S-M, he’s an legend, the glue to Newcastle…
So is watford a city within a state or what? I know the emirates is in north London and it only makes sense that they train somewhat close to " home " im just completely confused on the geographical layout of england
I'm a Newcastle fan. Saint Maximin is honestly one of my club's only saving graces at the moment, and much of the reason I still watch the games. Newcastle are in serious trouble under Steve Bruce this season.
Saint-Maximin, on the wing, and he got one man down just being him!
Saint-Maximin, totally electric every time he steps on the pitch. A must watch player in the epl for sure!
Sometimes I wonder if saint maximin is better on Fifa or in real life, and I never find out.
ASM easily one of the best players in the league so so efficient honestly unreal
Allan saint maximam is a beast !!!!!

Allan Saint-Maximin is so skilful, I'm always amazed by what he does on the pitch. Every single time he plays, he is electric. We're lucky to have him in the prem. Good video as always!
ASM just dances through players, very fun and exciting to watch
I'd like to see how good he is in a big team
ASM is awesome, as a Monaco fan I wish we had kept him at our club longer, but it is nice to see him be so successful in England and also just being himself. Now all he  needs is a French call up to play with Mbappe, that would be electrifying
Saint max is a pure kings
Watching from Malaysia
Mad lad sainttt
He is all football is about in one man
ASM has an effortless skills set and is simply magical on the ball HWTL !
Is there any chance of getting Maxims shirt before he leaves us in January? 🙏🏻

saint maximin honestly carved up the pitch with his talent 🤩
He's wearing Gucci - So we Gucci - He's got toon army up in a doozy
Good player
Crack
ASM, what a player!
ASM has matured a bit since his first season, and it's pretty scary. I used to see him as an exciting player who wasn't too dangerous ultimately, but he's improved massively, and justifying the hype!
Saint maximan is too good
ASM is silky smooth!
Even though I am a Liverpool fan I love to watch ur vlogs
Saint-maximan is truly underrated, scary to see him on the pitch man
ASM is such a silky dribbler - hes unreal at newcastle
He’s a joke giz shirt
Went to all the Newcastle home games last season. Saint maximin made it worth every penny, such an exciting player to watch the things he does with the ball reminds me of Ronaldinho
Saint Maximan is the best dribbler in the Prem
Every time Allan saint-maximin steps on the pitch, it looks like he’s playing Fifa street. So entertaining!
Saint maximin good
Love asm he's the best player at Newcastle hopefully we don't loose him
ASM top 2 fave players to watch . The best player outside of the top six imo. Baller
Saint maximin down the wing
Cracking player but not as good as our boy Sarrrrrrrrr 👍

Maxim is crazy fast and underrated
Saint maximum would of been great in the euros if he played for a different team
ASM is the best winger outside the top 6
saint maximan is so cool

Ive followed maximin since hes nice days. When he was joking around with balotelli. Hes one of my favourite players. Love your vlogs Ben!
Allan SM reminds me of Fifa Street back in the 2010s
Omg I need that Saint Max shirt 😍 unbelievable footballer
Alan is the goat, too exiting to watch
👍
Great video as always Ben. Saint-Maximin 100% a edge of the seat player, I wouldnt be surprised if hes on the shopping list of some of the top clubs in Europe.
Max is a legend! Love the vlog
Saint is so good I love how he dribbles and is so unpredictable
Great game Ben! had to stay up late to watch it in Australia but definitely worth it.
alllaaan
Saint-Maximin is like you said an absolute baller! He's so magical with the ball at his feet and lightning quick. He's been on my radar for a long time now, I signed him in a fifa career mode back in like fifa 16 doing a Portsmouth rebuild, absolute baller!
ASM is the only reason I would ever watch Newcastle this year probably the best dribbler in the prem the fifa card is crap tho
love  your'e videos and lots of love from iceland
Allan Is a premier league player to look back on and will be a player for the streets to remember
Saint-Max definitely should have got a move away from Newcastle in the summer to a team within the top 5/6 in the prem absoutle baller deserves to be winning trophies
Asm= baller
An ASM shirt would look pretty decent while roaming NCL. Absolute baller
ASM is a beast. So electric on the pitch… resembles  CR7 in a way
Saint maximin is class he has one of the best overall players in the league and he is playing fantastic at the moment he will be something special in the future and he is a center backs nightmare
Allan at maximin is my favourite player rn I support Newcastle btw I’ve even got a st maximin phone case ahah he’s so good
Saint-Maximin, an incredible talent finally getting the recognition he deserves.
Serious player
Honestly would love that asm shirt! He is a fantastic player and i really won't be surprised if he goes to  a bigger club soon. Great vid again mate, keep smashing it
We’ve been so lucky at Newcastle to have exciting French players with flair and swagger! Ginola, Ben Arfa and now ASM! Even when you struggle as a team to have that player who gets you off your seat and excites you makes it all worth it!
Saint- Maximan is a beast. He is going to make EA create 6 ⭐️ skill moves just for him!!!!!
As a Newcastle I love saint maximin he is too good for us howay the lads

It's time to transfer in ASM in fantasy football .
Allan Saint Maximin is a proper 5 star baller!!
Allan st maximan is the best player to watch in the premier  league . Big baller
Allan Saint-Maximin is one of those players nobody hates. Not a player in the premier league in my opinion more entertaining to watch. Every time he touches the ball it looks like magic, almost like watching someone out of FIFA street who made it to the prem.
Allen is just different gravy he’s so good on the ball
Baller 🔥
Alan saint-maximin is a silky baller just like u
Ben I’m a massive Newcastle fan and a massive fan of your channel. Saint maximin is our best player and we would be lost without him

ASM not as good as Ben foster though is he
He’s a beast, very unlucky not to get Newcastle the win👍
Absolute baller he is!   Tell you what… give that shirt to someone else I’ll have a foster one instead! 👌
Big baller ASM
As a newcastle fan saint maximin will always hold a special place in the club, no matter where he moves in the future honestly the memories this guy has brought to me and my family will be unforgettable. i remember me and my dad were watching the fa cup us v oxford and maxy scored a screamer in extra time and we started going crazy and the dog started going crazy it was nuts. Genuinely love that man
Canadian viewer adding to the world wide contingent.

Saint maximin is so good for newcastle they are lucky to have him such a talented player while he was at nice he amazaned me
Saint is a beast. But the blogs are even better keep it up
Love ASM and just hope he stays in the Prem for the rest of his career to keep that top notch football and entertaining play up!
ASM is probably the most entertaining player to watch in the prem at the moment and is gonna get a move to big club next summer surely
Those covid tests look like they're barely even up his nose what's the point
Love your channel! haven't watched for a while, having a little catch up as i play some footy manager

ASM is a baller. Very skilled player and turns a smile on your face. He is just great. Newcastle is having fun with him. Greetz from The Netherlands👌
ASM what a player. Best winger in prem
Asm=🐐
ASM will be up there with the likes of Morten Gamst Pedersen and Hatem Ben Arfa for premier league ballers. In my opinion could play in any side in the top 8
ASM = 🐐
He is such a world class player chance to meet him would be incredible
What a player you are Ben, good luck with the rest of the season. Saint maximan’s fifa card should have 99 dribbling that man cannot be tackled.
Saint-Maximin On the Wing beating 10 men just being hi,
alan saint max, hes pretty cool innit
Allan is a beast, my favourite player outside United 👍
Love your vlogs Ben! Play well weekend

Allan Saint Maximin is one of those players who gets Newcastle fans off their seats. Joins the exclusive club which also comprises of Hatem Ben Arfa and Tino Asprilla. Proper baller, we’ve got to enjoy it while it lasts too because us fans know he’ll be off to a bigger club soon, and rightfully so
Saint ⚽️⚽️⚽️

Saint maximin is the best dribbler itw👊
Saint Maximin is the french Neymar
Saint maximin the goat

ASM What a baller, I’m not a newacastle fan, but he is one of those players you can just sit and watch and admire for hours. His skills on the ball is frecking amazing absolute legend.

ASM is a legend. Absolute baller. Underrated. Been watching him Nice, he just brings joy to the game and my FPL.

Ben Foster: "match attax" Also Ben Foster: shows panini cards 😂 (I collect panini cards)
Saint maximin the streets will never forget him
Saint Maxamin is a goat, speedy and an overall good player. Respect him
Alan saint maxamin is definitely my favourite pl player outside the big 6, he’s a scary opponent to face, teams have to close him down instantly otherwise you get punished   😅 what a guy!
A guy with bags of skill and bags of talent Newcastle will do well to keep Hold of him next season. I can see him competing with a team just outside the top four like a Leicester and pushing them forward. Guys a worry for any team if he gets service and support on his day he can take apart any team.
Saint maximum down the wing
saint maximom is the goat
Saint-maximin is just too quick it’s unfair and his finishing is really nice as well.
Honestly saint maximan is the highlight of newcast
Allan saint maxim = pure pace skill strength agility and balance absolute baller
Allan saint maximan is an absolute beast
Watched ASM at Old Trafford this season and I was impressed, the guy has got some quick fit and sharp. Impressed! 👏
He's the reason I haven't fallen into a deep dark depression after watching the mags.
He's a baller. Magical on the ball. And just really fun to watch beacuse of his flair and skills, and of course the bandana
Ben mate can I have it please I’m a Newcastle fan
Ben I would do anything for that shirt I’m being serious
I liked and subbed and I’m an nufc fan and he’s my favourite
Saint is my favorite player so electric with the ball
can't believe I've just found this channel. it's brilliant
Honestly Fozzy, Saint-Maximin on his day is ridiculous. What a player.  Great upload yet again, I wish you could play on into your 50s just to keep churning out all this quality content.   Also, King Ekong, what a man.   Looking forward to the next video. Keep it up my man.
Best winger in the prem and you got lucky😂 HWTL
saint-maximin one of the most underrated players in the prem hands down
Newcastle fan, he's an absolute baller lucky to keep hold of him. Love the visa mate.

SAINT MAX IS MY FAVOURITE DVER ME PLZZZ WATCHING HIM IS SOMETHING ELSE

Yesss Ramsdale, what a guy!
Why is there no go pro in goal? And Allan is amazing his dribling is the Best
Would love to have that shirt ben. I think saint - maximin is a great player and im glad we kept him quiet.
Great video again
ASM is the goat 700 games played with his first of last year
Ben please
Allan is a baller baller
great vid! allan saint maximin is such a goat for us! would love his shirt ben x
ASM is electric great feet  & what control. Needs to score more. PSG , Man C , Man U. will soon be knocking on his door.
ASM is an absolute baller! Would love that shirt!
Saint-Maximin is the best player at Newcastle, always scoring or assisting. Carries the team like it's nothing! This man is going to be in the France squad by 2022 and has a hell of a future ahead of him.
I’d really love that ASM shirt Ben! I think he’s an absolute baller. Well played against Newcastle, the Watford boys! 👏
SAINT MAXIN IS A STUD IN FIFA AND IN REAL LIFE.
Saint-Maximan is a wonderful player. No more words needed
The guys a joke. Great video #upthehornets
The best man!
So my 10 year old has just watched this with me....and tells me oh dad I didn’t know you watch this channel or knew who ben foster is now you know i want his shirt for Christmas 😆 cheeky little so and so... ill get him a United shirt with you’re name on to teach him a lesson 🤣
St Maximin is a legend ❤️
Wait, Watford and Arsenal training grounds are next to each other?
st maximin absolute treat to watch whenever he plays, the loyalty he's showed to the club is unreal even through these tough times for newcastle
ASM is so skilful and i just love him😍😍😍
Super vid
ASM is insane on the ball
Saint-Maximin is just unfair tbh.
Saint Maximim is without a doubt one of the most dangerous forwards in the Prem! His pace and dribbling is too much to handle and he was great in the Leeds match a couple of weeks ago and came out with an assist in this game.
I would really love this top for my nanna as she is a massive newcastle fan and maximan is her favourite player so I would really love to win this shirts for her.
Saint max is an absolute baller, he’s deserves to be playing for a top 6 team. Like the guy is on different levels

Asm could be my dad
ASM=BALR
Saint maximin 🐐
ASM - has the ball glued to his foot during games and can change the game with a magical moment at any time…
Massive NUFC fan - saw ASM in his first game, pre-season friendly against Saint Etienne. None of us sure watch to expect, but he set St James Park alight. As a Crowd we lost our minds everytime he went near the ball. The guy is a legend, and if he keeps this up, with a new owner at Newcastle soon (hopefully) we will rip the Prem to shreads!
As a Newcastle fan. Watching Allan Saint Maximin is one of the best players I’ve ever had the chance to watch. Seriously gets the fans buzzed. Hoping to win Ben! :)
ASM is such a baller one of my favourite footballers because soooo exciting to watch aslo cracking game from you ben.
allan saint maximan, what a player! always in the fantasy team
Saint Maximin is a goat love to see him at Watford some day 🤣🤣

Saint-Maximin is one of my favourite players in the league, so exciting to watch and skills are on another level, incredible player 🔥
ASM Premier league player of the month in my opinion
Ozan ingilizce öğrenicek misin zahmet olucak ama
ASM a beast
ASM always great to watch even if it's against my team, really entertaining player.
💪💪💪
Most exciting Newcastle player I’ve seen play for us since the Ben Arfa days, big baller and would love that shirt in a frame
Gucci is the goat loves a skill move
Please ask him sign for Liverpool , absolute baller
Allan Saint-Maximin is a magician, most teams want him and will be lying if they say they don’t. I think he will have an amazing career!
ASM is playing really well, loving to see him more involved in creating big chances. Hopefully he keeps it up and help Newcastle this season!
He is so good a dribbler
ASM should be in a big club soon if he gets his consistency and finishing up
Ben how can we join the FPL league?
He is a baller he is like no other he is!
Saint maximim is insane 90 percent of the time the rest hes great

ASM is one of the top ballers in the prem at the moment. Glad Watford could keep him quiet😂
Saint max legend
Saint-Maximin is the best player in Newcastle, so I put him into my fantasy team and he didn’t let me down.
ASM is one of the top ballers in the prem at the moment. Glad Watford could keep him quiet😂
Allan Saint Maximum is Newcastle’s best player by a country mile. Exciting and an absolute joy to watch! As a Newcastle fan I believe he is indispensable to keep us up this year!
ASM is scary!! Respect!!
ASM is one of those exciting players that makes people love football.
ASM>Messi but I am biased ;)
Allan has carried us would be no were without him proud to have him playing for us
Just asking do they tell you what to eat or can u pick out of the stuff on the table
ASM is such a baller
Saint maxi is a baller
He is an absolute Beast!!   Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Allan saint-maximin is a saucy winger with a sprinkle of flare and tons of finishing ability and that’s an understatement
Love ya ben please shirt🤛🏻🧢🤛🏻
Saint maximin should be given 6star skills on fifa
Reminds me of Ben Arfa only with more technical ability, top top player!
Saint-Maximin seems a top lad, love that he does he owns socials and doesn’t hide away and is a class footballer.
Allan Saint-Maximin is in my opinion the best dribbler in the league, watch Newcastle just for him
He is one of the most technically gifted players on the ball right now in the league. He can go right to the top if he keeps improving on his great start to the campaign!
Behind Joel matip, ASM is best dribbler in the league
Saint-Maximin has the potential to go to the very top!
ASM is such a baller. Please I would love his top
Watching from 🇦🇺 your a legend mate
ASM is an absolute baller, definitely one of my favorite players to watch.
Big baller
Solid player good skills
Gonna be honest I think he is the funniest bloke on twitter 🤣 😂 😆
Me
saint maximin absolute baller would love the shirt love the content UP THE BOYS!!!!!!!
ASM is a joke
Great video! And he is class player!
ASM is that player that you know you can watch and he will be an absolute joke on the ball, glides past defenders like they don't even exist. If he could have someone like Sanchos end product with his finish or passing. He'd probably be one of the best RW in the league. But overall he's so entertaining to watch, what a purchase by Newcastle
GL against Leeds they will win 😂
Asm is just different man
Saint maximan is incredible. His ability should be utilised off the bench for Liverpool, add attacking depth and allow for a spark ⚡️
asm just too for us🤷🏻‍♂️
Just started watching this channel and I wish I started a long time ago! I’m liking Ben’s energy. He’s always full of positivity and enthusiasm. You can tell that he appreciates and doesn’t take for granted the position that he’s in, something many of us would dream of and it’s good to see and quite motivating 👏🏻
Allan saint maximin is rapid, silky smooth skills and an absolute baller
Bet ur looking forward to Man Utd old Trafford video to see ronaldo
ASM what a baller !
Liked ✅ Subscribed ✅ Im a Newcastle fan and I love Saint Maximim, he carries our whole team. Can't wait to see you up at St James Park in the reverse fixture Ben! ✅
💯
ASM would be talked about so much more if he was at a top 6 side
Saint max is the goat. Love watching him as a Newcastle fan brings joy to the club. Unreal
Saint-Maximim is nasty!
Allan saint-maximan: My absolute goat, would love his match worn shirt, big ups cycling gk for making these vlogs.
ASM just an absolute baller ain’t he? Captain in my ultimate team, no cap
SAINT-MAXIMIN is a baller!
Saint Maximin is such a good skillful player which loves going on 1 on 1 And wins them most of the time
Most broken card in fifa
lordo maximin
Maxi gives us hope, what a baller
ASM is nuts, gives me Robinho type of vibes
ALAN SAINT MAX, THAT LAD WITH THE HEADBAND, HE IS DIFFERENT GRAVY 😍 Love you Ben x
Saint-maximi is turning into a top player! Someone to keep an eye on👀
Luv how every time you show us the inside of the football world
ASM!! <3  It’s also amazing to see what occurs behind the scenes other than just the match it’s self!!
Allan is one those streets won't forget kinda silky ballers
ASM brilliant on the pitch and hilarious off it, his Twitter is gold!! Middlesbrough fan but he makes watching Newcastle bare-able😂👏🏻
Given the fantasy team I'm sure you'd ask for Fernandes to take a peno against you so Ronaldo wont go -2 points.
Newcastle are knackered when ASM leaves, unreal player
ASM is probably the best 1v1 dribbler, he has zero fear
Saint-Maximin is arguably the most underrated player in the prem, the lads a baller and is carrying Newcastle on his back My number 10
he is a beast can get even better
🔥🔥🔥scary baller
I love maximin he’s my favourite player. I went to the game from Newcastle and if josh kings goal got allowed I would’ve won £200 and if we won I would’ve got £100. So wasn’t a great day but I hope getting the GOAT’s shirt would make it better
Maxi is the biggest baller we've had at the club since Ben Arfa, more consistent than him too. Cracking match... Viva la toon!
He's class, plays brilliantly 🙏
Saint-Maximin is crazy
Saint is amazing and being a Newcastle fan it’s unreal to find a quality player like him
Asm is a very good dribbler
Saint-Maximin will break into the French squad and a top 6 club soon, baller!
Saint-Maximin is a magician with the ball at his feet!
Asm is unbelievable Liverpool should buy
ASM - Most under rated player in the prem , Great vid as always Ben
asm is a modern day ronaldinho , baller
Outrageously good on the ball young Saint Max
He's just the definition of Gucci isn't he
Shame there isn't any gopro in the goal anymore. Suppose it's smt to do with Prem rights.

ASM is one of the best Newcastle players ever and will become on of the best in the world at some point of his life he is just such a lethal player and is so accurate and powerfull and he is never afraid of a challenge. ASM is amazing and the only goalie that can stop him is Ben ◼️◻️♥️
Saint-Maximin is a ballerrrrrr😤
Different gravy that man
Saint-Maximin is a living god
Allan Saint-Maximin is genuinely my favourite player of all time and I don’t even support Newcastle. Having his shirt would be a dream🙌🙌
ASM, what a baller his playstyle is incredible with better players around him he would be noticed more than he is, he could be a star
ASM is such a baller and no offence to Newcastle but he deserves to be at a top 4 team
What a player.
You have fans from Egypt too 🇪🇬 TheCyclingGK goes WORLDWIDE !! 🌎❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Mans a baller! As a toon fan he's a huge reason to keep watching and is the second coming of Ben Arfa. Great vid as always.
Allan is a Showstopper

ASM is just a sick baller
Another great video . It always cheer me up when I need it . 👍
His one of the best in the wing
Saint-Maxime is a realy good and pacy footballer
Allan Saint-Maximin could dribble past you in a phone box. He's that good.
I love how fearless Saint Maximin is
St max to good for Newcastle too top player
Anyone else checking the Watford score every weekend after watching these 😂
I think Saint-Maximin is so underrated 🤔
🇫🇷🪄
Hes so good. Great pace Great dribling Great shooting 🇸🇰🇸🇰🇸🇰 greetings from Slovakia
ASM has 5 star skills ⭐️
He is the best down the wing
as for me, asm is a trendsetter regarding his gucci headband style and i can say that he's absolute baller, always my fav player for fifa, my endgame lw and with he's capability, i am sure that one day he will lift up newcastle or maybe next big things with other club x

Gucci
Saint Maximin is such a underated player imo. He is sick on FIFA too actually.. Would just wish he would switch to a good london club I know. Im sure he will be enyoing the bubbels
I bet you already gave away the ASM shirt but it would mean the world to me if I got it
ASM is world class footballer if he gets transfer to a team with a higher level football he will become unstoppable because he is levels above the current Newcastle team and that’s from a Newcastle supporter!
St.Maximin is amazing, genuinely believe he has the potential to be world class. Best 1v1 dribbler in the premier league and is up there in the world aswell.  Don’t wash the shirts next time though 😳😏
Allan and the Pie have one thing in common, they get the crowds in!
Lifelong Newcastle fan and I don't think we've seen someone win the fans over as much as ASM has since the Shearer days, he genuinely seems to love it up there, just pray we can get a takeover and make this club the sort of club that can keep hold of him 😭
Yoyo
Saint maximin on de wing n he got 3 man down just bein him
Allan absolute Baller 👌
ASM is simply the most exciting player we have had for as long as I can remember. Electric Baller!   You had a good game too 👍

Why aren't you allowed the gopro in goal
ASM at dribling and skilling i would say he is up there with neymar
Saint maximin deserves a big club move he’s an elegant footballer
ASM just adores football! You can tell that he's got a real passion to impress and do his absolute best!   He's quick, Great dribbler and full of skills.   Not long before he gets a chance at a world class team.
i’m a newcastle fan and asm is by far my favourite player at the club, deserves so much better
What a baller the guy is so underrated defo should be playing champions league but then a again a club as big as Newcastle should be too, cheers for the vid Ben as always you legend 💪

Cycling GK…. CYCLING. Come on Fozzy, get on the pedals!!
One of the world's best on the ball Saint-Max. Shame he is playing in such a defensive minded team led by Stev Bruce

Unreal player ASM, just needs that extra end product to become one of the best in the league
Saint maximum has got skills to pay the bills 💵 I want his SHIRT
best thing about ASM is how down to earth he is like you, his twitter is gold
If ASM was a baby he’d need a bib a mile long with the amount of dribbling he does, love the Vlogs Ben! 👍🏻
As a Newcastle fan he’s the best we’ve had for a very very long time! Probably too good for us at the moment but I love his fan interaction and banter on Twitter, especially with the Sunderland fans 😬 what a man and what a baller!
ASM will end up at one of the big 6 for sure
Saint-Maximin The baller with the dancing feet. Good forward runs always.
Saint-Maximim is the most underrated player in the prem imo. He’s also just pure excitement to watch
ASM is a baller he is criminaly underated and imo is top 5 wingers itl!

ASM is one of the best entertainers in the league, always very fun to watch

ASM is quality. Fantastic player and really loves the club and the fans, which makes him so much more likeable. Takes the time to talk to fans and joke with them on Twitter, and winds up mackems on the regular. Will be gutted when he leaves 😅⚫️⚪️

Saint-maximan is just comically good when it comes to his playstlye, Baller.

Allan Saint-maximin is just exceptional at body faints and uses his acceleration perfectly. There's been a missing person report on him but some say he might still be in your back pocket Ben.
ASM great player, the flair and technique he got is really exceptional. Just hope he stays fit to enjoy his game more.
Saint- Maximin isas sharp as catana, but what i like about him the most is he fact that his playstyle is so interresting, that everyone wants to see him everytime he has the ball

Saint Maximum is top 10 players in the league
Saint maximan summed up for me by a newcastle fan of 50 years on a weekly zoom call in Covid we had   Last year stating the best Alan to have played  for newcastle  … when we suggested Shearer  may have had a shout, he said Aye , my son thinks I’m a fool but he does things with a ball I haven’t seen since Beardsley .

I will say you could have done better on that save. However, you are 4 points above the drop, which is good considering your table position.
Am in Nigeria I love for channel u need to be given YouTuber of the year
Everyone loves big Baz!
Saint-Maximin is so good on the ball. He can dribble forward so quickly and effectively. Legend 🙌🏽 love the vids
Amazing vid 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Allan goated
The guy is an absolute speed demon
Baller!
Saint-Maximin brilliant player
ASM is Newcastles Lord and saviour
ASM is a baller as everyone knows but why he's loved even more I think is because he doesnt hide his personality, his social media is full of jokes and banter no matter how he plays. Just seems like a top guy.
Wow
The moment I see ASM and Ben Foster I clicked into this video. P.S. I am a big fan of Newcastle United
Allan is the best dribbler in the league by a mile, great player
Allan saint maximin is a absolute baller dribbles past defenders and score absolute bangers
Absolute problem for premier league defenders
Saint maximin is a baller
ASM Good on the ball works hard off the ball and he is an absolute ball
Allan Saint Maximin epitomises everything our club stands for, both on and off the pitch and we've been absolutely blessed to see him in a Toon shirt! I'm glad he's finally getting the recognition he deserves!
Can I get the shirt? Maximum is a balllerrrr
As a Newcastle fan, ASM is the shining light in a very bleak team and club at the moment. Absolute baller and his off the field confidence on social media wins us all over
Please no one comment I have been watching Saint-Maximin since his Saint Etienne days I'd love to win his kit
Saint Maximin is so unpredictable and is so fast with he’s feet he’d be a pain to play against
Allan is a baller. Simple as THAT.

King ASM
10* skiller, now please give me his shirt 🔥🔥
THIS DUDE'S A LEGEND I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CONTENT HE CREATES WHILE BEING A PL GK
As a Newcastle fan, ASM seriously makes us a million times better to watch, absolute baller and funny lad too. You did well to prevent him from scoring after that dodgy backpass.
ASM is a silk machine
Allan Saint-Maximin is an absolute baller, very tricky winger and skillful winger who’s perfectly capable of tearing defences apart
First time tuning into the vlog and really enjoyed it notifications set, looking forward to the next piece of content. I’m a life long Newcastle fan so winning my favourite players match worn shirt would be unbelievable. Supporting Newcastle is very painful as I’m sure you’re aware however ASM gives us Geordies a sense of hope and anticipation cuz at any moment this boy can produce magic. Absolutely love him. Just hope he stays and we can get investment and build the team around him the man is a star.
Saint maximim honestly the goat
Loved the video
Took a bit of time for this. If you see this wouldn't mind the jersey. Allan Saint-Maximin is a rare breed of footballer that comes around only so often for Newcastle United fans. Very much a player in the Hatem Ben Arfa or Tino Asprilla mould, he is a diamond in the rough at Newcastle. He is gifted with the ability to create something out of nothing, with dazzling footwork and blistering pace which terrifies defences. It is no wonder Burnley fouled him so many times, most notably with Phil Bardsley, who was lucky to escape a booking. Bruce has deemed him a ‘marked man’, which will certainly be the case this year if he continues to contribute going forward.
Allan Saint Maximin is one of the most underrated forwards in the prem, on his day unplayable
A joy to watch almost as good as sarr 👍🏼
Saint maximin is a baller really entertaining to watch reminds me of ben arfa
ASM is basically playing on fifa street. Serious baller 👌

Allan Saint-Maximin is arguably one of the most underrated players in the prem, so silky and practically glued the ball to his feet
Maximin is an absolute rocket, could be the Flash if he wasn't playing footy.
Saint max might be top 3 best dribblers in the league
ASM is one of the most exciting players in the league to watch, underrated because of his injuries, hope he stays fit this season
Huge Toon fan, he’s our clubs saviour, would love the shirt
You are a bloody legend super benny foster 🔥
Asm best winger out of the top 6

ASM is one of those players who is a symbol of how exciting the sport is, any football fan can be in awe of the way he plays because of how enjoyable it is to watch him.

Saint Maximin is basicly Neymar in a better league🚴⚽️                                  👋🏻
Max is a mad lad
Why did I just find this channel #crying..... Epic and entertaining vids Ben. You got a new subscriber and liker. Maximin is just simply a terrific forward playing, chance creating, goal shark of a baller.. #Underrated
Class video Ben, hope I win that shirt😍💕😱
Saint Maximin is an absolute baller. No defender coping with him over 5 yards. Sharp as anyone and he’s got the flair to top it off🔥
Years and years of following Newcastle at the min maxi is our only hope sadly you had a blinder against us Ben some class saves kept your lads in it well played!
Massive NUFC fan, Maxi is the most exciting player I’m seen for a long time at my club, legend
Ozzziiiiii💛💙💛💙
ASM is a beast, superstar and a jersey I’d love for my own collection
Saint maximin, absolut baller, love his skills
allan saint maximin is a baller and I have watched all his games and should be at a much higher club than Newcastle bc he is absolute quality
ASM reminds me a bit of JJ okocha, I really enjoy watching him and his precise dribbling and skills are unbelievable.
One of the most entertaining players in the prem - a inspiration to most young players like me.
The player you pay to watch
To doubt Saint maximin would be a sin, he puts defenders in the bin and unlike Mane he has a decent trim...
maxi is such a baller, so smooth on the ball and the best player NUFC have had in many of years, we are blessed to have him!
ASM Is a Baller - That's the comment.
Maximin is class Newcastle would be lucky to keep him for much longer

ASM: what a man. not sure what's better - his trim or skill moves
Just brought in ASM for my fantasy Because I thought you would be nice and let him score a few goals but turns out you’re too good :0
ASM is brilliant , his use of skillmoves make him so fun to watch and he got a banger of a song, too.
ASM is an absolute ridiculous baller. When he’s done up north and fancies coming to the south east us at West Ham would welcome him with open arms
Beautiful man
ASM is ridiculous !! what a baller
As A Newcastle fan, st max is the most exciting player in the league, hands down. Gives us Newcastle fans A slight glimmer of hope that we all need. Shame we went be able to hold onto him for long
Asm you in the headband, you’re different gravy. What an entertaining player rare to see players like this in today’s game
I think that ASM can easily start at every premier league team. He has everything required to be a star player 🤙🏾
AMS - JOKER
You don't see many like ASM anymore, especially in the prem. Refreshing to see
ASM is a proper baller
asm what a baller
ASM will be playing champions league football in the coming seasons, tooo much energy 👍🏼
Saint-Maximin is an absolute unit. The guy is practically dancing when he pulls off the skills on the pitch.

ASM the most entertaining player in the league
ASM IS A BEAST
Saint Maximin is like sonic
Saint maximin on the wing
Saint-Maximin is an absoulte baller! He is my go to in fantasy football and have a guaranteed spot my Fifa squad! Pace, skill and flair. What more can you ask about a football player?
I just bought Allan Saint-Maximin for my FIFA career mode with Brentford. He's FAST.
Fancy international shipping?
ASM = GOAT. Will leave us very soon….😫😫
As a newcastle fan I adore ASM . He is the playmaker of the team . The things he can do with the ball at his feet are just unbelieveable
Unreal vlogs amazing bloke
Saint Max and Adama traore are my favourite players in prem outside TOP6 clubs.
Saint-Maximin is the best player to watch in the Prem, no doubts, absolute bad man. Smashes it in fantasy footy too. Another class vlog, thanks.
Saint Max is an absolute baller. Maybe you need him in your Fantasy team Fozzie x
ASM will win pfa player of the year next season
Let's be honest ASM will be at a bigger prem club in a year or 2.

Love maxi! Been what we’ve needed at newcastle for so long! Would love that shirt!
Saint Maximan is honestly one of the best players too watch with the ball
Pure class
Players like Saint-Maximin don't come around often in the Premier League.  A player of flair, silky footwork and pure entertainment on the wing.  Reminds me of when we had Ben Arfa, Robinho, a young Cristiano Ronaldo, Jay-Jay Okocha etc.  He brings back the "Joga Bonito" vibes.   Ps. Big up Ben, been a fan ever since that class performance in the 2009 Carling Cup Final against my beloved Spurs.
ASM one of the best skillers in the world rn
Love this Channel the king Ben Foster. Would love that Saint-Maximin jersey !!!!
Maxi is just different gravy the way he moves with the ball is just unbelievable
Allan saint maximum is our goat ⚫️⚪️
Saint Maxmin was a quality pick up on older fifas from St.Etienne and has only proven how good he is since going to newcastle
ASM is Henry's Hero
Why would you wash the shirt 😔
Just a New subscriber Ben ,  I am a GLASGOW CELTIC SUPPORTER but I just love football,  also I think you are not a bad KEEPER,  I honestly think WATFORD could get a EUROPEAN place this YEAR,  SAINT-MAXIMIN is probably one off the reasons NEWCASTLE will stay in the premiership this year & I think NEWCASTLE will struggle to keep him at the club as one off the big ENGLISH team should & will come in for him ..  anyway BEN good luck for the season mate 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
ASM is a different human being, love from Sweden🇸🇪
ASM - pace, power, skill, accuracy - would love him at Liverpool to compete with Mane, our left side would be unbeatable
The streets won’t forget ASM
Asm is a baller 🔥
Allan saint Maximan qaulity player wish we had him at Leeds! Which leads me on to the next point, good luck for rest of the season apart from on Saturday when we play you, we need the win, hopefully you have a sick game but we just nick a win last minute.

Saint maximain is an absolute goat his moves and speed are absolutely electric ⚡️ and completely carries Newcastle and he has to be up there with the best premier league players. Amazing performance from both sides in the match was a thrill to watch.
*pretends to act shocked* another absolute belter benny.  Saint maximin is everything you want a footballer to be, loves playing the game, silky on the ball and is interactive with the fans, doesn’t get much better than that
saint max = ⚡️💨🐐
Great blog again pal and Saint maximan would get a lot more recognition at a bigger club no disrespect to Newcastle but if he was at a top 6 club the world would be all over the guy but because he’s at Newcastle people don’t give him the respect he deserves. Keep up the work with the channel and take care 👊
St Maximin is untouchable! He is god !
I am watching from South Africa
ASM 🙏🙏🙏
You can’t have the camera behind goal? :( and highlights throughout the game? If not it’s all good ❤️
ASM is a stunning player. So much flair and always puts the defenders in a tough position.
From my experience as a goalkeep, St Max sounds like a nightmare to play, hes left, right, full of energy, never gives up!
Allan Saint Maximin is magic skill and pace he is just wonderfull as a newcastle fan myself it is great to have him at the club
ASM SHIRTS PLEASE
ASM is such a baller and deserves a better club, on his day he is one of the best wingers in the pl and he also is a player who everyone likes to watch. Also every defenders hates to play against him
As a Newcastle fan, ASM is the most entertaining player I’ve watched at St James’ for years; no one gets you off your seat like him, like Hatem Ben Arfa with a bit more style and finesse. Great video again Ben mate, still so refreshing over a year on seeing a matchday from a footballer’s perspective⚽️
ASM stands for A sharp man!!!!!
ASM is a certified baller!

Love the videos Ben!
Absolute Baller 💯💯
allen is an absolute baller!
Staying up all night as an Australian worth it when you get to watch ASM play

UP THE CYCLING GK!  Been in the fantasy since day one double figures next week pls
I’m a Newcastle fan, he is phenomenal. He needs to add more goals and he could be world class. Having his shirt would be awesome. Thanks Ben!
Ah man! That shirt is a banger! He's going to a top 4 side if he continues with his current form. I hope he stays injury free. 🤞 Great vids 👍
Saint maximin on the wing Mate too good on the wing
ASM is dazzling
Its a huge suprise that with such huge amounts of money spent in last tranfer window, AST did not get a move to a bigger club...But future is undoubtedly bright for him if he continues to put in that workrate without any time lost in major injury... Would like him to be at Arsenal...Could actually be a proper Alexis Sanchez replacement for me
ASM scintillating player to watch, lightning quick left and right.
These are great videos and he is a great player
allen is a mad dawg
St max is insane… he’s done so much for that Newcastle side
ASM is the top gucci man! Love the vlogs this season Ben! Much love from USA
ASM is a big baller, would be sick to have his jersey
ASM is good
Alan Saint Maximin is quickly becoming one of my favorite players. Been a beast on fantasy as well!
Gucci
come on the boys!
Love the content, absolute legend
Saint-Maximin second favorite player behind Lewandowski.
ASM is such a baller. If I won that kit I’d be wearing it every day.
Allan Saint-Maximin what a player, great feet, going to end up going to one of the big clubs and doing well.
absolutely electric, and a complete baller!!
Saint maximal will play for a top 4 club very soon
Ngl I want that shirt badly, not even gonna try bullshit my way to it
Saint-Maximin is just a pure BALLER simple as that nothing more needs to be said.
ASM is stupid. Stupidly ridiculous!!! The man is going to go places for sure!!!
Allan is probably the smoothest baller I’ve seen in my short time as a Toon fan. Love the content, would love the shirt mate. Big ups
Allan Saint-Maximin is honestly an absolute weapon. What a guy.
Saint maximin the king on the wing
Why do you get a nice and gentle covid test while I get nose fucked with a nose swab?
Saint-maximin reminds me of hazard at Chelsea but with a couple added step overs 🤣No matter where he picks the ball up he creates space for himself, creates space for his team mate by dragging in 2 defenders, looks for an intricate 1-2, or effortlessly glides through 3 players. I love how his play style is so reactionary, also dribbling at full pace waiting for defenders to dive in.
That was a wild game! Glad you played well had a few decent saves managed the game well tho! Saint-Maximin was on one too was dangerous the whole game
saint maximin is an absolute underrated baller
Saint maxi = Goat. Nothing less
allan is the best but the cycling gk is legendary
Silky smooth
Would really appreciate the maxi shirt, Bobby dazzler of a player
ASM will end up being a big time player I can feel it
Saint-Maximin is a terror  to the league
Massive Newcastle and Saint Max fan from Australia, it makes it way easier getting up at 3am knowing that he can play the absolute baller.
My brother love ASM so much and even learn French, hope one day can meet him. 10 of October is his birthday, really appreciate to have it for him. He is a very talented player and we believe he can lead Newcastle further.
Saint maximin was mad on Saturday, his control is something else
Wouldn't believe Ben's a prem goalie
I want it to give to my small brother
Another great video
Ozan Tufan🇹🇷🟡🔵
pure beast, pace king not much more to say
Saint Maximim is no doubt an absolute baller but he’s no match for our goat THE CYCLING GK. Class stuff as always mate.
Alan is wild! Never know where he's going to go, must be a pain for you to play against! Love the vlog as always mate!
Hello i am from indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩
ASM is amazing, great baller and has the pace to beat every opponent.
ASM is a worry for you ben
hey ben, how are ya doing? from aus
ASM is a baller for Newcastle. Massive prem supporter from Australia. Would love this jersey.

Allan should be playing in a better club!!!
Saint max in one word: baller
ASM is a joy to watch, love the videos.
ASM is honestly Newcastle’s rock and always shows up no matter what
ASM is an absolute baller
I think you’re going to be the number one football channel in the next couple of months. You’re absolutely amazing. Keep it up Ben! PS I think saint maximin is the most underrated player and I hope he gets called up to the French national team.
Saint maximin is an absolute baller, always a joy to watch and he reminds me of Ben arfa in his Newcastle days.       Side note. You should pin the comment that wins so people know u do actually give away the shirts.
Honestly he's such a player that Saint max is and Ben Foster ofcourse
ASM - a beast
These videos are literally my favorite downtime!!!
ASM brings the team energy and confidence which without, would surely mean our relegation!
Hes the best ballet baller in the prem
ASM is a freak of nature he is so class and joyful to watch and good to play with in fifa
He is very good but new castle
ASM is easily the most entertaining player outside top 6, top top player
As eddie hearn would say '' MY DARLING, YOU WITH THE HEADBAND , YOU ARE DIFFERENT GRAVY''
Saint-Maximin is a beast, he and Adam Traore are the only two guys in the league that I feel can legitimately burn past defenders in an instant they make everyone else look like they are walking
ASM is a baller, love to win the jersey!
baller.
ASM is one of the best players outside the top six... My head tells me a big move awaits him but then again I'd love to see him as the focal point of a team that the Saudi consortium takes over. Would be a fun watch
His hairband says it all. Love the guy.
Saint-Maximin is an absolute freight train, the guy runs after defenders with no fear and can get a shot off from any angle inside the box.
Absolute Jaffa
ASM is a ballerrrr
ASM is a menace in real life and in fifa mate. His skills are out of this world. Great to see the PL videos Ben!!!
baller
Saint maximin, an absolute baller that man and really makes football a joy to watch every time he steps on the pitch.
Absolute baller he is
Allan is a baller
ASM absolute baller, win or lose he's just so exciting to watch. Oozes of class and elegance
Manes replacement @ liverpool…calling it now
Saint maxim just has the sauce
Allan saint maximin on the wing
I’ll be honest St Max is an absolute legend.
Saint maximin and Almiron are absolute ballers
Saint-maximin is such a happy lad
Saint Maximin is a freak of nature ⭐️
Love you lad
ASM is an absolute baller. Can see he loves the club aswell which makes him even more enjoyable to watch🔥
Satin-Maximan is an insane dribbler man. Absolute baller!
He is a baller such a good dribbler
Saint Maximim is my religion, dudes my best player in Fifa 22 already. Love him to pieces proper tekkers
nufc fan  love asm :)
I want allan SM to come play for arsenal he'd do such a good job and would add great depth to our wingers. Also defo is the best player at newcastle by miles and is one of my fav players to watch in the prem
ASM skills are another level. Seems like he's just out playing with mates lol
ASM is a baller 💫
Saint-Maximin On the wing And he got two men down just being him He wearin' Gucci So we Gucci He got Toon army all drinkin' D'ussé
Fast
ASM - what a beast of a player! Can see him leaving Newcastle next year!   btw Love you're channel even thougfh I'm a Leeds fan, get some good footage when you come to Leeds if you don't mind  All the best!
ASM what a baller 👏
So glad the premier league is back even happier I get to see Asm, play what a talent even more so a top entertainer pure class a diamond is that lad
Saint-Maximin is the only man giving me hope for Newcastle, would love his shirt more than anything 😍🤯
He’s class. Probably deserves his PSG move in the next year!
Anyone got mad anxiety of that Laptop falling off the balcony?
as a newcastle fan i get the pleasure of watching him week in week out but it’s not just what he does on the pitch, it’s off as well. he’s constantly interacting with fans and showing support to the community with foundations etc. he’s a top player and person and we’re so lucky to have him
Pls would love a Saint Maximin shirt ❤️
Newcastle are my childhood club and he is my hero at the minute
Love watching the vids
ASM is a don.. huge player for Newcastle. There’s not a team in the prem he wouldn’t improve. Big up Foz great content
ASM always looks so uncomfortable on the ball but is immense with it at the same time. I think the same about Suarez but obviously they’re different players. ASM deserves a bigger move or a manager that’s more expansive going forward. Great player as raw as they come 🔥
I would love the Saint Maximin shirt because he is amazing player and I always look forward to seeing him on the pitch but not against us 🤣. What a player
I think it's a joke how good Saint-Maximin is and, with no disrespect to Newcastle, I have no clue how he's not been snatched up by one of the bigger teams the lads an absolute baller. I'm not too sure on the parameters but think I heard a stat that Newcastle had won something like 12% of home matches without him and 40% with him which is just outrageous.
thanks for the positive vibe,really made my day.bte ASM is the ferrari in premier league
Saint-Maximin the baller
Allan saint maximan what baller
Allan Saint Maximan is honestly a baller with great banter
Im from Brazil send some love to João for us 💚💛💙

Saint maximum is all we have. As a newcastle supporter I love him so much. He’s amazing. I would do anything for that shirt. He is everything to me
Being a newcastle fan, asm is the biggest baller in the prem imo
Class vid as always mate, Newcastle fan here, what a game, would of loved the win,  you didn’t do us any favours!! Class to see rob elliot- amazing servant to the club, love to see a top bloke doing well! Saint Maximin is my favourite player with Paul Dummett- that shirt would be incredible- good luck to everyone!!
ASM brings so much excitement and character to the newcastle attack i just love watching him when he’s got the ball
Mr foster that Allan saint-maximin would do me a world of good. I have been a Newcastle support since I was a 3 year old and he is my favourite player. Big ups to you today you had an amazing game. 🤍🖤🐝
Saint maximan is an absolute baller 🤩 joke of a player

Absolute baller, Leeds fan and rips us to shreds every time
Baller.
I got 37 points on fpl 😭
tbf I’m not aure you kept Saint Maximin quiet, as much as his team mates did 😂 made 3 golden chances that you saved.
ASM is great. Skillful and fast. Tbh I can see him moving so a primarily counter-attacking team like Leicester in a few years time
saint maximan is i think awsome and at only being 24 I think he will be amazing in the near future
Saint-maximin is one of them absolute ballers that football fans will look back on in 5/10 years and be like ‘the streets will never forget’ like Taraabt or Ben Arfa
Saint-Max is the goat, better than Alan Shearer
Jeeze well saint maximin an absolute baller from what I can tell from over here in straya. BUT he does not compare to the BEN FOSTER himself. As a keeper you got to be one of my favourites, what a guy.

ASM is one of the most underrated ballers in the prem hands down!
Saint-Maximin is a really entertaining player to watch, is the type of player you absolute love to see in the premier league (Fast and good skills). So much fun when it’s time to see Newcastle play

ASM is the best dribbler in the premier league! Love him
Top content mate, saint maximain is one of the most under rated players in the league, proper box of tricks. Him and Almiron bossing it for the toon!
Saints a baller. Luckily no goal that game tho
ASM is a baller!
He’s the definition of “joga bonito”
ASM is a monster! Would love to have him at Liverpool, although with him and Salah in the team I don’t think anyone else would get a touch of the ball lol
ASM, Easily the best dribbler in the prem, couldn't  get the ball off him in a phone box
Have I missed something, why’s there no GoPro in the goal anymore?
ASM: not going to be at NUFC next season.

Massive Newcastle fan and I've been looking out for this vlog when the fixtures came out in the summer! ASM is a joke, if he has a year fit I think he will explode onto the PL scene - can't believe we didn't get 3 points on the weekend though ;)

👍👍👍
Saint maximan will win the ballon dor
Love how Ben foster shows all the love for all the back room staff, proper down to earth geezer, love it 👍🏻
West Ham fan here but ASM is frightening - one of the most threatening attackers in the league!
Allan Saint-Maximin carrying us this season will probably be reason we stay up
Hi Ben. I’m the biggest Newcastle fan and of course Allan is my favorite!   So.. I’m having a baby boy in about 4 months time..I could persuade the mrs to make his middle name Ben? As a little thank you :) let me know.   Great content

Allan Saint-Maximin is pure class, unpopular opinion: he deserves a call up for France
Saint max is legit one of the most underrated ballers in the prem the guy is a joke
Hi Ben would love the shirt gor my mate he's a massive newcastle fan and loves asm would mean so much to him
ASM on the wing :)
Allan Saint-Maximin is a baller, keeps this Newcastle team on their feet and to perform in it like he does and get the stats he does is incredible it scares me what he would be like under a Liverpool Chelsea and city side wih the level of quality behind him and the servive he would be getting. Outstanding player and easily the best player to watch in the prem rn, always gets me out of my seat everytime i watch him.
Asm baller
Saint maximin is actually mental saving us a lot
ASM is the most skilful player in the league. Absolute baller
Is he not allowed put the Go pro in the goal anymore?
Saint maximan, the french messi
Saint Maximin is one of the most promising and prolific wingers of Premier League, I believe he has more to give the upcoming years
Nice’s Very Own Allan St-Max! 💯💯
St Max is a baaaaaller
Allan saint maximum = decent
ASM aka Maxi is a class. He comes across as if he's a fan doing what every fan would love to do and play football. He does it with a cheeky smile on his face.
Saint-Maximin On the wing And he got one man down just being him He wearin' Gucci So we Gucci He got Toon army all drinkin' D'ussé
ASM is a player that would get into any team in the world. Purely unique skill set and top lad as well!

Saint-Maximin is actually a baller, everyone says he needs to move to a top 6 club but if Newcastle could get a few players to compliment him they could do bits.

ASM is the future of Newcastle. Without him they’ll lose soul
Asm is a great player , ive followed him since he was playing in france. I think he is one of the best skillers in the prem and the good thing is that he is still young.

Saint maximan is pretty decent tbf
He saves the toon he’s my hope
Saint-Max absolutely rapid would beat any defender in the league in a one on one
ASM to Twitter is what Fozzy is to YouTube, absolute gold. Safe to say he’s as loved off the pitch as he is on, doing his bit for Newcastle Food Bank etc. Fair play to the lad, top drawer.

🐐🐐
Love the fact you say hello to everyone and the poor girl behind the food at dinner looked half scared when you said hello with a go pro pointing at her lol. What a fricking legend
Imagine Sarr and Allan Saint-Maximin in the same team. It would be ridiculous.
ASM one of my fav players, he’s an absolute joke, turns defenders inside out every week, only player in the league who could pull of a Gucci head band, great to watch every week plus he’s an absolute joker on Twitter has me in stitches
I would love that Saint-Maximin shirt. He is by far my favourite player. I don’t want to think where my club Newcastle would be without him! Loved the video!
ASM the French 🐐
Proper baller is saint-maximin, one of the best at dribbling in England wouldn’t be half bad to have his shirt

Newcastle fan here, Love your content go me into cycling too! Proper legend Ben. Would love the shirt, Maxi is the only thing keeping us Newcastle fans going! Cheers pal
A great player and so dangerous near the box
What a baller maxi is! His technical ability on the ball is second to none and with that turn of pace is frighting not only that hes still under the age of 15 and getting better! Potential is endless. Plus, as a NUFC Fan, what a guy he is with the fans and on social media.  Shame PL don’t let you do the game footage but love this. As a former GK myself, it’s an experience back there infront of fans that people just don’t get so loved these vlogs
Uppa Saint Maxy 🤞
saint maximan the gucci man is a baller
Saint-Max is an absolute god
OMGGGG THE BEST GIVEAWAY YET , Allan St Maximin is the silkiest baller of silkiest ballers , the mans has tekkers for days , please Ben lad help a toon fan out 🙏😂 UP THE WATFORD THO💪😂

Amazing video mate
Maximin is a BALLER. WHAT A LEGAND
Top video, love the fact you collect match attax. When it’s the return fixture I think Ben should arrange a race between ASM and Sarr, that would be epic, my money is on Sarr 🐝 though ASM is lightning quick, I was bricking it watching the game but will take the point 😁 come on you hornets 🐝
I started watching the cycling gk today and the guy just is so amazing.
A french magician!!
Saint-Maximin is such a baller. Genuinely don't know where Newcastle would be without him. Hope you managed to swap a Gucci headband for that shirt 👌
I've liked and subed I'm a massive fan of you I would love that shirt
Another fantastic vlog Ben ☺️ Love watching all your vlogs. Always look forward to the next upload 😁
World class he is 🔥🔥🔥
Allan is a freaking legend
ASM back going to be sore from carrying Newcastle all season, class video mate
Still loving the videos Ben! Played very well against Newcastle with a few top saves. Good to see you back playing and fingers crossed for the shirt! All the best 👊🏼
Would love ASM at Liverpool exiting player to watch
I honestly adore maxi ! As a 14 year old Newcastle he’s my favourite player man.  Keep it up Ben hopefully I win. All love 👍🏽
ASM is the man, you know it Ben! Would love that shirt!
ASM is going to be a top 20 in the future
Not sure which one I prefer ASM at Nicce or ASM at Newcastle class player
Saint great player to use in fifa great skill and speed and a cb worst nightmare highly underrated
ASM is an absolute hero. For what he does for the Newcastle community and the stick he gives Mackems fans, he deserves a statue.
Ben I love the comments. And saint maximan is class and I love the way he plays
Saint Maximin is honestly one of the best attackers in the league (on fifa lol) just kidding. One of the most entertaining players to watch
Saint-Maximin Carrying Newcastle
PLEASEEEEEE CAN I HAVE THE MAXI SHIRT BEN PLEASSSEEEEEEEEE
saint maximan always looks like a threat he is such an electric player, definitely wouldn’t like to play against him
Allan Saint maximin 🐐🐐
Wouldn’t the mind saint Gucci shirt myself😆
Saint maximum on the wing with THE GK love ittttt baller skillful and can finish can’t get better than that lads
Allan saint maxmin is the only thing that's keeping me in love with the beautiful game. My club is in absolute ruin and we have to just enjoy maxi while we have him. Id absolutely love the shirt to remember the good times, especially when he leaves for a CL club this summer.....could even be Watford if you're in net.
Saint maximin is the definition of BALLER
Allan is 👑
😏
Would love the shirt benny boy ?
Allan Saint-Maximin is a baller
Allan saint max is goated
29yrs a Newcastle fan and all of a sudden I turn on Sky Sports and think “Newcastle vs The Cycling GK, we’re all winners”… Epic work on what your teams do; ASM is the business too ;)
Baller ⚽️
Saint Maximan - 🔥
Saint maximin is a baaaaler he’s so good, the dribbles and shooting is 🔥.
St maximin is the gucci king
Saint Maximin is the most skillful player in the premier league by a long way. underrated baller.
Can I have SAINT-MAXIMN Jersey he's my idle
Love you
Saint maximin is such a baller he is so sharp and he strong and has good finishing
Saint-Maximin is baller

Alan is an absolute beasttttt how is he not starting for France
Saint max is a baller
Saint Maximins a baller
ASM is hands down the best dribbler in the premier league his ability to beat a player is next level absolute goat.
I like how natural big Bazz is lookin on the videos he is a ledge
#2 on trending 👏👏
saint maximin is honestly the best skiller in the premier league right now!
I’ll try my best then, I’m a Newcastle fan and like literally love allan he is the 🐐 and wouldn’t mind a match worn shirt from him ⚫️⚪️
Asm is absolutely outstanding and relentless
Asm=Baller
Quality video and you played a belter again, Saint-Maximin is a great player but needs to play for a top side
ASM is the GOAT (apart from yourself) and the shirt would look CLEAN on my wall next to my Blades shirt!!!
Without ASM we would be getting relegated.
We’d genuinely be doomed without Saint-Maximin. Proper player who not only gets the club and the fans, he also isn’t afraid to express his opinion on the fact Newcastle need players who’ll improve the team. Must be an absolute nightmare to play against and looks like he’s started the season with a point to prove. Be a sad, sad day when he leaves
Ben Foster I’m a massive Newcastle fan ASM is my favourite player and you are my second favourite please please can I have that shirt it would mean the world to me I’ve been begging for this dream to come true/ Ben you are a legend @The Cycling GK
Gucci man Allan is sharp 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Absolutely belting - what an ox!
the man is on another level people need to catch on man
Saint-maximin is an outrageous baller one of the most entertaining players in the prem✨
ASM is a dribbling monster
Love the videos and what a baller saint maxmin is would love to win his shirt
ASM is a big fish in a small bound, he’s knocking on a big move. Deserves regular football in the champions league.
Great video mate, just a shame we don't get to see from in the goals in the Premier league.  I'm a massive Newcastle Fan, but have a huge soft spot for Watford due to your videos now and of course Rob Elliot and Moussa.  Keep the videos coming mate, love watching them all.  P.S I'm worse than you on Fantasy, behind you on your league.
Saint maximan is sick would love his shirt
Can I get a shirt😍
No words just a baller !
Saint-Maximin he's on the wing go 1 nil down bring him in he's wearing Gucci so we're Gucci
Allan saint maximan, baller irl and in fifa 😂🔥
ASM is such a baller, a "streets won't forget" type of player along the likes of Ben Arfa, Michu ect.
I really like Allan Saint-Maximim, the way he dribbles is so sick, he's very agile and does many skills. The best thing about him is that he's got an eye on his teammates. Some skillers/dribblers are known for their big ego and they just want to score but ASM doesn't give a shit about that, he wants his team to win so he passes it to his mate to score.  It would be un unbeliaveble honour to win that jersey... Really like your channel and you as a person, you're extreme friendly and funny as well! Good luck for your next games man! C'mon the boys! Love from Switzerland.
Allan saint maximin was mad on saturday! I was there in the family stand
He is a Saint  come to utd
Comment fozzy > Saint maximan

saint-maximin is the best player outside the top 6
ASM is destined to be signed by one of the "big 4" in the EPL. Trickery and flair is something that the EPL has lacked in recent years.
saint maximin is a baller, second coming of isma sarr in my books
have i missed something wheres gopro in the goal in the recent games
Viva Newcastle Allan the goat
asn was good but sarr was better 💪💪
Saint-maximin a baller in my fantasy team
Saint maxamin is absolute class but over looked die to the team he is at. Sorry Newcastle. Needs a move to a club a little further up as an arsenal fan I'd live him but chealsea await
Watched these vids from the start, first time I’ve seen my team on it though 🙌🏼🙌🏼 ⬛️⬜️⬛️⬜️⬛️⬜️  Ben, you’re getting so comfortable with that camera in hand! Absolute natural. Keep it up…. Up the Fozcast! Up the Dilsh! Up the Mags! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

As an NUFC fan, Allan Saint-Maximin is the one who gives us hope and excitement; lighting up the stage with twists and turns. He’s the reason we, not just as Newcastle fans but as fans in general, watch football - to see brilliance and entertainment.
Saint maximan = baller

up the toon , ALLAN SAINT MAXIMINNNN
ASM is absolute class, his dribbling skills and pace are almost unmatched, if he keeps this up I can see him making a big move in the summer. Would love to get his shirt, always watch his games
maxi is a baller🔥
ASM is a silky bugger the way he moves with the ball and the pace on him is mental🤯
What makes asm so entertaining to watch is the fact that it looks like he isn't sure what he is going to do with the ball, must be a nightmare for opponents
ASM definitely doesn't realise how good he is
My mate is a huge Newcastle fan. And his birthday is coming up soon this shirt would be the best gift 💪 love the channel mate keep it up
Dear Roadmen, Please I want you to make a drill song out of this song then message me. I can’t wait to see the product ​  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_xkQAxyf-o​
Allan Saint Maximan = Pace
Both Ben and ASM, prob the most overlooked players in the league atm! Never stop amazing everyone.
Baller heading for the top.
Allan saint maximin is Newcastles dream
Asm what a player saw him when i went to watch Leeds at Newcastle, absolutely stupidly quick and my word his shots can travel as well
As a 13 year old Newcastle fan I don’t know what I would do without ASMs silky skills at Newcastle
St maximan is a joke. He could play anywhere. Needn't bother washing his shirt for me 🤟
Anyone watching Saint-Maximin and not seeing he's another level needs to go and watch another sport.
Different Gravy
Unlucky with that longstaff strike mate, so well struck and moving a bit. Watford so fun to watch this year though congrats on the success!!
let me win please
Saint-maximin is the shining light that Newcastle have at the min great player at a great club, just need a great owner which they deserve
Saint Maximan is a class player, but luckily Ben was in goal to get the point for us big performance from the Cycling GK. COYH 🐝🐝⚽️⚽️
Saint M. Top 3 fastest in the Premier League  #factz
ASM is Newcastle right now, he is unbelievable and if he leaves in Jan we will go down for sure. Electric player, you don’t know what he’s going to do, and a legend on twitter to. I wonder what was going through your head when he was running at you after that failed back pass haha. You did well. Top video as always.
Saint Maximan is excellent player, but with Ben in goal we managed to get the point COYH 🐝🐝⚽️⚽️

Might as well give this a go because I'm a Newcastle fan, I love Saint-Maximin for how much love he shows to the club. Sure watching him is great, but for me the best part is just the love he shows to the fans and the club as a whole.
ASM will be a streets won’t forget like Adel Taarabt
As a toon fan, ASM is a hero for us, exactly the type of player we love to watch like Ben Arfa, Ginola, Robert them amazing french wingers we’ve had in the past.

SAINT MAXIMIN, ON THE WING
I can’t lie the reason I like ASM is cause since 2002 before all the fame and footy he was wearing headbands and embraces it soo much. The fact that they made him covering up the Gucci logo but still wears it shows that not any money will get him to take it off
Gucci baller ⛹️

Allan saint maximin one of my favourite players the last two seasons. I brought him into my fantasy football team last year and he racked up some points for me. I obviously have him this year aswell just got me 8 points.I love the way he can make something out of nothing for Newcastle and when he cuts out then in then out then in dribbling and then bang into the bottom corner, outside the box. He is also one of my favourite players to use in FIFA.

Miss the go pro
ASM needs to pass more... I watched him against us and is a bit of a ballhog... Just my opinion , quality player tho
Saint-Maximin: Such an entertaining player to watch, looking forward to his future and where it takes him
Saint-Maximin is world class, been following him since 2017 when I first saw him play
ASM by far the best outside the big 6 absolute wizard
Big baz the beast
Allan is a baller, brings hope to our team. Passionate with the fans and City and he single handedly is one of the reason fans return to the stadium with the current situation with Bruce and Ashley
Hi Ben, excellent performance at the weekend and that’s coming from a NUFC fan myself. ASM is a great player and I don’t know where NUFC would be without him. Love the videos and I am subsribed and like every video. Would love to win Allans shirt would mean the world to me, thanks. Will
Gucci gang
Saint Maximin is a baller and is only going to get better. One of the most exciting players to watch in the prem.
I’m a huge NUFC fan and an even bigger Cycling GK fan - that ASM shirt would make my year 🙏🤝

ASM is an absolute baller. I know every defender gets worried when he's coming up against him. Wouldn't suprised if you see fullbacks getting Maximitis before matchdays 😂
ASM along with literally only 2 or 3 players (taarabt, ben arfa) are the players that make me want to go and play football. Honestly incredible, ASM is my favourite player to watch right now, would be over the moon with the shirt.
He’s wearing Gucci so we Gucci?
Hi Ben   He is one of the most skilful players
Saint Maxamin is soooo under rated, he is such a sicko with his skills and dribbling. Very entertaining.

Allan Saint-Maximin is probably the most skillful player in the Premier League. Man's dribbling is absolutely insane. Quick feet and bandana makes him look like a ninja on the pitch. Absolutely love him. (Also he is unbelievable in Fifa :D). I want to thank you, Ben for making enjoyable content on Youtube. I make sure to always watch your videos, but I have not taken a part in any of the giveaways just yet. I hope that my first one ends in victory. Good luck on your journey on and off the pitch. <3

Hi Cycling GK, discovered your channel recently and been binging hard on it!  As a Newcastle fan I was especially looking forward to this episode and ASM is one of our few reasons to be cheerful at the minute!  Fair enough, you did manage to keep him quiet on the goal front but he got an assist for the Longstaff goal, time to put him in your FPL team?  He got bonus points as well!
Saint maximin is a baller. He has always had skills and playmaking even since OGC Nice
Ozannn🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Alot of people ask us (PL fans) about why this is the best league in the world. I truly believe it’s not just the “big six” that make it big, but the presence of magical players like St. Maximin in almost every other PL team too! Would love his jersey! Thank you for this vlog ❤️🤙🏻
My brother thinks St maximin ain't any good, always arguing with him. He's proper baller

The streets haven't seen a baller like Saint-Maximin since Adel Taarabt  What a ledge.
Saint-Maximin: His dribbling is second to none. What a player, so talented and it seems this season he starts to finally reward himself with more goals and assists. Interesting fact is that he signed a 6-year deal last year. So in the future there might be a big money move ahead.
Saint maximin EY

He’s a legend up and coming I think he will be a special player!
ASM what a baller
Asm is alright at best
I'd love ASM to come to Watford in the near future.  Amazing player to watch.  Imagine him and Sarr in the same team.  We would be unstoppable.  I'd love to win his shirt and give it to my boys.  One has austim and both are  crazy about football. Ben keep up the great work with Cycling GK.  It's fantastic. Best regards Gary

Saint Maximin is our best player with Wilson out he is our only hope
What’s the point of EPL banning GoPro in goals? What are they afraid of.. not like the EFL Championship is an amateur league either.
Maxi is a world class baller, if he gets a move to big 6 club he’ll be one of the best in the league!!!
Allan Saint-Maximin should be playing for a top 6 team imo
ASM potential to go to the top if he works on his end product
Saint Maximim on the wing
gucci gucci gucci
He’s a tricky balla
ASM is my favorite football player. He's just so entertaining to watch and not only is he class on the pitch but he's class off the pitch too. He's truly a role model to many. I also love how he keeps trolling Sunderland 💀. Forever a Magpie

St. Maximin is like Adama with better hair and way less muscle and body oil.  However I've got a bone to pick you sir.  I thought for sure I'd get a shirt by now.  We had a good talk last week.  Nothin...  Honestly, if this continues, "fumin'."  If you make it right, "buzzin.'"  nah just a "bitta banter!"  Keep it up you"absolute lege!".  P.s. stop putting ketchup on everything; be a bit more selective "mate!" Much love

Saint-Maximin is an absolute beast on and off the ball, his ability to dribble the ball and get shots away amazes me.

Saint Maximam is an absolute baller
Asm is by far the best player to watch in the league. What a player.
As a geordie myself he is the only reason I’m still watching the toon everyweek!
ASM is the most skillful and unpredictable player in the prem. Met him in Newcastle, what a baller.
Saint-Maximin may be sharp but rumor has it he’s still in the cycling GK’s pocket
You actually cant follow the man. He even fakes the camera crew.
ASM is actually scary good defo underrated
ASM is the silkiest player in the prem
Why is there no more go pro in the goal
Saint-maximine on the wing
Super entertaining vlogs! It makes us from other parts of the world feel a little bit closer to all the action Saint-Maximin has super skills with the ball and has an incredible pace, very exciting player to watch as well Love the vlogs mate
SM is a top player. His top would look class in my laddies room 🙌

Absolute positive vibes from your videos, Ben. Like PieFace said, Heroes, everyone.  Allan Saint-Maximin is an absolute baller, it's only a matter of time before the top guns come calling. Love from India.
What happened to the gopro in the goal
Ben ya legend!! ASM so exciting to watch!
If u wanna be saved today read this. The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23. And to go to heaven we need to be perfect revelation 21:27. But God says we can't earn our salvation because we aren't perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  we simply believe on Jesus Christ's   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. And it's only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47. And from This we know Jesus alone saved us from our sins  not by our works as Ephesians shows but by Grace through Faith in Him. And we can know we are saved through 1John 5:12-13. Have a good day.
Saint-Maximin is an absolute beast love him!!
Newcastle paying £16.5 mil for ASM was a steal. Such a skillful player.
worse than playing against Allan Saint-Maximin is having a son who has him as his captain in the fantasy team.  thank you for all your vlogs and greetings from sunny Switzerland!
Class vlog again Ben , ASM is frightening, not be long till he’s in a top 6 prem  club

🔥 as always
Saint-Maximin, what a player. Not as good as you though!
Saint-maximin is class going to chelsea in the summer be the next hazard🐐
ASM kills it on the pitch and is always so exciting to watch, but also comes across as a great professional and great bloke in every interview or bit of content I have seen, and his social media is often a great laugh, and as a neutral, all of that makes him a super likeable player and entertaining player to watch.
Saint- maximin is such a baller! Great videos Ben!
I do not know who he is, but just give me the shirt man
Saint max he is an absolute baller
Allan is the Goat love him at Newcastle desperate for him to stay would love to bump into him in town some day.

Allan Saint Maximin is probably my most lovely footballer outside of my fav club! His speed, determination and dribble skill is just unbearable for any defender. What a brilliant player he is #howaythelads ❤️
ASM. The streets won’t forget. Newcastle’s saving grace every week would mean the world to me as a Newcastle fan. Yesterday my local club folded that I’ve played at since I was 13 so would love to win this shirt would honestly make my year. Cheers Ben.
Allan Saint Maximum Is A fast player with the ball and i like his song also..
Saint-Maximim - Simple. Pure Class.
BALLER is the perfect word to describe Saint-Maximin And wholesome is the perfect word to describe the cycling GK

Skills of neymar, confidence of cantona. Class player
Amazed you haven't got Saint-Maximin in your fantasy football team.
Saint-Maximin is a beast! Killing it in my current rebuild of Newcastle on FM21 👌🏻👌🏻
Saint Maximin sharper than a Stanley knife 🔪🔥

Fozzy what a legend, love these Vlogs......where do you start with Saint maximin at the moment what a player and shines through at Newcastle! Scares every team each time he touches the ball! Joke of a player
ASM is a baller so scary on the ball would be scared to play him
Alan the main man. WHAT A BEAST
ASM is such a baller, best player by a mile for Newcastle and such a joy to watch. Needs to stay in the PL!
The fullback knows it’s game over as soon as ASM puts on his Lv headband
ASM is a machine
ASM is actually op. You did an excellent job against him
It's mad  Mbappé and ASM played together at AS Monaco must have been deadly pace in that team
Allan Saint-Maximin is exactly what us Newcastle fans love to see in a player. He brings excitement and anticipation every time he has the ball at his feet and makes things happen. A baller and a hero!
Saint maximin = baller
Saint maximans a rare breed of footballer you dont find in the prem anymore
Saint maximin is such a legend, he loves the fans and always score fpl points for us as well. Btw he almost got another assist with the last minute through ball against you that day. Pick me please ❤️❤️

King Maxi!!! Man I’d love that shirt. He’s incredible and by far the best player at our club
Allan is just amazing to watch, he is so good!
Allan saint maximin is actually dad
Only ASM can wear a Gucci Headband in the Prem and get away with it, Top class.
saint-maximin is fucking decent, but he’s being run into the ground by newcastle as they’re so dependent on him to pull something out the bag each and every game, also a tad selfish in the final third at points, but if he leaves newcastle, mixed with how he’s so young at 24, he’ll have a bright career ahead of him
Big up Aaron Ramsdale, he's definitely proving his doubters wrong at Arsenal. Hope big Bez gets his back sorted! Keep up the great content Ben 💪  PS: please save a penalty or two against Leeds mate, we need the fpl points 🔥
ASM is a beast! Would love nothing more than see him at next to Sarr!😎❤
What is left to say about Allan Saint-Maximin? MBP - Most Ballin'est Player
Tricks for days, shame there’d no Gucci head band
All respect to Callum Wilson but ASM playing a more attacking role was extremely dangerous he’s so tricky on the ball.
Ben foster might the nicest person on this Earth , no joke.
baller
ASM- The man is a baller and an underrated player in the PL
Legend, electric, a worry
Saint maximin is a wicked baller! Best of luck for the rest of the season Ben, except when you play arsenal 🤣
Allans given more headaches than tequila
You in the Gucci headband… you are fucking gravy. What a player so much technical skill. See him playing champions league football next season. Would thrive under Klopp or Pep

Saint-maximin’s pace is frightening. Such a legendary player
Saint-Maximin is an amazing footballer, hopefully can see him in the france squad more often as well 😁
ASM is a baller, you're never sure what trick he's going to pull out next. He's a legend on Twitter as well, some of the tweets he puts out are amazing!
amazing content, only thing missing is the go pro in the goal, maybe put it in the oppositions goal so king can finally get his goal! ASM is one of my favourite non watford players, he's electric, surely one of the big boys will come in for him
Saint-Maximin has Adama Traore vibes when he gets the ball. Lifts the whole ground, he’s electric and so entertaining
ASM - ballerrrrrr
the guy is a baller
Allan Saint Maximin is as you say a baller. So entertaining to watch unless he's playing against your team!  But you kept him out so maybe hes not  that scary in game after all. Really good on fifa too xD! love the videos from Australia!

ASM: The next big Dmitri Payet🔥🔥🔥
Saint max is a baller
Goat
asm= baller. enough said.
Hey Ben, how was the ref (Jarred Gillett)? He started in the lower leagues in Australia and worked his way up to the top league in Australia now he is in the premier league. it is sick to see an Australian and the first non-English or Irish ref in the premier league
ASM and almiron together is basically just fifa street compilations
My son is absolutely obsessed with Saint Maximin, he’s only just really started liking football and Maxi is his idol Already! great vlog Ben!
St Maximum is just a Absolute baller
ASM is a quality player, fast skilful with an 👁 for goal, does the shirt come with a gucci headband 😉
What. A. Player. Saint-Maximin, and Ben! What a bunch of great saves! Kept your team in it and a well earned point.
ASM - don't know which is better, watching him on the ball or watching his Twitter. Both class!
ASM definitely has the potential to end up in the top PL club
Sarr and ASM on the wing?! FPL go on then
saint-maximin is just that guy who would always win the 100m at school
ASM, box of tricks. Must be a nightmare for yourself & defenders as he doesn’t know what he’s doing so how can you. Finally he doesn’t take himself seriously and seems to enjoy life. True entertainment
Allan saint maximin well where do I start SEXY FAST AGILE FRENCH and simply UNREAL would love the shirt as I’m a Newcastle fan
Got into some meaty argument with someone, and I was saying Saint-Maximin should’ve come back with Joe Willock to Arsenal. Now sat here heartbroken that Willock has left 💔 Maximin - What a player
The Saint is an absolute baller. As a Newcastle fan from Belfast I can only dream of going over to see him ball out in person. Don’t think there’s a football fan that doesn’t appreciate him
Saint-Maxim is a insanely good player, especially on fifa. 😅 thank you for the content 🙏
Saint maximin is every defenders nightmare. You name a trick, he can do it.

Underrated baller. Surprised doesn’t have a big move yet
Heeee is gucci
ASM is one of those players who you can't keep your eye off! Got a friend at work who is a massive Newcastle fan and he recently got married. I think I'd be the best co-worker in the world if I rocked up to the office with that beauty as a wedding gift.
St.Maximin is a great winger very inspiring for me as a 14 year old footballer myself , I mean it would be motivational to have his jersey

That guy is a beast, only a matter of time some big club comes for him...like watford 😀
Love Allan Saint-Maximin playstyle, his pace and dribbling! WOW😍

Can we get a Sarr appearance in next video the man has been unbelievable! I guess ASM has been fire for Newcastle too
Mesmerizing Maximin. What a player
ASM absolute baller
Allan is the French jay jay okocha. They guy’s a baller

Saint maximin has 6 star skills but Steve Bruce is definitely faster than him
Saint Maximin is so entertaining to watch when he is on a counter

Baller and even better with the Twitter banter.
Maxi is my favourite player, as a Newcastle fan I think he might be our only hope

Siant maximan is a beast
Unfortunately he will be away from Newcastle in the January transfer window.
Allain Saint-Maximan is a beast, he surely should be in  better team, some Premier or even Bundesliga team, but Im happy he at least helps Newcastle to remain a decent team and brings them creativity and explosion
Saint Max is such a silky player the way he can pull off skills the way he does it’s insane he’s so good he has a song named after him
Plz me
Fantastic guy really good
ASM - baller on the pitch, baller on Twitter. Take care and stay safe Ben!

Gucci balla
Allen Saint-Maximin is a freaking legend!
Allan is fast and good at shooting but will never make any goals on you
Saint-Maximin’s dribbling is absolutely unreal. However , as a Newcastle fan, he needs to work on his vision a bit more. If he did that, he would easily be considered one of the best wingers in the PL
Allan Saint-Maxim is just the beast! Apart from ben ofcourse
When I watch Allan saint maximum my tv starts shaking from all the step overs he does in the game he’s just a true baller
ASM is an absolute baller, very underrated
ASM is an absolute Legend!!! The ball sticks to the mates foot like glue. Absolute baller and he’s a very underrated winger in the prem as well as Sarr!!!!!!

i think saint-maximin is the very future of epl football
asm most entertaining player to watch in the prem, a king in my book
Allan Saint maximin is the definition of a baller i Think he should play for a better team as watford😉
Man like Saint is a good dribbler can improve on his finishing but he is still learning good player and he will benefit lots when Wilson is back
Allan is going places big time
What went through your mind on that Newcastle's final chance Ben?
ASM is a beast, love watching the lad.
ASM has skills for days and is so effective
ASM is too good for Newcastle which is a shame for a club like that to say something like it but he is amazing. Brings energy to any game! Keep it up content is amazing

Hey Ben, I would absolutely love the ASM shirt! I’m a Newcastle fan from Australia, have been ever since I was a kid watching games on video tape with my dad, though I’ve sadly never made it over to St James’ to see us play live (at least not yet!). ASM is my favourite NUFC player, what a baller! Just pure fun, never sure what he’s going to do. Anyway, keep up the great content mate!
ASM is a baller, defo should be playing in a top 6 club

saintmaximin baller man needs a better club
Where is the go pro in goal
Go pro in goal??
ASM Is a beauty, love that he always interacts with fans on social media
Saint Maxim has to make defenders nervous. He's pacey, he's got quick feet, he's plays with purpose and always looks to put them on the back foot. He's done well for me in fantasy as well which is handy
I'm a Newcastle fan and I absolutely love Allan, he's my favourite player and we will probably be relegated without him, he's an absolute legend, i would do anything to get his shirt.
I love Saint-Maximin he’s has it all in him, the skills, pace, shooting, dribbling, absolute baller in the prem!
Keep up the great work legend! Keen to get my hands on that Saint-Maximin jersey. Hella quick that Geezer is

Still in lockdown here in Melbourne, Australia so times are a bit tough but this video has made my day! Keep pushing out the content Ben, it's honestly electric, just like ASM! ;)
ASM has that feel about him of star power, wouldn't be surprised to see him snapped up by the biggest. What a player.
Kylian Mbappé called Allan Saint-Maximin a misunderstood genius when they were both at Monaco. He’s the modern day Hatem Ben Arfa. Geordies love themselves a French #10. I’ll take the kit you absolute legend Fozy. Come on the boys
Ur a legend on and off the pitch! Keep up the great content!
C’mon the boys!!!!
Why isn’t the go pro in the goal?
I watch Newcastle just to watch Saint-Maximin ball on the pitch🔥🔥.. I tell my bros just watch that guy he will win you the game ✊🏻✊🏻..
Maximan is a beast.
ASM, it's always exciting when the ball is at his feet
I think ASM is the best player in the world.

ASM is honestly the most entertaining footballer for me atm, uni housemate is from Newcastle & we’ve loved him and his gucci headband for a while now aha
Define Saint Maximin: A Saint from France who plays to the absolute Maximin for Newcastle!!!! Aren't we all lucky to be able to watch this maestro play!!!!
ASM is a legend! Helping me climb the Cycling GK Fantasy league, one GW at a time (but still in 75,541st place). Would gladly sport his shirt!
Yeyeye
Saint maxim legit needs to sign for a top 4 club guys a baller so underated

Allan Saint-Maximin is one of, if not the most entertaining players in the Prem right now. when he gets the ball you just know he could do something special with it.
saint maximin is a baller!
Asm is the best skiller in the league, apart from rashy
If ASM can keep Newcastle up he deserves a big money move
Big fan from California love the content much love
Hi Ben, absolutely love your content and what a player you are too. One thing I would like to see back is the GoPro in the goal, that content is banging. But like I say your content is smashing and no matter what you do I'll be watching every video, smashing that like button, and look forwards to the Leeds vlog. Leeds have an amazing atmosphere so enjoy it mate. Absolute Legend of a bloke you are.   P.S. I start you every week on fantasy

ASM is too cold with the skills😍
Ben Foster, great Gk and even greater guy off the pitch!

ASM: a man who is exciting to watch with his pace and finishing ability. When you add his online banter it makes for an entertaining footballer :)
Insane skill and sillkiness on the ball Allan bleeming saint maximam
Alan Saint Maximin’s footwork and skills are among the best on this planet. Quite an underrated baller to be fair.
Saint-Maximin is a tank - silky dribbler, dirty skills - absolute baller.
Is he not allowed to have a GoPro in the goal anymore?
Allan Saint-Maximin is my screen saver. I love the guy to bits and as a Newcastle fan I hope he doesn't leave us. Good game. Wish I could have made it to the match but duty calls at work unfortunately. Love your channel. Keep it up. ⚽🙌🚴
ASM is just a baller. Just playing 2005 fifa street in the prem      Would love to get his kit

Love from India 🇮🇳💙  I don't think you can send that give away jersey to this faaaaar😊🙂🥲
Most skilful winger in the prem right now big potential to be a serial winner

ASM is the boy! One of the better dribblers in the prem. Decent shout in FPL too.
Allan is the best
Woahhh I’d love that shirt
Lovely seeing Big Bazzlar back🙌 wish him a speedy recovery
So annoying that he can’t have his camera
ASM is a beast, got me 8 points in FPL the goat
Saint Maximin's skills are insane. absolute baller! I would love to win the giveaway.  come on the boys!!!
Allan is just an absoloute baller! Rarely see many better players with that sort of ball control and electric pace.
ASM would be a top ten player if he transferred to a top club. With the right service he could be insane
ASM is so underrated!!!! Absolutely deserves a move to a champions league club...... and get this absolute baller a French cap pls. Loving the vlogs..... still sad about the - no gopro in goal tho
Ben why would you wash it 😩😩😩😩😩😩🥵😛
SAINT-MAXIMIN is nothing short of a freak. Can do wonders with the football!!
Saint-Maximin slots into any side in the world absolute baller every-time he plays and gives his all for a club with such rich history, he knows what it means to play for Newcastle and turns up every week for the Geordies ⚽️❤️💪🏽
Gucci Allan! What a player, should be a 6⭐️ skiller in FIFA!
Troost is a legend
The swagger and style ASM brings both on and off the pitch genuinely brings a smile to my face! His stepovers are sharp!!
ASM you beauty
ASM inspired me to get a fake Gucci headband from eBay. Legend.
ASM is an absolute baller even back when he played in France. Love your videos
Come on the boys
st maximam most underrated attacker in the prem at the moment!! serious baller
Allan Saint -Maximin the French Kwadwo Baah what a ledge
Saint Maximin is a baller, but you will always be the number one in the prem. Love from the USA

ASM gives me a heart attack whenever he plays utd!
Saint-Maximin 😍😍 He’s very talented and underrated player

Absolute baller
Gucci maneeeeeee
I think Allan Saint-Maximin is the best dribbler in the league just gimme the shirt please i love him so much
Cheers Ben! It’s great to see you starting again!I’m flying to London from the US this Thursday and might try and catch a game while I’m over there.
Saint maximan is one of the best dribblers in the prem, he’s electric and can create exciting football
He's an awesome player
ASM you cant describe what he does, miss him with the. Gucci headband has plenty of talent that boy does.
Love watching Allan Saint-Maximin do his tricks, just bought him in my FPL team
is Lauren single? Asking for a friend.
Always look forward to these videos they’re sooooo good
ASM is a great player, so skilled and also very quick, hard to stop in attack and is Newcastle's best player imo. He is  still only young so potential through the roof.
The god not only on the pitch but a god in fifa! What a guy
ASM is honestly the most skillful current player in the prem, love watching the guy dribbling past defenders and absolutely cracking defensive lines on his own😂
The guys a beast, shame he’ll be leaving us in the near future to seek bigger and better things, life as a Newcastle Fan is depressing 😂😂
I’m curious for the ppl who actually win the shirts do they just never wash them or do they wear them themselves
Saint Max, where do I start, my favourite player to watch in the premier league.. He has everything, he is quick, great strike on him, creates chances and can dance around a defender with ease. What's not to love?? Dedicated Newcastle player and a great guy off the pitch.
Imagine actually winning a match worn shirt from a pro
ASM is an absolute baller - proper action packed, skilful winger! Worth staying up at midnight in Sydney to see you playing in net. Loving the content mate!
Do you pick people from the US? Big fan of the channel and of course a bug fan of you! I always look for Watford to win 🏆
I want the shirt
Saint-Maximin is an absolute beast of a baller
The legend ramdale. Future Arsenal captain! Loved the vlog! Seeing what you eat and the hotel rooms is the best part! Keep it up and keep going. 🔥🤞🏼

ASM absolute magician, however not even a player as good as ASM can get through the wall that is the Cycling GK  - some brilliant saves against NUFC 🔥
ASM is just class he’s such a game changer
Ben Foster meets the nicest people, because those people have met Ben Foster.  This man is a legend.  I want to say Ben will have a great career in TV after football, but that would be selling Ben too short.  Ben could literally do anything from hosting his own talk show to running  a variety show.  Literally I'm hooked on this channel now.  I clicked the sub button today and should have done it long ago.  From an American, thanks for the amazing entertainment Ben!
Ben I love the vlogs!!!! Good luck this season, hope to see Watford Europa Conference league!!! Much love from the US of A!!!!!!

ASM proper baller and tears up teams for fun mate
the best way to describe ASM, an absolute freak on fifa, makes everyone quake in their boots
ASM baller
That little touch foster got on the ball when allan saint-maximin when round him was world class.
ASM YEA THE BOYS
Saint-Maximan is the best player in the prem after The Cycling GK of course!
ASM has always been in my Fantasy team... A genuinely good baller..
Maxi is the only thing really keeping us going at the moment. The only thing you look up to currently is him dribling past players like they are not there! The excitement he bring to us as Newcastle fans 🖤🤍🖤 and fans around the world in indescribable. Of course the fear he bring into the opposition defenders and fans also is what I absolutely love about him :) Great content as usual ben 🔥🔥🔥
Saint max, legend on and off the pitch
The headband bandit , man moves like he is on electric ball
Allan saint maximin is probably if not the best one of the best dribblers in the league
Big up the bus driver tell him I hope his back feels better
I have been a NCFC fan all my football life and right now there is not alot to be happy about or to watch the games except The saint. He is by far the most fun player to watch. Giving away R10 vibes. Great vlog again Fozz.
ASM is an absolute baller, he has been so good for Newcastle this season.
Saint-Maximin is one of my favourite footballers to watch! Love from Australia ❤️
Keep up the great content mate, on the pitch and on the screen!     oh and also that Saint-Maximin shirt would be friggin awesome!
Ben Foster you are the future! For someone who spends their whole game inside the box you really thought outside of it. You’ve inspired King Ekong to start a youtube channel. Saint Maximin is a baller and such a skilled player - but does he have a YouTube channel? It wouldn’t surprise me if in a few months he did!.. The insight and change of perspective you give people is incredible.Well done, keep up the amazing work on and off the pitch! Hero lad. I can definitely see more players picking up a go pro and delivering their fans this kind of content in the future 😊
Skills god op saint max
Messi has a first goal on psg🥶🥶🥶
ASM is the goat nothing else needed
Saint-Maximin is an absolute BALLER
Best dribbler in the PL. The French Mbappe. (Oh wait😉😉)
Hes an absolute baller so fast and so good
Saint Maximin is pure class, one of the most entertaining players to watch full stop and seems like a laugh. Good seeing rammers in the vlog, gutted when he left the blades but I'm glad he's won the Arsenal fans over & is fighting for #1

FPL team not bad mate but think some necessary changes 1. Torres down to Sarr, or Gray if not allowed other Watford players 2. Needs Trent  3. Change Allan  Also probably change Rondon
ASM is an absolute beast, one of the best one on one dribblers and skillets atm, unstoppable.
Allan saint maximin is a an absolute baller mans brilliant.
St Max is the best dribbler in the league

Absolutely love you Ben, never in doubt when you're in net but when Saint max is on the ball it always gets me a little bit worried and excited. when i'm watching these game at 2am in the morning i'm always having a belter. World class ballers.
Come on Ben. Please do NOT concede goals as you are in my FPL team.
I’m not sure if it’s already been mentioned or not, are the premier league not allowing the GoPro in the net?

Massive Newcastle fan just a note on ASM he’s by far and away the best player we’ve had for years I think if he has the ability to become what Ben arfa should’ve, he’s loved by the fans so much too on and off the pitch he’s the reason we get results, special special player ❤️
He's a baller , ASM 👍
ASM is an absolute beast!
Newcastle’s best player !
Allan saint maximan is the most exciting player I have ever seen play the game and I believe should be given a chance at a bigger club
Massive Newcastle fan, I would absolutely love that shirt. Asm is the only player that has kept me passionate about newcastle through all the takeover shenanigans, the poor form and Mike Ashley in particular. I look forward to watching Newcastle because of him, haven't seen a player like it in a Newcastle shirt since Ben arfa. Thought we had it when Murphy was through on goal at the end also 😢.
Saint maximin is a absolute Baller but he can’t get past the goat Ben foster

He’s absolute baller, love the content Benny

Saint-Max a proper player on his way to the big teams in no time
Asm is an absolute cracking player, however if your team is after him don’t he’s just a fancy passer 👀 yeah don’t even try to buy him 😀
Gucci is a mad baller Love the content benny, keep it up. Love from Melbourne
What can I say about ASM?! Well the man is a French baller, A naturally gifted goal scorer, Will he become a Newcastle United veteran, Or a bigger club (no offence Newcastle) legend,  Over powered on FIFA too,  there ain’t any defence he can’t get through, Whether he’s at home or away,  he’s a living legend just like The Cycling GK
the way ASM brings the ball up is simply breathtaking no joke
Ben’s editing skills are getting better and better each and every video!
New Zealand lets gooooooooooooooo
asm can be explained in one word - baller 👑
Saint maximin is ridiculous, like traore but has skills.
ASM the one highlight of being a Newcastle fan atm

ASM is absolutely class. Great guy off the pitch too.
Love the videos Ben and the team. Saint-Maximn is a proper baller.
ASM is an absoloute baller
I just love the way you interact with all the staff and players, always brings a smile to my face. Aaron Ramsdale is shining in goal so far, and ASM is always fun to watch. Great to see you back in goal Ben — some top saves this match!
Saint maximum is indescribable
Saint-Maximim is honestly the most underrated player in the league, bags of potential and will go far! Wonder if Watford will have the funds for him 👀😏 Ismaila and ASM on the wings will be a nightmare for defenders 🤣
Love ASM he’s a best and will probs be at one of the big boys next year love that shirt keep up the blogs ben

It’s the Baz’s driving the coach and the Linda’s behind the scenes that keep a football community running but never get mentioned on Match of the Day or Sky Sports and that’s why your vlogs Ben Foster are so special, so fans can see the every day running of a football club by normal humans
ASM is the greatest thing to come out of France since croissants. my goat.

Saint-Maximin is a menace for the Goalies - But incredible to watch for everyone else!
I’ve know about him since the end of his ogc nice days. Ever since I’ve watched him play I am amazed as he plays football with so much flair and it’s joyful to watch him play. Him and Salah and Trent are my fav player in the prem (I’m a LFC fan)can’t forget the goat tho (Big ben ur a legend), But I would be so grateful to win it. Even if I can’t I am happy that I had a chance and whoever wins it I hope will be as happy as I would be. Much love from Cornwall ⚽️🥅

Alain Saint Maximin is just a phenomenon. Watched him play during his Nizza days, electric, fast, agile, skilful, just delightful and relieving to watch such a baller play.
Amazing job with the vlogs Ben, this is such good content. <3
Saint-Max is a baller, undoubtedly. But… I bet he can’t drive a bus like Big Bazzlar! Buzzin to see him back ❤️
ASM is a freaking baller. One of the best dribblers out there and always doing mad skills. Last but not least a very funny guy especially on Twitter.
ASM the next big thing he probably would save one of the north london clubs european hopes if he moves there this season
asm is so so good, his dribbling and pace is frighting. would love him at arsenal!
Love maxi the magic man
ASM IS absolutely insane. The things he does in games are mental. Great vid Ben
Hi Ben, You probably won’t see this but obv asm is a baller and I would love to get that shirt as I am a massive Newcastle fan and have supported them my whole life but I live in Northampton which is about 5 hours away from Newcastle so I would love to have that shirt so I always have something down here in relation to NUFC among all of my replica stuff. Thank you so much for the possible opportunity to win the shirt and as always ur a legend and can’t wait for your next upload.
Allan saint maximin is an absolute baller he’s so quick on and off the ball with beating defenders, his got amazing skills and a very good strike, I’d say his to good for his own team
ASM has just unreal dribbling and can pick apart any defence just by himself.
ASM one of the best dribblers IF NOT the BEST dribbler in the league!!
Maxi is our main chance of survival this season great player that loves the club. Big fan of the channel Watford is defo my second team these days
Saint-Maxamin is that year 11 who plays with the year 7s just to show off. Only difference is that he does it in the prem
An absolute monster of a player real dark horse of the premier league can and will be a special player
ASM is an extremely talented player just crazy!
What I think of saint-maximim, is that she should be straight in your fantasy team for Saturday.
ASM is a baller!
Gnooooooommmmmmm, rapid mate
Allen is a “friggin legend”
Ben, Ronaldo wouldn’t be happy with your desert choices 😊…….    ASM is a baller and arguably the best dribbler in the prem
Pint of fosters?
What a legend you r ben and what a player saint is
As a Lifelong Newcastle fan I’d absolutely love the Saint-Maximin shirt😍 he, alongside Callum wilson, will be the sole reasons of us staying up this season!

Saint-Max is an absolute baller! Would love to get that Shirt. And also, big up the Cycling GK. Greetings from Germany #cyclinggkinternational
Saint-Maximin is honestly the most enjoyable player to watch in the premier league. Runs rings around defenders and teams week after week, baller
Since I'm in Brazil and the channel that shows the Prem apparently hate them Hornets and never let us see your games, I was buzzing for 30 something minutea thinking the boys had won the match after seeing the notification of a late goal. Onto the next one though. So happy that your back in the lineup as well. Congrats and good luck!
Baller

Saint maximin may be the most fun person to watch in the premier league right now every time he touches the ball he does something with it and hes a very skillful player. Keep up the vlogs Ben

Alan Saint Maximin is such a baller aye, I’d love his jersey keep up the quality Vlogs Ben!

Is the go pro not allowed in the goal anymore mate ?!!
Saint-maximin wow, what a player, one of those players that no matter who you support or like he just has that ability to make everyone you say wow, that X factor that players have that can’t be taught just a beautiful player, understands exactly how the game should be played the way he uses talent and skill and beats men but to actually implement in a game to help the team try and win is incredible, what a player absolutely love the guy. Great Vlog mate 👍🏻

I think if football didn’t carry on going so well for SM then salsa dancing with those feet would be electric
Asm is slept on by big clubs, surprised he isn’t playing champions league yet
Saint-Maximin is my favourite player in the world, I’m a big newcastle fan was disappointed we didn’t win on Saturday but at least this vlog makes it’s a bit better 🙃

ASM is ridiculous
ASM, what a player, luckily I get to watch him week in week out ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
He’s the shining light in a maddening Toon World.

Saint max is the most amazing dribbler in the league, honestly his dribble package is so diffrent and amusing to see, top underrated player
Saint -maximin is a Total baller
I first saw saint maximin while attending the côte d’azur derby between Nice and Marseille in 2018, and instantly new the player was special! He made the game fun to watch even though it ended 0-0. He’s a real problem in the prem and if he can keep injury free one of the big guns will pick him up, could easily see him in Spurs!
ASM is a baller would love the shirt
Underrated absolute joke some of the skills he pulls out in games🔥🔥
Allan saint maximin the 🐐 clear of Messi
asm is a machine

ASM is a goat, great to watch, would love his shirt
ASM’s fast feet and ability to create makes him such a HUGE asset for Newcastle - also a good value fantasy football option!

Asm is just unreal
ASM is the only thing we have to look forward to when Newcastle play
ASM A BALLER
ASM is so underrated in the prem! If he isn’t playing for a top 6 side next season something is wrong!! Huge fan of him!!
Remember when Saint-Maximin wore his $500 Gucci headband in a match.
ASM is a bloody magician mate
ASM is a baller
Allan my favourite player, even look at the profile picture , even as things go bad as a Newcastle fan he still provides the light and the spark
Saint maximan is a god
We should've signed the Saint what a friggin legend!
Saint-maximin is the silikiest baller atm!

Absolute boss game Ben 👏🏻
ASM is slower than Steve Bruce... (Class player for us, gives us a lot of hope)
Saint Maximin is a great dribbler. Needs to work on his finishing mate I swear he'll be world class if he does. Also would love to win the match worn jersey geez proper legend you are great content keep it up 👍
ASM is a friggin legend
He will not be at Newcastle for long. I can see him at Liverpool all day what a plaaaayyyeerrrr 😂
On with the headband!! Allan Saint Maximin!!
The best part about ASM for me is the fact that he has embraced the Newcastle culture. He gets what it means to play for the shirt. Can’t ask for more than that from a foreign player. What a baller!
Alan Saint Maximum, sure he’s good but couldn’t get past foster could he
ASM got done dirty on fifa this year
St maximin is lethal, joy to watch
Simple. Baller.
from an Aussie newcastle supporter - ASM is the goat
Saint Maximin has to be the best technical dribbler in the league. So under rated because he plays in such a tough league. Wouldn't look out of place in the current PSG forward line.
Why is there no go pro in goal ?
awwwwww big bazzlar get well soon
ASM is going to be a Newcastle legend. Mark my words
I swear ASM’s headband gives him powers, the guys a joke! Might wear one to bed see if it makes a difference….
Saint Maximin is a serious baller mate. I have genuine fear when he touches the ball wether it is against my club or on fifa😂
ASM is the best player outside the ‘top 6’
Baller
ASM is insane , 100% deserves a move to a top 6 club.
ASM serious baller, bit like me
Saint Maximin is a baller, got me a goal on fpl gladly 🙌🏻
Saint-Maximin - Probably the best dribbler in the premier league.
He lights up the prem like no one other could. If he played for a top 6 team for sure one of the best players in the prem
Saint maximin is one of my favourite players so hard to play against with how skillful he is
Ben ur a Legend for these vlogs 🙌
Saint maximin is unreal, probably the best or one of the top best in the prem when it comes to skillful players, would love to see him in a Liverpool shirt
Saint Maximin is a baller! Needs a big move.
ASM, always awesome to use on FIFA
Saint maximin is insane. The way he attacks from his own half and drives the ball to create chances is amazing
Allan saint maxim is one of those players you hate coming up against but you’ll love having on your team. He also deserves to be playing at one of the big 6 teams in my opinion
ASM is just a joy to watch isnt he
Rob Elliot and ASM both newcastle legends 🔥🔥
🇳🇬
Saint maximin is a whopping plur
"Gucci" is one of a kind, the swag he plays with and just the way he takes anyone on with ease is a pleasure for the eyes
Asm is a baller 🔥 hope I win the shirt as I'm a NUFC fan
unbelievable player
My grandad past away during a Newcastle vs Manutd game in 1995, so Newcastle will always be in my heart. ASM is like the flash with his speed and acceleration.
Fozzy!! Absolute ledge would love to have the shirt ❤️❤️ PL worn shirt would be a dream !
What a baller he is
Asm is a baller
He’s a great talent excited to see him play in the future great vid as always
As a newcastle fan, the most frustrating game ive ever watched.
You can’t hate Ben Foster
ASM gives me Ginola vibes, been a while Newcastle had a player with mad flair
What a baller Saint-Maximin, can't wait to watch Watford and Ben grow throughout this season, good result against Newcastle. Keep up the good work Ben you frigginn legend.
Maxi is a unbelievable player. Always exciting only thing I can criticise him on is his end product. Has real potential. You had a quality game mate even got hands to that Sean longstaff wonderstrike. I was in the away end and ended up 7 rows down from where I was sat. Fucking carnage.
Saint maximem hes wairing gucci so we're gucci
Allan Saint maximin could nutmeg a mermaid
No idea where we would be without saint-maximin

Saint Maximin is a class footballer but was no match for the mighty ben foster. Very enjoyable game with heroic saves that keep my hands sweaty till the end. Loved it!
ASM is a baller! The streets will never forget that man, too good for Newcastle imo.
I’m saint maximin’s biggest fan the mans dribbling is ridiculous he’s a very underrated player in the prem and he’s only gonna get better! French magician 🇫🇷 ⭐️

Serious player! What a shirt btw
ASM is a complete baller, whenever my team faces him and he gets the ball I instantly get scared by the damage he could do
He’s a real life wizard
Saint could’ve been at the double if it wasn’t for the cycling GK. How do you even deal with the skill on that player
Total baller 🙌🏽
Saint maxim is like watching Neymar in premier league football. Absolute baller.
ASM is beautiful
I’m a Newcastle fan who obviously lives with a lot of heartache! Saint Maximin is the best player we have had in recent years, absolutely the best thing to happen us in a long time! 🙌🏼
Saint Max is one of the most under rated players in all of England. No way does he deserve a bigger club, I just pray he stays at NUFC forever, unbelievable baller. Don't know how much that shirt would mean to me
Saint is such a baller the skills are so maddd
Saint Maximin taking his opportunity as talisman by the horns! Pay day coming!

Yes Ben I love ASM what a little dancer
I’m a big Newcastle fan and absolutely love ASM, such a baller but no surprise he couldn’t get past the amazing cycling GK 😉
ASM is just too good (better than Neymar)
ASM, the king of the Geordies 👑
LOVE ASM. He’ll be in the UCL in no time!
ASM is a BALLER. Unreal player. He has got the potential to go far in his career. Cracking guy.
Saint Maximan is one of those players you love to have on your team
As a Wolves fan I dream of seeing ASM and Adama in the same team, carnage... Great video as always!
MOTM has to go to bazzlar! Cracking performance on his return
Gucci man
The GOAT
St Maximin is St Maximout of my fantasy football team
I’ve been a Newcastle fan my entire life and Allan st maximin has to be my favourite player of recent times. Only ever owned one Newcastle shirt before. Ngl I started to slightly lose interest in football a few years back but he reminded me of the reason why I fell in love with football in the first place, from the pace, skill, flair and strength of the lad. Every time I watch us play I feel such a buzz and excitement because of him. Would love to win the shirt, all the best Ben
ASM, baller, shot caller
Allan is such a great playmaker and reminds me of neymar with the quality of his skills amnd sometimes arrigance
saint maximin is my favourite player and has been since his time in france winning a signed shirt from him would make my year🙏
Saint-Maximin is actually unbelievable but we controlled him and was heartbroken when kings goal was given offside. Onto Leeds!
Saint maxim is a joke of a player weaving in and out of players like a sewing machine
He makes me remember why i love football!
As a Newcastle fan, asm is like gold dust
ASM is a mad lad on the pitch and fifa 😂
i would die for that top. my hero
ACM is unreal tbh.
ASM is one of the most under rated players in the premier league
It has to be the headband 👀
ASM, amazing player. Love from Bhutan Ben. 🇧🇹
St maximan is a baller I’d love his shirt Ben mate
Saint-maximin is a non injury prone dembele and it’s beautiful
What a player. Both of you, would love the shirt!
ASM legend and you need to get him in your FPL team, 6.8m and 4th highest forward.  When ASM first started playing in PL he was wearing a Gucci headband what a baller lol!!
I’m a Newcastle fan !! ASM is our best player by a mile. He’s in my FPL team. He turns a games on around single handed
I love your vids and I think Allan saint maximin is an absolute joke he’s my favourite player in the prem mate would love the shirt 👏👏
ASM: Flair personified
Every time Saint-Maximin plays, he lights a spark in the prem. Absolute baller
Been watching the Vlogs for ages mate, and ASM is Mr Twinkle toes. Baller is an understatement.

He’s the sexiest man of all time as a nufc fan I love him with all of my heart
ASM is such a speed demon, down the wing cutting in with all of his flair, top class player
being an arsenal fan with family in Newcastle, a ramsdale AND ASM feature cannot be complained at. As for Allan, what a baller. Hugely entertaining player (how it should be) and a diamond in the rough for Newcastle fans for a number of years now. Couldn’t score against you though Ben could he eh?🤣
What’s Rob Elliot’s opinion on the Irish team at the moment?

He’s as fast as fruit ninja rapidddddd
Maximin is just a beast
I’m a 28 year old Newcastle fan and honestly ASM is the most naturally gifted player I have seen play for us. He could play for any team in the world and have an impact. It’s inevitable but it will be a sad day when he eventually goes onto bigger and better things! Also keep up the good work Ben, class act!

Wishing a good recovery to Bazzler, what an absolute mad lad 💪
Saint-Maximin is such an underrated player he’ll definitely go down as one of those players “the streets won’t forget” but as a Newcastle fan he’s honestly amazing and deserves a move to a bigger team soon. Would love to win this shirt as I’ve been a Newcastle fan for my whole life. Keep up good work Ben

Saint is the 🐐🤩
ASM done a YouTube video with Street Panna not long after lockdown. He took time out to create a video and what an amazing humble guy he was. I’d recommend everyone watch it. They perform skills and have fun challenges. Without a doubt Newcastle’s top player. Every time he gets the ball you expect something to happen. So quick and agile, a defenders worst nightmare and I think he could play for a top top club
U probably won't see this but I like saint-maximan so could I get the jersey😅
ASM is so good, amazing to keep him quiet, well done watford. Please could i have the shirt?

Saint  maximin is a beast
Use go pro
ASM deserves to play at a top 6 club, he’s a fire starter on the pitch
Saint maximin is one of those players that you turn on the game just to see him play - unbelievable baller. Would be shocked if he didn’t get a big move within 2 years.

I do enjoy seeing the "behind the scenes" and i have to say the production of the vlog is great (do i feel Casey Neistat influences in it?). Keep it up and well played on saturday. You were definitly in the running for a man of the match vote. Show me the love!!!! Oh.... and the shirt would be an added bonus!
Allan saint-maximin loves violating people, like whenever he’s on the ball don’t matter who you are you’re getting sent by the mailman

Where’s the GoPro in goals gone😭😭
Go on maxi lad
That man can pull out the most unexpected goal you’ll see
Allan's absolute mustard, he also happens to be my dad
Saint-Maximin is one of our greatest players in recent times. We don't play great football and most of the time it is hard to watch, but this guy is our hope. He will make something happen out of nothing. We as fans, adore this lad!! He is everything to this club. The thing I love most about ASM, is the passion he shows every time he steps out onto the pitch. He gets what it means to play for this club. He understands what it means to wear the famous black and white stripes. We would be down without him.
Allan Saint maximum is different gravy better than pele
Saint Maximin, what a player! seems to do it all alone every single week, love it
ASM is our only hope to staying up this season, simple as! What a baller he is.

I don’t watch much of Newcastle but I know my football….Saint maxim is class makes Newcastle a much better team, quick sharp and tenacious…..absolute fantastic goalkeeper
ASM what a baller, going be up there with the best if he keeps performing at that standard. Maybe he can be the one who can make Newcastle as big as they were.

ASM is a player you could watch all day what a baller

Keep it up, Ben! Love the content.
What a baller, Saint Maximin 🤩
Yes the boys up the pie face up the argyle what a baller
Saint maximin is legend. Love to see him play. What a guy.
Saint max is one of my favourite players to watch, gets you on the edge of your seat everytime. Baller!
Would love his shirt
I think He is the fast verison of hatem ben arfa .
Saint maximin he is a baller it's like defender's are so scared he curves it in the top corner he is just top class
saint max best feet in the premier league
So many legends in one vlog. Get well soon big busler!!
saint maximan is a 🐐
His dribbling is amazing
Asm what a baller
If there is one player your looking forward to see on the weekend it has to be ASM. He’s such a baller
Allan Saint Maximum is one of my favourite opposition players to watch. Really think he should be at a better team!!
Pick me for that saint shirt😈
Gucci not 5 star skiller mans a 6 star
As a Sunderland fan i can’t lie he is absolutely amazing it is a struggle for the defenders to stop him and not many teams can get a player like that
Another banger Ben!!! Are you not allowed the gopro in the goal?  As Newcastle fan it's always entertaining watching ASM, lucky to keep hold of him transfer window just gone, possibly the best player to wear the shirt in the last 10 years, absolute baller.  Keep up the work Ben.
🔥🔥 Baller
St maximin is a baller mate, needs a top 6 move next
Love Saint-Maximin defo one of my favourite players. Loving the vlogs aswell keep it up.
He’s a serious baller
Allan saint maximin is I feel going to one of the talents of the season this season, I feel he will flourish like he is at the moment and will keep growing, he is the best player I’ve seen play for newcastle since I’ve been supporting them, the best I’ve seen since Ben arfa (they both have similar qualities) but I love this guy and would love to have him at the club forever ❤️
omg ben please let me have the shirt
Saint-Maximin is actually such an baller would not be surprised to see him playing for one of the big six or top European teams
fozzie bagging bonus points of FPL for making save after save, ALLAN SAINT MAX
Well i love him in fifa so would be great to win his shirt! Much support out of the Netherlands
Saint Maximin is a rapid beast with the skill to trick himself past any defence in the world 👊
Saint Maximin is easily one of the prems best players outside of the "big 6"  So lucky to have him at Newcastle
My brothers favourite player, would love to give him this shirt!
One word for ASM, Electric
legend
St Max is the best Newcastle player for years, a sheer joy to watch and gives me the Hatem Ben Arfa vibes! Class vlog as always.
Saint-maximin, decent, but think we made the right choice in choosing sarr, I’ll still take his shirt though 👌🏻
Really like Saint-Maximins dribling and pace. Special Newcastle player.
Love the love and respect you show all the support staff cause they are the heartbeat of a club
Ayy just give me the shirt at this point
From a Newcastle fan myself, seeing ASM on the pitch is a saving grace. Without him and Wilson in the team I dread to think where the club would be! The last player who had a reception like this I reckon was Hatem Ben Arfa. Geordies love players who give 100% everyday game and he is always doing that for our club. He loves the club, he loves the fans and we love him!
Gucci Beast!
ASM would nutmeg a snake 🐍
You’re the 🐐
Saint-maximin is class
Legend
Allan saint maximin is such a talent, with really good teqniue and speed, the sky is the limit for him!

Yes Fozzy! Absolute legend! ASM for me is one of the most dangerous players in the league when he drives, top player. Come on the boys
Honestly, I have no idea how Newcastle has managed to keep hold of Saint-Maximin for as long as they have. Should 110% be playing Champions League football!
If you don’t have Ben in your fpl team, do you even know football mate. Cs against Leeds Ben cmon you beautyyyyy
ASM is not newcastle level how they hand onto him i’ll never know he’s going to the top 🔝
ASM BEST WINGER IN THE PREM MARK MY WORDS
He's so good deserves a bigger club no offence to Newcastle
Saint-maximin is an absolute baller. Got great skill and fantastic with the ball at his feet never know what the guy is about to do when he’s in attack. Sadly tho he’s not quite a Watford player 🔵⚪️⚫️🟡

Saint Maximin is such a baller, crazy pace and amazing skills, deserves a big move!
Can't wait till ASM moves to a bigger club and gets the freedom on the wing that he'll feed off.  Combination of his dribbling and speed makes him an absolute baller and a defender's nightmare!

As a Newcastle fan, it’s hard to describe the love we have for that man. What a player, what a headband, the great entertainer! Keep up the class content Benny!
ASM + The Cycling GK = GOATS
ASM is the literal definition of an Entertainer for all of us Newcastle fans, the skill and flare he has is certainly up there with the best in the Premier League. For us fans, he can certainly be a breathe of fresh air that takes our minds away from the damaged relationships between the fans and the ownership/directors at the club.
ASM is the is the most entertaining player ever and my favorite player on fifa🐐
ASM is everything to a club like newcastle and its great that i can support a club that has that entertainment now we have someone to rave about!

Love you Fozzy. Saint maximan is one of the most exciting footballers in the prem. incredible to watch 🔥
Love the video Ben!! So happy to watch you on the pitch. Saint maximin what a player. He is deadly on the ball and definitely deserves 99+ pace on fifa to out run Steve Bruce 😂 keep up the great content❤
Saint Maximin is one off the best and most energetic players in the whole league. Newcastle did such a bargain when they bought him. If he has the ball it will become dangerous from the first touch.
Just checked out King Ekong's channel. Banger content indeed.
Saint-Maximin the 🐐
Beast what a player works so hard on that pitch and outclasses many defenders
St maximan is mad I don’t know how he does it and id love to give the shirt to my cousin cos he’s a Newcastle fan

Allan saint max is just a baller really 6 star skiller
Toon fan here, well played, you kept Watford in it the whole game!   Its a very sad time to be a Newcastle fan but ASM is literally the only bit of hope we have, he's so exciting to watch! Whoever gets his shirt look after it!
One of the best videos. Like a bunch of kids, playing footie and swapping swapsies like you're 10. Saint Maximin, needs to pass a bit more, always look for the better option, like Adel Taraabt.
Absolute sauce 🤝 ASM / Sarr
Saint-Maximin honestly the main reason im still watching Newcastle matches. breathes life into the team absolute belter of a player. Trophies in his future either with or without us(Newcastle) lad can go to the very top
Would love an ASM shirt mate, so talented on the ball that man! You’re a hero vlogger, love the pie feature too ;), up the Fozzie 🤝
Allan is a baller the silky skill 👌
Saint-Maximin is the newcastle offence
Genuinely your videos and your personality. Seem like you would be great to hang out with over a pint or 3. Legend 🙌
Personaly, i think Saint-Maximin is top 5 skillers in the world. Very loyal and a class player for Newcastl.
Allan saint maximin is a decent player nothing on isma tho
Class player top class for Newcastle class looking kit also
He’s a player you show your mates who don’t watch football to convince them to start watching👌 Amazing to watch, such a baller!
Would love to win jersey! My brother is a die hard Newcastle fan. He has never been to a game.
Saint-maximin is the most entertaining player in the prem.
Saint maximin is a king 🤴
ASM is probably the best winger outside the big 6, deserves a move to one of the teams. crazy tek one of the best itl
Big up fonz🥰
Allan is an electric guy
i know the prem has its own rules,  but the content doesnt give the same punch as the cam in goal.. its good nontheless
Gucci is a mad man the talent on him is insane
Absolute class vid as usual, will there be a go pro in goal anymore?
saint maximim is unplayable at his best!!
ASM best dribler in the Prem
Would love the shirt all the way from Australia mate! i think Saint maximum on his day has the potential to be the most wicked tricky winger in the league. The power is all the gucci band
Gucciman highly underrated and ben keep as Watford no.1 What a performance!!
ASM is the best dribbler in the world
ASM has got serious tek and serious drip. Gucci man himself 🤘
ASM is the reincarnation of Ben arfa but quicker and stronger. He’s got everything in his locker in terms of skills but also energy and passion. However he will never score against the mighty cycling gk
Best YouTuber alive 🔥🔥🔥
SAINT-MAXIMIN the saviour of my fantasy team.

Have to give props to your editor. Great content!

ASM is a BALLER 👑
What don’t I think of Saint Maximin. He’s our talisman and it will truly be the heartbreaking final straw when we inevitably lose him. For a team like Newcastle to have a maverick like him is just mind blowing tbh. Imagine that man in a team that is properly managed.

Class.
does the prem not allow gopro in the goal?
St maximin is genuinely the most entertaining player to watch (other than the cycling gk!) in the premier league
Very hit and miss when he's on one he can rip anyone apart

Delighted to see you copped ASM's shirt Ben. It hasn't been easy being a Newcastle fan the past while, but players like him make it all worthwhile. We love our unpredictable mavericks that light up a football pitch. Ginola, Asprilla, Robert, Ben Arfa to name a few   Allan is right up there and we are so lucky to have him. Le Roi de La France
Balr

I’ve never actually entered for a shirt before because I always feel like it should go to a fan of the team who that player plays for but I’d love that shirt. The guy is one of the best players we’ve had in years and is so exciting. Actually was at the game in the away end and managed to see you pull of some cracking saves in the flesh so would be great if you could repay the favour for stopping us from winning😂
ASM BALLER👀👀⚡️⚡️⚡️
Saint maximin is one of the most entertaining players in the prem love watching him play
ASM, what a baller! Carrying newcastle's attack on his back and gets everyone excited every time he gets on the ball. Great Vid as always, can't wait for the Leeds away days!

I've benn a Newcastle fan all me life and it would mean the world if I got the shirt also great video your classsss
I'm from Newcastle and I absolutely adore Maxi, he's one of the best players we have ever seen at Newcastle for a long long time and gives us a lot of hope. I'd love his shirt as I haven't been able to get one yet. I have Hatem Ben Arfa's match worn boots in a case on a shelf in my office and that shirt framed would look KILLER above them!  Much love Ben, love watching your videos and can't wait to see more from you!

ASM is a proper baller, one of the few players of his kind at the minute, plays with so much creativity and freedom. the game misses more players like him to add a little bit of spice and flare
Love ur channel, brilliant concept of showing behind the scenes of a Premier League player.
Saint-Maximin is a friggin beast! there's none like him
I think ASM is an absolute Legend on the pitch and the twitter king 👑 😂 I just hope injuries won’t stop him from entertaining us like previous seasons

Saint maximin is such a baller one of the most underrated players in the league and one of the most skillful.
ASM plays like he’s ice skating swear he glides across the pitch, what a bloke
Maximan is class
I reckon ASM gets a top move in the next season or two. I think he definitely suits Liverpool’s style of play and could be a welcome replacement for Sadio Mane very soon!

fozzy is the goat
I love the 5* skills and the gucci headband from ASM
Saint-max is a major baller
Love it
Alan Saint Maxamin = FRIGGIN LEGEND

Asm is a magician
Is it only me, of does Ben Foster just light up your day 😁
ASM is a tank. We had the chance to sign him at the same time as Newcastle but couldn't offer him the wages (Burnley fan) Everytime he gets the ball you just think somethings gonna happen, and it usually does!
Saint-maximin on the wing 🔥
Saint max is such a baller but of course Ben foster keeps the ball out like the legend he is 👍
I refuse to remove Saint-Maximan from my fantasy team even though everyone tells me to.
He’s just a monster on the ball!
ASM is a baller. One of the most underrated players in the world. For me he gets into any of the top teams in the prem.

Having Saint-Maximin in your team is like having a 12th man
We want goal cams
I love the guy he is so good
Saint maximin is a class showman and bloke 🔥🔥🔥
ASM is such a baller, shown by how much Newcastle play through him! They may struggle big time if he gets injured! Would love to see him in a top 5 team, with other attacking options, and see how could he could get!
Saint Maximin is Beast 🔥
Asm absolute joke highly underrated deffo going to the top big up the cycling gk from leamington also(whitnash)

ASM is one of most sauciest players I have ever seen
Saint maximum is a golden hope in newcastle. He is the only player on the team that when he plays you know hes gonna be entertaining and taking lads on...pure joy to watch just needs a better team
Saint Maximin is one of my favourite players I would love to win his jersey
He is the saint of the club and will never let anyone down. Big baller he is.
ASM is the french prince. Ice in the kids veins. superstar potential and unbeatable on his day! Would love to see him make a move to a top6 team but not as much potential as a young ben foster ;)
Allan is a baller that’s it
ASM is crazy crafty deserves a call up to France !
Maxim is a baller amazing quote !
St maximin french dynamite
Saint Max I reckon has the ability to play for the elitist of clubs with respect to Newcastle he seems to be a grade above their players, he's on a different wave length and thinks and moves before even his teammates. Could be a top player if he's disciplined and works hard.
Gucci man himself cheeeez
Love the work Ben , my go to channel every week!! Saint Maximum what a baller starting to see the best of him! My nephew is a Newcastle fan and would love this! Keep up the great work mate

Being a Newcastle fan Saint-Maximin can be frustrating at times but overall he gives us and the Premier League that flair and he’s brilliant to watch

ASM should've had three assists there! Class goalkeeping Ben
i don't know if i've missed something, but it seems that ben doesn't do go-pro in the goal anymore. if someone could let me know if there is a reason, would be appreciated.
ASM is, as Ben always says, a frikken legend!
ASM is an actual joke i swear, going right to the top that lad
Maxi is the goat

Wow
ASM is a beast
Asm is so entertaining player, i like him very much
Always loved saint Maximin even from his nice days. Saw somewhere that he’s got one of the highest IQs for a football player. Wish united signed him 🔴🔴.
He is a very entertaining player to watch!
Blokes a freak, ripped us apart a few weeks back and I’ve got a few mates who adore him
I'm in for the saint maximin shirt , I support Newcastle and have my whole life , he is my idol
ASM is one of the best dribblers in the league I think he even is ahead of traore for running at defenders at pace and completely bamboozling them with his silky skills!
ASM is a very skilful player who offers effort and makes the pitch his dancefloor
Asm-baller
ASM My Idol <3 Will be a balon dor contender in 5 years, would die for the shirt.
This and Troost-Ekong's content just makes my day!!!! 🔥
French Ronaldinho
Absolutely love saint-maximin myself, being a fan I can honestly say he is our best player and if i won it would be the first one that got framed ever from me, absolutely love the vlogs mate keep it up and good luck for the rest of the season 😁😊
Saint-maximin is one of the best players outside the top 6. Needs a move to a champions league club ASAP, he'd be electric on ucl nights 🤩
ASM has all the skill and talent in the world. Big future ahead of him.👏👏
saint maximin is literally one of my favourite players. I LOVE the man and would love his jersey 😍❤️
Saint-Maximin is so entertaining
Allan saint maximan , what a baller
Saint-Maximin is class, France produces some insane talent! Wishing Bazzlar a quick recovery as well, that injury must be a frustrating one. Loved the music and Ramsdale cameo during the vlog as well!
Life long Newcastle fan, we've had some cracking flair players down the years, but I think Saint-Maximin is the best of the lot! MAHOOOSIVE BALLER!
Max is a speedy boi
The Premier League needs more players like SAINT-MAXIMIN! He's so exciting to watch!
ASM would definitely be the scariest player to come up against as a full back, especially with how fast he is and some of the things he pulls out on the pitch are outrageous
Gucci!
Rob Elliot was a fantastic keeper for us lot, came in as third choice and played a few blinders when he did play. I'm sure if he hadn't of been injured as much he would of been our Number 1 in the championship. Top keeper! NUFC
Love it Cycling GK the 🐐 of YouTube,  As a Newcastle fan, ASM is my 👑, the geordie messi, the heart of the city. If you follow him you’ll know he does so much for the city and is a top father to his kids, a real family man. I love him and would love his top  Keep up the great content xx
Allan saint maximin is scarily good he just carries Newcastle so much
Saint-Maximin might only be the only one who turnes me on if I’m watching him play ahahah
Saint maximin has to be the most underrated player I’ve ever seen,very good for the team and is a goalkeepers nightmare would be a pleasure to have his shirt.

ALAN SAINT MAXIMIN Is such a baller, such an underrated player but what a performance so unlucky with the VAR
Saint Maximin is one of them players who when he gets the ball all you hear is the clapping of seats smashing up, used to have it down at Spurs with Bale, same vibes

ASM-the french Neymar...
ASM is always a player I fear us playing, so talented with the ball at his feet and a game changer.

Watched every episode Ben and first time I have entered for a shirt, as a Newcastle fan ASM is the man and I know the perfect place for that shirt, it will be raffled for the Newcastle food bank 👍
ASM is class, such an asset to Newcastle! Top vid mate
Allan Saint maximan is definitely in the top 3 most skillfull players in the prem obviously Ben Foster has to be 1st coz of them crazy acrobatic saves.
Such a silky player, proved doubters wrong!
What a baller Asm is 🥶
ASM makes it look so easy to beat someone in a 1v1. Must be horrible to play against.
Saint-Maximum’s skills and all around game is incredible, but not ass hosted as you. 🐐
The guy is such an underrated baller the guy is amazing to watch full of entertainment and he’s wearing Gucci so we’re Gucci
Asm is a baller insane player
Saint maximin is the French version of Adama traore lol
Newcastle always get these players every few years, the likes of Ben arfa, cisse etc they’re just luxury players it’s like they take every ball in their stride. I think when it comes down to it tho bazzlar starts on the wing for me personally (bad back or not)
Saint is a really good dribbler and knows how to keep the ball well whilst making it entertaining but I think he could pass more🤣
What a legend sent maximin if you see him played you need to take 4 steps back  But ben always do a lovely blog
Saint is one of the most underrated players in the league especially this season he’s been electric ⚡️ 💪🏼
ASM With a better team around him would be scary, easily newcastles best player, Imagine when he has a more consistant end product!!!!

Saint Maximin an absolute baller who I would love at Leicester. He is fast, has a great vision and is a beast of a player. Anyway, loving your vids Ben and good luck to Watford and yourself for that rest of the season. Also will the go pro be back in goal anytime soon?
One of if not the best winger in the league not in the top 6, I've got a mate who's a Geordie and he always says Allans THE player of the team which he genuinely loves.
Da big saint maximin
Saint-Maximin is the modern jj okocha

OMG. He’s an absolute god. I would..do..anything..for that shirt. PICK ME
ASM BALLER! Great video Ben 😉
ASM IS SUCH A SILKY BALLER ITS INSANE
Just missing out on NUFCs 'Entertainers' era (born 92) - ASM gives me the sense of feeling it must have been like for the toon fans at that time.  He is the King of Twitter aswell... although he knows he could never be King of YouTube so he respectfully keeps away from it... what a LEGEND!!
Saint maximan=GOAT
Great video! I want gucci max's shirt!
saint max over messi and ronaldo
Hi Ben, I’m a massive Newcastle fan living in Devon so rarely get to go to games unfortunately, especially with Covid. ASM is my favourite Newcastle player by a long shot as he gets all the fans up from the seats (or the sofa). Due to this I would love the shirt. I hope the fact that I used to cheer you on at Tiverton Town sways the decision in my favour. All the best, Mark.
Had the pleasure of watching ASM at home games a few times this year, he's been the only reason Newcastle have been worth watching as a fan
Saint-Maximin is geordie a hero, absolutely love the man. He gives us hope which we havent had a lot of lately
Saint-Maximin is one of the most exciting players i’ve ever seen as a Newcastle fan
Saint Maximin is an absolute baller skills, speed, creativity. What a beast
Ben mate , tell you what if I had to defend against saint maximin, I just wouldn’t defend 🤷‍♂️
ASM is the the next Ben arfra
Massive Newcastle fan- and ben Foster fan too! Would love the shirt to frame in my new office!
ASM is the most skilful player in the league
ASM is the Gucci Man
I would like to win the ASM shirt because im a big fan of saint maximin from Holland!
Mate max is an engine
ASM is a proper baller even better that he loves the toon!!
Saint-maximin has got the skills to pay the bills what a player !
Legend, hope watford stay up you played class
ASM is rapidooo absolute magic 🪄
ASM what a baller, the french Ronaldinho.
Saint Maximin hes on the wing. Cracking Pluurrr
Howay Ben, you know it and I know it, ASM is an absolutely top notch player and as a Newcastle fan I believe he's too good for us as he just constantly shreds up defences like there's no tomorrow.
Saw Aaron in the title and thought it’s Danny Aaron’s
Imagine ASM in a 5 a-side team...
Allan is so good, super skillful. But not as good as Sarr
Allan Saint-Maximin is a class player and can run ring around many of the defences in the league when he wants to and ngl, would be surprised if he doesnt get a move away to a better club if Newcastle go down as he could easily fit into most teams.
What a legend, a Saint-Maximin kit would join my collection greatly 😉😂
ASM has some of the quickest feet on world football, absolute baller

Hi Ben love the content I would love to have the saint maximin shirt please and thank you hope you have a lovely day keep it up champ

Bit annoyed you played so well against us and kept us to 1 goal but a lot of respect for giving out the ASM top - he’s an absolute gem of a human does so much for the community in Newcastle and an absolute weapon when he’s on the ball! Hopefully you let in a few more when you come up to St James’!

Saint-Maximim, serious baller. Get the feeling you never know what he’s going to do next. But… still no Antonio in the team Fozzy 😱
Alan saint maximin could easily be one of the best players in the league if he has like a 11 - 13 game good run and gets a big move to a Liverpool who could do with winger and maybe give mane a run for his money
ASM is a proper baller. Newcastle and the rest of the Prem love himmmm 🔥🔥

Allan Saint-Maximin is honestly one of the most underrated players in World football, absolute baller who could be playing Champions League if he wanted to, I predict he will at some point, think he deserves a France Call-Up the way he's been playing.

As a big Newcastle fan this would be unreal to have, St maximin is one of those players that get you on the end of your seat and just cannot predict what he’s going to do next. We will be lucky to keep a hold of him. Absolute player
I remember saint-maximin playing for hannover back in the days at the age of 18-19 in the german bundesliga. This guy is just insane, pure speed compared with an unique skillset. Keep it up ben, the quality of the videos is unreal.

I think that saint max is really good in attack but the way that Ben kept Watford in this game he done so well to hold off saint max when it was a bad back pass but the amount of amazing saves he made earned them that point top class goalkeeper!

I think Saint- Maximin is up there with the best players outside of the top 6. I like how he plays football like it’s a street match,  skills left right and centre
Saint maximin the most silky player around
He is such a boiler man plus he has to deal with racism
Saint-Maximin has to be one of the most creative dribblers i've ever seen.
Produces magic with 6 star skill moves 🔥
ABSOLUTE BALLER
As a Newcastle fan he's the only hope we have at the club right now, Fozzy if you're reading this please don't give his shirt to a none NUFC fan, it'll be adored of you give it to a toon fan 100%   love the content bro, missing the go-pro in the goal though

Saint Maximin is honestly too good for us (Sadly I'm a newcastle fan) and unfortunately we cannot utilise him to the best of his ability, whether that be down to poor management or the supporting players. He could do very well in top 8 club at the very least
watching saint-maximin makes me wanna buy gucci
c'mon ben💪🏼
Saint maximin is the 2nd best player in the world, just behind the cycling gk 🐐.
Amazing video, why don’t you use the go pro anymore ?

Saint-Maximin is one of those players that play football for the joy and emotion it brings. He always plays with a smile on his face and I’m convinced that man could dribble his way out of a tornado. What a great player⚡️
I think Saint Maximan is little star and when he has the ball you will see magic.
Maximam is a baller
He should’ve had an assist luckily longstaff couldn’t finish

Allan Saint-Maximin skill set mixed up with incredible pace makes him one of the best wings in the league definitely, he is of huge importance to Newcastle United, I don't think they can pick up many points without him. Can't wait to use him in fifa 22.

I'm a Newcastle Fan and I would love that Saint Maximin shirt (if u haven't already gave it away) . His ability is the best I've ever seen. He just gets you on the edge of your seat. He's crazy good 😍😍
Saint-Maximin is fantastic, on and off the ball. Gonna be a real threat for the present and future! Great video as always 👍
As a Newcastle fan all I can say is that man allan saint-maximin is the one and only
Hi Ben, u probs won’t see this. I’m a Newcastle fan and was in the away end, giving u stick throughout of course 😂. Maxi is Newcastle only thing that brings us toon fans hope anymore. Our club is in such turmoil and it’s the hardest time to support our beautiful club. Keep up the class vids Ben lad, great game to watch thank you ⚫️⚪️
ASM is by far the best Newcastle player.
Allan saint-maximin is the most exiting Newcastle player in the last 10 years so glad to have him
toon toon maxis black and white army
Saint-Maximin is an insane baller, would love to have him at City tbf
ASM, to be frank is a baller player but for him he needs players who can support him, he still has a long way to go, can be much much better, if he moves to a different team and can get support he would kill it
Ben Foster the best youtuber
Saint Maximin is class mate!
Ams is a baller, and i like his headband. Gucci
These videos ben are class, love the content mate. ALLAN SAINT-MAXIMAN is a big baller, his fast feet and skills make him so hard to play against as a defender Quality!!!

Great blog👍
I think saint-maximin is just amazing and decent player.
maximan the french pires
Love the videos Ben as always and love the podcasts, Saint-Maximin is a proper old school player with the new school attitude, the man never has a bad game whenever he plays and can see a big team come in at some point for him maybe a Spurs or city he could work with, would love the shirt as I’m a huge fan of him and of yourself but whoever gets it is a lucky bugger, great video as always Ben and hoping to see more of you in the squad this season :)
Maximin has also made it to a sidemen vdo
Saint maximin is one of the silkiest ballers in the prem
unless he gets a ton of injuries, i guarantee  saint maximin will be the player for newcastle over the next decade
As a newcastle fan it’s ridiculous how good he is genuinely the thing what gives newcastle fans hope you stand up when he gets the ball as u know he can run with it score assist and a french call up should be on his way
Can't not like Bazzlar or Pieface, must subscribe to KING EKONG and unreal from Ben Foster to keep uploading and Saint Maximin is an exquisite footballer. 'COME ON THE BOYS'
Maximin honestly best winger in the league outside if the top 6. Apart from Sarr of course 😂😉

i think he’s a tecky ballet french beast ❤️
Maximin is just incredible with his fast dribbles and his pace!! So underrated
Alan saint gucci the machine. Frightening
Maxi is class and at the moment too good for Newcastle. I saw him against Leeds and he was utterly amazing. Pretty sure he could quite easily feature in one of the "big 6" clubs on a regular basis. From a long suffering Newcastle fan. Also would love the shirt in my collection. Also Ben your Vlogs are amazing and its awesome to see behind the scenes of a Premiership Club.
SAINT MAXIMIN IS THE BEST PLAYER EVER I LOVE HIM SO MUCH PLS CAN I HAVE HIS SHIRT
ASM one of the most entertaining players in the prem, is to Newcastle like grealish was to villa
ASM for me just feels like Messi in Traore body
Could saint maximin do it on a cold wet night in Stoke though?
ASM Legend!!
One of the most exciting players to watch in the Premier League, proper baller
Saint-Maximin: Underrated, class, coming to arsenal
ASM- good dribbler , great pace Newcastle definitely need him to stay in the premier league that’s i gonna say

Saint Maximin On the Wing
ASM is the 🐐
Saint maximin is one of my favourite players. His flair is just super cool
Saint maximin one of the most underated players in the league always gets the crowd excited when he’s on the ball

Saint maximin is a beast, Craig Cathcart would be the man to keep him quiet though 😉 GAWA
Honestly, Right … Maximan is an absolute saint for Newcastle, guy is a fricking legend, joke of a player, cmon the boys!!!

I love the way Fozzy is promoting his fellow Team mates Channel just from the bottom of his heart such a great character keep up the great work 🖤
I’m a united fan was at old Trafford for the Newcastle game and honestly how much better Newcastle are when he’s in and around the ball is ridiculous maybe a Newcastle fan deserves the shirt but I definitely wouldn’t say no fozzy😂 , enjoying the fozcast as well mate keep up the good work

Absolute baller - most underrated player in the prem
Love the quality of content in these blogs… I recently got into triathlon so have found a love for the bike & always loved footy so it’s a great combo… the Fozcast is a belter too.  Saint-Maximin is always a threat, great pace and trickery and is improving his end product - could become a genuine world class attacker.
Unbelievable player for Newcastle. Love the content fozzy. Buzzing your back in the team.
Allan Saint-Maximan deserves to be playing for a top 6 side he is literally a baller and the guy produces week in week out. Flicks and Tricks he’s got it all

JARRED GILLETT
Saint maximin sheesh, young prodigy for sure, once he hits a big team and joins the main France team he could be one of the best wingers for sure
saint-maximin is good but not as good as youtube fc also if sidemend do a charity match (sidemen v youtube) you should defo go in goal for team youtube!
Saint maxim is insane, he’s phenomenal on the ball and electric, he’s so underrated because being that good in the premier league shows how good he is, playing that well in the best league in the world, cheers Ben hope you have a great week my guy🙏🏽💪🏽
Come on the boys 😤 Saint-Maximin is a beast, but the Cycling GK is a legend 😎 can’t get enough of these vlogs 👍🏻👍🏻
His natural ability is just ridiculous, same with his creativity and time on the ball. The way he runs with the ball with no fear too is exactly what you want to see from a player. As a Newcastle fan myself, it would be an honour to own his jersey!
I already liked and subscribed but what I think about Saint maximin great player but where I play in semi pro he’s just one of them you throw 2 footers at, can’t let him mock me infront of my girl and family 😂😂
Allan Saint-Maximin is elite winger will deffo get a chance at some top top prem team (nothing against the magpies).
As a Newcastle supporter maxi is our only hope at the moment.

Saint maximin is pure gold on Twitter too if you follow him !
The only word I can used to describe Saint-Maximin is Scary.  Such a scary footballer to see up against your team, he can do it all!
Saint-Maximin is the next Alan Shearer! He is ripping up the prem for Newcastle! His Skills are ELECTRIC! Greate performance from the hornets to get the draw but 3 points next time! Great video Ben!
Saint Maximin is one of my favourite non Chelsea players. He's full of personality and the king of Twitter
saint-maximin is just silly, bloke can dribble with his eyes shut and some of his skills are outrageous. Newcastle are lucky to have a player like him, top guy.
Allan saint-maximin! What can I say. He is a goat. I’m a Newcastle fan so might be biased but got to be top 5 wingers in the prem. Honestly we would definitely get relegated without him. He has skills for days as well and is entertaining for everyone.
Saint-Maximin is an absolute joke!
Asm is a baller
Asm is unbelievable id love to see him at my club and I’d love to see that shirt on my wall fozzy come on the boys
Genius maximin mind
Allan saint max is a baby sarr if you ask me, two very underrated wingers with so much pace and flair it’s unreal. These players make the premier league so competitive and entertaining to watch, I hate to say it Ben but he’d have you on toast 1v1😂
2 words..... gucci headband
Saint max is an absolute madman on the pitch  Makes defenders look like Jonathan woodgate on his Madrid debut
Cheers for giving us this content Ben. Would love that shirt, had Watford to win in my Uni's Last Man Standing Competition so gutted I'm out, shame King didn't cut his toenail the night before haha. Saint-Maximin is unreal, class job for not letting him score, credit to you Ben. Keep up the good work lads, Mon the Hornets.

Mate, Saint Maxi is the life and joy as a newcastle supporter, without him, I dont know what we would do
BALLER Ben Forster the 🐐
ASM is one of the most entertaining footballers out there
Alan is a great player, nearly as quality as the cycling gk 👊🙌
Saint-Maximin = best dribbler in pl in my opinion. But no match for the cycling GK😂
Saint-Maximin is one of the few players in the PL that makes every game he plays in entertaining by himself, he is class!
I think he is amazing, he is the man that always plays spectacular and even if he doesn't I still love to see him play and do his skills.
You don't need to be a Newcastle fan to enjoy watching ASM
ben your well good in my Watford career, cheers lad :)
ASM is class!🔥

ASM is the only reason to watch Newcastle at the moment, he gives the fans hope that we can become the club we used to be back in the day!
Allan Saint-Maximin is one of the most skilful players in the league! Would love him at Everton.
Saint maximin is a top class baller he's one of the top wingers and attacking players in the premier League in my opinion he's got pace, skills and creates chances for Newcastle like they are nothing.
Saint-Maximin is a beast mate. Once he gets on the ball, try stopping the baller. What a freakin legend
Saint-Maximin has to be the player you dread playing against the most. An absolute joke and a nightmare to defend against
ASM the legend especially in Fifa haha
St.Maximum baller ⚽️ 🔥
Saint-Maximin is easily the second best winger in the prem behind sarr

Hi Ben I’m a newcastle fan, I’ve always loved your work that you do for your fans, I’m a large admirer saint maximin and I love him as a newcastle fan, he is a fantastic young player who has a potential to be great. I’ve currently got covid so it’s hard doing things, watching the game this weekend against Watford I thought we did well in the first half but you were unbelievable in goal, getting Allans shirt would mean the world and  help me get through this tough year. Keep up the fantastic vlogs Ben 💪

Mr. Foster thank you for constantly entertaining me I'm always buzzing whenever I see your videos on my sub page up like most people. Thanks for getting me and the homies through the tuff times of covid thanks you absolute mad lad!!!!!!!!!!!
Saint-Maximin is honestly wasted at Newcastle. It's a shame because they're a great club in a bad place!

He's so good to watch! Always lights it up. Baller.
I was at the game. Came over from Ireland to see the cycling GK in action and that one on one in the first half with Saint Maximin was my highlight. So exciting and exactly what footballs about.
1 word     SKILLS
ASM is a Baller best winger outside the top 6
Saint maximin the french hench
ASM is a baller no doubt.. but we all know he has posters of the cycling GK on his walls at home
Saint-Maximin is my favourite player, the best Newcastle have had in years! When he’s on the ball you know something class is going to happen! Serious baller🔥🔥🔥 Keep up the good work, love your videos
I think saint maximin should be a better club no offense to newcastle where he has a world class coach to improve his game
Saint-Maximin is an absolute baller.  He is just an honour to watch. How have Newcastle kept so much of a baller. He is so skill full and absolutely electrifying. He is fantastic on the ball and will be a legend of Newcastle for years to come. My star man on fifa 22.   Thanks fozzie for all the blogs they light up my day. Seeing the insights of a footballer. So interesting and should have been brought to YouTube earlier. Keep it up.

ASM big baller, he treats football like fun and that’s what we like to see. This guy will be playing on champions league level in near future, just wait!
Saint-Maximin is a baller... simple
I think saint-maximin is great, plus number 10 is always a great shirt number.
Saint-Maximin should at least play in a Europa League team, alright Ben please can I have the shirt pls probably the only Mongolian fan here tbh.
Why was there no camera footage during the game?? is it because it is a premier league game? Miss that camera angle :(
ASM is amazing! quality player

Class absolutely class Allan saint maximin 🐐
saint maxamin is soo good his speed and quick feet is a madness
I love Allan Saint-Maximin. He is my inspiration I really hope I win this!!!
From a Newcastle fan, ASM is so refreshing to watch. He's got the ability to turn anything into half a chance. He's still a very raw talent and sometimes has questionable decision making or end product but he is the saving grace in an otherwise lack luster side
Brilliant video ben, love to see you back in the watford goal again!
Gucci headband is a baller
ASM doesn’t even need goals or assists to prove how good he is a baller 🔥
I watched Saint-Maximin against my local team, York City, not that long ago and he was AMAZING to watch! Every time he has the ball at his feet I had a smile on my face. He is such a baller. Anyway class video as always ben! Much love brother

Allan Saint-Maximim is a baller

Ben's FPL this week would have beeb awful feel for ya and Saint-Maximin is on for a blinder of a season
Saint-Maximin is so underrated, if he played for one of the top teams in the league he'd be called world class
What happen to GoPro in Goal bring it back
Saint-Maximin is the best dribbler in the Prem, absolutely unbelievable when he gets going
ASM is werldddd classs and I need that shirt I went to watch him in Nice when he was younger and wasn’t disappointed.
Saint maximin is a top quality player could easily play in the champions league for me so quick, very good feet and very powerful! Cycling GK = best channel on YouTube.

Die hard Newcastle fan, but Saint-max can’t line up with the cycling gk
Allan saint maximin is probably the SAUCIEST player in the prem, creates chances like its nothing and pulls the strings like a tampon thief.
Saint-Max is going to be in champions league next season hands down

Big fan keep up the good games
Saint-maximin is too good
Alan saint Maixmin is brilliant
Saint maximin absolute baller makes it even better I’m a toon fan
Saint-Maximam is a player who needs a bit of finishing a can be a next Neymar with physique. Need some big-6 to buy him.
ASM shouldnt be at Newcastle he deserves a better club.
I’m a gooner but honestly more than anything I’m a Ben Foster FC fan🙌🏼 Saint-Maxamin is also an absolute legend🤯
ASM is a joke. dribbling is top and his skills are out of this world. What a player!
Saint maximan is a baller
Baller

ASM is actually a beast, deserves to be at a UEL or UCL team easily
Saint maximan is a baller and I’d love that kit Ben pleaseee🤙
Saint-Maximin is a heavily underrated player in the prem, i used to see him play in OGC Nice and he was filthy. He is de key player in Newcastle. Best regards from Barcelona
Bazlar ❤️
Rumour has it that Declan Rice was diagnosed with vertigo after facing Alan Saint Maxim in league match.
Great stuff on the vlog! Keep up the great content! ASM is just unstoppable!
Saw the game from the Graham taylor stand, absolutely lightning fast you don’t even realise it when you watch it on TV, and super strong as well, quality player
Saint- Maximin big baller, but Saar will always be clear
Ben. Allan is literally my favourite player I've EVER seen play for Newcastle, and I've been following them for 13 years since I was 5.
Saint max, both and off the field is absolute World class. On the field his dribbling is insane and his rapid pace. Also who wears a Gucci headband whilst playing in the Premier League, absolute class. Off the field such a Nice guy joking around with other footballers and streamers What a champ
Saint-Maximin. Juggling between a baller and a saint on a day-to-day basis. Absolute legend
Saint maximal is a decent play and he is a player to watch out for. Also I’ve been watching ur YouTube Chanel since 100K subs
Saint- maximan is an absolute baller but the cycling GK is different gravy
That man is a 6 star skiller
ASM is a true bona fide baller
ramsdale needs to be a regular fozzy, love the guy
Allan Saint Gucci is the goat even tho newcastle might not be the greatest side them geordie fans deserve him ! What a player
Up the watford

Miss the Gopro in the goal, ASM is a funny lad on twitter 😂
Love these VLOGs and they are presented so brilliantly. well done mate!
He is rapid
Another fantastic vlog! Very entertaining, as usual. Love seeing behind the scenes. Tell Basler to be careful, I've struggled with sciatica for about 35 years. It never goes away, it is always lurking in the background waiting for that one wrong move. Saint-Maximin is the jewel in the Newcastle crown, they always look dangerous when he is playing.
What a man you are!! Top tier entertainment. Saint-Maximin is an absolute cheat code, any prem club would have him!
Good skills and always lively
Allen Saint Maximum is a proper baller. I went to the Newcastle v West Ham game and he was playing around with the West ham defence all afternoon. He is good enough to be a Man United player. X10 better than Sancho or Rashford
Loving the content still Ben Foster even without the go pro in the goal witch is a shame but like I said the content is still legendary.  Getting on to Allen Saint maximum well the guy is just truly unreal he's unbelievable Jeff!
Saint-Maxamin is different gravy absolutely amazing player
So good to see fozzy back in Goal, mans a legend!!!

Lucky he didn't try and chip you ;) Love the vlogs Fozzy!!
Ben is there not allowed any action recordings?? Whole reason your channel blew up was because of the match day action is that all stopped now??
"Come On The Boys" will never die, Ben Foster what a legendary keeper. That shirt from that baller would look amaizing in my room! Keep your good work Ben, ALL THE BEST!!!
Alan Saint-Maximum is an absolute pro He’s electric
2.5k likes to 2 dislikes 😂🤩 also Saint Max is a joke 🔥
I think saint-maximin is a baller to be fair. He's fast, got skills and he creates chances for his team. Class winger!
Saint maximin Not as good as Sarr....Although it would be great to see him and Sarr in our Line up..Cheeky Bid Mr.Pozzo....You know it makes sense ;-)
ASM have brought dribbling  to the next level, im a Newcastle fan  and its a dream if i can get his shirt.
ASM is a game changer. No other words for him. If anyone in the top 6 get him, he’d go to that next level and be almost unstoppable. Top match day as always! 🙌🏻

ASM is a diamond of a baller
Certified Baller🔟🇫🇷🪄
Didn’t show us eating his dinner cuz he definitely put ketchup on that steak 😅
ASM is an absolute joke, the pace and dribbling, the guy even has a song!
Been a massive Newcastle fan since birth, support who your dads supports, he’s said he thinks that ASM is the most exciting player we’ve had since Ginola/Aspilla. Would be amazing to win that top as it would just go to him to be framed on the wall. Keep up the amazing content Ben, been watching since I binged watched you in the winter lockdown, unreal job mate
Allan saint max is the absolute goat he has saved us so many times and his dribbling is next level
I genuinely think Saint Maximin may end up as another Wilfred Zaha, where he doesn't leave the smaller club for the bigger club and will not reach his full potential.
Saint-Maximin is a proper Jay Jay Ochoa throwback baller! Foot work is a joke, gotta be at a top 6 club soon! Fozzzy, you're a friggin' legend! 💪
Saint-Maximin is a composed geezer
Pls pls pls want to win the shirt!🙏🙏
Saint-Maximin is tecky. Reckon he'd make it into any team in the league
As a lifelong Newcastle fan, I think Saint-Maximin is our best player since Alan Shearer. I just wish the clubs ambition matched his ability. But yeah, I wouldn’t mind that top like mate 😂
ASM is class. Had him in my FPL for 2 weeks now and had returns both weeks, 1 goal, 1 assist. Would love the shirt too
I think that Saint Maximin is one of the best wingers in the league and he’s one of my favorite players. I would love to get his match worn kit hope you pick me. COME ON THE BOYS❤️
Big bazz is back🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾
Maxi is a goat, we’d be done if we lose him, carries the team with his electric style of play when Wilson’s injured, hopefully that shirt comes home to the north-east.

Saint maximin is great
Asm is a legend and one of the most if not the most skilled player in the prem Love the vids ben cheers
Saint maximin is a joke and a point is a great result! Who would have thought a 30yr old would enjoy these videos as much as I do... keep it up the Real GK

ASM is an absolute wizard. Tricky feat, lightning pace. Couldn't beat Fozzy though ;)
ASM, is a frigging BALLER 🤍🖤🤍
ASM is all honesty too good for our club. Head a shoulders above the rest. Unlucky on the Longstaff strike but I still celebrated 🤣
Saint-Maximin will be at a top 6 club within the next 3 years, coming from an nufc fan great vid been waiting for this one
Would love to see Saint-Maximin in a bigger club next season!
Saint Maximin is like the government - you don’t know what you’re going to get!

My best mate is a MASSIVE MASSIVE Newcastle fan and honestly Ben this would make his year if he got a match worn Allan Saint-Maximin shirt. I’m a United fan and I even I love Allan Saint-Maximin, the guy is a bloody joke of a player.
3 enevitables in life. 1. Death. 2. Taxes 3. Ben fosters apple crumble
ASM is the best dribbler in the league.
Asm the goat 🐐
Don’t think many people knew how close Arsenal and Watford grounds are together, yeah there pretty close….
If I was Saint Maximin I would join Watford FC to play with the best team in the UK COME ON THE BOYS ⚽️
Up the cycling gk🐐
Gucci (maximin) will be a Newcastle legend if he isn’t already. The guy is so funny and his ability’s on the pitch are insane with his pace. Hope I can get the jersey of one of my idols

Allan Saint-Maximan is easily good enough to be talismanic for a champions league team
Newcastle fan abs can say W/o maxi idk where we would be, he just brings that big of creativity that we otherwise don’t really have. Him and Willock are a joke

Saint maxim is a great player. Very underrated and arguably the best 1 on 1 dribbler in the prem
Saint maximin is a baller definitely deserves a top move
Allan Saint-Maximin is an absolute baller and will not be with us next season 😭 he is destined to win trophies and will be with a team in the top 8 soon - as much as it hurts to say that 😭

Baller and want that shirt omdays
Saint Max is an absolute legend! One of the top 3 dribblers in the league hands down
To put it simple I’m a Newcastle fan held a season ticket for 12 year and I’m a massive saint maximin fan absolute baller. Also a huge cycling GK fan. It would be absolutely class if I got that shirt. Both goats 🐐
Ben could make a video of him watching paint dry and it would still be entertaining 😂
I won’t believe that you actually give the shirts away until I win one 😂😂
I think saint maximin is a fairy , his feet are a joke
Why the GoPro can't be on the goal? Did premium league didn't allow it?
I love his dance moves 😂
ASM and Sarr are too good
“Isma you beauty!”
Love this channel
Maximan is a legend
Saint maximan is a fast man he like the flash
Nothing beats saint maxims footwork 😩

Maxi is enough to keep our club morale up what a guy!
Saint-maximin is actual baller🔥🔥
Saint-Maximin is by far our best player, he just needs to keep fit and if he goes next season I'll be wounded
Newcastle fan and this is the only one I’d like to get never bothered comment on the others to let others win the other shirts, but this would be unreal 🤞
Hey Ben, been a huge fan of you for awhile, your videos made quarantine so much better. Always made the day better when I got a notification that you uploaded a video. Saint Maximin is so agile, and he’s got such promise since he’s so young. Happy you got a point though, although my team is Milan, Watford is my team for PL! Good luck on the rest of the season Ben.
st maximin is a baller , linked to my team everton aswell so would love the shirt !
Saint Maximan Was so good his dribbling was electric but you done so good against your save when he was running to the goals and u stood your ground brilliant Ben 👏
Any chance I can have the shirt Ben plz
Saint Maximin is such a fast player
Saint maximin with the Gucci headband
Pick me Benny
We all know what Allan Saint-Maximin does on the pitch but what he does off the pitch for the Newcastle community will be remembered for a long time. He just gets it. A great footballer but an even greater man. We love you Allan
Saint maxi is just a 🐐
Saint-maximin had such a great last season. I really hope that he can help Newcastle this season to.
As a Newcastle fan I absolutely love st max. One of the players that you watch football for. In a club with not much excitement at the moment he’s so entertaining but already this season he’s become a better player as much as an entertainer
Apart from Callum Wilson saint maxi is probably the only reason we stayed up last season viral to our team.
Saint maximin is a baller.
Wouldn't mind that top :)))
Would love saint maximin at Liverpool good back up to salah
Great player
ASM The best dribbler in the league!

Saint Maximin is up there with Ben Arfa for most talented dribbling I’ve ever seen at St. James’ every time I’ve seen him live I feel for the defenders he’s running at 💨😂
Saint maximin= 6 star skiller 🤩
What happened to the go pro in the goal I must have missed him saying about it!?

Saint Max the one and only, absolute quality as always on the cycling GK. Would love to give the shirt away at a charity function for MIND
as a toon fan i get to see him week in week out the guy is an absolute baller, cant believe he is still with us as he would not look out of place at a top 6 side, he will be the difference of us staying up or going down this season team needs to be built around this absolute legend :) come on the boys :D
St-Max the absolute beast! Always makes me think of his iconic goal vs New Zealand
Hope I will win the shirt

Saint-maximin is probably one of the silkiest players in the league. Followed his career for a while and signed him a few times on FM
ASM is electric. Top 6 team for him next season I think, would do a job in the Liverpool squad I think
Streets will never forget. st max goat.

Saint-Maximin is an absolute baller. would love to get his shirt

Maxi is the King of Newcastle. The only thing better than his football prowess is his Twitter game. And his charity work too come to think of it. Top bloke.
Another amazing video! 🔥🤯🥴

Allans a baller.
Saint maximan wears so many bandages if his nicknames isn’t the mummy then I’ll be disappointed with his work colleagues.
Ben, give us the shirt lad !
Saint-Maximin is a cheat code but Ben Foster is a WALL between the sticks.
Been looking into how to being a kitman, any thoughts on how I can get into this career fozzy ?
Saint Maximin absolute baller- super skillfull 🔥
I'm a newcastle fan, saint maxi is our hope hahah. Whenever he gets the ball he brings excitement, definitely my fav player and probably our most skillfull since ben arfa what a baller!
I like turtles
Saint-Max carries Newcastle
Saint Maximum gonna win Newcastle the prem 😂😂
The saint! I am a HUGE Newcastle fan and I would love to get that shirt. I have a framed shirt with his name already but not a match worn one!!
Allan saint maximan - crackingggggg plur
saint maximin is crazily good. He skills defenders up for fun he's almost as fast as adama traore and he should be playing for a top 6 team. Loving the content keep it up fozzy!
Allan saint maximin aka Gucci headband. Most exiting plur on prem
Saint Maximim is a baller man he's quick, skilful and has good end product I dunno what Newcastle would do without him. Also can';t believe that the Prem won't allow the GoPro in goal
Great video as always! Allan is such a class player, just a step away from being one of the best in the position!
Maxi is next level how on earth no one came in for him during the transfer window and take away from us I’ll never know!!  As for that top, whoever nabs that’s, you lucky bugger!! Although I’m happy to take it off your hands like!
Gucci headband beauty. He makes me excited to watch Newcastle again. #HowayTheToon
Saint-Maximin is a beast. He's very fast, strong and a great dribbler. I would love to have him at my club Arsenal. Imagine an attack comprising of Saint-Maximin, Odegaard/Smith-Rowe and Saka playing just behind Aubameyang. It will be fire.
Saint Maximin is a baller the best dribbler in the Premier League In my opinion
Asm is different gravy
saint maximin is just different gravy, proper entertainer
allan is bandana god
you absolute legend! ASM what a baller. Nightmare for defenders.
FIFA club legend for me 😍
He wearing Gucci!
Love it mate
ASM....He is an absolute gem. Our only real attacking threat last season whilst being played out of position (Come on Fiona- he's not a centre forward is he!?!). I'm honestly amazed- delighted, but amazed- that Newcastle have managed to keep hold of him for another year. Probably biggest pure talent at the club since Ben Arfa.
hi ben, i recently started studying at newcastle uni and im wanting to go to every home game this season so having that saint max shirt would be amazing. i think saint max is an absolute baller, but never as good as you ever were!!! loving the vids, keep it up!!
Saint-Maximin is different gravy man, not many players excite you whenever they get the ball in the way that he does
Saint maximin is easily Newcastle’s best player, guy deserves to be at a bigger club!
saint maximin is literally the most entertaining player in the league top baller. also love the vids ben keep up the good content

Newcastle’s Allan Saint-Maximin is a absolute tank of a player and so fast, he is one of my favourite player in the Premier League. Newcastle are very lucky to keep a hold of him as he should be playing for one of the top 6 clubs. I’m a massive fan of the channel, can’t wait for the Premier League upcoming videos from around the country 😃😃😃😃
Newcastle fan here, Allan Saint-Maximin what a player, but no one gets past the cycling gk 🤩🔥

the french greenwood allan saint maximin
United supporter here, Saint-Maximin is a hell of a baller. Honestly a great signing for Newcastle. Gave us grief when they came to OT. Him and Almiron breaking away on the counters always put me on edge. Had a soft spot for Newcastle ever since Goal! (2005). Iconic black and white striped kit with the Northern Rock sponsors will never be forgotten!
Got you on my Wildcard!! Get in
Saint is a star, could see him wear man United shirt
Saint Maximan is bloody amazing. Silky maxi. Love him and YOU
Big fan from Canada, fairly new to soccer but that player is world class love to see it!! Go on watford
Maxi is another level wish him goodluck inside Newcastle
2 vlogs, 2 apple crumbles. Come on the apple crumble 🐝🐝🐝
Couldn't click this video fast enough.  The idea of you washing the shirt in the shower whilst wearing, cheeky bit of lynx, loving it
Saint maximin is underrated and he’s a top BALLER
Saint maximan is an absolute animal his agility and balance is unreal, underated🔥
ASM 🔥

St Maximin is unreal, the GOAT of footwork!
He is the second best in the prem after the Cycling GK

Allan saint maximin is a joke. Should play for mufc
Wait Arsenal and Watford’s training grounds are next to each other :0.
Gotta clench my butt every time Saint-Maximan gets the ball. What a guy. Also Ben Foster is the most kind and fun goalkeeper on the league quote me on that lol.
Allan St. Max is a deadly footballer. And such a down to earth guy as well!
Saint Maxim is like my dads cousins best friends mams sisters brothers nephews dads friends sister brother on my left side. So we’re basically related
I have you in my fpl team give me a clean sheet against Leeds. Come on the boys!!!???
What a baller Saint Maximin. Deserves a call up to the French team 100%
Saint-Maximin is utterly incredible at football and his banter is solid. 10/10 in every aspect

Saint Maximin is definitely the most enjoyable player to watch in the premier league in my opinion 🔥
With ur help I got into academy at Oxford
Cmon the hornets and your in my UT and he’s a baller skills left and right
Mate I need that SM shirt, he is the main man, sooo quick. Love the vids foss 👍🏻
He’s a baller
Been saying it for well over a year now, Saint-Maximin is one of the most under-rated players in the league. Easily good enough to play for a top 6 club now
ASM is the man I would love his shirt! Great content as always Ben!
saint maximin skillfull baller no match for u tho
Saint maximan is the future captain of the street won’t forget world 11 , loving the content as always
What a legend, great video! Allan Saint-Maximin is a baller, amazing dribbling ability.

Saint maximin is a baller. Massive career ahead of him
Baller
Saint maximin is top 10 wingers in the league

7:25 I think ronaldo would be very disappointed
Hi Ben I’m from Mexico and I enjoy so much watching the PL, Maximin he is a serious baller and everyone enjoys his skills and ability with the ball.  I am an Arsenal Fan but I also enjoy watching sarr and watford back where they belong 👌
Good job as always, Ben 💪 Saint-Maximin is ubelievable, joy to watch.
Saint-Maximin is unreal. He plays so differently to other players too. He’s almost unpredictable.
The Goat
Asm is 🔥
Mate love ur vids a diehard Watford fan💛🖤if I were to win ur shirt I’m going to give it to charity if u don’t mind could u please send me the shirt sorry for being selfish I’m trying not to
Saint Maximin’s gucci head band and dribbling ability is world class
Just want the Saint maximan jersey because he's the first big thing I've seen coming from Newcastle in a while,not only his pace but his sheer agility. one of the only reasons I might tune into the magpies from time to time. Much love Benny boy
Saint Max is a baller, love the vids Ben👍🏻
Newcastle fan here Ben, was at the game and you deserved the draw. You can see how key ASM is for us tho with how many chances he creates.
Upset the GoPro in the goal is gone but understandable in the Prem! Saint Maximin is a baller, plays in the Prem like he’s in the street!
ASM IS A CERTIFIED BALLER!
Allan 🐐
Ozan is the funniest guy in turkish football community. take good care of him boss
Saint-Maximin absolute baller,  runs the show - won me the champions league in my Newcastle career mode as well
Saint-Maximin King of skills 🔥
Asm is a joke, he even sends the camera crew 😂
What a baller he is
ASM my hero single handley pulling Newcastle through games   Some massive saves in the game as it could have been over by half time
Saint-Maximin is the GOAT
Saint-maximum absolute baller, get him in the fantasy team surely
Allan Saint-Maximin is just so freaken SENSATIONALl to watch honestly. What an ABSOLUTE legend!!
As a Sunderland fan, I’ll have to keep my mouth shut… Keep the vlogs coming!
he is going to a top 5 club in January for sure.
Maxim is so underrated. One day he will be a top club but I hope he doesn’t turn into a zaha who can only perform at smaller clubs
Great Vlog Ben Great to see you back in the 1st team Whoever wins the giveway is lucky as ASM is  tearing up the prem.
Saint-Maximin is definitely our best player at the minute. I'm lucky I had him in my fantasy 😅😬
Alan saint maximan is a beast and such a good player
ahaha love it! saint maximan what an absolute baller!
Love your videos Ben as always. As for ASM - yeah he is baller. Better version of Adama Traore. But as for the prices..what's the point if it's only for UK citizens? You have followers from all around the world :)
What a baller, FIFA did him dirty with the stats
ASM is my favourite player as a toon fan, love the bloke up the mags
Pieface is clueless about football... The way he struggled on the weekend with sky.. He was probably thinking more about his dinner
He is an absolute baller one of the best dribbler in the world
Saint-Maximin is a baller ! So silky and skilful . Love the channel and the videos mate !
ALLAN SAINT MAXIMAN ISSS THE GOAT
Saint Max is so skilful and silky great video as always Ben must be gutted you can’t get Watford lads in FPL Sarr has been killing it lately!
Maxi is amazing
saint maximin will be in a top 6 team next season
Allan saint maximin is good but not quite big bazzlar
Nah Ben I need that shirt, after the pain of not getting 3 pts yet. Maxi is an absolute baller 🙌
Ben fosters vlog and pie face, cmon what a day!!
ASM is amazing. But you played outstanding BF
Saint max was a SERIOUS BALLER
Saint maximin straight in my fantasy btw I’d love the shirt 🤩

Star man ben
Saint maximan is a beast
Great video 😄
I love the Cycling GK. Great Channel. Keep it up Ben
I believe st maximin can't be overlooked, he will be a fantastic player, he is a really tricky player to play against and you did well this game, keep the uploads coming :)
Saint-Maximin what a baller, a special talent who is central to Newcastle’s chances of staying up. He needs to keep fit, not such a good shout in FPL now he’s a forward.
ASM should really be playing for france or start a youtube channel to challenge the F2, he is unreal     p.s. ben lad, i went north leam as well ;)
saint maximin is a balllller, one of the most technically gifted players in the league for sure. Love the videos Cycling GK!
Get me in the Gucci gang he’s a baller
What a player Saint-Maximin is! He can pick up the ball in his own half and take on about 8 players! Such an exciting talent
Honestly reckon Maxim will be at Liverpool in a couple years. Only 24 and he's already bossing the field whenever he plays.
Travelled down from Scotland for the game. It was unbelievable great game to watch
Skills for dayz
Love a bit of pie with a cycling gk vlog
Saint-Maximin - or the guy you hate to see in your opponent's team in FIFA ultimate team. 5* skill moves, fast... and sometimes gets a 5* weak foot upgrade... oh my days...
saint maximin is a top tier baller
He is a baller you did a good job keeping him quiet
Saint-Maximin should be on the France team! Awesome dribbler and player! But your a better GK tho :D
Allan saint maximin should be at a top 6 club for his dribbling alone. Man is a beast. Would love his shirt fozie:)
He was in my dream team in the first week... took him off in the 2nd and total regret!
Прикольно что тренировочные базы Уотфорда совсем рядом с базой Арсенала
Saint Maximin is a certified baller
Ben Foster the GOAT 🐐🐐. Getting me them points on the fpl 🤝
Allan Saint Maximin is truly underrated, he's one of the best dribblers in the league. No offence to Newcastle, but if he'd been playing for a better side around the top 6 he'd be one of the best wingers in Europe.
Rapid and skilful
If ASM can stay injury free, he won't be at Newcastle for much longer I don't think..
Newcastle fan from Sweden here, absolutely love Saint Maximin what a baller, one of my all time favourites in Newcastle. Also a big fan of The Cycling GK, keep up the great stuff Ben, cheers!
Thanks for the vid Ben, legend as always :)
ASM is a baller 🔥
Loving the vlogs fozzie, some worldy saves from you on the weekend, well done! Keep up the great content :)  Saint-Maximin is so quick on his feet, feel like he could've hit that pass back first time and changed the game. Good for us he didn't.
Baller
St maximin is a baller, one of the most entertaining players in the prem

I think saint-maxim is a baller, he’s so sharp, fast and an all round great footballer and he played really well against Leeds and scored a great goal against them but Watford kept him quiet😂
I never really try to enter the giveaway things coz the likely hood of winning is just 0 to none. But, leave a comment see what happens. Was going to put S-Maximin in the fantasy team but I just don't know, up there though. I find it so cool that we get to see stuff like this, behind the scenes. Big up the Foster :)

As an Yank living in Denmark supporting NUFC for the past 15 years(!??)...I'll say this about the ASM shirt: 'I will love it!' Wild match. But you've always checking the Watford scores next now too. Fantastic content this. Cycling GK and Fozcast been getting me through the past COVID year. Really well done and COTB!

Saint maximin top lad
Newcastle fan, was a great game, Would love the ASM shirt, great vlog.
Honestly, I’m a West Ham fan and we played Newcastle at their place first game of the season. I went up to the game and Saint Maximum was an absolute joke. I don’t know if it’s just me, but he really remind me of Ronaldinho. The way he pushes the ball out of his feet with such power, and the over exaggerated step overs. He’s a joy to watch when he’s not playing your team, because he scared the life out of me ever time he got the ball. What a player Ben
Saint max is a baller i would loves his shirt.   btw love the vids <3
That’s got me name on it foster

Are you not allowed to film in the goal anymore?
‘Oi darlin, you with the headband, you are different gravy’. My thoughts on ASM
ASM is the most skilful player in the prem (behind Ben foster)
Gucci is an baller probably the best dribbler in the league love your vids
Saint-Maximin is more then capable of being world class. I think this season he'll shine really hard and get him a move to a european competition club because hes very much capable of that and more.
one word for maxi - GOAT
Saint-maximin is such an underrated baller and definitely has a good future ahead.
Can I have Allan’s shirt, as I have well better techers
Ben, I’d love to win that top. I love your videos and ask how bazzler is for me
These vids are honestly the highlight of my week! Allan saint maximin btw is easily one of the most underrated players in the premier league if he went to a bigger club he could be world class! He’s easily one of the best dribblers in the premier league
Would love that shirt mate, Saint-Maximin is a baller, we wouldn’t be where we are without him. Trekked 14 hours to watch Newcastle on Saturday so would make it worth while for me Ben ❤️
Great video again Ben, where was the go pro in the goal ?? Nevermind though saint maximin is a player rapid and sharp also a great fifa card too. Keep it up 👍🏻

Would love this jersey as I’m a massive toon fan was heartbreak watching you pull off all those saves against us but saint maximan is unreal fingers crossed I get the jersey
ASM is a baller he said he wanted to break into the French squad and if he keeps this up he deserves to be there so much flair
Saint maximan is a goat
Saint Maximin is a quality player especially his dribbling 🔥
Saint-Max would literally rinse any team and then some if he was using just 10% of his power. If he used 50% he would score 40 goals a season 😂.
Newcastle fan here. Allan is an absolute beauty. ⚫️⚪️ would love to win the shirt mate. Keep up the videos 🔥
Please let me have the saint maximan shirt
Allan have some incredible skill on him and he is very entertaining to watch

Saint maximum is an absolute baller. His skills and pace are unbelievable! Still can’t forget that Fabinho tackle on him tho 💪 must be a nightmare to defend against!!
I have been watching this channel for almost a year (I’m serious) and I can’t get bored of it.
I had an utter stinker on FPL as well. Only 31 points. Need to get into the 60s
He’s my favourite player for Newcastle love watching him week in week out
king
