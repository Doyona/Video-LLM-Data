I like how he punshes his arm and shouts ARRG making Joshua laugh. He is ridiculous!
got to love pulev here, he was very fired up
Yeah, I think Pulev was just trying to get under Joshua's skin with the whole time, and it failed.
As a Bulgarian, Pulev is an utter joke, without any sportsmanship!
As a bulgarian...i feel embarrassed, why is he acting like this and trash talking... embarrassing behaviour from Pulev.
Бай Ганьо в Европата🤦‍♀️
Tomorrow I show you how I loose
Adam eğleniyor ya çok sempatik  mütevazı bir  adam pulev
Pulev got ktfo...all that talking for nothing...alpha male weakling...just like all loud alpha males..the louder they bark the easier they fall.
With this type of behavior AJ doesn’t stand a chance against  the Top 3 and will never be Campion again Fury Usyk and Wlder.   He sees being competitive as „disrespect“   Pulev just has the Right Energy as a Titel challenge and it’s all ready got into AJs Head a lil … I hope he gets more competitive and hungry
“tomorrow i show you “  trade mark  😂😂😂
като мастия го би Джошуа,селска мастия
brat mi go izpatka na piko
Wait my question is....Why is AJ being weighed with his headphones on? I know it won't be much of a difference but still lol
at least Pulev didn't attempt the abrupt french kiss this time
Kobra👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
pulev -  iam amazing!!   gets knocked out.......
Срам
pulev is a total fruit cake
Teacher: Where is your homework?  Me: Tomorrow I show you
Селяния до шия
****Pulev, as a fighter, was, is and always will be the greatest looser Bulgaria had. And as a human being, in 2020, he also proved to be a huge hypocrite and liar by promising, no matter if winning or loosing the  fight, he will donate money to the bulgarian hospital wards and doctors, who's fighting on the first line with the Covid-19. He lost the match, but he didn't kept his promise. He kept the money and then he accept the proposition to enter in the politics by participating in the soming elections for the Parliament. What a poor human being.  Let's have a minute of silence for Pulev's lost human potential.
Who will do with me, I buy you or I will send a message from Fadelikom. Thank you
Click bait,   NOT UNSEEN
Малко се поизложи
Me after wiping my ass in one go 4:39
:D It's amazing  show
Got destroyed what a fool
Notice that when AJ is pissed he doesn't blink. Not just with Pulev, with anyone. That's when you see that side of him
Pulev GG
Pulev showed how to get knock out.  Joshua is real champion of the world.
Talk is cheap.
Pulev: a cheesy trash talker and a shittie boxer.
Pulev  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣
yes you showed us how you got knocked out
To be fair to Pulev, you can't blame him being fired up! It was his moment to step up. Nothing wrong with getting in the opponent face before you fight, even if he was a little bit...over the top with it haha
I have said joshua is the best after Tyson fury
tomorrow i show u ...
Pulev had to choose from the start of this is he going to be an arrogant asshole or a gentleman.I do not know wich one he chose😂
Tomorrow i show you🤣🤣🤣
I’m amazing at getting knocked out 💀💀💀
Tomorrow I show you how i can get knocked out 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Think Pulev might want to rethink his pre fight intimidation tactics seeing what happened....
AJ dealt with him with such class
"tomorrow I show you I'm the best sleeper.
Pulev a racist prik Joshua dealt with him
You gotta give the guy some credits lol, Absolutely an Amazing character lol, He wins there even though he did not in the ring😂😂
Kubrat showed AJ he loves eating uppercuts.
Uncle nob head
Вот как виглядит Испанский стыд...
Tomorrow i show you 😂😂😂😂
Кобрата вечния селянин.
This aged well. I wonder if he still thinks he’s amazing.
Кубрат Пулев ,не се прави така!!!!Срам си за България!!!
Pulev is definitelly an AJ fan
Pulev mentally is not ok  )
One of the best weight videos , alot of tension 🤣🤣🤣🤣
AJ you showed him how to get down or lay down lol
Aj is not sportive to much hate gome on jush he just try to make it a show to looking for
Who’s here after AJ just KOed him TF OUT
I'm shamed of him About Pulev
И "tomorrow" лежиш прострян......
At the end his name changed to Kubrat Caveman Pulev
let´s go champ let´s go champ let´s go champ .................................................................................
I'm amazing AAAAAAAA
Suckered In by the big fraud and matchroom can’t wait for Tyson to end this charade. Best mates these 2 it’s embarrassing people don’t see through it
Aj started that shit tho ! All the other was edited
The end had me in stitches
Tomorrow  i wil  show  you how  how  i wil  kiss  the canvas. But he still says  to Joshua  that he respect   him   Thats is  cool
Now what you saying pulev 😴😴😴😴
empty drum 🥁 makes  the louder 🔊 noise
Pulev hit first after the bell but they only called Joshua out for hittin after the bell. Joshua said u hit me after im gonna hit  u back. These commentators be seeing things wrong alot. Pulev hittin in the back of the head like Fury was, Pulev just getting that check, he knew he wouldnt win thats why he smiling and laughing, i shoulda bet money i called it, and said he would stop him. Funny why they gloves dont look like Fury's gloves, none of these latest fights hummmmmm, nobody glove sliding down no wraps showing, no flapping.  Joshua upper cutting his aaaa*** off on Pulev hahaha.  Why is it when white fighters start to loose they start to saying he's a great warrior a tough guy bla bla bla.  But if a black fighter start to loose just bad remarks. This world man
AJ is man of action I like him for that big up for him respect
I love the arm wrestle bit 😂😂😂
PULEV Tomorrow I'll show you my back KUBURAT. Lol.
I'm show you, tomorrow hehe
Looooooool mad funny but I loved that energy Pulev was coming with
“Tomorrow i show you how to be a punching bag”
24 Hours LaYaAA
Pulev showed he has no class I guess that’s why he’s broke an AJ is so famous! Biggie!
Pulev seems to me a decent guy trying too hard at the quasi trash talk; he's not even trash talking imo, coz he sounded hilarious; just trying to put up a tough guy facade, lol; nice guy.
Pulev talked trash and amazingly got knocked out for it,hahaha,🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Pulev is a joke ting talking all that smack until aj knocked him out cold
Pulev is a characterister, but like him
What a TWAT! “I’m a amazing, I’m amazing, I’m better than you.” Then gets knock the F out? 😆😂🤣😆
AJ put the gobshite to sleep. 😂🤣
Kubrat tomorrow i show you Pulev,,.
After all that he still lost
Они что бухие???
No trying, tomorrow I show you
Tomorrow l'll show you, no trying, l like it.😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Tomorrow I show you how you knock me down multiple times and beat me!
AJ STOP FIGHTING OLD BOXERS. GO AND FIGHT A REAL BOXER FURY! YOU HAVE BEEN DOCKING HIM FOR YEARS NOW YOU LITTLE DOSSER
I would've liked to have seen the arm wrestling match before the bout lol
The White  'Adrien Broner'...
Well u didn’t show anything 🤣🤣🤣🤣 AJ knocked him the f out
Who’s here after AJ took care of business ?
Fight between Pulev and Shannon Briggs: - Tomorrow i'll show you! - Let's go champ!
COOKED COBRA MY FRIEND 😂😂
AJ humbled Pulev
Thats why the call them wolf tickets pulev, your ass couldn't cash that check.....💣 SQUAAAAAD
I came her after watching the fight, lmaoooo
The guy is a nut case.....What happened pulev.....Came back and bark aaaaaooooh🤣
All these brainwashed sheep wearing face nappies
Joshua will lose again
Tomorrow I show you.. 👊➡️⬅️👊
I'm here after AJ wins he told aj tomorrow I  show you ahahahah
Tomorrow I show you!!! And then he got knock out...🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think the racist Joshua had lost most of his supporters and good riddens to him.
ARM WRESTLE ARM WRESTLE
When trash talk goes bad. Lol
ALL THAT CHIT CHAT AND THEN HE GOT KNOCKED OUT. 🙄
I’ve never seen a man so excited about getting knocked out
Yeah pulev you showed him alright. You and your team go fucking bury your heads in the sand now!!!! Bye
Too much barking like an animal pulav
Anthony is a calm beast.
I'm amazing. Famous last words
Pure entertaintment👍
Who is here after the whooping 😂😂😂
Guys Pulev was laughing while acting like the mafia. He just tried to make it more exciting but we all knew he wasn't gonna win.
That's how eastern Europeans react when anxiety hit them... try to act tough.."I'm a better boxer than you" under your blind assumption you can't say shit. Aj got a cool mentality calm and swift....i would say Asians, blacks African and Caribbeans, south Americans, Southeast Asians inds, Filipinos, paks, are better fighters
Pulev is a weasel lol
tomorow i show you .   finaly 4times knockout
I know AJ is a legend ..but pulev having a stronger chin
This aged well
He shaped him...
Well, it's tomorrow, and he didn't show him.
Pulev: Knocks Joshua out.                             Joshua: “Humble Yourself”
And when it was "tomorrow" as said, Pulev showed AJ in a big way. Next?
Didn’t talk when he got his lights punched out
AJ don’t talk he just knocks mans out
I am amazing like pulev 😁😁😁
It's all a show, it's not a spontaneous conversation. We have seen this many times 🙂 Too bad I couldn't watch the match. And too bad for Kubrat. I love him, but he need to put all of his energy in the fight and not to talk bs. Staged or not.
A great theatre... it was decided that Joshua will win on latest rounds or by points.. Pulev take a big premium.. .thats all... It is amad..mad..box mafia..
"i like you, tomorrow i show you" romantic :D
"I'm a better boxer" .... Well, this aged well
So much noise and empty confidence from Pulev. Who is here after AJ took him out with a donut punch that left Pulev UNAMAZING on the floor?
This didn't go well for pulev
yes AJ won - that’s what I’m talking bout
Oh he showed him alright.  "Hey Anthony you should check out the quality of this canvas!"
I mean to be fair the promotion wasn’t that good due to covid and stuff, at least they are trynna make some atmosphere for the fight
I hope pulev knocks this traitor out. Like ruiz did.
Pulev is a shit old man
Trying hard to hype the fight
Aj looks lean.
Staged
Joshua doing nothing to sell the fight cuz he is the hero. Well somebody has to be pantomime villain and Pulev is stepping up. LOL
These guys love each other and respect each1 so we gonna have a super fight
Puliev is such a nice cool guy but him beat Joshua will be a nightnare
Let’s go AJ... make him humble
Fake just to get attention
Puvlev has a sinful look
Pulev has to come with a little showmanship for the audience, sorry to say but its only his nerves talking.
Sleep well Joshua he's no taco filled Mexican who nearly ripped your ears off...
That black guy on Pulev's team has only got eyes for AJ... Check him out tho..Its a love thing🥰😘
Тъп селянин кобрат пак бои те чака кобра същата работа пак ще стане както с кличко този пат направо с носилка те взимат
Joshua is just a talker using his mother tongue to his advantage.... i hope he loses....i tries too hard to be the favorite son in law
Fake aj stops him round 8
_Joshua_ about to lose again! Overrated boxer.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌
Pulev with the better personality that's for sure
Teacher: where is your homework? Pulev: Tomorrow i show you
any road man knows if a man is talkin crap u shud never spud him 🤦‍♂️ aj is moving reallll soft rite now
I've always wondered why the bouncers don't get in the ring instead of the boxers. Be better fight.
Joshua is the real man
them body shots are coming to do damage from pulev 😋
От того, что пулев покречит он сильнее и техничнее не станет. И от нокаута это его не спасет
Pulevv is nothing but a barking dog...they don't bite
I just don't like Joshua after the whole swerve white people's businesses speech ...  I want Pulev to iron him out but he's 5 years past his peak and been inactive so I can't see him beating Joshua
Another A.J fight nobody is interested in seeing. This racist needs to stop dodging fury and wilder. Pulev is not a contender.
Colko si prost pulev
Subscribe to Mike hunt :)
I can’t wait to see aj brutality knock this guy out for talking too much. I can’t wait to see his face after he loses.
Hope pulev wins
I’ll come back when Pulev is eating the canvas 🐶
Coward Anthony 🤣 he telling the man to humble yourself Fool 😂 the man who is coming to knock him out 🤣💯 facts he is scared he wants everybody to be in there nice kissing his bum cheeks 🤣
I'm amazing!!! Lets arm wrestle!! Lol
Joshua is a cool guy man hahaha.
Paraga vodka drink they work in pulev body.
This is looking like a brawl ..!!👊🏼
What does: "people like you," mean.
First round ko
5:28 now he wants to arm wrestle 🤦‍♂😂
In fairness pulev use to be decent but i see aj smashing him to pieces
Good bye Bollockov
I swear boxing is fxxking retarded, why is the time of the fight not posted every where. We shouldn't be able to forget the time of these fights, thats how much we should have seen it.
Love Pulev to win but.........nahh money is going on Joshy.
Who’s going to pay to watch these sausage wallets fight
Pulev is f’kin funny, lol!
Nobody in North America cares about aj it’s sad Tyson fury did this with all his cheating
dude is hilarious
Load off shite staged
Pulev to kick him round the ring for a bit then khtfo
Pathetic.  Grown men gone wrong  It's a sport. Play ya sport without the embarrassing behavior.
C'mon pulev Ruiz nailed that big dosser and so can you, av it.
That’s why people have guns
Слагайте за Кобрата. Много е лош и ще бие
AJ talking cheap..... Prove shit in the ring without talking to much outside the ring ! AJ shows weakness Pulev shows strong !
This is so staged 😂
That's some friendly back and forth.
I think pulev is pretending to do the whole acting angry and cocky but it comes out very weird because he of his foreign accent .
I really want Joshua to knock him out in the fourth round now,  Pulav behaving badly here different person.
Fury is a cheat
I always laugh when they put "UNSEEN" clip in the title and its been seen like half a million times
Anthony ‘humble yourself’ *fistbump* Joshua
Why are they wearing masks no one there has covid
AJ Fury could be drinking English tea, shaking hands, giving compliments to eachother respectfully and sell 1000x more than this unwanted fight.  Eddie won this one! Nice one Eddie! What a business man! 😎
He took the same shot as aj from klitchko and took it like a champ
Slagging off selling the fight not many people want to see... mandatory 😴😴😴  Vacate the useless belts and fight the best! Screw the belts, fight the best! Screw the belts, fight the best! Win or loose, give it a good go! L's are nothing, just have a good fight thats all people want to see, Gladiators!
Pulev got roid rage
Hopefully Pulev will knock his block off
All the pickled heads wearing masks! jobs fucked, world is fucked!
i like Joshua so much - he is always calm - respect - true champion
Blatantly for views!
Wonder how much Hearn has paid Pulev to try and ramp up the flagging sales of this fight? 🤔
Joshua sold out to the working class brits.Good good Pulev (from a working class Brit).
Where is Y.B though ??????
Has anyone during this "trash talk" phase learned in a just pecked the other one on the nose. Like just stands there in silence while they're trash talking for 5 minutes then leans in .. I think that'd annoy them more than the "trash talking". Like Rizzo the Rat does in a Muppet's Christmas Carol (YouTube Rizzo's Jelly Beans A Muppets Christmas Carol at 0:34)
I mean all you can hear is that twat screaming in the background... Calm down grandad Jesus...
Ajs from watford. Zero trash talk ability smh.
Pulev isti Dzevad Puturak, zavrsit ce nokautiran  hladnokrvno
Pulev: Knocks Joshua out.                             Joshua: “Humble Yourself”
Haha pulev will get knocked out like vs klitschko, he is a joke and disrespectful
load of garbage  , fight wilder or fury
Of course they do Eddie ... Yaaaaaswwwn.
As a bulgarian i am definitely on Pulev’s side but he is too old i feel like
Check my channel out people good content from uk
Drago: i must break you Pulev: tomorrow i show you man
На какви наркотици е тоз пулев уе🤣🤣
‘Humble yourself’ says the vain black supremacist who when asked what he sees in the mirror replies with ‘wisdom’  AJ is so fake it’s cringe
Stop the fist bumping and get in there and smash pulev to bits right From the of  I’m making a prediction Anthony knocks him out in the first round
Cringe inducing black supremacist vs 47 year old sexual predator
I like you, respect, tomorrow i show you 😂
Aj k.os him inside 6
I am amazing...
Don't underestimate Pulev
It's like a WWE media Circus .... bullshit ..
Hope AJ smashes him.. and I’m not even a big AJ fan. I just want the AJ vs Fury match up and I want AJ and Tyson to be the two best because they’re both clearly good guys with the right, but different attitudes.
Bap bap
AJ KO within 6 rounds
Aj is just think what is this guy on
Все си мислех, че от това колко ме е срам сега в момента, че съм от България няма да има на къде повече. Оказа се обаче, и от дъното имало по-надоло ! Това поведение на един истински претендент за световна титла ли е ? Независимо за какъв спорт става въпрос. Надменно, самохвално, граничещо с пиянско поведение. Много дрънкане, перчене, а после със супола до устата  " Продължаваме напред" Смешен та чак жалак. Дано тоя вземе та го понабие  малко, че да вземе да се приземи на земята.
this is the funniest weigh in I've seen lool everyone was like it's serious I was laughing the whole damn time pulev dosent act like this normally
Never underestimate the importance of mind games in boxing, pulev trying to get in joshuas head, and anyone that thinks he can’t beat Joshua should look at his record and also look what happened when whyte fought povetkin. If Joshua doesn’t fight smart, all it takes is one punch
Cant wait to see pulev get knocked out
Anyone who supports AJ is an anti white hate filled hypocrite, you would be shouting from the roof tops if whites said what privileged black supremacist AJ did
PULEV FOR THE WIN 🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬
Pulev old enough to be aj dad
Hope AJ gets smashed
Pulev acting very cringe tho
i think he‘ll show him his new sleep position
Is Pulev drunk or just an embarrassing dumb old men ?
This fist pump hurt me 😩😩
Lyrics: Tomorrow I show you! x10
I am ashamed of this man . Hi's not Bulgarian :(
Awwwwooooooooo
Pulev had better not get chinned in the 1st round after all that.😃
I remember when AJ gave white that same look he gave pulev at 05:00
Pulev vs usyik
Pulev likes Joshua he wants to fist him
See now I earned y’all’s trust.
Pulev shut up mate  😖
I think he’ll show him something tomorrow or whatever
Whys Joshua keep spudding him like a jokeman should've just kept it moving
02:55 the eyes of a killer...Pulev is in BIG trouble
Tomorrow I will  show u lol
Aj looking more like a boxer now. That's good. He's softer and lighter meaning he can and will move more than he does
He's been beaten by a fat man maybe now an old man too.
I only want Joshua to win this so I can see Tyson Fury do a number on him. The true people's champ.
I think Pulev is going to take deep sleep
Pulev is very foolish and talkative. You’re amazing without being a champion or having a single belt to show for being amazing as he claimed. He’s just a clown and worst than big baby Miller. Joshua beat Kilshko who knocked out Pulev.
Talk talk talk show off chump aj will remember u acting a fool and knock u out old man
Aj within 6 by ko/stoppage
this guy is made for joshua i dont see it going past two rounds
at least he didn't try to kiss him
Yes Pulev!!!!! Yes. He has some words, he believes!!!
4:16 no trying no trying 😂meme nation ,you have work to do ? Make us some beautiful meme with this
Kubrat "I Will Show You" Pulev 😅🙉
First round AJ😅
5:05 😂😂
Staged af. I'm guessing PPV numbers are not what Hearn hoped them to be.
Mr Pulev needs to do the opposite of what he did against Vladimir as waving them arms around will leave a path for AJ to get through.
AJ i really admire your professionalism.  That's what makes you one of the greatest in boxing.  You don't talk shit but you deliver and that's what matters..
Cool. Still not paying £25
“Tomorrow I’ll show you” 😂 let’s see what happens after the fight, I want to see a good fight.
Arm wrestle.lets go arm wrestle...Jushua lives
This fight gonna join when trash talking fighters goes wrong Aj boxing to the universe
Pulev you are funny 😂🤣🤣
Daniel dubois vs joe joyce was a great match up. This fight is cherry picked.
Why these top fighters always going for some old outdated boxers.
Anthony joshua done juju on his shoulder in the weigh in he tapped his shoulder and then at the end he said “is your shoulder good,is your shoulder okay”.
Cant help but like pulevs energy
aj is responding like a guy from the street would during an argument outside a chippy at night. he is doing too much explaining and trying to stop pulev talking but is unsuccessful in his efforts. aj is definitely showing his immaturity.
Anthony is definitely a better person than our man! Humble, purposeful and respectful of his opponent! That's the way every champion should behave! Not to mention his lifestyle .... a much more appropriate champion than our guy.
Pulev trying to break AJs knuckles with the fist bump. Hes the dirtiest fighter ive seen in last 20 years. Constant rabbit punches.
Scared pulev😆
I LAIK YOU! I LAIK YOU! I RESPECT YOU! I'M AMAZING! TOMORROW I SHOW YOU!  Man's a loon.
You the man kubrat
For all those who say Pulev is mad, drunk or crazy - he is bulgarian and this is normal behavior. Tonight Pulev will kick AJ ass for sure!
Joshua getting knocked out down you go big man
I actually enjoyed Pulev drama. It is all about entertainment. Kudos to him. AJ will school him through to the knockout round. Good luck to both.
Well pulev has bought himself a few more ppv buys 🤣🤣
Aj looks good no homo, in the first Ruiz fight he was way too big
I think this showboating has now become compulsory with every fight now  . They are not fooling anyone. We all know it’s to build up the interest in the fight ...
Old fast car trying to make out like AJ isn't fighting a 40 year old and making this out to be something worth watching. £££s
I think Pulev is happy that he can speak English now hence all the talk he is just excited, at the end when he sort of roars then laughs got me 🤣
МАЧКАЙ КОБРАААААА!!!!
Let's go arm wrestling  🤣🤣🤣🤣 aarrrhhh cobra, end of video 🤣🤣🤣
Pulevs a nut job 😂
Tomorrow I show you PS5
Tomorrow I show you how to kiss 🤣🤣
I'm English but Im rooting for Pulev👊 AJ the racist!
AJs physically leaner less like a body builder. Looks fitter and most likely faster now. Today he'll show Pulev.
Too bad AJ got so much backlash for speaking up against police brutality. I respect him the more for it
Can’t see what the problem is ...he fighter needs to believe in his self if that’s how he gets him self pumped up who cares . Aj just got to be switched on and get the job done then we have the biggest fight this country as seen .
When Pulev fought with Klitchko teh Bulgarians also screamed some shit in racist maner
Pulev ain't playing he knows that Joshua is suspect
if boxing math is correct, and AJ KO Wladamir and he KO Pulev, AJ is safe bet
Loool PULEV IS FUKIN CRAZY.😅😅😅😅😅
Arm wrestle🤣🤣🤣   forget boxing ill love to see the arm wrestle lol
Pulev woudn't behave like this unless he truly believed he had a chance.
One line that really annoys me is calling Fermi Joshua `the fighting pride of the United Kingdom`. No convicted drug dealing, ankle bracelet wearing Nigerian is my fighting pride.  There`s only oneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Tyson Fury.  PS .... Fermi is his real name.
I'm. Bulgarian from. Sfia, I met him in the the mountain, he s no joke, a kind of a guy you just want to look away when you cross eyes
Joshua is a pussy he didnt want to fight in turkey 🇹🇷
I see fear in both fighter’s eyes. Also their body composure and bodylanguage indicates so as welll.  Tonight we will se who the better man is.
Źzzzzzz
This is gona be fake mutch
Pulev just mentally destroyed AJ here. Masterclass in mind games.
Someone had to create a bit of drama because nobody’s interested 😂
😂 kids playing hard
Pulev I can speak english: tommorow I show you x 30  Pulev = Briggs freak guy lets go champ🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
AJ in 4
Common AJ bite him...
Bulgarian power smashing e everything
Now listen in every body....this is really important... Please remember Deontay Wilder was first to wear a face mask and Joshua's has come undone...he needs to get a few more tattoos and stuff to be taken seriously
Pulev is going to wake up in the hospital after this fight
Don't shop in no white man's shop ... Hope a.j gets knocked out if not then 100 percent fury will destroy him
Pulev trying to sell more PPV....
A j should invited his drug dealer mates
wait is the fight tomorrow?
i like pulev hes a cool dude,, really. But i think he stands no chance. To be fair i dont watch a lot of his fights, but in the few i did i didnt see anything special. Not a great knockout puncher, also kinda slow, few movement. Good jabs probably
😃 😃 😃 😃
Where can i bet on this with good rates. I wana bet all my salary on AJ
pulev sounds like hes drunk
I like that loool. AJ looks like he’s gonna cry
No more than 5-7 rounds this fight goes, Joshua is getting finished again
Удри удри по тоя Кобра,голям си👊🏻👊🏻🇧🇬
No matter what, AJ has 100 times more class
I think ole mate Joshua is going to get himiluated in this Fight
AJ GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...H  WE ARE WITH YOU.YOUR ORIGINAL  COUNTRY   AND CONTENT  ARE WITH  YOU        ARTIFICIAL  COUNTRY  AND CONTENT CAN  NEVER STAND  BY YOU. GO OOOOOOAJ
Love the aggression in AJ. "I'm the champion, I'll do what I want". Yep, can't really argue with that 🤣
Why does AJ keep touching fists with the plonker
Pulev, that loud bulgarian you later see has pissed themselves and is sleeping on a park bench.
I was a big fan of AJ till i found out how much of a racist scum bag he is. I hope he gets smashed and KOd in every fight now
Old Pulev trying to hype up the interest  to increase his share of the PPV pay packet. AJ KO Round 7 - 10 🥊
Fight is over. Joshua won because he managed to get his hand on Kulev's shoulder.  Also managed to point at him a couple of times.
Pulev is dickhead, Antony is humble guy and going to smash his face.
What is this sweeeeet brother doing in boxing? Pls don't scratch his face, nothing to do with the sport I know but I couldn't help admiring him😘😘❤🤗🌷
Somehow I think Pulev can surprise.
The fight of the glass chin.
i hope AJ wins, this guy does need to be humbled
“This is SPARTA” #300
They don’t make security like they used to....have they seen a gym?
After the fight my blood test will show you
Alrighty then Pulev..... you'd better bring it !
Pulev wins the arm wrestle , my moneys always on the Eastern European’s , he’ll get knocked out though !
Pulev chill bro 😂💀
I don’t like Anthony Joshua as a boxer that much but as a person in general the guy is such a lovely lad Proper role model for kids and big people
Pulev's mouth should be stripped up😤
Aj: "Yes mandem!"  Pulev: " I LIKE YOU MAAANN!......I show you tomorrow man."   Aj: "Chat shit, get banged!" 👍 😂😂
Anthony head you can tell by his face that he’s upset
let's go champ all the best  AJ
Joshua will kick his cocky ass 👊👊👊
He scared me and I’m sat at home lmao 😂
Who wins will there be a big upset hmm who knows that’s why I love boxing lol
AJ is gonna get smashed.  If a little fat man can beat him, Pulev definitely can.  Forget about age in HW boxing.
AJ 💪💪🗯️💫
Pulev's a madman! Lol 😆
Pulev isn't fazed at all. Very cool character. He seems to be living in Joshua's head.
So fake
I thought this was a sport
Pulev will be knocked out before round 4
He's going to be in a trash talking compilation...after he gets knocked out in the first round  😂
Pulev is a likeable guy
Mind games. It not going to work... We see today! 🥊
Bye bye Joshua
Another 1 going to work for franks factory flooring ....you will see him next to the canvas section 😂😂😂
Pulev the new champion
man as a Bulgarian i am kind of ashamed of pulevs' pre-fight attitude. AJ is trying to keep it civil and pulev is barking and just being a complete idiot
Them spuds looking like jabs
Talk is cheap
Let’s hope pulev knocks ten bells out of aj
Pulev just making himself look like a fool. Pub idiot.   I hope Anthony knocks him around for a few rounds before knocking his lights out.
This all smells of perfect uppercut by Joshua :-)
Tomorrow...Referee will kick off the fight ..."Protect your lips 💋 all the time!!! "
Got to admit Pulev is halarious
I wish the guy that kept shouting in the crowd got removed straight away....poor form matchroom....ruined it.....
Joshua got this
Andrew Golotta vibes. And new!
How is pulev even getting another crack at the world title? He's a bum!
За този субект Алеко Константинов е посветил цяла творба. Казва се   "До Чикаго и назад" . Съжалявам, че коментарът е малко децентрализиран от темата, но как може Алеко да опише така добре образа на един обикновен българин, попаднал в западно общество. Личи си как Кубрат изпъква на фона на тези мъже, които гледат да не говорят много, а той точно обратното - гледа да не млъкне. И като го гледаш един такъв ръбат и груб, крещящ като горила, търсещ внимание и пряк физически контакт. Абсолютно животно. Боксът е грубиянски спорт за джентълмени, а не обратното. Съжалявам, ако съм натъжил някой/и от вас. Аз също се чувствам Българин и няма как да му пожелая да падне, но мога да му пожелая да стане по-добър човек. За жалост желязото се кове докато още е топло, а той отдавна е изстинал.
FIGHT NIGHT
Pulev coming with that nervous energy
AJ by knock out
Pulev about to kiss AJ too 😂
Respectful, and two fighters ready for war, think AJ wins this, but he must box with his heart and his  experience, only that will determine on how this fight will end. But down the road he must fight Fury, then and only then can we pour proper judgment on AJ.
05:04 АХАХАХХАХАХ ИМААА ЛИ ЛУДИИИИИИ?????
All this promoting fight trash talk is just getting silly now.
Победа!
Easy money for AJ. Haven't met a tough Bulgarian yet.
😂😂 oh really joshua fighting tommorow 😂😂 i mean ufc have better early prelims than this bs
Lolzzzz AJ will win by KO
All a show for buys on ppv
No try! Tomorrow I show you!
AJ!! My man!!!
Pulew pigs
TOMORROW I SHOW YOU MAN
The difference in intellegence shows lol
Pulev just made this worse for himself ...early KO I see, Aj is pissed lol
Joshua a racist
Oh shit man this man whose name kubrat pulev is clown
and it starts, someone going night night, dont forget sleeping bag lol
Wots your Predictions then?
Eddie hearn definitely promised pulev extra bag for acting like that
Н kobrat pulev shte qde krivaka smeshnika
Stupid move punching knuckles together, fight could have been off before it started!
The humble rumble
These guys like they got Alzheimers or sum, repeatedly repeating themselves 🤣
Cant wait for AJ to knock this clown out
Joshuas Knuckles though 😲
It wasnt a war of words .. One thing is for sure, they are both in great shape and massively fired up.  I have never seen Pulev in such good shape. He will be a tougher test that Ruiz IMO.
Not a big AJ fan but hes got this
Joshua with the KO by round 5 !!! This guy is a bum..
pulev kind of tried to do same thing with klitschko and you must have seen what happende to him.that left hook from wladimer was picture perfect .i am expecting same when joshua knock him down
Pulev's worried. His mouth is over compensating for his abilities.
Whys AJ expecting him to be humble.?
Face mask wearing idiots. Can't watch this crap anymore
How did Pulev even got title shot?
LET'S GOOO ARM WRESTLE!
Pulev 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Well they are obviously trying to sell the fight, but yeah lets see, good luck to both
AJ will deal with Pulev within 5 rounds
Pulev the way he is in this press vs chisora . Just the press conference I would pay for .
AJ, all your enemies will be disgraced in Jesus' name. Amen.
Tomorrow I show you
AJ will knock Pulev on the floor. Amen.
Pulev can talk a fight  But unfortunately that’s were it ends  Won’t last 2 rounds
Aj just break him this fool quick time no jab and move! Just bang and show this man why your the champ ! Then for the real fight of the heavyweights Aj vs Fury 👀👌🏻🤩💴🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Any of these soundbite kids talking about glass jaws in the heavyweight division need to have a paperweight dropped on their left foot and an anvil dropped on their right foot. Don't move your feet, let them land. Tell me if your right foot is made of glass 😂
You boys certainly know how to sell a fight! You have a great future in timeshare... or panto! 😂😂😂 Still can’t afford £25 quid tho, sorry, have to wait for YouTube.
Oooooh the shoulder gives way!!! Nice dog Josh 🙌🏻
this cant be selling well as this is all staged ...
At this point in fight-week AJ's pattern is to take the moral high-ground and begin the condescension needle: Eg. "Bro humble yourself bro, humble yourself..."
he aint gonna show him shit
МАЧКАЙ КОБРАА!!
AJ at looked shook at the end
is it just me or does Anthony Joshua seem a little fragile?
Pulev got no chance man good to see him full of beans tho
Aj his tryna get in your head an knock you off your game plan ,just stay focused  cuzzy , love fam.... now go out there an knock his head off ! 🥊🔥
Kubrat "I'm amazing" pulev
Мухахахахаххахаха madnes, i am from Bulgaria, i hope people dont think that other bulgarians same like Pulev. I am apologies and shame what do Pulev and i hope AJ finish him quickly! He is clown and trying to get in joshua head, AJ will do same think like Dominic Breazeale, maybe early rounds finish him! Guys someone think what do Pulev for sell the fight? PS: Sorry for my English is not so good!
Tyson said it best. The fight begins before the fight itself.
Is that AJ Styles from WWE? He has changed a lot.
Aj couldn't  hype a fight if his life depended on it . Cringy
“The amazing PulevMan” vs Roided “lanky piece of ish” - can’t be more boring than that
Pulev doesn't realise he is 40.
Anyone else got a Ruiz jr deja vu feeling about this one
I like the way thay knocking hands
I'm expecting to loser to cite a hand injury caused due to the amazing idea of fist bumping multiple times at the weigh in 😬
Hopefully AJ gets KO’d
Better than him and you've won nothing of note in your entire life? Show some respect idiot.
I really hope Pulev knocks him out
Pulev proving that being punched in the head for a living does cause issues :D
Tomorrow I show you, Saturday night at 11.00pm Pulev on his arse saying you see, I told you I would show you.
When you talk too much before a Joshua matchup, you're getting knocked out. Ruiz was too humble that Joshua didn't see the smoke coming. Now Pulev will pay for his trash talks
AJ has just proved to me why he won’t live with Fury if he gets intimidated by a plum like this.
eddie's plan of constantly saying fury will be there didn't help the ppv buys so he slipped pulev a little bonus i think
That’s how scared people react. His nervous because he know his gonna die lol. AJ wll knock him out in round 3.
Кобрата е издръжлив на бои  estamos con tigo Bulgaro animo
I hope AJ gets another humbling beating!!!!
Pleasantly surprised at the madness of Pulev
"Let's go arm wrestle!"
Handbags😂
Pulev looks like a lot of fun. May the best man win
Both of them repeat same bullshit all over again. Amateurs. Heavyweight division is on a very low level.
End of the day why should pulev come over here and act like a pussy before the fight. Why should he pander like so many to Femi Joshua.  Glad he got under his skin. Whoever wins no problem but this is how a face off should be.  Good on Pulev.  Joshua needs to be like this all the time. Not no fake arse Hearn bitch.  Although I like Hearn.
Pulev is making this genuinely exciting, kudos to him
We’re not falling for it matchroom, there’s nothing going on here just some bullshit. The fight will be shit no matter how much you script some bad blood to hype this up.
Pulev has no stamina after eating 3-4 good shots hes done..by the 7th round its over
"I like him  but tomorrow I show you" 🤣
Pulev been told by Arum get in his head, he going overboard with this BS and messin hia own head up
....And still
Pulev just watched a lot of conor McGregor press conferences before this
Tomorrow he will show him notin
Just some nonsense to sell a fight no-one wants to see.
If he keeps on telling him “tomorrow I show you’” when will that loop end?
I don't know where the myth that AJ is this humble guy comes from. He's very, very arrogant. Can see it here and seen it when he lost to Ruiz. I find it extremely difficult to like him.
Видяхте ли уважаеми бьлгари колко ние културата и възпитанието викаха като маймуни ревачи от джунглата от щаба на пулев. Той сьщо уткачи адреналин му беше в повече. Това не е поведение на шампион. Излагация.
Not bad for the business.
AJ is lucky he doesn’t need to rely on trash talk to sell his fights because he’s terrible at it!
Wonder if pulev will talk when he's on his back.
Pulev is just happy making good money here. That’s understandable sure. He was the same with Klitschko fight...arrogant and acting like a fool
Ai Laiki u but tomorrow Ai sho u 😂😂😂
Let's goo
Joshua will destroy this guy.  He's nothing before Joshua.
Bollox
They should have put subtitles when they were heated
Nobody gives a F@@K about thus SH@T. Fury vs Joshua is the fight we want to see.
Pulev can‘t even speak English
@4:45 he unlocked AJs head...hes probably in side by now
Pulev side was annoying
Pulev mask wasnt covering his nose
Putting us all at risk pulling his mask down like that.  Abhorrent
This exactly what Whyte did
They took fist pumping to another level
"Tomorrow l show you"
If a man has to say Im better, he is not.. but lets see :)
"Tomoro I show you" 😁
Looked like Pulev wanted to kiss AJ
Pulev's angry bc AJ asked him "where's Joe ?" before the weigh in to which he replied "Who Joe ?" and AJ said "Joe Mama"
That’s good sportsmanship. Much respect to both of u champs but as usual, AJ is my hero
All for the cameras.. happens every time before a big fight need to sell as many ppv’s as they can
This drama has come out of nowhere! Hearn must’ve realised that the usual AJ fight hype wasn’t there!
Toi shte im Pokaje dnes
The only word I could hear from them with those masks on was wuffle. 😂
Is only a show
Joshua is too big to be intimidated by no one  in the heavyweight division,  psychological warfare doesn't work with him.he is cold calculating demolisher.
Pulev has gained an English fan here, hope he wins as will get another chance to see his hilarious build ups in their rematch.
Them couple fist bumps..Was a test of strength and coordination I think 🤔..That’s why he turned away laughing 😆..AJ Got This 1..AND STILL..
He actually thinks he is a better fighter than aj I’m dying of laughter 😂😂
Hes juiced up u watch after the fight it come out lol
All Pulev said is he is better and Joshua lost his temper.
Arm wrestle? lol
AJ- I make you humble yourself   Pulev- I am Amazing , I am Amazing
was fixed
Gayest thing I've ever seen.
Sell the fight
Kubrat just begging to get Knockout brutally
Pulev vs Aj Street fight hohooo no rules! I just imagine this mommy's boy AJ against the eastern European slavic bear
I got Pulev by TKO round 8
joshua , hay day cho thang hungari nay 1 bai hoc nho doi , cung nhu thang breazeale
I like the way AJ  put his fist up for him to hit and on the third time AJ moved his fist away 😂
Joshua is gonna beat up Pulev  This is gonna be a one sided fight.
Pulev : Tomorrow I show you Anonymous : Let's go champ?
Paddy Power giving odds of 5/2 for Joshua to win within 6 rounds....Must be worth a punt.
Tyson fury will smash Aj
And new
pulev is an idiot. this tactis dint work with joshua
lets go AJ :D
Take off those fucking mask
The muscle of Joshua is going to be a problem if the fight goes into latter rounds, pulev seems much better physically but I think does not have the ko arsenal like Ruiz or Klitschko, best of luck for both👍
Разбудил зверя A.J
Joshua called pulev to come closer like a kid
что он там пальцем машет.
AJ is very humble that's why we Love you and proud of you... Pulev; tomorrow I'll show you Joshua: people like you have been talking...AJ..💪🥊 for life
TOMORROW IL TEACH YOU HOW TO HUMBLE YOURSELF!!!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 LESGO
Kubrat “I will show you ” Pulev
I can't tell if this is genuine confidence from pulev or false bravado and he's actually shitting himself inside lol .. I hope it's the former
let's go arm wrestle   wtf  lol
3:21 did he say 'tomorrow we go 2 rounds'  ?   lol
Pulev✊✊✊✊✊ ko in 4 round
easy fight for joushua
zzzzzzz......
Sounds like Pulev is trying to convince himself that he's better 😂.   You ask me, I think Pulev is very NERVOUS!! He's gonna get what Whyte got 😂😂
"Let's do arm wrestle"!
come on pulev
Pulev is on crack, stfu and pipe down. You’re getting shafted Saturday night and nobody can help you. Peace out nerd!
That is one amazing fighter right there
5:02 FUCKING MAKES ME LAUGH EVERY SINGLE TIME AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA PULEV IS A LEGEND FOR THIS
Pulev getting smashed up
What begging for an &%$ whuppin Looks Like 101. Pulev is getting Murked by Da Landlord. AJ is probably gonna beat him so bad He won't get credit for it. They'll start saying Pulev is 103 yrs old and Klitchko Beat the best out of him
Ahhhhhhh Tony ferg or aj v pulev..
Why does AJ waste his time with this type of comp???. There are WAAYYY BETTER and More deserving fighters.
andhony,  are champ !!!!!!!!
I LIKE YOU! I RESPECT YOU!
Very dangerous fight for Joshua he better watch it
Trying hard to sell this shit fight
And new...
AJ:pulev where is your homework  Pulev: Aj tomorrow l show u meh
Let’s go team Polev I don’t even know him but he funny asf
I am amazing!!! I am better boxer than you, tomorrow I show you. Tomorrow I show you. 🤣🤣🤣
After the fight, they should do a road trip buddy movie.
For some reason I want Pulev to win just because I'm getting tired of Eddie Hearn's boxing politics
Pulev is not matured thus far.
You know Anthony Joshua whispered in his ear at the beginning and said “yo we gotta hype this fight up”
That laugh at the end haha
Boxers are like two rams 🐑🐑 that eat and play together and the next minute they become enemies. 🤣🤣🤣
What's Pulev doing to that glove.?
Pulev to Joshua "tomorrow i show you" can't wait what Pulev can show 🥂
Bulgarian Mafia runs weed growing in NorCal... shoutout to the family
Joshua mangles him in 3 rounds or less easy work
Let's go arm wrestle looooooooool
Pulev just became funny lol.
Aggression is just fear turned inside out
AJ doesn’t like people talking 🤣
Why do african people always point?
Funny little pecs
still waiting for sky to release bigbaby miller vs aj gloves are off
Kubrat “Tommorow I show you” Pulev🇧🇬
No clash really.. aj was just addressing a rude man called pulev... he has no respect.. I’ve lost all respect for this fool
Nuff respect to both fighters for stepping up and making this fight happen. May the best man win.
When Joshua said "are your shoulders good? Sounds like classified info that wasnt supposed to be leaked.
Whaaat i didn't even know this was happening already 😆
Aj will get knocked out... that's it
Anthony such an inspiration
Clearly no animosity! Just two confident fighters, who have a different style in expressing that confidence. With that said, LET'S GET IT, AJ!!! 😄 👋👋👋
It’s going off 💯👊🏼💥💥💥💥
AJ demonstrates pure Class & Decorum as usual ✊✊✊ C’mon AJ 👊✌️
Chia sẻ trận này đi bn
Man Pulev  the goods to deliver according to what he claims to have. It's his last run probably to a title shot, so he's given it all he's got. But AJ, not intimidated at all.
Bravado been shown here by Pulev at least I hope It's only that but he certainly looks up for the fight, I hope Anthony was as cool as he was playing It , but got to be honest I reckon this could be a little more difficult than those odds are suggesting ✌️
Why pulev take off his clothe when confronting AJ? I think he was a bit intimidated lol
All the kids who support AJ after watching a lucozade advert are like "yeah its wrong to talk with confidence"
Finally, a video where there are no commentators talking over the fighters!
AJ out here needing his opponents to talk nice to him
Correction, AJ is not the fighting pride of the uk...Fury is!
pulev's one loss: Klitschko.  Joshua's one loss: a 270 pound jelly bean Joshua seemed way too arrogant, again.
Pulev waited till today a day before the fight to unsettle AJ......his playing mind games
5:05 pulev got a new fan 🤣🤣🤣
I respect you but I show u im better fighter ???? Whatttttttt. No one with respect and humble character talks like that
Yeah that punching fists thing is a bad idea lol.
AJ is looking lean and in the best shape I’ve ever seen him in. Pulev is a serious test but he’s going for a nap 🥊
How do you win tommrorws fight pulev  Pulev: IM AMAZING
Pulev is getting his head caved in🥊
If you think pulev is gonna be an easy touch for AJ just look up his highlights. Styles make fights so this should be a good war.
Well... That was hilarious 😂😂😂
*AJ living in Pulev's head rent free*
Pulev the psychologist playing with Anthony’s head lol, will be an interesting fight I hope AJ gets sparked sideways like he did against Ruiz
1:16 I quit my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
AJ is a great guy.
AJ blows him back to Bulgaria
5:04 Pulev: *AEEEEUGHHHH*      Aj: 👁👄👁
Anthony knocks him out by the ninth.
😂😂😂😂🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬
Pulev lose his voice for a second or just forget to use the Romanian deep voice act.... Has Pulev been tested for drugs ????... a little over excited maybe !!!
24.95 😂😂😂😂
AJ is scared.  Betting on Kublev
Hmmmm.
How’s ur shoulder ...Let’s have arm wrestle I show u
Fill in the gap I respect you but tomorrow ..........
Joshua is right. He spoke to much. Made a big mistake.
That's the real face off
We know that 40 year old is going to sleep before round 5
Pulev is a twat and he's gettin annihilated
Trying to justify that £24.99 pay per view price
I like this dude Kubrat Pulev. Never heard him before but yea, he cool asf.
😂😂😂 joshua looks realy realy realy scared 😂😂😂
Talking Spicy FOR REAL!
Good battle coming up, everyone is waiting impatiently
Those fist bumps hurt my knuckles 👀
Pulev fishing and Joshua takes the bait 😫🤣
Joshua is like a blow up doll...looks good on the outside but apply a little bit of pressure and he’s finished
AJ is about to lose his belts once again
Pulev is a good and strong boxer but that was 10 years ago.
Eddie almost sh*t his pants when he heard the cracks from those knuckles colliding
Pulev is an ugly mush hope he gets slept
Браво Кобра
Pulev has been coached n groomed enough to act the African way. The end of the video speaks volumes.  B4 AJ gave him a left hand knuckle, the look on AJ's face was like " What did pulev eat b4 coming out here"?. Pulev I see a broda on your corner pushing n psyching you which is good.  When the Iroko tree drops on you tomorrow night, I hope you don't wake up in Iran.
Hey Foolev you beat HUGH Fury not TYSON Fury so dont act like your boxing royalty. Hope AJ smashes your face tomorrow
I hope that Pulev delivers after all this. Its a tall order to beat AJ but at least he isn't lacking confidence in himself which is good.
Kubrat ‘ tomorrow I show you ‘ pulev 🤣
Pulev :Lets do arm wrestle lol 💪
I like you MAN i like you 😂🤣😂🤣
Josh your a pussy
Энтони джошуа 🤜🤜🤜пулев
Wow! two unbelievable power plays by Joshua! 1. The hand on his shoulder at close quarters. 2. Approaching an opponent when you are physically at a lower level and then talking up at him. Pulev is bluster... Good job Ant!
Trying to sell a crap fight
Aj jaw is going to be hanging of its hinges
Girl: say those 4 magic words to me Pulev: tomorrow I show you
Tomorrow I'm gonna humble you the way ruiz humbled me
i love that aj always fights around christmas time, always more fights to remember
AJ: "Listen, humble yourself: Also AJ : "I'll do what I want, Remember I'm the champion"  😆 all love, good luck to both fighters
Puked sound like Tom hanks in the movie the terminal . Kra koja
I think if he makes it ugly in the clinches and takes the fight to Anthony, Pulev has a good chance
Shit clip
I would like to see pulev win he is 8 years older than AJ
1st Round KO for AJ
Pulev is amazing
AJ slipped that 3rd fist bump
Aj is either scared or he likes to bully his opponents as a brit I'm not sure which?? I think he loss to Andy has affect him mental  he seems to be turning into a mini Eddie hearns 🙈
4:50 AJ trying not to laugh 🤣🤣
Mental Game
Какв палячо ставаш за пари
AJ wins easy but not sure what round ....
Много бой ще яде ама му е кеф ,че върза парите.
PULEV👊
Pulev looks in good shape. Seems pumped up with something to prove. Joshua always acts like he's better than he actually is. I don't no but kubrat may be slow but if he can take a punch he will stand a decent chance due to Joshua's week chin
Lol someone’s been drinking too much wine during lockdown in the room 😂😅
Aj was fully like is this guy okay at the end. Got to the point where he went from serious face to let out a little smirk
My brother A.J will K.O Pulev... Lets GO A.J🇳🇬💪
Пак ли взел със себе си софииските мутри там да викат уууу
Woof.. lol I’m sure everyone knows what I mean by this
Bulgarian just being Bulgarian 🤣
Antony “Respect” Joshua 😂
Social distancing 👍🏻
genuinely fascinating to watch! can't wait!
That's alot of fist bumps...!  Wheres the Vodka🇫🇯
This shit was hilarious 🤣 🤣🤣. Anthony’s like “ why you barking like a dog for”
When is the match ? What date ?
there should have been a 3rd fight with RUIZ. he didnt even beat RUIZ like a heavyweight should. he RAN all night
That huge baldy security guard couldn't wait to get out of there so he could he 17 big mac meals
AJ please smash him up
AJ: Your shoulder is good? Pulev: Yea, my shoulder is good.  AJ: So, give no excuses tomorrow like Wilder once I beat you silly.
Мачкаайй кобрааааа🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍👊👊👊👊👊👊👊
Pulev is determined to show AJ how to kiss tomorrow. Lol
1:59 I stopped my work because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Can't stand this humble yourself shit from AJ shut up man about humble yourself this guys probably a million times more humble. He is no were near as successful and doesn't think of himself as a celeb or surround himself with celebrities all blowing smoke up his ass. Hoping AJ gets humbled again like he was with Ruiz can't stand his BS
Personally pulev acting this display shows a last ditch throw at what he won't have again if aj wins, so the attitude makes sense. But joshua needs to complete the job and remain switched on but deadly
4-5th KO or the ref steps in to end it!
Pulev mad nervous relax my friend
Could have busted a knuckle man
Aj getting angry Pulev is a troll lol
Bob Arum: if you not trash talk AJ,i'll not sign you any more.. Pulev: Tomorow i'll show you🤣
Tomorrow I am going to show you🤣🤣 I am amazing🤣 What was the point of screaming when he was punching his own hands haha🤣🤣🤣🤣
That arm wrestle challenge is a new one for me
Come on AJ , KO
Fake beef.
AJ said if your shoulder is good ?🤔🤔  did PULEV ducked him ?  pulev : no i show you.  AJ : HUMBLE your swelf.
haha funny thing! They just wanna make some show, they are clever guys
The ppv sales must be slow....
I'm confused, Puvlev didnt trash talk or swear. He was just excited. He said it multiple times he respects AJ.
Lol AJ breaking character 😅 i like this AJ 😃
Its just a role which he have to play!
How can u tell a man “humble yourself” just because he’s put it on you? Come on!
they pulling this beef out their ass
Pulev, aim for the equilibrium... the equilibrium!!!! 👊🏽🤣
Aj was rubbing his hands in the dressing room saying f&@k that hurt
Kubrat's a character.  Lol. But I think he's getting stopped by round 8.
Kubrat too emotional. He'll be asleep in 4 rounds.
Why’d they punch eachother fists so hard 😂
Too much acting. Very unclassy guy. I think Joshua will teach you a lesson.
i like this aggressive version of joshua better than smiley joshua. he's a boss. i bet he's gonna sleep that moron.
nobody cares ufc 256 is tmrw.
£1000 on PULEV  to WIN-
These dudes have to sell a fight.... Damn near didnt know it was happening until this....
Tomorrow I show you tomorrow I show you. what would tomorrow bring?????
AJ’s gonna fcuk this guy up sheets gonna be peak for Pulev 😬😂
No matter if you hate or love AJ when pulev screamed “ahooooooooo” or whatever he screamed AJ didn’t even move and eyebrow 😂
Not a good advert for Under Armour masks.
Pulev's on fire, AJ looks as sorry as usual , but not promoting the fight real well, Pulev does it with this agressive behaviour, hmm Pulev can fight and got a better engine , Joshua gas out at some earlypoint in the fight
Aj gonna ko him
Pulev is strong butt I go AJ a Point 💪Respect Both Boxser 🥊
Pulev is only admiring the cute guy in AJ
Lets goooo AJ all the way from namibia we behind you...
Untill AJ fights fury or wilder; he is a bum. Always going for the easy fights.
Supporting Joshua from Canada 🇨🇦
This guy always been a character tbh from when he kissed that presenter 😂😂😂
A,J going to smash him 😎👊🏻💥
why should Pulev act like Joshua? rather arrogant from Joshua to tell Pulev how he should behave.  humble yourself? stfu! not everybody has to act in that boring fake humble way.  we like to see characters and personality.  not some manufactered marketing act.
At least he didn't completely disarm him like Ruiz did lol
Its like Shanon Brigs's Lets go champ lives in Pulev :D
Pulev is amazing!
Kubrat and yoel romero against every soul in a bar fight. "Tomorrow i show you, i love you" the other "i luh you mike. You do dees 🖕 to me? I luuhhh yoouuuu"..
Pulev is cool dude but the problem is that he doesn't believe he is better than AJ he knows he isn't and he's gonna lose on points or maybe even late rounds KO
To be fair, when you hear what was actually said, it sounds like standard warrior talk from Pulev. Joshua look triggered by that in that interview lol.
This the fucking Josh we wanna see !! No fake shit, hope he goes in there and knocks him out cold
Why does this remind me of iron man 2 🤣
AJ lost his cool. Let him talk and shout and let the fist talk in the ring tomorrow. Usually people trash talk too much will be on the floor the next day
I can not see an old age pensioner beating AJ but it's a nice thought !
Great to see 😁
Aj is knocking him out in Round three 2 minutes 36 seconds..after 4 knock downs.
Come on AJ big John Fury can beat this guy, hands down..
Pulev one lost to the Great Klitchko, AJ one lost to a fat mexican named Andy whatever...
Tomorrow i will show you,said pulev
Tomorrow I show you until AJ terminates him with one punch
People forget Pulev is wild , crazy and an experienced boxer. Wilder enough to kiss a reporter on live tv 😂
Watch aj come out and try to show the art of boxing and pulev chins him for it . AJ has to use his strength not his skill and surely that's enough
Joshua is a nice quiet assassin. It's extremely hard to tell how mad he is. He better knock his ass smooth out. AJ is overdue for a KO.
Boring
AJ let him run his mouth coz hill will be running from that jab..
AJ: watch your mouth Pulev: bring me a whiskey
Aj became a roadman for this one what a g
Pulev Reminds me of avtandil kurtsidze talking lol i hope he wins
Kubrat Pulev WIN !
26 pound ppv numbers must be down so the acting starts to get peeps interest
Give us this but not aj vs Miller face off
I enjoyed the banter.  Pulev has more personality than I expected.  Too bad he is closer to the end of his career than to the beginning.   I hope for a good fight tomorrow.
Joshua didn't know what to think, he was confused 😅
Okay so just to be clear ... tomorrow ??
5:05 :DDD they both laughed
Pulev is a rugged dude. Military man and tough but he's gonna lose.
I think Pulev just needs to pump himself up, so that he can gain confidence in himself. I think he knows he is done. This will just be a good sparring session before AJ finally gets Fury or Wilder
Joshua is dangerous when an opponent behaves like this I expect a vicious knockout
If you look carefully you can see the spiritual orbs in the left corner could be entitys or a ghost recording in the blue print
Aj talking like a cheap street gangster
“If he don’t die, it don’t count”.
Def ready fo dis fight card is stack but more excited to c shakar Stevenson n ufc card  too respect their fight entertainment gangsta no cap lol stay safe change comin God bless BLM checkout The Main Squeeze🙏
Man this dude drunk Too much Vodka at the weigh in party
I thought he was going to kiss him
I LIKE YOU, MAN....AUUUUGGGGHHH!!  kkkkkkk
Pulev been watching too many Usyk vids.
A.J be like: "humble yourself" - 10 seconds later "I do wa' I want bruv" Lol. 😂🤣
The way to get under Joshua's skin is to be over nice to him, he's not sure how to deal with someone being nice to him. Pulev will get smashed up, AJ enjoys the fight when the opponent is mouthy and aggressive towards him. I hope AJ does what he's best at and blasts Pulev out of there in the first 3 rounds instead of trying to outbox him over 12.
Aj will do a number on him
Words out on AJ: He's got no chin.  He ran for 12 rounds against a grossly out-of-shape Andy Ruiz Jr. All it takes is one shot on that chin...
Who cares.abstain from giving your money to people who actually resent your existence.
He’s bullying Joshua
AJ said 'stay humble' followed by 'I'm the champ I do what I want' stayyyy humble yoooooo
Pulev is not a Sapiens he's still a Neanderthalensis
Who wants the Roadman AJ 😄😆  🥊 🌍
Id like to see an Usyk v Pulev fight build up
The edit both in the cuts and the audio levels could massively be improved with just a tiny bit more attention to detail. Eddie hit me up if ever you need a hand 👍🏼
Ich kann den nicht leiden. Bei den Unterlegenen trägt er stets dick auf und die guten Sportler versucht er und sein Management zu vermeiden.
Kubrat “ tomorrow i show you” Pulev Kubrat “ I’m amazing” Pulev
Успех на нашто момче иска ми се утре да му скъса главата
Anthony to gullible smh
Bit of roid rage there.
Pulev changed after  wladimirs left hook
Oh, my... He is so proud of himself cause he has learnt a little bit of english :D
Anyone know any sites online that I can stream the fight
ppv so far must be so low
He’s a funny fvk Mad Dog Pulev. All for show
So I guess they took the fight knowing pulev has hurt his shoulder, a bit like Whyte back in the day. You know who your beating Anthony. If they not 100% then you already lost
If somebody thinks that this masks help there, goodbye 👋🥸
Kubrat "i'm amazing" Pulev
Pulev has the edge. It depends who lands the first proper punch in this one. As i see it, pulev has the psychological edge from the start. Joshua is too pally wally like its ruiz. Pulev is a different ball game, this guy goes to war.
Pulev is selling the fight. Didnt expect that.
Someone like me Joshua said is that someone who quits
Ye the Pulev fist bump  was hard, but idk if y’all ever notice Anthony Joshuas Knuckles, he be punching walls, I never noticed it till I seen his interview wit the breakfast club his knuckles were bleeding a little,he has strong hands, so I’m pretty sure Pulev Fist bump didn’t hurt to Josh to bad
come on AJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we got this m8!!!!!
Pulev is gonna knock him out AJ is a bum
I wud respect Joshua so much more if he just let the animal out,, always acting how he thinks ppl want him to act,, release the beast!!
5 Rounds and pulev loses 👊💯KO
AJ needs to get back to knocking people spark out again.
When start the match?
So Joshua is winning in 2
To be fair I can see these to meeting up after for arm wrestles and thumb wars
Who needs Sky and there constant adverts when you got matchroom boxing 👌
Sky looking to sell more ppv.all bollox dont give them a penny the tossers
Pulev face is going to look like someone that had a serious accident tomorrow after the fight💪💪💪AJ lets go champ 💪💪💪💪
Siri: book summer holiday to Bulgaria 🇧🇬 to chill with Pulev for a laugh 😂
Pulev has better talk then Fury.
Pulev got a Wide Body !! Touch that Body AJ !!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Did they say Armwrestle 😏
Pulev trying to sell some extra ppv because this will probably be his last fight😁
Pulev seems confident. It's fking up AJ 🤣
AJ bout to spark this fool
Joshua better spark this guy out
Pulevs getting smoked
Humble yourself! You can see it in Joshua's eye his going to rip Pulav apart!
Dead man walking...
Hes like a drunk uncle at parties
Usual publicity stunt then.
Has pulev been drug tested? 😂
They should do a drugs test on Pulev. He seems to coked up, talking like an idiot.
Aj is a knob
Strange how I can’t stand Joshua anymore 😂
Vodka
Pulev’s body language is showing the truth. He’s overacting to show AJ he’s confident BUT he’s not really confident and I think all this hullabaloo will be inconsequential when the fight starts. Joshua will quieten every critic with a brutal destruction of Pulev
AJ TKO via left hook 🥊
How is this unseen? It was shown live...
5:03 My guy AJ didn’t even flinch. As cold as ice 🥶
Pulev could easily play a villain in some action movie.
🇧🇬
This pulev guys a joke he went missing the first fight through injury😂😂 now his suddenly grew a pair of nuts at 39 👌🏻
Us English are just great no were in the world love boxing more and us its in are DNA
They're trying their best to sale this fight 🤣🤣🤣
It’s not unseen if you are showing us...
Dude said he's amazing..lol. yet no one has ever heard of the dude before this fight
this stuff sells
Joshua gets emotional so easily, so quickly, not like a champion would behave.
Lolll
Pulev going to get Clapped up ! ✋🏾
Shoulder is good ?
Kubrat "I'm amazing" Pulev
jesus pulev is scary with that face and voice ngl 😂😂
He will regret about what he did in this conference 🤔
Look out,AJ gonna have another panic attack.
😀😀
No intimation from AJ what so ever
I FEEL PULEV IS CREATING HIS OWN BEFORE AND AFTER VIDEO WITHOUT KNOWING.
What's the odds pulev cause another upset lol 😂
tomorrow he’ll show us.
Decent footage at last, we can acutaly hear them 👍
Tomorrow I Show you. These Russians have the best one liners. Khabib- just give me location. Pulev - Tomorrow I Show you
People don't know Pulev they see this and they think he's a trash talker he is just making it interesting
Not buying the hype it’s all for show because the ppv numbers at £25 are clearly appalling and people just waiting for fury v aj
Let's go AJ!
Completely choreographed beef (as always). Joshua cues with an embarrassed smile at 1.04 with 'Are you ready?' to Pulev and off we go with the pre-prepared piss poor slanging match. Boxing is a pantomime these days. Not a very good one.
What’s wrong with him😂
Two sarnies short of a picnic this lad.
Pulev ain’t doin shit
What a load of bollocks Pulev wins an Oscar ..
Aj will knock you out in round 4 easy you only fighting for the money
Pulev is absolutely hilarious 😂
pulev is drunk af lmbo
Embarrassing
Lip readers aren’t needed for this we need only the best here to read what they saying in the masks
The way AJ flipped his eyes when he's saw the camera Fake guy
4:58 im not mad im just disappointed
I reckon there’s maybe about 75-85% chance that AJ will win definitely. I hope he does tho, puts my Bulgarian mate to shame😂tbf as long as it’s fair that’s all that matters, at the end of the match it is what it is but it’s gonna be hard getting over a loss which costed ur championship
If Pulev really wants to win he shouldn’t have came at AJ like this really, he should just kept his mouth shut and played humble until that bell rings and then surprise the world just like Ruiz did, now AJ is gonna be running around like a chicken and eventually win it with points as the score cards will never go in the favour of Pulev, boxing is too corrupt especially when it comes to British boxers, so Pulev have to knock AJ out to win it and with the way he’s coming at AJ now with all this trash-talking he’s making it hard for himself to knock AJ out when he’s running around 🐓
Why is AJ so easily offended up there. ‘Your attitude is dreadful.’ Shut up you bore.
He’s having a laugh I think the vodka is kicking in
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was worried but that stare at the end from AJ confirmed he’s rite up for this 👍👍🇬🇧
Na always said it... be nice to aj n you got a chance... take him to that street level ... make it a dog fight n he changes... cant take the dog out of a man thats just in him
Either Aj is going to wake up and roar like a Lion and Shake Pule's soul on film or this is going to be one of his defining moments come on bro prove you were never a paper champ 😆
Pulev is definitely going to get a very good ass whooping tomorrow
Pulev knows he's lost already. That's why he's losing his shit.
So, tomorrow?
Aj, knock out Pulev
Pulev has that crazed look. Could be an interesting evening if AJ gets dragged into a brawl.
Диалогът който водеха Пулев и Джошуа много ми напомня на този на Конър и Хабиб..
AJ is in mean shape he is going for war not a fencing match
5.05 I laugh for 3 or 4 hours and I push the replay button 10000000 times 😂😂😂😂 so so funny hahaha auuuuuuuuuuu auuuuuuuuuuu pulev is so funny hahah
Class beats PULEV, unfortunately
Finally a heavyweight fight with no circus...both men respectful...yet,each chiming in with a touch of s*** talk as I have nothing but anticipation for a great fight
Interviewer: So tell me about yourself Pulev: I'M AMAZING! I'M AMAZING
Aj gun fingers: Humble yuh bloodclaaarttt self 🤣 Pulev: IM AMAZING! I like you 😂
Pulev knows Joshua is week minded and easily rattled..fury will have him beat before they enter the ring 100%
Aj dont look too sure.........
"im amazing" never beat anyone🤷‍♂️
Pulev looks a lot older than 39.
Just fight fury u pussy
At the end he was killing him with kindness 👌🏼
Pulev's going down & I don't think he's come to terms with it from watching this lol
Loudest man in the room is usually the weakest
This was a good exchange no real disrespect from what you can hear just fired up
Pulev's beta
aj is back and i love it
Anthony "humble yourself" Joshua
Joshua is a dirty racist and shouldn't be fighting for England
This guy kept falling like chicken when he fought Klitschko. He will be smashed. Go AJ.
Pulev is like an alcoholic stupid guy
Totally staged
The Bulgarian trying to intimidate the Lagos geezer!!!
See Kugan thats how you do it straight in  No debt advert 😂
Ама нашият човек май пръв почна с предизвикателствата ! Издава нервност .Все пак ,който се смее последен ,се смее най-добре и дано утре това да сме ние .
Trying to hype the fight Pulev I understand over the years the tactics of trying to hype a fight, but tomorrow he's getting baptised by the champ.
Aj definitely tryna sell the fight.
It seems tomorrow he'll show him...
It’s all love.  They are both pumped up and rightfully so, they gonna punch themselves as hard as they can.  Culturally as a Bulgarian I can see Kubrat genuinely like AJ and I am pretty sure he will invite him to BG for a proper night out to celebrate the event regardless of the outcome.  As a sports fan, I am hoping for a boxing exhibition without any long term injuries.  May the better fighter win !!
"I AM AMAZING RAAAAAWR" 4:38
Both fighters down in round 1- AJ in round 2
when is the match?
Joshua intimidated
5:20 'Your shoulder good?' that was better than any of 'I SHOW YOU'
5:00  Man pulev is like drunk or what lol
None of them had wit and so the face off was very awkward 😂
THE LANDLORD!
HaHa I freaking love it !!!!! Joshua is a class act. Love how he keeps his cool & says many people talk & say they going to beat him & get knocked out. HaHa GO JOSHUA !!!!!
Nervous energy from Pulev ? He looks skinnier and flabbier either age has got him or he’s not conditioned enough
He’s got nothing to say and he’s saying it to loud
На това му се казва :,, Не се карайте ,бийте се !''
AJ looking scared.
Can see Joshua smashing him to pieces tbh
Hope aj goes for the kill
Never seen pulev act like that.. now he's going to look stupid. AJ knockout
NO TRYING, TOMORROW I SHOW YOU. I'M AMAZING 👏
Nobody:  PULEV: *Tumorou ai shou iuu*
He asked if that Shoulder is ok  so there's no excuses when he loses lol very smart.
Smash him aj
This will be the shortest fight ending within 3 rounds in AJ's favour.
Imagine Pulev actually shows him and KO’s Joshua 😂
Pulev bomaye
That fist bump would've broken my hand.
Male toq pulev ne e dobre
I think Pulev has the same crack dealer as miller and wilder
Pulev will win this 🇧🇬
Pulev is the new champion! 👊💪
Pulev is a knob
IM AMAZING LOLOLOLOL
AJ is lucky that Pulev didn't try and Kiss him!
They was fine all week this is just sell the ppv
Damn AJ got dat Poker Face!!!! Best of Luck PuPu.... lmaooo
Remember when Dominic brazele rocked up talking shit
AJ laughing at how bad pulev is at fake hyping a fight lol
Tomorrow he wil show Anthony Joshua his sexual assault KO combination.
Josh gonna spark him!!  2-3 rounds
Pulev roars like a kitten
Why do they wait till day before fight to start drama? Do they not wanner sell ppv
it was all abit boring until the Bulgarian went mafia hes sold it for me
The J is in the House, and all he said was 'it is my home'!
team joshua
Take the masks off sheep
Panto actors .
😁 his accent. Every word ends with V.
I want Joshua to stay focus. Don't let anything or anyone distract him.
What’s the point in wearing a mask if he pulls it down to talk in his face? 🤣 But if AJ puts this clown on his arse after all this talk I will roar with laughter
Comeing like Shannon Briggs or something Surprised you didn’t stop shouting come on Champ
I hope Joshua knocks this guy out cold 😤
Typical bulgarian man...talk and talk and talk 😁 let's see what happens tomorrow ❤
I hope joshua don't let this man get into his head. This is not like Joshua. The guy seems to b getting in Joshua head & that's a recipe for a loss by joshua.
Pulev knows he doesn’t stand a chance this is his last pay day. He’s stunk out the division for years time for retirement.
No need for chit chat shite...'bruv bollacks''...🙄
I like it when AJ’s like this and not some Philosopher
He trying to get in Joshua head
What drugs is pulve on
Your fake news
Come on Pulev, beat this racist ahole.
Yea everybody here say AJ destroy Pulev but we see perfect what's happened last fight whit döner boy 🤣 in this sport 1 mistake and you are done.🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬 ДА ЖИВЕЕ БЪЛГАРИЯ!
Would love to see AJ getting knocked out.
Title should be AJ rejecting arm wrestling match
Has pulev been tested, seriously?
Pulev acting like he’s got pissed ,took a bomb of mdma and sniffed a few lines of Charlie,he’s all over the place with emotions.
I like Kubrat OMG such a character and personality 😂 AJ is so boring...
Dave's had a few too many Stella's at the spoons
МАЧКАЙ КОБРА!!!!
5:00 AJ gave him the look of death
I think Cruddy AJ may be back 💯 . AJ that made Breazele wet himself in the pre fight interview AJ  is my favourite AJ 👑👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
Did they have the arm wrestle though 😂
Guys I think he's gonna show him something tomorrow
I guess they need a last min PPV sales boost.
Looks like Anthony as come off the steroids, being big and muscular doesn't win you fights, i think he's learning that. He runs out of energy too quick in fights, gassed out.
I can see it in both there eyes there both scared of each other pulev is more scared he knows he's 40 years old ffs and this fight is, shit or bust" last chance saloon he's got to do the business. This gonna be a great fight I felt that emotion and fear they were both feeling
Anthony “see you tomorrow” Joshua
That Bulgarian is getting busted up big time .
I AM AMAZING 😂😂😂😂😂
Hope Aj cleans him in 3 rounds
Има ли българи уее? Кобрата утре ще го разкатае!
Where is social distancing 6 Ft ???
As a bulgarian I can say that i'm ashamed from Pulev's attitude.
No more drugs for that man!
Hahahaha  could this be staged anymore!?🤦🏽‍♂️
Meh.
Pulev enjoying his last 5 minutes of fame before he rides off into the sunset. Fair play to him but he wont last 5 rounds
David price would beat Pulev.....his highlight reel is embarrassing.....if it goes more than 3 rounds, AJ should be embarrassed....
"Yes! Arm wrestle!" 😅🤣 Fucking hell, mate!!
Pulev is a mad man. I'm expecting seeing a when trash talking goes wrong
Aj got hurt by that second fist pump thats why he pulled away 3.43.pulev bones must be harder . They both realised lol
ANTONY CAN FIGHT ONLY IN UK |
Pulev,"Let's go arm wrestle".What the?Pulev is nervous........
Humble yourself ..  AJ is such a cock, its unbelievable
The way AJ is taking off his clothes is doing something to me!🥵🥵
Pulev's a crack up 🤣 Gonna be a solid fight! Aj gonna k.o Pulev though unfortunately though and will show all the doubters once again why he's champ. Aj's mindest is just different 💯
Pulev making it worse for himself lol
There is no animosity here. Its just business
Pulev behaves like the last fool.
It’s a 15/16 minute fight. It’ll end before the end of round 6: Joshua by K.O
What's this puluvs fcking problem, AJ destroy this mouthy fool!!
Pulev is on coke.
Everyone’s on this arm wrestling ting, big up brzenk
Why aren't people talking about this fight???!
Smash him up AJ
I wished Joshua had some of Pulevs personality! Joshua is a great boxer but he is so boring as a person 😒😒
Kubrat is thinking  :  this is another  fight in the disco club  !  Joshua  : Yeah ,  keep thinking that way   !  :))
Arm wrestle Lol 😂😂
Let.. show time
Pulev is whistling in the graveyard
Pulev knows like 2 words in english, yet he still got AJ SHOOk!!!!!
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeet I like Pulev
How tall is anthony joshua this pulev guy is not even close to 6ft4
Don't know why AJ is acting like some kind of moral regulator, let Pulev act how he wants and KO him in the ring
Yawn
What ever you do don't let Pulev hold them belts
I'm not even gonna lie, my fist would've gone numb for a minute after fists collided like that lol
Love this 😂😂 intriguing fight for sure 🥊🔥
Reminds me Rocky 4
Yo if this guy just bullied AJ “ TOMORROW I SHOW YOU!” 😂😂 AJ pussy’d out and walked out of the stage first. That’s a sign of nerves, but may the best man win.
I respect you but tomorrow I will show you...I like you but tomorrow I show you...show what? The gift I got for you from Bulgaria
AJ looks triggered he needs to focus Pulev is a dangerous fighter
Mismatch.
Let me tell you something pulev is nervous and I think he's more happy for the pot of gold he's getting after the fight!! 😁
Puley is full of shit   ..Anthony Joshua all the way
I think Joshua's head will go when Fury gets in his face. His metal warfare is on a different level. AJ has a pattern of hating being spoken to disrespectfully, and Fury will do it in abundance.
One strong right hand to the face of Joshua and he is going to see birds flying everywhere. Bet money on Kubrat no mercy for bullshits this time.
Loudest are always the most afraid. AJ IN 7
The skinny bodybuilder
Joshua at peace no drama in his corner dig love
AJ will put him to sleep in 1.
Joshua is a Don
Why are there no mics in close or subtitles? UFC wouldn't have rubbish like this
Pulev rocking the Babic style. You can’t spell pulverised without Pulev. AJ wins job done walk away
Bulgarian roids for humans are the same they use for horses
Pulev is a real character 🤣
They'll be hugging each other after the fight.
5:05 Made my day...even kubrat himself hast to laught
Can’t wait for this fight! Surprisingly good build up. Always interesting when people bring out the angry AJ
Aj is physically strong but mental very emotional, he takes criticism very personal and he comes across like he is demanding "respect"and when he doesn't get it he get pixxed.  Your opponent will be vocal as they wantr to sell the fight bro. Chill and stay humble as you always say!
Pulev is afraid
Ppv sales must be down
Joshua lucky he’s fighting a old bum and not Tyson.
The reason why AJ said your shoulder is good? It goes back to 2017 when they were supposed to fight but Pulev “injured” his shoulder in sparring
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF PULEV IS DRUNK OR HANGOVER FROM LAST NIGHT
Fury is the fighting pride and a champion of the people
3:40 That fist bump made a hell of a contact.
i think pulevs had a few drinks lol
Kubrat is making it fun it's always funny when the mouthy guy gets knocked the f out, then your hear what they have to say i can't wait, but to be fair Cobra is a good boxer i hope he has the same energy in the ring don't wont him injuring his shoulder throwing all those air punches.
Usyk
Pulev talking too much and won't have enough to back it up, AJ inside 6 rounds for me
That’s epic . Loved it
Aj will destroy him after all of that
I smell a Nate Robinson Ko coming to Pulev lol. 😂😂😂
AJ round 8
All pre planed
Careful aj he might kiss without permission haha 😆 nervous talking to much
AJ lost a lot of muscles. Strange  Steroids
Joshua wouldn’t have been able to handle wilder in that situation I don’t think
This fight is FACT
I am amazingggggg
SPUD !
I hope AJ smashes him
So funny is Joshua he got his head punched  in by little fat fellow 5ft 10 inch tall little fellow like a little egg
You robbing bastards charging 25 quid to watch this mismatch
Hes trying to raddle him.
AJ. - "Your shoulder is good?" KB. - "Great" AJ. - "For sure?"
5:05 cracked me up so much 🤣🤣  Kuta (Dog)
I quite like pulev hes got a bit of personality but hes getting smashed .
Cringe
They know how to sell a fight. I wasn’t gonna to buy it until I saw that Pulev needs chinning!
PPV sales not going well then
I enjoyed that tbh! 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Well it's a better build up than dubois v joyce that's for shure..
Poor Pulev. He is going to get smashed and outboxed. Dont piss off the giant.
Roadman Joshua! This is the Joshua we want to see! Yes!!!!! 👊🏾
Some clash that
So pulev got a shoulder injury 👀👀👀
Rd knockout AJ
Anthony joshua there like what's this guy doing?😂😂😂
Pulev playing the mad man role 😂
Pulev is acting like someone pumped with roids!!!
Humble yourself......humble yourself
If aj takes another loss his career is over....but i see him knocking pulev out
Pulev is such a shit boxer he’ll be ko’d within 6
The Cobra asking for a good shoeing.
Seriously what's pulev been smoking? The guys like 0 fucks given lol 😂 tomorrow's fight is either going to be really good or an absolute stinker.
This guys ego needs to be flattened
Pulev is getting knocked out EARLY, I hear his wearing a giant nappy right now and is currently keeping the toilet paper by his bedside
“ I will see you tomorrow.... your shoulder is good?” 😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣
Pulev is amazing 😉
Where’s kugan with his camera here 🤣
Just wanna see AJ hurts him badly
AJ lookin good
