Out of curiosity, is it common for male idols to wax and bleach their armpits? I was just thinking about how non of them have any trace of hair or shadow on their armpits. Maybe they do laser hair removal?

the devil said
amo esta presentación
✝🧡❤Matthew 10: 38, 39. Whoever does not take up his cross,✝ and follow after me, is not worthy of me.😮💨😓 Whoever finds his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Jesus is speaking in this word that those who prefer the things of the world, sin, entertainment and reject him, are not worthy of him. Taking up the cross and following Jesus means crucifying oneself to worldly things. People on the contrary are wanting to find their lives in this world, they don't want to lose their lives to follow it, they don't want to lose fun, sinful pleasures, lust, fame, etc., etc. Many think they can live a little longer, when they are old, they accept Jesus. We move to the other side when we least expect it, we often don't have time to do that. You will be lost and in torment afterwards.🤮😩🤮 Don't delay, he calls you. Hugs!💋💝💜
Rakta I hate your styling please quit your job
Also Yeonjun surprised me so much with his singing tone cause I always thought that he was the main rapper of the group and in no way a rapper can be as good as a main vocalist.
Have never in my life heard this stable and honey dripping live vocals .
I hope...... they grow up soon 🙂 all their face, voice, song, dance is perfect.. just their body, can't wait to see their grow up version 😘 and it needs time..
완벽하다 ㄷㄷ
gimme gimme moreeee
Maravilloso 🍀🙌

I’m so afraid of watching every new styling for suger rush ride…they all look bad
I’ve been waiting for their comeback for almost nine months and dear bighit that’s all your efforts for their styling? Their styling look horrible
No matter how many times I watch this video, their outfits still looking terrible
Please quit your job bighit stylist rakta, these outfits are terrible
I hate this outfits a lot and I hate rakta styling recent days
Poor styling

Me preguntó cuánto tiempo promocionaran el álbum?
GENTEEEE O TERRY AMOR DA MINHA VIDAAAA
yeonjun's moves are so 😩😩
好きすぎる💗
2:07, this is the moment when Taehyun's in-ear monitor snapped cause of Beomgyu's leg.   Can we all collectively agree how amazing Taehyun is for not even flinching when he couldn't hear himself anymore after this? In-ear monitors lets them hear themselves and the music over outside noises and fan chants. So he basically continued to perform blindly from this point and he didn't miss a beat. His eyes didn't even change the slightest beat when the cord snapped.
they are so cool I admire them
First time in a long time I’ve wanted to be a part of a boy group — maybe 2023 really is their year !!
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Yeojun (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠)
Slayed, but where is hyukas ending fairyyyyyyy 😭
Intercalen junto con el MV Y inkigayo más ahí porque nos sobrepasan por 400k de vistas en srr y dbtw

Que hermosos y talentosos son
HOW can they come with BETTER AND BETTER album. When i first saw the concept photos i said this is going to be my fav txt album but after listen sugar rush ride, I don't know i felt a little bit dissapoint cuz i was expecting songs like nap of a star, fairy of shampoo, maze in the mirror. But after listening the whole album i said bro txt never dissapoints. Like HOOOWW they literally havent got any bad songs HOOOWW. I am not a moa and i dont like kpop too much i am just listening to 5 group and txt is one of them. They are really talented and deserve more and more. They got all my respect. I wish this gonna be good era for them and all of their fans
Stunning men and song

If it was a girl group lip synching like them, it would be slammed on Korean social media and even be in the newspaper. But since it's not a girl group, that's fine.
Absolute garbage 🗑
I can’t wait to hear the live version of farewell , neverland. It’s my fav song from the name chapter : temptation . The boys really let their vocals shine in that song. You could feel their personalities each coming together to create a masterpiece. Love TXT!!
GIMME MORRREE

LMFAOOOO GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Dancing as a whole to this song is difficult! They never miss out on cohesiveness and that's what makes their performances so enjoyable
BEOMGYUS face at 2:10 after he accidentally broke Taehyuns in-ear is so hilarious. TXT did an amazing job today as well, so talented.
1.2M!!!!
Amazing TXT!
this comeback goes so hard.. As a day one MOA all I can do is smile :,)
txt didn't disappoint.

Haven't watched a TXT stage since their debut. They're so amazing PLEASE. The glitter arms?? 😮‍💨😮‍💨
1:20 = Kai is YEETING Yeonjun so hard that he has to adjust his earpiece 😭😭😭  2:06 =Beomgyu’s foot gets stuck because one of Taehyun’s cables (?) is sticking out 😭😭😭  I read these in Twitter and I had to come back and see it myself 😂😂😂
i’m in love with this comeback
THE OUTFITS
Kai shined this era the most, coming from a non-moa
Where are the COMMERCIALS? blow pops music.  Rite on.
OK BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO TO LOOK AT EVERYONE IS SHINING- BUT I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF SOOBIN OMG HE SHINES SO BRIGHT HIS VOCALS-  hi im dead??!
AHHHHH THEY KILLED IT!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥

200K LIKES MOA GO
IM SO OBSESSED, WITH BOTH SONG AND CHOREO AND PERFFORMANCE
bias who
Yeonjun is the death of me!!
Yeonjunnnnnnnnnn omg!!
These guys excel in their performances, I'm impressed how each member can be the main visual, the main vocal, the main dancer (although Yeonjun really stands out in this regard)... you can't have a bias here, everyone is perfect!  Another thing, is it just me or has Hueningkai grown?  He's almost Soobin's height... It's been a while since I've been able to keep up with the group's news, what's their current height?
hueningkai so cool!!!!!
yeonjun ateee omg
👉🏻👈🏻🤣
I was looking for this after taehyun's post 2:04

taehyun voice kills me especially the last line
SOOBIN'S HAIR has a fairy like vibe
Excelente voz, excelente coreografía, chicos increíbles ❤🎶❤
the choreography is insanely cool
TXT's discography is a chef's kiss! We keep getting newer and newer concepts plus it is not boring. All of it are diverse and very interesting.
Taehyun looks SO good it's inSANE
the stage is so pretty omg
BEST COMEBACK PERFORMANCE!
TXT sleeveless era
ME MIE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Love the comeback stage ❤
Makin makin cinta gua
This is...insane. I just watched a live stage from another group I like, and I could hear them straining, and kind of struggling to keep singing with the choreo. No one really expects idols to sound pristine clear when they're freakin' flying on stage, but the fact that TXT regularly sounds like THIS when they're live is pretty amazing. I am super proud of them, keep on fighting and growing my boys!
LET’S GIVE THEM OUR ALL TOO MOAS!! KEEP STREAMING THE MV TO GIVE THEM A WIN‼️‼️‼️‼️
WOW.... JUST WOW🔥
YOU GUYS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL I’M CRYING😭😭😭😭
GIMME GIMME MORE👉👈

Omg the body glitter!!! I’m having 2002 college frat party flashbacks 🤣🤣🤣. Why did we wear so much body glitter? 🤦🏻‍♀️ The boys pull it off well. This song is amazing, wonderfully arranged. And I like the choreography way more than I thought. In the MV it wasn’t as exciting as it is. So much floor work!!! Love it, so impressed!!! As always lol.
美貌がすごい…
Me acabo de dar cuenta que por fin pudimos tener una presentación con buen trabajo de cámara KFKSJDKS
SIEMPRE MOA, NUNCA INMOA.

Sexy and refreshing indeeed
TXT siempre nos da presentasiones increibles!!
1:18
es que txt...
Las expresiones, la puesta en escena. El vestuario, la coreografia. Todo es tan perfecto, lloro brillitos
Esta presentación esta en tendencias en Perú
Taehyun realmente nos asegura que esta cantando en vivo en cada una de sus presentaciones.
I Can Tell That I Didn't  Chose the wrong Group   I am So Happy For Them whatever They Do They Succeed   And Every Kpop Is super talented
Amo la coreagrafía
TxT como siempre deslumbrante. ❤
Give me give me moreee
fire
No offense, I am also a MOA. But I just can't stop recognizing some similarities of tone/sound like from Christmas Evil by Stray Kids. However, TxT has so much more. Hence, both group bring different kinds of taste, music, moves as well as personalities and so on. So, keep on shinning.
me encantaaaa!!!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS!!!!
My routine right now is I will stream their mv and then watch their performance here in kbs and then go back to streaming ><
Stream this as a filler
0:59 es tan grandote y cautivador (voz+movimiento); 1:14 chico de la esquina izquierda, ese movimiento de manos fue tan bueno y buena interpretación, el giro en sus manos fue completo como el chico rubio tmb, me encantó; 1:17 fui timida por el movimiento de manos ; 1:31 👉👈; 1:37 que voz tan seductora; 2:04 es broma? que voz tan única, peculiar y encantadora, amoooo; 2:50 cuando entra, me encantó; 2:55 amo el movimiento del rubio; 3:11 esa voz profunda me mató; 3:15 me encanta esta parte de la coreografía y es fascinante la manera de cómo se mueven desde que voltea el chico del centro, 3:27 ese chico es tan ágil, sus expresiones fueron naturales y conquistadoras. Estoy impresionada, todos son tan talentosos. Vi su mv en tendencias y ahora estoy aquí dando mi opinión de lo que me llamó la atención, hay diferentes colores de voz, creí que me aburriría pero no, son tan buenos.
Their VOICE shining in this comeback
PERFEITOSSSSSSSSS

Wow unbelievable.  I want to say a very big thanks and appreciation to Dr Will spell caster for bringing back my LOVER who left me and my two kids for five month within the space of 12hrs after following all the instructions he gave to me.

Refreshing and sexy concept indeed
unbleached hair yeonjun causing the collapse of all moas who prayed cried and screamed for his hair health  ((and although i miss the good boy gone bad era, they blended the _all black gonna take your soul_ fits with the popsicle dreamland scenario?!???!?? and i’m in tears?!???!???))
Will never get over this
I would literally cut out my own liver and hand it over if they asked me to do it like this
every good song love it
The only five men I value in my life

HOW ARE THEY EVEN REAL ??? TXT IS EVERYTHING!!!
I love how they explore every concept and don't just explore but Outperform THEMSELVES AND THE CONCEPT EVERY TIME  ITS AMAZING and this song. I cant even start on what catchy song it is.
¡AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
They look like they got out straight from a fantasy world
These K pop singers are very feminine they could pass for girls.
수빈의 보컬은 절대적으로 인상적이다!!!!
TXT!!!!
ダンス美しい
Right now my head.........,  "Gimme gimme moreee......"  " Sugar rush rush sugar rush rush... "🥵
TXT의 'Sugar Rush Ride'은 인증된 뱅거로 올 해 가장 신선한 컴백 중 하나이다. 이 잼은 🔥이고, 복스는 🤯이며, 모든 5명의 멤버들은 🤩처럼 들린다. 뮤비는 밝고 빛나는 컬러로 🤩 감각이 좋으며 모든 멤버가 자기의 각기 독특한 재능을 빛내는 것을 볼 수 있고, 그룹의 🤩 케미션이 돋보이는 것을 볼 수 있다. 각 바는 모두 🤯 이고 그들의 음성에는 그만한 에너지가 넘쳐나기 때문에 감탄하기가 어렵다. 이 노래는 꼭 들어보고, 분명하게 영원한 명반이 될 것이다.
TAN GUAPOSSS
MY SUGAR RUSHHHH
TXT's 'Sugar Rush Ride' is a certified banger and easily one of the freshest comebacks of the year. The jam is 🔥, the vox are 🤯, and all 5 members sound 🤩. The MV is 🤩 with its bright colors and each member killin' it. It highlights each of their unique talents and the group's 🤩 chemistry. Every bar is so 🤯 and they deliver their lines with such energy, you can't help but get lost in it. This song is a must-listen and will be a timeless classic for sure!
txt gets better with every comeback, the definition of growth and improvement

I can definitely see why Yeonjin is the main dancer and the ("it boy for the the 4th gen) his stage presence, vocal, and dance is just amazing.) He should be so proud of himself. And of course they all ate
Where's Hueningkai fairy ending? He wasnt focused at the end like the other members, TXT is 5 not 4.

Taehyun center 😭😭
TXT cada vez mais mostrando que é um dos melhores dessa geração, que coreografia, que música, e que vocais!
Vocal and Visual ang killing this comeback😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 chukhae my babies💚💚💚💚💚💚
TXT literally never dissapoints
EVEN THE WORD BEAUTIFUL CAN'T DESCRIBE BEOMGYU, BEOMGYU YOU EAT THIS CONCEPT <3
ENOUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I'm going to cry
btw moas the pre vonting on mcountdown started go vote
yeonjun is so handsome 😞
OKAY CONTROVERSIAL OPINION BUT: it’s really hard to outperform our queen Yeonjun but goddamnit BABY BEOMGYU UNDENIABLY DID AT 2:44 LIKE I CANT GET OVER IT.
txt just really showed how diverse and versatile they are with their concepts with this. also i love the feminine energy to this cb
Haters: TxT use lypsinc  Meanwile TXT: proves our mics are on
i love them
TXT STAY ICONIIIIIC😊
The coming back of the band is great above and beyond, the guys are real stars! The sound is stunning and Taehyun's voice is incredible (Our ears and souls are in ecstasy 🤤🔥)  But Beomgyu's state of health is something that should be taken into account, has he really been given a medical checkup and received treatment??? He looked really exhausted at the end of the performance! The company should take care of Beomgyu's health and stop neglecting his health issues! Please, give him specialized help, we want to see a happy and healthy Beomgyu! It's better for him to rest and recover completely than to continue getting sick and fainting!
Grabe ang ga gwapo !!!
he literally went 👉👈
Kai's ending fairy??
GAHHHH
SOOBIN TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

2:28 SOOBINS DUMPINATOR 3000 GAH DAYUM
Blonde Soobin is the cause of my downfall
this is just fanservice at this point, I feel so spoiled 😍
AGÁRRENSE QUE TXT VIENE A ARRASAR CON TODO ESTE AÑO
I need to learn the fanchant
IT'S BLUE HOUR WENT THROUGH PUBERTY AND GOT HOT.
TXT best song ever of their comeback 🎉🎊🥳💯🤩😎💯⭐🌟✨
BEOMGYU IN THIS COMEBACK 😭
Is magic, amazing
Preciosas💋💋💋
I like how they atlest try to sings live unlike some 4th gen group that just lipsync and not even trying
Sugar Rush Ride is really the song of the year! It’s so addicting 😭
Too Bad TXT are the Goddess of Beauties and Talent in all KPOP Male Artists but the Song selection SUCKS. I stan for TXT but the Music Director should have selected better catchy Music and the lyrics should have a better meaning that can capture everyone's heart. Is BIGHIT losing its touch???? I dont find the song attractive or something that you want to listen the whole day. I would rather mute the music and watch TXT perform without the Music. Sorry, the music [not the vocals] sucks.
Txt > Bts > enyhen > stayc > twice > stray kids > yena > I’ve > cix > itzy
Soobin
Bisikan 'hah' nya bikin salfok
La rompieron
나는 그들을 사랑

Their vocals are crazy but special mention to Soobin's falsetto 😶😶and  Taehyun  I mean TxT keeps on amazing a person the more & more but seriously Soobin & Taehyun's crystal clear vocals   And Beomgyu's 😶 "Gimme Gimme more" literally felt like Devil himself has come to perform Also Yeonjun's  "geobuhal suga eopseo Dalkomhan geu devilish smile" part  & Kai's parts ... Specially in chorus & refrain ..  Once you start typing I don't think you will be satisfied no matter how much you type (☆▽☆) Eventually each part is amazing..┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) Literally can't wait for more ┻━┻︵└(՞▽՞ └)(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*.✧

Very sexy performance
Slow Rabbit PDnim: TAEHYUN’s great at conveying emotion. There’s something about his voice that makes it soft but disarming, and I think hearing that all throughout the song helps it sound even more like a TOMORROW X TOGETHER song  HE WAS BORN TO BE A STAR!!
yesss music bank soobin as thumbnail 😌

연준이 섹시해요...!!💗
My gosh.... This was so beautiful. Txt you vocals are crazy I love it ❤❤🤗🤗🥳🥳
bisa gilak gue lama" denger ni lagu plizzz cry aje gue
I'm... speechless the song was amazing but the choreo was on another level and the falsettos??? they did have backing vocals (or they might have lip synced idk) but it's still impressive especially when yeonjun was lying on the member's legs (I'm surprised he was stable enough to do a falsetto) also before anyone comes at me, I'm a huge moa and I rlly like the band so I'm not accusing them of lipsyncing. its just that their vocals seem so perfect that i can't imagine how these must be raw singing I dont mean to offend them or accuse them it's just my brain in disbelief 😭😭
you want closure with tubatu? I suggest moa watch this.
1:10 THIS CHOREO
THE MAKEUP ARTIST NEEDS A RAISE CUZ THE BLUSH? ITS GORGEOUS
Their vocals really are top tier!
เริ่ดมาก😭😭🤍🤍🤍
ooooooooo😭😭😭😭😭😭

I'm sure txt will produce their own genre one day.
I just can't... it's just tooo gooooooddddddd
Wow
La coreografía , full increible . Esos movimientos tan perfectos y atractivos..   Felicidad!!!!
something i’ve always admired about txt is that their mics are always on and they CONSISTENTLY prove it in every performance, especially ones with fast paced or intricate choreography- for example, yeonjun is literally suspended across his member’s knees at 1:15 yet his singing is so stable, and taehyun is getting dragged across the floor at 2:29 but always sings as though rent is due, all five members did an AMAZING job, this comeback is incredible and this is such an electric way to kick it off <3
the stage is so beautiful!!
THE CHOREO AND VOCALLL
Me encanta la coreografía aunque sé que está muy difícil jasj bueno esto es algo que solo txt haría y estoy feliz de que sea increíble! 💗

Cantik banget astagaaa
Keren bgtt
I LOVE THEIR SONG AND THE CHOREOGRAPHY IS SO 😩😩😩
pogi mo taehyun saur much!!!
AMAZING COREOGRAPHY!!
No one understood, right?  Inside there are parts of other songs and choreographies, with which TXT show what the k-pop industry is for them - an illusory dream! Neverland (the k-pop industry) keeps you nameless, but in the wonderful illusion that you are an "idol"! The reality is different!  Well done! Ingenious! TXT created a masterpiece for me!
I addicted to "sugar rush ride"
Another Beomgyu's deep voice. Love it!
I love you all ❤❤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This perf is insane
KEREN BANGET KALIAN!!

This is so ethereal
txt never disappoints! their visuals, choreography, their songs are always on point, and were meant to be performed by them! 🥺
Without a doubt their best song! Even the dance is so iconic!!

HOLLLY GAWD
i hope their outfit stylist stage be more creative huhu . yes its good look them with revealing fits like this but its remind me of their past comeback outfits so its not look that special T-T
가사를 보니까.. 나 다이어트 할적에 혈당 떨어져서 ㅈㄴ 예민한데 던킨이나 빠바지나갈때 초코크로와상이나 도넛들이 외치는 노래같다.... 흑흑흑 가사는 공감되는데 투밧투가 너무 날씬해서.... 늬들에게 동질감을 느낄수는 없겠엉....흑흑 노래는 좋다요.
this choreo is so hot
JESUSSSSSSS NO PUEDO PROCESAR TODO ESTO AJJAAJA
ㅠㅠ my loving txt 컴백 활동에 밥먹고 쉬고 챙기는거 잊지말고 모아가 자랑스러워요.  고마워요, 지금 정말 필요했어요.

LA COREOGRAFÍA ES LO MASSSS
I think out of all their title track performances, Sugar Rush Ride is the toughest. There are a lot of details, not only in the steps but the facial expressions too. txt did so well expressing the theme, they are insane for pulling this off.  *TXT BEST PERFORMERS & THEY PROVE IT EVERY SINGLE TIME*
TXT is the most beautiful group I have ever seen

They're just amazing, shining day by day... just when I thought their performance expression couldn't be better, they top it off with newer stages - how does it get clearer? TXT, you're all doing great! And we love being here, seeing it all 🥺🤧💗
I always love txt's concepts, i think their concepts are unique and really stands out among other idol groups'. I thought the song would be just any other typical dark sexy songs, but it's not! It's actually refreshing and youthful. I think the album, the songs, and just everything about it is so well-planned. Good job for txt and the team. This comeback makes me so excited, love you our tubatu! 💗
