He was a very cool player, had to come back to see this again… reminds me of Kalen Balladge’s big game for ASU
This guys good
Literally my favorite football game of all time
01:48 Says everything. Go Blue.
What a game from this man.
Awaiting the rematch Go Buckeye’s ya going down Nov 2022
This game was too lit
Still puts a tear in my eye
He broke Al Bundy's record.
TENNESSEE TITAN LFG
The last TD it looked like the suckeyes gave up... I loved it, waited a very long time for a win
Still come back to this once every week
Let's  go utah
Let's  utah
This was amazing
Thank U of M football Team. This is the best Christmas present that I have got in years.
That was a Whooping. Michigan put the hurt on osu that game and made them cry uncle
Poetic. Always will be the greatest rivalry in sports, in victory and defeat(even though that has stung the last 8 seasons)
I see no reason why people keep fluctuating financially. Being rich has it principle, no one is ready to Invest there money in irrelevant firms. I earn even in pandemic period. You don't have to grow old before making investment. Even as a student you can earn weekly in crypto trading. The world today is advancing  no one is ready to suffer, but want more stream of income..I'll advice those who are really serious to look for a good broker and invest with..
OSU straight got murdered lmao! I'm not a Michigan fan, but WOW!! The Buckeye's played the embarrassment card. Totally outplayed and humiliated. Haskins now owns OSU. 5 TD's and so many yards that Buckeye fan's will never forget the man's name.
Azz woopin
It is ridiculous to say that Haskins was the star of the game here. The line for Michigan was the star! The holes the line gave him were big enough to drive a truck through. Almost any running back in the country could have made those runs.
Man if OSU truly did "let haskins score" on that 5th TD, that was f**kin dumb lol. Kinda feels like Ryan Day outsmarted himself on that one. That was a massive MO move to score on that drive -especially  in such a dominant way with a dominant back
I watched the game as a complete novice on German TV, not knowing anything about the rivalry. The commentators said it was just known as THE GAME so that should've told me it was more than just a normal match. I just watched the game, not supporting either team. It certainly got me interested in college football. The crowd were amazing, the game exciting and the best team won on the day! Congrats M and good luck in the play offs.  We only get one game  a week here on TV so I'm looking forward to  Baylor Oklahoma this evening.  I don't know anything about the teams, who's favourite but hope it to be an exciting hard fought game.  This game was certainly a credit to college football. I hope the guy who got 5 touchdowns has a promising future in the NFL Greetings from Hannover Germany
GO BLUE!
My grandad passed away this year he was the biggest blue fan their was I believe he was up there talking to the football gods pleading with them 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Haven’t been keeping up. Is Michigan even in the same league as a team like Georgia?
hiesman conversaition for hutchison
eureka represent
Boooooooo
GO! BLUE! AND YELLOW GET THEM AIDEN GO 97 AND EVERYONE ELSE
Gotta admit 18 outta 20....9 straight ain't bad...giggles!!
So grateful to see Michigan absolutely pound Ohio
"The" Ohio State fans are SO obnoxious I couldn't help but smile at this one.
As great as it gets
Hawkeye fan here. What ya'll think are chances are in Big Ten Champ. Game?
I’m here to sip the Kool-Aid 〽️Hail!!
Good video
Congrats to Michigan, he was absolutely a warhorse.  Dominating performance on both sides of the ball.
Number 26 of Ohio had Michigan nuts on his helmet during that hurdle and no, I'm not talking about Buckeye nuts 😳
FINALLY! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Its been so long!
Haskins would've won the heisman if we didn't have Corum but our team wouldn't have it any other way. "The Team, THE TEAM, THE TEAM!" its all about the team playing as one unit and Michigan is the most complete team all around in the country. Georgia has a nice D but that offense is suss
What happened to Ohio State?
So happy for michigan cant stand ohio state
Hail Yeah.
As a general football fan, I’m just happy this is a real rivalry again.
He really deserves Heisman. He scored 5 touchdowns against Ohio State and Kenneth Walker didn’t score any against them END OF DISCUSSION
I live and grew up about 8 mins from Ann Arbor and that was the best day of my life... Second is when my son was born 😁 Go Blue!!!
Check out the blocking by Erick All #83 in a couple of these TDs.  Definitely a factor.  With 2:17 remaining in Q4, Haskins simply jogs into the end zone.  Major props for Michigan's OL.  And none of this is to take anything away from Haskins' skills - the guy is fantastic.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
What an incredible announcer
Anyone that still follows and takes any of this Sports thing seriously you're utterly worthless in lying to yourself look at the world and you want to put your time and effort into sports
One of the best games I have watched
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Hail 🙌🏽
One of the best games I have watched
I’m so glad Michigan finally beat OSU. Good to see the Buckeyes lose when it matters most.
OVERRATED, tired or OSU getting the vote after riding off the coattails of Meyer. Their defense is a joke and they should be glad Michigan did them a favor saving them from an embarrassment at a CFP appearance.
Losing to State then watching State get stomped by OSU... Glad it turned out this way.
JT Jr?!
Hope we could maybe win the national
Let'S GO
He related to the scrub dwayne?
“Congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment”
Bought my bf and I tickets for this game, what a game it was to see! Couldn’t have been more perfect
All good we’ll be better next year anyways finally getting over the poor last couple years of Urbans defensive recruits. Go bucks!
as an a&m fan that hates everything about ohio state id just like to say go blue
I'm from New Jersey but I've been a big Michigan fan since I was a little kid in the 90s when I started playing ice hockey. That game and win was great! Loved the energy from the team and the crowd. If they continue to play like that I don't see anyone beating them accept Georgia but Michigan still has a shot.
For all the Ohio state fans I like to tell you the older brother must let their little brother win every once in a while
Michigan came up BIG @ THE BIG House!!!
4 of the 5 td’s were inside goal line. What’s that, like 35 yards rushing?
I’m so happy Michigan finally beat the overrated team I prayed for this day
Big Blue ran it down Ohio States throat!!!!
Look at those last 2 TD runs.. Michigan broke their will. OSU tapped out.
GGGGGOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! MMMMMIIIIICCCCHHHHIIIIIGGGGGAAAANNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good player but the announcer hype is nauseating.
DON'T WATCH MY PROFILE 🔞🔞🔥
I haven't been this excited for Michigan since C Wood was on the team.
Friggin FINALLY  Blue wins.
full link in bio! Anything helps
83 made some good blocks
Go Blue! That was a long time coming
This is Michigan year go blue!!
It doesn't matter who they play.... if OSU loses, I'm happy. Glad to see Michigan finally drop them again.
Well Ohio State, there goes you playoff chances
Haskins will be breaking in 1st round of the draft
Congrats to Michigan, but a bigger congrats to Jim Brandstater and Dan Dierdorf. I'll miss hearing them both every Saturday. I already miss Jim enough on Sundays for the Lions games. What a game to go out on
Let's go BLUE 😊 and win it All baby!
My dad died last week and his birthday was always thanks giving and this game would always be our thing after and this is the first time we won since I was a kid I love you dad
That announcer sucks
This was the best game I have ever seen
Michigan earned that win yesterday. You could tell just by the way they entered the field that they were more excited to play than the bucks and they fed the buckeyes a harsh lesson up the center of the field the whole game. As a buckeyes fan living in Michigan, I am very much not looking forward to walking into work tomorrow. Haha. Good win, blue.
Lifetime Buckeye here. M played an outstanding game and deserved the victory. Congratulations Blue.
Michigan turned that school down south  maize and blue.
Give Harbaugh a contract extension AND a raise
I never thought this day would come, I fully expected us to lose but we did it! Let's go Blue!!
It's a game fellas with teenagers and stuff. Relax.
This has definitely been Michigan's best game this season. I was a little worried going into it but as soon as I saw how dominate they were in that first quarter I knew we stood a real good chance, and we ended up pulling it off. Go Blue!
Hassan Haskins and the Michigan Wolverines offensive line should get the Heisman Trophy and bring it back to Michigan
Hot knife.....meet butter.
We got out played & out coached. Michigan should play Georgia for a bowl maybe National title.
They was at the Big House & seemed to want It More. Maybe they should be #2
The Wolverines should be BIG 10 Champs. The Buckeyes haven't been able to stop the run. Remember Oregon ? The Wolverines seemed Bigger on the line both sides of the ball. Buckeye fan. Good Luck Michigan
Cameron Martinez from Muskegon Michigan flipped to Ohio state he lost against Michigan in his homecoming
@1:48 why the heck did the OSU linebacker move out of the way and let him walk into the end zone?
Ohio st at dline looked like puppy chow 😂😂
Good jobs Michigan 👌🤫🤪🙏🏿👍 see other win next.year what yell 💬
I used to watch this gm every year, would never miss it…..I think the last one I watched Troy Smith was our QB lol lol.
All that big talk from Ohio state and look what happened.. smh
Can't wait to see Chris Olave in the big leagues man. saints better take him istg
I'm a proud 👏 of my Michigan tean Haskins is a beast 💪
Harbaugh finally won a big game
Wow, no one I knew gave Michigan a chance to win this game.  Congratulations guys!
The most unexciting 5 td highlights I’ve seen 🤣🤣
Congratulations Michigan!!!🎊👏
can’t spell overrated without a capital O 🤣
Imagine telling a Michigan fan in 2018 that they’ll be cheering for a guy named Haskins who scored 5 TDs in The Game
Was really hoping Buckeyes could keep this decade long drought going, but know I just hope Michigan makes the Playoffs
If Hassan Haskins had played the way he did today in every game of the season, he would have for sure win the Heisman and become a first rounder.
Michigan '77 grad here. I'm as stunned by this win as by any Michigan game since we beat OSU back in 1976.
Michigan's offensive line got it done!
Go Blue what a game for Haskins and Hutchinson the best defensive player in the country. Despite being held allot he had 3 or 4 sacks and was constantly getting pressure.
Go Michigan😄😄😄!!!!👍👍👍👍
H2 & Hutch The Sequal coming next week to a TV near you. Go Blue:)
I hate michigan so much happy we beat them
Its great to read these comments and not see 1 ohio state fan lmfaooo losers was talking all that trash after we lost to state no playoffs for the fuckeyes hahahahhahaha
As Keith Jackson would say, how about those big uglies, Michigan's offensive linemen ewer awesome.
That offensive line was nice 🔥🔥
I'm 52 years old. Harbaugh was the UofM Qb when I was in High school. Vicksburg HS (go Bulldogs). I have never since seen a College football game that brought me to tears.
What a great game.  The best part was Ryan Day's facial expressions as his team got manhandled.
I want to say I'm Sooooo happy for that young/Haskins#25.... This game, and performance is what dreams are made of 🙏🏿✨!!!! I've bn at that level to know🏆.
Unfortunately they dont make the playoffs. The country likes ohio state.
GO BLUE
an Ohio University looked soft today. They got pushed around very convincingly.
Go Blue.  Michigan since Charles Woodson
I think it is safe too say, after this win the rivalry is officially BACK!
that michigan o line is deadly
About fkn time that we BBQed & CASTR8D those "Nuts On Steroids" (i.e.: Buckeyes).
Calm down Haskins!! Beast mode!!
I bet Michigan was the underdog too!! Lol go wolverines!!
Don't Like it at all
Ryan Day running out of Urban Meyer players team steadily getting worse, just like when Les Miles ran out of Nick Saban players
Haskins for Heisman
LET'SSSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOO BLUEEEEEEEEE I swear I was convinced we was going to win all week I think the Lord was telling me this I couldn't get convince in no logic whatsoever that osu was going to beat us for some reason I just looked at the teams we've beaten that we normally lose to(the Wisconsins, and the Penn States) and the team WE LET and the REFS LET off the hook(msu)
We are finally recovering from the Rich Rodriguez curse, and are playing the  Michigan football I fell in love w/ as a kid! We’re baaack Mortimer!
My bois 🥲🥲
The Team, The Team, The Team
2 minute highlight??
Roll Tide Roll !!! Congrats to Michigan. Best rivalry game today goes to The IRON BOWL !!! Better luck next year !!!
Another kid from St. Louis breaking out big in the world of sports!
Let’s hope Michigan plays more games with this energy and skill
I’m so happy, my Wolverines last victory against Ohio state was when I was 13!!!! This gives me motivation that 2022 will be my year to thrive and accomplish my goals.
I played against Mcnarama when he went to damonte ranch hs and lets just say 70-0 with 8 tds and over 400 yards passing
It's a win for penn state because Michigan win will always be better than OSU
Michigan finally have a year of glory
Hassan haskins welcome to the NFL
This was our national championship
Let's go big ten championship game then in the playoffs
Happy for jim considering we beat him in the Superbowl and he was 0-5 vs the buckeyes I supported Michigan today for the sheer fact he's the best coach in the world john harbaughs brother
THIS IS MIKE HARTS REVENGE >:)
the D Line and this man got it done smhhh. As a Bucs fan all i can say is we now have a rivalry, y’all needed back 2 back home games to end the streak 💀
#22 for OSU literally sees Haskins and then hides behind the other defensive player instead of attempting a tackle on the 5th TD.  I have no bone in this fight, but that was pathetic.
Go blue
This Haskins is legit.  Last Haskins is a bust.
Yes I knew the wolverines would win! I'm truly excited for my team this year!
Ead Ohio state Buckeyes,go blue
#22 didn’t even attempt to tackle him the last play lol
Michigan first win since 2011 over Ohio state
MVP
Bye bye overrated Buckeyes
Unless the wolverines are already there by the time the rankings are updated.
OSU fans were like “We aren’t Michigan State”  I mean they weren’t wrong
If Bama loses to Georgia, then Michigan will be in the playoff.
I’m sorry but to all you OSU you fans who were telling us you would destroy us when we played you, SUCK IT
GO BLUE BABY!!
Way to go blue finally took down Ohio State
Not a college football fan, but I know Michigan fans have been waiting for this moment for a very long time
HES THE ANSWER LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The committee is currently hard at work figuring out how to logically keep Ohio State in CFP contention.
Congrats to Michigan from a Penn State.  Our program stinks .  Nice win by you guys. I'm watching Alabama and Auburn in Overtime right now.  Should be real interesting if Bama loses.
The atmosphere was ELECTRIC at the Big House today!!! Won’t forget this for a long time.
Ohio state did not show up today 🤣😂
FINALLY Go Wolverines!!
Jesus without Gus Johnson calling the game it doesn’t sound nearly as good haha. TOUCHDOWN WOLVERINESSSS really hits different
Congrats to Michigan. I'm actually glad they won. Hopefully they rep the Big Ten well. A buddy at my job said Michigan was going to lose bad. I assured him Michigan might pull it off. He's gonna be all smiles on Monday lol. Anyway, the Buckeyes are going to be a force next year so I ain't even worried. Go Buckeyes!
Aye we beat them this year🤲🏻
Haskins 5tds seriously??
Go Blue! The future is once again bright for college football's all time winningest team.
As an OSU fan - I am ashamed of our defense. That may be the most pathetic display of defense I have ever seen. It rivals Michigan's last two performances against us. I really don't know what else to say.
One of the best games I have watched in the last 5 years GO BLUE!!
It feels great to be a Michigan wolverine
Imagine had Michigan made these staff changes years ago man this team broke Ohio state physically and mentally
Wow.
Ohio State Buckeyes learns the meaning of R-E-S-P-E-C-T.🏈
I had hoped Big M would win but I'm ecstatic that they spanked that 4 letter word that begins and ends with an O. Go big Blue. Now they'd better get a darn good bowl invite.
Haskins or Hutchinson at least in the discussion for Heisman?????  CJ lost today and Bryce has not scored yet in the Auburn game!
Yes! We got a new challenger
If y’all look on twitter the Buckeyes made a “team up north” trailer and once you watch that it is sad and embarrassing about how the buckeyes  lost. But as me being a Michigan fan it feels great!
I have, like many others, been waiting for THIS MOMENT to happen for a LONG, LONG time!!!  BEATING OSU IS BEAUTIFUL!!! GO MICHIGAN GO!!!
Wow you guys won good for you😐
Go Blue!!!!!! Gonna win it all this yr! Best all around team in the nation!
Jim needed this
This highlight was horrible.. Starts from the end of the second quarter
FINALLY! THE BULLIES OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL HAS BEEN BEATEN IN THE SAME YEAR. IM SO GLAD OU AND OSU CAN SIT THIS PLAYOFFS OUT!!!!!!!
Bro it was more like osu vs the reefs
I'm indifferent with both teams but I was so happy to see Michigan finally win. Was almost starting to not feel like a challenging rilvary anymore
"Goodbye Columbus"! Goodbye East Division Championship, Big Ten Championship, Big Ten Coach of the Year, Final Four Playoff Spot, Heisman Candidate, Recruiting Edge & Bragging Rights! Couldn't have happened to a more pompas a** coach, players, program and most of all - knuckle dragging FANS! GO -BLUE✊🏽!
What was #22 doing on the last touchdown? I am a raised wolverine but that was confusing
Born and raised in Ohio but never liked Ohio State. Congratulations Michigan!!
Michigan was playing tackle football while OSU was playing flag football.
Where's all the Ohio st talking mad trash last how y'all was gonna blow us out
Not really sure how people didnt think this was possible??? Its CF, nothing is forever.
Been waiting for this since High School 😭😭😭
GO BLUE
LETS GO!
I have not been this shocked by a Football game since Boise St defeated Oklahoma!  I don't necessarily mean the final score was shocking, but it was more _the way_ Michigan won...  They were Dominant up front, on BOTH sides of the ball. And I mean DOMINANT!  This Michigan Team is really, really Good! Great even!  Anyway, from this life long Notre Dame fan:  Congratulations to Michigan! Congratulations to all Wolverines fans everywhere! I truly am happy for all of you! Now, take this amazing opportunity and just go WIN IT ALL!!
Michigan’s line was killing em
Y’all don’t understand this all I wanted! Winning the national would probably make me have heart attack. I been getting trashed 9 years straight! I feel like Kevin Garnett! ANYTHING IS POSSSIBBBBBLLLEEEEEE!!!🍻
I’m going to miss Jim Brandstatter and Dan Dierdorf
I’m so hyped Michigan finally beat them Haskins was a monster to but GG to both teams
As a general football fan, I’m just happy this is a real rivalry again.
Michigan beat the number 2⃣ out of Ohio State
This was Jom Bradstetter and Dan Dierdorf's last game. What a way to go out
What a great victory in The BigHouse today. I still have happy tears in my eyes   Im so happy we beat Ohio today. This is the start of a new long winning streak!  Love my Wolverines. GO BLUE!!!
That game was sick we are going to the championship yea boy
Michigan played them just like Oregon did they can’t stop the run!!!
Sono Ohio State probably no Alabama and no Clemson thank God
this team can beat the Lions
Haskins has 5 touchdowns.... That sounds familiar, but this time I’m happy
Biakabutka Perry Haskins. Go F n Blue!
Idk why I’m so happy Ohio State won’t be in the playoffs
Man that haskins fella is a BEAST !
That o-line beast mode 🔥
Is he related to Dwayne Haskins?
Two exciting announcers! Sad they are retiring
The MAN !! 💪
Congrats on winning the division. Win the Big 10 and goto the playoff. Win ok? Go Bucks!
CFP top 4 next week: 1) Georgia 2) Bama 3) Michigan 4) Cincy 5) Ohio St  Ohio State won’t get knocked too hard for losing to the 5th ranked team in the country, on the road, in their biggest division rivalry game of the season. With this said however, a two-loss non-conference champ Ohio State team isn’t getting the playoff nod over Cincinnati this season, so the Buckeyes’ only hope at the CFP now is for either Wisconsin or Iowa to defeat Michigan in the B1G Championship game. They do have another possible outside chance at making the playoff if Bama gets absolutely destroyed by Georgia by like 3+ TDs in the SEC title game. That would be a longshot though, as the ranking committee may still view a two-loss Bama team who at least made it to their conference championship game in the SEC is more impressive than a two-loss Ohio State team that failed to even reach the B1G title game, so the Buckeyes will mostly be rooting hard for either Iowa or Wisconsin next week at Lucas Oil Field in Indy. Iowa has already won today, moving them a half game in front of Wisconsin in the B1G west, but they lost early in the season to Wisconsin, so the badgers own the tiebreaker, and if they hang on to beat Minnesota…. who they currently lead 10-3 early in the 2nd quarter, it will be Wisconsin headed to Indy to take on Michigan for all the B1G marbles.
Paul Finebaum is going to have to eat serious crow now. Excellent.
Michigan running game was great Haskins a dawg we haven’t got punched in the mouth like that since the Oregon game went verdell went crazy
I still think Ohio state should be in the playoffs as the number 4 team. What do you guys think?
Is he a senior??
Michigan is gonna win the national championship
The middle linebacker on the last play pissed down his leg 💀
Oklahoma better jump Ohio State if they win today
How are they gonna rank them in terms of playoff hopes what if Georgia loses will they keep Michigan at 5 or move Georgia to 4 keeping them out of the playoffs 🤔
Absolutely the best W for us SEC fans… The only team we worry about is Ohio State
GO BLUE!!!!!!
GO BLUE!!
The importance of an offensive line. Harbaugh 29-0 rushing over 200 yards at Michigan
Osu is soft. Go Blue and as always, Fu@k osu!
Ohio State fan here. Congrats to Michigan and their fans. Well played! To all the arrogant Buckeye fans in the comments before the game: STFU! You clowns give the rest of us OSU fans a bad rep by saying we'll beat Michigan by 60.
GO BLUE 💙
“GO BLUE”! This day’s been a long time coming!!
Haskins just too strong for a weak/soft team like Ohio State. Haskins trampled those Buckeyes into the dirt!!!!
Michigan Wolverines showed them punk Buckeyes "We ain't the Michigan State Spartans".🏈
Thought the wolverines were supposed to run into this unstoppable beast lmao
Just like that, Finebaum is on suicide watch... and it's very quiet in that city to the south. All is right in the universe!
i like haskins but i just wanna see more blake corum
I want to  Dedicate this game to the Spartans and Ohio State Marching Band. Go Blue
Def lived up to it's hype, wish the score was a lil closer...Go Buckeyes
How is a rilvery game a upset when both teams are ranked in the top 5 ??🤔
don't lose next week
Just saying, of Auburn upsets Alabama, this will be a great week :)  Also if it happens, the chances of Cinci, ND, OHIOST, To make it go way up.
OSU lost that mean OSU are out of playoff?
Congrats to UM. Y'all wanted it more today and it showed! Now stomp Wiscy/Minne and get in the playoffs!
Imagine losing to Michigan lmfao
OSU is hot garbage 🤣
Buckeye here but congrats Blue, absolutely deserved. Completely controlled the game.
This game rocked me to the core. I cried… as a die hard Michigan fan this really changed my whole year. I feel like i gotta go out and accomplish all y goals after this one. Thank you God for this win!
This guy would be great with the seahawks
Finally Wolverins staying strong!!!
MY BUZZO A BEAST #25 Remember His Name HASKINS 🐐
WHERE YALL OHIO STATE FANS NOW WHEN YALL SAID THAT U WERE GONNA BEAT US BY 40
I’ve watched my wolverines lose 9 straight games and man we didn’t just need this we wanted it more
Juwan Howard congratulates Jim Harbaugh after Michigan's win over Ohio State.  https://youtu.be/PnUzLRwnZ4g
Go Blue ! ! Bye 👋 Bye 👋  Buckeyes !!
Absolutely insane. AWESOME GAME! GO BLUE!
Live it up Mishy fans wont happen again for another 10 yrs.!!
Wow, Michigan's O-line is nasty-good. I wish my Auburn Tigers had an O-line half that good.
Remember the series has 117 games don’t let O state only talk about the times they were winning. Michigan leads the series. Focus on the large picture.
Thank you Michigan for exposing the overrated Buckeyes!  - Alabama Fan
Can we finally quit talking about how good Ohio stinks is.
GO BLUE!
Osu is not even the best d1 team in the state!
The blue pants were the key,
I went to the Ohio state vs Rutgers game.. even tho they blew them out ,.. Ohio state looked like a high school team.
Well we started the season not stopping the run and end
hought ohio state was gonna blow out michigan buckeyes trash what happened to OHIO STATE laying 70  POINTS on michigan LMAO YOUR TEAM GOT BLOWN  OUT
If Oklahoma wins they BETTER pass Ohio State in flying colors. They got beat down all game by an overrated Michigan team.
It felt like forever since we took down the buckeyes 🥳
The Rivalry needed this to happen
THE Hassan Haskins University
I'm happy for Harbaugh and his Team for Finally kicking there butts
Love to see it
Ohio state football fans hiding in a 🐀 🐁 hole 🕳  crying
all the other football feels like garbage after michigan-ohio state.
College football? Really? Why bother? Got to love those 48- 45 football games.
Game. Onto the next one.
Ohio State has 25 receivers, 13 sober Quarterbacks, and a 5th string running back as starting linebacker. Jim Harbaugh has been waiting for a home game and bad weather for years.
As an Ohio State fan gg. I am disappointed with the outcome but as Saban said “no one feels worse than the players when they lose”. Gg it was bound to happen
It's been 10 years since Michigan has beat OSU. It's all we fans have ever wanted since 2011 is to beat this team and now the streak is OVER 🥲🥲🥲
Go Blue I try to tell Em it’s in the cosmo
That’s not even a upset 😂
Go Blue!
Love it
MICHIGAN 4 LIFE
Can't the announcer get more creative and come up with another comment other than, "and the wolverines extend their lead?"
This is what you get Ohio st for beating our little bro
whos Michigan playing again??
From an LSU fan congrats to Michigan
Michigan just won the Superbowl College CHAMPIONSHIP of the Milky Way Galaxyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I hope Ohio st fans brought enough Kleenex to the big House because they’re gonna be cryin all the way back to Columbus
Hey big blue i expected a shalacking but hats off to u and finally coach punched state in their big fat mouth
Fun game to watch!
Nation celebrates when Ohio State loses.  What a great day!
Any sightings of grandpa Finebaum?
GOOOO BLUUEEEE
If it wasn’t for the hiccup against MSU they’d have a case for #1. If Michigan makes the playoff they have to be either #2 or #3 💯
didn't think we would lose, well played xichigan.
LETS FKN GOOOOOO!
Where’s all the Ohio state fans who were trying to tell me they were on the level of alabama and Georgia 😂😂 y’all would’ve got SMOKEDD in the playoff be happy it’s going to be Michigan that gets beaten like drum instead of y’all
Go Blue!!!! 💛💙🏈
Haskins dominated. Go blue.
Coming from an Ohio State fan it was bound to happen one of these years. You guys earned it and good luck in the playoffs.
Go blue we upset Ohio state
I'm still in disbelief. We actually done it!!!!  What an difference an lil staff shake up can do!!! Haskins wit 5 td's against that team?!!! Wow!!!! Mike Hart truly got his revenge.
Miami fan here michigan can we borrow ur o lineman plzz
I don’t even like college football I just hate Ohio state this was great
I was 11 years old the last time they won 😭
Congrats Michigan!  👏
Loss of Ohio state is always a joy
Whose got it better than us??
Big win for Michigan
Well Michigan you've finally done it. Still hate y'all though
That Michigan O Line DOMINATED OSU’s D Line
Haskins and Hutchison made Ohio St look like a D3 team today. Happy for Michigan players and Michigan fans today
I LOVE HASKINS
