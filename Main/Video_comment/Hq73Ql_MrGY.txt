It feels good to beat the Bills hahahaha
This game was great, good victory that my Chiefs took, let's go

Bills keep this holding bullshit. They will get killed, it cost them a first and goal at the 8, you can't keep giving them chances, they could of got the ball back like 4 times, I have watched the Chiefs hold on about 10 plays. Gotta clean up the penalties,

Joe buck troy aikman erin Andrews Kansas city chiefs vs buffalo bills 2020
Buffalo once again struggled to stop the run. Just like the AFC Championship Game. They couldnt stop the line of scrimmage and underneath routes. They didnt even make second half adjustments. Continued to play for the deep ball because they were scared of Tyreek Hill speed. Got beat by Travis Kelce just like they got beat by Mark Andrews in the Divisional Round. Lindsey Frazier either needs to step towards a new regime or his defense will always be defeated in *BIG* Games
6:23-Josh Allen you need to help him up!
Fire Joe Buck
I'm just here finding all those cocky fans who said the Bills would win.
Clyde Edwards-Eelaire ! Why doesn’t someone tell these announcers they’re pronouncing the man’s name incorrectly?
Bison: Dad what is it like to win a superbowl? Dad: I don't know son were buffalo
4:03 i was crying
The bills played better and harder here than the championship game 🤦🏿‍♂️ but I think the chiefs studied this tape saw a weakness and played on it,  fix the ground game and the bills will be ready next time but they knew the bills run game sucks so they locked down the pass game and kept blitzing allen knowing allen is no good under pressure and that's how they won the game
Terrible. Terrible GAME! What a letdown don't know where Buffalo was! 🔧🔧🔧
I wanted the Bill's to win and then win the super bowl still remember the 90s as a kid
Tonight the bills did a good job on the run imo. But we took there hearts rite out of them when we released Mahomes on them in the AFC Championship Game.
Look how they massacred my boy...
No I'm waiting for the highlights of the January 24th game
Like the buffalo bills were actually gunna go to the super bowl lmao
Well same result
NFL is rigged as usual

Why did both teams that are playing today also played each other on week 6?

HAHAHHA
Bills will get the win tomorrow.
The AFC championship rematch.
The permissible volleyball timely grip because barometer bilaterally visit but a smart appendix. hesitant, drab memory
We already know who’s winning the rematch...I’ll give you a hint, they have an “i” and an “s” in their name...
BILLS NEVER STOOD AND STILL DONT STAND A CHANCE AGAINST OUR KC BOYS!!!
So happy mahomes just got out of concussion protocol :)
10:08 is insane.... Mahomes had NO BUSINESS picking up this 1st down, absolutely miraculous
Rematch for the losers, formality for the chiefs... lets go Mahomes...........
It's going to be a good Rematch kansas by 10!!!
Ayy AFC championship rematch
Both teams got better since week 6  Mahomes 257yrds 2tds  Josh 188yrds 1td  2int  27-20
Safe to say if Mahome's plays The Chief should win.
Chiefs will beat the Bills then destroy the Bucs in SB55.
Everyone from three months ago, I can guarantee their views of the Bills have changed
Bucc's look better than either one of these teams.
Looks like Kansas City is going to roll over them. Allen made so many stupid mistakes!!   And are going to be in Kansas City.   But I'm rooting for buffalo!!
If Clyde edwards is playing Sunday. The bills gonna have to fight real hard
Chiefs was in control the whole game
I want the Bill's to get the W but I feel like Kansas city offensive will be to much.
Bills had a great season but it will end this sunday unfortunately. Bucs Chiefs Superbowl

Who’s here after the Bills beat the Chiefs in the AFC title game?
I am, I actually remember this game because it was moved to Monday at 5pm, I was pissed because I had already scheduled an appointment to finally renew my license and no way was I rescheduling lol, enjoyed my team's win, ironically there is a 70% chance of rain at Arrowhead on Sunday and the star of this game, Edwards-Helaire should be back.
The current bills team is much better than this team. We had key players out and playing with injury. It was our worst game and we only lost by 9.
Who would’ve thought that the AFC conference would come down to these two teams? I mean I expected the Chiefs to be back but not the Bills to be anywhere near a championship game tbh
As a Bills fan I was reluctant to rewatch this because I thought it would make me more nervous for the AFC Championship game but honestly it made me feel a lot better. It reminded me how depleted our defense was at this time. It looks like a totally different defense now, it’s crazy!
Bills got sonned.
The efficacious dime pharmacodynamically bury because occupation etiologically push next a stale twilight. jumbled, untidy visitor
Who’s here before the AFC Championship
13:45 talk about ineligible man (men) downfield lol
Packers vs buccaneers and bills vs chiefs both playing in week 6 and the conference championship Wow!
Whos relooking this game for sunday?
Me
Who’s here before chiefs are rematching them and about to clap
Hellow it's time for Buffalo to get revange in arrowhead in the playoffs vs Chiefs and go to the Super Bowl
Matt Milano and Levi Wallace was hurt. Josh Allen had a bum shoulder and Edmonds shoulder. Now fully healthy no one will beat the Bills
Both championships games were played week 6
let go buffalo bills
Bills got their revenge game bills are going to win AFC championship game vs kc 31-28
Lmao bills are ass😂😂😂😂
After watching this game, I hate to say the chiefs are going back to back.
Bills are better now than they were then, chiefs run game is looking a little worse, I think the bills are gonna pull off the win next week
As close as this game was till the very end,and people still say buffalo doesn't have a chance is crazy.And buffalo is a way better team now,then they were this game.
FORSURE F*** THE BILLS BIH
Bills lose
Watching this and other footage from both teams. If Chiefs not careful Bills will absolutely shut them down. Call me crazy and watch what happens.
Josh was so obviously hindered by his separated shoulder in this game...cant wait for the rematch
If the Bills do a better job against the run. They have a legit chance to win. It's going to be very tough but they're definitely built to beat the Chiefs.
Do Bills have a chance to win this Sunday Jan. 24th? or? what do you think? :)
Can't wait!!!
Matt Milano didn’t play in this game
wait both championship games was the same week 6? bucs vs packers and chiefs vs bills
Pov: you came back to this video after they both won there games and are advancing to go play each other in the afc championship game
What a coincidence........ The AFC and NFC championships are week 6 rematches
I’m ready for this rematch. LET’S GO BILLS!
no respect given..go Bills!
Weird how all four teams in the conference championship games played each other week 6
AFC Championship game gonna go same way Chiefs Bucs Superbowl
Let’s revenge
hope mahomes is ok for this great rematch
To say the chiefs “destroyed” the bills this game is laughable.

AFC championship game calling it in week 17
Singeltary runs so hard🥳
Buffalo is way better now ! I say they stomp kc now!
Hope we see kc again!
Anyone thinking this Bills team can complete with Kansas City is a fool!
Bills defense held up against Mahomes. That’s a preview of the AFC Championship.💯💯
6:04 54 saves allens life
11:23 no look pass
The Bills defensive game plan was absolute horse manure .  Did they EVER have a 5th guy in the box when the game was in the balance?
I see all these comments about how great Kansas City is and how the Bills not ready but remember and mark my words... THE BILLS WILL WIN THE NEXT GAME AGAINST THEM WHICH WILL BE BIGGER THAN THIS GAME 😃
Who’s here hoping for an AFC Championship Game between these two?
BiLLS MAFiA WiLL GET THEIR “GET BACC”!!! CHiEFS iS ON THEiR HiTLiST!!!🔫🔫⚰️⚰️⚰️
Damian williams
Edwards and Williams will be a good dou when William comes back
As a Bills Fan it sure is nice to see them do as good as they are this season...after all we are the only team in NFL history to ever go to the Super Bowl 4 times in a row back to back...........yeah... I know.....I know   and loose..  :-)   Good luck KC fans...good luck getting past Tenn.  they look sharp and ready.
All the comments hating on Allen haven't aged well 🤣
Digs should of just scored instead of going out of bounds the play before the half 😤 he had space to go crazy
This game is better https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QOZZ0CqbfdI&t=6s
WEEK 14 Now Bills (9 -3) play Stealers (11-1)Sunday Night Well i watched this game ..We had injuries on DEFENSE ..Huge ..This was no blow out and we were getting our gel on..Bills Much Improved and Much better..KC best hope we don't get there..I believe we beat them next time we Play ..Yea I know we have to beat Stealers Still have the Pats Miami which we beat both teams already.. But Im saying .. BIll's I felt we needed one more year .Top Running back away. . I feeling a whole lot more confident..Things can always change.in the NFL .

Clyde The Glyde baby! Rookie of the year 💪🏾💪🏾💯🏆 damn I was scared of the Bill's but we completely dominated them our run game was unstoppable,  O play fantastic and our Defense turned up. GG's!
A very sad, and very embarrassing game.
It’s amazing that the chiefs O is making teams play so deep lol never seen it before.
The Bill's in an emergency needs to get back last season defense. Please call those guys back from retirement we need them.
Enough is enough, the Bills needs an entirely new Owner, and new Management. Get rid of those guys who doesn't know how to win championships, and who don't know how to make it to the Superbowl.
The entire Buffalo Bills Management should indefinitely be fired and replace. And the Bills seriously needs a real new fan caring owner, who will not be 😨 afraid to put that money up for. Real pro active and talented skillful football players who doesn't crack's under pressure like Josh Allen, and the bills defense, as well as the running backs, and the wide receiver s.
The Bill"s always looses every time they play a competitive elite football team. But every time they play an ice cream team like the New York Jets or the Miami Dolphins. They would show boat boost their ego's doing news interview, talking about we got improve, and we going to learn from those past mistakes and dominate the New York Jet"s, but will not be in the limelight whenever they play a competitive elite football team, and thats the truth period.I have seen Josh Allen intentionally through the football directly in the hands of the Buffalo bills opponents, as if he was being paid to do that time after time again period.several times.
Josh Allen would be a beast, if and only if he play's exactly like Patrick Mahoney. In the game, if Josh Allen played exactly like Patrick Mahoney. The Bills would have indefinitely "Won the game period.
The Bill's Management, need to run those boy's ten miles every three day's, and teach those guys how to play more aggressively through the entirety of all competitions game's. The Bills management, needs to teach the players how to sprint faster up the fields to catch a football, and teach them how to accurately catch a football.
I say 29 - 35 kc wins ......Go Broncos
O line did awesome go chiefs
mahomes: let me throw the ball! bills:no
Who were they talking bout that looked like he was 70 but he was a 100
I can’t stand Joe Buck
The chiefs running game was on point. 🔥
Chill chris ! Your one who was over hyping the bills as if they had been a play off team full of players who has added some the final pieces lol
it’s like any team that plays the chiefs the secondary becomes non-existent
Well its fair to say the raiders only beat us because of bitter rivalry
7:51 How tf do you miss an uncontested kick with no wind THAT BAD!?!?
http://www.onlyfans.com/inkybabii_bbw
no clue who that blue shirt qb is either
The kicking has been trash on most teams this year.
10:17 LOL its like pre-school football.
CEH popped off
That O line loves mahomes
Will the Bills choke away their great start to the season? I hope not.. I’m a Colts fan but I’ve always like the Bills and the Jets 😂🔥
Is leveon even going to affect helaire at this point
Why is FOX so stupid to show the first Bills TD in slow motion? 😯😖👎👎👎 But in the 2. half FOX show one (!) of a simple run ... 🤮
Yo the Edward's-Helaire show ft Pat Mahomes is pretty good tonight....I heard Andy Reid might even have a cameo....
Edwardzzz HELAAAAAIRE
Just watched Highlights, did Frank the SHARK  Clark  play . Down under.
Bill's can't stop the run, kansas city has an elite run game.... but if they play off agaisnt the Titans run game again...... sorry... not a superbowl team like the chiefs could be. Chiefs defense is very good . Chiefs got destroyed by the raiders because chiefs never do good against rivalry teams
That that much weight how fast he get his feet down lmfao gravity vs weight duhhhh lmfao
2:16... buddy got shook out his jockstrap..
Bills put up a good fight
I Like YOU Patrick Mahomes
I’m not saying every chiefs fan is a bandwagon but I am sure seeing a lot since the Super Bowl 🤦‍♂️😂
the reason why the bills were losing was there defense was skinny asf compared to the chiefs O line
ビルズファンの皆様.....連敗はすべてお笑いコンビオードリー春日の呪いのせいです.....せっかく調子良かったのに急に春日が応援して.....あ～
Bills have to ditch those white helmets if they want to be real winners, only white helmet team that won it in recent memory had the fortune of going against Rex Grossman
Ngl that O line and Patrick mahomes is why they win
I see Taco Charlton out the more on the D Line with those Frank Clark spin moves, okay then
I hear the crowd. I don't see the crowd. Football is weird. Lol jk
Man those drawn faces are so bad their not accurate
Does Tremaine Edmunds ever not look lost on the field?
Byron Pringle is always making plays when he gets an opportunity. I wish he could get more consistent snaps outside of just special teams.
11:24 that's a no-look pass and it's honestly better than the one against Baltimore

If we had our d from last year we are the best team in football, but we all know as a bills fan WE LOST 4 FRICKIN SUPERBOWLS IN A ROW, I BROKE 4 TVS
Best I have ever seen the chiefs run the ball

Offense was real questionable
Tredevious White no int this year 🤔😥😢🏈💰👏
Jerry  Hughes got to go sorry 55

The Chiefs handed the Bills their first lost, Racist Bastard Allen made a fourth quarter touchdown late touchdowns have no value if the opponent scored over twenty points.
STOP pronouncing the H in "Helaire".   He's from Louisiana.
butterfly to end the game. bills are all hype
Who ever reads this God has a plan for you
Good  bounce back 💪💪💪
The refs in this game sucked! They didn't call most of the holding and unnecessary roughness against the Bills!

So we not gonna talk about that Hellen Keller audible? 😂  0:59 if you don’t believe me
10:29: FALSE START
The announcers had ZERO enthusiasm.
The NFL can’t tackle 🤦🏾‍♂️
joe and troy are the worst ever.
3:30 Never understood why dbs smack the ball out of peoples hands
ok
wait...joe buck announced this game and game 1 of the world series??
So funny. all them empty sets, It's great!
Are these NFL meatheads still wearing the names of dead criminals on their helmets?
#FuckAikman #FuckBuck #Trump2020
Replays please! 20mins is fine if replays are added. Replays are important.
Chiefs v Titans? Who y’all got
That one handed catch was sweet by the Kansas City defense
I love Tyreek Hill and Patrick Mahomes
Josh Allen looked like he had no idea how to throw the football this game. Dang he's so much better than he played in this game.
Dear NFL,  Please show some slo mo replays of great plays like the pic at the end.
https://youtu.be/603g7ilky0o💥
Andy Reid: *Turns into the hulk* The Chiefs: “sorry haha touchdowns go brrr”
Hardly a soul there...
it's like a video game where you pick the allstar team and the other team is the worst team in the league.
3:32   xD
god this game was hard to watch as a bills fan
Top 50 Never Heard Hip Hop Mike Luch🔥🔥YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBE MIKE LUCH!! Pat Mahomes of hip hop
mahomes is great but jesus people love to flock to hype trains. yea sure its all mahomes and hes now football god. nothing to do with his receivers being constantly open. nothing to do with a hall of fame offensive innovator like andy reid. nothing to do with a stacked offense with top tier wideouts and an amazing te whom are all open at league high percentages YEARLY. nope all mahomes. now go on and tell me about how lamar jackson is football jesus, not just a great running qb thats mediocre in the pocket.
The Bills look tired.
Cole Beasley is my favorite football player. I feel he’s underrated. Yeah, he’s not a super star but he’s a great WR. I wish Dallas would’ve kept him, but I’m happy he’s on a winning team and continues to be a reliable, go to WR when you need one.
There is criminal evidence that just came out  that Joe Biden and his  family recieved payouts from Ukrain China and Russia. Look it up! Type  in Hunter Biden laptop...
Bills d line is garbage
The Bills are a great team. And full respect for Josh Allen. I think they will win their first Super Bowl ever.
I hope the chiefs win a nother super bowl
Allen is not a good quarterback  Bills need a good ones
Why is there no replays of key plays? Would have liked to see that TD from diggs
The fake crowd noise is wack af!
10:16 original NES Super Tecmo Bowl move
I can't bear to watch football anymore after all the national anthem protests and kneeling.  Nobody who still watches football can possibly call themselves an American. You (football fans) should all be ashamed. Disgusting.
WLM
6:49 Jordan Poyer 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 gaaat damnnn!!!
Good job Patrick, good job chiefs. Keep up the grind!
It's nice hearing the players better without the crowd noise.
the fake crowd noise is kinda ridiculous /meh
Kelce shouldn't be in the same category as Kittle
joe buck must have pictures of his employer with animals.
Bills def scary. So the fact that the chiefs make it look some what not too hard is saying a lot
Kelce with the nice pick play at 13:52 to get Pringle open on a key 3rd and 12.
I'm not going to stress the last two games. If we steal one when it counts then the afc and sb is ours
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos✌️
That field goal was a yikes
Chiefs O line is just outstanding
bills just looked dead this isnt their season they are not playoff material
The bills defense hit harder than police
Bro all the refs in the NFL want the Chiefs to win and it’s so annoying. I said what I said, period love
Already week 6 wow. I wouldn't know  since I'm taking a knee on the entire season to protest systemic racism that harms millionaire athletes
https://youtu.be/WDthYzRrGFE
Everybody talks about deandre Hopkins and tyreek hill and mike Evans etc. but did you see this guys one hand catch at 2:03 behind the posts
Bills fans are hilarious. They think just because the Patriots are not a threat for one or two years that it’s their chance to win a bowl. What you don’t get is that New England dominated teams in the playoffs and used the regular season to tune up. You won’t make it past the first round.
They avenged the raiders
At the end of Clydes run at 6:43 is that the play that they didn’t call timeout and the clock kept running? Unless there was a play in between that idk how the clock keeps running are they missing something or ? Cause either that’s a lot of time they missed out on or there’s a play in between. Either case I’ll take the W
That kick was so far off 🤦🏻‍♂️😴
Josh Allen is huge..... didn’t realize he was that big
This commentary is the reason I don’t watch Monday Night Football.
Dumb & Dumber: Joe Buck & Troy Aikman https://imgflip.com/i/4j7egu
Go Chiefs
Clyde, in the first half, has back to back plays totaling about 25 yards and what are the talking heads babbling about? Someone who isn't playing in this game and no mention at all of the two plays they're suppose to be calling. Pathetic.
Josh Allen looks like he'd be about as athletic as Brady, but is very mobile.
I'm a big Chiefs fan here what scares me is is the chief getting away from what made them great in the last couple years and that's the passing game I don't care if they did I think they needed to use the run to win this game I still believe they could have won the game with the regular passing game on just about every down even when the other team knows they're going to pass they still succeed. It scares me that they look a little off-kilter when they run the ball and then to set up the pass. I'd rather see them pass the ball to set up the Run. I don't know what it is but they just don't look the same with this style of play
Kelce is so underappreciated. He's one of the best red zone threats in the league
How do the refs not see the chiefs holding??🤦🏾
look at eric fisher man always picking up his RB,
wow Patrick mahomet
Props to number 26 for the Bills at the 1:20 mark though. A small running backing destroying a linebacker and D-lineman both at once!!!
4:04- bills 3rd & 10, two seconds later, they're on the 5 yardline, great editing
7:51 bro that missed the net
Our O line was out there looking like that 2003 O line with will shields
Le’Veon is best behind a great o-line, I’d dare say he will perform even better than the rookie
bills defense is CLOWNS
https://youtu.be/aE6DVwHoM4E exactly my point
Are the Bill's still alive in AFC EAST  yea
Helaire-ious!
That’s two straight losses for the Bills after the 4-0 start.   The Bills went off to a great start, but they need to chill and get back their focus.
Second loss in a row for the billsssssssss
UFC Champ Jorge Masvidal: https://youtu.be/fPZkdhubStI
Who would have thought 5 years ago that a chiefs bills game would be the one to watch
8:14 How sad it is to see that stadium empty.  Just feel lucky enough that were able to see football!  Yay!
Go Chiefs!! from the UK, love the sport.
0:36 I stopped my 9-5 because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Bill's need a RB and A few DTs  biggest weaknesses  on Bill's
💛❤️ chiefs kingdom baby!!!!❤️💛
Silent H killed the Bills
Can I just say good job of Robinson he played pretty good out there.
For how Shitty the bills defense was. They somehow managed to keep it really close.
Chiefs look better than they did last year
The interception by Sorenson damn Daniel
What happened to Damien Williams? Was he injured?
That catch for the int at the end was sweet too lol
Back to back weeks where a flag has taken away a touchdown for Edwards Helaire... so tough
ik dam well dey ain have allen runnin da ball 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Diggs had what appeared to be the whole field in front of him with blockers and runs out of bounds. ??????  WTF !!
refs wanted bills to win
Uh oh! Somebody has a run game! Go Chiefs!
who died ?
What division is worse like for AFC east comment for NFC east
My thoughts on bell, is he’s probably gonna be used as either a 1st Down back, or a 3rd.  Clyde and Darrell will most likely run play option, and RPO.
Listen Tom brady would of looked like Michael Vick  the way bills running defense play,i remember how ESPN was saying Josh allen and the Bills are the hottest and best team in the Division,i bet you the jets beat the bills
WAY TO GO CHIEFS
And Mr "Oh come on man" wonders why he gets hit on the sideline.  Be like Edwards Elaire and walk out with fifteen yards to go.  It's safer
Those refs were like "Personal foul, the Chiefs didn't have the lid to their Gatorade cooler on tight enough."
bills just not  there maybe next yr too many mistakes u cant  keep winning with the qb running draw plays this isnt collage!
The bills did not have good defense
*sigh*
Kelce is a truck
As a Packers fan, I can only look on in fear for our defense...
Josh Norman played well but he also was a lil cocky but I bet that will all go away when they play the Titans
Not the greatest by either team but props to Buffalo for holding their ground. We can used what we learned in the playoffs when we play the Chiefs again.
THE BUFFALO BILLS NEED A BETTER DEFFENSE
Chiefs are back, great defence and offence.
Chiefs kingdom 🤟🏾
I'm excited to see Bell in this offense. Could make us seriously unstoppable.
Was it just me or did the Chiefs just beat the Bills and the refs?? Lopsided calls as I've ever seen. Every 3rd down pass was a PI, Josh Allen throws to no one and no intentional grounding, making up illegal touching calls...just non stop calls against the Chiefs....dont let us forget the no measurement on 3rd down. Just insanely ridiculous by this crew. Nfl wants Bills to be better than they are.
There is no way to stop the chiefs offense
LSU boys showing out, Patrick Queen, Justin Jefferson, Clyde.. sheesh
Bills defense sucks they ain’t doing that on the Bucs
I can't remember the last time the Chiefs ran like that. It was like watching a different team.
chiefs NEED to get rid of butker
Wat are this guy's eating 💪💪💪💪
"He is determined to show the Jets that he was misused..."  Well, that's not hard to do...
Bills need Chris Jones more like DAT defense is wack
Bills know how to lose. Brilliant out of bounds personal foul by Jordan Poyer.  Can't stop the run and can't run. Allen was 8 of 20 at one point.  Super wide right to potentially tie the game.  3rd down... Here you go Chiefs excuse us.
Mahomes= russel Wilson  Josh Allen = Aaron Rodgers
bills really missed milano, murphy, and harrison phillips and it really showed. The o-line needs some push too
Bills ain't getting through the Chiefs
Do they need Leveon Bell? No.
One of the most beautifully coached games in the history of the nfl. After a loss, Andy and Eric figure If you want to drop 7 or 8 into coverage bcause you fear all the weapons, then sure, but youre going to pay an enormous price for it playing your safeties a mile from the line. Genius coaching. Now people wont know whats coming and were more unstoppable than what we were. If you cant even get a chance to touch patrick because youre playing on your heels, were repeating lol. #ChiefsKingdom
I still love the Buffalo Bills. They will meet again in the playoffs!Go Bills! I BILLIEVE!!!
This man got a cannon and then runs it like WHAT
Cole Beasley should be the main target. Always open.
where tf is tyreek hill?
Stevie Wonder could have been the running back and found the holes in our defense. I thought McDermott was a defensive guru.
Bills need a new d line, another linebacker and another back to help Singletary.. and we’ve been out coached these past two games as well
Gg Chiefs fans! Y’all outplayed my bills on both sides of the field! The bills D is atrocious! They need to get it together...
Bills had a solid first half with a ground n pound game plan, almost tying the game on a little NC field goal.  Then the Chiefs executed the same plan better the second half, and the Bills had too many drops.  I look forward to a rematch, hopefully with fans and Milano, as both were sorely missed.
1 Peter 4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.
yessir
Russ is laughing watching this
The chiefs O-line went stupid this game
Bills have such a bad O-Line and run defense
“i feel like i’m back in Minneapolis”😭😭
If the draft restarted where would y’all say Clyde Edwards heliare would get drafted? (Sry if u spelled your name wrong)
I still believe the Chiefs are going to go 14-2 this year! (And Win the Superbowl of course!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
I feel like the chiefs have to manny offensive weapons to keep everyone happy
Wish I got to see Le'Von Bell play this game
Bills defense did the job their scheme was designed to do. The offense failed to make adjustments all game long. There were easy first downs in the middle of the field on short passes, and they simply never ran the routes to take them, and even when they did somehow Allen missed seeing them. Daboll got outcoached this game.
The Bills should go back to the Red Helmet!
Edwards-Helaire ROTY in my opinion gonna be the best back in the league trust me on that
Chiefs need to get rid of  that kicker
Dodgers  get a to 1st base Joe Buck: LETS GOO OMG  Chiefs get a pick: Joe Buck: what a pick
13:34, should have been false start and 3rd down could have changed the game
Missed call for holding number 72 of the Chiefs at 14:35
We got a lot of work to do.
We'll play by the chief eat the clock all game long. And when they need to close big throws from Mahomes. Excellent game plan
I’m wearing a bills shirt rn
Nice catch from Beasley for first down
Maybe Cousins needs to start taking lesson from Mahomes on how to play football
In all the games I've seen from the chiefs this year, their o-line is always holding and never called
This game just showed off the versatility of the chiefs they’ll take whatever you give them and make it work. Probably gonna win back to back unless any injuries happen god forbid
Uhhhh buffalo time  for the duke !
Patrick Mahomes is being carried by his Receivers and Tight End. Change my mind. Seriously his passes are often too high or behind the receiver. Does he have the strenght? Yes. Does he have the talent? Hell yes. Is he doing everything right? Nope.
As a Chargers fan, every time Butker misses a kick I get PTSD...
How did the Bills Go from 3rd at the 28 to 1st&Goal at the 4!? 4:00
Kelce just had to grin in the thumbnail photo :)
Mahomes!
All lives matter
ビルズ惜しいねえ
Who edited this clip????
The NFL needs to seriously consider having 2 games on Mondays, or a game on Tuesdays, this was great
The Chefs Offensive Line is the standout difference between these teams today. Laying roads through the Bills front 7.
“diggs was left alone on the sideline. he’s good on the sideline just ask the saints” as a saints fan that was cold but funny as well😂
wth happened to the Bills defense?
Give the KC OLINE credit too....Most rushing yards by a Andy Reid team. Go Ravens !!!
When the highlights are sped up and instead of normal speed
Definitely not watching another bills game this year. They don’t earn my viewership
Edwards helaire is insane
This was a massage to Bell that if this don't work out it's not us it's you
These highlight videos are so laughably bad. I don't understand why the scene selection is done like this. I miss old school highlights reels man.
i don't think he is second best in the whole nfl
Both good teams this year... May win Superbowl
Well played by Allen and the Bills, but Chiefs mental stamina proved to be better
Fox sport 6 seems to think Travis Kelce didn’t get the 1st TD
12:09 was a fake behind the back pass 👀
5:27 a Chiefs slot WR jumps when Pat does cadence, this causes 3 Bills players to point to him and the line backer even jumps in the air, no flag thrown and the ref is staring him down not even 20yards away. this allows Kelce to get open for an easy td on White since he was pointng to the ref and saying he jumped, which he clearly did, and the ref acknowledges white but play continues. thats why players shldnt let flags be a thing to get, just play the game and that play. let the flags come afterwards but good officiating. which clearly is blind af. lmao
this is always the time of year when the truth starts to become apparent
Edwards-Helaire looks like he's been in the NFL for a few years now. Really patient to let the o-line move up the field and a bowling ball in the secondary.
I wonder how the chiefs convinced leveon to sign their contract, i mean this game obviously showed they don’t really need another runningback
I feel Damien willams and Clyde Edward are the best rb’s in the league I just hope the chiefs ain’t forget about Damien Williams
One handed picc to end the Game that boi turnt ❗️
0:56 look at White throw Hill off him like nothing and walk away. blocking must suck for Hill sometimes going against some of the bigger db's.
Patrick only had 224 passing 2TD watch no body say he had a bad game but brady have the same game and even without any pick6 and poeple will say that's not a good game.
10:36 You’re not McKinnon or Jefferson just stop🤦🏽‍♂️
Looking at Miami at 3-3, 1 game back 😳
Kelce fumbled😂Kittle could never💯
6:46-6:50 Kelce can’t even block like Kittle😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Imagine scrolling down then you find this comment               May God bless you
God, this broadcast sucks! Can you call a game with any less excitement? Sheesh
Helaire gashed us tonight, but the Bills O had so many missed opportunities. Gotta put some points on the board
Digs should of never went out of bounce  befor the half ended he would of scored
That ref get between Andy and a cheeseburger or what? holy hell...
What was Kelce thinking at the end of the first half? he already had the first down and could stop the clock by going out of bounds.
As a Chiefs fan these games are a lil to close for comfort. I mean I understand why we're runnig the ball so much this year.. But the right quarterback would put together winning comeback drives like Russell Wilson or Rodgers to win some of these games. Our defense needs to step it up If we're gonna to keep pounding the ball like we did today.
Why did digs run out
Clyde is a beast and you can't change my mind
Edwards-Helaire is a beast. Quality!
What happened to the Bills defense smh
Clyde Edwards-Helaire felt disrespected when they picked up LeBron Bell😂
KC didn't play good this game. Where was P. Homes throwing offense
Im happy for andy reid!
Finally a running game worthy of the name. Thanks for the doc who prescribes glasses.  ;-)
Bro I thought dan at the end was trav with that nasty snag I was like they put trav on d no way
Jesus CEH was at 102 at halftime😳
Edwards-Hellerrrr!
Dirty Dan!
Bills beats Raiders, Raiders beats Chiefs, Chiefs beats Bills. This is why I love this game
14:37 #57 Got held
Blatant holding 1:40
2:14 tho....
Nobody: Mahomes: "One eighteen! Wassup!"
Can’t even be really all that mad about my Bills losing this. Sure it was rough but the Chiefs are too good of a team
10:59 💀
How about that Monday afternoon game was kinda cool
Wait til Bell gets on the field 🤯😤
Love these highlights, Allen gets sacked on the 33 yard line, next play.....Bill's 1st & goal on the 6.....
Mahomes has 4 interceptions that were dropped and one that wasn’t called. He has 2 that were called. That’s 7 interceptions in 6 games😬😬😬
Why didn't the bills go for 2 on that last TD??
Did mahomes and Allen do the throw off?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhjl0b2Pq5I
Bills ain’t going anywhere with this small time bum coaching staff. How Daboll wasn’t left tied to a chair in reliant stadium after that playoff loss is a catastrophe in its own right.
Could I please get a Chiefs fan's delusional explanation of how the RT did not get called for holding at 4:34 please?  Surely one of you wagon-jumpers can explain the RTs left arm draped across the defender
Bills kinda overrated ngl
"3rd and forever"
IM so happy for this team! They are using different people like Demarcus Robinson, Darwin Thompson, and Darryl Williams insted of the usual deep passes to hill and watkins. This team is only learning and growing. The run game is here! Bell is only here to add to the help! We will not depend on him. I am optimistic for my Chiefs team to be back in the Superbowl!!
LETS GO CHIEFS!!
Huge difference with no crowd. Kelce woooooooooowhooooo lmao
https://youtu.be/FMmbEhitE8s watch if you wanna laugh 😂
The bill were picking alot of poor defensive formations.
Awesome Job NFL.  Allen gets sacked at the 28, then it flashes to 1st and goal from the 4.  Pretty generous spot from the refs, because obviously nothing happened between the two plays shown.
Super bowl ring number 2 coming right up fam
"He's good on the sideline. Just ask the saints" rip saints fans
Dang, Clyde carrying Mahomes and the rest of the offense
Cheifs are the best and yall haters are mad Hahaha
How did Fox get this game?  CBS is supposed to have AFC games.
Anyone else find chiefs extremely boring to watch when they run so much..?
And everyone thought which one of these teams was gonna give the other their first lost
People need to start calling it a "Sorenson", when the game is ended with an interception. He's getting good at doing it.
Bills too passive on defense.
Damn, Clyde is agile af. He looks so quick and slippery. Bells got some big competition for reps.
Joe Buck makes every game dreadful to watch. Such a boring lad.
Chiefs won this at the Bills stadium, with a backup o-line, a young and upcoming Mecole Hardman (along with the rest of the Legion of Zoom, Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins) a stud in Clyde HE,  a top 2 Tight end in Kelce, without LeVeon Bell and decent backups everywhere on offense. Then obviously, with Mahomes being himself is just ridiculous. Then on defense they got Chris Jones who imo is 2nd to Aaron Donald in terms of D-line men. Hit stick Honey Badger, Breshad Breeland, Frank Clark. Mack Wilson, and many othes with a very deep young core. Now pair all that talent with the best coaching staff in football atm with Reid at the helm, Bieniemy being hella creative and Steve (DC) countering everything like the Bills O. Chiefs are the most complete team in the league and they will be for years to come. Wouldn’t be surprised if they win back to back. Only team that might a chance of consistently slowing them down is the Steelers and even that’s a stretch.
I've a defensive alignment question for Bills fans: Did the Bills 'spy' a LB or a DE during the game tonight that you saw? I ask because Mahomes rushed for 36 yards tonight, and last week, The Raiders beat the Chiefs with a 3-man rush and DE Arden Key mirroring Mahomes from the line of scrimmage. You've GOT to spy Mahomes on 3rd-and-long in order to beat the Chiefs. Not a Raider fan but their staff figured it out first and beat the Chiefs, at Arrowhead.
Why did they need Bell? They have a stud running back already.
First 6 weeks Very limited big plays still 5-1, KC fans this is beautiful.
I really don't quite understand the hype for Mahomes. Yeah he is a great QB, but look at ALL the weapons he's had available to him while in KC. Show me an average quarterback with the same help around him in recievers, backs, tight-ends and a strong o-line and they'll produce amazing numbers.
Awesome 2 qtr touchdown catch for Kelce! Talk about CLUTCH!!!👏👏👏 It's hard to stop that much body mass from moving forward at a full run! I hope he stays a career Chief!!!
Lowkey mad they picked him up he just wasting cap space.
We never needed bell.
Love how Mahomes is completely fine just running the ball all game. Would be easy for KC to give him the ball especially against another top tier QB. Dude just wants to win, nothing else matters
COVID OUT BREAK MY ASS NFL IS RUN BY THE PETO CABAL.....HAVE A CHEESE STEAK ON THE STORM!
Bills looked soft and slow.  Low energy
What is going on with the referees and spotting the ball.
How about that O-Line🔥🔥 Go Chiefs‼️💪
Bills were terrible and this game was close. Even though they lost they are still very good. If the bills played good i could see them winning this game. No doubt
Bills lost 2 straight thanks to the Titans COVID but they will win next week since they have the Jets
Damn, going for the Bills and Browns this years. Why? Cause they’ve sucked for so long. Come on bills.

Bills suck lol go chiefs
"Diggs is good on the sidelines just ask the Saints" I cry tears of laughter and sadness
Chiefs Kingdom Stand Up.👌🤙
Not the Bill's defense of last year!..When you cant stop the Run..you in TROUBLE!!
Chiefs running back Edward Helaire is a dangerous rookie
Andy Reid : going into avatar state 😡   Refs : ight imma head out 👀
what happened with the bills defense smh...
The Bills running game needs to step up.
PHAT  PAT!   Go CHIEFS. lol🏈🏈🏈 Real recognize real.  FREE artist:  FAT  PAT
Lol intercepts- the end
https://youtu.be/NUuNLXMWIi0 lit
I like the Bills. But they are who we thought they were.
RN4L
Wtf bills
Josh Allen should never be compared to Mahomes again
Travis kelce's animated pic looks like Beavis... just sayin
1. Steelers 2. Chiefs 3. Titans 4. Seahawks 5. Ravens 6. Bucs 7. Bears 8. Packers  9. Raiders 10. Saints
Oh god! It's bad enough I have to listen to Joe Buck, but I also have to listen to him miss pronounce Clyde Edwards-Helaire's name.
Just take the pads off, no one wants to tackle. Well no on on the Bills
Le,Veon Bell Gets his First win of the Season
Cycle has been complete.  Bills beat Raiders, Raiders beat chiefs, chiefs beat bills.
Alrighty. So there is mahomes. Then the receivers are hill Hardman kelce Robinson Pringle Watkins Elaire and now bell?. This is just unfair for the rest of the nfl. At least im a chiefs fan through this
7:57  Look like 1990 Scott Norwood lmao haha We gonna love that in FEBRUARY
What kinda field goal attempt was that at the end of the first half? He missed that by 80 feet. 😂😂😂
GET OUT OF THE CAR SPRINGSTEEN!
I hate toss backs on third down, you have a yard to go for a first and you move the ball back 5 yards. It’s dumb. Defenses know how to defend it. OCs who call it should be driven out of town.
Mahomes is not that great he's lucky
Seeing the chiefs able to run the ball like this and control the clock makes me happy as a chiefs fan 👍🏾😄can’t wait to have bell
Lol the Bills started out so strong but are now tied with the Browns
Watch out Bills. Miami is hot
Where’s all the people saying he deserved to be an 80 overall in madden?
match against chiefs means u get free point???
Clyde #25!!! What a great pick  in the draft...Reminds me of a cross between  Emit Smith and Barry Sanders...KC plays in Tampa 2 times this year.  11-29-20 and Super Bowl Sunday,, KC has the run game on fire...Defenses trying to stop Clyde the Glide w make are speedsters wide , wide open...50 year fan from KC....see you in February...Go Kingdom>>>
And they have ranked kittle over Kelsey??? Kittle is good but Kelsey is the best in the NFL of tight ends...
Butker has missed so many extra point this year, he's really not on point. Hope it won't be the kicking game that will comeback and bite us in the arse when it really counts in Jan and Feb.
Where is buffalo's kicker they have bass kicking and thafs why they lost. It wasn't Allen. Patrick is supposedly so good yet it was there kicker who wont they game for them

Beasley would be sitting out the next game. Multiple drops the int at the end he didnt even try. Weakass.
why didn’t the oline just turn around lmao all that td space at 4:20 and they were right there
Edwards-Helaire is the return of the running back.
This is a good sign for the NFL this shows that the Chiefs can be stopped.
10:18 sick move by Pat Mahomes.
Hope we draft good defensive players chiefs kinda need it
Chiefs O line killed the Bills.
I can't believe the chiefs have Leveon Bell now too. Their running game is gonna be lit.
Thank god I didn’t watch it. My heart broke. Congrats Tech n9ne congrats eddie Griffin. But Buffalo Done Amazing Today
So Le'veon Bell wasn't able to play yet for KC?
The Chiefs are who we thought they were. The Bills are improved, but not undefeated improved. They're crashing back to earth.
daniel sorensen saved my fantasy holyyy
https://youtu.be/kNsQQQu1YjU
that was slick what Mahomes did at 10:16, pretend like he going out of bounds lol
I think Edwards gonna keep his job in the backfield if he keeps running like that.
Don't forget to hit that like  Cuz it help this channel with YouTube Algorithm Thank's !
NFL FAN Tees and Hoodies at the best prices. Thanks! https://www.ebay.com/str/whosonfirstresale
do they ever call holding anymore?
Butker has missed like 5 fgs in two weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT8_1V_Xx_w&list=PL_n2DmSw49-EaxVXCHSz8I-N9h8vQjgud
Bruh Edwards-Helaire is doing so much work for the Chiefs offense and still only has like one touchdown.
“He (diggs) is really good on the left sideline, just ask the saints” is one of the coldest things I’ve heard during a game
Theres literally not one nice thing you can say about the bills the last 2 weeks.   6 weeks in and the defense looks like dogshit. Dont feed me this "injuries excuse" bc even before the injuries we didnt look good. Shoulda obliterated the jets and fins but didnt because of the defense. we get 0 pressure on opposing QBs and force 0 turn overs.... thats an unacceptable combination. We let phillips and lawson walk in favor of jefferson and addison. Phillips was our entire pass rush last year and even though shaq lawson sucked as a pass rusher he was phenomenal vs the run. Now we cant stop anyone and I celebrate anytime we actually get a 4th down stop w/o giving up points.... a far cry from last year when that was the expectation every drive.  As for the offense. Josh allen turned back into a pumpkin and so did the WR's. that last 2 weeks the bills have about 8 drops.... one of which went for a INT that permanently shifted the momentum of the titans game in the first 2 minutes. The o-line cant block and we have no running game outside of Josh Allen himself.   Remember when Yannick was up for just a 2nd round pick? and the bills decided to use cheap shoddy patch work FA's instead? An elite #1 DE is arguably the most important position in football behind the QB. and the Bills coulda grabbed one for a mid tier draft pick. But no.
Joe Buck is ufckin' awful.
I respect Andy Reid and Pat Mahomes. However, I refuse to watch the NFL anymore, nor these highlights which supports the NFL. And this is coming from a Chiefs fan since I was a kid. Grow up NFL and realize that your country and your flag is more important than some game day ego trip.
I was eager to see how leveon would play and he didnt even get not one snap wtf andy reid why start a rookie over an all-pro back?
I enjoy when footballer Chiefs celebrate point scoring with sexy dance moves to thrill their many male admirers.
It's Mahomes world, everybody else is just living in it
Let's not forget the Raiders beat the stinky Chiefs 🥰 Raaaiiiddddeerrrrssss. Y'all can come at me with hate all you want, still isn't gonna change that L Kansas city took 😘
11:43 Why in the world would you do that ?? Because of that the Chiefs got the first down , that tackle cost the Bills so much . I don't understand why in the world he did that ¯\_ಠ_ಠ_/¯
Can't wait to see the future for these great QBs many more battle to come
Doesn't matter which team you support ... watching a Chiefs game is always entertaining.
This what happens when you trade micha hyde
Chiefs and Titans defeated the Bills so the debate on Bills going to the superbowl is over.
Some terrible defensive play calling this week in the NFL.
Chiefs running backs were like uh uh we don’t need Le’veon on our team
This is why people shouldn't go crazy over their team claiming their going to the Super Bowl in week 4, 5, or even 6! Teams are going to get hot and cold over time. It's not going to be until week 13, 14, and 15 until you can really claim anything. It's all about making it into the playoffs and then how hot your team is at the time! The Bills could finish as a terrible team or they could get hot at the end of the season and make a deep run into the playoffs.
A on handed grab, what a pick 🏈
The Chiefs Vs Buffalo Bill & the refs. #ChiefsKingdomBaby
I laughed at how Jordan was like WHY I GET FLAGGED FOR BRUH u body slammed the dude after blown dead and out c'mon man
I kind of thought the Bills would lose the last two. Now they''re 4-2. They should beat the Jets next Sunday, but oh, boy, the Patriots after that.
Get someone to love you like Breeland did to Terry at 6:20
Lowkey mahomes would have passed more if it wasn’t wet
Diggs had a TD, end of 1st. He'll hear about that.
CEH played like he was fighting for a roster spot
Reid needs to use everybody every game like he did tonight. Teams target the usual receivers Hill, Watkins, Hardman, Robinson and Kelce(TE) but forget about Pringle and never even heard of Marcus Kemp. Its a team sport so why not use everybody that have shown themselves worthy and can produce.... Seals Jones is another go to guy but doesnt get used.
It was all up hill for the Bill's after Ricky Williams #34 scored for the Chufs
CEH is such a good RB. With dangerous weapons on offense like Mahomes, CEH, Hill, Kelce, etc. how can they not be a favorite to make or win the SuperBowl?
Jesus the bills  o line and d line got bullied
Win,  lose, or draw...go Bills! Keep grinding Bills. Don't give up on the season. Much football left to be played still. Stay focused and determined. I'm ending this comment by telling you all that Jesus died on a cross to deliver you from an eternity without Him. He wants you to be in Heaven with Him. He loves you and is concerned about every detail in your life.
This year the Bills have a solid team. You have to play mistake free, and get some breaks against the Chiefs to win.
Not even a Chiefs fan, but I gotta say, they’re a FUN team to watch. Mahomes is the man!
Bills barely beat the dolphins by a fieldgoal, get absolutely demolished by 9-7, and struggle to get the ball in the air against the chiefs. I think maybe they're overrated since they're struggling so hard against good teams. They'll likely win the AFC east and put my dolphins in a wildcard spot but it's hard to see them winning anything in the post season with the way they've been playing.
Bills beat Raiders Raiders beat Chiefs Chiefs Beat Bills  Triangle Complete
Mahomes just a different breed
Bills beat Raiders Raiders beat Chiefs Chiefs beat Bills
Woohoo!! Go Chiefs!! You guys are doing great! Keep it up!
Bulls and the third downs, what a love story
8:43 nice little pro bowl comp style over the shoulder 1 handed catch by Singletary
Just wish this was played in old Rich Stadium
SB -- Here we come !! Lets go chiefs!
*JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU GOTTA HAVE THE PERSONNEL TO EMULATE WHAT THE RAIDERS DID THIS RUNNING GAME WILL HELP MAHOMES BIG TIME*
Ah crap! Mr mah! Makes it look easy!
Ed Oliver looked garbage. He was consistently on the ground & was just not near the ball to even make a play. Oliver looks little out there & was getting bullied
Can someone please tell me how to watch football without getting bored because I’m trying to get into the sport but I don’t know the proper way to watch it
It takes 5 days to get tested for covid when you switch teams in the NFL so leveon bell will be in next week
wtf is going on with Allen? He's been dragging his right foot for the last two games now. Did they fire a quarterback coach or something? His footwork is horrible now.
Jesus is coming soon so repent from your sins and turn to God, God loves u and he is not willing that anyone should parish pls listen. Jesus is coming soon repent, he loves u and wants you to be saved
A few months ago I came across a recommendation from Mr. Daniel how he helped investors make big money from their investments.  and decided to try what I have.  Now my little one has become something great that I did not expect ... thanks to him I win and live very well.  You can connect him on Telegram at @Danielwrightfx or WhatsApp: +17865272947
0:59 did he say Helen Keller
Good win Chiefs Nation
I bet and lost 54 virtual dollars on this game. Bills let me down again...
The BILLS Zone Defense is PATHETIC ! How the hell you're in Zone and DON'T know where the Receivers are? Receivers gonna find open spaces. BILLS Too Busy looking at The QB.
Wait till LB comes to KC...whhhhhaaatttt?
I love the faux crowd noise. Not!
third down and forever...... chiefs convert😁
Typical bills the defense sucked .
Buffalo exposed they cant stop the run at all. Look at who they beat jets dolphins barely raiders barely rams barely they aren't good
Pat mahomes is rediculous i think hes the most impactful player in NFL history seriously.. so dominant and they when they have a run game going good night.
Nooooooooooooo
Da billllllllzzzz
Let’s go buffalo “
Bills looked flat again
looking like the AFC runs though KC now...
13:50.. How the hell did they let him get that open. Obviously someone want doing their job.
3 games after Jets coming up for my Bills- Patriots, Seahawks and Cardinals. Goodnight Irene with this defense, and the old Josh Allen coming back.
And i thought the bills were gonna win lol
these past two weeks shows buffalo is not there yet
i swear i've seen bills start 4-0 multiple times before collapsing and missing the playoffs
Watching the Bills in this game is watching a team that had no interest in winning. Seriously, Allen stepping back on a QB sneak? The Chiefs need an inch and they end up getting a 15 yd. TD? It's amazing the Bills only lost by nine. KC is good, but the way Buffalo played, you should've been able to put 40+ on them.
I told y’all what would happen when Bills started playing real competition bills beat Teams like the hurt raiders and jets and dolphins and everybody looking at em til they get they butts handed to em by Derrick Henry and The KC Chiefs
What so disrespectful is the dude didn’t have to one hand pick it 😂😂
Bills looked terrible in every phase, the dolphins might actually take this division
Lifetime Bills fan here. Josh Allen looked great for 4 weeks. He seems to have turned back into his former self. You can see the difference when a play breaks down- Josh is frenetic, like his hair is on fire. A complete contrast to an always calm, and mature Mahomes. I'm not worried about JA though. I think he will continue to grow and learn. My larger concern, defense notwithstanding, is Sean McDermott. Gotta feeling he is going to be one of these guys that coaches well enough, to stick around for a few years, while we fans always get the same results. Forget about a Super Bowl with McDermott- no way, no how. Too many better coaches out there. Once BB and Reid are gone, keep an eye on Mike Vrabel- he looks like a winner, and has a very disciplined team- the opposite of McDermott. Right now Ryan Fitzpatrick is the most consistent QB in the AFC East. Josh's body language and facial expressions are not reassuring, and his passing has been awful. Heaven help us Bills fans! Belichick will school McDermott in a couple of weeks. It sucks.
No doubt the Chiefs will be Champs again as long as the REFS quit hating the Chiefs.. Feel Me?
When your backup o-line group is better than your starting o-line group
hi
hey
Just a few years ago the bills had good defense every year it is getting worse
2:15 dudes ankles were detached from his body.
Why they need leveon bell again?  Clyde edwards-halaire went off dude took the signing personal 😂
I’m telling you we should put Clyde at fb when leveon comes
Well the Bills are what I thought they where. Another North East team racking up L's.
You cannot spell OVERRATED w/o JOSH ALLEN 🤦
Edwards helaire rookie of the year
👽👉🏿THE WORLD IN GOD JUDGMENTDAY🙏🏽
I think Clyde showed everyone why we don’t need bell😂
People really didn’t watch the game and it shows 😂 people are really saying Allen isn’t playing like a top 5 qb keep that same energy though
A wins a win but game was tight
11:12 anyone noticed he kicked the ball?
Raider Nation for all you bitchass KC fans. Focus on division before y’all talk all this nonsense😂😂
As a bills fan I'm worried but not to much, we held the chiefs to 25 and Matt Milano was not playing, he's critical to our defense, on offense Allen needs to step up and set his feet, I'm right about this right? We lost to the best teams in football, at least we play the jets, #billsmafia don't give up and gg #chiefs kingdom
Mahone boy is sneaky
Wait Josh Norman is still playing after last week
Andy Reid rages I have never seen him rage that bad.
That Leveon Clyde duo is gonna  be crazy! And if he can learn from bell some patience cuz he really shows it sometimes it will be goos for his career
HEY, JETS. JUST RUSH THE WHOLE GAME AGAINST THE BILLS AND YOU'LL WIN
Lol must be nice to have open receivers every down for mahomes. Guy is great don’t get me wrong but he’s in the right system with the best receiving core in the game. Not to mention one of the best o lines and a top 10 running game.
That RB looked like he was too slippery too tackle my god...
Lmfaooooo
Where's levon bell??
CHIEFS Won....! YES..! 😊❤🏈
Chiefs 25 👍🔥👍🔥
did leveon get in the game
This rookie Edwards-Helaire rampages everywhere.
As a phins fan thanks again chiefs
This was a good game
Great game for the chiefs. Good redemption from the loss against the raiders. Go chiefs!#ChiefsKingdom
Bills choked, they are not contenders. They're D is HORRIBLE. And Allen is back in his old funk. (btw Bill fan here)
Patrick clutch
camera quality bad
Chifes play book  RPO  RPO RPO RPO RPO RPO RPO RPO
Yes
"Bill's offensive line and Defense has taken a huge setback from last season. Josh Allen used to chill in the pocket now hes running for his life. Defense used to get tons of sacks and good in pass defense now they get torched and get no sacks. McDermott needs to start calling the defense and fire Leslie Frazier tho"🤔⏳ #yup
1,000th comment
I just reacted to this game & I’m not gonna lie this was a good game could’ve went either way Patrick Mahomes is clutch tho him & Aaron Rodgers most definitely have similar play styles wat you guys think????

What do you think guys was Allen pretending this entire time or was this another off game? (not hating btw)
I've  been a chiefs fan be for they where winners  my friends  always  ask why are you a chiefs  fan in Az because  I  am!!
That field goal wasn't no where near the target
Kansas after a surprise loss in wk5 go to ground against Bills,stacking yards with the running game patiently playing their way to victory.
Chiefs were just a little bit better then bills but i still think they can bounce back easily
Let's GO CHIEFS...! 😊❤
TitansUP
It was pretty lame how the bills had to siphon sound in because they dont have fans
Man this was not I was expected good game
Do we even need Leveon bell ?
Were is McCoy
Cmon bills 😔
Clyde sending a message to levon bell
CEH is rookie of the year!
Mahomes has so many weapons it's crazy. Maybe they'll meet up again in the playoffs.
Awesome bounce back win for my guys..I thought trampling of Buffaloes was illegal. Just a quick shout-out to all the Raider fans who are probably still celebrating last weeks win..I can pretty much assure you the Chiefs didn't take a "Victory" lap around Bills stadium afterwards.
#49
#25 for KC is a beast
3:30-3:35 😂 breeland was not f***ing with diggs
14:36 Look at edwards helaire lol
Am I the only one with terrible frame rates on these highlight vids??
Bell was a waste of money for the cheifs
Bills fans can take a loss better than the raiders fans can take wins over the CHEIFS.
Mahomes can't help but to score with these weapons but yea hes the GOAT lolololol
Chiefs gonna most likely win the conference. They have to many weapons.
Chiefs beat everyone who potentially will be vying for the number #1 seed on their schedule they don’t get to play PIT TEN IND this year.
CEH was on sicko mode tonight. We did this w/o Sammy Watkins and Lev Bell. Keep getting better. #Squad #Chiefs Kingdom
Bills beat Raiders Raiders beat Cheifs Cheifs beat Bills  WTF?!?!?!
Thank you KC
What was diggs doing on 7:39 he could have took it all the way
I hate that CEH will do the work to get them to the red zone and then they pull him. Like bruh, he’s destroying them, let him get a touchdown.
7:41 this 3 points could have made a difference
Dirty Dan is the man
wh wants to date (girls only)
that game was boring
Good game Josh Allen... nothing more then a speed-bump in your young and fruitful career. On that note...  GO HAWKS!
Whoever is editing these videos sucks. The parts u wanna see r ignored and then on to a 2 yard run
The bills lost twice in a row that's gonna put them in jeopardy
To many penalties.
Is that a crowd sound track being played?? 😂😂😂😂
The. Chiefs do not look destined to return to the SuperBowl, the Steelers look like a SB destined team.
yall are fuckers the bills are the best
Ham, no burger?  Kool, no aid?
This replay of the game was terrible. Come on, NFL y'all can do a better job. Allen got stop in a 3rd down and than y'all show us 1st and goal Bills (how,  what happend), no replay of the Bills touchdown, we want to see it, usually no replay of 1 point kick, so when you show us the chiefs kick conversion replay I already figured out they missed, no replay of the measurement. STOP IT. Please
Only if the Chiefs played like this last week, effing hate the Raiders man.
Even when this was close, score wise, you never had the feeling the Bills could win.
14:32 #57 Epenesa got held that's bullshit
Chiefs getting cancer next week
does levon bell play this game? when will he be in the rotation?
That’s how you defeat the Bills AND their REFS in their house
Josh Allen: (っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ White 20 SET HUT! ♥
Let gooo👌🏈🏈
Wahomes
Edwards Helaire Is Looking Really Good Out There Man
Why do some games have fans in the stands, while others, like this one, have empty stands?
Chiefs playing on another level.  Hate to admit it lol
Screw chiefs
From a Steelers fan good win chiefs fans you guys are a great team I hope we see eachother in the afc championship💯mahomes will be the best in the league for many more years
Watch how many views this game will get more than 5 million
Bills beat Raiders Raiders beat Chiefs Chiefs beat Bills *Circle is complete*
Love my chiefs but we are becoming a dependent on running.  Patrick doesn't throw deep anymore.  I'm not saying deep ball all the time but we are becoming to conservative with a explosive ass team.
Most depressing game to watch ever bc I got to see Allen regress in real time
Expected more points from Patrick Myhomeboy but at least he still got to 20 points
Le'Veon Bell just got his first win congrats brother
658th comment chiefs wild card push is back on.
Mahomes always manages to pull it off during the 2nd half
It motivates you they way mahomes plays because they defense is intimidated by him.
The amount of bad tackling by the Bills defense in this game was ridiculous...i mean you know you have to tackle right??
Patrick mahomes makes you wish like madden was real life so you could play as him
Chiefs go 12-4 or 13-3 on season and repeat super bowl wins
That's MY SQUAD!!💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💯💯💯💯👊🏿
Bills beat Raiders Raiders beat Chiefs Chiefs beat Bills   I love the NFL
We knew the chiefs were gonna win.
Bills their players don't have the mentality and their young.
Bills can't win against good teams
I think bills go 10-6 or 9-7 on season
Jeez Bills, you just humiliated yourself for the 2nd Week in a Row, the Defense gave Helaire the Best Running Game of his Career so far, you couldn't put pressure on Mahomes, you couldn't stop Kelce. You should be ashamed of yourselves to let this Happen !!!
JOsh Allen incredibly gives up.
As josh allen he totally gives up
Bills got cheated
That’s tuff
Ravens are coming this year .
Hauschka woulda made that half time kick
Did bulls not have any running backs ?  What happened to that Wade guy?
Refs gave bills every possible chance and we just proved we better by far
Am trying to have interest in nfl bet I still find it uninteresting.
I wonder how a Wilson-Mahomes duel Pt2 will go
Yo wtf was 8:12?
Chiefs so good with Edwards helaire they don't need leveon bell
Before anyone starts calling Josh Allen trash, you better sack up and call Lamar Jackson trash too. Let's compare their stats against the KC this year. Lamar was 15/28 for 97 yards 1 TD. He had 83 rushing yards and 2 fumbles. Allen was 14/27 with 122 yards 2 TD and 1 interception. He rushed for 42 yards and no fumbles. I'm not calling either quarterback trash. I just think that KC has a good defense.
This was a game the bills had to win.. especially if they make the playoffs!
Is just me or did they make the highlights longer
Chiefs 5-1
WHat a game I knew it wouldn't be as high scoring from the point.
Bills love dropping people out of bounds
Retire already Joe Buck got damn.
CHIEFS will mix-it-up with Bell.. And THROW to him out of the backfield; WATCH!!!
Maholmes plays like I do in madden
Damnit! Who else missed the game?
Bills defense wanted to lose this game so bad. 😂😂😂👎
Dolphins nipping at the bills heels
Can’t wait for teams to start stacking the box so mahomes can start goin nuts
Josh Allen for MVP!
Good thing I started Miamis D
How about them Chiefs ! 🏈🏆❤️.   Good game Buffalo respect to yal. 👍
All I want for Christmas is for the chiefs to lose.
Bills lookin like pretenders at this point
Chiefs should tank for trevor
Can I get likes 🥴
Hi everyone, I’m living in the Cayman Islands, loving life here, please check out my vlog if you love the beach!   https://youtu.be/FNEFf_QNfho
When you can hear the players WOOO'S when they score :|
Jamal charles in the thumbnail? You will be missed sir
Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Boy hes just a star in the making. Gg to both of these teams.
go chiefs woohoo gg bills good game tho
Need more DBS MAKIN PLAYS LIKE THAT !!! Hella catch
This was a pretty good game
Can we please cut the Josh Allen MVP talk😂😂😂He is average at best
Thats what I call a half-court offense. Make that opposing defense do what you want them to do Patrick what a display.
CEH musta heard Shannon sharpe saying he isnt big enough for hard running styles lmao
Bills defense went from top 5 to the worst in three years
I hate the Chiefs and Mahomes.... I hate them so much. I pray they don’t win another damn Super Bowl.
Bills beat raiders Raiders beat chiefs Chiefs beat bills.........nfl is to unpredictable..
As a Pats fan, thank you Chiefs for beating the Bills.
We got about 3 more weeks before the season is in jeopardy. Mark my words. Also #TitanUp !!
I told people i dont believe in Allen yet. I love his football heart but the mental aspect hes still gotta put together. That final int was just horrible
Is Rex Ryan still available for hire?
The running back for Kansas is trying so hard so leveon bell don't start over him
Wait till Le'veon bell starts!
Everytime i hear a female announcer, i feel like my wife is telling me something to do during the game, that im half listening to
Wow
Chiefs just strolling to the playoffs
Edwards-Helaire played like his job depended on it.
what's up with all these kickers missing extra points
Bro Edwards Elaire is disgusting
What ever I hate the cheifs
Mahomes literally every play: HELEN KELLER!
At least us Bills fans didnt have to worry about traffic leaving the Stadium...thats a plus...
Bills run game needs to get better. Samw with thr defence. Wtf happened in the off-season to the defence? Did it get covid???
Buffalo est un feu de paille et au lieu d'y aller pour 2 au dernier touch,ils foute rien....
Chiefs: Pick up leveon bell   Clyde the glyde AKA OROY: and that's when I took it personally
Bad sportscasting.....dude was not open. He was  being spied by a linebacker. He made a smart play by throwing the ball away.
Buffalo Bill's offensive drives kept getting bailed out by penalties
Dirty dan is underappricated. Dude is a beast.
so i when fro the bills but that was a good game smh................
11:25 no look to robinson no one saw that?
Josh allen: has no turnovers all game  Daniel Sorenson: so that's when I took it personally
This chiefs team ran all over the bills.
seems like this chief offense can make anyone a pro bowler. Bell just put them way over the top.
Now add Leveon Bell......rip every other team
Bills ain't ready for the bigtime.
Helaire is about ta get a ring in his rookie yr
#54 Wilson respect brother ✊ 6:00
Bills d went from top 5 to trassh
who ever is the oc for kc he needs a head coaching job immediately
I would never bet against the cheifs again , The Refs Fasho cheats for that team
Kansas kansas kansas kansas
This game makes me salty as a Raiders fan. Had we not had those costly fumbles, we could’ve had the chance to beat the Bills and had a 4-1 record....
Refs and the nfl love their golden boy so much, giving BS calls all over
Josh Norman is far from his performance at Carolina. He flew by every tackle.
Patrick Mahomes was amazing for the Kansas City offense and Josh Allen was no match for the Chiefs defense.
"One twenty a sut!"
Great game Chiefs....from a die hard fan from Bangladesh.
Ugh. 9 points is the absolute worst amount to lose by. Not a blowout, dull at the end.
Good job chiefs  From Mexico
I wanted the bills to win lol

Chiefs is too much for Bills..
Excellent crowd
Exposing Allen as a mediocre Quarterback.  Slowly people will see it...
Josh Allen didn't play well enough for Buffalo to win. Also the Bills OC has to do a better job at getting Diggs involved in the game plan. 4-2 has the bills in a good position going forward
If you watched the game live, you'd see that Josh Norman dropped what should've been a interception. Its probably that he's dazed since that killer Derrick Henry stiff-arm.
4:43 creepy ass chuckle😂
6:04 whatta guy saving allen
Man its has to be hard to be a Buffalo sports fan. At least you have some teams right? lol
I love Monday night football! Wait, wtf! Monday evening football? 2020 is a weird year in the making. 😂🤣😷
Can someone explain to me what happened to the #3 ranked bills defense from last year? Not just based off of this game, they've been struggling this whole season...
Bruh Clyde Edwards Helaire just murdered the Bills
Dolphins could still win the division
They bogus they not letting my dawg Allen throw the ball the chiefs sum cheaters good game tho😂😂💯
The refs tried to help but the Bills couldn’t keep up with the Chiefs
Unpopular opinion: Chiefs OL saved the Chiefs.
A bummer that a game between two of the biggest arms in the league is ruined by rain. Would have been a much more exciting game without the rain, I think.
that one handed pick was crazy ngl
Cheifs sign bell CEH: hold my apple juice
Bills defence suck
Hot take: Bills are not a top 10 team
Who won?
Now I know who my bills are they only can beat average and bad teams lmao 😂
What did QB say before throwing the football ?
so great so great, just missed all these ads, see them on tv, radio, now youtube, so funking awesome
Edwards-Helaire for OROTY for sure
I bet if the bills defense went up against a damn jv Highschool football team we would still get torched
Ugly game for Buffalo, they’ll bounce back
Another good team=another bills lost! Bills are so overrated.
Glooks chiefs 😂😂😂
Between QB play and the run defense ..whew the Bills seem they was out to lunch this game.
LB Klien needs to be replaced immediately....
Chiefs needed this win,  Now we get Le'Veon Bell* *but we don't really need him
Chiefs will obviously win the West again, That Raiders game will be an aberration by December. The AFC East will be a fun 3 team race tho.
Raidernation all day we gona bust yall ass again
What is your wife trying to tell you when she wears a Cleveland Browns jersey to bed? You aint gonna score
I just watch the real game and my team won
Great teams learn from losses and make the necessary adjustments. I love the way the kc responded. Get the running game going and a lot of short throws. Every play doesn't have to be a dagger. Chiefs gonna be just fine. #runitback
Joe buck so boring. unless its the cowboys, braves, or cubs he has zero emotion in every game (regardless of sport) he announces.
Finally some good news after that NE loss.
The Bills need to trade for a defensive lineman before the deadline.
Bills lose to 2 of the best A.F.C. teams  Miami beats the jets   People: ooooo Miami looking better rn
If CEH doing this what you think Leveon gone do in this offense.... 👀👀👀😳😳
Mian Takeaways of the night has to be Clyde Edwards-Helaire It's pretty clear that Le'Veon Bell will be used only situational. How can you Clyde off the field?
Thats the josh allen all we know. Allen is trash
I'm a fan of Bills and it looks like the dream is over.
Can we stop w/the questions about the Chiefs? They’re going to be fine
Good to see Norman is recovered. If it were me I would have probably retired the next day.
ChIeFs WeRe ExPoSeD...
CEH had a great last game as RB1. Great start to season Rookie future is bright. Bell time rest of way.😂😂
Its incredible that the chiefs receivers are always open
bills defense can't even stop a nose bleed
Bills are playing really bad
Imagine chiefs getting Derek Henry
See y'all in the Super Bowl KC
Chiefs sliding thru just needed ocean spray in their water bottles to make this game complete
Clyde edwards helaire is a source of infinite power no 🧢
Who ever edits these videos is brutal
Let's go Chiefs!!! 🏹 #kingdom 🏹 can't wait to see Bell on the field!!
The chiefs did the same thing the raiders did to them run the ball !!
The Damn Chiefs Corners are getting way too many damn penalties bruh, this game should not have been this close...
Andy Reid was HEATED.
Only if josh Allen throw a little bit better it could have been in ot
Good game KC. You guys have a gem in Clyde.
So we beat the bills but not the raiders??  Cool, cool
Patrick Mahomes: *throws a bad pass* Aikman: man these conditions are tough Josh Allen: *throws a bad pass* Aikman: WOW ALLEN SUCKS THIS IS A STRONG MESSAGE 🍇
I want to see wat he can do without kelce and hill
Another Heart Breaking Lost 😔 well atleast were 4-2
Allowing 240 rushing yards on the ground is just OUTRAGEOUS 😤😤😤
Can someone tell John Buck it pronounce Elaire*
I really admire Patrick Mahomes' cadences I try to attemot it but oh my god it is hard
First 10k
Chiefs: Bayern Munich!  Bills: Atletico Madrid!
Bills overrated to
patriots fan here. thank you chiefs! :D
That hold call and refs didn’t call it.  Wtf?
13:47 As a bills fan, that was just painful to watch. Reminds me of the play watson threw in the wildcard game to win it
Chiefs trash overrated and over hype by ESPN raidernation got yall number shut down Mahomes if he aint have kelce and hill he would be garbage not better then Russell Wilson not better then lamar jackson
Where’s bell Côme on chiefs put em in the game he said he got some to prove lol🤣
이젠 켈시의 시대~!!!
Andy Reid dipped his chicken nuggets in that buffalo sauce 😂
Dog shii
bills suck on primetime!
Edwards-Helaire and Le'Veon Bell are going to tear teams a new one if our o-line gets it together like they did tonight.
Gg chiefs y’all was the better team then my bills
That face shield will forever be a meme
The Chiefs are now a fully loaded team on both sides of the 🏈
patrick Mahomes is the most deadly yep just give it to levon
Bills: We are Unstoppable!  Titans and Chiefs: *Allow us to introduce ourselves*
Remember when everyone said Josh Allen would win MVP.
Chiefs are still the team to beat
Sheesh 😬, Josh Allen looked like a RB today. I know the O-Line wasn't great, but some of those throws were absolutely terrible.
What was Diggs doin at the end 😭💀
Tennessee beat Buffalo by more points than Kansas City. Hol up
The bills are still beating the cheatriots lol.
Stefon Diggs on that last drive played with no effort on the route he was running, and that’s something that really hurt his team
Rooting for yall kc from the bahamas. Lets go!!!! Run it back💪
Josh Allen y’all MVP? 💀
And we did this without a Offensive Line
Me waiting for Christmas
That rushing attack by KC was damn near unstoppable
Andy Reid team running the ball 46 times boy that seems so familiar to Eagles fans!
Kc defense is terrible!  Legend has it kc RB’s are still running through Buffalo.
Mahomes is better than any QB if you disagree go watch soccer or Basketball leave us here
The takeaway from this game is:  Bills are good, just not as good as the Chiefs
1 minute and already 163 views?? Wow.
Andy Reid doesn't lose 2 in a row with Patrick Mahomes
What a wim
Both quarterbacks played aight now it’s time to see the cowboys lose to the cardinal
Didn’t know the bills would self destruct on defense like that
4-TIME SUPER BOWL RUNNER-UP BUFFALO BILLS LOSE TO 2-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION KANSAS CITY CHIEFS
Josh Allen finally came back down to earth, this is the performance I expect from now on😂
Dang
I knew we'd bounce back 🥰 let's see if Pat will get the same praise as Brady tomorrow despite them having about the same type of game 😌
first?
*Josh Allen misses a wide open receiver*  Aikman: “brings back some of those accuracy concerns”  *Patrick Mahomes misses a wide open receiver*  Aikman: “wow these conditions”
Jesus Christ is coming soon to rapture his people repent and accept him as Lord and savior John 3:16 Titus 3:5 Ephesians 2:8-9 Romans 10:9-13 Romans 3:23-24 Romans 6:23 1 Corinthians 15:1-4🙏✝️♥️🙌🕊️
Lol didn't even know that the game already happened
There’s the josh allen we all know and love
Nice
11 view gang!
Such a good game!
Game was pretty lame
Im afraid the bills r gonna be another "facade" team, the dolphins lookin more dangerous right now tbh...

The scary part is Andy Reid is evolving they ran the ball 40 plus times
Mahomes and the Chiefs are looking for back to back Super Bowls.
