RIP Betty White! We'd scheduled this to publish on January 17th to commemorate her 100th birthday, but in light of her passing, we're publishing it today as a tribute!
She's my mostest favorite of all time!!! My cat is nam😅ed Betty
Why don't I like her?..     I don't know.   Everyone in the entire world loves Betty White but me.     ????
Her appearances as the shockingly and eerily blasé killer on "Boston Legal" deserves an honorable mention
I knew her role as Rose Nylund would be number 1. Rose is such an icon, and Betty White couldn't be a better choice for Rose.
Betty white looked my late nan and had her humour rip betty
I love Betty White Sue Ann nivens newscaster audition
🤣🤣🤣🥰
I just ADORE Ms White...always will. Thank goodness for reruns! 😊
The yt dude behind her FUCKED UP HIS FACE.
September 2025 and I really wished she could've been a US president. She had common sense!!  Commodity that doesn't exists anymore..😔
Long live a legend. She will forever be missed. She was exactly what humanity should be
WWE with The Big Show and Betty White, she exclaimed, "I'm here to kick some ASS!!!!"
Her first show was cancelled because she refused to eliminate The black dancer who she show cased on almost every show. The southern TV stations boycotted the show and she didn't care. But, that boycott was enough to get the show cancelled. Arthur Duncan was his name.
ALL OF THEM
I really wanted to watch this until I immediately saw some CGI / AI bullshit
Most of the narration is not needed.
I used to like your videos, but you narrate too much…. I want more of the clips and less of the woman talking. It makes the videos too long.
I blame Betty for my lack of social filter...
Inspire of all the clips, I still can’t tell where acting stops and the real Betty starts
WOW….Betty White…..need I say more?
Lake Placid showed her true range…
A shining light in this weary world. RIH Betty , you will be dearly missed!!❤❤
Betty White was a legend!!
They'll mention WWE, but not 'Lake Placid'?
Awesome Lady
"dead.  dead.  dead"    when she finally won an election for something or other after her opponent died.
The best
O_O ..who can win a price over Betty Freaking White!!?? (All the actors that won) "..please dont tell no body!! O_O"
You got a lot of balls talking over Betty White. Why don't you stfu and let the lady speak for herself?
My name is earl cameos my name is earl cameos my name is earl cameos my name is earl cameos my name is earl cameos my name is earl cameos
She was a National treasure to be sure!
one of a kind ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ always turn a frown upside down........love her
Lake Placid and Bringing Down the House. She is so damn hilarious!
Here is a little known fact. At the time of Betty White's show where the south threw a fit over a black man on it. Was mainly Democrats. You know the ones who started the KKK.
My favorite scene  Sue Ann is on her death bed with it vibrating like a motel bed
One of the few Americans that you can say was in the right place the whole time!
One does not simply cast Betty white for one episode of a show.
All of Betty Whites monents are priceless...She was awesome no matter what she did..I watched her throughout her long career...RIP
I was born in the mid seventies. I didn't see her older stuff but I absolutely loved her in The Golden Girls. Now I have to see if I can find the older stuff! 🎉
I really loved her in the movie “The Proposal” lots of harious stuff there. “Hot in Cleveland” was another long running Betty White hilarious on-going role
In 21:01 it looks like she has a black eye!
She was fabulous in “The Practice.”
We miss you Betty
Favorite..  Snickers ad
Queen Elizabeth: girl I'm so popular they thought I was going to live till the sun blows up! How about you Betty?  Betty White: I'm so popular they thought I was going to live till Jesus Christ came back to earth  Rest in peace Your Majesty and Mrs. Betty White thanks for the love and laughs!🙂
Bleeped out swearing is not only childish, but also makes this totally unwatchable. Don't waste your time punters. ❌❌❌
"Let's see if we can find your boobs"  😂😂😂 omg that took me out.  RIP Ms.  White.  A true legend.
Betty was such a treasure! We are so blessed to have had her on our tvs. Her work with animals was just as amazing.  There will never be another human like her. 💜💜
All I have to say,is go Betty,,not taking no shit❤RIP
I have an odd opinion: if there were to be a biopic about Betty, I believe Julia Louis-Dreyfus would be a perfect casting. But no matter who would be casted, I'd be down to watch it. Betty is an ICON.
I love what you do
Even now, I still miss Betty White. Fortunately, I have the complete DVD sets of the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Goden Girls. So at least I can get my daily fix of Betty.
Oh Betty, I miss you!
Such a lovely human being in every way. One of my faves with her-I wasn't into "Golden Girls"-was her recurrent role on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Brilliant! Plus, she was a perennial supporter of furry creatures...what is not to love about that???
I love to laugh ! Thankyou for Betty White today ! My face hurts good for laughter ! Peace to all in 2025 ! I love animals too!!!Laughter is one of my JOYS 🥸🐾🐾🐾💕♥️🌬️🌬️🌬️🌬️🌬️🦋🦋🦋🦋
I just watched the sketch "Census taker vs. old lady". It was outstanding. SHE was outstanding!!!
Also loved her in Boston Legal and as Mrs Miracle❤
I worked at the Sheridon Columbus as a guess agent.🎉Ms. White was checking in and I asked her for her ID. Lol and she gave it to me. she was in her 70's it was in Columbus Ohio.I am Kimberly R. Mason
I think the Roast of William Shatner should have mentioned... but anyway, she was one of the funniest people I have ever seen.
favorite moments?  all of them.  she and Ryan Reynolds are a match to be loved
What a joy to see Betty White in her element, making people laugh. Rip
We lost a great friend
I'm not surprised that people in the South threatened to boycott Betty White's show because of the talented black singer/dancer Arthur Duncan. The South is still full of ignorant, hateful racists. They're still fighting the Civil War! They teach their children how to be racists. That's why they support donald and elon and the rest of the Republican White Christian Nationalists. All that hate has to eat away at them, causing health issues and early deaths, I believe.
How many "First Lady of Television" are there? Betty White or Lucille Ball?
The best. Such a wonderful animal advocate for animals.♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😇😇😇😇🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Sue Ann Nibbins was a nymphomaniac. It was hilarious.
The Ryan Reynolds one is creepy now that we know how he thinks
The Ryan Reynolds one is creepy now that we know how he thinks
Ryan Reynolds, and this is creepy. Now that we know how he thinks cause he thinks this about all of his costars and everybody in the world he thinks where his enemies
Ryan Reynolds, and this is creepy. Now that we know how he thinks cause he thinks this about all of his costars and everybody in the world he thinks where his enemies
An amazing actress with a personality that shined!
Ohmigosh such a talented woman, and gawd I love her great face
She paved the way for so many female comedians and will be missed but she’s with her beloved husband now
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think the picks were right, but something should have been said about her pet bear.
ANNOYING NARRATOR TALKS MORE THAN NECESSARY !!!I WANT TO HEAR BETTY WHITE NOT HER !!!!!
I now confess as a young boy I watched a few episodes of Golden Girls just to catch up some good insults from Sophia 😂
Lake Placid! She was epic!
Love Betty White, and I will always miss her. RIP sweet lunatic ;)
Love her, she will never he duplicated...her talent, kindness, and sassiness!!! Rest In Peace...enjoy time with your husband again!!
I love it when “Bawdy Betty” comes out to play!
Here's to Betty white ❤
I loved how she could be warm and loving and absolutely vicious vulgar and down right Mean... but we all know she isn't wrong
I'm going to quote Betty now, because that's my personal perspective. It's none of my business
She was only 17 days away from turning 100 before she died. The end of 2021 marked the end of her life.
I can't believe that you really tried to make out that, she and Ryan Reynolds were really feuding, they loved eachother
Betty will live on in our hearts!
I still miss her. An amazing woman, with incredible talent.
Why would you use a clip of Jesse James. He is a horrible person who did bad things.  You did a video about an amazing woman. He does not belong in this video. Thank you
i miss her so much 💔😥😔
She invented the word pookie ❤
Betty White was not supposed to be  dead 😅 . She's supposed to stay here for
This made me tear up. She was a treasure. I miss her ❤
Her roast of William Shatner is, to me, comedic gold.  Miss her so much!
This made me laugh and cry. A true jewel.
My first memory of  Betty White is "Date with an Angel" with Bill Williams.  I was about 9, and fascinated by it.  Would have been nice if it had been mentioned here
I love Betty White, she often reminded me of my own grandmother who died too young (she was 71). So when I heard Betty died it was close to grieving a relative. Betty was a rare star, it's unlikely we'll see someone like her again in our lifetime.
We haven't LOST Betty White, we GAINED a guardian angel to protect and defend us for all eternity, @MsMojo!
I always god a Godless vibe from her. Now it's confirmed. What a sad waste of life and platform.
So many times you all have a good topic and ruin it with your babbling instead of showing what the subject did or created. 🤨
Miss her....I'm not for internet/computers.....yet allows me to see her when I type her name....RIP funny lady....you are STILL hilarious!
the defition of ICON
Your videos are the best. Thank you! 🎄
While on Golden Girls, she told a St Olav story, The Great Herring War, almost all of those stories, and so much of her time as Elka Ostrovsky on Hot in Cleveland
She was brilliant and one of a kind! RIP Betty.
Her in Lake Placid was great
Betty White walked away from a modeling and acting career to volunteer and serve as a truck driver in the Army in WW2.
"ALL THREE Betty White Shows"? EVERY show she was in was The Betty White Show. Betty OWNED TV from the start.
A wonderful treasure to us all!
I loved Betty White, she just had such an amazing happiness about her. She was always full of joy ❤
Thank you,  for educating and putting together this awesome compilation of the greatest long standing iconic star!!😂😢😮😅😊
I wasn't aware that she shared the love of animals with Rose irl. I love her the most for that ❤
I would hate to think of the many millions  upon millions of Happy Tears this Golden Lady Of Comedy has caused from making people laugh. I would of loved to have seen Betty White and Robin Williams do a movie together.
You forgot White's performance in the 2011 Hallmark movie, The Lost Valentine.  This was a straight dramatic role, in which she was excellent.
There will never be another Betty White, Just like Betty said, there will never be another Alan, "Once you've had the best" lol   My how I loved her, young till her death, she had the best humor
How about Tim Daly making a pass at Betty from  across the room...
Betty White is an ABSOLUTE national treasure.
Betty is the reason the name "Betty" became a positive slang term, and delightfully we can't take any of her alleged "views" (opinions) seriously because she always went for the biggest laugh, and nothing more.  America has lost it's sense of humor as our inability to laugh at our absurd politicians proves, but Betty never forgot how to take a joke and have a laugh.
She died about 2 weeks short of her 100th birthday! She gave us DECADES of entertainment. What an iconic lady she was! She made me laugh so much with her Ryan Reynolds bit. 😂
If you didn’t like or love Betty White there is something really wrong with you. Including Bea Arthur
The first time I ever seen her cuss in Lake Placid where she tells the cop " If I had a d*_×k I'd tell you to suck it's I never expected to here her say that and it was funny as all get out I fell out my chair
Thank You for this video. I miss Betty White Rip
We miss you Betty!
Earth got Betty for nearly 100 years but now Heaven has her for eternity! We love you Betty!
The one and only! Loved her!
Love her even more. RIP  Betty,trailblazer and a true legend !!❤
❤ REST IN PEACE BETTY WHITE. LOVE HER IN THE PROPOSAL 😂
It has to do with societal norms.  That lifestyle degregates civilization.
I'm glad her presence is cemented in decades of films
I want to hear how Luciana felt out of her mouth🎉 to have been able to do a music video with Betty white... I. Jealous!!
Its Morgan Freeman
Betty white is the best from the golden age . She will live on forever.. Betty white is a legend
If she got a a shoutout for the proposal I gotta give her a shoutout for Grandmas Boy.
Where was her line in lake placid? After she said it the. Entire movie theater gasped went silent then erupted with cheers!   Way to go Betty!  I will always remember that
21:03 what's wrong with her eye?
An absolute legend!!!!....And extremely brilliant comedian!!   I would have loved to have met her for just a few seconds!
Betty White is still the GOAT!
Betty you were amazing, wonderful person,❤😢 and are surely missed.  R.I.P.
The episode of Golden Girls where Rose tells a story of The Herring Circus… it was completely off-script and ad lib. Dorothy and Blanche could not hold it together! It is ALL BETTY!! The best ❤
The episode of Golden Girls when Rose (Betty) tells the story of the Herring Circus…. It is hilarious and she tells it with a straight face. I read it was off-script and all ad lib. Dorothy (Beatrice) and Blanche (Rue) could not hold it together.  It’s ALL BETTY!❤
Muffin
I have enjoyed many of your videos...and this one is a very special treasure. You captured Ms. White for us all. Thank you!
Ms White represented the very best we can be. Rarely does a celebrity elicit such genuine love . To do it over multiple generations is astounding. She truly was a very special gift, and the world is considerably emptier without her.
I loved her on the game show with her husband! They were perfect together!❤
Betty was  never attractive 😮
I thought she was really funny in the movie Lake Placid but they didn't mention it.
Aún ahora cuando ya no cumple años la sigo eligiendo, lo vi todo, una genia maravillosa, esas 3 en The Golden Years sublime ❤
Betty White was one of the few celebrities that was truly universally loved. We all lost something when she passed
Let's make America Betty White again.
Let's make America Betty White again.
Saturday Night Live
Betty White.  One of the most disgusting celebrities in Hollywood. Her 80 year old potty mouth making sexual bad jokes was pathetic.  I mean, what kind of Perv thinks an old woman talking dirty is cute or funny?
Betty White was one of those ladies where you could watch, set your cheek to your hand, and smile. She is missed.
The Betty White SNL hosting was the best! We all were asking for it for years and the fact that she  did it and delivered. We love you Betty❤
Watching this brought tears to my eyes. She was f*cking awesome and I am so happy to see her get her due and how everyone in Hollywood acknowledged her during those award ceremonies. She is sorely missed!!!!!
If you don’t love Betty then you have “bleep” problem.
I miss this lady. ❤
Her best friend was Lucille Ball. Remember the line "You don't buzz a legend " when Lucille was buzzed once.
Thank God for Betty White!
I love her on golden girls she was a good actress
We still miss you.  This world isn't the same without your light.
I cancel, even if it’s free I cancel! !!….. 😩😩😩😩😩😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can you believe that Carol Burnette is 91? Carol and Betty, two stars who we will never stop loving.
I don't think there was anything she couldn't do. Incredible lady !
Lake Placid🤣🤣
Betty White is forever the people’s choice ❤❤❤❤❤🙏
I love Betty White when she was on the show 'My wife and kids' episode,  she played like a Mary Poppins character.
Schwetty Balls should have made list
She's the one!!!
🤣🤣🤣😘
❤ betty miss her
The lost valentine should have been on this list, and near the top. It was great.
I think you left out one of her best - the movie Lake Placid, her character as the foul-mouthed old lady feeding the giant crocodiles. That was hysterical and completely against what everyone expected of her.
❤ MY FAVORITE BETTY WHITE MOMENT ARE 2 EPISODES SHE CAME OUT IN THE SIMPSONS
Rip.betty white
She seemed to enjoy seeing others succeed...
She was willing to laugh at herself. Never pretentious, always humble...
The greatest female comic in the world!    She was such a beautiful lady.
The laughing hyena joke "😂 they don't usually point"....had me cracking up! CLASSIC
We need you back today Betty.  ❤
She was soooo wonderful!!! ❤ Thank you #BettyWhite 🙏🏼🌹😇
Good for Betty White for keeping Duncan.
A true legend. Thank you, Ms. White ❤️🧡💛💚💙🩵💜
Betty White was so iconic. I'd want her as my grandma if I didn't already have the best grandma. Well, she can be my paternal grandma. My real paternal grandma was a jerk and institutionalized before right before I was born.
When she feeds the Alligator in Lake Placid
She was a treasure... a legend.... will forever be remembered....
#17 ... That's very true - It's none of anyone else's business.  So, why do they spend so much time and energy trying to tell us about it?!
Scared straight with Kenan
Tou are a legend ❤.  Extremely missed  I believe everyone in heaven is laughing now. I know your making the angels laugh. God bless your soul Betty.❤❤❤❤❤
She truly *_was_* a national treasure! Beautiful, smart, kind and funny. RIP , with love.
I think Julia Louis Dreyfus would do a great job of playing Bettys life in a movie.
What an icon she was and still is.  R.I.P. Betty - we loved and we miss you so much.
Strange, Betty White never mentioned anything about the town of Carleton next door to St. Olaf.
#1  isn't a moment. It's a job...Especially since they acknowledge the Golden Girls from the very, very begenning.  ***Here**** would be where I mitigate my complaint and turn it into comedy like Betty, however, I am not her.
It was shocking to find out Betty White and Barbara Bush were sons of Aleister Crowley.
Morgan Freeman's reaction when she appeared was pure happiness 🤗
Betty White,  along with the test of the GG cast,  is the best!  She is truly missed!
the Simpsons appearance? This is the only reference I have   From this video she is definitely a legend though  RIP Betty White   The Morgan freeman appearance made me weep
Betty was also on the radio in the late 1940's or early 1950's performing as Melissa Dragoon on a local Los Angeles station.
WOW.....what an incredible human being! YES! Betty White was and still is a National Treasure. We are the lucky ones to have been blessed to witness  her humanity and talent. Rest in peace you beautiful soul.💋💋💋❤
Oh LORD TY FOR BETTY WHITE, She Was Absolutely Beautiful inside & out. Miss her Immensely. RIP Betty Hope U & Allen R having FUN N HEAVEN!
I've like many actors but many of them disappointed me .she never did. She was so amazing, kind
Betty white is the sunniest
Miss you Betty!  Always a delight to see you on my screen!
❤ missed too much
My mom's and my favorite Betty White movie was stopped or my mom will shoot
She was wonderful,  and even though i didn't know her personally i feel that she was one of those genuine people that are just as nice in person as the characters they played
Your commentary on all your clips are so intrusive as to make them unwatchable. Make it about your subject and less about your own nonsense.
I found her delightful in Bones.  Mr. Happy!  Lol
She knew we loved her.  I'm glad.
😊 8:05
I was happy That my mom introduced me to The golden girls
I miss you sweetheart ❤❤❤❤❤
You left out her role in Clear Lake. She and that alligator still make me laugh!
OMG she was SO funny. If there were any show/skits/project with her, George Burns , and Robin Williams we need to throw that bomb at our enemies. They would be laughing so hard they couldn't fight back .
I gave a persuasive speech for a Public Speaking class about why you should adopt rather than shopping for a pet. Betty White naturally was mentioned.
Betty always will be missed. Thank you for all your wonderful work and all the laughs! R.I.P. Betty!!! ❤️🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️
How could they not put in lake placid? "If I had a d**k, this is where I'd tell you to suck it" lol loved her in that movie
A+ list of
Well, she scratched that curiosity she had about death 😊
You left out her and Joan Rivers going at each other on the Tonight Show - multple times!
One of my favorite was movie she did with Steve Martin and Queen Lattiah  were she said" I hear Negroes" ! So hilarious so irony this Angel stood up for Blacks at the cost of one of her jobs. Great American amazing Human being.
She was and will always be a global treasure🎉❤ RIP Betty White
She's a legend.
Funny I was just thinking about Betty White New Year's
Thank you for being a friend, travel down the road and back again. Your heart is true, you’re a pal and a confidant, and if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say “Thank you for being a friend.” R.I.P The Golden Girls 💔🕊️
Love Betty, may she R.I.P.🌺  Did she ever work in radio?
What a beautiful person the true meaning of living your best life!!!!
I won a trip to The Ellen Show. Betty White was the guest. I got to see her in person.
Betty White was truly amazing. RIP, sweet lady!
Betty White was the absolute best.  I loved how she could make us laugh at the most random things.  Betty, you will always hold a special place in all our hearts ❤
Betty was on tv with the Betty White Show in 1954, the year i was born. She's been with me my entire life. Even though she passed just before her 100th, it was still a shock when they announced she was gone. What a lady! I miss you Betty. ❤
McGruber's grandmother was hilarious
There's a drag show Golden girls theater performance and I've never wished to see something more in my life ❤️
She promoted black artist, she fought for LGBTQ+  rights, and she loved animals, if anyone was going to make it to heaven, it was Betty.  Plus she had no flinch, no matter what was flying at her face she didn't blink.
RIP Betty!!
Betty's not only beautiful but she's got such a great smile & those dimples are really make her stand out. The last Golden Girl Betty you are truly missed.
I wish I could've met this beautiful angel in real life but instead I will just celebrate her life and enjoy her legacy which is her personality and work on screen. Everyone in my family and friends loved Betty White and were extreme fans.
need to watch the proposal now lmao "to the windows to the wall"
she is the golden girl.
6:45 in and im like "wait... people dont like color." Crayola get ready.
She was amazing and did whatever she wanted and even more. I'm glad she received all the recognition of all her piers while she was still breathing and I celebrate all her legacy and wonderful way of being. She was and will always be a G.O.A.T.
My only complaint is she died to young!
Hot in Cleveland!!!!!! Fabulous!!!!!!
Betty is definitely the GOAT!   The best/funniest TV ad of all time is your #4 choice:  The Snickers ad.    It still makes me cry laughing.  RIP  Lovely Betty
💔🫂💜
What a sweet hurt 💔  that call a stars 🌟
She was a beautiful woman bk in those day   she still are
How can you not ❤ Betty White!!! Such a incredible actress, activist, and all around wonderful human! You are missed great lady! ❤
I miss her so much!😭
She was never one to blow her own “flatoogan vloogan “
We lost a true legend when Betty left us ! Her career will never be matched again ! RIP, Betty!
Hey, MsMOJO! A little late to the game on this vid, but FYI: Letterman NEVER put real liquor in ANY bottle he drank from. It was always water, b/c he had a bit of a drinking problem in his 20s. So, when you say "once the booze starts flowing, things get even funnier" -- the only thing flowing was H2O!
I literally shouted at God "that's some dirty ass shit, you did" when she passed right before she turned 100. Then cried like a big baby before I realized she lived the uck out of her life and I had no reason to feel sad! This is coming from a Black girl from the hood. How can you not love her?
Such a great lady! We all miss you Betty! You’ll always be loved! Always standing up for the underdog  and people under  persecution. RIP with Alan. 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Betty was a national treasure!! RIP Betty White, we miss you dearly!
Actually there are two, both with Sandra Bullock. The boops 😂 And the scene on the awards in 2010. 😊
Betty White singing lets get it on with zack efron right behind her was hilarious especially zacks facial expressions
If the LGB community would keep it “secret” as she said, or private in their home cool. But indoctrinating the kids- that’s a line not to be crossed.
I'll forever miss betty white, she was a shining star in our darkening world and it's just a bit darker now without her. Her memory will live on though!!!
When Betty passed away Americans lost  their grand ma
Hot in Cleveland...with bender over bloopers
This world will never be the same
She was just so authentic ❤ What a treasure
Betty was truly one of the best !!!🥰🥰🥰😊😊😊😊😇😍🤗🤗❤️❤️😘😘👍👍👍👍
TY for honoring a true legend. PEACE Ms. White!🎉❤
I miss Betty White! 😭😭😭  May she always be remembered and may she rest in peace 🕊️💐
Her deal with Jason Mamoa was just a hoot.  They were so cute together.  Reminded me of my days of an old woman with the younger men.
Lake Placid uncensored... She told the cops if she has a dik she would tell him to suck it!!! Roflmao Hahahahahaha lololol 😁
Betty is immortal! I love her.
Betty ded
I am old enough to see her from the beginning to the end.  Believe me we lost a national treasure.
❤❤❤ Fly high, Ms Betty You are missed & loved by all❤❤❤
There just aren't the words to express how much of an impact Betty made on so many lives. She's one of the Greatest Wonders of the World. Truly a National treasure. God needs to make more just like her. RIP Betty. I will always remember how you always made me laugh.
My father told me that in the late 40s when he was stationed in San Diego by the Navy that Betty White had a show on TV.  She had a make believe dinosaur or dragon (?) that was never seen but that she would always look up like she was talking to said critter. We both loved Betty. ❤️Comic genius!
O God, Betty isn't here to celebrate her 100th b-day, we all missed her. RIP 😺😻😭
Betty White is one of the greatest comedy actresses EVER
A beautiful soul that showed us how to live a compassionate, giving, joyful life.  She will always be my all-time favorite.
Great video! You missed her most iconic appearance though. Lake placid wouldn't have been much with out her.
She also played on a couple of episodes of Bones!!!
Betty White was like an aunt!
One of her best lines as Sue Ann Nevins was when she was crying that a younger woman was after her job by sleeping with the boss.  When Mary questioned how that could be true,  Sue Ann responded,  "That's how I got it."
What a national treasure as the late Gavin McLeod noted!🪅🪅🪅🪅
My favorite Betty White character was in Lake Placid.
She was literally the only white woman with a V.I.P. Black Card okay. She was invited to all the BBQ cookouts with open arms, this woman was truly loved by all and will be very missed. ❤❤❤👼👼Rest In Power Ms. Betty White👼👼❤❤❤
She is just a legend!
I didn't know she swears.😂
She wasn’t cast as Blanche. She wanted to play Blanche. I could be mistaken
R.I.P
You missed her visit to Jimmy when she played beer pong and "flashed" Jimmy!!!  I thought I would die I laughed so hard!  She was one incredible woman and is missed every day. Rest in love and laughter Ms. White. ❤
*It was a very sad day for all of us when her light went out*  We love you, Betty!
I love betty white she is a superhero to us old ladies!!! imn50 now i would love to be her age and still totally in charge ! and she lived an amazing life ....if i would be like most and t all there i would want to bee done! she was awesome!!!! my all time  hero!!!!!
I also loved her hilarious security video for Air New Zealand!
ms mojo. too much explanation😪
I miss her.
I loved her St. Olaf stories.
I may be 30, but I want to be like Betty White when I grow up.
real queen
what a doll
I liked her snickers adds  the foot ball one I think of a lot
If there isn't something you can't find to love about this woman, there is no help for you.
She lived such a long life and it still feels like she died too soon. What an amazing woman she was
Whodathunkit that it was possible to love her even more!?!?
I watched the Mary Tyler Moore show while growing up. Those nights were the best and Betty White was hilarious!!!
A sweetheart and a treasure..... RIP Lovely Lady
No arguing with Rose being #1. And in that line of humor, my choice for second has to be her appearances on The Mary Tyler Moore show. I loved that sitcom. And the episodes with her are the most memorable.  🕊️RIP 🕊️ BETTY WHITE 🕊️
Rebecca of MsMojo, I loved Betty White, still love her, and will always love her. Her passing away jolted me like Robin Williams’s passing jolted me. My daughter loved her, too.
Betty White. To know of her and her personally was to love her! Enough said, about a century of this Great Lady! R.I.G.
I have always been a fan of Betty White. Oh how she is missed!💞
Remember Betty White from The Golden Girls! RIP BETTY WHITE! We will miss you!💌
When she passed away, I was bummed. Before she passed away, at the height of the Pandemic, she kept asking her manager about getting back to work. Personally, I think the Pandemic took her and Alex Trebek, although neither one died from Covid-19. If she was working, perhaps someone would’ve noticed that she was having a health problem.
I always considered Betty a force of nature and when she was gone the world would have a huge hole in it.  I was right......❤❤
The “feud” with Ryan Reynolds was an obvious joke. It was a marketing gambit, and everyone was in on it.   AND THIS IS WHY EVERYONE THINKS MS MOJO IS A STEAMING PILE OF GARBAGE.
Queen of all she surveyed. So many people will miss her, including myself.❤
Morgan Freeman had the best gift ever getting a personal performance from Betty.  Of course, if anyone deserves it, it's him.  He's another amazing person.
Betty White AND Leslie Jordan in Boston Legal.  That was great!
She was an only child, and never had children. Her genetics ended with her 🥺
The heck w "100 years"... Betty White 100%.
You forgot that she did an episode on *Community* (Anthropology 101).
Betty White will always be a legend! I still watch the Golden Girls on Disney+
T                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          here will never be another Betty  White. was always looling for the " secect"  after life.   looking foward  too it myself!                                                                 shee was looking for the secret afterlife.. so am I!. Love ya, Betty.!
You forgot she was on The Golden Girls
One time (1980ish) she was on Carson with a small stuffed dog. As she stroked the dog's back, its tail began to stiffen and rise. She made a sweet comment like "that's not all that can rise like that if you stroke it." Johnnie either didn't get it or was professional enough to see that any reaction from him would immediately lead to desaster. He calmly went on.
Every time I see her I 😢 cry. She is so terribly missed, her laughter, her witty comments, just her big personality of being Betty just speaks volumes.
There are many great actresses out there, but Betty White outshined them all. I wish we could have had her around for a bit longer. She deserved to live to 100 and then some. Such a class act!❤
👩🏻‍💻When Betty White is singing to honor Morgan Freeman at the 39th AFI Lifetime Achievements and figures out where Clint Eastwood is during her performance and begs him to call her after the show. AND Carol Burnett's "Eunice" to Betty White's "Ellen."🙋‍♀️🥰🇺🇲🇬🇧
I would have married her, if I could.
I absolutely loved her. I wish I got to meet her. We, your fans, will always love you.  RIP Betty💐💐💐💐💐
Rose Nyland is the absolute bomb!
You left out her role in "Lake Placid"?!  WTH?
I was so pissed that Smuckers didn't give her an honorable mention. They did it for the guy who started the thing but not our national treasure
I liked her in everything I've seen her in but my favorite is on Mama's Family.
I miss you Betty. You were the best of the best. A legend in your own time. Rest in peace.
When she met Jason Momoa ❤
Thanks Betty! You have always made me smile.
The best one isn't there. "Once you go BlacKberry" - Look it up folks in " Hot in Cleveland. I grew up with her and watch her from the 60's until she passed. She was a real Broad, and that is a compliment.
Wht bout when she hopped in he shower with crson
R.I.P Betty White, The Queen of Comedy and Golden Legend 👑👑.
Her appearance on the Roast of William Shatner was tour de force!
Luv her S.I.P 💓
Grammy Norma 🤗
A complete one-off, a marvelous freak of nature wax Betty White - many, many thsnks, Betty, you made the world smile !
Watching this just makes me miss her even more. RIP Betty! ♥
rest well Queen you are already missed
When u. Paly in. The TV  show mama family
How about the "Golden Palace" series, after the "Golden Girls" went off the air?
lol
Fun
she has always been beautiful!
If Betty White could live another century I would want to enjoy some time with her in those years. I will miss you Betty White the queen of humour. She could make anyone happy. 99 years wasn't long enough for you. May you fly high in the next life.
I think my favorite Betty White moment was when she was in Lake Placid as the foul-mouthed old lady who lived on the lake. When she called a cop "officer fuckmeat" and said "if i had a dick, here's where i'd tell u to suck it" i almost pissed my pants laughing in the theater lmao. Something about sweet little old ladies cussing makes me happy in a deep, primal part of my brain like a kid on christmas 🤣🤣
Better respect Betty
Reynolds and white were in The Proposal together way b4 deadpool😂 oh they showed it
EVERY MOMENT WITH AND OF BETTY WHITE IS A TREASURE...I WILL LOVE HER FOREVER...RIP FUNNY LADY, I WILL LOVE AND MISS U FOREVER...💔💔💔
Balls of STEEL as a (1) woman in the 50’s (2) in show business (3) letting a black man get air time (4) then telling the rednecks and execs to “suck it” (5) and give him more air time??  #wayaheadofhertime
I loved her in Bringing Down the House
oh wow I didn't know that the actress that played Blanch on the Golden girls was also on the Caral Bernette show with Betty White I used to watch the Golden girls a lot with my mom they were all so perfect in that show
Never will there ever be another lady like Betty White. She never gets old 😀❤
One of my Heroes!  The only thing missing is her great line in, 'Lake Placid'. A True Classic!
Still missing Betty White. Hilarious and wise. Loved her heart and attitude. ❤️❤️❤️
Betty was a true lady and a icon of anything she did.
If I didn't know better and someone told me that Betty was Ryan reynolds grandma, I would totally believe it cuz they're practically the same!
A Golden Goddess!!
And all she wants now is out of hell
I don't think I have ever seen this wonderful woman without wearing something beautiful and that stays on her beautiful to. Many actors could take lessons.
I'm so glad she got to keep her mind and Spunk thru her later years. A shiny new penny all the way. ❤️
Hilarious comedy
Happy 101 birthday Betty White🎉
Rlp
100 YEARS OF FABULOUS GOLDEN BETTY  NOW NO ONE CAN TOP THAT ⭐️
I cannot believe her appearances on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson didn't rate a place on the list! And animals should have had a bigger mention honestly. I absolutely adored watching all these moments!
Gorgeous on both the inside and out
See totally inspires me even now.  Awesome lady
I love that she stood up to the racist poeple and kept Arthur on the show!
When she died a light went out in the world. What a beautiful soul and trailblazing queen of TV and entertainment! RIEP Miss Betty White ❤️
One year later, Betty's passing is still hard to believe. Dead or alive, Thank You, Betty White, for always being a friend.
SHE WAS AN ICONN
I loved the way she delivered the line, "That's not what your girlfriend said."
Betty White in black and white super young is amazing. Her indomitable spirit was always there!
0:01 She had no idea, in 1954, just how much past she'd end up with in the end.
If there’s anyone I could bring back to life with necromancy…
Golden girls
She almost made it to a hundred.
I love me some Betty White.
America's national treasure.  This is one of the funniest women in show business.  She did what she wanted to and in the way she wanted to and really didn't care what people thought.  She was out to have g Fun. 🙏
She was so beautiful, more ways then one
RIP BETTY! you're the best!
It's just a D/L, so who cares? We are so glad this D/L is d*@d.... That's another less D/L voter to worry about.
I didn't know she was this awesome. rest in heaven. I wish you'd be immortalized here on earth.
Rip Betty
I love her in the golden girls
Betty was such an incredible champion for civil rights, gay marriage, and of course, animals. She was rich and famous most of her life, but nobody has ever said one negative thing about her. What an absolute star. Her "Live with it!" about Arthur Duncan was so badass.
I used to wake up every mornin, and check to be sure that Betty White was still alive, and that Trump was dead. Then one dreadful morning, I woke up to find that Betty had died. Trump was still alive. I am still not over it. I never will be. Because even when Trump dies, Betty will not come back. Are you listening God? It's me, Savage.
I loved the scene on Mary Tyler More show when Murrey resigns as her assistant and plops her on top of a cake, on the Sue Ann Nivens Show , her comment was “ it could have used a bit more sugar”……just such dry humour
RIP to probably one of the nicest and most down to earth people in the entertainment business! Also, am I crazy or is the house in the Carol Burnett show scene the same as Howard's mom's house on the Big Bang Theory?
Who tf is Betty White and why am I even here
Her appearances on Craig Ferguson were always great. Especially the one where she wanted to run for president lol
I loved her so much. Used to watch her shows with my grandma. She is going to be missed sooooo much. 🥺
I miss you 😘
Epic!
Thank you for being a friend Betty White
Wow. I had no idea she had such a long storied career. Impressive!
Love Betty White ❤❤
Zac Elfron
I like the moment from The Lorax
Her St Olaf stories on the Golden Girls.
Betty was, indeed, one of a kind. A national treasure she was, is, and always will be. She could've lived another hundred years and that still wouldn't have been long enough.🐞
We love you Betty White, R.I.P.
She was, and still is, such a legend
golden girls, she was so funny, and hot in cleveland, she said it as it was.
She was always thankful, never took her success for granted. a class act
Her live interactions with Joan Rivers show her wit.
It makes me tear up realizing she's no longer with us, but on the other hand, she'll always be with us.
Betty was a blessed woman till her last day she will be missed
she is such a pure soul❤
We miss her SO MUCH… we didn’t deserve her when she was here but god could we use her wit and care right now… I KNOW she is up there giving someone an earful for us with a cheeky grin
Hey, i'm not dead!
I used to be a fan of her but now I'm not. I just watched a documentary on how many people she divorced. Basically because they weren't famous what a f****** Gold Digger
The final golden girl is dead but will never be forgotten. I'm always crying when listening to the show's theme song, but those four ladies are jamming it in heaven. STAY GOLDEN!
I miss her 😰
Her parts in community> I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA
This got me so emotional. what an amazing person.
We all should be gone before Betty
My favorite role from Betty was Sueann,  the Happy Homemaker.  Only seconded by Rose on The Golden Girls.
I just relized that yall posted this the same day she died
You only live 99 years with your entire Mind in tact, when your heart is loving, caring, laughing and bright! What a beautiful soul. We'll love you forever & always Betty! Rest in sweet peace.
R.I.P Legend❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can’t believe BETTY WHITE! Hosted WWE RAW!
Honored to have known this great lady!
Lake placid I'm routing the alligator
I'm trying to find a tv commercial..1970's or 80's.. didn't Betty White do a commercial about spaying or neutering dogs and cats and shows a dog licking her face all over!? Was that her, or was it Dinah Shore or......? Doris Day? I don't quite remember.....
I love her in golden girls💘
Miss Betty White and I think alike.  I don’t care if someone is gay or anything.  That’s their business not mine.  If you respect me and I’ll respect you right back.  No matter what.
In The Golden Girls, they say it was Dorothy who was the savage one, but in Truth it was Rose all along!...as Betty White i would say
Census taker
say what ever you want
too much of YOU talking and NOT betty, wtf
I won't forget that she voice grandma from the Lorax!🥺🥺🥺
the whole American world
Rip
A common theme in her later work seems to be appearing on a show for a "one-time" appearance and then spending multiple seasons on the same show. Betty was the best. The world is a little darker without her.
I Loved and adored Ms. White!!
I just think that she wants to celebrate her 100th birthday with Allen. We have her for a long time and I'm grateful for that 😌❤️
Lmao she deserved it 😂
I wish she was still alive so,  after seeing this,  i could tell her how hot HELL is going to be.  She should be ashamed of her speech.  She was a terrific actress and a horrible person.
Why talk over the clips we wanna see her not hear this lame voice over ugh
We will miss you miss Betty white
In " THE PROPOSAL", WHEN SANDRA RIDES UP ON A BICYCLE  AND BETTY'S  DOING WHAT LOOKS  LIKE A NATIVE AMERICAN DANCE, OFF BEHIDE SOME BUCHES, SANDRA JOINS HER, AND THEY END UP DANCING,  WHEN RYAN RENOLDS WALES UP ON THE TWO OF THEM.
I think it's no exaggeration to say that she was America's grandma, and maybe even the world's, in her later years. It's amazing how she outlived the other three Golden Girls by more than a decade even though she was the oldest among them, and even more so how she continued her career in that time, very well into her 90s. She and I have both been passionate about such causes as animal rights and LGBT rights. She will be much missed, and she has gone from us much too soon despite her almost 100 years on Earth. May her memory be such an everlasting blessing, and may her soul ascend into heaven!
RIP my queen ❤
I’m not crying… you’re crying!   Long live the Queen of television. 👑
Her role in proposal is the best!!
Betty white was gangsta ..Their will never be another Betty white .Her beautiful bad ass will be missed .R.I.P Betty .Have fun up there with my siblings and the rest of my loved ones .
I miss her.
Ugh..❤
Snickers ad should’ve been number #1
Betty White was one of the few people in a lifetime that comes along and endeared herself to absolutely every person that crossed her path.She had so many talents for entertaining us--her acting,quick wit,her sassiness,and most of all,her genuine love of people and life.She stayed current as times changed,and only got better with age.Who DIDN'T love Betty White?Miz Betty,thank you for all the laughter,joy,and memories of a life so well lived!My heart will keep you with me always... RoyBoy
My favorite Betty White moment was when she made a rap video I always die laughing
I loved everything about her but most of all her up in your face in her personality as she got really old.  Of our e her in the mtm show, anyone that didn’t know her was now guaranteed to know her, the start of her really super star status ❤️❤️
betty white has to be among the sweetest woman you would have ever met
What an icon 👑👑👑👑✨✨✨✨
Betty White was born closer to Beethoven’s 9th Symphony than 2022
I miss her sm she was the goat
One of the funniest women I've ever seen on tv and movies. She had a good run.
We love u Betty white ❤️❤️❤️
She was truly an American treasure!
she was too young to die.
I love Betty white she is so awesome and amazing let her rest in peace ☮️
I always thought that hot in Cleveland was a modern version of golden girls
Lake Placid" most favorite appearance
So sad she is gone but you can't help but smile and laugh! Great review of her life!
R.I.P. Betty White, you were the sweetest, funniest and always made me laugh my ass off. Mojo you all did a great job with this, I know she would have loved it. That's just the type of person she was. 💚🙏🏻
I miss you Betty
You can just tell she was a GOOD person. Ahead of her time and standing against racism and homophobia even decades ago.
Man she was a beautiful person! She can sing too!
Betty was amazing and sweet I was so happy that Betty watched my videos and she said she laughed so hard  it was an honor to know her she will be loved and miss by all
Betty was amazing and sweet she told how she love my videos and it made her laugh now that my favorite
Absolutely adore this woman. No one and i do mean NO ONE could ever say anything bad about her. She was like grandmother to the world. Everybody loves their grandmother
I loved her everything was my favorite I loved her mind and soul she was full of joy.
I must say THANK YOU for this. I was crying and laughing at the same time. And it was a feeling I don't  want to stop!!!!
Idc how old she was. She was the cooler than any of my friends right now. I'd have hung out with her anytime R.I.P sweet Betty.  I hope you are in paradise with Allen right now 😇😇
May we meet again my friend...rest easy. You are an icon of all 99 years.
Have no favorite I love them all
RIP Rose 🌹 Golden Gurl will never be the same 🥲Your legacy will live on ! Betty White We love you!
RIP Ms. White.
There were far more than 20 best Betty White moments. If you were to put all of them together, there would have to be a movie trilogy or more just to get a through them all. She really was a legend.
I've been watching her work for the past 35 years. I actually shed tears learning of her passing
Queen Shit
I miss Betty white so much
Life with Elizabeth  Golden Girls. THOUGH , I hated her swearing! I was so disappointed. Those ads! Ugh.
Snickers commercial
Watching Betty sing on her show reminded me of another great lady--Dinah Shore.
LOVE ALL HER VIDEOS.  HER SLAPSTICK JOKES, HER FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE AMAZING.
I like Betty White in Hot in Cleveland with Wendie Malick and Golden Girls also proposal with Sandra Bullock
I've never known life without Betty White. She seemed like the kind of person you couldn't help but love. I even named one of my vehicles after her.🥰🥰💜💜
2021 just had to throw one last punch. A total KO. Took Betty. SO SAD.    God bless you, Betty White! Rest in peace. I'm so distraught. I happened to buy the whole series DVD of "Life with Elizabeth," last year at a thrift store for $.99 cents. I bet that is worth a pretty penny now. And it's hilarious! I used to say every election since the 80s, BETTY WHITE FOR PRESIDENT! We'd all be in a better place right now if she had been. I think we should all feel so blessed to have been given so many amazing years of her work to look back on. She was one in a kazillion. A national treasure. A WORLD treasure. Thank you for being our friend Betty, you're going to live on in our hearts forever. I want to be just like you. Such an amazing woman. So 2021, go eff yourself. Take all your shitty events and be gone with you. Starting the year literally hours after her passing was just so surreal, and a wind-taking gut punch. Betty, thank you for everything ❤ Here's to 2022.
My favorite Betty White moment is EVERY Betty White moment.  Literally grew up watching her career through the decades.  We will miss you, Betty!
The fact there are 72 thousand thumbs up and no thumbs down,  tells me all I need to know about how the world loves Betty White.
She is so precious, beautifully Gloriously wonderful. Words can can fully do scribe Betty in the type of person she is. I know she’s passed away but to use the the word (was) does not seem to give her justice. She will NEVER BE FORGOT. All I can say is DAMN SHES GOOD❣️😁♥️😘
Probably the most hilarious, an wonderful crazy broad i ever watched on TV,  it would be awesome if you could call her on the phone!!!
We will miss our National Treasure.
💖💖💖
a betty white movie Oscar worthy would heal the world.
Just when you thought you knew everything there was to know about her... Betty White was TRULY AMAZING! ❤
My mom alwayswatches golden. She is great
The first one on the list was actually a promo for the movie The proposal not Deadpool
What a talent and animal advocate. I noticed she was always wearing the same diamond heart necklace it must have meant a lot to her. Now she knows the "secret" as she once described death.    RIP  Betty
To be such a Pure Soul in such a corrupt Industry Betty showed Her True Powers & How Absolutely a Golden Girl-Woman She Truly Is.   The conveyor belt of life just keeps going soon they will be all gone & those my age we will take their place and the young will take ours.  If we can achieve these transitions as eloquently & elegantly as Betty White did.....we can rest assure....all will be ok....no matter what.   Beautiful Betty Thanks For All The Smiles & Laughs....You will be truly missed, but always Remembered....!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She was not stingy with that smile and those dimples.  The lady was a ray of sunshine to the end.
I really loved her 'off their rockers' show - it was so good to see older people out there having fun, and pranking 😂 🥰 What a fabulous Actress she was, hoping there are more like her out there, stepping up to the camera
Wow! I had to pause it because when Betty White  did "Life with Elizabeth". I thought to myself she looks so much like Julia Louis-Dreyfus. There is only one Betty White, but if they had to do a movie on Betty Julia Louis-Dreyfus could certainly play a younger version of her, I think. RIP Betty White.
Shouldn't the 1st one be her death.
The fact that Betty White's characters were only written for one episode and she was asked to stay on more than one show prove just how talented she was

On the Golden Girls when they started the catering business…she led The girls in a song. Going to stuff for chicken all the way to Mississippi…….
Instead of getting rid of Duncan, he got more airtime.  Classic Betty White.  Betty White played many roles, but it was her ability to stand up for what is right, be supporting it “Negros (hate that epithet, but that is why the southern states threatened to boycott her show)” or her later outspoken support of the LGBT community.  She was so irrepressibly human, with such insight into humanity,  and an ability to laser focus on the wrongs of the world.  She took great her efforts to right those wrongs.  In my book, this is the reason Betty White wins the Brass Balls award.  The lady had no fear;  she got right back and at it again.  Betty White teaches us all how to be better humans.  And I’m betting that right now, she is giving God what-for, with a vodka in one hand and a hotdog in the other.  And finally, she is reunited with her one true love;  but dang , some of those angels are HOT.
Who didn't love Betty White?!! She was cute as a button, and so so funny. She brought sunshine to our world. She was one in a trillion!! RIP Betty, we will miss your smile and that ornery and adorable twinkle in your eyes!!

Happy 100th birthday Betty White💗🎉
Golden Girls has gotten me through some hard times 🙏
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 🐐 of everything thank you Ms. Betty White 🤍🤍🤍
When porn stars are honoring you in the comments, you’ve def made it. Betty white was a legend!
Betty White was nice, humble, loving, honest, funny yet did not take shit from anyone. Thats why we love her and always will love her.
Happy Birthday Betty 💖💖💖💖🎁🎁🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
Her humor , her sarcasme (!)  , super intelligent (!) her innocent look , a lady with balls ! In the most positive way ! ⭐️⭐️⭐️
we lost a golden girl
A national treasure indeed
What a wonderful human being.
My Favorite Betty Moment is whenever she's on the Screen!
Our Golden Girl. ❤️🌹🧓❣️. Is a Golden Angel now !!!
RIP MS BETTY WHITE...I WILL NEVER GET OVER UR PASSING, YOU ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY ALL TIME FAVORITE...HAVE A HUGE PIECE OF CHEESECAKE WITH THE REST OF THE GOLDEN GIRLS IN HEAVEN...ILL LOVE U FOREVER...
she’s so awesome like oh my god she’s always been such a baddie
Gilf
It says a lot about her life and legacy when dying at 99 is considered too soon
Well i'll be d*****d...  That's the first time I see Higgins outside Magnum...(#16 the b.w show 77-78)
Betty White was truly a star that you want to watch all of her roles over and over. The world is a little less bright with her being gone.  I love watching her role in Lake Placid...hilarious.  I will truly miss her.
Why do people who want you to be tougher say "Grow a Pair"? Those things are soft and sensitive. Thye should say "Get a Vagina'."! THAT takes a pounding!
They are all my favorite moments.. we want you back Darling.
There will never be anyone like her again.
It's  like a easter egg hunt! Lol. I  love Betty she will be missed so very much!
Thank you for this. <3
Ok MsMojo I have subscribed after watching your videos fir a while.  I Needed This Countdown!! I have Seen each and every show you referred to. I am crying laughing remembering and loving this video! Thank You so much. I have to make a video response.  I admit I never saw the Queen Latifah video. That kills me because I used to be compared to her years ago. Big Jersey girls ya know.  The wildest thing? I was born 1972 so I saw Suanne on Mary Tyler Moore. My Dad worked for CBS so I saw every single thing she was in in CBS and all I ever did was Laugh My Ass Off!! I always said I got my sense of humor from my father but it’s not true I got it from Betty White! I love every movie.  I used to watch her in Carson and I paid more attention to her than anything because I found how you could turn a phrase, twitch a hip, wink at the right time and get caught doing it. She was great timing in a bottle. And I would go on and on so I have to make a video. I think it will take a while though.
Let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the content for us!
Ive been watching all Betty shows in YT now. She's really just a fantastic, loveable human being.
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY MOTHER FUCKERS!!! 🤣😍😂😂
Personal and private is what it should stay.
Finally dead
This narrator just wanted to here her own voice.
You teased Betty on the Voice and never showed it?  Rip off!  :(
Thank you
You missed all the amazing appearances she made on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. She was always so funny.
What I love of all these videos of Betty is that she was the same. I mean, her personality was in every character she played. It wasn't only a great acting but it was also her. That's why it was so easy for her to be so convincing cuz it was her all the time a d that's why everyone loved her. We'll miss you girl. ❤️
RIP Betty love & miss you!
i had made a mention to my co-workers about how great this woman was... it was the next day we lost her.... its weird cause i dunno what made me think of her so randomly but i had just thought to myself about how she was always the same and great and charming in everything she did... she kinda became America's Grandma... I will miss her terribly. ALL the greats are disappearing... its too bad our world today is concentrating on hating each other to not recognize so many that are still here and could bring to us all a good view of living together... Betty always Accepted everyone for who they were... just a truely remarkable woman... and from a time when people of color and women in general were not accepted so much... its amazing what she was able to accomplish even with those limitations.... just goes to show how much charm and charisma can take u... if u are for real.... RIP Fine lady.
she wasnt lying when she said they didnt know how to tape things back when she was on tv.... it was ALL live broadcast.... they would film the shows as they were being aired and they saved those like video tape.
What I'm going to miss most about Betty White, is her mischievous sense of humor and that she voiced Kip's grandmother in Higgly Town Heroes. RIP Betty White. We'll miss you.😇❤❤
Anything Betty White is phenomenal.
Nice job MsMojo! This is a wonderful tribute to an amazing and inspiring woman.
She will be very much missed
If you didn’t like/love her, something is wrong with you.
We'll miss you, Betty.
The movie with her and Sandra Bullock....when they're in the woods singing "Get Low" by Ying Yang Twins. Too funny. I think the movie is called The Proposal
And there is one thing had never changed about her like the queen was  her hairstyle other than the colour.
Absolute girlboss energy, through and through
BOYCOTT CITIGROUP
p
Once you go blackberry,...
This is one amazing woman they'll never be another one like her she was such a good actor it actually brought a tear to my eyes cause I seen her my whole life on TV and I feel like I know her rest in peace Betty keep laughing in Heaven the way you made all of us laugh
One of the most beloved icons of all time she was the best. She's now having a party with the other girls  o my do I wish I was in that group right now. GOD take good care of her . She's in my life every night her and the girls.       TL M
Yes she was amazing what a loss
I'm in tears right now. I'm not gonna lie. Rest In Peace sweet Betty <3
She always reminds me of home , a true golden girl ❤️
We will always miss you Betty!
Betty white is dead and everything is worse now
Lol good riddance. Another nazi bites the dust 🥰
Her alliance with animals, the black community, and the LGBT community is totally the best stuff about her. It's rare for someone in the industry for so long to be seemingly such a bright genuinely wonderful person.
What a legendary career!  😎
She was the sweetest woman awe. I look up to her so much. I grew up watching her I think it’s where my sense of humor comes from.
I like the one where she calls a preacher a pulpit pounder who didn't know his ass from a whole on the ground.
Ok...I gotta ask.  Are you hiring?? WatchMojo and I share the same opinions, and I LOVE it.    ...asking for a friend.😘
you missed to moments that are funny as hell: 1. On Jimmy Fallon the guys from Jackass tried to make her flitch by crashing into stuff on purpose for 30 minutes, it did not work she showed them no sympathy until it was over running up to Steve-O who got concuss and gave him a hug 2. In the Steve Martin/Queen Latifah movie "Man of The House" midway through the movie White shows up as the Grandma/babysitter to Martin's kids'; she scruffs one of the kids' hair saying, "fix your damn hair you look like a faggot!" This comes after Martin leaves and while Martin was there she was the stereotypical Grandma that is "hey you want to help Grandma bake cookies she is so weak and feeble."
I had no idea she did a music video wow
she will be missed at great deal. if only her and Robin Williams got together more often! OMG!! people would of been dropping from laughing to hard!! lol. I hope they are both laughing in heaven together now :)
AMERICAN TREASURE
AMERICAN TREASURE.
Celbrity: Dies Mojo: Gotta drop a video asap, cant miss out on that ad revenue babay!
I miss Betty White so much she was fantastic
Katherine Piper in "Boston Legal".
What a brave lady, so elegant, beautiful, I bever knew she stand for an equal society in those dark days. A lady from head to toe.
I miss her so much
You will be missed Betty white ..
Betty we will LOVE you forever, please don't think we will ever stop. You were in such demand for 100 years, you can finally take a break now. The news made me cry but we know Allen is taking care of you now.  We won't worry. Thank You for all the good you did!
My best Betty White moments are just having the honor of being alive when Betty White was still live, that's my best Betty White moments.😞
100 years isn’t enough
Start running the reruns! I'm ready for repeat Betties!!
RIP!!! Dear Betty you are a bright shining star until forever!!! What a wonderful Angel is now in heaven!!!😘😘✌️✌️✌️🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭
Betty… thank you for the laughs!  You were a true talent!   I’m gonna miss you.
Awesome video❣
She was born 1 day after me but many many years before mee
Icon. Rest In Peace ☮️ you’ll be missed
Hopefully alien civilizations that might destroy us, receive some of her videos en route, and spare our tiny planet.
RIP legend!
She said, I don't understand this statement, that you have to get some Balls! Ball are soft and weak, it should be, you have to get a Vagina, now that's something that can take a pounding!
That's awesome I only Golden Girls all 8 seasons
Tampa Bay's own Paul White and Betty White on WWE Raw
Wow! They just say little suttle things. “Satans mistreat”? Seen Sandra Bullocks interview on Ellen Degeneres show on how she stays so young looking? Wakey wakey eggs & bakey ppl.
So much symbolism. Ummm…& that kind of looks like sporty spice from the spice girls back in late 90s/early 2000.
As accomplished and amazing as she is, she threw me in Lake Placid. I could never get her character out of my head lol. First time I saw her like that lol. Love her! ❤
My favorite Betty White moment is from the movie "Lake Placid" - in one scene her hilarious line is "you know,  right now, If I had a d**k, i'd tell you to suck it". The way she could deliver some of the dirtiest jokes as if she was reading you a recipe from a cookbook is classic! RIP, young lady.
My favorite is count Bessie the chicken lol
Rest In Peace Betty White. Thank you for being a friend to all of us. 🥺😢🙏🏼
Thank God we have videos will miss her
She was an absolute treasure...a true class act.
She should have sung more! What an amazing woman! RIP Betty xx
She made her own legand 🤗
The world lost a true legend when Betty White left it.
With Craig Ferguson... best👌.
she will be missed rip betty white
I'm 40 and there are only a handful of actors and actresses that I have followed. She's in the top 3. We have lost a great person. I cried when I was told that she had passed. She live and loved to the fullest and we should all try to live to that extent.
Betty ...You are a sweet firey treasure!!!!!!!!!!!!
We love you, betty! We never wanted to get rid of you.. ❤
We miss you Grandma Betty
Oh my Goodness I love(d) this Woman! If I saw her name in the credits, I knew I was going to watch it. She was everyone's Nana. RIP Ms. Betty.
I got emotional watching this video. I feel it was perfect!
👐🎭All of Them🎭💕
Betty White was proof that it's not the years in your life, it's the life in your years. May She Rest In Power 💞
She was beyond iconic and such a beautiful soul. She will be so missed....
I love that she loved animals.
Love, love her
She was amazing 🤩
Hey, Ms.  Why can't you just shut up and let the scenes speak for themselves?
Betty White,  the embodiment of talent, beauty, grace and intellect.
Forget Jesus, everyone should strive to be like Betty White.
You forgot her role in the movie, "Lake Placid." It was  bawdy and absolutely hilarious. Should have at least been an "Honorable Mention."
irreplaceable
not even an honorable mention for her role in Lake Placid? When she told off the sheriff I laughed so hard.
I love when she feeds the Gator in Lake Placid
God bless you, Betty White. I also loved when you co-hosted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade
Betty White was proof that Angels could walk the earth
nomitten
Thought Betty was going to live forever. Love me some Betty, she will be missed
R.I.P Betty white
I just hope this wonderful lady knew how loved she truly was.
She was great in lake placid too.  I've loved her all my life..she is a real star and a gift of joy for the world.  We will miss you.
I'm SO gonna miss her....
Betty White will always be "Rose" to me.
It’s hard not to cry like you’ve lost your grandma. The world won’t forget her name.
I truly thought she was an immortal I didn’t think this was possible.
She was pure gold!!
YOU FORGOT MCGRUBER, HOW COULD YOU?
Rebecca, play the videos and quit talking......don't ride the coattails of Betty White.....😪  You've literally made this video unwatchable
RIP Betty White! I have watched you for over 60 years in your various roles. I love, you Betty. The world will miss you!  My favorite moment was in Lake Placid when she told the Sherriff, "if I was a man, this is where I would tell you to suck my dick!"
I seriously doubt Betty and Ryan EVER had ANY fued.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world,that he gave his only begotten Son,that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,but have ever lasting life.❤️❤️
I thought she would live forever too. Betty White  will always be a shining light of pure love and joy. The ripples from all the laughter Betty gave us are so vast and ever growing.
She was so hot 😢 RIP Betty x
Sad she passed weeks before 100th birthday
what a fucking CHAMP!
I absolutely loved listening to Betty White over the years, but as a blind person who uses a guide dog, my favorite Betty White moment was the one in which I learned that she donated $100,000 a year to Guide Dogs For The Blind. After her death, they mentioned on television that she donated to numerous animal rescue organizations but never once mentioned Guide Dogs For The Blind. I am rectifying this here and thanking her for what she did.
The world is much less interesting w/o Betty White in it. She was such a talented gal! Miss her.  RIP Betty!
RIP Betty. Such an amazing woman. An inspiration to past, present and future generations
RIP BETTY! you were a classy classy chic!! Keep’em laughing in heaven!
Betty wasn’t my favourite Golden girl but she was one of my favourite people and actresses of all time.
I don’t have a favourite Betty White moment - there’s just way too many gems to choose from.  If there is a heaven I hope my mum has been able to tell Betty that her performance as Rose in The Golden Girls used to make her laugh til she cried ❤️
Dang. If she was my grandma, I would of had one hell of the time with her.
So The Betty White Show was kind of like the Ellen DeGeneres Show?!? Except for dancing she is singing
One of my favorite Betty White moments was the chanting scene in The Proposal.  She was/is a very beautiful soul inside and out.  She was the one actress I wanted to meet.   No one can ever replace her.  RIP, sweet Betty.
I’ll genuinely miss her. She was such a bright light.
God bless her soul
That golden girls scene was my favorite.
Such a lovely tribute. 🌺🌸🌼
Looved Betty  I was soo sad about hearing that funny ,lovable talented lady
Betty is a great example for the rest of us human beings.
Loved my millions around the world. She was definitely a different kind of woman, but had a heart of pure gold. rest easy Betty we love ya
Love you Betty. ❤ RIP. ❤
I really wish she made it to 100 years old
This really hit me hard. Rest In Peace Betty, you've left an incredible mark on this world.
Sad to know she used the horrid  F - word, never thort Betty White wudve been a person to use that kind of language,...as she reminded me more of a Donna Reed type person,...however I like the Golden Girls of her being the  Rose, the one that misepresented what, people said....like, when she was brought home from a night out date,...& her gentleman friend,...said to Betty White, (our Rose),..."il, give you a ring,...sometime",...as they were saying goodnight @ the door,...Rose reply's,..."oh no !,...I can't accept jewellery,"...😀😃😄.
If I'm not mistaken Betty White acted as Sylvester Stallone mom in the movie.... Look out my mom has a big gun....or my mom has a big gun... Something like that
May  she rest in peace.  SHE MADE US LAUGH  PRETTY MUCH THOUGH.
Betty, a big bottle of vodka, and a nice fire and candlelight, ooooooohhh baby! 😂👡👏👏👏👏👏
I loved everything about Betty. Rip 👑👑 queen. I love you so much.
My favorite moment was on Hot in Cleaveland. When she says:"Once you try blackberry". That was hilarious!
My favorite is 'betty's role in Lake Placid.  Her line "this is where, if I had a dick, I'd tell you to suck it."  Only Betty can pull that off perfectly.
Looking for the one where she disses President Trump.
There's a new challenge sweeping the internet.  The “Betty White  Challenge” is a virtual event that will be held on Jan. 17 (which would  have been the actress’ 100th birthday). The event asks fans to donate $5  to animal rescues or shelters in her name.
Her performance in The Lost Valentine (2011).  Poise and grace personified!!!
Post something useful  not the stories of this old mummy who acts like a teenage girl
How many times did you say “HAH!” so hard it blew all the air in your lungs?
There will never be another woman like Betty White. I can't believe she has passed away. She was timeless and will be so missed. We lost a wonderful lady, when we lost Betty. But she will be happy being with her husband and all the pets who are waiting for her!!
99 years wasn't long enough! 😭 Every life she touched seemed to be brighter for it. Such a rare and truly loving individual.
Once you go BlackBerry...
Betty in bring down the house
Forever a legend!
She was funny had great sense of humor. Beautiful personality. She will be missed....💖💛❤️
#disrupter that's what this Lady was, an amazing disrupter for her time
Rip Betty White you were so amazing you had a backbone and didn't care what other people thought you spoke your mind. You will truly be missed by millions and billions
She was so loving and classy !! That’s why she was blessed by our creator !! I’m teart eyed now
This wonderful person actually DID make it to 100 years.  We forget that when we were born, we were already 9 months old.
Well done!!!
Betty was an unparalleled icon‼️. I was devastated by the news of her passing 😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩😢😭
Rest in peace Betty White.
Thank you.  This was a nice tribute & several of these clips I have not seen! 🙏🏼
Man. I still hurt 😢
At least she’ll be with the rest of her girls. (Rip Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty, and now Betty white) 😭
RiP Betty --- grew up watching her!
The Golden Girl is now at the Golden Gate's.  A distant friend that played throughout the theme of our lives has parted and with her went a piece of myself as well.  So elegant & such a class act-tress,  Ms. White, we love  your body of work that we have and will again & again turn to, when life isn't so grand or think, "What would Betty say or do..?"   Whatever God's design is for the afterlife, I can only pray your a part of it once more.  That is Heaven for me.   Until then, God Bless you Ms. Betty White..!
There's nothing that can be written or said that even parallels to what she meant to the world. Comedy, humility, and ability all came together to make the greatest human to ever grace the boob tube!
my favorite betty white moment is when she passed away..that was legendary
She even did an episode of that wonderful old TV show "The Millionaire" where John Beresford Tipton gave away a tax-free million (back when that was real money).
Everyone should watch all of her appearances on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. They had such a great rapport. Of course, she did with almost everyone. She was so amazing.
This is absolutely awesome! Made me laugh & cry, & laugh so hard i cry lol RIP Betty White
OMG what a bright ray of sunshine she was. Heaven is definitely a lot brighter now.
I loved her in The Proposal. And on Mama's Family & esp the Golden Girls have 20 plus moments in that show alone
Loved Betty White. 💕
Her with whilemena slater on ugly Betty epic
An entertainer across multiple generations. For me, Sue Ann the "Happy Home-wrecker".
We were so lucky to get to watch her for these many decades. She will be missed and her memory is such a blessing. She is now with Allen.
You are missed Betty ✨💝✨💫
What a lovely video! She was and icon
I really can't believe she's gone.
You missed Lake Placid.  She was so funny in that.  She did seem like she got better as she aged.  Like a fine wine.  There will never be another Betty White!
Such a joy. Heaven got a whole lot funnier. Ty Betty, you are a true American icon.
All were mine
What a rare gem of a human being. This one hit hard😥Love you Betty❤️
Not even a single mention of Catherine Piper? Devastated.
Humanity just lost some Humanity, I’ll miss you Betty and I’m a 50 year old tough guy and I cried
She seemed like she could have been our grandmother but better yet our best friend as well. Oh how heaven has added the sweetest angel. Now she's with her husband in everlasting glory. My grandma died December 16th at 91 just days before Betty, what lives they lived.
My grandma Peggy, who was my hero passed away at 98. I always said the one person that reminds me most of my grandma Peggy is Betty White and I believe they shared one unique distinction, she always said you're only as old as you think. She was referring to the way you think which is why they both are the youngest old people I've ever known! Love you both
RIP you will always be one of the best actors
It's so hard to choose, but I believe my favorite Betty White moment was Saturday night live with Tina Fey as the census taker! Look it up and enjoy!
Betty White is an icon and picking just one favourite moment is tough as I love her and everything she has done but if I have to pick just one thing it would be Lake Placid and the line that put that movie first in my eyes is "if I had a dick, this is where I would tell you to suck it"! Only Betty could deliver that line as well as she did!
Sleep well beautiful. ❤️
the Golden Girls episode that she talked about the sardine wars.
Ryan Reynolds...as much as I love him...he really should have given her a cup of coffee. She's Betty effing Wife
The world lost an amazing soul😢 RIP Betty White you will be missed
She was with us almost 100 years, and her time was too short. RIP, Betty.
Only 20 moments??? Her whole life was one big beautiful moment. She will always be missed.
She was a amazing person and this is a great reflection oh her whole career and a great contribute to her. 👍🏾 R.I.P Betty White
What an iconic lady. If I was half as awesome as her I would be satisfied.
You guys should watch "Hot in Cleveland". It's an amazing sitcom and Betty White is outstanding in it. Oh Plus it's on Youtube
Yes you 4got her being on the show 'Maybe This Time'; she was super funny on that one as well.
Sue Ann Nivens,The Mary Tyler Moore Show
The Betty White Show,Date With The Angels, Life With Elizabeth, Free on YouTube
Thank You for this 🙏🏻 RIP Betty 😢💞 Will miss You.
I loved her on the TV show, 'Maybe This Time' with Marie Osmond.
RIP Betty white
The daughter of Alistar Crawley and sister to Bush is now in Hell. The truth does not set you free, it scares the hell out of you when you know the truth.
Do we really need the inane voice-over?
Would have been more enjoyable without the voice over and more of Betty
This was a beautiful tribute..i can honestly say i love thia beautiful lady she has brought so much joy n my life u could just tell she had love for everyone she was my favorite character on the golden girls ..REST N PARADISE beautiful wonderful QUEEN.. continue to make em 😅 👑 🌹.. #ROSEFROMSTOLAF🌹
OH what an amazing tribute!! Absolute legend, Betty was. <3 Her voice was beautiful when she was younger, and even more beautiful in her later prime.
Why do you have to talk through this? Her work stands on it’s own
Omg not ROSE from ST OLAF ❤❤❤❤
We kept us laughing. RIP
❤️ She was a true talent and will be very missed.
She's an amazing, wonderful person. The world will miss her for sure. She lived to be almost a hundred years old but still, I think she's gone too soon.  May your soul rest in peace, Ms. White.
Who didn't love Betty? I sure did!
My favorite Betty White movie is The Lost Valentine.
America's grandma. We'll miss you Betty!!!
We lost a national treasure when Miss Betty went Home.  One of the last pure hearts on Earth.  Beautiful,  kind, hysterically funny,  and beyond talented.  RIP Miss Betty, you were truly Golden 😢
sweetness and sass...
👍🏻😂
My dear pup passed away during the holidays.  I know Betty is at rainbow bridge playing with her and all the other animals.
Anything with Betty White is my favorite moment. The world is sadder today because she is gone. We will always miss you Betty. 🥺❤
Thank you Betty!!!!
Beautiful woman , inside and out. Rip.
An impossible choice!   She made us laugh until we cried.   Now we  laugh  even as we cry!    God Bless you, Betty White........
Does anybody know where do I find the music/tune in between the clips?
This has to be the BEST tribute I’ve seen for Betty White! Such a National Treasure & Gem! She will live on in our hearts for a lifetime to come! RIP Betty White!
Rest In Peace Fabulous Betty White
RIP Betty White, I feel like I’ve lost my grandma.  She was an advocate for so many causes.
funniest actress ever...and that spans a long time!
i expected to laugh but i did not expect to cry...what an ideal celebrity RIP Betty White
Hot in Cleveland- Elka- bender over
We truly lost one of the best entertainers May you rest in heaven you will truly be missed thank you for all the love and laughter you brought into much of our lives may you rest in heaven I wish I would have been able to meet you it would have been an honor
RIP Ms. Betty White. You will be sorely missed for sure.😥🕊⚘🙏🏽⚘🕊 Be Blessed.💕
This was great thanks! I was surprised to not see an honorable mention of her from Lake Placid! It was my first time seeing her play a role that was edgy and dark.
These are great but one of my favorites is her role in Lake Placid and not one scene from it🤷🏽‍♀️.  Just 🤦🏾‍♀️🤬
I think Hollywood should have learned after a while that Betty was far too excellent for just a one-time appearance on any show! When I learned of her passing, I cried and cried, but then I put my Golden Girls hoodie on and smiled for a photo for my Instagram to try and honor her in some small way. I don't think she was the kind of person who would want people being upset over her passing. I remember laughing with my grandma over the show, who typically wouldn't have liked "raunchy" characters like Blanche or sex jokes. But she loved The Golden Girls! I lost her when she was 98 and a half, so losing Betty at 99 really hit me in the feels. It almost felt like losing another beloved grandmother. We can all learn from her famous zest for life and selfless love for animals. Rest easy, angel 💞
One of the Youtube clips is titled: "No one is safe when Betty White is around." How true.
I love ❤️ her
Betty White was such a treasure. My Great Grandmother loved Betty White and was one of her biggest supporters throughout her whole career. Grandma passed away in March of 2021 at 100 years old. I can guarantee you that they are having a blast together. RIP Betty, we will never forget you.
I think Betty was all of our touch stones.
We've all been blessed by Betty. Will miss her ❤️🥰 Rest in Peace ❤️❤️
What can we say… BETTY WHITE WAS AWESOME!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️We will all Miss you! 😢😇
Golden Girls  she was amazing in everything she did
This made my heart smile ❤️ no dislikes all love
I think she has the highest benchmark ever placed in this world. She remained to be herself and no reinvention needed, at all!
here is a permanent cure for herpes virus with herbal medication i got from Dr.Itepu , i came across this great man after i saw a lot of testimonies online about his cure and i decided to contact him for help and to my greatest surprise he actually cured me.
I didn't know she was so foul-mouthed..disappointing.  I liked her Mary Tyler Moore role Sue Ellen and Golden Girls, Rose, but being herself with Allen Luden, her beloved husband,  on game shows , has to be my favorite role. Their mutual love was palpable.
I am still in shock. Thank you Betty White for all the laughs. You will be missed but never forgotten. The Animals truly will miss you and all your support. R.I.P. Much love
She was wonderful!
How can you choose a favourite Betty White moment they were all pure gold. Rest easy Queen you truly will be missed ❤️❤️
We loved you so much Betty! God will we miss you! Rest in power!
She will live on in our hearts!
there's a HUGE hole on this planet and in each of our hearts now that she's gone... they don't make them like her anymore
Who forgot to put the bubble wrap around Betty? I know she's a peace in Heaven with Allen.
i am truly sad
Betty White isn't one in a million, she is one in the world.  There's only one Betty White.
MsMojo over here cuttin' onions...
Rest in peace Miss Betty White 🙏🏻🕊️🙏🏻... You will be dearly missed 🥺💔. Such a talented person 💖!!
Thank you for being our friend ❤    RIP 🙏 🕊
I remember Betty doing the race results on Al Jarvis's KLAC-13 show in the early days of TV.  She seemed about 16. It was very clear that all the cast loved her.
Such a beautiful class act.  My heart goes out to her family.
she pass away end of old America not same anymore in America
Your picks are good.  I don't have favorites, so this was a nice sneak into my algorithm.
Sadly MsMojo, you left out one of her GREATEST movie characters. The Movie Lake Placid would not had been the same without Betty White. R.I.P. and make all the angels laugh in heaven.
Her St Olaf stories on golden girls were the best
🌌😭😭😭😭😭🌌🌹🌌
America Loves Betty!! She got the Booster Jab 3 days before she died.  Interesting 🤔
RIP, Betty White. Hard To Believe She Lived 99 Wondrous, Funny Years! But Then Again, Bob Hope Lived to Be 100
I love you Betty White😍 R.I. P. Finally with your husband💞
Oh how you'll be missed, Betty! You truly are a national treasure!  You will forever be a beautiful, beloved, and indelible force of unbridled goodness in the world!  Rest well old friend,  for you've earned it
She was queen of the dark side she was child trafficking you will find out soon Do your home work 👍really  listen to what she says ! Betty Ford was her sister there father was very  evil😍queen of Hollywood which is almost dead
i learned a lot about betty white she was amazing woman
Now I’m crying all over again. Thank you for bringing more memories to my attention.
I adored her Catherine Piper character on "Boston Legal" alongside the wonderful actors James Spader, William Shatner and Candice Bergman, as well as all the other roles you mentioned.
Betty could say things that many others couldn't. Her comedic timing was perfect. She started out on TV before I was born. We will miss her as America's grandma. Love you Miss Betty.
Two things that were on KTLA (Los Angeles) the day of her death.    At 93, she was asked "Ms White, is there anything in the business you regret you never did?"  Her answer - which was very quick and as sharp as a tack - was "Yes. Robert Redford".     The second was from a fan placing flowers on her star on the Walk of Fame: "All you ever needed to fall in love with Betty White was a television and a heart.".  No truer words have ever been spoken.    God bless her, and may she love eternity with the one love of her life - Alan Ludden.
A National Treasure, nailed it!! 👏👏👏
If ever a prefect person walked this earth,  it was Betty.  She really was bigger than Jesus.
It would be great if youjust let the clips play instead of talking.  My fav was from Lake Placid
My favorite memory is when she does  her tribute to Morgan Freeman.  However, I love them all.
She was one of a kind! We should all strive to be as kind and humble as she was! Rest in peace Betty, you are missed!
She's such a fraud. She pretended to be an animal advocate meanwhile eating animals everyday. If you're not a vegan you're not an animal lover. You pay on average to have one animal killed every day.
There are enough people singing her praises that I don't need to do so as well, we all know what we have lost with her death so I want to remember one of my favorite moments from her life. I think the thing that helps me remember what a down to earth person Betty White was is a quote from her after someone asked her what her favorite meal was. Most people in Hollywood would have mentioned steaks or some other fancy or expensive thing but Betty's response was a hotdog and potato chips. Really brings to mind what kind of person she really was, one of us, only better.
Terrible way to end a year 😪
Her performance in Lake Placid when she tells off the cops is the BEST!!
The last Golden Girl standing and the GOAT! RIP to the funniest woman ever 😂🙏🏽❤️
RIP Betty White! I loved watching her in Lake Placid. Before that movie I only knew her as Rose Nylund, which was a far cry from her character on Lake Placid. When she said, "If I had a d**k this is where I would tell you to suck it," to Brandon Gleasons character I couldn't stop laughing! Betty White is a legend and an icon. She is deeply missed, but, now she's reunited with her husband and the other Golden Girls.
Thanx for entertaining us for so many years. Rest in Peace "Betty".
R.I.P  BETTY WHITE WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE...your legacy we live on & on forever  you are truly missed  we love you forever ♡♡♡♡♡
RIP Mrs. White, thank you for all the laughs!  I just loved her in everything she did but Proposal when she dances outside by fire with Sandra then when feels up Sandra in that dress - cracks me up every time.
What a legend who had always stayed humble. It was hard to believe she was 90 something and still so vibrant. She could've passed for 70. She's one of those people you think can live forever. A couple weeks prior to the sad news I said it would be such a sad day once she's gone, but she did live a good long life. She can now be reunited with her husband.
I loved all shows and movies that Betty white was in. My favourite was Betty white on game shows. Oh and the snickers ad.
Miss Betty took her last breath here and took her first breath and heaven and now she's got a big show to do
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
rip betty white she was such a beautiful soul
A national treasure
The world got that much darker when 2021 took her with it. We'll miss you, Betty. You were a true force for good.
Wow, Betty my Heart is broken for your passing ,you are sorely missed 💔  Rest in Peace.
I thought I was done crying after she left us, nope. Heaven just needed you more Betty. 🤘🏻 🧔🏻 🤘🏻
God Bless Betty
😭😭😭💔💔
Betty White's death triggers all kinds of memories. One of the craziest happened when I transferred to BYU back in 1962. Several people had told me I looked a lot like Betty White. I didn't think much of it, but when a 3rd guy told me that again, I made up a totally fictitious story, that I was her daughter, but the family didn't want any publicity about me going to BYU.      That tall tale went on for several days, until I had to tell him the truth! He was so upset, and mad at me for tricking him!! To repent of my deceit, I ended up ironing all his shirts for my self-applied penance! (Back in the days when everything had to be ironed!!      So, Betty White, a fond adieu. You've entertained us so well, for so long....and may my deceitful past (with this confession) be laid to rest as well!
She is just going to be so immeasurably sorely missed.
I guess the only good thing about her death is that she is reunited with her husband
When you are as close to 100 years old as Betty White was (just over two weeks), I think you deserve the right to be called a centenarian. That aside, I'm not even from the USA, and I remember her with great fondness. She filled a lot of years with a lot of life.
RIP Betty White you were the Bomb
Betty, I'm from Germany and I would have wished you to be 100😭   I will never forget you😭🕯   I love you, Betty, Bea, Rue and Estelle❤   You will be forever unforgotten 😭
Lmfao ☠️
As a hardcore metal head, I shed tears for the loss of Betty White; it's like I lost a close family member. Rest In Peace Betty. 😢
It wasn't the Carol Burnett show it was Mamas Family 😂
She was a looker too
I just cant believe she died she was almost 100😢
My favorite SNL census taker
Betty White was a national treasure not just for her talent but for just being her🥰. A good person.
it's sad to lose such a legend, there is no one else like her, and maybe no will ever be like her, a real one of a kind.
I love you Betty! Forever
I don't get it or her! Perhaps I am too young to understand why she is so famous.
Granny Annie is my favorite role for Ms. Betty. The Proposal was AMAZING!
Such a loss to this world. Betty was an amazing person. She would stand up for human rights as well as animal rights. She was a angel and we will always remember and love her. RIP Betty the world has lost a legend 😇
Her role in The Proposal 🥰
In a career that long how do you only claim the top 20 for this wonderful artiste
She looked AMAZING for her age ❤️
The angel and light on this world known as Betty White can never be replaced. We love you Betty. Thank you for the countless memories.
God speed Betty!
When she talked about gay/lgbq +, she was spot on. And her response can be attributed to every other person and home life. Your path in life, every choice and decision made is only yours. Paths can be shared here and there but each path belongs to one person. Each one, unless sharing it for a minute, is not my or anyone else’s business and shouldn’t be judged as such. I don’t care who you are or who you do. Your life is yours and yours alone. I don’t have to agree with your choices and what you believe, we don’t have to have the same opinions, what people fail to do is respect them. A lesson or twenty could be learned from her.
I really loved Betty White, I just wish she hadn't had such a potty mouth.
She truely was a national treasure! She will be missed but thankfully we have all these memories. Thank God for Betty and film! 💗
I didn't realize what a scatological freak she was. Good riddance!
Ko naša Nella Eržišnik samo nije tako tretirana ko Betty
Honey badger don’t give shit 😂😂
We lost a great person when Betty white passed on.  She was forever young, and a great humanitarian. She loved people for who they were. Not what they were! She was loved, and she will be missed!
Awww took cute
Oh Blanche  No the Herring would juggle
Rip 🙏 Betty white  prayers go to your family and friends condolences 🙏 Betty white 🙏 ❤
Loved her in LAKE PLACID!!!
Look up the word resilience, charm, humbleness or authentic and you'll find her picture next to it...RIP Betty, we'll miss you.
Betty White is my favorite actress
My favorite Betty moment is missing from this list: Delores Bickerman in "Lake Placid".  She was the best part of that movie.
She was the funnest mess EVER!!! i wanna be just like that at her age!!!!!!!💖 love and miss u betty...signed off betty banks!
Loved betty white!
What a lovely lady. She’ll be missed.
Why no mention of Lake Placid??
I miss you already Betty
I still remember her role in the Lake Placid movies. As a kid it was the first time I got to see the real Betty White after growing up on Mama's Family and Golden Girls. It was jarring, but charming watching her tell off the Sheriff.
The day the world lost Betty White, was the day the world lost so many future laugh attacks, happy tears, & and a genuinely kind heart! I will always be in total awe of the positivity, and compassion, that Betty so effortlessly exuded. Even though I wasn’t lucky enough to know her personally, I feel truly blessed that I was able to grow up watching her shows & movies, which makes me FEEL as though I really knew her. There aren’t nearly enough people, like her, in this very cynical world, especially over the past 5 years. She had the type of heart/personality where you could instantly tell that she was 100% genuine, & so incredibly humble. This world is in DESPERATE NEED of more people like her, so it’s so very sad that the original has now gone Home, & is probably making the angels laugh their ‘wings’ off right now! Rest In Peace, Betty White ❤️ You will be sorely missed & NEVER be forgotten! 🥺😢😇💔
Doesn't matter what anyone says, Betty White was nation's Grandma.
Love it she will never be forgotten as an actress we will always remember her even the kids to come will remember her her legacy will i’ll keep going on for years R.I.P.
Amazing career and an amazing woman.
Hey ALL. IN HER HONOR LET'S GIVE $5 IN HER NAME TO THE ANIMAL SHELTER OF YOUR CHOICE ON JANUARY 17TH HER BIRTHDAY! ITS THE BETTY WHITE CHALLANGE! MAKE HER 100TH BIRTHDAY THE MOVEMENT SHE DESERVES!
I miss her soooo much already! 😭 Rest In Peace Ms White. We love you now and forever!
"Ur Playing Like Betty White" "That's Not What Ur Girlfriend Said"
Rest in Heavenly Peace Ms. Betty White. You lived a whole life with your hilarity. I watched you always on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, Mama's Family, and Golden Girls. I loved you when starred in movies, and hosted SNL. You were a bright lady and made everyone laugh. You will always and forever be golden in our hearts. Your dancing up there with your departed husband's, the Golden Girls, Mary Tyler Moore show cast, Harvey Korman, and my sister and grandmother. Thank you so much for being our friend. We all love and miss you. 😇💔😢🌹🕊
Do you know what if our government could see the world through Betty Whites eyes the heart of Americans with smile instead of frown and turn on one another
I'm glad that someone mentions Betty and Rue on Mamas Family.  I love that TV show and most biographies and shows seem to forget that they were apart of that show.
People like Betty White don't come along once every 10 years or once every 30 years. People like Betty White only come along ONCE !😌😔
What? No Boston Legal moments? Sacrilege.
She actually reminds me of my Aunt Betty. My only Aunt.
Will miss her dearly. R.I.P. Betty White.  You're such a gem❤
ILOVE YOU, MS BETTY.  R.I.P.
Can't stand Morgan anymore but his reaction is pure and genuine.
I cried watching some of her roles and acceptance speeches…
This video would be amazing without the redundant commentary. No offense, but if I need context on a Betty White clip, I'll let you know.
I love that she was an animal lover, and activist. Rest In Peace beautiful lady 😘
When betty white roasted shatner, hilarious
💙 I miss Betty White! 🥺 She was a kind soul and so funny. 💙
My favorite Betty White moment is all of them.
The Snickers commercial has to be my favorite. That was great. Betty, you will be missed.
We love you, Betty. Thank you for all of the laughs you shared with us. We will miss you greatly.
So many icons i grew up with that showed respect,dignity and made us laugh and helped us through life. RIP
im not crying...ok im sobbing like a baby
This is how I find out she was dead..... Pool.
It's funny I always thought it was Betty White who played the Rappin' Granny in The Wedding Singer, and so I assumed that performance would be in the top 3 here. But when I didn't see it come up, I looked up the role, and funny enough, it's not Betty! It's Ellen Albertini Dow. Ellen was no doubt funny, but she doesn't hold a candle to Betty.  Betty was a talent and a consummate professional. From the start of her career to the end, she was a model of professionalism and work ethic and was an all around class act -- even when delivering her brand of subtly vulgar humor.  I will really miss her.
I'll always see her as Rose from Golden Girls
Rather than completely mourn the fact that she died, I choose to celebrate that she lived. She was a wonderful woman and truly lived a blessed life.
Rip Betty we will miss you a lot and we hope that you'll be happy up in heaven with all your friends and family.  You will be mist very much and thank you for being so good to our animal friends that need you and your zoo friends for doing just a wander full job on looking after them for as long as they need.   I hope that you and the other golden girls are making god laugh his ass off up there that he might stop covin 19 for good.  That would be supper mega awesome of you guys if that happen and we be very great full if that happened forever. But seriality Rest In Peace Betty you deserved it for all the wand fully good things that you did hear on earth for as long as you live hear. You will be forever miss but we hope that your in a better place now
I feel like the world lost a beloved grandmother. She was an incredibly talented woman who was always well beyond her time. Rest peacefully Betty. You will always be loved and missed. ❤️
Betty White is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. Why else would he loan such an angel out to us for 99 years.
She was such a treasure and beautiful human being.. She will definitely be missed.. When she was in the Snickers commercial I died laughing..
She was the world's grandma, mother, aunt, and every positive influence we could've asked for. We were blessed to have her ❤❤
I feel like Betty White was invited to all the BBQ's black, white, and hispanic! She will be forever missed♥️
my favorite rol is in boston legal she was great actrice she will be mist definitely her sense of humor
Thank you. Really enjoyed the video. 💗
I Actually saw her in That There Commercial
She is..."The People's Choice" ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful lady with a beautiful singing voice and extremely  funny.  Betty White was a real one.
Rip
Thank you for posting.
Anyone recognized Richard Crenna on the part of the Life with Elizabeth section.
The whole industry misses her
Rip 🙏 Love you miss you 😘 and we LOVE YOU !!!
For me is when she said “I had to find out about Facebook and ….it’s a huge waist of time”
🙏🙏🙏
Looks like Ol' Betty couldn't keep it 100...
REST IN PIECE MISS BETTY! YOU ARE AND WE'RE AN AMERICA'S ICON THAT WILL LIVE ON IN OUR HEARTS!!!! The movie I absolutely loved Betty in "Lake Placid" mostly when she told the cops "if I had a sick this is where I'd tell you to suk it " , I never laughed so hard I almost didn't make it to the restroom!  🥰😍💖❤🧡💛💚💙💜  💯 percent the most loving and caring woman in television from the start of her career!
Nothing will ever beat her going back to back with Joan Rivers on her old talk show, Betty didn't miss a comeback! #RIPBETTY
Betty White was the only thing holding back the darkness.   Now, the end times are here.
She was amazing literally amazing
Got the booster shot died 3 days later.
RIP Betty White you will be missed.
Everyone loved Betty White. Rest in peace Betty. x
I can't watch these videos without getting all teary-eyed. The news of her passing hit me like several tons of bricks. I've convinced myself that she was just never going to die. Betty White was Immortal as far as I was concerned. We didn't deserve her, but we got her. It's probably selfish to say, but 99 years just wasn't enough
My best Betty White moment?  When she showed the world that you can't say you are an animal lover if you only love those with fur and feathers (her holding a boa constrictor)
RIP Betty. You will always be loved and will never be forgotten… 😍
The Last Golden Girl RIP
When she asked Tavis Smiley, "Are you Black?"
I once heard that one day you will just be a memory so why not be the best one you can be..you will always be one of my greatest memories..the times you made me laugh so hard i cried and then there will be the time you left the world and I cried..what a fantastic role model you will always be for people who want to be a better person! All they need to do is follow your amazing example!! The world will miss you and we will continue to think of you and as we do we will smile..
Betty White did amazing as Rose Nylund. I loved her in Golden Girl so much. Her contsnt never-ending and strange stoires about st. Olaf (and the reactions from the others) was always the best. i also loved the way Dorothy interacted with Rose her constant sarcatic repsonse when Rose  didnt knoow what was happening was amazing
Is Betty White was your grandma I would feel like everything else would be great too
Shall be always loved and remembered rip Betty White
She's back in St. Olaf....😭😇
All of these moves
We need a movie about Betty's life with Tina Fey playing her. It would be soooooo good.
Beloved Betty ♥️ You will be deeply missed!
She was so funny in Lake Placid, how could you miss that on this list
Her on the Californians on SNL
"You just never know when you're whole past is going to be brought out around here."  - Betty White (1954)   Well Betty, 2021 sounds as good a time as any lol. ❤️❤️❤️  Over 60k likes on this video so far... and not a single dislike. That's what I'm talking about. Let's keep that alive!
No way she just passed.
She was such a special lady. She was loved and will be deeply missed rest In peace Betty. Will never be forgotten.  If 2021 didn't take enough it had to turn around at the last minute and take one of our most precious angels love you Betty
She reminds me a lot of my grandfather. He has a demeanor that made absolutely everybody adore him.
What a legend! RIP Betty. 😢
Rest In Peace Beautiful Betty White. I have a few favorite moments, but easiest for me is her part in The Proposal every part. Then Lake placid where she's rutting for the croc.
Jesus said "you must be born again" to see  His Father's Kingdom.  God bless all of you out there. Stay safe, love long. You are priceless.
I miss her already.  Unique, strong, intelligent,  out of the box, funny, sweet, and who loved one partner with endearing tenderness.  My favorites  Betty  White moments were as Sue Nivens on MTM, and when she was a guest on her husband's game show Password.  The love  between them, the respect, and chemistry they shared as a couple was so legendary.
Hot in Cleveland was so underrated for just how extremely funny it really was. Rarely does a sitcom bring me to tears but when Betty's Character Elka messed up the reconstruction of the Jesus mural so horribly I was almost unable to breathe I lost it so hard.
R.I.P. Betty, you will be missed.
What a gem. Truly a huge loss to lose someone so  caring, humble, and hard working. I’m glad she was so appreciated while she was here
this is a certified betty white moment
RIP Betty!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow!! What a wonderful tribute to such a terrific lady.  Some of these scenes took me way back. I enjoyed watching her in her many sitcoms and appearances along with some of my other faves, Ted Knight, Cloris Leachman, many, many others, who have also departed this world. She always made me laugh. I'm sure she's up there in heaven making them laugh, telling jokes. Godspeed sweet lady you will be missed.
Rest in peace Betty White.🙏
In the African community we give he the Honor of Great Mother, for he love of all humans. I love, honor, and miss her great humble self.
😥 beloved and missed
White Rabbit!
99 years and her life was still to short
Has to be her role in "Lake Placid" when she ripped into the cops still has me rolling on the floor.
Whoa! I’ve been never saw first time were so young beautiful on her Betty white Rest In Peace good it 😔😔💙🤍
Her character in Lake Placed was great. Not many ppl could pull of the sweet cookie baking grandma while trying to feed someone to a giant crocodile that well.
One of the best actress loved her R.I.P. ❤️❤️
I hated her, I thought she was often very crude.
The Proposal and Hot in Cleveland are gems! Like Betty! 🌟
Laughig and crying. That's you know a great one has passed.
The world is a little less bright now, RIP Betty
Rip I hope your with Allen again thanks for all the funny moments you've shared with the world you will be missed dear lady
Love Betty. Who doesn’t? The problem with these “best of” videos are the overdone narration explaining waaaay too much before, during and after the clips. Let Betty do the talking!
She was always smiling and I thought she looked really good for being 99! I should be so lucky.
We could use more people like her RIP Betty
I loved her in the series The Practice...her rinibg in performance and life was genius!
Her whole acting career and jokes !
i enjoyed watching betty from game shows to sitcoms to movies she was incredible actress
Thanks. I long thought she was a decent human being, who had escaped Hollyweird's immoral/amoral preachiness. Turns out I was really wrong.She was just another one of the mindless pretty faces, that only pretend to be what America wanted from their TV screens, and were not so, IRL. And were willing stooges for degeneracy.
Is there anywhere we can watch some of her old shows? I would totally like binge all of life with Elizabeth
She really was beautiful and elegant, but her spirit was out of this world
One of my favorite Betty characters was delores bickerman from lake placid
"Back in the day" Allen and Betty would have their cars serviced by a good buddy of mine....He would tell me stories about how nice and real they both were.  I think we could have all learned a lot from that generation. Rest in Peace Betty White.
We'll always have St.Olaf
Crying just watching this OMG
Definitely the youngest 99yo that had EVER lived…. she totally would’ve been the youngest century old that had ever lived too. No-one does was she did, better than her….. & they no-one ever will…… she’s a GOLDEN GIRL for a reason 😂
Im a 40 year old man thats been watching Betty White my entire life. The first celebrity to pass that hit me where I feel things.
"The Lost Valentine."
Once in a lifetime GEM!
I shouldn't have watched this today, it just makes her absence more pronounced. Rest in peace Betty.
Betty White was an amazing woman who had an amazing career and we are all better off for having privileged enough to have enjoyed her humour. She will be sorely missed and the world is a slightly darker and less funny place with her passing.  Rest In Love dear lady.
This loss truly hurt.  I think we all hoped she would live forever.  ❤BW 4evr❤ #thankyouforbeingafriend
Betty White will be missed deeply. She was such a amazing actress in her TV shows, tv commercials, and she was funny. Her role as Rose  in Golden Girls was a  golden road on her journey in life. She valued life and made known as her leads there was not ever a duel moment she made me laugh. We really loved, and she will be missed but she will live in our hearts forever ♥...
Crazy my great grandma just turned 93 turned out betty white baby sat her all 35 years of my life I never knew that and seeing her pics back then betty was so darn beautiful
Seeing no dislikes on this video only shows how great and adorable Betty is! 💕💕💕
How could they have missed lake placid?
When she was an anthropologist in Bones
She's a treasure. Always. I peed on her car 🚗 I didn't know. It was dark I was like let's do this quick.. I then saw her name on the parking spot. I'm sorry Betty.  Lol 👌 😆
Watching the Golden Girls now will be like watching Bewitched - all of the characters have died. She lived a long life and one well lived. RIP Betty White.
A true legend!
RIP Betty... @MsMojo... please make it a Top 200...0
R.I.P. Betty White gonna miss you dearly.
Thankyou Betty for all the fun and laughter you gave this world. You will be sadly missed.
Betty White is Amazing 🙏🏻❤️‍🩹🇺🇸
What an amazing icon.  I was so blessed to watch some of her shows while growing up and my world has always been the better for it.  Not to mention her love/support of animal welfare is so inspirational.  She was absolute perfection.  💜
"you do a thing _once_ and then you run like a thief" definitely the best quote she's ever dropped. She'll *definitely* be missed.
All of a Them🙏🏻❤️‍🩹
What made Betty stand out as opposed to other senior actors and actresses is that she embraced her age, poked fun at herself and kept moving forward as trends progressed. She didn't stay stuck in her golden girls days. Can you imagine Bea Arthur doing a rap or pulling off any of the stunts Betty did? I sure can't.
She's definitely touched generations of my family's hearts. She will be missed.
Betty White is the best thing to happen to this planet , she loved everyone and i hope to meet her on the other side !
i was only a baby when I fell in love with her watching golden girls
In the WWE segment for a second I thought her ear-rings were glittery skulls! (They're pandas) Skulls would have worked, too.
My favorite was playing on Carol Burnett show.
Where is Lake Placid???!!!..Thats my favorite Betty White.."Im rooting for the crocodile". RIP Betty...i witched it that night
I don’t have one favorite Betty moment. She’s has uncountable moments!!!!
"And you still can't get rid of me!" So true. She went out on her own terms, screwing over the publishers of People magazine. She will always be remembered, and she will always be loved
Classic, Classic Comedic Legend!!!! She will be sorely missed. RIP Betty White. 😢
Can I like this a million times over? Betty White was the one celebrity that I had wished to meet.
A true Legend we love you Betty
The funniest woman who ever lived!! hands down
My aunt told me about a year ago that she couldn't stand Betty White. At that moment I knew it was time to throw the entire aunt away and get a new one. NO ONE needs that kind of negativity in their life!!!
Anything she said in the movie Lake Placid! The Crocodiles were her pets. Lol. The world will not be the same without Betty. I loved that woman.  R.I.P. you beautiful lovely, hilarious woman. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
She was the first person I ever heard talking about being childfree by choice.
im impressed , such a lovely woman and capitalizing from her, oh yes the day she died ... hmmmm I just lost respect for you mojo and staff extremely dissapointed
On Jan. 17th why not make a contribution to your local animal shelter in memory of Betty White?
Thank u for this list!
I love her in Lake Placid
17 days from being 100 yrs old, betty was a saying like it is person which is why i liked her
The sad part is the kids these days don’t and won’t appreciate her like the people that truly grew up watching her. They only like because they think they should. She was such a sweet woman and there isn’t enough words in the world to express how much she will be missed and how great she was. I loved her as Sue Nivens and Rose and even in Hot in Cleveland. Anything she did was always gold. She will be missed for years to come and there will never be another like her. She was and is a National treasure. 💙👼🪦
IM SO GLAD SHE GOT HER FLOWERS BEFORE HER DEATH! RIP MS. WHITE
It sucks she missed 100!!!
The William Shatner roast
Imagine being that gifted, that loved, that wonderful of a person for that long! RIP Betty, you made the world a better place, and shall be missed greatly and remembered fondly always! 💖🙏😊
The Icon ♥️💔♥️
God why did you take her from us
Betty White…thank you for being a friend.
Ug... why'd I click this.... only MOJO could do such a bad job at celebrating Betty White.
RIP Betty 😘
ICON
Thank you for sharing our precious Betty with us. I love her and, though she's gone, I'll never say LOVED her, because my love and admiration for her didn't die when she did. Betty, I pray that you're with your beloved husband again, wrapped in the loving arms of God. The shows over and the stage lights have been turned off, but I'm positive the light is shining a million times brighter in Heaven now, just because you're there. We love you.
She DOES look a LOT like Barbara Bush.  I heard it's true that she is indeed Barbara Bush's sister?  Can you confirm?
Clean living,wholesome living and sad carrier ...rip. i have older shoes
I miss her so much. Such a polite and humble person! She will be missed and definitely remembered.
when she did the movie Lake Placid, she had one of the greatest lines that i ever heard...."if i had a dick, this is when i'd tell you to suck it"...laughed so damn hard!!!!
My grandmother loved, LOVED Betty White from her earliest days on television.  Granny was a piece of work herself and introduced me to one of the guilty pleasures of my high school years: Whenever we were with each other, we never missed an episode of The Golden Girls.  I was a long haired metalhead (still am, actually) and I would just laugh my fool head off right along with Granny.  I always knew that when the words "St. Olaf" were spoken, I was in for a treat.  I will miss knowing that Mrs. White is out there, but I'm glad that she enjoyed such a long career and ended it peacefully, in her sleep.  We were the lucky ones who got to see her.
What a True Gem.💎 2:26 I can't help but think I Love Lucy totally ripped off the whole idea from her breakout show for Thiers. Wow! R.i.p Betty 💔🙏
You know Bea, Estelle and Rue were at the Pearly Gates to greet Betty when she arrived.
Love you Betty and RiP.  A true legend and lady.
How many guest appearances did she turn recurring. Truly stellar actor to do that time and time again.
She will be missed.. some names will never be forgotten.. spoken when defining the greatest of entertainers. Betty White, George Burns, Robin Williams, Bill Murray, to name a few, these are the people that inspired, revered among their peers, paved a new road of entertainment. Such talent … Bill don’t die we need you
15:25 Proof that God adored Betty White too
Make me cry why don'tcha?
You will be so missed Betty! You have kept me laugh all my life.
Betty White was a gem and true icon. The world had a huge loss with her passing. R.I.P. Betty 🕊🤍
Excellent tribute. Nicely done!
Anyone remember her from Lake Placid?
I miss her already. Always love ya, kiddo. XO
Rest in peace Betty Thank u for thank you for the many years of laughter The Golden girls once again are reunited in heaven 🙏👑🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
And now all the golden girls can be reunited in heaven. Rip Queen 👑
What an epic life and soul.
The Great Herring War in the Golden Girls
I watched ponyo today. Even in animation her voice is in a lot. :) I know of her only when he hair was white. RIP Betty White Im not sad for you, def happy for you, you had an amazing life!
I got much laughter & joy watching her act on Television  🥰  She will be Missed & Definitely not forgotten. 🙏🏾 Rip. Betty White
I never thought I'd miss her so much?
Too much narration. Just play the clips.
Her role in lake placid deserves a mention!
What a doll
We have lost another silent hero. God Bless you Betty and walk with God. Aye, don't go to Canada. Trudope Sucks. lol
God just wanted her to celebrate that 100th birthday in heaven that’s all. No better way to celebrate than that.😇😇😇
This may sound wrong, but it’s funny at the same time…  So in social studies a couple of days ago from now, we talk about the sad death, of Betty white.  Then one of my friends go on about how she was so close to being 100, but in a weird and funny way. “Dang she was so close to being at level 100- I mean 100 years old.”   Pretty much my whole class was laughing on how he wait level instead of years.  And then I said this: “bro she was 17 exp from leveling up”
I met her in Ally Mcbeal, she was hilarious there
Let's not forget her several appearances on Boston Legal. She was such a stick of dynamite. I love her, and we all miss her.
She went out like fireworks - 99 years of age, on New Year’s Eve.   We all loved Betty ❤️ I hope she is with the love of her life now in paradise.  🙏🏼
Aww I love Betty White. Rip you beautiful girl.
She will always be a legend
You know your spicel when people think you died to young at 99  R.I.P 🙏🏽💓
Betty White managed to be the coolest old lady ever. She was making teenage fans even in her 90's. Gone but never forgotten.
MOTHERFUCKING LEGEND.
Now she's with her beloved husband Allen Ludden playing Password. RIP BETTY A truly beloved woman.🙏🙏🌻🌻
omg, this made me cry. RIP Betty, you deserve a nice rest after all the work you did and all the joy you brought your fans. we will miss you dearly
Betty White was so much more than this crappy video.
Don't know how many times I cried and laughed with this one! Thank you MsMojo!
If I could be half as amazing as her I would be fulfilled.
Thank you so very much for this tribute. I have watched everything she ever did. I was a small child when she started and I'm now an old lady💜 I will miss her terribly and will NEVER find anyone to compare to her. She was a one of a kind.💜💜💜
I think Lake Placid deserves a mention
RIP Sweet Betty White..
I will add when on Match Game she had to match a contestant and the word was PASS (Blank) of course the contestant said WORD  as in PASSWORD that Betty had played in all versions and her husband Allan Ludden had been a host for many years. She had put KEY in the blank and then realized her mistake.
My opinion it was the booster
wow you TALK SO MUCH... show the videos
A dang shame....she will be missed.
all
Bettie White was an angel in life and now one for real ❤❤❤ Betty! You'll always be a Golden Girl!
Betty white always makes me smile and I think that’s true for most who watched her. What a great gift she had
The actual #1 Betty White moment was the moment when she was born.
Good woman with a good heart, god damn R.I.P. Betty White.
Illuminati puppet, vulgar old 'woman', their 'god is satan, they worship idols, hollywood is dead.
Rip Betty  White 💛
I remember when she was on dancing with stars. She was great
She was a treasure she will be sorely missed😥
Every moment that includes Betty White is my favorite Betty White moment.
She's the only person I know of that was basically a century old and, still, the general consensus is that she's gone waaaay too soon. Rest in peace, Betty.
I loved her moment in the proposal movie
awesome review on betty white
Betty white was this outstanding actress. May she rest upon her golden life.
Now that's white priveledge her entire life but I'm not jealous just grateful for her.
Betty was amazing!  She was like everyone's favorite Grandma. So much love and humor from one person.
Wow ! What an amazing career ! What an amazing woman ! So impressive to wintess her growing over the years (without butchering her face, here I had to add that, however shallow is it).
When it got to number 10 and she said she was thanking us and for putting up with her..... I was so close to crying.... To prevent myself from crying I had to laugh but the only joke I can think of right now is that death is at a claw machine trying to get the Queen of England but got Betty instead....he got the wrong Queen!
Anything Betty White touched was my favorite.
Betty white is truly an amazing woman and got me through so much as a kid, Rest In Peace to the kindest soul, the most talented actress and a true legend she will be greatly missed and remembered ❤️
Never will forget her line in Lake placid to the sheriff “ if I had a dick this is we’re I’d tell you to suck it” RIP Betty White
I think she is my role model.
Gonna miss you sassy lady. You left us with so many memories to carry on to our kids. Rest in paradise
Only somebody this wonderful can bring 55K likes and zero dislikes to a video.
She was the world’s beloved grandmother!
It's a grossly overused and underdeserved title, but Betty White TRULY is a national treasure. UFF DA!
A Great Lady  ! RIP Betty!
My favorite was #11 The Proposal was hilarious
Boston Legal..she was a regular in this show. It’s never mentioned. One of best shows on TV. She was hilarious. She will be missed.
Pure Class is what she was…….Rest In Peace Ms Betty White…….You will Definitely will be Missed….
Lame attempt at click bait
Rest in peace Betty White 🙏❤️😞
Loved her.  Need more people like her
I love you Betty. Rest in Power!
Nice try...but the most CLASSIC moment is the line she delivers in "Lake Placid". You know the one.
Thank you for being a friend 🧡
How did she stay so humble? I think thats why we always loved her and will continue to love her, she was always positive and down to earth. She cared more about doing good in the world and making people laugh then about herself. Betty White, you are an icon, and will always be remembered!
BETTY   WHITE  WAS    THE   BEST    PERSON       SHE  LIVE  A  GOOD   LIFE   ,   SHE   WAS  ON  THE  GOLD  GIRLS  SHE  WAS  A  STAR    AND  THE  OTHER  GIRLS    , THEY ALL STAR   ,   THEY  WILL  BE  MISS  AND  LOVE  ,BY  FANS  ,,
Bless her cotton socks 🙏 she will be missed 🧡
She was everyone friend. And everyone would do anything for her. She was loved that much and so much more. RIP America's Sweetheart. ❤️❤️
Betty White was truly amazing.  She will greatly be missed. Someone everyone should look up to. Her strength of character is amazing.
Can you imagine how hard it would be to be Sandra Bullock and try to keep it together with Betty White for that scene?!?!?! LOVE! 😂🤣😆
I just...man, I can't watch her without smiling.  Every moment she's on the screen, there's a smile on my face.  I never met her, and I'll never know her, but I loved that woman.
45 seconds of great moments with the rest of it just gabbing on , perhaps less play by play and let the clips run. painful to listen to.
She was awesome whatever she did.
ABSOLUTE LEGEND!!!!!!!!!! ANOTHER ANGEL WHERE SHE BELONGS X
Lake Placid nuff said!
What a beautiful lady. Thank you for being a friend.😘😘❤️❤️
Thank you for being a Friend.
The Queen of Comedy!
Miss you 😪 Rest In Peace.
Hot in Cleveland blooper 'Bender Over ...'  Hilarious
I can’t watch this without crying.  I watched Betty White on tv or movies all my life. Just realized she was only a few months younger then my mom.  With them both dying on New Year’s Eve, I can’t see her without thinking of my mom. my mom liked Betty White.  She used to get a kick out of Betty’s character on Golden Girls. They were both great women. RIP mom and RIP Betty may you meet up in heaven.
RIP Betty White - Thank you for being the most awesome friend ever to us all.
Where is Lake Placid!?  RIP Betty, we're gonna miss you terribly
Kind of disappointed that her role in Lake Placid isn't on this list. She was great in that movie.
Betty was the type of celebrity that, you thought was always going to be there?! I only know her from The Golden Girls because I'm Irish.
Lake Placid shoulda been in her honorable mentions!! Now granted, she’s been amazing in everything so ig it was a hard call, but her role in that movie is hilarious! We’ll miss you forever, Betty White🥺❤️
Managed to live an incredibly long life but was still somehow not long enough
Betty was so natural and genuine. She deserved a better narrator for this collection of scenes.
We just never knew what Betty White was going to say or do, I believe this her way of bowing out early, “I’m just going to quit while I’m ahead” 🤣
While I appreciate...no1 cares she had covud booster 3 days before death?. SHE tweeted it!! Ofc her agent doesn't want that to be her legacy but it happened.
The Morgan Freeman tribute is my favorite.
What about bringing down the house???
With her impeccable sense of comedic timing, Betty waited until everyone had all her 100th birthday stuff printed, prepared and ready to go, then stole all their thunder and passed away just before. She got the final laugh on everybody. We will never again see anyone with her grace, charm, style and ability to entertain everyone from age 10 upward. She was the grandmother everyone wished they had.
Every single Betty White moment is my favorite! She was just one beautiful human being that lived to make people happy. And she accomplished that to the fullest. I heard her say once on The Golden Girls," that why do people get sick before they die? Why can't they just check out one day? That is how it should be" and that is exactly what she did! What a legacy! I have nothing but❤❤❣ for this very special woman! Thank you for making me laugh. And for the joy that you brought to the world. your mission has been accomplished!
God Bless You Betty White and all family and friends 💖may You rest in peace 💖💝
She has literally done everything.
RIP the last Golden Girl is gone😭
Betty was a one of a kind, once in a lifetime, opinionated, strong willed, hilariously saucy, sassy bad@$$ b*tch!  She definitely made a huge impact on entertainment and the world in general. She will be missed but not forgotten. Fortunately, between Life With Elizabeth and MTM, we learned to record. ☺️
Please don't make false claims. The Golden Girls often showed support for L/G communities. B never came up and T, Q, +, wasn't even a thing while the show was on.
This hit me hard too. Man she was funny! We love you Betty White!
Will be truly missed 😞 ❤️
cant believe you missed the Shatner roast
Goodbye, Betty.  It was a pleasure.  I can't remember a time when you weren't on TV.  You will be missed.
Very nice compilation from Betty White's career...I was just missing one very different side of her acting talent. She played Stephanie Forrester's ( and sister Pam) mother in the Bold & Beautiful. Totally NOT comedy but very very well acted as a monstrous mother. And I love her for that, she was incredible as a non-likable character.  R.I.P. dear, dear Betty White, love u very much
Her Boston Legal appearances didn't get an honorable mention?
RIP Betty White, I loved you so much 🤍
❤️
Betty White was such an impact! We didn't deserve Betty White. And the hard thing is, we knew that fact for such a long time. I grew up with Sue Ann Nivens and also adored Rose Nylund ... she was just part of my life
So enjoyed watching your picks, I'm 72, and have watched Ms. Betty White since I was a little girl. Everyone loved her. Yes a true legend sadly has passed on. But Ms. White proved into her late age, you can love and live a life to the fullest when a heart is good. Ms. White had a beautiful heart, and was funny as heck. I know your resting  peacefully ❤❤🌹❤❤
❤️
My heart cannot take it... I loved her as if she was actually a member of my family... This woman will forever be missed
She was such a gift and will be greatly missed
I just read Peoples magazine about Betty White turning 100, so what a Shock to hear that she passed at 99 just 2 weeks shy of her birthday! 😟 The only consolation was that she died peacefully in her sleep and lived life to the Fullest to her last day. It is us and the animals that will suffer the most from her passing. She is joining her Beloved Alan in Heaven, and they will be laughing and loving with all of the others who came before! RIP DEAR BETTY WHITE!♥️🙏🏼🤙🏻
"Was only supposed to be a one-time appearance" should pretty much be her tagline.
It's nice to have such a wholesome icon.
I have loved this amazing woman since I was a kid and totally obsessed with the Golden Girls. She could always bring a smile to your face and warm your heart. Her life was amazing and she only got more and more loveable as time went on. She will live on the screen and in our hearts forever ♥
I was so ready for her 100th birthday party to be epic and off-the-wall. Can't blame her for noping out of 2022 though.
Hot in Cleveland and especially the bloopers, in which Betty again steals the show with her marvellous performing and timing en comical sense and feeling❣ (And thank you for your being an lgbtiq ally and for other good causes). She will be missed all over the world, the "grand dame of comedy" but also in shining herself with her eternal youthful smile and twinkeling in her eyes. Age didn't play any part in her being herself and laughing with herself. May you be a shining star with an eternal glow, a golden girl forever❣
love her in Lake Placid. Love Golden Girls and hot in Cleveland. She's so funny , a great actress. RIP Betty. i didn't know she could sing. she was a good singer
While saddened when a well loved celebrity passed, I've only cried twice in my life - when Chris Cornell died and now the lovely and iconic Betty White
One of the few celebrities I've mourned the loss of. Such a wonderful, hilarious woman 💗😥
Spongebob's Grandma!
The day before she died my fiance and I were literally talking about how devastating this would be. We talked about how we hoped she would at least stay around until April so our son could live and breathe in the same world as her.  RIP Betty White
Loved her on the Liars club  show
Betty and Queen Latifah never rapped together, but they did collaborate in Bringing Down the House.
RIP Betty White.  You will be missed.
A gracious lady who never compromised her principals no matter what it cost her. Much admired
Thank you so much for posting this 🖖🏻 Betty White was truly and unquestionably the real first Lady of television. She was the first woman to produce a national TV show, the first woman to star in a sitcom, the first woman to receive an Emmy nomination – and the first woman to ever appear on television, given her performance on an experimental broadcast in 1939. No one could ever touch her accomplishments. A pioneer of the medium. And a pioneer for women. An animal rights activists. She paid for a private plane to relocate otters and penguins from Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans in the aftermath of 2005′s Hurricane Katrina. Unselfish, caring, empathetic, strong willed who championed causes near and dear to her heart. Her kind is not likely to ever be seen again, especially in this evil, vacuous, self entitled, selfish, egomaniacal world of today where it's all about "ME" while taking and posting hundreds of selfies of yourself and where you're at. I love you Betty ❤️
...💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🥲....
She was literally my most favorite lady in all of Hollywood...❤
My home economics teacher in junior high, was college roommates with Rue McClanahan. She said she was exactly like her Golden Girls character in real life. If you wonder how popular the show was, it was being talked about by 8th graders who liked it. Back then though, usually the family watched he same thing, as not everyone had computers, or cell phones, etc. The show is still funny after 30 years. RIP Betty White. She's the only famous actress/actor who I can say with confidence,everyone loves her!
Such a legend. Rest in peace Betty.
Absolutely agree with these choices.. You did great. We love Betty White.
I agree.
Our last sweet Golden Girl gone. I'm sad, but also happy we had her on our screens for so long. She was truly a muse of comedy as well recognized as Lucille Ball herself. It wasn't shown here, but anyone who hasn't seen her episode on Community might get a kick out of it. RIP you beautiful priceless sweetheart. You've meant the world to us.
Rest in peace, Queen! I will miss you so much. Love you always. 💜
Betty White had a childlike aura, even when she swore like a sailor. She could also do everything, acting, singing, dancing, you name it. And then there's her love of animals. She put her money where her heart is. She's loved by all and will be missed. RIP, Betty, you've earned it. ❤❤❤❤
I feel like they needed to talk about her in the simpsons because she really got under Homer simpson sink and she didn't even have to be mean lol. But over all betty white is an amazing actor and can't wait to see her in heaven when the time comes 🙂🙏
One of the best. RIL Betty White
Off Their Rockers, should have been included in this list.
She was the best of us! 2021 had to take one more thing from us. She will be so missed! She was so loved and admired! There will never be anyone like her ever again.
There was a time when my relationship with my mom was strained heavily. We talked and bonded over golden girls for a long time and I really owe that show and Rose's character to helping to mend that relationship. Betty white found a way to transcend time and generations of people through living a remarkable life. Rest in peace you legend of a woman.
Betty White was a great part of my life....from twilight zone to Mary Tyler Moore and Golden Girls and then Hot in Cleveland....I will miss you dear lady, RIP my sweet dear friend....
"Lets see if we can find yr boobs" 😂🤣  Rest in Peace Betty🙏❤
One of the truly great talents of the century She was a true humanitarian See you on the other side RIP Betty White You will be missed ♥️
R.i.p Betty ❤️first time I remember watching her in the golden girls and she was a beautiful lady ❤️
SNL “cherry” episode should be honorable mention, it was hysterical IMO. I have spent so many years loving this woman like the mother I never had. Hearing of her death was like getting punched in the gut. Listening to her narrate her autobiography was the best audiobook experience I ever had and I highly recommend it! R.I.P. Beautiful Betty 🥰
I can see why Betty and Lucille Ball were good friends because Betty stood up to racists when they didn't want Duncan on the show because he was African-American and much like Lucille Ball she married a Hispanic and anyone who didn't like it had to deal with it. Good for them.
The way the audience ROARED for Betty at The People's Choice Awards. very moving.
Anytime Betty White was on Hollywood Squares.
Blessings Betty White for standing up to the world against hatred, racism, love rights especially through the 40' to now! Wow! What character and integrity throughout all these years. Plus your gifts and talent as a artist of film and stage especially comedy.  💟👋👌✌🤙👍✊👊🤛🤜👏🙌🤝🙏
I will never forget The Golden Girls
LOVED HER!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
She was just a fantastic woman. Absolutely love her and she will be so very missed.
My favourite Betty White, was the one in the Mary Tyler-Moore show.. stole the show in my opinion and took sarcasm to a whole new level, just pure class. You will be sadly missed Miss White. Rest in peace. 🤗
After all the hoaxes, I knew deep down this day would come. Now that it's here, I think I underestimated how sad I would be. Never really felt that for a celebrity. Your fans will miss you dearly, Betty White❤
She is the definition of one of a kind. A true humble amazing person.
Love you Betty White 🌹🌹
She will be missed 😢🤍
She is without a doubt, the woman of television. I loved her so much that I always looked forward to her performance whether it was a TV show or movie. She was one in a million and I doubt there will ever be another one like her. Rest in peace Betty and perhaps I'll met you someday on the other side. Rest In Peace.
Grandma Annie was a amazing role ❤️
A pity her roasting Shatner didn't appear on this list, but with so much competition for great moments it's not too hard to see why.
RIP Betty
This has hit me real hard. I was so hoping she'd make it to 100. She almost did. She was just one day older than my father. Daddy died in January 2016, just six days after turning 94. I'm surprised no one mentioned her role in the giant crocodile movie, "Lake Placid." She was funny in it. Rip Betty.
Love you Betty!!! If you haven't already catch the Netflix documentary of her. What an amazing life she led and deservedly so. RIP Betty and hope you are now catching up with the love of your life :)
Its too bad she was misled and fooled into advocating for depravity and sexual dysfunction.  But I am sure God will forgive her.
Hardly many know that Betty White and Barbara Bush are sisters.. their dad is Alister Crowley..  Look it up..
Bottom line is Betty is Family!
RIP Betty White.  Such a wonderful actress.  Saw her for the first time in Seinfeld.  Surprised that didn't get a mention here.  But then again, I'm sure there were so many other moments that your list could've reached 1,000.
Y’all had this video on stand by
Thank you Ms. Mojo but with Betty White's passing being as fresh as it is, despite your truly happy clips of some of her best moments, I still couldn't help but cry through a lot of it. Gimme another week. In the meantime, please find some more of things like her funniest moments if you would. The loss of her feels as close as if she was a member of my family.
Im sitting crying again. We love Betty. Im so sad
🕊🤍🕊
I remember the time I was watching the movie Lake Placid. When she was on her porch talking to the police about what happened to her husband, the cop said something that she didn't like and she told him "If I had a d**k, this is where I would tell you to suck it!" I had never heard her speak like that before but I laughed my butt off! You will be missed but never forgotten ! RIP Betty , Fly high Golden Girl !
"Do you agree with our picks?" Jesus, MsMojo, you could take any 20 clips from Betty White's career, put them together in a posting, and you would still have a top 20. She was that good!  I firmly believe that if you put together a posting of all of her St Olaf stories, you would have a major force weapon in the battle against depression!  RIP Betty White. I know that you and Allen are happily making heaven laugh.
She was such a genuine person!
I loved her! Such wit and love at the same time!
Wow R.I.P.
I love her .. this world has lost one it’s brightest starts .. .. she will never be forgotten
One of the greatest regrets of my life is I never got a chance to propose to her. I have been in love with her as long as I can remember.
I wonder why people don't see being humble keeps you around longer. Thank you Betty for all the  your authenticity, sincerity, and the laughs that couldn't help coming from the heart. 🙏❤
I never knew of that Elizabeth series. They never air that anywhere. So sad. I wish they did. I wish I was famous & beloved & worked with her. She looked great wrapping video. She was so hip. I wish I had read her book & had a chance to get it signed. Her personality kept her living that well so long. Omg kissing Bradley Cooper. I wish she had been my mom. I live the Snickers commercial. Best ever made. A national treasure. What a chrt she was. I only knew her from The Golden Girls.
Cicely Tyson and Betty White both made it nearly to 100. Both had such longevity in a business that was less than kind to women and to bring such joy to people of every walk of life is quite a feat.
One of the things I've always noticed about Betty White was that she was always elegant. She was always classy. She was always beautiful. She will be greatly missed.
No love for Lake Placid? She stole the whole movie. Thank you, Betty. We will miss you.
You think it's funny for an old lady to be using the F word?
Betty was the Darling of Hollywood her whole life.  We will all miss her!!  RIP Miss White.
I’m still in denial that we no longer have the greatest human alive. She made giant strides for those in the lgbtq community as well as people of color in a time that wasn’t welcoming of change and she never changed regardless of the backlash it caused and yet she became the greatest actress of all time. No one else has come close to her standards. Even tho I’m sad she’s gone I feel content knowing she’s finally able to be with her husband her one true love whom she never forgot or went against even after his passing. May they be up in Heaven living the dream life they so wished to have had down here
Shine on, Golden Girl. You were just too bright for this world & we did not deserve you.
Amazing career, amazing lady!
I reckon She even got a standing ovation from heaven, when She got there!
i hate getting old coz it comes with the reality that the people we like, the people we grew up listening and watching will eventually die. It's either that or we go first. But either way, it's sad to think that the things we love will come to an end.
Loved her in lake placid
She "IS" a priceless GEM. I love you Betty.....
She still got the last laugh ey, was like screw ya's all and dipped out before her 100th! I love her so much ❤ thank You for the laughs Betty White ❤
She's not only a Brilliant Actress and the Most Funniest Woman in the World, but she's also a Talented Voice Actress as well. 🤲🛐📿🙏😞😟😢🥺😭
Dusty Muffin
I guess Betty White knew it was her time to come. Guess it's been fun with Betty White Throughout the Years While It Lasted. She will be Missed. We'll All Miss Betty White Deeply. May God Bless Betty White's Soul. R.I.P. 😞😟😢🥺😭🤲🛐📿🙏
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!! WHEN DO YOU PLAY THE TRUMP CARD!!!! Until the world sees the TRUTH!  “I was right about a lot of things and I’ll tell you this, I’ll be right about the election.” - 45  IT WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!! AUDIT ALL THE STATES!!!!! DEEP STATE CAN KISS MY ASS!!!! I HAVE NOT conceded the election!  This is very important for what comes next.  You see, if AZ decertifies their results the ENTIRE election is now in question. Congress cannot certify election until ALL states have certified. Just like a state cannot certify unless 100% of their counties certify, the same is true of a national election with the states themselves.  As Trump hasn't conceded, he now has a right to contest the entire election and that will mean the remaining 49 states will have to conduct a full forensic audit as a result.  Why do you think so many states are visiting AZ for the audit right now, including states that supposedly already went Trump and didn't have contested election issues? They know what is coming.  Do you all remember prior to the 2018 election Trump signed an EO13848 making national elections a matter of national security?  >>>Now put two and two together. If even ONE state shows fraud it calls into question the results >>>of the entire election. Being a matter of national security now puts it under the purview of >>>who as forensic audits are done state to state?  If you answered the military you are on the right track. I AM COMEING THE BEST IS YET TO COME!!!!That means they're playing along with Trump and im in control they've already given Trump back his power they've already reinstated him they reinstated them recentlyRemember the story of Moses?  Moses was probably #2 or #3 in all of Egypt. Mr. Egypt if you will. Trained beside Pharaoh's son.  God never has to get your permission or explain why he uses anybody. None above another.  God chose Mr. Egypt to free the slaves from Egypt while sending plagues that made fun of all the fake gods of Baal  So let's fast-forward to today  The Globalist Baal Worshippers have enslaved much of the Earth  God imo sent us a man. A man that knows how to navigate Corporations. God sent us Mr. Corporation, to free us from the power of, the corporation  He is the chosen one in that respect. That's my opinion since the day Trump won in 2016.  He caught them all. Only he could have done that, because God did it through him.  God doesn't call the qualified Only Jesus is qualified  He qualifies the called His calling is without Repentance  So ...Preach the Word! Be instant! In Season! Out of Season!!  We are called by God Asked by Q+ To be in this information war  That's all I need to know🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 WHEN DO YOU PLAY THE TRUMP CARD!!!!

TRUMP OCTOBER 8, 2021 BEDMINSTER, NJ  Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America  I have sent a letter to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration in defense of the Office of the Presidency, the Constitution, vital principles of separation of powers, and on behalf of our great Nation. The Radical Left Democrats tried the RUSSIA Witch Hunt, they tried the fake impeachments, and now they are trying once again to use Congress to persecute their political opponents. Their requests are not based in law or reality—it's just a game to these politicians. They don't care about our Country or the American people.  The Democrats are drunk on power, but this dangerous assault on our Constitution and important legal precedent will not work. This Committee's fake investigation is not about January 6th any more than the Russia Hoax was about Russia. Instead, this is about using the power of the government to silence "Trump" and our Make America Great Again movement, the greatest such achievement of all time. We won two elections, did far better in the second than the first, and now perhaps have to do it a third time! It is also about trying to deflect blame from Biden's surrender in Afghanistan and the failures to address COVID, the border, crime, and the economy that is leaving Americans dead or broke. It's another grand distraction, because Biden and the Democrats don't want you to see how badly America is losing due to their incompetence.  My administration, and the great patriots who worked on behalf of the American people, will not be intimidated. We will not allow Biden or the Radical Democrats to get off without accepting blame for their incompetence and failures. I will always fight for America First, and the Constitution. Together, we will Make America Great Again, Again!
My favorite Betty White moment? All of them!
So devastated. Wanted Betty around forever 💔
Bless her heart ❤️ she will truly be missed , Thank you for the laughs 🙏
True Legends Never Really Die. Betty White is a true legend.
🥺🥺🥺
Now that I just saw a few minutes of this video, I want to say.. RIP Betty White. Betty White will be forever in the stars upon us 🌷. I hope Betty White's birthday would become a holiday.. 💝
22:13 The People's Choice? At 93?   You damn right Betty!!!!!!!! 🌹💕🌹💕
She was a literal angel, and now she's gone home.
You missed her cameo in Community.  "And that is why you fail "
One of my favorite moments was watching her roast William Shatner.
I’m so glad that we were able to show her how much we loved her while we had her. Thank you Betty for being a friend. ❤️
A class act. They don't make 'em like this anymore. 💗💔 National Treasure.
They don't make 'em like that any more.
The first thing I remember seeing her in was lake placid. "Officer f*ck meat"
There's a viral thing going around to donate to animal charities like $5 in her name on Jan 17 (her birthday). I already did. Betty White was kickass and classy <3
I genuinely liked this woman...heaven is blessed...Allen was waiting...xoxo
This makes me tear up😭
I can't believe that her character on the massive hit show Boston Legal wasn't even mentioned!  Her character even murdered someone.  Kinda out of character for her character but ....
Beautiful job! Thank you!!
Thank you MsMoja team for making this
I loved her! The proposal
Sue Ann Nivens was the best.   If you only know Betty White from the Golden Girls, check out her character on the Mary Tyler Moore Show as Sue Ann Nivens.  Classic!!  Her best!
rest in peace betty white you will be missed and we love you❤️
She was such an incredibly talented lady. She'll be missed dearly but she's left us with so many memories & so many shows to continue enjoying her on. Only thing missing here tho was her role in Lake Placid. When she him she was rooting for the alligator & hoped he ate his friends I died laughing!! She was amazing!!
The good of Including everyday everyone, every where with simplicity  of blending  humor, smiles, and joys...thank you Betty for being such a true example with sharing  love of life...
Such a shame she never got to see her 100th birthday   Loved watching the Golden Girls with my  gran when I was a small child back in the 80s
She had killer dimples too!
Love her. What a lady! You didn't mention her great line in Lake Placid.
RIP Betty White, thank you for being a friend!!
What a lady!!!! Love Betty White!!!!
Should have got a Boston Legal or William Shatner Roast clip in there...
She was truly a wonderful lady and actress..  I loved each of the shows and movies she did.  Ms White you were one the greatest people who I loved watching.  May you keep them laughs rolling above 😇😇😇😭😭😭😭
I have been watching the amazing Betty White since I was a child in the 70’s. I have never seen anything she has done that was less than stellar which is one reason why her star shines so brightly. The world is so much dimmer without her beaming soul in it.  I am heartbroken,  I honestly never thought God would take her from us. RIP Betty. I know there is a huge party going on at the rainbow bridge in your honor. You surely deserve all of the celebration the humans and animals alike can give you, as well as the tears of sadness shed for our loss. Betty White was the worlds grandma and there will never be another sassy, brilliant, funny, compassionate, and dare I say “sailor tongued” grandma type like her again. Thanks for the memories and helping solidify my sassiness. I learned from the best!
I wasn’t expecting Higgins (John Hillerman) to make his appearance in this video!
BRB gotta re-watch golden girls.
Anything with Betty in it should be #1 R.I.P. Miss Betty 😭
All hail a queen!
No one can match her she is one of a kind lovely funny caring and so much more ❤️
Thanks, Pfizer.
The number one moment, she died.
She was sooooo beautiful 😍 😢 ❤ RIP is your turn to rest,  you have us all of you and we enjoyed every minute of you❤❤
I'm so glad Ms. White was given her roses while she was still with us... I'm tearing bcuz I truly love this lady like she's a family member.   Thank you Betty White for all the years of laughter, you will be missed❤❤❤❤❤❤💔💔
I want to be just like Betty White when I grow up!! Rest in laughter Ms. Betty! God  bless ❤❤❤❤
Thanks for this tribute, brought tears to my eyes.
We love and miss you Betty girl ❤
A true magical person!
I love Betty White when she plays Rose on the Golden Girls
This still hits so hard I have so many good memories of watching the Golden Girls with my great grandmother and the reruns helped me alot when she passed.  R.I.P to one of the dearest and most loved actresses of all time your legend will never be forgotten and thank you for being a friend.
Why no mention of her cameos on Boston Legal? As usual, she was hilarious in her role as the "sandwich lady".
A National Treasure she will be missed.
4:25 - 4:40 wat she sayd
When I heard of her passing it brought me to tears. Rip Betty. We will miss you badly. God must have needed someone to make him laugh. Can't wait till I see you there
IMO you forgot to bring up her role in the Hallmark Movie The Lost Valentine.  I seen the other side of Betty White.  She can also make you cry
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
you´ve been sitting on this video am i right
All moments with Betty were top
Oh Betty, thanks for all that you gave us!! You were quite the broad!!
You forgot the 21th moment, when she fucking died
Dislike
My favorite BW moment, whenever that dear woman smiled. A true legend in every sense of the word.
I also loved her In her numerous guest appearances like in King of The Hill, Family Guy, Boston Legal, That 70s Show,  Malcolm in the Middle,  etc
She lived an optimistic life and died with peace. She was a soul who achieved something we would call rare these days. RIP Betty White.
We should all aspire to be more like Betty. It would also be awesome if we could get i'm still hot to a top spot for her birthday
Rip my lovely!!!
What a fabulous human being...she'll be missed...May she rest in peace
I love the part in”The Proposal” where she was in the woods with Sandra bullock.
Rest In Peace 💔
How is her roast of Will not on here. HOLY SHIT she was so funny on that
Betty White gives me mood swings. One minute she brings tears to my eye, the next I'm LMAO! Rest in Peace Betty you will be very missed.
JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖
My favorite golden girl.. and such an amazing person loved her!!!
Funny to the end! Absolutely loved her.
I just watched the clip of her oogling Jason Momoa on Conan lol 😂
I can't believe she only hosted SNL once, she absolutely DESTROYED that episode. The Straight Talk sketch with Keenan is one of my favorites
She was Not as she was portrayed.
2021 be like, I have just enough time left to kick you all in the nuts one last time.
Such a great actress 👏 You missed her appearances in Boston legal.
Another legend gone. RIP Betty, you are an angel now.
Truly ... She was ... a Golden Girl!💛
I miss her already.
Evil woman.
Nice to see clips from the old regressive days when comedy was actually allowed. I liked her in Lake Placid.
She will be greatly missed. I hope the younger actors can learn from her.
all of them
Her kindness is evident in her progressive support, way before popular, of animals, people of color, and the LGBTQ community. That's her true tribute.
Betty White was a gift to the world!
This world is less without Betty White! ❤❤
Betty White just had to appear to make me smile, whether it was Awards shows, SNL, talk shows and all the wonderful parts she brought to life in various tv shows. The lines that only she could deliver, she will be genuinely missed.
OFF THEIR ROCKERS was my favorite show she was on🤣🤣
My favorite Betty White moment occurred on Boston Legal  when she bashed her insufferable husband in the head with her cast iron frying pan and killed him.  Of course she needed a lawyer.
My most favorite movie she was in was Ponyo as the old women
Is there just ONE favorite anything of Betty White? She did it all. I love you Betty White, Rest Peacefully Ma'am.
What a wonderful way to remember a truly inspirational Lady! 🌠
💐🌸🌺🌷🌹🌼🌻
My favorite Betty White performance was the episode "Sue Ann's Sister" from the Mary Tyler Moore Show.   There were several moments in that episode that were really funny.   We get to see that Sue Ann has a round vibrating bed with mirrors on the ceiling.  Such a hoot.  Her sister was played by Pat Priest....Marilyn from the Munsters.
I’m still in shock
Beautiful from inside and out, from start to finish.
An Angel🙏💖🙏
Betty white and john madden with in a few days of each other rip y'all will be remembered for ever
Mojo: What's your favorite Betty White moment?  Me: All.
She was a wonderful comedian, I also loved her when she played the grandma in That 70s Show!!
Betty White has always been my very most , undeniable, favorite actress and comedian, EVER !  I still find tears rolling down my face , whenever I see tributes to her, find myself thinking of her, or see shows with her in it.  She was an angel on this earth, albeit an ornery one 😄!   I know she is in heaven now, still making people laugh !  You don’t lose your personality when you pass, and I’m sure she is “tickled pink” to be able to walk right up to all of those animals , she always adored and raised funds for, without the worry of being harmed :). She must be having a blast with her beloved animals !
How could you forget her legendary role in Lake Placid?
I was in Chimney Rock, NC, on vacation when I got the alert on my phone about her passing and my first thought was "Oh No!!"  I was sad that she was gone, but I was also upset that she wouldn't get to see her 100th birthday or that we wouldn't get to share it with her.  I am not sure which of those sentiments I felt more acutely.  RIP Betty, we will miss you.
R.I.P to a legend and funny funny woman. Betty White will be missed
May she Rest In Peace
God bless you Betty White. You will always be one of the most beautiful, funniest, and sweetest woman ever. You will be missed always. Rest in peace 🙏 ♥️
That's something else if you can get the legendary Morgan Freeman to tear up. That was touching. <3
Betty White was the best!! I love this lady. Such a wonderful personality! You’ll be missed Betty!! ❤️❤️
Rip! In peace Betty surely I've enjoy a fruitful life. We will truly miss you.The Animals I've loved is missing ur living kindness.🙏🙏♥️♥️🖕🐕🐕
RIP Betty White!!
Betty best scene was singing hello morgan from hello dolly lol 😂 😂 😂 he was happy to see her and loved her u could see it , it was so touching 🍷 sad news.
I love you Rose <3
How did they miss her role in Boston Legal? She had a catch phrase in that."I killed a man". She been in most of our lives for most of our lives. Rest in peace Betty and thanks for the great memories.
I am still trying to wrap my head around Betty White's death. She was a second mother to other actors and actresses, and fans a like. She gave us so many years of laughter and good times. Thank you Betty White for all that you have done for others. You my sweet angel will be sorely missed. RIP Betty White.
Rest in power Betty you're a real GOAT!🔥♥️
One of the VERY FEW people in showbiz to receive their flowers while still alive.
She was just the best ! 💝
She will be missed!
Rest in peace Betty White ❤️
What a gift she was to the world.. she could make you laugh,  and she could make you cry from laughing.  She was thankful for her fans and how rare can you honestly say that about stars nowadays.  I wish we could of had her around for a lot longer but at 99 her body said she had accomplished enough and hopefully (no matter what everyone believes) went on to a place that cherished her as much as her earthly fans. Rest easy sweet lady... you will be truly missed
What an amazing life she had! RIP Betty 💜
Betty....we miss you allready.
God Bless this Woman she will be missed and i doubt the world will ever see another like her :(
"Happy Mothers Day, Mother F^ckers"
TOO SOON😓😓😓😓😓
I will forever be haunted by the fact that I haden't ever met - or made out with Betty White-  I am sure she is blushing and thinking about it!  🙂
RIP Queen Betty, Hot in Cleveland, The Golden Girls and Mary Tyler Moore Show are my all time favorites from this timeless icon. Elka, fly high in heaven!!
The scene where she feeds a cow to a monster crocodile!!!! Legend!!!! Fly high Betty, I'm sure you are dancing with Alan and sipping coffee with "the girls" We love you, and thanks for all the memories that we can watch on perpetual replay!
One of my favorites is when she was finding Sandra Bullock’s boobs in Proposal! There they are! LOL RIP Betty.
Too bad she was a Satanist
Thank you Betty for all the laughs! Now it's time to crack 'em up in Heaven. Your hubby has been waiting a long time for you ❤ Love you bunches!
The Proposal is one of my favorite movies and Gramma Annie was one of my favorite characters 🥰🥰🥰
IS IT TRUE SHE TOOK THE JAB JUST A COUPLE DAYS B4?
God bless and may she rest in peace!
Betty White was such a beautiful woman
My favorite Betty moments was the snickers commercial & when she guest stared on Raw. God bless her soul. R.I.P.
She was so amazing, and classy, and funny. I couldn't believe it when I saw the news ☹ R.I.P Betty, we will miss you tremendously 💔
That woman was a national treasure! May she RIP.
Rest in peace sunflower
What an extraordinary person! The world already is a poorer place without her humor and class.
Thank you Betty White for allowing us to be blessed with your talents 🥰 I will miss you very much 💔🐾
My favorite is her playing football in that Snickers commercial
I have watched her on TV since the 60's. She was a person the world needs more of, I'm sure we would be much better off.   Rest in peace Betty White.
You brought such joy to so many for so long... I don't feel you're truly gone. Thank you for your compassion and kindness.
Rest in Peace Betty White! Loved you ever since I saw you first... Till we meet again
Betty White was an amazing example of how humanity should behave. An animal advocate, a logical, progressive, kind, nonhypocritical, act-don’t-just-talk, never take yourself too seriously, vivacious, and humble woman. I hope we make her proud. I guess God needed to laugh too. Rest In Peace dear Betty.
This was a joy to watch! Thank you for putting this together! RIP Betty White.
My favorite moment is just seeing Betty White God bless her and we will miss her.
RIP Betty, clear as a bell in mind until the last day. You truly will be missed.
I’m 68 and remember most of Betty Whites shows. I just loved the quick comebacks that were Betty White and always with a smile!! You will be missed!
Her appearance on an episode of Cake Boss was iconic
im gonna miss betty white
I was hoping the commercial she was in with Daniel Bryan and Kane would be somewhere on this list. That was pretty funny.
This is just the beginning  Sadly you sleeping folks are in for a real jolt. When the truth is no longer hidden from you. Any one who has been or is currently big in Hollywood is dirty. How dirty do you wonder?  The Storm is Upon Us Baton down your hatches say your prayers  Shit is hitting the fan and sadly she's one of them. I cried my tears 2 yrs ago when I woke from my programed slumber. The two that really hurt me Was Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reaves. I still cry just thinking about it.
Her role in Lake Placid is my favorite!
#11 I saw that movie and had no idea that was Betty White. She was pretty funny. Although she was WAY before my time, it's so sad she's gone. May she Rest In Peace.
One of the best actress's there was ...RIP Betty White ..your fans will miss you!❤
You know you're a legend when a video commemorating your legacy is at almost 50k likes and 0 dislikes ❤❤ RIP Betty White
You know you're a legend when a video commemorating your legacy is at almost 50k likes and 0 dislikes ❤❤ RIP Betty White
Pure iconic legend! My life will be forever blessed by her grace and talents....  xoxo Randolph
a very, very good list Mojo, thank you for putting real thought into this one, it touched me in my feels
So much wit, clever, pretty, but for me, I still can't get past Betty's dancing and chanting in the forest in The Proposal, so funny.  She was so self effacing.  All we have now is our memories, how special they are. R.I.P.
I hear more from the host than betty Terrible 😔
I love  her and miss her  already  but  now  she's  with  Alan
R.I.P. Betty...she's definitely the Queen of TV ...I loved her in anything she did. She will be missed....
If (2021) were an actual person, he/she would be like an evil comic-book villain. The type that insists on one final act of cruelty before going away. Still, Betty White pretty much had the last laugh. Her showbiz career spanned (8) decades ! I mean, who the hell EVER does that ?!?    💙😎❤️
God, she's legendary. Rest in peace, sweet soul. You will be greatly missed. I wouldn't be surprised if a statue was erected in her honor
The QUEEN of television has passed. (Long live the Queen). r.i.p. Betty, The World will miss you.
So sorry to here of her death
Ms. White's guest appearance on Joan Rivers' show was hilarious!  That should be in with this group.
It says something about you if people think you died too soon at 100… rest in piece, Mrs. White. Your legacy will be remembered forever, and I know you’re in a place that’s as golden as you are!
I love her she is the best actress ❤ so sad
Betty White was "THE One in a Million." She was funny, kind and will be greatly missed. Rest peacefully Betty.
Rest in powerful peace Betty Marion White Ludden 🙏 17 January 1922 ~ 31 December 2021⚘
Absolutely devastated at Betty's passing. And such a shame that she didn't make it to triple digits.  You will always be utterly adored, you wonderful lady ❤❤❤
Beautiful lady
Just the other day, I was channel surfing, and I noticed Betty White on the Johnny Carson show.(I remember viewing this particular episode live) it was when she and Johnny Carson were in a skit playing "Jane and Tarzan" I'm assuming that this particular episode was aired again a couple of days ago after all of these years because, Betty White had just died. Also on the show was, Victor Bono. I also remember watching Victor Bono live on the Johnny Carson show in a different episode on January 1st., 1975 he was reciting a New Year's poem. But what is rather odd is, That he died exactly 7 years later to the day on January 1st., 1982. What's also weird is, that a 1981, 5 months prior to Victor Bono passing, he and Betty White we're on the show together. Betty White perishes, on December 31st., 1921, and Victor Bono passes on January 1st., 1982  just hours apart.
I wish she had to make it to 100 but she got close. I can’t believe she had such a dirty mouth 😟
Betty was so beautiful and talented. I love her. I wish she would have lived to her 100th. birthday! Her dimples are adorable. They say her last word was Alan. That is amazing. It is a shame he didn’t live longer. They had such a wonderful love together. God bless her. She always had a smile. I agree with her about sleeping. There is plenty of time for sleeping later! ❤️🌹❤️
We all knew this time would come, but, we hoped it would be *later rather than sooner* . Rest in Peace, Ms. White.
She was incredible.
she was the best
Why do people say “Tough as balls? Balls aren’t tough. Now vaginas! Those things can really take a pounding!” Love me some Betty 🥰
The only thing missing is her great character from "Boston Legal".
A national treasure. I miss her already.
Thanks for all the laughs and memories r.i.p betty white.
Cute with Jay z .
If anyone deserved to make it to 100, it was Betty. It’s such a shame 😢 RIP Betty, thank you for the laughs.....
Such an inspiration
A treasure lost. I've watched her since the 60's. Its almost impossible to think she's no longer here.
Betty White .. must have been a great inspiration for Julia Louis .. they make me so similar ..
She will be missed by so many people. She was such a wonderful person. She was a voice for animals long before it was "the thing" to do. She had a huge heart. And as to that super bowl commercial, of course it was voted #1. It had Betty White in it. How could it not he #1?
Pretty crappy way to start the New Year, the death of Betty White. Her love of animals, humor and cheerful personality will be greatly missed in this world. Jan. 17th is her Birthday and my Mother’s who passed ❤️ Would have been cool for her to make to 100.
Oook. I Just cried for 24 minutes.
I loved her as. But much more as Grandma in The Proposal. I laughed so much.
Loved the time she appeared on Craig Ferguson's late night show in a craftwoman's outfit, and when she was asked if she worked in this profession, she answered:"I lost all my money in the thong of a well-hung stud named Raúl."
The superbowl commercial and the golden girl clips would be the only two I'd keep on this list.
Even though this was set to be released on her birthday. The new number 1 is the day Betty barged through heavens gates and God got the fuck off her throne.     1-4-22
I liked seeing Betty White in the show That 70s Show. I also think her show on Comedy Central is hilarious.
R.l.P Betty White. Loved her in everything she did. I last used to watch "Hot in Cleveland".
I think we all should learn a lesson from Mrs. White. We all should learn to laugh a little maybe even smile. I’m sure gonna miss that. RIP Betty White
SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED HER HILLARIOUS APEARENCES ON LATE NIGHT WITH CRAIG FERGUSON!! #CHEMISTRY AND ALSO THE WILLIAM SHATNER ROAST ON CC! THEY SHOULD ALSO GO AHEAD WITH HER 100 YR BIRTHDAY SPECIAL !!
I have loved her since I was a child. I would watch the Golden Girls with my grandma all the time. I did watch Mama's Family, but this was after Rue and Betty were on Golden Girls. I adored Golden Girls and was sad when the show ended. I also appreciated Betty even more when I learned how much she loved animals because I do too, she is the greatest ambassador for the animal kingdom. Betty, thank you for being a friend, the bestest friend the world has ever known, we love and miss you.
I bawled my eyes out when I heard of her death (I don't normally do that since I don't know any celebrity personally and their deaths don't affect me that much but as a member of the LGBT+ community... I just adored her so much). She truly was ahead of her time.
I missed the some of the memorable appearances on Graig Ferguson. The friendship they had was visible on every show she appeared.
Love her so much. Rest in  Paradise Betty. I'll  miss you.
I’m not saying that I am just making you aware of some channels that are. One of them was a big comic book and marble universe fan. He did not like your video on STAN Lee. He had said before the body was warm you had a Milio out on him and you didn’t give him enough respect? This Channel called that creepy reading. Makes upset remark about a lot of people. They have less people they believe she’ll just start being Youtubers and who are horrible people as if they have the right to judge? I ran a few people were obvious like Orison. Hey young man who I guess has a good singing voice and made it s semi pro and he was asking underage girls for nude pictures I mean anybody who asks that should be kicked off any platform and another one who was abusing animals the point of losing their lives little kittens and puppies and I am in the animal room I have several cats I found some strays and I got them all fixed and they’re help getting their shots and everything they needed. There were about 28 now I found them in the backyard in the ones of our condo. The people who run the building says to not feel down just ignore them and they’ll go somewhere else and of course if everyone had that attitude and they were all parish. And then I brought some up to my place using a kitty carrier and they all came right over to me when I put all the blanket and some treats I thought they would be scared but I came over and started crawling all over me so I made sure they went to very loving families and I couldn’t give them all away so I kept 2. Hi then found two more strays and took them and I have a big house big yard and a belt rings in the backyard that they can crawl or walk along you know that whole thing with places like an alliance get out of the rain I didn’t have the heart to give them away that’s how I ended up with four cats I have a wife now and my second child just came in to this world so  my cats are part of the family. A lot of people who don’t have fans can’t understand how one can be part of the family? And I do not fear rule them out on my firstborn child but they do grow on you and they show a lot of love they become just like like one of the family. I am  Bring it up because cats were mentioned in this video.
There are some people who say you’re a channel puts out information such as this about a person before the bodies are still warm. They specifically did not like the Stan Lee.
Her SNL hosting was top 3 at least
Thank you for this countdown!  I totally forgot about her snickers commercial!  That clip had me smiling. R.I.P!
She will be sadly missed by all of us!  Rest in peace love !
Well ya forgot about the roast of William shatner which is really great
Right balance of everything. We will miss you Betty White 💓.
idk what’s sadder, the fact that she died on new year’s or that she died 17 days before her birthday and she was excited too
I am surprised that so few talks about her start in televison. Hours and hours per day of live, unscripted tv (i think it was 6 days a week?) with her co-star. Then went on to be a producer. The first (?) female producer on tv... That is what laid her foundation to her lon career. She is not only to be admired for her comedy and sharp wit, she is groundbreaking.
RIP Betty White even though you left this world you inspired so many people you will always live on in peoples heart and soul thank you for the wonderful memories we will miss you dearly ❤️
THE BEST PERSON. Fly high and dance with your love dearest Betty. We will love and cherish and remember and miss you forever 🙏🏻❤ thank you for everything
First seek our father in heaven and his justice and everything will be added, Repent,repent, our you,won't enter gods kingdom,,
Rest In Peace Betty White. 🙏🏻
Lake Placid because when I heard her swear, I laughed so hard I fell off the couch.
Such a beautiful woman inside and out!
I think ive seen this on every video because I can't find the words. I've never been as affected by a celebrity death quite like this. She was just sunshine personified, thank you for the laughs Betty 💕
RIP the queen Betty White. ❤️❤️❤️
GOD bless your soul Betty  White🙏
I loved her in Lake Placid!
Rest In Peace Betty White. The love she had for everything, the positivity, the laughs, the work she did outside of Hollywood. It ALL goes beyond what any of us could imagine. What a brilliant, beautiful lady. The World's Grandma! ❤️❤️❤️
I can't help but look back and think this woman is a gift from god she will be missed dearly rip betty 😪
its a sad day for all of us #RIPBettyWhite 😢because 2 things i liked about her a golden girl episode when she told her neighber to drop dead and second my mother loves that snickers ad when im hangry we will miss you betty white your legend will on in the stars looking down at us
My intro to Betty was Golden Girls! Loved that show!
Betty, you will be missed! Love her from earth to moon and back!
I like to think that when death came to collect Betty she went with him as a willing friend, like she lived a long and storied life.
❤🐾🏳‍🌈📺🎭♾
I absolutely loved loved that quote from Betty White I'll Quit while I'm ahead that's so so funny from Betty White R.I.P golden girl
What a talent!! Loved her in the golden girls 🌿🕯️
:,)
They missed Lake Placid. "If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it" - Betty White RIP Sweet Golden Girl!
Grim Reaper: It's time to go. Betty White: Am I a good grandma? Grim Reaper: *sobs* No. You're the BEST Grandma....
❤️ thanks for sharing, RIP Ms. Betty White ❤️ 😢!
She was so pretty.
Rest in Peace Betty.  Thank you for all the laughs.   I'm surprised her appearance on the Shatner roast wasn't mentioned. She was hilarious
she was sweet . Love from Africa
Betty was also wonderfully brilliant on Boston Legal
My mom and grandparents loved Life With Elizabeth. My husband and I watch Golden Girls every night. Rest well Miss Betty you have earned it! My wonderful husband got me an autographed copy of her autobiography and no amount of money could get this book from me.
I can't stop crying. But I have PBA so it's normal  2 weeks ago she was planning her 🎂 I sent her some cheesecake photos of her then worried I may have offendedher. She wrote me back and said they still turned her on. She sent back pictures I'd be arrested for posting
Rest In Peace Betty White! There will never been anyone quite as amazing as you! To be so active all the way until the end, it’s really a blessing we’ve had you this long. It’s too soon at 99, would be at 100, and would still be too soon at 1000. You’ll forever be missed.
Betty White was everyone's on-screen grandmother.   It's so weird having had discussions/joking about how Betty White was competing for longevity against Queen Elizabeth, then to have the day come when she is no longer with us. You get so used to them being around, almost seems unfair.   But damn if she didn't live her life to the absolute fullest.  Thanks for the memories Betty 🌹R.I.P🌹
She was good in lake placid
An absolutely wonderful human being. RIP Betty White. You were loved and will be sorely missed
RIP to Betty White <3! What an amazing person and career!
You definitely forgot her epic appearance in Lake Placid which I'd say brought he back into the limelight after Golden Girls and Golden Palace. I would have included an honorable mention where she played on The Bold and the Beautiful as Stephanie Forrester's mom. She loved soaps and especially Guiding Light.
LOVE LOVE LOVE Betty White and her FUNNY !!!! RIP @BettyWhite <3
Personal fave is the scene from the proposal with her and Sandra Bullock in the woods chanting, or when she's yelling at Sandra Bullocks character to smack the strippers ass at her bachelorette party haha!
I remember watching the golden girls with my grandma, the golden girls was my grandma’s favorite show now it’s family feud but bettys passing is so sad. She’s everyone’s grandma, I cried when I heard she passed I also remember Betty white in The  Lorax movie her character was great
I've never seen a video on YouTube without a single dislike vote. But this one........
I'm bingeing on The Golden Girls now on Hulu. We were lucky to have her in our world...RIP, Betty. We'll miss you.
Betty did it right
There will never be another lady as funny, unpredictable, or as gracious as Betty White. We miss you already, and always. ❤️🌈
Losing Betty White is a hard one. She was America's favorite dirty grandma. My mom grew up with her on the Mary Tyler Moore show. I occasionally watched her on the Golden Girls with my mom and made it a point to watch her episode of SNL. She is an icon who shattered glass ceilings. She will be missed by 4 generations of fandom.
You got me through a lot of hard times. Growing up as a gay teenager in rural Indiana. I'd benge watch golden girls before bed. I always looked forward to it. Thank you.
Oh betty 💐
My favorite Betty White moment is when I met her on the set of Love and Dancing. I was doing my first background gig. She asked me what I wanted to do with myself? I said Well I feel like I am too old to be an actress but that has been a lifelong dream. (I was 39) she said: "Oh Honey, as long as you are still breathing you are never too old! You follow your dream, you will never regret it."  She spoke life into me. I became Sag eligible 2 years later and am not a member of SAG AFTRA  I am infinitely grateful to Queen Better. She is the Patron Saint of all that is good. Truly it was an honor to meet her, to be able to shake her hand and be in her presence.
How about the time she was in good health and got the booster shot and died days later?
I am laughing through the tears
the booster shot killed her and everybody In the Industry Is trying to cover It up
Amazing Betty White RIP
You guys had this video out a bit too soon, just saying
my favorite has always been the story arc she did on "the practice", where she played a murderer who killed a man with a frying pan and then talked her way into working for the law firm that represented her.
Thank you Betty White for always being in my life🌻👍🏻💕🙏🏻 Thank you for saving the lives of countless innocent animals. The secret your mother talked about, you now know💕 Forever in my heart💕
Betty White you are the best love you✌♥️
America’s favorite Grandma gained her wings! Always loved her, always will! RIH Betty White! 🤍
Such an amazing actress and person for howuch she cared about animals and for how she loved to male people laugh.
In 2021,  I decided to rewatch Golden Girls. Out of pure curiosity I searched up Betty Whites age and when I saw she was 99 I literally freaked out. The whole year I kept getting this thought just running back and forth in brain « It’s going to be so sad when she passes ». Months later, The day before New Years she passes. I literally could not believe it and it broke my heart. I love u Betty thank u for making me laugh and loving the world :) U r legendary!
Thank you for being all our friends Betty White
I was just having a look at an article regarding her final moments before she passed.  According to her assistant, who was with her at the time, her last word was "Allen".  This would be referring to her late husband Allen Ludden, who she was married to from 1963 until his passing in 1981.  In a number of interviews since then, she mentioned how much she still loved him.  It's great that the two of them are together again. ❤  RIP, Betty and Allen.  😓😓
Only 20?
LEGEND. SHE WENT OUT RIGHT BE4 NEW YEARS. NOW EVERY NEW YEAR YOU WILL THINK OF BETTY WHITE.
I think her part on Lake Placid is my favorite Betty....
She's so smart and has accomplished many things, that's so ironic that she's casted as a not so smart lady in Golden Girl.
Rest In Peace, your highness. There’s a heck of a concert going on upstairs right now.
I'm curious as to why her stepchildren have not released any statements in light of her passing.
RIP Betty. You will be missed. We love you.
Betty flipped off 2022 and said "I'm out of here!" Honestly she left in Betty White style, on New Years and before her birthday.
You forgot she was also on a day time soap!!! Bold and beautiful as Stephanie s mom!!. She played a ball buster mother!!!
How could you have not have had her Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson appearances. Like when she stated she was running as President and her slogan was "White Power".. It was probably the funniest Late Show thing I've ever seen
When Betty White wants a cup of coffee you get her a fucking cup of coffee.
Betty, Thank You for being the American Treasure that we will all truly miss. Well done lady!
When I saw that you guys posted this, I feared that she didn’t make to 100.  She was so close too, closer than Prince Phillip even though Philip died the year he was born in. R.I.P.: Betty. I see that she was sweet and wasn’t afraid to be sassy at the same time. What she said about being gay is so true, it’s their one business.
I think the super bowl Snickers commercial should have been higher but all in all your list is top notch as was Betty White rest in peace Golden girl
It really feels like we all lost our grandma 😢 What a legend she is.
Please remember she was a big advocate for all animals. If you love her. Make it a point too help an animal in her honor!!
You know someone lead an amazing life if they die at 99 and your still saying they died to young
RIP Betty. You will be remembered and missed by many people. For many years. 🤗
Snickers commercial.
Rest in Peace Betty White
Betty White was such a naturally lovable person that 95% of her guest spots on TV shows ended up with her getting a recurring role.
Rip
She took that experiment booster shot & died from it.
The most humble person! We will miss you so much! RIP fine lady.
Her in the proposal
Didn't Arthur Duncan do The Laurence Welk show??
All of them! You were amazing on all levels. I am so sure Allen fretted you. I know about the love of your life. R I P Betty
So where did we find the Betty White critiques without the beeps? We're all adults here we'd like to hear it do you have a link? Sincerely, everyone
Betty White was the same age as my great grams, she was around during my grams era and my mothers era and mine my god she is the Longest woman who had lived on TV cuz I love tv  I always said Betty White would outlive me lol n I also said the world will cry once she leaves. I was right  Thanks golden girl
Rip Betty White. 🙏 Such a legend.
Rip Betty why right when this year was about to end she could have been 100 years old why just why
She’s a true gangster! She will be greatly missed and always loved!
Can’t help but smile any time she’s on screen.
Thank you for being my friend Rest in Peace Betty White 🙏 ❤
God i miss her 😭😭😭😭
Life well done ms Betty white you showed so much class I loved you
Truly an angelic,  humble ambassador to live up to. One of a kind, heaven is better now that shes there
Thanks so much for the video! RIP Betty, you'll be missed by everybody! <3
Who doesn't everbody love Betty White?   Betty was a Unitarian, believing that we should, "affirm unconditional, universal love as a foundation and grounding for our actions in the world."  Unitarians believe in God, but reject the idea of eternal punishment.  My mother, who was likewise Unitarian, reminds me of Betty White (or is it the other way around?).  Both women believed that people who do evil things become their own punishment.          Yet, does that really work?  For example, I am not sure why, but I am still absolutely devastated over the death of young girl, Polly Klaas, some 30 years ago - yet, I have only seen her picture.  She was kidnapped out her own bedroom, brutally mistreated, then murdered.  The killer, Richard Allen Davis, laughed at her trial, at the suffering of her dear, poor parents - heart-breaking is not the word!  Yet, should such great evil go unpunished?  Is that true justice?          It is written that, one day soon, Jesus Christ will judge the world in righteousness.  Just as my anger has been greatly kindled by Davis, so God's anger is good and right; all injustice will be punished.  For those who disagree, do you believe the Richard Allen Davis should not be punished?  For example, should he have life in a paradise resort?  Such thinking is almost as vile as his dispicable act!             Yet, God will not just punish those who destroy families, but it is written that all liars will have their place in the lake of fire.  Heaven is totally just; we are not.  Jesus Christ died on a cross as punishment for the sins of the world - even for sweet, charming ladies like Betty!  I hope that she put her trust in Christ, that she was made new - born again - by the blood Christ!  I hope that everyone will!          Jesus Christ is the light of the world.
I always told my fam  The world will cry when Betty White leaves, :(  Thanks Life with Elizabeth 🙏❤️
Those were the days! When you didn't need to be hot if you had a dynamite 🧨 personalitythe now it's all about looking hot.
She was truly a queen, loved animals, was for lgbtqia community, and was so funny, she will be truly missed!  Fly high Betty! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She was the moment, EVREY moment she may have lived a good long life but it still feels like shes gone too soon
No kinder or greater person ever was In Hollywood
My father's boss in Los Angeles was Betty White's father. She was just beginning her television career in "My Little Margie", and she used to send us kids presents every Christmas. She showed this kindness and generosity throughout her long life. Every year she would contribute a large amount to different local humane societies throughout the United States, particularly those that were struggling. We have lost not only a fine actress but a very decent and loving person.
There's not much that everyone loves and cam agree on in the world, But betty white is one of them.
Only famous person, I actually cried..Betty white was awesome
Thanks for shareing . god bles
"Live your life in such a way that if you die at 99 it's still too soon."  RIP Betty.
How I miss her appearances! Her laughter and the how I laughed more with her humor. RIP BeTTY.
Murder mystery weekend
RIP Betty White❤️ we gon miss ya, auntie.
What a treasure and will be truly missed. If I am blessed to be her age, I hope to have her wicked sense of humor! RIP!
R.I.P betty white💔💔💔
You forgot when The Golden Girls portrayed Clueless for the MTV Movie Awards!
Glad Mojo went with such a way to honor Betty White!  My maternal grandmother's favorite show Golden Girls. She herself passed away already in 2013 at age 93, but she knew well who Betty White was. Used to watch reruns of that show (aside from Lassie and Murder She Wrote) as a kid in the 90s with my grandma. She's now happily reunited with her Golden Girls cast, Mary Tyler Moore, and Ed Asner up there...  Miss you, grandma and you too Betty. Respect.
It's so hard to believe that Betty White's gone it's really hit me hard and I'm sure it has hit all her fans hard but look at all the things that she's done and the memories she has left behind for all her fans and family she could sing she could do comedy there's so many things that she could do and she encouraged us to do better in our lives too can you imagine how God's going to greet Ms Betty White how he's going to welcome her in he called for another angel to heaven and she got her wings she probably up there saying I got my wings leaving me now I don't swear so I can't say them words that she'd say and hearing her in St Olaf that was funny when she would tell them stories Last of The Golden girls and I wish they never took that show off but at least we got reruns from of her fans who can get those reruns on their TV I'm not one sure there's a lot of us that can't get them but I remember them rest in peace dear Betty you learned your wings
God Love her heart!
R.I.P TO A SWEET WOMAN WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU BETTY
Remember everyone on the internet, Betty White may have died when she was fast asleep but, I bet she was comedic joy when she woke up in heaven, in the afterlife all confused, but I bet they laughed silly and happily to see the girls and who she left behind.  Betty White thank you for making us laugh, but most importantly, being you. See you in the next life may you rest in- wait, she has rested peacefully, Then betty white, will never forget you ^^
Betty White died on her 100th Birthday
I'm planning on making a donation to a local animal shelter in Betty's name on the 17th. Who's with me?
Sleep sweetly, Betty👏🖤🙌🙏
Hot in Cleveland  was a wonderful series.
Sorry, I never cared for democratic Betty whyite. She was a traitor to our country by calling Obama a very decent man.
The Golden Girls are together again
I met her once...... she was the sweetest
BETTY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YouTube trying to make money of Betty White's death that's appalling
Betty White was a national treasure. I LOVE her performance in the Proposal, hillarious. But everything she touched was GOLD and she may have been even better unscripted than scripted. 💜
Such a talented witty sweet person.may she r.i.p.but remember her passion of loving animals.
I loved her in "Mama's Family" too
We need a national slap a bitch day in honor of our friend. It should be on her birthday.
I’m jealous she kissed Bradley Copper
gotta love her
Betty is actually already 100 year old since there was 24 leap years  during her life time.
She was and always will be AMAZING. If you have never seen the movie LAKE PLACID. Must see to see Betty in it!
Betty White is a true LEGEND!
I found out from a friend exactly 44 minutes after her death was announced & before I could even say it my friend said it’s NOT a hoax this time. The very second she told me it was true, I burst into tears. 😭 I always said the day Betty passes away, the whole world will cry collectively! 😢😭  *R.I.P. Betty & thank you for being our friend!!!!!!!!* ❤️
I know I’m not the only one to say this, but I feel like I’ve lost my own Mom!!! RIP BETTY 🥺
R.I.P. Betty! Heaven has gained another saint. Only a few days shy of her 1000th birthday....I say just give it to her- she has definitely earned it! ❤❤❤❤❤
Betty was wrong; “they” force us to make their private business all of our business.
Betty White, a true legend, for now and always!
She made it to 100 cuz we are giving her all the leap days she would’ve otherwise missed. May peace be with her as she reunites with her Golden Girls 🥰
I still can't come to terms that she has passed... it feels like it's not real
I love her part in lake placid. I wish this was mentioned
RIP Betty White!! You will be missed!!
i had not laughed so hard for a very long while - previous to BETTY WHITE on SNL - - she killed!
Love you so much Betty!
R.I.P Betty White, thank you for gracing us with your beauty and talent. You are truly loved and will be missed by us all!
In my heart, the world seems a little less bright🌞. God Bless Betty!!!!  🙏💔🕯😒🔔🕯 Betty will be missed🔔
She was also a regular on "Donny and Marie Osmond's Variety Show" in the late 70's. And I absolutely loved her Smart-ass character in "Lake Placid". She was truly America's sweetheart and she will definitely be missed.
R.I.P Betty White 🙏😭
Thank you for being a friend, Betty
Betty on SNL doing the muffin skit is the best!
What an icon.
betty is one of the secret fake grandmas i had for comfort in my head that was snarky and would bake me cookies while we talked trash about my classmates
What about her stint in Boston legal?
RIP Betty White! But this list lacks her community rap with Troy and Abed
She was a goddess.
I miss you Betty we all do RIP 🙏😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She was a real treasure to our lives and all of Hollywood. I really thought she was gonna make it to 100 with one month left! 🥺😥Rest in Peace Betty White 🙏👼
When I was young I love her weekly show.... " Life with Elizabeth"  I called it "I love Elizabeth"d  on an old B/W  20" tv.
My  favorite  moments  of  Betty  is  in  Hot  Cleveland
If you didn't love Betty White, there was something wrong with you! RIP Betty White!  I think my favorite was "The Golden Girls" Betty White,  was hilarious!
Lake Placid....She was Awesome!!!!!!!!
- A good woman has passed... Blessings on her good spirit! <3
RIP
"C*cks*ckers! You're all C*cks*ckers, I just didn't want to admit it" ... Best. Line. Ever.
A real classy/classic dame.
I would have thought it impossible to make Betty White boring. Learn something new ever day.
I grew up watching golden girls. Rip momma
The Emmy's Lifetime Achievement award should be named for Betty White...
RIP Betty, i saw for the first time in the sitcom hot in Cleveland where she played Elka and she was amazing as always.
RIP to a true queen
A true legend who will be missed....
Golden girl
A legend
If this is Betty's best moments, it would go on and on and on...but this is good, very good
She told my favorite dirty joke:  Paraphrased "I don't understand why everyone says to grow a set of balls when you need to toughen up. Those things are delicate. What they should grow is a pussy. Those things can take one hellava pounding."  Picture that coming out of Betty's mouth. This had me rolling. I will never forget that video.
Love love love her. She will be missed! 😍😭
My favorite lady in Hollywood! We all will miss you Betty R.I.P!
We were very blessed to have her.  Rest in peace Betty White.
There's only three actors/entertainers that made me cry, when they passed away. They were, Robin Williams, Freddie Mercury and Betty White. Legends.
Betty white on community
God has a sense of humor alright, takes her on the last day of a troubled year. I was never a crazy fan, but I enjoyed the Golden Girls and her loving care of animals. I thought you'd outlive us all Betty. Rest in Peace wherever you a4e.
Rip Betty White what a queen 👑💞💐
I loved her. May she rest in starlight. <3
R.I.P. Betty White! The moments that I remember her in the most was her SNL skit where she sings a rather hardcore version of "Thank You for being a friend", & her participation in William Shatner's roast!
Rest in peace to a icon I can't believe she's gone just 3 weeks of her 100th hope your looking down at us all ❤️ there's certainly a brighter star in the sky 😇
Rip betty
this woman is the embodiment of the american spirit god bless you gal
I looked forward to Betty turning 100 on the same day as my birthday 🥺 I'm going to miss those adorable dimples along with her amazing and endless talent.
I still think one of her best roles was in the movie Lake Placid when she tells off the deputy sheriff says if I was a man at this point I tell you to suck my dick to me that was the funniest moment of the movie
R I P Betty White. Everything that was Betty White a True Legend Truly Missed an Angel gone home
Not down with the hearing her say the f word! She’s funnier than that!
Lake Placid
My fave was when she was a guest on Alan Ludden's show.  She looked at him and said "Will you take me home?", suggestively.  He laughed and then seriously said  "YES".  I believe it was their first meeting.
This lady is a absolute LEGEND Betty White will be missed dearly.
Talented....OPENMINDED
Love her so much!!!
"When Betty White wants a cup of coffee, you get her a fkn cup of coffee!"
I loved her in Boston Legal among many many other shows!! She is Definitely a Legend who will be missed by millions!! R.i.p. you Beautiful Golden Girl.🙏💙
She was a wonderful person I have loved her for ever! She’s a lovely person for eternity in my book!
Need to do a 2nd list and include her time on the bold and the beautiful, that was great drama acting from her
Blaaaarfengarrrrrrr
The queen we did not deserve but appreciated.
RIP Betty. St Olaf is a small college in a little, 2 college, MN town. A writer of the Golden Girls went to Carlton College and thought St Olaf was full of hicks.  God bless Betty White for coming to talk to us at Olaf, and for that Carl who connected her sweet soul to us.
I can't believe she's gone.
I loved her reaction to getting walked to the stage by Chris Evans at the People’s Choice Awards.
Her comedic timing did not stop when she got older, it's like being able to make a hit song 50 years later. She will be missed
Saddened by her passing...God wanted you to spend your 100th Birthday in Heaven...Rest in Paradise Betty
One of my best best phrases is hers . She once said that you must get under someone to get over someone that moment as a woman I loved her spunk..
My favorite moments of betty white was that she was a great actress and her funny moments
Didn’t realize she was an exceptional singer.  She’s one hysterical woman with many talents.
Losing this wonderful person was touching on another level. She will live forever. ❤️
Her and Jason Momoa on Conan 💖
I am sure going to miss u Betty White. But hubby called and u had to follow. What better way to celebrate 100 than to be with your beloved hubby. I am sure going to miss that celebration on 17th was sooo looking forward to it. But I know u in a better place. RIP. I can just imagine the celebrations up there with all the rest if the Golden cast🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️
Dear Betty, we adore you!
Love Betty! She's the greatest entertainer of our lifetime.  I have been honored to share her birthday for 54 years.  Rest in peace with your furry friends Betty.
Masterful as Sue Ann Nivens, stellar in everything since! LOVED this woman.
I feel so bad because she died 2 weeks before her birthday
I'm almost 60 and Betty White has been unknowingly in the fabric of my life. That smile and her love of people and animals. So surprised she didn't have any children. RIP Ms.White make God laugh.
How could anyone forget her role in Lake Placid!?!? She totally killed it in that movie. THAT should have definitely been included in this clip.
I miss her already
Betty was at her best on the Mary Tyler Moore show
I loved her!
Rest easy Betty! You will be missed.
When she showed up as the Anthropology teacher in Community and kicked Winger’s ass.
❤❤🧡💛💚💜Betty!!!!
Hands down one of your best videos
she pulled 1 last queen move and when she ended, she took 2021 down with her <3 lol rip betty loved her so much :)
ty for dropping this early. we needed it. :)
Rest in peace Betty White the very last Golden Girl.
There's not many people who have been alive for the past 80 years who *don't* know who Betty White was. Her fan base is astronomical, just like her personality. There will never be another Betty White in our lifetimes, and there probably never will be again. Period. We will never forget the legacy she left behind. RIP, Betty White, we love you ❤
Why couldn’t god take her on the 18th?
You didn't mention Lilly from grandma's boy! Out of all of her appearances that's my favorite that and of course my favorite show is golden girls!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful woman... Rest in peace beautiful soul... sense of humor has persevered her youth all these years.. God bless her family and  friends / fans
She was like America's grandmother. I teared up throughout watching this
Crimes against humanity.
Loved Betty White
When you pass away at 99, just before 100 and people miss you and think it was too soon, then you know you're a national treasure.  Betty have the biggest piece of cheesecake you can, enjoy your time with Alan and you are surely missed by all.  RIP Betty
Liked her best on Golden girls
Nothing better than you explaining what Betty White is saying or doing instead of letting the video and Betty showing it. What a stupid way of making a video about someone so fantastic.
There will never be another like her and we are all poorer now that shes gone.
Okay,  mojo, this was a awfully poor display!  What can one expect from u-tube. Seems Mojo should take advice from Betty White.  Quit while your ahead.
Betty white 8s a National treasure. RIP
RIP DEAR BETTY WHITE🙏🏻
Betty white will always be my golden girl.
"Acknowledging her privilege".......
I cant believe she died before her 100th birthday. I think i grew up knowing of her, the older version. I didnt know her beginning work but i hate that she is dead.
nothing from 'Boston Legal" she was hillarious in that
Betty white, ... "Fk you 2022, I'm out!"
Delightful video!
Betty White is a Goddess!!!
Rest in Heaven Betty!! We miss you already!! You were my grandma's fav!! Now your with her and lots and lots of wonderful people!! 🙏🙏💞
Superbowl commercial was legendary...RIP Betty.
Rest in Power Betty 💖💞💕
If none of you have ever watched Mamas Family, you absolutely should. You will be peeing your pants laughing.
When Betty White appeared on "The Carol Burnett Show", she made the best variety show on tv just that much better. RIP Sweetie, and thank you.
Betty White was a unique blend of wit, class, humble, humor and grace
What a classy lady! A true gem that will be greatly missed forever! Thank you Betty for your comedy that brought a bright and beautiful light to many dark days and nights!
Dusty muffin
She was the the host of Her Own Show Called Betty White Off Thier Rockers,
Betty white was a grandma watching over her children aka the other actors
She was so sharp even at the very end. That's something to strive for. RIP Betty. You are a gem.
What a Classy, Humble Woman! Women in show biz have big shoes to fill!! 1954 The Betty White Show she let a black man, a dancer and singer appear on her show! The southern states threatened to boycott the show! Mrs. White said “No he will continue to come on the show ANNDDDD GAVE HIM MORE AIRTIME!! That was 1954!! Thank You Mrs. Betty White!! ❤️😘🥰😍🙏🏾🙏🏾😢😢
The 20th moment wasn’t Deadpool , is for the proposal
Betty White was a national treasure!  She will have a special place in our hearts forever ❤️
I had a great privilege to be in the audience for "the golden girls" I was 18,just graduated high school and my mom and I went to California to visit my aunt and my aunt took us to see "the golden girls" the episode when the other woman was flirting with her and Betty was oblivious.great episode,great lady 💓
Hosting SNL. #lol
We love you so much Betty.  Rest in peace.  You've been our angel for almost 80 years.  Now you're a true angel.  We will never ever forget you.
I just love Betty White! She will be missed... Just like Robin Williams 😔
As a biracial Black woman, the story about her lifting up the career of Arthur Duncan is one of my favorite stories about Betty White. As an actress myself, I'm also in awe of her versatile, incredibly humorous massive talent who seemed to have been a truly genuine soul. The world will be a lesser place without her in it but so glad we were blessed with her amazing artistry for generations. RIP Betty White, thank you.
Dear Betty, thank you so much for the years of humor, kindness,  talent and entertainment.  We won't forget you nor your legacy.  What an incredible run you had. RIP, friend...
The lady had character. Humanity lost one of our best.
A legend, who will forever be adored.  RIP beautiful soul.
I loved hearing Betty's outright bold comedy craze.... Nobody will ever match her. R.I.P
I was so looking forward to her 100th birthday. RIP great woman ❤️❤️
There’s a YouTube playlist of Password Plus (70s? 80s?) that is my favorite Betty White. It was hosted by the love of her life, Allen Ludden. He proposed a few times before she said yes!! He hosts & she’s a “guest contestant”. You can see how much they love each other. Bonus: If you can find the episode with Betty White & Lucille Ball, just sit & watch it on a bad day!!!
She was more than an actress more of a golden girl Actress dancer singer author comedian An icon to the LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 to everyone she will be miss so much
Rarely am I shocked. My wife told me of Ms. White's passing. Without thinking, I blurted out, "Are you fuc**** serious??" I've never responded to anyone's death like that. So many tributes to her, like this one, makes the loss feel even more intense. What have we lost with her? There are not enough answers that can be given.
Now there is someone who really understood the importance of supporting their friends! Way to go, Betty!
Betty was and still is pure sunshine.  You will be missed.
About her husband Allen. of 20 years she said," When you have had the Best, who needs the Rest!!!
We didn't deserve this woman. And what a woman she was...
Mickey Mouse’s dog is gay?  When she was told in The Golden Girls that Plato was homosexual.
She has such a unique voice.  I always recognize her voice even when she is playing a voice in a cartoon and sure enough   I found out she was the voice behind that character.  She had a good life RIP Betty White.
Because she is Barbara's half sister. Drinking the virgin blood commercial was very revealing
I would have included her sketches on Craig Ferguson's show - those were great! But good list and great clips - she was terrific.
RIP Betty White, you've brought so much laughter to us around the world. Thank you very much your legacy will live on.
Special lady.
🥺🤧😭😰😰 We’ll miss you Betty White with a passion, it will never be the same without you, thanks for your utmost care!!!  🥺😭😰
The Great Herring War. Never forget! 🙏
I have named all my cars Betty because they always last longer than you would expect and always reliable. And this psst election I wrote in Betty White because I think this world had been better with Betty White as President. This loss really got me :( and I will forever be a Betty fan.
I laughed so hard watching bloopers from hot in cleveland.  She was funny as hell.
THE BEST!💝
She was 99. Death is symbolic.
I love you Betty! 🥰🥰 May you rest in peace
America's queen 🥺👑
She was beautiful till the day she died. She had so much grace R.I.P. Betty
Rest In Power Betty White - We are grateful and you are missed.
Betty white is the best & will always be the best!
I'M ready to kick some Ass   from monday night raw my betty white moment
Her role in Community as the Anthropology Professor definitely deserved an Honorable Mention if not one of the top moments.
I know it's been said before, but Betty made to nearly 100 and the world still felt it wasn't enough.
What a precious human! Just a beautiful and kind soul. A marvelous person that will be sincerely missed. RIP Betty
RIP
ICON OF THE CENTURY
I'm glad she's one of my role models.
You made it to 100, Betty -- we are giving you the last 18 days in gratitude for all those years!
She is & was the best lady of Radio/TV/Movie always & forever even after she'll be better because there's only 1 Betty White we care about
A true legend. We'll miss you, Betty.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤
I fkn love her.  In a strange way it feels like my last living grandma died when she passed.  She was one of these incredibly rare people that was just loved by everybody.
She was a Breath of Needed Air in This Vacuumed World!!!
She had such a blessed, wonderful life. I hope all of us can have that, even if it's not in show buisness.
Betty White made it to a 100 technically because her mother was pregnant with her.
Betty White is the human everyone should aspire to be, her love and caring for all is inspirational, RIP Betty! We will miss you!
I liked when donny osmond sang happy birthday and danced with her and goldon girls
She was supposed to be immortal! :(
you show a retrospective, and talk over it with your stupid commentary instead of letting her talk.  get a GRIP!!
Ohhh RIP Angel Betty White 💕💖💕💖💕❤❤❤❤❤❤💕💖💕💖💕
Rest In Peace, Betty White.
2021 had some BIG balls to take Betty White.  Or was it a deal?  2021 said to 2022 "I'll take here, you're going to be a bad enough year!"😲
Many movies and moments but my favorite is her role in Lake Placid. Apparently she had a mouth like a sailor and that’s one thing even more that I loved about her.
What longevity!, I was born in 1958, and she was on TV years before I was born. The Betty White show was a good show that would play today, because the writing was so good.
Better not see one dang dislike! Love Betty! Rip she’ll be missed to many things she’s been in to list all the awesome roles she’s played.
Betty White was one cool lady.it's sad she didn't make it to 100.I'm going to miss her along with just about everybody else,very charismatic,everybody loved her.John Guinto
I recently rematches Boston Legal because Betty was hilarious in that too! She gave Shatner and Spader a run for their money! RIP Betty, and thanks for being so awesome!
She's the best! She's given us wonderful memories! Betty White, Forever Loved.
You can't mention Betty White without mentioning her role in 1999's "Lake Placid".  She stole the entire show.
Oddly my first thought was god ( or whatever you chose to call it) came to her on new years eve and said she could save billions of people if she chooses to die today. And she probably said "do i get to choose the people?" She didn't.  But still she sacrificed herself before her birthday to save us all.  And that is how covid ends.   I don't know for sure. But i chose to believe that.   Good night you amazing woman, and rock even harder in the next life.
Loved it years ago when Allen Ludden was asked if Betty was like her character Sue Ann.  He said, "Well, yes, except Betty doesn't COOK!"   RIP Betty, thanks for a lifetime of laughs.
Thank god for Betty, I still watch lake placid and bust a gut when she cusses out the cops 😂🤣😂
“HAPPY New Year’s Everyone 🎉🎉I Hope It’s The Best One Yet Stay Safe”❤️
Love her so much and RIP
Thanks for the memories Betty, you were truly an amazing woman. We will miss you.
When I grow old I want to be like Betty White!  I LOVED her most as Rose in GG. And forever for her love of animals.  RIP, Betty! You were one of a kind.
Y'all missed her role in "Lake Placid" - She's adorable in that role, and was an amazing woman.
booster two days before she died. R.I.P
Betty White R.I.P.she was the greatest actress n beautiful person🌹
Betty White, the epiphany of love.
Her Lake Placid role was one of the best.
i get the whole national treasure thing...yes she was crazy funny and good in here characters but the whole "aint it wacky when an old lady curses and tells dirty jokes" is old.
I remember that one time in St. Olaf..
Be like Betty. Make that your resolution.
When she was on Johnny Carson show every skit they did together was awesome, she is an amazing woman funny as hell, hey from Alaska
Rest easy Miss Betty - you were a treat to watch from when I was a child & all my 53 years of life.
Once told my therapist that my big life goal was to be a sassy, interesting old lady and every time I see Betty I'm inspired anew ❤
Thanks for giving her her flowers before she passed!! She will be missed!!st Olaf’s finest ❤️❤️
Rip
My girl my love Im a miss you babe. Many times I smiled just seeing your face. Wow the  angels are singing and laughing.
She was truly one awesome human being, one awesome star, one awesome lady 💐
We should all be thankful for technology, otherwise we wouldn't have so many permanent memories of her. And by permanent, I mean that, as we age, we begin to forget things. It's why I personally take photos constantly at home. So that I can always remember things.
Some people just have that internal shine. Beautiful and hilarious...we will miss you Betty White the Legend.  🙏🏽💫
She is the best. Long live Betty White!!!  She is still alive in our hearts and she made us laugh.  Omg Betty rapping ..hilarious
RIP Betty  Well done Ms Mojo. Well done.
RIP, Ms. Betty.  You've been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.  It's like losing a family member, except none of my family are as funny as you.  True, one-of-a-kind class.  You will be sooo missed.
So nice for Betty White....She is so missed!!!!
I'm gonna miss that Lady!  She was an incredible comedian and actor, but mostly an awesome human!  The world is grey without her shining light.  RIP Ms. Betty.
I loved Betty White in "Lake Placid'' and "Hard Rain''
Love you forever, Betty. RIP ❤
She was the true Queen of television
Can’t believe her role on Community didn’t make the cut it was super awesome and unique to her
She was a national treasure!
I've already seen comments from pos who said they were glad she died since she supported the BLM movement.  The deplorables just keep finding a lower bar.
#11. Especially when Gammy and Margaret were spirit dancing. I laugh just thinking of it.
Which virgin are you? I hope the wise one. God bless! Matthew 25 King James Version 1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. 9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. 11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. Proverbs 6:23 King James Version 23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: Psalm 119:105 King James Version 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. Matthew 5:14-16 King James Version 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. 15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Matthew 6:22-23 King James Version 22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! 1 Peter 2:9-10 King James Version 9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; 10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 2 Corinthians 4:6 King James Version 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
My favorite will always be her telling the cops  " I killed my husband. He's buried in the back yard. You can dig him up if ya want to" absolutely sold it! I laughed like a mad man.
For everyone who doesn’t know who this awesome, remarkable, funny, talented woman was….you’re young  enough to know that you can Google her … please keep it to yourself. This woman was a National treasure. ❤️
💖😢😂🥰
I knew her as the grandmother of Ryan Reynold's character in The Proposal movie.  RIP Betty White. ♥️
I prefer American royalty to ours. Goodnight sweet lady.
My mother went to a filming of The Golden girls and said Betty came on before the show and entertained the audience, my Mom said she was the nicest and when I told her she passed away she said I can't see anybody saying anything bad about Betty, I agree, this year sucked and it ended on a low point.
What a loss 😔 What a life 👍
Animals lost their # 1 friend .
She brought laughter to so many people. RIP. Your are making the angels laugh now ♥
When Betty White got to heaven she said  " Couldn't you have waited 2 weeks " !!!!   Her birthday is Jan17th .  She missed the 100 club by that much.
Pĺacid Lake. Betty was awesome
Wonderful actress, will be missed
❤️
MsMojo, you collectively highlighted well on Betty White's amazing achievement.... I cried... Thank you.  Now, we need more women like her who is utterly talented, gifted, loving of all kinds of this universe!
Rip to the great betty white. She was a true character on and off screen. Such a sweet funny and kind soul as well. She was America's grandma. She will be dearly missed.
The world will never be the same again...:(
I got to see Betty White in person (well through a window) on the Today show in 2011
Thank you for this tribute.
Never heard of her! But I'm English NOT American.
I would like to see every game show she was on, especially password with her husband Allen LUDDEN. Love her
God bless you Betty White ...You will be missed ...R.I.P. sweetheart ....She was a true Class act and a Legend ...
What a lovely lady and good sport.  I grew up with Sue Ann and Rose.  Betty was a part of my life weekly.
#Thankyouforbeingafriend Betty White!!!! This was the utterly and awful painful 10!!!! This broke my soul!!! The Golden Girls are together forever
National treasure nails it. And somehow we all feel like she’s our Betty White. The love we feel isn’t like fan adulation but rather how one feels about a friend. RIP Betty. You will be missed.
This is on the day she passed 😬
She’s a National Treasure who lived 99 years as a human to witnessed Sports,the Era of Creation with Radios,Cars,and Telephones,The Great Depression,WW2,Jim Crow Laws,Appliances like Refrigerators,Stoves and Ovens,The Civil  Rights Movement. She invited an African-American Tap Dancer and Entertainer named Arthur Duncan on her show called the Betty White show in 1954 and NBC cancelled that show. She married to Password’s Game Show Host Allen Ludden in 1963 until his death in 1981
Truly a class act
She was so damn close to turning 100
Ah yes!! Leave it to Mojo to capitalize quickly on Betty’s death!
Such a class act and iconic legend.  We are all better because of your wonderful gift.  Save a seat in ?????? for me Betty. Your legacy will live on forever.
As far as I'm concerned, Betty made it to 100.
Every moment with Betty White was epic.♥️
What a tremendous loss to the world, there will never be another Betty White. The world already feels a bit darker without her in it…RIP Betty, you will be truly forever missed 😔❤️
A Wise Lady Indeed, Betty White, Clearly Knew She was Greatly Appreciated and Loved and Was Wise in Appreciating and Loving Us … Her Fans. She was Wise and Humble Enough to say, that She was The One Who was So Incredibly Blessed by US, Her True Fans,When it was Always the Fans Blessed by her Real Talent and Love for her Fans and her Love for Animals too, ALL Blessed as well … by Betty White just being around any time. She was Our Great Blessing… And will Forever Truly Be Missed.
Gonna cherish every memory I have of Betty over my nearly 50 years. What a lovely person!
I choose to believe we've been misled all these years, and that Betty White was, in fact, Betty Grey, and thus she will soon return to us as, indeed, Betty the White.
RIP. I loved your golden girls show. They’re my favorite to watch before the bedtime. You’re missed.
God, she made it look so effortless.
RIP Betty White,  Humankind's Grandma. 🌍💔
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide} AAAHHH MAN.....''HEAVEN''...JUST  GOT  BETTER..!!!...LOVE  YA  BETTY..!!  ONE  OF  A  KIND..!!
R.I.P. Betty White
She made me enjoy Boston Legal more... RIP Betty White
What a woman, what a life. Rest In Peace Betty White. She spent almost century spinning around on this planet and she seemed to live every day of her life to the fullest til the last.
There will never be anyone like The great actress, Betty White, ever again.  God broke the mold when He created her and he ability to act, sing, preform, and be her own unique self.
We will truly miss you betty!
I will miss her.
Life's so short  not everyone goes to heaven  JESUS said we all must be born again to enter the kingdom of heaven  there is only one way to GOD through JESUS
I have always loved to watch her
We lost a truly GREAT PERSON, COMEDIAN AND ACTRESS.  RIP Betty.  You ARE missed.
Everytime I watch Ms. Betty White on any of the videos esp with her demise, I always get emotional as anyone else but this video is the best mojo that I've seen. I learned so much about Ms. Betty. She will always be in our hearts.
My favorite Betty White moment (among many others) is when she had her own show 'The Betty White Show' and had African Americans preformers on and once a really amazing talent n tap dancer and the network demanded she kick that person off or else they'd cancel her show. You know what she did, instead of kicking them off she gave them MORE air time, yes she got cancelled but she knew it wasn't right what they were trying to get her to do. She was a huge supporter of BLM before it was a  huge like it is today, she was and amazing person and the world has truly lost an angel. She will be greatly missed, I'm just glad she has such an amazing life that she built on her own and had the blessing of dying in her sleep (I'm sure we all wish to go out the same way). R.I.P Betty White 🤍 edit: I'm now aware they cover this in the video but I wrote it before watching the whole thing lol
dude, i still can’t believe she’s gone. wtf.
Her role in You Again was very good as well❤️
She was adorable, fun, smart as a whip... no one can take her place.
When I first learned that Betty White passed, I was in shock. I was very much looking forward to her celebrating the 100th birthday. A true legend and an icon, she is with Allen Ludden now.
Grandma's boy is one of my favorite comedy's, and she was hilarious in it!
Betty White SMILE was unique😁
What a wonderful celebrity! Thanks Betty!
I'm so exhausted from losing so many hero's and legends. Why aren't some of these creeps and dirtbags not getting some of that luck?  =***(
I love her the movie she fed whole cows to huge alligators
Rip rose/betty we alli will miss you
I love her where she fed whole cows to huge alligators
The world is little less bright with her passing.
Betty White will definitely be missed.. Love Golden Girls.
I hope she knows and remembers how impactful she was. RIP Betty White ❤️
My daughter and I were just talking about Niss Betty the other day.......About how she was one true lady who had a whole lot of class only ever equaled or rivaled by her whole lot of sass!!!! She really was a true and great lady, and she will be greatly missed!!! Go in peace sweet lady, we thank you for your time, your love, your laugh and all of that sass!!! You'll forever more be in hearts, until we see you again, you will be remembered and loved, never forgotten, always embraced in our love for you, your smile and grace!!!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Gratitude for having enjoyed her.
Dang, I was rooting for her to make to 100. 99 is still awesome.  Rest In Paradise Miss Betty 💔😪🙏🏾
If anyone in this world deserved to live forever, it was her!
What a wonderful person and actress she was she will be greatly missed. There will never ever be another woman like Betty White❤❤❤
Whenever Betty White was asked if she was afraid of dying, the legendary comic actress pointed to the teachings of her mother and the comfort she had in finding out "the secret."  Well there is no secret! His name is JESUS and not once was he glorified in her words nor the words of her family. Prayers to all especially those who live life apart from Christ Jesus. He and only HE is the WAY, the TRUTH and LIFE. Amen
Finally
Not the First Lady she’s the queen!
When she thought she had HIV in that one Golden girls episode
Rest In Peace, Betty!
I remember when she was on a talk show after Chris Rock who was saying he kicked the pipe, so when she came out, she told the host I kicked the pipe too.
I'm glad she recieved many of those awards while alive. She deserved ever accolade given her. She'll be super missed!!
I just adore how much she loved animals. I miss her
Betty’s attitude toward life has always inspired me. We aren’t really the same brand of woman but her strength and humor really always found a common thread throughout all women. Here’s to you Betty! Thank you for making all women laugh in unison even if we’re all at different places in life. Salutè and Rest In Peace.
R.I.P. Betty White On January 17th to celebrating her 100th birthday, but she died at aged 99 on December 31st. (1922–2021)
She was a filthy mouth.
Just an amazing & truly wonderful person. Beyond talented. I doubt we will see another like her ever.
What if the announcement that Betty White (Snow White) died  17 days before her 100th birthday is code for the Queen is dead? (17 = Q). Sure, we know that the real Queen died a while ago ............. Now the stage is set for many announcements to come forward ...... -Dr. Kia Pruitt.
Wow,I didn’t know she had such a good voice ,she could do anything.
I loved her as a guest roaster at Bill Shattner's event!
I’m still shocked that she’s gone,I know many people are ,the woman wax an icon,she will be so missed so much RIP dear sweet Betty ❤️❤️❤️
R.I.P Betty,
Honestly, I don't think I give a f***.
So creepy old Betty White is gone. The younger folks loved her coming around to their filthy ways. She was always looking good and being bad. Not a decent person nor anyone we should look up to. An icon of the gay community for reasons I'll never understand. May God have mercy on her soul.
Betty White, George Burns and Bob Hope now there is a right for being the most humble, giving and respected members of the entertainment world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9 Decades of INCREDIBLE!!!!!  You will never be forgotten...
I'm sad that beautiful Ms Betty White didn't make her 100 year milestone. But I am happy that we had her for as long as we did. _NO ONE_ will every be able to take her place. Thank you, Betty, for all the laughs and love you gave 💔 💞💕💗 💖
Betty White celebrates her 100th in heaven with her beloved husband
The first thing my wife said was when I told her was "Good... my competition is gone" Rest in peace Betty.  The only women to have a place in my heart other then my wife
I feel like a family member died. 😞 Just loved her!
Dusty muffin on SNL
Sue. Nevins on Mary Tyler Moore should be number one
A true American icon & America’s grandma 😢 I miss her, she was so wholesome & hilarious ❤️
I liked her in Lake Placid.
My favorite scene in the proposal..R.I.P. Betty...you will be missed.
So did my Great Greatmother Dec 31 1973....She was 97. 😊⏳❤
When Donnie Osmand was singing to her
loved her in Boston Legal
One of a kind RIP Betty White
The world will miss you Betty White. Unfortunately, another famous "Betty" who's loved world wide could be leaving as well.
May The GREAT and LEGENDARY Betty White Rest With GOD in eternal peace. She was one of the longest working actors of All Time in Hollywood from the time of Old Hollywood to Modern Hollywood. She has been in show business for 90 years, and has had an AMAZING career. I send my prayers and condolences to her family and friends. Her LEGACY in film and entertainment will continue to live on. She will ALWAYS be loved and GREATLY missed. 🙏🏿❤🕊
What a great tribute!!
Rip when I heard I thought it was a hoax so I had to do a lot of work and I wish it was but also I know not everybody can live for ever
A very sweet soul, I love that she loved animals as well. A bright light has gone out in the world….
the narrator says a lot of unnecessary annoying things.. no more Mojo for me!!
The last of the humble , nice, kind, giving actors.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fauck 2021🖕🏼
She was also great on Boston Legal!
Snickers commercial
Can't come up with just one.  She was constantly great
I like Betty White's dog commercials  and the super bowl commercial
Betty White got her 3rd dose of poison on December 28th, 2021 and died 3 days later. Go figure... 🤦‍♂️💉☠️
We ALL need to have the HUMILITY, CONPASSION, LOVE for ALL & grace that BETTY WHITE consistently  displayed ( oh & a lil Sass ~ I feel confident,  she'd  want that added) Thank you beautiful Lady.
Will be missed funny lady. May God take good care of you. RIP.
There's  no way to adequately  describe  that MAGNIFICENT  LADY......you made us: laugh, cry, love, care, consistently with great humility.  There will NEVER be one to compare to BETTY WHITE.....you'll  be missed is an understatement. She will live on in our hearts I wish more of OUR world  would have learned  from her. Imagine  her eyes that opened to the GLORY of HEAVEN, & be reunited for eternity  with her Earthly  love ALLEN. Take your well earned rest......until we get to meet you in GLORY. Rest beautiful  Angel.
It's crazy how it can hurt so bad losing someone I never met.
The golden girls
What a wonderful lady. She is a true legend
Bea Arthur sad it best in her one woman describing Betty the best " Betty White the nicest person you'd ever meet.... Mouth like a sailor."
Hearing of Betty's passing 2 days ago on national news was as surprising and shocking as hearing a relative passed away! You were awesome, Betty!
6:30 that right there is all I need to know. You are an inspiration , an Icon and deservedly so.
It's too bad that she resorted to swearing in order to get her gigs. I liked her as Sue Ann Niven and that's about it.
Awww precious Betty White you were a true talent and a woman that stood for everything humble. God bless you beautiful soul 🙏 May you rest in peace and fly high in that sky as the Angel you are now and we're here on earth. You will forever be missed and loved 💖💖
I'm a bit disappointed that her role in Lake Placid wasn't mentioned. She was a riot in that movie.
I love you Betty White! She was so close to 100! 27 days away
Betty was such a wonderful lady and actress no one will ever come close. R.I.P. Betty you will be missed dearly
I'm gonna miss her!
We love and miss you Betty forever in our hearts.
RIP  Betty White😪❤❤❤
She would be sadly missed I love her so much golden girls is one of my favourite tv shows ❤️
The most golden of the golden girls. R.I.P beautiful lady and thank you for everything.
Blarfangarrrr
tI didn't know that Betty White was no longer alive. My mother really liked watching her on Golden Girls. It is coincidental that my mother's life ended recently, and would have turned 100 on January 21st.What date was Betty White's passing?
Just sad to see Betty shut the door on the house of Golden Girls. RIP ladies. You’re in my dreams. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
May she Rest In in peace. She was a legend
Rest In Peace Betty White. We will miss you so much!
My favorite time with Betty white was when I gotvtobsee or hear her. She was a genius acting or just talking.god keep her she will make u laugh.
I liked watching her when I was a child on Password with her beloved husband, Allen Ludden.
Betty White coming into my life will always be my best Betty White moment. I never knew until adulthood I grew up with the golden girls in my home. My mother two auties and my grandmother along with myself spent most days to gether taking turns caring for grandmother Smiley.  I loved them all dearly.
She is the best! I'm about to watch Golden Girls, my fav💛
😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺
Great compilation. The 70th Prime Time Emmy Awards in 2018 was apparently her last public appearance.
JUST HEARD,,, Betty is Alister Crowley's daughter, and sister to Laura BUSH,, now isn't that strange. bye Betty, Jesus is waiting.
Rip 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Imagine being so beloved that even millennials and Gen Z are mourning her passing!!! That's something to be proud of
God bless America, I remember Betty White ever since Christ was a Corporal.
Betty White herself, is my favorite Betty White moment.
An animal lover, she had no problem with holding a full grown boa constrictor.
Rest in peace Golden Girl❤️🙏🕊️ Oh, and, Thank You For Being A Friend
R.I.P❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She will be terribly missed.
I feel like this shouldn’t have been monetized. Seems like you’re profiting off her death. I know this video was made ahead of time in honor of her birthday, so it’s not that big a deal, but it still seems right to just take the hit financially.
to the young people....this is what a true STAR is, not someone who the only talent is,....nothing... (ka kashians)
65 episodes!!! What a failure lolo
My fellow Betty White fans, in case you haven't seen this yet:  Wouldn’t it be GREAT if on January 17, 2022 all Animal Shelters are flooded with donations in Ms. Betty White's name. That would be a WONDERFUL gesture for what would have been her 100th Birthday. America, please, let's do this for her. We all know her love for animals and taking care of them was her life mission. Just a thought. LET’S DO THIS!!!
My favorite Betty moment was watching her host Saturday Night Live! She was fabulous
May miss White rest in peace. She's acting in heaven now.
a remarkable woman. RIP and Thank You Ms Betty White
My favorite Betty White Moments: Golden Girls, The Proposal, Snickers Ad, The Lorax
Rest in peace.
Big Panda Bear Hugs from a 68 yr old Grammy from Kirby, Texas, USA 🐼
rip betty (:
RIP Betty. She was too kind for this world. Never once have I read anyone say anything bad about her. I'm honestly going to miss her.
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST…now HEAVEN IS NOT THE SAME…
Probably caused her death!  By the liberal!
Not sure how you missed her last sit com ( Boston Legal,,,, ) but thats just me .
💖💖💖💖💖💖
She was extremely special. I will be eternally grateful for k owing her through her roles. Love her!
I loved when she was on SNL talking about her muffins on the talk show skit.
I joked today I will have to work to her age to retire.  Your number one was my favorite.  Her telling stories was so great on the golden girls.  Such a great cast.  I love animals and glad she had such a love of them also and an advacote for them. A true living legend.
RIP Betty White.  I always L O V E D  your wardrobe.  So much class and style.  My only wish is that we could have seen you turn 100.  But God had other plans for you and us!
Rest In Paradise BETTY.
RIP Betty. She will always be one of my favorite comedy actresses. She will be so missed at so many levels.
RIP to everyones spicy grandma ❤
RIP Pretty Lady !!😟
She's missed.  💔💔💔
What happened to Off Their Rockers I loved that show
The day after she passed away, I was bingeing "Ugly Betty" on Amazon Prime and lo and behold, there was Betty White in an episode! She was hilarious, as usual, and it really made my day. ☺💜
RIP Betty. I know you are happy being united with the love of your life.
You was the best woman...I love you!!❤🙏🍃⚘
I'm not crying, your crying.. Shut up !!   RIP Betty White, we didn't deserve you.
RIP Betty White! Best line: Lake Placid. “If I had a d_ck; this is where I’d tell you to suck it!” Gonna miss you😭
I can't stand her
Rest in Peace Betty White. We were privileged to have you so long.
Oh my   I didn’t know it was possible to love her even more  very heartbroken!!!
Rest in peace.  What a wonderful person and an amazing actress. ❤🥺
I wish I could have met her. She was such an incredible person, and a great actress! My favorite Betty White role was Grandma Annie in The Proposal.
Beetty white  is the beautiful when she walks I watch themselves
There is more to Betty White aka” Snow White “ than this acting facade.  Why do you think she was sooo involved in DARK Satanic Hollywood!???  Hmmmm?  Well, adrenochrome junkie for one. Do your own research.  She did NOT die of natural causes
She is the only thing this country can agree on. We all loved her.
She was, the memory of her is and will forever remain so, a delightful, loving and wonderful person and talent, who’d gives you such a good feeling, whatever the mood is your going through. She’ll be missed. Betty White, forever.
R.I.P Betty White. We will Truly miss you.
Class.
"When Betty White tells you to get her a cup of coffee, you get her a fucking cup of coffee"...spoken like a true DIVA and rightly so. Kids these days have no idea how iconic this beautiful funny lady is/was & you better believe you get her a cup😉. EVERY LBGT nightclub was bumping the "I'm Still Hot" Betty White version from 2011-2016, & I'm sure still do. And you are so passionately right Betty, ones sexuality is such a personal business, & no one else's business but your own. People think racism is bad now, just look how it was then. But Betty didn't care for she sees people as people, like we ALL should. One of the true celebrities that devoted much of her time, talents, & money in helping others & spreading love, laughter, fiestyness, & positivity to all. Love this woman, have since the late 70's. Fun Fact about Ms White is that a lot of her lines on Golden Girls, Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, various comedy sketches, & movies are improvised and not scripted, & watching the reactions often from co-stars is priceless. Thank you for keeping me entertained & making me laugh for decades. We will miss you & the angels are in for an eternity of smiles
We will miss you Betty
A huge loss to the whole world but she came,she saw,she conquered all even our hearts.A standing ovation to you Betty White RIP
Now I know why Richard from The Amazing World of GumBall dressed up as Betty White’s iconic beloved character from The Golden Girls
I smiled from the start of this video to the end.  That lady always made me smile.  RIP, Miss White.
I think that the roll of "Old Mrs. Rilley" from  the "Complete Savages" was absoluty hillarious and should be mentioned.
Forget Golden Girls (not really). I want to see Life with Elizabeth! 🤣
How can you forget to mention her in Lake Placid. She is the only reason to watch that movie. Plus, you gotta love her lines in that movie and how she delivered them.
this list is long overdo
and that is the way "selling your soul" looks like....
The last 1/4 of her life she wasted her talent playing frisky, older grandma with a bad mouth.  Too bad.
Betty me vaz hacer falta, eras natural tu humor y como lo disfrutamos tanto. Nunca pude entender como era que lograbas mantenerte  sin perder la compostura cuando todos sabíamos que no era nada de lo que estaba en libreto pero lograba mejorarlo , claro que tus compañeras muchas veces la perdían y se tenían que reír en cámara. Espero aunque no soy creyente, que llegues a un lugar digno de un ser que logro felicidad en tantas vidas. Feliz viaje amiga , Freddie Toledo,  69 años de Camuy  , Puerto Rico
Such a Legend!
She Was my Favorite Capricorn our birthday is a day apart I’ve always love this woman she will truly be missed 😢❤️
She's a timeless goddess and while she may be gone, she will always be loved.
Take care of my Nan if ya see her Betty, she also departed this December 😭
I don't have a favourite - it's all so  enormously joyous 😊. What a wonderful lady, even the language! Such talent and what dimples! Thank you Betty
Betty did lend her voice in a small cameo Toy Story 4. Anyone recognize her voice while watching the movie?
dam.. I liked her a lot more before watching this video.. lol
I really thought she’d make it to 100. She lived a great life of humor and heart
This video hit a million so fast. That goes to show how much legacy Betty White has behind her.
And Arthur Duncan 5:58 is still around, teaching and I think he still dances!
RIP Betty White you were one of a kind that could make the world laugh and if heaven has no sense of humour when you arrive, just take the elevator back to earth we will always have you back, you were the golden girl.
R.I.P. to one of the greatest comedians that ever lived.
What an amazing lady.
I am so glad to have gotten to love her humor for my lifetime.
I have always adored her and I was so upset to see that she died on my echo show. I felt like something like that should have been told to me by a family member. I viewed her in part as an American treasure that we needed to protect and kinda felt like she was a family member ( even though I never met the woman). She also reminded me of the sweet old lady who lives down the street of where I grew up that I still visit whenever I can.  I also have to say I was so disappointed that she died so close to her 100th birthday. I heard they had planned a big birthday party for her and was so happy to hear that especially since she has been known not to do much for her birthdays. I wish she would have lived to see that and just how much everyone loved her.  She was a true legend and star that we all loved and will live on forever in her work. I will make sure that one day when I have Grandchildren that they will know the name Betty White and she will live in my heart for the rest of my life. ❤
Betty White American treasure..she will be sorely missed.
This brought tears to my eyes. What a woman!
You will always be an honorary Minnesotan!
Omgoodness! I just loved Betty White. My favorite movie she did is The Lost Valentine, with Betty And Jennifer love Hewitt, it wasn’t mentioned but I absolutely love that movie. Along with the proposal with Sandra Bullock, I absolutely loved them together. Betty and Queen Latifah is also a favorite. I can go on and on. We lost a beautiful lady. REST IN PEACE BETTY WHITE🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
Betty was an iconic part of American history,  an inspiration, and a genuinely wonderful person!  More people should take after her! I am grateful that I can see her anytime I want.  We are going to miss her sorely!
There’s no denying we’ll really gonna miss her. Everything she was in was pure gold. She was so hilarious and super talented and just amazing in absolutely everything We’ve seen her in, no exceptions. ❤️
Rest in peace sweet lady...
I loved Betty White on "The Mary Tyler Show."    I also loved watching her on "Password" with Allen Ludden, her late husband.
Anytime BW was in, "Boston Legal," is on the top of my list.
I love Betty White. I still watch Golden Girls.
Rip Betty white what a legend
She was a great example of what a true entertainer should be #thanks4beingafriend
As much as she is missed, I think Betty's passing was the way she would have wanted it. She was very humble - can you imagine the gala that was being planned for her 100th birthday? Nope, she went out peacefully, and it wouldn't surprise me if she "willed" it.
Back in the 80s I worked as  a server in Chester. The Public House. I always was the clown 🤡 there but also bosses called me a big pain in the ass so Betty White came in with 3 others and of course I got her . I had many celebrities but she was as sweet Rose. The other 3 were cold but she had the Cornish game hens with black berry sauce. Amazing she could eat that, than I talked her into a brownie ala mode. Gave me a note for our evening and a signature. I said I'll never take it off my Refrigerator.  So proud I had my one little moment in time with the Queen of our lives..
My favorite Golden Girl! We’ll miss you gutsy lady!
God bless you Betty White. Thanks for the memories. RIP 😔💞
How did this list skip over her bit in the comedy central roast of William Shatner?  It was classic Betty White.
I wonder if that heart shaped necklace she wore all the time was from Alan♥
"My muffin hasn't had a cherry since 1939"
A legend!
My goodness Betty White was great!!RIP
She said get 8 hours of beauty sleep, 9 if youre ugly.😂😂😂😂
Rip to betty white
R.I.P., Thank you for being a friend.
Im so upset she is gone i loved her soo much
She was a grand old lady! The world is not the same.
I'm not crying. 🥺
Betty came in & went out with a bang! RIP Betty, & thanks for all the laughs! ❤  P.S. Can anyone tell me why Betty appeared to have a black eye at 20:59?
my heart is broken! everybody loved Betty she was the best and just lived to make us all laugh! and God did she! such a funny, talented, irreverent, and completely lovely person! I will always miss her! I really wish she had made it to 100! she deserved to make it. but I guess God decided differently. god bless you Betty we love you and will never forget you! there will never be another like you!
The best, thanks for the laughs Betty
I remember her on SNL, deep tongue kissing Bradley Cooper in her 90's and thinking to myself... You know what? I totally would too, if only for her. She was a treasure. The sort that can never be truly lost, after a life well lived. She will be missed, but she will always be with us. She never faded away. She died knowing she was loved. We should all be so fortunate. Thank you for being a friend, Miss White. Rest in peace.
God man.. She is awesome... Loved her as Rose... She is a MEGGA ICON.... We need more like her in the world...
Where are the bringing down the house moments 🤔 rip Betty!!!!
I figured she would live forever. I will miss Betty to be sure. What an interesting lady. RIP Betty.
Rip, Miss White. My mom died on December 26th and I was heartbroken. When Betty White died, I was in complete shock. She looked so healthy for her age. 2021 was truly an awful year. May she rest in  peace.
Betty was one of the most wonderful, warm and funny people I ever met. In real life, she was exactly like her stage presence. Her hugs and my Mom's hugs tied for the best.
I didn't know about Betty White until after 2010, but one look at her and listening to her i knew she was a great person and instantly fell in love.
Lake Placid.
Love this woman, my favorite Betty White moment is from Lake Placid when she tells the Sheriff "you know if I had a dick this is the part where I'd tell you to suck it!" totally epic line!
I heard Betty White passed on December 31, 2021.
The world is a better place courtesy of Betty.
The Golden Girls was my favorite memory of Betty White. Rose was my favorite next to Sofia. RIP to one amazing lady.
Golden girls in heaven now.
RIP: Betty White 🤍🐻‍❄️ You always be miss.
soooooo much love
Excellent video and thank you for the memories Betty ❤
Bettie you are so loved
For my entire life, there's always been Betty White. Watching TV a lot as a kid, her appearances on commercials, guest shots on prime time, and all of the game shows, made me feel like I had a friend in the business. It was as if she was naturally funny and oblivious to how endearing it was. It's hard now to realize she's not out there somewhere, working on the next time she'll pop up and reassure us that everything is gonna be ok, Betty's here.
Is there any way to make a petition to make Betty White a saint
My favorite Betty White is a cameo in my
i love her with all my heart i still can't stop crying
Beautiful inside and out
:(
Golden Girls when she acts stupid and also mentioned saint olive alot.
Betty was a treasure.
Her performance at the Roast
Didn’t realize she was an exceptional singer.  She’s one hysterical woman with many talents.
She was a true goddess,she was earths angel. R.I.H.P Ms.Betty White
THis is one of those very few times that the loss of a celebrity is actually a genuine loss.
RIP BETTIE
We miss you, Betty! Heaven has gained a hilarious angel
RIP betty you were loved by a lot and still are
i was so shocked when she died. rip betty white. thank you for the memories 😭😭😭
Lake Placid--I can't believe that wasn't evem mentioned! Her feeding a cow to the lake monster was incredible!
I'm going to miss her on TV so many other things she's just so great bless you for being yourself Betty White and having the humor that you had and your love for animals rest in peace
RIP BETTY WHITE😪🙏❤✌😘
God bless, Betty. Looking forward to your next performance with the big guy Himself!
Infectiously kind, funny, and adorable--we miss her already and will continue indefinitely. The world needs more Betty Whites and fewer BS POS do-nothings. Who else fills her place in our society? I can't come up with a single name... anyone, anyone?
That Carson moment was priceless. I watched it the night it aired when I was a little boy!
Betty White and Paul Rudd have one thing in common. They both stopped aging at one point and are forever beautiful.
R.I.P angel, Rose and especially Elka helped through some really dark days :(
Betty White, Bradley Cooper and Scarlett Johansson were at the MTV movie awards to honor Sandra Bullock with a generation award and after Sandra said she wanted to have a career like Betty White's, Betty went up to the mic and made fun of Sandra's dress saying, "Don't ever wear that dress backwards again".
Morgan Freeman’s face is priceless when he saw her
RIP Betty White!
"Player music begins in the background* Betty, come back.
Dear Betty....the world isn't the same without your light.
One of the greatest ... Betty White. She will live on in her many roles and never be forgotten. ❤️🙏
Favorite Betty White moment: Her life! #RIPBetty
Life with Elizabeth.
RIP Betty White. She truly was a living legend, as this list reminds us. I have to point out, however, that this list is woefully incomplete without including Ms. White's hilarious turn on Lake Placid. No conversation of her enduring influence is complete without at least a mention of the role that likely introduced her to a new generation. She will be missed!
I am sad she has left this world but she left having a great life with all the love she had from fans and people in showbiz. Rest in peace my sweet golden girl you will always be a legend
good night u beautiful lady
Her love for animals
*_Thank you for being a friend._*
She was a grandmother to the world,her arms wide open to love and not judge. She was a icon of beauty class sass and grace lost to a bygone era. The world is a darker place with her light to illuminate it.
The last of the good old broads! RIP, Ms. White!💋
Betty White was loved by all! What an amazing beautiful woman. So funny and marvelous as an actress! She will be missed by all who knew her throughout her career!
Having her curse is so cringe and just lazy writing. It shows how scriptwriting/dialogue writing has fallen so far and became so cheap and lazy. Betty didn't need to that. She has gotten far without it.
Thank you Betty for every time you put a smile on my face!!! RIP sweetheart!!!!
I loved her ancestors dance in the proposal movie
Such a classy woman and so beautiful all her life. A huge loss. RIP Betty
RIP Betty White! Thank you for being our friend! You were and still are a national treasure.
Universal pain. There will never be another like Betty White. Thank you for shining your light so bright. We miss you so much already.
I'm noticing a trend. Betty White made a career out of extending her guest appearances into regular spots. But my favorite Betty White moment was in the movie Hard Rain with Christian Slater and Morgan Freeman as the cranky old lady who laid out traps for looters and stared down people with her shotgun. Also her role in Lake Placid where it turns out she's feeding the monster alligator.
Betty White was an American treasure from start to finish. Her kindness, her humor, her generosity the list could go on. She lived a long life and will be missed but always remembered thanks to videos like this. Thank you MsMojo!
"Why do people say "grow some balls"? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding"  - Betty White
Love your channel please don’t profit from her Death
Long live Betty white,  the world is less fun without you...
We will miss your funny antics. Rest now my fine actor friend. Until we meet again!
This broad won so many hearts that I feel a mass sadness hangs in the air. 99 and gone too soon. I love Betty.💖
A truly beautiful person inside and out RIP Betty White
Please donate to one of her charities. Do no not use her death to your benefit
I just cannot seem to shake the sadness of this.. This woman made me HAPPY.. and was a brilliant, passionate, joyful, humble and KIND.. I feel like I knew her but I never met her.. and she did not know me.... BUT.. SHE was a part of our LIVES... WHAT A LIFE! WHAT A LEGACY! WHAT JOY!! WHAT LAUGHTER!! Rest well dear BETTY..!
A true Legend. RIP
That woman is America's Grandmother forever.. Rest easy Betty..
National treasure lost. I'm just happy I was privileged enough to live through part of her life and witness what she gave us. Golden Girls was a big part of my childhood, my grandma and I would watch together growing up. 😢 rest in peace you foul mouthed badass angel 😇
Match Game, circa 1974:  Gene Rayburn: "Little Orphan Annie cried and cried because her dog Sandy ate her blank." Brett Somers: "I'm the first one finished!" Betty White: "You were finished a long time ago, sweetheart."
Betty white is amazing 🤩
Wow, 2021 we lost the last four members of the Mary Tyler Moore show :(  Cloris Leachman, Gavin McLeod, Ed Asner, and now Betty White :(
I loved Betty in "Lake Placid".
#3 and #1 should be reversed.  Rose was a delight, but Sue Ann Nivens....was delicious and a testament to her talent.  She parlayed a planned one-off guest appearance into a cast addition earning her two Emmys. Examples - "Sue Ann's Sister" or "Sue Ann Falls in Love."  I spent Christmas Eve as a patient in the ICU thinking how depressing it was.  A week later I stood corrected.  She was a sincere, sweet and caring person who deserved more time but I so hope her Allen escorted her away from this world.
Good God, I really thought she passed two yrs. ago!
rip betty white
There's a moment where Jim Carrey in the Feature length Grinch film yells "Betty white!" While traveling back up to Mt. Crumpit. Ironically he was born the same day as her.
RIP BETTY WHITE YOU WILL BE MiSSED ❤️🕊⚰️😭
RIP MS Betty White.. You gave me countless hours of laughter.. Soar with the Angels Ms Betty😇
Animal rights activist.  Love you Betty.
Little to much narrating
What a badass she was
I have a neighbor that just turned 102 in December that we call Betty White. Her first name is Betty so our handicapped brother named her “Betty White” from watching the Golden Girls at home.
I love you Betty!!!!!!! Rest in paradise queen🎈
Entertained us for so many years, kind woman and huge animal advocate and animal lover! She was too good for this world! RIP Betty White
Oh gosh, I miss her already!
Golden Girls had to be #1
RIP! The one where she played Rose on Golden Girls … sigh. She was America’s. And now - all 4 of the GGs passed. :(
There will never be another Betty White. Heaven has gotten back their Gem. I’m just glad we got to see it for 99 years. RIP Betty White
Stop talking over the clips
In the dictionary, next to ICON, they should have her picture...🥰💜
One of the best to ever do it pure talent
She was always smiling. I will miss that about her.
It’s a shame she was never elected President of the United States of America!!!
Ahh Betty, I wanted you to make it to your 100th but I understand you needed to go.  RIP Betty White I'll always love you!! ❤️💛❤️
Lake Placid was a really good one.
The world without Betty all ready feels a little less! Rest In Peace Betty White.
One of my heroines. Such a great classy, beautiful, happy, funny sweet lady.I am 70 and when I grow up I want to be like her.
Lake placid
What an awesome tribute
Wonderful women love her in The lost valentine and sweet the only woman who can wear jogging clothes with glitter
Be better without the annoying narrator
She will definitely been missed. R.I.P Betty White
Rest in peace betty-obachan :( i love you, and you will be sorely missed...
RIP Betty white
I know that's right, betty... Who cares about others skin color & sexual orientation .  It's not our business .  Everyone should be respected .  I love me some betty...  We love you betty...  R.I.P. beautiful ❤
My Betty...it was an honor 💕💕💋 Rest in peace my dear😔
She has been there all my life. I will miss her greatly.
I understand you are a YouTube person, but you shouldn’t have recommended another video after a video of an Icon.
Betty White is an amazing woman she is someone who our little girls should look up to.
I’m going to miss her. She was truly a gem.
I still can't believe she's gone. None of us will be able to get over her sudden passing, rest in peace our sweet Golden Girl.
I already miss her 8( RIP Betty White
Love you Betty, fly high.
Great Great Great Job! Betty White would be so proud. This truly does show her honor and respect. Thank you!
This makes me love her even more.
I also think her dramatic turn on the soap "Bold and the Beautiful" should have been on the list or an honorable mention because it was a different side of Betty. #RIPBettyWhite and thank you
Rest in peace Betty you are missed. God needed a jester and no one else would do for the king of kings!
Oh ha ha door Betty White and every thing that she played and she acted a.m. she spoke in. I wish that she hit me up to see her hundredth birthday Betty White’s birthday would have been the day after mine and it would been a pleasure and honor to see Betty White smell one more time on her hundredth birthday. Betty White you are forever be missed and forever be in the nation the world heart you are one of the most beautiful and loving caring actress producer role-playing every day there is in a woman. May you rest peacefully in gods heavenly. May you play nicely and wonderful with every animal in heaven I know they’re waiting for you rest in peace Betty White
I still can't believe she's gone! She will always be missed!
The world is going to miss one of the greatest actresses and comedians we have ever had rest in peace Betty thank you for your life
Lol I was like "ooh I wonder what #1 is gonna be." ... oh, duh.
We love and we will miss you Betty White. Way to go out leaving every fan wanting more!
Betty White lived a full life and was loved by the world. Can't really ask for more than that. She will be missed.
💗 loved her she was wonderful!
Actress supreme
My favorite moment is when she finally paid for the crimes against children and humanity!  She is Alister Crowley’s daughter and Barbara Bushes sister!  By the way Barbara Bush is a MAN!  We have been lied to our whole life!  These people are sick!  So was Betty!
She's enjoying that everlasting "cup of coffee" now!!! 👏 📺 ✌☕ ❤
Love and miss this sweet dear lady, RIP God has one of his best work to keep him laughing. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😘
"Now do you prefer to be called Margaret or Satan's Mistress?"   So long Gammy, you lived a great life!
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
We were lucky to have her.. The Ryan Reynolds feud were the best.. I have known her since Mary Tyler Moore. she just killed her entire life. She is on the right side of history, and she proved that over and over again. There are many shows with other artist that can't be shown now because of the racism both outright and implied.. Rest Easy In Peace. You deserve it..
Betty "White" was NOT who people think she Was.  Betty White was Barbara Bush's sister.  The Bush's created the OSS/CIA and 322 Yale Skull and Bones. Barbara Bush and Betty White are the "daughters" of Aleister Crowley. Barbare handled all the politicians for the CIA. Betty handled Hollywood for the CIA. Betty was (SnowWhite) The QUEEN of Hollywood and the CIA's Adrenochrome harvesting/child trafficking network.  "SnowWhite. CIA Dream"-17 (Betty White Crowley) Barbara was a Man (transgender) Betty was a Woman. Brother/Sister.
BLESS HER
I MISSED HER ALREADY :(( SHE'S MY GRANDMA I'VE NEVER HAD
Gonna miss her….
Let's not be sad she's gone...let's celebrate the legacy she's left the world with, she was a special woman and we're all better because of her.
RIP
2021 had to give us one last kick in the nuts before it ended
I have tears in my eyes.  RIP Betty White.
RIP BETTY WHITE. You will aways be A GOLDEN GIRL You will never be forgotten...ps thank GOD she saw my mistake
Rest In Peace Betty. You have more than earned it.
RIP 🙏🏾🕊🙏🏾
No Community honorable mention of her rapping or choking out Joel McHale  "I...respect... you." "That's why you fail" 😈
I can’t think of any thing she did to  wrong in her life. She made me laugh, laugh and laugh. Betty you were a beautiful outside as well as inside. I loved the fact that she was an advocate for all animals. She will be truly missed.
13:51 This was the first thing I ever saw Betty White on. The instant she ragged on Facebook being "such a waste of time," I fell in love (not in a romantic sense, mind you, but yeah). XD
Glad to see this review...I loved Arthur Duncan... he was such a charming personality and good dancer!!
20:39 - how hard could it have been to find a clip of the audience that didn’t highlight sandra bullock’s douchebag, racist ex-husband?
The only decent Human  in Hollywood. R.I.P
I have always loved Betty and her smile would light up the room.what a wonderful lady that will always be remembered.thanks
Such a sweetheart ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for being a friend, travelled down the road and back again, your heart was true, you were a pal and a confidant. And if the heavens threw a party and invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift to the our world was you! Thank you Betty white for being a friend!  I usually don't get too upset over celebrity passing but Betty was the one person my entire family could agree upon to watch and yes usually it was golden girls.
99 years just wasn't enough.. 😔 Will forever miss you, but never forget you!! ❤️🌹
Of course all the st. Olaf story from the Golden Girls. Rip Betty. Thank you for the laughs.
LEGEND!! RIP!
I knew Betty... not so sure she’d like your narrative. Too know-it-all presumptive.
She had a long life.  I've recently heard some no so good things about her.  I hope it isn't true.
RIP Betty White. I thought she would live forever!!  Love her.  Thank you for this wonderful tribute!!
She was a real hoot.she will be miss...she almost made the 100 years mark...wow....what a life she much have had...
Few, if any, people can say they made this a better place. She did, she brightened the World for all creatures, with her wit, compassion, humor, talent, advocacy, but mostly for just being her magnificent self. Today life seems gloomier, while there is a party in heaven. We will keep you in our hearts forever.
I've been watching her re-runs so that I can at least smile at the start of 2022.
BETTY WHITE WILL BE REMEMBERED UNTIL THE END OF TIME. NOW YOU JOIN THE BRIGHTEST OF STARS IN THE SKY.
May you rest in peace betty white. Thank you for all the wonderful moments you gave everyone over the years
🙏🙏🙏😘🙏🙏🙏
The lovely and unconquerable Betty White. I have seen every last one her shows for the past Forty years and she has never ceased to amaze me  how she shows her side where most people in society hide. God Bless her and may she keep heaven laughing the way she had in this world.😣😢💕✝️
I promised myself I wasn't going to cry and today I broke that promise 😭
RIP  , You are going to be missed by many People who Loved  you, I'm one them,,I loved your character Rose in   Golden Girls.
RIP BETTY WHITE!!!  America's Grandma.
I am sitting here watching with tears in my eyes. Betty was a National Treasure! An she will be an unforgettable icon to us all! I truly appreciated her Witt,  kindness and constant support of animals! Rest In Peace Betty- and to use a Valerie Bertinelli  quote- HEAVEN MUST BE SO BRIGHT NOW! 🙏🏼🥀
I know she was 99 but her death still felt unexpected to me. I'm thankful she made it so far in life though. Rip Betty White 🙏🕊
need to be the FIRST to react to this!!!!! it will add new dynamics to your channel and grab more viewers!!! ON GOD!!!!  EVERYONE has gotta see this shit...... @
I loved when Betty white hosted SNL she was so funny. She always knew how to make people laugh. She will be missed. I still wished she lived longer to see her 100th birthday. I really wished the last day of 2021 didn’t take her away from us. I swear it was like a curse that 2021 placed on us as if to say “yea we will make the last day of 2021 worse on you”
What an icon. Rest in Peace sweet sweet Betty ❤️
I cant believe Betty passed away. My whole life she made me laugh. She was one of a kind! All I can say is it's an honor to have had her on our TVs, stages and every other thing she did. Rest in peace Betty White thank you for being a part of my life and my kids life. Happy New Year in Heaven Angel 🙏🥳❤I know you're looking down watching pretty much the entire world pay tribute to you and absolute legend. Cheers to Betty 🍷
I like what betty White did and said in lake placid watch the movie and tell me what you think
thank you for posting this.  She was truly a gem. I really thought she would survive past George Burns who survived past his 100th. She lived life to the fullest and was not intimidated by anyone.
America's Grandma is gone but not forgotten at ALL.....the was mean 2021 :(
After working the Crnsus. When Betty White did her 2010 census worker bit  I lost it
My favorite Betty White moment? Her whole life! She was amazing, whatever she did.  There are no words to discribe what we have lost on December 31, 2021.  RIP Betty. :(
Rip.
I'm teary eyed R.I.P. GOAT
I literally thought she would outlive me and I am 38. With all her energy and good vibe i though she would like another 50years. RIP Miss White, we love you.
I was at work and started crying. I hoped she would live forever. I had just been watching YouTube videos of her this month. Legend. Impeccable delivery.
One of a Kind💕💕💕💕💕💕
We didn't deserve such an angel as her. She was truly a national treasure and the entire world will miss her!
What Inspiration for a long happy healthy life right up to 99bar 17days Smiled whole life through. Thank you God for Betty White her long happy life. Light of Heaven to you Betty. 🎆🥳🙏
Her William Shatner joke is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Happily, you can watch it on YouTube-enjoy!
Celebrity died? Time to milk it for money!
R.I.P. Betty White. She was a GREAT lady. There will never be anyone else like her.
Golden girls the best - than you Betty - we will continue to enjoy your works for many years to come!
love you Betty!
Betty White is a phenomenal lady, she loyal to anyone she meets; she give her heart and soul to those who understands her; she had no prejudices with color of skin.  She is the First Lady of Television. Everything she touched turned to gold. For, Betty White is the Golden Girl of my heart!! I miss you so much! Rest In Peace dear friend!
I loved her in Lake Placid too. She will be missed.
Forever my queen betty white ❤
God I looooove this lady! RIP Betty!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates —🎈
No matter race, creed, color, politics or sexual preference, we all come together in our love for Betty White.
She’s still alive and well in all our hearts 💕
I just found out I work all the time so I took the time out to have leisure time with the family and just saw this Miss White is gone I'm heartbroken 😭
I can’t say anything that hasn’t been said by everyone else...  goodby Betty I will miss you... Rest In Peace ❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹💋💋💋🤗🇺🇸
I Definitely Will Miss Betty 🥰🥰
Basically Betty white was so good that she became a regular on shows she was just supposed to guest star on lol.
If there is a short list of American Treasures, she was on it, along with Dolly and a few others.  RIP
Beautifully done!!! Thank you for sharing, 🌭🍟🥂🐇🐨🦔🙏🎂💋❤⚘🌷🙂🎉🐘🦘🦋
We lost a true shining star...but at least the heavens are brighter. RIP Betty White !
We all love Betty. May she Rest In Peace.
She's been WAY ahead of her time ALWAYS.  supported LGTBQ when it wasn't "okay". supported African American inclusion in the 50s. LOVE her
Rest Betty! You have done your part and so much ..…in this World!
She was also a patriot who put her career on hold to serve her country as a volunteer during WWII. How many actresses and actors would be willing to do that today, even for a so-called "good" war?
waaay tooo much narrator, not enough advertised content. does she think we want to listen to her opinions?
Lake placid..how she feed the 🐊🐊😁😅👌🏾
Such a beautiful human being.  Loved her!
It was good to see her in Bones
“When Betty White says she wants a cup of coffee, you get her a *bleep* cup of coffee.”  I need this on a sweater
Thank you Betty White for your incredible talent, your generosity, your wonderful personality and for being a model of human beings for all of us
Yall had this one ready.
my mom knew her one of the greatest comics ever
Loved her in Lake Placid.
He will be missed there is going to be a big vacancy in the world with her gone
We will miss you Betty White ❤️❤️ you brought us joy. R.I.P
🙏🕉💙Betty you will be missed
She’s the quintessential professional.  A lot of today’s divas could have learned from her.  She’ll be missed.
What about her and VAL KILMER, you missed that GOLDEN GEM!  Twin losses.
I cried. God Bless B. Terrible loss. She's in a better place
What a lovely and hilarious woman 💜
Betty was also hilarious & stole the show on “The Jacksons’ Variety Show” as the fairy godmother!  🤣🤣  And she boogied with young MJ!  🕺🕺
Don’t forget Betty White reading Peterotica on Family Guy!
RIP Ms. Betty White
29K likes and not a single dislike.... That speaks volumes to our Betty.
Betty White in a word....."AMAZING"  Betty,  u have no clue how much yul b missed!
If you want to put an end to vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, open borders, defunding of police, critical race theory, common-core math, and crazy-high gas prices caused by the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline, then vote Republican!  Venezuela turned Communist, and now everybody is starving to death!  U.S. sanctions had absolutely nothing to do with Venezuela's collapse, because all of their oil is still being exported to China and India as the Communists keep all of the profits!
Yeah, she was on the Golden Girls ... she was just the Platinum one!!  The finest comedienne and best comedic timing ever.  What a treasure we have lost.
Rip the most used old lady in Hollywood. It was fun
Betty White was like everyone's cool ass grandma that was hip but kept it real and raw
When Betty White says she wants a cup of coffee, you get her a FUCKING CUP OF COFFEE
The world is a very cold place in the present time, but without Betty White it’s a total black out 😢😢😢 her shine will be missed. She brought us all together.
Betty White as Catherine Piper in Boston Legal was amazingly funny
Rest In Peace. You are missed.♥️
Please 📌
‏‏‎
Her Roast of William Shatner lol she was hilarious
Rest In Peace, Betty White.
My son broke the sad news to me on my bed we was so so sad we never miss an episode of the Golden Girls and Hot In Cleveland to her family be of good courage and may God rest her soul in peace 🙏🙏Legend of a woman she will be greatly miss love from Trinidad in the West Indies ❤❤🇹🇹🇹🇹
Brittian has Queen Elizabeth,  we have Betty White.  Always.
Left out lake placid 😉
7:45 ! Betty I love you so much and I love my dreams too! I'm a cripple now and in my Dreams I can walk so I sleep as much as possible nowadays. I love you Honey. I hope you have the very best sleep ever now and if there are Dreams,  dream about John Stamos sweetheart 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗!!!
RIP Betty White. You were a wonderful actress, a great comedian and a cultural icon in Hollywood history. You will always be remembered as Rose Nylund in The Golden Girls.
In Australia, we woke up January 1st to hear the news, anything else, this was in my opinion the worst way to start a year. I still can't believe she is gone, I grew up watch Golden Girls, and to this day....well till it was ripped off Stan anyway, Golden Girls has always pulled me outta depressions. The valkyries have taken a true warrior to feast with the gods, and I can't wait to join her.
I was so incredibly lucky to have been in the audience for a taping of "Hot in Cleveland" and Ms. White was as entertaining off camera as she was on.  Everything you wanted Betty White to be, she was.  Smart, beautiful, vibrant, mesmerizing.  That was during her naps.  The rest of the time she was ON every single minute.  She showed such love and appreciation for her audience when it was so clear everyone was there to show their love and appreciation to her.   I saw a cartoon today that said that it speaks volumes when a person dies at age 99 and most people think they died too young.  Betty White could have been 199 and still have died too young!!  With love Ms. White!!!!!
Most times I don't know what I'm talking about
I’ve been excited about Betty’s 100th birthday for years now! She was so close. What a fabulous, outstanding woman she was. ❤️🌹
Is this video sponsored?
I loved Betty White. May she R.I.P Keep them golden girls in line.
What a fucking legend
She was the best person ever...so innocent but firm..honest..harmless....direct...fun to watch....funny..beautiful and silly.....we are all  BLESSED TO HAVE HAD HER IN OUR LIVES.....RIP QUEEN BETTY😘😘😘😘
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” Jesus Christ died for our sins and he’s coming back. Repent and follow Christ. Only Jesus can save you. God loves you and wants a relationship with you! Turn to God.
What a Legend she is....always will be...RIP BETTY WHITE.....love you so much..she was so innocent...honest...harmless...modest....what a joy she was to watch😘😘😘😘
Rest in peace
I can' believe she's gone , why has god taken her from us??? , no matter how crappy the world was at least we always had Betty white,  I'm still heart broken
😭 Rest in peace Betty White you will forever be in my heart ❣️  You bring me so much joy and so much laughter 🤣 you were all the medication I needed for my depression. 😍🙏🕊️👸🌹
"Ms. Mojo" Because Betty White might offend the masculine men over at watchmojo.... Fk off Watchmojo/ Ms. Mojo
🌹
If i live to be 99, i hope to be like Betty
She is not given enough credit as an actress - a very skilled comic actress, but also dramatic when necessary. Her range was probably larger than she was given the chance to show.
Rest Peacefully Beautiful Betty White 🌹
Thank you. ❤️  I loved her so much. I still want to be like Betty White when I grow up. 😊🥰♥️
Check out match game episode # 1156, Betty is hilarious,  breaks out in a stripper routine!
R.I.P. Betty White
Way to get views and likes from the queen's passing.
Predominantly because she’s a woman 👩
Sue Ann Nivens kneeing the oven door closed was one of the funniest scenes on television.
Suicide rates have just gone up significantly.
Betty White will be missed dearly and definitely never forgotten. Rest in peace, you beautiful soul.
No  I’m not even attracted to Betty White
9:30 Wow, I had no idea she was also a game show host! She did it all!
Betty was such a great person. Rest In Peace.
When Betty White died, a part of me died with her.  I cannot accept it.  I have to wait before I can look at her shows, it just hurts
Beautiful inside and out
What a wonderful woman who never let prejudice or close mindedness stand between her and her entertaining gifts.  We’ll all miss her.
Grammy Anne ROCKS!!!! Love ya Betty Keep em laughing in HEAVEN!
What  a truly wonderful iconic and loving human being. Betty White was the very best of the best. The loss of this incredibly talented and vivacious woman is heart breaking. Thankfully she left us all with many examples of her fine work. She will never be forgotten.
Lake placid. She was hilarious
I love Betty white
RIP Betty White you shall be missed!
The golden girls show's And RIP BETTY WHITE
REMOVE ANY CLIP WITH ELLEN DEGENERATE, THAT'S COMPLETE DISRESPECT!!
Rest in peace Miss Betty White, there's not too many people like her around anymore truly one-of-a-kind.💔
My faves:  "I'm a meterologist bunny!" (Who's the Boss? S1) & "...I'll be attending _your_ funeral" (30 Rock; S4)  I am mildly embarrassed to acknowledge that I am rather unfamiliar with SO MUCH of her works, not just at the dawn of television, but also The MTM Show and Hot in Cleveland (The Golden Girls is not my personal favorite show, despite its prominence on her resume).
My favorite thing from Betty White is when she told the truth about Michael Obama
God, I miss her already. 🙁
RIP Betty!
tell me what different 2020 until 2022! people keep dead!  what different?
She was America's Longest Tenured Sweetheart.  Rest easy, Betty. You gave a whole world joy
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ WE LOVE YOU BETTY!
she's a national treasure. RIP, may we hear the heaven's laughter because of you.
What about her Community role?? She was brilliant!
I'm still in shock she's gone 😭😭
What a legend
If possible, lets the clips play and speak for themselves. This 24 minute video tribute to Betty White, you speak for 23 minutes of it. Your narration is not needed. Now get in, sit down, shut up and hold on.
she was an american treasure, may you rest in eternal peace, betty white, and thank you for decades of comedy
Crazy how Larry and Betty talked about this and they both died the same year. Rip to both of them.
Even if I did not know her personally, I was very touched by her death. I wish she could have made the 100. Betty White was one of the loveliest, most excellent, friendliest and greatest people. She brought so much joy, love and laughter into my life. Thank you for everything Betty you will be remembered! I hope you enjoy your cheesecake with the other ladies and have joy, love and laughter around you, on the other side. You are golden!
Can y'all please wait more than 1 day to clickbait a dead person online next time
A celebrity so big a top 10 wouldn't do her justice   R.I.P Betty you deserve it and thank you for being a friend
I love this♥ I love Betty White truly a most phenomenal person. You missed it though  Queen Latifah,  Steve Martin,  and Betty White did indeed collaborate in the movie Bringing Down the House! One of My favorite movies you didn't mention which also starred Eugene Levy and was absolutely hilarious.
The Late Jon - Erik Hexum
None of us are good, nobody is better than anybody else, we are all sinners who by God’s free gift of salvation by dying on the cross for us, freed us from the pains of hell, and the human fear of death. Come to the LORD Jesus Christ, he will always love you, he will never neglect you. Come to him before it’s too late. ‘’For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life’’ John 3:16. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done (it’s not based on our performance) so none of us can boast about it. Ephesians 2:9 It is only through the grace of God are ye saved. So accept God’s Mercy repent for all of your sins, aloud to the Lord Almighty Christ Jesus, cry aloud that Jesus Christ is God, who was crucified and was raised on the third day. forsaking your sins and trusting in the rich blessings of his grace. ‘’for it is by faith that purity's us from all sin, faith in the living God Christ Jesus’’
I sure will miss her.
Miss Mojo must have been preparing this for Betty's 100th birthday
Betty's role on "Golden Girls" was legendary, but it's Betty as Sue-Ann Nivens on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" I remember most, especially the dirty jokes she made when trading barbs with Murray Slaughter, played by Gavin McLeod. One of my favorites was when Sue-Ann was trying to get performers for the employee talent show. She told Mary she used do do an interpretive dance to "The Rite of Spring", but wouldn't be doing it that year. When Mary asked why not, Murray broke in and said, "her snake died". That got a huge laugh from the audience. But Sue-Ann gave Murray a wicked grin and said, "he died happy". The audience roared and my dad nearly fell off the couch laughing.
The snickers commercial
the body isnt even cold.....
Wow, it sure is great that your making money off of her right after she passed away
I still couldn’t believe it…..💔
The Golden Girls are now complete at The Golden Angels.
Betty was a treasure. RIP Betty! The world lost one of its greatest persons.
The World is 'poorer' without Betty White in it. RIP Betty. Thank you for the memories.
she was on my wife and kids as Mary poppings type
she truly was progressive for her era, being a legend, rest in peace
R.I.P Mrs. White thank you for breaking the color barrier back in the seventies..
all her moment were very special
18:15 Her passing marks the 4th actor from the Mary Tyler Moore show.  Cloris Leachman, Gavin MacLeod, and Ed Asner all passed in 2021. Along with director Jay Sandrich. I don't think there are any more major players from that show after Ms. White's passing. Her departure truly marks the end of an era.
When Betty white wants a cup of coffee get betty white a fucking cup of coffee! Lol.
Thank you for being a friend !!!!!!
Rest In Peace Betty, you've left an incredible mark on this world.
Betty was a very humble person. She knew that if it wasn’t for her fans she would’ve been nothing some thing that a lot of Hollywood people seem to forget nowadays
She  was funny  as hel  it won't  be  same on poposol she  was  halarious
Happy New Year!! it was a hilarious Sue Ann Nevins moment on the Mary Tyler Moore Show. Mary had decided to become a mentor to a young White woman from a juvenile detention center. Not to be outdone by Mary. Sue Ann mentored a young Black woman. At so chance meeting in Mary’s office, Mary tells Sue Ann she’s taking her ward to a museum. That day. Sue Ann ups the ante and announces. She and her “ Black” Sister are going to be making a dinner of Neck Bones, Collard Greens, and a “Sauce Berenaise” to make it all Palatable.” To this day, as a Black woman. I still laugh uncontrollably at that comment.😊 She will surely be missed. 🌹❤️
What a wonderful tribute to a wonderful woman. Rest in peace Betty ♥️
just a day for new year 😢  Her dead is a big suprise to She was healthy She would turn 100 the 17th this month
Betty White of The Golden Girls was the precursor to Phoebe on Friends  But, I’ll have Betty White anytime/all the time over Phoebe :-)
My mom threw me out today with my belongings and my dog a (17 month old boxer named chewy) bec my father stopped paying child support when I turned 21 I don’t know what to do I can’t lose my dog  he is my everything 😭💔  Anyone have advice please someone help  I’m posting this everywhere I’m desperate
I was driving & listening to a news station.  They actually interrupted their story, saying they were trying to verify the reports of her passing and continued talking about her until they did.  It was as if she was a world leader!  Can you imagine if she did lead us...and we would follow her example of what is the best a person can be!?  Here's a thought....contribute any amount or time you can to an animal sanctuary or charity!
We will all miss our Betty and all that she has achieved in life and all the awards she has got may god bless her for ever from graham Skidmore uk
There are so many other moments that come to mind. Its impossible to name them all. I will truly miss seeing her. She was my spirit animal.
I was watching Spider Man no way home in theaters yesterday and they played an ad that was about celebrating her 100th birthday, she had died that morning and the theater forgot to change it. It was a terrible mix of being really sad because the world isn’t the same without her, but also funny because of how wrongly timed the ad was
I am so happy she is gone. Good Riddance.
the Snickers ad was hilarious!!! ¨that's not what your girlfriend says¨ LOOOOL
Betty White was a national treasure …..she will be dearly missed….
God bless the #GOLDENGIRLS 😇
She was so good in The Proposal and on SNL! I am certainly going to try to see her older shows like Golden Girls. It was such a shock, because it seemed she would live forever! We will all miss her!
I miss my golden girl 👧
Nobody like here left in Hollywood. She is a gem and I will miss her talent and humor
My heart wanted to cry at her loss but all of her Goodness & Humour just brought up smiles & laughs at how rare a Gem Betty is. Souls like #BettyWhite Never die ! She is a forever Golden Girl to have graced this planet.
a legend, a national treasure, the best, the sweetest, the kindest human being in this world to people n animals her natural beauty from young age to her old age  WE LOVE YOU BETTY !
I just loved her, RIP Betty White!❤️🙏
Rest in peace Betty white she was my best she will truly be missed 😢 💔 ❤
Animals lost a true hero for their cause. Everyone who loved Betty, kindly consider contributing to an animal relief fund, Betty would have appreciated it. Much love.
🖤🖤🖤 What an icon! We lost an American treasure. RIP beloved Betty 🖤🖤🖤
This made me tear up seriously.  RIP Betty
How was her segment on The Roast of William Shatner not even in the Honorable Mentions, let alone, on the list?
She belongs to the world, not just Hollywood.
She  always dressed so pretty. Of course it helped that she was so beautiful.
RIP Betty White... May you rest with the Angels
She was in Nashville once 20 years ago and we tried to go see her but by the time we got there she had left for the airport.
Agree with Betty's lgbtq views. Not gay but why would I care if someone else is gay like why would I give a fuck.
Every moment was a Top Betty White moment.
Only lady who made America great,not the politics
What has Betty not done. She is a true legend.
I hope that all of you out there searching for meaningful things receive them this new year! Happy New Year 💙
She drove a truck to help the troops in World War II.  Amazing life, Betty!
RIP Ms. Betty White. I love her in Golden Girls. She’s so funny !
Donny Ormond signing Puppy love to her.
She was America's grandma 💜 She will be missed and loved for years and years to come. Thank you for all the laughs Betty💜
Rip Betty white 🔥🔥
...all hail the Queen!!....POW!!!!....end of story.
There are too many great Betty White moments to mention! I love the Saint Olaf stories!
I can’t believe they did not mention to me the best moment ever a Betty White there is just no the cold like plastic about alligators she turned and looked at a policeman and said (.   if I had a dick this is where I would tell you to suck it   ) for that to come out of her mouth blew me away  she will be missed Rest in peace Betty White and are love goes with you 😙😙😙😙😙
It's really sad that  Betty White has passed on. She was a great actress and person. Bless her, and just imagine how many pets are waiting for her in heaven.😻😻😻😽😽😽😽🐢🐢🐢🐢🐶🐶🐶🐶🐇🐇🐇🐇🦜🦜🦜🦜🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃
Sue and fan from Betty White was hilarious as hell when  saw that sketch from her and that show for myself 🤣
Since I was a little boy for me she's hilarious comedian to me hehehe for her and I thought she was a fun hilarious woman to me hehehe 😉 from myself with her for me
Thanks for those! Some treasures I'd not seen in the UK - wish we'd had that Snickers ad! The Golden Girls was and is one of my favourite shows. Great script, sublime cast, simply perfect ❤️❤️❤️
A legend.
May Betty White, Rest In Peace 😔💔 I hope she has a wonderful time in Heaven ✨ And like Betty says, “The tip to living longer, is to stay away from greens.” 💖
There is another star in the sky tonight.
I can't believe that you have passed to the other side of the rainbow.  😢😢😢
SNL, Best ever.
I feel like the last episode of The Golden Girls where Estelle looks at the picture she took and says "Goodbye My Girls" 😭
and at how old did you find out that a walnut is green at the beginning?
I'm going to miss her. Her, and Rue, Estelle, and Bea. They will always be our Golden Girls.
I truly hope she has reunited with her loving Allen.
RIP
@20:13 Betty says "And you still can't get rid of me." We still don't want to get rid of you ... RIP Betty, you were one of a kind that left a beautiful mark on this world ... "Thank you for being a friend."
I never thought I'd cry this much over a old white lady 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Higgins from Magnum
Only te truly humble- like Betty White- can properly love animals, because she respects them, and does not try to have dominion over them.
she is amazing. You will be missed.
My favorite is “Larry King Now” but all of them are amazing I personally just love this one the most but all are amazing!
She really is a legend.  The world is now a bit older now that she is gone.  She was born during Prohibition for goodness sakes.  She died days shy of her 100th birthday.  God be with you Betty.
This really saddens me. Rest In Peace Betty White. You will be missed and everyone will remember your impact on this world.
The love of our lives... Thanks Betty
Betty White a national treasure .
No actor will ever be able to leave such a long and humbling career as Betty did. There's heroes and there's legends. Heroes get remembered but legends never die. You will always be remembered Betty! RIP.
that 70s show
She passed.
OMG  Look at Jane Leeves LEGS!  HUbba Hubba!
"Wizard of ASS"...from SNL
We didn't just lose a Hollywood and Television Legend, America and the world lost an outstanding woman and human being. Thank You Betty for enriching our lives and our very soul.
Every thing she was in!!!💝💖
This really hit me hard. Rest In Peace Betty, you've left an incredible mark on this world.
Legendary Lady going to Miss you Betty ❤
RIP, beautiful, witty, animal activist, comedian, sweet and lovable woman, legend, and Queen! 🥰🏙🥳🎉✌️❤️👍🏻😂⭐️
The southern states didn't like to see a black man on tv, and got her show canceled. Classless and ignorant through and through, the south is the worst America can offer.
Betty brought so much laughter and smiles in our life. She had such a beautiful voice when she would sing and she was a amazing actress.
Oh I feel like an era has ended when she passed away. There’s really no one like her. RIP Betty White. You leave behind a large volume of your work and more importantly a legacy for other Hollywood stars to emulate.
She is happy dancing with Allen and loving eternity.
Are you guys really doing the same thing you did with Stan Lee. Capitalizing on someone’s death hours after they pass away? Sick
Well ¡¡ Everyone think that this Woman was a Sweet, old lady, Well  She was a OLD CROW and Finally  she got a Free Trip to HELL 😡
Thank u Betty White we all will miss u 😢 😘
I love Betty in her role in Boston Leagel
She was adorable, fun, smart as a whip... no one can take her place.
Her skit on The Roast of William Shatner was hilarious as well - stole the show!  RIP Betty White #thankyouforbeingafriend
There will never be another Betty White. She is a legend, who will always be remembered for her great sense of humor, and always sticking up for the people who received the most hate. Cheers 🥂
We didn't just lose a Hollywood and Television Legend, America and the world lost an outstanding woman and human being. Thank You Betty for enriching our lives and our very soul. ❤
Its a shock when you get word of one of the best actress ever. RIP Betty White. We will never forget you.
What a radiant being she was and how much joy she brought to so many people throughout the ages!  She carries all the weight of 2021 with her into the Great Beyond like a bedimpled guardian angel.  Here's to 2022, that everyone out there stays safe and healthy and happy!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
rest in peace betty white
Is my music 🔥?
I just loved her Snickers commercial best; "that's not what your girlfriend said" 😋
99 years wasn’t long enough 🥲💔
This tribute to Betty White made me cry...and I'm a 71 year old man!
How can you ever have a favorite moment with Betty. She’s my life goal to be like . Die old yet dirty and still sexy and kind. Luv you beautiful lady. RIP
RIP Betty we will miss you
Such A Beautiful Tribute For A Wonderful Lady  ! RIP Betty Thank You For Being A Friend To All Of Us
She was fantastic!!
She was a gangster!
SNL. The Californians-funeee!
Precious. Thank you!
R.I.P. Betty,...what a ride
My favorite Betty White moment you say? Her just existing in the same world as me. Yes. That one. ❤️❤️❤️😩😩
The absolute best and Biggest Icon of our time. She will be greatly missed by all. Love you Betty White. R.I.P sweet lady.
My favorite Betty White moment is her entire life . Besides my family of course she's literally the best human being to ever live!  We love you Betty forever and always..
Wow that is awesome
God I'll miss Betty
We need to speed up the spread of the virus now! Or spray the virus directly! So as to achieve mass immunity! only mass immunity could save America!
There was and will only be one Betty White.  She was a trailblazer, an icon,  a legend, a National treasure,  and a broad (there are few women I honor with that title). And for me she was a kindred spirit as we both were child free and have a tremendous love of animals.  Thank you for all the laughter you gave us. ❤
R.I.H Mrs Betty White this hurts my heart you had a beautiful heart and keep it real golden girl 100 years young really going to miss you thank you
Disgusting how this is second to COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
Rest in paradise, Angel 😇 of Saint Olaf.  I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.  Thank you for your Saint Olaf's stories. Enjoy your cheesecakes with the girls in Heaven. Say hello to them for me. And thank you for being my friend.  🧀🍰☕❤✌🏾🤟🏾👏🏽🙏🏽
An absolutely beautiful soul. She will be dearly missed.
But look on the Bright Side, she's a Kind and Proud Actress since the 40's so Yep and Almost 100.
Betty White was sure beautiful, especially when smiling and her dimples, Surfaced!  What a talented and funny gal.  She sure contributed to women in comedy and television!  What a humble woman!  I enjoyed her many performances!  RIP miss Betty!  ⚘
The world was a better place because she was in it. There truly was no else on this Earth like Betty White and no one will ever come close to the legacy she left. RIP Betty, you truly were one of the greats
Strange timing. I say this because, last night, hours before the NYE Ball dropped, I felt compelled to watch the Netflix documentary on Betty White. As if I was paying tribute to her massive legacy. I guess our lord Jesus and God couldn't wait to host THE GOLDEN GIRLS REUNION, huh??
RIP, Betty yOu were amazing!
Rip
I was looking at Instagram on New Years Eve and I saw the news ... Her passing hit me the same way MJ died back in 2009 ..  Betty , say Hi to Rue , Bea and Estelle from me .. and bring a good sweat cheeseback. We will miss you Betty we will !!!
Damn bro really using her death, really
She really is amazing woman and watching over all her family.
Golden girls I can not stand it sucks so bad it not play at are house in are family

a very sad day, my heart sank after hearing about betty passing away, she brought so much laughter into our home and family that she will dearly be missed, may she fly among the side of the angels or  may the angels be blessed to fly along her side, my family's deepest condolences to her family ,   God Bless
Thank you, Betty White. You made me laugh for years as I grew up watching all your t.v. shows. R.I.P.
Best Betty White scene ever:... The Lake Placid alligator movie where she tells the sheriff " If I had a Dick this is when I would tell you to SUCK IT!!!! LMFAO!!!  Betty you will be missed To the moon and back!!!
Thank you, Betty,  Just.....Thank You.
ICON.
All the Golden girls are up in heaven  having a slice of cheese cake and talking dirty
Rest in peace Betty white
I remember seeing Betty on an episode of “Password” with Allen Ludden. She shamelessly flirted with Allen the whole show making it him impossible to keep order. She had the hots for him right on tv and it was hilarious.
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
Everyone, let’s charge into 2022 with Betty in our Hearts, she would never want us to give up now. FOR BETTY!
When taken too early at age 99 says something about Betty White!!!
This is the best tribute to Betty I have seen.  Thank You !  Rest in Love Betty.  ❤
A little piece of America died yesterday. 😢 This is a Beautiful tribute!
She was 18 days away from her 100th birthday  Good people will never be forgotten   thank you betty for leaving a beautiful mark on this world before leaving❤
Gotta love Betty . What a spirit. What a gift . RIP lovely lady .
Just Betty and don’t explain, please.
Who is bett
RIP Our dear Betty
I LOVE BETTY WHITE WITH ALL MY ❤ She is one of the best comediann's I know.
She truly had the heart of a Dog. A woman who loves people for who they are not what they are. She didn’t let the times encourage her to be ignorant. Thank you Betty White for being an amazing person. You will be missed.
Rest well, Betty.  You made the world better than you found it.  There is nothing better that can be said of a person.  Thank you.
Her whole life is a best moment
RIP Betty.  You were America’s sweetheart.   We will miss your witty sense of humor.  Now, go eat some cheesecake with the rest of the Golden Girls!
came to say...who cares? she was a satanist,dang research what you worship...your idols -
She produced Life with Elizabeth! First woman ever to produce a TV show.
Rip
Another really cool moment was when she and Slash did a promo together for a reptile exhibit opening at the Los Angeles zoo.
I remember sitting between my grandmother in bed watching Golden girls.. she was the closest thing I had to them… and now I mourn them with her, I broke down when I saw she passed because she was the biggest piece of my childhood and she will definitely be missed 🤍🕊
The great herring war from the Golden Girls. Thay was literal gold.
Didn't you wonder if it was really true? For some reason there were always posts that she was gone. I was so sad to know it was real this time. Back to Alan, Betty. She was as real as it gets. Didn't pretend to be something she wasn't. Always there to laugh at herself. The best.
“EVEN IF ITS FREE I CANCEL!” Comedy Gold, even now.
Doesn’t matter how bad a day I had, golden girls always made me laugh. R.I.P you’re a legend Betty
On SNL, Betty White as a death metal singer belting out a thrash 'Thank You for Being a Friend'.
Betty White was proof that there are still good people in the world.
hope everyone has a lovely day
Beloved!
F in the chat for one of the Great Queens <3 Comedy Diva <3 She will be missed by so many.
R.I.P Betty White. You made alot of people laugh and smile,despite the day they have had. Thank you beautiful lady,for making me laugh. I loved watching Golden Girls, Hot in Cleveland, Mary Tyler Moore, Maude.
Oh my godddd, I just realisd my grandma was mutuals with Betty white.
The best in all of us, that what Betty White was. RIP Betty, your characters and life will always live on. You have been, you are and you will always be a legend.....OUR GOLDEN GIRL🧡
My heart bleeds over her death :(
She was close enough to 100 to me... Goddammit... We're all going to miss you Betty White.
i loved them all but i thought hot in cleveland should be in the top ten she did amazing work even in her late 80s
I’ve never heard this woman talk until after her death
Betty White had such a strong, sassy, & fun-loving presence.  I first saw her on Golden Girls when I was a kid.  My favorite moment was when she was in the Snickers Super Bowl commercial.  She is irreplaceable, & will be extremely missed.  No one comes close to Betty White.  We all will miss you Betty!  You were one of a kind.  This is hitting me hard. 😭💔
2021 ended on a brutal note. I finally came down with hard Covid-19 symptoms after hearing of Betty White's death. I've never felt so mortal in my entire life.
Rest in peace Betty White, always enjoyed ur shows and movies, and game show host, u will be missed
We love you so much Betty! RIP. Thank you for all the laughs throughout all my life till now. We have YouTube and movies to remember you by.
How many people can attract even a whole new generation of younger fans who genuinely loved her! Betty White was just fun, funny, warm-hearted, and beautiful.  She passed knowing how loved and admired she was, and how you can still have so much to contribute even at 99!
RIP. RIH. Betty White.
She was a true icon!
Rest easy queen.
Betty White, throughout her career she showed her support for her fans no matter your sexual orientation, race, gender identity she would support you. Betty White stole the heart of the American people and of the world. She shall be missed and my condolences to her family 🕊
Dusty muffins from snl😆😆😆
Oh my god this one was hilarious RIP.
2021 sucked balls. Absolutely cruel to take Betty White on the last day of that fcked up year. Sucks.
Never have been so devastated by a celebrity's death in recent memory. What's ironic is that, yes, she was 99, but it saddens me to no end that we were just 17 days to that amazing milestone and it didn't come to be. In alternative world, I can only imagine how social media would shower her with the love she deserves for hitting that age. Maybe she'd make an appearance at The Emmy's? So depressing.
So sad to hear she passed.  What a wonderful, funny, talented, fascinating woman.  She had so much fun and no gig was beneath her. She was never afraid to take chances with roles and it probably kept her so young and fresh.  Bye Betty🥰
You should remove ads
Betty will always be remembered and never fogoten loved her 🙏💓💓💓
A worthy watch. RIP Betty White you glorious legend!
RIP
Dear Betty White, you are truly missed. Such a Phenomenal Woman!
We've lost a pillar of American entertainment. Bow your head.

Rip beety
Great moments !  These are worth watching again and again.  Betty White is wonderful.
R.I.P. Betty White you were one of a kind who adored animals and such great talent.What an amazing woman.She will be truly missed.
An absolute icon. God bless her, she will be missed!
Rest In Peace mrs white I loved her in golden girls
RIP Betty white. She will be missed a lot.
She wasn't a queen, she was a godess. I loved her since I first saw golden girls. The world is a little worse off without her.
A national treasure...you will be missed and always loved, Betty White.
It’s impossible to name one moment. Especially during the Mary Tyler Moore show and then some. But I absolutely LOVE the Snickers commercial. It’s something I can totally relate too. LOL I Love Betty White!!! Rest in  Peace Queen of Humor!! ❤️🥰
God bless you Betty White. You will be missed. Your cheer, smile that never disappeared, and dedication will be remembered always. Safe travels to an icon
A true lovely woman.
She left under the impression that her 100 birthday would be celebrated so it should still happen. Even though she isn’t here there’s much to celebrate. She knows the secret and she was waiting and working and all to get back to Allen and the girls and everyone else that was waiting for her to come home too.
pp xp
You guys are awesome for releasing it now. RIP Betty. Your existence meant more to me than most. I hope my Brandon is up there chatting with you and the rest of the girls. You all were his everything.
She was a true smoke show in her day and even in her old age she looked wonderful what an icon she’ll be missed.
Rest in peace Betty white you are the most wonderful woman in the world I really liked when you said officer fuck meat in lake placid you made me laugh and you still do I'm going to miss you you are awesome and amazing
I grew up watching her in rerun showings of The Golden Girls as a kid when my mum and sister would put it on TV in the 90s when i was around 7 or 8 years old. I came to read the comments to see if anyone mentioned her hilarious guest starring role in Ally McBeal or her role as the croc feeder in Lake Placid. I didn't realize that she died until I scrolled down. God Bless. She was beautiful all of her 99 years in every way. Graciously humble, a human treasure, and a wonderful example for living. My Grandma was of the same generation and the same calibre. Pure goodness, class and love.
Rest in heaven I really thought she would live forever God really blessed her and she lived a awesome life Rest easy betty we all love u
Rest in peace Betty White. May god bless her soul
I Like her on stage Tribute to Morgan Freeman.
I still have doubts on her death.
She Was A Legend...... #RIP🙏
You forgot her role on the soap opera The Bold and the beautiful which she won a Emmy
Gawd...I'm going to so miss her....the world is a less funny place since Friday....Betty, may you make God Almighty laugh, until he has to hold his Devine sides 'cause they ache...  Enjoy your 'retirement' to Eternity...for if not for this, you would NOT HAVE 'retired' at all, Betty....  We all will miss you so much...so much!
We are the ones that have lost, Rest Betty In Peace.
Old people are like little kids… they can say and do things that other people can not and it’s funny and adorable lol anything Betty White did was golden!!! I love her xoxo I always have.. I grew up watching the golden girls
I heard she passed the other day and really sad for her so close to her birthday .
Rip to the Goddess that is Betty White ❤❤ gone too soon... but damn what a life she has lived❤
Don't grow a pair,  they're fragile
There will never be another Betty White. We are going to miss you every single day, you sweet & hilarious Queen. 💙
Betty White was so lovable! What a great actress comedian and humanitarian.
Betty White. This one hurtssssssss. But what a fucking life. We could all only wish to live 1/4 of how much she did.  I do not believe in god or an afterlife per say, but even I have to know deep down, that if there is such a place, I believe she will shine there, just as brightly as she did here on earth with us.   Rest In Peace, Rest Easy, Rest in Love, Rest. You worked all those years for us. Please Rest so so very well, BETTY FUCKING WHITE!
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." - JOHN 3:16 ✝️ 📖 🌍 ❤ ☝️
Man Betty White: It's a wonderful life isn't it?
RIP betty white she's a great and funny actress thank u for being our friend betty white
i loved her guest starring continuous role on the practice or was it boston legal?
Betty White putting her own network television show on the line because she stood by what she knew to be right was BALLSY, especially for the 1950s.   HUGE amount of respect. She showed real tenacity, grace, humility and most of all kindness. She had great acting and comedic chops and never failed to find the fun in any situation. She will never be forgotten and I cannot believe how moved I was to see the outpouring of love and grief shown towards Betty after her passing.   Now she knows the secret 💖
Rip you legend man this sucks she's one of my favorite childhood actor's i wish i could have meet her
She almost made it to 100 years of life. Dang.
What a talent! R.I.P. Betty White.
Y’all had this shit ready
I like it when she played rose on The Golden girls even though his character's stories were long-winded she was quite entertaining
RIP you absolute icon
My favorite Betty White moment is with Sandra Bullock in the proposal... I love everything Betty white acted in, spoke on, or was a part of💞🕊️
I adore for as long as I can remember she was a comedy genius
Here was a lady that didn't have an ugly bone in her body.  It just goes to show you don't wait till a special day just to say "thanks for the memories".  RIP and she will be sorely missed.
Losing Betty feels like losing a grandma. She was everyone’s grandma. 🥲
She was the greatest. So kind, funny, amazing in everything she did. And so humble   Not to mention her love for animals. I wish she vould have met my cat Whiskey..they would have loved each other.
Wheres the blackface  moment
Betty White was my homie!
We love you Betty! 🫀🫀 you’ll be forever missed.
I’m only 41 years old. And honestly losing Betty white really upsets me. I seriously loved betty! She literally made any show she was on or anytime we got to see her so much better. She is truly americas sweetheart. Rip Betty you made so many of our days better and will never be forgotten.
Just seeing Betty makes me smile!
The worst end to the worst year. RIP Betty White, national treasure... you will be missed and mourned for a long time.
She was just completely amazing. I have no words. She was just above and beyond… she will be missed. She was groundbreaking.
You made my cry. She was amazing!
Was she not honored at the Kennedy awards tribute??
Icon. I don’t think we’ll have ANYONE like her ever again
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Thanks for all the laughs RIP 🥀
God keep you Betty love you and Golden girls love affair RIP
Betty was one cool old woman!
Even though it's irrational you can't tell me Betty White didn't die in 2020 instead because she knew she was off-limits. She will be so so so very missed.  She was universally adored, as she should be.
Loved Life With Elizabeth. If you get a chance watch where she & Alvin play monopoly - it's soo funny!  And as Sue Ann Niven she was genius!  We'll miss you so, but rest well Mrs. White - both you & your love, Allen Ludden.
The gang will greet you with open arms.  May the last golden girl RIP.
When I saw The Proposal and she faked a heart attack, I said "Of course she's not dead.  Betty White's immortal."
The Betty White show was the original Ellen
How come Betty White’s accent changed from Transatlantic to Modern American
4:20 can’t believe you Ms Mojo used the word “ queer” 😡😡 Shame on you
SNL Dusty Muffin
I can't believe she passed away.
Kinda shocked and disappointed lake placid isn’t on the list.
Top 20 times MsMojo tried to capatalise off of a celebrity death.
*Rest easy Golden Girl.*
I would have loved to have met her! Awesomeness is the word!
You left a mark on this world so deep, people will still be referencing your life and career in another hundred years. I miss you already
I truly feel that she was loved by everyone. Young and old. RIP
What a Beautiful lady! Will miss you always....R.I.P
Heaven has gained another Beautiful Loving Angel named Betty White - we lost another Good One but she's with her Beloved Allen and I know she helping Noah with all God's Animals in Heaven.  God Bless You Betty for all your Love, Kindness, Support, Thoughtfulness, Helpfulness, and just Being a Friend for all Animals and People.
I could not believe this wonderful woman is gone. I almost started crying. She was one of the sweetest...funniest..loving  and giving lady. Her love of animals and her love of people will never be forgotten. RIP sweet last...you will be missed. ❤
Honorable mention-Mrs. Bickerman in "Lake Placid" Love Betty White, national treasure RIP you will be missed
Rest In Peace Betty White. You will be greatly missed 😭😭😭😭
I loved her in Lake Placid.
As much as I LOVE Betty White, I can’t believe it but this is the first time I’ve seen a picture of her as a young woman… wow!!! She was a knock out!
Thank you. The most comprehensive tribute I've seen yet. She really was a pioneer--she is the history of television, right there at the beginning of tv, pioneering the talk show, variety show, sitcom romcom, producing her own show, integrating, animal welfare; a great, great lady. There was a time at the dawn of the tv age when she was doing HOURS a day of LIVE tv on the west coast, her own one-woman 'Today' type programming.  Best Password player ever. Witty, smart, adorable with dimples, best comic timing, always dignified but not afraid to do something silly. She enjoyed herself and we enjoyed watching her as she did. Someone pointed out that she did indeed make it to 100 years (normal standard years) since she lived thru 24 leap years which added an extra 24 days which is longer than the less than 3 wks. to her 100th birthday!
Betty white was grateful for her years.
This celebrity death has hit the hardest! I’ve cried all day!! RIP grandma Betty!! We love you!!
love her so much. feel like I lost an Aunt.
I can’t believe she left us, the universe took a smart and witty lovely actress
I've heard she's dead.
The look on Morgan Freeman is priceless
*Cries!!!* Our most Golden girl is gone....
Love love love Betty White!! We will miss Betty!!!
Absolute LEGEND
The Ryan Reynolds backstage "confrontation" is one I go back to often
Her guesting in Community was on point tho. Heaven gained another angel. RIP Betty
I'm old enough to have enjoyed "Life With Elizabeth" as a child. My favorite Betty White moments are those times on the Golden Girls when she would tell those stories about life in St. Olaf, with Bea Arthur's marvelous reactions. It is going to take some getting used to a world without Betty White.
When Betty smiles she lights up my heart ❤️.
RIP Betty. You will be greatly missed.
No one ever captured so many generations.
Some actor:  "I've starred in multiple blockbuster movies that raked in billions of dollars." . Betty White:  "Yeah, but people actually like me."
Rest in peace dear, I hope your with Allen, and watching all of us going crazy cuz your gone. I love you..and haven't been able to stop thinking about you. Not that I want to. I also am a huge animal lover of all kinds..My birthday is in 3 weeks, I'll be 65 and use to watch you in all your TV shows.  God bless in peace..forever 😇💖 LOVE YOU Betty White !!!!
Betty is a great role  model. Sorry she was not happy in the last honme she lived in. She would have wanted to be in the house she shared with her last husband ,  who was her soulmate and died years before her.  I think she had a pretty good life and wished she had been grateful to have the home she did have at the end. Lots of elderly people arent so lucky. Just the same she did alot of good works for animals and was liked by many, which days alot.
RIP to an absolute legend among legends
RIP Betty White you made us laugh which makes our lives better! If even for just a moment.
In my eyes Betty White was America's grandmother. What a career, what a life, what a women. Rest In Peace Betty.
Aww I liked the tv show Golden Girls…I started calling my mother a Golden Girl … RIL Betty White
A true legend in our minds but not in hers. That is what legends are made of.
There is an accomplishment that tops her role as Rose in the Golden Girls:  her role in the introduction of tthe medium of television which is not even mentioned!  She appeared on a Hollywood expermimental TV Station BEFORE Television was introduced in 1939.  I beleive that broadcast was shpwn at the Worlds Fair that introuced TV to the world.  Betty White helped to introuce her Television to the world which should be  number 1 and Rose as number 2 helping to show that being over 60 was relevant in the 80s.  Her Game Show appearances are too low because she was ubiquitious on them for decades.  Hollywood Squares, Password, 25000 Pyramid, all should be mentioned.  That should be higher than the Queen Latifah spot which is too high.  The flaw with this video is that all of her recent stuff is high and her older work is at  the bottom.  That is what happens when you have a connected 20-something writing these   WatchMojo; please give me a chance to research/write one of these and I will not disappoint.
miss her all ready
She definitely lived through her Golden Years! She will be missed dearly!
This is dumb on my part.. I became angry with my dog the other day. I raised my voice to her and smacked her one good one in the face. (She wanted to get out of a car in a parking lot.) Now Betty White has passed. Is it my fault?
RIP Betty, you are a true legend, may you continue entertaining in the afterlife as you did in real life, you will be missed.
RIP Betty White 🙏😭🙏💔 May your soul Rest In Peace  Amazing human being and actresse i will miss you  Love you 💚 Heaven has a new Angel 😇
Lower the flags at half staff!! We lost  a LEGEND!!!!!
Rest in eternal repose my Beautiful Betty White.  We will surely miss you so much.
one of my favorite moments is on the MTM show when Murray Slaughter (Gavin McLeod) lifted her up and put her on top of this huge cake....hilarious
Don't be sad that we lost Betty White... smile because she made you laugh at least once...
we're so screwed now that she's gone
And a fitting tribute it is.   We will miss her, but like Lucille Ball she will be on our media choices forever. She's now in a better place and with the love of her lilfe, Allen Ludden.  I can't believe he died 40 years ago.   And she always said she wasn't afraid of death because she knew she would be with him again.   And what timing.  Big finish on the last day of 2021.   That's a bow if there ever was one.
She truly deserved to hit that 100 , but I can't help but think that she got the last laugh with all the celebrations being planned ... 😆 RIP Betty , you were truly Golden.
I like Betty White as Eunice's snooty sister Ellen.
RIP Ms. Betty White 🙇 Your legacy lives on. You are much loved & will be deeply missed. 👼😘♥️
This video had me tearing up. Betty White will truly be missed. Rest In Peace you absolute icon 💞
SIP Betty White aka Rose, you'll always be my favorite Golden Girl 🙏🏾❤
Beautiful brilliant huge loss lady rip 🦋🌷🙏the world    was    a better place with you in it but the memory you have left is even better thank you
She in a better place now she probably out lived everybody she knew so she back with them probably
RIP Betty. I became a fan when I watched  you on the Mary Tyler Moore show. Comedic Genius.
RIP Betty. What a legend she was. Dang, what a sad way to end 2021.
Easter Egg hunt!! lol! :)
The most talent lady ms.white been watching you every since was little girl truly will miss so when you get to were god take you keeeeeeeep laughhhhhhh  All the golden girls will be miss now you're up there rest cast members. God 🙌
I will love you forever, Betty! RIP
RIP legend 🙏
Just when the world needs humor more than ever - this wonderful being leaves us ...  There is a void left, that no one can fill !
What a wonderfully delightful tribute for our Nation's Queen😊  Sweetness, Beauty, Kindness, Humility, Funny + Sass = Pure Comedic Gold  May our Fav Golden Girl show out & have an amazing time in the afterlife. ALL HAIL, OUR NATION'S QUEEN 👸
What to say about this woman. She was an international treasure. That snickers ad never fails to make me crack up and the proposal is one of my favourite movies. Betty White's choice to never have children helped make me realise that it was not wrong for me to feel the same. She was a legend and a trailblazer. The world is a little greyer now that she's gone. She's left a huge hole in the industry that I don't believe will ever be filled. This one was a tough one. Rest in Peace Betty White you were one of a kind.
She will live on in so many things she did; she achieved immortality in movies, videos, etc!
I think the secret to her longevity was her attitude. Paradoxically, she knew that life is short, so arguing, criticizing, being mad and sad, and procrastinating would have been wasting it. She was a very mentally healthy lady, which is where she got that positive attitude and appetite for life.
I love this woman May her soul rest in enteral peace
I love you Betty I didn't even watch the parade today been watching golden girls reruns one of my favorite roles she did was in lake placid the world will be colder without her
Only one Betty- R.I.P. to a true comedy legend.
Betty was the comedic icon of each generation.she stayed relevant no matter how much comedy genres changed thru the years!rip Betty & thanks for the memories!🙌🙏
Thanks you for being a friend- Golden Girl Forever
RIP Betty White
She was a National Treasure.  We are better because of her, and the world is darker without her.
Shouldn’t forget when she was on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. As she used to do the craziest things because “she needed the cash.” If you haven’t seen those appearances, stop what you’re doing and look them up now!
My favorite Betty White moment was at the William Shatner roast (& George Takei was there).  She said, "We all know Shatner's nuts.....but Sulu over here has actually tasted them!"
Betty White belonged to the Unity Christian church.  That "church" teaches that people are inherently good.  The gospel states that we're all sinners.
She will be dearly missed! ❤️❤️❤️
Very very few stars hit me with such emotion, Betty's passing has me in tears.  She was such a Joy and Light and the World was a happier place with her in it.  R.I.P Betty you always be Loved and Remembered.
She's just moving on to better things.......RIP and thanks for all the laughs!!!
Y’all are absolute trash for monetizing someone’s death
Now I feel like watching the proposal again! Aww Betty
Felt like losing a family member, when hearing of Betty's passing. I have always adored her. Rest In Peace Betty. 💔🙏
Christophe 😘👍👍😇😇🙏🙏🙏😞😞🌹🌹🌹🌹
No mention of her role in Boston legal...sad cuz she was funny in that too
😍👀She's just as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. A truly stunning woman! You've made the world a better place! Thank you precious lady for all the wonderful memories.  You will be greatly missed. All our ❤  RIP🌹
America's lovable wacky grandmother who always brought a gift whenever she came to visit.   Betty will be missed by millions of viewers and left an impact on generations that'll never be forgotten.
Well her timing was impeccable at least. The entire world had a chance to raise a glass to her. RIP Betty White 😭
What an Amazing Lady She will truly be missed
Fell in love with her on the golden girls
Rest In Peace beautiful you are so loved
I’m so blessed to have lived while Betty white was born. Such a legend! Such a soulful woman! Rest Grandma Betty!
Betty was our Queen. She brought so much laughter to us. She will be deeply missed.
I have more respect for Betty White than probably anyone else on this entire planet.  RIP to an incredible human being.
Everybody loved Betty
The world is instantly a worse place with Betty gone.
God Bless You, Betty White!  God will be able to grab a few laughs with you being up there with him!   I hate that you left us, but I know you can still see how much we all love you and cherish you!  People will still be enjoying your sensational 🎭 acting a hundred years from now!  We will miss you something terrible!  Watch over us, Dear Betty!
Bless you Betty White thank you for the laughs you will be very missed! 🙏
Damn she gonna be missed so much. RIP Betty White you legend
My favorite Betty moment...on the MTM show...when Murray plopped her on top of a wedding cake.
-International-, not just national icon.
Icon❤️
Rip beautiful angel 😇 💔 😢
*Some people should live forever*
The Angels are blessed to escort her into heaven.  Kept her husband a long time waiting....no more.
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Betty White, I am so sad that you have left this world. Not only were you a great actress, you also helped and loved all animals. What a wonderful and kind person left us so unexpectedly. People and animals will miss you forever, you made the world a better place.  We love you!
she will always be my golden girl. she was always my favorite actress on the golden girls. this made me ugly cry badly. thanks for the upload
I liked her on The Golden Girls, Password, Mama's Family, SpongeBob SquarePants(Mall Girl Pearl), Betty White's Off Her Rocker, Match Game, Family Guy(Peterotica), The Simpsons(Missionary: Impossible), and her guest hosting WWE Raw. R.I.P. Betty, you will be missed
They never ever mentioned her having any kids and I never ever heard anything about her marriage to Alan Luden.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😭
She’s the best, class act.
🥺🥺 BETTY WHITE  IS A LEGEND.   We will miss you🙏
Rest in peace Betty its so sad that you didn't get to make it to your 100th birthday and you were a true legend.
Can we all agree when he uploads our day gets better 💥
Someone get this woman her coffee!!!!!!
RIP to a legend. The last golden girl to see the light of heaven and the face of god. Hope she sees the others golden girls there. Her legacy won't be discarded by covid or other world wide problems. She won't forgotten by the people that saw her work. R.I.P Betty White
I think her darling perfect dimples are what got her over.  Her deep sarcastic twist probably could have never flown otherwise.  LoveLight unto Betty White and all she loves always~ always✨💟✨
No matter race, creed, color, politics or sexual preference, we all come together in our love for Betty White.
I guess The Grim Reaper got his revenge on Betty White after she beat him in JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING! Get the reference R.I.P. BETTY WHITE
You did a Wonderful job!  Thank you for your professional work!  Bless Betty White!  She's finally home with her husband!
i was truly raised by betty white. growing up in a family where tv was the main scapegoat and was a huge way to avoid interacting with us kids , betty white was one of the stars that i always looked up to, praised and thought could never die… when she died a piece of me died with her
Rest In Peace Betty! We all love you so much you're everyone's grandmother!
I loved her as Rose in the golden girls and Caroline in the Hallmark Channel Original movie The Lost Valentine and in the movie Annie's Point
I guess The Grim Reaper got his revenge on Betty White after she beat him in JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING! Get the reference R.I.P. BETTY WHITE
I love Betty white so much RIP Legend I can’t believe she’s gone ❤️❤️
My favourite Betty white moment when she had guest appearances on TV show bones in season 10. She pretty funny.
Thank you for being a friend RIP Mrs.White much love ❤️🙏
idk how I feel about this video being monetized but RIP Betty White   She was golden
Miss and 💕 her!
how long did you think they had this in the drafts (but honestly what an icon)
Don't be sad guys! Now she knows the secret♥️
RIP Betty White! What a way to end a year, she will be truly missed but her legacy will live forever.
Thank you, Betty, for all the laughs you gave us. RIP, dear soul!
Thank you  Ms Mojo
RIP Betty White. You will be missed
She was wonderful.
Oh Betty, another for the road would have been nice.  RIP sweat lady of entertainment.
I’m so sad. I know Mr Ludden was waiting for her.
Wow Since I never watched TV, I missed a lot. Incredible woman and artist! What an amazing, lively human being!
She  will be missed
I will miss Betty white, she is the funnest and entertaining icon. When I heard about her passing I was so upset. Still am. But I will never forever her. I’ve had watched her movies and shows for a long time now. And when she played Rose Nylon on the golden girls. I knew she is my absolutely favorite one. And I love her saint olafs stories. Amazing. I will miss you Betty white. You will be missed.
I love your show but this one has got to be The Top Of Tops. Thank you for such a wonderful tribute to a beautiful woman. RIP MS.
I sure hope her dying on New year's eve doesn't foretell a horrible 2022
She was a gift from the heavens and made the world a better place. RIP Miss Betty White.
She was so iconic and she did everything! That woman was so much fun!
She was the best and still is the very best !!!
What an amazing gift she was. Just imagine the reunions happening with all those who left before her. An incredible life she lived. RIP
Love love love HER!! RIP Betty White.
And the Password is........ Heaven!  Hope you are reunited with Alan Ludden!  RIP and thank you for the laughs and support of Animals!
I fucking LOVE Betty!!🥰🥰🥰💚💚
Evil is very real and present in the world. The Bible tells us that we are all born with sin, and that even some of God's people are wolves in sheep's clothing. However, even as sinners we are still giving a conscience that helps us not give into evil urges. Feelings of shame and guilt are right emotions that guide us. Get out of the world, and worship Christ Jesus our Lord, for he died for you!
Grandma Norma in the Lorax was hilarious, I loved her.
We will miss you.   Betty  white  you were  beautiful  inside out. 🥺R.I. P
when she played on bones
Going to miss you Betty. I’m glad I was born in a time where I got to see and know who Betty white was.
She was one of a kind! She'll be forever missed. <3
Watching Golden Girls right now. THANK YOU BETTY FOR EXISTING.
Rest in Power Betty...
RIP
I loved her in "Lake Placid". "...if I had a dick this is where I'd say suck it" God Speed funny lady!
RIP
10:45 Who is this woman? I've seen her before.  .   .  .
Met her personally and lost my shit when I found she died, she and I had a few cups of tea and I enjoyed her company. I loved and will miss her quick wit and lovable nature as I have donated to all animal charities  in her honor.
An incredible talent, an incredible life, an incredible person and already incredibly missed. RIP.
RIP Betty ❤️ you were truly amazing and loved by so many. All i can say is thank you for the memories and rest easy ❤️
Betty was a sweet lady and brought so much joy and laughter to so many. She was a legend and will greatly missed.
Betty, your loved. Rip with Allen. We will miss u.
Legend .she had me crackin up in the golden girls .r.i.p Betty up in heaven doing golden girl returns lol 😂 hilarious show xx uk.
You forgot her role in, lake placid she was the one feeding the alligators. She was fantastic.
Pray for Betty because  she's probably not in heaven as your supposed to know your going to heaven not think it this is why were in the end times the world thinks it can reject God and his salvation, Jesus is the only way and if you don't repent to him and turn from sin your not allowed in heaven no matter how good you think you are:) FYI if you haven't accepted Jesus he's real not a religion You just go in a private place tell him you believe and tell him your sorry for what you think you did wrong; he will answer that prayer then start reading the bible and praying and God will tell you what to do
She will be missed RIP
" She was a great actress, comedian icon who was so amazingly gifted. Her long life journey was so profound. Her fan base was so rootly planted to where she would never ever be forgotten."
RIH Betty White!!!! We Love You
A life well lived.
She is so iconic
"My Condolences to the family."🌺🌹🌷
I wish I had her genes. She looks beautiful until her final days. I will always remember watching the golden girls with my family. She is truly a legend and will always be remembered til the end of time. RIP 🙏
The Queen of England could NEVER. 🤡💅🏿
RIP to a true legend.
She had found the fountain of youth, she never aged a single day. Respect.
This lady lived ten lifetimes in one go, what a gem!
Betty in lake placid was so funny
Dont know if I am ready to watch this! I loved you from afar! Rip Betty White, the world is now a much sadder place but hope your still bringing the laughs to heaven now xxx
She's back with Allen now. She never remarried because "once you've had the best, you don't need the rest." Rest in peace Betty. The greatest tv star of all time.
She's an absolute blessing and joy to watch...  I'm sure she's making God an everyone in heaven laugh out loud!
May her soul rest
Wonderful tribute. As we say in Jamaica "Walk good Ms Betty"
Not many people can say they made the world a better place. Betty could.
The last Golden girl ....has gone home to join the others .....she lived a good life ...rest easy Betty
Rip Betty ❤️
It's ironic, if Betty had passed away 3 or 4 years ago instead of yesterday, I would still have been sad, because she was a wonderful woman who was loved by almost everyone and the world was just a brighter place with her in it, but I would have been able to say "At least she lived until her 90s, had a long and wonderful life and was vital and had good health until the end" So yes,  I'd be sad, but I probably wouldn't feel gutted . Now though even though all those things about her are still true, the fact that she died the last day of the year, only weeks away from her 100th birthday, does make me feel gutted and somewhat broken hearted. I am still grateful that she lived for so long, but I do so wish she could have seen 100. RIP Betty.
She spanned in the movie industry for over 8 Decades PBS
What about the 'flirty' side of Sue Ann Nivens....hilarious!
I hope that Betty White can see all the love in these comments. Iconic, Legendary what an amazing wonderful person she was. She is missed by so many. We were so fortunate to have her in our lives. Rest in Peace Betty heaven has gained an angel. 😢💖
"sitting in the back of a limo eating cheesecake with Betty White"  Goals  Clearly God is revamping his entry routine
I feel bad that she never reached 100
Every moment with Betty White was a great moment. 💖 Love her 💖
Great lady, super funny RIP Betty
Congratulations on being a good person. RIP
BAD ASS MAN
It’s okay guys, we know that she’s just having cheesecake with her Golden Girls.  Rest In Peace, dear Betty White. Thank you for being a friend.
EVERYBODY loves Betty! Rest in Paradise to a beautiful soul🙏🏽
7:50 That made me crack up🤣😂
They was just waiting to drop this vid. Kinda fucking gross
Lake Placid… she called that cop “officer f@ck meat”.
Spirit never dies . RIP
Just a day into the new year ....Ooo death, why couldnt you just wait for one more day !!!
This made me laugh and cry at the same time! R.I.P Betty White. You are truly missed!🥰
I really thought she was immortal😔 beautiful, sweet, funny lady…. RIP Betty💝🙏🏻🌹
Poor Betty White. I first knew her as Granny Norma from The Lorax.
Just 20?
Rest In Peace Miss Betty White. I’ve loved you all my life. I’ve seen every single Golden girls episode.
You can't just pick one Betty White moment as a favorite.  She is classy, sasy, funny. A true talent. I love everything she did. She is Blanche Devaro instead of Rose Nilen.
Betty was a real trooper great actress comedian she will be sorely missed she won't want to r I p she will get all her family and friends together and have a great party God bless you Betty for all the laughs you gave us xxxxxx
OMG! Love her! 😂
This made me cry, 2021 really ended the year with a middle finger.
Loved her in The Proposal. We lost a great lady. Betty White will be missed.
Rip Betty white
Betty white is an example  of a life well lived.  Always  sunny 🌞
Betty is The Man!!!
RIP Betty White. I miss you. I still watch Golden Girls.
Anything she's was in oxo
She is a Charming One.   rio.  rip.  (she prob. been to rio.).  rip.  Rest in peace.  go   BETTY WHITE.!❤❤❤.
rest in peace Betty white 💞
This channel is just like WatchMojo and they both suck.
Why do people say grow some balls? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding.'
RIP Ms. White. You'll be miss.
With her death she will cleanse the world of COVID!
Everyone needs to be more like betty. She loved Everyone.  Never had a bad thing to say about anyone,  even if someone didn't like her.
So basically, most of her roles were like "it should've been a one time appearance, but since she was such a hit, the producers let her have the main role."  The definition of a LEGEND!
Lake Placid, loved her
We’re still gonna celebrate her 100th on January 17th, 2022.
when she was asked if there was something she hadnt done immediately  without skipping a beat she says robert redford i hope she got her date with robert
I believe Betty chose her time to check out, it was her time. She accomplished everything a human could in a lifetime and then some. Everyone loves her, no matter what age they are. Rose Nylund was my favorite character Betty played, she was hilarious. RIP Betty, you are loved forever.
I had a fantastic New Years Eve with my fiancé, but this still is totally breaking my heart 💔
The world felt her death on New Year's Eve.  Not too many people have that gift.  So glad this video added the Snicker's commercial and the movie The Proposal.   After 80 years of being in front of the camera, Betty White lives on for many generations to enjoy.  There needs to be more Betty's in this world.  That should be her legacy.
I don't think I've ever been legitimately sad that a celebrity has died. I'm pretty sad today. That lady was comedy gold! There will probably never be another Betty White!
Goodbye sweet & funny Lady !
What - no mention of Betty White in her gut-busting role in "Bringing Down the House" (with Steve Martin and Queen Latifah) as the nosy and bigoted neighbor Mrs Kline? OMG - when she burst into the house, sees Latifah on top of Steve on the couch and screams "MANDINGO!" I swear I tore something inside my gizzards laughing so hard. Who else on earth could have gotten away with the nasty bigoty lines she had in that film without getting cancel-cultured from here to eternity? But it was Betty and nobody made a peep. She had a bit part & stole the whole film!
Okay yeah I teared up.
I still can't believe she's gone. None of us will be able to get over her sudden passing, rest in peace our sweet Golden Girl.
RIP. I have a proposal, let's celebrate her 100th birthday as a celebration of life. It's better to remember people like her that has done so much good for the industry and us fans for entertainment over so many years. Lord bless and prayers to the family, friends, and fans.
Betty always reminded my of my Grandma. White hair bright red lip stick and was just so classy she could make the raunchiest and trashy things sound eloquent.
Rip Betty heaven is having a big star now
RIP
Oh dear...may she rest in power betty white was such a great actress what a horrible to end off the year of 2021 this is just sad she is such an great legend 🙏🏾 💔 you will be missed within our hearts 💕 💞 💔 😢 💙 she would've made it to her 100th birthday I teared up soo much after watching this.
She lived as a legend and passed as one, days away from her birthday and on the last day of the year she will be missed
RIP 🙏🙏
Wft is the worst way to tarnish the best Woman in show biz to throw a racial triggering term such as "black" to describe a man who deserves respect from all of you!!!!
I can't find it in Youtube, but her "playful" comments with Johnny Carson (very roughly 1980) about a small toy tiger who did wonderful things when you twisted its tail - the off-colorness of it was fantastic.
Rip to our last Golden Girl 🥺🙏🏻
She was amazing!
A TRUE QUEEN WILL BE MISSED🙏🏽❤️
LEGEND.
R.I.P Betty white ❤😟
May she Rest in Peace Eternally. My sincerest condolences to all her loved ones.
Only this lady would make me watch, like and comment on Mojo's vids. Thanks for sharing so many years with us, Ms Betty.
Betty White's first words waking up in heaven: 21:56
Betty and Bishop Tutu, walking through the pearly gates hand in hand both laughing...
Thank you for posting your tribute to the incomparable Betty White. She was an amazing talent, but never came across as anything other than gracious, witty and always ready to give us her best - and, in her case, it was more than we could ever have hoped to see. Thank you, again.
Why do you have to explain everything. People know all these clips.
Artista magnifica ❤️🙏
I still can’t believe Betty passed. R.I.P. Betty White. 🙏🏿
Betty White… Thank you for being everyone’s friend!
Pls this isn’t not something we needed honestly a legend like her to pass 😢 she just had this thing to her that seemed as if she could live forever she’ll be missed dearly I can’t even fully come to terms that she has died 🥺😔 RIP to this amazing legend
I got a teary eye😢
MISS BETTY WHITE, YOU WERE THE GOLDEN GIRL. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING A SMILE ON MY FACE, EVERYTIME I WATCH GOLDEN GIRLS. R.I.P. MISS GOLD 🙏
What a good very moment for Betty white to share this story about her life moments we all miss you Betty and I hope you in a good place 💙 ❤ 😊😇
Betty White deserved to live forever if she wanted too.  She gave so much (naturally).  We all will miss her and never forget.  Rest in Peace.
R.I.P to the queen of Television ❤️
Rest In Peace
May she rest in peace
The world lost a ray of light when Betty White left us. You will be greatly missed, and I bet you’re causing all the laughter up in Heaven now.
Funny moment from Hot in Cleveland. Betty comes in from a date: Betty: Well, we broke up. He doesn't like to go . . . well . . . "downtown." The other girls look at each other with "OMG, that is TMI." Betty: Yes, he doesn't like the traffic, the noise...."
Such an amazing person
She was a sell-out!
didnt the lady said she was feeling fine? what the hell happened. tripping over the finish line.
I cried when I heard what happened, she was my favorite TV star and I always wanted to meet her but that's not going to happen.
Betty White sure had a full life didn't she ?  RIP ole friend.  You'll be missed
This just made me tear up. I love what Ryan Reynolds said, I think it’s spot on,   “The world looks different now. She was great at defying expectation. She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty. Now you know the secret.” 😢❤️
rip betty we will forever speak ur name xo    golden girls has always been my favorite show
I Loved Betty White in everything but especially Hot in Cleveland
Loved her greatly, RIP Betty X
All of her moments are my favorite. ❤️😍
What an amazing life and career! Almost 100 years somehow still wasn’t enough. Rest well, Betty. You are so loved 🥰
*R.I.P. BETTY WHITE !!! YOU WILL BE MISSED!!!!! ☹*
She was so awesome, so sweet, so funny and smart. We really lost an Icon
Pay the editors and donate the rest of the money to animals! It's what Betty would've wanted! RIP this is unbelievable!
JINX doesnt exsist for me, but everyone was so anxious, 100, 100, 100, well, Betty, 99 on Silvesterabend is SO COOL !!! We will always love You! Posa in Pace :( <3
Celebrate the life of this treasure she will be missed
Great person and actor. Will be missed
Tan cerca, y a la vez tan lejos del centenario. Una gran pérdida para el mundo del entretenimiento.  Descansa en paz.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I refuse to believe!
Such a talent.... Such a loss ....😢
Let's all agree that we were all fortunate enough to exist in the same time as Betty White. A legend in the truest sense of the word.
I genuinely cried when I heard she had passed. She was all of our adoptive grandma and an inspiration. We should all live by her example. Rest in peace, Betty. You will be dearly missed.
She was awesome in Lake Placid
We lost someone special 😔 Thanx for all the laughs 🥴 R.I.P
RIP. A true icon that will be missed!
99 years … power, fun, ….     RIP Rose … have some cheesecake with the three other girls 😘😘😘
RIP sweet, funny lady!
Superbowl snickers commercial  RIP Queen Betty.
One of my favorite moment: she whacked her little boy friend with a frying pan in Boston Legal.
The Golden Girls were sorta an accidental replacement for my atrocious biological mother. I remember it being offered as an option for something to watch when I was in the hospital at about 5 years old, and at the time...I thought it was gonna be a superhero cartoon. I was half right, those legendary women helped develop the man I am today, I know that sounds ridiculous but when it is a choice between abusive drug addict or 4 nutty older ladies who, as it turns out were just as wonderful in real life. The choice was easy. So, when Betty White left us, the world got a little colder and darker for me. If it had that impact on me, I can only imagine the impact this had on those who were a part of her everyday life. For these reasons, I mourn the death of fun.  On the upside, she probably got the last laugh. And if anyone could plan and deliver a joke like this, it would be her. So, instead of letting it keep me down, I am gonna go on doing what she spent her whole life putting out in the world. Positivity, smiles and laughter!  We will miss you, Betty. Thank you for making this world bearable!
Betty ❤️
She was already 50 years old when my mother was born. She turns 50 in February. Wow.
What a lovely down to earth funny lady she was. RIP Betty. You will be missed. ❤❤
Anything she did I loved.
She was the most beautiful & marvelous person in the world and I miss the laughter Betty White R.I.P.
"I've always liked older men. They’re just more attractive to me. Of course, at my age there aren’t many left!” Betty White   You have enchanted the world with your wit and charm. We will not forget you
Its hard to believe that she is not alive anymore 😢 RIP Betty White
Farewell Darling Lady, you will always be in our hearts!
I hope she was sleeping & it was peaceful when she dropped her body. Congratulations, Betty White!
Number 6, performing for Morgan Freeman will always be my favorite memory of this wonderful human being!
Thank you so very much for posting this I am 75 so Betty has been a part of my movie and tv life for so many years. RIP beautiful lady keep those Angels laughing.
Wow, what a woman what a life. You will be so missed!
You can see the love in Morgan freeman’s eyes. She was a great person and you can see how much of an impact she had on her friends and everyone around her. You will be missed Betty! ❤️
The minute I heard she died I texted my daughter and said….damnit, Betty White died.  I just didn’t want her to go.
Absolutely love Betty White - she is awesome and will be much missed.
Of all the words I can find my gut says; Betty would be honored by this and while she will be missed she’s still that White spot that brings people together for she will always be remembered as The First Woman of Television.
she was and is the GOAT and a LEGEND in her own right. She lived her life to the fullest.
Everything she does.
damn, y’all were quick
We love you Betty
I hadn't realized how much I needed her to be in this world, happy and working on the things she loved  I always wished I had her as my mother. So adorable.
I liked her performance in Toy story 4 and the Lorax I Will miss her

Thank you for being a friend 💛
Jan. 17th 1922- Dec. 31st 2021 We lost a legend
She will be greatly missed, just like Robin Williams. Now they are together looking over us from heaven. RIP Betty 🪔
All of them
What a loss, she seemed to like everyone who was genuinely a good person, she loved animals, and she was willing to laugh at herself.
RIP Betty White. What an amazing person. An amazing actress. I feel as if the world lost a kickass grandmother. I can only imagine she is talking about memories with: Rue, Estelle, and Bea over cheesecake or ziti. She’ll be dearly missed.
RIP ... What ? .  People who once lived just like you ... Now are gone ... They're Livelihood too .  You Praised them while they lived on Earth ... Now no more ... They're wrapped in girth .  You see ... God breathed into us the Breath of Life ... Death is Not the end ... We have Eternity in sight .  Heaven or Hell will be your Forever home ...  Have you called upon Christ and made him your own ? .  Some will say : " I Don't Believe ! " ... The Devil replies : " Good ! " ... " Its you I Deceive ! " .  "Follow in their footsteps and you'll be mine " ... " Burning without Mercy ... In ... but a short time " .  There is someone I know who can prevent all this ... He Conquered Sin , Death , the Grave ... And the Suffering Abyss .  Jesus Christ the Messiah ... The Son of God ... He is the Word made Flesh ... No one Higher ! .  Who shed his Blood to Save your Soul ... To Keep you from an Eternity in Deaths Dark Hold .  Know the Prince of Peace ... and You'll REST IN PEACE ... Experience a Love that will Never Never Cease ! .  By Andrew K   ( Please Read and Believe the Gospel of John in the New Testament )   I Wish you Well ! .
May her memory always be a blessing
Best scene ever - when Lois (from Malcolm I'm the Middle) discovers she has a half-sister in Canada and her half-sister's mother is none other than Betty White.  As Lois drops by their Canadian home, unannounced, Betty opens the door, utilizing full on passive-aggressive charm while Anne Murray's 'Snowbird' plays in the background.  Second only to Robin Williams marching about singing 'Blame Canada'.
This woman was angel in life, I have no doubt just as she will continue being a friend in all of our hearts, in the next life she will also continue being an angel. She truly gave us the biggest gift at the party of life and I am moved to tears by her passing but I know she will be remembered always!
No mention of Lake Placid?!  You’re killing me smalls!
Well done, WM, your best vid yet!
Think we are going to be in shock very soon!
Allways my Favorit from golden girls
With everything happened in the world, Betty's death is the worst :-(
My favorite Betty White moment has to be when she was on The Golden Girls.
My favorite Betty White moment has to be when she was on The Golden Girls.
Betty White was an anomaly of a public figure. With the great political divide we face in this age there's virtually no one that both sides have admiration for, Betty White was an exception to this and we've truly lost an icon
Such an Icon ♥️ Rest In Peace Mrs. Berry White 🕊️ Well made video Mojo 👍🤗
This was quick.....what did they do prepare this before she actually died ?
Rest In Peace Betty White January 17, 1922-December 31, 2021
Rest In Peace Betty White January 17, 1922-December 31, 2021
Rip Betty White,a sunshine and my favourite actress🧡😥
Such a talented woman!!!! So sad we lost her. ♥️♥️♥️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The Golden girls show
She was an iconic figure and super funny,love her always from Laredo,Texas ❤🙏
Betty, Betty, Betty why'd you have to go.
As always, Watchmojo (and their subsidiaries) can't wait a milisecond before cashing in on the popularity of a recently-deceased actress. I hope that this video really was made for her birthday and was just published today, because if it was made in advance for her death, that makes it so much worse. Disgusting.
I miss her so much
We Will miss you ROSE
I loved Betty White on Match Game
Sorely missed already.  RIP
RIP Betty White ! You are amazing, beautiful, loved and cared so much by so many. You truly are a Legend, we will ALL miss you tons ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. I hope and pray you found Allen again and you are dancing with him. Love you Forever and always Betty. You will NEVER be forgotten
The St Oliph stories!
Rest in peace Betty
She was everyone's fun zany crazy grandma, aunt, sister, and mentor.  Heaven gained a great person.  We lost our laughter today.
Betty White is now with Rue Mcclanahan, Estelle Getty and Bea Arthur in Heaven. Sitting down, at the dinner table, eating a good cheesecake, catching up on what happened down here.
She was true class from beginning to the end, rest in peace sweet lady❣😇🐾🌈🕊💋
What a life well lived. Not just her career but her tolerance and compassion for people and animals. Anytime I hear the excuse for intolerance that someone is “just from a different generation”, I think of Betty White (and my own grandmother) and well that’s really not a good excuse, is it? What a lovely person. Although I’m just a fan, I’m feeling a little heartbroken like I’ve lost my own grandma again. RIP Betty, and well played.
RIP  Betty.....You brought sunshine into my life  many times....I hope you are with the one that brought sunshine into yours....ALLEN
Sandra Bullock expressed grief over the death of legendry actor Betty White who passed away on 31st December at the age of 99.  During her conversation with People, the Ocean's 8 actor expressed that she is going to step in the New Year with loevely memories of the late actor.  She said, “I don't drink vodka... but I will tonight, on ice, with a slice of lemon and a hot dog on the other side, and just be okay being sad. I'll have to buy some rose-colored glasses because Betty was that for all of us.”  Recalling her 2009 The Proposal co-star, the Bird Box actor gushed over White’s remarkable talent.  She opened up, “Timing isn't easy in comedy, because you have to navigate other people's timing. Betty pivots like I have never seen, making it look seamless,"  "The rest of us just remain silent and pray we're not cut out of the scene," she added.  See Adam alert
I ❤️Betty White 😢 What a kick in the nuts way to end 2021 💔RIP Betty 😞💙
You missed one of the funniest appearances on St. Elsewhere that proves Betty and her iconic character Sueanne Nivies (Mary Tyler Moore Show) have become part of our cultural lexicon.  Betty had a supporting role as a doctor on the hit show St. Elsewhere.  In here first appearance in the series, in one scene where she has joined the hospital team, she is walking with other doctors down a corridor, discussing a medical procedure when a man at the end of the corridor sees the group of doctors; the man runs up to the group grabs Betty White's hand and excitedly says, Sueanne....Sueanne Nivins.  To which Betty says, "No, I am sorry, you must have me confused with someone else."  The man insists, "No, I am sure, you are Sueanne Nivins, the Happy Home-maker."  Two orderlies run up to the man and forcibly escort the man away, all they while with him yelling, It's Sueanne Nivins, the Happy Home-maker!"   One of the other doctors in the group says to Betty, "Oh, I am sorry doctor, that is one of our mental patience who excaped from the other wind."    The only reason the writers of that show could get away with such a direct reference to a character in another show and it make any sense was if the character of Sueanne Nivins the Happy Home-maker was universally known and more importantly, loved by the public -- a testament to how Betty imbued the character with like-ability.
Betty White is everybody's Grandma!!!😆
smh u money hungry vultures. mfs were quick to make this one. why cant yall drop before the ppl die
I cried this whole video. I miss her
She’s the example people need for elderly people this woman was like 99 acting like she was in her 40s
Rest easy Betty White! Thanks for the laughs!!
We love you Betty, See you soon!
Fairwell great lady. Your 100 years on this planet were one of the best centuries we ever had. May your travels in the beyonf be just as memorable
She was a mother to me, to keep me going. She let me know no matter how old you are, you still can make it in life. I know the Lotd jas a place waiting just for her. Betty get your rest baby I love yoi.
So, question,  she was a wonderful person,  woman, philanthropist,  smiling all the time! I'm a nurse, so where do you guys think her soul went when she took her last breath in her sleep?? I really sincerely hope she is in heaven!!! I just can't hardly imagine such a sweet person in hell!!
Shes gotta have the longest stretch of being working WORKING actor for 60 or so years has to be the longest in the industry. She found a Niche to carve out for herself. Young actors should really look at her career and study how she handled it. Everybody wants to be a mega star but most burn bright for a lil while then just fade away when the goal should be to be good enough to keep getting jobs. Most of all she earned the respect of every single person she ever worked with
RIP Betty White! May you be always remembered in everyone’s heart.❤️
RIP Betty. Why does Betty have a black eye on Jimmy Kimmel ? 20:58 look at her face.
The SNL sketch where she talks about her dry muffins has been living in my head rent free for the last eleven years
RIP Betty. she was such a gem. she knew how much everyone adored her and used it to be a better entertainer.
Rip Golden girl I only hoped you would see this year.
No to Mojo yes to Betty White.
#15 (5:45) should have been #1. She took a risky stand (that got her show cancelled) in a serious moral issue. It was 1954 and she responded to racist southern tv stations with a metaphorical big middle finger. That might be the single most important thing she ever did, as great as her career was.
You guys had this prepared way to fast ! Had this on the back burner didn’t you ?
2022 is going to be a little bit dimmer without Betty White in the world :( RIP Legend!
Love and peace from a loyal loving fan of Betty all the way from across the globe, Muscat in Oman 🇴🇲♥️❤️ may she rest in peace 🙏🏻😇, she will forever be in our hearts and thoughts ❤️♥️
The world will not be the same without you.Never thought you would be gone someday.God bless you Betty
what a lady out in her pure fingertips , great entertainer , may she rest in peace .
I’m hurt. I’m hurting over this.
Betty White was a true icon and legend! She inspired multiple generations and will truly be missed. I watch The Golden Girls every single day (thanks to Hulu) and had to explain to my daughter (8 years old) that she passed away, that’s how relevant she still was. She lived a long life and now may she rest peacefully.
She will be missed. Thanks for all the laughs. RIP Betty White, we love you.
This was wonderful. Thank you
Rest in Peace Betty, I hope she finds her way in a kitchen with Bea, Estelle and Rue waiting for her with a plate of cheesecake and an endless happy conversation about a life well lived
Thank you for everything Betty. What a life you lived! Love you forever!
Thanks for being a good friend ❤️
SEVEN DECADES in show business...WOW.
I'm going to London   Rose ,,London England   No rose London France   I've been repeating that since a teen after watching it on golden girls and I still laugh at it today
this was great fun. I was only 2 when she had her first filming!!!!
Video is made unbearable by the endless commentary. Can I just see the moments, please?
RIP
I don't know what to say... Betty meant so much to me. She made me smile when hardly anything else could. She was so pure and honest. She had values, which she was vocal about. I think there are so many lessons to be learned from her!   I wished, she would have been able to celebrate her 100th birthday, but I'm sure Betty was living her best life nonetheless!  My thoughts are with her family and friends. Now she is reunited with Bea, Rue, and Estelle. Forever golden.
I’m devastated. 😔😭
I wish the narrator didn't talk so fucking much. For the love of gawd
RIP to the queen of queens 💔
You broke all the Hollywood barriers and forged the road for all female actors. Bravo 👏
Omg just learning about this sad news now. Betty White was such an amazing and talented performer and at 99 years of age that expands through multiple generations, she graces us with her legendary performances. Betty will be missed but we got so many great moments from her over her amazing career, thank you for going over many of those times MsMojo.
Her part in Lake placid still keeps me laughing.. "if i had a d&ck this is where i would tell you to suck it"
World just got a little colder.
Her mind was crystal clear right up until she drifted off to sleep & into eternity.  An amazing talented woman. Bless you Miss White.
R.I.P. Betty White. I've just finished watching the golden girls and then this happens. You'll always be remember. An amazing person with an amazing talent. Now the golden girls are back together ❤️
I don't remember who was interviewing Betty when she was asked if there was anything she hasn't done that she would still like to do. Her answer caught me so off guard (She was good at that!). Without missing a beat, she replied. "Robert Redford!"
I loved her in the Snickers commercial
Love the witch lady in My Name's Earl
Betty was a very humble person. She knew that if it wasn’t for her fans she would’ve been nothing some thing that a lot of Hollywood people seem to forget nowadays
That Super Bowl Snickers commercial is by far one of my favorite moments by her. Finding out she passed so close to her 100th Birthday hurt so much. She is such a nice and sweet person and a true treasure. I am going to miss her so much. RIP
What will the world be like without our Betty White.....Dull Dull Dull ! ! ! RIP Miss Betty......Thank You for all the laughter you gave us ! ! ! Your legacy will live on ! ! !
I just cried my eyes out for 24 minutes.  Rest in peace, Betty. You were, and still are, so loved.
No Boston Legal ⁉️‼️
What an icon
She was a very special lady. R I P. I've been entertained by her for years
Oh Betty, you will be so sorely missed. Thank you for making us laugh. Thank you for speaking up for animals & the misunderstood humans. Thank you for just being you. I don't know that I've ever really cried over the death of a celebrity before, but I have sure shed a lot of tears after hearing of her passing. RIP Betty. We all love you so much. Thank you for being our friend. ❤️😭❤️😭❤️
Your commentator talking over Betty White ruins the moments that you’ve taken the time to highlight.
Thank you for being a friend, Betty. 😩❤️
RIP to a TV Legend Betty White.🙏
Watched every Golden Girls episode🤗
The Golden Girls are all back together again RIP to a wonderful lady she will be so missed 🕊
I guess canceling her show because of Arthur Duncan won’t get called Cancel Culture because conservatives were behind it ... and it’s not Cancel Culture when conservatives do it ... even when they are literally canceling something.
Betty White was a worldwide gem that we were beyond blessed to have with us for so long 💖💖 Rest is peace, you absolute queen and legend. You will ALWAYS be adored!
It’s crazy how dying at 99 is still “too soon”  RIP to a legend ❤️
Betty White was one of the few performers who had the talent, girth, and charisma to stay in the show bis into her golden years.
She reminds me of a female Don Rickles. Old school comedian that wasn’t scared to push the boundaries. Insulting people in the nicest possible way, she didn’t have a bad bone in her body. May she live forever in Hollywood history. RIP our national treasure 😢❤️
It sounds so trite, but all I can think is that the world will never see another, or an equal to Betty White.
All Of The Above  RIP Ms. Betty White
So much great information and video footage from across the decades. It's an insightful tribute and wonderful trek down memory lane, which shows how she was such a powerhouse and smart woman, who only played the opposite, because she was always in on the joke, and willing to play for a laugh decade after decade after decade.  Truly incredible.💖
I don't think any human that dies with millions in the bank ($75 million in Ms. White's case) while children have been dying of starvation and thirst (her whole life) should be viewed as anything but a self-serving sociopath. Ms. White could be funny, poised, beautiful, and had a great wink... too bad that doesn't make someone a good person but rather in this case just an actor/comedian looking for a paycheck. RIP Ms. White and I wish you could have been a better human.
I love her in Lake Placid, too. Planning on raising a glass (or three) — vodka, I guess — to Betty White on January 17th, in honor of her centennial. Join me, won’t you?
This one got me. She's been a part of MY TV life all my life and losing her just hit hard. What a legend, what an activist for animals and what a funny lady.  RIP Betty 🙏
Thank you for being a friend! The world need now a good Saint Olaf story...
Repent the day of the Lord is at hand! Escape the wrath that is to come!! Did you know the bible says most people are going to Hell? There is a narrow road to get to Heaven and very few find it? Why is this? Because we are dead in trespasses and unable to have full revelation of the bible and God’s will for our lives. We need the merciful gift from God of regeneration. This is where God brings us to life and leads us to repentance and the turning away from a life of sin and leads us to accept him as our Lord and Savior. We become servants of Christ rather than slaves of sin. The bible says unless a man be born again he will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The bible says we must examine ourselves to be sure we are in the faith! Is your eternity assured? Have you been reborn from above? I pray today that you will ask the Holy Spirit to regenerate you, teach you his word, and lead you to him if he hasn’t already.  Titus 3:5 - Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Matthew 19:28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.  If you continue in my word you are my disciple indeed Give thanks in everything for this is the will of God concerning you I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints
Legend in every sense of the word, may she Rest in Peace. Thank you for entertaining the world for the past 80 years Betty! <3
What a wonderful woman. Loved all her shows. I will miss you.
Betty was truly a class act! She opened the door for so many people of all races and remained humble until the end. I know that she is smiling down from heaven. She is finally reunited with her beloved husband! What a beautiful life! Rest in heaven sweet lady.
R.I.P Betty White. You will always be missed!
You are a true legend Betty White & you opened the door for many!
What an outstanding compilation, Ms. Mojo -- probably your best ever.  Of course, when Betty White is your subject, it would be hard to go wrong.  Thank you for publishing this heartfelt tribute, now, when we need it the most.  The First Lady of Television has taken her final bow.  😢🙏❤
At last, all the Golden Girls are reunited! R.I.P. Betty, you will be missed dearly!
There’s no reason to be sad because we were graced with your presence in the past as of now and she’ll be an icon in the future as well. She never will go away. It’s just not possible
An Angel on Earth,now an Angel in Heaven .🌹

She was special. Forward thinking.  Rest well Betty Whit< you have earned your wings.
Its sad that she died merely a few weeks away from reaching 100. RIP Betty White

I grew up watching Betty on the golden girls.she was the real deal.
RIP Betty I am so devastated about her loss and can't believe she gone. 😪 She will always be missed and loved. I hope they still thow big birthday bash in her memory.
Where is the sandwich lady from Boston Legal?
Worst start to the new year ever.  She was a vibrant, lovable, animal advocate, funny and beautiful woman.  It just isn't fair that we lost her.  I truly hate that she's gone from our physical realm.  Thank you Betty for everything!
The world is just a little dimmer with Miss Betty gone...a true comedy legend
As I watched this, I was cracking up and weeping at the same time. She's kinda like the grandma we never had. R.I.P. Betty. We love you.
🤍of men are cold in the last days🖤, turn now❗for what is the deal if you gain the whole world but still lose your own soul..⌚💉🧬☠just like in the days of Noah God will judge the world⌛wake up‼the bride of christ will only lissen to  jesus voice they never Lissen to men Above GOD~
I liked the Date with the Angels episode with Dennis Day where I first heard her sing.
RIP  Miss White you were the GOAT and will be missed . You were just 17 days away form your 100 birthdate.
Did they skip boston legal?  Seems like a big oversight
Rest in Peace ❤
ANY SINGLE appearance of BW is worthy of ANY Top list. Without her, this World is a bit darker... And we really did not need it to be, right now.
Rest In Peace Betty. you will be the sweetest golden girl
What a legacy! Imagine knowing everyone on earth loves you. Wow! RIP Betty. 🙏🏻
She did time it well, on the night the entire world would have fireworks. It's like she wanted to go with a bang! Love this woman, always have, always will, wherever she is.
We didn't just lose a Hollywood and Television Legend, America and the world lost an outstanding woman and human being. Thank You Betty for enriching our lives and our very soul. ❤
RIP Golden Girl!
When much of your top 20 moments are individual careers for most, you did it big. What a woman! 👏
Rip to my favorite golden girl of all time Betty white you will be missed
really love her RIP Betty
Thank you Betty, for creating everlasting laughter for all of us...
Betty White was simply amazing.

20 reminders of why we were blessed to be on this planet with Betty White!
Betty White has been in our lives from the golden yrs to Gen Z she is not just an actress she is family.  ❤️
RIP Betty.  Make God laugh.  You could do it.
Great job, Betty was a treasure. We will miss you Betty. This is one person I know will go to heaven. 🌹❤️🌟
😢 RIP betty white 😢
There will never be another that ever comes close to Betty White's beauty, humor, humility, dignity, and grace. She was truly one of a kind and we are all blessed to have had her entertain us for all these years.
Rest In Peace to this amazing human. 😔😟
I’m still in shock. RIO beautiful lady!
No Boston legal. no that 70 show. Come on mojo.
What a gift she was to us all! Thank you.
I just loved that lady!
Strange.  One person gets such massive love, even worship ---Just for being in TV.    I know people who give all they have. , Take care of granddchildren every day, service persons who worked in hospitals this season.... and receive no attention. We need to give all earth beings Love and compassion . 7 billion of us.
I'm not crying, you're crying!
She is a beautiful soul 💖.  Rest in peace Betty.  Prayers to her family, friends, colleagues and fans.  May she be always be remembered
She Was A Legend In Her Own Time
Betty was truly a national treasure! ❤️
They'll never be another like her again.
Around 1970, Betty had a show called “The Pet Set,” produced by Allen Ludden and sponsored by Carnation, where I worked as a young secretary.  What a gracious couple.
Rest in peace Betty White the legend!
She is the epitome of cool
This was wonderful.  Thank you
Beautiful lady RIP...Betty will be missed by many...
This made me tear up knowing how much joy the world has lost. Bye Betty we loved you
RIP may you live on for generations in our hearts and your shows and movies. An absolute legend.
R.I.P. Betty White
I believe we now know whose likeness should replace the confederate monuments.
R.I.P.
2021 had to kick us all in the ass one more time huh? My family used to joke that Betty White was immortal and that she isnt allowed to die because people love her too much. Unfortunately we’re all human, but she was an extraordinary one! RIP
Her role as Catherine Piper on The Practice and then Boston Legal was spectacular!
I didn’t find out about her death till this morning ( I’m on the east coast) she was one of my favorites. I especially loved the character she played on the golden girls.
I liked her show a few years back when she and other seniors were pranking people! I also liked her in Golden Girls in her ditzy role as Rose Nylund. I will remember the quirky "Back-in-Saint-Olaf" stories!
She's simply an amazing human being, many people cried of her passing. Rest in love in Heaven, good woman. You'll be missed by many.
I'm convinced Morgan freeman gone out live errybody on da Plante thnks 2 da cdc
The Golden Girls are officially reunite in heaven
R.I.P Betty you will always be my Golden Girl... This video just made me even love her hundred times I love everything about her...

Sad to see you go Betty. You were truly an ICON. A friend to both 2 legged and four legged mammals. ❤💋
RIP MY SWEET LADY ❤️ YOU ARE GOING TO BE MESSED . I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU YOUR AN AMAZING LADY.
I really miss her
Only a true MONSTER would give this a 👎Dislike  RIP Betty White  hope you are with the rest of your Golden Girls costar’s but most of all each of your pets and animals that you have touched in their lives
the last of the Golden Girls has re joined her friends again.
RIP Betty White.  I loved watching you all these years.  You were America's grandma and we love you!
RIP .. you had given everybody joined for a long long time... especially The Golden girl
I was looking forward to her birthday celebration like it was mine. She lived a full life and impacted so many lives. We were truly blessed to have her in this lifetime. #RIPBettyWhite you fulfilled your purpose.
Say hello to everyone on Match Game and everyone on the Mary Tyler Moore Show.
Betty White was truly a legend. She will forever live on in our hearts
Thank you for being a friend to all of us Betty. You will be miss.
Betty White was such an inspiration , showing us all that getting older can be a lot of fun . RIP Miss White.
Dr. Ashley: Rose, what do you think of Blanche saying these things? Rose: I think she's a garconanokin. Dr. Ashley: Well, what exactly does that mean? Rose: Literally, it's the precise moment when dog doo turns white. But in general, it refers to the kind of person you don't wanna share your hoogencoggles with. Dorothy: Rose, if you say one more of those stupid words, so help me- Rose: Oh, blow it out your tubenburbles!
We’re going to miss you Betty!! Say hi to the other golden girls for me♥️♥️
I loved her on Mary Tyler Moore…she played SUCH a bitch.  And playing Rose Nylund…I don’t know how she kept a straight face.  I about died when I heard her swearing her ass off in Lake Placid.  Betty was just the best.
Didn’t know I’d feel so sad after her passing. She’s just always been there making me laugh through my life. There’ll never be another. RIP Betty, you truly touched us all x
When she was rose on the golden  girls
We will miss Betty white.   She was the last classic legacy of Hollywood!
Legend, team Icon.
Bro less commentary and more Betty White. This video should be retitled "Annoying narration of Betty White's life". It's Betty White, you'd do better just shutting up and letting her talent do the talking
Sue Ann Nivens has gone to the great vibrating bed in the sky. She wanted her ashes thrown on Robert Redford.
Miss Betty you will be so missed!
OMG those of you under the age of 40 don't remember her on the game show circuit, especially on Match Game.  That show was totally unscripted and Betty really let loose.  I'll never forget the back camera angle and the "come hither" look she gave.  Hilarious.  Also when she demonstrated 'exotic dancing'.  Check some of the reruns out.  RIP funny lady
she stick to let arthur duncan even white people dun like his performance in tv, she fight for racism, she is a great lady
Mojo
There was talk once about her playing the title role in a remake of "Oh God" - I despise remakes, but I would have watched that.
Rest in Peace Betty White, for all the smiles and laughs And thank you, For Being A Friend. To all of us.   I'm a Gen Z, so I don't know the full lenght of her career, but I don't remember a moment she didn't make me smile or laugh.
You'll be missed Legend ♥️
Fucking Legend! RIP
♥️♥️
RIP Betty White. She lived a wonderful and interesting life
I love you Betty 💓
Rest in Peace sweet Betty Angel. We miss you already
The Day America Cried.
Ily Betty 😭 Thank u for being there when I am depressed and fighting my battles. I'm not alone, you were there! Always will be! 😭
Out of all the actors Betty White is the Best and touch many. God  Bless
Back in St Olaf....😞😞😞
Absolutely a Legend loved her so much she's an angel in heaven forever amen ❤️ Legend Angel ❤️🙏❤️
😭 I can’t believe she didn’t make it to 100!
R.I.P. Betty White.  The most Golden of Girls
I never actually watched Golden Girls, before my time I guess so the opportunity never came up. Despite this everytime I saw Betty I'd smile, she was a piece of sunshine in human form.
Seventeen days short of her 100th Birthday. So many festivities were planned and now she's gone. She was one of the best and will be hard to forget. Rest in peace dear lady and be with your true love Allen.🙏✝️
This was awesome,  so many moments I didn't know.... but Betty was for the ppl and for the culture.  The Lord said "naw I'm not putting you through 2022" and brought her home
Icon, legend, hero, role model, larger then life, some how none of these words/phrases will ever be enough to describe the life of Betty White, and it would be impossible to list her achievements in a 24hr long video, not to many people leave this world, with such a long list of achievements. We lost so much more then a legend.  No words could ever be enough to show the gratitude we all have for having Betty White in our lives. RIP Betty we love you.
It’s a festival when Carol Burnett and Betty White act in the same sketch.
The Golden Girls being number one made me cry. I’m a die hard Golden Girls fan and I am devestated by her passing. She is a true queen and legend. Thank you for being a friend Betty, you will be so deeply missed 🤍
Every moment of screen time this Star was in shined so bright you'd be advised to wear special glasses. Just. She was and always will be a treasure and I am just glad we got to share the earth at the same time.
I had such a good new year. but i slept on & off today. something was telling me not too look at my phone. so i didn't. then i did then later on. i found out. One of one of my favorite actress Betty White. at age 99. has passed away. who would be 100 in a few weeks. so sad. it's funny some how i knew something bad happened. i wish i never looked at my phone now. i wish i waited. intill i woke up on Sunday morning. now because i don't think i be sleeping now. i wish i trusted my gut instincts . & not look at my phone. it's so sad . i was so hoping for a happy new year. but it's not starting out that way so far. 😭😭😭😭😭 RIP my favorite actress Betty White u are so missed & loved.  love u.💜💜💜💜 & miss you so much.😭😭😭😭😭RIP my favorite actress Betty White. Love you.❤❤❤ u are so missed 😭😭😭😭😭
2021s last f**k you to us all..Betty white was taken from us. Such a beautiful person. I'm sure she's making the angels laugh tonight. We will all miss you Betty!
Betty White was someone I wanted to live forever. Truly a great human being. RIP, Betty White.
I am sad and happy of what she achieved.  I've watched since my childhood, she is truly a Golden Girl.
Her angel face and voice and her great sense of humor will be missed dearly! She really was an icon !! RIP LEGEND 🙏 🕊
RIP you special funny lady. You will be missed.  😢😢😢
I'm really sad that she is dead! May she rest in peace whereever she is now!
Aww this made me smile, she was so funny and humble. She will be missed, RIP Betty White 🕊
You forgot to include Lake Placid.
I grew up watching hot in cleveland and golden girls. I love Betty white 😭 We'll miss you. Rip Betty white ❤️
The final Golden Girl has left us Betty, you'll sorely missed RIP Ms. White you were beautiful, great smile, graceful & had a wicked sense of humor.
😭😭😭😭😭
With all she's done she'll never be gone. Damn, I will miss her.
There is one more that should be added to this list. Number 21, her role in Lake Placid
RIP. Such sad news to wake up to. Go find the rest of the girls, and yr beloved husband. Truly sad, but you lived a great life. X
Thank you for this YouTube!  Betty White will be missed.
What  a lady she was! There will never be a another Betty White. Rest well sweet lady
Goodbye Betty, u were something special ❤️ And u always will be!
Forever missed, Betty white 😔😭 Animal lover, favorite Golden girl and an even more wonderful person
Sorry but you talked far too much over Betty.
Her William Shatner roast was also a huge favorite of mine.
Betty White will be greatly missed. RIP Betty White 🙏 ❤
I'll miss her 😭...I wish I'll be happy like her when I get old and spread positivity like her.
Her guest appearance on “Community” was another fun and very bright spot in her storied career.
I’m absolutely going to miss Grandma Betty White.. the sweetest, cutest, most talented lady ever. Blanche was my favorite Golden Girl but dammit Betty was my favorite all around in show biz. She left us so special, the last day of the year. She’ll be sorely missed 😢 💔
I love her in lake placid, she is so funny and lovable
My favorite moment I think ever has been a lot but the most recent one that I can think of cuz I just watched it the other night was The Proposal when Betty White and Sandra Bullock wore in the woods chanting and she was dancing and she looked on Sandra Bullock as face when she was rapping
I was never the biggest fan of the Golden Girls, but Betty WAS a goddamn national treasure. She's going to be missed. Goodbye, Betty. 😭
RIP Betty White!!!!!!!!! She will be greatly missed!
Let the poor woman speak for herself! This grating voiceover telling us what she said is SO fecking annoying, and Betty never needed anyone to interpret what she wanted to say. Have some respect for a true legend.
Love our first lady of television. We will miss you, Rose Nylund, our dearest, funniest Betty White.
More Betty White and less narration
Rest in Peace Miss Betty White ! You will be deeply missed !
Lake Placid!! Helloooo??!! Didn't even make honorable mention? Shame on you.
Rip Betty White 🙏 😥
R.I.P Sweet lovely Miss Betty White.. 💥🙏💖💥💋WE LOVE YOU!!! Thank you so much for your legacy! You'll be missed... 💥🙏💥❤️💥
No mention of her role in Boston Legal where she killed the guy (actually two men I believe) with a frying pan? Of course, she had a lot of roles to choose from over the course of her life! RIP Betty!
Betty was one of my biggest inspirations. She was funny, humble, and kind to everyone she met. The Golden Gates are embracing her with open arms and I am sure she has already got them on the edge of their seats up there 😂 You ARE and ALWAYS will be missed, Betty. Enjoy your vacation now. ❤
Fun fact: She was the last surviving Golden Girl.. Rest in peace truly.
The last Golden Girl has reunited with her girls 😔 Rest In Paradise Betty White 🙏🏽
Rip Betty white gone but never forgotten
I love the line from lake placid.  I'm rooting for the crocodile. I hope he swallows your friends whole. You might want to arrest me for that too. Is that a crime? To wish the chewing of law enforcement?
TRULY, A LEGEND!
I've not had a good life and I have to say that Betty as well as Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball, have gotten me through some very very bad times.  she will be sorely missed.
RiP Betty White. I thought you'd live forever. You will be missed. We will forever remember you.
RIP Betty White 🤍
I remember the day Betty became the adopted grandmother of our family, it was the release of the movie, Lake Placid .an old lady ,living by herself in the mountains taking what life has to offer and chalenges of wildlife in an everyday stride...but piss her off or tresspass, she can have you smilling while she's telling you to fuck off, or suck her dick.( my own mother...same way, but actually carries one of many guns..76 years old). Betty will be missed RIP BETTY
She was such a badass and hilarious lady! I love her so much! I was stunned when she passed Betty go see the angels in heaven. She is dearly missed.
I'm going to miss her. She's awesome!
Tacking on another honorable mention, her appearance in Community as the Anthropology professor; “That’s why you FAIL!” Just wish they could have had her on more, RIP Betty, if anyone deserves a good and peaceful rest it’s you.
The world is a little darker without Betty in it.
Our Betty White! How we will all miss you so! She's who I want to be when I grow up!! Such an amazing woman, performer and person! Now she's with the love of her life, may they entertain those up there together! She was and will always be the best! 🥰🥰🥰
For me it was the Golden girls. Betty sure had funy bones. May you RIP ⚘
hi  mark vey goos
We may not have known her personally… but to the lovely Betty, thank you for being a friend. Rest easy now, and know you’re loved so much, and missed so much already by all your friends, family, and finally, us fans.
I love Betty white, and I hope to see her in heaven when I'm done😁
Please still have the celebration for her 💔💔💔
Rip to Betty white amazing actress everyone's favourite  aunt and grandma
Way a wonderful woman, we shall all miss you Betty.
Saddest day in a very long time as a gay man she is loved by our community well every community actually but she is huge for us next week every gay club in America is doing a all Betty white drag show RIP queen everyone around the world will miss you
She will always be known to me for Golden Girls.     1-1-22
Thank you for being a friend, Betty. Catch up with the other Golden Girls up above!
Most of us have never lived in a world without Betty White
I bet you they've had this video ready since she passed 95
What a wonderful woman. What a wonderful life. I'm so glad she went gently in her sleep and left us with so much.
What a wonderful actor Betty was and will remain through reruns.  You have given us so much Betty.  RIP.
We will miss Betty White, ever so genuine-hearted and lovable person. Me, my mum, and my sister love her so much. We are not from the US but we are glad that we found out about her through Password game show with the love of her life, Allen Ludden, and from then on, we started to love them especially her (roughly 3 years ago) but now our hearts are totally broken because we were also excited for her 100th birthday this month. Betty White is truly one of a kind. Thank you for this, Ms Mojo!
the world has lost one of its special people...
Back2Basic: such a loss such a character Betty White always remembered!
she’s proof that you age flawlessly when you’re an unproblematic person. she looks the same as she did 40+ years ago!
i didn’t realize how old betty white was… my grandma was born in 1954!!
Last woman that was actually funny has passed. Legend.
She will be missed and fondly rememered.
Rest in Peace  America 's Queen Betty White
She never did the expected... rest in peace Betty....
Such an icon ❤️
Thank you for remembering my favorite golden girl. She was the best and lived life to the fullest. Rip
No community mention? She was great in that too!😂
Rest easy queen
Very funny lady. The snickers commercial was priceless. I loved her in her alligator feeding role in Lake Placid.
''Still getting cancelled after 65 episodes '' .... well measured based on how many decent tv shows are not getting more than 12ish episodes, this must have been a great show to get past 60 ...
RIP 🌹
A great actress,Rest in Peace Betty you are now with the love of your life
She's a fucking legend!
I know there is so much but i feel like her appearances on That 70's show show of been mentioned
Betty was such a grandma we’ve been dreaming of with all her passion & a big punch one-liner. you’ll forever be missed!
Absolute fave of BW moments has to be “officer fuckmeat” from Lake Placid. Absolute classic and so unexpected!  RIP Betty White!!!
It's amazing how so many people that can't stand each other, all had one thing in common, love for Betty.  If she could have been President of the world, we would all been so much better off.
Rest in Peace Miss Betty White. I will always love you. Thank you for filling our lives with so much laughter and joy.
Wow she were just talking about why she has long life. God remind us that he’s still in charge!!
It hurts so much that she is gone, I feel like in a way she encapsulated everyone’s grandma 🥺😢
Not a single mention of her multiple appearances on the Craig Ferguson show? Shame
Rose has returned home , makes me 😞 and 🙂Imagine the 3 other Girls sitting in their kitchen in heaven, eating cheescake...Rose opens the door:"Hello Girls, Im home", Blanche:" Rose?! Where have you been?" Dorothy, with her sarcastic look on her face:"Let me guess...Who haven t found the right cloud...?" R.I.P. Betty, the world had faboulous 99 years with you 🙂
My favorite Betty White moment is... All of them. 😭 I miss her so much already. I was just watching all the Golden Girls Christmas episodes yesterday and wondering how she planned to spend her birthday. I would always wish her a happy birthday on Twitter! Lol 🙏🙏🙏
Martha Wilson
RIP Betty
I LOVE BETTY WHITE :) Ai will niss her.
Honestly, she doesn't look like 99 at all. I like her in The Proposal. One my favourite character. Goodbye Betty White. You'll surely be missed ❤️
The century of the Golden Girl may have ended, but no one can forget how she made so many people feel so happy.
How did Lake Placid NOT make it onto this list!!!!
Nooooooooooooooooo!
I loved her!
RIP beautiful lady🐶🐴🦊🦍🦏🐼🦤🐧
Such a beautiful soul, actress, animal advocate. She will be missed. Many of us feel like we lost a good friend. Fly with the Angels, Betty.
She was Amazing. My heart is with her.
To bad she didn't find the truth. To late now
Amazing woman. Loved her, she lived a long life. God bless her beautiful soul.. RIP.
What a legend! You know you've done life right when people are genuinely upset when you pass away at 99 and think it was too soon!
Just think! If Betty White had married Barry White, heh heh heh, SHE WOULDA BEEN BETTY WHITE WHITE!! UH HUH!!
#15 - I'm sorry, but this one makes no sense. One thing that the racist South back then definitely had no problems with.... was a Black entertainer singing and dancing. A number of Black entertainers traveled through the night club circuit back then.   No, they couldn't eat there, they couldn't get a drink there. They wouldn't be booked unless the owner of the travelling show was White. But again, Southern audiences back then had zero issues with Black entertainers showing up to sing and dance for them.   An elderly neighbor of mine used to do the Southern circuit. In many places, Jim Crow laws placed a curfew on how late Black citizens could be outside. As night club entertainment, he told me it was not uncommon for such entertainers to be stopped by the local police on the way back to their hotels after a show was over.   He told me how he would carry a business card with his boss's telephone number. The entertainer would get put in jail, then the number on the card was called to verify his identity. His boss would tell the sheriff that he was one of his. Then offer free tickets to the next show for the sheriff and his wife if the entertainer was driven back to his hotel room safely.  That's just how it was done back then. So, I'm sorry but #15 makes no sense.
I’m so completely heartbroken. I was a huge fan of this beautiful Human. It will not be the same without her charm and wit. Fly high with the Angels Ms. Betty
"When Betty White says she wants a cup of coffee, you get her a *BEEEEP* cup of coffee!" Rest well, Queen Betty.
Legends never die, Betty White nothing can describe you more than what you gave the world. R.I.P.
What a fantastic woman and comedian. She will be sorely missed. RIP Betty White.
🙏 ⚰ 🙏 ⚰ RIP BETTY. REST NOW LOVE 💘 ❤ 💕 💗 ♥ 💖 WE'LL MISS YOU DEARLY 😘 😢 💔 ❤ 💕 😞 😘

I never knew how good of a person she was.
She always made me laugh 😂 and smile. Her wit, work and love for life. I am sorry she didn’t get to celebrate 100. She will be missed so much but she is basking in the glorious Light of God and all the great comedians and friends welcomed her. I am glad she got to move forward with dignity at die at home. She was a bit racy as she aged but she was comfortable with herself. I can just imagine she and Bob Hope doing a show in heaven. And I am sure she is singing praises to God
This world was already dark, but now it's even darker for losing such an iconic woman.. I've never met anyone who disliked our sweet Betty
Not a single sarcastic or bad comment. I've never read a comments section like this on any video. She loved everyone and had no ego. Just loved what she did and did it well. Simplicity that everyone could understand. A truly beautiful human being and man was she hilarious.
Rest In Heaven Betty White
RIP beautiful funny Betty! What a joy to have you walk the earth for 99 years!
To the most humble and genuine lovely lady in the world.  Rest In Peace Betty White. Such an amazing woman and human
Guest hosting Raw should have been first.
Bad ass man
I truly feel that she was loved by everyone. Young and old. RIP
❤️
MY HERO! ALWAYS IN MY HEART BETTY!
Rip Betty white , I had tons of great memories of watching her shows when I was young may her legend live forever 😥
rip betty
proof that 2021 sucked worse than any other year, it had to fit Betty's death in at the very last minute. Long live Betty, and 2021, don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya
GOLDEN GWORLL 💅😫💅😍 (jk but rest in peace queen)
I can not believe she is gone. We just received our “People” magazine and she is on the cover. We received it just yesterday. And today, she is gone. We most definitely lost a National treasure loosing Ms. White.  ❤️💜💚
God can now watch the Golden Girls Live
This shit best not be monetized.  Betty is a national treasure and anyone trying to make money off her death is a Pos
I'm not crying! You're crying.... Ok... I'm crying and I am ok with that
I have been watching Betty White for 67 years and my Mom and Dad loved her too….my Mom has been gone 37 years now and my Dad for over 20 so I have just pretended Betty was my 2nd Mom.  So elegant, so beautiful, so smart, so polite, always so kind and so talented…I am going to miss just knowing she is sharing this world with us and this great world full of animals.  Bye, Betty…see you sooner rather than later.
She was terrific as Catherine Piper in Boston Legal.
Death not end life we love you
If there is reincarnation,  I would hope Ms. White would come  back as a new generation of herself.  Missing her is going to be hard.
This was awesome, just like Betty herself! ❤️❤️ I spent new year's eve here in Finland rewatching the compilation of all her appearances on craig ferguson's show. There was no one like her, and their friendship was so sweet. ❤️  I hope she is with her beloved husband and as many christmas hippopotamuses her heart desires. ❤️
R.i.p betty white
The day I feared has come.  RIP Betty. You have been my favorite since I was a little girl.
Will miss you Betty 💔
Ohhhh this made me laugh so hard. Ms. White was an absolute genius, an incredible woman with brilliant comedic talent. She was amazing. RIP  Ms. White, thank you for all the years of laughter, you did a fine job here on this earth.
Thank you Betty for being what you were, you will be missed greatly. RIP now, you've had such an amazing life and career and we love you.
The world lost a Queen, Rest In Peace Betty. 😥🌻🥀
Why did she look only 66 when she was almost 100?    💛💛💛
Thank you for being a friend Betty White
Betty White's passing really touched me
RIP Betty White…. Fly high, sweet angel!
Betty doing SNL's Delicious Dish skit about her dusty muffins should have had an honorable mention.
Rest in Peace, dear lady... and thank you for being a friend...
I have been in a funk all day.  I truly loved her. Even though I had never met her. She played a major role in my life, which I had never known until I really sat down to think about it. She was one of the people that caused me to go vegan.  She was every woman that has ever entered my life, all wrapped into one. Funny, witty, beautiful. The list goes on and on. She is one of a few actors that I would have wanted to meet in person.   The world has truly lost one of its angels.  May her gods bless her with all they have.  I love you Betty. You will forever be in my heart.
Betty white would be truly missed as an amazing icon for the world.. everybody just loved her and why wouldn’t you.. I so wanted her to reach to 100.. hearing the news today I was absolutely devastated but I know she’ll be flying very high is the biggest star in the sky 🌌
She found out that she couldn't play with Lego,s any more and said fuck it !
My tia was crushed when she found out Betty White passed away, left many others with sorrow. Never to be forgotten ❤
I used to watch The Golden Girls growing up with my late grandmother. She left me when I was 13, and every October I would binge the ever loving shit out of the show in remembrance.. now they’re all gone.. I feel like I lost my grandmother all over again. RIP Betty, share some cheese cake with my grandma..
Love her always Animal activist  an Golden Girls up in Heaven with  her husband an all
What a humble person she was rest easy, reunited with her deceased loved onces. Gone but not forgotten, contributed to our history. One of time legend, talent that will never be repeated! May you rest in peace, thanks for all your time!
Life with Elizabeth was "cancelled" since it was thought that any further episodes would make any syndication deal less lucrative.
Everybody talks how great she was. Except she wasn’t, sorry
Legit found out in line at a theme park today and the whole line had the same “NOOoOoOoO!!!”
Comedic Warrior! Rest now beautiful woman! <3
❤❤❤❤
A legendary, iconic, unproblematic national treasure. May Betty Rest In Peace & look over us 😌🕊
Wearing my Golden Girls tee shirt tomorrow😪
I’m in my feelings about her passing😒. I watch The Golden Girls everyday. Now they are all gone🥺. Damn! Miss you Betty. SIP 🕊🙌🏾♥️
One thing about Betty is she always gon steal the show!!!! A icon!!!! We’re all heartbroken but it’s just like her to Sashay to her glory home on New Years! Literally went out on a day where we always gon celebrate her life besides her birthday. ✨✨✨✨✨ love you Betty
The Dusty Muffin sketch on SNL was hilarious.
RIP, Betty White. You were still taken too soon  because you are so loved❣️ What a wonderful life and amazing person!
Betty White was a gift. She will be greatly missed. RIP Betty
RIP Betty White.  We have lost a legend!!  There was no one like her and never will there be another like her!! We'll miss you Betty!!!
A national treasure... my heart is broken. She lived such a great, honest, and pure life. To be taken right before her 100th birthday is insane. Betty I hope you rest well. Thank you for the years of laughs and humanitarianism. You are the definition of an ICON. There will never be another. You’re a TRUE Golden Girl.... RIP Betty White ❤️💔
Rest easy Betty White. Live it up with Dorothy, Blanche and Sophia in Heaven!
Another reason 2021 was a horrible year. God bless you Betty. RIP>
If anything thing can bring this divided country together it's the nation wide mourning of this lovely woman
A tough year ends with the toughest goodbye of all. Losing Hollywood's most beloved lady of comedy. ♥
Wow this made me cry. Watched her shows in the 70's 80's and 90's. These later years it's like she became America's  Grandma.
RIP Betty White 😞
Last night I saw this promo picture and thought if she had passed away bt then realized it was not so
She was one of a kind, a trailblazer on television, an advocate for equality, an accomplished actress--and she excelled at comedy--and someone who enjoyed doing what she did and everything that came with it. RIP, Betty. You did yourself proud.
You are an inspiration ❤❤❤❤
It's an honour to have such a beautiful, graceful, humble woman that lived a full life grace our screen for decades.  To think she aged so gracefully without looking plastic is truly remarkable. She should have a skincare line after her cause I'm like "whoooaaaaa girl you look younger and act younger than people 30 years younger than you".  RIP Betty, the queen of comedy! Your legacy lives on
Rest in piece, you jewel of a human being. Gone, but never forgotten, you will stay golden forever. And always in our ❤️’s
I am so glad she was recognized and honored all during her life... too often people don't get their due until they are gone. God Bless you,  Betty White.
RIP Betty 🙏🏾 😇!! A true G.O.A.T.
Integrity personified. Was always true to herself. At almost 100 years, that is truly saying something
A beautiful, classy, and forever memorable lady. Cheers to a beautiful life, Betty white. 🙏🏼👍🏼❤️
My favorite Betty White moment is from the movie “Lake Placid” where she introduced me to the term “no shit Sherlock”
Betty’s passing proves that even goddesses die.  Now she knows the secret (a reference to an interview I saw of her years ago).
Thank you for being a friend ❤️
I am in tears and yet, Betty would not want us "boo hooing" her departure.  I am sure she would remind us that she gets to see her beloved 3rd husband, animals she misses, and she's off to a new, amazing adventure.  So buck up and have a cocktail and let's toast the amazing lady she was, and the example she gave us of a life well lived.  Slante.
Why no boston legal reference?
She was awesome……
Such a great human being and actress, an inspiration!!!!  Will be really missed.
How can you highlight Betty White and Queen Latifa working together and not mention Bringing Down the House? Make it make sense.
Be glad we all shared the world with this legend in our life.
This is beyond sadness😢💔 heart breaking 💔😢she passed on my daughter birthday 💔 😢our Heavily Father thank you ❤for the opportunity of her phenomenal amazin moments❤ we all shared with her that kept us smiling and laughter❤ 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 I'm lost with words shock its like out of blue 💔my goodness 💔like I wasn't prepare for this and inspecting this tragedy news 💔😥this hurt me like how I lost my grandmother 💔😢who passed in 2017 it was just like this unexpected 😔this is really heart breaking 💔😢 she will be forever missed 😢💔and Legand I still watch the golden girls till this day Legends ❤❤❤❤🌷🌷🌷🌷💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽  R.l.H Betty White 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
RIP you incredible, wonderful woman.
She will be missed beyond measure. A life lived well ❤️ we love you Betty!!! ❤️❤️❤️
If there was ever a video to not ask for likes and a sub...it's this one.
Betty White. There will never, ever be another like you. R.I.P. Betty White ,. you will be sadly missed :(
We lost a real one today. You can also find a lot of life of Elizabeth episodes here on YouTube. I reccomend it. They're truly brilliant! Long live Betty
How are we gonna live in a world without Betty White? 😭😭😭
R.I.P Betty White !
Her passing is a milestone and the end of an era. She made us all laugh and smile while we were laughing. Oh dear, that sounded silly. Like some thing Rose would have said.  She was the fifth person from the Mary Tyler Moore Show to have transitioned. Last year 2021. Seems like yesterday. Anyway, first was Cloris, then Gavin, then Ed, then Amos and now Betty.  I think Georgette died in 2020 along with Rhoda. Mary went by by in 2019 and Ted in the last century. He must have been really ancient. Who knew? RIP SUE ANN & ROSE NYLUND AND FIRST LADY OF TELEVISION, QUEEN ELIZABETH......... WHITE. THANKS FOR BEING A FRIEND.
The very best Betty White moment happened on the MTM show. Betty as Sur Ann Nivens in her vibrating bed……Absolutely fantastic…….almost as good as Chuckles the Clown.
She was a soap Queen comedy icon movie legend music risk taker talented entertainer amazing author a true animal lover a great humanitarian thanks for everything you do for all of us ❤️ rip
I’m gunna miss her so much❤️
Her Golden life!! Rest easy Betty White!! Thank you for all the laughs and joy funny girl!! You are a treasure!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I know January 17th was her bday...but Someone said she lived through 24 leap years so technically she's 100
RIP friend
Rest In Peace❤️
We were taping Match Game ’75. Betty White, Nipsey Russell, Brett Summers and I were hanging out at Gene Rayburn’s house.  Nipsey says, “Lou, where does the joy come from?” I said, “It comes from my blank and it blanks from my blank!”   And Betty White laughed so hard, her b00b fell out!
Betty was classy sassy fierce badass and down right awesome thanks for the golden years
It's "We scheduled", not "We'd scheduled".  Public education was much better back when Betty White was young.
Sad she had to go but I had a feeling she would go doing what she loved. What's shocking is that it she seemed just fine 2 days ago and then bam! She's gone. My favorite thing of her is when she was in SNL and said "Honey my muffin has had a cherry in it since 1940' something. I don't remember the whole like but it was hilarious. Her swearing is too! R.I.P.
R.i.p. Betty
Betty white was a true blue.  Hearing of her loss today spread through out. Thank you Betty.
May all of the golden girls rest in peace
To think she started on tv before most people had a tv.  RIP Betty
The last golden girl is now on a golden throne
RIP Betty 🙏  thank you for being a part of my childhood 🙏  you are now a Beautiful Angel. We will miss you 😢😢
We have lost so many good people in 2021, but she was the greatest loss. To hell with 2021 man this year has sucked all around.
I 🤍that lady. Ms.Betty White. RIP. Bon Voyage.
Such a sad shame that she didn't live to see her 100th birthday, much less coming into the new year of 2022. So very close too. And this is the first time I saw young Betty White in her prime here. She looked good back then. Never watched the Golden Girls though.  Rest in peace.
Out of all the celebrities that have died over my years, hearing of her passing really saddened me. She will be missed. She had a great sense of humor and an infectious smile. Thank You Ms. Betty White for being a friend.
RIP dear and lovely Rose Nylund !!!!
So sad to hear of Betty White making that final walk off the stage of life. You will be forever missed Betty!
She's going to make an awesome angel. Rest In Power Betty White🌿🕊
Robin Williams and Betty White are the only celebrity deaths that have affected me.. Robin Williams brought joy to so many people.. Betty White brought laughter inequality.. she stood up to the injustices of the world... Losing her truly is a loss
Rest In Paradise Miss Lady! I know Alan will be happy to see you ❤️
RIP Betty you will be  missed and loved forever
Can’t believe it 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧legends live forever
Betty one CLASSY LADY  !!!
Heaven gained humor
Rip miss Betty White.  You've made so many people happy.
We've lost America's beloved grandma today. Sad way to end the year. Can't believe we lost Cloris Leachman, Ed Asner, Gavin Macleod, and Betty all in the same year. Condolences to her family and all who loved her.
She lives a very full life! And that indeed should be celebrated❤️❤️🙏
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for putting this up now I needed a laugh rest in peace Betty With the whole cast from Mary Tyler Moore and the Golden girls. I’m guessing it won’t be very peaceful there will be one heck of a party there tonight
Yesterday I was watching a video of St. Olaf Stories, and I'm so amazed how Betty could kept a straight face while telling all those stories without bursting into laughs cuz Bea and Rue couldn't. She was so special. Definitely we all are going to miss her. RIP Betty. I hope you are having a delicious cheesecake with the rest of the girls.
We lost a national treasure 😭
She and Larry King are  doing a show together in Heaven now. Rest In Power, Betty. You TRULY Lived Long And Prospered.
Rest well Betty. Thank you for being a friend.
I’ve grown up with Betty in my life. Now that she’s gone, there’s an emptiness setting in, as I’ve adored her so much. Like a member of my family is gone😩☺️
REST IN PEACE MRS WHITE WE WILL MISS YOU 😢
RIP Betty...I’m part of the young generation of fans and I watched her a lot on Match Game, Hot in Cleveland, Password, and Tattletales in 2021 ❤️😔🙏
The world feels empty...
RIP Betty.  You made us laugh. You made us think.  We are losing a generation that taught respect through comedy.  The electronic "woke" warriors are destroying the "offensive" idioms with no knowledge and understanding.  The losses are heartbreaking.
The greatest Betty White moment was on January 17th, 1922. It was the day the legend was born, so really, everything after was a result of this moment, making it the best Betty White moment.
Some people don’t deserve the praise they’re given…Betty White is not one of those people.  Deserves every ounce and infinitely more.
The Angels in HEAVEN are laughing out loud after Betty White  slid into Heavens Gates sideway! RIP! You will be missed!
Thank you putting this together! Well done!
I hate 2022...already. Who wants to help me build a time machine?
My Condolences To The Families And My Prayers Are With You  Rest In Peace Miss Betty White 🌹🌹🌼🌼🌸🌸🌺🌺🌷🌷🦋🌈🦋
What a beautiful lady. RIP sweet Betty.
Thank you miss betty
The final thing we ALL as Americans could agree upon and love- Betty White, is now gone…thank you for being a friend!!
Adam and Eve with Johnny Carson
I put this on my playlist to watch not even knowing the news! I was just raving about how long she has lived and how she is the last of the great of the Greatest Generation. 😥😭 I'm broken right now. Thank you for such an amazing video.
Still on tears about her passing, she was an angel on earth, and now will be one in heaven to watch over us, we love you Betty White
I can't pick a favorite Betty moment seriously! It's a truly sad ending to '21 but it was sadly gonna happen one day. Her honeybun, Allen Ludden now has his sweetie back! 😭😭😭💔💔
It’s so sad she couldn’t even get to 2022
May you RIP you wonderful human. I can only imagine what the sweet mercy of death is like for one so old
One of my faves was a potty-mouthed Betty feeding cows to a giant crocodile in Lake Placid.
Rest ion Peace, Betty...
Betty white so funny watching her since the 70 on the Mary Tyler show . She so cute and sweet .RIP. Betty white
HOT IN CLEALAND ... Is my favorite Betty White Show
I felt sad when I heard the news
Betty's role as 'Sue Ann Nivens' should have been #1. The role was far superior on the far superior Mary Tyler Moore Show, over The Golden Girls. The same was true for Bea Arthur in the far superior 'Maude'. Both shows too sophisticated for most Americans unfortunately. Too bad.
Betty White and the census lady!
Gotta love how they lock down the top comment instead of letting others vie for the top spot with a legitimate memory.    Smh
God Bless Her for all the laughs & fun she gave us and the love she doted on all the animals in her life. I hope when she got to Heaven, Allen Ludden was standing there, arms wide open, and she ran right into them. I hope he told her, you were right...I was with you every step of the way, sweetheart !! I hope all her friends from the Golden Girls & Mary Tyler Moore will give her a gigantic 1st birthday in Heaven Party, in 3 weeks (Jan 17th), when she would have turned 100!!  Thank you, Betty White, for everything..Rest in eternal love with Allen.❤
Thank you all for being a friend ♥️Now they can reunite in heaven♥️
A Queen of many generations, my Grandparents grew up watching her together with my Great Grandparents, followed by my parents then me … I remember watching Golden Girls with my Grandma back in the mid to late 2000s 😭 it was always a fun time, and then The Lost Valentine 🥺 she was Iconic and a very loving inspiration 🥰 Rest In Peace Queen 🙏
Betty you were one of the grand ladies of film and we will all miss you .....
We all needed this today. Thank you for bringing it!
I am still sobbing.   Rest in beautiful Peace our Beautiful Queen of Comedy.  We all miss and love you.  99+ years was not enough for us.  Thank you God for our Angel.
I miss her she was a legand
There will never be another Betty White like her. Betty White you will be greatly missed!❤
There will always only be one Betty White. Thank you my Golden Girl.
She was such a sweet ray of sunshine. She’ll be missed deeply
Poor Betty, she was so close to her special 100 Birthday. She will be known as one of (If not) The best comedian legend ever!😥😥
Betty White was that lovable crazy grandmother we all wanted.
Among my earliest tv memories is Betty White. She has been a consummate professional her entire career.
Actually my favorite Berry White performance was in Lake Placid. It was unexpected (I don't want to give anything away) and as a lesser supporting role, she was stellar.  Seriously, she outshined everybody
An absolute treasure.
Rest In Peace to this Golden Girl ❤️❤️❤️
The eldest of the golden girls and outlived them all by 11 years
Rest In Peace Betty White we will miss you.
And when the world needed her most she vanished </3....
The gold girls
RIP Betty White
I really couldn't type right... we're going to miss her too much!!!! We love you so much Betty!!!!
Rest in peace!
RIP Betty
She had found the fountain of youth, she never aged a single day. Respect.
R.I.P. Betty White
The world lost a treasure today.
Wow that was fast
RIP Betty
Betty playing 'Ellen', Eunice's (Carol Burnett) sister on the 'Family' sketches showcased her great ability at comedy while playing a 'serious' role.  We will miss your wit and grace.  May you rest in peace.
Elka was wonderful. I loved that character in Hot in Cleveland.  I felt it was very close to her real life.
RIP  Betty !  World  lost   a  "little  big  woman "  .. you  would maybe  say  :  " Ive  been  soooo  f+++  close  to  turn  100 ... sooo  close   "  . World  will  miss  you !
Ummm Community honorable mention !!!!
Rip we’ve lost a star but heaven has gained an angel
May she rest in peace
I loved her in The Proposal.
rip betty💕😭
Like many, I dreaded this day! So often Betty White had me in tears of laughter, today I can only feel tears of sadness!.  This AM, I was reading of the planned celebratory event for her 100th and the celerity line up to be contributors, I then watched an episode of "Hot in Cleveland" as I had my morning coffee anticipating the final hours of 2021. I didn't in my wildest dreams anticipate by days end I would learn of Betty White passing. Whilst her infectious humor and ability to view her in memoriam in a legacy of so many appearances and shows, sadly she has passed and whilst there will always be celebrities, there will never be another Betty White! Thanks for the memories RIP Betty!
I am sure that upon her last breath on this earth, the love of her life aka third husband Allen, along with Rue, Estelle and Bea, was there to guide her. RIP Betty.
Aaaawwwww Rest In Peace Miss Betty😢😢😢❤️🙏🏼❤️
what an iconic and humble person. hurt my heart when I read the news this morning. may she rest in the peace she absolutely deserves.
😔
She's not dead it's a hoax in the next few week on her birthday's going to say happy 100th birthday I fooled you
She was amazing in Hot in Cleveland.
Rest In Peace Betty White 🕊️🕊️🕊️
RIP. Truly a national treasure that will be missed.
A legend...RIP 💖
We cry Betty, because we cannot understand the world without your brilliance here. Kind of selfish want to hold on forever.  But the honor of seeing your very best work through my life is fantastic enough.  I know the love of your life was waiting for you, and you have finally been reunited. And that brings utter joy.   Thank you for bringing us the joys and laughter all these years.
Betty White wasn't just a nice lady.  People know about her work for humane treatment of animals, but maybe because it was back in the 1950s and 60s, we've forgotten what a trailblazer she was.  Her production company was female led.  Bandy Productions produced her first TV show "Life with Elizabeth" when she was only 28.  And she riled up controversy by casting Arthur Duncan, a black man, as a regular cast member on "The Betty White Show," telling critics who disagreed with the decision to "...just live with it "  She was also a supporter of the LGBTAQ+ community even back in the 70s.  We were lucky to have her.  I'm so glad that Ms MOJO recognized all this.
Rest in peace Betty. Glad to know that you died painlessly and peacefully, and what type of year 2022 is going to be. We will always love and remember you. Your spirit lives on.
20 is too small a number for Betty White. Everything with her is a treasure.
Though no longer on this earth, her legacy will live on. RIP Betty White, thank you for being a friend 💚💚💚
A lovely, loving tribute to a beloved actress.  RIP Betty White, an unique gift .
A national treasure is an understatement.   She was the sweetest, kindest, most talented lady around.  Her love for animals showed her heart of gold.  Love you, Betty.   Our world won't be the same without you.
RIP Queen! 🕊💜
RIP Beautiful, Classy Young lady. You will be sorely missed. The world is to me a sadder place.
I honestly thought she would live forever... or at least like many of those biblical characters that lasted for 500 years. Betty White's death has made me face mortality in a way that frightens me. I know I'll never make 100. So it is a countdown now. Still, I must say I find solace in the fact that her life was filled with positive moments that made her life worthwhile. Maybe that's the takeaway, cherish the moments, make them last, and make them worthwhile. Love you Betty and Thank you!
RIP great lady!
That roasts in that snickers commercial. That probably still burns XD
She was a rare gem to the industry and all actor/actresses should take note on how she was as a person.  We were lucky enough to have her 99 years. RIP Betty White.
i’m surprised that they didn’t show her small roles in that 70s show playing kittys mom
Should have made it with us Betty
Thank you for this although her role in Tremors totally deserved a spot. Rest in peace, lovely Betty! 💜
Betty thanks for all the great moments you gave us RIP.
I will miss her. Such a beautiful soul. Greatest comedian of ALL time.
I just had a feeling 2022 would be the departing year of this wonderful soul to other fantastic places. (1.01.2022)
I'm 😞. So sad Betty is gone. While watching this Betty was a genuine normal lady. RIP Betty. We will miss you
RIP Betty White ❤️ I’ve seen every episode of The Golden Girls more times than I can count. She’s one of the funniest people ever
Why did she need to curse and take away from herself?
RIP. Thank you.
RIP Betty White Your Happiness and Smile will always be amazing 🤩
the passing of Betty White is how you end a shit show of a year.  -  2022 with less humor
Forget celebrating 2021, I am spending the night remembering Betty White.   RIP
She's in St. Olaf heaven now lol, RIP ☁️🙏🏼🤍 Wait is that Sophia at 09:04??
An absolute legend. She will be missed
Her role as Kitty Foreman's mother always gave me an ab workout
Y’all forgot Lake Placid!!  RIP sweet lady, thank you for the many memories!
Rip the best lady ever
What a treasure she was ❤️
😳
🥺
❤️
R.I.P. to the Queen of the screen!!!A Legend,An Icon!!!🕊🕊🕊
She was a comedic genius! Humanity!  She was a National treasure! I love everything she has done.  First Lady of TV.  She will be missed by so many!!!
I’m glad she got recognition whilst she was still alive. For too many it comes too late.
Loved this! We all adored Betty. I'm sad at her passing. But as she said, She Kicked Ass! God bless her...he blessed us!
Gonna miss this precious 💎. She truly was legendary. May she rest in peace. ❤❤
No celebrity death has ever hit me as hard as Betty's 😔 She will always hold a place in my heart ❤ x
She was a regular panelist on The Liars Club 1970s game show when it was hosted by Allen Ludden.  The producers called her their secret weapon because she could tell the most outrageous lies with that beatific smile on her face.  You never really knew if she was lying or not!  We already miss you, Betty. Rest in Power.
Heaven gained a truly amazing woman. Betty was the queen of gameshows and such a iconic woman who ranks up there with other icons like Lucille Ball. RIP. You will be missed
RIP sweet Betty there will never be another like you
It broke my heart that she passed. She truly was a great person. Never heard of her doing anything wrong or being hateful. She was just a bright light in the world. The girls are eating cheesecake in heaven now
Betty was so pretty when she was young!  She was smart as a whip too. Betty is now reunited with all the pets she had over the years. RIP our Beloved Golden Girl.
Rest well, Betty. We are lesser for your leaving.
The census lady skit on SNL.. died laughing.. RIP Betty. You will forever be one of my idols
Thank you MOJO  for showing this.  And Thank You Betty for all the laughter you have given us all your life.  May you be making God laugh now.  RIP
RIP. Betty White❤️😔
The GOAT!  RIP Betty
She made me laugh , she was great !!!! I will defiantly miss her . Grandma of Television ......
That Snicker's commercial? That solidified her as a true Icon.  R.I.P. Miss White
She was such an amazing person, I was hoping for her to make it to her 100th birthday, may she rest in peace and may she never be forgotten.
Her cameos on Community were awesome, definitely worth at least an honorable mention here.
Ily Betty 😭
Tonight we're all drinking for Betty!!!!!
I say we should dedicate 2022 to our memories and the legacy of Betty White. We follow her example and become better people in doing so.
Match game is my show. I watch all the old shows all the time😘😘😘😘😘😘
This hurt my heart in pieces. We will love u forever
"Little tiny fish with Ginsu knives. They had to be very careful not to filet themselves." I love you Betty and you will be missed VERY VERY much. I hope your up there with Bea, Estelle, & Rue raising hell...!!!
Damn you 2021!  Nikki Glazer said it best, "We've lost some great one's, how about we get rid of some okay's instead"
I missed her guest appearance on “Community”, specially rapping along Abed and Troy
She's my favorite Golden Girl. RIP. Thank you Betty for the laughs.
There is nothing Betty had done that wasn't funny. For me I've laughed so hard with her kind of comedy
She made me, so many more times than I can count, howl with laughter. She had so much talent, and so many talents; but her best talent, was being a kind, caring, and compassionate human being, that we all got to see as an example.  Betty, I am honored to be on this earth at the same time as you were!  May you RIP.  Thanks for the laughs. I am a little heartbroken tonight.
She never stopped enjoying life.  She loved acting, people and animals and We Will ALL Miss Her
What a horrible way to start the new year...We've lost a national treasure and LEGEND!   ❤U BETTY...R.I.P.
This is one of those passings that even though you've never met them personally it feels personal.  It broke my heart that shes passed away. RIP Betty White. She was an absolute treasure of past generations, my generation and I'm sure an idol still to future generations to come.
💔💔💔
I don't call this woman "Her Awesomeness" for nothin'!
Rip: Betty white you will be missed so much but never be forgotten.oxoxox
Ms. White's tributes to both THE Morgan Freeman and THE Queen Latifah are my personal favorites.
I'll miss you Betty!❤️ No one can throw shade the way you do, and you are hilarious! ☺️ God bless you! ❤️🙏😇
Lake Placid started my love affair with this woman and I never stopped loving her! Rest in peace, Queen! 😔
So sad!---End of an era!!
I am so going to miss seeing her! Love you Miss Betty White! Thank you for being part of all our lives! R.I.P ❤️
What a legend
So sad to hear of her passing,her light will burn bright .R.I.P Betty  thank you for the laughter.
Rest in Power- what a legend
What is wrong with theese people? Trying to profit off someones death just hours after they die. Disgusting
I grew up watching every show she was ever in to all the movies she was part of. As far as I'm concerned, the last of the great actresses has left this world and I hope her greatest wish comes true that she will be reunited with her husband, Allen. Ye shall be missed.
R.I.P. Betty White
I swear I honestly thought she'd outlive all of us. Such an amazing legend, 🙏 RIP
I am so very saddened to see that this has not hot our mainstream TV & news more so. When Micheal Jackson died I remember them breaking to whatever I was watching at the time to tell the world. And I think she deserved that so much more than him. Breaks my heart & makes me want to say so so many kre harsh things & harsh words bc of it .damn the ppl for not caring more!!!
I am sooo sad. I had love her since golden girls. Be at peace Betty.
The world is going to be a little darker without this amazing light.  Ms White will be missed by all.
One thing i know Betty is still there. In our hearts
Thank you for being a friend. Rest In Peace T_T
Even though I'm too young to understand how much of an icon she was/is, I can see that she was a genuine human being who enjoyed what she did. A true inspiration for women I'm sure.
2021 just HAD to piss on us one last time.
What do these people have in common? Betty White Billy Graham Prince  Philip  They all passed away at  99
God broke the mold when he made Betty. He knew she was some of his finest work.
A world wide icon. Miss her already
Rest In Peace dear lady, miss you already
I'm in whiplash! I literally saw a news headline about her upcoming 100th birthday bash and then I took a trip down nostalgia lane googling The Golden Girls just to see she died. I thought it was fake. I wish it was fake. 😭 😭
I’m on this massive binge watching all these Betty White Tribute video’s on you tube & my eyes are all swollen from crying. Even though I didn’t personally know Betty I felt like she was apart of my family ! This world is truly lost without her ! 💞😢💞
Damn, 2021... what'd betty do wrong?😞💔
Queens next
RIP Betty White We will miss you  😢 😔😪
I honestly had a feeling that she wasn’t going to make it to her 100th. She was amazing and so loved. Rest hun you deserve it.
My  grandmother was born  the  same  year as  Betty White  died  the  same  day  as  Betty White but  only  8 years  a  part  so  it is  personal  to me
Betty's passing marked the end of an era. 91 years in the entertainment business ended this morning. Betty lived from 1-17-22 to 12-31-21.
I have been inspired by Betty White as I age. If I make it to 99, I hope I'm half as witty, mentally sharp, and funny.
Rip Betty , enjoyed your life's work.
Betty  White  was  born in  in 1922 and deid in  2021
What a way to end 2021. Thank you Betty for being everyone’s friend. RIP
She was smart, pretty and a comedy goddess. She will be greatly missed!!
Wonderful lady we could all learn from her what a wonderful attitude and life she had we will love an miss her. ❤️🙏🥰
She just makes me happy to be alive
I dont think there will ever be such a legend as Betty white was, she will forever be the greatest of all times!
R.I.P. Betty White. A true icon for all generations. ❤️
Man…. I’m going to miss her. THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND….
Betty hit people with her comedy in the 50’s, 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, 2 thousands AND 2010’s, until today on her death.  What a legacy! 70 years plus!
You are saint Olaf's woman of the year and Hollywood's woman of the century Oof Dah!
This makes me so sad.  Today, the world collectively lost our cool gramma.    R.I.P. Betty White
Her "I'm thanking you" put a tear in my eye
R.I.P to an actress who left a lasting legacy tv and movies
What an absolute legend she was (still is)!
RIP  Betty White.  Gone but never  forgotten and always loved!  Your video is a beautiful tribute to Betty White.
Rest in peace to the best friend any of us have ever had. Love u queen!
TTFN
Loved your comedy Betty White!! RIP
She played a terrific part on The Practice as Katherine Piper-Alan Shore's old battle-ax neighbor.
Rip Betty
Back in St. Olaf
My dearest Lord, I love you and pray to you daily but…..couldn’t you have waited a few more weeks to accept Betty into your loving arms so an appreciative world could celebrate her 100th birthday?  Times are tough down here and we all certainly could’ve used a little joy.  Nonetheless….take care of that sweet angel for us. Much love. Dan Victoria Canada
Beautiful, talented , funny, and so humble. American Icon. R.I.P Betty.
:( :( amazing lady love her so much
I loved in the Golden Girls  <3
She was one of my favorites! Great actress!
RIP BETTY WHITE.  She will be missed.  She is irreplaceable!
Her role in Lake Placid should have been included.
I feel like I lost a grandmother...
THE G.O.A.T. 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ NOT EVEN CLOSE
Let It Grow
Thank you God for letting us have her for so long!!
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Oh how I will miss this lady. God bless you Betty  White, I will never forget you because you always made me laugh
wow this was great. what an impact she made!
Also, does anyone see a resemblance between Betty White (in her first sitcom) to the actress that played Elaine on Seinfeld- Julia Louis Dreyfus? Holy moly they look so much alike!
Betty White was a treasure that the entire world has lost.  But in life she was a beautiful treasure to those that watched the shows and movies she was in, to the people who worked with her, and to those that knew her personally.  Rest in peace Betty White, enjoy a slice of cheesecake with the rest of Golden crew and your family up there.

She’s with her fellow Golden Girls in Heaven. You’ll forever be in my heart Betty. Thank you for all the joy and Laughter you gave me through the years of growing up. Thank you for being a Friend
having a vodka now, didint know she was a fan too
There's an episode of Golden Girls where Betty White's character says something I'll never forget and I found it to be pretty prophetic and ironic. They (the girls) have to put a dear friend, who had no other family or friends, into a nursing home and they had to fight for her rights to get proper care. Anyways in that episode, the girls Rose, Blanche, Dorothy, and Sophia, are talking about how they'll stay friends forever and even go to the same nursing home if they have to. Then Betty White's character states, "what happens when there's only one of us left?" And low and behold, Rose, Betty White's character WAS the last one left out of all 4 of the characters/actresses. I always found that to be really weird, idk why.  I'm so saddened by the loss of such an amazing woman. I know that I didn't know her personally, but from what I understand of her and her character, she's someone I definitely look up to. Her love of animals, for one, and the fact that she never remarried after the love of her life, a game show host by last name of Lundron, (I think that's what it is) passed away in 1981. She said she just knew she would never feel the same towards any other man. She's a legend in her own right and I really wished she'd made it to her 100th birthday. Because from what I heard she was planning a HUGE party! She'll be greatly missed by so many! ETA: I just found out through a news video regarding her death, that she was an AMAZING singer. I never knew that!
I loved everything I saw her in. She was and still is a very beautiful and special lady. My favorite memory of her is when she played in Lake Placid. She had me in tears she was so funny!!! RIP 🙏 Ms. White you will be missed..... alot!!!
Rest In Peace Betty white ❤️💗we love U
RIP Betty, not sure why you guys didn't mention her hilarious roll in Lake Placid.  I think that was my favourite roll she ever did.
Betty white was a damn saint, she will be missed for sure
The golden girls are reuniting  in heavenly  Saint Olaf.
I loved her as Kitty’s mom on that 70s’ Show.
Thank You For ALWAYS Being A Friend, Cheesecake
One overlooked moment wIs when she was a guest on the tonight show in 2006 and she was having a conversation with Jay Leno and Kiefer Sutherland.
Woah this legit got me ..
Absolutely gutted at hearing this xxxx The 4 golden girls are together again xx
why does the damn narrator have to talk so dang much????????????? I am here for Betty White. I don't want to hear the stupid narrator. Show the clips of Betty White, show the full ones, don't show a few seconds and then start yapping.
My favorite BW moment was from Community, when she chokes out Joel McHale
☆⚘☆👒☆💌☆🌠☆💜☆Bless you 🕊☆Shine On Above☆🕊
I remember her, she voiced Ted’s Grandmother from the movie the Lorax;
Betty was so funny Me and My mom loved her.. Lake Placid & St.Olaf hit different now. 😇😇😇😇
She was like 2.5 weeks away from being 💯years. I was rooting on her to make it 😞. RIP Appreciate you for showing me being old is not the end of the road. Thank you for being a friend 🤗.
Damn ...
I first saw Betty White on the game show circuit and have been a fan ever since.  We miss you already Betty
Rest in God's eternal love Betty
Eating cheesecake for dessert tonight in honor of Betty White. What a remarkable entertainer. RIP Betty White
i Miss you Betty White  you always make me Laugh
RIP Betty.   You are the coolest gal in showbusiness.  I bet you have everyone in Heaven cracking up!
rip
We all knew this day was gonna come.  Damn, what a way to end the year.
Betty was one of a kind. And will truly be missed. Who will replace her as our new national treasure? I vote her good friend Morgan Freeman.

The world has loss a legendary woman today, Betty White was a one of a kind woman who is loved every single day. We all love you Betty White, Rest In Peace 😭😭😭
I will think of her, fondly!
I haven't cried this hard for a celebrity since Robin Williams. Betty, our queen,  Rest in Power. You are a F*cking Legend,
RIP you are my inspiration! The most loving forgiving person, loves all human and animals, just love life, live it, enjoy it! You only have 1 life! What an amazing human being! Forget the Hussle you are here, enjoy LIFE!!!!!
rip betty the golden star is now dim today but will forever shine you will be missed
I haven’t felt this heartbroken about the death of a celebrity since Robin Williams. Goodbye, Betty.
I miss her already 😢. She was a huge idol to me. Rest In Peace Betty White. She was legendary. Thank you for being a friend.🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹😭😭
When she was in Lake Placid. Freaking awesome. Legend.
Jesus you guys are quick 😳
The funniest woman since Lucille Ball to grace the small screen.  May you rest in peace Betty.
Rest in peace Betty you'll be terribly and horribly miss.
My forever golden girl. 🥺 Rip legend.
What a way to end the year 😭 I loved Betty White she was always one of my favorite Golden Girls and actresses! Rest in peace love
Betty White forever‼️🏆
I feel like you had this video prepared for her 100th birthday which she didn't quite make, but what a great life she had. Bless you Betty White for everything!!! RIP
What makes her passing tolerable is she lived a long life and actually knew how special she was to the world which is something a lot of people don't get, they get celebrated in death, she was and always will be a legend ❤️❤️
Betty White’s one of those actors I genuinely like not just her performances, but as a person. Always a great spirit. RIP Betty ❤️
Betty White was a beautiful human, inside and out, right till the end. Rest In Peace!
Still can’t believe it… 😭😭😭
Rest In Peace sweet angel 🥺😭
Rest in Peace Betty. We will always love you. Thank you for being a friend.♥♥♥♥
Rest In Peace sweet lady! Thanks for entertaining generations of many!
To me...she will always be Sue Ann Nivens
Hardly any celebrity aged over 80 is as known and loved by the present young generations as Betty was, and she was 99. Just *two weeks* short for her 100 birthday. That would have been a wonderful celebration, so sad.
R.I.P. Betty White!
Betty White is the best!
I only heard of Betty White a few times but, I can tell that she is an amazing, wise, and funny women. I'm sad and shocked that the world took her away before her 100th bday. May she rest in peace.
Oh gosh she passed away on the same day as James Avery. Two of my favourite people. Rest in peace, Betty. Say hi to James for me.
Well now that I’ve spent the entirety of this vid in tears - we all love you Betty, RIP.
Now she knows the secret. Rest in peace!
A true inspiration
I still laugh about an interview with Betty's best friend Mary Tyler Moore. Mary was straight laced so Betty taught her how to cuss!
Betty White's character in Lake Placid was great as well where she fed the cow to the crocodile.
her passing only days after telling ryan reynolds to “get over her” is fucking legendary. we lost an icon today. rest in peace, betty 🤧🙏🏼
The fact that she passed on new years eve makes it even sadder
99 years and we all still wish we had more of her. When my grandmother passed earlier this year, I said to my family that my sons and I were adopting Ms. White as our new grandmother/ great grandmother.
We miss you.
If ever there was a bad omen for 2022 - it’s losing this woman - she’s irreplaceable and lovely through and through - the world was better with her in it. RIP Queen
Her dying is such a shock.....
😪 You'll be missed dearly, Betty. 💔
I can't believe she's gone! This is just not okay. I'm done like seriously this year is done
My very favorite Betty White moment (somewhat selfishly) was when my Auntie Gloria, who was a film/TV actress, had the opportunity to appear on "The Betty White Show" in 1958 and worked w/ Ms White in a comedy segment and I enjoyed watching the latter in one of her few somewhat "dramatic", straightforward turns as the episode called more-or-less for. (I'm quite certain that it probably doesn't quite compare to anything which she did on "MTM", "GG" or "HIC", but it's my own personal like.)
Rest in peace, gentle soul
The last Golden Girl.  Truly the end of an era.  May she rest well. 😭
😭🥲💔💗
thank you we will miss her soo much
I don't know whether it's good or bad that youtube disabled the dislikes because we'll never know if there was anyone so stupid to dislike this video
The end of an Era, seriously, she's the last of her acting generation.
How is Lake Placid not even an honorable mention? Rest well dear Betty. We love you!
The last of the great ones
She will be remember in our hearts🤩👍😎
She's finally reunited with the other girls eating cheesecake up in heaven rip Betty thank you for being our friend ,,,
God rest Betty White.
RIP Ms Betty White

less commentary
Honestly we have to show respect to comedians who keeps us laughing when we’re hurting The world love you
Fly high Miss Betty
Nooooo! Not Betty!?!?😪🤧😔
RIP BETTY WHITE, YOU WILL BE DEEPLY MISSED AND THANK YOU FOR BEING INSPIRATION TO THE WORLD
R.I.P. Betty White 😭
I don't think anyone in this world. Hated her  everyone loved this woman. But she has joined her love in heven with all the animals she saved.
I always watched The Golden Girls, but another show that came second was the movie Lake Placid. I watch it whenever I see it on. I will dearly miss BETTY'
RIP Betty🙏🌏 you were awesome.  😘
RIP my dearest actress ...I am sad but I know now you are happy with Dorothy, Blanche and Sophie in heaven.
I have loved this woman unconditionally my entire life. I’m a Gen X, so I literally grew up watching her on television. Words could never express my grief and sadness knowing I won’t see her anymore. “What is grief if not love persevering?” I will love you forever, Miss Betty White.
Legendary Betty White ❤❤❤
They was defo sitting on this waiting for her to go
May she rest in peace. Hope goes and joins Dorothy, Blanch and Sophia.
💚❤️‍🔥🙏❤️‍🔥💚
I'm not crying you're crying!
Rest well Betty White, glad I got a chance to witness who you were and what you gave to this world!
I have always loved Betty! She made Lake Placid funny
R.I.P. Betty White, you were a great actress and a great person and a bad ass woman.
Rip Ms. Betty ♡♡
She was so close to 100 😞
Her agent said she died in her sleep.  Am I the only one who finds a bit of sad irony in that ?  Rest in peace,Betty.  I think I speank or everyone whenI say,"We love you."
Rip
Thank you, Rose Nylund, for always being a friend. -Betty White, 1922-2021
💜
God bless you, ma'am! Even God needed a good laugh today. Here's to the Queen of Contestants! The Princess of Parlor Games, the undisputed Champion of Fun with Names... MRS. BETTY WHITE!
My favorite Betty White moments?  ALL OF THEM!!! She will forever be missed 💔
Betty White also voiced an Elderly Woman in The American Version Of 2009 Disney/Myusaki Film Ponyo!
First John Madden!  Now Betty!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The world lost not only a goddess but a beacon on true kindness and love! 😭 RIP Betty White and may you shine as bright a star in the night sky as you have on earth🌟✨
Yall didnt waste no fuckin time with this one
Rest in peace to a legend
how did y’all get this so fast?
She legit lived tf out of life!! 🥺❤️ ugh I will miss her
Not that they were just sitting on this, waiting on her passing….
when she appeared on Diagnosis Murder she play mark sister and she was so funny and the super bowl commerical
Incredible woman and talent rest in peace Betty 🥰❤️🙏🏻
May Betty White Rest In Peace. She will be missed.
Honestly is there anyone in this world that doesn’t like Betty White?  If there is I don’t want to meet them…
RIP Betty. I hope you knew how well-loved you were.
Betty White was a boss and a badass! She was super close to 100 and the New year but I look at it this way; she’s likely in a much better place than we all are and I bet she’s partying in Heaven right now. RIP Betty.
such a shame she missed her birthday. What a reunion will be had up there.
The golden girls are together again🥺🙏🏼❤️
2021 gave us one last kick in the face. RIP Beautiful lady, inside and out 💔💔
I've always told my family that Betty is my spirit animal 🤣 My mom never understood, but my sister's totally understood today when I was crying when I found out. There are some people who just make all this CRAP we're struggling through worth while. Her humor was one of the bright spots out there. It's been a nasty couple years, and losing Betty White in 2021 is just another reason this year sucks balls.
You missed Community as the Anthropology Professor 😢😢😢
It’s official, this is the bad timeline
I've been worried about this day for a few years now. RIP Betty White. Thank you for being a friend. The Golden Girls cast is reunited now.
Rip Betty, thank you for being a friend
What will the WORLD do without her?!?  What a LOSS!!!!
Y'all just couldn't wait to make this huh...
Ich hab sie geliebt! Ruhe in Frieden, liebe Betty <3
America's Greatest Treasure. R.I.P. to a grand lady. ❤️❤️❤️
Descanse en paz Señora Betty.Lo siento mucho.
Go Betty ! You can’t go any high in the sky Betty white😻😺😹🙀
She will forever be remembered for her humorous ways I love u Betty white 🤍 so sad to see u leave us RIP to one of the best of all times
Rest in Peace Betty White.
Such a beautiful soul.
My heart feels a bit bruised and battered to learn of her passing.  I adored this woman, watched every single comedy show she was involved with since the '70s.  I am going to miss her so much.  Betty, may our Heavenly Father welcome you home with a warm and loving embrace, may you reunite with your love, Allen, and may you rest in eternal peace, you will always be loved and missed.
All of them
A true icon 🙌🏿❤️⚜️
Will miss Betty 🥺💖
RIP Betty. We’ll miss you.
1 day before the New Year, and 17 days before her Centennial celebration. R.I.P. beautiful lady. 💐
#ripbettywhite
Her Rose Nylund story about the herring circus is the GREATEST!
Betty White was a wonderful person unfortunately she had passed but she lived a fulfilling life. Betty White didn't need any remarks from the imbecile in the White House who stole it along with his cronies. I know why Betty White died on this particular day she did not want to get a birthday card from Joe Biden that definitely would have killed her...😒
This woman lived a full life and I know she has no regrets we love you golden girl ❤
Wow … Betty White .. you’re amazing . You never saw colour just hearts ♥️ … we love you
the simpsons
I can’t pick just one..
RIP Betty White. (January 17th,1922- December 31st,2021)  Thank you for being a friend.
I say everyone should still send her off with a big bang on her birthday when it comes she deserves it
RIP Betty White!  A true icon in the entertainment industry!  So many great memories. You will truly be missed.
She was quite a looker in her youth huh
This is a GREAT compilation.  I humbly suggest one add-on to the Honorable Mentions: her performance at William Shatner's roast on Comedy Central.  She outshone all the other comedians that nite.
What an incredible life. What an incredible lady. Rest in Peace Golden Girl thankyou for being a friend
The only thing that is bringing me any comfort is knowledge that she's reunited with her husband, and the Golden Girls are all back together. Many well wishes to her surviving family for their loss.
"When Betty White tells you to bring her a cup of coffee, you bring her a f*cking cup of coffee!" Omg, I'm going to miss the F out of this legend! Betty, thank you for all the laughs!
Thank you Betty White, one thousand times. For giving me great laughs..St. Olaf will never be the same😪😙🤗🤭☺😄😁😁😆🤭
This IS EASLEY the best MOJO list I've ever seen, Thank You Betty White, we will miss you 😻
I wanted to be SueAnn Niven when i was a girl.  When i grew up i just wanted to be Betty White.  Still do.  The woman even in death leaves a smile on your face.  Rest in peace Miss White. You will be so damn missed.
Betty in Bringing down the house… she kills me. RIP
I remember ver in an episode of " my wife and kids " which was an homage To Mary poppins
I wanted So much for this news to be a hoax!  😭  She is a national treasure!  Always will be!
Legitimately I'm a cold-hearted bastard but I am actually really sad about this news, I named my first car after her
This is so sad, I wanna cry, because our lovely Betty White is dead,I can't believe it!!!😢😢😢Rest in Peace our favorite Golden Girl, you will be missed😢❤️
Cheers to Betty White and a life well lived!!🥂🍾 Rest In Peace and Power Queen!!! ❤️
She’s more than a Golden Girl. She’s a legendary woman who we will miss her dearly. I still can’t stop the waterfall flowing down my face after hearing this news. May her rest in peace in heaven and reunite with her friends and family. Thank you for being a friend, Betty White. ❤️
My great-grandmother was born the same year as Betty White. But unlike her, who just died today, my great-grandmother died in 1989.
I can think of a million memories of Betty White but the one of her I can recall is the Golden Girls episode where she hits it off with Dorothy’s Friend Jean and Jean falls for her in the show. It was a riot and oh how her character reacted to Jean it was classic. May this woman RIP she lived one hell of a life.
An incredible soul that brought the world laughter and  was a descent human being. RIP Queen!
So sad. Even ven though you know something is coming any time, doesn't mean you have to like it. Prayers for her family.
Betty White was truly a national treasure and will be missed terribly. RIP, you wonderful dame. 💔
May her memory be eternal and let the Lord's perpetual light shine upon her, Amen.  Deepest Sympathy & Condolences to her family & friends.  Regards, Lance. Wm von Uhde, III
Absolute Legend!!! The world has lost an amazing person!! RIP Betty White ❤️💕❤️
Rip angel
OMG u guys were waiting for her death. Lol
Rest in Peace Betty White ❤ it was sad to wake up to the first day of 2022 only to hear of this news, but she is in a better place now, and her legacy will live on forever. ❤
I absolutely loved betty white in the golden girls, hot in cleveland and the mary tyler moore show. This is such a great list. I will miss you so much, rose! 💔💔
It’s so sad to watch this. She was such a bright and positive person in such a bleak world right now. It’s like one last slap in the face from 2021. All I can really say is “thank you for being a friend “.
Her role in Lake Placid should be on this list. It was absolutely hysterical and quite honestly, the only reason to watch that movie.
She was everyone's grandma and will be missed greatly 😔😭
There will never be another Betty white. Rip with your husband.god bless for all you have done
What a legend. May she rest in peace.
Our Golden girl🙏
Just 20 ?
I didn't think 2021 could get much worse.....but it jus did....R.I.P BETTY WHITE....💔
Rest in Peace, Legend, the one and only Betty White.
Y'all had this ready to go huh lmao
My heart hurts today. RIP Betty White. She's had me laughing my entire life.
I was so surprised and saddened 😢 to hear about Betty. I was just reading an article the other day about her career and plans for her 100th in Jan- I thought "she shares my birth month". She was one of my favorites- so many great roles over the years and so funny 😸. She was amazing- lived to 99 and still entertaining, living in her own home and her mind was sharp as always. I'll miss her!!! 💖
Rip miss Betty white 🙏🏾🙏🏾🥳🎊💔💔
Betty will be missed eternally 😢
RIP Betty. We will miss you so so much, no one else like you. 💔💔💔
Shes up there with Dorothy, Blanche and Sophia having some cheesecake and telling a St. Olaf story
2022 is not starting out good! Was not expecting this news today. The world has lost an amazing person. RIP Betty! You will be greatly missed!
Don't forget when Betty was on Conan with Jason Momoa.
Im not one of those people to come around to talk about betty white now that she passed. She was someone you felt would live forever cause how the hell was she still around?!  I thought she had the fountain of youth. When alive she was someone i just saw as a figure anyone could enjoy... honestly, the woman we all should want to grow old with.
I'm glad everyone was getting ready to celebrate her life. Rip Betty!
RIP Betty White, the world was undeniably better for having you in it
RIP Betty. Thank you for entertaining all of us for so long. 💔
NEVER ANOTHER LADY LIKE HER!!! ORIGINAL AND ONE OF A KIND!!!
Golden Girls  Hands down the most hilarious, heartwarming show in the world.
Truly the GOAT...R.I.P to a legend...Betty White
R.I.P. It is crazy, she is gone now. 😔
99
RIP Betty White you will be missed. I personally loved any thing she was in. The frist time I saw her in a movie was Lake Placid. Absolutely the funniest person in the world. Always in our hearts and memories Rest in piece.
An amazing woman. God bless you Betty White for bringing us so many wonderful memories.
The last one...rip legend
In loving memory of Betty White. (January 17, 1922 – December 31, 2021) You will be missed and not forgotten.
you know it’s sad and creepy thinking they definitely pre recorded this and were waiting for her to die to upload this
RIP Betty 🕊️
A wonderful woman with a beautiful hart.💋💋💋💋💋🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🤗🤗🤗
She was and is one of a kind
😭😭😭😭RIP Betty White you’ll be missed by everyone
Every single time she was on Craig Ferguson's show....my god. 🥰🤣😭  I'm still hoping it's a hoax. The woman deserves literal immortality.
Rest in Peace Betty, thank you for being unapologetically YOU❤️ You were a true treasure and a humble and kind human. You always managed to make people smile and feel good, and that in and of itself is one hell of legacy to leave behind❤️
Where was the Ellen clip with Jace Crispin from the Chippendales? That's my most favorite clip of her EVER.
As sad as we are, it's great to know that she's finally back at The Pearly Gates with St. Peter saying, "Hi, Bettyl!  Here's Allan!"
High on the list of…..dinner with ….
Woke up this morning to a world without Betty White. I'm so sad.
Betty White died exactly 8 years to the day after James Avery died.
RIP to a legend
RIP Betty White.
They had to take her right before her 100th
God bless this woman. My mother was the same age and Ms. White was a big inspiration. Unfortunately she passed in 2018 and was looking forward to keeping up with her heroine and reaching 100. From "Mary Tyler Moore" to "Golden Girls," I adored Betty White as much as my mom did.
"im gonna kick some ASS!" xD lol 🤣🤣
Betty White is and will always be a National Treasure. RIP, Betty.
This is so sad but I’m so grateful that she lived until she was 99 and was so funny and iconic
RIP Betty White. We will miss your talent, humanitarian efforts and humor. This planet just lost an amazing person.
Loved Betty…her appearance on Community deserved to be on this list. So funny and she was so into it. Her end credits scene with Troy and Abed is legendary.
Gosh Darn! I was so looking forward to her 100th birthday celebration! Well, we'll have to celebrate still as she smiles down on us! xoxo RIP Ms. Betty!
She was my 2nd favorite classic TV Comedienne with Lucille Ball being #1.  This world is now a MUCH less brighter place!  We will miss you, Betty!  Thank you for being OUR friend!
dusty old muffins SNL
Today we lost one of humanity's greatest treasures. Someone who not only was a a great talent, loved by all other performers but a gracious LADY. Heaven just became a lot funnier. I can just hear Ted Knight saying, "Hey what took you so long!"
Just such a graceful lady, talented and humble. She aged like a queen and left a legacy like one, definitely will be missed.
R.I.P Betty! You were a Gem!
RIP Betty White. Beautiful til the end in so many ways. Always brought smiles and laughter to the world. Our loss is Heavens gain. God bless you.
America's Queen Elizabeth.
Betty White was a legendary she paved the way for strong independent women in the Industry she spoke her mind and didn’t care what people thought of her she will be deeply missed
I can’t smh Happy Home Coming Ms. Berry White
no mention of her role as Catherine Piper in boston legal ? do you even know Betty White??
2021 just HAD to make one last bad thing happen 😕
She will be truly missed.  She was a wonderful human being.
I’m teared up just watching this. Rest In Power Betty White.
We will all miss her
I didn't think was gonna make me cry, but here we are.
Gay life wasn't private, Betty. Activists shove it down people's throats.
☺️❤️🙏🏽 I just love her
I love Betty White!
Betty White was a pioneer for females in comedy, an ally when others were too afraid to show support, and an inspiration for those who felt that they weren't enough. The world has been blessed with her time on this Earth and the legacy she leaves behind will keep her alive in our minds and hearts for years to come. You truly understood the assignment. Rest in Heaven Betty White 💕
My favorite moment is the Herring War scene from Golden Girls. Watched it at least a dozen times today already. 99 and still gone too soon. RIP and thank you for being our friend.
Greetings from barbados 🇧🇧, she was a true lady. R.I.P.
Goodnight Sweet Rose 😭💔
R-I-P GRAND LADY R-I-P YOU WILL BE MISSED AND THANK YOU FOR THE MEMORIES ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The most heart breaking news today I still can't believe it rip she was an angel on earth and now she has her wings fly high beautiful soul we love you!!
God bless her. We were fortunate to have her. Rest in God's loving embrace.
The woman crushed it at life, everyone loved her, and to lose such a comedic and humanitarian treasure so close to her centennial is unjust. RIP Ms. White.
We all know it was time, but we weren't ready, I guess we never would be though huh?
Forgot Rue McClanahan was on mamas family... awesome show
Bold and Beautiful
RIP Pretty lady 😘
Oh my gosh, when did she die? I had no idea or clue that she passed away until I got off work at the Goodwill store at 7:00 pm.
The world is much sadder with her gone😭❤
lmao
I loved Betty White and Rue McClanahan on Mama’s Family too ..they don’t mention that like they do everything else…
She was a national treasure! R.I.P Betty White, you will be missed forever..😭❤️
Betty White a National  Treasure . I hope a tribute is done to honor such a fine woman who was groundbreaking  for the INDUSTRY she loved. A SAD 🌙 to start a New Year the heavens just got another  🌟.
She will always be my golden girl r.i.p an amazing woman
Groundbreaking, legendary and phenomenal. These are a few words that describe this amazing woman. Betty White, Thank you for being a friend! 2 good 2 be 4gotten. RIP BETTY WHITE 🙏 😢 💔 😪
Thank you for posting this sooner, we needed it today
My dad did her yard.  I love her sorry for our loss. Greatful for memories.
Bittersweet to have found this tonight after learning of Betty's passing today. My heart is broken all over again
RIP Betty White. Such a bright light. She will be sadly missed by so many. She was one of a kind and there will never be another.
My favorite moment for Betty White was when she kicked pain pills on Golden Girls.  She took it out on everyone else!  She's awesome when she plays hateful!
Betty White could have avoided this and gotten her bonus years if she ate more broccoli. 12 minutes for every piece she would have ate.
Betty White is our national treasure.
She will be missed!!
Don't have a favorite - all are great!
The world is a lot less brighter without your laughter and love! RIP Betty White!
I am sad. The USA's grandma has passed away.  😢 Fade to black
😭💔😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💋💋💋💋😪😪✝️🙏✝️🙏...I love you Betty White God bless you💋💋💋💋
There will never be another Betty White. RIP
She almost made it to 100. She will be missed.
I heard she passed away today at new year eve
Kind weird y’all prepared this video for her death
20 isn't enough. Is there anyone better at being great as a character as well as just being herself?
Her super bowl commercial was so funny
The goofy movie where she’s said something like “ this is where if I were a man, I’d tell you to suck my dick” rotf
Well that's more than just a bummer. Always loved the Golden Girls when I was a kid and Betty White when I saw her anywhere on TV.
Barely touched the surface on her greatest moments. Everything she did was pure comedic genius, she had great timing.
RIP Betty White  Betty showed both wide-ranging humour and unending kindness in her life. We may have wished for Betty to live forever, but she truly does: her comedy and legacy will live on in everyone who knows or will know about her.
I’m not crying you’re crying… what a icon and tbh a crap way to end the year.
I loved it when she played Grandma Bunny in "You Again" and she will be missed.
Rip Betty ducha a great lady!! Now she will entertain in heaven.
RIP you legendary icon!❤️❤️❤️
You will be missed.
R.I.P sweetheart 💕 you will be greatly missed oxo
R.I.P . Miss . Betty 12/31/21 to 1/17/22
May Betty rest in peace.
The Last Golden Girls leave us...😭😭😭😭😭
Rest in Peace Betty..we will always love you❤️
I actually loved Betty the most on The Match Game. You can’t help but love her. Quick witted, adorable and always seemed like she was having fun! I could watch it all day.
The world is a Lil colder and darker today. The world if fucked from this point on.
What a gal..she will be missed. Thank you for making us all laugh LOL
Really going to miss you, Betty.
So sad... 😭!  Betty White was truly a PRECIOUS HOLLYWOOD COMEDIC GEM! - R.I.P.  Betty🌹!
Completely ruined my 2021. I wanted so bad for her to make 100

I can’t believe she passed away 😭💔

Such an amazing person. You know you are well respected when all her peers talk highly of her from young to old.
God Bless Betty White
Beloved Betty…… a national treasure!  You will be deeply missed….. ❤️
Golden girls Is always my number 1!!! I love rose and I love betty white
It tickles 🤗 me, how she would cuss 🤬, and really she didn’t give a ? I love her and she will be missed always!!!! She spoke her mind, and she didn’t care, if she pissed 😤 someone off, or not!!! That’s what made her the woman , she was!!!!!! It’s time for u to be able to visit family members and friends in heaven!!!! Make Heaven Much Happier, With U Up There 👆!!!!! Amen 🙏!!!
Now I’ll never get the recipe for her Dusty muffin
There will never be another like her! I’ll never forget when she hosted SNL and absolutely stole the show in each sketch!
While watching this video, I cried she had such an amazing career but not only that she was a wonderful person. It is sad that she was so close to her 100th birthday then this happened. May she rest in peace 🙏🏼♥️
I honestly thought she would live forever. RIP
First thing I thought wen seeing this list was "No it can't be." Well second thing was going to Google.  R.I.P
Could you please make a video related to Disney & PIXAR’s Turning Red next?
RIP Betty White!
I love the fact that she lived in a normal average house in a normal neighborhood not a crazy Hollywood mansion,she was so relatable.
RIP Betty White! She's one of my favorite people in the world. She was such a unique and hilarious person. She is definitely a legend.❤
She was a natural treasure
My 15 year old daughter is a huge fan of the Golden Girls, especially Betty White. She even got the DVD for Christmas. Such a sad way to end 2021. R.I.H.
She will be very missed indeed🤯
She is truly one of the OG's of comedy. Her immortality in the hearts of others is well deserved.
No one told a story like Rose or was as sassy as Elka. Thanks for the memories Betty❤️
Heartfelt sincerest condolences to the sudden passing away of Mrs Betty White, an iconic influential actress entertainer heroine of the LGQBTI rainbow community; quintessential humanitarian, funny hilarious champion of a myriad of worthy causes. Not a wonderful start to the New Year 2022 but hand on heart she would light & fill a room with charisma kindness and compassion. She was unique truly one of a kind of her illustrious generation.May your light & beam shine eternally in Heaven as it has illuminated myself & touched & affected so many peoples lives, an iconic influencer who will be sorely missed, tears streaming down my face & heart of hearts, go gracefully & graciously in the eternall loving Name of Our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ AMEN😍🤗🤩👌👍🙏👄💖💕💓❤💘💜🧡💛💚💙💗💌❣💟💞💝💋💘
I am actually incredibly sad
Betty White reminds me a lot of my grandma. She spoke her mind, didn't care what others thought what people said, but did it any way. She truly is a Golden Girl. Also, me and my grandma both loved cheesecake, and often talked about problems over them. Betty White and Golden Girls really helped make a difference in our lives and plan to pass that on to my younger generations. Long live Betty's legend.
As a 26 year old man Betty was always a pleasure to see. RIP :(
I was excited to watch this but it's way too much narrative and not enough Betty! Just show the clips!
Betty we will love you forever ❤. You were the best.
True legend!! RIP
Nothing beats Rose in the dance marathon 🤣😂😅🥀
At least she’s reunited with the golden girls in heaven
God rest her soul
Goodbye Betty! What a legend! A true Golden Girl!
Nothing good lasts forever 😭  I'll miss you Betty rest in peace...
R.I.P Betty  White Thank you for everything and you will be greatly missed
There are no words. That’s all. No. Words. RIP Betty.
Crazy that she's gonna be 100 next year. She's gonna out live us all
We miss you already Betty White
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
A sweet lady and AN ICON. SHE WILL BE MISSED
One of my favorite Betty White's movie scene was in Lake Placid. When she said "If I had a (expletive) this is where I'll tell you to suck it."
*I just now got the extremely sad news that our sweet and amazing Betty has passed today😥! Now, naturally, we get sad and upset when ppl pass but ... this lady here... she was one of our best and an angel while with us... so now, she has just leveled up and gained her wings! This lady here is the kinda person that we all should idolize and try to be more like!! She will be so sadly missed! But we're blessed to have had her presence as long as we have!! Rest in peace Betty!!*
Rest In Peace Betty. Never will you be forgotten.
I never met someone that doesn't like Betty White. She's was an amazing woman. A true icon!

We all know nobody lives forever, but some people just never live enough. What a great woman and great comedian.
I Kinda Wanted Her to Outlive Us All
Only hours after her death. Using it to increase your views, shame on you.
Damn... new years keep getting sadder and sadder 😔
Thanking you
this news broke me a little bit. i'm happy she had such a long and amazing life, but the world just won't be the same without her  RIP, you beautiful, hilarious legend. thank you for being a friend 💕
Wow!  I just mentioned Betty White in my most recent video as an inspiration to all.  I thought she would reach 100. for sure.
She will be missed but always remembered !! RIP Betty White.
She is the best!!
my favourit Betty moment was her scene around the fire pit with Sandra in the proposal
She was one-of-a-kind she'll be missed
Betty White has been and will always be a national treasure. She's a legend 💜🖤 She will be missed 🥰
She was a legend of a actress. No one will ever be able to get even close to what she did in her life. She was my favorite actress.R.I.P. Betty you will be missed.
Lake Placid is my favorite of her movie appearances.
RIP Betty White!! One thing missing from this list is the “Clueless” spoof she did!!!
Gezz, the new of betty whites death I thought was a hoax on reddit. Unfortunately it was. Betty White was a national fucking treasure and thanks for putting this up of such short notice. Fuck 2021, it had one last nasty surprise for us.
I feel like I just lost a grandma. 😢
She was afraid of NOTHING!!!
We're so lucky to have had her around for such a long time. I'm sad that she didn't make it to her 100th birthday.
She was my birthday twin. We were suppose to share milestones. Her 100 and me 21. This is just unreal.
The last heartbreak of 2021….you will be missed soo much. Thanks for getting me into acting and being able to connect with so many friends over “golden girls”. You’ll never be forgotten and will be a idol for many years for little girls also
She was the bomb in Lake Placid.
"Hello Betty, here's Allen"
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 We will miss her. I love Betty. She was my idol.
Rest In Peace Sweet Lady! Thank u so much for making my childhood that much better! I love u
RIP
Thank you for being a friend Betty, RIP
And she was set to have her big 100 soon…  R.I.P. Betty White, we’ll all miss you 😭❤️❤️❤️
Betty White, one of the All-Time Greatest Female TV Comedians in TV History. She made countless generations of people laugh for almost 80 years, from Life with Elizabeth, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Golden Girls, to Hot in Cleveland. We thank you and love you for the many laughs you brought to us for decades. Rest in Peace, Queen!!
Thanks Betty for your warm heart and laughter
I'm so sad I'll miss you
🙏🕯️💔
R.I.P BETTY WHITE..... MY FRIEND EVEN NAMED HER CAR AFTER THIS LADY
I do feel that she was the most loved and respected people to ever exist in the entertainment industry, worldwide
Rest In Peace Betty White I wish we got to celebrate your 100th birthday 😔💐
The lights got dimmer today, hearts got heavier, a tears became floods,  this golden girl has left the hood.  Thanks for laughs, and tears over the years. You will always be in Americas heart. And if anything has brough this nation together today it is our lose of this bright light.
I think my favorite was when she did the metal version of "Thank you for being a friend"
Her getting rose to say that's a hard act to follow
Wait for us on the other side betty
It hasn’t even been 24 hours and I miss the shit out of this perfect woman. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I actually wanted to met her in person :( now I’ll never get the chance too
RIP Betty White you were a member of all our families we will love and miss you so much ❤️
The world has lost one of its brightest stars!  RIP Ms. White, you were universally loved the world over.
Rest in peace, Betty White!
You kept us laughing for years.  Thank you.   RIP,  Betty White.
I’m doing my best not to cry! I believe Miss White wouldn’t want the world crying for her but to celebrate her! So I’m gonna continue to try to not shed a tear for Americas Grandma … but dammit, it’s pretty damn hard 🥺
The last good thing about America! Gone.
Amazing lady. What a life. Who plays her in the biopic movie?
What the fuck, how are you guys fast
When I was about 5 years old, I appeared on the Al Jarvis TV show in Los Angeles where Betty White was the sidekick. It was a live show, and she also did the commercials. I was picked out of the audience to eat a piece of Langendorf Bread on cue but at the moment she told the camera "Everyone Loves Langendorf Bread!" and the camera turned to me, I refused. My mom had always told me not to take things from strangers and so I said no. After a few seconds of trying to coax me, she finally gave up and turned to the camera to say, "Well ALMOST everyone loves Langendorf Bread."  About a dozen years ago, I write her a letter reminding her of the incident long ago and to my surprise she wrote back, saying she remembered the moment, and reminding me "it was okay now to eat my Langendorf Bread!" I don't know if she really remembered or was just being polite, but I had her note framed and gave it to my mom for her birthday a few years before she died. It was one of my mom's treasured memories.  RIP, Betty!  I will eat a sandwich i your honor tonight.
I liked her in the golden girls franchise
RIP Betty!
Thank you for being a friend Betty you will truly be missed
Shared to my FB feed with the caption. "This goddess among mortals will be missed". My favourite BW moment is the quote about being tough. "Grow a vagina, those things take a pounding".
Love Betty White so much
I cried when I found out she passed the same way when I lost my mom three years ago . The world has lost a talented , beautiful and sweet lady . R.I.P. Betty . 😭😭
RIP Betty White. Thank you so much MsMojo for this tribute :(
RIP. Betty White. To a great actress and a great person ❤. Sending prayers for her family and friends 🙏.
Vale to an entertainment an comedic legend - 2021 was a horrible year - it's official - it took our 'golden girl' just days before her 100th birthday :)
Rest well, Betty. Thank you for generations of comedy and joy. The world is a little less bright without you and 2022 will be a little less joyous, but we will always have the memories (and YouTube clips) of your amazing, legendary, well deserved career and life ❤💔
Day of mourning to a true Legend! New years eve will never be the same...
RIP Betty White :( I can’t even believe it. I had to search and make sure it was real. 17 days before you turned 100.  You’re so loved. You’re going to be so damn missed.
Jolie, the leg! (Hot in Cleveland)
Thank you Betty white for being not just a friend, but a legend 😢😭🙏❤️❤️❤️. #RipBettyWhite
It's almost like you guys had this video ready
Seriously, “black singer”
"Why do people say "grow some balls"? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding."  -Betty White, a true legend
I have been full on crying for hours, this one hurts… what a gut punch to end 2021 on 😢
RIP Betty White. What a legend ❤
😔😔😔
#RIPBettyWhite
R.I.P., Betty White!
The world lost a legend. Thank you for being a friend 🖤
Loved her since forever…TV is a little dimmer since she left…her humor, her smile, her love was a beacon which we all followed for years…
The world lost an incredible icon today. Those elitist in Hollywood can never live up to this woman’s stature. She was too good for them.
"Do you prefer being called ....or satan's mistress?🤣😂🤣
I sit here on New Year's Eve finding myself totally and completely gutted. I don't actually believe I've ever been hit so hard by a celebrity death before. Why do the best ones have to be taken from us. I gain comfort in the fact that she had a very long and beautiful life that generations after us will remember. RIP Betty White. We will love you forever.
Her battles with Eunice are classic
She was right. It's their personal life.
I can't believe she's gone. What a treasure ❤️
Oh come on 2022, can’t you at least give us a break from 2021? Apparently not because you just HAD to take Betty White.
Keep moving on she said that.
I'm so sad to hear the news. Rest in Eternal Peace Betty you've made me laugh and cry at the same time. My Condolences to her family and friend's.🙌❤😭
Not a good Outlook of 2022. Fck
I loved it, when Betty White was the voice of Grandma Sophie from the wild thornberrys.
Damn, y'all are fast!
R.I.P Betty ❤
R.I.P Betty. I've had so much fun in you. Fantastic years. My deepest condolences to your undoubtedly beautiful family. Kind regards Kobus the Netherlands😭
The worlds grandma. Rest in peace Betty💔
All of love and respect to our last Golden Girl. May she rest in peace.
She will be missed. What a queen she was 👑😭
You shall be missed terribly by generations of people.  What a way to end this terrible year with more terrible news. 😭😭😭😭❤️‍🩹💔
I can't believe she's dead. RIP Betty.
rip to betty white :( you absolute angel, we love you so much and i hope you’re having a ball of a time up in heaven, my love <3
Fly high, goddess. You're in good company.
God Bless Betty White. There never has been nor will anyone else be as loved as she still is.  R.i.p. my heroine
RIP Betty White you were an absolutely beautiful soul and funny as hell God bless you our forever golden girl
That was quick, they just announced her passing. 😔😔😔 R.I.P Betty White our Golden Girl Forever
You know, once we were taping Match Game ’75, Nipsey Russell, Brett Summers and I, and we were hanging out at Gene Rayburn’s house, and Nipsey says, “Lou, where does the joy come from?” And I said, “It comes from my blank and it blanks from my blank!” And Betty White laughed so hard, her b00b fell out!
Look at it this way we were lucky to have her she will be missed
RIP Betty White. One of my favorite moments was her on "Inside the Actor's Studio", when James Lipton asks her, "finally, if heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?" Her response, "come on in Betty, here's Allen," referring to her beloved husband, Allen Lunden. I truly hope that this happened for her.
Rip to the most consistent person ever. She always stood by her beliefs and was a sweetheart doing it. Always completely hilarious in everything she did.
I’m so sad. 😭 I will miss her so much. May she Rest In Peace
No other has inspired so many generations! I'm so sad right now. Like the world just became darker. And it's pouring rain now,  like the world is crying. Thank you Betty, for everything you gave us humans and animals. You are truly going to be missed. 😭❤
RIP Betty White 🙏 😢 💔
RIP Mrs White
I can't believe she's gone.
I felt a slight pain hearing of her passing..... her small roles on That 70's Show and My Name Is Earl were my personal favorites. Her role in the Super Bowl commercial was absolutely awesome. She is such a bright soul and the world will be a lesser place without her. Goodbye Betty Marion White Ludden, we love you tons ❤
Betty White will be will missed!
No Words just 🌹🌹🌹🌹
thank you for publishing this today as a tribute. God bless and we miss her!
Betty White was Beautiful and Funny and she lived a long life

as if 2021 wasn’t bad enough it said fuck y’all I ain’t done yet these past two years can go to hell   RIP Betty White
I thought she would outlive us all! She's immortal in my mind! RIP Betty!
"I'm such a whore, I can't say no." That's my favorite moment.
I remember watching Password on tv when I was little. Her husband hosted the show. They are together now.
This keeps making me laugh before I get too sad, which I guess is what she would've wanted.
rest in peace angel :(

I just thank the beloved and most high saviour and Lord that Miss Betty White did not suffer a most violent and vicious death nor pain and suffering what I am reading she was in good health fell asleep but never regained consciousness I believe it's natural causes. RIP beloved madam beloved Miss Betty White
We were just talking about her, sad about hearing her passing.
Not sure why but I truly liked her in Lake Placid.  It's really very difficult to narrow down her performances to one role
Nothing gold can stay
We flipping love you Betty
Betty White was one of the brightest stars on and off the screen. Rest in Peace, you will always be our golden girl.
Our Princess Diana. G.O.A.T

I've never taken someone who I didn't know personally death so personal! RIP to America's grandmother.
The Golden Age of Television is officially closed. The good news is God and his angels will be in a much better mood thanks to her by the time some of the rest of us kick the bucket. Rest in peace grand lady, you were the best. Your reunion with Allen will be glorious.
5:44 Shows how much of a champion she was. Back in those days, this could have been career suicide.
i met her only on short appearances, even, her death hit hard. Just for knowing the history. RIP
Rest In Peace Betty. Thank YOU for being our friend...man and animal alike.
I can't believe this. I was so looking forward for her to turn 100 and celebrate. But now it can't happen. I remember loving her acting as Grammy Norma in "The Lorax."
Great job! Ms.White-the best one liners 99 is just as g o o d as 100❤ty

No one is the history or media or comedy comes close to Betty White. In a man's world she made it look easy to overcome and not only make a name for herself, but had everyone in America and around the world falling in Love with her, no matter what her age. A legend like no other. She will be missed.
I just finished watching this clip with my wife. We started watching Golden Girls (for me re-watching for the first time since I was  a kid) and it still holds up. We are both so sad. What a true American icon and treasure. I will miss Betty White forever. She truly lived her life to the fullest
Millions of people are shook currently the amount of love the world has for this woman is unimaginable and indescribable. To end 2021 without betty white is definitely not how anyone wanted to see this going. Much love to her family anyone reading this, i hope you can find joy in the days to come.
QUEEN 👑👑👑
You should have saved it for what would have been her birthday. As much as she was loved by all, using her death for likes and views is a bit disgusting.
This was the first time I wanted the media to be lying when reporting. Going to miss this woman.
We all knew Betty White deserved to see 100 years. I rarely saw clips of her in "Golden Girls" and I've been looking her up every once in a while for quite sometime. It's a doggone shame that her chance to be 100 years old in two weeks sadly isn't going to happen. It's just so sad I can barely stand it. May her 99-year-old soul rest in peace.
I am devastated. She is...yes, IS...still an inspiration and proof that aging is not a bad thing!
Such an incredible person. She will be missed by so many people. Rest in peace Betty.
Betty whites birthday is January 17th. I do have her shows and movies I do need more of her tv series and movies I do use to watch some shows also. This more heart broken news I ever heard of like OMG 😱 I don’t do death it comes from Hollywoods famous star 🌟 golden girls lives on with me for life. I I’m going literally look up her legacy. Betty you got my love 😍 I’m fan of you my sweetheart friend
How the fuck did they get this out so fast
She was an absolute treasure. We are so fortunate to have her make us laugh for all of these years. Betty, thank you so very much... and you will be sorely missed.
What a wonderful sweet person she was, she will live on far beyond our fading memories.
Thank you for creating this. Betty will be sorely missed.  😭

She was so close to her 100 birthday RIP Golden Girl Forever
Why am I crying so much for a celebrity....  only Juan Gabriel and Robin Williams had me crying this much...
I can't believe the sweet beloved Betty White passed away, I was almost about to cried, Jerry Stiller the best man passed away, and now Betty White passed away, the legends fade away slower and slower. 😥😥😥😔😔😔💔💔💔
I will miss you 🪦and I ❤️Ed you
What a joy she was!
SNLs muffin skit
Was hoping they had included that 70s show but she had done so many amazing things how can you fit them all? RIP Betty the Legend

The most awesome woman in showbiz! The brightest star in the entertainment galaxy! I'm pretty brokenhearted! Too many memorable moments to count!! RIP Betty. I'll always have Golden Girls.
I'm crying and my best friend is in denial.  We clearly have top notch coping skills 😥
Actually, didn’t know she passed until I saw this and honestly didn’t believe it. Had to go check. Rest In Peace with your husband sweet Betty!!! 😭
RIP Legend!
A comedic queen ❤❤ RIP
Finally, good riddance!

Rip. This upload was fast tho.
Wow, I didn't know Betty White can sing, that makes me love her more and more. 😄😄😄❤❤❤💯💯💯
RIP Betty. You will be missed.
I thought she was hilarious as the old lady who fed the gators who ate in her husband in "Lake Placid"
RIP Betty White. So close to 100 Years Old… So close.
To a woman who was a genius and a true animal champion. You can finally be with Allen. St Olaf’s favourite daughter you will be sorely missed!
I’m heartbroken
The world lost a one of a kind person today! We'll never see her like again! Rest in peace doll!
Loved her in Lake Placid
Celebrate her life..don’t Mourn her passing. She had as full a life as anyone could hope for.  And she had no fear of passing. She believed she would be reunited with Allen Ludden. And so do I. Godspeed Beautiful.
I know I'm not the only one who was counting down the days till she turned 100. She was 18 away.
We miss you so much already Betty, you were such a light on the world that will never go out even a century later
R.I.P. Betty White. You will most certainly be missed!

Today she sadly past Goodbye betty white you've brought us and our family so many good memories
We've lost a very very special person in the world. But she lived a very very full life and was a very happy woman I'm sure to the end
How was this video made so fast... Holy shit this channel knows how to milk anything.
Crazy true. Rafio before tv. She went thru it ALL.
stay golden betty💛
One of the last genuinely wonderful people this world had.  I was in the USAF in the ‘80s, I remember all these “tough” military guys would get together in the barracks and watch The Golden Girls.  She crossed all lines and was universally loved.  Rest well ma’am, we love you!
my fav Betty White moment gota be the sneakers commercial where she says “That’s not what your girlfriend said”
My favorite Betty White moment, from the movie Lake Placid……“I’m rooting for the crocodile, I hope he swallows your friends whole” RIP 💜
I feel like Betty trolled everyone by leaving before she turned 100. love her! RIP Betty!
God bless her she was the best. RIP wonderful lady. ❤️ 2021
And you didn't even mention Allen Ludden...sheesh...lol.
I'm heartbroken.   This year couldn't be any worse
We need more Betty White's in the world! She will truly be missed 😞❤️
A beautiful tribute to the most Loved Woman in the world! Thank you!
Thank you for being a friend :(
Funny. Classy. Humanist. Animal rights and civil rights activist who took the high ground even when it went against popular opinion. Thank you, Betty, for your amazing talent and for being an amazing human.
RIP. Thank you for being a friend.
Where were you when you found out? I was working with my cousin and my dad texted me the news and my cousin and I ran around like a war had just begun
Rest in peace Betty, you will forever be a national treasure.
What a legend and national treasure! She lived a long and happy life.
Ryan Reynolds is the male Betty White in terms of comedy style. That's why they clicked so well. She will be missed.
Rest In Peace Betty White. Thanks for the memories and laughs
We lost an icon. This legend will never be replaced. RIP Betty
Prayers 2 Ms. Betty White❣❣❣❣🙏🏾🤍
For a Golden Girl knows when He’s kissed her, its the kiss of Death.
Thank you for being a friend betty!! RIP
RIP TO THE GOAT!!! I'll be watching The Golden Girls until I am one and beyond 💜
Years ago Betty did an interview and when asked if she feared death, she shared a story that her mom told her.  Betty's mom told her that when she died she will be in on the secret.  Somewhere out there Betty is reunited with her husband and her family and now she knows the secret.   RIP Betty.  Your life here was remarkable and we will all miss you terribly.
You guys had this ready huh
A beautiful tribute...somehow the world is a little more dark today
Rest in peace, may you be reunited with your golden girls in heaven and having cheesecake. You're back in St. Olaf now xxx
It's like robin williams again
Not until watching this i realize how much she did prior to the golden girls
RIP, Betty White a.k.a. Rose!
Can’t believe she is gone! Will miss her dearly
One of my favorite moments aside from MTM, and Golden Girls was in Lake Placid, watching her cuss and feed that gator was enough to make me wheeze with laughter.
Rest In Peace. You were truly one of a kind ❤️
She was a legacy. She will be greatly missed. We all can learn from her optimism in life.
Betty white 🤍 oh no such a sad day....😥 RIP she will be missed so much 😶
R.I.P. Betty White (1922-2021)
This is insanely distasteful. Betty White just died and the vultures over at WatchMojo see it as an opportunity to capitalize.  How do you all still fall for this ??
Why, God, Why?  She was supposed to live forever.  Everyone raise your glass with me.
One of my favorite Betty White moments was in the movie "Lake Placid" (I believe) when she told someone "This is the part, if I had a Dy k, I would to you to such it" that was GOLD.  RIP Mrs Betty White, you will be greatly missed!!!  Your where truly a clasd act,, unlike all the trash in Hollywood these days.
Grandmas boy would have been a great one to throw in
The great Betty White has died.....hard to believe this is true....rest in peace....thank you for all the years of laughter and joy!
RIP to the great Betty White, So often Mojo trolls its lists to be controversial, but you got this right on.  Betty deserves it.
RIP Betty
RIP Betty, you will  be missed
Betty Rocked!!💖💖💖💖💖💖
She was The Master of comedic timing. Phenominal.
funny enough, my Great Grandmother was Louisa Jane Baskerville!  LOL
Miss you Betty, so much :(
i’m heartbroken.
Is it just me or did they pump this out mighty fast after she passed. Like maybe wait a day or so….
Even though she’s dead I’m grinning ear to ear thinking about her. I doubt she’d mind. R.I.P Legendary Betty White.
The golden girls reunited in heaven
RIP Betty. Was looking forward to your Birthday Celebration. What a blessing to live 99 almost 100 years. I think I'll bring the new year in watching my favorite sitcom. Thank you for a being friend. ♥️
...thank you for being a friend
This woman was such a classy, witty, funny etc..I could go on and on! Rest in peace Betty, you've lived a long and prosperous life which was GREATLY deserved!
Can't believe she passed away today(Dec 31st 2021).
Betty was the coolest bitch ever.  Rest well, Betty.
How could anyone seen her as less of the best example of humanity?
R.I.P I just I can’t believe she’s gone 😔
Heaven got a beautiful angle! You will be truly missed we love you! My heart & prayers are with all of her live ones! Rip to a beautiful & amazing woman who shared all of her talent with us all!
I just hate this. I hoped we'd get to celebrate her birthday with her. RIP to such a legend.
Her hosting Saturday Night Live is the funniest ever!!!!
R.I.P. legend 😭
rip bro
Worth this was a tribute video
Rest In Peace Betty White.
Thank you for all the joy and laughter that you bring to us, Betty. The world will miss you dearly. RIP
RIP Betty.
My favorite Betty White moment is when Donny Osmond sang Puppy Love to her.
To the woman everyone wanted to live forever. RIP Betty White. Thanks for the decades of laughter. You will not be forgotten.
Rest in the Sweetest Peace, Betty!
Ugh, I so wanted her death to be a hoax but RIP Betty White and thank you for all the laughs you provided for me and my grandma watching The Golden Girls together when I was a child.

R. I. P legend
Dang y’all was fast let her rest for a second ❤️🥺
Rest in Peace Legend
Thanks for compiling this! Even those of us who have seen ALL of her Golden Girls episodes and SNL appearances probably don't know about most of her other TV appearances. She was definitely a treasure, and a steadfast advocate for equality.  RIP, Betty. 💛🧡❤💜
She will be so missed....she was one of a kind
RIP Betty white. You will be missed.
“What happens when there’s one of us left?”   She lives as an icon and nearly makes it to 100… RIP Betty. Go enjoy some cheesecake with the girls.
I also remember watching Betty White on episodes of Mama's family when I was a kid growing up in the 90s
A true American legend. She will be missed. She made me laugh a lot of times
A Sad end to a sad year.
The Grandmother of all of America. RIH (rest in Heaven). I think I know she died from, the same as my own grandmother in summer 2016. Natural Causes of Old Age, nothing wrong with her body, it just couldn't produce more things to keep her going, so technically Betty's body just shut down. Like a light bulb doesn't burst, but dims down until its out.
I'm sitting here crying like a baby.  I have loved Betty White for the past six decades, and I will miss her dearly.  I really wish she could have made it to her 100th birthday (just a few weeks away).  But what a spectacular life and career she has had.  Her talent, generosity, intelligence and razor-sharp wit unparalleled.
Mine is from The Golden Girls when she would talk about stories in St Olaf and St. Olaf Scandinavian sayings
The first lady of TV
Rip Betty you'll be missed but never forgotten
Now all the four Golden girls are finally together again in heaven and having fun and laughing together again
She was so close 😪
I have the entire complete series of Hot in Cleveland going to miss her so 😢
Rest in peace Betty White!! She was such a lovely, caring and beautiful woman. I am so saddened over her death, the few movies I watched her in always made me laugh, it's a shame I could never meet her.
RIP My Golden Girl.  She'll be in my heart forever.
Thank you, Betty.
Betty White was in the 1999 movie lake placid about an Gator eating people and animals and she was also guest starred in an episode of My wife and kids as the maid and Nanny
Truly such a force to be reckoned with. I’ll miss her dearly
Loved her💕 miss her already

Betty White transcended generation. She was an entertainer well-known and respected and loved by everyone, regardless of age. That, alone, is a remarkable achievement for someone whose life spanned eighteen presidential administrations.
The world has lost one of our natural wonders...we love you Betty ❤️

Betty was one of a kind. So Lovely, Smart, Amazing, and of course Funny. Definitely lost a Very Special person today. Gonna miss you, RIP Betty. You will always be loved and cherished.

Rip Betty White
Rest In Peace Betty White! Thank you for always being a friend.
What a legend
Rest In Peace Betty White 😢thank you for all the humorous memories ❤️
R.I.P. Betty White ~ What a shock that she passed away today (12/31/2021) at the age of 99. Only weeks from celebrating her 100th birthday! She was our National Treasure. She blessed us all with her quick humor and her rememberable characters. May she make all the angels and God laugh thunderously and smile brightly in Heaven.
Just a couple weeks ago I saw a post about her planning her 100th birthday 🎉 what a shame 🙈🙈
I mean honestly passing New Years Eve right before her 100th birthday that everyone was obsessed with is totally on brand for her humor. She was a true Legend. RIP Betty White, you will be missed by all
😭💔 Good bye, sweet Betty. So long, for now. 12-31-21. 🙏🏼😇🕊
I'm 13 but I luv Betty she is so amazing and she was such a humble person we love you Betty we will never forget you R.I.P Betty 💔❤
I guess 2021 had one last middle finger to throw us before it's behind us forever...

Rest In Peace, Betty White. You will always be amazing.
WE LOVE YOU MS. BETTY!!! You will be sorely missed. Truly America's Sweetheart. You will forever be my celebrity grandma.
it’s so sad that her very last tweet was her being so excited for her 100th bday :( it’s so sad that we lost her, even though i don’t really know her i hope she’s resting peacefully
That crazy she had her big breakthrough well into her 30’s!
My idol 😢❤️
I can’t think of anyone else in recent memory that was so universally beloved. The world is a slightly darker, less happy place without you Betty.
I’m crying bc she died -
A true Icon gone. You just couldn't argue with logic given in her style.
Betty, Thank you for being a friend!
She just enters a show for one episode and we want her to be on it forever 🔥
Betty White in Community is my favorite
I'm surprised at how quickly you put this together.
She really did have an amazing and full life, I just wish she had a few more weeks to celebrate a full century of her legendary life surrounded by everyone close to her. At least she is at peace now with her late husband and the many friends and family members she must have loved and lost in her time.
R.I.P. legend
Seventeen days before what would have been her 100th birthday😢
Sue Ann Nivens--loved the character!
In all honesty you guys, I think she was happy to have passed. She now gets to be with the love of her life, Allen Ludden ♥️. Thank you Betty 🙏
Thank you for being a friend, Betty White.
She was around and full of life very recently. How sad. Thank you, Betty, for years of tears of 😃
On SNL. The muffin scene and her ‘version’ of the GG theme song. Priceless!!!
I still can't believe she's gone.
Betty White was a legend. Movies should be made about her, books should be written about her. No one should forget her. She was amazing.
Currently at the hospital and my nurse and I shared our old souls that love Golden Girls. We joked and I said, "there are three things that will survive the apocalypse.  Roaches, Cher and Betty White." Then an hour later my nurse came in and said she died. We've both been crying because we were just talking about her...
Damn did yall know before cbs
The Golden Girls are together again. Rest in Peace, Betty
She was our last golden girl, can't believe she's gone
2021 literally said “Before I go, I’m taking something of yours” RIP Betty White, you absolute LEGEND
RIP BEAUTIFUL ANGEL. THE OG AMERICAN DREAM. QUEEN. PAVED THE WAY FOR SO MANY. 👼🏻🤍
Rest in peace you absolute angel, I hope you're enjoying your cheesecake on the lanai with Rue, Estelle, and Bea

Rest In Peace Betty White, we love you even if we are not with you ❤️❤️❤️
Rip the most funniest Female actor of all time
I'm so upset. Im wearing my GG tshirt, i have all the seasons on dvd and games. I was superstitious when People did the 100th birthday article. I know everything is in God's timing but this hurt. To not see 2022 and year 100... 💔😭
Omigosh was in hysterics last night watching her in "The Proposal" with Ryan Reynolds & Sandra Bullock, that was a joy to start off a nice long holiday weekend ❤😂👍🏻
Who? That's Rose Nyland from St Olaf, Minnesota.
rest in peace betty, i loved her humour
Seeing Betty White always fills me with joy and laughter. Her hosting Saturday Night Live was one of my absolute favorites.❤️ Rest in Peace Betty.😭😭😭❤️💜💗

Broken hearted rn

If you are feeling down no matter the age, suicide is not the solution, reach out for help. Putting on a happy face for others is a very painful way to live
RIP Legend. I know her from a 2010 Snickers commercial and as a professor on  Community
Every year they said she was died
Rest In Peace ☮️ Betty White
The Golden Girls
She was everyone’s favorite great aunt, I’m sure she’d prefer aunt over grandmother. Lol. We love you and we will miss you so much! Thanks for always making us laugh.
Damn our last Golden Girl has passed! Rest in Peace Mrs. Betty White. Miss you much!!!
MsMojo, I get that you wanted to tribute Betty White (And who wouldn't, she's incredible) by posting this video early, but doing so this early when her body's likely not even fully cold yet just comes off as in poor taste to me and likely many others. Maybe you should've waited a day or two because posting this so suddenly feels uncomfortable to see as a viewer. It makes the decision to post this so soon feel less like a tribute and more like a calculated attempt to get ahead of the algorithm, either not caring or not caring enough that this time, it was in regards to the death of a beloved star.
Rest in peace, Betty White. Thank you.
RIP 😭

I know it sounds crazy but.. I be thinking maybe she wanted to go before the New Year started? idk 😣 I just do believe in these Hollywood sacrifices .. but idk it also would’ve been amazing for her to make it to the New Year.

‘The Betty White Show’ was the OG Lifestyle YouTube Channel but on Television, shot in Black and White. That’s quite cool.

R.I.P Betty White. You can be with your Gilden Girls now in Heaven.
My Favourite Betty White Moment IS LITERALLY EVERYTHING FROM HER! “She’s a legend, an icon and SHE IS THE MOMENT. Now come on now —“
No one is like her or will ever be like her. A true tale to tell the next generation.
My favorite betty white moment: Hot in Cleveland -  “I signed up when my bender was over. In fact that’s my screen name. Bender over.”
Thank you for being a friend :)
R.I.P

She was a fine old lady, truly a golden girl.

I loved the one time she was a guest GM for Monday night Raw. She just straight up gets on the microphone and goes. "IM GONNA KICK SOME ASS" had me in tears laughing 😹
Rip betty
,,😭❤️
RIP Betty White (1922-2021)  She’s reunited in Heaven with Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty.

I can’t believe she’s gone😢😢😢 she was so close of being 100 years old

Rest In Peace
Betty White did more for television than anybody. if it weren’t for her, the medium would certainly not be what it is today.  thank you for everything, Betty. you have no idea how much you’ll be missed.
Where was her drinking human piss on Comunity?
2022 is already the worst
This video doesnt feel the same way now that she died
Rip BET  🙏❤️🙏
I have a shirt that says she's still alive. This is so sad bruh. Why couldn't you go three more weeks betty?
Rest In Peace To Betty White. The Last Celebrity To Be Died This 2021. #RIPBettyWhite
Rest easy you will be missed iconic ❤️🥺🙏
Rip I just got a notification
i cant believe i, the last golden girls. dead
She didn't even get to see the new year! So devistated... She was amazing and may she rest in peace
If you're still living in 2021, it's an awful way to end the year and if you're living in 2022 right now, it's an awful way to start it. Only positive we can take out of this is that all the Golden Girls are back together. Bea is probably giving Betty some sarcastic response as we speak.
;(
thank you for being a friend betty
I'm just...... shocked 😢😢
This so ironic and so sad. They was announcing this Morning on New Year Eve. Celebrating in 17 days Betty White will be 100 years old. I was ready to celebrate with my favorite Golden Girl. I am sooooo Sad. I love love love my single girl. My Golden Golden Girl. 😢😭
I remember her on “That 70s Show” she did a wonderful job on there. She made me laugh tons to the point of tears. I had to go to the bathroom multiple times, may she Rest In Peace.
rip 🧡
I feel like we just lost our Grandma…she was literally Americas grandma RIP Queen 😢
