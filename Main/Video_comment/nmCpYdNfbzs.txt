8:25 (War flashbacks)
1:16 I had a dog that looked EXACTLY like that it was a Pomeranian fox face and his name was Jax. He lived to be 8 months old. We got him from a lady who worked at a bank and he was THE SWEETEST DOG EVER and I LOVED him. We had him for 4 months and they were some of THE BEST MONTHS of my LIFE. Anyway, one day I was eating cinnamon rolls and my mom let him out to potty ( btw we didn’t keep him on leash and we had dog next door and they had already killed a dog at our house) so he goes potty and my mom goes to get her shoes on but then when she got out there…… we herd YELPING and my dog was get attacked by the dogs next door. I was crying so hard and when I got out side I asked if he was okay but my step dad said no and his neck was broken. I BROKE DOWN SOOOOOO HARD  and I think that that was the hardest I have ever cried. And to this day I WILL NOT eat those cinnamon rolls anymore. 😭😭😭

Soooooo... what was that about the cat? You promised to consider it!
5:04 same for cats
LETTTTT ME DO IT FOR you
I have been binging Dr. Mike, so I know this is also an old video, but I'm going to tell you about my dog. I have a mini pitbull who was a rescue from a puppy mill. Her birthday is 3/3/22, so she turned 3 on 3/3 this year. My son wanted a dog, he picked her and for some reason, she adopted me. I'm her person. I'm who she always comes to, the only person she listens to, and she sleeps with me. I didn't want a dog. I like dogs, but I didn't want to have to take care of one.  Anyway, she has a lot of trauma. They found her (and a lot of other dogs) in stacks of cages. As far as the vet can tell, she's had at least 2 litters of puppies. You can see the abuse in the fact that her nipples are deformed from being on a milking machine, and she doesn't bark. She had just turned 1 when we got her, so we've had her about 2.5 years, and she's a spoiled princess. She has her own blankie. If you don't tuck her in for bed, she won't go to sleep and she just sits there staring at me until I tuck her in. If you take her spot on the couch (next to the window, so she can look outside), she will sit in the corner of the couch staring at the wall pouting until you move for her. She gets scrambled eggs for breakfast almost every morning. When we're done with meals, we put our plates/bowls on the floor, and she waits until we tell her it's ok. And a lot of other things. A few months after we got her, I took her for a walk (I don't walk her on a leash, but I do keep it with me), and we were walked past a woman. I told her to sit and stay. She just sat there and watched the woman walk past. She didn't move, except her head. The woman said to me "she's so well trained!" And asked my secret, I told her that I don't really have one, she just listens. She doesn't run towards other animals or into the street. She stays when I tell her. Her favorite thing in the world is to hug everyone she sees. People get weird around her because she's a pitbull, but she's the most loving dog. She absolutely will try to hug and kiss you if you let her.  She is the most loving love bug ever. And her name is Love (the SPCA named her). Her name has transformed over the years. Most of the time, I just call her "bug". She went from "Love", to "Love Bug", to just "Bug". But, she knows she's in trouble if she just hears "Love". She's also your typical pitbull and pouts when she doesn't get her way lol
4:13 it’s got 300k likes where is the cat

You kinda look like your dog I’m not dying like the same color of hair. My dog does not mattress my hair because my hair is blonde and then my dog hair. My mom is allergic to fluff so that’s why I said hair my dogs hair is black and white. I think my fish hair fish scales are like most similar color.

4:06 still waiting for the cat 😂
Anyone in 2066
9:53 it's probably because of his sense of smell!! My yipper dog is super tiny (5kg), so when we're in the car, he sits on the floor at my feet, resting, can't see out the window. But whenever we reach a bend a minute from where I live, he always looks up and starts preparing to get out. I couldn't believe it the first time but it's literally every time. So I assume it must be the certain smells of our living area that he recognises - dogs are incredible 😊
6:53 82% of the dogs at a vet 🤨
U were 33!!! U look sooooo young

My dog surprisingly LOVES fireworks! And lawnmowers.. and vacuum cleaners.. but as soon as the broom/mop comes out, he's gone😭.. idk why🥲
Yes, brown cats are real. While solid brown cats are relatively rare, various cat breeds can exhibit brown fur, including the Havana Brown, which is exclusively brown. Other breeds like the Oriental Shorthair, British Shorthair, and Persians can also have brown coat colors and patterns
If Bear had a doggy door you would have to add a human door into it.
When you say outside to my dog they will run to the door
4:06 well well well

Yooo bear weighs more than I do
Hey Doctor Mike, my dog, a teacup poodle, only weighs 4lbs and she still hogs the bed.  She's also very demanding.  If she wants a belly rub, she lays on me, grabs my hand and forces it onto her fat little belly.  If my hand strays to far, she grabs it again, and pushes it  back onto her belly.  Basically shes a very bossy little puppy, who I love very much.

When searching for a rescue, let it come to you WITHOUT looking directly at them…that means “battle”. Just stand there and let them come to you and smell you and your demeanor. They have excellent sniffers and when they choose you, they’ll be happy and loyal.
I’ll train the kitty — get a kitty otherwise they’ll be set in their ways from the previous owner! Easy to train! Have fostered puppies and kittens for 5 years and trained them to get along and play with each other, puppies and dogs, and kids. Most importantly—to potty in their litter box!❤

Mike was asking if cats can be brown - they can! First there’s the most common brown tabby, so tan with dark brown or black stripes, or cats like the Havana Brown or Burmese cat, which are often completely brown (like Bear!) or pointed (meaning patches on the face/ears/paws/tail, like a Siamese cat)
YOU NEED TO GET THE CAT!!!

Where’s the cat
The answer for your question on 6:24 is that there is two dogs so on dog goes in and another dogs head comes out so no it’s not photoshopped
Pet lover here. Also mom to 2 children. Dogs, cats, purebreds, rescues.  Had an English Mastiff purebred. She was a real drooler. Laid back. Was the runt, at most weighed 170. Vet said she was a bit overweight for her size. Got her down to 150, perfect. She lived to be 12 yo. before we finally had to have her euthanized. She'd developed cardiomyopathy (common in large breeds), lost hearing and losing eyesite, incontinent. Vet was shocked she lived so long. Also, keep in mind, rescues have excess baggage and takes time to help them overcome with lots of love and patience. Also, cat hairball vomiting! Wakes you up better than an alarm, just like when your dog vomits! Gotta love the unconditional love a pet will give you! Better than kids, they can't talk back in the same way a kid does and they're better listeners.

A cage is not a training tool...  Also yeah they understand what an elevator does. Your dog is not the only one that know the floors he is interested by, but aside from anecdotal trivia there are various studies about stray dogs using public transports like the famous Boji in Istanbul.

The titanic thing; they both could have survived, if he climbed onto her back…women have more body fat then men, so if they were found pretty soon after they could both survive….but he’s already been in the freezing water. Plus it’s not like they were on a small plank of wood; it was a whole door! They just did it so her character would seem like more of a surviour in the end.

My sibling has an assistance dog in training (he's called Padfoot, he's a black lab), and he is a very good boy. The thing is, because he's still in training, he can't go everywhere with my sibling yet, so when they have appointments, mum takes them, and I get to puppy-sit. He's in the crate most of the time unless he's getting fed/going to the bathroom/doing training/going on walks, but I don't generally have to handle that stuff, so I get the pressing himself up against the bars and giving me plaintive looks until I give him all the scritchies, and, in public, him being very calm around strangers, and throwing himself at me at warp speed because he knows I give the best scritchies
THERE'S 300K LIKES!!!! THE CAT IS HAPPENING!!!!

There is a channel called Bondi vet. You should really really like to it.

Mike was 16 when the White Sox used "Don't Stop Beleivin'" for their 2005 World Series winning season. I was old enough to vote back then. He should stick to medicine and avoid karaoke like he has a restraining order. 6:30 - "Drake Meme"?? Please re-read my first comment. I saw "Titanic," not for the corny romance, but for the opportunity to see the famous White Star liner in all her glory.
So...uh looks like Dr. Mike is getting a cat. 😅

One of my professors in college had three classifications of dogs - yip’n’snappers, bark’n’biters, and woof’n’chompers.
Me watching the meme of dogs compared to muffins and cookies: I'm literally eating a blueberry muffin top with strawberry syrup for the first time. But I don't have a dog even though I've ALWAYS wanted at least one and will have two when I'm older and moved out

"leT Me Do It For YOu"I just watch that hilarious video
2:41 borzoi dog.
Can I ride bear I am a 8 year old
I've never crate trained my rottweilers. What i did was as puppies if they  grabbed anything they aren't allowed to chew id take it away and say no and then I gave them a toy they are allowed to chew on.  They learn to onky chew what was given to them rather than any random object. And ever since then they can stay inside free and loose without me worrying about them chewing anything other than their toys. That combined with proper exercise and potty training.  Mine have a dog door and when I'm gone they come in and  out as they please with no issues and if I have to close them inside all day they do fantastically.
4:55 im not fat im just an ai image lol

Who loves huskies?
Where is huckse
I had the same concern about rescue dogs. I was so fortunate that my best friend volunteered at the local humane society. She ended up fostering a litter of 7 pups while they were too young for adoption. My son and I spent several afternoons with them, then waited online like we were trying to get Taylor swift tickets when they were finally up for adoption. We were able to snag the puppy that fit us the best and he is literally the best dog I have ever had.
I’ve heard those dogs called noodles
Brown cats do exist
I don’t get why everyone in America puts their dogs in crates all the time? We’ve only ever used a crate for my dog when he was a puppy. Most people I know who have dogs do the same thing, they have crates for cars or puppies, and my aunt used to use one after walks while her dog was drying. I don’t know anyone who just leaves their dog inside a small crate when they’re not home or overnight, I don’t even think that that’s legal here??
1:37 I have a yorkie mix breed dog and I can for sure say that yorkie are a yipper breed

What type of dog is bear
0:07 to 0:09 dude you're a doctor you should know better than to not let your dog lick your mouth, believe it or not dogs are infested with worms, even a small lick on your mouth can give you: 👇 Heartworms🪱, hookworms🪱, roundworms🪱, whipworms🪱 and tapeworms 🪱 Not to mention salmonella too, I'm not being rude or against dogs or anything like that, just don't let your dog lick your mouth.   Do you guys know the real reason a dog licks your mouth? They lick your mouth because they want you to THROW UP FOOD for THEM to EAT!!!! In the wild foxes and wolves would eat and then regurgitate the food back up for the puppies!!!! You can actually search this up!!
6:40 my cocker spaniel just runs with the ball and doesnt give it back

Crate? You mean a bird cage? 😏 Just as cats dogs doesn't belong in a small cage!  But talking about dogs and elevators; I was babysitting a mini pit who loved taking the bus! Not just any bus, if we were standing at the bus stop she wouldn't react before our bus came. And she always wanted to walk in the first door and sit on the floor by the HC seats. There she had full view of the door and room to move around a bit. Everytime the bus stopped, she would run up to the door to sniff the air! 😅 And that's probably how she knew when to get off 👍
yes, you look like bear
BRO I SWEAR THIS TACTIC HELPED ME GET THROUGH THOSE 5TH GRADE TESTS 4:20

bear is so cute

On the part of Do dogs understand elevators, i think that they read your body language and not go onto the wrong floor.

Long time since this video was released, and even if I agree on many things with Dr. Mike, caging dogs is not one of those things.

If I got robbed my dog would be like “ here the valuables how ya doing?”
I think the term is biocolored or Heterochromia
to be fair, I understand both sides of the "Jack and Rose" argument. On the one hand, it sure looked like the door sank when he tried to get on. On the other hand, she absolutely pushed him off.
I have Cardiomywieneropathy

I think that dog in the snow was a greyhound with longer fur
Too bad you guys did not have this one to react to…”I go to a dog shelter to get a dog and I’m a hero and everybody loves me, I go to a woman’s shelter to get a new girlfriend, and everybody loses their freaking mind!”
For all you wiener dog owners….  Why did the cowboy get a Dachshund?   Because the sheriff told him to “get along little doggie”
There is a speck of fuzz on your shirt
You could do a small sample experiment with like 10 nuggets and then multipley that time by 50,you get some data, Bear gets his nuggys.

To stop your dog from eating your couch... Get rid of your couch 😅
I saw a video the other day about a police dog being officially accused of eating a cops sandwich so I wonder if it would be considered violating hippa if you consulted a licensed police dog rather than just your own dog idek why i focused on that one minute of the video lololol

Wiener doggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg and you have no clue how much of you do this for your future and your post is not going out for you to make your own decision and it can make sense that I am. You know that. If it doesn't matter what I only want to make your money off of you
Folks, October 2024, the likes are 282k. We just need 18k more for Dr Mike to get a “bear” cat. LET’S GO!!!
I know this is totally not the point of the video, but Jack tried to get on the door with Rose and it sank.  It MIGHT have held Jack's weight by himself, allowing them to take turns, but it wouldn't hold them both.
Bear is the living teddy bear that's always welcoming to hug with bonus kisses-definition of actual paradise 🤌🤩❤
3:09 my dog hates the taste of any couch
Its funny borzois are from russia

Bear is so cute 🥰😊❤❤
''do they make brown cats?''' dr mike i think it'd be best for you to get your mentality checked
Hold up my duck is barking rn-
I have two hotdog dogs. :D
C'mon guys! Mike needs a cat!
5:48 it causes dumb rabies
3:30 I make banana blueberry muffins
chu-hoa-hoa + muffin = cuffin
Ayo
Why did you never get a cat?
Dr Mike said if this video gets 300k likes, he will get a brown cat like bear. Let's do it!
Walking past a vet clinic, I met a lady with a medium size dog in her arms. I heard a "meow" coming apparently from the dog, and I was starting freaking out when she told me: "It's my phone! It's just my phone!"
"They welcome it on their faces as if it was mosturizer." IT IS!!!!!
BUT I LIKE SPUD MATCH
You look like Roxy
Im heavily against using those stupid cages for dogs  I think it's a cruel and fucked up way to treat a beautiful innocent creature  The dog either sleeps with me on the bed or he gets the bed and I get the floor
Look like bear if you put a doctor suit and glasses on him
almost 300k likes…..be prepared mike
Bear is so cute
British long hair comes in chocolate ;)
Mike, I d like to see you get a cat for Bear. The affection between the two is so heartwarming. Have you considered getting a rescue?
8:51 one time on a zoom meeting, my cat Carolina mooned everyone (I️ think cats do that cuz they want you to sniff their butts like dogs do). And my cat Sunshine likes to eat my dad’s hair while he’s in a zoom meeting (Sunny is orange soooo)
The picture of bear with the cone of shame made me feel bad for him
1:12 ????
0:47 bears like "I wish he loved me more."
The breed club websites are where I would start if you have a list of possible breeds and want to know more. The basic things you should look for in a breed are energy level, trainability, temperament around people, temperament around other dogs, grooming requirements, and prevalence of health problems
cat pls
I love bear he’s so cute I want him in the pictures not me my name is liah I am seven and I get in the phone at eight Let me do it for you
You are such a good dog owner! Bare is always so calm around you. I know the stress sighns of a dog and he shown ZERO from what I saw ❤❤❤❤

Yea you do kind of look like Bear in that you both have brown hair and are big but soft and cuddly.
Bear is gorgeous.
Corgis are so NOT chill. They are herding dogs. If there are more than two living things in an area, they run circles around them, barking incessantly. Not a good couch dog.
The animals in our house have gone through like three thousand nicknames 😂

Get more bear cubs
“Bear high five”  *nearly gets a right hook to the face by his dog*  *tries again*
my cat is so small and my bean bag is drencht of cat fur
Corgis are not chill. They are a herding breed and they want a job. Each dog is an individual and also shaped by their environment, but you frequently get what you breed for.  Reputable rescues will try to match you with a dog that works with your personality and lifestyle, and will usually insist that you return the dog to the rescue if it's not working out, rather than letting people dump them at animal control. All the rescues we've adopted from have been super cool with potential adopters having several get to know you visits with the dog before committing to anything. Bear seems like a great dog and I'm sure he'll be happy with whoever you choose.
8:20 when my dog throws up, he licks it back right after🥲 at least i don't have to clean him up🤭

If Jack would have asked Rose to make room for him on the door, and Rose had said NO, I’m pretty sure Kate Winslets career would have ended right there.
276k likes on the video right now, if he hits 300k he might get a cat
What dogs do you guys have (if you don’t that is fine) I have a French dogue de Bordeaux who is seven years old soon and her name is Beauty! I also have a younger dog who is an American breed called Zeus, he is three years old.
LETT ME DOO IT FOR YOUU 😂
Love your dog!❤❤❤
Bear has a tiny little floof at the top of his head. So adorable! You should buy him a taco suit 🌮🌮🌮
"If this video gets 300k likes I will consider getting bear a cat that looks just like him…… do they make brown cats???" 😂😂😂
cuteness beautiful❤❤
is there a time limit on the 300k likes?? haha 24k to goooo
mr. floffy floofs
I love Your videos
My dog licks the couch
A corgi a chill dog? Oh sweet summer child ;)
Wouldn't a doggy door for Bear be, like, a door?
my dog doesn't eat the furniture, but we have never had a crate for her. We installed a gate on any room without a door, and when we're out or sleeping we would close all the rooms off except the landing. Slowly we would open the rooms up and she knew not to destroy stuff.
Steven HE?!!?! Mike  look's JUST like bear, and My dog's Phone meme is" Have you tried Peeing ALL OVER THE PLACE?!?"
I have a dog named bear❤bc his face looks like a bear. He is in one of my shorts
Who takes him out when you're at the hospital
We are 25000 likes away, we need to get him to 300000, so he'll get a pet Kitty

ALMOST 3K MIKEEE
Bear is so cute 🥰 ❤️
In regards to getting the right rescue dog for your personality, most good rescues will have you fill out a quiz and do paperwork so that they can help you make the best possible match. Also, you can spend one on one time with dogs at the shelter before making your decision. Some shelters will also allow you to foster the dog before adoption to make sure that its the perfect match before signing the adoption papers. Hope this helps 🙂
Honestly I think Mike really looks like bear 😂
Yes
You should get get Bear a top hat and bow tie for Halloween. Guess the video game character Mike would be dressing him up as.
I used to own a Borzoi, and it is such a lovely breed. I'm surprised they're not more popular, but at the same time I'm kind of thankful for it, becuase I don't like when a breed suddenly grows "popular" because of a movie, meme or a celebrity owning it and such. Borzoi's grow up to be very big dogs, and they're a pretty independent breed who can have a bit of a stubborn streak, so they're not the most beginner friendly dogs despite their very sweet and gentle nature. They're not suitable for everyone. They really are lovely though. Full throttle when they're outside and running, and really affectionate couch potatoes when you take them inside and snuggle up in front of the TV. So graceful yet goofy at the same time, and they rarely bark. My boy was named Aristo - He got his name from one of the main characters of the book that the breeders daughter had written. I lost him to cancer in December 2022, and my mom lost her Husky Ayla in spring 2023 to old age, but just a few days ago my mom, my brother and I visited a litter of borzoi puppies and booked two of them, so at the end of this month we will have not just one borzoi in the family but two~ I still miss Aristo like crazy. He was all I could've ever wished for in a dog and more, so he will always have a very special place in my heart, but my mom, my brother and I have all really missed having a dog. We all live apart, but we used to take turns taking care of both Ayla and Aristo. Basically the one who had the least work or didn't have work that day took care of the dogs, and if more then one of us were free then we would often take the dogs out on some small adventure or take them to the dog park and play. My family has always had dogs ever since I was little and loved spending our time with them. The only one who has a dog in my family right now is my older sister. She has an American staffordshire terrier, or Amstaff as we call them here in Sweden. She's a very sweet dog, but not really my cup of tea. She's a bit too wild and spoiled in my opinion. My mom jokingly says that these two little ones are my fault since I was the one introducing my family to Borzoi's and made them fall in love with the breed ^^  My mother booked a female. She's black and tan with a bit of white, and she has the most adorable little freckles on her nose. They almost look like a four-leaf clover. My babybrother and I are buying her brother together. He's stunning~ I'm not a 100% sure what his color counts as. I think he would count as white with fawn spots? He has very long legs and big paws, so I think he'll grow up to be quite a big boy. They're so adorable, I can't wait to get them home. Puppies are a Lot of work, but it's so worth it.
4:16 we’re not at 300k yet..
Ik heb
Hello there, Dr. Mike I was wondering if you know what it is called when you breathe in and it really hurts but like you breathe out and then just goes away

Omg he looks like my dog! Does he smell bad?
I swear someone had to clone bear. He is literally my dog. Super hairy, giant, and laid back. Also does everything in this video

Oh my god bear weighs more than I do 😂 he’d probably squash me to death if he sat on me, and honestly? I’d be completely ok with that. Death by snuggles is how I want to go, bonus if it’s by a pupper as cute as bear
DOGGO!!!❤
Where's the cat?
My dog started understanding what outside ment and he would get excited, so we tried spelling it out , but he eventually caught on
Doggie!
9:36 Ohhhh My! Floofers.
Huskies are my favorite and my husbands' favorite dog breed.

Boys: why do girls live longer? Also boys: dude I wonder if that zombie will turn into a human if you bite it. Bet.
Congratulations on your new fur baby. He's adorable. Glad Bear gets along with Rib. I hope you have a good vacuum cleaner to pick up all that extra  hair.
The ' cHiHuAhUa MuFfIn ' was my personal favorite...and fr bear has grown to be much bigger and much cuter \ ^_^ /

So many dogs get put down in shelters, it will be great if you save a dog instead of buying one! Shelters and rescues have all breeds and all ages, u can easily fine the dog that is right for you! You can also follow the Asher house, they share information about it all the time! I’m happy to recommend you rescues you can check out!

Mini bear 😭❤️‍🩹
My tip if you want to get a rescue dog - You'll know when you've found the right one. I know that sounds corny, but it's 100% true, you'll just know.
Well dogs are scared of a person but when there personality will change over time with you 🐶
9:47 I have friends who had a cat. It would come through the back door of their house, then go straight to the front door and scratch and meow until they let it out. They called it "Front World" and "Back World". There was no restriction between the two worlds once outside.
Dr. Mike my fat Chihuahua is 13 gonna be 14 he is old as dinosaurs I don't think he has a short life now🤣

Let me do it for you😢
I.  Love. Noofs.
its a borzoi my doctor mike man 😂
“Crate train early” I didn’t have to train my dog. She loves her crate and goes there to sleep all throughout the day. Given it has a fluffy pillow and she can leave it when she wants since I don’t put her up. I have the best dog. No one can change my mind
Closer to 300k likes now and Bear will get his pet cat
borzoi
I recently saw a video where a dog owner pointed at and yelled at the vacuum.  Supposedly by punishing the vacuum, dogs will stop getting upset.  My vacuum didn't make the move, so haven't tried it.
Cats sleep very long because when it sleeps it sneak for food
I gotta say, the pets sometimes resembling their owners is a bit spot on for my cat. Bingo is the second cat I've owned myself (family pets don't really count, lol), and she has poofy brown fur like I have poofy brown hair. And she is not very social unless it's on her terms. Oh, and she may or may not hate her siblings on occasion (she has two brothers at my parents house and one sister who lives with us).
GUYS almost there
Baer is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute❤😊
My dog’s name is Marley and her names are moo moe marmitos mar mar and she understands them all

The pure bread thing I laughed so much so super funny 😆
The Titanic question: Let's say they both got on the door and stayed out of the cold water and lived. She would have realized very quickly that he couldn't take care of her needs, and she would have gone back to her family. I don't believe for one second she didn't go back to her family. And I don't believe she waited her whole life to go back there with that film crew to die and be with him. Do you mean to tell me the people that were her family and friends for the remaining 60+ years of her life didn't mean as much to her as the poor swindler she spent a few hours with on a family trip that ended up being the worst experience of her life?
I actually have that cat. Brown chocolate one. I'll adopt you both.  😂
Tip on how to get rescue dog 🐩= buy a cat
Bro just got corgi’d

Please get a 🐈
3:50, RUN! IT'S DOGZILLA!
OMG isn’t he just the cutest?  And Bear is lovely too 😁😁😁😁😁
Bear is the cutest dog in the entird  world
if you were to get a rescue dog my best advise would be to take your dog with you so that you know if your dog will have problems with the other dog and this is coming from someone with 14 dogs
Like it was p
You asked how to find a rescue dog that would have the personality that you wanted...contact good breeders of the breed you're interested in. They sometimes have adults that they want to place. They might have a puppy that was returned to them.  Breeders today can't usually have many dogs.
8:00 YO SAME!!!! except i call my dog  Poopy  Poopyfart  Fart  Fartman  Fartpoopy  Manfart  Tootles  Noodles  Boodles  Kootles  Footles  Some Telugu curse words (my mother tongue is Telugu)  Fatty  Fatass  Fatso  And pooper. His name is Simba.

Brown cats are real but rare, they’re beautiful! I can just picture bear with a lil teddy bear cat friend 🥹❤️ the floof newf king 🐾
With fur that long, Bear's shed hair might make nice yarn.
9:30 I’m 21 and have all three, I am clearly winning at life
Only 41000 likes to go to get Bear a cat!
you don't cage train dogs. if you are doing it then it means you fucked up raising the dog properly to being with.  there is no reason to lock a dog in a cage just like there is no reason for you to lock up a child in a cage. you either raise them right or you take the consequences. you don't do that lock up bullshit.  if a dog does something then it's for a reason and locking it up ain't gonna fix it and ain't kind to the dog.
LIKE THE VIDEO PLS WE NEED TO GET 300K FOR THE CAT

Mike I will challenge you to a like battle you need three hundred thousand likes for you to get a cat and I need one hundred thousand likes for you to get a cat
Not fetching past five throws: High Intelligence. My border collie stopped fetching after a couple of throws because she realized you were just going to throw it again and didn’t see the point.
my nan has a dashund
He can smell the floor abs if he’s been in that floor so he know ur scent and his on your floor
It’s been proven that dogs do not feel guilt so when they get yelled at they don’t understand it was from what they did
Don't forget to like this video and get it to 300K, that way Dr. Mike will have to get Bear a brown cat as a pet!
People should like the video so Mike gets a cat.
You’re so close to 300k and a new cat friend for Bear!
So many of these are so perfect and true, the vomit alarm clock one  should be cat's though it wakes me up every time! My brother's GSD will jump up to go out whenever anyone heads towards the kitchen because we have a side door towards the dogs fenced yard.
rargh bear is so frickin adorable
bear is a dogified wooly mammoth  change my mind
About the elevator. My dog, who lives with my parents, visited me once. I live on the 8th floor (my parents on the first, and no elevator). There is an elevator ofc, cuz it is like a 12 floors or so high building. He was scared of it so he decided to use the stairs - the look of utter confusion when he noticed thats the wrong door was so adorable xD Also the look of pure horror when he looked out through the window and noticed the height xD  People say that dogs cant talk. I dont need him to talk - every thought is visible right on that little face of his.
if you get a cat i hope they can get along well
43k more likes till Dr Mike gets a cat
Me when I had a blueberry muffin this morning and felt healthy because at least I had breakfast
I love this video, clicked on it immediately as I saw the borzoi in the thumbnail. Also the irony of Mike not knowing the Russian wolfhound (borzoi) is kinda hilarious 😂 but whippets are somewhat related to borzoi, although collies tend to be closer related.
likevthe vid
I lobe duggis
So I know this is old, but if you're worried about adopting a dog and meshing with you and Bear, a lot of shelters have a trial period where they after you meet them and they meet Bear in a neutral environment, they check in in about a week to see how everyone is adjusting. Another great option would be fostering an animal to see how well they mesh with you and Bear, and if you do adopt, great, if not, you just opened up room in the shelter to take in other animals in need and kept them safe until they went to their forever family.
Has anyone figured out what book Dr Mike is talking about that looks at the Jack and Rose/Door situation and how we view it?
6:16 same for my little dog, but none of them fit her. My mom decided the best idea was a diaper…
Read Ranger in time it's a series about a dog who time travels I'm on the book on where Ranger goes back to when slavery was aloud also every book has 15 chapters and it will bring you to know the order of books by saying the most recent gifts he has got also everytime it takes Ranger days the time in the present will slow down so every day is one minute then it's slower the longer he takes to save the not in the historical events characters that the author made.
more bear vids please!!!
regarding  the Titanic scene: if she pushed someone off of the plank because there wasn't enough space for both...Idk I would've done the same honestly, you need to save your life after all
cmon guys... half a K more and Dr Mike has a cat

Bear is just so lovable.
begging for the bear cat to happen
I have question about muffins tho. Are they still healthier than cupcakes?
Can you play gartic phone its way to funny to not do with freinds
Do they make brown cats?!?!😂🤣 It was also suppose to be a cute pics of dog’s faces and muffins. You go into doc mode and tell us about how bad muffins are. 😂💗 (which is good to know…)  I have cut out sugar, gluten and milk and I’ve lost 13 lbs! I read labels and can’t believe how much sugar and bad oils I had been eating!🤦🏼‍♀️😝 I enjoy you reading the memes! You’re so sweet about it! ☺️
Sorry we don't use crates in my country, I don't understand how people can put their dogs in that, I imagine a busy doctor life is hard, but if you don't want your pet destroying things then they need quality time, to use their energy in a positive way, going for walks, or hire someone who does, playing, running
Let mee do it for u 🤣👏 had me rolling on the floor
What kind of dog is bear
LIKE THE VIDEO! BEAR NEEDS A CATTTT
Doctor Mike is the best y'all
E
I think if he had tried to get on the wood and it had started to go under and was obvious it wouldn't stay a float with both of them then people would view it differently.
Until today I didn’t realise how similar Mike and bear look. Unless that’s just me.
The way he barked at the start is so cute
My dogs would eat them in like six minutes if I somehow forgot to feed them breakfast and dinner

3:46 the meme be like " THEY ARE NOT EXTINCT JURASSIC BARK IS REAL" that can literally be bear.
Out of all dog breeds to get wrong he gets the Borzoi wrong. A Russian dog breed! 🤣
Probably a late comment, but for finding the right dog from a rescue I would recommend seeing if they have a foster-to-adopt system. The rescue I work for does that. If you don't want to commit to fostering, in case it doesn't work out, we also do sleepovers. The animal would already have a foster, so you have the animal for whatever amount of time you agreed upon and if it doesn't work out they go back to their foster. You could also see if the foster is comfortable with a meet-and-greet at their home to get a feel for how the animal acts on familiar turf. Several options to make sure personalities gel before you commit.
His bark is sooo small
I have two nufinlands
As soon as I saw the brozi ... It's brain: "LeT mE dO iT fOr YoU"

Bear seems like such a sweet and cuddly boy. 😄🥰 Also, you look nothing like Bear, Dr. Mike. I'm sorry to have to break it to you, but he's far more handsome. 🤣😜
OMG your dog is adorable
9:34  I guess I can't become 30 cuz I don't have Anxiety-

I have two wiener dogs and they are my babies. Don’t listen at all, but they’re cute enough to get away with it.
Lol. Our puppy is half Bernadoodle, half Sheepadoodle. He sits and looks out the picture window and "Boofs" at danger. 💥  He sits there on alert like the Sheepdog in Looney Toons. 😂
Boofers made me laugh bc when people take drugs rectally it's called boofing

And what’s wrong about it 5:39
I’m eating a muffin as I watch 😭
I have a little Yorkie (who is my world by the way) and he is the most quiet dog anyone's ever met. Everybody is always telling me how quiet and calm he is. I know alot of Yorkies aren't though but I think it's from the way I raised him because of my personality. I'm an introvert and really quiet in general so probably has something to do with it maybe.
4:09 GUYS WE'RE ALMOST AT 300K

viallobos rescue center in new orleans
Do not get a rescue. They need time and patients and you being around a lot. You are a doctor so I do not think you have the time for a rescue. They are not like dogs you have brought up since puppy age.
You wanna know a cute dog thing? We got my dog a dog plushie and instead of tearing it apart like all of his other toys, he treated it like a baby and even brought it with his when eating, drinking and sleeping.
I think if you were to get a cat i suggest doing lots of research on them and then if you still  going to getting a cat i suggest a hairless cat because it would match your personality better
I love the emotional damage meme it's great
It takes time to find the right dog but if you put in research for good shelters and places and have patience and know that it won't take one day to find the perfect dog
My dog throw up and I came to him and he was wagging his tail in it 😂

I have apuppy, (half great piraneese and half Anatolian sheperd, both big dogs). He looks like a miniature polar bear, and my family has given him a lot of nicknames - like fluffball, fuzzball, polar bear, baby polar bear

Should have been a meme I have four dogs in my teeth they are my canines😂
corgis are not calm  they are very easily excited and have the zoomies a lot
I read a theory about Titanic that Jack actually wasnt dead. Coz dead bodies float. He didnt. Also bubbles were coming out of his mouth which means he was just uncontious. So basically Rose killed him by letting him go
corgis are the opposite of a chill dog 😀 very high energy working breed. big dog in a lil nippy body. lovely and sweet tho
Dogs are literally amazing
So sick of this f-ing argument. Yes, the door was Big enough for both of them, but the north Atlantic don't give no f@cks, coz it's BUOYANCY that counts, Madre Puta!

My dog biscuit is between a yoofer and a woofer he's a shitzoo mix btw
Haha. I have general anxiety, trouble going out alone and meeting new people that sort. I have a dog I got as a puppy who I socialized as much as I could, he’s never experienced ANY sort of abuse or negativity from strangers. Yet he’s terrified of anyone he doesn’t know. He’s basically just as anxious as me he just doesn’t force himself to get over it cuz he’s a dog and he doesn’t have to lol. Also like me he doesn’t get aggressive or angry he just hides  Also. I really wanna meet bear. I go to jersey from Florida once a year in the fall. I don’t care about drool.
You could test it by saying how long it takes bear to eat one nugget and then times it by 500
yes  you  look like bear

My Saint Bernard gets vacuumed like bru he doesn't care
As a cat lover and connoisseur I’m not sure if this video should reach 300k..? Only if you prioritize the cat’s needs over the dog’s as in a cat is not a chew toy for the dog, and they are very sensitive to personal space that’s why it’s easy to freak them out. It’s difficult to love them equally because of their different needs. I don’t have enough energy to have a dog, but I like them too. 🐱🐶

Doctor Mike I love your vids and would love to meet you IRL
.. i love bear
8:20 yeah anytime i hear a dog gagging im straight out of bed
I'm sure someone already told you but Bear doesn't get off on other floors because he can't smell himself there so he knows he's never gotten off there before.
If I see a dogfight I hope its a Sukhoi. Then I'm grabbing the Raptor and Free Bird.
Not me eating a triple chocolate muffin this morning
Crate Crate that's all I hear...Aussies don't do crate. Poor little doggies.
Do you know what Bear and Dr. Mike have in common? Almost the same shade of Brown fur/ hair.
I'm so confused about Roxy, as I never see her in videos.
How is this dog so tall. Maybe its two dogs lel

I have a brown cat😂😊you are very smart good job😊
I can confirm as an owner of a corgi, he is such a cuddler and is very chill. But he also can be very active and has lots of zoomies. Luckily, he’s got a retriever friend to play with lots! Crate trained him and everything. He’s such a sweetheart and I highly recommend. Just be ready for a little sausage roll or muscles!
They are avoiding hitting "like" because they love Bear 🙂
Just when Dr Mike couldn’t get any cuter, he gets cuter…. This man can NOT be single. He is very attractive, very intelligent, great sense of humor, obviously a very caring doctor and human being, and loves dogs. What more could you ask for in a man?  There is NO way he doesn’t at least have a girlfriend…. Or a wife who he just doesn’t talk about. Watching Dr Mike cuddle with Bear and react to dog memes is THE most adorable thing I’ve ever seen. I just want to reach through the screen and hug them both (especially Bear; sorry Dr Mike, but Bear wins the cuteness contest on account of his fluffiness)
This is Asian joke Jonny Jonny yes papa are u a doctor now papa ho yaa are u stupid la.

Totally not me watching this video with my dog on my lap
the dog thing is kinda true cause he looks like a bear and your Russian
You look like a gentle giant, like Bear.
Fun fact: If you rewatch the scene, one of the first things Jack tried to do was get on with her, and it started sinking, so he got off. It literally could not hold more than her. MAYBE a small child or early teen, but definitely not a full grown adult.
Please get a cat like bear, I have a fluffy cat like bear, so lovely
i don't think u look like a donkey :> (bear is a donkey)
As a corgi owner, I can confirm that Corgis are  NOT chill at all

Your dog deserves an account!!
Please get this to 300k now i want a bear cat
Rescue dogs are perfect. They are not broken. They may be harmed and fearful . You learn their personality same way . Get an adult dog, or a dog that had lost his owner (i.e. died) if you fear. Shelter dogs suffer of bad PR because people think they are broken or bad. They are not. The have so much love to give. Many of them love any person that comes them.
broken smile🤣
It’s big meme man!!!!
dude my cat's name is Bear! but his sister brooklyn is the floof ball
DOGE LAND
YES YeS YES yes
I don't think it breaks HIPAA to tell your dog. It's covered by dogtor patient confidentiality.
As someone who’s grandmas wiener dog who has moved on 😢 that dog one who is the heart is very accurate

I know for my family and I, when it comes to looking for rescue animals, we don't really go out actively looking for them- they seem to find us. Somehow when we have a space to fill in our house(or maybe need to make a space we didn't know we had), there's been a dog or cat looking for a home.  And what's wonderful about rescue animals is that they are just so grateful to have a home, that they have always made the most loving pets. Sometimes they have problems because of past abuse or not being trained well as a puppy, but you get to work on it together and bond with them in the process. Plus you grow as a person too. So in my case it has been a total win-win. 😊

Is anyone looking at the like count and thinking "THANK GOD!"
8:35 the way the light just drains out of his eyes lmfao

Carry a small umbrella with you when you walk your dog. If another dog off leash comes running at you both, suddenly open the umbrella as they get close. It will startle and stop the dog. Plus you have something to defend yourself and hide yourself and your dog behind.
Bears doggy door would be an actual door!
UH...😬Corgi's aren't chill, doc. They're a herding breed...they need LOTS  of interaction and play👍.

1:34 “Now his heads bigger than his whole body” Me: “Please, don’t say that while talking about dogs. That gives me flashbacks to this one SUPER scary Audi commercial that existed when I was in middle school. It traumatized me for months, if not a few years, after. Thankfully, It’s been well long enough now that I don’t think about it anymore, and I wanna keep it that way 🫣”
Doc mike "Muffin are a treasure chest of saterated fat and (i forgot)"   Me: "I just hate a pack of muffin"
Please good Doctor, don´t keep Bear in a cage, if fire breaks out he cannot help himself.

Finding a dog that matches your personality in a shelter it is just as easy as finding him in a store or breeder...why would you assume adopting a shelter dog is a gamble about finding a good personality match? Dogs at shelters are desperate for love and companionship and as any dog they can be trained and adapt to your lifestyle with time and patience
So close to getting a cat for bear
Still no 300k likes
Idk why but u look like your dog
So true
You and bear are both adorable so yes☺️❤️
When he said "owners look like their dogs" I immediately saw the resemblance between him and bear.
We got are dog from the human society and he loves everyone but we don’t know what kind of dog he is but he thinks everybody is his freind

Olà Mia doggo
i have a tan and black dachshund
We are almost at 300k come on we want a cat don’t we guys
I think I know why he doesn’t get off at the wrong floor it might be he memorises the button you pushed
Oof. Imagine Bear having a cat friend.  The cat would probably use him as a bed and Bear wouldn't have a choice. Doesn't matter that he'd be so much bigger than the cat. xD  It'd be cute, but you'd be safer with either a kitten or an adult with a compatible personality (who is well socialised). Also, as people have suggested with dogs, first see if there is a compatible cat out there in a shelter, or some similar place... there are plenty of cats who could use a loving home. And while aesthetics are nice, personality and how well they work should come first.
9:30 oh my gosh that is so accurate. I am 30, have anxiety, a dog, and the dog has "anxiety" (well he gets super nervous in certain situations, so...yeah. he also attacks other uncastrated males, so hooray for that. working on it....)
Like this video, GET BEAR A CAT!
re: finding your perfect dog as a rescue - foster to adopt!

Nope not breaking HIPAA, he’s a dogter
Is bear full Newfoundland? My sister had a newfylab

As a dog owner, 90% percent of these are accurate, especially the key one.

Bro my 2yr old beagle eats EVERYTHING

6:34 I wish this was the case with my dog. 😅 she is OBSESSED with her damn ball!
Info on what to do if we witness adults like? You mean we don't place bets? 😅
Bear letting them in, was a reward for their bravery, since he Knows how scary he is.
Who wants to look for a cat wearing the best in "bear" fashion?
"It's Not breaking hipaa if you tell you dog about your patients right?"  Depends how often do you take him to the dog park? You know dogs like to gossip. 😅
I am watching this video on 09/03/23, and sharing so it will get enough likes for Bear to get a pet cat.  Lol
Dr Mike: I want a corgi, i’ve grown out of athletic dogs. Me, a corgi enthusiast: Who’s gonna tell him?
the way he said that reminds me of friends when they had a pet duck made me so happy
5:40 "I said you could pet him; not make out with him, WTF?" 🤣
"Bear is too heavy to sit in my lap while I'm on the computer" as Bear is sitting in your lap while you're on the computer. 🤣🥰
Bro I was looking for the video were bear throw up
2:11,  you can put out like healthy snacks the size of normal chiggen nuggies and see.
2:36, definitely a Borzoi.
Bear is so cuteeeee
Dr. Mike Bear is the best and most beautiful, calm dog. Even if its just for the video. I am 100% sure he is the bestest boy in the WORLD. You are amazing with your medical advise and reviews. But you are the best pet parent I know. Why I would say so is because I am Veterinarian. Love your work. I am to reach out to you with your email. I hope you reply and not your team. I wish to discuss and learn something from you. Sorry for being straightforward in your comments section.
how old is bear plz tell me😁

😍corgi lawyer
I rescued my dog from the shelter and she pretty much chose me first, it’s a 50/50 where the owner chooses and the dog chooses
As a person who hasn't lived a day of her life without a wiener dog, I can confirm that 0:47 is 100% accurate. ❤
8:33
On the chihuahua muffin meme I genuinely thought this hey we’re all normal chihuahuas for the first  few seconds
With rescues I would look up a good place and go back to that place MULTIPLE times. Eventually, a dog will choose you. I think giving rescues a chance to think and pick for themselves is actually good🥰  Edit: by going back multiple times hopefully you form a bond with the dog BEFORE taking them home
𝕯𝖔𝖈𝖙𝖔𝖗
My dog once pawed a rock and put his mouth on it  after saving it from drowning he did Cpr. What i mean is he was bouncing on the rock making it look like cpr LOL 😂.
Both you and Bear are super handsome boys so yes you do look alike

... when you go looking for a rescue dog .... wait and look them over but the one dog who picks you will be the best mactch in that group...
As much as it would be cute to have a brown kitty that looks like Bear…with dogs you think about the breed that matches your personality and research their health and then apply to adopt the pup of your dreams with a breeder (or shelter). But with cats, you go to the nearest dumpster, and find a stray cat that has recently had kittens and one imprints on you and  decides you’re its person, so it follows you home, and it basically will not be denied, and then you have a cat. That’s the cat distribution system at 0:01 work. You don’t choose the kitty, the kitty chooses you.
what considered you you to be a doctor, your soooo good at it!!

Gratefully sorry, doctor Mike, the myth Buster's already busted it. Both rose and Jack could have been on the door.

1:19 sooo cute! I have a dog kinda like that!
I wouldn't feel any differently its not about the amount of space on the door, but the weight. If there was too much weight and the door would of sank bellow the surface they all would have died anyways.
Tbh I think mike does kinda look like bear
another trick to stop your dog from eating the couch, spray some vinager water on it. They won't like the taste and will stop everntually.
My dog's name is also bear he is just a little bit smaller.

Honestly I would say get a rescued dog from the SPCA cuz those are dogs that actually have been traded it does take a while but you're going to love whichever dog you choose to get they're all really cool that's where my grandma got her dog and she is awesome
My dog has heterochromia one of his eyes are fully blue like an icy blue and the other is half brown and half icy blue
My great-grandmother had a wiener that was very violent because whenever I tried to hug her it would try to come after me but it died and we were already because it was a violent dog

Pleeeaaaassseee get a cat version of bear, that would be the best thing ever.
Classifying a corgi as a chill dog is the most hilarious part of this video.
Try to find a shelter that's proven to have good dogs, if they can't have a open dog look out place tell the them what your looking for, you might want another husky or another dog like bear, they probably have a dog for you, this is how we got our 3rd dog which we got yesterday, clover, she's a rottweiler,lab mix we think. Hope this helps!!
I’m sorry I asked that I just can’t help it❤

we are so close to the 300k. He's going to get a kitty if it hits 300k. Also. You can find a rescue almost anywhere. Its just the trial and error of finding the perfect fur baby for you that will be the adventure. Not where to go. Its who you're finding. Never know, the fur baby may find you.

Personality is literal perfection ❤️☺️🤘🤘..
That's an Afghan hound. The white dog next to the snow dog.
My dog also looks like a bear it's not just bear
They do have brown cats, they are called Burmese cats.  They are usually dark brown, but come in varying shades now.  They are definitely playful, social, but are also very vocal.  My friend had two, they were dark brown.
Yess,get bear a brown cat they would look so cute together.

Newfoundlands are my favorite dog breed, big fluffy and friendly.
y e s
Bear is precious 🥰
I'm sure someone's already commented, but if you get another dog, make sure it's thru a rescue center that has meet-and-greet rooms so you can see how Bear interacts with the dog or cat. Some rescues also have "someone's interested in adopting me" signs, giving you the chance to visit a dog more than once before adoption. You could potentially volunteer at a shelter, too, but you might be too limited on time for that.
Doctor Mike I so love you 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I died laughing watching this video.

Also that breed that you thought was a whippet is either a Saluki or a silken wind hound
Oh boy do not get a corgi if you’re looking for a chill dog. They are shepherding dogs and they need a job to be mentally stimulated.
Bear is so so so cute. Also yes corgis are great pets….. I have a corgi but I wouldn’t exactly call her chill. She’s a psychopath
I LOVE bear hes such a sweet little doggo boi
Someone suggested dogs can smell the different floors going by so they probably know.
Mike casually says “do they still make brown cats?” like they come from the factory 🤣
I wish I could show you my dog, she's so small but she has all these big breeds in her. They literally said at the vet that she's gonna stay puppy sized for her whole life. She literally looks like a full grown lab but is so tiny
Nah It's not a whippet It's LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU- I mean a borzoi 😃💀💀✨✨✨✨
@DoctorMike answer comment plz. And hii
Get this to 300,000 guys!

1:11 *Oh my god not Dr mike making jokes too-*
Yes you and bear look alike and I think he would like the cat but the cat wouldn’t like him 😂
WE'RE ALMOST THERE PEOPLE. 100 THOUSAND TO GO!
I think the reason he doesn’t get off on the wrong floor is because he might look at the button you press and will leave it when it goes back to not lighting up
doctor mike: do they MAKE BROWN CATS   me what do you mean by make?
If you put on enter sandman in the woods you might find the dog
A cheese muffin sent me to the ER and that's when I found out I had gallstones. One shot of morphine later I was telling the ER doc he was Ben Stiller's twin.. but he really did look like Ben Stiller.
80k likes and bear gets a 🐈 cat
8:33 his face when from surprised to *pure horror* when he heard bear
Did you even get a cat yet?
my former neighbour used to have an irish wolfhound, when you opened their garden door, he would grab you by the wrist, pull you inside and then sit in front of the door, not letting you leave.

Dr. Mike, I know you’re not going to read this but I just need to tell you. I’m a 13 year old girl and I’ve wanted to be a vet since I was like 2. Ever since I’ve started watching your videos I’ve been inspired to continue to pursue my dream! I even debate sometimes becoming a people doctor instead. All I wanted to say is thank you! Keep being yourself because you because you inspire me and continue to do so. Have a great day!
Let me do it for you Didn't I do it for you
Let me do it for you I knew that I knew it for you queenie
Do it for you
Feed bear 5 nuggets and then multiply the time by 100 to see how long it would take him to eat 500
any way the dog you were confused about that was a borzoi
if you had brown skin you would look like your dog mike
kitty?
The Borzoi is a Russian breed. And yet, Mike doesn't know the name??? 😂😂 head too full of medical knowledge.
I crate trained my aussie and currently crate training my south African mastiff. Oh and my aussie has the two different colored eyes only she has white whiskers on her face where her blue eye is and black on the side of her black eye. Oh i have anxiety and my aussie has anxiety. Horrible seperation anxiety at that.
D o g
I don't like the idea of crate training, I loved walking Terrah and gate training for rooms.
My aunt has a rescued dog and he is pretty chill he will want to be by them all the time and can't stand being without them and he is a pit bull.
Bro bear is built different in a good way tho. 🩵🩵🩵
Yes it a borzoi
Omg this dog. I wanna hug him
bear is def a woofer
we're getting close!
I’ve actually seen a Newfie dog and it’s was sooo cute
My dog for some reason always walks up to me just to burp
Dr. Mike you look like a husky… owner.
Bear is 29kilos less than me
Mike's theorem: If a bear saw 500 nuggets, then he will eat it in 1min and 47sec
3.39 my dogs' name is muffin! lol

I have a cat. It's not the throwing up that wakes me up, it's when I step in it, in my carpeted hallway. I'm like, why can't you do that in the kitchen?
That's an Afghan hound.
My grandma has a 16 year old dog named Clyde. And I love him.
Bear Bear Bear Bear
I can attest to the healthy weight dogs live longer. My grandpa over fed 2 of his dogs and they died before they were 9.  On the other had, my dog was 17 year old chocolate lab earlier this week when she had to be put down. She was 17! She got fed twice a day, got treats when she came to the door after being let out (I live in the country), liked walks before he hips got arthritis, and loved eating lettuce, carrots, and apples. She weighed 60ish pounds most of her life. My mom saw her wandering on the side of the road near my house, asked her if she wanted to go for a ride, and brought her home. When no one responded to the found dog signs we put up we decided to keep her and she had been with us ever since. We honestly were expecting her to die about 5  year ago when her hips started to pain her.  So yes, keeping your dog at a healthy weight is a factor in having them with you for a long time.  I miss my dog.
Liked this video for kitty...
When my dog had surgery and he had a cone. He hated the cone and when he only had 2 days of being a cone head left, he threw up in it so I had to take it off. It was only water but I didn’t want him to lay in it
So close to the cat come on guys you can do this 👍👍👍👍

Dog dog I have dog
So you’re getting the cat then!! (Goes searching your videos to see if that’s already happened)
i love wenners they are so cute
Take out the “dog” in this part 💀💀 0:48
10:05 Dogs do have the concept of acceleration like us and concept of time, so they know which floor is the right one (if trained properly ofc).
0:25 I heard like we’re familiar with ourselves and find comfort in those who look like us
It’s been almost 3 years since I lost my rescue schnauzer mix, Spenser (yes it’s spelled wrong on purpose, look at my last name) and I’ve been so dog deprived. I’m in college and I’m moving to the other side of my state in a couple months so my family has decided against getting another dog because no one would really be home to take care of one anymore. I have a bearded dragon and I love him so much, best beardie ever, but it’s not the same. Eddie is spiky and when he does wanna cuddle, he often scratches my neck really bad. Watching these videos makes me want a Newfie once I have more permanent housing.
you can get a dog at @Savw-a-Mutt

Get one who follows you when you try to leave, that shows you that they want you to come into their lives.  like you said dogs are smart, let them choose you.
Bear is on the Bear ruck and Bear looks like a Bear ruck
It’s a wolf dog.
1:11 i don't know how to express my reaction in words

2k :(
My grandma has a cat and she does the EXACT SAME THING as the meme were it goes:let me in so I can tell you I want to go out again.
If you choose to adopt a rescue, visit the rescue place a few times first. Walk some dogs, play with a few cats, introduce anyone you get along with to Bear to make sure they get along with each other as well. If you find a dog that walks nicely with you and Bear, and someone that seems to fit your lifestyle, that's who you (fill out an adoption application to) take home. If you rent your home, they may need your landlord or HOA approval first.   Adoptions usually ask for references, and I like putting down our veterinarian because he volunteers at the at the local shelters sometimes on weekends to spay/neuter their newbies. I figure there's no one they'd trust more.  Rescues are awesome. Our Lhasa Apso spent about half an hour digging and dancing around in his dog bed when we first got him home. I never saw a dog so GRATEFUL for a cushion before.
Mike says “Do they make brown cats “ LIKE WTH THEY DONT AKE CATS 😂 I’M SORRY LOL
the 1 where u thought the dog was photoshoped one dog put his head in while a different dog was sticking its head out

9:30 Mike: I have a dog I have Anxiety I have a dog with And faith Me: but are you 30?
Yes they do have brown cats
0:19  I mean you are what you eat
Tip for finding the right rescue dog: 1. Look online for good rescues in your area (I try to look at Humane Societies first). 2. Visit the shelter multiple times, you'll know what dog is right for you.  Quick story: My mom was looking for another golden mix after hers passed away and had a stigma about pitbulls, but the dog that she kept coming back to and she ended up saving was a blue-nose pitbull. Who she calls her pillow pibble because she is so floppy.
Awh! I have a rescue dog! He's a Wheeten Wirehaird Weiner Dog! I can agree a lot with what you said. They are VERY cuddly and do tend to yip a bit ahha!
I like when Mike was talking to bear at the start on the video bear was giving him kisses
Poor dog
Mike: *running* Bear: "bro chill 😎"

You should get a middle-age dog because I rescued a dog name Bella from this lady and Bella was so skittish but now she’s the sweetest thing in the world so you should try to find a middle-age dog maybe even a senior but sometimes puppies would be better because you can train them to be your personality so maybe pick puppies instead because seniors wouldn’t work because they would already know everything that works for them
It’s a borzoi!

Hearing the one clip (bear throwing up clip) terrified me :<
No one told me life was going to be this way 👏👏👏👏
Dr Mike... you know how you say that patients are an expert in their disease but not THE disease? You are good with YOUR dog and trained him well, but please refrain from giving dog training tips. What worked on bear might not and most probably wont work on other dogs, especially not other breeds. Best regards, dog trainer of 15 years.
Bear is so cute! Newfys r one of my fav breeds. Please dr mike give him a big cuddle from me.

OMG my heart broke a little when you said "crate training" instead of "adequate exercise, mental stimulation and boredom busters..."  (Re: how to keep a dog from developing destructive behaviors) And then again when you said you only let him out under supervision??  With the kind of hours doctors work... Bear isn't just in his crate alone most of the time, right?😭
2:39 it's a borzoi cos I have a whippet so I can tell the difference but lots of people get confused with them
“See I know my dog breeds” wrong my dad is a dog expert and h said that’s wrong. So did Bear.

“Do they make brown cats” as if cats are a man made species 😂
"Do they make brown cats?" YES! They do! Full brown cats are rare, but exist. They're called Havana Browns. They look really weird
“your an explosive dog, you have explosive diarrhea.” had me dying

1:09 Glad I finally got it diagnosed
Yo Dawg! I mean Yo Mike! You keep doing this same thing that my wife does with her own hair - although in your case it's with Bears hair - of "bundling" the hair and throwing it on the ground.
9:09 it makes me feel sad that even doctors go through bad days. But then again, doesn't everyone go through a bad day at some point? It's really easy to forget that doctors are human too.

10:43 when it comes to rescuing a dog, most shelters tend to "interview" you to see what your life is like& see which dog would best suit you- I have 3 rescue dogs, they're lovely.

you know, Rose from the titanic never died.. because she’s right here.   ME
My dog is a rescue and we looked at a few different places before we found her and when I saw her I knew she was my dog. She was the first dog I saw, my dad and I continued to look at the other dogs at the shelter but I couldn't get her out of my head. So I guess what I'm saying is look around different shelters and you'll know when you meet the dog that they're the right dog for you.

Usually stray dog are very good and you can usually go to a pound or a kennel and sometime on Facebook or instagram there will be posts about stray dog up for adoption so that is a good place to look if you want one
Um doctor mike I just want to say this but I had a dog named cotton he was a Newfoundland to just like bear and unfortunately he died but he had a long healthy life he lived to 17

OH OH- HES A PURE BREAD GOOD BOI!!!!
Bear melts my heart!!! 😩 I can’t 🐻 🐾
The dog at 2:42 is a Borzoi, or Russian Hunting Sighthound. They were originally bred to hunt wolves. Borzois look similar to Afghan Hounds. There are brown tabby cats and Havana browns. 8:03 My late Labrador/Catahoula mix, Doodle (RIP), had many nicknames. Doofus, Dooder, Gator, Floppy-eared Wolf, etc. She could look like a southern black bear sometimes. Lol Good ol' Burr dog.🐶🐻
I love love LOVE his mohawk❤
I did not knew u had weenier puppy 😮. Ut it’s so cute😊😂❤
I have one
When adopting a rescue, let them pick you.  You will never have a more loving animal!

I have a dog named Arlo 🐶🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺🐾🦴 he is a Labrador
Idk if other places do it but Saving Grace animal shelter had this system where my dad could foster a dog (one they matched to him)for a weekend until they found one they felt fit with them. It’s funny though because we kept the first one.
No he want 0 to 50000
What kind of breed of dog is bear
We need to you a cat. Of the brown type.
Ohhhh my god pls do get a cat !!!!!! Bear is already the cutest most handsome boy but I think a cat will complete the family. ☺️
at 6:16 in the video i got my dog one of those  he bit it up and tore it to shreads on the first day LOL
Alright I know he didn't ask but I just wanted to say my dog's name is poochy and his nicknames are: moochy wooshy , cooshy, and loochy
Answering your question Mike: If you're concerned about finding a pup that matches your personality , some organisations let you "foster to adopt" , where you can take care of one pup after the next, until you find one that is perfect for you
3:22 hey look it's a chawaffin
EVERYONE LIKE THE VIDEO WE NEED THE CAT!!!
2:34 is my favorite part just wat ch

My dog once gone in a fight with my neighbor's dog and they are enemies forever now. But then my dog died and my neighbor's dog is still searching for him😢
OH MEH GAW IS STEVEN
Dog names just makes me think of my family's dog. My parents decided to name her Luna, which I thought was such a stupidly stereotypical dog name, like calling a collie Lassie, so I just decided I'd call her Osten (that's Swedish for The Cheese.) The thing is, she now responds to Osten just as much as she does to Luna. She's an absolute bundle of cute energy. <3
I don’t think it breaks HIPPA if you tell a dog, but I wouldn’t tell a parrot. Owners know they remember only the things you DONT want them to know. 😄
Plz don't replace bear lol
Also, DONT replace bear, he is the cutest dog in the universe. I just wanna hug him forever!!!.
10:42 Based on your personality, I'd recommend like a Cane Corso, or maybe a great dane. I can't really think of any big floofsters except newfies, but anything REALLY big that has a lot of fur. Maybe like a chocolate lab and cane corso mix, if you could find one.
get the 300k likeeeeeeeesssssssss
YES! you look like bear!
Do a vid of Bear swimming pls
2:25 looks like a duck has good taste in music.

My parents dog was a rescure, and he had really hard times being scared of everything in the beginning. All he did was hide under the bed so it really took some time for him to start trusting us. But after that point he was just such a cuddler and super playful. Like I could play with him for hours hes in and I could also just cuddle with him for hours (only interrupted when he hears either the dog or food). So I think its hard to really get to know the dog quickly when hes a rescue but I guess every dog is different so others might have the opposite experience.
We need cat we need cat we need  cat 🙏 😢
I love bear cuz he's so cute❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🐻🦮🐕‍🦺🐕🐶
You don’t eat the couch, you eat my face. ~ Dr Mike 😂😂😂
Dr mike and bear is the best duo.
Lol so true about wiener dogs! I have 2 wieners and a cockapoo. When I have a treat and say sit, my cockapoo will sit immediately, but my brown wiener goes, “nah, just give me the treat and we’ll be equal”. They have so much personality even though one of my wieners has to be on Prozac for anger issues. She’s still so sweet around family!
I have a rescue dog that has only one tooth and was abandoned by her previous owners to be put down because of a dental disease when she was a puppy
I have a case of cardioMike’sweineropathy and I need a cure. Please help, Doctor!
I such a big fan ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Listen  you’re a doctor not a veterinarian
Camp Jean is how we got our rescue pup.
bear HAS to have a cat friend that looks similar to him , a brown cat and a brown dog are the key to happiness not only is bear going to be happy youre gonna be happy too :)
I adopted an adult rescue dog end last year and it's been very different from getting a puppy but not all bad. Here's the quick version:  Selection: I contacted the shelter manager and told her roughly what I was looking for: basically a dog that was gentle enough to put up with my existing terrier cross breed, small to medium size, any breed, preferably male, tho it doesn't really matter, good with cats as there is one in one half of the house. I also told her I'm happy to take one with minor health issues since those are usually difficult to find homes for. I told her I have stairs so the dog needs to be OK with that. She sent me photos of about 12 dogs that matched my request, with a special focus on the ones with minor health issues as its rare for them to get people interested in taking that on.  I made an appointment to go see the dogs. After meeting each one, one of them stood out to me. Whereas the others were quite content, this guy really seemed to need some extra love. He was extremely soft natured, and I've had experience dealing with that. I went back and visited my top 3. By the time I was done visiting there was no doubt in my mind. There was one other dog at the shelter that caught my eye (I tried to put on blinkers coz it's so hard for me to not want to take them all home, so basically went in with my heart hardened with determination: just one, think clearly). He wouldn't have got on with my existing dog as they have Similar personalities. If he is there when my old boy goes, I'll go back for him. If not then he's found a home and I'm sure is happy.  Initial take away: a lot of rescues go through a lot of emotions during the rehoming process. They leave everything they know and are put in situations where we expect them to be fine, but it takes them time to adjust. You have to give them lots of time and reassurance. Lots. Introduce one new thing at a time: ie, new home environment. Only when they're comfy with that, do u add the next thing: driving in car, meeting family, etc. They will show signs of distress in ways that u might not realise, ie, panting a lot. It really helps if the shelter owner can give u a little talk about things to expect etc. It also helps if they can match the suggested dogs personality to yours somewhat. Ie you would want a dog that's a bit more self confident, for example. Also one that has been fostered in a home environment before might help. Mine was a shelter boy all 6 years of his life, so everything was a huge change for him.   Pros: Adult dogs learn faster than puppies. They don't need to learn through trial and error, tho they may still take chances - but you can just be firm and they usually respect the boundary. He is actually better trained wrt handling than my own dog - let's me clip all his nails, does as told, let's me brush him, wash him, etc. This was done regularly by a staff of volunteers at the shelter. It has made owning him soooo much easier.   Tip : Adopt at a time when you have a little extra time available to be there for them. They will need plenty of reassurance and comforting. It helps the bonding process a lot if you can be around to comfort them when they're stressed.  With having another pet, u might want to arrange to take bear out to meet his new potential siblings and see if he has any preferences. They don't always like to share their humans or home.   Shelter dogs appreciate everything about life in a home - couches, food, cuddles, walks, games. It's not just a way to be with their human, it's like a little dog experience all on its own. They give you their love way before you've figured out what makes them tick.  The hardest part has been forming a bond. I feel like it's less like having a child and more like making a friend. It takes a bit of time for you to both get to know each other. But the love does come - you just have to try not to think about it and enjoy the experience. The more you get to know each other, the more the love comes. We're 5 months in and it's already starting to feel really good. We appreciate each other quite a lot. We are both big cuddlers  Biggest con: he doesn't like sharing me, and he gets stressed when I'm away later than usual. However he is tolerant and well behaved about both. I just have to have a hand on each of my boys when they want cuddles simultaneously. Also he's a bit unaware of himself around the older dog, so I often have to make sure he's not bumping him over accidentally etc.  Oh, and he's an incredibly good watch dog too! Only barks when something strange is going on, and can hear a pin drop when it comes to that.  That's my experience. Hope it helps! A kitty might actually be great with bear. Bear is a tolerant dog and a cat wouldn't impeed your relationship. They are also usually quite low maintenance - which would be a plus with such a high maintenance dog! Not sure how the cat will get on with you tho... Dogs tend to be more tolerant of vibrant personality types 😅😂
If you got a corgi you are not asking for a chill dog 😂
Wow you are good singer so sweet ❤😊
WHY ISN’T IT AT 300K
( 2:21 ) MY DOG IS 104 POUNDS! She is a German Shephard and she is on a diet.  ( 3:11 ) My dog doesn’t eat the coach. Neither does the new one that we think might be a mix of a German Shephard and a Belgian Malinois.
The fact that Dr. Mike hurts my brain with all those med stuff does not know that the condition which the eyes are different is called heterchromia is just dissapionting
I would still pet the explosive dog too 😂
We need to hit 300k!
Banana nut muffins are amazing
People do the 300 k likes we need acatttt
Guys, we need more likes🤣😂🤣😂 We need that cat on deck Strictly for medical purposes😊😉
My wiener dog is a bed hog lol
Are you married? 10:27
I need to know what breed that is
Bear is SO CUTEEE, the way he barks is just aw. If i see a dog that big when im walking in the street i would freak out scared it would bite me lol and like run in a circle
Well your hair kinda looks alike.   I once knew a service dachsund named April who's job was to sound off to make sure drivers heard her hard of hearing human coming. She'd bark so hard it seemed like she was always about to lift off like a rocket! She had a tendency though to go back for anyone going in the other direction. I suspect this eventually got her killed, because she was hit by a car. But Dachsunds can get nasty too, they were once vermin dogs, and that's why i will always remember the clip of two dachsunds completely DESTROYING a Black Mamba. One would grab it, slam it into the ground to stun it, and then throw it to the other, who would rinse and repeat.
10:53 kindly which book is that ?
Corgi’s aren’t chill mike 😅
Bear's one chilled dog 😎❤
I was just eating a muffin when Mike was talking about how they are not just a snack and they are kinda bad for you if you think that they are just snacks. Lol
5:03 The 2 different eye colors are called heterochromia
Oml your dog weights as much as I do I weigh only 5 lbs more than that ball of cuteness
Like ppppplllllllleeeeeaaaaaassssseeeeee
Either Dr.Mike is barely 6 feet tall or bear is the size of a bear  Get it? Bear the dog and the other bear,same size
The thing you said where Dogs don’t remember bad things about someone, is false. I have personal experience with it.    My dog is scared of my mom because she has kicked her, and so she is terrified of her
Is Roxy still alive (I don’t mean to be insensitive if she is)
😅😅😅
I just realized at the end of the video he said that the golden retriever a tax place and I'm sorry I didn't see it till the end
Me personally I would say golden retriever because it really hyper but they can be really laid back dog also, I hear they're really good rescue pets😊❤
His ears on top of his head Look like your hair, so yes
not a tip but we had a very very sweet rescue dog, just find a dog that wont start biting after a few weeks.
Mike 100% looks like bear
Our pugxcavalier has raised 5 cats from kittens and he absolutely loves to snuggle with them. I don’t know who spread the fake news that cats and dogs don’t get along?!! 🖤
I have a Black Russian terrier so I can relate to you
1:30 OH MY GOD WAIT THATS BEAR?!
Here is a nice list of what my dog is scared of : vacuums: doors shutting: my hamster: my Guinea pig: thunder: fireworks: so anything smaller than her she is scared of- she’s a Labrador and golden retriever mix so she’s a big medium dog and a little on the chunky side but she looses weight easily so.
3:47 Jurassic Bark 😂😂 just crazy barks😂
Get bear a cat
what about of poggo
My had the same circle thing just it’s pink
" you don't eat the couch but you eat my face " EXUSE ME SIR-
C-c-can I pet Bear?
what breed is bear
If cardiomegaly means you have a large heart, what does weinermegaly mean?!-
At 7:14 I'd prefer if the dog was call a E.O.D dog or explosive ordinance disposal dog ngl
What breed is your dog
I can relate, my cat (Kayden) is the biggest cat I met (no he's not a big cat he's a house cat) and he's also a very extroverted lap cat. He sits on my lap while I'm on my gamer chair and rubs his head on me. He also sits on me and rubs his head on my hands while I'm in bed. And if I need to move him, he doesn't scratch me, he just magically becomes even heavier.
The way to see if bear can eat 500 nuggets is see how long it takes for him to eat one nugget and then multiply your answer by 500
Bear is just my dog but 100 times bigger
300K PLZ
get him 300k
Bear is ADORABLE!! I ❤️ Newfies! After Boxers they're my favourite! I just live somewhere too hot for them, I wouldn't put them in a desert area. That would be cruel.
if i had to rate bear as the most adorable dog  on  a scale of 50 i would probably say around 200  by the way i love your videos
I have the perfect cat for you
Weres the cat
The fact that Mike and Bear are technically namesakes in Russian is adorable
What kind of dog is bear? Hes so ADORABLEEE
I’m glad you’re thinking of adopting a rescue dog!! 10:32 I recommend getting to know the dog first, possibly fostering them, and then making a decision because you’ll know more of what to expect.
EVERYBODY LIKEEEEEEEE!!!!!! 4:06

This is soo weird! I have a Newfie named grizzly( grizzly bear) and he is the same color!🐶
Brown cats aren't common, but they do exist. If you don't want to go looking for an uncommon coat color, some tortoishell cats give the impression of being brown even though they are actually black and red.
4:52 he looks like max the dog from the grinch but bigger

My Newf knows the difference between my work clothes and my regular clothes. Granted it'S just a shirt difference. I wonder if he just knows the energy or the time difference. I walk everywhere so I don't know how he knows!
LIKE PLEASE I WANT TO SEE A DR MIKE CAT
Dr. Mike.  I watch YouTube for about 45 mins a day right after work with my sweet kitty cuddled up right next to me. EVERYDAY... But the moment he noticed there was a dog on screen he decided to go pout by the window and ignore me. I still regret nothing. Minus the price of tuna that I used for bribery. 87¢ per can!!! Outrageous!
where is bear in his costume :(
*nobody*  Me: _intently watching the likes_ ok…. *ALMOST THERE…..*

Bear does such a cute little yip-bark :D
Yeah you do look like your dog, hair. And in 5:47, the dog looks like the SOF in the military(Special Operations Forces unit), 10:20 just looks like a normal military tactical unit.

I love how he asked... " Do they MAKE Brown cats?"🤣 No Mike. They don't MAKE Brown cats.
It’s the let me do it for you dog and he didn’t see it
3:40 NOOOO!!!! I love blueberry muffins for breakfast, it's one of the few foods I don't throw up or have acid reflux from it 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Yes. Mike. You do look like bear actually- I can kinda see the similarities
Oh the Borzoi’s (in my humble opinion) are beautiful dogs! My son tells me they look like Adam and Barbara in their scary faces in Beetlejuice! MEAN! I also love BOXERS!!!! 😊
My Aunt and Uncle have 2 pugs named Lily and Sebastian. Lily looks and behaves like my Aunt and Sebastian looks and behaves like my Uncle. It’s not just dogs that look like their humans, my budgie has so many of my traits, she even makes the same scowl as me😂
I don't have a newfi but I live in Newfoundland Canada!!
How does he keep Bear so chill?! Our Bernedoodle is a super loving dog, but at nearly 2 yrs old, he's still acting like a kid who just ate a 5 lb bag of sugar and washed it down w/ a RedBull. 😵🤦🏻‍♀️ I just want him to be my snuggle bug. 🤗
Is Bear overweight? Or is it just he has a lot of fur to make him look extra big because that's a BIG boy. 😂😂
"Bear look."  Bear: 😴
I'm from Newfoundland, Canada and you're pronouncing it incorrectly😉
BORZOOOOOOIIIIIII
You are going to be so jealous        I have a wene dog
Mike:Memes memes memes memes! Bear:*licks Mike*
I feel like Dr. mike kinda has the same hair color as Bear
Hey, I used to work with a Dog Rescue in Bakersfield CA. If you ever want to get a rescue dog, I can tell you about the standard procedure and which rescues to look into, since some procedures differ between rescues. Also, you're gonna want to rescue a dog from a no-kill rescue and from a rescue where all the volunteers/workers actually care about the dogs in their care
My dog will want to go outside, 5 seconds later she wants to come back in, then 10 seconds later she wants to go back out again. Every single time I go downstairs and I'm dressed, (any outfit apart from my pyjamas, including my ballet outfit) My dog will think she's going on a walk. My dog doesn't like fireworks or balls, she will only play when she is super excited.
I want a dog but my mom say i(mom) already have one(me,crazy because she could have said I've already have 3 because I have two older brothers🥲) anyways i love bear💙🌿and dr Mike always create a great content 💜
1:11 kinda sus
Yes there are brown cats that they're really rare to find it cuz you're so nice I don't know why they're so hard to find but they're hard to find they're also really nice
I haven’t seen a dog fight but my mom told me our two dogs would get upset at each other a lot
Heterochromia on dogs be like 4:55
Chihuahuas are adorable! One of my favorite breeds!!
For some reason, with some dog breeds, if I look at them, I don't know what breed they are, but if you say a random dog breed, I CAN PICTURE IT PERFECTLY?!
5:47 I put on blue jeans my dog associates that with going for a walk. She gets all excited
i didn't know dr mike was 33
HA! The elevator one made me laugh so hard. I call it the magic box, I have a 1 y/o Rotti and I swear he gets the most confused look on his face whenever we get in the elevator, especially if there is another dog in the lobby. He rushes out of the elevator when we get to our floor like he's going to battle to save the world from the furry intruder just to stop dead and look at me like I'm a wizard when the dog isn't outside the elevator anymore lol. SO true about knowing not to get off the elevator if we stop at a floor that isn't ours though.
What the hel
NAME THE CAT CUB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have never been on a school bus with seatbelts
All that smoke is that loud past me no midget
ARE YOU GETTING ANOTHER DOG (going off based what you said to the comment “let me do it for you”)
You should make a channel for you and your dog
I want to nap with Bear, hold him tight! I have a feeling if I had a nightmare, Bear would be there to calm me down, like "Hey Nicky, it's okay bro, it was just a dream, do some balanced breathing for a few minutes" and then he puts his paw on my back, caresses me, and snuggles witg me until i drift off back to sleep 🥰
Monster not.
My old dog after they Would throw up they would just eat it after
My grandma has a 17 year old wiener dog
You are terrible at saying newfoundland, BTW. Come practice, bring Bear.
Please, never advertise people to use a crate!! Its so abusive, please dont!!!
So I'm 22 years old, still have 8 years to get a dog
Is it just me or do I really want to see that cat
Random Chinese guy be needing a lunch
there where fireworks outside the dog was so scared he threw up
Yep, bear weighs more than me. I'm 23 years old I weigh 53kg
As a person with Weinermegaly I can confirm.
Bear+cat=adorable 🐱
Love newfy’s! I have 2 black ones right now. They are my 5th and 6th newfy’s. I wouldn’t ever get any other breed.
My cat is  named bear  because my mom thot  it's  a bear because it look big to her win I sent her a photo  of bear.
I googled and there are nine breeds of brown cats. Who knew? I'll stick with orange for the quirky personalities but brown could be cute.
When bear dies, the entire Internet is going to turn into a memorial
Does anyone know the breed if dog Bear is? Because I would like to know
I just got my rescue dog Lady. Black lab that was a stray, I just had to wait for her to get all her shots done. The rescue center in Charlottesville Virginia is amazing, all I had to was sign paperwork buy a crate and take Lady home. Rescue dogs are amazing 😊
Aw I love your dog
The only person who would be able to take on Dr Mike in a boxing match and come out unscathed would be bear because no one would ever hurt bear, especially his padre
The fact that Steven he commented on this video is a meme it self
Yes, you look just like Bear. You also act like him as well.
You look just like bear
Getting a rescue dog is the most rewarding thing ever, I would say get a mixed breed because they have less health concerns in the long run (I had a rescue Lab x something who lived til he was 18, no health issues other than a mild stroke at 14 that he recovered from really well), and get a puppy as they have less trauma. An older rescue may take a long time and energy to rehabilitate, and then they may never rehabilitate depending on their trauma. I'm a huge advocate for rehoming and rescuing dogs as opposed to buying pure breds 😁 Ps, love you Doctor Mike and Bear ❤
Havana Cats are brown
BEIJING🌽
So is m watching the good doctor and the patient that shun had said she was dizzy and he checked her pulse.....HOW IN THE HECK DID HE KNOW THAT SHE HAD AN INFECTION!!!!!!  This was definitely a question for you lol
I'm more of a cat person, but in my experience with shelters, most shelters I know of will allow you to spend some time with their animals before you make a decision. So I'd go with some time to spare, let the shelter workers know what practical things I can accomodate, and go spend some time with the dogs. I always end up finding and falling in love with a pet there. Once I came home with two when I meant to get one, but it felt right to keep them together. A lot of the rest is just the two of you learning to co-habitate, the same as any roomie or family member. I think several shelters let you walk dogs too, so if you're very active with your dog, you might be able to arrange to take some dogs you've met on a run with you and see how they react to exercise.
I was grown up with a dog in a 10-floor household with an elevator and she perfectly understood the principle of using it 😅 She remembered on which floor I was when I sent her alone to another one and she returned. It was absolutely impossible to trick her with the elevator. (It was an old soviet elevator with no mass restriction, so it could go with me, a dog or even empty).
I've been looking at grey hounds because i'd like to get one someday.  I've heard they're actually a lot more chill than you would think. They just need the typical walks you would give any other dog and then they're just happy to chill.  Italian grey hounds are smaller versions.  They get seaparation anxiety if they are left alone but i think they'd be good with bear.  They'd have a buddy.  The funny thing about them is they are small but when they bark, they sound big and scary
I'm a Quebecer and "Newfies" are usually the idiots in a joke. Don't ask why, I don't know, but the result is I saw that title and went wut.
GET THE CAT OR I'LL CALL 9-11
“Do they make brown cats?”  I didn’t know there was a factory that made cats

Bear is a common name for a dog.
Please do Guinea pig means
My dog had a round inflatable pillow thing too
My dog once woke me up at 3 in the morning to drop her soaking wet ball on my face and force me to throw the ball until 4
Doctor Mike is the perfect mix between a reaction channel and informative channel about medicine 😂
My doxie passed away in November.  He was 13 and was more like a child than a dog.

You are so cute I just wanna grab both of those cheeks, smoosh them, and tell you what a cutie you are! Is it too late to adopt you?
If you have a yard, and Bear doesn't have a doggy door, you are selfish!
2:31 that’s a borzoi  Didn’t I do it for you? Didn’t I do it for you? When all I do is for you, Kermie
Doctor Mike, Bear looks just like my Newf, Guinness. We have a saying in our house… “What do you call a doggie door for a Newfoundland? A door.”
If you did want to rescue a dog there is a really great place called the Dogs Trust that are brilliant people, my dog is from there and she is perfect for me
I grew up with giant dogs so I don’t mind dog drool
Corgi is not cill I have a corgi she is crazy

You should do hair stiles on bear like a pony tail or braids
Bear is so cute but I just lost my dog but bear always cheers me up when I’m sad 😊❤

Bear is so cute
yeah you look like bear ... and my dad
Dogs are adorable and I live in India so the Indian strays have my heart! 💖 That being said, I do wish Doctor Mike would also adopt a cat and make a video like this with said cat!  My cats made me go from a dog-person to an all-animals-person. AND they have such varied personalities! Like, they can literally range from small-adorable-baby to nice-drunk-friend to that-judgy-friend-who-is-almost-always-right. 🥰
Titanic door drama was tested on mythbusters
Dr. Mike is rather easy on the eyes, love the hair.
Dogs rip up couches because they are bored and not getting enough mental stimulation, a quicker and better way to prevent your dog from chewing up your couch is to give them slow feeding bowls at mealtime, a Kong with dog-safe peanut butter, a lick mat, again with dog-safe peanut butter, or a puzzle toy
I miss roxy :(
Dog of wheat?     Nah. Sorry I'm not very funny.
1:54 where is roofers
I have an orange tabby cat that acts like a dog. My daughter (she isn't even 4 yet) trained him somehow. He knows cues like sit, come, food, are you hungry?, bedtime, no, wait, and hugs. Also he is incredibly chill and affectionate. 10/10 would recommend an orange tabby male cat for you and Bear.
Ok so corgis are not that chill (or at least mine isn’t). Mine is not trained so she barks all the time and play bites me a lot. She is a handful for sure so be careful when getting a corgi.
“Do they make Brown cats?” 😂😂😂
Omg I would love to see DinoBear...!! I do have info on rescue for adoptions. if you go to the Humane Society site there's and adoption form. you fill out and they'll review that you'd be a good owner.. and then verify was temperament of pupper your hoping to find and then they basically go though their systems aswell as other shelters and agencies .. and when potential matches are found either already in the system or that come in later...  As soon as there are cleared for adoptable.. you get a call and set up in social meet appointment.. Bring Bear.. so that all of you can see how you interact .. and go from their... Good luck on you future pup.. And Bear so fluffy I just wanna cuddle him..  Really We need Dino Bear!!! 😆
There are in fact brown cats.  Havana Browns, Sable Burmese. Chocolate European Burmese. Brown Maine Coons.  I could go on (but won’t). My Chocolate Lab’s best friend was a tiny Sable Burmese girl. Love at first sight.
I like!
my dog goes “ROOOO!” 1:37

171k, and we need 300k. I'll make 100k accounts, and 29k people make second accounts. We need that 🐻 🐈
Most shelters allow bonding sessions for people looking to adopt. Just ask your local shelter if that service it available. A plus side of adoption is mutts have fewer health issues and live longer lives than pure bred dogs. Hope this helps! Love your videos Dr Mike
Ok, but now we want to see the cat, you promise a cat😁
BEAR IS SOOO CUUUUTE
i wish my was like bear big but cuddly but my dog is big and mean he likes to play with his teeth which HURTS.
if you want to find an dog for you try fostering!!

Another one of Bear's nicknames for you: Dr. Doggo <3
Okay, you are definitely getting that cat soon 😂 130k to go, can't wait!! 😭❤️
If you had a Parrot who can manage basic speech would telling it about your day be a HIPA violation?
In real life when I see a dog my hearts stop and I panick, but I love bear so much if anyone ever hurt him I would march to their house and rip out their heart😊
bear weighs more than me!
On adopting a shelter dog; it's difficult because many of them have anxiety. They were abandoned by the people they trusted most, and they struggle to adjust, but if they have another calmer dog (like Bear) they tend to adapt well.  The best way to determine a good fit for you is: 1. Talk to the old person that's been at that shelter for 10+ years. They know their stuff. 2. Ask the staff about their favorites. Vice-versa ask them about their least favorite, and why. 3. See if you can do a trial period. You may end up with a dog Bear loves, but that same animal is terrified of you or genders (based on scent; my family had a dog that hated men in hats, but loved all women). It was weird. 4. There's no fail-safe way to find a rescue fit, BUT there is a guarantee your hous or renters insurance will drop you with certain breeds in your home. No joke. Call your insurance.  5. Get a mutt. No joke. The varied breeding unlocks other breeds personality traits, but that's the best part. My mutt looks like an inflated chihuahua that got confused and married a corgi, but she has a singing voice like a beagle.  There's no fool proof way to guarantee a good match. Kennel training a shelter dog is usually easier if they've been at the shelter for very long at all. You want one that's been there a minute. They've usually already received some training from staff.  That's all I can think of. ✌️
I have a weeny dog
Sir, you are under cardiac arrest!
Bear is soooooooooooooooooo cute
I'm not 30 yet and my dog has axiety too. My grandma jokes we need to get her an emotional support animal too.

That white dog in the snow is a Borzoi. Call the rescue first and tell them what kind of dog you are looking for and arrange to meet him or her with Bear.
1:52 Bear, your kinda a mix of a borger and a boofer
My dog is a borker but thinks he is a yipper
Get bear a cat
I love your bond with Bear. Dogs are the best. I pet sit/house sit as a job. One of my clients moved out of state and has paid for airline tickets for me to pet sit for them in their new home. Going again ik May. 🙂  Bear seems like a big floofy teddy bear. ❤️🙂

DO NOT. I repeat. DO NOT underestimate the energy in corgis. Corgis were bred to cattle believe it or not. My girl is half Corgi, half Blue Heeler... and the energy in that furball is unbelievable. (Blue Heelers aka Cattle Dog)

I know you probably won’t see this but I have been having a lot of trouble breathing and my dad is getting worried about it idk if I should go to the doctor or not?
Bear looks so so cute and huggable I love him!! ^w^ ^w^
My dogs are slightly trained to not eat the couch because my dad slapped them on the butt, which I know was so wrong, but he would yell at me if I corrected him or told him to not do it never do that, but it worked
I have a bulldog that has a blue and brown eye he’s so clingy and I love him to death but he was from a shelter they had just got him they say I got him my dad went and got him for me as a surprise but he didn’t receive any treatment so it was up to use to take and take care of him like 2 weeks later and several baths and  a lot of baby oil later his skin got better gave him a wormer and several things to fix him and now he’s happy healthy and loving life he used to eat all the food he could cause he thought we were going to put him back outside but he’s found his forever home and he doesn’t do that often anymore cause he’s in a loving family💙💙💙💙💙💙

Not that there's anything wrong with what I'm about to ask it's so cute but I'm just wondering, why do you let bear lick your mouth? Isn't it unhealthy for you, it is possible for bear to transfer bacteria or viruses to you through his saliva  you most know you're the doctor here
Steven he did your son get a b minus again lol 😎

Doggies YAY
My dog ate my fuzzy slippers, My Parent's fuzzy slippers, some of the cats toys and them went after a $400 chair that thank god only had gotten through the chair protector.  Although should point out at the time of this event we had 3 dogs that all chewed.  However do know for a fact which dog at the slippers as she had remains on her body as well as puked and #2 the remains out of her body.  They were the reason the slippers were always less than $3 no matter what season it was.  Can't tell you how many slippers we lost to that one dog alone and the funny part is my slippers are always upstairs in my room.

Mike : memes memes memes!
Getting a rescue just requires a lot of patience, I have 3 rescues who now you couldn't tell that they had bad lives. One of them took around 2 years to fully settle but the others took 6 months max. When you find a dog, it usually doesn't matter on their past as I'm sure you would give them the time they need to settle. Rescues are usually quite jumpy but mainly calm and cuddly. They just want attention and love.
I had a Black Russian Terrier, which is a mix of Newfie, Airedale and Rottweiler. He didn't bark unless someone was at the door - then he would bark once, maybe twice. But it was so loud and low and scary-sounding that, if the person on the other side of the door hadn't met him before, they'd turn around and get completely off the porch. And I need you to understand, our porch was long and narrow; they weren't just taking two steps back. It was like a solid 20 feet. But the moment they came inside, he was like Bear and would turn into a bit softie eager to show them all of our valuables. Our only hope for him chasing away thieves was that they wouldn't be willing to try going inside after hearing the bark. And honestly... I feel like there's a good chance that would work, given how other people usually reacted to his bork, even when they were supposed to be there, lol!
At the end of the video you are dancing and then you stop and it looks like you just have no clue on what to do!😂

I wonder how bear would react to a cat
I’m pretty sure myth busters proved they could have both gotten up on the table if they had used her life jacket under the table for extra buoyancy.

Bear needs a chocolate Persian cat pal.
BEARRRR!!
9:46 Short answer: Yes, dogs do understand that they're at a different height from when they started  they can feel the acceleration and understand that they went up or down, but like, on a mechanical level, obviously not.
I had to come to this video because I just rewatched thanks to them (an episode of the Owl House) and rewatching what happened to Flapjack I broke down in tears I saw this video and I said “I have to watch something funny or else I might actually sob for the rest of the day”  Thank you Mike for making me smile.

There's two dogs in 6:22. One dog inserts their head from the outside and the other dog is standing above something, then inserts their head from the inside. And since their color is identical, it'll be an illusion
No
North shore animal league on Long Island has some great doggos ready to be adopted! :)
do you have a cat yet?!?
Petfinder is an awesome way to find a new pet of any kind.  It connects you with pets at all nearby shelters and rescues.  Please adopt and rescue too many animals are put to death everyday.  Also please consider breeds carefully when adopting to get the right pet for you.
PLEASE GET A BROWN CAT OMG BUT THEYRE REALLY RARE AND EXPENSIVE
This video is just a positivity overload 😭😭😍😍 had me smiling up in here like a fool

My problem with cholesterol for sure sky rocket when I started using butter in stuff. I stopped eating, but goddess gracious I miss a steak with some butter, or some pancakes.
its not a whippet its a borzoi
PLEASE GET THE CAAAAAATTTTT
if you want to adopt a rescue, i recommend an older dog because they often have a harder time finding a home. to see if a dog fits your personality, i recommend going to the shelter and bringing ones that mean a lot to you. such as friends, family, or other pets. if the dog gets along with the other people you care about, it is likely that you will have a good bond with them. also, watch them interact around the shelter and watch their body language to see if they are generally chill or anxious, hyper or tired, and so on. hope this helps!
not to be that person but to be that person.. it’s impulsive thoughts not intrusive thoughts
All of my rescues picked me. I went to the shelter and they sought me out. I know, it sounds weird, but that's how I knew. My recent cat, Khoshekh, was literally pawing at his container, wailing at me. Volunteer unlocked his crate and he immediately went right into my arms and purred. No struggle, no nothin'. It was like he knew I was his person.
I had two rescue dogs and one of them was anxious at the start but warmed up to us I think getting a rescue would be gd for bear and that dog aswell also bear is adorable
do you know why my dog worrys ALOT OR CRYS ALOT were not doign bad but we had keep him in our room because there man who try fix the bathroom place but my dog keeps worrying and cryin on the bed and goes to me and not my mom and im like BRO I NED DONE ANYTHING GOOD ;-; i never peted him or do asnything nice like owners and btw my cousin was most of it and my dog says that my cousin is the owner LIKE SHE 6-
Mike: “Bear, do I look like you?”  Me: “I mean your hair looks a lot like his fur…you just have way less of it than him”
React to deadpool injuries please
he very big dog
I see a dog, I watch it.
WGAT DOG IS BEAR?😭😭 SO CUTE
I don't think whether you adopt a cat or not should depend on the amount of like on this video.I think you should only adopt when you love them.
This is just an excuse for mike to cuddle with bear on video….I’m here for it
ACTUALLY! Mythbusters PROVED IT that Jack and Rose BOTH could have survived! There was AT LEAST ONE way they both could have stayed afloat and out of the water on that door
I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee your dog ❤
Anyone else sad that Dr. Mike said he would put on Bears dinosaur costume....but he never did😢
did bear just throw up 😶‍🌫" LOL U ARE THE MOST FUNNY DOCTORRRR
In the movie titanic, Jack tries to climb on the door, but it starts to tip over. She tells him it’s OK they can make it work, but he did not want her to die in the cold water. It was the last thing he did for her. I don’t understand why people don’t remember that part of the movie
hey everyone let's get bear a cat
I know exactly how to suggest you get a rescue dog. DM Rocky Kanaka, he's got a YouTube channel (a few actually) and 99 percent of it is about getting rescue dogs into matching homes.
They do make brown cats but they are rare and very expensive lmao
Please get a cat! They are adorable, and easy to train. All the stereotypes of them being mean and hostile isn't exactly true, the only reason why cats are like that is because of their breed or they had bad previous owners
I wanna pet bear
James Cameron is a LIER about Rose and Jack lol! He was actually on Mythbusters back in the day and they tested if it was possible for Jack and Rose to be on that piece of flotsam and it was possible with a little work for them to both get on and survive. As James said though when that was delivered to him as the result is that the scene calls for Jack to die so...yeah..Jack dies.

A CATTT
😂🤣😂🤣
YALL GO LIKE THE VIDEO
Wait…now that Im actually looking you do look like/match with bear. It’s perfect
My one tip on adopting a dog from a rescue: Be sure to give yourself time to interact with the dog! When I adopted my puppy I spent three hours at the rescue just sitting with all the puppies and getting to know their personalities. This is even more important with adult dogs, since they have more developed behaviors already. With our adult dog, we visited with her outside, inside, and then had her on a trial period for a week. Many rescues offer this, and I think its a great idea to see how the dog will fit into your household, particularly with other pets. But also: don't ignore behavioral warning signs! We briefly had a puppy who had an incredibly strong prey drive, and wasn't really able to bond well with humans. Essentially, she was like a fluffy golden wolf. Looking back, we should have noticed the signs. (Not looking at our faces, not playing with the other puppies, extremely tense when other dogs barked nearby etc.) So for sure watch out for those signs. One last thing: Adopting a puppy is kind of like shopping for fancy clothes. You have to assert yourself, or you will end up with something that just won't work out. People who volunteer or work at animal shelters are amazing individuals, doing and awesome service for the community. They really care about their animals and they REALLY WANT TO FIND THEM HOMES. You may encounter some pressure to adopt the dog, and you will probably get pushback if you express behavioral concerns. But all in all rescue dogs are wonderful, and I'm sure there's one out there for you! <3
The second you made the wiener dog joke mixed in with cardiomyopathy, You solidified my most affection and admiration for you. You’re the best, Dr. Mike. Absolutely adorable

He's not seaching for a  rescued  dog he is searching for a rescuer  dog
Fun fact about me: I have a giant bed in my bedroom (I sleep there with my parents because our home is just two rooms plus a kitchen and a bathroom, so we sleep together cause the other room is very small like my bedroom, so there's no space for a bed), BUT whenever my dog hops on the bed, I just have no space to sleep. And my dog is the size of a rabbit 😂
1:51 And there are the dogs with HAH-BUH
That is funny because I have a dog,I have agxaity and a dog with agxaity

Dr mike were is the cat
2:29 It's a borzoi
I'm all about dogs in general. Seeing Bear in your videos just instantly puts a smile on my face. My boss and I help dogs and generally pets and sometimes animals in need; we build wheelchairs for them and it's honestly such a satisfaction watching their mood swift from the moment they put on their wheelchair. My most exciting case was with this shelter dog that was unable to walk with her front legs and as soon as the wheelchair was on her, she fled with speed, not caring at all about the stairs. She'd run up and down without any problem! It was such a heartwarming moment! Thank you for bringing out Bear every once in a while Mike. I appreciate the extra serotonin boost.
Your advise on crate training is so wrong. You know it's illegal in many civilized countries, especially to leave your dog in one for a whole work day? So cruel, so ignorant. Would expect a doctor to be more knowledgeable. It really is not very difficult to teach your dog not to suffer from separation anxiety or to not chew things. I have had several dogs and am not much of a trainer but still have managed to do it and have ever had only one couch chewed once ~ 15 years ago.
quick like the vid so he has to get a cat
Bear is like my black Labrador maurace my dog is as big as bear plus he was as small as bear when he was young
Lmao showing guests where all the valuables are 🤣
Too cute and adorable
YESSSS GET A CAT
Hey Dr. Mike  I volunteered for a well established rescue for 5 years during adoption events.  These are a few considerations and thinking points. Some are the hard points to consider when looking at all those sweet faces.   Take Bear so if there is a candidate you can see how Bear and Rescue interact.    Determine energy level and size range you are interested in.  Puppy or adult? Make list of excluding traits.    The hard stuff: Recognize that if a dog has been living with other people (so it is age 6 months or older) there may be behaviors that have to be learned before training in those areas starts or possibly redirect the behavior.   Recognize that it will change the dynamic you have with Bear.  Bear may not change as much as some dogs do.   Consider the activities such as hiking and what if the rescue has to take more time to learn good behavior in those situations.   There are potential issues of the other dog has food or toy guarding tendencies.  The rescue should be able to inform you of that.   If a rescue tells you all the good things about several dogs and no behaviors that could be considered difficult beware.  Each of our dogs has their “As is clause (claws?)”. We wanted people to have the full scope of the dog, not just the warm, floofy feelings part.   Wishing you the best
Mike. Corgi’s aren’t chill. I have two hyperactive corgi mixes.
id be bred
What happened to your husky??
Chi hua hua lol
nice vid drmike
Bear makes me think of the cat meme Where they put it on the stove and do the burnt audio
My dog is a rescue. She was still a puppy. We were able to do a foster to adopt to see if we worked well together. We did ☺️
😂DO THEY MAKE brown cats
My dog used to break out of the crates so we can't crate train him
BRO REALLY SAID DO THEY MAKE BROWN CATS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was today years old when I learned that Dr Mike is an ESFJ
I'm getting a malshi puppy on Friday  I've never felt so exited in my life  He's fluffy asf softest thing I've ever felt

woooooooooooooooooooo
"Explosive dog."  I just mentally replaced that sign with "Diarrhea dog."
like if mike is an iPad kid
Having dogs in crates is illegal here in Sweden, if you have it they must be able to choose themselves. It's only allowed in the car and outside but it needs to have enough space for them to run around.
If you get Bear a cat then please introduce them properly! They'll be happier in the long run that way 🐈🐕💕
I have two newfies and tell you everything Dr. Mike says about you is accurate
What breed is Bear?? I love him ❤❤
Getting from a rescue: go through a foster agency, preferably a dog who has been with the same person for at least a month, as they will have a very accurate read on the dog's energy and personality.
Bewoof???
And now the BROWN CAT!
My mom had a Newfoundland and when it layer on her bead it took more than 2/3 of the bed
Let me do it for you….

my Dog eats his throwup
3:32 cannot see the difference 😅
Sometimes I forget if Roxxie is even still alive
I adopted a rescue. She's three so we already knew her personality. She's my first do and I'd recommend adopting a grown baby.
whoahhh im famous i live in south corgilina
I rescued my little dog Winston.  I would go to the shelter  every weekend to play with and meet the dogs. One of the days I went, he put his little paw on my shoe through the fence, when they brought all the little dogs into the area for me to give hot dogs and treats to, he hopped up on my lap and decided I was his... so he peed on me. Anyway, it might take a few visits to find a dog that fits your personality and will get along with bear, but just visiting a shelter a few times, and meeting the doggos is a great place to start.
Bear isn't your good friend hes your son
Is bear neutered ?
"Ha hA HA hA He"
Before adopting a rescue I'd suggest going through with a "foster to adopt" option so that you can see how the dog does with your home environment.
I've  always wanted a dog    Cause my cat is so so so so so annoying Best is so so so so so so cute and adorable
I think that dog was indeed a borzoi. LET ME DO IT FOR YOUUU

I'm sure somewhere someone in New York has a fluffy long haired brown cat who isn't scared of dogs and their owner happens to be a huge Dr Mike fan.
My dog didn’t cry Becuse she wasn’t Mitch her mum any more the first night she cried Becuse we put her in a crate
❤❤❤
Is that a real bear😮😮
Are Newfoundlands good for a first time owner?  Been thinking about getting a dog. However, haven't decided the breed yet. Weighting the pros and cons to be sure it will be good for the puppy as well, since I never had one before. There been thoughts from Glodies to Samoyed and  Collies and also Newfoundlands. I grown up with Shelties as a kid and was thinking about a Collie because I want o bigger dog but seems to have many similar traits to a Sheltie. But I totally love the idea of a having a Newfoundland as well! They look so calm, kind and gentle and a lot of fun to have.
you gotta think about your self like what good and bad things do you do
Mike: I have a Halloween costume for bear. Me: THEY MAKE THAT SIZE??
Weigh
Oh my my Newfoundlands Way 150
I have a Great Pyrenees currently and he’s super chill and I think I want a Newfie in a few years due to them being super chill as well and not as prone to the separation anxiety like the Great Pyrenees. My pyr doesn’t fetch at all…. Very different types of dogs. But both chill! 😂😂
Do you have a wife, how do you treat your family do you diagnose them like they're your patients too. When they don't feel normal.
"Do they make those?" (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠)...What? Do they make... Brown cats...? (O . O) WHAT DO YOU MEAN O⁠_⁠o  "COMING UP NEXT! Are cats artificial~?"
I have a jack Russell named juber

HURRY GET THIS DOG A CATTTTTT
My cats name is cat but I call her Buttface,  doofus,  my lady,  mistress,  noodle,  your highness,  vacuum,  baby,  little baby, Big baby, Tumble weed.
OMG THE MEEEEMEEEEE I WILL DO IT FOR YOU
Honestly, having a rescue of my own, it does benefit if you figure out why they became a rescue dog in the first place. Sometimes it could be that they had a bad experience with a nother, too much yelling, being left alone, or, what we think happened to my rescue, abuse or harsh treatment from the man of the house. My rescue, Julius, is a very active dog and never wants to put the toy down, he always wants someone to play with him and throw the ball. When dogs repeatedly bring the toy to their owner, from what I've read, that's their way of giving and receiving affection to and from their owner. Rescues also are, a lot of times, eager to please to their owner so they tend to listen better as to not get their owners bad side. Julius does calm down when everyone else is calm and when it gets later in the day. Research the dog's breed, or mix of, could also help when looking for dogs that fit your personality. Julius is a Boston terrier, like all the dogs my family has had, and they're great people and kid friendly. They also are very loyal and protective. Whenever my dogs hear the doorbell they immediately start barking but after realizing the person at the door isn't a threat they calm down. Julius, who is full Boston terrier unlike the other two of mine, is also a hunter. He'll lead you right to his toy if he can't get it. Julius even found a vole in our garden one year and scared it off. He's not allowed in the garden normal but when he kept going back we found out why and then he stayed out of the garden. Don't know if you'll read this, but if you do, I hope this helps.
My cat looks black sometimes, but he's actually chocolate brown!! <3
As a Corgi owner, I wish my corgi was chill. She's always in sport mode.
Id be the person to welcome all the slobbery kisses perhaps its cause i was raised with dogs who slobbered a bit. plus I work at a doggy daycare so im used to slobber from all the dogs i work with lol-
We adopted a cat from a small adoption event. Not so much of a process as much as it was having a kitten handed to our 3yr old and going “look papa, she loves me!” So yea bring your 3 year old if you have one: we ended up finding a cat that personality-wise is literally our kid in cat form! 😂
What you could do is get multiple Newfies and give them each a healthy number of nuggies until you get to 500, and then add all their times together
Yes, there are choco kitties C:
I have about... 4 nicknames for my dog, Toby. I call him "Bubba," "Mutt," "Boo," "Tobert," and I think there's more but I don't remember.
Your dog weighs more than I do
Head to Flint or Detroit and adopt a pibble, aka pitbull. I volunteer for the Genesee County Animal Control (in Flint) and we are always at and over capacity these days. Detroit is a kill shelter though, so start there please
As a person with an emotional disability, I very much want a emotional support weiner dog. They seem so cute.   Thanks a lot doctor Mike now I am gonna obsessed with weiner dogs 😭💕
Bear is SO CUTE. I would definitely be one of the people letting bear slobber all over them 😂
I'd reframe be a lab they are sweet can be calm and mine where easy to train
No it’s the do they make brown cat for me 😂😂😂 Dr. Mike is so unintentionally funny
I have a weiner dog/ dacshund hes name is oreo sometimes i call him burnt hotdogs cuzs hes black and loyal

Wow, your dog is heavier than me.
Everyone needs a Bear in their life!  🐾💖
Too handsome to be single
About the floor he knows by smell most likely.
Your dog don't have anxiety at all. He would be tense. Looking to windows and the door. And lots of saliva and hair all over until you could see some of his skin. Don't worry hw is very healthy!
Aaand a cat in 7h hahahahaha
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Be a vet you are good
Котам нравится деликатность. Они не любят имульсивность и команды. Будешь ходить расцарапанный 🙂
James Cameron was wrong. There was enough room for both of them. And if there were three people on it. One was pushed off. I would push that person off.
Crating dogs is TOTALLY illegal in Sweden, so we just have to train our dogs not to chew on the furniture. :)
It's over the 1,500,000
Please do a collab mental health video with Dr. Elliot Carthy! I asked him but he said you may be out of his league,  not true! He is a fantanstic forensic psychiatrist on youtube
What a good dog
If we see Dr. Mike wearing a mohawk in future videos, we know why.
A lot of dog rescues are typically specific to one breed or a size of dog (xs, s, m, l, xl/xxl) and they foster their dogs at volunteer's homes and the organization will match you with a dog that fits your personality and your lifestyle or whatever you're looking for. Going to shelter is a bit of gamble with dogs because they don't spend as much time with their dogs as they would like or be able to, and they don't get to see the dogs in a non-shelter environment. However, adoption is faster and easier. Rescues typically require a recommendation, house visit, past veterinarian information, etc. and are more expensive. The whole thing can takes months but if you're really set on a specific breed and wanting to find one that fits your specific lifestyle, then it's the best way to go.
I was eating a muffin during this video 😂
GET THE CAT!!!
“Do they make brown cats?” NO THEY DONT YOU CANT MAKE A CAT MIKE-
I bet he didn't even realize he was rolling up fuzz balls and throwing them behind his couch at 11:04 & 11:14
My brother was at the dog park when 3 dogs running swept him off his feet and he landed on his head and got a concussion.
"Do they make brown cats?"   yeah, you can buy 1 get 1 at Walmart for $3.99
It’s easy to train a dog when they’re smart and trust you. It really doesn’t take much. In college, I had a 4 month old dog start to follow me when I was checking my mail. She had a collar on, but no tags. So we walked the neighborhood trying to find her owner. She followed me wherever I went, no one recognized her, no one claimed her, no one posted notices or anything, and she never ran off (for about the first 2 weeks in the morning when I let her go to the bathroom I didn’t put her on a leash and she still came back when she was done).   I had a roommate and I trained her not to go into his room. Just positive reinforcement. No shock collar, no water squirting for getting it wrong. Spent a couple minutes on it for a couple days in a row and she just wouldn’t go into the bedroom.  My roommate was dating this girl who ended up getting a kitten and she’d bring it over. My puppy (about 15 pounds at the time) wanted to play with this 2 pound kitten. The kitten didn’t want to play. They were in the living room, the kitten was trying to hide under the entertainment center, my dog was trying to pull it out. Then the kitten ran off into my roommate’s room (where his carrier was) and my dog started to chase him and then came to a dead stop at the bedroom door like she was trained to. She just sat there waiting for the kitten to come back out. My roommate’s girlfriend was beyond shocked, like she thought it was magic. It was one of the most impressive thing she’d seen.   When my dog and I moved. I trained her again not to go into certain areas of the house where my roommates were. Then, after college, when my roommates moved out and the house was all mine, I told her she could go into those parts of the house and she did, knowing it was ok.
Something makes me giggle so hard about the fact that this dog meme video has a “content created by licensed medical professional” certifier underneath it 😆😆
“It’s not breaking HIPAA if you tell your dog about your patients, right?” *BOOM* THE PRICE OF OUR WIRELESS EARBUDS ARE DOWN TO 2.59!
where'd you get the shirt from
Is there Bear merch like how Rosana Pansino has merch of her dogs?
you do look like him😂
Doctor Mike: dont stop~ retreovong~ Hold on~ to that~  Me: FINISH THE LYRICS ALREADY.
The moment the borzoi pop up I was like..."let me do it for you~" maybe the catching phrase for this ep might  be "let me peewoop~! for you"
Funny
Pet cat plsss everyone likeee :<
LET ME DOOOOOOOOOO IT FOR UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<3 my mother: heck no sho sho

There actually are brown cats, they're just EXTREMELY rare so chances of finding one is slim
8:39 this is so relatable, my dog once through up and ate his throw up again.
We need 155k more likes

Not Mike saying : Do they make brown cats What?!
Bear is my spirit animal 😂
We neeed to get Mike a cat
He doesn't get off at the wrong floor from the elevator  because it doesn't smell right....🐶🐾🐺

Get Bear a kitty!! 😻
You know, I have a corgi and 4:21 showed the BEST picture of corgis of all.
Where the cat at?
300k likes for a bear cat? Let's go 👺🤠🤟
My dog remembers being surrendered to the pound.  He get nervous at dog parks that have a setup like our local pound.  He's got separation anxiety at the vet.  He's also afraid of hair brushes.  He flinches and gets low to the ground whenever someone has one. He def remembers the bad stuff.  But we make sure he's got plenty good stuff for him to remember too.  We're his last family.  His forever home.
Aight, first off, Mythbusters proved both Jack and Rose could have survived I've on the makeshift raft. Just sayin.🤣
That is a man in a bear costume pretending to be a dog
GET A CAT THERE AWSOME i mean a chicken would be cool too
I can relate to the one about grabbing the keys. Every morning when I am getting ready for work, I have to put my boots on without the dog in the room or he sits on them. 🤣  Also, dogs really do make the best therapists. My weim always knows when I am not feeling right and gives me extra snuggles. I hope that with whatever was bothering you, you are able to get through it and feel better. I can't imagine the things you see or go through working your practice. I don't know if I could handle it all.
if you want to find a rescue dog you should look at sandy paws rescue, they have a lot of dogs. look at bert and ernie
Let me do it for you
Thank you so much for putting this in 2:38
Eeeee this made my week! Like shrieking with joy at doggo memes ❤ My Miss Hazel Crazel Poozle was super cool about HIPAA when I lived with her and worked from home. She even learned some CPT coding! 🤣
300K LIKES SO BEAR WOULD GET BROWN CATS. LEZGOOOO
I say no to vacuums because our dog barks at the vacuum (and it is sooooooooo anoyying)
I'm 30 I got anxiety, I got a dog (a rescue I gotta dog with anxiety
Oooooohh I wanna hug Bear!! Just give him all the hugs! If he’s ok with that of course ☺️
I think in Titanic that there was room on the debris, but it would have taken a lot of energy and numerous tries to balance it correctly. In that freezing cold water, and after everything they had been through that night, their energy reserves were dwindling quickly. Jack must've known that it would risk both Rose AND him if they kept trying, so he just made sure he did what he could for her so she'd survive. If she said, "Come up here!" and he refused, it might have stopped most of the annoying arguments about it because Jack would be sacrificing himself instead of so many people feeling that Rose sacrificed Jack. But if there was only room for 2, someone had to go, and Rose pushed someone else off, I'd see her as human, as protective of someone she cares about. We never know how we'll react in a life or death situation, especially when someone we love is also at risk. Even if it was just her and a stranger, only one would fit, and she pushed them off? I'd think nothing less of her, just as someone trying to survive.
Dr. Mike, is it unhealthy to curve my back a lot? If so how can I fix it?(keep my back straight is what I mean)
10:30 the edit in the laugh hit hard man.
doctor mike. when you get a rescue you need to be very aware of their mentality and history. a lot of rescues i have seen have some form of ptsd, anxiety, and depression as a lot of them i have seen were rescued from abuse. if you get an animal that was abused it may be afraid of people. animals will hold that trauma and not let anyone near them. they will struggle to trust you which would make it very hard to groom them, and take care of any other needs that would require being close to them. just like in a person it would take a lot of work to help them, through the trauma and in some they may never recover from it depending on personality.
Brown is an extremely rare colour for cats. Best of luck finding one or get a black cat, they often struggle the most finding a home
10:30 . "... I would like for my next dog to be a rescue, my concern is where to find one that  matches my personality...." Choose a breed or general rescue organization and be a foster home for adoption.... You can't keep them all & have to be prepared to let them go to a forever home, but one will come to you that WILL be in his/her forever home and stay.
welp the lost dog is me
as a fellow newfie owner 1. we do the Mohawk thing all the time. 2. have you considered a brown pomeranian as a friend dog? cause then you can walk bear one way past people and tge pomeranian the other way and pretend he shrunk.
Fun fact: when you have two very chill dogs you don't need an ac
Leh meh doo it for yoo
1.5 lakh is more thas 500.000 likes right so where is the cat
I have a Weiner dog called ginny! She is a mini red dachund! ♥
As someone who is planing to go into the animal industry the way you called the borzoi a whippet made me laugh a bit. I know my dog and cat breeds extremely well and even then I still make a few mistakes.
Or there’s 2 dogs 6:27.
Do thay make brown cats 😂😂😂
Doctor mike: what time is it   Me:time to get a cat
4:15 yes, they do. They're called York Chocolate cats and they typically cost $600+  and are extremely rare
Please get a cat anyway
Corgida is just below corga

Great video! Bear probably never gets off on the wrong floor of the elevator because he knows your body language when it's the correct floor.

Hey mike my downstairs neighbor has a dog named bear. He’s a king Shepard

I love corgis but if you are planning on getting one, you should know they are not "chill" dogs. They are herding dogs and need something to do. This is especially true for Pembroke Corgis.  Pembroke Corgis need 1-2 hours of exercise a day.  Cardigan Corgis are less energetic but still high energy. They do tend to calm down the older they get but when they are younger, they need daily exercising. They also tend to be bossy in that they try to herd other dogs around them  which is ok if Bear doesn't mind it. If you think Bear may get annoyed with that behavior, maybe foster a Corgi first to see if you and Bear are compatible. I use to really want a corgi also but then a friend of mine fostered one and that little bundle of energy never stopped moving. Corgis are sweet,  intelligent, and cute as a button but "chill" they are not. If you are looking for a dog that is low energy plus is good for anxiety and depression, pugs, great danes and King Charles spaniels are all good options. English bulldogs are a good option also but they do come with health issues but if you have the financial means to take care of the, they are really wonderful and loyal dogs.
Hello Mike, I hope you are doing well. For your anxiety, I recommend these verses which will help you a lot:  1 Peter 5:7  Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.   Psalms 34:4 I prayed the LORD, and hé answered me. He freed me from all my fears.   John 14:27 I am leaving you with gift  - peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don't be troubled or afraid.   Jesus loves you, open your heart to him, speak to him as if you were confiding in a friend or Bear 😊   Trust him he wants to restore you, take care of you. He is waiting for you, repent of all your sins and accept him as savior and lord. Rest well and may God bless you. Have a good week-end!
“Do they make brown cats” This is why Dr. Mike is a doctor and not a vet.
Yess Get a cat, Dr. Mike! They are wonderful pets!
I have a chiweenie (dachshund/chihuahua) and he is definitely loud when someone is at the door, but he's also very sweet and will be anyone's best friend.
No more medical only dogs
Titanic is messed up. A love story during a real event people suffered from? Let's just say what if there was 9/11 and there were two people who worked in Separate towers but then met each other not too long before the planes hit and fell in love. As their trying to escape one of the two had not escaped quicker then the movie ends with a phone call of them saying goodbye and how much they loved them.  That sounds a bit messed up tbh because so many people suffered from this event-  Also, What breed is bear? Chow chow was my only guess.
Do "THEY MAKE" brown cats?
Ever seen one of these videos and wonder if you are dying cus you think you might have a disease he explains
Yes get the Cat!!!!❤
Where is the shelter advice tho, i came to comments to look for it 👀
In my country we see dogs on the streets all of the time and trust me there is no tip to find one who matches your personality, you just find them and love them
"Do they make brown cats"                                              -Dr.Mike 2023
Bear almost taking out doc mike 😂
ummm sometimes corgis are not chill and they have a great herding instinct and they are such born with that.
Let me see that cat
When my cousins dog had surgery they put one of those pyjamas things on him and he immediately destroyed it and ended up with a cone instead. 😂
Does bear have a similar temperament to a great Pyrenees?
Yes you do look like your do
With you being an MD, does that make Bear a medicine pet?
when bear looked at you when you said kiss he was like loading..... loading......... it was so funny!
Omg the nicknames I go through with my dog and cats. From Boots, to Pookiebear, to who knows what else. Its Boots concurrently.
KITTEN KITTEN NOOWWWWWE3E333UEUEU4UYR
Dr. Mike, if only I was 33 again!!! Also, Bear is adorable and so sweet and cuddly!!! <3 Love these memes, lol!
GOES HOATS
I paused at 4:12 to like this video 😁
You need a French mastiff or dogue de bordeaux
corgis are not chill I have one and it is super hyper
BEARRRR
0:48 what the dog doin?
The level of dog person you are is making me so happy.
Ok so I definitely go too far hahah, because I really don't mind dog drool
Bear is the bestest boi
I’ve rescued dogs before. If you’re looking for a particular breed, you’ll probably have to go on a waiting list. If any mix would do and you’re going based on personality, which is what I did, you should do foster to adopt.
There's probably only a couple of good ways I can think of to find a rescue a Goldie animal shelter on a regular basis so you can meet the animals and choose one you can take them out for walks and eventually learn which one seems like the best for you when you finally decide one you want to adopt you don't know which one then he's always good to be able to and volunteer at the animal shelter
It's only breaking HIPAA if your dog ever learns to speak a language that humans can understand otherwise you're fine
2:41 DIDNT I DO IT FOR YOUUU
Noooo we didn’t get to the cat goal nooooo
Pupper. We are here for pupper.
Let me do it for youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
YES.
bear is so cute, i have a newfypoo and they look so similar awh
Still waiting for the 300k likes
I dont think it wasnt physically possible for both Jack and Rose to fit on the door, just not practical. James Cameron even said that they intentionally made the object Rose was on just big enough for her, otherwise, the two of them surviving would have ruined the plot line.
My 135lb English Mastiff is a bedhog that likes to cuddle.  Just make sure you're a big spoon. Otherwise, you get kicked by dream chasing feet.
YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE😍
So back in the day we had a doberman. She would fetch the ball once. If you threw it a second time she'd look at you funny like "Why'd you get me to bring it back if you are just going to throw it away again?"
Yes pleaseeee. Bear needs a bear cat sibling.
4:38 does that yellow broken looking teeth supposed to be there between the canine and the incisors?
SOOO CUTE
Hi
What breed is bear?
I want bear but he would crush me instantly
130lbs according to google is around 58kg... Bear is heavier than me!
How about homemade chicken nuggets there's a YouTuber who has dogs  called gone to the snow dogs who made them
300000 likes guys cone on!!! We want a feline friend on this channel
Not all dogs can be crate trained 😥. My pit gsd mix ate through her kennel as a 4 month old (the biggest one we could order). Through the metal cage part, not the plastic. Also ate 2 glass coffee pots, the walls,  the doorknob etc. She never swallowed any of it and somehow never even cut herself. Now she's the best dog ever but I'd never had a dog so smart with that much energy and I was the one that needed training. Now we go for 2x45min-1 hour walks a day and do extreme playing and a ton of mental challenges. And she gets tons of treats during. I've lost like 15-20 pounds just from playing and walking her. And then there's our teacup Chihuahua who screams when he poops and our toy poodle who is convinced she is not a dog, shes a child. They have their own couch in our kitchen. IN THE KITCHEN! lmaooo
Thank you. You really pushed the sarcasm 🤣😂🤣 I went through 24 hours of hard labor the doctor said each time I had a baby. My husband at the time with the first one wouldn't let me use anything for the pain plus the midwife told me to stop screaming it wasn't so bad. The second & third time I went to the hospital & had a male doctor who made sure I recieve my epidural & actually told me to scream. I didn't though I had an epidural 😂 Makes do not understand. I had to be in bed the last three months because I would lose the babies each time. Why? My husband demanded me to work around the clock. 😂 Oh my. So much I have learned.
What dr mike ain’t bears twin huh
Awe I want a fren to bear
I have a request for you Dr Mike, can you please play Maple Hospital on Roblox?  It would be like continuing the series of playing minecraft
@11:00 Myth Busters busted that myth and both Jamie and Adam both fit on the headboard. So that would mean Jack could have been saved.
My working theory about why dogs want to come back in just to go outside again is because they're trying to lead you outside with them so you two can play together.  My only issue is that I have a limited data pool of just me and my dog.
For finding rescue dogs, if you have a breed in mind that works for your lifestyle, from there you can narrow down different rescue organizations that target specific breeds, and connect with them about more specific personality matching.
Does that mean i could like my cat?? Or is it it just dogs-
Vet doctor reacting to vet memes when ?
C'mon everyone! We need to get bear a cat friend! We also need to petition to name it Yogi
You don’t look like him but he is a very very nice boy.
Our Border Collies have been brought up with cats and it wasn't unusual for the cat to sneak into the whelping box or join pups for their feeds. Crowley, our black cat is very much part of the pack.
Corgis aren't chill. They are full-on working dogs like Border Collies, and hyper. Both types of corgi are lovely.
Aww, I'm glad that Bear's toys don't look like the husks that my dog leaves behind 😅. My dog removes the eyes, nose, and ears with almost surgical precision before taking out the stuffing. And yay, thanks for considering adopting a pet from a rescue!
oh yeah what breed of dog is that
PLEASE! I DON’T CARE THAT THE VIDEO DOESN’T HAVE 300k LIKE! I want to see a bear cat!

This Video Needs More Likes. Do it for the cat.
That is not a dog. That's a fuckin BEAR! I mean, his name is Bear so it makes sense, but STILL
Good editors make everything funnier
Best way to find a dog that’s compatible with you, your lifestyle and other current pets is to foster! Shelters always need more fosters
I own a wiener dog her name is cookie
1:26 so funny bc my mom showed my that today😂  (I’ve seen it on Pinterest a year or two ago)😂🫣🐻🐶
Dr mike took "I named my dog five miles" to another level
Jeez bear is prob gunna get a friend already 130k
WHAT DA HAIIIIILLL!!!
Get bear a Siberian Forest cat. They are large and dog like.
my friend got a dog and she was 150LBS! also when he  got her she was jumping all over the place.
I work for an animal shelter called Eleventh Hour Rescue based out of northern New Jersey. I would highly recommend them if you’re looking to adopt a dog.
I LOVE BEAR 🐻 ❤️❤️
Well as a german I can say he's not pure bread, he's pure sandwich bread. Don't call it bread. Just don't ;) 😂
Yeah the unhealthy stuff in muffins is soooo hidden, *nobody* would think they're unhealthy 😂😂  Did you also look at chocolate like "Uh it's just a snack!"?😂
‘Do they make brown cats’
In the Titanic movie they initially both try to get on the door and you visually see why it doesn't work. People just like gettin' they knickers all a-twist for no reason.
Bear is so cute…but I am a Corgi man
Hay is working out 8 to 9 times a week good
Can tell he's been neutered.
Could I just say, it would be very interesting to watch a cooperation between you and Girl With The Dogs! You could tell her about the work you do and how hard grooming actually is on the body, and she could give you some tips on how to groom your dog (not that you don't know, but it might be fun and we might all learn some stuff)!
Doctor Mike, have you ever seen the show Psych???
I’ve got a couple of wiener dogs now and yes, they are so sweet!
i have 2 rescue cats, i call them dr.Margherita and dr.Luna since they fix my sad and depression and mental health
Bear is a great name for a dog of that size. The name doesn’t really make sense if the dog is a little dog. Also, when I get my own house I am really thinking about adopting the same dog breed as your bear.
Really still would love to see you collaborate with Girl With The Dogs. Have Bear groomed while learning facts from her.
Yesss shelter pups are the BEST! 💕 My advice would be go to the shelter and talk to the staff about what you're looking for. They know each dog's unique personality and are experienced in what makes for a good match. Typically they allow you to take a dog outside or in a separate room and play with it to see if yall are a good pair. If there's a dog you really like you can then go back with Bear to see how they do together.
PLSSS I HAVE A CAT HE LOOK LIKE BEAR PLSSS BUY A CAT
Come on y'all, bear needs that cat!!!!
I love bear so much!!!  I want a bear dog!!  So cuteeee
I have a tip for getting a rescue pup, so what you should do is go find a shelter and or pound and see if there’s any dogs that interest you then come back with Baer so he can meet the rescue dog and the reason you would bring bear is so he can approve of the dog and so you can make sure they would get along at home and not just be uncomfortable and or aggressive around each other. ❤❤❤❤❤ (PS: I know this because this is what I did to get my rescue pupper)😊😊😊😊😊
I saw the chicken nugget one on yt and I picked my doge
You need to do dog TikToks!!!
WE NEED TO GET BEAR A BROWN CAT ASAP!!
Uh, Corgis are herding dogs.. they have no chill at all lol. Mine is made out of nothing but pure energy and ears.  😂😂
Kermit~
2:41 is a Russian Borzoi
I have a winie his name is nugget☺☺☺
I bet Bear is an excellent cuddler
I have no idea where you live but if where you live has a humane society that is the best place to find any sort of rescue pet
OK QUICK DISCLAIMER TO WHAT IM ABOUT TO SAY I AM NOT A DOCTOR, but no I don't think it's against hippa to tell your dog, even more so if you don't use the names
Not me liking a video specifically so a newfie named Bear gets his own matching pet cat…
Best video ever
Omggggg
When Anxiety begins at heart ,mind can't  think anymore in a healthy way. Can humanity get rid of Anxiety, or we are really the generation of ........
Such a good floofffy boyyy❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Didn't Mythbusters test it and proved it was possible? If so I'll take actual field data over just data
If you want to rescue you could get a rescue greyhound! They are retired racing dogs, and they can be anxious at times and they’re a lot of work at first, but once they warm up to you they’re the nicest dogs ever!
The whippet was actually a borzoi
Your hair is just as fluffy is bear also he’s a doctor dog in Tom and jerry! So yup! You’re both doctors!
There are brown cats, but truly brown cats have genetic issues, so don’t get one. Also corgis are amazing! I have one and I love the breed. Get from a reputable breeder and properly train them and they will be the best dog you’ll ever have!
so  my dog gong to die hes pretty obeste
10:37 instead of looking in a shelter you could work with a local rescue that has fosters. They often know the dog better, see it’s personality in a relaxed environment, and can support meet and greets with the great Bear. Then you’re freeing that home up to rescue another dog from the shelter. Win-win!   Also if you get a cat you should check out a cat cafe with adoptable kitties. They’re WAY more sociable and tend to be more relaxed from all the stimuli.
Hey doctor mike, what are some signs that my dog has asthma
Awh man dachshunds are awesome if your train them well and give them lots of love they are the best dogs I had a chiweenie (chihuahua weenie dog mix) and she was super friendly loved everyone (unless you gave the bad vibes and we're not a good person) she was my shadow and went on like a million adventures with me 😭 😂 loved car rides and cats 10/10 would do anything to have her again
I love how everyone does "paw! Now other paw!" Instead of left and right paw it's funny
OMG a brown cat just lying on top of brown Bear, being chill with the chill dog??? HOLY MOLY THAT WOULD BE THE DREAM 😭😭
You can make muffins with applesauce instead of oil tho.
"Hit me down below"
Nice.
I have a Bernese Mountain Dog and she fetches about 3 times before she's over it !
You're such a sweet soul. It's the way you talk and what you talk about. Watching this video i see dr Mike and hear the real Mike.
8:19 as a owner a dog, i could agree to make this as alarm, because nothing can wake me at 2 am like my dog trowing up
My puppies are crate trained
Greyhounds are a great dog if you want a couch potato and are rescued from the races if they underperform.
If u wanna find a rescue doggo that matches ur personality, just when u have the chance, start visiting your local shelters and asking if you can see and meet some of the dogs and they will take u to all the good bois. I believe most shelters will also let you take the dog for a walk or go in with them so you can see if you vibe together. Hope I helped!
mu -kwa
I witnessed a dog fight, and I almost lost my hand because the boar my dog was fighting almost took my hand off fortunately I moved my hand away before it could clasp down on my hand, but the pig wasn't so lucky. I was though because I had a pretty good dinner.
Name of 'wiener dog' is daschund (dak -sund) not wiener dogs
you've ruined muffins for me 😅
U need a German shepherd!
The myth busters tested the door thing. The only was it would have worked is if they put the life jacket under the door, but they weren’t thinking clearly, because, you know, they were panicking because the ship was sinking
*me telling my friend/ roommate why we can’t have a dog* also me *sees bear* actually I’m fine never mind
0:34  yes. You’re a bear, the dog to
Doctor Mike kinda does look like bear
I think dr Mike should get an orange cat and call her\him🧡 Honey 🧡 so they can be a   honey bear  together  just imagine how cute that will sound when you call them 🧡🧡

That “dog with anxiety “ meme was meant for me and my beagle
Taking the proper time to get a new, especially rescue dog, to know you and you get to know them is so important. Went to visit a dog that I thought was a good match for us and, for some reason, he refused to get close to me, despite regular visits. Went to see some other and I have found what my husband refers to as my soul mate: traumatised, anxious but wants to be loved by everyone and loves sleeping all the time, especially with me.    Just take your time. It is worth it.
YOU MATCH BEAR!!
GET THIS TO 300K PLS!!! I REALLY WANT TO SEE BEAR REACT TO A CAT WITH HIM!!!
Doc! Are you seriously tossing hair balls behind you as you groom your dog with your fingers? Is that an anxiety thing? OCD?
the rescue process can be exhausting and frustrating but at the end of it is a dog that will always be there for you.  Keep searching and you will find the right fit for you.   Bear is great.   As long as the dog is happy and healthy that is what is most important.
You can probably go to a rescue for dogs and you can probably play some
This video is literally:  *Sees meme*  Doctor Mike: “But honestly, Bear doesn’t do that, he…”  Just proves that Bear is an EXTRA good boy ❤
The school bus full of dogs is amazing, look them up! It's a couple in Alaska who have a dog sitting business. They take them off hikes! The videos are wonderful!
There is a scene in titanic, either deleted or in the extended version, where he tries to get on the door, but it can't support more than her wait and tells other people it's just for her.
i mean at least Bear doesn't run around when he throws up like my cat 😭✋🏻
docter mike is sleazer and water togethre
9:37 I have a cat but I relate to this so much!! How can she be that small but take up over half of my bed?????
Not only do I identify with about half of these memes I have also sent about half of these memes to friends within the last few days 😂😂
I saw an interview with James Cameron and he's like there was enough room on the door. The things they do in movies to pull at our heart strings right.
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
If you do decide to buy a shelter dog instead of buying from a breeder, just avoid pitbulls. Pits are mostly what you will find in the shelter. They were originally bred to fight other pitbulls in a pit, and attack chained bulls and bears. Hence the name, Pitbull. No amount of love or training removes their genetics. This is why they kill people and pets so often, despite being raised from puppies with only love. They are unpredictable and will kill their owner. Their is a myth all man biters were culled, but that just isn’t true. Obviously.   Unfortunately there is a lot of propaganda out there that they are nanny dogs (myth created in 1971) or great family dogs. They are good catch dogs when hunting hogs or coyotes, and of course great at fighting which is illegal now.   So unless your using it to catch aggressive prey, and you have no children, and no other dogs, look for another breed.   I recommend to just buy from a good breeder. They screen the parent dogs and puppies for health problems, breed good temperament, and the puppy will have no unknown history like shelter dogs. And you get to choose the breed that has temperament that works for you. Not everyone needs a border collie, or hound dog, etc.   Shelters will actually adopt out pitbulls and dogs that have killed people, or bitten them unfortunately. It’s best to avoid shelters.

Usually, shelters allow you to take one of their dogs out into an enclosed area where you can play, interact and get to know them. It's usually really obvious what their personality is after these sessions. Shelter workers also usually will either know the personality themself, or their info page on their kennels will have a personality sections you can check.  Local shelters are the best usually, sometimes I try to find who's been there the longest and give them a shot ♥
you smacks* ...
When I get a dog I’m gonna get a rescue, looking for a pregnant dog and then taking one of its babies is my idea
You look like bear🥰
Show us your dog more often
I'd recommend going to local shelters from my experience if you don't like a challenge to maybe get a really difficult dog! :)  I'm getting my 4th dog on the 11th, 1 from the shelter, 3 from animal welfare. Only 2 I got to see before I bought them.  The first dog - Rocky, neglected in a household in France (we live in Germany) - was from our local shelter. We dropped some stuff we still had from our rabbits and guinea pigs, went to look at the dogs after and saw him. It was love at first sight, asked if we could go into his cage, they agreed and he was really happy about it. We had to walk him a few times in order to get him, so we already had an idea about what he's like. Also all shelters have a description about the dogs (most of the time at least) that's mostly pretty accurate. The people from the shelter visited us a few weeks after to see if the dog was fine (also to mention: we knew the people working there for a long time, so they'll probably check before if they don't know you).  The second dog - Pepsi, thrown over the fence of a killing station in a plastic bag with her sisters, from Rome/Italy - was at a private persons house where she cared for a few dogs from different animal welfare organizations, some of them directly from a killing station.  We saw one we liked on the homepage from a local shelter and made an appointment. We kinda met "all" dogs (since they lived together) and could directly interact with them and another dog caught our attention. We could bring her home over the weekend to see how we could fit. We didn't get any visitation from anyone from the shelter before or after. Both of them were absolutely beautiful dogs! But Pepsi needed a lot of work since she was scared of men and any rustling bags. You'll never know what they had to endure.   Our third dog - Tia - is also from animal welfare. We didn't meet her before, we only saw pictures and had a description of her on Facebook. She was still in Bucharest/Romania when we bought her. Someone visited us beforehand and they decided if we're suitable to own a dog.  Once new owners are found, they drive them every Friday through Hungary, Austria and Germany. They have around 50-60 dogs in their transporter and we had to drive for 2hrs to get her, since they only stop every so often to drop off dogs (and cats!) to a handful of people at the same time. All the time from their start in Romania, through every stop, we got notifications about how the dogs are feeling and what time to get them (we had one big messenger group). We got a quick crash course of what to expect, how not to wash them right away, etc. But beware: Those descriptions aren't necessary true! I saw from the pictures she'll get bigger than they said (and she was even bigger than we thought when we saw her xD), but we couldn't judge her character. They wrote she's puppy-like. Playful and open. She wasn't but all ther siblings were. She's a really scared, shy dog (and you could tell from her pictures that she doesn't trust those people around her). Even after nearly 2 years she still is easy scared and it'll probably never change. She wasn't feeling well from the journey (it were over 24hrs for her) and we could only take her, if we had a transport box (otherwise a car/seat belt for dogs (idk how to call it in english) was fine).  People from welfare said a lot of dogs are given back and I kinda understand why. It's hard to make a proper introduction for everyone of them because there are sooo many and probably not enough people looking after them. Especially dogs from Romania where they treat them mostly just bad (even "normal" owners won't treat their dogs good) will all be kinda traumatized and it can be really hard. One of Tia's sisters bites and needs a muzzle now, a brother is also kinda aggressive and wants to do his own thing. On the other hand: Tia may be scared easily but she is a super sweet girl now that listend really good as long as nothing spooks her! But: If she would've been our first dog, we would've been totally overchallenged and probaly looked for someone who could handle her. It was hard even with experience from traumatized shelter dogs.  And the 4th will be from the same organization as Tia is (and they visited us beforehand again, but since they knew we already have a dog from them we were prioritized and the dog was already reserved before out meeting). We also have only pictures of him, but some where he playes with someone and overall really playful, interested looking photos. So probably not as scared as Tia. The woman saving him also told us he'll be playful and not scared. I still think he'll get a little bigger than they wrote but for me that's no problem. I mean.. you see the pictures, if you know your dogs breeds you kinda know how big they may get.  It can also be pretty hard to tell which race the dog is, so you probably won't get any idea of what his characteristics can be, what they need to be happy (eg a lot of work) or possible race-specific illnessess that could occur. Buying a dog over the internet and without being able to see them can be extremly hit or miss, so I recommend already having experience with more difficult dogs! As someone with experience with only proper treated dogs/puppies from breeders or privat, I'd choose local shelters, that make sure you meet them a few times to make sure you'll fit any day!
Doctor Mike making me scared of every food
I mean, mike is russian so he picks a dog that looks exactly as bear
what type of dog is Bear? he is so cuteee ❤❤
Yesss please rescue a pup! I can only speak for my shelter, but we have you fill out the application, which asks general information about you, your training methods, any other pets, etc. My favorite people are the ones who are like who would be the best fit for me rather than I WANT THIS ONE even if they are a horrible fit. We work with people to find who is the best fit for them. We require our shelter dog to meet their dog to make sure they get along, and if all goes well we send them home :) Most shelters try to make it as easy as possible
As a corgi owner, I always support corgi ownership, but they are not chill dogs. Since they’re bred for herding, they’re pretty athletic and little control freaks. I love my baby, but she has lots of energy. We take her 3 pretty long walks a day, and she always wants to play.
I love wheiner dogs i have one full bred one and one dachshund shih-zu mix they are so cudly once you get the to like you they will love you and never wanna leave you side.
I found the trick with rescue animals is to let the animal pick you, I would bring them all home but all 3 of my pets over the years made it quite obvious I was their person
Doctor Mike, have you ever done Bear’s genetic health screening?  I work in canine genetics so I had to ask.
thank u for sharing <3
PEEWOOF I wanna meet bear but I'm so far away I'm in iowa
bear is adorable
I have a Sausage dog (British version of a wiener dog) and he looks just like the one in that photo behind bear. He’s turning 2 this year!
Just got a dog  a maltese/lhasa mix best decision ever! Love this!
SO I HAVE A REALLY FIESTY CAT HER NAME IS PEPPER. 4:47 ON THAT TIME, THAT IS WHAT MY CAT DOES. pepper says, “let me innnnnn MEOW, I wanna tell u I want back outttttt. MEOW”
WAIT YOU CALL DOGS DOGOS TOO?!😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

What are you going to do dr.Mike when bear leaves u’s😅
Ooh you should get bear a cat and call it tiger🫶🏼🫶🏼
Did you get the cat?
GET BEAR A FELINE FREIND!!   LIKE THE VIDEOOOOOOOO
Fun fact brown cats are the rarest color... Try a Chantilly Tiffany they are kinda like the cat version of Bear but black and brown and red and gray LOL... Another fun fact Chantilly Tiffany is a rare breed and mostly found in shelters in the US.
How to adopt a dog from the shelter: 1. Go to the shelter 2. Look at the dogs 3. Leave with all the dogs
make..cats?
Cesar Millan can help you find the right dog for you and Bear!
my wiener never barks ahah win for me
cuteness overload, beautiful pair
Can it be actually dangerous if a dog licks your face...like Bear does with you?
we don't need to talk about blue berry muffins like that lol
3:22 Mike hyping bear about the chihuahua muffin made my day 😂😂❤
Doctor Mike  Can you make a video about PCOS and insulin resistance
Welcome back Dr. Mike
I would put my dog in a crate, but we got her from a shelter and she’s afraid of crates. If we put her in a crate she freaks out.
2:31 Apparently this is a … Borzoi??  Ya learn something new everyday I guess 😊 Also 3:34 They use cake batter to make muffins. Muffins are cupcakes in disguise.
I'm 25 and already have a dog, anxiety and a dog with anxiety. Am I winning? Lmfao
I feel like I'm the only person that watched what actually happened when Jack tried to get on the door.. When he did, it tipped and submerged and she almost fell back in the water.   Because he loved her, he accepted his fate. You literally can see the very moment when he does so. On another note OMGGGG BEAR IS SOOOO FREAKING ADORABLE 😍 🥰🥰🥰🥰
🤞🏼 how do I get more people to come like this video so bear can get a cat ❤
If you want to adopt, it might take a while to find the right dog, but good shelters help match up the right person to the right dog. If you think about it, getting a dog from a breeder has no more of a guarantee of getting a dog with the right temperament than a shelter dog. My pupper is adopted, and she is the goodest of girls.
I work at a shelter and we have puppies in the office ❤ they help us shred files and file documents lol
Come on! Let's get it 300,000 likes! We need to see Bear but cat version!
My tip for a security dog is for a German Shepherd Because I've had a German Shepherd for most of my life and he was good :)
Bear is a good boy!
LOOK OUT THERE IS A GIANT 🐻
Mike shouting muffins are bad for you: You don't know how much cholesterol and fat there is in muffins! Me about to get a muffin rn:
IM LIKEING FOR THE CAT >:)
I showed my daughter who is autistic the picture of the dog in the slice of bread with the caption “pure bread” and she replied, “Actually, that one’s IN bread.”
I don't know why this suddenly came to my mind. But if Mike and BangChan from StrayKidz collaborate for any kind content (mental health, exercising or anything), that would be epic.  Feels like both have similar personality.
I wanna let dat doggo
The McDonalds meme the dog looks exactly like mine I have a pit bull mix
RESCUE DOGS: If you know of a specific breed that you would like, there are rescue organizations specifically oriented towards most breeds. Shelters are always full of pitbulls; any other breeds are adopted by someone within a week.  Since you like less athletic dogs, I highly suggest looking into greyhounds. After about 2 years of racing they are abandoned or put down but they actually make great companions. While everyone associates them with being really fast runners and racing dogs, they are actually couch potatoes and are perfectly happy to laze around most of the day so long as they do get to go for a long walk or a quick sprint around a park or track every once in a while.
Wait, has this turned into Dogtor Mike?
I love Bear too but you do know male dogs clean themselves?  😂
I used to have an old friend whose mastiff loved to rest his head on my lap whenever I'd visit. I'd always have to throw the slobbered pants into the laundry and take a shower to wash off what had seeped through.
I would love to see a reaction video of nhl worst injuries i love your work dr Mike keep up the great work. Also sending hello all the way from newfoundland to the sweet cuddly big newfie bear 🤎
Dr. Mike: It’s not breaking HIPPA if you tell your dog is it?  Me: 🤔
I once had this big fluffy dog named Shadow, dad’s nickname for him was “Crazy Old Galoomph”.
You should react to all the injuries from the TV show the boys
You probably already know this as a doctor but having 2 eye colors is called heterochromia.
Listen sir.. not all of us can own dogs, so if we wanna go overboard this one time to feel doggie-love and moisturize our dry a** face.. you need to let us! 😩😂 Pupper love comes once in a blue moon for us 😅
Please talk about artificial sweeteners 🙏🙏
My dog nicknames are (her actual name is blanca) : blanca,blancosh, nunchaka,blanci,nuncha,boo bonet,
My dad has been ill for a while he lost 10kg and still losing weight because cant eat meat. When he eat meat and dairy he experience abdominal pain. We give some test at hospital but doctors doesnt say anything helpful or name the disease. Can you give me advise?
That greyhound was actually a Borzoi A Havana cat are bear brown colored

That bread do be doing it for you tho
I just went to the shelter and looked at the dogs. And my rescue dog and I just clicked. I think you'll know when the dogs for you.
Let’s get Bear the Kitty ❤
It's so weird that "crate training" seems to be standard in the US. On this side of the puddle it's really rare and mostly being discouraged.
React to another dhar man video
That bear looks like a dog🤔…
"It's not breaking HIPAA if you tell your dog about your patients, right?" Now I'm picturing my doctor talking to her dog about me. I like it.
Out of context, that Titanic meme, Mythbusters proved that there was a way for both Jack and Rose to be on the driftwood at the same time, but it didn't happen due to plotline.
I’ll let you borrow my dog for the day.    And she likes Bear from their one meeting last year.
Doctor mike: If this video get 300k I will get  cat that looks like bear  Me: GET THIS TO 300K NOW
The waffle house has found it's new host
Ok storry time when i was young my grandparents got a puppy and i picked the puppy and some time i would drop him so when he grew up    he always growes at me 😅😭😭

CAN YOU PLEASE WATCH  THIS IS GOING TO HURT FROM THE UK BASED ON THE BOOK BY ADAM KAY
Hi Dr. Mike, I have a question: Do you speak with Bear in English or Russian? Being bilingual myself I always wondered. Keep up with the good videos, thank you!
Them dogs are Borzois, a Russian dog that was bred to hunt wolves or predators
2:24 I love that dog. We’re Matallica buddies now I can tell😂❤🐾
I LOVE BEAR
MORE BEAR VIDS PLLLLSSSSS
here for the video likes, let’s get Bear a lil buddy 😢🐈‍⬛
Dogs don’t think humans make mistakes, so if you accidentally kick them because it’s dark and you can’t see they think you just kicked them
Let me do it for you let me do it for you all I do is for you, Dr. Mike oh yeah Dr. Mike if I was any part of the body be hbaallffhh
We never had a crate for our dogs and they were fine. Never ate a shoe, never ate the couch, nothing. They did however bark a lot at everything that moved in our street...
Hey Doctor Mike I knew this guy in my village in India who didn't eat or drink for 60-70 years I would love for you to react to a video about him. His nickname was "Chunri Wala Mataji". I was so confused when I met him and even my grandfather who was a doctor who checked up on him a couple times was confused.
I want 300k for the cat
That crate thing seems cruel...cuddear.
My dogs nicknames are rottie,poofie,Elsa Belsa, baby and stinky
Bomb sniffing dog........really 😂. It's called a bomb DETECTING dog

Mike! Sponsor a Cuban 🇨🇺!! Sponsor a Cuban doctor!! 🙄 Me!!
Brown cats are rare but my parents had one named Cocoa
There is enough room, just myth busters shows you got to put life jackets under the door frame before
We need to get this video more likes so he can get a cat!!!!
My friend has a big chocolate lab who gets really excited when people visit and runs up to them to say hi. Unfortunately, his head is about the height of my groin so every time I visit, he headbutts me in the nuts
Don’t get a corgi if you want a chill dog!! They are extremely high energy. They need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation, they’re extremely athletic and very smart. We just had to re-home ours, and it was devastating. We had our third child and our dog needed more attention than we were able to provide, poor little boy was miserable 🥺
When he asked for suggestions about rescue dogs and said "hit me down below" I pictured someone kicking him in the peewop - be careful with your phrasing Dr. Mike!
Corgis are chill lol
8:29 I couldnt stop laughing lmao
Mike: let’s react to some dog memes and just have a good time with it, also Mike: finds slightest medical thing and says okay let me break this down🤣
Dr Mike teaches me better then my health teacher
I ship kall me kris+doctor mike
When it was the let me do it for u Before it was the meme I said "lemme do it for you" then the meme started playing and I'm like: EXACTLY
Hey! I work in an urgent care and had a patient recently that said she was allergic to “all antibiotics” and when I clarified and asked if she’d done allergy tests for that and she said yes. Is this possible and how would an infection be treated in a patient like that? She said doctors had prescribed abx before and also made her take OTC benedryl as directed with the abx until she was done with the course. She said that stopped working. Help!
Get a black Norwegian forest cat.
2:28 Thats a snow goose not a duck
HAHAHAHAHA
Depends on how you make your muffins
Currently watching this in bed while my corgi lays next to me 🥰
My dog just died so this is kinda comforting. Thank you
If you need a good doggo look for a old English bulldog
GET THE CATTT!!!!
As someone who works at a shelter... get him a cat. Just be sure to do a proper introduction and to slowly introduce the cat into the home and to your dog. There's a lot of guides to it (and I'm happy to explain it!), and there are always plenty of cats who need homes, especially during the warmer months and the horrid kitten season. You can also train gets and can walk them on a harness and even put them in cat backpacks. It's easier to start out with kittens, since they are more malleable, but there are adult cats who might be accustomed to such lifestyles and are less adverse to change. :)  That being said, good luck finding a solid brown cat. I believe it's the rarest colour in cats or certainly one of them. I have personally only ever seen a few pictures here and there. You could get a long or medium black cat pretty easily, though! Black cats still have a harder time getting adopted than any other colour.
what breed is bear? i want one one hes so sweet
i think it would be cool if you could react to one of glooms videos if you don’t know her shes just a youtuber that does a lot of dif things i think you should react to the one called: things only unlucky girls relate to. But thats just a recommendation 👍🏻
I know you probably get this comment all the time  but why do I you let bear  kiss your face but dogs have germs in their mouth and dogs mouths are dirtier than humans
Bear is a Newfie!? I’m from Newfoundland! ❤
Sharing the float would have ruined the movie.
yes there are brown cats! fully brown that look reddish under sun is a bit rare though
I have an idea! React to Ozzy and Drix (A series after the movie Of Osmosis Jones)
I made a Bewoop at the beginning of my race or just before it then made 1st team all county, I’m convinced it has magic involved
MythBusters did a Titanic episode, and they figured out that if they took off the life jacket that she was wearing and tied it around so it was under the piece of wood they both could have laid on it just fine and survived. ^^
Come on guys, we need Mike to get a cat!
Bear is happy
I like to watch your videos because I want to be a paramedic
Mike not recognizing a Russian Wolfhound (Borzoi) was oddly...odd...  But, at least he got the right family (sight hounds)
Doctor? Is okay for a dog lick your face and mouth? I'm ain't that no sanitary? Am asking cause am curious
6:27 its 2 dogs...
react to the last of us show
Bear is so cute
You definitely look like bear. You both have that that brow combed hair. XD
As somebody who grew up playing ice hockey. And it currently is ice hockey season. I would love to see Doctor Mike react to NHL injuries.
You should react to skateboarding injuries
Dr. Mike I have a question: A couple years ago I did something to my lower back, kinda near the tailbone, I also had to sit about two inches away from the wall for a month and a half. I sat in a really awkward position for most of the day. I now have a lot of back pain in the middle of my back and feel like I always have to pop it. Every time I talk to my PCP about it and I just get told to stretch even when I live a active lifestyle. I also started getting really sharp pain on the left side of my abdomen. What can I do? 🥲
Hey Mike I need a true and honest answer my mommy says that lesson problems with eating not like any problems or think like I eat too much I know that it's probably binging but I'm not too sure can you give me please
8:18 so true. I am SPEED when Jake makes that sound ☠️☠️☠️
0:31 yes 🐶❤
One of my dogs lost her eyes due to our bigger dog accidentally catching her tooth on the eye. The dog got back on the vet and started wagging her tail at the big dog as if they were best friends. We to this day don't know hwy he wasn't negatively affected by it. She obviously cried out for help when it happened but still.
What would my thoughts be? Rose was ride or die, like me. 🌹🩸🕶️
My dog is a rescue, we got him from adopt-a-dog in Armok, NY. We basically took a personality test and picked pictures of dogs we found interesting. They had us meet 3, I had an instant connection with my dog and wanted to take him home that day. They basically had us sleep on it, I used the week to get a bed and some toys and treats for him. Then because my husband’s active duty, we got our dog and his kennel free. ❤
YALL WE NEED TO GET BEAR A CAT. SMASH THE LIKE BUTTON RN!!!!!
The Havana brown is a brown cat.
I don't usually stop to like videos, but I really like the cat idea. I grew up with both cats and dogs, so I thought that was normal until I realized how many people are either dog or cat people. I think it would be great to show that you can be both (and to learn about any evidence-based best practices for helping them get along). Also, please ask LegalEagle about disclosing information to your dog (or anything really, because your last collabs were so great). :)
I have two rescues; one I got based on 'I need an older dog' (because I had a very old dog at that point and a young dog would have bothered her, so I adopted an 8-year-old) and the other I got almost purely on looks (reminded me of my old dog). They are the opposites of each other in every way, but somehow both exactly perfect for me. You never know 100% what you get with rescues, they can be very different in shelter conditions than how they are at home, and a lot of them also have trauma to heal from, so they'll change over time. Of course you can expect behaviours/temperaments based on breeds and of course if you get to meet the dogs beforehand that can help with the selection process. I think rescue dogs are great, they are no worse than other dogs, and by getting one you are helping that dog get a new life.
1:12 AYOO?
The MythBusters actually tested that Titanic myth and the science says Jack and Rose should have been able to float on that wood.
God I love these videos bear is like the hagrid of dogs! He's so massive oh he's so cute 🥰🥰🥰 but he dose kinda look like hagrid hehe
I Dont recommend getting a corgi but if you do be very careful with it's back cause I have one and he was playing in the yard and he slipped a disc in his back so just be careful they're nice dogs but pretty fragile
Collab with Rocky Kanaka to find the perfect rescue dog for you! He'd take matching you very seriously and he does great things so it'd be a great channel to highlight!
“Do they make brown cats?” Dr Mike, 2023
Can YouTube reacting to airplane medical situations
Is it just me or has anyone seen him on a billboard??
Dr mike is it weird that I randomly get like lighting like pains in my heart
C'mon people! Bear needs a cat!!! Like the video!
0:33 I mean hair color 😂
Yes you do
Tip to get a rescue dog: go to the shelters. Look for one you are interested in and might like. See if the feeling is mutual. It’s always about the feeling.   Other thing is taking old dogs that nobody wants. People are looking for puppies because it’s cute and sometimes abandon their dogs once they’re ‘too old’. It’s a good way to give them a good end of life, they all deserve to be loved until it’s time.
Already over 100k likes in just 3 days. Looks like Bear will be getting a new friend soon 🐈‍⬛.
Doc my mom is a nurse and I had that honey heals headache is that true?
Doctor Mike, I recommend reacting to the bite of 83 and other Fnaf injuries and talk about them! ^w^
hello mike, i have a request. could you react to the Isle of man TT race and say your opinion and or any injuries that could be caused? it would be greatly appreciated.
I love that Doctor Mike thinks corgis are chill 😂 mine has absolutely no chill lol
Dogy
Hi Dr. Mike! I just wanted to tell you that, indeed there are brown cats, that actually look exactly like bear! They are rare, but more common in America rather to where I live. They are called “Havana Browns” and I believe they can be long hair!
Absolutely love this! but my comment is actually about something else. I recently watched one of your videos reacting to the show My 600lb life. I find Dr. Now to be obnoxious and rude. I know that part of that is for TV and the American penchant for drama. Have you ever watched Fat Doctor out of the UK? Dr. Shaw Somers is a beautiful soul who deals with his morbidly obese patients in such a kind and compassionate manner. Just thought you might be interested. It would be interesting to do a side by side comparison of the two shows. Love all your videos, thanks!
I immediately hit like upon hearing "cat".
I have an Bernese Mountain Dog, and he's such a gentle giant, so sweet even my sassy cats grown to love him, even the horses like his company!
How do u teach bear not to pee/ 💩 in the house?
Still waiting for Mike to get an bear and name it dog
Proof for my mother that I'm not a failure if I have bad eyesight and wear glasses:
You don't look like him, but you're gentle like him
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! I love cats ❤❤❤❤ best regards from Hamburg (Germany)
Only in US 😡The rest of the World can teach their dogs without crate training. Crates are for travel and short term stay, not a whole day while your at work. I’d think a doctor would understand that.
@DoctorMike can we have an episode or even a podcast talking about Semaglutide  being used in weight loss ? I'm sure it presents interest and there seems to be a crazy debate around it and the whole it works vs losing mostly muscle and tissue weight. How about semaglutide  and weight predisposed diseases like hypertension, diabetes etc ?
I would love to see Dr. Mike react to Dr. Hartman.
Bear 🐻❤️❤️❤️
Corgi's are only chill if they get enough mental stimulation.  If they don't, they are all over the place and the couch will be eaten
Is Bear a Noufie?
What are you picking off of Bear and dropping behind your couch? Is your vacuum nearby?
Bear is such a patient human owner.
Get a rescue cat 🐈‍⬛
Do they make brown ones? such an innocent question.
There are definitely brown cats out there 😌 Oriental cats can be brown!
2:12 I actually did this while doing my school
Good rescue would be Villalobos rescue center :) Say what your looking for and they’ll help pick out a dog for you
DR.mike nikocado is angry at you
”Do they make brown cats?” 😂😂
I have a corgi and he has no chill lol
I have a question  is it normal to chew on my cheeks and tongue while sleeping
Any good rescue will take your level of "chill" into consideration.   You should look at adopting a retired greyhound tho. They're pretty lazy, usually not hyper (tho they can have their moments), and just want a nice couch to lay on.
The echo effect while you were yelling about cholesterol cracked me up 😂😂😂😂
Bear is adorable. in a different note, in Titanic, sure the door would have capsized if he got on. But it was a shipwreck, pretty sure there were a lot of other debris that he could have got on floating about. thats what annoyed me, that he gave up after ONE attempt. its life and death, u keep fighting till the last moment to survive
Just letting you know the chiwawa in the target cart is not ok because people bringing their pets into non pet friendly places can seriously harm legitimate Service Dog teams
This… this is so wholesome… I almost can’t take it.
everybody like the video doctor mike needs a cat
What is hair made of ?
Annoying that we can say "don't let your dog get fat", but we can't say "don't let people get fat" anymore.
find a foster rescue they will have good info
Its funny seeing Bear lick Dr Mikes face and hes like "I'm just going to take this".
The best tip is to FOSTER First before officially adopting so that you can learn about the dog and see if it fits your lifestyle and other doggo ^.^ voila my tip
mlem
Ooh you sweet summer child. Corgis are not chill. They are not small dogs; they are short dogs. Source: owned by 2
I'm just curious,do you feed hill's (the dog food brand) to bear?

I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention to anything you said. I was paying attention to the puppy.  I have Great Pyrenees. Best.Dog.Ever. Scared of a plastic bag and when the dishwasher is open,  but will protect me...from... the silent strange noise from the outside??? Mister Barks At Air, (Milo),  is so sweet and doesn't know he's a large dog. He's part cat.
Can u plsss react to people getting injured in gymnasticsss plssssss thank u ❤❤
The Don’t Stop Retrieving is from Journey - Don’t Stop Believing.
Doctor Mike and Bear are soulmates. No denying it. Both are equally handsome in their own unique way. Be sure to look for the Bear Necessities on their grooming habits. ;)
Most of the rescues around my area have been fostered before being put up for adoption so the personality traits are listed on the dog's profile. Whether they can be around cats, other dogs, children, potty trained, need a lot of exercise, low key personality, etc. It really helped my husband and I find our big guy a new friend after our 14 year old weenie dog passed away. Maybe check that out if you're wanting to find Bear a doggo friend 🙂
so i got a rescue recently. it was during covid so meet and greets wherent realy avalible. So i used pet finder it allows you to filter the results by miles away age, size, gender even if there fixed or not. i would scroll endlessly until i got a connection with a picture and read more about there story and then apply if i liked it im sure now meet and greets are avalible so you can always call a local shelter and see
A kitty would love to sleep in all that floof, just sayin
I heard meats 0:00
In the words of the great Jim Gaffigan…”A muffin is a bald cupcake.” Drops mic.
There is such thing as a brown cat and there fricking adorable
10:00   Animals thoughts are sensory based. Bear knows which floor is "home" and which is "outside" based on what it looks, smells, and sounds like.
I think if your dog is “Boofing” you need to take it to the vet, and I need to call the ASPCA/Cops.
you and bear look the same
Do not get a corgi if you want a chill dog
Mike :- Memes! MEMES! MEMEMES!!! Dog :- Licks mike Mike :- Hahaha Dog :- haha you feel into my trap

Mike, could you react to duck memes?
Lemiduefuu.(let me do it for you.)
black cattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
Get👏🏽him👏🏽the👏🏽cat👏🏽. A cuddly loving one not a mean one. ❤ He will be happy and the cat will too.
3:03 but mike I did that and my mom said he looked sad so took him out while she stopped by my house so I was double stressing the whole Brewer game and then came home to a Brewer win but a eaten recliner.
Corgis are great, but they are the opposite of chill unless they are old. They are a herding breed and super smart. They need constant engagement and stimulation. So not a great couch-potato breed, but a great breed if you want a dog who wants to work and please!
I work out everyday. I buy my work out supplements from Walmart. They have testosterone boosters there. I was hoping to get your opinion on them.
What is wrong with dogs... I feel like My dog doesn't know the difference between a dog and cat 🐈 and or between male and females or is it only my dog 😅
I got 2 Dachshunds and I adore them.
Get bear a cat! PLEASSSSEEEE!
Shiba is center of bark pyramid. Worship Shiba.
thinking of your "next dog" wtf what kind of person are you. always assume you and your dog both die at the same time so neither has to live without the other.
If you want a super chill rescue dog greyhounds are amazing
I have a question, what do you think about Iridology?
whats ur dog?
let me me do it for you🐕‍🦺
I want to go to therapy but my mom won't let me and the reason I want to go to therapy is personal and i can't tell her and i don't know what to do.
Yes there are brown cats but they are very rare
I love that shirt  Bear face is adorable .

Yo million viewers, let's get that 300k likes for dr. Mike to have a brown cat!!!!
Hi Bear!
what is difference between acne and pimple?
Hahahahahahaahhaahhaahhahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahha
I have a dog groomer “reacts to Doctor Mike grooming Bear” video. It was so fun to make! I love Doctor Mike and Bear.❤
Dr Mike: it’s a hidden treasure trove of saturated fat and calories, and carbs   My skinny self: runs out to buy half a dozen of them
Honestly my doggo never ate the couch, shoes, anything. And we don't use a crate. He is free to sleep everywhere, he is just not stressed out and gets to run outside 4-5 times a day. No problem.
I definitely do not look like our carne corsos
Bear is beyond addorable..
hey Doctor mike I have a problem with something where I can talk with you in private about it if you have discord can we please talk its really important for me and you might help me a lot
Dude, are you throwing hair over the back?
7:22
I was today years old when I found out that Dr. Mike is only two years older than me…
I like just watched the meet my bear and commented!🙃
My surname is Borker😊 I'm honored.
Ive seen the myth busters, it was possible, and what was up with all the breathing sounds coming from him when people were out yelling to rescue them? Eh? Why Mr. Cameron do you toy with my emotions!
What my dog is called: Jasper What my family calls my dog: fourlegs, lil poops, wigglebutt, woofer, gooch, big silly, pickles, batman, strange creature
A chocolate newfie will be the next dog I get..had one as a kid..couldnt ask for a better dog
You should find yourself a rescur greyhound. They're the chillest dogs you can own and they need all the love. If you can get your hand ln a SPANISH greyhound, even better.
Yoooo Bear!  how are you?
Good thing I don't like muffins!-
I’m sick but this really made my day❤
These videos are so wholesome 💕 and Bear is so adorable! I previously worked 6 years in the veterinary field and have worked alongside many rescue organizations here in BC, Canada. Each rescue has different criteria/adoption processes, however, most require you to fill out an application form. In the form you’ll describe yourself and or any other people living with you (and their ages, if there’s children) usually what your occupation is, living conditions (ie: apartment, house, acreage, fenced yard etc), what pets are also living in the home (if you do have pets; how they are with other animals etc), and what you’re looking for with adoption (preference in breeds, age, sex and personality types). Once you submit the form, the organization will reach out to you to conduct an interview to confirm the information is correct and that you are a responsible individual to provide care for the animal etc. They will also work to help find compatible matches and eventually lead to the adoption process, which includes a meet and greet and usually a home trial. Hope this info helps ❤
Welcome back to another episode of Doctor Mike with Dogtor Bear. 🩺
My heeler won’t fetch at all. If you throw it further than a few steps he won’t even chase it. He’ll just run the other direction.
I like to make up Latin funnies too!  "Wienermegaly!" 🤣  Doubt anyone ever complained about that to their doc lol 🤪
What da dog doin
We use the inflatable donut cone like you after my grandparents dog had a dental exam and teeth removed. She broke her plastic cone from the vet within an hour, and while she wasn't happy to wear that donut for 2 weeks, it allowed her mouth to heal pretty decently.
For the algorithm!
Hey Mike can you do a video on a roblox game called maple hospital and diagnose people with conditions but say the complex way of saying the diagnosis and literally drive the kids that play the game insane ?
You should react to the scar girl!
Bear needs a cat
I watched this with my dog Walter! Walter/Bubs/Bubby/Goober/Mr. Walter Puppy is a rescue that was brought to my area from a high kill shelter in the south. If you're interested in rescuing, I would suggest looking into older dogs who already have their personality developed so you know their temperament and how they feel about other dogs, especially big ones like Bear. The rescue we used also typically lets prospective dog parents meet the dog and you could probably bring Bear to make sure they get along (we did a zoom call because he's a Covid dog and we didn't have any other pets). If anyone in the DC area is interested, I highly recommend Lucky Dog! We had a great experience working with them. I love my dog so much and I'm so glad we rescued him!
Wait what breed is bear?
I think everyone should totally adopt from shelter! They need us. Our adopted husky is wonderful, he picks up our personalities.
That dog wasn't pure bread, it was IN bread ... as all "pure bred" dogs actually are.
When I am watching your video's since 4 a.m. 😵‍💫
"Its not breaking HIPAA if you tell your dog." made me CACKLE.
I needed to see this video after the reddit vid I just watched!!!!  My heart feels better!
totally unrelated comment but Can you maybe do a show near eagle river, no one really does any tours there ._.
ur animal 's love is so amazing, 🙏👍  i m so fear your pet
I have a dog, who is a Shih Tzu, and he is just a dog that will bite the hell out of anyone. He is SO AGGRESSIVE that he can definitely earn the title of the most aggressive dog. Honestly, sometimes I think of getting a cat for myself, and letting my brother deal with Oreo. I do like him, but when I come to home, he most definitely tries to bite me.  Anyways, I wish that I had a dog that had a personality like Bear, cuddly, lazy and chill. Hugs and kisses to Bear and Roxie 🥰🥰
I love your T-shirt
So when is the cat coming?
I press like button on this vid just to see Mikey buy the Bear a cat
its not a whippet its a KERMY
So I finally saw this and the reason I believe Bear knows what floor he knows is his... Is smell... Rather Obvi, yes? 😏
I rescued a dog while in China and she is perfect for me. My tip is to not have a specific dog in mind. I did not care what breed or age. (They recommend a small dog though since I would be traveling eventually home) So I stood in the middle of the small dog pen and one dogs kept coming back and I got to watch her interact with the others. After about 30-40mins of watching this little dog always kept coming back and staying with me. They others all got tired of me by then. So I knew we were meant to be. It has been the best 2 years so far of my life with her by my side.
Man that Chihuahua picture really tried to activate my trypophobia
Kill the Dog Eat the Dog Coz I am not Vegan
Let me do it for you
hey Dr.Mike I think you should react to self harm struggles and how they affect the person
"Did Bear just throw up?"
Please we have to help Bear get a pet cat!!!!
Hey dr mike which A.E.D company do you like the most
Doc Mike can you react to Manifest? a lot of people says that you look like Ben Stone. Please please 🙏🥺
Can you PLEASE react to the rings of power??? I was just watching the 5th episode and throughout  the entire thing I was thinking 'Man if dr mike was watching this he'd be soooo mad!!!'😂
So when will we see the brown cat?
Yes to getting a cat~ I adopted my cat last June, best decision of my life!
Yes! Get a cat! They have just as much, if not more personality than a dog and they easier to take care  of. You won't regret it.
I’m a trauma nurse and I always tell my dog about my patients... I will often bring him in on my days off to see patients who have tried to commit suicide and have ended up with severe injuries. It usually makes such a difference to their recovery and  I see them more motivated to get moving to throw the ball etc. Often we try to motivate them for their recovery but they won’t do it for themselves however they will do it for the doggos 😂
I have on occasion taken my cat for a walk on a leash in our courtyard, and one time I tried taking him downstairs so he could sniff around the gardens.  He always wants to go home as soon as another human or -le gasp- a dog is in the courtyard, so when we were downstairs and someone made noise elsewhere in the courtyard, he started pulling me toward where our door would be if we were on the correct floor.  I had to pick him up and carry him back upstairs because he didn't seem to get that we were not on our floor.  I never took him to another floor again. ;)
I want to thank you for routinely including Bear and showing an example of a dog who is a healthy purebred dog. Adoption is amazing, but the pendulum has swung so far that now people think purebred dogs are all unhealthy (not true), there is never a good reason to choose a purebred dog (not true), and those of us who are hobby breeders who just want to show our dogs and improve are breeds are horrible people who are simply contributing to overpopulation (also not true). There is so much misinformation out there, so THANK YOU.
It's called a chocolate birman-cross cat they look like Bear in cat form
One of 300k! 😊
Hey Docter Mike, I have a question:I have this dry feeling oval on my arm. No matter how many times I clean it in the shower or put lotion on it or even do nothing, it won't disappear. Is this a bad thing, or do I need to do something about it?
Myth busters had cameron on an episode dedicated to titanic, they found that it was possible for jack to have climbed up on the wood, or to use their life vests to help the wood float better, but i think they were overlooking the emotional problems. Their ship which was advertised as 'not even god could sink', just sank. so yeah, the panic of trying to get on the wood together the first time and failing would not have me been thinking after the water steadied there would be a better chance for a try 2........i don't even like the movie and yet i am too much of a nerd to not think like that. sorry, rant over
Let's get this vid to 300k likes for the cat 🐈
Aw, I think it’s great that Bear is there for you when you are feeling anxious.  When you mention it, I just wanted to give you a big hug. I think you should adopt another dog.
Please explain ASMR
i was singing didn't i do it for you before the editor put it on
Only 117k come on people
Bear lookin like a raptor with that hair lol
Get the cat!!!
Dr. Mike I’d suggest you look at SAVE Animal Shelter in Skillman, NJ. They have been great to work with when I adopted my cat, and I’m sure it’s the same with their dogs. The volunteers care so much and the shelter staff were so helpful when I had any questions after I adopted her. They let you walk their dogs to get to know them. It’s a big facility so they have a lot of animals!   I’d recommend visiting a few times to see them all and see any new dogs/cats that come in. I ended up going 3 times before I took my lovebug home.   Honestly they’d be great to partner with for a video about adopting!
Get a rescue pitbull. They'll do and be whatever you want them to. Their sole purpose is to please their human. They have such a bad rap but they are awesome, loving dogs.
Dr. Mike everytime he sees another brown dog: "BEARR!"
Bear only weighs 130 lbs?? My dog, an Anatolian Pyrenees, looks so much smaller than Bear and he weighs 115 lbs
i have a actual docter question, when i work out my heart gets to 170bpm, is this ok?
You should react to the Bill Burr comedy sketch about him and his first dog

Um doctor Mike, i  get bright purple boils in the *peewoop* after my period, what is going on with that??  It hurts my down there where my undies sit. It’s weird. What is really going on with my *peewoop*??
I’m glad I watched this on my dogs birthday
Get your cat sir
When you get a cat you’ll have to do this with your cat!

If you get a cat - - I will love you forever 😻
Sharing this to help get kitty, just name it after a big cat species

I had a wiener dog. That’s all I know. I was young. 😢
I have a dog! He is a black lab pitbull  mix, and he is so sweet. And big.
Mike, when you go to a shelter to get a rescue dog, you’ll just know. You’ll meet a lot of fine dogs, they’ll all be adorable, but then… you’ll meet the one, and you’ll just know. There’s magic in it. You meet the one dog that you know needs you, that you need too. I don’t think you get that experience with a breeder, at least it’s not quite the same.   There are rescues devoted to individual breeds as well. So if you narrow it down to a few breeds you like, you may find a rescue that specializes in them.
I. LOVE. BEAR.
bear is so cute
Bear is adorable can't believe people say only small dogs are cute
@Doctor mike I got a surgeon game on my oculus and when the heart would decline you would have to use a defibrillator but I yelled NO JUST CHEST Compressions  the defibrillator will not work nor help
EARLY!!
Please get a cat😂
Looks like you're getting a feline bear 🐻
If you want a rescue dog in the future, go to a place where you can visit often. I wouldn't settle for a dog until I have visited him at least 5~10 times. When the dogs feels more comfortable about you, you can see his true colors. Or see how he behaves with the people he feels comfortable and familiar with. As much as we want to help the dog that is on the far back of the room, it is a high risk you end up with a very hard case that will desrupt your lifestyle. Don't be guilt-tripped into getting a dog until you feel it is the right one for u.  Not a problem unless you are REALLY into making a lot of compromises for the new dog.
This was so cute I love bear in videos - I wish you could do a day in the life with bear like you did with Roxy - ps love how crazy mikes hair is in this lol haha
What book are you reading? It sounds interesting.
I love how you used the term Newfie!
Bear is just so adorable. I have a terrier mix named Peanut who'd probably love Bear as he thinks he's a big dog lol
How said your dog can be soooo cute😍😍
The cringe when you called the borzoi a whippet 🤣
Let 😔 me😌 do🥺 it😀 for👹 you🗿
Please react to Macka B's "cucumber" song in one of these !!!!!! 🙏🙏 🙏
BTW Brown cats - Burmese browns are AMAZING animals and incredibly intelligent to boot.
There are breed specific rescues. For instance I used to adopt from Great Pyrenees rescues of America, for whatever breed you desire, there should be a rescue for it ,especially large breed dogs.  But there are kill shelters that occasionally have really great pets, sometimes purebred ones that haven’t gotten pulled for a breed rescue. I adopted my last purebred rag doll cat from animal control, a breeder dumped him there, it’s a common thing , sometimes you get lucky. My daughter adopted a dog from animal control and she is like the best dog we’ve ever had she is half chow and lab looks like a mini black Newfie. Another thing to consider is if the homeless rate is high in an area with a housing crisis, chances are that the kill shelters are full and will terminate an animal quicker just to make space even if it’s an adoptable puppy or kitten , it’s really sad but the truth they won’t ever tell you.
There are actually breeds of brown house cats. The Havana Brown and Burmese can both have brown coats. The gene that causes this coloration is recessive. So, they are rare.
Get a rag doll cat they are the best cats ever
I loved the video and bear looks so cute, also, when are you gonna do a Q&A again? it's been a while since you've done one
I know how you guys look like you both have great hair😂🎉
BEARRRRRRRRRRRR
BEARRRRRRRRRRRR
kinda disappointed that Mike didn't know the little russian lady dog (borzoi) he's old enough to remember the vine trends 🤭🤭
I know this is a dumb name but we call our dog that is also named bear, bearzo
I got my rescues from fail fostering 😂😂
To the dogs I think they know it's a magical box that takes them to an outside world lol
Everyone always says Rose and Jack could have shared the door, I just don't get why he couldn't find his own piece of wreckage to float on.
My dog's name: Jackson.  What I call my dog:   Jackson  Jack Jax Jackie  Jaxie  Jackie Jou-Jou Jacko Butt Brain Fart-face Booger breath  No-no bad dog
Dr. Mike, please do a video of your daily routine with Bear. I just want to see Bear all the time! 😍
I can’t escape the borzois. HELP ME.                                                                                             Let me do it for you 🥹🥺🗿💀🫠
Please don't get a cat just because. Thanks from this cat lover 😁
Where's the 'Get Bear a cat that looks like him' petition? I'll sign asap...
Wait does that dog have 2 youngest?
Liking so he gets a cat that looks like bear😂
Good Luck dealing with your anxiety Dr Mike 🙂
Try foster to adopt! You basically get to have the dog as your own but without actually adopting. If the dog fits your lifestyle, adopt! If not, you don’t have to keep it.
If people dont start liking this post so bear can get a cat I'ma be really upset
9:00 Because part of digistive system of a newf dogo is flor underneath their jaw... full of saliva ;D
IM NOT LIKEINGB
Obviously, we're all here for Bear, but every time I see the Titanic door size discussion, I can't help but wonder if the people arguing didn't see the movie? They both try to get on. Rose does but when Jack tries to join her, it flips and is pushed under the surface. She perches on the very edge to keep it floating without her resting in the water. The size wasn't the problem, the shape and bouyancy was.
When I adopted my dog they gave me a “trial” period since my first dog was an only dog for almost 2 years. They told me I could bring him back if we had any issues but that wasn’t the case whatsoever. They are both very happy 😊
100 thousand likes. 200 thousand likes left for a cat.
4:18  g**da**, now i can't unsee it
Bear needs his lower right puppy canine removed
Actually brown cats do exist but are very rare and cost a lot of money.  I would know cause I wanted one lol
best dr mike video
Definitely get a rescue cat! Been rescuing animals for years and it's the best 🐾❤️🤗🙏
As for choosing a pet with the right personality, I started fostering for an animal rescue and chose my third to keep forever. I’ve had fifteen foster cats come through my home in the last 15 months and 14 have found their forever homes so far.
Leaving dog in the crate without supervision is illegal in Finland
I got my sweet baby girl 4 years ago from my local Humane Society. She is a pure bred Havanese. They are great companion dogs and great for apartment living. They are hypoallergenic, and they don't shed. Downside: they have thick wool like hair that needs to be constantly maintained.
I have a blue heeler, he is trained and all and am in an urge to find him a home, he is actually a rescue lol... I desperately need a new place for him and I do believe he might fit you, because you are very, very active and you love going out and hiking and he loves that too, but when at home, he is chill and such a good boi. HELP!! If you cannot keep him, please help me to advertise him in one of your vids lol. I really need to find him a home, already neutered!

Bear, We need more Bear on the videos
Bear is awesome!
Doggo memememememememss
GUYS PLEEEEEAAASSSEEE GET IT TO 300K
We love bear here ! ❤️❤️❤️
Hey Mike, can you to react to MrBeast curing 1,000 people’s blindness, he made the video a couple days ago
Corgi's are not chill lol mine runs around the table at 1am for no reason
Btw some brown cat breeds are: Havana Brown Burmese York Chocolate Devon Rex Persian Oriental Shorthair Cat British Shorthair
We need to get mike a cat!
One part of "looking like your dog" might be a similar process as what happens with married couples. The two beings constantly interacting begin to mimic one another's expressions and posture.
IN THE INTRO BEARS LIKE DAD SHUT UP
Or... give them enough mental stimulation and daily exercise so they won't be as destructive so you don't need the crate...
how long have youve been studyen to be a docter
GET EO 300 LIKESSS! I NEED TO SEE IF HE WILL GET A CAT!!
This is the sweetest thing! My favorite 2 parts:  the considerate pillow barrier VS the cone for comfort level. And the mention of getting a  cat. Just do it. You know you want to. They will keep each other company. Or battle for your attention. Either way, you cant go wrong. Warm lap and warm feet!
Love this. I love my Newf Nala ❤
Muffin is a bald cupcake and we all know it 🤣
Person who works for an animal shelter here!: We take a detailed history of what you do to help you find a good dog for you. Are you active? How often are you home? What's your work/home balance like? What kind of dog are you looking for? Big or small? Are you able to provide this dog who has x, y, z needs? Those sorts of things! Let me know if you want anymore details.
It would be cool to introduce Bear to @GirlWithTheDogs
My cat was recently neutered. She needed a cone but hated it.  So my mum cut out a sock and and put it on her. Very cute and much better for her.
I am a Dude and a Think you are fine with your dog and everything but GIRLSSSS His 33 please slide on his DM's this man can't be this handsome and alone!! GIRLSSSS PLS
DON'T DO THE CORGI.  Not a chill dog.  They are cattle herders and ours has a lot of energy.
Lol. I whisper about the ridiculous patients with my wiener dog after work and I feel so much better. Sure hope that doesn’t break HIPAA 😮
Ha! At age 17 I have 2 dogs. Anxiety. And a dog with anxiety. Get wrecked. I win. She has separation anxiety so she follows me every where 😂😂 she’s really chill but the other doggie is a puppy so she’s full of energy!!! Dogs are the best
could you please react to the Australian show Doctor Doctor (also known as The heart guy), it's a great show and I'd love to know what you'll think about it
Corgis are not that chill lol, they want to bark at and herd everything . Like border collie lite
MORE LIKES MORE LIKES NEEDED
My family adopted a dog After our old dog died (he was 13). We adopted a black shepherd mix puppy from a shelter.  And I can say that was the best decision that we made in  2021. Our dog is so smart, kind, lovelly and always so happy when we call him. And he is very cute. And because of his cuteness, he was in the newspapers last month.
NEVER GRATE a dog. Never did it and never had issues. Dr Mike why and think of you want to by in a box for long hours. Poor bear
We must get Mike a cat!
Please don't get a cat on a whim, Mike. They are just as complicated and dependent as dogs, but in different (and usually much more complex) ways. Cats have a reputation of being loners that you can just feed and basically ignore, but nothing could be further from the truth. If you don't have the same time, emotional, and financial resources to dedicate to a cat as you do to Bear, please don't adopt one, brown or otherwise.
I went through Coco's Heart, to get our family dog.
Nothing like Dog Memes from a Licensed Doctor!!!
I has a yipper
English "Werner" is called a notorious Saugsage dog
If I ran into Bear and Dr. Mike, I'd say, "Hi, doc", and go to town giving Bear all the long-nailed scritches.  Humans are overrated.  Give me all the snuggly little floofy babies.
Better get ready for a (rescue) cat, Doctor.
bear is so cuteee he warms my heart
🤓😂
This makes me happy,I got news today, my dog will be put down tomorrow 😔
Not a Whippet, that's a Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound, directly related to the Greyhound, which is in the same family as the Whippet)
Don’t run muffins for me 😂
at least he doesnt try to EAT the vomit after hurling
The dogs in the snow, looks a bit like borzois The Siberian Husky could be an Alaskan Malamute.  But remember: Marco Polo was a Dalmatian.
Can you react to drew goodens attempt to get taller?Also very good doggo
Jeez bear weighs as much as me 😂
That´s a good looking dog (bear).
Every time a car with young people passes you, it sounds like a dog about to barf.(Listen to the bass). :)
The nicknames for my dogs aren't too out of the ordinary. Oscar: Ocka, Ocker, Ocka Lukey, or Bubba Jaydee Mae: Fluff or Fluffy Brutus: Brutie, Brutie Butt, B-Butt, or Bubba.
Hello Dr. Mike - why have i been getting only 5 and 4 hours? And sometimes I can't even sleep
Id say yes cause ur russian
9:24 Suddenly, I feel so much more successful at 32. 😂 I’m pretty sure my FLOOF and your FLOOF would be besties.
You know what: Cat advice 1: Brown cats do exist but it's one of the rarer colours, I don't know if finding a longhair brown cat is realistic. Alternatively, longhair black cats frequently appear brown in the sun. This is probably the best path if you want ‘Cat that looks like Bear’, though if you just want them to look ‘related’ then colourpoint cats with brown faces are more common than complete brown.  2: As for the cat itself, one thing it will absolutely need is territory. Territory it does not have to challenge Bear for. (Cats are very territory oriented. In multi-cat households they sort it out with a bit of posturing but I've never met the cat that will posture at something Bear's size). This will probably be a tower/shelf where the route up is too narrow for a dog to climb, or multiple scattered around the house. If it wants to be alone, up it goes.  As a cat person, I've never had to introduce a cat to a dog household so there's probably other stuff as well.
The fact that he thinks corgis are chill dogs 😂😂😂 they are literally a herding breed.
Churchill had a bulldog
Bear is so big do you have a saddle for him?   If you get a Cat know he becomes the boss but they are low maintenance unlike Dogs, teach your Cat to ride Bear like a Horse
"You should crate train your dog" Nah, I think I'll skip that. As a person coming from a country eons ahead of yours when it comes to animal protection laws, I prefer not to torture my dogs. It's even illegal here and I would lose my right to have pets.
You might try fostering dogs/puppies next time you are looking for a new dog friend. You don't have to do it forever, but it's a very sure way to find one that suits you and your lifestyle. Basically you take care of the animal until it can be adopted out. Most animal foster parents end up finding their furrever friend that way. :) Just contact your local shelters to find out who has a fostering program. If the one you called doesn't have one, chances are they know one who does. :)
1:16 Always good to have snacks.
YES A TWIN BUT A CAT
DR MIKE WHAT BREED IS BEAR
When I got my first rescue dog it took about a year to find one that was like me, but when I did, it was totally worth it!
FYI Newfie is a Derogatory term for Newfoundlanders in Canada.
My dog will lick up his own puke, which is probably even worse than what Bear does!
i love bear he is so cute! 😍
Oi cmon people, hit like 300k like dr mike said 😤🤌
my dog had surgery some years ago for what we thought was just a skin tag (turns out there were cysts underneath and he ended up with a bigger incision).  For the life of us we couldn't keep a cone on him.  While he doesn't tend to barge things, he DID figure out if he walked into something quick enough he could pop the cone off. lt didn't stay on 10 minutes so we gave up.
It is always possible to get a room with a cat or a dog at pet co.
My dogs nicknames : D!ck(I don't call him that only my elders) Good Boiii,  Fwuffy, Buddy, Bread
Dr Mike. A bit of a back story with the dog with the shadows resembling a tiger. A couple weeks ago there was a tiger on the loose in Johannesburg South Africa, that meme did the rounds during the time they were searching for the tiger.
I wanna wiener dog 🐕 they are Protective
You and bear look a like, you both have insane bushy hair
8:44 Same with cats throwing up. I can snooze 20 alarms but one cat heaving and I'm up in 0.1 sec
One of my girls is almost as big as your Bear, she's 120lbs or so ( trying to convert in my head) and there is nothing better than a big dog squeezy cuddle. I'm not a fan of the kisses though, I live in the mountains and my dogs regularly find carrion etc on their walks.. The other day a rotting horses foot complete with maggots, charming 🤮🤮 Also I have never used a crate just plenty of chew toys etc, the balls that you can hide treats in are excellent for diverting your dog while you are out. Also if I come back and everything is in order I reward them.
Where did you get the dog backpack for hiking? All the ones I’ve seen have been too small for my Alaskan Malamute
you should react to the last of us
2:32 I called that dog the Russian Lady from the vine
Most shelters will help you find the dog that’s best fit for you
I had a really good experience with Petfinder for my rescue dog last year. It was really intense in terms of some of the applications I put in but it was worth it in the end.
2:30 it’s not a whippet it a borzoi
It's not breaking HIPAA when you tell Bear about your patients because he is in the Circle of Care
Not my muffins !! They my guilty pleasure ❤
I swear dr. Mike is so good for heart ❤️. Laugh is cure for sure. Laugh so hard for the part where dr. Mike is upset with his personality test results, Bear throws up and then test results are not that bad. Lesson is: relax, it can always get worse 🙂
My dog is a rescue from the Humane Society. We got lots of time with her before we took her home. She has PTSD from her previous owners though, so be aware the dog might take some extra work. She’s 100% worth it, but if you have a demanding schedule and not a lot of time, a rescue might not be for you.
I have never seen so much likes on any video...people trying to get you a cat sir ! 😂
Dr Mike Bears are the “Russian animal” so… yes you are like Bear
"Do they make cats like that?" Classic Doctor Mike content
Should teach bear to do a "beewhoop" lol
About the rescue: a good one is to take your current dog with you. Make sure they get along. It also tells a lot about their personality. A lot of times, rescue centers also tell you all things (good or bad) they know about the dog. No dog is bad. Everyone can be saved ❤️
5:40 leave me alone i do what i want
Plssss make more videos with bear he is soooooooooo cute
Thank you for ruining muffins for me. I love blueberry muffins.  Though I have one or two a month. So I will survive.😁
omg i wish my dog was as good as bear
Dude has the same hair cut as his dog
You need to make more of these
Take your like, Bear, we gonna get ya that cat, buddy!
De mike: Concerned of bear breaking a chair at 130 lb-  Me: being 143 lbs watching this- 😧
Get a cat
It’s a borzoi
I call my dog Koda: pumpkin bread, sweetie, sweet pea, baby and good girl
4:13 "A brown cat. Do they make brown cats-?" XD
My dog does not eat the couch. It’s my counters and anything that’s wooden. I guess she likes the taste of wood. also by the way. in the timestamp 5.40 the background music i’ve heard that music multiple times where do you get that music? One more thing my dog’s nicknames are cutie patootie baby and that’s pretty much it and her actual name is sunflower😊
200k more likes to get that cat
Does coca-cola make you bald? Pleas answer me
Not sure this is the place to request or put out video ideas. But with some states and localities (including New York) either legalizing, decriminalizing, or considering one of the two psychedelics and/or psilocybin, can we please talk about these substances from mental health and medical standpoint. Maybe possibility to do a collab with a mental health professional.
how could you not know about Russian noodle horse/ BORZOI ?! 😂
Crate train them. It's takes less work after there crate trained for you to put them in there crate. I just have to say "crate" and my dog will go to its crate as happy as can be
Mike saying that corgis are a chill dog  *Laughs aggressively in dog groomer*   You sweet summer child you could not be more wrong
I have a 15=101 old dog
I would teach my dog what an elevator does by taking him up one floor at a time and then to go look out of the same side window
Brown cat breeds that look like bear: British Shorthair, Persian, and York Chocolate.. (They all have long hair and are brown 😁)
GUYSSSSSS!!!! LOOK! 1:01
This man is so attractive and only like 10% of that is physical.
My dog's name is also Bear - but he is at least half the size of you Newfie <3  Absolutely love your dog  Some nicknames for mine > Bean, Beansprout, Bear Bear
Corgis are not chill dogs fyi.
Also yes pls get a cat Dr. mikeee!
Myth busters actually tested it and there was room for Jack on the door. They both could’ve lived
Oh mah goodness.... STEVEN YOU WATCH DR. MIKE! So cool.
Me and my dog just reacted to doctor Mike and his dog reacting to dog memes.   Also because Mike said he wants to get a rescue dog but doesn't know how to find one that matches him: honestly just go for it and meet a bunch of different dogs before you commit to one. My dog is a rescue. I got him off a website where they rescue them from the streets in Hungary and then bring them back to Austria where I live. On this website you could scroll through all the profiles of the dog with their information and character description to give you a first idea of which ones would be fitting to you. When I saw one that I really liked I called the number on the site and was able to meet him because he was staying with a family and a bunch of the other rescues in my city. At the meeting the dog seemed uninterested in me. Instead another one of the rescues sat right down on my lap like he already trusted me. When they told me that he is the shyest of them all because he only stays to himself, doesn't play with the other dogs and is afraid to be touched I knew he was the one. And when I watched his behaviour when he was among the others he did seem to be unhappy with where he was. I took him home and we've been inseperable ever since. We have a really strong mental connection. I always know what he's thinking and we help each other through our anxiety and trauma. So my biggest advice to anyone who's thinking about getting a pet has always been: let the animal choose you. Because they have a much higher sensitivity for these things. I had the luck to grow up always surrounded by many different animals. My family and I always let the animal choose us and it's worked wonders.
What race is bear
Who told you corgis were calm?🤣
mike: MEMES MEMES MEMES
My dog is a boofer
i love your videos i have been watching you for over an year by now!!!
Get a Torti! They won’t look like bear that much but they have the best personality! Especially the female ones. They practically act like dogs do
“Do they make brown cats” lmfaooo
At 10:00 if you don't start walking out the elevator when it stops on that floor then chances are he won't either, most dogs follow their owner because they all have some kinda yearn built into them about following the pack leader.
Lets like everyone, just to see the cat. Please get a floffy cat to accompany bear. And cats are best dog friends since they are great at disciplining dogs and dog owners 😂😍
2:42 noooooo that audio gives me vietnam war flashbacks…….
I have to disagree with you about loving your pets too much. Puppy kisses are the best and I will will keep all the sweet, sweet kisses for my own face, then.
Link to the golden retriever attack vid not at end of video, at least for me. Good vid otherwise.
T
As a corgi owner, they are absolutely NOT chill 🤣 She has the MOST energy and enthusiasm
Not Bear being heavier than me ... I'm 24🙃
Who else watched the video just for the dog
400K NOWWWWW
lets get him a cat
Hey dr. Mike I know it's not connected to this video but I heard from my sister a story about my nephew and I wanted to know the answer... why can some babies be quited only when the parent stands with him?
Adopt a pot is a rescue company run by my moms friend. Look there
We want cat
what does it mean when i can crack my knee on control
He does look like bear
Oh you and Bear look alike alrite. Look at those hair!!
I don't think we actually know what dogs 'remember' but a dog will definitely react to being treated badly, especially if it's a longer period of time.
❤❤❤❤❤
Well the whole fact that Jack and Rose lived in a different time, back then it was women and children first, he was just being a "man" doing the right thing. Jack tried to get on the piece of wood, or whatever it was, and could see it was sinking, it was either her or him.
I recently adopted a dog from my local humane society. They required a form to be filled out prior to adoption which gives them a profile of our lifestyle and how a dog would fit into it best. They asked questions such as what type of activity level is important to us, how long would our dog need to be left alone on an average day, are we comfortable with a dog who has existing medical needs, etc. We honestly got the best dog too. She's an older dog, 4 years, but she has the most lovely calm personality and has already had some training before we adopted her so she knows a lot of commands. We put in applications on a number of different dogs before getting her. But I'm so glad we didn't match with any of the previous dogs, because my girl is just the best. I've had her a month now and I completely adore her.
LETT  MEE DO IT   FORR YOUUUU
I have a weird lazy dog but I wonder if it’s normal for him to lick the couch and fall off it when he’s on the edge?
There are brown cats (the specific color is chocolate)...they're just rare.
You are a dogctor
Let me do it for you
Did Dr. Mike say Cardiomywieneropathy??😳😩😊😉😄 ....I'll let myself out🚶‍♀️🚪
Im from Newfoundland and I know about newfoundland dogs is that a newfoundland dog? looks like on and the newfie in the title, exicted for your reply cause i watched u a long time and i didnt relized it was a newfoundland dog!

Mike : if this video hets 300 thousand likes, i will consider getting a cat for bear Literally i day later : 900k + likes
Do you look like Bear? Well, you're both incredibly handsome, so I'd say so
You don't look like bear but you're just as cuddly 😍🥰
I had to like. Bear needs a cat friend. Please adopt a cat friend for him! I'd love to see cat content in your videos as well as more bear 🙂 🐻
BEAR BARK REVEAL!?
While your at why don t you cover the Project Veritas video showing Pfizer talking about mutating Covid so they can keep making money off of selling you more shots

Dogs feel and interpret movement WAY better than we do, they know elevators are going down and up ya goofball.   Also, you're good looking but Bear is perfection and I want to cuddle him!!!
WHAT BREED IS BEARR
A Dog Named Bear... Seriously Man😒
Adopt a greyhound. They're pretty chill, don't need a lot of exercise (short walks), and low maintenance for hair routine to balance with Bear.
More bear.. i love bear…
9:20 he may have a microchip 🧐
I think I’m friend have a brown dog named bear but he have deaf.
My Great Dane Elvis was 152, let me assure you, the chair will not break. My ex was 220 lbs and I am 120-30 lbs and we took turns sitting in the computer chair wif da good boy in da lap. Live a little.
Hi. I have a Romanian Shepard (Corb). His not so furry as Bear, but still. What do you do with so much furr? It's everywhere. My dog Bruno is pretty big, 170 lbs (80 kg). Furr is everyware, all the time. What's the answer/secret?
0:29 if my dad gets a dog its gonna be bald
The chihuahua one is like spot the difference
Yes, more Bear content please!
What should drink hot water or cold water
If you want to get a dog from a shelter just go in the middle of all of them. The dog will choose you and you will know it immediately. That dog will be the most loyal one you could possibly get
So many Greyhounds need to be rescued!! They make amazing pets as they are so chill and just love to snuggle. My two were very easy to train and are the best doggos I could have ever asked for💗
C A T 🐱
J Cameron is still saying that? Didn't Mythbusters literally test this, prove it was possible, and even go so far as to have him on the show and display the proof to him??
> Corgi > chill dog Bro...
Mike can I hug Bear?
i love bear's hairstlye on his head

we want bear to have a brown cat!
what happens when you crack your knuckles? please answer this when your doing a question answering video
Doubt you'll see this, but it seems to be a more common feature of some rescues where you "try before you buy". Basically take the pup home for a week or two. You will have jitters, but my friend just did this and now has her new best friend. I'd recommend a dog over 2 because they have settled into themselves by then. Researching breed/s is a decent indication of personality traits. I have a 7 month old Golden Retriever (and 4 other dogs) and this dog is nuts! They settle down a lot by age 2 and I'm counting down the months. They become the best dogs after their crazy puppy period; I just have to keep reminding myself.
Need to get Bear that Brown Cat that looks like him
OMG such a cute doggo !!! Love him
Lets get dr Mike a kitty,
Great way to figure out if a specific rescue dog is right for you is to visit the dog at the shelter for a bit before deciding. It helps you get to know them and they get to know you.
For half a second I read the title as new wife bear
0:50
Dogs are my life, I currently have 6 ❤️🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶

I 100% see the resemblance with you and Bear lol
love your videos. you inspire me to become a doctor when im older
It is breaking hippa if you tell your... hippo
CAT! CAT! CAT! PUSS! 😻
Yes, there are brown cats, but they are really hard to find.
If you do adopt a rescue, you won't really get to know their personality ahead of time. Yes, you get to meet them, but in my experience rescues are a little slower to warm up. Best advice: do breed research ahead of time. Breed traits show up, even in mutts. You can still find the relaxed dog you want, especially if you go for a senior. And since you obviously love one black dog, consider getting one again. Black dogs are the most likely to be put down in a shelter. Usually, you can at least have a chance to introduce a new dog to other pets. I suspect some sort of lab mix would suit you. I adopted a senior lab/beagle mix and it was the best decision I could possibly have made. Zoey was a cuddle-bug and so sweet and happy all the time, but not too energetic. She had some anxiety, especially when left alone, but we worked through it.
as someone who pretty much only adopts dogs id say find a shelter or other form of adoption place that lets you foster for a week or 2 and see how it works out. you'd want to meet the dog first obviously.
If My dad puts his shoes on for any reason, the dog goes nuts and circles him excitedly
It's not a HIPAA violation unless he's wearing a wire
Mike if you want another dog I recommend a german shepherd.
YES PLEASE GET BEAR A PET CAT!! They do make them in brown, I think that's a more rare coloring though
"Honestly, I think owners look like their dogs." *glances at Bear* *glances at Mike* *glances at Bear* Honestly, no.
Adopting at a shelter would be cool. They have pure bred as well.
react to strong woman ( raact if you want)
I foster dogs for a rescue. All of my dogs are rescues. I just lost my 12 1/2 year old bulldog a few weeks ago
I cannot “like” this video because Bear does not want a cat!
Bear looks so soft and cuddly Definitely one of the goodest bois ever
u need to react to doc martin pls
“Do they make brown cats”     Famous quote 2023
Hey dr mike I am just wondering if you could do a vid about SJIA (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthriti) because I have it and my friends are always asking to explain it cause I don’t really know how to it doesn’t even have to be a whole vid you could try to see if there are any Tik Toks about it anyways I’m just wondering because I’m 12 and turning 13 in 2 weeks and it would be a great bday present it’s ok if you can’t
Best meme review of 2023 ....
You can foster a cat/dog to see if you want to keep them for good. You can also research cat breeds and determine which one fits your lifestyle and personality. Ragdolls are very affectionate, tortoiseshells (or torties) are spicy and very protective of their owners, orange tabbys are just weird and pure entertainment, Siamese will wake you up at 6am every morning with a paw to your face (firsthand experience). If you’re looking for pure brown cats to match Bear there are Havana Browns, York Chocolate, and Burmese to name a few. I recommend getting a kitten that has been trained by its mother on using the litter box and grooming itself, that way you can imprint on him/her and they can get familiar with your daily routine. In the beginning, the kitten will meow and constantly follow you around, because it will see you as its daddy and doesn’t want to be alone. An adult cat could also be good, because you have less training to do.
Bear is a really cute dog ❤
DrMike: If this vid gets 3k likes, I will buy a cat that looks like Bear The Likes: ITS OVER 99 THOUSAAAND!!
Pls get a cat
Meme dooooigggggg
This is actually adorable
What medical condition would you diagnose if you have a broken heart due to loosing a pet? On Saturday our family dog named Walter crossed the rainbow bridge due to canine lymphoma at just 4 years old.
You will need to get that cat checked ne day in and we have 100k likes hahahaha
I thought Jack tried to get on with Rose but it kept tilting and that’s why he just hung on, and then froze, and then drown and went down down down. 😢
Cats do come in brown but it looks darker quite often.
I always get rescue dogs and shelters will let you visit with the dogs and will often let you foster as well.
Yes you really look like bear.
My dog Crowe is quick to sound like he's being viciously mauled when another dog spooks him. When I take him to off leash dog parks and another dog gets too close and scares him and he starts screaming like he's being attacked I always go "you're fine you cry baby." It helps put the other owners at ease. No, you're dog isn't being violent. Mine's just being a wimp
Bruh tell me why at the time 2:30 of the video i thought he was gonna say that the dog looked like Zero from the night before Christmas. Ant one else
I always love when bear is in your videos he is so lovable
who is watching this with their cat lol 😂
Adorable
Is it good to work out until your body starts to hurt?
how much for a day with bear?
My dog died today,this helped cheer me up😢
Shelter dogs are sweethearts. It very well depends on who you are though, less than the dog. Sort of like adopting one from a store. It matters about how you are willing to put on the task and give the animal your love and affection. Most shelter animals come from a very mixed environment, streets, bad homes, financial issues, etc. etc. But when you are willing to love the animal, you gotta show it to it. It’s not as much of it will fit your personality, it’s a bit more how can you compromise with your differences? (I know it’s a dog). I’m not professional of any sort, but I hope this helps! Love your videos.  And these are just my opinions as well!!
I love Bear so much I want a dog just like him ❤
Like the video mike needs a cat!!!!!!
Wait Bear is 130 pounds? IM 134 POUNDS- AM I GONNA BREAK MY CHAIR XD
my house: 90% of the floor made of hard wood  My dog: "im about to vomit wheres that one throw rug my hooman keeps around so i can vomit there then eat it and throw it up again."

I have a question,How important is it to get your vaccinations?
If you get a cat, please rescue ❤️
There are actual brown cats the exact color of bear. My neighbor has one, exact color of bear. I've worked with dogs and cats since I was 18 ( I'm 32 now) and I never saw a brown cat until I met my neighbors cat
1:10 MIKE NO
Call me boring but the amount of "let me do-" memes at this point is just stupid. Especially the audio, it's just gets more dumb the more I hear it and the meme thrived so much that it has made me hate dogs with longer than average snoot at this point. I genuinely hate that breed of dog now :/ why am I ranting about this in here? Idk I just woke up
I love how yt says its "from a licensed doctor" when rlly he's a pro meme reviewer in dis guise lmao
That school bus full of dogs is probably the safest school bus I've ever seen at all
Just had a very spicy 🌶️ dream about Doctor Mike, but he had a micro you know what. I wonder what the science is there?
When u make ur both parent veterinarians watch this, and they pause every second to try and comment on dog breed health problems, or the worst client story they had with a certain breed. 🥹🐕🧑‍⚕
While you're meeting rescues, if one of them sits on your foot, it's basically a sealed deal XD
"Look for the girl with the broken smile" my inner maroon 5 stan: ASK HER IF SHE WANTS TO STAY AWHILE AND SHE WILL BE LOOOOVED

YOOO doctor mike, I saw you on a billboard on van nuys
You should get a hairless cat
I WISH I looked like my dog. He's a cute white floof who's always smiling, and I've been told I have RBF.
Come on guys, like it 👍👍 for the bear kitty
Mythbusters proved that Jack could've gotten in that door lol.
I'd love to give bear a snuggle 💖 he looks so sweet
My cat knows when I am stressed and lays on my chest. He's 17 lbs so he's like a weighted blanket that vibrates.  Animals are the best!
WHY AM I NOW REALIZING THAT DR MIKE ONLY POSTS ON WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAYS
Dr. Mike, my cat plays fetch for more than 5 times.  Maybe you should get a cat like that for Bear.

You can foster to adopt a rescue dog! If the dog isn’t a good fit for you, it can be adopted by someone else and you still helped save a dog :) Louie’s legacy animal rescue is in NYC and always needs fosters
Idk if youve done it already but I would love to see a reaction to the injuries and fighting in Agents of Shield. In season 1 episode 4, it shows one of the agents speaking russian (i think anyway).  Agents of Shield has always been my favorite show to just binge and chill to.
GET THE CAT
Nah myth busters proved years ago it was possible. James Cameron just said “the script says he dies so jack has to die.” It’s one of my all time favorite mythbusters episode.
Omg bears little tuft of haaaaaiiirrrrr. I love a Bear moment.
Hi Doctor, I have a severely bad chest pain, the pain is really bad and I’ve had it for over two years now, when I get the pain it’s very sharp, tight and it feels like my lungs are hurting my heart, what do you think you might know where my chest pain is coming from?
My opinion of Rose is already pretty low (cheated on her fiance instead of just ending it, dropped the *_PRICELESS_* necklace into the ocean instead of giving it to her family to sell so they'd be set for life, etc.), so her pushing someone else off for Jack...would've lowered my opinion of her to subterranean, I guess.
4:12, Do they make brown cats. Bro what. You mean breed brown cats?
It needs more likes guys! I’m a cat girl and I’d love to see Bear with a kitty that looks like him!
Even tho we ain’t at 300k
he said: “do they make brown cats
Get that cat
2:40 this is my favorite trend ever
Years ago I babysat, or should I say "dogsat" 2 black Newfoundlands, Jake and Willow. They were HUGE compared to what I was used to and there was drool everywhere! It felt like I was with 2 grizzly bears and not dogs. But it ended up being a very memorable experience for me. At the time, I wasn't quite comfortable being in a house alone, especially overnight. But Jake and Willow made me feel safe and they had hearts bigger than their heads.
GET THEM 300K LIKE
Actually, yes Dr. Mike, I think you & Bear 🐻 DO look alike. You both have that "just got out of bed" look. Not too mention both of you are SO very handsome 😍 I love Newfie's & have groomed quite a few in my day. So I feel your pain, when I watch what you put yourself thru, when you groom him.  I have Rotties (my largest weighing in at 185) My current lap loving, love bug weighs 150. People are afraid of him, but he'd sooner lick 😋 you to death than harm anyone or anything. I train all my Rotties as therapy dogs 🐾 Thanks for sharing, Mike.
If you think weiners bark a lot definitely don’t get a corgi haha!
I kinda don't want bear to get a cat...So sorry :(
Let me doit for you  Let me doit for you  Kermi
Dr. Mike, what are your thoughts on Emotional Support Animals/Emotional Support Pets? Would you recommend going through the process of certifying a pet as an ESA/ESP (I don’t remember which it is actually called) for someone with high anxiety and depression?
搜爆犬 Sōu bào quăn, dog that seeks explosives.
Dude, a Corgi is the farthest thing from chill.  It will run laps through the house and over the back of the couch while you're sitting there and is gone before you even have a chance to yell their name.  LOL  Ask me how I know. ;)
You guys. Tell everyone to like this- I NEED TO SEE DR MIKE WITH A CAT
4:14 WELL HERES A SMALL FACT, there’s a type of cat called York chocolates and they look JUST like bear
I love Bear, and I love your vids mike! <33
Bear has the cutest bark ♥️
Can you all tell him to react to a game call accident pls
I liked just so you'll  get the cat......I love kitties! Save them all :) If you get a kitty, you should do a collaboration  w/ kitten lady. 😸
In titanic it totally looks like they could have balanced on top if theyd tried a little more so i think the movie crew should have just used a smaller floating wood prop
Not at all meant as hate, I'm not against crate training, but it's so fascinating to me how it seems to be a purely cultural thing. I live in Denmark, and dog owners here generally don't crate train (apart from a few individuals with very large high-energy dogs like e.g. huskies) - Yet I've never heard of anyone's dog actually making a mess of their home. I've had dogs consistently since I was 2; we/I never crate trained but maybe had more off-time to be at home with the puppy than what is the norm in the US (can anyone elaborate? Av. work week in Denmark is 37 hrs)? IDK, maybe we're all just lucky, lol. I feel like once you make it past the terrible teen-fase at like 6-8mo,  they pretty much know good "house manners" ❤ Dogs are just awesome lol
Do they make brown cats? 😂😂😂
Corgi owner for 20+ years. They are NOT chill. They are herding dogs and need lots of attention and stimulation.
Everyone of my siblings was born 4 weeks early and we were my moms special uv baby's because we were yellow because our kidneys weren't ready
I have a cat named Kevin
Dr Mike please react to  rugby

“It’s dangerous to go alone take this” -old man 1:15
Okay but what’s the bathroom situation for dogs in apartments?!
I like Bear, he's a big puppy!!!
So true about the sound of a dog throwing up. I remember my beagle getting sick once in the middle of the night, and at the first retching sounds I had already scooped him up and brought him out to the backyard before I was even fully awake, lol.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA PART LMAO 🤣
my dog is called charlie but i call him hound
@BEAR THE NEWF HI
LET ME DO IT FOR YOUUUU
Doctor Mike, my tip, let the dog choose you. I have never pick out a dog, I let my dog pick me.
My rescue doggo is the perfect match. The game changer was having a talk with the person of the organisation where we discussed my personality, where I live and what I was looking for. She suggested 3 doggos, I met them and the second one was a perfect match. Definitely a process that considers your lifestyle should help you with a rescue doggo.
GET THE CAT!
Bear seems such like a huggable teddy bear. Also I hope nothings too bad for your anxiety. I also hope you have a friend or someone to help with your load. Thanks for all that you do!
That is a fact my dog looks exactly like I do lol
300k likes people please 😂😂😂😂😂
foster dogs and adopt the one for you
so what kind of cat are you getting? i suggest a kitten
a borzoi in the snow! and snowborzoi
I have a reaction recommendation, it would be really cool if you could react to 'Outbreak' the movie, it's really good and I recommend :>
Bear: "No thoughts, head empty."
What happened to roxy the husky?
Had a friend back in hs that researched the titanic and she found that one man survived swimming around in the water for a ridiculously long time because his bac was so high.
you should watch mythbusters
Sorry Dr. Mike, but Bear is soooo much more cute than you! 😂
Really want him to see dr.Glaucomglecken's videos on family medicine
The top of Mike and Bear's heads do look the same.
Bear special 🤩
i’m just realising how mike looks so much like matt rife
Corgi's are working dogs - they don't have a ton of chill.
Please like the vid ! i want a cat ❤
“Do they make brown cats??” 😂😂😂 yes, cats are manufactured in factories
300k likes guys
So why not say “he slobbers so be careful” rather than be careful he slobbers” people won’t freak out
Bear could probably beat Mike in Boxing.
Hope you see this. Be super careful with a leash in an elevator. It can be extremely dangerous if the leash is in the door when it closes.
I would fly all the way to NY just for bear cuddles 😌
What if Mike made a channel for bear and it was called, Dogtor Bear. I know it sounds dumb but I just had that thought a little while ago. AND NO THAT WAS NOT A TYPE Dogtor Bear
Doc, would you consider doing a video on "day to day ergonomics"? Like investing in a pair of well made shoes, a proper matress, standing desk, ergonomic chair etc. I personally spend all my life using/standing/sitting in/on at least one of these things. That's gotta be worth some thought.
is being 90 pounds for a 10 year old good for a athlete boy
Where’s the cat :>
Rescue dogs are the best!, My 1st dog (as an adult) was a rescue. When I got him; he put his paw up on the kennel door at the pound and gave me a look like, take me home, so  I did (somehow I knew that was my dog). He actually seemed always  thankful to have a permanent home
I work in a grooming salon and we have this one brown Newfie named Ripp, and every time he comes in, all I can think of is Bear. 😂💕💕  Also, Bear is what Mike's personality looks like; Big and fluffy and happy.
"do they make brown cats?" ...who is "they"? In which factory are they making cats?
GET DA CAT
1. Intrusive thought: Feed bear a buncha nuggets and time him, yes!....nahhhh better not Mike: we cant do that safely so not happening Me: agreed but come on. 😂  2. Mike: be careful with Ibuprofen and hangovers Me: Dr Mike always looking out for us 🫡🫡
I’ve never seen you pluck so much hair off Bear and drop it on the floor. Please say that you either have a regular cleaning service or an automatic vacuum cleaner?
His head hair always cracks me up. I had a cocker spaniel with hair like that and he was SO GOOFY!
Bear doesn't know something else about the floor when the elevator door opens. But he knows you and your body language. Just a little movement of your hand, your knee, your head or something else tells him if it is the right floor or not. Even if you don't notice it he will
I died at wienermegaly 😂😂😂😂😂
My cat's name: Joe What I call him: Joey, Joey Boey, Jojo, Bubba, Bubby, Baby Boy, Potato Man, Jojo potato, Fat Man, Big Boy, Loverboy, Old Man
Bear is the dog we all need. I hope you get a cat! Cats are the coolest animals out there, you'll learn so much from it.
I think Bear is a BOOFER.
Get a Corgi and not a cat. The cat will not hesitate to tear up your couch and will probably make eye contact with you as it knocks down anything you have from your shelf.
As a dog trainer, I can tell you that Bear is probably just excited that a new person is about to come through the door. It sounds like misdirected excitement rather than territorial behavior. I also don't think that he'd break HIPPA by telling other people what you told him. He's basically your therapist.
I had wiener dog. He was so friendly that when someone came to our house, they couldn't take off his shoes in peace, because the dog was flying around their legs, jumping on them and licking them. We joked that our wiener dog would protect us from a thief not by attacing them, but by sharing his overwhelming love 😅
I had the worst day today. Two exams and a viva. Med school is getting harder each week. Your videos keep inspiring me and helps me calm. Thank you so much, doctor, for healing so many people just with a smile ❤️
i guess that 300k likes got smashed real fast :P
wait the costume is actually godzilla
1:13 I missed your jokes, Doc😂❤
I just checked how much that in kg , he's heavier than me in 1 kg lol , and I thought it's all just fluff 😂😍
I think that the most important thing or one of it before having a second dog is to know his personality and not to stress the other dog. Also show him not to feel that he is being change or something like that. Dr. mike if you wish to give Bear a brother/sister first see how Bear interact with other dogs in his own house. Then if you wish to have a rescued dog, get information from several animal shelters and the dogs that are in their also have a history, try to know a little bit of them and make your decision
BEEEEEEEAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Snuggles... Yes, I think will cure my depression 🥹
So my dog is a Siberian Husky malamute and he actually weighed in at 150 lbs 💀
He s so cute.. the Baby bear 🐻
Mythbusters did an episode about the titanic. They could've both fit on there and the plank would've floated just fine.
I like how Dr. Mike pointed out his merch to us only after there was a thumbnail there that blocked it from view. 😆
"I think dogs don't remember anything negative."    They remember being left in a crate for 8 hours, that's for sure.
10:36 I would recommend finding local shelters near you and going on the website. Usually they’ll have a catalog of dogs with info about their breed their shot history, medical history, and how old they are but they definitely also have a personality type and tell you if they are dog friendly or cat friendly kid friendly. And they’ll usually tell the personality and when you go in you can meet the dog and you have like a little bit of like get to know your time you get to figure it out like how the dog is if it fits with you if you guys would bond.
What breed is bear?
not dr. mike thinking corgis are a chill dog,,,,,
My dog does the same thing when someone is at the door!
React to avengers or any other superhero movie
Not Click the like button because I don't like cats and wouldn't like Bear to have a cat at home!
Corgis are the furthest from “chill”
we are now on a mission to get 300k likes! WE NEED A NEW ADDITION TO THE FAMILY!!! WHOS WITH ME!!!!
There was a question. I'll be really greatful if answer. Do we have physical chest pain whn we r sad or go thru emotional pain?
3:33 I had taken the LAST BITE of my double chocolate muffin. Insert crying emoji here 😭
Ok I’m really hung up on the fact that that he got the tune for don’t stop believing wrong 😅
Bear video? Let’s put this on repeat ♥️👏🏽
Big dogs are the best. My mind cannot be changed. Bear is good boy. Dare I say one of the Best Boys 🥹
You should check out Girl with the Dogs! Sooo much doggo fun and honestly learned a ton about different breeds and care.
Rescue dogs organizations work with you and helps you find the right dog.  I have two and they are amazing.  The trick is to have an idea of what breed you want and work with a rescue group of that breed.
The bozoi memes are following me  help
Dr. Mike when you held Bears mouth open, it looks like he has a retained deciduous tooth (503/504 maybe?) If Bear ever needs to go under anesthesia (maybe for a dental in the future) you should def ask to have it removed
Bear Content!
To pick a rescue dog i would look at your local rescue sites and look at the amils up for adoption. Also when we rescue my dog Charlie he chose my mom. He used to sneak upstairs and get in her bed. When i got my resuce cat milo he was abused underweight and when we went to view him at our local vet he climed up ontoo my boyfriends shoulder and started to purr. Long story short anmianls will choose us
100000 is the best I can do
Dr. Mike!  I’m disappointed you didn’t know the Borzoi breed, aka Russian Wolf Hound. Hmmmmmmm?
yo imagine being afraid of apples im afraid of doctors {Insert.apple.image.here}
His dog weighs the same as a small adult. Wow.
Do they make brown cats... What🤣🤣
8:56 I was like that even with my coworker's cat as well 😁😅
My cat was never scared of vacuums, but then she got into a fight with some other cat (really bad fight, her whole side needed to be stitched) and now she's freaking out, it's like... can cat have PTSD? she's sitting on the floor frozen, not reacting to anything, you have to slowly approach her, talk to her and pet her before she moves a bit. When she was hiding and I didn't know about her, I turned on the vacuum cleaner, she jumped so high in the air and screamed like I was murdering her. She never acted like this so I'm thinking if she can have PTSD from the fight or something
My medium mystery mix looks like someone took a German Shepherd and tried to turn it into a Keeshond while thinking vaguely about a corgi and then gave up before they were done. In other words, mostly black and brown with a super-fluffy double coat and a splatter mask on his face, neck ruff and butt fluff, but only knee-high and usually 38 pounds, gets surprised eyes when he barks. He loves his crate and will run in there when he gets overwhelmed, but he'll stick his front half out so he can still get pets.
If you want a rescue dog try Villa lobos rescue Center.  You may know them from pitbulls&parolees
I like dogs with short hair and that look strong but not tall. I like short dogs. But having any dog is better than having no dog.
You are not supposed to let your dog lick your mouth they have bacteria in their bodies naturally we can't handle without getting very sick the same is 4 as we have bacteria that they cannot handle without getting very sick so allowing them to lick around your mouth where you could potentially get their saliva is just not good it's also really gross and makes me want to be sick
Get bear a pet cat. Like this vid up 🔥
Omg bear is soooooooo cute
I was promised Bear in a Halloween costume! Where's the Bear costume?!
„How is that dog so tall?“ 😂😂☠️
Pls get a brown cat
“Do they make brown cats?” HELP IM CRYING
Ha! We had a 2 meme dog.  A dachshund that ate our entire  couch & love seat . He was a lover but was a standard so a 35lb badger hunter underneath that cuteness. He also had a bad owner his 1st year and wasn't neutered yet.
I know I'm like the only person in the world that doesn't like dogs... this was still a fun video. You should definitely get a cat!
Your puppy might be smelling home before you do! That's why he might know which floor to get off and on from! Never underestimate their nose...
I'm not much of a dog person, I love cats more, but I really want a Bear in my life 😂
Did bro just ask if they make brown cats 💀💀💀
EVERYBODY LIKE THE VIDEO THAT WOULD BE SO FUNNY!  HAVING A BROWN CAT AND A BROWN DOG!! LOL
aww loved the video dr mike and bear is so cute
Hey Mike, can we get another day in the life video???
OH MY GOD. BABY BEAR!!!! 😍😍😍
This reminds of last month with my dog just kicking next thing I know I was charged with animal abuse
Unfortunately I had to put my 11 year old giant dog (120 lbs slender weight) down! He was a little like bear except for a little Malemute in him. He was so tuned into our family and calmed my anxiety attacks by insisting on long walks! And when we came back two hours later I was as new! He looked out for us and I looked out for him and when his last day came he looked me deep in the eyes and asked for relieve! I had him from puppy on, he was easy to train and never had a mean bone in him. I taught him not to protect me but to trust that I protect him. But he did protect his kitties numerous times, be it from Tom cats, lynx, dogs or foxes. He is greatly missed by everybody who knew him! Rest in peace gentle giant!
As I sit here eating a muffin :)
I love your Bear video!  Honestly, tho, I think you shouldn't promise a feline companion simply because of personality concerns. If Bear and the cat get along, great! But there are cats who are not accepting of dogs, even chill dogs. It's a case by case basis. If you do get one and they bond with Bear, then excellent! Just don't promise.
i learned more biology from Doctor Mike than from school
I've got 2 rescues, both of whom are perfect matches for me! I didn't get either of them from shelters, though. So, I don't have experience with that. However, the reason I didn't go with shelter is for the same reason presented, I wanted enough time to make sure they were good matches.   In both cases, I sought out an independent, non-profit rescue instead of a big chain shelter like the Humane Society. In both cases, we got a lot of time to get to know the dog before bringing, first him then her, home.   My advice would be to do the same. Look for the opportunity to have a few "babysitting" sessions with the dog before committing. I don't know if shelters allow that, since I've never gone that route, but take more time than a few minutes while shopping. Take a weekend if you can. Visit them multiple times before deciding. That's my advice.
GUYS 300K LIKES PLS
The minute I saw the one picture I automatically did “let me do it for youuuu…Kermi” 😂😭😂. Then I died laughing when they cut in with the TikTok song 🤣
We temporarily fostered dogs for rescue agencies until they could find forever homes. One of the dogs that we fostered found a forever home with us. Rescue dogs are so loyal. Both of our dogs are rescues and they've gotten out a few times but they never even left the front yard.
Chunky doggo
I love bear 🖤 my dog is Mr. Little Bear 🐻
Can we have bear videos like once a month PLEASE
So the thing about that scene in Titanic that a ton of people forget or just didn't see is the fact that Jack first pushes Rose up onto the door, then tries to climb on himself. The door flips and puts them both back in the water, so he makes the choice to not do it again. They can't both survive getting dunked in the water over and over and he knows it, so he sacrifices himself so she'll make it.
I feel the throwing up thing. My cats like to throw up down the cat tree, they even once puked into a spinning fan, not mentioning the many times they puked right onto the bed which you immediately have to strip of the sheets so its not gonna soak into the mattress. Hearing the sound of a cat puking gives me the biggest adrenaline boost to super fastly make sure cat is just puking on the ground
2:10 and you can not test this with out supporting chickens and chicks getting tortured, hold in tight spaces with other animals, ripped away from their families and afterwards brutally killed.
Mike: i don’t look alike with Bear! Also Mike and Bear: **has the same hair**
If you know someone with a dog you like, just take it and call it a rescue
if everyone doesn't make ten alt accounts and like this video i will lose all hope for humanity.
The dog is so lucky, I wish the same
Nice.
honestly, if i was to imagine mike as a dog, bear would be quite accurate. actually a lot lol
Corgis are the opposite of chill lol I love my 2 corgos, but they are so energetic.
Like this vid, Bear needs a pet cat
Regarding getting a rescue let them go to you rescue dogs especially choose you, you don’t choose them
6:23 This is so concrete operational thinking that I smirked.
If you're serious about getting another dog my husband has a dog training business, Red Earth Thunder dog training. He does skype consultations and can teach you how to temperament test dogs at the shelter to pick the right partner and tips on what to do when you bring them home. Also most shelters will let you do a meet and greet to see how they get along with Bear which I highly recommend.
This is so wholesome! 🐶🐶🐶
I do have cardioyourwieneropathy, no two ways about it 😍
I swear I want a dog like bear. I have depression and the snuggles would help for sure.
Most shelters (the good ones, like SPCA) will actually have you fill out an application and see your personality, housing, lifestyle, energy level, etc, and then they will interview you (maybe) if they have more questions. If you already have dog(s) in your household, they will actually want your dog(s) to be at the shelter (or another neutral place) to see how they interact with each other. The staff at the shelter will determine if the dog you like actually fits your lifestyle (or they will see if there's a dog that matches your lifestyle). For a chill, calm dog, I (personally) recommend trying a retired racing greyhound, or a retired service/guide dog (it will be a super long waitlist though cuz everyone knows these dogs are sooooo well-trained, and the adoption fee will be higher. If you live in NY, consider taking a look at Guiding Eyes of the Blind, speaking as a volunteer there), or maybe a retired military canine (but some of them can be triggered by car alarms/certain smells/ or some random things due to its military background, and some military dogs can bite to that trigger since they are trained when to bite, also a super long waitlist), or a senior dog (that has been in a shelter for a long time, but most likely to be a bully breed/pit mix). Hope it helps.
I immediately liked. I wanna see him get a brother.
23H , 88k likes ..... you should start looking for a color matching cat 🤣🤣🤣
Corgis are not chill lol! They are working dogs and have lots of energy and are very loud. That being said I love my corgi
I love bear he’s the cutest!!! Seems like he give the best cuddles! More bear videos ❤❤❤
He weighs 130, but there's probably legitimately 5-10 pounds of hair.🤣
Bear is SO FLUFFY, what breed is he?
the thing is that u aktuellt looks like ur fog
That's not a whippet, but a Borzio, a Russian Sighthound, as big as a greyhound.
hey dr.mike! my family always rescues dogs. we go to petsmart because on the weekends they have animals to rescue. it doesn’t cost any money but you do have to pay for the health care and shots they need to get! hope that helps! 💕
Mike : if this video gets 300 thousand likes I'll consider buying a ca-  Me: slaps the fking like button
my only issue with crates is that it’s a VEEEERY long time to leave a dog in a small space.  how would you like being stuck in a crate 8-13hrs a day?!  that’s inhumane!!  I have a 10’x10’ welded wire pen I put mine in while at work and I still feel guilty about even that small of a space.
I have a rescued service dog. I went to a boutique rescue it’s called iWag in Atlanta, GA. I told them what I was looking for and my needs and they hooked me up with the sweetest boxer mix named Rosie. She has saved my life multiple times. She truly is the best dog ever. I did go for a purebred dog for my next service dog though only because she is getting older and not knowing her exact age makes it hard to develop a retirement plan. My boy is now 15 months old and a yellow lab. I can say there isn’t much of a difference between the two dogs. Maybe next I’ll get a rescue puppy. We will see how things are years down the line
You honestly do look like Bear lmao 😭😭💗
I can't believe you said that. It is exactly my retirement plan - to have a Newfie and a corgi so the corgi can take naps on the Newfie or just make carazy zoomies around him 😅  P. S. Please don't take a cat, don't do that to the poor Bear
I can tell you from experience , CORGI ARE NOT CHILL DOGS 🤣 they do need a lot of attention and mental work..😂 but their cuteness makes it all worth it 😍
There is a breed of cat who is brown. Just sayin’. ❤❤
I wish I could pet Bear omg I could die happy
Once, I had an alarm with different animal sounds. I picked the one with a cat going mreow-OW-OW-OW-OW in ever increasing intensity and volume. I figured I'd have difficulty sleeping through it. First morning, it went off, I bolted up right in bed in a complete panic going, "Oh my God! The ferrets!"
I mean, look at your hair...  You are both fluffy af 😂
WE MUST LIKE THE VIDEO
300,000 LIKES NOWWWW I WANNA SEE DA CAT
Time to get to 300k likes for us to get a Bear cat for Bear :D
Dr Mike- Do they make brown cats ? Me “YES OF COURSE THEY DO”😂❤️
My dog Buddy (passed a couple years ago) had the same attitude as Bear. We ended up calling him a watermelon because he was just so mello and sweet. I think it's cause he felt safe and secure. Of course he also always loved to bark and howl when he got the chance to be "tough" 😂❤️ lots of love to Bear ❤️
I think I’m having heart palpitations and I can see my heart beat through my clothes pls help and I made the worst decision and looked it up
Honestly….
Hey Doctor How's it going? I just wanted to tell you that I live in Iran and one of the channels on our TV shows YOUR videos! (It's name is Shabake Salamat

Dcotor Mike! I got a problem. How do i stop bruxism? Im 14 years old and you mind replying? Thanks! :D
He is now dog mike
Rescue dog: my best advice would be to meet lots of different dogs in their foster homes before you pick. The big events are way too chaotic to see what they’re really like. And obviously at a shelter you may not see much personality come out. I wish there were more shelters or rescues that recommended dogs to you based on your needs but I haven’t found any that do that.
Bear is the goodest of bois ❤
That tiger meme was sent around in South Africa when a tiger had escaped a reserve and was making its way around town.
Bear seems like the type of dog to run up to you and slobber on your face
We’re past 300K likes….WHERE’S THE CAT 🐈‍⬛
bear looks so chill. i want one
I trust the Mythbusters over James Cameron any day.
my dog loves the hoover (vacuum) we even hoover him to get the loose fur off him after a brush.
7:22 Bear is like: WTH BRUH!!!!
Crate training is great if it's just a teething puppy wanting to chew on stuff. If a dog actually has separation anxiety though it's not a solution and they will just be having a panic attack in the crate. So it's important to know which is which.
Bear is gentle giant☺
As a corgi mom, Corgis have NO CHILL!  They're herding dogs who need to be busy and/or have a job. Gotta love a corgi butt though...
TOTALLY OFF TOPIC BUT I GOT AN OCARINA
Take bear to a shelter and let him pick out a cat
Yes, Bear deserves a pet cat!
Dog's shouldn't be put in cages. Apart from that, nice video. :)
2 good big burgers  Dr Mike vs bear
I was looking for an animal to match my personality to help me with my depression - I now own ferrets. They are the light of my life.
I am eating a muffin while watching- 💀
I think you forgot to put your merch link in your description.
Bear's doggy door would be half a door
Rose did tell Jack to get on and Jack said no because they would of been to heavy. Its not a room issue its a  buoyancy issue. Everyone arguing this needs to watch the movie again. P.s. I love Bear 🐻 ♥
Dogs definitely do remember negative experiences sadly - my rescue dog has PTSD and if she smells certain odours that remind her of her original owner she shuts down and has severe nightmares 😭
Important message. It’s not “DOGGO” it’s “DOGGY”
wow it is good
Corgis are NOT chill. I love mine, but she is FULL of energy
"Half of people welcome his drool on their face as if it's moisturizer" Mike at 3:13 Also Mike at 0:33
I love friends good show my pick up line is how you doing also I gave a name to Joey's personality Joey syndrome
What a handsome, wholesome man we have to grace our presence. And Dr. Mike is great too!
Get Bear that kitttttyyy!!! (Also do they make brown cats is such a wonderful sentence hahaha)
None of my dogs are crate trained they don't eat the count and ones a husky mix
BEE WOOF
Get 2 cats! Please 🙏 read about benefits. It will be so much better for them (remember to adopt, get black cats as those are the least adopted ones)
It's not called a Weiner dog it's a daschound and I have one she's my world and a non trained service dog she just knows my very poor vision and helps me she hardly ever barks but when she does it's loud and a but sqeaky haha
I would love to see Bear in a Video from Girl with the dogs...she would love him.
You laughing at the cone when I’m thinking “the cone of shame”
About if you look like your dog: I don’t think you look that much like Bear but you and Roxy look alike!
There are GREAT rescues in NYC…. There are so many opportunities for you to make a great impact with rescues. They are purebred rescues if you prefer, but they actually will work with you during the adoption process! I certainly certainly pray that you use your platform and all of these followers to help rescues!
One of the dogs that survived the sinking of the Titanic was a Newfoundland dog like Bear. He even helped with the rescue.
Half of the video: Mike throwing Bear hair behind the couch
2:34 Russian Greyhound  YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS/j  Luv ya ♡
How to break up a dog fight?  Okay, hear me out. If a dog attacks my dog... Glock...
Since your russian, I have a question about the language. Do you confuse У&Ш with Y&W
I love how his hair is sticking up :D
If you need help with deciding what rescue dog why don't you get evey dog from 1 shelter
If you ever get another dog and decide to rescue,  you'll be able to find a dog that can be right for you. There are tons of dogs in rescues and lots of different breeds. Many rescues also do meet and greets with adoptable dogs so you can get to know their personalities. And many of them are still puppies. I would recommend finding a good trainer because some of them might have some bad habits from previous homes (or lake there of) but definitely not all of them!
Do dogs know when there going to die?
Hey doctor mike how do I get my only dog left cause his sister died of unknown reasons and she died with puke coming out and poop when she died also what does and how do I get him to eat more my last dog isn't a full bred great Pyrenees
BROWN POINTED RAGDOLL WITH FOLDED EAR THINGYMAHIGGIES
I think likes sky rocket and you gonna get cat XD
*It's always a good day when Bear 🐻 makes an cameo* 😁😁😁
review the Surgery in movie Awake  maybe?
Like the sh** out of this video, we need that cat 😺❤️
You live in New York which means you live are the headquarters of the ASPCA that’s a good place to go
My cat:I,m a storm cloud and I,m a sassy girl/storm cloud
Best tip for shopping a rescue, really... Is ASK THE RESCUERS and other staff working the place. They'll know who's who and spend time with ALL of the animals in their care. If there's a likely "truly athletic and fun loving" or a "loud mouth but sweet heart", those people will know...      It's also REALLY worth their time and effort to be up front about everything. The last thing they want is a pissed off "customer" bringing back a dog that had some unexpected issues, especially behavioral ones. If you just want a chill dog, SAY SO... It's not difficult. I've worked the rescues and rehab's and most of us REALLY do not want to have to go retrieve a dog that was supposedly headed to a forever-home.      Other than that, it's just worth a little extra time to make MORE THAN ONE VISIT... This isn't exactly a place to hang out, but you don't get a dog (or any pet) quite the same way you go to Walmart and buy a claw hammer. Get some insight to the people around the place as much as you get their insights for the dogs or cats or whatever else. It helps to just be sure you're working with a group "on the up and up", and most of them generally are legit'. There are a few who can slip into the pitfalls of dealing with puppy mills and some dubious things, though... You might even consider occasional volunteer time to work with a group... AND while Dr. Mike might be too busy, I also KNOW more than Dr. Mike should see this... SO think about it. There's no better way to get to know a facility than to spend real time there... regardless of what they do.  ;o)

One of my favorite dog breeds, and when I hope to have one day is a Neapolitan mastiff, because of the big droopy slobbery jowls. Don’t even get me started on the wrinkly face. They’re just so freaking adorable.
Mike: you gonna laugh at these right Beat: tiniest bark Mike: yeah, yeah
You can always go to a breed specific rescue. I had to give my wheaten terrier up & I was absolutely determined he was only going to the folks that could & would take the best care of him.
Bear: "urg he has dropped the ball for the 5th time, im not going to get it for him any more if he drops it one more time!", Mike: "I guess he must be tired or something and doesnt want to play fetch anymore"
Funny thing about elevators and stairs: I live on the 5th floor, and when we use the stairs, my little lady always thinks she needs to go down just one stair instead of all 5, so she probably has no conception of floors. Likewise, if the elevator stops at 3rd floor instead of the 5th, she always means to go out
I am under the age of 30 and I have a dog, with anxiety, and a dog with anxiety 🤣
5:42 me and my family is the welcome drool 😂😂😂
5 times is more than I got out of my dog.  Usually I just got the are you an idiot look. I swear he was half cat.  Which is funny because I now have a cat that would play fetch with a hairband.
Where's the Bear cat
Your dog looks like my dog but biger and more fluffy
What breed is bear?
You need to make more videos with bear
I have a little Chiweenie (Chihuahua and weenier dog mix), but she's mostly Chihuahua, her weenier dog genetics are her hide, it's too big for her (but I think she also has weenier dog behavior genetics because she barks a lot)  Edit: Actually this Chiweenie's dad (another Chihuahua) just recovered from it's eye swelling (long story and I prefer not to talk about it)
1:10 A SINGLE FREAKING MINUTE IN, AND WE'RE ALREADY MAKING DINGALE DANGLE JOKES
2:35 Its the limmidoitforu dog
It’s great that you’re considering a rescue! Please also consider this if you get a cat, there are plenty of kittens and puppies in shelters waiting for a good home. As for getting a rescue that matches your personality and energy if you want to get an adult, it’s best to visit a shelter and ask to spend time with the animals they have up for adoption. Most of the time when people do this and allow themselves to be chosen by an animal, they end up with a true friend.
You have the same hair and build
I do like your videos, but the thumbs up on this one is specifically a vote for the cat😺
I will be waiting for the cat! 😷
I feel slightly offended that your dog weighs more than me, a full grown adult person.   HOW am I so skinny
Hey Mike would you consider vlogging more like about your day to day and about bear and stuff🙏🙏
my dog fetch only 3 times outside... he likes to sniff more... he looks at me like we're wasting our time, we can play at home. let me work and mark territory xD
If your Alexa was on in the room, yes,you broke HIPAA talking to Bear abt your pts. Worked for United Healthcare (wfh cx svc) & they made us turn off Alexas and similar devices. Apparently they passively listen&record, which UHC declared, to us anyway, a HIPAA violation.
Everyone talks about “crate training” dogs but it’s illegal in my country
PET CAT FOR BEAR!!!!! ><
If you like the corgi, have a look at the Västgötaspets. Or as you probably would know it, Swedish Vallhund (or wolf corgi). They were around during the Viking age more than a thousand years ago.
come one people! 300k likes for a brown kitty! let's pump the like button up!
Now you've gotta get a choco kitty cat !!
what? no the myth busters did the whole titanic door thing with a full recreation of the door, there was plenty of room for both of them and it wouldn't sink even with the weight of 2 fully grown men on that door.
Bear <3 He's such a good boy and soo cute just resting his head on your lap
My bernese's "pedigree name" is penelope, her real name is Dida, but nowadays she goes by Melania Ranieri. Her lifestyle is my biggest inspiration. She wakes up, eats, gets cuddles, goes for a nice walk, sleeps, eats, sleeps, goes for a walk. All punctuated by cuddles.
When my dog throw up she just eats it up again
That crate training thing works great. I’ve done it will all my dogs over the years and there have been many. Until my daughter brought her dog home from Arizona. Her living situation had become unsafe and she moved in a hurry and had to separate him from his brother and sister. Ever since the. He has SEVERE separation anxiety. I have never seen anything so bad. He has ruined 2 crates. Each time it took him about 10 min to do it. He was so freaked out about being left alone he bent the crate so much that there are pieces of the wire framework sticking out at all angles. The door is bent at a 90 degree angle so he could squeeze out. It’s horrible. The vet gave him meds for anxiety but we are also trying exercise and stuff because we are trying rescue type meds right now. He is young and if he goes on a Prozac style drug he will be on it the rest of his life. So he goes to day care when we have to go anywhere. Even if it is out to lunch. We just can’t put him thru it.
I can’t wait to meet Bear’s cat❣️🫶🏼🐾
Petition for 300k likes because doctor Mike is missing out not having a cat
Bear is just a gaint teddy bear and noone can tell me otherwise😭❤ I'd love to cuddle with a doggo like bear❤
Oh, honey, Corgis are NOT chill dogs. They are very athletic livestock guardians full of love and energy!
DR. MIKE GET A CAT
what da dog doin?
Good video because the last one was sad.
You'll be getting that cat in no time
Petfinder aggregates information on dogs you can adopt in your area.  You can set all sorts of parameters about size/breed/age etc., and it'll alert you when there's a compatible dog in your area.  I think you should check that out if you're looking for a rescue!
For anyone interested in adopting a dog, but unsure because if your personalities would match: adopt trough an organisation that has their dogs with foster pawrents first! You'll be able to meet the dog more than once before adoption, and the foster family can tell you about their personality and behaviour!
What is he throwing to the back of the couch?? 😅
When I was a kid, I was jumping on the trampoline and then all of a sudden I got my leg caught in between the springs. It hurt so bad…
get this to 300k likes
If you want another chill dog, do NOT get a Corgi. They are high strung, bossy, busy bodies that constantly bark and nip/bite. 😅 I have a Corgi, love the breed for many reasons, but them being chill .... Not something they know how to do. 🤣 Btw, these are known things about the breed, they were bred for herding originally. So barking, nipping, being bossy, and high strung works great in that job, not so much with hanging out and watching TV/playing video games. 🫰🏻
get a cat
Please react to camp cretaceous
If you want to adopt a rescue dog, you should go to PETA before they euthanize them. Sadly it’s the vast majority of the animals rescued by PETA that end up getting euthanized.
Psst -  The MythBusters proved that both Jack and Rose could have been on the door and it would not have sunk...
Agh, why did I have to find your new 17 minute video 5 minutes before my bedtime 😭 Sleep is important, I'll watch this tomorrow!
That was a good video. Please do more videos with Bear!
I have a question why do drugs help me with coping with ADHD pls tell me and also what does ADHD stand for I have it and idk
It was a borzoi
Maybe a California king bed would help 😊. My cat sleeps on the pillow next to me, twin bed.
We need to get to 300k likes
My puppy is 10 months old and 65lbs. He’s a lab mix (has 18 kinds of dog according to his dna) and he likes to talk. He has a scary af voice but he’s terrified of things like balloons and little kids. He literally hides between my legs when my nephew comes over.
A corgi should be an active dog. They were bred to herd cattle.  They are short so they can avoid getting kicked. Skip the corgi.
Lol
O brown cats exist
Dr. Mike, your should react to Brave Wilderness injuries. He gets stung and bitten by many different animals for educational purposes.
Ohh I miss my dog sooo much..  He died last year.. But we brought a bunny n no 1 will believe his habits r so similar to the dog we had..  Is rebirth real?
Mythbusters proved that Jack could have fitted on the raft.
That dog throwing up things also works for cats. I am a heavy sleeper, but any animal throwing up just snaps me back into reality and making sure they're not throwing up on the bed lol
Our dog is a pit bull wiener dog mix. 3yrs old and 35 lbs.
But leaving dogs in crates for a long time is just 😬
Dr mike why am i scared of dogs is it weird
1:08 "cardiomyopathy (cardio = heart, myo = muscle, pathy = disorder) -> cardiomywieneropathy" Not medically consistent (the "wiener" is not a muscle), but I still appreciate the semantic twist of "my wiener" 😂
Dang, memes from Icanhascheezburger and Icanhashotdog from like 2007.  you got the OG good stuff.
You should do a collab with a Vet and compare/contrast medical treatments between animals and humans!
Well my dog surely looks like me, small, fragile and always mad as hell
I love videos with Bear!
10:42 are u sure about me hitting u down below
Get a cat they r sweethearts
My family watched my sisters wiener dog for a week and she slept with me every night snuggling me 🥺
Dr. Mike, if you are worried about finding a dog that matches your energy level, lifestyle, etc. It is best to adopt a dog from a rescue because all rescue pups stay with a foster family so their foster parents get to know that dog really well.  Whereas dogs at an animal shelter don’t get as much one on one time and are in a high stress environment, so it can take them some time after being adopted for their true personality to really shine. I have adopted furbabies from shelters, rescues, and puppy mills and each has been an incredibly rewarding experience. 💗 One more thing about rescues, you can even find breed specific dog rescues, so if there is a particular breed that meshes well with you, you can even adopt from a breed specific rescue.
I have a caucasian shepherd, she's 18 months old at 165 pounds and is the sweetest big baby ever! I bet her and bear would be best friends
Just dont get a german Shepard because they have a lot of energy and bear seems like a dog that is just chill.
300k lets do it
Honestly I think we need a cat version of Bear
I imagine reading about Dr. Mike being brought up on ethic charges for telling his dog about his patients.
That doggo doesn't explode, Mike, it smells for explosives at the airport 😂😂😂 the translation i swear lmao
Es cierto que nuestros amigos(mascotas) ven lo mejor en nosotros, tienen un corazón de angel, me derrito al ver esa conexión entre el dr.mike y oso, es única y tan tierna🥰
Dr Mike I think you should do a medical reaction of Cobra Kai scenes
Hi would you consider reacting/reviewing injuries caused in wars or in military conflicts? I believe it would be interesting and it would provide new content
I've never crated a dog and they have never eaten my couch or destroyed any of my property
Pretty sure HIPPA is good unless Bear learns to talk. 😂 Also, oddly Chihuahuas also manage to take up the majority of a bed.
Here's hoping for 300k likes! Just as a note though, there ARE brown cats. The color is called chocolate, and there's a lighter version called cinnamon. Both are dilute expressions of black. So is blue (that slate gray you often see). Chocolate is much rarer than blue, but it's out there.
I got a cat that looks like bear
"Bear doesn't have a doggy door" a bear sized doggy door is just a door, isn't it?
You look like bear
Bear resembles Mike in that he is Russian
Get him 300k likes I wanna see the cat + if u got the cat since you named your dog bear you could name the cat tiger?
I'll buy a cow from Poland if you get 12 mil
I def want to see a mini Bear cat
I have recently been stressed these past few days and this video is truly what I need. Itself is healing.
In titanic jack was the bad guy,a woman is to be meek in a dress and head covered. They must submit to Man in all things as God commands. No woman has rights or authority in this world.
i like how bear is just chilling
There are 2 types of Corgi those that  want to do nothing but cuddle and those that want to go to work  and herd something
😂😂😂😂 love this!
130 lbs of cuteness
8:29 this one and the x-ray of the heart one I’ve seen versions where the dog is replaced with a cat. There’s probably a couple more in here that have cat versions like the sharing the bed one
Mike: MEMES!🤩 Bear: no, MLEMS 👁👅👁
Bear, His Royal Highness Floofy Face...130 pounds of pure love.😊💜
8:45 lol my cat when he vomits picks carpet to vomit on, even though the house is 50% carpet. If he's over tiles he'll walk onto the carpet before vomitting
This whole video is a vibe. Dr. Mike with the hair on point, the glasses, facial hair, black shirt (there’s something about a man in a black shirt that is just 😍) and bear just straight chilling being the good boy that he is. I could watch this video multiple times 👌🏼
I want to be slobbered by Bear!
Bro said “do they make brown cats”  4:14 Lol
I love bear! He is so cute. And honestly, dogs help a lot when it comes to anxiety and stress. They can calm you down right away and you can tell them anything without fear of being judged. I love dogs so much. They truly are angels without wings
A lot of rescue shelters will do meet and greets as well as ask you questions to find a dog that fits your lit
Day 134 of trying to get dr Mike to watch the first episode of monster
hey! how old are you? weird question but i am younger and inspired to start!
Omg. I had 1 dog that would get to tiled floors to throw up for easy clean up I guess, and my other dog would hop off of the couch and throw up right on the carpet. She was 120lbs so we’d try to move her but she refused. She became catatonic 😂
Your local animal shelter should let you visit with a dog you're interested in. Ours has rooms for that purpose or you can take the dog for a walk. You can also volunteer to take shelter dogs for walks and meet compatible dogs that way. You can also volunteer to foster dogs, and when you find one you and Bear love, adopt him or her. That's how we got our cat.
hi mike, i volunteer at dog shelters and as a dog trainer. my piece of advice is get the dog out of the shelter environment. countless wonderful dogs are looked over in shelters because their personality doesn’t come out until they leave the stressful environment. I have a soft spot for nervous dogs, so I often walk them. let me tell you, the change i see in some of these dogs once they leave the shelter is remarkable. many shelters allow you to walk with the dog, which is a great opportunity to get to know the dog better! I always recommend patience. if you are interested in a particularly nervous dog, get on their level and avoid eye contact. treats are always a good idea if the shelter allows it. i suggest having an idea of what temperament of dog you would like, as deciding by breed is not always feasible. being open to breeds that often face prejudice, like pitbulls, staffies, and german shepherds help clear out shelters. i find those breeds and huskies to be the most common. as always, do your research! ask questions about the dog’s history! and remember, a dog can change dramatically when in a loving home. most importantly, when you meet the right dog for you, you will know. they will steal your heart. rescuing is so important.
to answer the question at 0:31 Imo you do look like bear, on the outside both look intimidating but on the inside it's a whole different story
I’m on my bf account watching this lol but my cat is over here like why she watching a. Dog video
whippet or not we now call it "let me do it for u"
The Chihuahua muffin one always gets me because I’d see my ex on the couch looking at his phone with the biggest smile and he was always looking at that picture. We don’t talk much anymore but I’ll occasionally send him this pic out of nowhere in case he needs a good laugh.   (he’s 100% okay with this btw)
Get the kitty!!!
A good way to know which dog is right for you is to volanter if you have time Or when you think you have the right dog foster so you know that he is good with bear and you
What's going on???
I expect to see a cat in the next 2 videos
Bear so cute. Love the breed for gentleness but couldn't live with the drool and slobber. You need a cat. Yes they can come in brown and brown points. Consider rescuing a cat. If Introduced proper cats and dogs get along. Or rescue a  dog friend for bear. The rescue will help you pick out a good match for you and bear.
I don’t know if your gonna read this but you have inspired me so much I love your vids I hope  they never end thank you your the best
Okay, Doctor Mike, take a seat. 1.  Not a Whippet, dog is a Borzoi (formerly called Russian Wolfhound). And judging by that photo of the pure bread, 10 to 1 that is a Borzoi, too. And don't argue with me on this, I used to have one. 2. As far as adopting a dog, there are a lot of breed rescue organizations (there's even one for newfies). I'm probably going to get a lot of flack on this but, I believe in the preservation of pure breds. If someone wants to adopt a mixed breed, just know that's a 50/50 situation as one doesn't know what genetic traits (good or bad) of the ancestry is in that dog. I would recommend you do some research (oh no, more reading?) on the different breeds and groups. My Borzoi was in the Hound Group, Bear is in the Working Group. See what jumps out at you, then focus your reading on that breed. I recently adopted a 5 yo Belgian Tervuren and his personality is what I wanted in my next dog.  3. Yes, dogs do remember bad things, and if they're getting negative punishment, the whole experience will be ingrained in their psyche.  Pee whoop!
This video made me remember how precious my little pup of 8 moths old was Rest In Peace Rocky the husky
mike… corgi’s are herding dogs. that’s pretty active LMAO
Lmao I remember having a "bell ringer" in Chemistry about how to figure out, by the dimensions of the door, if Jack would've fit and you had to explain your reasoning behind your answer hahah
Nice content I enjoyed it.what kind of cat breed do you like ?do not worry about anything doctor everything will be all right after passing a time.enjoy your life
And Bear makes me think of my Boerboel, Zoey! She looks very intimidating, but she’s SO chill and so good with kids! She’s overweight and big so that doesn’t help her look approachable 😸😬 but I’ve had her on so many diiieeets she just can’t seem to shake the weight off she has arthritis in both her shoulders and she has weak hips I think her hips are due to the weight she has to carry, but because of her shoulders she doesn’t like moving around to much she’s limited to what she can do even on supplements, so with her weight it’s very difficult, but she’s a champ she doesn’t let it hold her back!
i need more bear content!!!!!
Normally shelters will be able to give you some information about the dog’s personality, but you can also foster before adopting to see if the dog fits into your lifestyle, and you’re freeing up some room in the shelter by doing so!
You are normally allowed a trial period or to foster dogs first especially if you already have a pup like you. Talk to a shelter or pound, lots of mid to older dogs that really need love and would be a good chill friend thats extra grateful!
My cat is ENTIRELY CHOCOLATE BROWN... and a rescue! 💓
I so want a mastiff dog. It would be bigger than me and keep people away.
Get dog
About Jack & Rose... If someone says it would've been scientifically impossible for them to have survived, then how did Rose survive? It's literally a real event that happened, not some made up story for a movie😂
I love how you groom Bear and then just chuck the little bits behind the couch 😸 very relatable! 😸
So what kind if cat are you getting? Probably hit 300k likes in a couple days. There was 1k more in the ~12 minutes it took to watch this.
If you are looking into rescues, I just suggest being very patient with them. We rescued my most recent dog, she is a purebred pit-bull, and she was very aggressive with her food. If other dogs came near her food she would snap at them but after a few months of slowly bringing them into the same area for feeding, she stopped snapping. Depending on the breed of dog you get, the service you get them from, and their conditions from before they were rehabilitated, they can take longer to trust you. But give them time and they will eventually start to trust you.
hes what
If Someone breaks in your house Does Bear do something?
If you want to look for a rescue dog that is the right fit, I'd recommend fostering to adopt! It's really rewarding, you get to help dogs get adopted, and you pretty much get a free trial with most dogs that you're interested in.
It's cute how Dr Mike thinks Corgis are a chill dog. 😅 Little dog, BIG energy.
Dear Dr. Mike,    Don't worry at all about rescuing animals. When you rescue a dog, especially while it's still young, it's personality adapts to yours as it grows. It becomes accustomed to your habits and preferences, filling a little puzzle-piece-shaped hole in your heart. Rescue animals seem to know that you are their savior, and end up adoring you ad infinitum for the rest of their lives.    Yours truly,      Laura Barsalou
Some rescues will let you take bear to meet the possible new dog. See how they get along. Some also let you foster that dog before you adopt to see if it's still a good fit. Some dogs are fine with dogs outside but inside, that is the OGs area.  Some don't like sharing their people or space.   When my sister went to adopt her dog, I was allowed to bring my dog. They got to meet. They were not interested in each other which is fine. Now my sniper is the only dog my sister's dog gets long with. The even play together  Today is my dog, Sniper, 13th birthday.
Most rescues will allow you to "try out" different dogs. They usually have a little yard you take the dog to to get to know them and you can even bring your dog up there to see of they'll get along!
Bear could absolutely take me out man’s weighs more than me I’m in shock
On the Titanic meme: Mythbusters did a special with James Cameron and showed that it was plausible, but to make sure they both were out of the water she needed to tie her lifejacket to the bottom.
You think Corgis are chill dogs?! That was the best joke I heard all year :3
I love the Muttville senior dog rescue in San Francisco, they specialize in more older dogs (7+) that are usually overlooked because of their age but they're so well behaved and already potty trained etc! The staff is great at matching you to your new forever buddy!
Brown cats = Havana Brown... so, yes they do "make them"
Hey Mike! 👋👋  If you decide to add a cat to your household ( Also please dont call it “getting my dog a pet cat” 🙄) please check out @jacksongalaxy aka The Cat Daddy here on youtube. He is an expert cat behaviorist and has a lot of videoes on how to introduce a new cat to your household, What to expect and how to be prepaired 😊😊
My dog is the same way he acts all tuff when the doorbell rings but then he becomes all excited and happy.
My dog is ⏃ schipperke and he is 15 pounds Turning 8 this year. he is the sweetest little pup when he knows he can trust someone otherwise he can be ⏃ bit vicious, for example he got in ⏃ fight with ⏃ raccoon 3 times his size and the raccoon lost half of its tail.
Go to a shelter and ask for a meet and greet! That’s what I did with my rescue dog! The shelter i went they had me pick a few dogs I was interested in and brought me into a room and one by one got to meet and interact with the dogs!
Omg you HAVE to get Bear a kitten!!!
7:57 what my dog is called: Luna What we call my dog: loony tunes, luna bean, lunatic
YOU LOWKEY DO LOOK LIKE BEAR THOUGH
Bear looks so comfy and precious 🥰
Not breaking hepa if you tell your dogs about your patients had me dying
I would accept Bear kisses, while hoping the slobber was minimal... but accept those kisses regardless! But what I'd really love to do is just flop down on the floor beside him and just snuggle and pet him and love on him until my arms fell off.  As far as finding a rescue dog - I can only say that when I met "Romeo" face to face, I *knew* that he was supposed to be my boy. We just clicked, like, "There you are! I've been waiting for you to come get me!"/"There's my dog! So glad I found you!" Romeo came home with me almost 9 months ago, where he changed his gov't name to Brody Crystofur, but he also goes by Boo Boo, Boogie, Booger Sugar, Bubbers, and... Weirdo. I never thought of myself having a Boxer, until I met my boy. Now, I can't see myself without one.  Much love.
Yea get a cat
I’d be friends with Dr. Mike just to be Bear’s friend…😂❤
Bear weights the same as me 😂😂😂
tell bear i say hi 🐶
I’m pretty sure the white long haired dog is an afghan hound.
Borzoi

Here's my adoption tip: Don't get the dog you WANT... Get the dog you NEED. If it isn't what you are envisioning, or you don't have something spesific in mind,  but you keep coming back to it, It's The One You Need. applys for cats dogs and even children if you are adopting.
this worked for me* Went to a rescue to adopt a dog I had my eye on thanks to social media. I had eye contact with a completely different dog and said your the one. Never regretted my choice. Such a good boy. Don't worry the dog will choose you.
Yes, you do look like Bear, with the dark fluffy hair and caring eyes as well as the healthy build
These memes are hilarious and BEAR IS ADORABLE OMG 😍
I love how you are constantly throwing fur behind your couch 😀
This is my only like I’ve ever given, only because I love cats and need you to have one. 🤷🏼‍♀️
DOGE AND MOON MOON!!  WHO INVITED FUCKIN MOON MOON? DOGE THE SHIBE!!

Bear is enjoying soft life😭
The floof of hair on top of Bear's head is everything.
Let's get bear a cat
There are brown cats they are just very rare.
Honestly people say adopt don’t shop but realistically you should be doing a lot of the same things whether you go to a breeder or a shelter. I’m very active and I’ve always found the stoic look of a lot shepherd dogs to be really beautiful. I ended up getting a Mal-mix from a shelter, she acts so regal and well behaved because of how well her nature works into my lifestyle preferences. So I’d recommend getting an idea of the energy level you’d want how trainable you’d like the dog and how much mental stimulation you’ll be able to give the dog. Then find a breed that’s more likely to fit that or visit shelters to meet dogs and try and get a sense of their personality Edit: also consider age, time of year to get them(winter puppies are typically a bad idea for potty training), etc.
Bear is so stinkin' cute! 🥰
Its an adorable video. Its so human thing throwing bear's hair at back of the  couch. Nothing is made up by dr. Mike. Both of them were casually sitting on the couch and its done.
Bear :)
If you're looking for a rescue dog, look online and try to find when that dog is going to a meet and greet or rescue showing. That's how my parents knew our first dog was the right one - it was love at first belly rub!
One more bit about blueberry muffins: Very processed.
Ok, you two are ridiculously cute and I learnt so much about Bear but why did you have to go and say that thing about muffins out loud?
reason dogs hate fireworks is because they hear 40x better than a human and it hurts their ears

mike: do they make brown cats? me: MAKE???
people picked based on their preferences .. so should I not point out the Russian immigrant named his dog Bear?
Hope Dr. Mike and Bear will have a kitty buddy too!
I recommend pit bulls but you need to find a good breeder or go behind a Dutch brothers and find one in the dumpster that works that’s good we have a pitbull the sweetest thing it’s a boxer mix with a pitbull you can get a boxer you can also get a pitbull pitbull‘s are have a bad stereotype but if you train them good they are great pets they are great family dogs and they will do great with your new
I want your puppy 😍 he's so gorgeous and I want to cuddle him
They also make surgical suits for dogs very nice just gotta make sure it’s not too tight and that you’re letting the area get air
James Cameron was on Mythbusters for that exact myth.  And they proved Jack could have survived but James then wouldn't have the ending he wanted.
4:15 do they make brown cats😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When I rescued my dog, she picked me.  I visited a few dogs and went to the play room and watched them...The one I brought home was the most friendly and social dog. When I went back she seemed like she remembered me and that sealed the deal.  Let the rescue animal pick you. Visit a few times and just observe their temperament and behavior.  The one that picks you will let you know he or she is the one to adopt.
As a Corgi owner, I can tell you that they are not (normally) chill. They're a herding breed so they're generally very active and on the go and they tend to be barkers. One of mine is very chill, she's a mini version of Bear actually, but it's not normal for the breed. I sure wish it was though, I could have a thousand of her.
Bear reminds me so much of my parents' doggy. He's a big scary looking 55kg German Shepherd who is such a pathetic little softy in private.
I AM the doggy drool moisturizer person
I have a dachshund and she is so sweet and cuddly and she makes my day ❤
Can you react to On or Mic drop by BTS?
“Do they make brown cats”😂

Bear just makes me want to snuggle next to him on a couch with a blanket and just lay there and watch movies

I have volunteered in a rescue organization now for a decade and I totally believe you can find a perfect rescue dog for yourself. You don't have to do it all by yourself! The volunteers/staff of the shelters or rescue organizations know their dogs incredibly well and they will help you find the right match. People often contact us asking which cat or dog we believe would be best for them. We are here to help. This is how my friend found their Corgi/Golden retriever mix.  Oh, and I totally would love for Bear to get his cat buddy!
Getting a rescue that fits your personality/lifestyle/energy is actually super easy!! Most shelters put descriptions of the dogs' personality on their site or, when you're applying online, they'll have somewhere for you to describe the kind of dog you're looking for. Also, depending on the shelter, some places will have you meet the dog and introduce your dogs before you bring them home !!!
Ok so I'm almost 34 but I have only 1 of 3 & I don't have a dog.
I love bear ❤️
My dog doesn’t like me is there something wrong🐶😢
4:05 CMON GUYS, MAKE IT HAPPEN
You should get a Burmese cat they are brown and very dog like and social, I have a Burmese cat and absolutely love dogs
sup my dudes God bless yall haha really cool memes!
Take bear to an elevator with a glass wall to the outdoors so they see going up/down
My cat has no pigment in their eyes. I told my mom I don't want her fixed because the babies could have the eyes. And my mom says it won't. I need a doctors opinion on this.
"If anyone has any tips... hit me down below..." Ya sure you wanna get hit there???? I'll do it! Though I'm not very strong, I'm sure it'd still hurt! I'm just making sure you fully understand what you just asked.
I have had 2 dogs in my life one was a pure bread beagle, and the other was a rescue. I never thought my heart could heal after my beagle passed because he lived until he was 15, and he was my childhood dog that I loved. After a few months my family got my rescue dog, and he had a place in my heart. We got him as a puppy, and he was stand offish, but he was spoiled and loving. I felt safe emotionally and physically when he was with me. He never bit anyone, but he took time to warm up to a new person. He wouldn't just walk up to any stranger to let him pet him. He was a very high anxiety dog. He would also get nervous being in another person's care while we were gone which wasn't often, so I suggest getting that dog used to someone else caring for them too. He was well behaved, and constantly bark at the treat cabinet because he wanted treats. We had to put him down recently due to a spinal cord injury, but all he wanted to do was be with you, and be loved. We are planning on adopting from a rescue again because he was an amazing dog. I suggest looking at local shelters and meeting dogs to see what dog will fit best with your life style.
@6:27 it’s two dogs mike
A good rescue dog is a boxer dog from boxer love. I got my boxer named king from there
Getting puppy kisses is a blessing. Don't tell us how to live our life 🤣
I love that trend LET MEE DO IT FOR U!!!
My cat's are very chill. And yes, one of them sleeps in my bed. FIGHT ME! MY CAT IS ALLOWED! lol Mostly because his purr lulls me to sleep faster. One of them got fat, and is on a diet. Ya know, you see them every day, and sometimes don't notice the slight increase in weight until they sit in a certain position, and it's like "YOU ARE THE SIZE OF TWO CATS!"  But yeah, cats can be really chill.   If you think you can handle the loss, older cats in shelters need major love, and are often chill. They sadly sit in a cage for months, or a year, and then just get put to sleep because no one wanted them because "OLD". A terrible way to spend the last bit of one's life. Forgotten in a cage.
I love those big dogs had a neighbor who owned two dogs like this one after the other  both dogs would always run away and come to my house we lived right door to them.their dog just loved me  they called her Bear as well she was a huge Black Newfoundland very gentle and loved me to death the family would be so embarrassed she was always running to my house seeing this video made Remember this from my childhood the neighbors mom and  their was two boys that lived there  would say we should give her to you she seems to love you my parents laughed and said no my dad would not allow it .. Miss that dog she was so gentle after one passed away they got another they both did the same thing you can't make this up true story they're sweet dogs ..

Highly recommend Somerset Regional Animal Shelter. They have private areas to spend time with the dog, encourage you to bring your dog to visit first to see how they react to each other, have a high variance of breeds because they pull from kill shelters in the south, and they shouldn’t be too far for you.
Fun fact: Mythbusters proved both Jack and Rose could have floated on that door
DOG
❤️❤️❤️
When my family got our rescue dog we made sure to go to a place where we could sit in with the puppies so we knew which one was a good fit for our family. If you find one like that you will probably find a dog with your personality.
OMG STEVEN HE COMMENTED
Rescue dog from a shelter: Like some others said, meet and greets (outside of the kennels, usually in a play yard), just remember they are in a shelter environment for a long period of time and may take time settling in the home regardless of what you see. If someone interests you they should allow you to bring Bear to meet them, too, but shelters and rescues vary a ton in their processes.  Rescue dog from a "rescue" that has no location and is usually a hodgepodge of volunteers: most often require a home visit and in my area have always required both dogs to meet. Maybe see if any offer foster to adopt which gives the dog some time in your home to see if it's the right fit.
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
i feel like you're bear's golden retriever
For years I don't like sharing my food to  friends and family I don't want to be sick    Dear Doctor Mike.  is it a good idea to share stuff if someone is sick with the flu or any other viruses 🤔
Will Dr. Mike like and reply?
I have a chihuahua and a bull mastiff... how can I possibly look like both my dogs
Bear is so floofy!! He totally needs a cat friend!
Dude if you get a cat name It grizzly and call him grizzzzzzzzyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!

I would reach out to The Asher House. He has adopted so many dogs its crazy!
Somehow I ended up on the video you did on Mother's Day 5 years ago about your mother.  Such a beautiful story. Love you and Bear.  I never met Roxy, but beautiful dog.  I have a cat since I am not home a lot but she has helped me through some very rough times including the loss of my brother and my health declining (I have a chronic illness).  My cat was the only one around at times.  Bless you for caring about animals and people so much.  Love your bedside manner :)
pretty disappointed that youd use the term intrusive thoughts lightly like that. intrusive thoughts can be crushing. as a doctor you should know that its more than a trendy term. good to know social media is starting to influence you like that
I mean she told jack to not let go of her hand preventing him from finding another door/boat to climb on sooo… nah she still the reason he dies

Best way to find the best personality is fostering! It’s the best, after a few I found one that I couldn't let go, then another and another... At least you uh get to chose the personality you want ❤

Disliking this video for Bear
I can't really give advice on a rescue, because I've just been insanely lucky. I found a pup, seemingly abandoned, while doing a boundary survey on some undeveloped land. He couldn't have been more than a couple of months old, but he stayed at my heel all the way back to the work truck. That was in the spring of 2005, and he's currently asleep in the next room as I type this.
Mike has a Newfoundland, so he wouldn’t get it, but the meme (at 2:45) where it says “have you tried eating the couch?”, it’s a Labrador joke. Labradors constantly eat everything, including furniture, and it takes a lot of training just to calm it down, because you’ll never fully train them not to eat. They might stop eating house objects, but they’ll be outside and eat concrete, metal, tree stumps, rocks, dirt, etc. it’s just how they are.
Corgi and a chill dog should not exist in one sentence.
Steven he x Dr Mike  Possible colkab let's go
I fricken love everything about these videos XD
I wish I had a newfie but my grandma doesn’t like dogs that slobber a lot and ones are big and furry 😢
like the video
Okay first, Bear weighs more than I do and I'm 33 years old 😂Second, I had a very similar rant at the store today when I picked some delicious looking blueberry muffins then immediately put them back down when I saw that they were 320 calories each. So unfair 😩
I really love your videos
The first one reminds me of that one Garfield comic where all pets look like the owners
Let’s have a boat party!
😂 Actually your hair is kind of similar in texture with Bear.
A am all for crate training when used correctly and not to just store your dog but it is illegal to even have  a crate with a closable door where I live so sadly that tip isn't helpful to everyone (I do think out neighboring countries have the same laws as well) ^^"
Houston, we wayyy overshot the 300k like threshold.  Houston, we have a cat incoming.
My dog goes to sleep with me, takes almost the whole bed.......and she's a Chi-russ.
A few notes, Dr. Mike. Corgis can be chill or they can be terrors. It all depends on how much that herding instinct is in them. Of course since Newfs are working breeds as well, doing what you do with Bear will probably be enough to keep a corgi more towards the chill side. Rescues can work really well, but make sure you find a stable one. Introduce Bear and the new dog at the rescue make sure the two of them get along in a neutral territory before making a decision. One of the best ways would be to foster a rescue dog before making the decision to adopt. It’ll let you know how compatible the new dog would be.  And finally. My wife and I have a Pomsky (Pomeranian Husky mix) and she HATES the little husky joke. In her defense I use it when I can and since she can lose a couple pounds, I do regularly describe her as a little husky. (The dog, not my wife)
Oh a another furry! 0:19
I want the cat ❤️❤️❤️
I guess I’m a duck dog breed for liking Metallica ?
You get cat now, yes?!
Sill try to find a stray on the younger side. Bear will do the training for you.
I would like a "Day in the Life as Dr. Mike's Dog."  I will not mind if it's a 16 minute video where 12 minutes is of him lying around, 3 minutes of him eating, and 1 minute of him playing fetch. All content is good content.
I do ♥️ Bear! I have a 100lb Olde English Bulldogge named Oliver and he and Bear are so similar. I love to see Bear!!!!
What happened to your 3 legged husky?
I love to hear you want your next dog to be a rescue! Petfinder lets you filter by a bunch of different attributes and shows results from a lot of rescues and shelters. A lot of rescues will let you do a trial period before finalizing the adoption and often dogs from the south, where overpopulation is abundant, can be transported up north.
Super fluffy cat friend for bear! 💖
that dog is heavier than me
not to be a downer but dogs certainly do remember negative things, that's how you get dogs with anxiety - my eskie apparently had a very traumatic experience with someone picking up a dog because she completely freaks out when we pick up any of our dogs and she will pee if we don't pick her up exactly the right way. the marvelous thing is how quickly they can forgive people despite even the most horrific abuse.
Edit : my dogs name is bear as well by the way! - I spoiled my dog way to much as a first time puppy owner he slept in my bed. He now lays on my face on my bed every night if I don’t let him up he whines and barks. I didn’t really crate train him… he knows basic commands like sit and paw and stuff but ya he has no personal space boundaries and he now had claimed me and my bed. If someone hugs me or pulls me or drags me he nibbles them and gets in between them and my bed has a ramp for him that I can’t move without him looking like he’s gonna kill me 😂❤😅
Corgis are not chill dogs!
I’m bouta die ( 4:26 )
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
about the rescue question: Aren't you in NYC? The ASPCA and bid-a-wee are there. And I know there have to be more rescues. There's also people that will transport animals across the country in case there aren't any local.
:)
GET HIM A PET CAT OMG OMG OMG
Bear's hair!!! and playing with it so it sticks straight up. I can't stop giggling it's to cute. reminds me of a cockatoo😍😂
Best Dr.Mike video EVER!
Love you Dr Mike & cute little Bear  🐕❤😊✨
Should of said BEE-WOOF, such a missed opportunity!
Ok, The Mom In Me Came Out When I Saw You Petting Bear And Getting Fur Or Whatever Off Your Hand and Throwing It Behind The Couch...You Probably Have Cleaning People, But When You Were Younger, MOM Picked Up That Bad Habit lol...Luv Watching you Dr Mike, Keep Up The Good Work!
Imagine a chill a$$ cat and Bear being chill and them being best friends. Oh. My. Gosh. Best friendship ever. So many people love cats and they need rescuing so bad 🥺😢🥹😢🥹😥🥹😢🥹🥺😢🥹😥

For adopting another dog or cat, if you’re going the rescue route here’s a few suggestions. Look up different rescues or even sanctuaries (some sanctuaries also adopt out) in and around your area, see what people say about them, what they do, if they put down over 90% of their animals like PETA does (run). If you’re looking for a particular breed, many times there are rescues/sanctuaries that are dedicated to one specific breed. If you fall in love with a dog that maybe doesn’t live that close to you, you can always make a day of it and make it a trip as well as going to adopt but there’s also people who will fly or drive your new friend home to you. You might need to pay something at least to cover gas costs, etc. Ask yourself what kind of dog would fit your and your dog’s lifestyle. Bear looks like a chill dog so probably not something super hyper and active, a dog that doesn’t bark every 2 seconds, or a very vocal cat, etc. You can ask about trial adoptions or foster to adopt so that you have a while to decide if this new pet will fit in with Bear. Make sure the animal comes with medical records; proof of testing, shots, a rabies certificate (if they’re above a certain age). Both cats and dogs usually have shots required by the state you live in so look that up.  Get your new friend vetted by a licensed veterinarian ASAP. Get the full blood work up especially testing for common and communicable diseases, stool analysis to check for worms and other parasites, a full physical to make sure skin and fur is free of fleas, ticks, mange, ringworm, etc, check the teeth see if any dental needs to happen. Keep your new pet in quarantine for at least a few days. The stress of being brought to a new home can lower the immune system of the new pet and make it more likely that they can acquire URI, UTI, or a cough and you don’t want to spread that. Also Bear can stress as well and the same thing can happen where he can give something to the new pet. You know there’s a bigger chance of spreading infection dog to dog then cat to dog or dog to cat.
My dog is considered a sub woofer
"Do they make brown cats" WHAT DO YOU THINK WHO MAKES CATS THEY SPAWN IN VILLAGES
My cat has a hamster because he has an actual Mega Heart, He has 5 chambers and is a meowing miracle. So when my first hamster passed my cat wasn't doing well, so we bought a hamster for him, and his health started to get better 🤷🏻😅. If Bear shows he is lonely when you aren't there, a friend would be beneficial. Fergus and Nugget are Never face to face in person but they paw at each other with a plastic wall between them 😂, it is funny but Ferg Stops Every time I try to catch them on video 😂.
By age 30 I have anxiety, 3 dogs, and a cat with a diagnosed anxiety disorder couple with medication she refuses to take, which is regularly increasing both our levels of anxiety. It’s just grand. 💀🙃
I would suggest fostering to see if you like the dog before adopting
Dr Mike with that Friends reference woohoo😊
Crate training never works for my husky/boxer mix. She ate the crate, then proceeded to eat the couch. We put my german Shepard in there now
The fact that Bear can give Dr. Mike a high five without expecting a reward, meanwhile I give my dogs a high five and they won't stand more than 3 feet away from me till I give them a treat  😂
Someone please play this man some Journey.
So I’ve had that Thor Michaelson meme for a really long time and that’s what I whip out whenever anyone starts talking politics 😂
I have a Mini Dachshund, She is a small dog but She takes up more space on the bed than She needs. 😆
I have a dog named bear and it is the same breed😮 0:23
Bear's hair sticking up kind of makes him look like Mike
But when are you getting a cat?
my friend's dog is 180 pounds...
Opp that is Wong sorry
Solo bass video will u get a cat I have 5but  still love doggos
Coming from someone who grew up with rescues, and has three of my own, 2 german shepherds and a beagle, they are hands down the BEST dogs I've ever had. My biggest thing with rescues is to meet them outside of the pound, humane society, or wherever you're looking cause their personalities change DRASTICALLY when they're in a stressful situation like that.
OMG I think I need chest compressions Mike actually said "at 300k I will consider getting bear a cat friend,that looks just like him, a brown cat." But why I'm laughing so much I can't breathe is cuz at 4:14 right after he said "do they make brown cats??" Like cats are manufactured toys that are made by machines or something 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cat? when u have 68k RN
OMG  I have a brown winier 🐶  BEAR is sooooo cute🐻
My neighbour used to have a newf they are truly gentle giants
AH!! Thor Michelson is my friend's dog! He has a campaign video too!

borzoi kermie meme is currently my fave meme out there atm. Glad it's here
"I want a chill dog," he says, about a literal herding breed...I love corgis but I have NEVER met a chill one.
"Not the intrusive thoughts Mike" OMG I died🤣🤣🤣
Me when I was looking at the thumbnail  Let me do it for you
Oh you need a cat to match bear
You could probably just sub the chicken nuggets for a healthier substitute  Something like actual chicken, or vegetables, or a mix of both  Just had to be the same size and amount
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BEAR!
Just Get a brown cat
Well considering Mike is 6'3 I would say yes, both him and bear are gentle giants and that's definitely not a coincidence
To make getting a new dog go more smoothly-- don't trust a shelter or rescue that won't help do a dog intro before you adopt! Generally when I'm helping a client add a new dog to the family, I look for a girl to live with a boy and vice versa first. If the dogs at a specific shelter get to participate in play groups or group walks, asking about how the dog you're interested in has done with other large males in those settings is going to be important: if they don't play with other big dogs or they won't answer you, persist or talk to training and enrichment staff. I'm happy to talk specifics in DMs when the time comes too!
Bear is such a 'go with the flow' type of pupper
Owners do not look like their dogs; it's the same as telling someone their baby 'looks just like them,' but it's not true. Mark Rober found that people cannot recognize their babies in a lineup. You should tell someone, 'your baby looks just like you; ugly, ruffled face, covered in slobber, weird skin, undefined features, and deformed proportions.' Reiterating; people do not look like their dogs. Also, our dog is a rescue, and I don't know if it's because he's a rescue, but he's a monster. I kinda think he's just a monster and it has nothing to do with the fact that he's a rescue. We can't have anyone over without crating him, we can't take him out into public because he will try to attack people (especially kids), and he is a psychopath when we're trying to walk him. A lot of my family thinks he was abused, but I disagree, he doesn't seem to fear people, he just bullies the people he perceives to be weak.
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO HIT YOU, "DOWN BELOW"!!!
I love Bear so much
Okay if your gonna get a cat try to get a Norwegian Forest cat, they are the floofiest cat and get along with dogs
Thank you for confirming that bear is in fact the bestest boy
like this *PEWOOP* now
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE please please PLEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSS-uh...get Bear a brown cat that looks just like him!!! They still make them.

This is so cute I dropped my phone
Aww Dr. Mike, next time you can't sleep just tap me and roll me over. I'm here for ya Dude. 👍🏾😉👍🏾
This video is so wholesome. I just lost my dog, Griz, recently. He was the most loving guy ever. Seeing you and bear makes me think of him. the best boy!
Anyone curious what he dropped behind the couch? No judgement of course, I don’t even wanna know what’s behind my couch.
70$ for a hoodie?! It better be good

My dog used to weigh 45 kg before we got him he was dumped and my local kennels he is now a healthy weight for a bordacouly btw he is 13 and he runs round like a 3 yr old
I'm a simple person. I see Bear, I click.
Mike: "Bear, you're an explosive dog, you have explosive diarrhea." Bear: "Why you tell them, dad?"
"Do you think i look like bear?"  IF you mean cute and adorable then yes Mike 😇
I'm not at all surprised that a Russian man has a Bear for a pet

I want bear to sleep on my lap too :')
Get Mike a cat
OMG! LIKE THIS PEOPLE.   BEAR NEEDS KITTY!!!!! HURRY!
I vote for kitten!!!!!❤
My girl is a rescue from abuse. Hardest bond I've ever had to make, took roughly 6 months. But now its the strongest bond I've ever had and I know she's my once in a lifetime. Its not about looking for a certain breed in rescue facilities, it's about looking for a certain dog. The dog that will give you its entire life
Dose bear ever bark at thunder or fire works my dogs do all the time
brown cats are stunning!!!
Okay so like  left eye like right beside my eyelashes it hurts when I blink
I can relate to the comment about the dog vomit alarm clock. I don’t have a dog, but I have cats and let me tell you… my older cat likes to puke up his food  after he eats it so stinking fast. The sound of him gagging/ puking will wake me right up out of my sleep. I’m out of my bed so quickly. He tends to puke on carpeted areas and not the floors that are easier to clean.. not a fun time. Lol
Newfies are such great dogs. We got ours specifically because of how good they are with kids. She also scares the hell out of people that don't know how sweet Newfies are. She is also a great protector of the kids. She is always calm around other dogs. She just ignores them...except for the one time a middle sized dog nipped at my son. She ran over and flipped him a good 5 feet in the air.
10:40 Tip: A lot of rescue organizations have questionnaires about your lifestyle and personality to match you with the best dog for you. Look for a local shelter that does that.

this is so wholesome lol
it's Bear's spiked top hair sticking straight up for me.
BTW mythbusters proved that Jack could've easily fit on the wood and they both could've survived
Why yes they do "make" brown cats😉. Havana browns
You 🤔 you want a rescue?  Try fostering doggos.  Then find one you like and adopt it.
My dog is better then your dog she is a German Shepherd named Patches
Bear is so cute 🤗
Can i see bear’s crate? 🤣 i can only imagine the size of it
Can someone please tell me why at 0:10 Bear looks like the grinch to me 😭😂
Corgis are the BEST!!!!
Awesome video man, Glad to have stumbled across this channel!! Keep up the great work.
Yes you look like your dog. Very sweet though.
It would be awesome to see you do a collaboration video with Girl With Dogs.  Bear would be an awesome grooming candidate 🐶🐻
He’s the gooddest boi ever ☺️ what a sweetheart. Makes me happy for the day I have my own wonderful woofer
my dog’s name is heartleigh, but one of my most common nicknames for her is wubbo. sometimes if she does a really nasty fart i’ll call her fartleigh
You and Bear have similar personalities. You and Roxy look more alike 😅😅😅
Bear weighs as much as I do
7:23 he have that😳
It's a Saluqi
So cute bear
The best way to get a rescue dog who matches your personality is to find a local rescue & chat with them! Most folks who work with rescue dogs are super eager to help you find just the dog you're looking for. You can also try a foster-to-adopt situation where you take a dog into your home for a little while & if Bear doesn't vibe with them they can get adopted & if Bear really likes them they stay forever. PS - If you really want, you could time how long it would take Bear to eat 500 nuggets by timing him eating a couple nuggets & then multiplying the time.
There are brown cats.. But from what i've heard they are rare
you should definetly get a cat
I have a doxie and he is one of the best! 🥰
Doctor Mike! I LOVE YOUR DOG! 😍❤️
he wants a female version of him.
Bear is only 130? My dog weighs 165, I knew my doggo was bigger! Loki is the best flooffer.
bear is so cute!!!!
That's a big beqr
Mythbusters actually tested the Titanic door thing. They would've both survived if one of them tied their life jacket to the bottom to keep the buoyancy. But when you're adrenaline is rushing and you're trying not to drown or freeze to death, it's pretty hard to think straight.
With a rescue cat you have to let it sniff your hand. If catso gives you a headbutt, he loves you
My dog is a Caucasian Shephard/black lab mix so he's naturally agressive. He will either attack them or want pets.
Hey, Doctor Mike, I DARE you to react to a youtuber named “Josh Neuman.”
When my dog would go into an elevator, he would only stare at the floor when it started to move😂
I wanna cuddle too!!
Why does Bear almost ALWAYS look tired or depressed lol
Again, bears tuff on his head just kills me🤣 he has the BEST hair do - I needed this one today❤😂

Yes you look like bear, he’s a handsome boi
Bear and I weigh the same😂😂🤎
That dog with the "snow copy" is definitely a Borzoi/Russian wolfhound. Seeing all the Borzoi meme's recently.. As much as I love them they're also kind of breaking my at the moment, because I had to let my Borzoi  Aristo pass the rainbow bridge a few weeks ago due to cancer. I miss him so much <3
No wonder his name’s bear! He’s exactly like a bear! The color, the size is just perfect!❤ also like so he can get a cat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love that song, "Don't Stop Believin" by Journey!

Is it usual for someone when they get tired there pupils to get wider like really wide where it takes up your whole eye cause that happens to me all the time
Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Wellington FL!!! amazing place to get a rescue!
Let’s get him a demon cat for his angel dog.
More videos with Bear! I cant be the only one who wants to see him more 😍 Such a good boy ❤️
As a corgi owner.  I can contest they are not chill dogs. Great dogs, not chill .
my dad trained my dog with rewards only no crates no yelling and he is a very good boy no couch eating (though a bit of bed eating at first)
Mike: do they **make** brown cats? No we do not make brown cats but we have been thinking of coloring our felines brown.
Get BEAR a CAT!!!
Such a baby bark for a large dog!!!! <3
Regarding finding a rescue dog that matches your personality, my tip is to try fostering dogs. They can live with you for a few weeks until they get adopted, or you might decide to adopt them first! It's a great way to test things out before committing, and it's how I found my perfect little fuzzy buddy.
About Titanc: He tried to get on, but the board wouldn't hold both of them, so he got off. It is shown in the movie.
0:22 Somehow Dr. Mike didn't get that was just a casual furry? Sure my fursona is pretty similar to a tundra wolf, however anyone can make their own whether it's realistic or cartoony. I have to say, I haven't seen many poodle fursuits recently, interesting choice. Regardless, have a good rest of your day.
If you want some painful stuff, look up the old MTV show Scarred.
This was sooooo wholesome! I loved it
I…want…bear.  Give me the baby.  (jk, but he is a ball of fluffy adorkable cuteness…aaaaaaah)
I am a very simple person. I see Bear, I click.
Burmese cats are brown!  I used to have one.  Her name was Chocolate.  Same color as Bear!
you I love the vids keep it up and in the summer here in Ohio Im getting a new pair like bear and naming him bear But
That Chihuahua-Blueberry Muffin Meme is spot on. I have a Chihuahua-Beagle mix & when she's snuggling on the couch wrapped in her blankie she looks EXACTLY like a blueberry muffin! However, because of her tan color, when she curls up in a circle she looks like a bagel!!!
Every time I see a borzoi now on TikTok or anything I’m forever traumatized by the “let me do it for you”. I know it’s gonna play or pop in my head fml.
The TikTok trend caught me off guard 😂
I'm commenting to encourage the algorithm to give bear a brown cat
11:09 Wanna know what *actually* woulda made for an interesting discussion? If he tried to come on and she just pushed his head under water to stop him. Like, it would be incredibly messed up and cynical, but I'd probably get a laugh out of it.
I have a rescue dog and I got her by fostering several dogs until I found one that had the personality that I was looking for.
9:21 Was this one specifically done after what you just said or was it a just a coincidence lol?
GUYS LIKE THIS VIDEO RN SO HE CAN GET THE CAT TOO
2:30 10:30  Wow!!It's my friend's Borzoi!!🇯🇵 She is pure bread😂
How heavy was the door compared to jack and rose's BMI combined?
Dr. Mike: "Do I look like Bear?" *watches Dr. Mike's hair slowly match the style of Bear's fur over the course of the video*
Anyone else watching this vid with their dogs??
Dogs do remember the negative, especially when they’ve been abused. They become scared and anxious. They have great memories of good and bad experiences. They are sentient creatures with more intelligence than we give them credit for.
I love my 2 dogs (border collie and an Australian Kelpie cross) though I'm pretty sure I have the stupidest border collie 😅 had to tell him MULTIPLE times yesterday to NOT drink the salt water at the beach!! He is 8, we go to the beach nearly every weekend, I've had to do this his whole life 🤣🤣 he is so stupid but OMG so sweet!! My Kelpie is judgemental AF and way too smart 😅
Rescue dogs from a foster based rescue - they can provide a much better personality match
Does Bear remind anyone else of Sumo from Detroit: become human?
Omg.. Borzoi!!! It's RUSSIAN!!! lol They're such majestic dog. Needs to be seen in real life in motion, for full effect.
This is soooo good. I actually watched it with my dog laying on my lap 😂
@Doctor Mike I've had shelter dogs my entire life & they're the best kind of dog....best thing to do is just go to the shelter or petsmart adoption center & you'll just automatically vibe with one or multiple dogs then do a meet & greet with just yourself & the shelter dog then another meet & greet with Bear & you & the shelter dog
Guys Like the Video! I want to see Bear have another friend! (or enemy?)
"We just weighed him in at 130 the other day"  Me, a 128 lbs teenager who thought that dogs only got bigger and heavier than you if they were Great Danes or something
Yes Cat! Senior, adopted and potty trained tho. Bear doesn’t seem like he’d eat her and both would enjoy the cuddles. 😽😸
Okay first he knows not to get off the elevator because he reads your body language. Dogs are incredible when it comes to reading body language.  Next if you really want to adopt a dog but aren't sure if it will fit your lifestyle you can always ask questions. When it comes to shelter dogs questions are your best friend. Ask the staff to give you as much info as they can on that dog. Why was it released to them? How does it usually act? How does it outside? Inside? And get to know the dog too. Talk to them, play with them, and spend more than just five minutes with them and remember that the way your shelter dog acts the first few weeks is not always how they will act. Give then time
I have a rescue dog who is the dorky dog ever. Rescues can be very traumatized but they can also be almost indistinguishable. Choose a rescue dog like you choose a friend, if they literally say "I love you," their the right one.
Bear is so cute! We have huge dogs and from bear, I want a Newfoundland as well❤😂😊
I love your videos Doctor Mike  The type of cat your looking at is a Havana Brown it's the only breed with a solid brown coat
Time for a cat😏
Depending on the rescue, since it takes a while for dogs to et acclimated to a new environment and need to decompress from the stress of the rescue/changing environments (and how unsettling and unstable that might feel), sometimes they will give you 2 weeks to see if the dog is a fit. 3 months is usually the time within which they really blossom and open up fully.
the borzoi
I had a corgi mix and I considered getting her a Newf, but she was an old lady set in her ways! And she was absolutely the kind of corgi that gave the judging side eye.
Dr. Mike, the trick I and my family have always used when getting a pet from a shelter is let the pet come to you! Walk around and look at them all and whichever one seems the most interested in you, ask to have one on one time with them. If they still only want you, like they seek out your attention, want pets, are just all over you then chances are you're meant to have that pet. At least that's how it's worked out for us, been doing it all 40 of my years and I have yet to have a pet that hasn't meshed 100% with my family^^  Also! Introduce Bear to the new pet on neutral ground and bring them into your home together. Bear is a sweetheart but you don't want accidental territoriality to kick in^^
I think you're allowed to talk to your pets about a patient.  Unless you're a vet. 💚🐇🐴💚
I WANT HIM TO GET A CAT 😺

Bear? A dog? Bear is a dog? I don’t think sooooo
Newfie...new wife? Doctor Mike is a 'furry'? 😂
Can you also handle some light veterinarian work since you really are an actual Doctor and don't just play one on Youtube? (i had to look up the correct spelling for veterinarian)
Villalobos rescue. They have pitties and sometimes they have dogs other than Pitbulls. But they try and match the dog that fits with you and your lifestyle. Great people. They help out parolees and the pitbulls! They even had a TV show, now a youtube series I think, called Pitbulls and Parolees.
Hey- could you share the breeder you used! thx & best from Colo
When we had a doggy door our Maltese would stand in the middle of it, head outside booty inside 🤣
It's so funny when dogs are afraid of vaccuums. I vaccuum the couch around my cats, with the loudest attatchment (the one for upholstery is loud) 🤷‍♀️
Most dog rescuers ask you stuff and cater to your needs :) There are however (sadly) some which are really "clicky" and cold-shoulder anyone who doesn't fit their "click" regardless if that person is perfect for rehoming a dog they have, with no regard for helping more dogs in the process. There are others which just exist for milking donation money - you know quickly who those are because they'll be background checking you for money and not just things like any criminal records with animals, how suitable your property/lifestyle is etc. It's understandable to be concerned someone may or may not be able to financially support a dog in the future, but its painfully obvious on their faces when you ask them how many animals they've rehomed in the last month and when you find out they have a hundred dogs in the back just sitting there to shake change from bleeding hearts. Run far, run fast - because these people even if you have the stamina/patience required to rehabilitate one and wrench a poor dog that's been distressed in a kennel for months on end, they will be pestering you for donations with guilt pics and videos forever!
If you truly want a cat, see if you can take Bear with you when choosing. Cats like to be in charge, and our dogs know and respect that (we have two of both dogs and cats). Bear seems real chill, he may accept a cat in charge. Our older dog took a little convincing, but now-a-days all get along fine. I would suggest you let them make friends under observation. A chill cat like Bear would be best, but you can never truly tell with a rescue what they are going to be like.
When I got my dog from a rescue they let me “foster” her for a week before officially adopting her , which definitely let me see how much of an adjustment I would have to make in my life to add her into my daily routines that I had established before finding her.

Dr mike I have a pittbull that barks like yours
I'm 100% okay with my doctor telling her dog about me lol.
Get the cat     And yes, there are brown cats. Just look at every villain in Warriors.
You could consider villalobos. They work to get a dog that fits you
Bear is a 10/10 floof, I would absolutely let him slobber on me, I would also bop the snoot and give kisses
You'd better get Bear a cat twin. You've hit the 300,000 bark.
The editing was 10/10 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 as usual
I was on BP meds, last March I got a puppy, by the fall my BP was so low that my Dr took me off all BP meds.
Day 43 of asking doctor mike to react to big city green episodes and injuries
I have a long haired black/brown kitty named Wolfie that would basically be the cat equivalent of Bear. She's the sweetest floof ❤️🐈‍⬛
my dogs aren't in crates they never eat the couch we raised them to treat the house as their den and that it will make us sad if they destroy things. also always having a older dog to teach the younger one helps haha
its Borzoi
Oh my sweet summer child....  Corgi is NOT a chill dog. Pretty well the entire herding group is not chill. That thing would herd Bear around the house
hello bear😍😍😍
Cuuuute !! 🥰
DIDNT I DO IT FRYOUUUUUUU??????
thank you for this video I just lost a person I cared about today and it make's me happy that you're reacting to dog meme's this made my day
How we got our rescue dog is my mom was gardening a dog ran up to her and showed his belly like saying GIVE ME BELLY RUBS
I think you need this today 🫂
„I have a dog with anxiety“ BEAR: most chilled face 😂
Hate to break it to you doctor, corgis are NOT lazy. They're bred to herd cows! My corgi can run circles around any other dog I've ever had. But they are the Goodest Bois.
I want my dog to meet and be friends with Bear. They'd be so cute!
@doctor Mike (nuggets) you could test it pretty safely if you make the nuggets by yourself with an air fryer, only chicken breast and not so many salt and spices.
my family has always adopted rescues from shelters and I think the biggest & most important thing is to meet & spend time with the animal you're considering adopting. you'll get a chance to see their personality and it also gives them a chance to see yours. you should always talk to the staff & volunteers at a shelter too - they know the animal's history & where they came from and they also tend to know their personalities very well too since they work with them so much. I don't know if every shelter does this, but a lot of shelters in my area offer meet & greets if you already have a pet, so your current pet can meet whoever you're thinking about adopting. if a shelter offers it, I highly suggest taking advantage of it, but at the same time if they don't immediately get along it isn't the end of the world. sometimes they just get off on the wrong paw, and sometimes it really isn't going to work, so you need to pay attention & know the animals well I also highly encourage adopting an adult or a disabled animal. a lot of people tend to go for the patterned or healthy looking animals or the young energetic ones, and the elders & the disabled animals get left behind and end up spending way more time in the shelter. sometimes a disabled pet can be a lot of work depending on what their disability is, but it's very fulfilling and it's already hard enough for them to find a loving home as is. I have a cat who is missing an eye - there was a tiny bit of extra care we had to do when we first adopted him since he was still healing from surgery, but it was really only making sure the area stayed clean and taking him for his follow ups. adult or elderly animals are also still a great pet, some do have health issues or more medical care due to age but just like disabled pets they are still an amazing companion. rescued pets can always tell when you've saved them, and even though they can sometimes act a little crazy lol (like every pet), rescues always know you love them & they show their gratitude & love you right back. it's incredibly fulfilling and you save some amazing lives that way
Great video!
You passed 300,000 and yes...cats come in brown!
Dr Mike looks so much like McDreamy from greys anatomy
dogs are probably the best thing ever, i suffer with mental health issues and my dog gives me reasons to go out and explore the world, ive had my got since he was around 6-8 weeks old he now turns 13 this year <3
I sometimes feel sharp pain near my heart and lungs and it has been stoping me playing with my friends so I would like your opinion.
I have never been so excited for someone else to get a cat.
The more I saw these videos, the closer I get to adopting one!
More Bear please.

Does Bear also have troll hair!? Mine does!
Luar biasa kawanku sangat menarik dan keren banget 🤩🤩❤️❤️👍👍

I worked at a shelter in college and have owned rescue dogs my whole life. My advice would be to find a reputable rescue near you and have a chat with their adoption coordinator (some shelters don't always have the resources to have this position, but most rescues do). They match the dog to the lifestyle and housing situation, and if they don't have a dog to meet your specific needs then most will keep your information and give you a call when a potential new match comes in. Or if you have time, volunteer at a shelter and spend time with the dogs.
Aahhhh.... Just watched your old clip with puppy Bear.... You were just a pup then as well❣️
there are breed specific rescues if you are looking for a specific breed. to make sure you match well with your rescue pup, talk with rescues/shelters and see if they have anyone fostering dogs to see what they are like. the shelter said my rescue shiba inu might misbehave given his past (he spent the first 3 years and 11 months in a puppy mill, then was dumped at the shelter i rescued him from) but he is just a really good boy and is just happy to be with his hooman. :)
Oh, he’s totally getting cat lol
There are brown cats, but that are rare
❤
Well... If you want a rescue, there's Territorio de Zaguates. It comes with the perk of being in Costa Rica, so it would be another reason to come by.
Ok Dr.Mike this is why I’m subscribed to you! 😊 Quality content! 🐕
Jack saying "it can't hold both of us", her offering & him refusing would have been more believable but with how much trouble she'd already caused it just made her look like a jerk
*TIPS for finding a dog that matches your personality*  PERFECT place is a shelter! I'd recommend no-kill shelters only tbh because I wouldn't want to support killing animals. It's bittersweet but true, so find some local no-kills near you and they usually let you take them out for a walk, some have a playpen to play with them or even meet your own dog! You can find puppies, adults, or senior dogs. They have them in all types so it's best to check frequently! Some even have websites to check their looks and personality. Then you can go meet them in real life and take them out for a test-run. Rescue dogs need no qualifications, which means their possibilities are limitless! Just make sure to grab the one you feel connected with most before someone else does. You can ALSO find cats that are good with dogs there! Rare, but possible.  I hope you read this and that it helped you because I really love your videos and you've rekindled my love of biomedical science and help keep it alive, fun, and educated! Bear is such a perfect name for a big floof btw ❤️
Don't go there mike 😳
“He’ll break the chair he’s too heavy for that” me knowing I’m 130lb………..🥲
Newfoulanders woooooooo
Okay but how many of us can see the words "Jurassic Bark" without ugly sobbing at this point?
I have a Borzoi like the one in the meme. His name is Frost and he (like all Borzois) is a giant furry greyhound. He is tall enough that when both of us are standing, I (at my modest height of 5’3”) can look down, and he can look up and lick my nose. He still thinks he’s a lap dog and will flop on me if I let him.
I have no real advice on finding a rescue that matches your personality. I just know the 2 rescue dogs I’ve gotten in the past - I went to my local humane society and I stopped at each cage and each time there was one cage I just kept going back to. I just knew. And both were perfect fits in my life
I could really need a daily dose of Bear cuddles. He just looks like a giant floofy sweetheart ❣️
OMG! Yes, the throwing up! It sounds just like a clogged drain is about to explode 😆 It wakes me up no matter what time of night it is 🙃 My Mia used to eat stuff of the ground when she was a puppy and throw up but we don't have that problem anymore 😃  What a fun video you guys are so cute❣️ And love the fact you're a big Friends fan! I watched them all again during the lockdowns. Comedy kept me sane.  Lots of love from Slovenia 😘
Your dog is skinny compared to my dog my English mastiff is 180 and the vet tells us every time that she is underweight
There is a breed of brown cat that literally looks like a chocolate cat. It is called the Havana Brown
I have a Husky who doesn't quite understand fetch. Either he just stares at it as you throw it or he takes it and won't give it back😂
EVERYONE LIKE THE VIDEO SO MIKE CAN GET A CAT FOR BEAR
To answer the question about titanic   Rose would be way too selfless to throw the other person off the door. She would absolutely go into the water to save both jack and that other person. This is also expressed throughout the movie where it shows her being compassionate, guiding people, etc. In the movie there's a child that she goes back for because the door the child is next too is about to explode with water. Like, putting herself and Jack at risk to save another person.
I rescued my dog about 3 years ago. The trick to finding the right dog is by age size and history. So if you want a chill dog get an older dog, maybe 4 or 5 but if you want an active dog get a younger one. In the beginning of living with a rescue dog it seems like they are not cut out for you but you just have to keep giving them love and soon it’ll feel like you’ve always had them. Glad your looking to rescue rather then buy! Good luck

LIKE FOR DA BEAR CAT
Dog adoption groups often have "adoption days" at  pet stores.  Look for those like at Petsmart, Petco, etc.  You get to visit with the dogs (and make sure to bring Bear along so he can visit, too) and if you find a dog that really vibes with you, you can fill out an application to adopt the dog.    However, you want to check with the organization because some require certain things at your home in order to adopt a dog.  You can also check with your local animal shelter and see what is required.  Some shelters have places where you can visit with the dogs and even bring your current dog to see if they get along.
"do they make brown cats?" Doctor Mike 2023
bear is the closest thing a human can hug that isn't a bear
I have a rescue, he's a mutt and very cuddly and chill, before getting him, my family and i looked for rescue dogs and honestly, you know when you know, it just clicks and feels right, like a missing piece you finally found.
My mom loomed over me while I was watching.   “Is that a dog?”  “Yes”  “Is that his dog?”  “Yes”   “Is he a doctor?”  “Yes”   “Oh, so he’s a vet…”  “No”
Omg please get a pet cat. My sister has a  floofy newfy and he (Sultana aka Sully) LOVES his cat brother and sister!
I got 5 dogs. They bark. Bark. Bark. Bark. Bark. And they're funny
I have a brown cat, so yes
Bear just be like I want to sleepppp
yes 136k likes kitty is coming soon
if you witness a dogfight, leave the airspace
Mike looks like Bear
This was much needed. Please do a follow up!  Personal opinion (from working in a vet's office): Corgis are not an overly chill breed. They are funny, fun, smart, and super cute but they are very stubborn and can be drama llamas. They definitely aren't nearly as laid back as Bear/Newfies.
A greyhound is a chill dog you could get
These are all so cute! Bear is adorable as always! If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
Doc : wants high five Dog : peace was never a option
About rescue dogs, i talked to the nearest animal protection organization and basically let them choose. I don't know if there's anything like that in the US, but here in Germany you can say you want a "testphase"...i don't know how to describe it better. You get a dog and take care of him for a few weeks or months (either because they're out of space for dogs or other reasons) and then give him back or keep him. Please don't ask for details, i really don't know how to describe it better 😅 Anyhow, i talked to them and they said they're getting a german sheperd mix soon and i will get him. Right on the day where i should get him they called me a few hours prior and said if i mind getting a different dog. Since i "just" wanted to test if it works out with a dog i said sure. And with that i got my soulmate Ronja, a mix of different breeds, very probably including a wolf, originally from Romania where she lived on the streets for about 2-3 years. I had wonderful 12 years with her but sadly she passed away 2 months ago 😢  Long story short, let your heart and fate decide ❤
Bear is unacceptably cute
Omg everybody like it so Mike has to get a cat!!!!!
I’m Newfie, I wonder how you ended up with a Newfie dog.
Can you do a medical revoew of all quiet on the western front

9:31 I am currently 19 and I have all 3. Most ppl get dogs for their anxiety, my dog got ppl for hers.
WHAT BREED IS THAT DOG I NEED IT ITS SO BIGGGG
For me, I run when one of my animals throws up 1. To make sure they throw up on the floor and not a rug or bed and 2. Because my husky will puke and then immediately try to eat it or the cat throws up and my husky will try to eat it... 🤦🏽‍♀️
can we get more medical content nowadays? it's why I originally subscribed
like the video i need to see that cat
Love you mike!
Tipps for the shelter dog: I work at a shelter in Germany but at least with us it works like this; you tell us a bit about your life/circumstances, what kind of dog you’re looking for personality/energy wise and a bit about bear and type of dogs he already has as friends. We’d then give a few suggestions of dogs we think might be a good match which, first you alone, and later with bear can meet. Once we all(you, bear, the dog in question, and us )are feeling confident that this is the dog for you the adoption can take place ✌🏻
Bear needs a cat!!
I would love to see bear with a  cat friend lol sounds...fun. <3333
The Borzoi memeeeeeeeeee
“Do they make brown cats?”
GREYHOUND. A rescue greyhound would be good. They are VERY chill dogs in real life situations and would get along with Bear very well.
❤
You and Bear are the best pair. Enjoy seeing you two hanging out.
They do "make" brown cats 😂They're just very very rare. Also, corgis are an athletic work dog. They're cattle dog, don't let their bunz fool you, it takes a lot to properly tire them out. This said, you come from a husky, so yeah, in that regard corgis are chlll as they don't need to be exhausted to settle down. As for elevators, they know what they are for if you are low enough than you can take the stairs. I walk a golden that lives on the second floor, and when I make him take the stairs he tries to get into the elevator until I convince him, but still looks me at me with reproach. And bear doesn't get down on the wrong floors cause he knows the smell of the right one 😉
I got my dog at a local pet shelter that I found through the power of Facebook. The day I looked them, they were having an adoption event at the local mall. So I went there and played with the puppies and after just a few minutes a fell in love with a little girl pup named Emmy. Most of the time you can schedule appointments to have meet and greet with the dogs. They will give you some time to play with them. On the adoption application there is usually a place to write down what you are looking for in a dog. Also if you tell them what your personality is like they will match you with dogs that fit you. Most shelters especially the ones I’ve been to, try to make it as personal of an experience as possible. I love my rescue! She is the best dog I’ve ever had! Bear did such a great job in this video! He was so calm. Thank you for this video! I needed to laugh!
Like the video every likes counts
I have a Saint Bernard named Moose! Giant breeds are the best! The most snuggly❤️❤️❤️
Adding a like because i would anyway.  But also you need to suffer with me with cats.  I have a dog, then my wife came home with two cats.  And then 6 months later a 3'rd.  Im allergic to cats.  😔    Hope everyone is staying safe, and taking care.
Anyone else questioning what breed bear is?
It is very easy to find rescue dogs that match your personality you just have to look for them.
So, now when I am wathcing this, there are more than 350 t. views. So as a to be new cat owner, witch one you are thinking, siberian forestcat or savannah?
Would love to see more of Bear, such a great dog!
Dr Mike: do they make brown cats?
Definitely rescue! There are so many dogs and cats that need homes but they just need someone like you to give them a chance. There are some really great rescue groups that will work with you to match the right dog for you. Some even have programs where they will foster to adopt so you can try to see if it’s a good match before you sign the paperwork. For my last few dogs, they were the ones who chose me. As cheesy as it sounds, it’s true. I went to the shelter thinking I had the perfect one in mind, but ended up falling in love with someone different. I won’t sugarcoat, it was difficult in the beginning because the dogs didn’t know what it was like to be in a home before and they’ve been let down by so many people. But I worked with a great trainer and it’s been a wonderful journey ever since. There’s something magical that happens when you rescue and in my opinion, they tend to love you more than one from a breeder. I think it’s because they know you literally saved their life, so they want to help you live your best one.
JACK TRIED TO GET ONTO THE DOOR, AND IT SANK! I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL! I'm really glad to hear James Cameron weighed in, lol. Also, Bear is a whole mood <3
I dunno about you guys, but Bear looks good in a Mohawk.

This is strange but my dog loves the vacuum. She’s a blue nose pit and every time we turn it on she jumps around, wags her tail and tries to play with it 🤣
I wish I had Bear's personality " not being bordered about anything for more than 5 seconds" life would be more easier. 🤪🤪  p.s. well I am not sure if u have this thing in the U.S. , but where I stay you can take the dog you like from the shelter for 2 weeks or more and see if you are fine with it and if other dogs you may have at home also go along and only then really adopt.
we need that cat
6 hours i wouldve thought there would be 200k already for bear
Bear ❤️
GET THE CAT
Alright, now we need a video of you reacting to doctor strange
🐻🐱
Bro u make funnier video everytime
I think there's a whole other dog behind the couch with how much fur Dr. Mike was pulling out of Bear.
Corgis are in NO WAY chill dogs. They are little wiggles on wheels and need a ton of exercise.
BEAR! :D
Get a Galgo rescue (there's real problem with them in Spain) they look sporty but they are really chill doggos
let me doOoO it forrrrr youuuuu
I always wanted a king shepherd.
We have a weiner mix jack Russell, she's a jackshund (here in the U.K. we call weiners dachshunds)  she's the best dog in the world.
didn't Dr Mike have a different dog at one point?
I want to see a bear cat 300k likes
ALSO TIP FOR RESCUE DOG: Just meet them. Meet them ALL. at ANY shelter. There are so many millions of dogs out there in shelters right now, most of which are perfectly fine companion animals. Find the size and age you want, and just literally.. MEET. ALL. THE. DOGS. And bring Bear, it's important that they get to meet and say hello, see how they get along!
The shiba Inu was exactly where it needs to be on that chart
Please consider rescuing a brown cat instead of buying.  In regards to finding a rescue dog that matches your personality type, most shelters do personality evaluations of varying degrees (some are in depth tests, others are what they see when they walk the dogs/take them outside for exercise).  If you talk to an employee/volunteer about what kind of pup you're looking for, they'd be happy to recommend specific dogs.  For the general person reading my comment: dogs shouldn't be grouped on personality based on what breed they are.  Like at the end of his video, Mike said a golden retriever attacked Bear at one point.  Yet Goldens are considered to be family dogs.  Breed temperament should be taken as an umbrella category rather than an expectation - cats and dogs are as vast in personalities as people are.  Its worse for dogs with bag stigma like pitbull breeds though.  Once considered a nanny dog, now considered a gangster owned child killer, or some other nonsense :/ yet the current "family dogs" (goldens, labs, poodles, corgis, shepherds, etc) are more dangerous bc people feel like they can get up in their space "because they are x breed and should be friendly."  My least favorite breed are German shepherds, or any big dog with a booming bark.  As someone who has worked in the vet field, GSDs and similar dogs are the most unpredictable.
Can you make it so bear gets his cat at 75k please
Can bear have a man bun?
I don’t care, muffins are delicious
liked to get Bear that cat
That’s funny to know, bear weighs more then me😂😂
Loved this. I'm from sc and that corgi meme was pretty accurate. Columbia , myrtle Beach, they did good on that one tbh.
I’m in Massachusetts and got a dog from a rescue in Texas. I spoke to the woman who ran the rescue multiple times on the phone and told her what my lifestyle and personality were like and what I was looking for in a dog. She could not have matched me with a better dog! She was driven from Texas to Connecticut where I met her and drove her home. Best decision I’ve ever made. We compliment each other so well and I couldn’t be happier! (She was also quite jealous after I got home from Doctor Mike’s show where I met both Mike and Bear….I got the side eye a lot that night 😂)
I'm eating a muffin as you go on your muffin rant
I just have to let you know the reason I got a newfie was because of bear. But dr.Mike you never warned me about the psycho phase 6-24 months 😂😂😂😂 if you know you know
Either corgi aren't chill or my corgi is defective XD
Video 6 of asking Dr Mike to review AmbuLAnce
Lol I was watching this with my cats and one of them got up and left when Dr.Mike asked if they make brown cats as if to say "nope we don't exist" XD (hes a chocolate brown cat with black points)
god i'm 130, thats a masive dog
4:09 as a cat person, i can say that i've never clicked a like button faster
mike can you make a video of what other foods are hidden treasures of calories and saturated fat? best foods for bulking or gaining weight?
Everyone smash the like button, DR.MIKE, UR GETTING THAT CAT!!!!!
3:33 I don’t care I’m a growing child I need those things!   Maybe not the saturated fat though
Whippets look like morbidly obese Greyhounds.
Mike, please react to 1000 ways to die
I feel the same same I go to my parents’ and their dog jumps up on my bed to sleep with me… and she’s a CHIHUAHUA!!! (not to be confused with a muffin)
He's getting a CAT lol
I have three rescue dogs in my house, and I have no tips for getting one that matches your personality. When we got our 2nd one, (Emilia) she was so scared, and for like a week, she hid under the dining room table and wouldn't come out for almost anything other than food and bedtime. After that one week though, she showed her true inner maniac. 😌
NO THE BORZOI FOLLOWED ME TO YOUTUBE
I love bear so much ❤️❤️❤️
I remember whenever my cat would sleep in my bed somehow I always end sleeping on the edge while the cat completely takes over the bed.  At least with your dog it makes sense.
Whether you get a bear cat or another dog, I'm just glad they'll get a loving home. It always makes me sad to think of how many animals there are without them. We recently took in a dog who was left behind by his owners. He's been too nervous to do anything but lay on his bed whenever he's not outside, but he's finally starting to move around. We're still trying to get him to not slump down and become non-reactive whenever we put a leash on him, but the progress we've made so far is encouraging.
At 2:30, is it a whippet or borzoi? I’m confused.
I highly recommend using Volhard's Aptitude Test! (It's what I used to pick out my service dog.) It's meant for puppies but works well on adult dogs too. It should give you a very accurate depiction of a dogs personality and if they'll be compatible with your lifestyle. :D
Im not even safe from the borzois on this channel
as a furry, the first meme hits home
We rescued all our pets. The best thing to do is talk to the shelter staff and be super honest about what you like to do with your dogs and what your homelife is like. I recommend vising with the dogs and volunteering to walk and play with them. If you find one you like, ask if you can bring Bear to play and go for a walk. Because shelters have a goal of keeping all animals in their forever homes. You don't want to bring home your new pup and have Bear or that dog have issues. You can even request to foster the dog for a few weeks to see if he/she connects with Bear. Most shelters will pay for vet bills and food during fostering. And if it does not work out you supported a dog in learning how to live in a house and follow rules, making them more adoptable and relieving pressure on over crowded shelters.
yes, you did in fact get a dog that looks somewhat like you. Where is the resemblance, you ask? It's definitely the hair.  Also be careful with your assumption of chillness in corgis... While Newfies like bear are bred just to be heavy lifters and companion animals, thus very chill and easygoing, corgis are a real working breed whose primary job was/is herding - they are extremely intelligent and easy to bore and can be quite a handful, prone to anxious herding behaviors like nipping. Honestly, you may find that little package of dog to be quite a bit more of a challenge than Bear. But considering you understand what husky energy is like, you would probably handle it fine. They're not the worst high energy herding breed either, but they're up there. You will be kept on your toes at some point!
I thought Mythbusters did a video about that door and getting it to float lol Think its possible with a bit of finagling
Look into a foster program, with a animal rescue. You will be able to do foster to adopt. It will help get the dog outside the shelter life to for a bit....helps with the dogs mental health as well as helping the shelter know the dog more.
Bear 😂❤
I had 3 Newfies growing up. Bear makes me miss my Sadie
His dog is so cute I love him
You can still get one at the shelter. With my local Humane Society, and possibly most shelters, it isn't just a matter of going and picking a dog out of a cage and going home. You go and pick a dog, then you go out to a fenced area of the yard and spend a minimum of half an hour together. Then you come back another day and spend another half an hour with them. If you have other animals in your home you are encouraged to bring them for the second visit. Only after the dog has met every person living in the home at least once can you adopt the dog.
Hey Can You React To Young Sheldon And Big bang theory medical scenes they have some good ones
I love bear's little tufts of hair on his head just standing up 🥲
Bear is getting in a cat for sure 😂
The pure bread should have said inbread. 😂
A doggy door big enough for Bear is called a "door."
PLEASE REACT TO THE GLORY INJURIES
What is Bear's race

That part about the dog alarm clock…😂😂😂😂 I never laughed so hard in my life.  Except I never adopted a dog before but I did have cats and well there is a sound cats make when they’re about to cough up hairballs and it essentially has the same effect.
I live in an apartment building and my buzzer rings on my phone. Now when my phone rings she rushes to the door and she cries if it's just a phone call and no one is visiting
I wish doctor Mike's videos never end, I enjoy watching them more than anything ❤️❤️
6 hours later: 51k like  Goal: 300k
Hi Dr. Mike.  I'm a new subscriber to your channel.  Would you mind answering a couple of questions that I'm certain everyone else knows the answers to?  How old is Bear and did you get Bear from Canada or were you able to find a local breeder?  Also, a rescue dog is the way to go!!!  There are many purebreds in rescue shelters and there are also many breed specific rescues.  Hope this helps.
U must get a  Cat
Big drooly squish boi 🫠❤️
I love dogs

Please get a cat for Bear!🥹🐻
You can always foster a dog/cat and if it's not a good match the rescue will understand and try to match you with a different dog/cat. I know it sounds horrible but it is actually a really good way so both person and animal find a good match it's sort of like some people do with kids or like dating.
What breed is Bear?
Big ol' Bear has such a cute little woof!
We have a Chocolate Lab Doberman whose name is Koda. One of his nicknames we call him is that he's our Lemon-lime lab. He's had both rear knees redone and a few months after we adopted him, he contracted lyme. He's all good now, of course!
I have a dog he is a black lab and when we first got him we put him in a kennel/cage and he ate the whole cage and broke out
I love bear so much 😊
Ooh
Wait a sec he just wait that they make cats there spys
get this video to 300K likes!!!
Doctor Mike idk how it is in your area but my local shelter will let you foster a dog to see if they are a good fit and then you can adopt.
Didn't I do it for you?
My man, I grew up with corgis, have one now and they are absolutely not chill dogs. They are funny, happy, energetic, playful, stubborn, loyal, and perpetually hungry. Chill? Not so much.
i also think owners look like their dogs.  like u and bear just match perfectly, its so cute
Russian doesn't recognize a Borzoi?
I have a miniature wiener dog. Other than the yappiness you absolutely summed her up. I have never seen a friendlier dog. And yeah, she totally ignores commands
Im about to get a corgi puppy!!
Didn’t even get the russian breed 🙈
2:41 kermie…😓😓😭😭😢😢😢☹️☹️
2:40 LMFAO
Okay but try to solve this.  I farted and popped a blood vessel. Did i push too hard? Did it travel upwards or downwards? Did it evaporate? Where did it go? How did a fart pop a blood vessel? Did the fart travel? Is something broken? Is something wrong in my body? Is there even a blood vessel down there?  Respond in the next 24 hours.
Doctor Mike, I am a veterinary technician. I think it would be so much fun to do a reaction video with you!
Your best bet is to volunteer to walk dogs at a shelter to see who you click with. You could also foster if you have the time and means to do so. Or find a foster family who you can visit and get to know some dogs in a home setting
As a cat person: We ride at dawn boys. Smash that like.
11:01  Mythbusters covered this.  IF both Jack & Rose had place their life preservers under the board, they could both have survived. Hypothermia would have hit but to a non fatal level. ONLY if both life preservers were slipped under the board.
Eh you look more like Roxy instead of bear, but I really see that all the time!
My older cousin used to have a Dachshund that I got to grow up with and so seeing the little Dachshund on the meme. Man that took me back 😂 I also grew up with German shepherds and we just recently lost our 17 year old shepherd in June of last year and I miss her so so much she was absolutely amazing and beautiful she helped take in stray cats and any other animal we rescued and she was just an amazing loving dog even till the end.
Dr. Mike, reach out to Lee Asher about how to find the perfect rescue dog.
Mike's muffin rant is Hilarious
have you reacted to wwe? you should.
I never had a debate about the door, it's riding pretty low and she is nearly frozen to death when she is saved. My issue with that movie was how she got out of the lifeboat that he left her in and that led to her being with him, making him unable to use the door by himself. In fact I think he would have had an easier time of it since the arranged fiancé wouldn't have been chasing them and she would have made them look for survivors earlier.
Am I the only one thinking Bear looks like giant version of Max from The Grinch
7:56 five names like fingers in the hand?
Please react to the worst soccer injuries please mike🙏🏽
I was eating a muffin while watching this…..
As not being over 30 with a family dog, I have anxiety, my dog has anxiety from literally everything, it's very accurate to about everyone
We NEED this video to get 300k likes now
My dog was attacked by a big dog as I opened the door for us to walk outside! My dog is a chihuahua and this dog was huge... Well not as big as Bear, but probably 70 lbs compared to my 8-pound baby! The big dog grabbed him by the neck but didn't bite down or anything. My Chi was not hurt! He immediately came inside, shook it off and turned around and started cussing out the big dog in chihuahua attitude! I think you showed a picture of my Chi telling off the big dog who attacked him! The owner of the big dog who was probably playing, but inappropriately, felt horrible!
Havana Browns are completely chocolate brown
cough syrup (anti cough medicine) and choco milk doesnt taste bad imo
K guys, we need to do this. Mike needs a cat
8:05 I can't be the only one to call my dog offensive names
How's Roxy doing??btw i hope you get Bear a little kitty:>
Bear needs a brown cat friend
If something ever happens to my boxer, I want a dog like Bear. My boxer is 10 yrs old and weighs around 90lbs.
My corgi, Rosie is a rescue and she is the perfect dog for me. When you go to a humane society or shelter, let an employee know the size, energy level and other characteristics you want. The person at the front desk suggested Rosie after I told her what kind of dog I wanted and it ended up being a match made in heaven. You also have to trust your gut, but also spend time with any dog you have a really good feeling about. I was allowed to take her on a walk and spend time with her in a separate room so she was away from the sounds and noise of the adoption floor. The staff also gave me some toys for her to play with. After spending time with her I knew in my heart that she was meant to be my dog so I filled out the adoption application that day and the rest is history. She was estimated to be about 8 months old when I adopted her. She's now 9 and not a day goes by that I'm not thankful for her goofy personality and her snuggles. I was diagnosed with CML 3 months before I adopted her and because of my cancer and other health issues I became disabled shortly after and she has been by my side through it all. Rescues dogs are amazing.   I can't wait to see what kind of dog you eventually rescue for Bear. I vote for a corgi, but I'm biased. And I hope this video gets to 300k likes because I rescued a cat named Sushi so Rosie would have a friend andbtgey bonded instantly.
OH THE LET ME DO IT FOR YOU DOG
1:31  You say Bear looks like a bear? My very 1st encounter with a Newfoundland was delivering high value courier mail (Datapost) in the 80’s. I went upstairs at an international shipping company and ignored the bearskin rug in the corner until that damned thing stood up. Not sure what was more noticeable, the trail of burning footprints or the trail of smelly brown stuff.  😂😂
Hehe doctor Mike said WeInEr hAhA sO sIlLy GoOsE
I wish I had cardio*yourwiener*opathy 🫣🤭
Bear!!
I'm going to be looking after a friend's Chow Chow (another type of large doggo!) any tips?? (^_^)*
You don't have Bear's jowls but the fur is on point.
Please let's get the video to 300k likes.. As a cat person I need to see Dr. Mike with a cat 🙀

We're the same age!
Mike, as a corgi brother, they are not always super chill, but they are great!
So what would you name the brown cat? O.o
You’ll look like bear in a couple of years
Hey dr mike should there be positions you shouldn’t sleep in
More dog videos please. Seeing Bear gives me joy. His temperament seems similar to our 9 month old bloodhound bb and I aw. 🥺
Bear is such a gentle giant! I love his calming energy! 🐶❤️
The bear is so cute🐻❤️
please like the video everyone! I really wanna see bear and a cat 😂
love how mike and Bear perfectly incapsulate the "Dogs and their owners look alike" theory
'you have explosive diarrhoea' THAT ENDED ME 😂 love u mike and bear 💓
I have 3 doxies and I approve of your message about wieners lol
No the secret to not having your dog eat the couch is giving them mental stimulation and exercise as well as them getting outlets for natural behaviors aka behaviors there borne with for example hunting, sniffing the ground for sent,. In Sweden its illegal to have your dog in a crate at home and still it’s extremely rear for people having there dog destroy the couch.
4:50 Bear looks like Max from the 2018 Grinch movie.
Mythbusters actually proved that is WAS possible for them both to be on the door, but in order to keep the boyancy, they needed to put the life belt Rose was wearing underneath the door. If they had done that, they would both have been able to fit on the door and stay afloat. Without the life belt, the door would always tip and dunk one or the other.  I love Bear by the way.
I see why his name is Bear lol, he’s so adorable!
"Bear look it's a cone!" 🤣🤣
no one respectable dog owner get this to 300k likes...... please dont
I keep forgetting I am a year older than Dr mike
A good rescue group or even a coalition of smaller rescues can help You match a dog to Your lifestyle and current pets.  Shelter staff can do it also, and doesn't US have a Pet finder ? Please please please get a rescue, You have such a big platform and You could sway so many people. There are so many awesome dogs being euthanized because people are afraid that all abandoned dogs are "broken", can't be taught different routine,etc, which is all bullshit. I rehabilitate abused dogs and even in the saddest,most extreme cases they open up their hearts and go back to being just loving, trusting pets who would gladly give their life for that special  person that would give them just a little more time than average rescue dog needs. Getting a dog with similar temperament and opposite sex of current pet practically guarantees that they will get along especially if properly introduced ❤️
We need to get Bear a pet cat
Dr mike. Yes. You and bear look like each other😀
I think the best place to find rescues are PetFinder because they can tell you all about the dog to make sure its a good fit. Some ethical breeders in NYC ( or near nyc) are places like Bidawee or friends with fours paws and if you go to the place you can meet all the dogs before you choose. My dog is a rescue we found on PetFinder and it told us all about him before we submitted application forms!
Chronicle heterochromia Meaning two different coloured eyes
I had a great dame that was 170lbs and just his head laying on me would cut off circulation.
More videos with you and bear, please!!! Gives lots of dopamine and serotonin!
If you make your own muffins, you'll know precisely how much saturated fat is in them.  Just sayin'
You gotta get Bear a kitty friend!!! (Can u tell I'm a kitty person? Lol) There doesn't tend to be solid brown ones that I can think of offhand but tortoise shell kitties have a lot of brown and they are THE best babies. 😁

My childhood dog was a black newf/golden retriever mix. The SWEETEST boy on the planet and we would call him a fuzzy bucket of love. Bear reminds me of his temperament! <3
2:40 it’s a Borzoi 💀
you should say happy heathy HANDSOM
the dog looks like a brown version of the grinch 😂
I hope you adopt a rescue dog or kitty from a shelter next. There are so many that are in need of adoption and there's really no good reason to pay for a dog from a breeder. You can find most breeds of dogs at shelters, many people buy dogs and when they grow out of the cute puppy stage or they realize a puppy is too much for them, sadly they get rid of them. Please people adopt a rescue dog or cat from a shelter!
James Cameron is an idiot. Myth Busters already proved, all they need was to connect their life jackets together and put the plank on top. That provided enough buoyancy for them both to float and survive.
I liked this video in under 5 seconds after watching Mike yell "MEMES" at Bear.  It's the little things.
47k in 5 hours. We gettin bear a cat.
Corgis are herding dogs. Might not be a good choice if you are looking for a couch potato. Also, regarding finding a rescue, it’s actually easier to find a rescue who fits with your personality than it is to purchase a puppy who will, because the rescue organization will have spent time with the dog and gotten to know it well. You don’t actually know what you are getting personality-wise when you purchase a young puppy from a breeder or a pet store. You might have an idea of what the breed’s temperament is like, and a breeder might tell you about the parents, but you don’t know what the puppy itself will be like. A rescue, on the other hand, will usually be matched with you based on its temperament, personality, and behavior, so you have a much better chance at getting a good match with a rescue dog. I highly recommend reaching out to some local rescues in your area, as well as some breed specific rescues if you are looking for a certain breed. That way they can have your information on file should the perfect dog for you come into their care.
Let's get Bear a kitty friend. Need that 300K likes!
Actually excited to see some cat dad content 😄
None of my dogs have been crate trained and none of them have eaten the couch. It is a matter of making sure they have been given a good run in the yard before you go and leaving them something to keep them busy while you are out. Destroying the furniture is a sign of separation anxiety and you need to have that treated by a vet.
I’m this vid dr Mike is a co star
I rescued in a sense. I rehomed and I think it's the best middle ground of saving a life while also getting a dog breed or traits that fit you and your goals. So if a dog is common place enough (and even some that are rare may still pop up in rehome listings) you'll easily find them. Dogs like Dobermans, Huskies, German Shepherds, Malinois, Golden Retrievers, Labs, and many more are listed.   Rehoming is the process of a private adoption of a dog rather than giving it to a pound or a shelter. Sometimes an owner will reach out to an organization specialized in rehoming that breed. Rehoming is usually done when the owner has gone through a life change or realizes they can not provide for the animal as expected. A death in the family, finances, moving, or lack of time can all be possibilities. Usually the case is people will buy these dogs as puppies, and realize after 8-16 months they can't handle the dog and will rehome. Usually there is a rehoming fee but don't be dismayed. It's a good thing because it not only helps the owner recoup some financial loss but it also deters people who may want to get a dog but are not serious about it's care or would rehome the dog for nefarious reasons. It shouldn't be crazy like $2000 but expect like $1000 or less (usually less).  The way to find these dogs that need new homes would be Facebook and a quick google search. Two years ago I realized a standard poodle fit my needs and goals but I knew buying a dog was not something I wanted to do nor was financially capable (broke college kid). That's when I scoured Facebook, Facebook groups, and online websites. Eventually I found a lady in buttfuck nowhere Arkansas. Your best bet would be to find a breed of dog you like and want. Then go to Facebook and query. Type in "poodle rehome" then "poodle home" then "poodle new home"; anything that may pull up a search result where someone has made a post about being heart broken and needing to give up their pooch. You can also look up on Fabecook "poodle rehome group" or anything along those lines because people will join those groups and post when they need to rehome or know someone that needs to rehome a dog. With Facebook definitely do your due diligence with talking to the owner, asking questions, and figuring out what was this dog's past life. Especially ask for you vet records, and if the vaccines weren't administered by a certified vet (the dog breeder can administer it or even shop owners of farming/pet stores can do it - I made this mistake and my poodle caught parvo) just take a note of that and get all the vaccines again by your vet. Also ask is the dog has any training, commands, and is crate and potty trained. Ask what the dog's energy and temperament is like too. This is important because when it comes to lifestyle and training it'll be difficult to retrain a dog or break bad habits over getting a "green" dog (training term for a dog with little to 0 training at all).  This post is long but do holla at me if you're interested. I went through this with my standard poodle and there are mistakes I've made and lessons I learned that I would love to tell people. I think this is the best middle ground between buying and saving and it really is a sick opportunity. You're helping yourself, helping the previous owner knowing their dog is going to a good home, and you're helping the dog. It's a great opportunity!
Dude, bear is freakin adorable!
GUYS LIKE THE VIDEO! WE NEED A CAT NEWFIE.
I feel like Mike made this just to tell us about Bear
Mike: *Considers corgis as chill dogs.* Me, who lives with a corgi: pFFFFFFFFFFfff!!! LOL

Okay everybody like the video. We must get Bear a cat
Hey doctor mike do you think you could do a video on Lymphoma, I was diagnosed about a year ago, and it is very debilitating but most people seem not to understand it, and was wondering if you could talk about it in a video, if you have any questions for me then feel free to reply and i will get you my contact info.
Dogs are the only ones I trust, my beagle Stitch passed away during covid, I told him everything, he never told anyone my deepest secrets 💔
Doctor mike!! I got something to say about Panera bred wits 260 mg or Caffeine Wach and react to food theory and say if what he said is right and doctor approved and say if it’s ok to drink ok
Everything you said about weenie dogs makes me love you even more! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am not sure but I think that I might have a plushy version of your doggo somewhere in my house...😂🥰
As it is rn there are 250k views and only a bit below 50k likes. And I wonder. What the hell other 200k people are doing? Do they hate Bear? Do they hate cats? Clinically insane?
I've recently rewatched Titanic and Jack could not get on the thing Rose is laying on. Rose and Jack try to get Jack on it but it starts to sink, it could not support the weight of both of them. Rewatch it and you'll see.

I'm rooting for Bear to get a pet kitty friend! :)
Liked for a beautiful kitty friend!
- yeah I don't go for shelter dogs as I like raising a puppy first and I know I'd have to be picky with a shelter dog and that would be so awful to go there and see all the sad puppers. I'd end up taking the first one because i mean they all need help and most are pretty cute.
GUYS 300K LIKES PLEASE!!!!
A doggie-door for Bear would be a regular door!
“Do I look like bear?” You mean, sweet, cute, cuddly, and thicc? Yes, you look like bear.
- yeah sometimes dog nicknames don't make sense, like my doggo is named Casper but for some reason I often end up calling him butters or Mr. Spooks
At 150-160 my Dane is at a perfect weight.  We have a queen bed and she sneaks on about 6am.  It's very crowded!
Bear was so pure in the first 20 seconds, I almost needed chest compressions. 🥹🥹🥹😫
Wet we do it for u 😂😂😂
0:34 Mike, not the intrusive thoughts! You aren't supposed to give in to those!
I really want dr mike to get a cat!
Get these likes I need the cat!!
We getting you that Cat
hmm
When looking at a rescue, ask how long they've been at the shelter. If it's been like...a day, it's possible that the shelter doesn't know if the dog has any behavioral issues and SURPRISE. You now have a dog that has very specific needs you had no idea you were signing up for. (My Bear has severe separation anxiety and finding that out was a nasty shock)
Aww bear is so docile and a good listener 🥰
Bear is a legend Doctor Mike is a legendary YouTuber and together is a legend sandwich (oh my god why am I so cringy) 😅
Bear: PeWOOF
Bear is literally the cutest and has a heart of out of gold ❤️
- everyone who doesn't upvote this is a cat hating monster!
When I see ppl having a lot of fun w their pets I feel happy for them but one thought that never leaves me is how sad they'd be when the pet is not here anymore :')
In the Titanic, if they both gotten on the door, they could have snuggled for body heat. Just saying 🙃
This may be a repeat of other comments, but I've always adopted rescues - specifically senior dogs are my passion - and there are usually advocacy groups that work with shelters as well as fosters. Of course you can go to a shelter and meet dogs, and many times you can set up and meet n greet at the shelter with a dog of intereat and take Bear to see how they get along. I've found that fosters are one of the best ways to get to know a dog, because dogs act very differently in a busy kennel vs a home. If a dog is being fostered, just reach out to the foster and ask about their personality and let them know what your home is like and what you're looking for in a dog, and the foster can tell you if they believe it will be a good fit. It can take some time and meeting lots of pups, but it is so worth it! So many rescue dogs are absolutely wonderful pets. Good luck on that search when the time comes!
The nicest phrase mentioning dogs I read some time ago and immediately loved it: Be the person your dog thinks you are!
Anyone gonna tell him what a “boofer” really is? No? Alright…. 😂😂
I just got a rescue dog 3 weeks ago tomorrow! Her name is Izzy and she was NOT the dog I originally went with! I wanted a dog named Molly, but the shelter advised that based on what I said I was looking for/my current situation, she might not be a good fit. I asked for them to point me in the right direction, and they came back with 3 dogs that I looked into, and that's how I found Izzy. We have a lot of work to do, and she has some issues, and she doesn't really know how to be a dog, and I get the feeling that she really went through it before she made it to me, but I already can't imagine my life without her. Even before our trial week was over I knew that the only way they were getting her away from me was to pry her away.  Point is, if you want a shelter dog and don't know how to make sure the two of you mesh, ask the shelter to play matchmaker. They're really good at it.

Let's get Bear that pet cat.🐱
you should talk more about the medical aspect of that scene with jack and rose! many people think they should have taken turns on the door, but i feel like that just wouldn’t have been possible because of the cold’s effect on their bodies
4:40 Also, most kids they want to sleep. Once they go inside the room to sleep, they want to play outside. 😂😂
i have a grater swiss mountain doggo he's soooo sweet
Do they make brown cats…  They make cats…
Does that include homemade muffins? Please respond this is a very serious question
<3 <3

GET THE CAT MIKE.
Where did the name Bear come from? Lol is it cuz he’s huge?
But the way Bear looks at Doctor Mike like he understands him in every way possible is just so adorable
Everyone Who Wants Dr. Mike to make a series out of this    | V
Get a cat you won’t regret it and if you do get cat that looks like bear name the cat cub
Mike Singing is top notch
9:28 also 33 with anxiety and my dog is honest to God anxious all the time. She even has a Xanax prescription (which doesn’t work)
PAWSOME video!! I WFM as a therapist. (Video)...my fur kids hear it all! But they understand confidentiality and are very good! 😄👍🐾
Nope. No merch linked. But Bear is hell cute!
Time Bear eating 10 nuggets and multiply the time.
What's with the elevator question? dogs can feel... movement "Do dogs understand getting picked up or are they just like 'I'm taller now'"
Like so bear gets a cat named cougar
BEAR IS SO CUTE AND SNUGGLY!!! Also doctor mike I have been watching your videos for a long time now, and I love all of them!! I hope you have a great day/evening/morning/night!❤✨
In my experience, dogs do remember the bad things that happen to them. My Dad had his blue heeler x red kelpie, Chip, for sixteen years. When Chip was about three years old, an extended family member's kid threw a rock at him. For the rest of his life, if that kid tried to lead him around or anything like that, he would growl at them. He was nothing but sweet, patient and cuddly with everyone else. On a lighter note, Chip met one particularly kind member of my family twice in his life; first as a puppy, then again at the age of fourteen. At the second meeting, he ran straight to her, and greeted her like an old friend. She was very touched. So they also remember the good things. 😊
if you want to get a cat that looks like bear, look into black Norwegian forest cats. Mine actually has some brown in her, she might not be pure bred tho
everybody plz like the video for the sake of my mental health 🙏🏼 i can already imagine the cat always sleeping on top of bear because his fur is so soft and comfy and it’s bringing tears to my eyes thank you
I love newfoundland dogs, especially Bear. Their so big yet cuddly and gentle 🥰😍
pretty sure mine yoof.
He Dr. Mike, can you make a video about (your) anxiety? Bear needs a catfreeennnnn!
This is content.
you can BEARly feel his ribs
I would give full permission to discuss me with bear, also a lot of dog rescues give you a chance to really meet all the dogs and find out about them and weather or not you will be a good match for each other
You have a cute dog
aw bear is adorable
I have a long haired chocolate cat that is the exact same color as Bear.
Not breaking HIPPA... Might be getting into a YIPPA violation though...
Do they make brown cats? lmfao yes, kittens are created in Labs lol.
No reason, no reason at all, JUST LET ME BOOP HIS SNOOT.
Muffins are basically mini cakes lol
As someone that’s family has rescued a dog, let me tell you about Pam. My mom lost twins, and then the dog my dad got for my mom to try and cheer her up died from some illness picked up at the shelter. So after that bit of morbidness, in 1999 my mom and dad went to the shelter. All the dogs were barking so loudly at my parents. Except one. In the far back corner, there was this tiny little puppy, and she was a border collie. They said she had one week until she would be put down. So my parents adopted her. She comforted my mom, was great for my sisters, and then little baby me came the next year. I had my best friend from the minute I was brought home from the hospital, until I looked in her beautiful eyes, holding her paw, telling her hold much I loved her while they injected the medication to let her pass. Trust me. Get to know the dog at a local shelter, see if they have an area where you can take them outside in a gated area (at least the shelter at mine does) and ask about the dogs history if there is any.
Doctor Mike should react to asmr doctors lol
Dogo
"Demolition Dog" <3
when I saw borzio I suddenly broke into song
"it's not breaking HIPPA if you tell your dog about your patients right?" 😂💖
Honestly if Dr. Mike gets a fluffy brown cat, it's name should be Cub for Bear cub😍
Totally here for a cat friend for Bear!! 🐈 🎉❤
1:07 if only we had that
um i have a rescue, there was some animal rescue organization outside a walmart and they had a cute little doggo and i bought him. he kinda grew to fit my personality i think, but i did get him really young. hes great, really nice and not barky, idk if i just got lucky or smtn, but thats my story with rescues.  would recommend.
My parents once had a cat who was totally chill when Mom would vacuum.  The MIXER freaked him out, though!
THEY SAID IT THEY SAID THE THING
Good luck finding a brown cat! They're quite rare!
let's do it guys. let's get it to 300k likes and get bear a buddy.
ME MES
Thank you doctor Mike I’m so close to persuading my parents to get one ❤❤❤
corgis aren't actually chill at all! they were originally bred to herd livestock, so they need a lot of physical activity!
For the rescue dog thing... best thing to do is go to shelters and literally meet them all.
the fact that bear has a bigger head than mike "
9:22 I relate to this meme 😂
Amen
LETTT MEE DO IT FOR YOUUUUUU
Bear's dog door would have to be huge lol
10:51 "it's scientifically not 'paws'ible
Please don’t get a corgi if you want a chill dog!!! They are extremely high energy working dogs that need a job!
Mythbusters did that rose and jack door test and they could’ve both been on and both lived if they tried
How many likes for the corgi?
2:30 | Doctor Mike: "Oh, I forgot the name of this dog." The back of my mind: "DIDN'T I DO IT FOR YOU?!"
Muffins are bad? I eat the Little Bites muffin pouches every day before work so I don't have to waste time making anything. Luckily I care about ease and taste, not health XD
I found my rescue puppy on pet finder. He's the cutest and sweetest dog ever. ♥️
aww .. i'm not fat, i'm just a little husky .. that got a legit lol
Interesting. I've never matched my rescue dogs to my personality. I certainly take into consideration if the dog would get along with anyone living with me and whether they're high energy, but otherwise I take a gamble and it's never backfired. They're all completely different and all wonderful.
Omg corgi’s are not chill pls go observe some first before you decide 😂
If Bear were any cuter I think I would die! I want to just lay down with him and snuggle into all that massive amount of fur. You know he's just so warm and cuddly!
From what I remember, Jack DID try to get onto the door next to her but it couldn't hold both their weight and began to submerge so he just got off. I do always wonder tho if they could both survive if they took turns on the door.
I wish I had a dog to help with Sadness cause it happens everyday
Imagining how much dog hair is in his place is giving me anxiety!!
Wait how many times a month do you have to swap your bed sheets with a Newf, especially Bear🤣
Yall im blind and for some reason i didnt see the timer at 3:30 & i got jumpscared so badly omfg
Damn, Bear weighs more than me
That one with see dog in background of the video that's me with all animals
Hey Dr. Mike, I suffer from year-round allergies (air only) and it was recommended to me by friends to take cod liver oil to help with my symptoms. What kind of research has been done on oil supplements sold over the counter on their allergy symptom relief. Thanks, your too broke to buy access to reliable journals, allergy sufferer.
Bear looks so very sweet An if you Harvest his organs I will harvest yours too! My cat kept looking at bear and you are meowed the cutest sound ever. She never did that to me😅 btw love your vids
👑👑In Mr. Beast We Trust
❤❤❤
Fun video! And I really enjoyed the Bear grooming video, Dr. Mike, especially that tip on drying the hair in strokes not random circles to keep it tangle free. Will use on our 1/10th the size Maltipoo 😊 also very touching the amount of effort, inspired me that we can do it ourselves 🙏🏻🐶 PS I am very glad that you have Bear to confide in ❤
This is the cutest video I've ever watched in my entire life 😭
Beat is just pure love
waiting for the cat
We need a cat for bear
he is pure bread
I heard dogs evolved to have "eyebrows" to show facial expressions.
2:42 didn’t mean to wait 4u
Having one chill dog and getting another one equal doggy chaos!!!!! I have a 10 year old chi mix we recently got another chi mix puppy and they found they both have full on gremlin modes. Its cute but noisy af!
Start looking for brown cats, Mike. 😂 It'll be 300k in no time.
Yes you have fluffy hair and bear to
get a kitten so bear has a baby sibling i liked the video just for that lol
Video: All about Dogs. Comments Question: Ethics of the Movie "Titanic" 🤔🤔🤔
EVERY ONE NEEDS TO LIKE WE NEED HIM TO GET A CAT
I'm a grown adult, I'm almost 6 feet tall, and I'm pretty sure Bear weighs more than me
More videos with bear please!!!! Just love himmmmm❤️
Bear is chill and cute may I have him 😊🎉
love seeing you with bear, it seems like your truest self :)
A lot of shelters have foster to adopt programs as well to make sure the dog and owner are a good fit!
Give. This. Dog. A. Cat. Friend.
Corgis are actually very athletic. But I'm sure a chill dog like Bear can get along with any kind of dogs. To rescue a dog that fits your lifestyle, contact a rescue that foster dogs in people's homes instead of keeping them in kennel. That way, fosters can tell you personality of each dogs in a home environment. Dogs in kennel don't show their true personality.
1. Most black cats are actually heavily melanistic brown. You can see it in the sun. 2. Corgis are NOT low energy. Every corgi I know loves to go on hikes and long daily walks and enjoys trips to the lake or river for all the dirty paw swimming. 3. Breed specific rescues are a thing. They work really hard to pair the right dog with the right home.
GUYS WE HAVE TO GET IT TO 300K LIKES
Bear is cute, wonder what breed he is
James Cameron was right.
not me getting triggered by mike calling a dachshund a wiener dog
your dog... i am amazed SO CUTE
right now this makes me sad... because my assistance dog (in training) has to leave me because he is not suitable for this job 😞
BEST DR. MIKE VIDEO EVER!!! Please do more of this!!! :D
regarding the titanic door scene, i never thought it was about how much room, but the buoyancy.
*b e a r.*
Sorry Mike but yes you match Bear. Both have large muscles. Both have brown hair. Both are *quirky*
Jack tried to get on the board with her and it tipped over so he chose to just put just her on it. Idk why people still debate this when it's in the movie he couldn't be on it.
cooll
Cutest bear on earth!!!
A very good selection of god memes and bear looks like the goodest of boys
Brown cats are super rare
Misha: Do I look like you? Me: Fluffy, cute, sweet, gentle, lots of charisma? Yep, 100%
Bear= flurf
Was watching this though my playstation on TV and once he said if this got 300k likes he'd get bear a cat. immediately had to grab my phone so I can like lmao
Watching this while literally eating a blueberry muffin 😂
You should totally react to fail army injuries
0:30 omg YES!!! it's the cheeks... 😛 <3
I LOVE HOW BEAR STUCK OUT HIS TONGUE JUST A LITTLE BIT BEFORE DOING A MLEM
"Do they make brown cats?"
My dog needs mental help, she eats everything (once she ate pencil, didn’t even notice until I saw the splinters).
The Dachshund meme hit close to home.  My sister and I are currently dealing with cardiomyopathy/cardiomegaly with ours called Jackson.  That disease is a leading killer of weenies.  We take it one day at a time in this household.
I have that same dog and mine is also brown
What a good doggo
💖
Can i have your bear 🐻 please?
I've never considered a corgi a chill dog. It's a herding dog
Oh my god bear seems like a amazing dog he is so cute !
My cat looks as Fluffy as Bear and has brown fur :) she's my little Angel
I have a dog, I have anxiety and I have a dog with anxiety  I’m ready for life
Cats rule 😺😺❤️
So, you're getting a cat.
Man, this obsession with crates is soo strange to many/most of us Europeans....
We need to get these likes up people
Random question. Can caffeine be deadly?  Asking Google is basically asking a comment section anyway so might as well try both.  For context I watched a food theory video just now about panera lemonade. Yep lemonade
Hoping you get the cat and make a video lol
We gotta get the video to 300,000 likes.. CATS N DOGS 4 LIFE!!!!
this was such a wholesome vid 🥰
dogtor
10/10 would snuggle. 🐶🥰
bear weighs more than me
pardon me but didn't you have a husky.
Golden retrievers are the worst dog to have in my opinion. My friends had one growing up, and I never could trust it. She was always very aggressive towards everyone. I've never met one that wasn't snappy and aggressive.
saw some of the same memes with birds
10:48 I remember the Mythbusters testing it and they both could've survived.
And Mike
Hi bear
Best video I’ve ever watched pls keep doing these type of vids
More Bear videos. Also, it would be cool if you found a vet you could do joint videos with. That would be fun. Human health plus animal health.
My Anatolian got to play with a black newfoundland a few weeks ago it was like watching my dog wrestle a bear cub. My good boy looks so intimidating that most owners will not let their dogs play with him not realizing he's a service dog and as gentle as can be so when he got to play with another massive puppy it felt really good. When his pack mate a 13 yr old Boerboel who is too old to play rough crosses the bridge I want to get a newfoundland but living in Florida I'm not sure how he or she will do in the heat of summer
IS IT BREAKING HIPA? 😂
Cardiomywieneropathy 😂😂😂
Love the bed head Dr Mike!!
4:22 a corgi… but what about a Shiba? Shoobs are so cute with their curled-up tails!
Bear is such a gentle giant ♥️
My dog is named bear too
Alternative idea, I have two sweet angel cats who need a cat dad. Seems like the easiest solution.
You have a brown Newfoundland named Bear. My family has a black and white Newfoundland named Panda.  We are the same
GET IT TO 300 THOUSAND LIKES GUYSS
Meems meems meems ahahahahaha
Guys we have to get doctor Mike a cat, that would be awesome lol
Random person: So, ya got any kids, doc?  Dr. Mike: yeah, yeah I got one... The kid:
Y'ALL BETTER NOT FLOP WITH THESE LIKES LET'S GET TO 300K
amazing Bear stories
2:40 That meme won't stop! 🤣🤣🤣
more bear content plz
Dr Mike should get a Greyhound! They're really lovely couch dogs and they're good siblings for other dogs because they don't start nonsense as huskies do. Huskies start all kinds of nonsense, they're too clever.
I’d say if you want a rescue dog just go to different shelters and spend time with the dogs individually and ask the workers there about the dogs personalities. In the end you’ll find a dog that matches with your personality. I’d say if you want a very chill and cuddly dog go for a staffy, their reputation is not the best because of some accidents but it all depends how you treat and raise the dog. Staffys are very chill, cuddly and goofy dogs.
I have been summoned👁 👄👁💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅💅
lolll great video! yes Bear looks like a troll toy
It is possible to have a dog and a cat at the same time because I have a cat and a dog and thay are friends.🙂
DON'T BUY! PLEASE ADOPT!! (if you can)
bear just not laughing but you are that means ur a dog
I work in a vet clinic and in animal rescue, so I have lots of tips! Research the rescues in your area and find one that fits you. If there's a particular dog that interests you, great! If one doesn't immediately catch your eye, the rescue coordinators will take your personality, lifestyle, what you want, and find the right dog for you :)
❤❤❤ BEAR WILL LOVE A PET KITTY❣❣❣
loll Bear subtitles are just too funny
I love sharing my bed with my doggos because I don't like sleeping alone because I easily get nightmares so they act as a sort of comfort for me. I've had 1 dog but lived with 3 dogs and I took care for a 4th one for a while and 2 of them were huge snuggle bugs.
Hey! It's Dachshund. Not "Weiner dog" 🌭🐕
LIKE THIS VIDEO EVERYONE , SO DR MIKE CAN GET A SUPERIOR PET
more of this specific videos
Live in Denmark. Only ever met 1 person using a crate for the dog.
Cat!
2:41 💀 let’s keep this on tiktok maybe lollll    But omg bear is SO CUTE OMG ♥️♥️♥️♥️  ALSO OMG GET THIS VID TO 300,000 LIKES PLEASE BC WE NEED A CAT FRIEND 🐱🐱🐱🐱
Mike calling the Borzoi a Whippet personally offended my whippet who was sleeping calmly until he said that.
Bear is an explosive dog He has explosive diarrhea 🤠
3:12 Please. PLEASE find yourself someone who will look at you like Bear looks at Dr. Mike ♥️
🐶:🍞
0:52 AYO WTF
About how to find a good dog for adoption: Check out the channel Vet Ranch here on yt, they are a vet clinic who rescue and treat animals as a side gig and in their latest video Dr. Karri explains how they do the adoption process to ensure they have a good match between dog and adopter. Would be awesome to see a collab!
Don't get a cat unless you're prepared to be their butler. You pet them when THEY want to be petted and they will train you and Bear. Lol my best friend has two Great Danes and one cat and the cat is actually the bully. Lol
Today I learned that Advil is worse for a hangover. Thanks, Doctor Mike!
Also in regards to the Titanic thing, and interesting point someone brought up to me was the it wasn't the size of the door that was the issue, it was the matter of buoyancy. Even if there was room for both of them on the door, we already saw with their first attempt that the weight was too much for it to stay afloat, so Jack elected himself to stay in the water so the door wouldn't sink.
The only way your content could get any better would be to add a kitty cat. So come people get those numbers 😂 This was such a delightfully times video, enjoyed it very much. Thank you. ❤ I always wondered why he didn’t get on with her, it looked like there was enough space but my sadness in the moment wanted it to be true.  In terms of her yeeting the third party off to save them both... hard answer because sure maybe you question her morality but in the same breath sympathize and root for them. It had to be done to save the love right? Better to sacrifice someone without emotional attachment than this person you’ve just found. 😅
My aunts dog always licks back up the throw when he vomits. Kinda disgusting but I guess the dog likes it?
Owners do look like their dogs! I also think people date people who look like themselves too. It’s weird. You don’t look like Bear though so it’s only occasional.
what breed is bear???
I accomplished the dog, anxiety, and dog with anxiety by age 23 🤣🤣🤣 lucky me lol
It's hilarious how Mike is casually throwing Bears hair behind the couch 😂
My dog not only resembles me or viceversa, but we also have very similar personalities lol
Corgis are not chill at all. They are working dogs, bred to heard sheep and cows all day.
We are 1% there to 3000k dr. Mike!
Doctor mike and bear are so adorable together and bear is just laying on mike laps
Hi dr Mike
Bear
I love Bear so much! And he's as big as me! Weighs that much anyways. I want to snuggle him so bad!
Newfoundland dogs are my favourite because they are just like I know I am huge but I must sit in your lap. It’ll be fine
When it comes to titanic either way I mean I feel they obviously loved each other and they probably did have a door or piece big enough but that was probably so that way she can move around between takes and such but who knows maybe it was smaller and the dress made it look big. IDK I find it is a gray area but there's a lot of things to factor in. But it doesn't matter was it a good movie hell yeah and to me that's all that matters.
They do make brown cats they are just very rare. We see one brown cat at the vet hospital I work at.
I just got a new dog from an animal shelter so technically she is a rescue and they did a meet and greet to see if she would fit my personality as well as the rest of my household before we adopted her.
As a corgi owner I admit, they have no chill…
To meet a rescue dog for you it's important to go visit the shelters and hang out with the animals. Take the dogs out of the kennels and hang out one on one and see their true personality. When they are in the kennels they can be scared or act aggressive. You can also most likely depending on where you are at foster or do home trials on a dog or cat you are interested in to see how they interact with Bear. Just make sure not to judge the dogs while they are in the kennels because their personalities change drastically once you get them outside and even more once they get home and relax and don't have to be on edge.
Please change the title to "Dogtor reacting to dog memes", thank you.
That was the most doctor speak explination of crate training ever 😆
cat
Dr Mike: I love blueberry muffins  Me looking at the blueberries in my freezer: oh blueberry muffins sound great  Dr Mike: THEY RUINED MY CHOLESTEROL THEY HAVE SO MUCH SATURATED FAT AND CARBS AND CALORIES  Me: ☹️
6:22 Mike… it’s two dogs.
That is a borzoi dog
I love your videos and u are incredible YouTuber and pls react to more medical memes if u laugh Sam can donate to any charity
Get a cat you have 35k likes so plisss get a cat
About the elevators: Bear can probably smell his own floor, that's how he knows which one is his.
Mike you should've taught bear how to fight so he could've turn the golden retriever into a boxing bag
I rescued my dog from Sean Casey Animal Rescue in Brooklyn and their volunteers are very good at matching dogs with people's personalities to the point it was like sorcery. As I was walking past the cages, the woman would say things like, "This one barks too much for you." I had no intention of getting a cat at that point but she steered me away from one that wasn't cat friendly and now I have a cat. She led me to the dog I wound up rescuing from there and he is my soul dog. I'll be forever grateful to them.
Can someone see how this combination is ? A handsome doctor and handsome dog 🐶😊😊
Bear is the CUTEST! 😍
There are brown cats but there very rare
I love bear's hairdo lol
Dr. Mike is correct about weiner dogs yapping too much. My upstairs neighbors have 2 of them and they let them sometimes yap nonstop for hours, even while they're home. Finally had to notify the landlady and she told them to put bark collars on them. The yapping isn't as bad as it has been, but I don't think they leave the collars on them all the time, since they still yap. Definitely the most annoying dogs I've been around and I love dogs.
Thank you so much for doing a bear video! He is the cutest thing and so sweet! And I would love to see bear get a kitty friend or another dog.
You need to get a cat
Gotta love that YouTube points out these dog memes are approved by a licensed doctor. I wouldn't know how to feel about these memes otherwise
James Cameron literally did an entire episode with Mythbusters where they proved to him that 2 grown men could have comfortably got on and fit on that door. 😂
IF HE CLIMBED THAT DOOR THEY WOULD BOTH SINK DUE TO OVERWEIGHT! SO PEOPLE SHOULD DROP THE DOOR ALREADY! XD As for the vomit part I stopped triggering myself. I have cats, and now I just gave up. XD
The trick is to get the heck away and bark
reminder to like the video to get bear a cat friend :>
hey Mike, I hope if you get the cat it will be a well thought-through decision. Bear is quite a giant and might attack a cat.
4:44 Bear does have a doggy door, it’s called a door.
Check out rocky kanaka he has a lot about dogs👌🏽  Love your videos Your doing great keep it up!
Introducing new dogs can be tricky... I believe most shelters know if the dog is social or not... but in my experience  some dogs can be very territorial and since Bear is a boy, getting a girl could be very nice. My Rot and Botinha thought me that lesson. I just love to see my two loners be so inseparable. They both have some anxiety but are very leveled when together playing and having fun 😊
What Breed is bear 🐻
dO tHeY mAkE bRoWn CaTs? Lmao
LOL I'm 174 cm (5,8 feet) in height and with 62 kg (124 lbs),  lighter than bear. 🤣🤣 But not as fluffy and not nearly as cute as bear.  suggestion for the organ merch. make a hoodie and make the background, out of the skin pattern, not black. place the brain on the hood and placing the organs as accurate as possible.
well the elevator story, is that bear knows the pattern :) <3  They haven't got the intelligence of a metal box taking someone up a level.
There was actually a Pound Puppies episode where the villain of the week replaced the main pup manager so they could clear up the pound. The villain made a bot system where he matched up the dogs with a human who looks like them, and there was Utter Chaos. Nobody liked it. It’s ALL about personality and demeanor!
i have a cat and she loves just finding a place that we like and sitting there and if she gets in a bedroom then she goes to the person she likes the most and just laying there
So cute :) are you planning some trips this year, where bear accompanies you?
Everyone like the video! I WANNA SEE A CAT!!
My dog hops up everytime he hears the click of my power button on my phone. 😂 he hops up assuming i’m about to take him out every single time.
It’s true he is huggable
Unsubing because of how dr Mike treats bear reguard8ng keeping him in the kennal unless Mike is actively playing with him What else is vear not allowed to get on furniture unless the camera is rolling? No water unless Mike is drinking at the same time? If he admits to abusing his dog in one way on camera, edits the video, still thinks its a good look, and publishes it still not accepting that abusing animals is wrong then there are other things he does for sure
For dog adoptions you should connect with Julien Solomita. He's a youtuber and does a lot of fostering through GreySave. I could definitely see Bear getting along with a greyhound, the breeds are pretty compatible!!
Great to see you and bear spending some quality time. If you get another dog I suggest getting a golden doodle.
I don't know if NYC has a Humane Society, but that is where my family has gotten our dogs. They give you time with the dog and you can look online to see the dogs they have. Then again, I live in Michigan, so this might not apply to you.
I love how mike just turns into a child whenever bear is around
we need 300k likes right   now!
See freedom street rescue in Houston.  I have a cattle dog that came from there and he is a spectacular boy.  They do a thorough evaluation of your every day life and determine if a dog is right for you.
4:00  Alright people!  300,000 likes and we may get a Bear cat 🐻😼
I'm sorry Mike but it sounds like you're saying yo only let your dog out when you want to play either them an i have to seriously reconsider my supporting you, that is disgusting, abusive, and sick let's hope you are a better doctor than you are a dog dad otherwise prepare for the malpractice suits
guys please like! bear needs a look alike cat! <3
LET ME DO IT FOR YOU DIDNT I DO IT FOR YOU KERMIE 🥺
your dog weighs as much as i do, thsnks for the bear content.
When you said « stick », my dog looked up at me, ears up and ready to go 😂! Proud dog mama of Hera the Malinois here🐕
Dog pick up way more on body language than most people. Bear knows it's not time to exit the elevator because you are not preparing to exit when you know it's not the right floor. He also might be able to tell it hasn't been long enough or can smell the ground floor differently but I think your body language gives it away the most.
I have all kinds of nicknames for my cat.
i want to see a brown pet cat for bearr

Rescue tips! I grew up with a bunch of rescue and foster dogs and this is my experience. I’d start talking to and building a relationship with a local rescue organization so that they can help you connect with a dog that will be a good fit in your home. It might take time for the right dog to pop up, but it’s worth the wait to hold out for the right one, because rescues can be just the sweetest most perfect addition to your household! A good rescue should also do a little background on you and do a meeting between the two dogs before sealing the deal. Sometimes they might have a dog in a foster situation who’s ready to start transitioning, and other times you might have to wait a bit. The other option is to try fostering, which can be a big emotional drain but gives dogs a place to be while waiting on their forever home, and eventually you could find the dog that is your “foster fail” and stays with you forever!
His name is so fitting 😂
I went on a walk one time saw a Newfoundland asked what his name was, that’s right his name was Bear. 🐻
Corgis are actually very athletic, you'd be surprise what those little legs can do !
Tip for Doctor Mike: You find your perfect rescue by meeting them. They know, and they will tell you. I used to think that was BS. Then it happened with me and my dog and I thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. But since then I've seen it happen over and over. The dog just knows. I've seen the most stubborn, ridiculous hound become a perfect angel the moment he met his forever family. A shy, timid momma's boy instantly come out of his shell when meeting his new parents. It's so hard to describe, but it's like they've known you all their life and have just been waiting for you the whole time.  If I had gone looking by *just* my set of criteria, I wouldn't have considered my dog. Sure, I had certain things I needed like grooming and size limits. But then I met her and she turned out to be my perfect companion. She just knew. I'm so grateful for the 14 years I got to spend with her. When you go to meet a new dog, listen to them. They will know if they are yours, and they will tell you.
3:01 Tell that to my 10 week old puppy. No matter what we do he hates his crate. He barks all night and shakes his cage. We had to start letting him sleep in our rooms or else nobody would get any sleep.  My older dog loved her crate! She adjusted so quickly to it (maybe a little over a week?) and would even lay in it during the day. We could even leave the cage open at night and she still wouldn’t leave it. Not so much the case with this guy…  Edit- So we gave it a good shot. We put him in the cage for several weeks but he never got used to it. On top of that he actually started trying to hurt himself (smacking his head against the cage, chewing the bars, getting his paws stuck in the door) so we ultimately made the decision to eliminate the cage for his safety. He sleeps in my parents’ room and we’ve slowly started leaving him alone at home in small doses. Things are much better with him now.
If you just add an s to explosive, then it changes the meaning of explosive (as in ready to explode), to explosives (as in a dog for finding/handling explosives). :)  Ain't grammar and spelling amazing?!! :D  Love Bear!! And you're ok too!! LOL!
Had a Newfie many years ago.  Loved him so much.  Such a great dog, and a best friend.  I will never forget him.
Lol, doctor Mike’s jokes are so underrated. I'm a sucker for dad jokes.
Bear is such a good floof!  My dog is a rescue, crossed boarder from Alabama (I'm in Canada) he was bigger than described and honestly, doesn't matter because he is the most cuddly lovebug.   It is hard when all you have to go off is a piece of paper and a photo but you'll know when you see the one.   When we saw Kodi's face, we knew he was the one.
I wish that I had a big sweet heart like bear
Please like the video for the cat pleaseeeeeeeeeee😘
Idk much about doggo adoptions BUT with bunny rescues they have the foster to adopt options as well as "speed dating" so you can make sure not only that your new fur baby is a good fit for your home but also that they're a good partner/friend to any current fur babies. Either way from what I know rescues always have fosters who know the pet's personalities and can guide you through the process of finding a new puppo.
If you need to put your dog in a cage to make him/her behave you shouldn't have a dog.  Dogs destroy things because they're stressed, and the number one cause of that is not enough exercise.
PLZ 300K LIKES!!!!
"It a whippet" -me who owns a whippet- "Wait whippets have fur?"
bear is sooooooooooo cute and funny !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
koof nicknane
Cats are better :D but i love dogs too :D
CAT! CAT!
I love Bear.
Those who know what "Jurrasic Bark" really means are shedding tears right now.
8:06 i call my dog elduchelora because my dogs name is duchess
There are brown cats, the havana brown. I am a vet tech and had to look this up years ago.
At the end of the video I thought bear was a blanket
Smashed that like button so fast to get Bear a cat 🐈
I mean Bear and dr Mike do look alike so 🤷‍♂️
If you’re getting a rescue my tip for it would be to hang out with it and play with it for like 5 minutes, and if you still can’t decide either spend more time or come back another day. I have a rescue and she is amazing, she does bark when she sees other dogs, but I think with that it was just her past.
Mike!!! I have a rescue dog, she is absolutely bonkers! There are some things I couldn't help her with, difficult fears that she still struggles with even after all the trainning, so we kinda learned to live with it as it is. I feel rescues have other kind of needs, yet she is cleverer than other dogs I had, as well as thankful and extremelly happy just "to be there" (literally she smiles and wags her tail just because I decided to open a window or something). However, I didn't get her by specifically looking that we matched. I've meet different dogs, and I turned to the "problematic" area, which was part of the rescue shelter where they had dogs that bite, bark, are sick, or very afraid. She lived with other dog and I played with that dog whereas she hid in the corner shaking. I thought the dog I was playing with would have more opportunities (she did, she was adopted two weeks after!) than the dog shaking, which was the one I took home. We didn't understand each other at all the first days, but I adopted her during summer so I had time to work through it). Right now I am the one who has sepparation anxiety, she takes care of my panic attacks, she learned where my asthma inhaler is and understands looks and signs as full commands mostly because our bond grow unbeatable. What I am trying to say is that in some cases, the bond is something that needs time, care and hard work, but when you finally have it is super precious. My dog grew up with other dog I had, a big big oldie that ate even the cookbooks, and he was the perfect lazy mentor ever. If you decide to get a rescue, I bet Bear would teach them every naughty trick. However, they are hard work even if you get them young and even if you have experience training dogs. Good luck and ey, thanks for your awesome vids!!!! I always watch, it's super relaxing and interesting. Hugs!
I need a part two to boost my serotonin levels, thanks doc
jack and rose couldve taken turns, or he couldve swam around a bit and found something else to float on after a load of people died off
If you ever consider having another doggo, try alaskan malamuth. Well ofcrse if you would like to have 1.
Hey Mike, long time watcher (many years) first time to comment. You mention looking for a rescue. I'd suggest looking into Helping Hounds there in NYC. They partner with a local rescue here in the DFW area called Love on Wheels in which dogs are rescued and shippped to places where they are more likely to be adopted. It's really a great program. If you need any contacts I could get you in touch with the right people.
ill be 30 tmw! so i guess id better give one of my digs anxiety tonight!!! hahaha XD
No other video except bear videos. Everyone plz like for bear getting a little sister, come on, it is now mandatory for us now.
As a god mother of a Corgi, Corgi's are very hyperactive dogs. They are herding dogs for a reason and it's fascinating to see why.
You and bear have the same hair color
5:21 my newfie  does this to when she gets very Roudy she jumps up on me shes full grown and im 9 not good for me
hes bread
Idk how Dr. Mike looks younger everytime he posts a video
dood corgies are not chill
Any animal we adopt, we meet first. And then we meet a few more and go based on those interactions. So many people see a cute picture online and just go get that dog/cat. We always do our research before going in, and then we ask a lot of questions at the shelter to not only be sure it's the right addition to our family, but also that we are right for the new addition. Both my fiance and I are allergic to cats, but some are worse than others (I'm sure it's the dander). We make sure we spend enough time with each cat that we'd hit our allergy cues or not. The last thing we'd want to do is take home and have to bring back to shelter. So much stress for the poor animal. We also have a 4 year old. We make sure she's there to meet the animal as well to see if they can handle her excitement and energy (she loves to play and hold them, and can have her loud moments). If we have another animal at the time, we have them meet. Of course there will be an introduction period at home if needed, but it's nice to get an initial reaction as well. For example, our dog is good with some dogs, but not others. If you get a cat (or another dog), just make sure you ask if they know if the new animal gets along with others and see if they will let them meet (not all places will allow).
Early 2hrs
Bear is so cute
I used to volunteer at a shelter and I think the best advice I can give for adopting a rescue is to visit and play with them (dog) a couple times to make sure your personalities align. THEN bring Bear and introduce them at the shelter. Most places have a little fenced in area for this. The dog introduction is the MOST important step that some folks often forget about and end up returning the dog when they realize it wasn’t a good match. Also don’t be afraid to return the dog if it doesn’t work out. Us volunteers ALWAYS preferred this to you & the doggos living in misery.
Adopt a cat from a shelter or one off the streets.
Okay so I'm recovering from a chest cold and was not expecting 2:40 and it about did me in 🤣🤣🤣☠ not tired of that meme yet
In my country it is illegal to crate dog without health reasons (= transportation or medical reason to restrict movement). Still it is possible to train dogs not to eat furniture.
10:53 actually Myth Busters tried proving this and they found that if Rose tied her life jacket to the bottom of the door, they both could have survived and the door would stay afloat!
Bear looks like a good boi
The middle of that diagram should be labeled "screamers."
Jim Gaffigan calls a muffin a bald cupcake
Noooooo i'm gonna cry bear is so cuteeeeee😭
OMG yes please adopt a cat 😍
Good friend ,nah Best friend
Bear needs a cat friend that looks like him
Yes, mike looks like bear. Don’t disagree, we all know it’s true
Bear is adorable dogs are so adorable. I do tricks with a dog and the dog is so happy whenever she sees me. A lot of dogs are so friendly.
Can't read/hear "Jurassic Bark" without thinking of Futurama.
I love Bear. He’s soo cute and makes me miss my Newfie. I think Bear doesn’t get off the wrong floor when the elevator opens because he senses it’s not right.😁.   All of my dogs were crate trained. As you know, dogs are den animals by nature so they enjoy having their own places.
See Bear, I click.
I don't think you break HIPPA, but if Bear relayed what you said to other dogs that are breaking HIPPA.
I don't know what it is. Whether it is a dog or cat, it is like some reflex. I could be in the middle of the deepest sleep, and as soon as I hear them staring to throw up, I shoot out of bed like a missile lol
Please don't get a cat! I don't want to like the video because I don't want you to get a cat lol
Let's get them likes Uppppppp
@GirlWithTheDogs and @DoctorMike collab = would be nice
I think bear would like having a pet cat for him.
i have a newfie and on the thumbnail i saw he is pure bread me n my head and he is pure bear
So surreal to see the fuckin FKA twigs Borzoi meme turn up in a Dr. Mike video 💀
Dear audience of Dr. Mike, Tap/click the like 👍 and help get bear a bear-cat I've done my part, have you?   - Sincerely, an aspiring crazy cat lady
React to Mr Beasts new video.
I am going to steal Bear and no one can stop me
For a rescue dog I recommend finding a rescue that’s foster-based. They’ll know their dogs’ personalities, needs, and preferred environments better than dogs in kennels or shelters. You can’t truly know a dog when they’re in a shelter environment, so a dog who’s had a chance to get comfortable in a foster home will be your best bet to know exactly who you’re getting and whether they’d be the right fit for your lifestyle :) Also, make sure you do a meet and greet with Bear at your home before you adopt. Some rescues/shelters allow you to do it where you’re getting the new dog (or don’t require it at all), but it’s most fair to Bear to see how comfortable he is with his new friend in his own environment. If they don’t ordinarily do it at your own home, insist on it on Bear’s behalf :)  I can recommend a great rescue in Buffalo and we’re willing to travel to you 😂
ugh, mike, saturated fat is not bad for you. the fat in those muffins isnt the problem, its all the fiberless carbs that are the problem.   you've been lied to by the government. you will find no peer reviewed study that cohesively proves that saturated fat and dietary cholesterol is directly related to heart disease.
The " pure bread " 😂😂😂
So we need to find a colab partner for Mike who can make a healthy, dog friendly nugget so we can see how many nuggets bear can eat.
I have a little wiener dog and Mike described her PERFECTLY. And she’s so sweet ❤️❤️
Mike looks like he's having a blast.  Bear looks confused but is going along with it because his human is happy.
@10:30 try VillaLobos Rescue Center.
bro yall getting 300k likes pls
OK, bear needs that pet bear cat.
Bear > Mike
Bear needs a kitten!!!
The campus police in the hospital I work at has a bomb dog! His name is Jester and he is the Very Good Boi!  He's come to see the hospital workers as his people, and if a stranger is being aggressive, Jester does a protecc and puts himself between the worker and the stranger. 🐕‍🦺🥰
300K LIKES RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW GUYS
about the titanic scene.. help me out. I remembre clearly a moment where they both try to get on the piece of wood and it sinks so Jack insists Rose should keep there. is it a mandela effect thing or was it cut down after the cinematic release?
I appreciate sam coming in with the:" lemme do it for you'
I love bear. He's amazing. I love dogs and cats ❤
bear is adorable, i just wanna hug him.
2:40 best part of the video
You look like bear
2:40
EVERYONE, LIKE THIS VIDEO. WE NEED A BEAR CAT.
So will you name the cat Bear?
Tip: Ask to have a meet and greet with the dog. They’ll take you to a small caged area where you can get to know the dog and play with them. If you don’t think the dog fits your interests you can always ask to see another dog. This also applies to cats(at least where I live).
Bear 😍laugh😍love them
At least Bear doesn't eat his vomit like my dog does.... like that probably came back up for a reason! Leave it alone!
As a mail carrier, I would not hesitate petting bear! He is adorable!
All my pets have been rescues and I let them chose me. Which ones I feel the most vibe with. Ask to take tbem for a walk and see how it feels.
im scared of dogs ESPECIALLY of BIG dogs and small dogs cause their just angry at anything
Hey Dr Mike! I love your videos! Imagine if Bear could be trained to do a dog version of “Bee-Whoop!” 🤓 From Ellie, Australia 🇦🇺
"Bear, look! It's a cone!"  Bear: 😴
Side note but James Cameron is acutely coming both with a documentary where he finally tests the theory on wether or not jack could of fit on the floating board, and is actually going to simulate the artic conditions.
Brown cats are SUPER rare! It would be really cool if you find one
Mike…what the heck do you keep tossing behind the couch…?? Bear-floofs?.
My grandmother raised dachshunds for 30 years. She had both standard and miniature breeds. So I grew up with so many of them. We had a pack of 26 puppies at one time. They were born within a week of each other. We lived on 110 acres, so We had plenty of space for them. I miss those days.. being tackled by 20+ Weiner dogs.
hi
I actually have a cat named Bear  He's a very lovey cat & very smart  Also very chill
I hope he really does get a cat.
I saw your c p r mechanism so cool
Bear looks so fluffy, Also if you were to get a cat, make sure that bear will be comfortable with the cat, Also I got three dogs, one is a Australian shepherd, the other two are Shetland sheep dogs, and one of the Shetland sheep dog is a 4 month old puppy
I want a dog like bear😞
How does it feel to know half the people in the comments are subscribed for Bear?
I wanna see Dr.Mike play amateur surgeon.
Nice video, very sweet dog but now I just want to vacuum behind your couch. 😅
Websites like howimetmydog and pawslikeme can help match you with dogs based on your personality
bear is so precious
First off, there definetly was room on that door for Jack to be on. But, as Counter Arguements pointed out, Rose should've stayed on that boat instead of jumping off and rushing back to Jack. Yes, it was a powerful scene of pathos but couldn't they have found another way for Jack to die that'd be unavoidable. Maybe have him be on the door with Rose but he succumbed to the cold weather. Or find a smaller door... Tangent aside, that one child grizlley bear you got there, Dr. Mike :) .
I just love Bear he deserves all the treats.
Hey doctor.. You should make a YT channel for Bear..
more dog vids please 😍😍😍
Let's start to like this vid....need to see a bearcat or beat?🤩
My American black lab is like bear. He freaks out when someone knocks on the door or rings the doorbell then when he sees the person he gets all aweet and lovey.
كم مخيف الكلب بير ويبدو الدكتور متعلق به جدا جدا وهذا التعلق لو كان متوسط افضل
Collab between Dr. MIKE and a Veterinarian, when? :D
MythBusters (I think, or it was someone else) proved that Rose and Jack both could have remained on that headboard. But, that is IF they tied her life jacket underneath the wood, so it'd remain afloat. But, idk man. It's a lot of extra work for two people suffering from hypothermia.
Yep, I think that's enough serotonin for the next 20 years...
Mythbusters proved that they both could have survived by floating on the door.  James Cameron is full of cr@p.
I recommend arf if you want a rescue dog because there are days where they put out all the dogs and alot of people come.
that's a borzoi and also let the doggo do it for you.
LETS GET THIS TO 300k :)
Corgi > cat
Bear, Brodie and Tucker/Todd collab. 🥰
Doctor Mike I have a rescue miniature pinscher and love her  The process for me was easy after I chose the dog I spent an hour with her testing her personality. She was actually traumatized by a male and was terrified of men. It took me a year of working with  her to desensitized her to men. She is the most loving dog. I have never regretted my choosing her.
Bear has to be so soft and snuggly
😂😂
This vid is adorable!
This is hilarious
You should collab with the Girl With The Dog up in Niagara Falls. She's a brilliant groomer and you'd be awesome together talking about Bear.
I have a corgi and most of the time, they are NOT chill
:3
You heard him people 300k likes and we get Bear a cat friend. Want to see a kitty blend into Bear's lushes fur? Yes you do.
e
cat
Its easy, Jack was a simp so he died for the. . .
I'm a dog trainer in training (weird I know) but I've trained over 5 show dogs. The reason Bear knows which floor to get off is your body language. Even if you aren't aware, your body makes adjustments and prepares to leave the elevator before the doors even open. Those slight things are indications for Bear to prepare for command (moving, walking, sitting, ect.) Your dog is very intuitive to you. It's actually a sign that he's constantly waiting for your cues.
My mia wasn't crate trained and doesn't eat the couch lol
If you do get any good tips and tricks for finding a dog that matches your personality, and can weave that into a video somehow (maybe about the benefits of companionship, or the therapeutic benefis of our furry companions or something), I think we'd all be very receptive to that.
Honestly the early on crate training does help tho
Worked in shelter and rescues for over 6 years!! Most people go and look for breeds, or colors, or age, but if you want to be 100% sure that you made the perfect match; go and meet them. Visit a shelter or a rescue facility, and meet the residents, then bring bear to see if they get along.   I've had people who came once a week for months to find the perfect partner! They were always my favorite people because I knew their babies were going to the best homes
LET ME DO IT FOR U -borzoi
BEAR IS SO CUTE!!!!💖🥰🤩🤗 AHH *dies of CUTENESS*
CORGIS ARE NOT CHILL
2:32 no it's a borzoi
Do they make???
You're so wholesome
7:17 yes dog's Doo sniff bums
cutest video on the internet
Bear is adorable!  All my dogs have been rescues, the best way to find a rescue is to call several differnt rescue organizations, go visit the dogs see their personalities play with them, and when you think you found one take Bear for the final approval. I will say the rescues I have had, have all been the best dogs I could ever ask for. Good luck with your search and give bear a hug from me.
OKAY get a cat and do a collab with Jackson Galaxy on introducing cat and dog
Bear just loves his daddy so much
Bear is so cute
I love dogs
Omg I love this video ❤❤❤❤  Soo relatable video for me 😍❤️ Bear is my favorite of Mike’s channel 🐶❤️  Fact: Bear make Mike so much more attractive 😍❤️ // Dog crazy(dog passion) person
You guys are an amazing couple! <3 And when it comes to rescue dogs, keep in mind they tend to take more of your time and might have unwanted behavior like eating your couch when you are off to work lol. And the last thing you want is to send a rescue dog back. It's hard for them to be rejected again, so be absolutely sure you can offer the dog what it needs. I am not sure about the US but in my country (The Netherlands) animal shelters usually have extensive profiles for the dogs and it's (special) needs. So if you find a rescue dog which suites your life, I'm totally convinced you will give it a great life! :)
I love the way Dr. Mike asked if they “make brown cats” as if they’re manufactured-
bring pamala back
Does anyone know how to exercise a dog who sleeps all day.
I hav a newfie to
guess i'll sleep later
SAFE is a rescue org that runs up and down the east coast check them out
At age 12 I had a cat, anxiety, and a cat with anxiety.
We need a meme with a newfundland wearing a lab coat saying “Hi, I’m dogtor Mike Bearshavsky”
My advice for searching for a rescue is to foster first! That's how I found my perfect doggo!
"You have cardiomywieneropathy" That sounds dirty.
He is the friendly bear🐻
Please consider rescuing your next dog! There are so many homeless dogs, you are bound to find a right fit for you. Fostering to adopt is a great way to see if a dog or puppy is right for you. Adopting an adult dog is a sure way to know what their personality is like. There are so many helpful rescues that take the time to find great matches, you just have to find one you like. ❤
I love bear, and you do kind a look like him only a little though
i love your dog he so sweet please make more vids with him
There is also a meme out here that I loved that was a border collie (my favorite breed I’ve ever had) working from home. He was in front of a computer screen with a bunch of sheep.
Love Bear, and love the relationship the two of you share.
Mike: wanna react to memes? Bear: Let me do it you!
My old man had a doberman that sounded like the most vicious monster behind a door. But as soon as the door would open he'd run off and once you were seated inside he'd immediately run over to try and cuddle up with you
"Do they make brown cats?"  Bro...
Absolutely adorable, but Dr. Mike I think you should definitely look up the definition of a boofer before you use that word 😂😅
My dogs are snoofers.   They're beagles
Sure they do Tortise shells(or torties) are brown black and tan. Be careful with a kitten  they can look brown and turn black thats how i ended up with two black cats thier baby fur was just much lighter.
I'm surprised that being a doctor doctor my didn't mention what that mismatched I thing is called heterochromia
do you realize how long you've  been teasing a cat??  IT'S TIME!! (please)
Get it your dogs perfect doesn’t need the couch is in good Weight doesn’t follow you at the door and E.C.D
Your dog is my favorite dog ever, i lost my dog but bears cuteness makes me smile
Like this video for cat
Can you do collab with @Doctor Er
Day 21 of posting this, please help Dr Mike to see it: I would love you to react to Downton abbey medical scenes, such as Roberts ulcer bursting, adrenaline being given to a farmer and Sybil's labour scene, it's so good and apparently quite medically accurate as well as giving an insight to old fashioned British treatments
In regards to a rescue dog, I would focus on personality. I thought I wanted a medium dog around 3 years old, but I ended up with a 65 lb 8 year old mutt. I absolutely adore my dog because her personality is a match. She is a wonderful fit for my home. Best of luck!
I'm not a dog person but dunno why I love bear so much. He's much more calm than my neighbor's dog. Such a cutie pie
Brown kitties do exist but they're pretty rare
If you want to rescue a dog you can try being a foster dad first, or research a breed and find a rescue that works with that specific type of dog online. Most will travel to you
Get him 300k
Because of you I'm getting a newfie 🥹 they seem so sweet and FLUFFFFYYY ❤️
"Do they make brown cats?" ....hmmm I didn't know cats were made!! 😂😂
Please Please Please get Bear a cat!!!
Aw, such a nice video. 🥰 But a dog licking a face is gross, look into it.  🤒
Its hard to find a rescue dog that immediately clicks with your personality! Often times it takes days or even months to bring dogs out of their protective shell that forms from past bad experiences. For example, one of our dogs, Shadow, was badly abused by past owners. She was anxious around men and could even get aggressive. But with a lot of work and consistent love, she became a happy and sweet dog!
You should get a main coon cat
nah fam I'm pretty sure they can tell its an elevator bc I can feel it moving up and down and they surely are more sensitive to movement so...
Bear is adorable as always and is completely zenned out during this whole video. I love it!
Re: Bear knowing which floor is the right floor…assuming the floors all look the same, the floor that isn’t yours probably doesn’t smell like your floor! I don’t know that for sure, but dogs do rely on scents a lot.
Doggo
i have a soft spot for mike's bear because i had a big 130lb german shepherd named bear <3 he had to be put down last year because of complications with his epilepsy but he was the sweetest, funniest, most adorable dog and he had the cutest floppy ears  :)
Okay, challenge accepted. 300k likes on the video. Do it, people! Bear needs a cat buddy.
Oh, okay, I see it now, I thought the muffins were results of an AI trying to draw a chihuahua.  So while the memes (mostly) aren't medical, we're getting some good medical information anyway. Nice.
OMG BEAR IS A HUGE BALL OF CUTENESS MY HEART CANT TAKE IITTTTT!!!
Bear is so cute!
Bear mohawk is epic
Bear is like 5 times bigger than you and acts like a fluffy little babee!
4:13 "they" don't make cats. no one MAKES cats lol
In Titanic Jack tried to get on the door with her, but it couldn't hold both of them so he told her to stay on it.
GET BEAR A BROWN CAT EVERYONE LIKE THE VIDEO!!!! GET IT TO 300K!!!!!!!!!
Quote of the day "Do they make brown cats"
Your concern about finding the right rescue dog is very common. The good news is that shelters and rescues (as far as I have seen) have people called adoption counselors. These people know the available dogs' personalities and needs and can match you with the right one based on what you share about your needs/wants/lifestyle. If none of the pups are the right fit, they may also provide a service where they record the info they've learned about you and then contact you when the right doggo comes through. If you are unsure that a dog is right for you, some shelters offer foster to adopt programs where the dog gets a break from the shelter and you get to see exactly what it's like to have them in your home. Also don't feel the need to adopt the first time you visit the shelter. Your perfect match might be there on your first visit, but they might not. Be patient, the right doggo is worth waiting for. And be prepared to need to do some reprogramming with your new pup. I'm by no means saying that shelter dogs automatically come with issues and bad habits, but I feel like most dogs aren't the perfect goodboy you have raised Bear to be. It is a very rewarding and well worth it process, just be prepared to need a little extra patience and need to spend a little extra time with the new addition. The shelter should be able to help you through the transition. That being said, many shelter animals are there through no fault of their own and have amazing socialization and training. I've had multiple shelter cats who have been perfect angels from the second they came home.
I want dog to now
Like now
«DO THEY MAKE BROWN CATS»💀✋
I'm in Toronto so it would take a trip but I got my rescue from Coveted Canines and they were super great at matching the dog to my circumstances. I have chronic pain and live in a tiny apartment so they matched me with my sweet Chihuahua mix (Mr. Darcy) who is incredibly quiet for a Chi mix and a snuggle butt who motivates me to get just enough exercise to keep myself healthy without aggravating my pain. Coveted Canines specializes in rescuing dogs from kill shelters (Darcy had three days to live which is bonkers to me because he's such a good dog) so you can feel good about rescuing a buddy who wouldn't have made it otherwise. Anyways, getting a rescue from Canada that was rescued from the USA or Mexico (kill shelters are mostly illegal here) might be a bit complicated so my advice is to check if the rescue you are looking at has a Facebook or Instagram or something so you can read what the clients have to say about the process.
Dr. Mike is cute, but bear is much cuter 🤗
Bear is super awesome, but I would love to see the combination and relationship between Bear and his feline friend ❣❣
The best Doctor on YouTube with Bear the dog, this makes me think I need to see my Cat
I like how Youtube says "From a licensed doctor" even though this video is about dogs and not Dr.Mike's usual medial content.
I watched your first video with Bear yesterday, it's so adorable 😍.
I've seen a dog take the bus so I think they do understand transportation. But an elevator hmmm
I always recommend going to local humane societies, or even breed specific rescues are great. Normally they have you meet the dog first and then have a 3-4 week trial period. All my dogs have been rescues and once you earn their trust they're the best dog you'll ever have
The fact that you said "Good friend" and not "Best friend" is very sad
Bear could wrap the world in his fluff
Ayyyyyyyy
Bear is the goodest boy 🥰
If you want to rescue but are worried about finding the right one try to find a local rescue that will let you foster to adopt. I’ve worked with rescue for well over a decade now & I recommend this to a lot of people!
How many likes to get Bear a kitten??
#getacat
You do look like bear!
I am convinced that Bear is a real person. 😂
Bro the dog looks so tired 😫  relatable
One of the most important things to finding a rescue dog that suits you is consider the increase in pet expenses, pet 1-1 time/management, and the 3-3-3 rule. 3 days of feeling nervous and adjusting to the change/shift in environment/rules/scheduling 3 weeks of settling into the new home and making a full environmental adjustment 3 months of building a trust and bond with you Of course there are exceptions to this rule such as the new pet has violent rather than aggressive behaviors and risks immediate harm to you or other pets. I always hope adopters will give the new pet at least 7 days. But a responsible shelter will have behavior tested their dogs for food or toy aggression(possessiveness) and marked them as [only pet] dogs. This doesn't necessarily mean they're bad dogs, because all dogs can be worked out of certain behaviors, but with how many pets cycle through shelters and considering most all of them arrive without background knowledge, the shelter doesn't have the time to invest in 1-1 training for each pet. A responsible shelter will also have both dogs meet somewhere that isn't your home prior to introducing the new pet to you and Bear's home. Regardless of if Bear is dog-friendly, the other dog may have anxieties when entering a home covered completely in the scent of another dog. This may cause them to behave differently than expected, but should be easy fixes if behavior is corrected ASAP.  Most of these things can be applied to a shelter cat if you end up sticking to that wager. I didn't mean to ramble, but I'm pretty adamant about giving shelter pets a good name and encouraging #AdoptDontShop   Good luck! Love you Bear!
Hes so cute! I wanna hug him 🥺🥺
I'm not a dog person, but this still warms my heart
What a handsome good Boi! You choose who I'm referring to..😉🙃
let's get that cat ✨🌈😻🌈✨ here is a like... nice shirt btw ...
I really wanted to drop a like but I don't like cats.
Lemedoitfouuuuuuu
My dogs name is Charlie and I call her chuckles, char wee wee, chuck, and my favorite, smooth and silky good girl
Let me do it for you when all I do is for you kurmie
Or it was your genetics Mike 💁‍♀️
How much can I give you for bear?
Get Bear a brown fluffy cat named Teddy!
I can't find the link for merch 😱 Can anyone help me?? I need that shirt!!!
I had a black Newfie as a child, she lived to 14 years of age, almost a record.
4:31 solid brown cats are extremely rare.  A genetic mutation found in Maine Coons more often than other breeds or mixed breeds.
0:11 woo
Bear is fucking amazing... I'm a big boy myself so bear would be perfect cuddle.
Bear is a bear
This is like the loveliest video on internet.
Bear looks smart like you so yes that's true dog owners look like their dogs or vice versa 🙂
i have 2 weiner dogs, one of them had 6 puppies
I have the exact same dog as bear
I only hit like because I feel like you would be one of the people who does their research and goes through the process of properly selecting a cat that will be predisposed to feel comfortable with a dog around and introducing them correctly. Way too many abandoned cats in the world because people didn't want to go to the trouble
Your floofenboofer looks like a borker. What a delightful fluffnugget he is. Tell Bear he's a good pupper for me.
People assemble and like this video so bear can get a bear kitty
Bear is awesome! Our current dog is a rescue, who was days from being put down...On his second trip to Death Row. He had known food and toy aggression issues, fence jumping proclivities and dominant energy. His gotcha day was about two weeks ago, marking two years we've had him, and he is one of the best dogs I've ever had. It took a lot of work to establish pack order and teach manners, and a lot of love to make him feel safe and part of the family. But, he is a fantastic dog, and we couldn't imagine not having him now.  Excellent video, as always, sir.
Mike your a doctor . Do they make brown cats ?
We need a Bear x Girl with the Dogs collab
Guys like the video NOW so bear could have a pet cat (300,000 likes)
I'm all for a little kitty for Bear <3
Hey Dr. mike can we get a video on chai tea and other similar milk based tea benefits/cons?
Make him healthy air fried doggy nuggets and fries
oh look it's the borzoi dog
I feel it! No matter how deeply I can sleep, when the cat throws up its hairball, I stand in bed like one.  Then I run and hope the cat didn't wet the carpet. 😂
Dr Mike looks incredibly huggable
At 2:37 the dog reminded me of the let me do it for you dog
I’ve worked at an animal shelter for about a year now and I love it. And honestly the best advice I can give you in terms of finding the best dog for you is volunteering enough to get to know all the dogs. Like I’ll be honest, I’m not a fan of volunteering myself (social anxiety, I’m lazy, and also don’t like people) but because I work there I have gotten to know nearly every dog. And you can’t always trust the staff to be accurate as much as I hate to say it. There are SO many dogs (and cats) I’d love to take home. Literally my fave dog rn loves other dogs but is aggressive with most people. Like same tbh 🤣
Wait! So rescue cat and dog? 😏 haha Honestly, there are many ways to approach the whole rescue thing. One would be finding a reputable rescue and contacting them. They usually know their dogs and can suggest one based on your lifestyle. (They might even make brown cats!) 😂
He looks like a little cute boy when speaks to her dog
My rescued 7 year old Corgi may be chill but she's full of zoomies and lots of energy. She needs sheep to herd!
10:33 Just visit a dog pound some of them let you interact and walk some dogs.
Your videos their relaxing and fun I like it
Aww he needs a a little bow tie on his head
My dog is a rescue and I think she choose me like they know what is a good fit. She is so compatible with me. So that’s my tip they choose you.
Yes, get bear a brown Main Coon 😆
Regarding Corgis: a friend of mine has one and her corgi is SO energetic. As in I'm pretty sure her dog is insane. So Dr. Mike, if you're wanting to get a calm dog to pair with Bear, a corgi would not be it. 😅
He’s sooo, super, amazingly adorable <3333333
This was very wholesome
‘’Hit me down below’’  - Mike, 2023
I volunteer at a pet rescue. You want to make sure that you find one that does dog-to-dog interactions before adoption. Most have trained staff that can see if any concerning behavior would be possible between dogs. It is not only about finding a dog that fits your personality, but one that also fits the personality of your other animals.
Damn it. You just ruined blueberry muffins for me. Lol I’m still eating them, just not as often.
lets like this video and give him the trouble of getting a cat XD
I have a corgi😀
1:00 not my uncle's dog that bit me for no reason
You are joining us corgi lovers ❤
dr mike: chihuahua -> blueberry muffin -> childhood -> HIGH CHOLESTEROL
*how would you like it if you had a parent or guardian or carer who you saw and loved as an equal family member to you but they just claimed to own you?!* And they understand everything and more than humans*
They’re are actually brown kitties, they’re kinda hard to get but that would be so cute u could name em cub. Bear and Cub 😭
What type of breed is bear plz answer
I like your videos, but they're even better with Bear! He's a giant, lovable ball of floof!
Its the doorbell
We gotta get that mini bear cat y'all
Memes + doggo = Views
I've wanted a dog for so long, and I can almost afford one.
editor knows his memes! 2:42
Dr.Mike I love your Bear. He is very 😍 cute.
"Do they make brown cats?"
Get this video to 300k as fast possible we need some chaos in this channel
I’ve never liked a video so quickly. Bear needs a cat friend.
I want to smush Bear soooooo much
Dr Mike never disappoints
I would never let my dog on my bed until he learns not to dig the mattress (hes 8mo old.) but I would let bear just have the bed and ill sleep on the floor.
Bear❤️❤️
About the dog vomiting as a alarm is so true even with cats a wake up fast to see where it is
Aww Bear looks so soft and cuddly 🥰😍 Lol If I had a dog like bear I would kick my fiance out of the bed to get Bear some space 🤣
He should react to gacha or smth. Ngl I think it would be HILARIOUS
DIDN'T I DO IT FOR YOU, KERMIE 🥺
I love your dog❤❤
bro asked if they make brown cats like they're made in a factory
I can see a cat coming💕
Dont get me wrong, i love bear.  But i miss Roxy :(
Guys 22k done..plz 8k more n we will get a bear-cat ...love it
Bear lives his best life ❤️
I’m glad this is from a licensed doctor or else I wouldn’t know if these are dogs or not
I had a German shepherd. She loved fireworks so much that she use to try and catch them. We had to keep her indoors
Hi Mike, long time corgi owner. Please don't get a corgi thinking they're couch potatoes. They're herding dogs and are bred to work in the field all day, so they have a lot of energy. I walk my current pup 2-3 times a day for 45 - 60 minutes a day plus play sessions in the backyard and she's still got energy to burn.
WE LOVE YOU BEAR 😁
His lil stick straight hairs on his head 🥺
Everyone like the Video
what type of dog is bear?
Mike: bear your a mix of boofer and a borker. Me: oh so he is a BORFKER
love bear
LET ME DO IT FOR U. And then the captions say “Mike’s lacking some TikTok trends” and that just made me laugh
You can always bring your dog to meet with your potential adoptee, and some places allow you a trial period similar to fostering. Just tell them your concerns about compatibility.
love you
bear looks like he has one more f**k and he's not giving it to NOBODY
Doctor Mike: Do they make brown cats Doctor Mikes mind: I said something that makes no sense Do people make cats!!!
Bear is the best dog ever :> Love your videos by the way
BEARRR🎉🎉🎉🎉 THE REAL HANDSOME MAN WE ARE HERE FORRRR 😂😜
Little dogs are only happy when they are allowed to be. Happy dogs are insecure and untrained. I've had 9 Chihuahuas and none were yappy.
I love bear so much! Seeing your videos made me realise that I want a Newfoundland when I get my own place. They’re so big and fluffy so perfect for cuddles!from what I read online they do make great therapy dogs because they’re very empathetic and affectionate. I’m autistic and I’m hoping I could get my dog trained and certified as a service dog. I feel like Newfoundlands are perfect for compression therapy in meltdowns or panic attacks because it’s just like a giant floof ball coming to sit on you
Okay but I would actually love it if you alternated between medical and dog memes regularly (maybe even sprinkling in some medical dog memes)
if I was rose, I would invite jack. living life without your true love after you found them, isn't the pain most want. live together die together
Bear it’s my dream dog 💕💕💕 he is soooo cute! !
Be the kind of person your dog thinks you are.
My dog is a rescue, and he’s possibly one of the sweetest dogs I have ever owned. (Besides my Frenchie Henry Hopper who passed away when he was 16) Bear is honestly adorable
Bear is the only therapist I need
What's the dog breed that's next to the snowdog?
i watched this with both our dogs and one laid his head on my keyboard backing the vid up. for where to get a rescue with the right personality, we just go to the local shelter and let the dogs decide. it has worked out good so far we got three good dogs the first time and two good dogs the second time. bear is incredibly cute as well.
My thoughts if rose pushed off a hypothetical 3rd person: “Cleva gurl…”
I wonder what kinda breed bear is. Ma boi is so big now. ❤ N he can high five❤ And also,i don't think getting another pet will be ideal cz they tend to get jealous when a new pet is brought in....but hey,not every pet does that and maybe bear will actually like it n become best friends.
Bear so cute.
Most rescue animals are mixed breeds
I grew up in Newfoundland but my name is not Bear. 😉
Bear leg ok?
What a wholesome video, Bear is so handsome.
Muffins are cupcakes without the makeup
Brown cats are actually INCREDIBLY rare
I have a corgi and they are not chill
bearrrr❤❤❤❤
🥰I love Bear I got so excited to see him again, he’s so cute!🐻I got my dog Scrappy through a friend of my mom’s friend and he was 2 and a half and now he’s eleven. He’s a Yorkie Pomeranian chihuahua mix and he’s bigger than you’d expect he is small 18 lbs. He barely barks but when he does it is louder than expected.I love my dog he is very sweet and quiet, all he wants are belly rubs and treats.❤Can’t wait to see more Bear 🐻 and as always can’t wait to see Doctor Mike.
when I watched this at my tv at my living room when my dog saw bear she just barked so aggressively like if bear was actually there 🤣
OMG cat for bear will be so fun
You should see five nights at Freddy’s injury’s, some of them are cruel.
Would love to see Bear on Girl with the Dogs channel, getting groomed. Get his grinch feet tidied up. ❤
If I couldn't see Bear's face, I would've thought Mike had a fluffy blanket on the couch
Me and bear are from the same Canadian province
People say pit bulls are the meanest dogs and will attack you, but tbh they're pretty chill and overall goof balls. It just depends on how you raise them. We rescued a brindle Pit bull we named Bella and she is a sweetheart(though she hates anything thats loud like a vacuum or lawnmower), we also kept three of the 8 puppies she gave birth to at our house, we have no idea who the father is but we suspect its a great dane, cause one of the pups(now 8 months old I think), looks like a Dane mix, with long lanky legs to prove it(we also have an old golden retriever, Wilbur, and a beagle pit bull mix, Jasper).
Bear is the definition of big on the out side but soft on the inside ❤❤❤❤

The meme with the weiner dog as the heart is me! I love dachshunds! My baby girl passed away in 2018, and I've never been the same. 😔 We looked alike too!
Lovely ❤️
Best advice I have for you is sign up to foster. That way you can see personality first hand, in your own home and see how Bear is with them. If that one isn't the right match, wait until it gets a home and try again
I want Bear to get a cat 🥺
well,i would say to get another bear but i think its  gonna be an overload of cuteness
I'm a "give me all that slobber" kinda girl and I'm not even sorry 🤣❤️
I just want to say you have nice hair

Petition for Doctor Mike to make a YouTube channel just for bear
Video title should be: Bear just putting up with Mike’s shenanigans for 11 mins and 40 seconds 😂
Greyhounds! Chill dog and many to rescue with less health issues than other pure breeds!
I'm a groomer and these were hysterical! You should check out Jaunceydev if you havent seen any of his videos. He acts like different dog breeds. Hes always spot on too. Also the one dog was a Borzoi.
You need a wife and some babies
Contrary to popular belief, Corgis are extremely athletic! Mine is 3 years old and she can run circles around me and needs CONSTANT walking, its something that a lot of people don't know about corgis for some reason. They were bred for herding cattle so they can be a lot. My vet says a lot of corgis are overweight because of people not knowing how much activity they need when they purchase them. Sort of crazy and I never knew until after getting mine.
Doctor Mike and Bear. The world's cutest duo
Is that iPad Pro ??
Sorry drinker, they absolutely remember negative things
Growing up I had a dog named Bear and we used to call him BoBo
Dr. Mike, you should react to Mr. beast
5:17 if you look at his finger he is flipping us of 😂
Aaaaaaaaaah how is Bear so cuteeeeee?

we need bear to have his own show lol. The both of you are so cute! It is so refreshing to see a relaxed duo.
I don't think 300k is hard tbh.
I have a Newfoundland dog also. Her name is Ellie and we’ve had her for six years. She’s the most lovable dog ever. I think she and Bear would get along very well. Both love their families.
Just a heads up... Corgis are very much not chill dogs. They were bred to herd. They're pretty high maintenance.
A nice change to usual content and good comrade
Dachshunds are also highly aggressive to other animals, and will even kill their own young. Beagles are kinder and gentler, but a single doctor’s schedule isn’t conducive to a beagle’s needs.  It’s not just muffins. All pastries will have that level of crap. I’m not all too worried over saturated fats in the right amount, it’s trans and triglycerides you really need to be careful of and watch your starch/simple carb/processed carb intake. Ideally, we eat what grows, animal and plant, and that’s it.
Ah, glad to see the borzoi memes becoming mainstream. Silly big snooted wolf killers 👌
“I love wiener dogs” me too!!!❤
Say yes to soundless vaccums.
OMG, My coworkers and I debate all the time whether talking to your pets about patients is a HIPAA violation. 😆
Bears was not welcoming them, he's patting them down!
When it comes to rescue dogs, a pro tip I'd give would be to be prepared to have that dog cling to you and be more shy and scared around you than Bear. I used to own a rescue who was abused by his previous owners, so just take extra precaution and take it nice and slow with a rescue to ensure they're comfortable around you. It also depends on their past history and current conditions, but I think having a rescue at least once is what everyone needs.
he straight up asked "do they make brown cats?"
Bear is so cute!
Woof
Bear: "woof!"   Adorable! ❤️
Don’t get a corgi, they have so many health issues & their expensive in food and to buy.
I thought you’d at least come close to 300k.  But I think Bear is good as an only child
i'm sorry Doctor mike you did bear so wrong when you put his hair up like the trolls i was wheasing-🤣😀
Doctor mike Is it unhealthy if I have stomach acne
In terms of finding a rescue that matches your personality: My biggest advice is time and research! Start following local rescues near you on different social media platforms and check their available dogs regularly. They’ll generally have descriptions of their personalities. Once you feel like you see a dog you’re interested in, you can schedule an appointment to go meet them in person. This process may take more time and patience than just purchasing a dog, but its so worth it. I got my soulmate Buddy (a german shepherd) this way, and we were practically made for each other.
I was expecting at 2:31 the meme, did not disappoint 😂 #mimidoitforyou
GET A BROWN CAT PLZ
Go through a rescue that uses fosters to home their dogs. You’re able to know and understand what the dog’s personality is like at home, because a dog’s personality in the shelter may not reflect how they actually are. I’ve always gotten my dogs through rescues and they’re the best! It’s nice because you almost never have to worry about potty training as long as you don’t get a newborn puppy.
Brown cats exist! Look up chocolate British shorthairs.
So why do they give muffins to patients at the hospitals so much blueberry at that
Consider maybe a dog that is being fostered? The foster parents can tell you about their personality and habits.
03:33 meanwhile me about to take another bite of my muffin 💀
"didnt i do it for you?"

Doctor Mike is from Russia and he didn’t know the RUSSIAN BREED OF BORZOI?? 🤔🤔😂 Also I would say if you don’t want your dog to eat the couch or other items, is you give the dog appropriate things he *can* chew because dogs natural instinct is to chew. By giving them things they can chew, you will avoid the dog chewing on other things, then you don’t have to “correct” anything. Prevention and management is way better than trying to just train them not to do things ;)
i love your videos but maybe you could lift up some of the text on the bottom because if you are watching with subtitels the texts are covering each other.
BEAAARRRRR.. I want a newfy but I have 100lb golden so... might get a boxer for my golden though
you said you want your next dog to be a rescue, and its amazing, but.... my dog is a rescue too, she just turned 1 this month, but she is so incredibly reactive, and a lot of rescues are reactive. rectivity takes a lot of work, ive tried training my dog as no one else will do it, but lets be honest, a 13 year old with anxiety + a reactive 1 year old dog with anxiety doesnt go well together. all im saying is, being able to recue is great, but keep their possible problems in mind (also their health!)
LETS GOOOO
Bear is definitely in the Gentle Giant category
Newfies. The biggest lap dogs.
I LOVE BEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💖💖💖💖💖❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖❤💖❤💖❤💖💖I love him❤💖❤
I wouldn’t say you look like him.  But you definitely have similar personalities lol.  I hope you both have a good day!

Tip for adopting is go to a few shelters and look at all the cute doggos! Hard to go through there without finding a couple that you would take home.
How old is bear?
Cardioweineropathy 😆
You do look like your dog, Mike These are all great facts
Dam bear just deals with the amount of petting
Man I love Borzoi's, they always do it for me. Such weird and cute animals.
Try having 7 dogs that don't shut up
I have a rescue, and she was complicated for a while. Her anxiety and isolation distress were awful. She's great now and worth the problems, but it was touch and go for a while. not every rescue has such significant issues. You can always meet the dog a few times before and have a trial run at your home before taking on a rescue
You don’t look like Bear but you’re both a couple of handsome guys!!! I love when you have Bear in the videos, he’s so cuddly!!!💜
What's the music called?

Yes!! You should definitely get a cat that looks like bear. Although there might be some problems... What if the cat blends in bear's fur-
FYI a corgi is not a chill dog lol they’re herders which means high energy and high anxiety. If you want a chill dog, get a pug.
2:40 it’s everywhere now 😭
As the owner of a 14 and a half year old corgi I can confirm they are not chill 🤣 He still has lots of energy and barks endlessly, but is very loyal and snuggly
2:40 I love the memes with this sound 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You don't look like your dog, but you fit together very well.
Yeah, get a brown cat, take them both to a park, shove the cats head in a red paper cup and make bear rescue her while you take a video of the whole scene. Post it on reddit with the caption "cat stuck in cup until doggo helps".
Wholesome 😊

If you want to find a rescue dog that fits your personality, you can volunteer at a shelter for a day. You will spend a lot of time with all the dogs, feeding, walking, playing, etc. You are helping the shelter at the same time. Just a thought.
i love bear so much T-T

Yes brown cats do exist. However brown is one of the rarest colors in cats. I personally own one.
How have I never heard this big boy make such a small sound before?

If you're going to get a rescue dog,  first and foremost you would want to introduce Bear & the rescue. Sometimes it is necessary for the dog being brought into the home with Bear to stay in a cage for a day or 2 so they can get familiar with each other. Presently, I have 2 dogs from shelters and 1 we found on the streets during the pandemic and nothing compares to saving a pet more than the thousands I've paid in the past for a dog. Oh, I've had 1 female dog in my entire life (childhood too) & in my experience STAY CLEAR! Hope this helps 😁
ILOVE BEAR and 1 hour ago
I want that pet cat
I want a dog like bear
We have 2 horses, a dog, a cat, and had a bunnie. Everyone one of them were either drop offs, or rescued. A horse? Yes, people moved away and left their horse.  His name is Chance cause he got another with us. We are living happily ever after!
about only remembering the best in people… my dog, stanley (some kind of basset hound mix, we aren’t sure) holds grudges. my dad picked him up once and stanley didn’t let my dad near him for a solid month.

Yay! Bear
Hey Doctor Mike, I know you live in the states and I'm from Ontario, Canada but I'm hopeful that you have a similar organization near you. When adopting our rescues, we visited our local shelters (ASPCA I think its called down south) but had our best success with a place called Dog Tales in King City, Canada.  They rescue dogs from around the world, including from the Miami-Dade shelter in Florida.  To adopt from them requires a bit of time on the person's part as they make sure the dog will be happy and successful in your life.  I'm sure similar organizations exist in your home state, that can provide a similar adopting experience. Its very important to get to know the rescue through multiple visits, walks and by speaking with the dog's trainer and/or foster-person about their personalities. Its so sad when people bring a rescue to their homes based, usually on the dog's looks or breed, then return them to the shelter a day, week, month, or year in the case of my husky mix later, because they didn't behave as anticipated. Breed makes up part of how they might behave, however their past experiences and individual personalities are more of an indicator of how they will fit into your world. When you are planning on getting a fur friend for Bear, I'm sure you will bring Bear for his input on each prospective candidate. Wishing you and Bear a healthy,  happy 2023. 🤗🇨🇦
10:09 taking an NSAID after excessive drinking is not something you should do. Your liver will not be happy. I wish people were more educated on these things, it's important.
Just a beautiful adorable Bear Pup 🐻 he is so calm and chilled and Love your Casual Relaxed Vibes  Dr Mike,  just a Man with his Dog 🐕 would love to see Bear with a Cat 🐈 as a friend or a Bulldog also just chilled lazy and slobbers everywhere 💜

Like and let's get bear a pet lion
Well boys, let's get that pupper a kitty
Bear is so cute i'm dying:(
We need more Bear memes
All of the dogs that I have had have been rescues. You should totally adopt instead of shop! Most adoption places will let you (and your other pet) spend time with different dogs and chose the dog with the right energy level, temperament and personality. Plz adopt Dr mike years down the road with your new best friend you will still feel the satisfaction that you rescued a dog that needed a home. ❤️🐶🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺🐾🦴
Dr Mike "Meme?" Bear "No, mlem!"
Come on 300k likes!!!
More Bear videos please❤ He is so cute.
Doctor Mike has been teasing us w getting a cat so many times it's starting to feel like that trick owners play on their dogs when they pretend to throw the ball while playing fetch 😭
the dog you rescue will adapt to your habits
6:25 i think they are 2 different dogs on different sides mike
I used to have a weiner dog (he was a corgi\dachshund mix) and he was an absolute asshole to me, no matter how nice I was being to him. But he was an absolute sweetie to cats. He adored them
Totally get a cat! 🥰 Cats rule, dogs drool!
We MUST get Bear a cat guys!!
I've adopted a few rescue dogs and now volunteer as a foster (and just joined the board!) of a nonprofit animal rescue. I think the best way to find a good fit for you and Bear is to find a rescue that keeps their animals in foster homes, so you get a much better sense of their personality and quirks vs. in a kennel environment where most dogs are stressed out. You can do meet & greets with the foster & rescue dog with Bear to see how they interact and even try a couple home visits. Most rescue dogs need a few weeks to settle into their new home, but most are so happy to be in a safe place they end up being great dogs!
Bear is one of if not the calmest big dogs I’ve ever seen. Always surprises me that the big dogs are calm and the little ones are yappy.
Honestly the "muffin" dog meme low-key triggered my trypophobia 😅
When I was 30, I had a cat, anxiety, and a cat with anxiety.
What type of dog is bear?
Corgis are not chill dogs lol. They're sheep herding dogs!
0:02 bear: memes?
I absolutely adore Newfies! My family and I are considering getting one soon. Bear is absolutely adorable!
Me with my dog watching Mike with his dog watching other people's dogs
I think you should start thinking about that cat 🤔
Bear is so chill 😎
I've been volunteering with an animal rescue group for ~25 years. My number one tip for finding the right pet -- dog, cat, etc -- is to find a rescue group that keeps their pets in foster homes. That way, you can talk to someone who has lived with that pet and knows what they're like in a home environment. Also, see if you can do a trial visit with the pet you like. Our rescue does what we call a babysitting period: the pet stays with you for two weeks, so you can make sure it's the right fit. If at any time you decide it isn't, we take the pet back and you can try a different one (or decide not to adopt at all, no pressure). But if you decide that it's the perfect fit, you fill out the adoption paperwork and pay the adoption fee then.   We're also always available if our adopters need advice. And we encourage them to contact us for help sooner rather than later. It's easier to fix a problem when it first starts than it is if it's been going on for months.
I thought the Jack and Rose story was real for the longest time.
To be fair - Bear looks like he eats anxiety for breakfast!
BEAR NEEDS A FRIEND
What I wouldn't give to have a dog like Bear. He is just so incredibly fluffy and adorable!
Wow Bear the kind of dog that you just have the urge to give a hug.
Aaaaa so cute like a stuffed animal
i too like bear.. am trying to lay my head in dr.mikes lap
Why would a golden retriever hurt bear? I have two and they are the sweetest
Dogs are the best 💛
just a couple of best friends in this video ♥
Dr mike reviewing mems is the best, but with bear??!! It reaches a whole other level of cuteness and energy. Best duo ever!!!
The Borzoi memes have found their way into every part of my life at this point.
The one with the dog with his head in the wall is just two dogs.  One is on a table or something behind the wall, and the other is sticking his head in it.
Corgies are much higher energy than newfoundlands, they are hearding dogs.
As bear so cute
Cardio my wiener what???
Bear probably can tell what the right floor is by smell. Dogs sense of smell is so good they can tell time with it, by tracking the dissipation of scents in their environment. I'd imagine every floor smells slightly different to a dog, because they smell so much more than we do.
Lovin' Bear's floofy hair style.
Yes, dear Mike. Your hair is slowly beginning to look like Bear's fur. it's adorable btw.
🤣🥹🥹🥹🤣
i need to know bear’s breed😭 if literally anyone knows pls tell me
“Bear look it’s a cone”
I WANT BEAR.
Make a channel dedicated to Bear and videos with him.
Bear is adorable and so is dr. Mike so you guys do look alike in a way
I didn't have to crate train my dog. I adopted him from local humane society. They estimated he was about a year old.  My dog is named Idaho and I call him spud, spudly, potato and stinky. I use his real name maybe 10% of the time.  I think bear knows which floor to get off because he can smell home and other familiar scents.  My dog has 1 blue eye and 1 brown eye. He's a mutt but mostly amstaff, samoyed, blue healer and chow. I had him DNA tested through wisdom panel.
I love bear
Yep
I just want bear. BEAR IS SO CUTEEEEE kisses anyone lol
Keith Olbermann is EXTREMELY active in NY dog rescue! Bet he'd help you find the perfect organization to get the perfect rescue dog!
Pure bread dog is a borzoo
They do. Our dog Kujo is a chuweenie. He has a great personality and loves to play with the cats
I really hope the 300thousand likes would be reached (I did my part) - I wanna see that tiny kitten getting lost in Bear's fur & playing with his wagging tail. And cats are soooo cooooool. :3
yall better like this damn video  😿
We NEED more bear videos
plz get cat
aww I love Bear!!!!
Bear and mike have the best bond
you do have a lot of hair
2:40 was thinking about that TikTok trend when I saw it. Even said it myself. Love it.
Bear weighs more than me lol
9:50 I'm pretty sure dogs are able to sense the elevator car accelerate up/down, and thus understand the tiny room is just moving them from one spot to another in the same general area.
Too cute
I've come to the conclusion that my orange Maine Coone would be the best guard cat... He's so handsome and sweet... He greets every person that comes in. The robber/murderer would be so distracted by Buccee's kindness that he'd change their whole plan
Do they make cats in brown? ...Mike... "they" don't "make" cats, they kinda do it themselves 😂❤️🐈🐈‍⬛🐱🐕🐶
BEAR NEEDS A CAT!!!
Mike get ready to get a cat...
I fell like owners often act/ look like their animals. I took in a random cat and never knew what kind of personality she would have, so it's funny when my friends point out to me she acts like me. I'd love to read some more about it, is it unconscious that we choose animals that fit our lifestyle/ look? Are animals very adaptable? Or is it all just accidental? Though I *love* the thought that they just are like our family and friends, the more time we spend with them - the more alike we become. :) *Have a nice day everyone!*
Bear 🐻❤️
Also be careful with ibuprofen because it's toxic to dogs
I unload on my dog all of the time when I have anxiety or if I’m sad… it doesn’t matter to her to her though because she is deaf so she usually falls asleep half way through and then my feelings get hurt 😂😂😂
I just think the dog doesn't go out on the wrong floor because dogs don't go when their owner doesn't either
Well good morning Mike! How are you doing? Im pretty good so far! Tysm for making this amazing video! Love you Mike❤
Dauschands are ASSHOLES!! 🤣🤣
hi
Ah, he's so beautiful. I had a newfoundland growing up, he was the alpha from youth and never let anyone near his food, human or animal, but my little toddler self would sit and eat his food with him. We were homies for 14 years. He was white with black patches.
Guys plz, i need him to get the cat
Me and my mother rescue animals, we have 8 dogs and 4 cats right now about. Most rescues have a website were you can see the animals they have and a description of them. Then when you want to adopt they set up visits with the doggo to see if they will get along with you and adapt. Theres also usually a way for you to take the doggo back because sometimes it just really doesnt work out for one reason or another. We had a dog we rehomed that lasted one day because overnight in his kennel he wouldnt let anyone else opwn it
I love Dr. Mike so much. How does he always make us smile?? I love his dog, Bear as well.. AWE!!
I just wanna cuddle with Bear. That's it. That's all.
Let’s just raise the likes so he actually gets a cat
Bear 😍😍
Didn’t I do it for you
If you find the time it would be great for the dogs if you would reach out to local animal shelters and make a video encouraging people to go to their local shelters to adopt dogs most shelters are full and having to euthanize dogs because they don’t have the space for them perfectly healthy loving dogs killed because no one will adopt them. I have two rescues I wish I could get more but that’s my limit I’m physically disabled.
My lil lion cub, Samson, lives outside, so he's not around people that often. He'd have to see you and get to know you several to a bunch of time, first. He's a sweet cuddly feller once you get to know him. :)
Bear is bear
My black cat looks like a bear cub.  There is nothing that wakes me up and gets me out of bed faster  (despite being bed bound due to disability/chronic illness/chronic pain) than one of my cats puking or having a hair ball. Especially because it’s usually on my bed!  I used to have an old English sheepdog. She was the cutest dog I’d ever seen. So well trained, but not very bright. Super happy though, she’d prance around on her walks and walk into parked cars or trees or stop signs. Hehe
10:05 Wrong smell.
better than labs, eating their own puke then throwing up again and eating again
I love bear 😍🤪 he’s so cuteeeeeee
The blonde dog with long fur looks like an afghan hound.
5:00 since you don’t wanna have a dog that’s overweight what’s the optimum weight for a daniff
Get this man that 300K like
New Series 🤔🤨
Bearrrrrrrr!!!! We all know who we really  came here to see.
cat and dog
Brown cats are rare, and I think you should get one
I got my dog a cat because he has major separation anxiety :)
I originally read “Reacting to Dog Memes with my New Wife” and I was like WHAT?! 😂
Cupcakes are a little snack, muffins are like the daddy bears of cupcakes
OMG I think Dr. Mike would be a great cat dad, as long as he understands 6 things:  1) DON'T TOUCH THE BELLY! Cats show their bellies to people as a sign of trust, not because they want you to touch their bellies. Only touch their bellies if you want to get scratched[or you have a cat that actually likes belly rubs].  2) Dogs wag their tails when they're happy, cats wag/thrash their tails when they're agitated. That's when you back off and leave them alone otherwise you will get scratched[or bit].  3) Open mouth breathing in cats is considered an emergency because healthy cats only breathe through their noses. If a cat is breathing through its mouth it means that it's either sick or extremely stressed.  4) cats are crepuscular, not nocturnal. Crepuscular means they're most active at dawn and dusk. Also cats have pro-tractable claws, not retractable claws.  5) Declawing is cruel and inhumane. It shouldn't be called declawing, it's actually "de-knuckling" the cat. And it will make them more aggressive because you took away their primary defensive weapon.  6) Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need meat to survive, and as such they cannot live on a vegan diet. Even so-called "vegan cat food" that is supplemented with Taurine and other essential nutrients isn't good enough because a cats body[from its teeth to its digestive system] has evolved to living on a meat based diet and simply cannot digest large amounts of plant material.
we need a brown kitty, theyre always the prettiest
Find a local dog rescue and ask to foster - this way you are giving a dog a temporary home while awaiting his adoption and you can see if bringing in another dog Is a good fit. You can always foster fail. Most reputable rescues though will be upfront and work with you to find the dog that best fits your lifestyle and personality.  I have two dogs from a rescue and one from a local shelter :).
Almost an hour ,late 😭
DR. MIKE CORGIS ARE NOT CHILL
Dr Mike , i am your biggest fan , i wanna know that what are you're thoughts about Mr beast funding 1000 people's curable blindness?
everyone like the vid for a cat
Honestly would love more Bear content 🥺
Like the video!
Cardio-mywiener-opathy has definitely been used before in another context
4:30 i work with dogs, corgis are NOT chill dogs, they are insane herding dogs like border collies, and Aussie shepherds.  They are some of the most insane dogs at daycare
Beeeeeaaaaarrrr!! 😃
Totally living vicariously with you cuddling with Bear. Lost my 14-year-old dog November 2021 and I miss her so much.
Bear!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤your so cute 😊.
I have a Newfoundland Paramese mix  What type of dog is bear?
the reason bear do not try to leave the elevator on the wrong floor can be due to visual cues and smells or just he might not start moving until you do as he seems like a very laid backed dog
i just woke up and seen this video. i feel energized now
It's all Dog isn't it
Man you gotta send your dog to The Girl With Dogs. His socks are Overgrown 😭
Get the cat
Y'ALL BETTER BE SMASHIN THAT LIKE BUTTON. If Bear doesn't get a new cat friend, I'm gonna be so mad at y'all.
Well, to be honest, a doggy door for Bear would be just a regular door!
I will never be able to NOT get a newfie. Our boy weighs in at about 170 and forgets that he’s not a lap dog😭 bear is so so handsome
As someone who's had shelter dogs her entire life: A lot of good shelters and organizations will be happy to work with you in searching your next companion.  I reach out to them, explain my situation and what I'm looking for in a dog (before I even go and see the dogs they have!) and then they will either suggest a dog who will match with what I've described or not. A lot of organizations also work with foster families and they can provide an even greater in-depth picture of their dog's personality.   When you get a puppy from a breeder; even the best breeders in the world; you also wouldn't know what their personalities will be like, right? With shelter dogs, you will already get somewhat of an estimation like wether or not they are friendly with other dogs or if they have separation anxiety or if they have medical issues, etc.   I would strongly advise everyone N O T to go and check out the dogs in their kennels beforehand. I really wouldn't. Why? Because it is a stressful environment for these dogs and they will absolutely not be acting the way they truly are.  (Edit: Loudly barking dogs are likely just stressed out and so don't give a good first impression and are therefore not given a fair chance! After all, how many of you have fantastic family dogs who also bark at complete strangers approaching their territory when they're by themselves...?)   Best to find a match by talking to the staff and ask if you can meet the dog in a separate room; as most shelters do have that option.
Bear is one of those dogs which look like they could kill you, and will. By licking you to death. P.S Can we get more bear please?
well mythbusters tested the Titanic thing and yes they could both survive
I know everyone says that both people could fit on the door in titanic... but idk if anyone thinks about the bouyancy of the door. More weight could just sink the door... least I think so
hiiii!! i got into an Intro to Health and Medical Science class because of you! i’ve been watching you since i was in 7th grade and now i’m a sophomore in high school!! you were the reason i wanted to take medical classes, and i thank you a lot for that!
Here's a question, Mike --- When bear was just a cub, did you know his breed well enough to realise he'd grow into being such a BEAR? Or did you just name him Bear and got lucky as he grew older?
alright everyone we need to get this to 300k
Sometimes I cant get the difference between bear and the couch
Did you just yeeted randomly Bears fur behind the couch? 😂
Alternate title: "Bear being the best Newfie for 11 minutes and 40 seconds straight". I love it so much💕💕💕💕💕💕
new video😃🤣😂
Most shelters/rescue orginizations let you do meet and greats with animals so you can see how compatible you are.
I like the caveat “ consider” definitely a doctor answer
Look into breed rescue
❤❤❤
Bear is such a sweet dog. I live with my mom and step dad, and we've got two dogs (a jack russell named Floyd and a shi tzu named Roscoe) and three cats (one of which I brought with me when I moved back home, who is my baby, whose name is Nova). Nova is a Siamese-tabby mix. Technically speaking, she's a black cat. But where she's part tabby, she looks kinda brown in the sunlight. So there you go, Dr. Mike. A brown cat! Himalayans are kinda brown-ish looking too.
hiya Bear. How's Roxy?   my sister has a wiener dog. he's a little fart but he's a good boy
we need to see Dr. mike with a cat!!! its not a want its a need 😩🤞🏼
You're ALMOST as cute as Bear!  I vote fur the cat! And there are brown cats-- Burmese!  And brown tabbies.
Almost 8k likes at only 45min. Love seeing Mike's love for bear! 😄🐶🐻 (ps why do I have only 3 dog emojis but dozens of cat ones?)
🐶🐶🐶
2:40 I was singing it as SOON as that picture came up. I cannot escape.
not you throwing his hair behind the couch 😭
How to get a rescue dog: Go to the shelter and see what dog you click with. You might need to go multiple times and to different shelters. Spend time with the dog and once you found the dog you like, arrange a meet and greet with Bear as he has to like the new dog too.
You’re the best! So funny!
Totally get Bear not getting the size difference. I had a staffy/labrador/kelpie once. Got her as a pup, and every morning I'd sit on a chair next to the steps, she'd run up the steps, climb onto my lap, put her chin on my shoulder and we'd enjoy the hug. Of course she got bigger (and heavy), but never quite seemed able to work out things had changed. If I was ever sitting on the ground she'd still come up and rest her chin on my shoulder, but it did leave me wondering if animals are aware of their own growth, of if they think everything shrinks as the get bigger. :D
This is the meme review we all needed! And Doctor Mike kinda does look like Bear cus aside from his hair, they’re both happy and healthy!
You have had some amazing co-hosts, but Bear must be the best.
It would’ve been so easy to just make the door SMALLER though!🤣
you actually look a bit like Bear
As far as knowing what floor to get off on for Bear, it’s not what he knows. It’s probably each floor has a different smell.
Would the cat be named after the Care Bear "Tenderheart Bear"? Oh no, that would be Tb for short. Bear does seem like the type of dog who could enjoy the right cat friend. I would try a kitten or a chill breed older cat for which you could have a foster parent/trial period to see if they mesh well and don't fight too much for your attention.
LIKE THE VIDEO!! 👍👍👍
this is now my favourite video on the channel
AHHHH WHY IS HE LETTING THE DOG LICK HIS FACE
imagen getting a heart from Dr. mike 🙂
First of when I had my first pet dog called Megan before she passed away and when you receive a greeting from Megan she constantly barks and bites a lot of people Megan has bitten the postman and the police twice and she has bitten my mum's friend was aged 90 years old Megan reacts to the vacuum cleaner she starts to bark and starts to attack the Hoover. When you receive a greeting from my new pet dog called Seren she gets excited a lot and she always often constantly jumps up at you but we often keep her in her cage a lot but I don't know how she reacts to the vacuum cleaner which I haven't seen in person just yet
When you get the cat...please make a vlog with bear Choosing the lookalike, and the process of buying the cat and bringing it home. Ty❤
Most of my friends don’t love dogs (or animals in general) like I do, so watching my comfort doctor react and being so cute and funny with these memes it really makes my day Thank you Dr Mike 🥹✨
Mike and Bear bonding moments are just the cutest thing ever.
This is the best video I've seen in a very long time. I had a smile on my face the whole time! Made my day a million times better! To answer your question you asked at 10:43 about finding a rescue dog, there are programs known as foster-to-adopt which means that you can foster a rescue dog for a period of time with the intention to adopt but if it doesn't work out, you don't have to go through with the adoption and you  continue to foster until the dog finds a different home.  An organization that I've fostered for is the NYCACC (New York City Animal Care Center) and they have shelters in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island! They have lots of dogs of all kinds looking for a forever home and they always need fosters as they are an open intake shelter! Sorry for the long comment. Hope this helps!
We gotta get him the cat
MAKE HIM GET DA CAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GET THE CAT!!!!!!!!
Could you react to old bbc top gear?

Just go to rescues and meet with lots of dogs, you'll find one.
me unlike when you said that you may get a cat
If you like Pitties, or hounds, or are just looking for a rescue to help you match a dog to your personality & to Bear, Villalobos is AMAZING. They are in Louisiana, so it'd be a trip. But totally worthwhile.
For me you don't need to suggest a video every time in the end of your videos  because I have already watched all of the videos in your channel doctor 😂😂😂😂
My dog can be sound asleep in a different part of the house, as soon as I start to touch the knob on the front door she sprints to me because she thinks we’re going on a walk.
didnt i doooo it for youuu
Well that statement from James Cameron is kinda false, as the Mythbusters proved that if Rose had tied her life jacket to the underside of the bit of flotsam she was on, then it would have provided sufficient buoyancy to last long enough for the two of them to be rescued.
It’s okay to push the other person off because I seriously doubt they’re as hot as Leonardo DiCaprio. He deserves his pretty privilege
Guys, push that like button!  I need to see Mike with a cat 🐈
Bear is so adorable 😍
Bear is so cute man
oh i just wanna hug Bear
I love bear
As a cat rescuer and a future cat sanctuary I will  tell you there are brown cats. They are gorgeous . Bear needs a little buddy . Bear needs to be in more videos 😍
A rescue dog will find you.  Look at shelters with zero intention of adopting. Visit the critters for fun.  A dog will tell you it's you they want and you will either leave that day and turn right around and come back for it or leave with your best friend.  You will know!

Love this kind of video, and Bear looks so cuddly. He's a very good boy.

HE IS SO CUTE 😍😍😍
Dr. Mike, I really want you to get a cat and get this dog called a min pin. They’re super chill. It’s a miniature pincher Chihuahua Bear would love it. Dr. Mike, my mom is a nurse at a children’s hospital in the ER. Do you think the nurses are equally as important or even more important than the doctors  @Doctormike
"Do they MAKE brown cats?"
Wish me happy birthday bear. Todays my birthday and you look ❤🎉🎉
I love Corgi so I’m gonna get one
I love corgis so much that I’m getting one and I’m Going to cry when I get it so cute
Newfies are the best!  My poor pit mix girl is scared of most other dogs, will avoid most at all costs. Except for the newfie next door. Only dog I've ever seen her get excited about meeting.
can somebody tell me what breed 'Bear' I really want a dog for last two year but I can't decide  Please tell me
W bear ❤❤🎉
Bear is so adorable 😍😍😍

like the video guys so bead gets a cat
Hi
Doctor mike take care of yourself.. Don't get tired that much! Stay healthy and happy!
Dogs that are rescued are very easy to find, usually on social media apps such as facebook, a bunch of people including myself upload pictures of dogs that were rescued which you can adopt. Or you can rescue one yourself. The dogs i rescued were never aggressive and are usually sweet so if bear needs a little friend go ahead
I'm conflicted. On one hand I absolutely want Bear to be in all the videos, but on the other hand I am 100% not paying attention to any medical advice given while a cute dog is visible. 🥰
Not you but your hair looks likes your dog🙂
Hope you and bear have a good day :)
Ooo.. A brown maine coon cat looks like Bear. 🥰
🧡🧡🧡🤗🐶🐻🥰🥰🥰¡Qué bonito Bear! De pequeñito: ¡Muy bonito! 💖 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Lol sooooo cat? Lol
To find a rescue that matches your personality, pick an adult! Then you can talk with the shelter and their personalities are developed so they cab help you find the right fit.
Bro I wanted one of these videos, You basically read my mind cause I wanted a video like this, Thank you mike, And Bear is so cute!
4:14  “Do they make brown cats?” Both captions: Yes… and also No.
I’m early
Bear is the best newf!
Corgis are not chill dogs! 😂❤️
Bear's such a majestic giant floofter 😍😍😍So cute... even though his head's probably bigger than mine LOL I can't help it but smile every time I see a dog - except chihuahuas, I've never liked those little terrors. Though I kinda get their attitude - with their size, they have the right to be afraid of literally ANYTHING since the world's just too big for them 😆
OMG Dr. Mike should react to cat memes 😂
Didn’t I do it for u?
I think you have the same vibe as bear. Therefore yes, you do look like him
My brain melted from cute
Dude my dog, a female cocker spaniel, 2 years old, has so much freaking energy and she loves to run and she’s an absolute terror sometimes. My neighbor comes over the other day she trots right up to her, sits down, and waits to be pet. No barking no jumping no running no nothing. She’s so fake. 😂😂😂😂😂
How big is the pile of fur behind the sofa,  you keep tossing it over your shoulder...pillow?
Awwww. Such an adorable floof <3
That dog next to the snow is a Borzoi...they're meme trending now bc of how tall they are and how long their snouts are.
You totally need to get Bear groomed by @GirlWithTheDogs. Would be awesome to see.
Aww! Bear is so cute ❤
I never heard Bear bark That’s my first time ever.
I want to hug him so bad
I have a wiener dog that acts like a shark because he has really sharp teeth and bites me
I didn’t know there was another Mikaelson brother named Thor 😳😂🤣 sorry I had to 😭💖
Bros so fluffy 😍
Please adopt a cat
U actually stretch your mouth so much while talking 😂
My main goal of life : Be Bear.
I've been desperately wanting a dog lately, and I recently discovered psychiatric service dogs. I have major depressive disorder, with very little motivation other than playing games and watching videos on my phone and laptop. PSDs can help prompt people with depression  to take care of themselves, as well as the dog. Note that these are NOT emotional support dogs! These dogs are officially trained and certified, and won't go barking or anything when encountering other dogs in public. Those dogs that do should NOT be permitted in places like grocery stores!  Just as long as the dog doesn't try to eat my birds, it'd also be great to have a snuggle bug in my darker times. I do have a psychiatrist that would probably be able and willing to submit the required letter, I just need to remember to ask. So, here's hoping for a floofy future!
Bear looks better than Dr Mike ☺️
Go to ur local shelter and u can ask if u can bring bear to meet I just lost my rescue that I got as my first dog last may 3 days b4 my bday
Bear will translate this for you Mike: woooofff borkkk woof bark bark
Is Roxy ok? I love Bear he is so cute. I hope Dost is ok. I love u guys so much.
lol do they make  brown cats? -2 points
Are we...are we not going to talk about the fact that Dr.Mike butchered "Don't Stop Believing?"
how is that dog so tall? LOL
The "didntiduitforu" caught me off guard. They truly are everywhere 😭
I am so excited to see Bear playing with a brown cat hihihihi 😂
bear's reactions were incredible
Love bear
Weinermegaly means what Mike? 🤨
You need to do more dog videos!!!
Bear is better then docter mike if you think that bear should take over the channel like his comment. (love you mike.)
Excellent videos. having 5 Dogs sometimes they drive me crazy. One of my dogs that pass away. Staying on the 6 floor he go off with the stairs but when he wants to came back he sit in front of the elevator till someone let him in and drop him off on the 6 floor miss him so much. You a 🌟 Dr Mike
BEAR IS ADORABLE ❤
I went up to my dog and took a selfie with him and we kind of look alike
Can’t believe that has been 5 years since Dr. Mike adopted Bear. He has grown so fast.   Wonder if Dr. Mike get a cat, How is that gonna be? 😊
Brown cats exist! They're just super rare
A BEAR video!❤🐻❤
everyone! what are you doing?! press the like button!!!!
If you wanna get a rescue, the best tip one of my friend gave me is to volunteer at the shelter as a dog walker. It's a win-win; you help out the shelter and you get to 'test drive' the dogs
I wonder when Mike's gonna requalify his channel from medical to pet cause I would totally watch every video with this cute big bear
Saw a vid of a Golden Retriever w/ a lions mane. That looked too real! (might have been just a photo. It was a while ago). There are places where you can foster a pet to see if you like them enough to adopt. Not sure how that works exactly, but worth checking out.
I love the Borzoi memes
OMG BEAR IS THE CUTEST DOG EVER!!!
Isn't bear just the cutest❤😍
i have a question if you can feel your ribs without pressing down does it mean that your to skinny
Bear! Always!!!!
30 minutes ago lets gooo
Get Bear a kitty!!!!
Your floor smells different.
Hey Doctor Mike I have had three rescue dogs so far in my life. What you need to know is the situation that that dog has been through if you can. When you meet them in the shelter take Bear along with you to see how the dogs react, and remember all dogs can change. I have a dog that lived outside its entire life, but when I showed her love she did too.
Bear when u said "i might get a cat" : Excuse me, the cat will effect ur cars extended warranty🙃, im sure of it🤓
Mike and Bear, get the cat and name it 'Chocolate.'
❤️😊
NEW BEAR VIDEOOOOOO! ❤ 50% Dr. Mike reacting to memes 50% Bear shedding
I love the pluck of fur on Bear's head! ❤ It looks so goofy 🥰😂
Awwww the Bear 🐻 pup😍.so adorable.My next rescue will definitely be a Pomeranian again, because I just love that breed and I love the fact that I can pick them up easily,plus they so adorable ❤️ You love the bigger size breed ,but maybe try a smaller size breed for a rescue.I promise you'd be pleasantly surprise.Just choose the breed that suits your lifestyle....And to answer your question about our feelings if Rose pushed the extra person off the door, I'm all for that.That spot is for Jack and Jack alone lol,unless you were the other person,then,yes sorry Jack,stay in the water lol...still crying over that scene.what a classic.loved today's video ❤️👌
EARLY 0:10
you look nothing like bear. Bear looks like if Hagrid was a dog
Don't let your dog lick your face.
Let's name the cat Teddy. Then, they can be introduced as Teddy, Bear 🐻 (and Mike).
I have the scar on my hand from breaking up a dog attack on a puppy. Happened a couple weeks ago so its healing nice. Luckily not a huge injury and dog was up on his shots. Dont regret it considering he was trying to tear the throat out of a puppy at the time.
Awww my Bijoux and Bear would've been such great friends! NEWF POWER
PLEASE, SHARE THIS VIDEO, I WANT TO SEE BEAR HAVE A CAT FRIEND 💀
Hey! Would love to see you do an activity with bear! Maybe something like tracking 😃 How's Roxy doing?
Bear is so ADORABLE 😍 Love the video❤️
1. dog in car with neck restraint can result in instantly breaking their neck in the event of a minor crash !!! 2. cloud cone only works for some body shapes useless on croccodoggos (long short doggos) the cone is very important to prevent dehiscence evisceration and infection!!!!  3. fostering rescue dogs and taking applications from other people wanting to give them forever homes is the best way to adopt because eventually you will "foster fail" and not want to give somebody up to a new family because he will fit so well with yours  PS ALL THE DOGGOS FEATURED ARE SOOOOOOOO PERFECTSSSSSS PWECIOUS ANGELS and dr mike demonstrates excellent owner behavior and health. (there are no such thing as bad dogs- just bad owners!! dogs are extremely predictable humans are not. humans are the only species that will follow an unstable leader) xoxox, Greery G, LVT  Licensed Veterinary Technician in the Commonwealth of Virginia  Old Dominion Animal Health Center Paws of Honor LLC

Mike: MEMES MEMES MEMES Bear: idc gimme kisses
I think Mike is extremely similar to Bear
Come on guys! I want a cat for Bear!
Moscow feral dogs apparently know how to take the metro. They go on the metro and they know which stations to get off at.
GET THE CAT, MIKE
Can't wait for the "searching for a cat for Bear" videos!
I lov ehow basic the name “Bear” is but also how appropriate💚💚
Bear probably recognizes the scent difference between your floor and the others
If bear has his own channel, would it hit 1 mill subs in about … a year?
Funnily enough Dr Mike does look like Bear .
more bear content! <3
6:25 I don't think it's photoshopped. The dog looking out of the wall probably stands on its hind paws, with their front paws against the wall.
Get ready Mike your about to get that cat :)
bear is just the biggest, cuddliest dog ever.  what a good boy.
Looks like you're getting a kitty🤣❤😼
Your dog is adorable! I wish I could give him some pets.
B E A R ! ! !
Doctor Mike's dog is so smart, he is as cute as Doctor Mike for sure, thanks a lot for sharing! 👍🤩🙌
So wholesome
@mike! I only adopt rescues, I tend to work pretty exclusively with troubled ones so that’s what I look for but how I always do it, and I have had normal sweet hearts too, just go to the rescue or pound, walk the line, trust your gut, meet em, pet em, play some ball, ask about back ground. If you’re not feeling it, come back another time. I think most people naturally gravitate towards the type they want or matches them instinctively.  Old dogs if you’re willing to take them on would for the most part be chiller dogs and ever so in need of homes, but there is likely medical expenses involved and not many years together.  But an old dog is an appreciative calm dog.
Woof woof
My uncle has a little dog named Casey. I have no intention of getting a dog anytime soon (too much responsibility) but if I ever change my mind I’m sticking with big dogs because his dog is ANNOYING! Every time we go to his house, Casey starts barking like crazy! At the same time though, when I was younger, he used to have this beautiful half Siberian Husky half German Shepherd named Kayla (RIP) and she was one of the most well behaved, friendliest creatures I’ve ever met. She wasn’t even my dog and I miss her!
Bear ♥
Bear is such a cute dog! He's so sweet and I just want to put my face in his fluff!
Mike you HAVE to get a Kitty friend for Bear.Him being a gentle Giant they will be best friends!Also, I watched you throwing balls of Bear's hair behind the couch the whole time  and laughed soo much. You are inspiration Doc, keep up the great work 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I remember playing nintendogs on the NDS and I had three dogs: two Labradors (white and black) and a Shiba Inu, I named the first Labrador Bobby, My Shiba inu Rocky and the black Labrador Poofly. I miss them so much :(
i hate being sick but bear made me feel better
I love bear 😊❤
Hellooo mcdreamyy
Aww bear is soo cute!!❤❤
Who else just thinks of bear and mike of that iconic duo we never knew we needed
Normally it's if not friend then why friend shaped but in this case it's a major friend that's also friend shaped.
What a wholesome video to end my day.
Bear looks like Godzilla lol
That’s really funny by the way, I really like your videos. Keep up the good work.
1:11 mike what the hell???
Anyone else read the title as "my new wife Bear"?
i wish i had a dog lol
Doctor Mike, what type of dog breed is your dog bear? My first dog was named Daisy and she was a German shepherd and collie mix, but she had hip dysplasia/ arthritis plus heart worms when she died and she lived for about 17.5 years!
Like the video so he has to get a cat.
I once saw this blonde woman with her yellow lhasa apso on the bus, and they had the same haircut xD
Quick everyone like so Bear gets a cat.
get the cat dr mike, you know you want it
Mike does kinda look like bear
Look for the dog in the pound tht is the most calm, no barking. Then you will find the dog tht you need.
Early
Never enough bear! Peace!
3k likes now, still waiting for the 300k likes
Also, LETS GET TO 300,000 LIKES, PEOPLE!  so Mike can get bear a cat friend..🥺🤝
Bear is just to cute to be that big and well trained. A dog that’s heavier than me with perfect puppy eyes and the ability to just chill on your lap is perfect.
i cannot believe bear weighs more than me. i refuse to believe that. i cant be tinier than a DOG!!???
Bear is too cute 😍❤️
Bear is the real star of this channel!
25k people in a quarter of an hour, impressive
i watched this with my dog i approove much wholesome very cute 👍
I mean in this video Dr Mike's hair looks all floofy like bear's coat!
THE diddnidoitforyu CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
Where is the dinasour costume I am sad
My dogs where poppy and Tyler so it was popsicle, pops, wiggles, popsie😂 and Tyler was mr t (complete opposite in personality which is even funnier), tinker Taylor, TT boy😂
*1:30* *nostalgia hit so hard* because it's been several years of watch doctor mike
Have you read Breath by James Nestor? if so, can you make a video about your thoughts on it?
Bear😍
Newfie Bear, Newfie Bear, does whatever Newfie Bear does! Watch out Newfie Bear! 😁😅😂🤣
HE NEEDS A CAT
As a South Carolinian, I'm forcing the state to change their name to South Corgilina now.
Dr mike can we need more 911 please!
I was literally waiting for Mike to go "let me do it for you" but then he never did 😭😭 at least the editors are on it. 😂😂
300,000 LIKES LETS GET TO WORK FELLAS
Why was there a technical difficulty at 1:14?
🥰✌
Hi Doctor Mike ^^The dog in the snow with the snow  sculpture next to it, is  the Russian breed called Borzoi 😉 (the Whippets coat is very short)
Bear is the same weight as me💀😭😭
its not a whippet its a let me do it for you dog
In case of my current dog it was me putting on jeans or other warm trousers.Always.
I liked the video so fast I forgot I liked it 🥰
Kermie
2:40 Didn't I do it for you....Let me do it for youu..🥺
He has had more kisses from bear than from a lady!
Bear's face says, "I'm sooooo over this & your dad jokes."
Cute furr daddy n fur baby.is he a baby he:s big boy
My dog was attacked by another dog now she gets anxiety when we travel anywhere and doesn’t like when other dogs come near her
3:00 actually the crate is not necessary and it can be bad for some dogs. You just need to teach your dog to be alone which is something that does not come naturally for them so that is why they need to learn
Get a cat!!!!!!!
The bond that Doctor Mike has with Bear is adorable
DOGE
Bear is the bestest boy! Him sleeping on your lap is just so cozy!
I used to have a dog named Bear also, but he died just before the new year. He died do to a skin disease that the vet couldn’t cure. He was put down because it was causing him a lot of pain 😢
I think Bear looks kinda like he's balding
I believe all rescues allow people to spend time with a dog before adopting them, so people can get a feel of the personalities and make sure it's a good match.  I am one of the 300k likes because I wanna see Dr. Mike get a Norwegian Forest cat, like he indirectly claimed.   "Hey baby, I'm gonna give you some Cardiomyweineropathy, tonight."
I am so glad your editor put in, “DIDN’T I DO IT FOR YOU?”
i love the floof he is adorable
Mike can you do Prodigal Son medical scenes? They have some interesting moments
Soo adorable
I hope that is floof you keep throwing over the back of the couch.!!!🐾
please if you do get a cat get it as a kitten then take care of it when its young because you and that cat can have a strong good relationship other than adopting and grown cat and have it not care about you cats are very different then dogs
Awwwww Bear and a cat would be soooooo cute!
He has 60 kilogram? HOLY COW
You ever think about getting a cat?  😂
.... GET A CAT PLEASE... also while you we're talking about the muffins i was eating it, and i ate it more
Your dog is bigger than me!
In terms of finding a rescue dog that suits your personality, honestly, you might be searching for a while, lol.  I've had two rescue dogs separately, neither of them match my personality, and both are complete opposites of each other personality wise.  I loved them both to death, they were unique in their own ways.  The key is meeting the dog and seeing how they act and respond to you.
the only thing i know about doctor mike is that he is a monster in the ring lol.
Come on people there's a cat frind on the line here.
I'd wish to have a corgi in the future ☺️
300k likes for a Cat, but also looking for a dog? Why stop at 3 (including bear)? Get ALL THE PETS!! Make yourself an army of support animals and invade hospitals with joy.
Let's get bear a new pet
0:48    POV: my dad takes an X-Ray and the doc sees this
2:42 got me
Sean Casey in Brooklyn is where I adopted my Sadie girl. They are fantastic and it's pure magic how the right pup finds YOU.
Actually, Dr.Mike...yeah, you and Bear have similar hairstyles :D Also, I'm pretty sure this is Pamela Rae Schuler's fave video of you two :D
Bear is just a small grizzly bear, I refuse to believe he is a dog.
I work with a local volunteer group that tries to get Indian pariah dogs adopted (look them up they are really low maintenance breeds and are among the friendliest cute things ever) so if anyone is interested, please let me know
bear is the epitome of no thought head empty
We demand more Bear

CAT GANG👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻           YELL CAT POEPLE AND LIKE
was waiting for the didnt i do it for you when the long face dog showed up HAHAHAHA
Oh my god I love brown cats they are the cutest thing everrrr
This is probably the most wholesome video I have seen all day.
Big Bear
I did my part...I liked the video to get Bear a cat.
not being rude, but is that another tongue of the dog?
Yeah, Jack and Rose would have both died, there would have been too much weight.
Hi
Seeing dr mike and bear talk to each other in the video is so wholesome and generally warms my heart.
Blueberry muffins are my weakness too.
14 MINUTES EARLYYY, I knew I was made for this
God, Newf’s cuteness is unBEARable 💕
Can't believe some of the memes I submitted made in the video. For the titanic one the theory is that if they were both on the board the board would not be able to stay above the water and they would both have drowned.
I think that behind that sofa is a pile of rolled Bear fluff, several times during the video Mike let go of fluff over his right shoulder. Maybe he’s collecting it to knit a cat to match Bear. Now that would be cool!
get this 300,000 likes it is neccesary
Everyone please  give a like one this video so Doctor minke can get that cat he needs one.  Good video doctor mike💜👍
Bear is my favorite YOUTUBE star ⭐️   We need more video with BEAR 🐾🐾🐾🐾
300k likes for a chocolate colored cat?! Let’s do this people! 🐈 #TeamMikeGetsACat
Yayyyyyy! I'm earlyyyyy. For once 😂❤️
A video with Mike is awesome but one with Mike and Bear is the BEST
That was some of the best selections of memes
SUB 10
Epic
The fact that Doctor Mike read’s the memes and then talks to Bear 😂 Bear is so so so cute 🥰☺️😊
Deg
You gotta check out some casual geographic. Some dog species are as intelligent as a 2 year old. And Scientists have found that if you are having a bad/stressful day, check on your dog because they may be as well. Since dogs love to share emotions with us.
Kinda early?! 2 mins
Common guys! Lets take a cat for Bear! 💖💖💖 Like the video! 💖💖💖
Bear is such an awesome and happy dog!
Dr. Mike please consider adopting a shelter dog or cat for your next pet! So many animals desperate for homes. No need to spend so much money for a "fancy" dog!
your cholestrol is fine. you doctors over react
EVERYONE MAKE THIS VIDEO GET 300K LIKES  WE NEED DOCTOR MIKE TO BUY A CAT
I love bear 🐻

Corgis are the best, (not better than my dog or bear) better than the rest
So my risk of heart disease is exponentially higher if I have muffins a lot? Sweet, dude.
Mike being Russian and not recognizing a Borzoi.  LOL

Bear is best boi
3 minutes ago
Doctor Mike, when you get the cat, when Bear is giving visitors kisses say, "thank you for cleaning the litter box for, Bear." People make the funniest faces when you do that. I also like to tell people I escaped from Castle Woofenstein when I go out because my dog barks like there is an Al-Qaeda hit squad in the front yard about to storm my house every time she sees anything that isn't a normal part of the yard. My dog's name is Cinnabon, but I call her Bunion because she's a pain in my ass sometimes, but I love her. I probably would have blown my brains out a couple years ago, if I hadn't gotten her. She was a rescue dog, but she actually rescued me. I just looked on the shelter's website, and they did a good job listing her personality traits, then I scheduled a visit to her, and it was love at first sight.
A good boy and some good memes!

Hey, Doctor Mike?! For your video series answering questions,  what is your opinion on creatine, caffeine, ectysteroids, and nmn (Nicotinamide mononucleotide)? My 3 favorite "natural" performance supplements!! Is there ever a case where you would encourage anyone not to take these? Do you take any of them yourself?
Aww
Awww I love you doctor mike
Bear looks so incredibly huggable.  Edit: Not sure why people like this of all comments, but I appreciate it. Still 15/10, would hug Bear.
