The alex ferguson is hilarious 😂
Conor is genuinely brilliant! I have just discovered this guy and to be honest he is the best impersonator I have ever seen! The intonation, the facial expressions, some of his takes are  accurate to the point of being almost uncanny. Now I'm hooked!
It's scary how good ur Gary Neville is 👀

Amazing man! Just wonderful talant you have!
Souness is by far the best. 😂
Thought he’d do a Micah Richard’s but that laugh wasn’t bad 🤣😭😩
Hes just too good.
The Roy Keane and Souness and Ferdinand are Killaz 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's been two years now and Harry Kane is still craving for freedom.
2023 I'm back here
Connor man your brilliant! I don’t know who is my favourite, your too accurate! When you do pep or Roy Hodson I’m instantly laughing

Automatic mood lifter 😂
Rio!!! LMAO!!!!!

His impression of U. Emery...id alaways hillllllaaaaarioussss
Carragher and Ronaldo was spot on
Needs to work on Neville and Maguire, otherwise outstanding

That Micah impersonation is 💯🤣🤣🤣
No Mike Yarwood (one for the teenagers) but bloody good.
Wow
Dychey 🤣
Hey man you should do old wwe impersonation. Will be great to watch .
Hodgson: To England winning the First World War … 😂
These impression's!!!!!! 😅🙌🙌
Genius
This young irish man is o.m.g. great.up sligo
2:26 So which team does Christopher Walken play for then?
Micah Richards 😂😂😂😂
Good ebening is back to busineesssss good ebening
He actually has a lot of the skills to be a good actor.....
Kane 😂 “Olle, I said a BIG club, to win TROPHIES!!”
Everyone spot on 😂😂😂
He's great, but I like Farley more!
Your impressions are very good. Harry Kane sounds like the actor Michael Caine.
So funny 😂 I’m not a soccer fan and don’t know most of these pictured people. However the intonation and mannerisms make me realise / imagine how these person people talk. Well done!! 👌
Spot on
Ronaldo turned into Christopher walken lol
GOLD!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
wtf he has a trophee
love the Lamps
Outstanding 😂
Man of 1000 voices everyone the same 🙈🙈brilliant
The Lampard and Roy Hodgsen ones were hilarious 😂
Amazing how your face changes to suit the character
The David Beckham accent was brilliant
So much trolling
Your Slabhead impression cracks me up every time without fail 🤣
0:56 Jamie Redknapp: *internally screams* 😆😆😆
The Carragher one tho.
These are fucking incredible.
I really love the way he does Carra and José.
This bro is a spit image of Matic 🤣
The micah Richards one was 👏 👏 👏
This is priceless, Conor! 🤣 😂 🤭😆 I'm so glad I have found your channel! 😁🙏🏿 This video had me in stitches 🤣 from beginning to end 😂 . I wanted to quote my fav part and then I realised that if I do that I'll have to quote the entire video!!! 😆😆🤣
Every single one is spot on
Wow!!!!! Beckham was ridiculous amazing
Jamie carragher man 😂
This guy half-predicted Ronaldo's next destination AND Sean Dyche's sack!
Sean dyche one was perfect
Hes so so good that he literally becomes the person he impersonates. Never seen anything like it.
Did anyone else wake up half the half at 0:59?
Brilliant
Harry redknapp is spot on
this guy can do efortlessly gary kahill
If the Lamps were a touch deeper and slower, it'd be indistinguishable from the real Frank.
Dude please do slaven bilic
That Roy Keane's impression is so good 👏
There should’ve been a Sean dyche
🤣😂🤣😂the Jamie garagher impression
0:23
Greame Souness impression was flawless 👌
Gary Neville was great. Spot on 🤣🤣🤣
Souness 1 made me question it was real
Graeme Souness 😂😂
Genius conor
That ole is IMPECCABLE 🤩🥵
When you watch this guy, Darren Farley isn't even worth watching! All he does is over the top scouse impressions which are out of date and not accurate. The Gerrard creaking door that Farley does is stupid and he doesn't sound like that at all. Connor Moore is a legend. That Richards laugh slays me every time!
Super impressions on the others as usual. And that of the Steve Bruce, it was a carbon copy. Nailed it. And Unai Emery impression always cracks me up. Brilliant
Good ebening 🤣👍class!
Some brilliant impressions in here.I can't select the best one.
Souness 😄 🤣
Very good. Darren Farley just seems to do the same old tiresome shit...
Amazing!!!!!!
Only poor one was Gary neville
Carra impersonation is amazing 😂😂😂
Where's Ger🤔
Love his Roy hodgson Steven Bruce and Sean dyche accents
I'm feeling very down after Lewis got robbed, but this video and many of of your videos have made me smile for the first time since Sunday. Thanks for making people laugh Conor!
Ummm.  A higher pitch on the Beckham voice please. Not squeaky enough
I always come back for the Paul Pogba part 😅
Harry Kane morphing into Michael Caine! Brilliant!
Phenomenal
Can you do sir Alex Ferguson? 😁
The only guy that is to blame for the European super league is Paul Pogba caught me so off guard
1:19 2:22
Wat a talent
"From england winning their first world cup, to england winning their first world war" Bruh 🤣🤣🤣
1:19 2:22 Souness really hates him 😂
He looks like Ole😂
Brilliant.
Sources with Pogba  🤣🤣😅🤣😂
Your Souness is brilliant!
Wow the predicted the whole Ronaldo transfer
By the way, Conor, what's your favourite team ?
In fact, Conor's not a great imitator, he's possessed by all these people !
I am so Happy 🗣💨
Sir Alex spot on , Roy keane needs work
Amazing
For Dyche you just need Tarkovsky and Wood
This is brilliant
The Micah one is a violation 🤣
The best impression man 👨
Even the face is spot on
I like Darren Farley as well, but you are the benchmark dude
Will you do Arteta?
His Roy keane is bang on. Do me a favor
This guy is so good … brilliant!
Carragher and neville were toooo accurate😂😂😂
Man you are great
Legend 😭
Jurgen kloop is my favourite impression
Europa League is not a trophy😂💔
The mic and the head phone make it unnatural. Better sound quality but unatural
💯%🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍 Gary Neville..👍
This guy is the best.
Please do Messi's impression.
And play for city 😂😂  2:35
Genius
Rodgers, sourness, Neville, Keane and carra were all poor but some like ole and Jose were spot on
The way he says Fantastic under Ole! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It Kills me. Gets me everytime
"I want to come home to Manchester...to play for city" 💀💀
Souness🤣🤣😭
3:11 the best 😂
Only person missing is Big Sam
That Ronaldo/Christopher Walken impression 😂
Souness and beckham is fantastiikk.
Graham souness is amazing
The Jamie Carragher one is my favourite. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥
😂😂😂Paul pogba
That sequence from Carra, Garry Neville and Souness is solid gold 🤣🤣🤣🤣

I’m coming back to this and that Ronaldo joke was almost spot on😂😂😂
Just release an edit of pen throws and Paul pogbas back to back please
*pen throw* PAUL POGBA
OMG this guy is legend, he did all impressions so gooood 👍😂
Keep them coming Connor!
Not only the voice, the facial expressions are also spot on..Connor is a real artist..
2:30 this aged like wine😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wonder if he could copy Gary Neville’s laugh…
0:57 nails the persona to perfection after hours and hours of observation
MIcah XD
This guy never misses. He’s a legend
Gary Neville!!!
This guy is fantastic
The Gary Neville one really got me🤣🤣🤣
The souness bit killed me 🤣

Ronaldo sounds just like Christopher Walken lol
Darren Farley is the true goat
More than u believe
2:33 That aged well 😂 This dude managed to predict Ronaldo's return to Old Trafford THREE months before and even made fun of it! What a legend! 😂
“The only one to blame for the super league is Paul Pogba” that made me laugh so hard i started sweating, amazing comedy mate keep it up.
2:26 Conor knew Ronaldo might think Man City😁

How did this guy nearly call Ronaldo joining Man City lmao
ronaldo was too accurate xD IM FINISHEDDDDDDDD HAHA
Almost predicted Ronaldo
Micah Richards! Brilliant!
Super talented !!!
21 MAY 2021 MAY! "I will come back to Manchester! For City!" My god I don't even think HE thought that would EVER happened so I GUESS he was right...kinda.! You know...Bout Fergie and Rio phoned him... Weird how they're BOTH in this video! Wouldn't be surprised it it WAS him!   Fergie hasnt come out and taken credit. But you CAN see Rio coming out saying ahhhh yeh was ME BRUV. With his nod tik tok gif just sat there waiting for the paper to come out with a rumour about WHAT he said. Paper saying "It's thought Rio told him the fans wouldn't forgive him" Rio on social media the next day "Yeh totally man. TOLD HIM I DID. I said to him I did. I said YOU CANNOT got there Ron lad. The Utd fan won't forgive you. Yeh I'm sure I said that....Yeh I said innit, brav"    Fergies keeping shtum like af like a PROPER Glaswegian "I don't even care no more, all the social media an youtube impersonatior shit. It's too complicated PLUS I can't deny it! What if it feckin WAS me? My minds GONE pals! Do doobt abootet."
0:59 Lookggh
Damn that Beckham and Carragher was spot on!!!!! 😂
How do you do it????😄😄😄
This guy is bloody great he has nailed them all what a laugh......

Why does sourness sound a bit like kermit the frog
Will we get a World Cup impressions once it ends because this is gold?
Redknapp and Carragher were spot on.
10/10
You got to do Euros Impressions, commentators (Rio, Roy Keane, Jose Mourinho), players (Harry Kane? Ronaldo?) and others that are not participating like David Beckham, OGS (fantastic xD), Klopp (his reaction to Germany's defeat)... you name it
This lad is even better than Darren Farley
Give it a rest💩💩💩💩

So talented and keep it up. I laugh every time you throw the pen blaming Paul pogba 👏🏻😂
The ole one was scary how that sounded just like him
all them were top notch but the rio impression was actually insanely accurate

This guy's a genius
Ronaldo - "I'd like to come home to Manchester and play for City" 😂😂😂
Micah the laughing hyena 😆
Gary Neville and Carragher's impression was spot on
Can’t wait for his Thomas Tuchel impersonation: “Very Wery happy, there was high intensity , a lot of pressing and the attitude we demand from the players.. I am conWinced it was a huge performance Ja”
Micah Richards - his main contribution is laughter
You need to do the Harry Kane speech. Fuckin chances, Scholes?  😂😂
0:59  Lüçk

Graeme Souness 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀
All a little bit off. Beckham, ferguson, souness, carragher, 1st Harry Lane were good though
By far the best impressionist.
Soft. FLAIRKEH!
Decent but not quite Darren Farley level IMO
That Ronaldo impression was on point
Jamie Redknapp and Ronaldo needs work lol. But most of them spot on. Great impressions

One name: Steven Gerrard, when?
That Micah impression 😂😂😂😂

Someone's standing still next to Micah Richards.  Micah Richards: Smiles or Laughs.
The Gary Neville and Maguire needs work but the rest are amazing
Steve Bruce was mad accurate 🤣🤣🤣
"perst of all, good ebening"😂😂😂, spot on with every impression
Very hit and miss, some are great but some aren't quite there yet.
"More than you believe, I'm so happy " 🤣🤣😭😭
Why has never anyone tried Guy Martin?  So charismatic.
Retro spot: Beckham gets a new hairdo and asks Roy what he thinks of it in training!
His Beckham is another level
Micah's laugh tho🤣🤣
Micah Richards 😂😂😂😂
Gary Neville was on point! 😍 Becks! Harry, All of em' 🙌💯.
Only one slightly off in my opinion is Gary Neville, the rest are brilliant !

Hadn't heard his Souness impression before - brilliant!

The Europa League is not a trophy ! Brilliant !
Him on BR champions?
I'd like to come home to Manchester, and play for city. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jeez man by the time u master " the tuchel"... he wouldve got the sack twice by chelsea

The "Spinless" from Neville tho...😯                             🔥
Its one thing to do the impressions but the script alone is brilliant.
Is Pep so happy when that lost the ucl?
Lampard😁😁😁😁😁😁
That Roy Hodson impression is jokes!😂🤣😂🤣
The skill of so many people is incredible!
Jamie c and Brendan and Gary Neville and maguire was shit
Blame Paul Pogba he said 😂
Sounness is scarily accurate. Ronaldo has acquired some Christopher Walken tendencies...

The hair comb 😂 😂
Much better, improving considerably.
Sonya the dogs peed in me slippers

Better than darren farley without fail
Brilliant 😂👏😂👏
Why the fuck is this in my recommendations...it’s fucking shit
Lmao for souness- spot on
THAT GRAEME SOUNESS WAS QUALITY

Just Brilliant 👏
You look like Gary Cahill.

Stick to radio I'd say With good writers it could work

Amazing ... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry Kane impression was freaking funny🤣
Awesome. Conor has so much variety.
I wouldn't bother with the Gary Neville one mate, it's not there
You promised a Tuchel impression! No pressure though
Still waiting for your Tuchel's expression

Amazing!!! Super talented
Absolutely Brilliant mate!!!🤣
Conor is #1. Every one else is a poor imitation
Man U didn't even win the Europa against some Spanish farmers 😂😂😂
You’re the best impressionist, but Darren Farley is funnier
Conor can even smoke cigars....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Pepe🤣🤣
Quality
This guy is very funny! Every manager's expression is just bang on!!
Should’ve contacted Mark Goldbridge for the Sean Dyche impersonation.
He is unbelievable man amazing.  Best
Always Graeme Souness for me, lmfao 😆😂😂
Is it just I or you could see these characters in his face (phenotypically). It's surreal
The lampard one had me rolling round 😂😂😂
Where is Tuchel ?
Gary Neville impression is hilarious
PAUL POGBA
Souness was the best while also being the worst!
The final Pep was the best 😂
Somehow these keep getting better and better!😂😂 Absolute legend sir
Amazing! ironically only Roy Keane sounds a bit off and only because it sounds like a 25 year old Roy with younger vocal cords
Yooo this dude was spot on with all them impressions💯Graeme Souness and Roy Keane had me dying 🤣
SAF one was waaaaaay too easy to understand to be on point
First ever video where its legit spot on

Graham souness has elements of kermit the frog and I'm not complaining
Does pep smoke?
I wanna see Tiago from Liverpool https://youtu.be/06lvA0zuCh4
The souness one about pogba was class 😂
His Souness when he says European Super League was a bit Kermit.
His brendan Rogers is just a more stern Joe brolly........
1:22 I lost it
1:59 PERFECT ! 👌 how ?
He absolutely nails the fact that Souness' volume does not alter no matter how angry he is.
10 times better than Darren Farley,

Too much, too good....do more, longer piece per person
Graeme Sounds 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Conor is better impresionist, Darren Farley is funnier
Harry kane sounds like Peter Griffin from Family guy. Change my mind.
The Beckham eyebrow raise. Spot on 😂
Apart from saf anf roy keane its spot on👍🏻🤣
Jose Mourinho that was on fire
What a guy
Skysports should just hire him and sack the other pundits. Will save a lot of money!
Impressive! Every goddamn time 😂 😂 😂 🤯
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Hahahahhahahaha bro you're the best!!!
Absolutely brilliant. The only one that wasn't quite there was Sean Dyche.
Nevilles one was by far the best
ronaldo or christopher walken? haha
How do u like this more than once
We need to see a Tuchel impression
Elon musk last impression was on point
Greame Souness one shocked me 🤯🤯🤯
Micah Richard's laugh out of no where!!!
The only guy to blame super league is pogba 😂😂😂😂😂
Gary Neville with the hair brush 😂
Practice Neville more mate! Rest is v good:)
Why you have never added Pep's cough problem in any of his impressions? He coughs a lot.
This guy is actually amazing
Imagine if he voiceacted for BR Report's "the Champions" !!!!!!!!!!!
souness and bruce was incredible!!!
Absolutely rubbish impressions 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sounds nothing like them
You are absolutely amazing!!!!
Souness impression is on fire!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
This was God awful terrible. Maybe 5 accents sounded close. You need to review the video, way off on everyone
All were really good just not really the one of Alex Ferguson
Arteta : 'I don't think they would sack me , Why ? , because I am bestfriends with Pep Guardiola'  😭😂
carrager is spot on
I was waiting for Rio to plug Danny Welbeck!!
Couldn't do ole Gunnar 😂😂😂😂
Souness impression is incredible man!

I love all of them !
Not only has the accent spot on. His looks like them too 😂😂😂 quality
😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:40 😂😂
The only man to blame is paul pogma 😂😂😂😂
It's obscene how well these are done. Accents are one thing, but these are so specific.
sooo good!!
Thomas Tuchel is next ? 😂😂
Souness every time...The guy is so good. We're kinda taking for granted how good he's with Klop, Arteta, Morinho...but when he comes up with random guys Dyce and be as good, you wonder who he can't impersonate
I'll like to come home to Manchester and play for City.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That rage on pogba 😆😆
T. Tuchel is missing 😂
You need to improve the Ronaldo impression
You were just bantering Maguire aren't you ? 🤣
Inshalah SUIIIII should’ve been one
This shits too much 😂😂😂
The Graeme souness one made me spit my water so far🤣🤣
Sounees always kills me😂
Hilarious
Michah 😂
Keano is the best impersonation
He gets the eyes down perfectly
Conor, you are the greatest talent out there, so many impersonations, facial expressions and mannerisms, and they are all on the button! This is pure world class entertainment!
the eyebrow for David Beckham is incredible
Normally find a lot to fault in impressions, but I must say I was impressed
i just really want him to do tuchel 😭
Went a bit easy on Jose. Bcz he visited his studio? 😜
Hahahahahahahahaa!! You made my day!! The Graeme Souness one had me ROFL 😂😂😂😂
Micha Richards 😂
By a million miles the best impressionist on this planet
Brilliant... Harry kane lmao
SOUNESS😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Steve Bruce 🤣
Absolutely amazing.
Some people definitely not heard how these people actually sound
Rinses and repeats the same phrases for the same characters each video,slightly boring.
Lol Kane shouting UEL not a trophy 😂
his alex furgesun impression is underrated
Never fails an impression.
he is more of a pep & jose than pep & Jose😂😂
Man the Ronaldo one got me good with "and play for city" nice one.
I seriously think he can imitate the entire human population voice
Top class 👏😂
He sounded just like Gary Neville
micah 00:56 😂😂😂😂😂
Too good
"Id like to come home to Manchester and play for City"🤣🤣🤣
Roy hodson pmsl
the best David Beckham impression I've ever seen.
Quality content as always 🔥.
Sounds more like Graeme Souness than Graeme Souness
Love it love it
You need to do the impressions of celebrities off of football too...like Hollywood? Begin with peaky blinders pleasee
That souness was impressive lol
Conor you're a genius! - Pep Gaurdiola with cigar and "more than you can believe" 3:22 - simply brilliant
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
That Paul Pogba part by Graeme Souness... Legendary... 🤣
Nobody can do Gary Neville
U need to work on arteta impression
Micah Richards...not a word uttered...still beats everything else😂😂

Cristiano sounds like Christopher Walken
Gary Neville...got it properly.

He never misses...
Roy Hodgson witnessed England winning the WWl... I'm dying 👌🤣🤣
I was in a taxi, then the driver said " I love my job. I am my own boss, nobody tells me what to do"  I then told him to turn right.
Ooooo that Gary Neville impression defo needs work!! The rest are pretty good tho
The Roy Hodgson was uncanny
Come home to Manchester........ and play for city 😂😂😂
Everyone was brill  Loved it
His Bruce is the best
Hopefully I'll come to Manchester and play for city😂😂😂😂
Nobody talking about the Solskjaer one but it was perfect, the accent, the intonation, the expressions and the dialogue was jokes! This guy smashed it
The Woy Hodgson is so so good.
How is everyone spot on 😂
Guardiola 😂
Carragher is perfect
Where’s Tuchel????? 😭😭 i was so looking forward to your impression of him :(

Firstly, great video however i have a request. P.L.Z  M.O.R.E  R.O.N.A.L.D.O
I wanna hear Bruno Kermit impersonate tho 😂
harry maguire one needs some work lol
Great Character till the pressure came on. Fantastic as Harry might say . Top work from the mullingar man.
Didn't know Ronaldo was Dutch!
Top class impression & even better writing. Love it when Kane says Europa League is not a trophy 😂
The reason this video has 49 dislikes.... IS PAUL POGBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Paul pogba to be blamed for the super league  I laughed until I cried
You need to do Thomas tuchel impression.. That would be gold
Beckham is on point!
Impression of Ole😀😂😂😂
CR7: I'D LIKE TO COME HOME,TO MANCHESTER,AND PLAY FOR CITY..😂😂😂💀💀
Doing impressions of people of colour is racist. I'm triggered. :-D
That Sounes one is spot on!!!
All are very good but for a second there I thought it was actually Ronaldo & Rio in the room
The  only one he couldn't nail was Dyche. The only way to get that gruff of a voice would be to eat some nails! So funny though!
Top, top quality. Had me in stitches. Anyone else think Ronaldo sounded like Christopher Walken?!
We want messi impression
souness 🤣🤣🤣
Pep, Lampard, and Steve Bruce impressions were the best
I think you are fantastikk....oh there is no doubt bout dat 😂👍👍

Ole: lookkk everybody knows harry kane is a fastastikk player and we're a fantastikk club- Kane: ole I said a big club to win trophies!!! Ole: to win the Europa- Kane: The Europa league is not a trophy!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
That Graeme Souness one 😮😮😮😮 Wow

Everything is bcoz of Pogba
I will never not laugh out loud at the Emery impression🤣 Loved the Souness one too (they’re all amazing though tbf)
Slabhead Lmfao
Souness on Pogba really had me rolling on the ground 😂😂
Naaah man that Neville impression is so real I doubt anyone can tell the voices apart. Impressive stuff right here boys.
Ronaldo was my favorite, back home in Manchester...city. Will never happen he is a red devil!!!
😂
That jamie carragher one was accurate hmmm
I wish he did these more often, but then again they're more special when they're not as often.
lol if it wasn't for the dizzy goalkeeper I would have not got the sack. Frank Lampard. I'm dead hahaha. Kepa did Fran wrong lol
Hahaha...Connor  is sooooo gooood
Woy Hodgson saying 'weal woller coaster' just made my day.....thanks Connor!
Sean dyche is class 😂😂😂
Everyone you nailed .. the question is ? Can you please do a Daniel Farke 😂
Harry "Michael" Kane
Loved the Souness impression 😂
Quality with a capital K
I can’t believe it, he’s gotten even better
Well deserved to be trending.
OGS is on spot!! what a big talent
neville mic killed me 1:13 hahahaha
All very good except Gary Neville.  Not heard anyone do a good one yet.  It must be hard to master.
jamie carragher OMD
3:11 good ebening 😂😂
Nailed it
This guy is too good!
Well done. Hilarious! Now get yourself a pop filter.

Sounes!
The carra one is on point
A-maz-ing
The Roy Keane “do me a favour” kills me everytime 😂😂
Man your so good at this
😂😂😂😂 Klop, Kane, and Pep
😂😂 Class.🙌🏾
Darren Bent's cameo laugh - haaaaaaaaa
Best impressions
Unai does need to come back tho😆😆
They were all pretty accurate except Sir Alex.
When I think of voice impersonation in the sports world, you are the absolute best. Am patiently waiting for your Tuchel debut!
Too funny!! 😂 😂 😂
The David Beckham one 😳
He did Harry Redknapp better than Harry Redknapp did himself!
Love how he just did the Micah laugh, cuz his voice is really hard to imitate
Well y'know he's a top top actor. T'riffic
Can anyone do tuchel impression  Nah
Put it on mute and watch 3 minutes and 42 seconds of a bang-on Gary Cahill impression.
This man has a god-given talent.
Graham soucness impression was hilarious 😂
Yeaaa finnaly he's doing micah richard impression
Pep's impersonation killed me 😂😂😂
Man this is gold
Absolutely brilliant
He can even do impressions in other languages now with Mourinho!  Maybe try all the managers speaking their native tongue, now there's a challenge for you!
Spot on for all of them... but the one for me is Graeme Souness giving blame to Pogba for everything bad and good happening around us. That guy is a disgrace. 🤣😂🤣😂
Best impressionist around fact
He is without doubt the best football impressionist, every single impression and the editing right on point. It's as if you;re in the Sky Sports studio!
Do some AFTV, kick off and mark goldbridge impressions
His take on Souness is magical; why DOES Souness want to kill Pogba so much?!
Harry Maguire is hilarious!
The Unai Emery one 😂😂😂
This is only 24 impressions right?
Roy Hodgson, brilliant 🤣
Kind of a snowflake comment but you had a lot of choices for pep and you had to mock the aguero farewell? Sus
Gary Neville underrated amongst all his other great ones.
Genius . Could watch these for Hours
Cristiano's 🤯
The Gary Neville impression is just on another level!!! Amazing
😂😂😂 the Unai part😂😂😂
The Emery one was brillant. 😂
The guy to blame is paul pogba😂😂
The 🐐

This came out of nowhere 🤣🤣 0:57
HAHAHAHA KANE RAGING ON OLE  CM LEGEND
He "prefers not to speak" because Jose's his best mate now 😂😂
Raining outside? Yea probably Paul Pogbas fault
Souness is your best impression by a country mile. Doubt many others could pull that off!
Touchel '
Love the Ole one lol.
That last part with pep was so  hilarious 😂
Get this guy on sky sports 🤣
The europa league is not a trophy 🤣🤣
Micah: HAAA HAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Souness 🤣😭
The Steve Bruce impressions is severely underrated in your armoury lad
"Crystal palace, big shoes to fill there." 😂😂
Pause the video right the the beginning man’s eating the mic 💀

Too good connor 😂😂🔥
Terrific as always! Why is Guardiola smoking?
"Maguire : I am the only harry here so just put me up top and I will put my slab on it." 😂😂😂😂😂😂 You just gotta appreciate the banter😂😂
CM is a World class performer in this moment for sure. More than you believe.
Absolute masterclass and entertaining from connor as always, brilliant 😂👌
His face is really like Lewandowski
Connor is just getting better and better
Just had to stop the video about a minute in. Was playing it WITHOUT headphones and then the Micah Richards laugh blared from phone. Priceless.
His Brendan Rogers is priceless 😂😅☝️
When's the Thomas Tuchel one coming?
Pogba: Come On!
Your videos deserve to go viral!
No no seriously emary need to get back 😂😂
Come to Manchester and play for city😂😂😂😂
i could never get bored of watching these

Talented lad.
Conor probably has an identity crisis. He imitates everyone so well he may as well be them 😂
Yup. Seems accurate just blame pogba. Lol
