Having this sent to me right when I’m building my new bookshelf was just perfection. THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH!
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊 Sussurrar  😮😮😮😮😮😮
This girls personality makes this genuinely unwatchable

Ah yes the book on "when a woman says I'm fine" volume 1/4.
1:18 ... sinner 🤣🤣🤣
I have a question can you make a leather bound edition of the Demon slayer manga, but each of the seasons of the shows corresponding manga is in one book
I went from one of the older bookbinding videos to this one and got whiplash within the first two seconds at how different the energy is here compared to back then xD
Are you Jacksapticeye yassifiedversion??
When he just stabbed the box I was like OH NOOOOO
Imagine trying to read that while laying in bed.  lol
1:18 Michael, no!
Robert Jordan,,,,accualy met the guy and got a personliesd signature about a year before he died....R.I.P Robert....Brandon on the other hand...did not expect much but was amazed and utterly suprised and then I started to read his books and woooou he is great ....while in my eyes he is not Robert but he is a worthy inheritor of the fantasy genre....
Pov: What my teacher gives me for homework and acts like I don't fucking have like 4 other classes. My reaction: your house is gonna burn tonight 🤭🤭🤭

vegan goat leather, made from vegan goats
I'm going to need one of these so I can carry it around and flex read in starbucks.
I don’t think that will fit in the pocket of my hoodie 😂
Ok the real gold leaf is way shinyer than the brass leaf.
For the next step you need to glow the front and back cover together so you got an actual wheel that you can turn.
I have the new nuca-Cola girl poster😮
5:14 Flipoff of Time.
Did she include the prequel book? She should have added Brandon Sanderson’s name. He took over the series after Robert Jordan died.
Please keep that leather well oiled so this masterpiece can last forever
I would love to see them do this with all 14 Berserk Deluxe Editions!!!! This is so cool though. This makes me want to learn more about Wheel Of Time. I’m so jealous I want to own this
It's like the Spine...OF THE WORLD....
1:18 - "That's what she said" hahahahahaaaaaaaa
It was pretty cool till you decided to wrap it in the skin of someone
22:35 "FORESHADOWING IS A LITERARY DEVICE"
Man, guess I have to read WoT again . . .
This would be one of those impractical curiosities that a millionare has in a mansion
The poor archivist who finds this book in 700 years will be very, very confused.
I know it's easy to make me cry but i really cried when he said this was what the author always wanted and you had no idea that you made two dreams come true. You're legit so fkn dope.
millennial
I have the first book but I haven't started reading it yet
My Lady .   You are the only person i can think of to pose the question or offer a recommendation, i have a vast old library, i live in New Mexico, I am Reasonably well off, I want my books bound in leather. Many of their pages, are older than your grandparents. I do not seek your personal involvement, but as Elizabeth Taylor said in the film "Cleopatra"... "What right have you to destroy but one human thought..."   I seek these old thoughts being made beautiful, as every human thought is, their words being seen as valuable when i pass, for i have no progeny to inspire like thought.
1:17 😂
Martina: "I'm really nervous to do this."  Everyone watching: "Nahh, she'll be fine!" This turned out so cool, though I think that book might be a little daunting to read.
Que biblioteca sensacional você tem
19:58 Stop playing with yourself. 😆😆
I hate when they just cancelled the show
😂😂😂. Ahem. Heh. Cool video guys! Cool book slinky!
dont worry- we all forgot she had an accent
You are so clever ❤
Really cool
How much did thet weigh?
Subbed!
Leather bound and hand carved.... WOW! I repeat... AMAZING!!!
That book would be half the size if Jordan wasn't so chatty
i've never laughed so hard on book content !!!!!! great job and idea even better
As someone who has read this series many times in the last two decades, I must say your passion for the project, respect for the source material, not to mention how incredible the artwork on that cover was....  Let's just say you've gained a lifetime subscriber =)
I Found this channel too late.... I WANT THE MERCH ITS SO COOL
Me when they say you can only get one book
now the real questiion is did this include the prolog book, jokes aside this need some steampunky contraptions to slinky it either way so it readable
I want one now 🤣
This was very much a pointless "because I can" project.  Sorry I like your work, but this was a pointless waste.
😃😍🤩👏👍🤲💐🤗🥰
I can't wait for the pocket version!
now do this with the horus heresy
0:30 you destroying the books made me cringe 😬
Amazing! ❤
Amazing
Watching you remake these books reminds me of Dr. Moreau.  I don’t know why.
This is so nerd and dumb it happens to be fascinating! 😂
17:23
I need to know how much STAT. I need to commission one mam.
It's all so impracticle but I really want one, lol.
You're so talented!
Book+Slinky it's a BLINKY 😂😂😂
I really wish Robert Jordan could’ve seen this…
I recently saw Daniel grabbing this from his shelf and plonking it down on the table, and I didn't know the story behind it. But once again YouTube provides the answer to questions I didn't even know I had. But damn, this was amazing; the patience to even attempt something like this is flabbergasting.
I must learn to carve leather!
In 100 years , this will probably be worth millions
You guys have to make a book stand for that book to read that book😂😂  Maybe you guys would do that someday
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen!
amazing, such a work of art!!!
The mega tome  The wheel of tome?
This might just be the most insane thing I've ever seen but....I WANT ONE!!!!
This is incredible.
There's madness in your method. And there's method in your madness. That's awesome!
In 20 years when all 10 of The Stormlight Archive books are released, you can do this for them 😂
This but bind the front and back covers together to make a Wheel of Wheel of Time
That is a much larger canvas for a painted edge. XD
Its absolutely amazing😭🔥
kitapların büyüklüğünü birbirine denk getirmeni beklerdim. rendeyle kağıtlar kesilebiliyor. ağaç rendeler gibi yani
Crossover episode of my dreams?! 🤯
I think this was the first video of yours recommended to me by YouTube, but the first one I saw was the finger prosthetic build. Couple things I noticed, you didn't include the co-authors name, Brandon Sanderson, and a.missed opportunity to have the 7 Ajas colors somewhere. Otherwise, beautifully done, absolutely gorgeous. I'd have messed it up myself in a million ways.
PLEASE DO THIS TO STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE ONE DAY
It's beautiful
We need the Red Book of Westmarch, only saw a publisher doing this once.
This wasn't dum. It was awesome.
That's nothing compared to the 129.385 pages long book called: "Women! Why You Can't Understand Them, Ever"
I would love to see you do this with “The Dragon Riders of Pern” series by Anne McCaffrey
Epic meal time for books
You should have made the books into a wheel
Imagine if she glued them out of order
That is the most magnificent log I have ever seen!
I’m honestly impressed that a human being can put this level of effort and detail into an otherwise stupid project, but maybe that’s what makes it special.  “Stupid Projects Require Stupid Solutions.”  - Words of Wisdom from NerdForge.
AMAZING ! <3
7:32 i need that mug omg
Maybe you should've bought your friend the individual books to use as support as they read the GIGUNDA book! Oh and AWESOMMMMME!!
We need to use ratchet straps  Grabs  ratchet  straps off the shelf
I'm writing my own book and now I'm so excited for the ending process.
Blood and ashes! Shaitan! This was more epic than realizing Ma Therese of the Wondrous Ind was Mother Theresa and that Salya who flew to the moon on an eagle made of fire was Sally Ride, and Artur Hawkwing was THE King Arthur Paendrag, and that  Seanchan were essentially American Slavers.
Theres a full length viddy! Youtube popped the short out at me yesterday! Lol noice
Thats not a book, thats a mutant..
I just like watching for the positive vibes
the berserk tattoo🥺
I would not have the patience to do this XD  Extremely impressive!
Ама аз ще те цункам накрая аз тебе, цун-цун-цун-цун
I need to see that book in a bookshelf
I love everything about this video and your creativity and energy is contagious, you got my sub easyy
having that much space in the spine i will love that the desing where a long escene that maybe was evolving in lore from the first book to the last
Me: *subscribes to you* heheh I'm in danger (not supposed to be hate btw I love your vids and ideas)
The Wheel of Time series should have ended after three books, max.
Absolutely amazing, ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As a hobbyist bookbinder, I have seen people use ratchet straps to bind books before. If it works, it works
U kinda look like arya stark
Thank God that you did not privated or remove this video from the recent controversy (which note he is innocent, They were false allegations) because the Journey of making this book is just in general, one of the most amazing processes I have seen on this channel!
So... how does one get one's hands on such an epic tome?
Simply stunning.
Wow, this is incredible! It looks great!
I feel like I just watched months of footage in one 24 minutes video; (obviously that’s what happened but DAMN) where everything was like dodge ball. Bam this bam that bam this, bam that. My brain trying to keep up: 🤯😱🥹 This is absolutely stunning. The craftsmanship is out of this world. If anyone finds this way in the future it’s going into a special museum section of a large library. It would be talked about for many years past. 🥹 I caught my breath at the end when you showed us the end result. I’ve followed you for a long time now, and every single video you wow me more.
That turned out gorgeous!
I use a book binding press for rolling cigars, but I custom made mine, with all the book projects you do, it may be time to upgrade
Watching this in Feb 2025... yikes😬
At first i thought she is character from amazing spider man 😂
Is it dumb? Yes. Is it also a beautiful and extraordinarily well-crafted peace of art? Also yes. You're a creative genius Martina!!!
This was an amazing video that I didn’t know I needed to watch!! Great job 👏
My dad used to read these to me chapter by chapter before bed each night.
Can you put all riordanverse books in one plz 🙏 aka percy jackson
Your skills are extremely impressive. What an honor to RJs legacy!
Где взять эту крутую кофту ?
Please bring back hoodies and joggers!!!
now do the cosmere
Why are all of your products "limited editions" that are sold out? Why bother having a store if there's nothing to purchase in it?
I respect the grind. Now I'm a tad curious about checking out this series.
Your work is amazing! Really! IT is AMAZING!
K the last book i read was a witcher book and it was a long time ago. I got work to do...
Drope the Ghost Cryptic Cropped Hoodie again please 😭
Has anyone shown this to Robert Jordan's widow? I think she'd appreciate this❤
I feel accomplished having read only half the series so far.
This is my first time seeing her video when I saw bunch of names i thought it's the end credits and i have to see part 2 of this book. Then I realised that this video is not yet over 😂😂
I had to check if he has this monster on his shelves. He does. <3 So cool.
Can you plz make one book for me like this?  Let me know the charges plz..
"This is oddly satisfying."
Put the book in a giant rolodex
One of my all time favorite book series. Remember checking Robert Jordans blog back in high school for all updates on when the next book at that time would release. Also remember how he tragically passed before he finished the series. Brandon did a great job finishing the series in his stead.
Heavy reading indeed
So about 3/4 of a Malazan or Discworld and neither of those have endless references to arms and their position in relation to breasts...I will take either of the longer books please.
Legendary
gurl are you tinker bell?
amazing and inspiring !
Sorry dude, I doubt Sanderson is jealous anymore.
Uhhh with such a bendy book you coulda just made a wheel outa it 🤔
You probably could have left out about the middle 5 volumes without changing anything, much like Robert Jordan could have.  (I love these books, but holy cow nothing happened for a looooooooooooooong time in the middle).
İf you begin to read this book today you will finish it at 60 years old
As a 30yr fan of the series, this is really cool. This would be such an awesome centerpiece to have for a book collection
No, not one of, it is your FAVORITE book series 😂
That is the most amazing Blinky I have ever seen
Kerro sit joskus jos oli jotain hyvää siel
Niin mikä tämä oli ku välissä ette antanu jaa ja sitte sainki pitää tai kuka pitää noita kirjoja
I just need an e-book version that just keeps going. For all series.
My bestie sent this to me when I was reading the wheel of time for the first time. Instant subscribes!!! Thank youuuuuuuuu (5 second later: edit) Also, I wonder if you'd add, like, a print or poster or SOMETHING like that to your merch list? Us WoT Fans would probably LOVE that! Both my dad and I love the series, and IF YOU HAD ONE I would most definitely buy it for his birthday.
You guys are crazy you are using real leather right? It always look stunning
That is a thing of beauty.  Wowsers!!
10:16 What's the music?
I would’ve had a similar reaction if I had gotten this book in the mail. And I’m not that big a fan of Wheel of Time. I like the series but never read the books. Maybe I should.
Not me finding this video and the giveaway a year later xD Ty Youtube
I put all the Wheel of Time books into a single eBook file.  It fits on my smallest microSD card.  Its smaller than my pinky fingernail.
So friggin amazing ❤
How to understand woman ahh book 💀
What else can you do to turn book set into one massive book? It could be interesting to watch
Oh my god, that book looks incredible! If you enjoyed crafting that, I have some suggestions for other book series you could do: Shannara Discworld Stormlight Archive Everything Tolkien Realm of the Elderlings Riftwar Cycle Chronicles of Pern.
I just discovered your channel a few days ago and love it so much!!! You guys are like mega talented  I was thinking now that you have this huge book, maybe you could paint something on the edges lol that would be amazing
The dumbest crap I have seen this year so far 2025.
I think it can also be read while in a half circle shape❤❤❤🎉
Is there no way to get this end result without using animal skin? I don't understand harming animals for this purpose.
I love the wheel of time so lucky
Over 1200 pages 😮😊👏  Stephen king 🗿💀🙂👏
14:31 Like an actually stain I guess, since you can never really get them out 😂
A song of ice and fire should be your next adventure
i think Robert Jordans wife would love something like this. I definitely snorted so hard when you bend the entire thing in half lol. SLINKY! I wish Mr. Jordan was alive to see how loved and timeless his novel has become. I believe he would have been enamored and floored by what you have done to the rebinding of his books. I need to see if you have a shop for rebindings... Edited this so many times. that hoodie looks awesome.
And succeeded in creating Hell on Earth.
23:37 "And for today's biceps workout I'm gonna read two chapters of The Wheel of Time"
And I thought it was boring and long in book one
Part of me is intimidated by that but then the other part of me would want to read it just to say I did😂
5:30 I can see a weaver looking at that at level one (this is what you can be) and go "f* that, I'm going woodsman" yes, table top rpg, it's real... rare, but real
Is there a link to the actual video of him opening it?
You can read and build biceps at the same time...😂
Outlander next!!!!!!
Happy new year to the video that convinced me to read the entirety of Wheel Of Time in 2024! 🎉 Wishing everyone here inspiration for 2025~
Lo que es tener plata 😂
The other day I asked a kandra for the time. He said it’d be ten soon
the pain of watching you cut up the book 😥😭😭 I get it but still...
If you took out all the "Repeating" he did in the books you could bring it down to about 8 to 10 books.
I knew it was going to be Daniel.
Why not make continuous (endless) belt.  Ouroboros Style. Add more stupidity : make a möbius strip book.
I was I had even a fraction of the energy you have. lol
You have Viking Size ? XL-T (I habe a normal body but I huge chest and large shoulders 2 meters tall) im viking sized. NOT Gnome sized ri ckoths suck for me - not cleithe but findng cool ones that fit!!!
Bahhhhhh bahhhhhh
Hair is so cool
I think it's very smart
What about New Spring?
This belongs in a museum
Fun fact! ☝️🤓 — a collection of literally works comprised within in a single volume (such as the entire wheel of time series in this one of a kind slinky book) is officially known as....an ✨ *"omnibus"* ✨
Cool! Now go read it in the subway
This stupid project is a labor of love.💙
Normal sized book for Loial
next step lets see if it can slinky down your stairwell
AMAZING
F'ing STAGGERING!!! WOWWOWWOW!!
are u german ?
Ok do yall use , for . and . for , or what
A quick question. What´s the pros and cons of carving it while the leather is already on the book vs carving it before putting it on?
The amount of patience you have is unbelievable. I knew you were an artist but until this video I didn't know how much of an artist you were. Beautiful work now you just made a book that's worth 10,000 + dollars😅
All George RR Martin books in order, in one volume?
All Tolkien books in order, in one volume?
Having a notion of how common items are "supposed to" look is wild. I was surprised when the rachet straps were white instead of neon green, orange, or camoflage pattern
Should do cosmere next
Oh! My! Gosh!  I just happened to come across your video 😮 You are THE most talented artist ever!!!  Thank you for sharing your talent!!!!
This is crazy. Want to know something really crazy? I have read this”book” cover to cover—several times!!!
The misaligned pages stick out like a sore thumb :( Should've cut them.
This is amazing.
DO WANT
Can you do a special of how to read this in bed before you go to sleep? 😅
❤❤❤❤
I never thought that watching someone bind books would be so much fun and so entertaining ! Watching such magnificent craftsmanship is mesmerizing !! :-)
great. Now I want a Nuka-Cola fridge
I am seeing DHL and thinking: Nur ein deutscher würde auf so eine wahnwitzige idee kommen, couldnt be me
Does Sanderson know about this. Would love to see his reaction to finding out about this like reaction video or being shown a clip of this video on stream/podcast.
Martina's face for the firts book she cut😂
You mean T H I C C
Now that I look at it with all of the books stacked together it's no wonder that it's taken me literally years to read.
Why? 🩷
Love it.
am i the only one who liked the sketch 4:17 better lol it was so cute but the second one is cool too
I Knew it, Daniel Green!!
Where are the sketchbook bundle on the store page?
Julius grimoire
Always kewl. I was a bit surprised that you didn't make the book into a wheel. It is Wheel of time after all.
Just when I though it couldn't get any better. That's when I see this chaotic masterpiece.
I read the Swedish translation of it as a kid before it was finished. It was broken up in 23 books at the time xD Massive series. Can't imagine reading it all as one book xD The temptation of anyone who visits to move the bookmark would be too large haha.
I need that this story is awesome.
Can i make another book suggestion? Eragon enough said
Aw no! You changed the vid title 😢 I loved “I made a 12,000 page bookbinding abomination”. It captured the whimsy and absurdity of the project. I mean I can’t blame you since the Brandy Sandman Why You Write So Long vid is taking off and you’ve gotta mine the YT algorithm while you can…
You should have made it a donut shape...in fact, a Wheel.
My favorite series!! So lucky... whoever is getting that.
slinky book! omg you made a book that needs a wheelbarrow! how very fitting <3
16:15 whats the song??
I have the wheel of time in one book on my kindle
The Wheel Of Time is one of my all-time favorite series! Top 3 for sure
are you sure that not the book,  "Understanding a Woman'?
if you are having trouble with the size of a given text, just shrink the font size, may be hard to read but it is functional!
I never finished this series, some charasters were just getting on my nerves  too much. Can someone mark their answer as spoiler and let me know how Nyneiva ended? She and Lan were only ones who interested me when I let it go .....
That one epub file that I have
Without looking at the comments I had a feeling it might be Daniel that got it, just to realise when he was revealed that I have seen it on his shelf.
Love all your projects and this book title chur
When she said "The gold leaf is so flimsy, like when you breath on it whaaea Edit: when he said "Its the wheal of tieme" had gotten me😂😂
I'll put this out there so you can consider it for future leatherwork endeavors: you can buy the dye/paint that automotive upholstery shops use to recondition leather and leatherette seats. It's basically a rubberized acrylic paint specifically designed to bond to leather and vinyl while remaining flexible and compliant. While not exactly designed to be applied with brushes, you can do so if you wish. Just a reminder that you may want to create a silicone cast of some nice leather texture so you can imprint it back into the paint if you apply it too thick. Also as a side note: most automotive leather dye/paint is designed to be applied either with a sponge or with an airbrush, so you can actually airbrush or sponge gradients with it if you buy enough colors.
Imagine this as a sketchbook.. damn that’ll last like forever
"You can only bring one book"
I saw an QURAN😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤🕋🕌🌊💧💨🌬️🌨️🌩️⛈️🌧️🌦️☁️🌥️🌥️⛅️🌤️
Side note the background being real and not a green screen gagged me
in 20-30 years you should do one of these for the Stormlight Archive
just the cover of this masterpiece is worth more than everything in any designer store
Her : lets see what will happen if i make it a bridge  The book :MY BACK HELPPPPPPPPPPPPP ITS BROKEN!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂 6:46  About 6:20
Who has watched this multiple times but they keep watching it because it’s so entertaining
She is supeeeeerr talented.. i really like her crafts ❤
try to imagine reading like watching monitor angle
1:17 whyd she laugh and say. “Thats not long enough” 😭 😭 🙏🏻
Imagine you see someone in class with this 💀💀
Caraca, que doidera, muito legal
I'm amazed at how you are a master of so many crafts. How do you do it?
.
A commercial print shop could cut the pages to the same length  (before it was bound of course).
this is so large that my brain cannot comprehend that this is a book
I literally just forgot she had one less finger than we all do
5:14 POV: me in the 1st grade trying to do that with my slinky down the stairs and failing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
id love for this to be an actual book. id love to write in it
💀<-😮😎
not funny
When I come to this video after watching her video about her losing her finger I FINALLY NOTICE IT
19:56
"STOP playing with your self was crazy
This is the definition of Di why  It’s sooo cool thooooo That is the most epic book that will ever be created
when Wildbow finally publishes Worm...
How do you stay so motivated to finish such a big project?
This reminds me of that giant book from that one episode of spongebob
This is probably one of the most amazing and absurd things I've ever seen on the internet and I want more.
You can actually solve the alignment problem by sanding it. After you glue them, keep them pressed and sand the paper, it will become very smooth and beautiful and will look like a single book.
her accent makes her videos 10 times better
Why was it so satisfying when she was carving the book
that hoodie you are selling is the first good looking clohtes i ever see any youtuber ever sell. feels weird
This made me think of the C S Lewis quote where he said "I am yet to find a cup of tea large enough or book long enough to satisfy me."  I wonder if this would do 🤔
That one random book at granny’s house:
Love the skip to highlight feature... straight up Skipped to 16.56 exactly where it needed to be! Damn!
you made it look so fun, but this is so hard to do. You are so bold and brave to move boundaries to the limit. You got my total respect.
I think i could build a hand cranked wheel that holds the book and as you turn pages you can similar to the trim wheel on an airplane just give it a little turn and one end of the book will lower an amount equal to the other end being lifted up.       think like a super moving slinky actions in your hands....... so you could read it much like reading from scrolls.             ooooo        you could do that!!!!          make a book but as a scroll!!!
Alternate Title: Gluing paper back into a tree
I saw the title of the video and immedeatly thought: "That would neatly fit The Wheel Of Time in it."
How can you'll read it?
Reminds me of the yearbook from Assassination Classroom.
How many forests did that take?
8:37 That’s Barca! Viska Barca! 💙❤️💙❤️
Thats sick 😂❤❤
Бля, я подумала, це Поліна Майко
As profi i am impressed
dream do come true for nerdforge with her art skills 😛
This is the worlds largest book by word count, character count, and page count
Imagine if authors did this as a special limited edition thing
If somebody proposes me with such a book i would gladly accept them 😌
5:51  alternate title: how to make a book slinkie
thats one way to fill an empty shelf
So, 1. No one will read it. Impractical. 2. It's hardcover!!!! It's beautiful and gave u alot of attraction 🎉.  So worth it.
17:23 I'm not gonna question
I like how she said don't show this to a professional book maker well I'm here now hi I'm a professional book maker
What glue do you use
The authors of WOT: “creates new book” NerdForge: Oh god, time to get all the books again and redo it, in another 24min video.
This video has very intensive vibes. I appreciate.
Can you bind all the harry poter books?😅 I fell like that will be a journey too! (Unless you already did it)
Oh my gosh, you’re a hair color is exactly the color of my friends hair pink on one side and purple on the other that’s so cool!
Who is watching this in October 👇🏻
POV:Nerdforge is you grate grandma and u find this in ur house
That book series must of been amazing
Teacher: Bring your favourite book tommorow.  Me: Okie!   *The book*
I wish you would make me a hp one
This is volume one on how to understand woman
She is so freaking talented! I feel like she can do anything   :)

There is my math book in the making 😅
Next connect all the one piece 3 in 1’s
I WANT THISSSSSS!!!! I NEEEDD IT!!!!!!!

I love her voice
I like to read in bed. Not sure how I would hold this though😮😅

It would be so cool if the leather was layered so you could feel the design at the same time!  Good work though!
Can you bind all the dictionaries
I didn't know there was such thing as carving leather until now
is the other guy norwegien
what program do you use to sketch???
Imagine getting the order wrong…just one book is all it takes……
If you have 2 over them you have a huge science project
I feel like this should be in a museum.
Could have sanded down the sides to even out the pages some. Circular sander with appropriate grit paper would work a treat.
okay, quick question, is this merch (the pants and the hoodie) still available? if not, please make it available agaain!
I can't decide if this is awful or awesome😅. Question, what do you do with the old covers?  Suggestion : sand the pages even I think I would love a leather case to put my books in. And you have been good taste, when of time is an old favourite and the main reason why I learned English. I just couldn't wait for translations. And I discovered Brandon Sanderson work... Btw, you should totally do a Stormlight Archive monster book too. I mean in a decade, when all ten books are published.
10:07 I thought this was the end. 🙃
You forgot New Spring
Me worried I would put them out of order lol
I wanna walk into the library with a book like this and record peoples reactions
This is crazy how do you do this is super cool 😮
You should definitely take that to a coffee shop and bust it out of a backpack or rolled luggage and start reading it.
you should bind all of throne of glass, acotar, and crescent city together
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 FANTASTIC LABOR OF LOVE!❤❤❤
Imagine being the creator of the book and seeing THIS.
It’s a book monster
Hey what book are you reading?  Just the entire wheel of time series.
OMG FUCKING DUDE YOU GUYS ARE AMAZONING i all the time think same college like you guys to  learn how are you guys so good
OMG I love this. And you are my kindred spirit. I am so doing this with my Harry Potter books LOL
no bcs imagine if you put one the wrong way......
A bookworm
It looks amazing!!❤❤ Also what is you nationality?? i just relized your accent kinda sounds like mine
My brain still can’t figure out how she managed to keep all the volumes in order, properly oriented, etc. In the chaos of the making, at my house, bits wind up scrambled somehow, pretty much no matter what, even with relatively straight forward little projects. Very well done!!
But who noticed her left hand pinky is missing
Not gonna put Brandon Sanderson on the book? 😢
POV: Fnaf lore

I definitely understand most of the words you say in your videos.......😅
Do you think that one loud house fanfic could fit in there
All you need now is a bispoke reading stand, which will allow the book to be opened like a wave as you read????
Its literally a meme in real life.
it should be called a blinky (slinky and book)
this is really cool if you wanna read the middle while stood up, otherwise it looks terrible
Amazing artistry!
Its so beautiful but i woudn’t have the time for it
the fact that the separated pages are seen is something i would personally fix.... would drive my nerves crazy if i would be reading and seein that all the time
Imagine if you did this with all 105 Warriors books 💀
Shipped to Daniel Greene.  Thank me later.
17:15 pov thefnaf lore
I can’t find the reference video for how to do the headbands with two coloured threads. In which video do you explain this? It looks so cool!
Fun idea and lovely outcome! Did you injure yourself doing this crazy project?? All of a sudden you had an arm/wrist brace on (~12 min in)
Wut about calling it “boslink” (That’s spelled bu-slink as in book slinky.)
That's a... that's a... a real page turner.
slinky book
Are you able to do the same with 1,000 volumes of the manga One Piece? One thousand volumes into one big MASSIVE BOOK!!
How that one page of reading for school feels like:
What kind of Music did you use in the Video. It's really good
My mom says you messed up. Since it's called "the wheel of time" you should have made it into a book wheel.😂 don't ask me how.
Hey, some advice for the future if you were to make such a thick book again. To ensure that all pages are equally cut, you can take it to a CNC job shop or anywhere that has milling machines and have them plan the whole thing. Type planning sufrface into the internet and you'll understand what I mean ;)
I want to say that this might be the video that finally got me to read this series. This came out around January and I didn't see it until February. I'm now a handful of chapters into book 8.
Please don’t drop it on your face 😂😂😂
It needs a scissor lift 😂😂😂
guys look up the show the wheel of time its really good trust
Imagine doing it and then finding out one is backwards
She sounds swedish
For the book "How to understand queens" you would need 15 of these abominations.
Imagine there will be a new addition to the book series
Personally I’d’ve preferred the smaller editions as that would be slightly more consistent and somewhat smaller (due to the denser script) Also because yay small font Love this tho
I've seen an artist who paints the paper sides of the book (don't know what that part of the book is called), but it would be cooler if you add that😍
You should do harry potter
Someone needs to make like 100000 more and ship them out to people who want it.
Can I just get the book set 😅😅
You NEED to make a Harry Potter version
Outstanding!!!!!!
The way she says let’s have a look at his reaction then and ad come on right after
1:16 did she just make a that's what she said lmao
this is stunning and you're so talented! ...but how the hell do you read that 😭
You should do the same thing again but with all Harry Potter books
This is the most beautiful monstrosity I’ve ever seen.
I agree. This is the dumbest project you have ever made, but it is totally worth it❤
Sent this video to my partner’s sibling, who is a professional bookbinder 🖤
Is there harry potter theme in displate?
❤❤❤❤
If fnaf lore was a book one. Single. Book:
the writer just had their biggest ad ever
I think this is my favorite build! Its so farcicaly absurd, and so well done! Kudos to the Nerdforge team!
It’s a Blinky.
Wow😱 epic
Ok this is 100% wishful thinking but gosh if someday when my book is published if you were to rebind it I’d probably cry from joy lol
Pov: one single Harry Potter book
maybe, if we would live together, i could help you!? who knew?
not the displate sponsorship 🤮
The general public's reaction when this book is found in 200 years:  "And Robert Jordan was paid by the word."
At least someone made a book that is right sized for a dwarf fortress manual.
"Its not an easy reading experoence"   Bro the wheel of time normally isnt an easy reading experience, its taken me 4 years and im only 2/3 of the way through it
WOW WOW WOW , ever thought of doing the Harry Potter book series as well ??
ps: IM CALLED MARTINA TOO😭😭🌹❤️
I love your library thing where you create stuff
Yeah, Robert Jordan said his last book (published as the last 3) was going to be a single book even if they had to invent a new book binding process to make it happen. Obviously, not editing out _anything_ he wrote himself, and actual business realities ended up taking priority in the end, but I feel like he would have really appreciated this project!
Random videos that i have never watched popps up on my fyp and i love it❤
I've never heard of this series, but now I'm going to try it out!
Ngl rn I love the songs and can’t find them. Like it’s literally a play list 😭
My bestie thought u were Melanie Martinez 😂       I get it thought ( the split dye )
Is it bad I want to see her do this to all of the manga of one piece when it ends lol.
wow
5:18 Imagine passing by someone’s window and hearing this manic laugh coming from it 😂😂😂
Well very good ;)
AVADA KEDAVRA!
It’s like that One Piece book that has the entire manga all in one.
My extra side just went; ..What about staining the outer layer of the paper so it isn't white but gold from those angles... And I realised she may be insane, but not that insane.🤣
I was watching a video about clay trinket dishes when this video popped up to watch next. Got curious from the thumbnail. I have never read or heard of the wheel of time, about you but I'm so glad i stumbled upon this! The sheer art you just did with the cover?!!! wowww! The dedication to do this! and loved the reaction of Daniel as well! Now this makes me curious about the books as well.
Don't  know why but she gives a very vintage and warm vibe ❤ Love her videos 😊
not everyday where you see a book spine bigger than the covers combined 😅
would that loudhouse fanfiction fit on this?
It’s insane 😱❤️‍🔥
16:55 i just ad 😅
This is tribute code Brazilian?
at 5:56 for 2 seconds it sounded like placing an oak log in minecraft. I promise go look!!!   (pls dont let this get lost in all the comments)
This is the first time I’ve seen your videos and you’re awesome🥹
The amount of respect I have for you is crazy high
"modern problems require modern solutions, and as we grow and develop, the absurd problems today will become the new standard tomorrow, and this is a day that was ventured and discoveries were made" - The weird and philosophical side of my broken down brain
3:08 vibe ❤️‍🔥
Well, I've already read a 3200 page book, so I think I could read a book like that in a few months😂
I need a diary that size to document every single mistake and cringe moment I've had in the past 6 months.
Make the book the wheel of/next time.
I hit "like" even before I watch your videos.
Maesters in game of thrones/ASOIAF be like
At first I’ve read “I’ve made a 12,000 pages bookkeeping administration”
okay but i want to see the author  react  to  this!!!
I used more money that I'd care to admit and more years than I like to collect hardcovers for the whole WoT series so this makes me a little sad... 😥 Otherwise this is pretty neat! 😀 Edit: How WOULD you read it though? I know, it is more a shelf piece now that actually for reading but... Oh well. 😉
Wow, such a stupid thing you did😂😂😂😂
the last stormlight book will be twice this size.
5:54 ITS A BLINKY
I can not find the reaction video anywhere there are n mentiones and not info about it
This was the most awesome  thing ive seen u make!!!!! It is soo detailed !!!!
That is the most beautiful useless thing I’ve ever seen
ah, finally a book good enought to hide my booze flask, it truely is the goodest of books
I could tell just from the thumbnail it would be Wheel of Time lol
Make a book mark pls
Now that's a booooooooooook.
When Sanderson made his entries to the series he used fan names to name characters via a drawing - I got my name drawn and am Krisa in book 14 - I love this project so much
Not physically possible. Don’t believe everything u see on internet. This is clearly AI generated book.
You are one of the most variously creative and productive people I've ever not met.  Impressive.
19:12 too funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
17:21 AaAghghghgaghugh😂😂😂😂😂
“no trees were harmed in the making of this video”💀
Can you make me a five clover grimoire from black clover please
if i were to guess what this book is just by looking at the size then i'd say the complete fnaf lore volume 1 of 58
Blessed be thy algorithm for recommend this to me.
Absolutely gorgeous.. the only thing I might have done would be color/antique the page edges but as someone who used to do things like this and now just sits and watches people.. beautiful job.
Nerdforge who much would you charge to bind the Harry Potter books or maybe a different series all in one for my ten year old?
20:46 i think that was the more disrespectful, stupid thning i´ve ever seen ever.
you earn my respect
If only people offered custom leather book binding
Grandparents:here is my great great great great great grandmothers cook book been passed down for generations
" the art of understanding women part one of 24"
The book we asked our parents to read to us before bed😂
SOMEONE SHOW THIS TO A PROFESSIONAL BOOKBINDER SO WE CAN GET A REACTION
I like how you made that!! It’s so cool.
Let me just grab my handy dandy stool so I can reach… ah yes.. chapter 1 😂
will the sweaters be in stock again?? Really want one
Not the ‘SKJERA BAGERA’
Friend: Hey I heard you have the full collection of these books. Would you mind if I borrow the first book? -No sorry I don’t really the first one but I actually have something even better😊 -Oh really? -Yeah here is it: -😮
17:24  and 19:13  underrated moments
Amagine that this was you only book an you pull up to school with it 😂
Love the fallout themed kitchen 7:51   Also is any one here in 2024
The page numbers. There is going to be so many page 1s…
Oh Lord, i love it so mutch! Can you make a Dark Tower Compendium? in one Book? XD
Books slinky more like blinky
Average bible
Martina can you make the book from How to Train Your Dragon, it's a leather-bound book that is amazing they even made a special episode about the dragon in it
Me half-heartedly waiting for the surprise YouTuber reveal: 😶 Me when it’s Daniel Greene: YES!👏  Perfection 👌 Well deserved 🎉
Hi Mr. Plank!
Is it just me or does she look like Lara Croft? That's not a bad thing.
You may think this is dumb but I think if Robert Jordan had been able to see this, he’d have a smile on his face and tears in his eyes.
*le weese*
I actually dont think you need to this much act like a boy for a youtube success.
A fun thing would have been to make a binding loop to turn it into an actual wheel.
You should do Harry potter❤😂
Anyone who sees that book, will be tired, instead of reading it
"i have the wheel of time book" "oh cool which one?" "i said THE wheel of time BOOK, not books"
Amazing
Imagine getting that book for a book report
Nice, she made the pocket version of "The non exhaustive list of why I'm a failure"
I wanna be an author when i grow up so im gonna have to do the front covers (and then u buying em and changing it)
you shoudl do one for the harry potter sieries
Next time use pipe clamps and save yourself some trouble
Wow NICE!
A book series that I like is warrior cats
You need to build a "Monster Book Reading Elevator" to be able to read the book!
That’s tall😳
Ahh I love this book amazing content!
The Bible.
The bookmaker watching this be like: 😲HOW DAR- oh, oh, oh nice
First time ever watching your channel, i love the background and your hair
You are so Talent!!!🤩🤩
Even the Bible shakes in its boots while looking at that
This is amazing I would never have the patience for it
I need to send this to my teacher 😂
Dang you put so much hard work  to some stupidity  but at the end results it looks like good as new! And cool place you got there and am a new  Subscriber  I like this content!
The book is magic wiht breahting and elementary gold thing bro basically desrcrubed hamon form jojos 😭
Wow amazing drawer
I’m making a comic right now, I believe this is how I will feel finishing all the panels and gluing the book together. 😭   Also is it just me or do people with two-toned hair are the most creative and determined people I’ve seen? Like alya!
What about the page counter
Is no one gonna talk about how magical the room is it looks like its out of  a fairy tail
No. They only can be one!
Do wings of Fire
I can't believe I just now found this channel. It's like it was made just for me. I'll be going through your back log for quite a while. Thank you for your hard work.
Ableist unless you do the large print version!
5:06 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH😂😂😂😂
12,000 pages of what men know about womeb, every page blank
Holy fuuuhuug
Imagine if it was one piece
Imagine bringing this book to school 😂
How can you bring that to school
This project reminds me of that one scene in the inspector gadget movie with the manual
Does anyone notice that when the book is bending it looks like the n in the nickelodeon logo?
Imagine losing your bookmark in that 💀
Watching her destroy books and put them back together hurts and makes me happy at the same time :P love ur vids!
You need to try the harry Potter 👦⚡📙🧙‍♂️series
If you like Percy Jackson, you should do Percy Jackson next only the original five though that would be way too much because there’s like 15 or 16 books
If you (or anyone reading) makes a(nother) series compendium like this run the books through a table/band saw first to remove the glue from the original binding. It'll make it so the pages don't clump together like they do (each volume has a noticeable "break point") during the bend test.
i have a gut feeling you like harry potter.
Wandering inn
You are very wasteful because you are using gold leave that is $1 million the heck Martina???????!!!!!!!!!!!!! i’m shouting at you right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the dumbest thing you have ever done nerdforge??????????!!!!!!!!!!!
Wheel of time is in my Top 3 Book Series (depends on what day you aske me wether it is 1, 2, or 3) it Kinda Hurt to watch you Destroy the original cover but was also really Rewarding to see the Final Product.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
13:52 LE GASP! AN UNBREAKABLE SPINE! If only all of my books had this magical power 😢
You’ll have to get a stool to get to the 1st page 😂
Det er så dumt, men så morsomt og se på😂
this would take the whole wheel of time to read     literally and figuratively
"Stop playing with yourself" 😂
Imagine reading this
😮😮
You inspired me to make videos ages ago! I wanna be as talented as you when I’m older 😊
hmmmhh yeah thats not long enough. walks away (thats whats sh) cuts off haahahahhaha
20:55
does someone know the name of the song at 9:40 ?
Do the same with the Harry Potter series please.❤❤🎉🎉😊😊
You know instead of doing one big book for a conclusive picture you could do a cover set i had one i couldnt remember the name of the series but the books all together made one big picture it was amazing its also populer to do that for film series to on tape. But this is still awsome
Put this on a round table. Then you can read the book by moving around the table.
Can I get it please😖🤣
T H E  M E G A  B O O K
Actually-🤓☝️
Does this leather expires?
18:02 just too sus
My question are you going to read all that
You should do that again with the FULL seasers of the Harry Potter books
14:15  Water, earth, fire, air
24:03
Because of you I bought the first volume of the wheel of time……I’m excited to read, let’s see if I’ll be obsessed
The patience and time u put into something so Randy is just a French kiss
The ad before I watched this was something that you take to relieve diarrhea
If I owned those books, I would definitely buy that if it was a case for them
You are from norway
You know what you should do you should take the longest series in the world and combine them all together like you’re doing now
wished you'd used paperback
I feel like that could be a Harry Potter book
Loved the scene looking at the door by the kitchen! Had a Shinning vibe!
Combine all of the bible and do this
Holy. S*$!. This is the most epic leather working I have ever seen!! The dying technique is so crisp, I got goosebumps watching it come to life!🤯💕
22:41
who is your favorite author? the original or brandon sanderson?
What the other kids think the size of the book I’m reading:
pov: you're taking your Order of the Phoenix book to school
I saw the title and clicked on the video thinking 'lmao thats just the wheel of time' and lo and behold
i came across ur channel by chance. awesome content. u gained a true fan here
My jaw litterally dropped when i saw the final thing, im not even kiding
WOW!!! Just wow!!! This is just stunning!!!!!! 😮😮😮❤❤❤🐲🐲🐲🕰️🕰️🕰️☸️☸️☸️
Living out a cottagecore fantasy fr
When you complained that the books weren't aligned and then proceeded to strap them together, I fully expected you to pull out an orbital sander or something. 😂  That said, the misalignments kinda kill it for me... considering the amount of hours put into it, I think I'd have taken 1 more to trim the pages and then gilded the edges for that extra polished look.
I. LOVE. The Wheel Of Time, and the show!!!
I wish Robert Jordan were still alive to be able to see this creation. It’s amazing
U are crazy talented I want to do this to the belgariad
7:21 OMG, the clock in the Timelapse was such a brilliant idea that works so well 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
Am in love! Girl you are amazing, pure beauty and joy  Wish you all the best in your life
I just wish you trimmed the pages so they all matched
Honestly I’m half through the video and someone gifted me something like this it would immediately be a family heirloom.
Can i eat it
At the end this looks amazing! Wow
This book way made for walking, and that’s just what it’ll do, one of these days this book is gonna walk all over you…
18:57 You entrusted it to Drunks Handling Letters.  Nice.
The legs of time 😂
You know, this book is very long, kinda like a worm. Suppose you could call it a bookworm
POV my English essay   :
I seriously must say a thing...cute voice lol
Now, this needs a scale sytem with gears and a handle and stuff to just have it turn the pages up and down.
Imagine she finish all of this, and one of the book is upside down
“Yeah, that’s not long enough… That’s what she-“ 💀  Time: 1:17
Can we please have a glue super cut?
Wow you're so talented
What is the book series?
Imagine writing a book report on that
This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen…and I freaking love it 😂❤
On today’s episode of martina destroy books Daniel’s reaction was so cute
I can’t believe I missed the third sketchbook until it was sold out 😢 anyone reselling them?
This is so amazing, I'm jealous of Daniel Green
What about the flame of Tar Valon and the Dragon's Flame? Also, this was AWESOME! I read some of that series a while ago, it was really great. Another series I like is Keeper of the Lost Cities. You should read it!
Stupid? Genius!
I love this and my husband is a huge Wheel of Time fan and i am tempted to make my own version of this for him at some point in the future.  I do have a thought for something you could have attempted when the book blocks were not all the exact same size. You could have tried to sand the sides the best you could to even them out. It's more important to line up the spines more than anything. This still turned out amazing and glad the receiver loved it.
Omg, can you make the pocket version? I don't think they fit in my bag, it's a little big 🥺‼️
It turned out so good the only way it would of been better is if you painted the edges with characters from the book or some iconic Sean’s from the book.
Love the Art 😍 🎨
It must be exhausting having to one up every video to boost your ratings and views...i mean when is enough, enough? 😅
You are totally bonkers but this is amazing!
15:19 good job covering the pages!
I want to marry you
Imagine you did all of this, just for a few of them to be out of order
Pure chaos 😂😂😂. I'm calling the book binding authorities 😂❤
You made his lifetime
Wait, how did you draw all of that on the spine? You drew on the baking paper… but how did you get it on the spine?
This is the first Nerdforge video I've ever seen and I feel like I've struck gold. I've been looking for art channels that do more than just illustration and I'm really into this whole vibe. Goofy concepts executed with the highest possible production value are my favorite thing.
Watching you play with the slinky book before the cover went on was the best part of the video.
What!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯that is so crazy!!!!...ahem!  sit down boy and girls lemme read you a story...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i would be that person to make that and just hang it on my shelf to be admired and never read it
I wold finish that in 10 years
I did that in school and ripped the books 😂😂😂 whoops
it hurts
You didn't go through and write all the page numbers but it's ok
I uasally dont buy Merch beacouse They are so basic but WHEN i saw ur merch i desided im gonna buy !
How much would something like this cost to buy. I know in the thousands but how many thousands
You're the most talented person, I'm amazed with your creativity. And your purple room is divine, kind of a mix between a Hobbit hole and a witch den. Love, love this video.
give.
Why does she sound russian
imagine going through all that work and realize you put the books together in the wrong order
Dra åt skogen vilken träningsverk efter läst första delen.
You call that an abomination, but is it really? The only true abomination is what Amazon did to these books...
Imagine losing your page in this book☠️
I picture Brandon Sanderson rubbing his hands and drooling over megabook...
I think that book is the entire fnaf lore
I just discovered this channel and OMG HOW ARE YOU SO TALENTED! ? awesome vid
Girl literally made a priceless treasure as a joke.
I didn't discover your channel until this month! It's wonderful! Is there any chance you'll restock the joggers? I'd love to buy a pair 😊
I started reading this series because of this short
Do this with animorphs
here from tiktok! what an amazing process, super satisfying, thanks for sharing <3
I wanna sand down the pages so bad
very clever, and bueatiful woman
Robert Jordan is looking down and saying "Finally a binding fitting of my books"
6:43 OOOOOI boy!
Please 🙏🏻 I need a restock of the sweats!!!
You should do the opposite of this with the Stormlight Archives. A set with each part being bound separately would be amazing! I get so tired of holding those 1200 page monsters
Imagine if your friend went to go read it and be on book four and go to the next book and it's book six... 😂
Honestly I didn't think the opening of the book was funny, but y'all were so hysterical I couldn't help but laugh.  Also, when you started to put the gold leaf on I got emotional.
Absolutely incredible! Well done!
Should have been a cylindrical book. Because wheel.
I would pay for this, how much?? My boyfriend and I are both incredibly in absolute love with this series. Any chance you would quote me a price?
when she said "I have a plan to make something dumb" I looked at my screen and was like "when she gonna say again"
As bookbinding student... I have seen more crimes here than I can count... As book lover OMFG I LOVEEEE THAT!!!😍😍
THIS IS BEYOND PERFECTION 💯/ 💯👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
How much would I have to pay to get a copy of this behemoth??
Also, it looks better to me. On the different books... Some say ROBERT JORDAN, others Robert Jordan. The logo is in different sizes and colours. The spines just don't match.
22:52 Ah, 515k abonnenter, ey? :)            Well, now he's got 540k and since this comment even one more.            Obviously abonnneter is subscribers from context, but to me as a Dutch it registers immediately as abbonees.             Having said this though, my language setting is on English (UK). I started using Youtube when there wasn't NL, so I'm used to the English anyhow. Why change?
Like at the end where she tries to have a straight face while predeing to read it😂
WOW
as always great job, and thank you, i was looking for a new book series. this one should keep me going for some time
“What is your favorite book?” “The Wheel of Time” “Which one?” “Yes”
1:17 hey im average lol hahahaha
First video I watch of her and now I am certain she is the living incarnation of ADHD multi tasking and learning power.
It is tanned with veggies
It also has toez
Nothing is dumb
After watching this video i Would love to see you try to reverse engineer dragonscale bookbinding
please, in lords Oda name, do One Piece!
5:09 to 6:04  XDDDDDD best part of the vid
It's not dumb it's genius
You look like Jacksepticeye but if he was a Norwegian and a female
You: *rips and tears book covers off* Me: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Congrats, you obliterated several forests for a 12,000 page book that somehow made it into my recommendations. But it’s cool though, the wildfires were gonna get those trees anyways!
By far my favorite book series, amazing to see it made into one giant book! Keep up the cool stuff!
“Every time I see this it just gets 💣dumber💣” is phase 2 of every project for me 😂  I love watching both your videos you are 100% expert at and videos like this where you’re just trying to figure it out.  It helps because then I can see the steps for finding a solution!!
Is that an ultra widescreen laptop
And now: _Frank Herbert's_ *DUNE.* 😊
It is a _Book Slinky._   It is a _Blinky._ 😊
_"That's not long enough._ (That's what she...)"   🤭🤭🤭
Paint so the pages mach
this is the craziest funniest weirdest thing ive ever seen... its hillarious. what is IN your mind:? lol
yes
17:24 😅
This book is so big you worked so hard this is amazing❤❤❤
i wish i wouldve watched this when it first dropped cause i missed the merch drop and now i doubt ill ever get the hoodie and sweats. i saw those and they immediately became my new favorite clothes like i need those i will be scouring ebay for the next few months in hopes of finding them unless by chance they come back in the store
Pov: test sheet paper🗿
There is no way that I just went that entire video without realising that you were missing a finger. I have to say that you’re fake finger is damn cool though
amazing. now do the entire warriorcats series next. :3
10/10 Content Bro
Bro, something you have that I don’t  .  .  .  Patience
Im I the only one who noticed that she has quran??
U just got another sub with the design
this is the most increadabe book I've ever seen!!
How much did this cost you to make?
I wonder how it wouldve looked if it went from like brand new to heavily worn because i keep thinking of the name wheel of time and how it would possibly fit
i just love it
I like your Nuka Cola fridge
When I was a kid, and I'd watch some dumb comedy movie w/ my father, he'd sometimes say, "It's so stupid, it's funny."  In the case of your creation, it was so dumb, your solutions were genius!
Please restock hoodies 🙏
You should have done a buckle strap that covered the pages to protect them instead of a single belt strap.
Now do it with the braille version
I'd be terrified of binding them out of order omg
17:18 ‘Breath on it and it goes ÆUGHAHHEÆÆEEAAHHÆGHHÆÆ’ 😂😂😂
15:06 CAN SOMEONE PLS TELL ME THE NAME OF THE MUSIC????!!
You should’ve sent this to the person who made that they will be like. Where is my fucking book? Why does it say what is this? What the
"HOlY BAhiyaYI AyiH" MADE ME ROLLL ON THE FLOOR 😂😂and also new sub required ❤
As someone who does leather (I actually started because of this channel), you can mix multiple dyes together in a separate cup to get a color in the middle. You can also add just isopropyl alcohol to make it lighter. Also, alcohol markers work really well on leather if you are doing smaller sections/items. There's a good chance Martina already figured this out, but I thought I would share what I have learned.   Also leather paint is basically just watered down acrylic paint.
Would just like to say after watching your awesome booking binding, we started watching the Wheel of Time on Amazon and we think that’s awesome.  Books to follow eventually…   Awesome! 👍🏻😁🍀
This is one of those books you take out of the box, blow off the dust and read it to your grandkids and say: "Ah my child, it has been long ago since I have dwelled in the history of ages, The Wheel of Time. Now the time has come to pass on the secrets to the next generation. It is tradition to read it on to the next bearer of the Wheel, so let us begin the ritual passage."
the cover and title look interesting maybe i should try the series (right when im looking for a new series to read😁)
you did a phenomenal job on the staining and carving
There's this saying if it works it works 3:32
Somebody give me the name of background music.
Brandon Sanderson to publisher: “So, I found someone to assemble the entire cosmere in one volume when I’m finished. It WILL be ‘The Book of Endless Pages’.
Why do all the YouTubers I watch know each other?
Please my address is 1775 give it to me please
i was tired of having a social life. time to crack the books again
Fun fact about the Authour  He served in Vietnam as a helicopter gunner, and according to him, he once accidentally shot an RPG out the air (he was already firing, and someone nearby took a shot at his heli). Once again this is according to him, on his blog, so it could be unreliable or exaggerated.
This was so cool to watch. Great job!
I tried reading the wheel of time twice. Both times I got to somewhere between book 7 or 8 and it kind of fizzled out for me. Maybe this version is the answer of getting through it 😂
You missed this warning: Don't fucking try this at home! ... as probably a lot of people would love to have this absurdly unplactical beautiful piece. At the beginning, it was quite painful to see you cut the covers, and I had that uncomfortable feeling of "It won't end well"... but it did. And is amazing! You had a rough time, and it's well reflected in the videos as we can see the time spent, the mate helping with the carving or the need of using the wristband. But yo finally did it! Congratulations! ... and of course i'll love to keep seing your videos ^^
Tell us when your done reading it!😊
Can you tell us what books you used?
So many noisees
I feel like you need to do a project with actual slinkies now 😂
Now do the Earthsea Cycle and send it to me? 😬 Haha
Where's New Spring 👀 lol jk  Martina, one of the most well-rounded and talented crafters ever: "I'm gonna do something dumb"  *Dumb thing is absolutely epic
This is just the average Sanderson  book
7:27 she said "ой" in Russian
2:11 - "This might be very, very smart, or very, very, very, very, very dum." Every creative, on any creative endeavour. Ever.
Maybe KOTLC? I think that would be fun :D (Keeper of the lost cities by Shannon messenger)
Is wheel of time show good or bad???  Pls suggest me few fantasy shows
u r so talented!
You're so talented! Is there something you can't do lol
How did you get this idea?!?
Martina the book slayer who drives fear in all librarians and professional book binders
Fine I will go read the Wheel of Time series for the first time, how long can 12,000 pages be? First book in Audiobook form is 30 hours long. Well got to be done.
That must’ve taken so long, but it looks so sick
Don’t know why but I kinda want to do this to the mercy Thompson series by Patricia Briggs, only the series isn’t done 😅😅😅 maybe just three books at a time😂
would u recomend this book series? just finished dune and looking for a new series to get into
I want an all in one book for one piece once it’s finished printing, but that will be very challenging
You have more patience than I will ever have.
I want it
5:40 u take the collection and stack up to the page u need😂
Sad that I have twice gone to your merch shop and the items I wanted were sold out.  I would LOVE the sketch book set but it's not available.  First two times trying to support and buy from my most favorite artistic/creative channel on youtube and I can't get the items.  :(
You probably won't see this, but if you do, you should absolutely read Wings Of Fire. It's an amazing book series about a species of dragon with several different subspecies on an adventure to save the world from at least two villans an ark with a magic system that will slowly corrupt your soul turning you evil
This ain’t a box set. This is a frickin packing crate set. And that’s beautiful.
it looks like a super huge spell book xD
You are my kind of crazy!  I always say "I just want to peek at the video to see the amazing result" ... but I can't look away. A testament to you, your videographer, and your editor - they only add to the experience and deserve a lot of credit.  BTW the fact that a beautiful box that would be a whole project video on any other channel is just a 5 second afterthought here is a statement itself!  PS you did include an index, right? :)
OH MY GOD!!!! FALLOUT KITCHEN!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHH! I NEED THIS! I NEED THIS TOOOOOOOOO!
Who else wants to see this with the whole Harry Potter series??  👇🏻
not a book slinky, a blinky
This is cool
Fuuuuu
17:24 Martina turned into Hellspawn Elmo
Soooooo, how much?
friendly reminder that your store is in need of a restock, cause that hoodie and joggers are amazing!
“Its the wheel of time!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @DanielGreene
Now I want to see Sandersons reaction to this book.
Hello Im new to this channel and this was a very good Welcome 😂😂😂😂
My favourite book series this is amazing
and plush
Beautiful merch i love it
What’s the name of this series?
0:42 MatPat?
MatPat?
that's such a funny video, i love dumb stuff like this. and the question is not, why should you do this, the question is: why not.
As amazing as this turns out in the end, I personally preferred how it looked before staining.
My teacher told me i could only read and present one book for my end of the year book presentation because she knows that i read so many books that she only wants me to do one maybe i should do something like this it just might be creative enough that she would allow it
If I'd had the opportunity to apprentice under someone, even for about a year, just to learn beautiful crafts like this, I'm sure I would've done it. But we didn't know anyone like this. Nobody I knew knew anyone like y'all. If you were a nerd or a creator, you kept it to yourself. Leatherworking, bookbinding--we have machines for that now; such trades are as good as obsolete. Those who do them "weren't good enough" for a "real" education (i.e., university degree). But it's all classist propaganda, & I'm stuck making my mistakes, watching YouTube to learn how to make things that make me & others like me happy. I love this. I want to bind books. I learned so much from just this one video. Thanks a ton. Keep up the good work.
In the US, we call that ratchet strap contraption Redneck Engineering
Could the threaded edging be done on a rebound book that isn’t using leather? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I’ve never rebounded a book before but my divergent series has seen better days and I love the idea of making her one big book lol
Longus Bookus is quite spookus
caught in a bind?
The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills
Super awesome!❤❤❤❤❤
Are you a Christian
At du orket å gjøre alt dette er helt utrolig, men jeg digger slutt resultatet
Majestic
I want this as a sektchbook
I love it. It was a great idea. And I seriously wachted it for more than 3 times. Do you read minds, I was searching this challenge everywhere 😅
OK… Thought this was interesting until I found out it was that it was the wheel of time series. Polygamy is gross.  Gender does not decide whether you like cats or dogs better that is stupid.  The Icedi are all control freaks, selfish, arrogant, and bitchy. The female leads are all pushovers with weird hangups.  The male lead is a dumpster fire.  The only interesting person in the entire book is his best friend, but the guy is a promiscuous jerk.
I like to imagine that if a nuclear apocalypse happened, this book would survive and think it's actual human history or some sacred text.
That's a lotta Falken-Gold!
I love this because Robert Jordan’s original plan for the last 3 books was to have it as one giant book. This is awesome
Imagine going through all this effort, and then realizing you put the books in the wrong order
This is actually a cool as heck idea! Like kinda impractical for reading it but it makes an awesome house piece as a functional decoration! I can think of an adjustable device table that would make reading this comfortably possibly though.
Damn how can one person be so skilled at so many different types of things at the same time :0 truly astonishing and a sight to behold
Wouldn't it be smarter if she aligned the front instead of the spine so she could shim the out of alignment spines?
I really want the hoodie and joggers, sadly they are sold out
You've written history (maybe this is the first book(series of books))
Reminds me of that SpongeBob episode 😂
Awesome 😀
imagine making this of a series and then sending it to the author XD
Medieval scribes are quaking rn
FUN FACT!!!! MY MOTHER GOT MY NAME FROM BOOK 3, THE CHARACTER AVIENDHA AND SHE NAMED ME AFTER HER AND LEARNING HOW BADASS AND SO MUCH IM LIKE HER IM PROUD TO BE NAMMED AFTER HER
My teacher be like "if your book is over 400 pg. You can do the talk next we" me "my book is 12,000😢"
5:26  y’all ok?
Half way through the video and I was hoping I was the youtuber.....I dont have a channel but I really wanted that book in my collection lmao😂
hey the wheel of time is also a show on Amazon and i love it
P: koob tnaig taht htiw gninrezl rof emit fo em sdnimer ti yppah em sekam sihT /\  I  I  I (Backwards...)
I fear to think what Nerdforge and Frenchiefries would do if they ever thinkof doing a collab💀💀
Do you take commissions?
thank you so much for this video! it was great but after it i started reading the eye of the world and i’m almost done it now and it is soooo amazing!! i can already tell that it’s going to be one of my favourite series!
Wow and WTF THATS INSANEEEEEE .....LY COOOLLL😂😂😂😂😂
Found this channel while finishing my reread of WoT, and Androl immediately came to mind. Now I'm watching this video and I feel like WoT follows me anywhere I go.
-"do you have something to read on the road trip, make sure it's long, we're going to be driving for a few hours."  -"I know the exact book."
Vegtible tanned means it was tanned by hand by humanoid vegetables.
this is indeed, incredibly dumb you should have just made it into its own backpack, double down on the dumbness regardless i approve of this idiocy. time well wasted.
I am actually trying this (with a much MUCH smaller series of books) so thank you for the sorta tutorial
Please collab with Xyla. :)
Weird and potentially niche ask, but could you try making the Libris Fabula from the Librarians series? 😮 It's one of my favorite episodes and it'd be really cool to see you make a recreation of the book!!
I’ve never seen something so impractical be so necessary.
Well now I know what I’m reading after Lord of the Rings and Eragon
That book better come with its own personal chiropractor, because that spine is _fucked_
Tolkien wanted The Lord of the Rings to be a single book but the publisher refused. That wouldn’t have been a tenth of the size of this monstrosity. What you have here is not a book, it’s a definitive TOME!
The meaning of dedication, I want to do this so badddd!  This is how I want my book shelves to look, the complete series together and it would look so pretty I you did this for ever book series you have!
DU MÅ VÆRE NORSK, INGEN ENGELSKMEN SIER SKJERABAGERA
It hurts me seeing you violate my favourite series like that but I respect the hustle
I have seen several of your videos and I must say that you are the most talented person I have seen in recent times, it is to be admired. I love what you make, whether it's a huge (beautifully impractical) book, a robot or even a functional finger! new subscriber of course!
Innt the dragon supposed to be gold?
What was that background music? It was insanely hype.
I love this project so much but there is another book series that involves dragons. It's called wings of fire and it's my favorite book series ever but I have not finished it but I would love to see you make it. Love the content you make!😁
Curious, how heavy is it?
I'll buy that for a million bugs really.
I love how like you do not complain all the time like other YouTubers!
19:56
I think it’s Rick Ashly
It gives a whole new meaning to the term a little light reading...
Now do this with Terry Pratchett’s discworld.
This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen
What bibliophile hasn't wondered at some point how thick of a book you can make? Now we know it's at least 12,000 pages.   That book is completely ridiculous AND totally awesome.
where can we buy one?
Timmy: Are there any rules? Jorgan Von Strangle:
Hey Nerdforge, I really admire your work and the passion you put into your creations. Here's a request from my end, could you make a diary for me? The Doctor Who River Song TARDIS Diary to be precise. I am a big Doctor Who fan and I've wanted that diary for so long. It's alright if you don't receive my request, I still am a big admirer of your work. Best wishes!
Do you know which way the chapters are 😂😂😂😊❤❤     LOVE Y'ALL VIDEOS❤❤❤
Please do True Blood books
Two words : book acordian
I love the cover!!!
If you were to make this again (for some reason haha) I would have thrown the "book" into a table saw to square all the pages together. Still, amazing work as always
Forever
Can you please do the same thing, but with diary of a wimpy kid and then give it off to the most favorite subscriber I’ve watched every single video plus I love diary of a Wimpy kid and your videos which makes it if you give this to me I’m being a follower
legitimately the craziest thing i've seen this year
I feel like this should be called Oppenhaimer.  Because you can do a thing doesn't mean u should
Imagine if it had been released as a trilogy as RJ originally intended.   Looks great! Perfect for the best book series of all time.
This has been glorious insanity.  Thank you, so much.  I used to do digital book re-creations for The British Library and others, and this has made me such a happy, happy nerd.
Is the boy Brazilian?
this hurts so much 😭😭 also paperback would be easier I think
Any way you could get a version of the cryptic hoodie that is not cropped in the store? A regular style hoodie that looks like this would be FIRE.
Had to pause a moment when you said "that's what she said" right as I did. Masterfully done
"Understanding women, short guide" xd
Imagine dropping this on your pinkie finger 😢
Випадково відкрив відео, бо подумав, що це Поліна з каналу "Хочу гратися", якщо ви теж, тицяйте вподобайку.
You should make a fantasy tome by combining the rule books for Dungeons and Dragons.
Wow, you really made a literal bookworm...
This is solo wholesome 😊
Beautiful work 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
the last book in that series was written by my favorite author of all time, Brandon Sanderson. Im really sad to see you not include his name on the cover.
Well, this just made me  1. Subscribe 2. Add this series to my reading list
When she said 14 book series, I knew...
I Love it…!!
I can’t believe that you actually took the time to do that!!!!
Intricate designs…
I was to late for za hoodie 😢
ah se tomo un trabajito hermoso en plasmar el diseño
Is that a Norwegian accent I hear? 🧐 very cool video, but also, VERY COOL library!! Is that your apartment?!?!?!?
Average Brandon Sanderson short story collection and now just imagine what the complete Stormlight Archives Book 1-10 binded would look like!
Nice neat travel book
How come she lives in a magical fantasy elven tree forest house dafuq it's purrfect am jelli
Бляха, а я подумав що то Поліна і дрочилки😂
Do Throne of Glass series?
You need some sort special teeter-totter table device for that book to be able to read from start to finish lol 😂
as an artist, i can't even IMAGINE going through all of this rigorous work, getting such a beautiful end product, and then not even keeping it
19:11 meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Oh now I'd love to see you make a leather map using leather stain as paint as you did here !!!
Holy fk, i gonna put it in my DnD campaign
Ok, so this is the first video I've watched on this channel, and I have to say the cutting with the music, and the whole theme fits so well. Especially the music. I love it. Keep up the work. PS: I love your hairstyle  <3
And I thought House of Flame and Shadow was a heavy chonk of a book. Sheesh! 😆 This is incredible!
2 questions why and who the hell are you i lke your vidios (last part wasnt a question btw)
Imagine some future archeologist finding this😂
Okay hear me out. Double that and give it to the next YouTuber
It's incredible how creativity and being able to make things with your own hands is so attractive.
Aligning on spine? Rookies... =)
If wattpad and ao3  fanfictions were written on paper:
I have 2 questions. 1st) did you at least buy copies? And 2) why don't you just carve before you put it on the book? That way, there is no possibility of water accidently running onto the book.
i dont usually take time to comment on videos but this is just so good i had to say keep up the great work bc your art is amazing
first video of this type that im watching, can anyone with more experience than myself explain why just trimming down the edges to make all the books the same size wasn't an option? it looks like only about a millimetre difference at most
This isn't a leatherbound book, it's a leatherbound WEAPON OF MASS CONCUSSION.
What book is this??
u shudve sent that to the author
YOU ARE SO HARDWORKING but boy this is so usless
Love the hoodie and joggers! Would you sell male version your outfit please 🙏
I would love displates such a cool product the only wall they don’t recommend putting it on is textured wall guess what my entire room is made of 😢
Mom: You can only bring one book on the trip. Me:
Чёт я не пойму, такое ощущение, что у неё русский акцент...
ngl id read that
Watching this channel should be mandatory in schools
So creative and inspiring. Huge value in this channel. The energy is so good, and the editing is next level
Is this absolutely insanely dumb, funny and just shouldnt exist? Yes. Do I want one? YES!
Sou seu São Jorge, e; à, pra mim tá bom.
Why you don't say we made
"Cut huge square of linen" cuts a rectangle. -_-"
I was expecting an ad for coffee..
Nice! A great book to read in your bed at night
The wheel weaves as the wheel book binds?
That is crazy fun!
Waaaooowww 😮😍
Tbh seeing her cut the books at the start physically hurt me and mentally I might need a therapy session 😂
No way are you reading that book in bed 😂
This is what Robert Jordan wanted! I've heard him cited on something like: "I want the last book to be so large that you'd need a wheelbarrow to get it home from the store."  If anyone can find the quote it'd be great.
If you haven’t read Malazan yet, you need to.
I think my favorite thing about it is it's so freaking beautiful even i want it (never read wheel of time) and the freaking pages don't even match
Maybe you could make a set of platforms that move vertically and support the book while reading it? 🤔
I’m getting a real “I’m going to do this purely because I can” vibe from this channel (from the videos I’ve watched so far).
What book do you want ? Yes😅
You are really crazy.
your carving skills…
You made your own horcrux! :P
Simplemente increíble, me volaste la cabezaaaa !
It really never gets old, every time you set up the book as two legs / slinky I laughed out loud :D Also I once again want to point out that I love all the little details that go into the production of Nerdforge videos... I burst out laughing at the 56k modem connection sound with Martina thinking :D all the sounds and little graphics layered over the video add so much to the quality.100% premium content.
Paint the edges please. ❤
Im new i already seen all her videos and i am like WTF What those this girl doesnt do
12:45 Was riveting to watch.
people from 3040 thinking like we were wearing these
At this point that's not even a book, it's a someone's whole life
The only, only thing that would have made this better is planing/sanding down the paper to an even base and putting a gold edge on all that paper.
I was going down a rabbit hole of smaller youtubers learning book binding and then... I got recommended this monstrosity.  I'm not complaining, mind you.
I'm planning on learning bookbinding too
Martina out here being nerd fairy godmother to other youtubers! This was a hilarious masterpiece! I think Robert Jordan would be chuffed and Sanderson probably is jealous! lol
Hey, Martina, I heard there will be one more book in the series. ;)
22:50 what LOOK AT THE SUBCRIBE BUTTON AT THAT TIME
This is how I saw an 800 page book when I was in elementary school
What book series is this? Please tell me I need to know
I need my HP set as one like this 😻 amazing
Awesome such very special Artwork 👌Thank you so much for sharing your Artwork 🙏🏼❤️
i really enjoyed the video. Do you do commissions by chance? I have been searching for a single bound volume of Stephen Kings Dark Tower
OOOOOOHHHHH!!!  This just made my day!  I have my own story relating to the Wheel of Time series (aka the Wheel of Pain!). This...  this is just PRICELESS!!!  Thanks so much for sharing your creative madness.  Now I have a few extra paperbacks of these book...  I think I might just try that for myself...  🤣
ive never been more amazed and amused in my life
you ruined the stroke🤣
As you were making it, I thought about Daniel and how much he would love it. I loved that he was able to get it!
Why does she kinda look like female jacksepticeye
This is so cursed, i love it.
with the raw carved leather it already looked insane! but the paint added so much more dimension, this looks amazing!!
5:52 he’s cute 6:01
1:23 martina: “book press, wasn’t big enough” Also Martina: “but still works as a book press” Me: *_Bestem deg!_*
How much does it weigh
Random person: "Oh cool is that like a custom box for allthe books?" Her: no. It is the books
why not just make a master leather sstrap and make little leather covers to connect to it, then add designs
I knew there was a reason why I came across your channel!  I can't even tell you how much I connect with this series.  I only recently, I mean in the last couple weeks, acquired the majority of the series, I'm miss8ng two.  Six of them are the hard cover, the other six, paperback.  Maybe you can help me with this, one of the paperbacks, the spine has broken, causing a page or two to come out. How would I fix it?
the only thing that could have made this even better, tho idk hiw practical or even possible that is to do on a book this size since it requires a ton of pressure on the pages, wouldve been to sand the sides down so that all the pages blend together format size wise. but again, not sure if thats even possible here, ive seen it done on smaller books when gilding the sides of pages but maybe applying that sorta force on that amount of paper would just be virtually impossible without like a hydrolic press idk
0:01 “What is happening?”      In Norwegian

That’s what sh-
when will the hoodie and joggers be back in stock?
You amaze me every time - every single time!
This is the Mother of ALL boxsets! ❤ Seriously THE BEST THING I have ever seen! 😍😍😍 The final result and the box is MAGNIFICENT!
5:29 if AI made a "witch reading big magical book" haha
Could you do a vegan/vegetarian version sometime in the future? (Not here to put me on a pedestal, judge you or anything, I would just love to try something like this and I guess an expert knows the differences better/ can react to difficulties faster)
This is awesome! ❤
Ok.  New favorite slogan that -really- needs to be on a T-shirt!  "Stupid projects need stupid solutions."  ... With an image of a giant stack of book pages held together by boards and ratchet straps, but bent just a little cockeyed.
I don't even want to contemplate how much shipping was o.O
can't believe you did what Robert Jordan intended to do for the final book, thank you for proving that mad man right
17:23 Please, never change
This so awesome
Try it with all One Piece Volumes Impossible😂
Please make more hoodies and joggers! I want to buy that set, it is so beautiful! You never cease to amazing me with your work
We love you nerdforge
Honestly it's really funny how the Wheel of Time books take up an entire area of bookshelf in my house  Also the audio books combined last 19 days
I like it but i do think it needed the white pages to be stained to look more old
Hello! Long time Leather artist watching! If you use a Stylus (Ball point stick) and wet leather, you can avoid getting lead on the leather. It makes it cleaner (May tire your hand out a bit) but doing so has helped me win a few awards in Leather Craft
The Wheel of Time is hands down my favourite series, and you did a perfect job on this! It turned out so good, so detailed! Always in awe of your projects
Before putting the leather on, you could have clamped it between 2 boards and sanded all the books to a more uniform size. Still a great outcome though
I am far from being a regular in this community, but as a newcomer I truly respect the job that you have done on this projet, impossible to stay impassive watching this video, truly a work of art
Women ☕ ☕ 😂😂
How much did this sell for?
Imagine you do all that and then you realize you glued the books in the wrong order 💀
Roligt att se produktplacering för Biltema! 😁
You are a genius.
what an awesome project, amazing!!!
Bruh, that's not a book. Thats a  BOOOOOK! LOL. (Fr tho, this is awsome.)
Imagine accidentally putting one book out of order
Less she-males, more real women.
Daniel better thank her everyday! So jealous
The worst she can say is NO 1:15
Dammit I’m too late to get that dope ass hoodie
Greek mythology be like:
now do all volumes of One Piece (maybe when it finishes, would be dumb to make an incomplete one now)
I would watch the whole uncut video of this
I knew it was the wheel of time from the thumbnail
This is the most incredible thing i ever saw in my life, congratulations
you made the book from spongebob's grandma irl
u spoiled the lucky youtuber with the pinned comment😅 dope vid
The wheel of time has always been my favorite long form fantasy story. I've read and re-read that series many times over the years and i've always wondered what it would look like as a single book. Fucking awesome.
I need to know what the middle page was like.... bad.
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! I just subscribed... Keep creating!
Next step, Robin Hobb's, Ring of the Elderlings cycle. Mine is 4 mm thick, but you can buy the books. For the alignment problem, my grandfather had a 2 ton cutting press. And he would take the katerns, out of the books, and saw them into the whole book. Then he would marmorise paper for the first and last page. Create a leather front and back cover, inlaid with goldleaf indeed. Reflecting the book. Turned these onto a work of art. It's a profession. And a dying art. He died 41 years ago, but he would have loved to have seen this. I guess your blacklisted by DHL by now.
So many OG hardcovers destroyed:( a full paperback set would have the same page size
Me wants, Me needs, Me would sells my 5 unborn childrenses to possesses. mmmmyyyyy  pppreeecccccisssussssuuuusss.(done in my best Gollum voice)
Absolutely incredible !🪐🌬🌟👏
“I have it and you don’t Sanderson” is one of my all time new favourite quotes
12:07 wait, thats not you... its just a theory, but I think she had someone else make that part, actually its kinda obvius
I still don't understand why Jordan decided that The Dragon wasn't actually a dragon, and that dragon's were never really a thing at all in the series (Idk if the Rakkan were supposed to be dragons or not, but they were never once referred to as dragons... sooo....).
"12,000 page bookbinding" *Brandon Sanderson has entered the chat*
its so dumb but i love it!! now i want to do something like that with my favorite book series
That's so cool it just made me want to read those books 📚
I lnew that I liked your videos for a reason!
Just want you to know, having the supplies and time to do dumb shit like this is my dream
Thanks to this video, The Wheel of Time is now on my TBR 👀
One other comment made me think about - how it would be to make Wheel of Time book in "wheel" - like bended in circle?
How much will you sell this for
Esse vídeo tem uma vibe tv cultura
Can u do this but with the Harry Potter books??
Would look good in a library room as decoration.
I think the most impressive thing about this project is that it survived being shipped overseas without any packing material
the maps🥲
Do The Legend of Drizzt
The music in the background is just so nice and calming, WHAT ARE THOSE SONGS CALLED?? Pls someone I need that type of music in my playlist
I spent the whole video enthralled so much by the project and the techniques that I didn't even notice her set. What the hell?!? The jealous awe of what has been made here is off the charts.
Fll in lov
Teacher making my homework:
I have this omnibus book on my Kindle already.
You would definitely have been a faculty member at The School of Cairhien.   Also WoT goblin xover episode!
The sheer volume of this series is the reason why I am optimg to read a digital copy of it, I don't have enough room in my bookcase for that number of chonky books xD
NO NOOOO NOOOOOOOOO ITS WHEEL OF TIME NOOOOOOOOOOOO. I know it's good stuff, it just hurts my soul with how many books there are :P
Anlegemilch?? thats funny
This is BEYOND STUNNING! Never seen anything like it. I wonder how much it costs him to buy this masterpiece!
Its nothing compare to book title "how to understand woman for dummies"
The time, effort, dedication and attention to detail is astonishing. Bravo.
Parece o livro que o professor Koro fez no anime Assasination classroom de tao grande que e que ate falam no anime que parece um dicionário 🤣🤣
I nearly asked about the hoodie.  I guess I'll just buy.
A book too intimidating to ever open, despite how much humor you will produce purely through the act of reading it ... Tough
You should do this with Stormlight when the fifth one comes out!
She should write a book on how do the stuff that she does and make a video of her making the book fancy
So awesome
wouldnt it be funny if you accidentally switched the order of the books lmao
It'll make sense if you don't want to do it ever again, but if you can make a harry potter collection it will be breathtaking. Love your videos ❤
Oh my god I hope the author sees this!
Would you take a commission just like this but for a different book series?
The way i tensed up watching you cut those books up at the beginning
My brother absolutely adores the Wheel of Time series! I only just borrowed the first book from him and already love it. The writing style reminds me almost of Toilken, but it is much easier to really absorb yourself into. I am definitely sending this video to him. I am sure he would be jealous of your monstrous yet glorious creation.
The book should have come with a mini car jack so that you can raise and lower each cover as needed
My husband watching in the background "its literally a rectangle of time"
I've been thinking of doing something like this with the Animorphs series, but I doubt the original cheap paper is sturdy enough to handle it lol I was thinking of doing a few 600ish-page volumes, but now I think I have to give this a try.
I think my filmmaking class brought up the Wheel of Time when someone who was visiting to lecture brought up how the director of the series screwed up the aesthetics of the Wheel itself, completely disregarding the people's wishes whom they had bought the rights from to make the series.  I wish Robert could have seen this bookbind. I'm sure he would have loved it!
You could have sanded the books to make them flush, if you do a project like this again in the future, you should give it a try!
What a beautiful monstrosity
Great for if you want to workout and read at the same time
I can't imagine how much it weighs and how much it cost to post, haha. I do love the book slinky, though.
Imagine one of the books were put in upside down.
Math homework:
I’ve seen ebooks where it has the whole series in one file, but this is the real life version 😮
you should do this for one pice when it ends
my fav part of this is DEFINETLY the laugh you guys did when saw the bend for the first  time its so amazing
Okay I legit started having a deep emotional reaction when you started carving the leather design. This book series means A LOT to me as it was the series that reignited my love of reading in high school when Literature classes and book analysis papers had really spoiled the JOY of reading for me. The love you are show for this project just hits me RIGHT in the feels.
I've been staring at this in Daniel's videos for a while now, but I had no idea you made it! This is NUTS! It looks SO freakin' good, and seeing all the work you put into it, WOW!
Witchcraft
wow. really amazing
Ridiculous. I love it
I think this needs to be done for the Harry Potter books 😀
Could you please go to a library and record people's reactions when they see you reading it?
Hey, any idea involving ratchet straps is not a dumb idea. 99.99% of the time, it's a solution
This creation will be studied by the future mankind or aliens just as we wonder about how the Great Pyramids were actually made.  But then again, I cannot help but picture a small car with King sized mattress strapped to its roof driving down the highway for some reason.
This looks like a grimoire a extremely chaotic wizard would have.   An elemental magic guide but instead of earth wind water and fire it’s all the elements on the periodic table.
Try the anita Blake vampire hunter series. It just gut to book. 30 in 30 years
This is the first video I ever saw of yours. This was INSANE and AWESOME!! But I must say your background!!! 😍😍😍 I LOVE that nook!!
No words!! Except that I want one!
bro I just found your channel from this and was like omg I lover her outfit and your like NEW MERRCHHHH and I was STFU👁👄👁✋️ SO COOL
girl you ATE that
i knew it was going to be Green. this is amazing
That's the book SpongeBob's granny gives when u're adult.
That has to be one of the most stunningly beautiful, over the top by a mile, stupid projects ever ... and I LOVE it!
Ratchet straps are exactly what I would have used.  Useful hint: it would have been easier had you laid it on it's side to strap it.  You are nuts and I love it!  As soon as I saw the thumbnail, I also thought "slinky". Great minds.  I absolutely love that you sewed the binding. That belt idea is perfect. You had me cracking up the whole time.  I'm really, really impressed at your skills in, well, just about everything. I love your creativity, your authenticity, your spirit ... what the hell, you're just a total JOY!
Martina, Hansi, I have to tell you this, with all the never ending love I have for the both of you : this is the stupidest thing I ever saw AND I FUCKING LOVE IT !!!! You guys are chaotic geniuses !!!!
7:34 The is the part where something scary happens
Me watching how she destroyed this nice books just to do that when books in my country are the price of a kidney 😩 (no hate thou i just felt really bad watching books in good state getting broken)
I can’t stop watching this because this is insane. I can’t believe that you did this monstrosity. But this is satisfying to see.
Don't get me wrong; this is the best thing ever made but as a book binder myself.... (whispers o so softly.... those books reaaaahhheaaaaly needed to be cut to the same size first - or as close as. I so would have jumped into a cab to find the nearest Polar first. That would have been chef's kiss). But really great enterprise lady!
The amount of homework Kumon gives me while summer break in one video,
WOW, Such an incredible artist!
I have so many things running through my brain...   Me :   *being satisfied when the head of the stick man I draw is round* Martina :   *nails it as every project she has done, making me exhauted of my non existing talent* Me :  - One book for the whole serie, what a smart idea! Martina :  - This is the dumbest thing I've ever made! Me :  - Wait... what? 🫠🤣
You fit so much my crazyness, I would love to be your friend 😂 By the way I'm having so much fun watching your videos and it's satisfying to watch, great video as usual 🙃
its like that book spongebob has in the Grandmas cookies episode
"You are allowed to bring one book onto the flight..." Martina: "hold my tea" *plonk* "it is one book"....
You just did what I have fantasized about doing for months now, thank you!
I just hope that you put the books in the correct order
Not me thinking the whole time, "wow Daniel loves Wheel of Time. He would love something like this"
Pls do the same just with the spooks book series by Joseph Delaney bc I is my fave books ever and it has 20 books ❤
Kindle imo
I would love to see the author's reaction to this, too.
Codex gigas 2 wheel of time
Now this brings up the question, "How big would the book have to be for it to be a regular shaped book?"
Oh my gosh! Amazing! You are in the same ballpark of creative genius as the famous Chocolate guy. Love your work, thanks!
its like if jk rowling wrote an entire harry potter book, but each summer is just transitioning into what is the next book series
BRB I’m gonna go buy the first book in this series now😂
almost enough for the malazan book of the fallen
You should do Harry Potter as one book as well I think it would look badass
Mr. Rigney would be proud.
This was awesome. I was really hoping it was Daniel Greene you were sending it to, too 😁
I like BIG BOOKS, and I cannot lie. All you other mf's can't deny. (haha)
Glorious!
Awwww it's wheel of time ❤
Wow, I've never seen someone bind a congress bill.
I wanna do this for the entire Assassination Classroom series cause the people in charge of printing the manga missed out on an opportunity to nod to the series cause Koro-sensei makes accordion-like guide books in the story. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT so now I have to buy $200 of manga AGAIN to make this thing 😭
Imagine gluing one book upside down from the rest
OMG. That is SO FREAKING AWESOME. I am already wet, despite I'm a man.
I will pay between $3,000-5,000 for exactly this but its all the game of thrones books
Would this fall under the category of "a bit of light reading" for Hermione Granger?
Good lord how does that even work. I get hard cover comics from the library and pages are already coming out of the bind
23:37 face when you pretend when you read 😄
"I send you some glue or something... "  fully knowing she would completely restore that as her sanity won't allow it to be destroyed.
Since this book is one big circle, I would love to see the book on a Rolodex system where you could constantly read through the stories and they go back to the beginning.
:D :D :D :D :D   This was phenomenal.   :D  :D  :D
That fridge thought!!! 😮😮😮
I'm wondering if you actually put those in the right order.
THAT is AAAAWWWEEESOME! ❤ That's one LUCKY person getting that gorgeous gift!
I have the perfect title... "Understanding Women, Volume 1 Pocket Edition."
Artistic leatherwork may be one of the great lost arts
Ok i haveone question... Are all the booksin order???
Oh yeah, I did see that Brandon Sanderson just finished writing the 5th Stormlight achieve book. You must be helping them with it's binding
You should make a leather bound books for order
Bonito, mas inutilizável!
22:15
👌👌👌
She has such a great personality AND she’s smart?!😮 AMAZING
20:06
I have no idea why this was in my recommendations considering it couldn't be further away from my usual content. But I loved it anyway. Idk how but the algorithm knows me better than I do.. Terrifying.
3:15 please please someone tell me the name of this song!!!! i heard its cobblestone village but its the same melody but not the same instruments!!!  Please Please somone tell me this!
This is a huge progress for Fantasy literature in general.  😑
The best part is that you can actually make a wheel with it.
I'm going to need this kind of cover for my lecture notes by the time I'm finished with my medical degree. "Medicine: The textbook". Imagine one could make a faux, preferably silicone miniature "anatomical pathologies" attached to the cover...
My mother: you’re only allowed to bring 1 book for the drive today, we don’t have enough room for your bag of books! Me: …1? Fine.
HAha!! 😂
We need to get you a job as a book cover artist. And I have an order for 2 "Luis Royo"-esque dragons from Displate coming to cover up an ugly thing in my wall. Too bad I'm too late for your discount code but the XMAS one still works.
Name of first book in series?
Imagine reading this in class
You are my absolute inspiration ⭐️
I hope you are going to do items  from The Fourth Wing
I got linked to this video from a Reddit post joking about making a Stormlight Archive omnibus like this when the serious ended. This is better than I could have imagined! Never saw your stuff before but you have a new fan. And seeing Daniel Greene as the surprise YouTuber this got sent to was an added bonus I wasn't expecting 😂
This is not a reading copy, this is a display copy.
It’s always so fun so to see some of your favorite creators and topics collide in the real world! I’ve not been on YouTube much recently, and so I didn’t see this until Daniel posted about it, and when he mentioned you guys made it for him, I like “WAIT BUT THEY’RE MY FAV FANTASY CRAFTING CHANNEL, YOU KNOW THEM TOO?” 😂 Of course in the world of fantasy inclined creators, the best would know the best! And I had no idea you guys were also WoT fans! Like Daniel said, this is a creation RJ himself would cherish. And I wish I could see Sanderson and Harriet’s reactions! Truly, WoT fans all across the world would spend an exorbitant amount of money to add this to their shelves (me included)! I cannot say enough how STUNNING this project turned out! Possibly my favorite project of yours ever!
Well that's cool!
wow
I came across your channel because I saw a meme of this book in a couple of WOT groups only to find that it is literally all 14 books 😂😂😂
need to make a book jack so you can read it easily
It needs a pair of pistons to be able to read it.
Imagine she switched two books on accident.
Wow.
I love your energy!! 😂❤
ive never heard of wheel of time but this dedication for a book series REALLY makes me want to check it out
Are you Norwegian?
Imagine one piece in one book
Stacy just chilling as a dark lord haha
Is this the new Harry Potter book
This is absolutely beautiful, especially for a book series like this.  It's a shame what Amazon has done with it so far D:
I honestly thought you were going to send it to Brandon Sanderson
Just beyond belief, the amount of work and time put into this is staggering.  Subbed.
Easy Like and Subscribe absolutely STUNNING work!! I've never read the Wheel of Time but I've watched the series and fell in love with it quickly. SO jealous of Daneil lmfaoooo but happy for him too! You are truly so talented! Oh and love the merch btw! That Cryptic set is fuckin killer
youre from germany? 16:08
this single-handedly convinced me to read wheel of time
A quote from Reptilicus seems to fit here "It's a piece of skin, like leather!"
this is how school reading books are made
Reminds me I once gave an artwork to a shop to sell and they could not bear to part with it. It emded up on display in the shop not for sale.
Now do Terry Pratchett's Discworld.
17:20 bro that AaaAaeAA caught me off guard😂😂
The book is a giant slinky!
Put this on your nigthstand for some "light reading".
It's missing a new spring!  Or did I just not see it?
highschool teacher: your assignment this winter break is to enjoy the holidays and read this one little book. :) the book in question:
how is it always sunny outside that window...
Damn, Emma Stone's little sister is dope.
Never heared of that Book Series... but now I will read it... so ty for that. :D
7:38 it's giving stranger things grandfather clock vibes
Your so talented and a joy to watch 🙂
Y'know if you bound the very first and last pages, skipping the covers all together, you could have yourself The Wheel of the Wheel of Time.
This is hilarious - I haven't laughed about a video this hard in a couple of months!
When i saw it's gonna be wheel of time, i was just like: dude daniel greene would be so jealous. And at the end i saw that it's literally sent to daniel greene :))))))))
This might qualify for worlds record of biggest book/ leather bound book, human size book, something like that
Some engineering youtuber should build a table stand that could support this book while a reader turned the pages,  adjusting height seamlessly.  Then the owner should totally read it!  What an incredible gift, this book!
Omg the Wheel of Time???? It took me years to read through the whole series, including most of highschool. 😅 That's amazing!!!
I swear I know this girl from real life.  She looks like 2 girls I personally know from my vet office.  She obv isn't because of the hair color and accent.
make the door look like a vault door, or just actually attach a vault door to it or some kind of door from the 80's or 60's even the white door just does not match
As a huge fan of the WOT book series, I would love to get this.
I don't read books, I don't like fantasy. But this as a project was amazing to see!
This is the most beautiful abomination I’ve ever seen!
I won’t lie there are SO MANY (Shorter) series that I wish that they would do these for
this is the Frankenstein of the books
That is gorgeous. I don't know whether to cry or busta gut laughing.
Carving 1mm leather is insane! Usually it's 2.5mm+ and even then it's hard to get a good result. Especially on goat, which is softer than cow.
You've outdone yourself again, Martina!  Amazing job!  Impractical, but definitely not dumb IMO!
When I bought leather dye it acted like paint. Just waited for it to dry. So either I got leather paint or some weird dye 🤣  Edit: it could have also been just weird on the leather I used.
Seeing how i leftvthe last video i was watching cuz it wasnt real gold im pleasently surprised that you did be wasteful XD
Martina made a kind of book-bridge!!! WHOEHAHAHA!!!! Love your vids sweetie&co XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXPinkie
I looked him up on youtobe right after whaching this video  and subscribed and of corse i already subscribed  to you just leting you know couse if i did not that would not be fair and plus i really like your video,s so yeah great video  bye
@lawandlumber @runkleofthebailey You're always saying "make something you'll feel better" 🤭
Book slinkey is such a cursed thought... but its absolutely accurate
I 100% thought this might be going to Sanderson but since it is not i think one of these will need to exist when Stormlight 5 comes out.
now forge a balance scale thing that can gradually lift one side and sink the other to read it :) amazing build
holy s***, thats a piece of art. :O
This is so stupid   I love it
Crazy idea 😂
it will always be a pleasure to watch you work, magnifique fun and full of techniques!!! well done to you 2
this is so stupid and i love it
music at 10:30?
This looks like something that might be found walking around in the magical section of Unseen University Library.
Definitely would do this, with the added evening the edges & painting them I already have a massive series in mind too
Why didn't you sand down the edges so they were even?
I never comment on videos but the amount of work put into this and the respect I feel you have for the books I have no choice but to do whatever could get you placed in the algorithm. This is a masterpiece, I haven’t even read the series but now I kinda want to
Omg its the book from the "grandma's kisses" ep of spongebob
Hi, How heavy is that book? As your going to need somebody who can lift it. From the book shelf to the table to read it. Stay safe to you two and your loved ones.
Still smaller than the average omnibus spending bill
R  you a boy or a. Girl😕🤔🙄
Now do the entirety of all the Rick riordian (all the Percy Jackson series and all those connected)
❤❤❤❤❤🎉👏
I'm still not halfway through this series...  I need to get on that
I had two cats and they fought a lot one was fine but the other was stressed so he just moved to my frends house but I still feel like I lost my best frend and this is helping a bit so thanks
This is... amazing, Martina (and I think I saw Hansi in there a bit, too).  Truly epic.  My only thought is that now it needs a bespoke reading stand, with two platforms attached on linear rails (or similar bearing structures) to a center column with a round top, and some aircraft cable (or other low-stretch "string"-like something) set at just the right length to keep the platforms always the right distance to support the two ends.  :)
THE FIRST DOG HAS THE SAME NAME AS ME
I'm in love with this ginormous book. It's like an Act of Congress, but enjoyable to read. It's a shame the box is a bit large, though.
That little "that's what she said" in the beginning killed me😂😂😂
Brandon Sanderson 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Genuine question... is veg tan, rather than meaning made of vegetables (ew), actually, more accurately; soaked in vegetable WATER?...
I absolutely love the wheel of time and have read it once and listened to it twice. Kate Reading and Micheal Kramer are truely special narrators
are you single? 🥺♥
A little light reading
now i want to see all 43 Discworld novels turned into one mighty tome worthy of Rincewind himself
omg you are amazing!!
It hurts seeing you rip the covers off…
2min in and I thought, why dont you create a large press block form you could ratchet them together. aligning the spine then shaving each side to line them up.
this was beautiful
I hope they sent this video to the author
Important thing to remember: Daniel Greene is an ideological victim and he is very open about his ideology. If you happen to disagree with him at some points, he will make sure to make you feel like a monster.  He also reviewed Shad Brooks' book, but then deleted this review recently. Theories are that, of course, it was out of ideological reasons – Shad is religious and conservative. That goes to show you that Greene has no spine – in his mind, only people who agree with him are worth a review and thus an exposure. He liked the book, yet decided that it should not be advertised out of his spite for the author.  That's the person you saw in this video.
I’m curious how you didnt think to re-cut all the book blocks to become the same size before gluing or after gluing! this is what printing press guillotines are used for and why thicc books have so much bleed (and printed contents don’t match much between different signatures). I did production on a bible that had 4-color graphics throughout and it needed a quarter inch bleed because the far edge varied in horizontally so much between the beginning/end of the bible and its middle.
Seeing you cut books up was too much pain, I couldn't get past the first victim.
I think a new hyperfixation has been acquired...
Automatic Subtitles are my new friends! In the ad-break: 'magic togethering' 'lord of drinks' I know you can't controll these, but I think they are art.
Make me think another level of  "We shall consult the arcane book of GAME RULES version 45 codex 3..." "Yes, in this instance you do luck check, D20+int" :D
THIS IS AMAZING< YES I@M SHOUTING THIS BLAH> SO COOL!
next project: pulley system for reading the book (hint: make the book circular)
I think you guys should work with 66Samus to try and make a cool looking drumset!!
You are the most wonderfully gorgeous and generous person on this Planet! 😍
I just saw your vid for the Van, I remember watching it all those years ago. I used to do Accident Repairs to cars , but people just want their vehicles back the way they were, so I'm thrilled to get the opportunity to paint something more creative like a Stock Car or Motorcycle Helmet. Often in my job as Cosmetic Repair Technician I have to recreate the pattern of a Wooden Bannister, Bathroom or Floor Tile or Patterned Worktop or Granite Sink. I just looked in to see what you've been doing lately. I'm still drinking my Coffee cold!  I hope you have a lovely Christmas and New Year holiday with your Brothers!❤+💋💋
I have been watching you for a while and I think you are fantastic ❤
Are they?????????????????????????????????
are the sketchbocks going to come Back?
You, girl, need to get your order of operations sorted. WHY THE DEVIL would you START with assembling everything and FINISH with staining the leather?! It's not like there's a compelling reason not to carve and stain the leather first, so you can re-do it if something goes wrong, and DON't have to re-do the entire project if you knock a saucer of stain over.
what that book REALLY needs is an integrated scissor jack in both ends so it can be held open at any position you want.
Here something for the next project https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2014/08/01/size-matters-part-2-giant-medieval-manuscripts/
Not sure if anyone know this series or already mentioned it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen spans eons of time as well as a lot of intertwined character stories as well as also a unique magic system :D
I felt a great disturbance in the force... As if.. Oh you know the rest.
It needs real rat spine spine...
really nice, could have also trimmed the edges to make all books equal length so they wont stick out.
It's the book for understanding women for men
22:37 Brandon Sanderson lives near here in Lincoln, Nebraska. He is such a cool author and our family members are big fans! I think one of them knows him but I forgor
that is fkin epic girl
in the future, maybe you could have sanded the pages to make them all even and flush
Never seen Nerdforge videos before, I don't really have a lot of time as a teacher. Also, raising kids of my own.  You said that it was a dumb idea, yet, watching you in the video and how you were working shows me your passion as a creator/artist. For all the dumb and stupid things that so many people do in this world that have no meaning and no yield, this for sure isn't one of them. This is something worth doing that will span many years and, you may even have people seeking to make one like this for them; it is most certainly a collectors item.
That's so funny, I saw the title and thought, I should do this to the wheel of time, what a coincidence
Can I have one?
I now have the sudden urge to do this to every book series I ever get in the future... Huh!
You did such a good job!! I'm excited to check the series. I've been wanting to read it for awhile now, and this just gave me the push I needed!!!
How many times did you double-check that you put all the books in the right order? I would've worried myself crazy that I would get two volumes mixed up.
If you want to create a stone texture, you can use cleaned stones from the yard :>
this is super cool.  but man, the pages not being trimmed to the right side is an unscratchable itch 😅  I am sure you felt the same way 😅
ignorant question: is there a way to print onto tracing paper so you only need to trace once?
I have this in ebook.  TOR sent out an (official) ebook of the entire series as a single ebook as a "for your consideration" for a Hugo Award one year and I still have a copy, since I was a member of WSFS that year.  It's the largest ebook (by MB) in my entire collection, and it has crashed ebook readers by being so big before now.
Impractical if you want to read it ...for real. I had to add. If I'm honest I'd have to admit I'd want it on my bookshelf. And I've already thought of a way to make reading it ...possible.
I was enjoying this until you added clips from that amazonian travesty,
At first I thought the Brown Ajah would hate it, but they would’ve loved it
This needs a set of balance scales to rest it on while reading BUT Instead of showing the weight it would show the percentage of book read.
This is so satisfying.
you could sand the edges of the pages down to make a flush fit maybe
Gorgeous
Honestly... what an introduction to a new series lmfao. I hadn't heard of the series, but seeing the love put into this creation and how much daniel was clearly so happy to get it... I might just have a new series to pick up
This is great! Project Slinky Book was a success! So pretty!
Back in the days of old(before 1990) We had catalogs locations that were made up of several clip-in books from different venders ( look up Tarifold Catalog rack) which would be impressive for what you did here.  IE: make each book be on it's own clip-in that can be place on the larger base that can be closed up with your belt making the single book. You would have an amazing display stand and a larger surface for the art of the binding and covers.  But hey I am just a nerd who has worked a long long time, who loves to help great artist with their crafting.
Upgrade the clock
О НЕРДФОРЖІ! Кличу теебе я............
That looks great! I’ve a suggestion, maybe you can make it detachable so that you can still take individual book and still usable. It looks pretty 🤍
aw you but so much love into it
@ariah
Should be sent to the museum of abomination...
Am I the only one that heard her start to whisper "That's what she said" after deciding the clamp wasn't long enough?
Where can I get the book series shown here ?
So, not using the new finger most of the time huh?
what's in the box? "a book."
What artistry.
I'm new here and I subscribed immediately. What an incredible creation. Also, I knew it would be Daniel Greene lol
That was absolutely CRAZY, I definitely LOVED it!!
You totally needed a full painting on the pages, Tar Valon, maybe the battle with the Orcs at the Three Rivers, Perrin running with the wolves or Mat in full battle mode, Rand and Nynavae at the last battle. This series has inspired me for over 20 years. Leather work wax great though
Can you please do some custom covers for Percy Jackson
If i worden work for a Puplisher i worden todaly try to hire you i love you book Designs   Ther todaly  better then somm Covers i See today in store
I love the Video   Hope it is ok thath i put rhe idea in my book
am I the only one who double checked his arms after seeing hers? 💪💪💀
Not going to lie but you look like jacksepticeye but female
Look, she made Winds of Winter a real thing
Wow
https://youtube.com/shorts/Zu9jWIAmHtM?si=fvzM1fUzx9ReTqr4
I haven't watched the video. I'm just here to say I NEED such a long book on my desk. Possibly the entirety of Ken Follet's works.
You're insane, I love it.
As someone who used to work in a bookbinding department of a local printworks, the different sizes of book blocks (+/- 1mm or so) can happen for a variety of reasons. Most commonly it's different settings on the folding machines and the three-blade trimmers. Personally I'd go with aligning them on the spine and head of the block. That being said, the end result is absolutely insanely amazing :)
hallo
that book is the size of the sun and i love it 💀💀
lololol! Love it!
holy fuck, this is so great.
i'm so glad youtube algorithm is pushing you guys' videos cause these are one of the most INSANE projects i've seen, and the end results are always so sick!!  keep it up y'all
Why.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
haha nerd. wheel of time is great
she is adorable
That was a fantastic project! Absolutely beautiful binding. I'm just annoyed that the books were slightly different sizes. I recall that one can actually sand paper with... sandpaper. So that could have been a solution to make the books in to same size.
As someone who is planning on making my own ridiculously oversized book soon, I actually learned a couple new tricks from this, so even though you think it's dumb (and okay, it kinda is, but you obviously had a ton of fun doing it so that makes it the best kind of dumb), the fact that it's not only doable, but the idea can be scaled down to fit other projects means it's still a useful idea.
INGENTING TINGELING!
Jeff Bezos will be jealous of this
hey, maybe you could make armor from The Witcher 3
Love the design and book!!❤❤❤ I would love a copy but, I know it’s a lot of work to make it.😊😊😊
Do you have the wheel of time? Yes. Which one? Yes.
Anlegemilch? Was soll das überhaupt sein...?
Honestly i would like this but Percy jackson hero's of Olympus and trials of Apollo
Someone should send this video to Mark Leach in case he ever plans to bring out his epic "Marienbad my love" in print.   Also great to find out about this channel through this video. Still a better idea than all the people who cut their books in half because they think its too big...
Hermione would be having an aneurism lol
The paper size difference is so frustrating.
I can imagine the author watching this video like: "..."
This is a whole new level of dedication! I love it!
Putting the bookpress ontop of the books to press is just pure genious but also chaos
this video makes me wanna read the books bro
I wonder how many times you checked the order of the books was right, haha
5:27 It's the reading rainbow
This girl is in perpetual need for some chapstick and a glass of water.
The wheel (WORM) of time (BOOKS) :0
Dose anyone else think of the book that king reads to the collecter in TOH?
Imagine gluing one book in a wrong order
💥💥💥
I knew it! It had to be Daniel! This looks amazing by the way... :o Still trying to get the hardcover editions myself.
well i must say you have one thing i am seriously lacking, the patience to do this. thought i would like to for one of my favorite book series
I dare you to print out and bind the fanfic "The Loud House : Revamped"  for context the wheel of time series is composed of 4,410,036 words. While the fanfic "The Loud House" Revamped" is composed of 16,777,215 words and by the way is still ongoing.
I had this idea when I first started making books 4 years ago, along with making a desk that will level itself with any book because i hated having my hand being on the edge or below what I was writing and everything just looked crooked
Ok, now I feel better about the request from my friend for a 2500 page book project.
wait wtf your studio looks like the magicians house in maplestory god damn
avg stem major book
I kinda want this book and I would literally read the series again just to read it from the book.
0:38 to see this done with a book... it hurts, a lot!  å se dette gjort med en bok... det gjør vondt, mye!
In order to read that epic book, you need an epic book mark.
how do you hold it
I'm getting Koro-sensei vibes.
This is cool but I'll leave the bookbinding to others. I'd rather do something a little more functional. 😅 Like making wearable gear for cosplay. That's something I can do without having a mental breakdown.
GRRM: “A Feast For Crows was too big to publish as one book”  Nerdforge: “Hold my beer.”
i adooore this vedeo ..
Now that's a book and a book and a book and a half ... AND a book.
Epic! I’m not at all sad I stopped reading the WoT series at book 5, though. Looking at that monster causes psychic damage. The final leather cover was just beautiful with such incredible detail. Sometime in the future, many years from now, someone will be tasked to repair this and they will scratch their head and be so confused as to what us strange historical humans were doing.
TIL Jordan actually finished the Wheel of Time. Guess that's one to scratch off my "Martin's gonna die before completing GoT" bingo card. Still wanna fill those Wurts and Rothfuss squares tho...
please make something about Naruto, AOT, One Piece
ein doppelt und dreifaches kunstwerk ....sehr schwer zu lesen , denke ich , aber super schön anzusehen ....
Jävlar vilken bok
i was literally panicking about the maps, thankfully she isn't a psychopath
To send this to my mother who is a big fan of Wheel Of Time or to not send it to her that is the question
Imagen somone asks you "hey do you have the third part of the the Wheel of Time series?" and your like sure I do! and they go like "Awsome! Can I borrow it?"......
The sexiest and craziest shit i have ever seen❤️❤️
5:27 it looks like a pair of legs
It seems like to read it you need a table that works a bit like a scales - you put one part on one end, the other on the other, and then add weights to your scale to go further in the book xD
You would need to read ~33 pages a day to make it all the way through in 365 days assuming the title is accurate.
And I thought the single book Lord of the Rings was bad.
I don’t know why, but this video made me feel really anxious. 😬
I just want to buy the sweatshirt when it comes out lol But also, why is every anti-virus warning me that the nerdforge website is malicious or steals data???
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolute masterpiece! You never cease to amaze!
Who needs a bookstand when your book is a stand
This but make it homestuck, I would die happily
damn amazing merch but so expensive
The fact that she took her time taking the pages out of the cover is stupid because she also paid extra for them to be hard cover
Wow, a norwegian youtuber in the wild, salutations!
wow just wow  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The amount of hours, sweat, effort and tears you clearly put into every project is inspiring! Idk how you have the patience, but nevertheless keep doing it, we love it!
when you couldnt decide if you want your hair to be beerus or super saiyan rose
Stop playing with yourself 😂
At the time stamp 12:11 it looks like she is using a dilldoe
please... i'm begging you to find a way to level out the pages.
This is ridiculous. This is RIDONCULOUS!
I've never seen this channel before that I know of.  You do amazing artwork.  Great job!  I was going to ask if you thought about reaching out to the author, but I did a quick look and learned he's not around anymore.  Maybe the publishers would like to pay you a bunch of money for the rights to mass produce your creation?  Don't know how that works on the legalities and such re: fan art of a copyright kinda thing.
Just asking cause I haven't seen anyone state it yet, but is anyone else looking in the comments to see if Robert Jorde commented on this?
This is amazing haha. You could've solved the uneven page levels with a sander of something, just to make them all the size of the smallest one.
Did you consider a hoodie with hidden UV paint writing / painting ?
I wish you aged the paper
Hi there Very impressive build. Nice to see so many crafts come together.  Question, why did you not sand the books down so the paper was the same size? Now you see where the books end and you basically made a cover for the books, but you didn't incorporate them. There is a clear line of the case you made and the unaltered books.
I’ve been meaning to read this, now I’m TERRIFIED
Damn, those joggers... I want them. But cat.
I KNEWWWW IT WAS GONNA BE FOR DANIEL, I KNEW IT!!!!!!!!!
this is the type of book your english teachers make you read over the summer
Ceyda? Senmisin? Çok benzetim 😊
Someone send this to Brandon Sanderson
That is such an over the top book(s)! Veldig imponerende!
You 2 are so talented!
I am so incredibly disappointed that you didn't shave down the slight excess paper sticking out to make the giant book even all around. I'm dumbfounded that you just left it like that. It's so quick and easy and it wouldn't mess with the text at all. This is a massive issue overlooked in this project. 😔
You are so cool and inspiring!! Sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t do projects that I have idea for because they are too hard or time consuming or stupid lol! But you just freaking did it!! Good for you!!
Recommendation:  pipe clamps. Need a big clamp, buy big pipe. Small clamp? Small pipe. I love mine.
1:17 Yup, that was a sneaky little; "That's what she said." 😂

First time finding this channel this project was amazing and the work was brilliant
This came at the perfect time, been meaning to rebind some of my favorite warriors novellas into one book!
Tbh ur Merch looks likew its made for U. I hope it fits for me to, i love the design and cut
you should uhm copy homestuck to one big boock uhm… (8.1k pages, 1.2m words)
What book series is that?
This is one of the coolest books I've ever seen; I loved Wheel of Time, bravo
Imagine, going to bed to read and being crushed to death by your book.
It should have been a circular binding. Double down on the FUN part, remove the CTIONALITY completely, and stick to the theme of the series! We're talking The Circle of Time here, not The Pillars of Earth!
The editor is really good 😮
I wish you'd levelled off the pages before finishing the binding.
if you print it with scritta paper (the paper used in bibles) it could be a 1/3rd the size.  if you are printing it anyways you could make the page size a bigger and make the whole much smaller.
what if you put the book on flat surface for reading and put something Triangle pyramid thing underneath it. so you can push and pull the trianglething sidewise to turn the pages?
Amazing
What a massacre ... you should be prosecuted for what you did to those books ...
EPIC!!
I stared at this thumbnail for 10 seconds, trying to decide if it was real. And then I realized, it's just the kind of absurdly over the top thing you would do.
The books were OK at best.  The characters are a bit whiny and the books after Robert Jordan died just are not the same.  I'm not sure I even read the last one.
If I received that from a friend via UPS, I would have been so touched I would have BAWLED.❤
i wanna buy your merch but non of the clothing will fit me sadge but nice design
Brandon Sanderson: finally a publisher who can satisfactorily accommodate my word count
i wouldve literally trimmed every book and just hoped that the margins on the inside look ok to make sure they all matched because otherwise idk how id cope lol

One thing to say about you you are amazing 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👊👏👏👏👏
This video is my first introduction to your channel lol... When I saw you cutting the books, I kinda died a little. But then i was laughing so hard ar rhe end result, that it was ok! This was  amazing! 😁😁😆😆😆🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ And i love your hair!💖💖
You’ve done a couple of bookbinding videos and it’s always looked really cool away to make a really cool custom version of a book you really love, and you’ve inspired me to try it so I’ve been purchasing one or two things for that hobby every paycheck for the last little bit but I will say I will never do this I have decided to put all of my hunger games books into one large bind but never anything this extensive. This is too much though it does look friggin cool and weird and I’m sure it it is kind of cool to have done and be able to tell people have done this but yeah, just a bit insane
now do the wandering inn lmao
You know what's even better? If you tighten the belt backwards it can also officially be read as a wheel.
The slinky of time is my favorite novel
I started watching your content yeaarrsss ago for bookbinding and seeing this is amazing 😂
WOW!!!!
Use a belt sander to square up the pages after blocking them together.
I have the weird urge to learn bookbinding now.
This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. I'm speechless. I'd love to have one with Dune. Or books by Carlos Ruiz Zafón.
a blinky!!
The only thing I seen as a missed opportunity was not doing art on the page ends.

I might be paranoid but I think this was a SpongeBob episode where Bob takes out a really really REALLY long book to find something out of his library
If he can read that wheel of time giant book, I hope he has time to read the whole Bible at least once.

What is the cello-led music you have playing while adding on your veg-tanned leather?? 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I've used leather stains in a refillable pen but the brush looked like it worked shocking well
And now you've made something that wont be read more than once, if at all.  You've turned something practical, that anyone could take to bed, or on the bus with them and made it into an ornament.  I love that someone actually did this eventually, and it's no longer in my head, but I now get the luxury of frowning and wagging a finger at someone who did this who isn't me.

Never watched a Nerdforge video and I haven't read a non-fiction book in 5 or so years and I don't know why I'm here but this video was awesome and this girl is having way to much fun in her life.
I am a graphics designer for a printing company and our customers seem to thing we can do this. Largest one so far for us was 3500 pages. It very clearly says on the site it’s 550 max
This is simultaneously the dumbest and coolest thing I've ever seen 😂 Sanderson is green with envy!!
wait so we can build nukes in those merch?
I has a challenge for you. Paint something with a focus on focus. Can you paint out of focus? Can some things be more in focus than other things? Is it a dumb idea? I think you could make something cool out of this.

This is actually super impressive
Love you martina
I may have to do this to my e books to make them easier to sort on my reader.
Your book is approx. half the thickness of the world's thickest book. It is located in the main library in Aarhus, Denmark. The book is 140 cm thick and weighs around 70 kg. it contains no fewer than 23,675 pages of laws, decrees, instructions, circulars and letters. It was made by Min A-kasse (a trade union) in the fight against rule tyranny.  However, your book is at least 100% nicer.
Thissss isss monstrous, this is more than amazing, this is soothing 😊😊
the fact that she never evened out the paper lengths kills me
That was excellent
this book holds the answer to woman logic.
Perfect idea for the zodiac academy book series.😂😂😂
I could tell by your hair you have nothing to offer
I am both impressed and appalled. Haha
You should've included a car jack to read it without stacking things on one side
Nerdforge is norweagian me to
First 5 minutes into the video: This is stupid. Last 5 minutes: This is awesome!
I'm here just because the unhinged thumbnail and i'm loving it
how tf is this free content? I feel like i'm stealing
I think if you had a big enough balancing scale, like one of the old school two arm balancing scale, I am pretty sure it would be possible to just open the book at page one and go through all of it while the scale would do the balancing to have it always lay flat on the page you're reading.
You can use sandpaper to even out the edges of the books so that the pages match perfectly. It's a trick we use in libraries to get rid of stains on the edges of paper but it also evens out the page edges.
It makes me wonder if you can use woodworking tools to eliminate the book to book steps - like hand plane it, or random orbit sander, if it's all clamped tightly. Paper is wood afterall.
sad you left off Brandon Sanderson's name!
Definitely clickbait. This was NOT an “abomination” whatsoever, you did AMAZING 😻

Veg tan. Tanned by the light of vegetables. Makes perfect sense!
Honestly she could have done that in a bikini and it would STILL be painful to watch her do this to books.
It may be semi-usable to read this by spreading it flat on the table. Lay it lengthwise, spine down. Open the first book. As you amass the pages, open the last book to even it out. Might need support in the middle or maybe the linen can hold it. Once in midway, you have a tall stack, then just let it "slide sideways" as you go to the end, finishing reading with book laying flat on a table. This will make reading of some pages awkward, as they will be vertical, but doable.
I have never been so happy, as soon as you said a youtuber who shall not be named... yet. And then when you told us you were shipping it overseas, I knew it was going to be Daniel. I am already subscribed to you both.   Also loved that Daniel pointed out how Jordan basically promised the last book would be "one book" even if he had to invent his own binding system or ship it with a free library cart. It was hilarious when Sanderson basically said - yeah it's gonna have to be three books. And you just proved it could have been done??!??
THIS IS SO WHOLESOME
That is sooo awesome
I’m gonna be one of those people; I need to know what song you used during the dyeing process, Shazam sucks.
You could've evened out the page sizes with a belt sander. Actually works really well on paper when it's stacked.
Mam, I want to know about your profession. Please reply if you can.❤️🥰

That's fucking hilarious 😂 Never read it. But my brother has. And I'm aware how chonkin thicc it is!! 🤣  Edit 2: The amount of effort and time.......wat?!?! I mean like....wat!!!! My jaw is literally dropped. This is such a high scale project! I'm dumbstruck by the effort, time, skill, love and passion that went into this!!! Outstanding! Fuck this. I'm subscribing! Never heard of you before this video. But the sheer scale of passion, quirkiness, talent, weirdness, authenticity and raw glee in this video alone is worth it! You guys seem like great people to have a beer with!!!
I swear to God if I ever write a massive book series I WILL sell a version that's just one big ass book
This is one of the best things I have seen in my whole entire life
omg I am speechless
It makes me a little sad that the offset cuts for each separate book weren’t sanded down to match up seamlessly.
"Ah yes. Just gonna bring my favorite book on the trip with me..."
I bought your new Merch today, its really great and comfy I would recommend it to everyone

Imagine, just imagine for a second, if you messed up the order of the books when you glued them together, and only realised after finishing reading the book before that.
It looks like a DM screen.
You seem Dutch
when you forget that she can make the page size larger
Since you do magic, can you also make that annoying accent disappear as well? I just can't understand Slavic people (although I think she is Germanic) who are unable to ditch the accent lol, I am one and I was able to, what is wrong with you... You speak English every day and have 3 million subs... Use your brain... Guess she is a paid channel actor/presenter :P
Whats the name of the song playing in 9:27? Loved ur video by the way!

Awesome! I have watched the first 60 seconds, and as a smart individual i will use this as a guide without watching it to the end. I am also a librarian, i will start doing this. Its going to be so much easier to loan every book by an author now.
You soud like a swed not gonna lie

You're offensively creative. Like it's actually insulting how creative you are. I don't want to be confronted with how much i wish i was more creative. At the same time, _that is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen._ I've done some minor leatherwork in the past, bit of a pseudo hobby, that is what i aspire to get to.  This project shows that effort, determination, and just sheer unguided and unrestrained stupidity can get you far. Thank you. :)  _God i don't even think that labor safety guidelines would allow you to lift that thing without mechanical aid, that's glorious._
now THIS is a bookshelf
now do all of one piece
YA call that a book. Now THIS, this is a book.  (Crocodile Dundee joke. 🐊🤠)
Very nice choice of books
The Wheel of Time series is literally my most favorite series of novels ever!!! I'm so jealous!  That binding looks amazing  😍😍😍😍😍😍
Didn't this girl used to have huge ear-spacers?
I would love to see something like this but with the Belgariad by David Eddings   It’s only 5 books so I think it would be a bit less of a monstrosity
That first part hurt so much to watch. Those books as a full set of hardbacks are so amazingly expensive. If I had to watch someone cut the covers off mine I'd cry. Amazing job though.
This is the most beautiful dumb book slinky thingy I’ve ever seen. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Beautifully done. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Thanks for sharing. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love you 🙂
That was freakin awesome!  So many series I've wanted to do that to.  It was so satisfying seeing this done.  Thank you for another incredible video.
I NEED this!!! Lolol
Still think you and Four Keys Book Arts should do a collaboration. 😊
Next time try that with the German version, it has 35 Books in total ;)  i kinda want one too :(
Is this the fnaf lore in one book??
Suprised you didn't plane down the pages any to get htem to look uniform.
Jordan would have loved it probably... He swore that last book will be one book even if people would need a wheelbarrow to move it around... Then Sanderson actually had to still split them into three.
The leather work is awesome af!
How many pages is that? I have a new project in mind! I want to write one book with whatever page number that is…
I just recived my books and they are such high quality omg asjdkdfk (the blue one is my favourite aaaaa (i really hope i can do them justice im scared of ruining them lol))
I hoped you'd address the issue of the books being a slightly different size by cutting them all to the smallest common format.
You could call it "The white tower edition" 😂
You've sent it with DHL? 😱 That was like a 1% chance that it'll arrive anywhere!
Quick question did you intentionally leave out New Spring?   But seriously very cool project.
Every bookworm's wet dream.
The skill and patience that went into this are astounding. "Abomination" might be a good clickbaity title for YouTube but I would refer this as a glorious piece of art. Exquisite.
You're gonna need a bigger lectern!
Now… for a new insane large book binding thing… Malazan: Book of the Fallen… a ten book series, and it irks me that it’s not one book like the title suggests😂
How about you make the pages wider instead of longer and you balance width and length to make it look like a Hulk book?
Future engineer here! Interesting idea for huge books machine!
It's always nice to watch ancient bookbinders doing some good work.
Solid Castles 2 throwback in the middle of the vid.
Could you make an animation?
New Spring isn't in it tho?

Wow! Absolutely fantastic work putting that all together! I am a huge wheel of time fan so kind of jealous that Daniel has that! Amazing work and a beautiful leather cover to go with it! So happy for Daniel as well to receive it and look forward to watching his future videos and seeing that displayed in the background :)!
Wow!! Blown away! But, I’m waiting for the Elder Scrolls Apocrypha reference…maybe flying pages next? 📜
Ok so I know this is not relevant to this video but do you think you could make like a medieval town cuz I would love to fallow along and Build one too.
Lol the way he was caressing it like it was his first born child.
Who cares? usless video
I thought the ratchet strap solution was brilliant
displate scammed me
now you need to build an adjustable mechanical swivel stand that allows you to read it comfortably
I feel like there should be a stand for this book with two platforms that you can adjust, so you can actually read it without having to hold it all the time
There was a 21,450 page binding of One Piece made as a sculpture by artist Ilan Manouach. It was the longest single book ever and impossible to read as a book.
Dropping that book on your face is a death sentenence😂😂
I thought that they'll send it to the writer, Brandon Sanderson
5:10  tethers: The final exam will be all the chapters in the book The book :
There is nothing to dislike about this video. It's wonderful
Tell me you’ll do one Harry Potter book too
I'm going to do this with the stormlight archive when it finally finishes
almost missed this since WoT wasn't the title. Good think our goblin lord sent us here.  EDIT: So glad I found it though. Can't hide the stupid grin on my face all through this video. WoT is probably my favorite series of all time, and this is just so stupid... and wonderful at the same time :)
Im surprised you didnt even out the pages that woulda annoyed my OCD lol (as the maker, not the free owner)
you need to read sagaq of recluce
I can't believe you destroyed those books.
I bet we all thought: "I bet Brandon Sanderson would be so jealous of this."
What a masterpiece 😍 Imagine if the edges were painted and the inside had dioramas. That would be extra mind-blowing and next-level awesome
This is the book you use when you want to get some workout done while reading!
Despite how ridiculous it looks, that is a work of art!
What a shame she couldn't be bothered to trim the pages to match, it makes all the other details so much less than they could be.
Do you think shaving the pages down would have made it smoother? Like putting an electric sander on it?
You were so preoccupied with whether you could, that you never stopped to think whether you should.
She's talented asf
This project is so dumb it was stressing me out a little bit, until I found out that the author would have thought it was dope as hell. 😅
1:19 i heard that
Woman´s manual . . . . . .  Part 1
Reading this book would give you mad biceps...
I love you but this was really stupid
wow martina that's so cool and amazing giant book i love it it's incredible
GOSHH! this is my second time watching your video...AND U ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING GIRLLL! I appreciate your hardwork you do for us... THANKS GIRL..BTW I am so wanting these sketchbooks in my hands! BYE!
Did you cut out the excessive appendices and just leave the one? or , make an extra book of just the appendices.
Well, let's be honest, veg-tan sounds a lot better than piss-and-shit-tan.
The amount of forced fake laughs is somewhat impressive, but also not.
you made a slinky
As soon I saw the thumbnail, I figured a solution how to read it kinda practically. Basically, you need a table with a oblong hole in it, with a seesaw in the middle. It'll have to be nicely balanced and as you go through the book, the weight on one side will raise the other so that the part that you are reading is level. Also the seesaw should be offset lower that the main plane of the table to accomodate the height of the book. Imagine it as a seesaw with two pistons where the weighted down one raises the lighter one up. You could make a table like that (maybe a collab with some woodworking youtuber?) And then auction/sell/donate or whatever the table with the book.
I was jealous the whole time i watched the video, looking at how cool your background is. The window mannn you just killed i thought it was real until i watched your set building video and its best work i have seen. Just mind blowing stuff.
I dunno why I have this stupid idea  Any medieval weapon, that also functions as a hat or hammer
You need some pipe clamps
Hey, you could even use a CNC machine to square the block. It would all come down to the page press you design. Hi tech there. Also content.
See? there is a typo - that is 'talking' and not 'taking'. Geez.
OK, I don't know how my emojis turned out like they did but it is exactly those cunning little details that you have to look out for when checking to see if you've got a record - like readability; content (contiguous material- not just random print); normal  pages and character size; etc.etc.  Pretty sure you've got a record. It's like trying to use abstruse Japanese kanji or even better - Chinese kanji and then they have to phone you up and ask you what you are taking about and then they tell you what else it could mean. Good luck with Guinness.😳
This video suddenly popped up on my feed and that's one of the best things that has happened. I have been hooked to your videos since then. Keep on doing things that you are so good at make then look so easy for the people on the internet.
She's got that flexibility 😏
I one mill subs think we can do it?
THIS. IS. GLORIOUS!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Missed opportunity to put "the complete series" on the cover.
That carving looked incredible! =O
Please make the BOOK-SLINKY a new merch item!
as a pro bookbinder im in love and am totally gonna make one too
What’s the outro song
nerdforge, she puts the fun.
Is this the Wheel of Time tetradecalogy in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?  But truly this is revolutionary! Never again can you loose a middle part of a series.
so you're telling me a vegetable tanned that hide?
Now you need to make a stool with two separete planes to put the book over there. While reading one plane goes down other goes up to open the book in the middle.
Now i understand everything you doing and you turend to a real boring influencer...
Damn looks amazing
i just  saw the video where she explains what happened with her finger and i have seen this video BEFORE knowing that and i NEVER noticed the missing finger...
now read it
8:03 I love the energy so much.
idk if i missed it but to clean up the edges of the textblock you could have ratcheted them in place and sanded the protruding edges with some fine grit sandpaper until they blended nicely. As long as you move with the grain of the paper it usually does the trick. A book plough would have worked too. It looks great!
Can ypu imagine 1000 years from now that book is found?  The details the effort, the size! Surely it must be something important!
The link to Discord is expired 😢 i really want to join 😊
I love your book videos I think you should totally try to make a book of the dead and book of the living from the mummy film with the working licking mechanism it has it be a fun challenge for you I bet
19:56 AYO??
Why?! 😢
1:15 nerdforge: yeah, that's not long enough.. *thtswtshesd*
This is how school's compulsory literature felt like during summer....
It’s so useless
To save tracing time and make finer lines on a large project like this use a laser to put tooling lines in. Just use a low power setting.
Hi, I'm a new subscriber!  I have watched this video twice now, and you uploaded exactly at a time when I was looking for some 'how to bookbind'-video's. I am stunned by the production value of these, and I'm off backtracking your earlier posts of the last few years. Best wishes from The Netherlands <3
I get a little nervous every time I see you with a blade.
What am I doing here at 2 am?
this was really cool :)
Insanely cool.
In a thousand years, archeologists will uncover this book and it'll spark several controversial conspiracy theories about how big our hands used to be
I love The Wheel of Time, that's amazing! The book came out awesome!
This is awesome but if I did this I would have to sacrifice myself or cleanse myself from such sin by bathing in acid.
wow ! impressive work :D  how many hours did it take to make it ? just a estimate :D  Sidenote : I love that series. im a huge Lotr/Tolkien fan, but Robert Jordans Wheel of Time series is at least just as good i think :)
You should send this book to MrBeast for a reading challenge.
your energy is amazing! thanks so much for your videos!
The acceptable maximum book thickness can vary widely depending on factors like binding type, paper weight, and the intended use. However, for most standard books, a thickness of around 2 inches (5 centimeters) is considered reasonable and manageable for comfortable reading and handling.  - chatgpt
Dá pra usar de quadro de tão bonito que tá
talking about productivity; i shat my pants
The merch looks dope, but the book looks doper
Was really enjoying until the leather
I gotta be honest... not straightening all the pages was a horrid mistake and just makes it look awful..
That looks soooo good (as always!), but it's sad that's the real leather😢
This is insane on so many levels x.x Incredible job, cheers to you !
this would be a pain to read. but also like a giant shark head on your wall or sth.
Oh my god… the effort…
Please give me some of your endorphins I need them
Wenn schon so ein Vielseitiges Buch, dann müßte es schon DinA2 sein. Sonst wirkt es nicht
Hullo Martina & Hansi, I am truly jealous as I am sure Mr. Sanderson is as well! Thank you for sharing this epic book creation! I hope you are thinking about creating a new omnibus book series, If I can make a small comment about the different book sizes? I believe that you can have the assembled tombs all together, maybe before you put the new cover on, have it In a press, get a finely honed flat plane. Set fine enough you should be able to trim the fatter books down to one size! It is no easy task, yet I know that you are unafraid of hard work! Paper is wood and a wood plane is a very good tool for joining planks of different size. Each book is just a plank of paper! I hope you don’t think I am in any way diminishing your accomplishment, this is truly amazing! I have never read this entire series but this would be a truly unique experience. Thank you for sharing your epic project, I hope you have a new one lined up! See you next video!
You missed the Prequel
how much does it weigh?
I can’t even comprehend making such a masterpiece and giving it away! I would keep it like the greedy goblin I am
This probably is due to how good you are in your work but I'm sorry I literally started this video saying wtf this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen who would do this and now at the end I can't help but want one because it looks absolutely sick.
A pipe/pole clamp is the solution here...
Millennials
I prefer to say there are 11+3 fantastic wheel of time books, Robert Jordan wrote his magnum opus which is fantastic and Brandon Sanderson absolutely nailed what was required of him to finish the book, it was supposed to be one but was expanded into 3 in order to do it properly, the series is severely underrated and the TV show is cancer, this reminds me, I should get started on listening to them again. My distinction is the forward in Sanderson's first book, that he isn't writing as if he was Jordan, he is doing his best to stay true to the series and deliver to best book possible based off of Jordan's notes, it's a happy story and a wonderful tribute to Jordan.
I don't know if it' work, but since the uneven edges were bothering you, maybe sanding them while in the press could help make them even? Anyway, well done, final design looks super cool. I've wanted to get into bookbinding for a while but it never occurred to me to make a cover for an existing book I have! May have to go through my collection soon...
can we just appreciate how much work she puts into her creations. its truly amazing.
Can somebody give me the name of the music at 9:45 please ?
I never heard of this book or Robert Jordan before but I vibe with Robert Jordan
Have the author review this
She should do it with every discworld novel
Im in love.
My modified sketchbook:  (I took my full sketchbooks and stuck them together)
The definition of "absolute unit"
Like the one Homestuck book
purely a nitpick but it's missing a new spring and the 2 companion books.
Could you have used a sander to get the pages even?
I wish I, didn't see it at Daniel's first, I wonder if I would figured, that it must be for him :D Amazing project!
Everyone talks about Les Miserables being a brick, what about this collection of books turned into one? XD
5:11 the twin towers 😂
Me: "It looks like a slinky!" Them: "It feels like a slinky!!! :O" lol!
I’m a big fan of a book with a landscape title on the spine
Make one of those trendy book shelves with that
Not to discount your ingenuity, but you should buy two pipe clamps.  They thread onto one end of a 3/4" steel water pipe and then the other end slides over the pipe.  You can easily clamp for any length within the length of the pipe like your bar clamp.
Cool shit
And the title of the book: 'Manual To Understand Women!' Hooray its there.
Ingen ting tingaliing!
Awesome!  Now do one with Terry Pratchett's Discworld series!  (Actually, don't - you might cause a fracture in L-space)
She dyes her hair because she is dangerous.
That clamps you were looking for would be pipe clamps. They are super handy for big projects.
Love this book series. Just imagined what this would look like with the German version which is 37 books...
Just thought you might like to know that you can sand the pages - like with an electric sander and sandpaper etc.. Yeah, you can put the book in a clamp and sand the pages although you would need tube clamps for making tables to do that giant book. You could experiment to see what works best for you. Also it might be the thickest book in the world (Guinness Record!):

You are a magnificent women…. Thank you for you hard work and fantastic designs and humor
That was absolutely amazing!!

Imagine going to a coffee bar and getting this book out of your bag
But did you check that the books are actually in their proper order?
"I'm going to bed and read." - the famous last words of Daniel Greene.
This is so amazing and creative! but there’s gotta be a way to get those pages even.
This is incredible!!
This book is going to need a sturdy shelf 😂
I ❤ the fact that you came up with this ridiculous idea and still made a polished and professional-looking finished product out of it. This channel is just plain amazing.
Will the sketchbock Saga ever come Back?😊
FINALLY we get to see the true scale of WoT! :D
how much would you say this project would cost? other than the books themselves. lets say I just came up to you and said hey can you redo it & here is the books, so basically how much would the price of hand work and other materials cost? simply asking out of curiosity and not cause i want one cause oh boi that book needs its own custom bookshelf and reading table

Wow, you're so good at making books and at everything. This book is so beautiful I don't know if you're prettier than that book or if it's more beautiful than you. I mean, you're so beautiful, even that book isn't more beautiful than you. But still that's my opinion.
EPIC!!!
Best project ever!!!
I must say, this is so dumb and artful at the same time.
average law school book lol
did she   by mistake made a ratchet and clank reference at 1:57
Bookbinder here. I'm just going to say that not every project is perfect, and I admire that you even made this work! I really like this one!
The widest volume in the Swedish National Archives is an 1813 tax list for Östergötland county. It is 113 cm wide and looks awesome http://narking.blogspot.com/2009/02/riksarkivets-bredaste-bok-113-cm.html?m=1
Love the book but I want that Nuka Cola fridge!!! 😍

Wow its just soooooo impressive!!! Amazing work of art!
what hair dye do you use is it just rlly vibrant or do u keep dying it
What if you mounted it around a drum that spun in an axis so you could read it by spinning the drum and it would be a wheel of wheel of time.
i have the perfect idea on how to read this.   Step 1: have a mechanism where you can attach both ends of the book to make a circle. (kind of like Julius's grimoire from black clover)  Step 2:  put the book in a lazy susan  step 3: put the lazy susan on a slightly higher table than normal( so the book can be at head height when reading), or just sit on a lower chair  step 4:  enjoy
how do you read it?
You mentioned the pages had different widths. Any reason you didn't cut them to the same width?
when ryanair allows you to bring just one book...
Happy noices when I heard it's the wheel of time series, it's my favourite series EVER
When this is found by some archaeologists in a few thousand years, they will think that Wheel of Time was about some important religion because this book was so elaborately designed. :D
Laughing while saying "yeah, thats not long enough" kinda hurt.
You need to get an edge trimmer for books now
She's like "Omg look at this dumb thing I made" and it's the most masterfully crafted beautiful thing I have ever seen.
I ain’t reading allat
Next, make the cherub series into one big book

I rlly wanted that clothes set but converting dollars to yens(japan) it’s WAY too expensive for meee ;-; Now I’m sad that I can’t have them, it’s too beautiful, I rlly wanted to buy them but I caaaany 😫😩 ;-;;;;
11:28 just realized I have a very similar shirt at home, same Death Metal with rainbow but the sleeves are the same color as the rest of the shirt. It used to be pink but it's faded now.  When I used to live with my mom she'd get mad at me for wearing it in public even though I liked it. So I made a point to wear it as much as possible.
the eimiko color hair
I saw the book opened to the middle around 5:30 and thought "Mr. President, there's been another phone!" and a cell phone being thrown at the book, knocking it over  Thank you, ADHD, very nice.
i have a question: where do you find the wheel of time books that don't have the series cover?!
you can also use a saw to cut notches into the books and then put rough string the ones that are like a small rope and glue it with that, it'll hold better than linen sheets. Then again this is far too big for that I suppose
Imagine finding halfway throughthat  you got the order slightly wrong
I wanna see Stephen kings the dark tower series as one book
Looking at 56 books of "Ричард Длинные Руки" by Гай Юлий Орловский which are on TWO of my bookshelves... ...no :-)
This is amazing! I do wonder if you could have hand sanded the pages into alignment, when you had the strop and planks compressing them.
When you ask the wizard if any of the tomes have any spells to find some bitches, he pulls out this one first.

Using books as a book press lol
@Nerdforge I have an idea for a book. How about Howard Lovecraft's book, The Call of Cthulhu. It could be made of green leather and have a realistic three-dimensional Cthulhu head on the cover, maybe with red rocks instead of eyes
this girl took talent to a new level holy cow
“Class it’s time for library “ “Can I get my book from my backpack” “Ok” “I need some help” “Wdym- WHAT THE -?!”
No credit for Brandon Sanderson on the cover? 😄
I have only read the first book of this series, and I love it. Seeing this is both an I love it moment and partially A I hate it one
I don't know why she's laughing...books having legs
I find it sad that she did not even the pages sizes out, like cutting the sides
The jogger set is so badass! I really wish I could afford it! The fact that you can choose different sizes in the top and joggers, with the top being oversized as is, and US plus sizes, makes me ridiculously happy! I'm a genetically busty, broad shouldered woman who unfortunately has much smaller hips and bum, so single size sets never work because if the top fits then the pants fall down, and if the bottoms fit the top is way too tight.  Amazing job as always on this epic mega book and case! I would have definitely done small-scale tests of the dying techniques though. 😅 That part made me so uncomfy. 😬
Reminds me of undergrad. If it couldn't be fixed with duct tape, construction adhesive, pva glue, ratchet straps, and hole filler, then it was a lost cause. 😂 Often the whacky and ridiculous solutions were the best. It did hurt my soul a bit watching you remove all of those hardback covers. I understand why, but there's always going to be a part of me that stings with deconstructing books.  I saw a post of someone who would cut large books in half, down the spine not across the pages if that wasn't understood, so they were more portable, and this is like the opposite of that. One person responded by saying that they did that decades ago while hiking for months at a time where weight and space are at a premium. He would mail the parts back to a friend who would send the next part as instructed. This was before tablets and e-readers were really a big thing, plus solar cells and batteries were pretty crappy back then too.
The first 30 seconds are edited like an ad
I thought Martina was going to sand all the edges even, since each printing was slightly different. But then she bound the edges and it was too late. :(
Dumbest but prettiest
this has made me wanna watch the series, I was a little hesitent because each episod is around an hour long, but you sold me on it
I would die to see this done to my favorite 8 book series Throne of glass!
I love the wheel of time!! I'm so glad you did this.
She has the same hair as me
This is the coolest things you’ve done IMO
I really wanna see @brandsanderson react to this
I think it would have been nice to cut all the edges a bit so they are all flush. But cool project.
Wouldn’t the buckle damage the pages? Given the weight of the book and it lying on its front….
When I heard "fourteen" and saw the familiar colors on some of those spines I turned it all the way to the max quality and yes indeed, mu assumption was obviously correct!... But what about the New Spring?
just thank you
And now i'm getting the itch to get back into bindery.
your house looks so cool!!!
Wait a minute, can you see someone's comment history? I've said some stuff I probably shouldn't 😨
At least you can really call it heavy reading, now?
Haha 3ft book
What’s with the hair?
finally a book to write some of my failing qualities in now i just need like 20 more
i would love a poster of the spine art.
As soon as I i saw the title, I thought, "Hm, that's about how long the Wheel of Time series is." The algorithm nailed it with this one, awesome video
If I liked channels that review books I'd check out his channel
at 2:05 did you become french or is that just me??????

stumbled across your channel with this video, absolutely loving the chaotic energy!
I looove the cryptic Hoodie and Jogger, but it sadly is soo expensive. I was ready to pay the 115€ for it but with shipping and taxes the price almost doubled... And I am not ready to pay that :/
Could you put it on a wheel you just keep turn counter clockwise as you read through it?
So does this only count as one book for the goodreads challenge or...?
This book looks like how it felt to read the LOTR trilogy off of the three-in-one paperback edition
Such a silly idea really turned out to be EPIC!
Me who wanted to get the collection but too late 😭❤️🫡
Skjera Bagera xD
Diy book slinky
It's really a pop up book lol
One time when I was a kid I Interlocked my teachers thick book and no one could,so the class spent the rest of the class period trying to pullit apart.
He should have a lectern made that stores the book inside of it, with the two covers resting on a double-jack system. Then with a dial or a lever or something, the reader raises one jack and lowers the other in tandem, which allows the pages to turn forward or back while leaving the open page at a constant height. It could be a very snazzy way to actually read it.
That big book in Fling Things and People on Roblox be like:
It ain’t wasteful if it deserves it and if you don’t think it does take some time and watch the video if anything it’s wasteful to not
There will always be that one person that wants to destroy it.
i recognized daniel from the silhuette, before it was even revealed it was wheel of time
TBH I only clicked because of your majestic hair.
how martina and hansy do this is beyond what my tiny human brain can figure out! you two are a damn good team of makers !!!! i cant believe u made something even the author of the series would be jealous of <3
hello professional bookbinder here :D I must say sure there are things I would do diffenrently if I would bind a book (esp. concidering durability) but most of the time when you make bookbinding projects i get inspired. inspired to venture out in my own feeld and try something new and not be afraid of just doing. so thank you for that and keep up totally insane book projects! i'm rly looking forward to them🤗
I love this sooooo much ❤  and I'm 9
This would've been fantastic with any series but it being WoT makes me love it even more.
12:12. Ahem?
Great projetct, art ist the most impressive thing XD  Ps. Your boyfriend is hot
First time seeing this channel - you are a wonderful force of nature. Bravo!
Awesome video, perhaps you could have mounted it on a wheel 🤔
If i write on it everyday im sure it'll be a great autobiography trust
New Spring?
Yeah so this was the easiest subscribe decision of the year. The fact Jordan himself wanted this was the icing on the cake. Actually epic.
Good shir
Now do the warhammer series
Yeah, that size definitely would have benefitted of the proper way of sewing and supports…😂   Though maybe it’s simply too big.  Maybe at least glue in some good linen cords in the spines instead of just gluing on some linen backing?  I just don’t know…😂  Oh well…in any case best luck, the size at least should largely prohibit use anyways…😅  Edit: Oh good gods, you actually have sewn on headbands……..😂😂😂 If there ever was a good case for pre-made headbands this is one of them!  The leatherwork is beautiful!  But given that it’s tightbacked with veg tan may pose challenges for preservation if the ability of opening it is to be preserved for a long time.
I can’t imagine how annoying that’s gonna be to read physically
If that’s not Fnaf lore book I don’t know what is lol 😂
I wish I could get the hoodie outfit in purple or something
Nerdforge and Mark Rober are like the art and science teachers at Hogwarts.
back to your roots. your bookbinding videos were how i first found your channel!
🥓
Reading and arm trening
If this isn't what the tenth Stormlight Archive book looks like, I'll be seriously disappointed.
This is the level of hilarity and trolling I need more of in my life
I really want to see Brandon Sandersons reaction
imagine if she puts only one book in the wrong place xdd
Amazing
I cannot comprehend how much I love this. Wow.
Wheres ur finger bruh
The Wheel of Time is such a terrible series. Literally “antiquated sexism: the series”. Liking those books is deeply embarrassing
How long did it take until pages started falling out.
I'm a book restorer, and I can already tell you that some other book restorer will get this book in 200 years and be like: wtf.... how am I supposed to fix this 😂❤

It's NOWAY 4 U !!!! hehehehe German League of Legends Streamer with Snorlax Patronus
what a crazy array of talents and craftsmanship :O
Oh my god I don't even want to know how much that cost to ship 😭
Do the same with one piece
The small little "thats what she s.." was beautiful 👌
you always make the sweetest and most thoughtful gifts while letting us see the whole cool shabang this is awesome hahah
Yo can I have that?
Love the energy, love the idea and love the end result. Have never heard of your channel but this definitely is worth a subscribe!
this is just amazing
This showed up in my feed out of nowhere and I've never been happier 😂
This is a lot of crackhead energy and I can't judge because I do the same.
Could you replace the carving with a laser cutter?
That was the morst amazing piece of art I have EVER seen. I am speachless, mindblown, and encouraged to reed every book from Wheel of Time :D thank you so much.
You are so increadibly talented!🤯
And now try to read that in public (-transport)
Dude, one-volume WOT has been my dream for ages... ever since I saw a one-volume OED.
can you do more series like this?
Why didn't you trim the paper at the margins to make it all the same?
So cool but so dumb! 😂 Love it! Those covers came out incredible.
i love how youtube recommended this to me right after i started the first book
So many trees
1:28 the book press... pressing books... uhh... xD
That isn't a Spine, that's the whole damn Back.
Now do all of discworld. 😂
Cool, so now we finally know how to print vol. 1 of "Understanding women"
Soooo awesome !!! You very inspiring me for do something like this!!!
I need answers. There's a cartoon that had this gag back then. A book with a ridiculously thick spine. I forgot what the artstyle was, the context, genre, and what color the book is. It MAY have been a movie because I remember the movent to be smooth.   But the visual of a really tall book is a prominent memory of mine. I may have been 3-4 years old or something, Im 25 now.
That was indeed a really beautiful book <3
W I D E   B O O K
And you're a Wheel of time nerd!!!!???? I didn't think i could crush on you any harder!
I need a book like this
You kinda look like Sasha Trusova
For me this is a childhood dream come true. I have always fantasised about a book this long and it finally exists.
honestly you have done many a project i wish i could do, im tempted to do something like this one day with each arc of the warrior cats series being its own book lol. i'll probably forget to do it but, who knows
The fnaf lore
At 5:30, you made a book gender reveal. Congratulations it's an He book
I have some of the Displate on my wall and they are so pretty. But.... if u have wonky ass walls in ur home like me or if ur wall just isn't smooth the plates will keep falling down -_- (bc the stickers won't stick to a wonky wall)
pov how it feels reading a bible:
Wait, you could stand it up and make it a ring with the ends touching, and would be an actual wheel while you’re reading it! 😂
Ddddddddddddf
Fffcdvb
Debe thanks so very sweet of your dad to
Omgood  Just a heads  Uk thanks
Why not make a dragon costume for your self
This is so cool YouTube recommend me this channel never watched anything like this before. thought it was just going to be a goofy low effort video of just glueing some books together then calling it a day lol. I just can’t get over how cool this is though and never knew a book cover could look that good
This is great but the only thing I would NEED to do is trim each book to the same size so it looks uniform, other than that it's just about perfect.
do this for harry potter?!
Now you need to build a stand that allows you to actually read it! A crank mechanism that raises one pedestal while lowering an adjacent one :)
Most bad ass and impractical thing I’ve ever seen.
I have absolutely no interest in books of any kind, never heard of that book series and don’t intend on reading it. BUT, your craftsmanship is DIVINE and your merch outfit looks so fucking cool I wanna buy it so bad. Great video
As soon as I saw 12,000 pages in the title I knew right away it was going to be Wheel of Time lol.
The Lord of the Rings (the movies) caused a lot of social issues. This is an example.
I saw the thumbnail and audibly gasped in sheer terror
Wow, she has some awesome skills! 👍 Yes, whomever receives this book MUST READ IT!!!! Every page!  Ahhh, there needs a mega bookmark!
YOU HAVE TO DO HARRY POTTER
Gotta definitely send this to the writer and author of this book series. The design that you came up with that has a dragon is absolutely stunning.
Super amazing project. Kinda wish you sanded down the pages to be aligned between each volume.
This is how I die and I will die smiling
OH MY GODDDD I NEED THIS BUT WITH EVERY HARRY POTTER BOOK
your a horrible human for making this lol
Just a bit of light reading…
That looks INSANELY BEAUTIFUL! 😮
I didn't know I needed this colab and yet
Wow! Totally amazing!!!!
1,000,000th view
wow!
Every wizard needs a tome that requires a ladder and an extra stack of books to read.
Should I read "New Spring" at the start since it's a prequel or read it in the order of release?
this but the bible and 1000 years ago in greece or china or something
😮
I need to learn this for my Pokémon card collection from 1999-2023-2???
I saw your thumbnail and channel(ha channel) for the first time and immediately said "If only Robert Jordan would have seen this."  I had no idea what I was about to see.
It is so absolutely beautiful to watch your brain at work. I couldn't even imagine how it works through all the colours and the processes of carving the leather. It's also funny watching the slinky times. Thank you for the video! :D
I eagerly await the sequel multiple decades from now when you do this to the Stormlight Archive
respect
That book is only like half the size of the book where I keep all the times I have seen cringe on this platform.
i’ve heard of thick/heavy books being called “doorstoppers”, but this thing is a barricade
God, I hope Harriet McDougal and Brandon Sanderson get to see this absolute masterpiece!
What accent is that?
This is like my Idea. All the dictionary's of the different languages that I can get then attach them.
BOOK SLINKY!! 😂😂😂 Edit: vegtan= tanned with vegetables or something right??
Lmfaoooooo comically thicc book
thanks for previewing what the winds of winter will look like when it releases!
I always procrastinae whatching nerd fridge videos and I'm like why am I even subscribed, but when I do eventually whatch the videos they create bonkers stuff like this which is literally the most beautiful thing on earth
THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND HILARIOUS AND AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL ALL AT ONCE, I LOVE EVERY SECOND OF YOU MAKING THE BOOK SLINKY MARTINA!!!
I loved the wheel of time series! amazing video
it would have been cool if it was like a leather bookbox yk, you can still read the books separately but for display on a bookshelf the back side would have been awesome
I would love to see this without the time lapse!!!!
Ok, now I need to see this but with Percy Jackson.
You should do this with Harry potter books
Very enjoyable! Great work! Loved it!
the amount of crackhead adhd in this video makes me happy
Ah yes, imagine you wanted a book along to work to read during the break.
Can you remake your camper video from 3 years ago but make it fantasy?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
what‘s wheel of time even about
I need to see a video of you taking this to the author to sign.
The level of talent on display in this video is just incredible.
You destroyed those gorgeous maps :(
Awesome video! Me and my four-year-old's favourite channel to watch together. I was momentarily distracted by that shiny ring on Martina's ring finger though... 🤔😉
imagine accidentally putting one in the wrong order
If I could afford this masterpiece, I would own this masterpiece. 10/10
This is the book that Charlie Brown did his book report on in the peanuts movie.
"I have it and you don't Sanderson" is not a phrase anyone ever expected to hear
I have never been more scared by a thumbnail in my life
Ah, it has been done. Working out and reading at the same time!
I haven't finished the video yet, so you may mention this. How much would a book with this much effort put into the binding even cost? I can only imagine many thousands of dollars!
I watched this because the thumbnail kinda reminded me of my PhD. The bookbinders did a professional job on that, but nothing like this! Glad that it brought me to this channel - loved the project and the video!
Where are you from?!?!?!?!
Awesome job! Have you ever thought about using laser engraver to transfer the image from computer to leather? I think it should work on minimum power, to make slight contour, which would not be visible after you do all the work with leather.
Comically large book:
😮😮
For the advertising, were we using a garden spade as a microphone?  😂
Cool
Amazingggggg <3
I’m just surprised that humans can create stuff like this
''light lecture''
That would be the perfect one book for my library.
"stop playing with yourself" is underrated...
Ive only seen this one video of yours but that merch is so cool if i had money id buy without hesitation
This is what I would call a real book, if it can't be used to squash man-eating ants the size of a small dog, then it's not a book.
Omg. This is epic ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
POV: The Dictionary
I cannot even express how much money I would pay for something like this. I'd take out a loan to pay for it, and like from shady people too, idgaf.
And, of course, the answer to 'why' is 'why not?' 😀
unfortunate that you didnt cut/grind the pages down to equal size.
Make ice wing armor  (Tip is a dragon)
For the whole video I was like "dang her pants are really cool I bet they were like a few hundred dollars from some boutique" but like no THEY'RE HERS AND YOU CAN BUY THEM
Oh my god! It came out so cool! You should do this when all the books from The Empyrean series come out as well
As someone who loves “brand new” books, or those that are in very good condition, this hurts. But as someone who likes art and has wanted to read a book this big, it’s beautiful.
I think would be nice to build a case for all the books insted the binding just because to read after wont be possible :D
You should do something solar punk inspired
This is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
"oh man, i do loooove the hobbi- wait why is it harry potter?"
Oh god, now I wanna try and read that entire thing.... The entire book....
I just started that serie
That one SpongeBob episode
Didn’t knew you german
Why am i here again? Youtube suggested this, and I have no idea why i watched it all the way without skipping anything..  Good Job making me like this!
Wow!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LXN7ekKUvc
If it's stupid and works It is not stupid Linus S 😂
I kept laughing at how stupid an idea this is like, noooooooo..... this is sooooooo stupid. And the moment the leather cover and the spine went on. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 it is so beautiful and awesome❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤.
Do this with warrior cats I dare you
The intricacy and love in this is amzing😊. You put so much time and effort into this "stupid project" and people like you are really underrated😅. Thanks for the amazing vid ❤
This was so ridiculous and amazing! I had no idea all these bits have to be done manually
We need a sea lemon reaction 😂
I cannot imagine how much time this took!❤❤
this is all children's dream..
imagine if you dropped this on your face when you're reading it late night
Thats amazing
re-watching this fantastic video, and there are a couple of other book series that I'd love to see get this kind of treatment.  I just think it's fantastic and I love it.  I'm absolutely gonna have to try... someday.
This should be the thumbnail: 17:24
But did you ger book rate on the shipping? :P
Congratulations, you just made something that should be a museum piece.
You know books are usually thinnest on there side the dimension of this one are all off LOL
I have a handbook of physics from the 50s in my collection. Your 12,000 page book is *almost* as thick as it is.
tjena bagera !
I have legitimately always wanted to do this
Can you still read this on bed without it hitting your face though. You should make a new video about it
The real name of this book is How to understand girls
you are crazy but ı love it
I didn't know book spines could look this amazing
First merch ive ever seen that makes me want it so very much - awesome design
One word DUM!
I'd bet Robert Jordan is looking down and is proud of you all!
I guess an actual release of a One-Book-WoT would be on A4-sized paged, small font, bible paper :D
I love how I just knew it was @danielgreenereviews from the beginning haha
I LOVE THIS
10/10 would kill for this 😂🤩
Now here comes the challenge: try reading all of it
I’m imagining a one piece manga of this rn
a bood so large it could be a boodpress on its own.
Nori❤
telling the people nicely, its still a dead  goat lol
Next Stormlight Archive book
Major wheel of time fan.  What a coincidence i clicked on this random video.
Now... Who here thinks we need a book slinky? And a book slinky stair test? 🤔
That is freaking amazinggg!!
This is actually so fucking sick
This makes me want to do this to my favorite book series, Wings of Fire!!! You did such a great job, It looks amazing!!!
Now if only the edges of the pages were singed to give that extra color/old vibe or just colored using candle smoke.
Watching all those beautiful hardcovers get destroyed was painful to watch. And then I had to question why this monstrosity doesn’t include New Spring.
I thought reading omnibus was uncomfortable
Somehow it hurts my soul to see a book dismembered. 😱 The end result was worth it, though.
Cutting ✂️ up the books is killing me. Example of way too much free time.
Is this potentially a world record ?
This is the World's Biggest book, change my mind
0:18 joe biden?🧐
That isn't stupid. I've thought of this idea a looooooong time ago! Not for this specific series, of course.
The open book looks like the creatures from the Java bit on the Muppet show
I think you should build a special book holder just for this book as a separate video, something that would help the reader navigate the book. Maybe something with a pully system :P
This is nuts. My Grandma had a leatherbound Shakespeare's complete and annotated and illustrated book that wasn't this thick. Nice work 👍🥰 the book nerd in me cried at the ripping of covers, but you did a good job putting it all together
Is she swedish? She sounds kinda swedish
You should google for Margaret Hamilton.
one of the best series ever.
Should bound every other book upside down
It pains me knowing how rare they are I was going to get a set for my collection but it was way out of budget but the end result was amazing
I bought 5 Displates with your discount code today 😊 happy to support you guys like this and I'm excited to see those plates on my wall!
you have to be strong to carry that piece of wood of a book 😂
"I have it and you don't, Sanderson!" is a simple spell, but quite unbreakable
Strooong Shirley Manson vibes, lmao.  Love the WoT shoutout!!
The funniest part is this book couldn't even fit someone's life story on it. Tho it would make a better summery.
This would be perfect for George RR Martin
"you could just use 2 tiny lil car jacks to lift each side to a certain peak, that way its actually readable 🤓" - me
This is the epitome of “I ain’t reading all o’ dat”
Thats what i call, heavy reading.
Are you from Sweden
about 2 minutes after Fizz said "here's my 2 minute notice" he called mammons name, whether intentional or not still an amazing detail, (the time is off by about 5 seconds but that doesn't matter)
I always get super happy when I see that she has uploaded a new video she is the best youtuber
Please, create a contraption for reading this book 😆
You are so skilled!  I can tell you put in a lot of effort 💪
This is the first nerdforge video I’ve ever watched and it’s filling my nerdy little heart with fuzzy feelings i live this so much
RIP Robert Jordan.  The Wheel of Time goes down in my books as the best fantasy series ever created (yes, I'm saying it's better than LotR and DEFINITELY better than Harry Potter).  Shame they rushed the TV show so much, and didn't give it the care and time to develop that Robert Jordan meant for it, but as a standalone show it's fine I guess.  VERY cool project, I would love to have a replica of this, even if reading it seems impossible, just to have it.  Great job on the artwork too, looks great.
The way I knew that this YouTuber was going to be Daniel Greene makes me think I need to go out more 😂
You have not made a book you have made a boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooook
Almost as big as the book titled: _Understanding women, pocket edition, chapter 1_
watching the nerdforge is dangerous bc it makes me want to rebind my Good Omens book
This looks like what my nerd friend has in school
5:15 how to find halfway through your book
My heart that ADORES the maps in books in the beginning💔😭
ok class flip to page *eleven thousand five hundred sixty four*
Man, I love her studio.
I'm somewhat surprised that the sides of the books weren't cut down to be flush with each other.
Fascinating.
Imagine taking this to a book signing! 😂
When the dumbest idea meets the dumbest person:
First time seeing this channel and already subscribed
The fact you made a "That's what she said" joke and cut it off halfway in the video is hilarious
I really want to know what happens on the middle page.
What no Breaking of the World joke when the maps split?
that book is like some of books i anime l wes looked
😲😲😲😲😲😲
Best part(s) of the video.... Martina repeatedly saying "glue".
It would be an interesting idea for a next project to combine several books into one, but create a mechanism that would allow each section to be undocked and docked whenever necessary.
LMAO at " book slinky "
Loving the new merch! How stretchy are those joggers at the waist? Im those hard to shop for in between sizes, apple shape and short (5').. so leaning one way is either a bit too large or too small. T-T
this is the coolest thing i have EVER seen omg all the work that went into that..
This is the first video of yours that I saw but I *need* that merch! The hoodie & joggers are legit the coolest merch clothing I ever saw!
amazing
when you press numpad 8. you get nice surprise :D
omg i love that hoodie where can i get that? OH i see its in the store. GO GET YOURS NOW
So much effort for such a ridiculous project... I love it
I love it 😀 so 😎
You either need a really weird table or really strong arms to read this, but it looks great
The book is madness and brilliant at the same time. I can't imagine how long it took to make this and how much patience. It could be difficult to read but the cover art is amazing and overall, the product is simply magnificent. I love how the book also resembles a wheel.☺❤
Dear Assistants/publisher/staff/CEO, Please gift her a giant book press and something for these epic books to rest on while they are read
I would never have thought to do that. The wheel of time is one of my favourite set of books. I  have all of them both written and audio. Have you heard of David and Leigh Eddings? The Belgariad, the Malloreon, Elenium and Tamuli are fantastic books. Also the books of Aundre Norton, Ann McCaffrey or Katherine Kerr are all fantastic sci fi books to look in to. All of them have a lot of set's
She may have less fingers than me but she's got more patients and time than me
Well  I think you confirmed the reason why Volumes are a thing in real world conditions...
I heard wheel of time, immediately thought of Dan 😂
i want that this movie will be deleted from the internet and when in 200 years from now someone discover this monstrosity on someones celling and they will have the biggest mindblow on the world xD
Du bist die englische Version von sahrah malt schwarz😂
Never heard of the wheel of time, never been interested in the proces of making a book. There’s still absolutely no denying all of the immense effort and expertise that went into this.
WOW......I meen.....WOW!!!
isnt displate a scam?
My breakfast lasted 24 minutes and 03 seconds today😊
This is cruel book abuse.
no FUCKING way you put ALL the maps at the end. you’re evil. it’s already enough of a pain to constantly flip back and fourth between the map and what i’m reading
that is insane
Can anyone tell how the background music track is called (3:00)?
If it's stupid but it's work, then it's not stupid anymore
oh shit xd i made a notebook with over 400 pages 120g each xD but THIS is... :O
"I ain't readin' allat"
That’s insane, you know?! 😊😅🔥😍 crazy but wholesome stuff! It’s gorgeous! That was super cool watching how u were making this variation for this book series )) best wishes and thanks for the video! 🌟🥳
we. need. this. 😯 ❤
That's a book from anime for MC to learn magic from, omg! She brought a book from animation to life)
absolutely crazy. i love everything about this!! omx wow so well done.
I know I don't have any advice to give a master like you, but I've learnt a few things from your videos when I started book binding. When the edges stick out just a few millimetres, you can sand them down (either with sandpaper or directly with the sander). It might save you a trigger next time!  Otherwise, what a magnificent project, I dream of having your talent!
I saw a book of comparable size in "Inspector Gadget" movie.
now make a bookmark
That might be the biggest “strap-on” I’ve ever seen. 😂😂😂 terrible joke.
😲 Wow! That spine is stunning, and so intricate - Daniel is one lucky guy! "It's a book slinky!" 😂
"HeheeHeH HeeEeeeeee"  "Yeeeah thats not long enough" "THATS WHAT SH-"
It’s like a dm screen! 😂😂
I love the wheel of time... the show is ok but the changes ...😢
Just him caressing the book
woah i haven’t watched any kind of book binding content before but this is absolutely incredible
If I made a book like that I would wanna be buried with it
vegtan, is best...
Great work but next time pls use godl paint
Slinky book
The only way this could be better would be if the two ends of the spine were somehow merged, making the whole stack a giant book ring.
Two new subscriptions from one video… Im not angry
That's is so cool, so big and I love it, the dragon is amazing, awesome and beautiful I love dragon so much 😊
This inspired me to try a similar project. I'm going to take all 14 books and put them on my Kindle.
At least that abomination of a tv series was only referenced once.
Your hairs looks soo cool 🤩
Your creativity knows no boundaries 😮
12000 pages is crazy!
This is like the best thing i hace ever seen
Didn’t RJ say he would make a new book binding system for his last book if he had to? Edit: I should have waited until the end of the video before I commented.
you should check out hollow knight
I have a book for you to read.
“Stop playing with yourself.” 💀
You guys always blow me away with everything you make.
The mad scientist we need
youtube finally decided to show me your channel, this is actually so ridiculously cool & i thank you for being such. very excited to watch all of your content !
Can't believe I've only just discovered your channel! Ive been binge watching your amazing videos. Can i ask, what do you guys do for work? How can you afford all your cool equipment?
To be a maker's friend, and receive gifts like this! That's the dream.
Now fill all pages with ur drawings
The whole time I was thinking if someone actually wanted to read it from the beginning that getting before page 4000 would be tricky 😅
does anyone know the name of the pink thing that is at her table?
"Martine, kan jeg få låne tidshjulet av deg?" "Selfølgelig" *PANG* "Lykke til"
You also need to make a water  based u-shaped book stand, so however you open a book it will always be the same height and always adjustable however you open this book. Would be cool project for this book os the books
Sorry, but when I saw the thumbnail and titled, I was reminded of that old misogynistic meme 'Understanding Women, abridged, pocket edition'.
your work belongs in a mesuem
are you  transgeneder???
1:17- I caught YOU! Sneaking away from a "That's What She Said" moment! Say it proudly! Wear it the F$&K out!! 7:20-Still making those lovely headbands! ... 7:27- FWEWWW! 12 hours!? 7:38- Nice product placement. Thought it was for coffee, and LEFT TUNRN! 12:46- Oh, you're both carving the leather. I though I saw the fingernails change. ;) 13:00- Ooof-da!! 21:20- He would have loved it! 23:28- I think in fifty years there will be collectors looking to gather your crafts into collections. Seriously! They'll be like, <snobbish nasal Brit-voice> "I'm lending my group of six NerdForge castles to The Tate for a couple of months while they extend the library , don't cha' know?" "Yes, quite." "Well, Any luck locating the second Elves Spell book?" "Yes and no. I've found whom is it's possessor. I don't know WHERE they've gotten off to.<sniff> Just as well that he won't sell it. Maud's collection of wears is still growing. Can't let her show me up with and equally incomplete set." (oops. there I go again. dialoging the future.)  :)
It's the Bookhenge!
I need to do this for the harry potter series
ninjkn
"I deserve a coffee break" I was totally expecting a Trade Coffee ad.
Abominations are the best kind of crafts
1:16 behind the camera whispering thats what she said :)))
why ?
I saw 12,000 pages and instantly knew the series😂
The Grand Bible by Lord Hennfield is a nearly complete book of world holy scriptures. It's over 5,000 pages. I'd love to have a copy of that printed and bound with the missing holy scriptures added in.
oh i’m so glad i found this channel, i love bookbinding
Ahem... now you have to make one for Mr. Jordan.
Astonishing. At each step I thought, nicely done. Then you did another massive thing. This is really stand out.
Best project ever!  There are giant paper cutting machines that could clean up the book edges. Try checking out a print shop if you get inclined to make another giant book.
what if you make a scaling mechanism underneath the book?  the heavier the one side is, the higher the opposite side rises up not like the book is gonna end up on a shelf or something give it it's own desk 😂
I would normally not support the destroying of book covers but she turns all of their projects into a masterpiece.
😂 Fantastic!  The only thing this is missing is Martina dressed as Belle, for the final reveal.
Juniper is mishandling the new merch, ordered a set of it 10 min after the mail dropped and in the final day they where suposed to ship it... sudenly my order is on backlog intill almos February 2024, this feel like a rip off when i bought it there was absolutely no mention of the backorder
3:35 Scaramouche spotted
somebody needs to make a compilation of how many time she says dragon/included a dragon in her videos. Great Job Martina!
Da book slinky!  Coming to a bookshelf near you!
That would take 12000 days with my current speed
I love the music in this video, where can I finde it?
😮❤😍🤩🥳
Ridiculous
So pretty
Are you planning to do this with other books as well? For example Star Wars?
you forgot to include several built in book marks but OMG THATS AMAZING!!
You call it the dumbest thing you ever made but that was epically  A W E S O M E🤩 If I could create half the things you have made half as well then I would still be a great creator. I love your videos. Such a joy and inspiration.
That's fantastic - when you said you were sending it to another Youtuber, Daniel Greene was the person who leapt to mind!
I don't go here to a stunning degree, but my friend is a bookbinder so I watched this the whole way through and sent it to them LMAO. I think inspiring this kind of tomfoolery is all any creator can wish for.
Now do this with the entire 20 something books out of the Percy Jackson series and all the connecting ones
Spongebob would be proud.
Love this so much!!❤ Well made!❤❤❤
Wow u are awesome talented
Somewhere in the future this book probably gave up and split into pieces and some crazy collector is trying to bring all the pieces together in a legendary adventure.
100% knew who you were sending this to.
You are amazing😊
I love your videos, you make such intresting and nice things. But I think it is very sad, that you use real leather. For leather animals die and suffer. Please stop.
This is nuts. Also the collector edition for the sketch books is sold out and im so upset i lost my chance to get it. Alas
Nerdforge you have done it again. That book is amazing I have never seen anything like it . Make another one and do a giveaway. We would love that ❤😂❤
Are you going to do this with Stormlight in 20 years?
This is so amazing! Also can't get over how cool the merch outfit looks?????
Was just about to order the sketchbook set since I always missed them Can't believe I missed it this time too.... Honestly devastated
Robert Jordan would approve
This is so freaking cool oh my god.
This book needs a custom stand that has two adjustable platforms that raise/lower with a single crank.  This way you can just crank the stand to move as you read the book and both sides of the book stay fully supported.
Love it 😂
Absolutely incredible. Excellence, wellest of done! We are now out of wells. Thanks. :)
Why, Martina, why?! 😁 -Martina: “Because i can.”- 😂 Well… that’s what i call light reading 😅
I love these absurd bookbinding projects
Every time she opened The Book: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
She built the inspector gadget manual
So, that's insane
Fun fact, there was not even a single dragon in the entire story.
This is the first video I’ve watched of hers and this is so rediculisly stupid that im subscribing and making my own😅
Wow insane! She's incredibly talented
Where have you been all my life this is content!!!!!❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Time to write down everything that men need to know about woman 😂😂😂
Hardcover when?
You should try to make a big one piece manga
WOW... Impressive.. , top marks.
book press wasn't big enough but still works as a book press.  Book Press: That job is beyond my normal capabilities, but i can find a way to manage.
جامد ، اول كتاب من سلسلة عجلة الزمن "عين العالم"  لسه مترجم مؤخرا
The end result is absolutely gorgeous! I love your energy throughout this video. This was such a fun time!
Can you do it with Harry Potter books?
This is first time I am watching this channel and your content... I'm from India and believe me I loved the content.... I'm gonna watch every video of this channel....there would be so much effort in this one video and I'm excited what will be in your other videos....plz subscribe this channel NOW!!
Wowweeeeeee... What a result! Love this... No good for reading in bed though 😂❤📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚
Just for future reference, if you ever need to trim books down to the same size like that, if you have a local printing company near you, they likely have a large cutting press, you might be able to get them to cut the books to the same size for you.  I worked at my father's company in the summer one year and used one.  They can enter the size needed and then trim all the books to the exact same size.   The one I used was able to cut 1000 sheets at once.
I want one so bad
The most epic cover for the most epic series… this is amazing
Wow, that’s incredible, very nice!
19:56 "Stop playing with yourself!" 😅😅
the start tho
Oh my stars!!! I am soooo tempted to do this to my Throne of Glass set!   Might base the spinework off the raze scene, where Aelin absolutely decimates the glass castle with her tremendous power, with dark trendles around the edges to represent Erawan's influence, the triple faced goddess pendant in the centre of the belt front and the wyrdstones belt back. Maybe silver and gold leaf, gold for Aelin and Ashrivers, silver for Rowan and the state of Terrasen.
I was expect at some time during the crafting process would equalize the pages between the former invididual books itself
I feel like you need to create a stand specifically for just reading this one book.  something that can be like a inverted V that the center point can slide from left to right so you can open and read the book.  maybe even has an index along the front so you can slide the mech to the book you want to open.
First time here and I am hooked. This has got to be one of the coolest things I have ever seen with one of my favourite sagas of all time! Amazing!
She made the Wheel of Time into a literal wheel. Utter madness, I love it.
i would love to give that book to my friend who dies when they break a book back
If it’s dumb and it works, it’s not dumb.
Missed opportunity to somehow bind the end to the front and make the whole thing a circle
Wow, I just finished wheel of Time and your book is amazing! Instant sub!
The way it bent made me think of folding phones and now i want to see an oled panel as a book front or spine
garth marenghi is quaking
You could have painted the paper too
At first, I thought this video was her creating a 12000 Pages sketchbook, and I was going to ask If She was going to also fill this in 12 days😂
Absolutely fantastic! Now you have to make proper table (with two - high adiustable - countertops) to read it :D New quest awaits you!
5:35 is- is it giving me the middle finger ...
This is friggin brilliant, well done, and what a fun idea
whenever I think you can't top a project, you always come back with another banger. This is SO cool!
This absolutely mind blowing! Such an incredibly epic project. It looks fantastic. Robert Jordan would be proud.
A flat pneumatic lift with a foot pedal and a lock sounds like the best way to read it. That or a hand dial. So the lift drops slowly so that you can turn pages, then you raise it to close the book or to flip back to reference something.  This is an incredible build. You should be extremely proud of yourself.
Page alignment did not exist until very recently anyways, so no biggie. On a similar note, can you imagine if the Historiographic works of multiple historians (like 10 of 15 books series) got the same treatment?
No book ever. Nerd forge book : https://youtu.be/wWsX1Ff9JVk?feature=shared  Thanks for this
yay i love the wheel of time !! such fun project haha
You smell very beautiful
I'm so jealous of Daniel. I want it too !!!
What are you like my new babysitter
Where are you woman I am hungry
Instead of hand tracing your design have you thought about using transfer paper? The same thing you would use for tattoos?
Yes, displate takes 20 seconds to mount (or at least 10 minutes if you follow the instructions) but it takes it again and again and again since the protective leaf does not stay on the wall even if you use more than the recommended amount of magnets.
Dont you scare, someone do like this for you, mad woman🧐 greeting from Türkiye. We love you🤨
to Nerdforge, you both cease to amaze me how you come up with the most bombastic of ideas and still not only are to deliver (somehow) but also are able to make a fun, entertaining video. Im sure speak for everyone here when I say: thank you. p.s. If you (and Hansi) like books and making you new books, I have made a custom scalemail book cover, if interested please dont hesitate to d.m.
Ahhhhh yessss the wheel of time❤️
This will be Winds of Winter when it finally releases..
What a huge amount of patience required to create a leather cover! Wow!
Missed oppotunity to turn the book into a wheel XD
once i saw EYE OF THE WORLD i knew d collection instanta
Not sure if it was intentional or not, but the neck of the dragon looks like a giant pile of books... which is very appropriate ;D
I guess trimming the whole thing flush just wouldn't have been feasible, would it?
The litterature teacher: we're doing a project and I'll need you all to read a book, don't worry, it's very short  The book:
For everyone who doesn't know "skjera bagera" means "how are you doing" :)
i kind of want to see this with Isaac Asimov, irobot, Robots, Empire, Foundation all loaded into a single book.
How to understand your spouse, Volume 1.... of 10
Do it again.
Dude that gold leaf just absolutely makes it!!! 😍❤️ I frickin love this absolute abomination of a book 😂😂❤️❤️ you've done so well with it!
I love fantasy as a genre but Jesus Christ man… the books of just about almost any series is just waaaaaay too long.
Why does it remind me of the book SpongeBob's grandma gave him after he said he was too mature and grown up for baby stories?
Wow! That is awsome! Love it!! ❤
She has the talent of a master and the excitement of a child and it is just a wonder to watch project after project. Thank you for being you.
If they printed that on ultra thin Bible paper, in a large Executive, US Letter, or A4 size format, but with the normal text size used in the prints you used for that, it _might_ be possible to get it down to around 1/4th to 1/8th of that thickness.  You would still be looking at a _massive_ 4 inch to 8 inch thick _tome,_  which _I_ think would be the _perfect_ format for this!  From there you could get some sort of pedestal or lectern to display it on, to complete the look!
What’s her accent?
This is my first time encountering this channel. I've decided it shan't be my last.   Also, congrats to TNF for being the first person who has ever stoked any interest in me whatsoever to go read The Wheel of Time series. I'm strictly a SciFi guy and lose patience with Fantasy easily, but TWoT might be something I could get into. It just went from disregard to strong consider in a single video. So yeah, congrats, nobody has ever convinced me to that degree on anything regarding Fantasy.
As a bookbinder, I spent most of the video quaking in fear and awe 😂
1:18 that's what she said
A book slinky is obviously a blinky. I feel like this needs to be a more frequent thing for long-running book series'.
I discovered your channel a half-hour ago.  Your work is truly stunning.
Instead of bookbinding should have made an endless scroll.
✌️📚✨️
Really love what you did with this one. Absolutely love the leather work and the design. Please keep it coming.
Okay you and Hansie laughing at the ridiculousness of this book had me rolling!!! 😂😂 This was So Cool!! I love when you do "Ridiculous" projects!! 🎉
Just have to say your new merch is freaking amazing ❤
i am the 1st time viewer  ok bt really liking the way you crave a  and your work really makes me keep watching
The talent and skills you showcase each time is just extraordinary. You are brilliant.
Your dedication is amazing. So much work and detail can only be executed in such precise detail with a fire of burning passion. Thank you for your hard work. Absolutely amazing work!!!!
Imagine after all that work, the order of the books is wrong 😂
Can you please do a sketchbook tour of all the paintings you’ve made over the years? I would LOVE to see that
What a waste of paper
Imagine if you glued the beginning to the end, you'd have a infinite book that would be an absolute pain to actually read xD
This was absolute perfection! And I LOVE this book series! What could have been better!?
She only has 9 fingers
My absolute favorite book series I have ever read
Do the same with LoTR and Harry Potter 😍🥰 Pretty Please?
your all good, there are versions of the tora (Jewish religious text) that is 4k pages all in one book. they used to be on scrolls but the 1st starter copys wore just all (5 books of the tora) together. Also the "yadar a collection of Viking legends" is 3k pages (14in x 15 inc) so it was an amazingly large book.
Please do a Christmas one
This needs its own reading table. It is awesome.
I have a question  The precuel is as the first book or is in the position of when it was published?
Wouldn’t it suck if you got the order mixed up on two of them?
I want Robert Jordan to see it! :(
This is utterly ridiculous. I love it.💜
You know what would also be really cool? If Nerdforge made an enlarged version of the book like from anime, so big it's the size of a young child sort-of-big, and sent it to the author!!!!!!
Hey @NerdForge I have a few books I am rather fond of that due to story length were divided into two or three parts. Would it be possible to send them to you for your special brand of magic?  Sincerely a YouTube Fan
I felt a very real physical pain when she cut those beautiful maps. But, then, you can't paint an omelett without cutting some books... or whatever the saying goes. Great work you guys!!!
1:18 "Yeah, that's not long enough"...."That's what she sa..." I caught that.
Very talented woman. Also, love the sense of humor. Who else caught the 'that's what she said' at 1:16 to 1:18 ?  👍
Just... like... wow. Wooooowww!!!
Those poor maps, oooo but think of all the cool spine artwork you could have. I kinda want to try this with the dragonlance books
Damn, i want one
Martina, ratchet clamps are a very common clamping method on wood-shops! 😊
that merch is fire <3
👍‼️👀
Officially the dumbest thing I’ve seen on the internet…..and I LOVE IT!!!!
I just started reading the wheel of time series because of my dad!
I love the chaos goblin vibe to all your videos lmao
You forgot to put in the dis- @0.22
She keeps saying it's dumb and I can't stop thinking how awesome it is.
Definitely not to be read in bed
Free palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
The uneven page side is killing me x.x
Now.... do The Shadow series by Maxwell Grant
I fucking knew it would be him!!!!!
I can't believe you didn't give Brandon Sanderson any respect on the cover for being co-author of the last 3 books. Disrespectful! He was chosen by Robert Jordan himself to finish the books. Come on.
Straight up, there was absolutely NO ONE who deserved this more than Daniel.
I wish there would sell it so. It would be so good looking in my bookcloset
Awesome hahaha the looove
The way he kept stroking it 😂🌸
❤❤❤ it's amazing 👏  goal 😍
When do you start taking commissioned orders?
Won't tge gold leaf break when the book bends?
Wow..  Just Wow…
That carving is a thing of beauty.
It looks like the first of many cliff notes, for volume 1 of "Understanding Women".
I look forward to every one of your vids, so wholesome and creative and awesome!
Project Idea: the book from Hogwarts Legacy. This would be amazing
You guys are friends with daniel! That's awesome. Im also pretty sure that you are the first binder to weave an endband this long
Is New Spring in there? I keep missing it from the lined up book shots.
Missed photo opportunity: making the whole book into a circle by bending it all the way around so the covers touch! Thematically appropriate for this series, that would be the ultimate flex!
11:11 in love with this background music 💜
Amazing, kinda dumb but really amazing! 😂
That is crazy. But what glue did you use to hold that together
Amazing job as always
Next: build a reading table to allow a normal person to read it!  Amazing stuff!
That monstrosity is ridiculous and unwieldy and excellent.
Martina that's not long enough whispers that's what she said 😂
Me printing all of my favourite fanfictions in 1 anthology
This is wonderful! Thank you, Martina!
Can you imagine gluing them in the wrong order? lol
How do you manage to do this😂 it's so good but so crazy
it IS historic tho! stranger books have been made in history... like atlases of 1000 lbs+ and a paper format of 2x2m's in the 17th century XD
Ooooo! You should do this with Terry Pratchett's Discworld next!
*BOOK SLINKY*  You are incredible! The ratcheting straps were such a brilliant solution.  Perhaps this is the video that has inspired me to revisit bookbinding. 😅   I love the contagious laughter throughout!
You're a WoT nerd too?!?!?!?!?! Just when I thought you couldn't get any cooler. lol What do you think about the show?
That merch is awesome
It's like the long furby in book form
It's a stuff with the story for sure! Literally stuff with the story by a number of means =) Fantastic job! Thanks for video!
We need a Sanderson reaction video
Dragon looks more like T-Rex 😂 But still, its fking amazing 😍
At this point, it’s not even a book
that looks absolutely amazing! I would LOVE to have that thing on my bookshelf! I envy Daniel for sure
This is so stupidly beautiful.
Awesome as usual.  Do you apply the dye seal before or after the gold leaf? Does the oil wreck the gold leafing at all?
Hi das war wahnsinnig cool all die Bücher zu einem einzigen zu machen. Hast du schonmal von forspocken gehört. Dort gibt es wunderschöne Landschaften, ein niedlichen Unterschlupf mit vielen Katzen, und interessanten Lampen. Wir uberlegen wie wir am besten eine dieser Lampen nachbauen denn die finden wir richtig toll.
What is the music you use while binding the books?  Edit: Had to use google voice search for crying out loud! It's "Bonnie Grace - The Goths" Seriously, what is it with getting youtubers to give the name of the songs they use?! If it's truly royalty free, why the hesitation?
2:11 "This is either madness or brilliance!" "It's remarkable how often those traits coincide."
I didnt know i could love you more but you read wot! Always good to see others who read all the series❤
i have to watch s2...
That's crazy.... I am not sure what to tell more...
That is so freaking epic! If you could have though, I would have had it clamped up as tight as you can get it, then plane the edges of the book sections flush so it looks more cohesive. Also it's a little weird that the box case is slightly larger than it by quite a bit. I thought it was going to be one of those snug fit things but I guess you also have the buckle to worry about. That backing is so epic though with the different stained leather and the gold leaf! I hope you put some kind of protective finish over it so it doesn't flake off. It kinda looked like you did but it was quick and I wasn't sure. You should definitely try to do something absolutely massive like this again but from scratch with blank pages, and then maybe hand write with calligraphy some long story. I know you did that huge book before but with the small front size and the extremely long spine it's just comical 😂
During my collage days we used to say 'if it's stupid, but it works, than it's not stupid' and I think this applies to this case
Now all we need is an extremely, extremely thin book, so you can recreate that one meme. The Book Goblin (me) requests it!
It exists many decades ago... its called phone book 🤣🤣
I’m here for 50% the music and 50% the content
Well done!!! This book has truly a magnificent number of pages!!! Lady, you probably know already that you're a authentic genius?
When Martina said it is the Wheel of Time, I was like, yeah, It's for Daniel.
This is your most well crated idiocy yet! 😂
My fav series ❤️❤️❤️
New Spring was missing?
Now do The Oeuvre by Garth Marenghi
Reading that in bed. X)
Clearly, there is no kill like overkill.
Fun fact: when Robert Jordan started work on what he intended to be the eleventh and final volume of the main series (i.e., not counting _New Spring_), he said that it didn't matter if it turned out to be two thousand pages, it'd be the last one. Unfortunately, he was already quite ill, which is why Brandon Sanderson wound up stepping in at Jordan's wife's request to complete the series in what turned out to be three volumes. So binding together the books co-written by Sanderson would, at least, be consistent with Jordan's intentions 😁.  (I personally checked out of the series after reading _Crossroads of Twilight_, and I doubt I'll ever go back to read the whole series — there's too much other fiction out there I haven't read that excites me way more — but I'm not going to yuck anyone's yum by talking about why here.)  EDIT: I hadn't watched all the way through when I wrote the above, so I didn't realize the recipient would bring this up too 😅. Glad to know that he also knew about this, though.
Hai Martina. Just for fun, can you add little fan to make your hair kinda look like blown by the wind from your 'fantasy window'? 😊❤
Did you know your creativity and fun is contagious? I love these videos.
Did you get the book to walk down the stairs? I’d love to see someone read that in bed…. You’re full of super ideas, love it
I love the wheel of time ❤️
Next project: I filled a 12,000 page sketchbook
Now you have to make a special stand so that he can read it without struggling (⁠^⁠^⁠)
You should do a projefct but you can only use your tattoos design
Have you ever tried working with vegan leather? Just wondering since you talked about the vegan/veg-tan difference. Your videos are amazing btw and I'm always so jealous of your skills! ☺️
XDDDD This is soooooo over the top and ridiculous and I LOVE it!!
It's a wonder, just think it may have been a wheel breaks me.
I immediately knew this would have to be for Daniel. :D
absolutely AMAZING, just one question: why didn't you sand the pages down to the same size? Thanks !
Day 1 of begging Martina to recreate one of my Sims 4 builds as a diorama 😅  Also, this is so freaking cool! I started watching the show a few months ago and then fell off but this made me want to start it again
I was sitting here the entire time like PLEASE DON'T MESS UP THE ORDER OF THE BOOKS!!! Cause I know I absolutely would have done that 😂😂
First when I saw all the books together I thought "Who needs this?" Then in the process, specially with the leather works I thought "I want this" :D It´s really awesome.  Your talent is always nice to watch. And I agree, seeing you reading at the end made me laugh too 😁
amazing !!!!
The amount of crafts you combine is crazy! just the carving alone for the cover is a masterpiece! kudos!
Very nice ❤ Would have been the perfect canvas for some edge painting, too!
Now you just need two little jacks with extremely high extension ratio so you can read it from first to last page.
Imagine on the metro train and you just pull that monstrosity out of a duffel bag and start reading it casually
It's amazing! you could also paint something on the cut of the pages, as was with Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings =D
Great effort🔥
still can't move on how GORGEOUS that fake window is lol
Mat would be proud.
"Stupid problems require stupid solutions" The literal quote of my parents while raising my dumb ass
Still good to carry in the back pack.
Imagine reading that book in bed and it drops on your face 👀
As awesome as this looks, imagine reading the book from beginning to end without a break. Word of advice, don't sit the book on your lap XD I can't imagine how your lap would feel after just an hour. Good work guys!
I'm known for falling asleep and hitting myself in the head when reading in bed... this book would be lethal!!
This is awesome, yet strange at the same time… Kinda reminds me of how JRR Tolkien actually wanted to release The Lord of the Rings as a single book, but his publisher decided to split the book into 3 books… Fantastic job!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️❤️
Yeah!  XDDDD
Why did I know it was Daniel Greene as soon as you said "wheel of time"?
Simply love your videos. When creativity and fun come together😅
I feel for the poor tree that gave up its life for this…. Lol amazing leatherwork :)
Couldnt help but wonder how much shipping costed for smt like that lol Must have been a fortune 😂
You should try a zigzag parting on your hair! I feel like it would look cool!!!
I'm on book four and so far it's been an amazing journey.
Well done.
Book slinky...blinky
B I B L E
This is beyond amazing. I can’t even believe what I’m looking at—including the box. I’m sure you could get a cool €10.000 if you wanted to endure the ass-pain of doing this again.  Truly amazing, guys!!
the most amazing part to me is how you do all of this without watching a movie or show or anything while you work!! 😭 in all your videos your focus amazes me
Yo skera bagra to you too!
challenging and amazing project, the result washed my eyes from inside to outside
You are so amazing and talented.
Actually, aside from the ridiculousness of this project, I think I would enjoy doing the entire process...
I do not know how she was able to send that to someone else if spent so much time and effort on something like that I would be heartbroken to give it to someone else but you did a great job and I love it ❤
Would have sanding the 14 books to size work?
Couldnt just shave the edges to all be the same size?
I would find the sewing part so satisfying. Also just playing with the monstrosity of a book slinky you've created!
She really dropped "I just photoshopped a thing and printed it out" super quickly and casually and it's the most high-fantasy, billion-hours-of-work-looking, *gorgeous* book insides. HOW???
at 20:13 i got a Grammarly add. 🤣🤣😂😂😆😆
Love the merch, but can't access it because my web advisor says it's suspicious.
Aww. Now I wanna see how all the other books series would look like on this one hahaha especially the harry Potter and twilight saga omg.
Just imagine if she misplaced one book in the wrong order... This was so awesome btw!!
Loved it..😂
i suggest taking sandpaper to the book page ends to try to even out the pages when closed.  I have also seen book binders use a small, very sharp,  plane used on the paper ends.  it looks very cool as is, just thought, since it annoyed you, you might look into these suggestions..
Hey odd idea.. But I noticed that a small torch and a little bit of not packing foam but like packing foam... Anyways you can use the torch to cut small pathways into it... I don't know if you use this method or not before but might be useful
I was so happy this went to Daniel Greene!  Incredible job!   Now you need to do the Cosmere when it's complete! 😂🎉
Love the result, I wish you had credited Brandon Sanderson also.
I see this and I think on that thing Shonnen Jump were doing I think like last year where it was "The entirety of One Piece up to the end of Wano Country in one collection."  Imagine they do something like this to Oda's full manga when the series finally ends in 5-ish years.
Amazing
The real gold leaf is supposed to be a lot more workable though, its supposed to "paint" on better like you were using with the paintbrush than the factory made fake stuff. Though any factory made gold leaf real or fake, is going to be FAR more brittle than hand-made gold leaf.
Okay that's just amazing on many, many levels. That said, I'm surprised she hasn't build a book planner yet.
She inspires me SO much to do all those thing I know are dumb to me but I love them, because she looked so happy while doing it :'3
Maybe it seems the dumbest idea but that book is a perfect 2 in 1: a beautiful masterpiece and you exercise your arms while reading it XD if you want 🤣 The art was mind blowing ALL THE TEXTURE!!!! I'm speechless Thank you Martina and everyone for giving all what you have! What a work of art! 😍
I've done some bookbinding, and it is my personal assessment that I have never seen so stupid a plan so brilliantly executed.
22:37 Daniel being Daniel is the best XD "And I hope he is" *dark laugh* 🤣🤣🤣 I was ready for som "my precious" moment XDDD
i have all of these books in paperback, should I just glue them together?
20:12 The fact that an ad just appeared RIGHT HERE! It felt like YouTube was against me by not wanting me to know!!! AGH!  AND IT WAS DANIEL!!!! I SCREAMED!!!! It had to be him AND I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT IT!!!! 😍✨✨
A scene painted on the pages would look super nice
You and I have something in common we both like to make the most outrageous prodjects you and I should team up for one would you be down for that
EPIC!!!
Amazing.
Make a lazy susan big enough to read the book
Looks like an operating manual for a woman.
This is equally one of the worst and best things I have ever seen 😂😂😂
So epic and awesome! It's perfect.
Imagine taking this out into public tho... XD Stranger: "What is that?" You: Oh, I'm just reading my book."
the level of detail is incredible. This is so cool! It would be awesome to get a reply, though you're probably busy. I love your videos and artwork so much, and it makes me want to do this kind of stuff too! If you know the Book series Eragon, It would be so cool if you could do this with that series! You could put the 4 main dragons on the cover, and maybe Brisingr, and Zar'roc swords as well! It would be so cool! I'd love to see you do more of this kind of stuff! Amazing! I can't say how much I love this stuff. Your style is amazing. Blessings!
Maybe for the next project you could update your clock, wich is always in the videos, like a fantasy clock or something ❤
Love your hair colours but it’s giving 13yr old finds colour… if you did a purple root into the pink then a pink root into the purple it would look so gorgeous and not look like a wig!
Incredible job.😮😮
Why wouldn’t you clamp the pressed pages with the boards to the table so you can make it tighter?
The horrible person deep down in my heart, wanted just one book to be the wrong way round.😂
Well Robert Jordan did say that he wanted the last book to be so big we would need a wheelbarrow to take it out of the bookstore...
I can't like this video enough...
Blood and Bloody Ashes! How much would this thing sell for?!
Amazing as always!
10/10, absolute troll project. Now you need to make a custom piece of furniture, an adjustable, 2-level table and something to be able to keep your page. Call it the... adjus...table
This was so joyful to watch thank you
That's What She Said 😅
Now do ACOTAR
I think she's finally lost it. All those years inhaling craft glue finally did her in lmao
What does Skjera Bagera mean?
Was watching this and thinking Daniel would love this and then you sent it to him 😍💕💗😂
Light bedtime reading.
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh! This is sooooo coooooool 😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
YOU DID THIS TO HARDCOVERS???
This is why the internet was invented. Thank you.
but why?
I wondered if it was going to be Daniel! Ha, ha!!!!
This is epic like SO FUCKING EPIC    The music make is sound like you going on a dangerous quest
I got to book 4 or 5, and it just seemed to drag on and on, so I never got to finishing it... Even with people hyping it up like crazy and I tried to force myself on, because my fav author(BrannySanny) finished the series... Maybe one day I'll manage to get back into it, but for now, time to continue watching past the first 30 seconds :D
This is so awesome! Now please do the same with the warhammer 40k Horus Heresy book series😃
what is the book series?
Absolute insanity extremely well executed! Love it!
This Books are made for walking...
Not me sitting here chanting in my head "please send it to Daniel Greene, please be Daniel Greene" even though I had no reason to believe that they are aware of each other... I squealed when the goblin himself actually appeared on screen!! 😂😂🤗 it couldn't have gone to anyone who would appreciate it more, I don't think. 😊 The project turned out exquisite, as always, and I am loving how you two are continuing to embrace the chaos and the ridiculous side-by-side with your immaculate talent and creativity! 😂 it makes for the best content yet!
Not the collab I was expecting but I LOVE IT
I was quite sure it would be Daniel. Very cool video. I don't think it will happen now, because there is no way of being as spectacular as this, but I'd love to see the Silmarillion get a similarly amazing cover.
I saw the thumbnail and said "I present to you, the guide to a womans mind... pt 1" lol.
As a crazy idea, you have surpassed yourself
Awesome, and multi-use too (you could read it, use it as furniture, a weapon. . .)
I've been a fan of both your and Daniel's channels for a while, and recently finished reading WoT, so this was really fun to see. Now that's a house warming gift!
sorry, cried a little when I saw you tearing that book set apart :( its such a great series. the end result was fantastic.
You should have contacted the U.S. Government Printing Office. They bind proposed 10,000 page Congressional bills all the time, literally overnight so that our congressmen & senators can read them the day before its formal vote on the floor!
23:37 Martina casualy reading a book. That was so good :-) amazing project!
Crazy and beautiful! The best combination, Martina you never disappoint!!
That is so amazing!  I must confess, my nightmare for this is to get it bound only to find out book 3 is upside down.
Wow awesome brilliant amazing astounding. I like the book as well.
That's interesting,can you do the same thing for Sarah j. Maas's throne of glass series? All 8 books including the assassin's blade novella?
You should try to get the world record 😂
This was unbelievably amazing. I’m at a loss for words. ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
what happens if another book gets added to the series
you are the reason  some times i feel alive and living
The easiest way to read this would be to use two adjustable pedestals to rest the ends on, and just crank them to the height that makes the slinky bend at the desired position.
I thought this would look really weird, but of course you've gone and made it look freakin amazing! I've never read wheel of time, and I don't think I will, but I find myself wishing I could own this ridiculous creation of yours. Also, I think it's actually helpful that the pages are slightly different sizes, makes it possible to differentiate the volumes! ...Should he ever.. actually attempt to read them
This is so awesome/funny! It turned out great!!! Wow!
💜
I think you could also have used xylene or acetone to transfer the ink straight to the leather. Awesome project though!
I just imagine reading THAT in bed ...
This binding makes my Brown Ajah heart so happy. It brought tears to my eyes.
How many pages is it in total?
okay, so that dragon is th coolest thing i've seen in a while, and also I NEED that jogger set. I know what I'm getting myself for christmas!
I start the day watching this video and now i know my monday/week will be good 🥹Thank you Martina!!!!!!!!
I only have one response to this masterpiece..  wot?
Track id @19:13?
i loooovee this soooo much but i want to kinda make you mad ny saying.....................MARTINA YOU FORGOT THE BOOKMARK!!!!!
What book series is this?
Eat your heart out, Yellow Pages
Love your insane book project 😁 but that kitchen looks crazy i love it spot on fallout4 post Apocalyptic 👏👏👏
Do you sell your artwork at all? I'd gladly buy either a print or digital version of that wheel of time art. Absolutely gorgeous
HEy martina, I think you should give a read to the Deverry series if you haven't read it already. it's a huge, long ass series (14 books and counting!) with NO plot holes, all based on reincarnation, celtic magic, fate, dragons, and more!
♥♥♥ Maybe its the name though :D my name is Martin and i also do art stuff, like dioramas, painting miniatures, drawing, writing a book (at the moment) and so on :D so....its cool to watch you work and its inspirational! Respect! ♥
This is RIDICULOUS and i LOVE IT, MAKE MORE OF THESE PLEASE
Martina.....you are such a capable person!!! You never fail to amaze me!!! And the level of skills you have...it's overwhelming! Great Job, keep up the awesome, epic content.
awesome vid!
Is that your house? Looks like a fantasy world I want to live.
Potential for also making a reading support for it. Like a car jack jackscrew or similar design potentially (but obivously with a design estethic that fits the book) that can be adjusted so one "half" of the book can rest on it for (relative) ease of reading.
The cut of after "hahaha yeah, that's not long enough. That's what sh—" comedy gold. So simple, yet so effective.
I have to ask, how much would it be to ask her to do a bookbinding, like on request? Four hundred dollars I'm gonna guess, for a full set.
"I will put the 'Fun' in 'Functional' by sacrificing the 'ctional' part" I love this. these are the best projects.
Omg, this is so cool! I just wish you'd sanded down the pages to make them all flush.
That is such an epic project! I love the finished result!  Not a book to be read on your lap though… maybe Martina needs to create an epic stupid book reading apparatus!
Lol youll need special tablets or fork lift type of thing to move this book.
Holy f word that is so awesome
Book slinky!!!!
Love WoT, this is amazing!
This is so awesome! Love the wheel of time & love the music you picked for the video
I want this monstrosity. It's gorgeous.
I would love to see the authors reaction to this 🥹
If you ever found yourself stuck in some medieval fantasy world you could make a living out of book binding and leather carving ;)
It pains me to see this done with the first edition hardcovers, but I love the project
"dont show this to any expert bookbinder" I bet no expert bookbinder ever even tried this monstrosity so its ok :D
Dude thats gonna be so super heavy
I'm printing the french version of WoT. I never imagine to see it in 1 book lol
Jepp, I guess Sanderson will be jealous of that XD
i love your new merch
5:45 Pfffffft... jut build a hydraulic system to lift or lower the front or end of the book to always have the right page on top.... Noobs....
OMG love it! Really feel that you have to do something similar with Sanderson’s Cosmere, otherwise there will be a war. Would love to see that as well! 😍
That's the most ridiculous amazing thing I've ever seen. I love it!
Jesus Christ, it's gamazing!😍😍  I want the same book on my shelves!
Question! Is it possible to tattoo the leather?? 'Cuz tattooed leather books sounds awesome
It really is beautiful, and watching you do it was grate. And it really is dumb 🤣
this sillest project yet and it was nice to see
Yeeeess! This is what I thought you were gonna do when you did the Harry Potters!
As soon as I saw the WoT I was hoping it would go to the goblin. This was just perfect
2:38 - but... I am a professional book binder!
Such an amazing project. You need to make a reading table for this book :D
Now I got to know can you or would you be willing to do the exact same thing, but with all of the Harry Potter books I just I have to know I just
next project: make a cantilevered book stand--or counter-weighted, perhaps ~
My friend, that's gonna be the hardest and weirdest thing to read
And now we need a lord of the rings one
Not surprised it was sent to Daniel.
day 1 of asking for mistborn book binding
T_T your merch were amazing! Oh God of Gold and Money bless me please so I can buy...
Why didn't you stitch the text blocks?
Martina: "Are you OK?" Book:
awesome cover! Whoever has this on there book shelf shoulf be smiling everyday looking at that.
real life meme of manual about how to satisfy a woman
i wonder how guests feel going into your house with all these things in it
This is all the embossing by hand??? I already felt bad at the sight!
Aww, no mention of Brandon Sanderson on the epic cover? We wouldn't have gotten the series completed without him. Absolutely amazing work by the way!
So, when you started out and had glued all the books together, I was thinking that this was just a crazy, stupid, silly idea.  And then you put the headbands on. And suddenly, it looked like a really professional job that was in progress.  And then you put the leather cover on. And the belt.  And you carved the leather cover.  And you stained the leather cover.  And you made the box.  Each time, you raised the level of crazy, stupid, silliness to a new height. But in a great way. A truly epic way.  I've never seen anything like this before, and I don't think I will ever see anything like it again.  🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇
Every megalong fantasy series should have zip-off covers that can zip together to do this.  And then a belted first and last cover to hold it all together.
Love the plates (displate's) but the white door is killing the aesthetic... plz give it a facelift!! 😢
me watching her slice through the original binding: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHATAREYOUDOINGYOUMONSTER! also me watching her make the new binding: ooooh! i love it! :3
This very much needs the page edge painting you tried a while ago, so much nice space to paint on
I think she is a little bit insane 😂 also persistentand crazy talented  Because I think I will abandoned the project in the middle of it 😂
Better than the Avengers
dumb projects are always fun to watch
This is so fantastic! I laughed so hard the entire time. Thanks for that!
I've thought about leather binding these, but not into ONE book😮😮
Hey leather workers, have you done this: for those lines of magic, what if she used UV reactive paint in them? 🤔
Completely ridiculous and fun all in one.  Glad Daniel liked the book.  It looked like you put a lot of hours into it.
I kind of wish you had sanded down the pages so they were flush, and maybe gold leafed / painted them, but I get why you didn't. What a MASSIVE amazing effort this was!
Lol! Finding out the clamp isn't long enough, "That's what ..." jumpcut :P . I am 12.
❤❤❤❤
*Watches this video.*  *Glances over at RPG bookcase.*  "Fifth Edition! You guys ready to retire in style?"
that mech is amazing ¬!
Missed a trick by not having the spine be the White Tower.
I've dreamed of this existing a now does! Wonderful!
It's awesome! 🎉💖
That's Crazy! and Amazing! it's Crazy AMAZING!!!
"dumb idea" that's why I'm here!
Robert Jordan would be proud of this!
I wish I could commission y'all for a book like that with all three of the Arrows of the Queen series of books by Mercedes Lackey.
You're not going to believe this. I accidentally let a professional book binder see this.
Did you watch 4 key book art. Lol, he did the same with his DnD manuals.  His was smaller, though. Lol. That was awesome.
진짜 너무 바보같지만 너무 멋진 프로젝트다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 괴짜 마법사의 마법서 같기도😂 Wheel of Time은 한국에서는 별로 유명하지 않은 작품인데 한번 읽어봐야겠어요
Things Martina doing for Memes 😂
Sick 🤍
i feel like the only thing martina and hansi havent done yet is blacksmithing. next thing you know, martina is gonna whip out a homemade replica of Anduril and be like hello everyone this was a crazy challenge
That was just so much fun to watch! And the outcome was perfection.
Brilliant!
Lmao I need my husband to put it on one end cause of the weight just so I could read it 😂
My favorite Book series
I don't think I even want to know how much this cost to ship (but i do want to know)
Martina...  I adore your videos.  I don't have to feel so bad for some of the crazy ideas I have, because I have ideas.  You have ideas...  Say "this is so stupid an idea" then go on to do it.  And fun is had by everyone!
What a FANTASTIC project!!
This is the most insanely awesome thing I have ever seen! I hope you actually read it again xxx
I was enjoying this one so much till you mentioned leather, and I had to stop. Even beautiful art is no excuse for animal abuse.
You gotta make a book stand so he can actually read it!
The REAL question is: can the spine bend like a complete circle (not just a slinky). That way, The Wheel of Time would be an actual wheel shape!
My brother loves this book so will make sure he sees this, great job.  p.s. love the Norrie toy !!
Is it ok to eat leather bc I just did?
A friend asked me to repair a cookbook of hers a while back. It was in two pieces, I have no training in repair, I only really know how to bind from scratch. To see someone else do basically what I did (just attached the spines together with the linen and pray) is delightful. (She so far hasn't told me it tore again so I count it as a win!
Displate for Magic The Gathering has ridiculously ugly pictures, otherwise I'd get them
Only one word I know to describe this project. EPIC! Well done!
Cool
she mentioned it and now i need to see a professional bookbinder react to this
Wow
SPLENDID MAESTRO
Please turn a book into a scroollllll
So sad the new hoodie is not for big people. This book is an abomination and I love it❤
That may be what my book is gonna look like 😅
People so talented they can draw, paint, carve, scultp, and build and pretty much do anything are so inspiring ❤
One suggestion is you could have used a very sharp bladed tool to slice the books all to the same size after assembly. I was thinking a sander might do the job but, no I think something sharp, maybe a small plane?
Hey Martina! After binding the world's largest book, I'd love to see you make a wizard costume to go with the countless tomes and potions you've made, one more elegant and robe-like!
"That's not long enough" *whispers* "That's what she said" 😂
when i first learned about the existence of the death note integral tome
This is so unhinged I love it
You guys crack me up lol.
have you read the sword of truth series?
I just realized I forgot to like the video yesterday! Error fixed.
OMG my second favorite book series of all time!  Btw have you read Jean M Auel's series Earth Children? Epic story. ❤
What an incredible gift!
L8vin wot too! Wonderfull project
This is perfection
muito bom, ficou bonito
Tai'shar Norway! This is absolutely amazing, and Brandon Sanderson isn't the only one jealous!
This is my first time looking this kinda video, and im kinda high  It looks like Magic what she does :o Great work really
I gotta read the Wheel of Time now!
Amazing work as always from my favorite creators.
I love the idea, I love the work, I LOVE YOU! Youre so creative and funny and your dumb ideas are the best dumb ideas EVER!
Incredible!!!! Every time you manage to overcome the limits of your imagination and obtain masterpieces!!! Martina and Hansi you are the greatest!!!!!
7:47 that was a great transition, Martina.
This is being sent to the hydraulic press channel 😂😂
The hell substances did you smoke when you had this idea? I fucking love it XD  But honestly, this is absolutely beautyful
I haven't even started this yet barely, I had to pause to say, AMAZING CHOICE OF BOOK  OHH OKAY, someone send this to Sanderson :O
What else can I say? It's both hilariously insane and totally brilliant at the same time.
Only annoying about this book is the pages not being flush to size...
Now I'm fantasizing what a @Nerdforge model of the island of Tar Valon would look like...🤩🤯🥰 I bet Martina could make the most amazing Ogier stonework buildings, shining powerwrought walls of The White Tower, the city docks, and bridges arching across the river to the bridge towns at their foots..... That truly would a sight to see!!!😍😍😍🏰
Your damn scientists were so preoccupied by whether they could do it that they didn't stop to think if they should.
This is so amazing. I really love about everything you make.
Can you expand the selection of sizes for your pants?  Right now, your longest pants have an inseam of 31 inches, and I'm not even going to take the chance on those.  I am 204 cm tall (6'8") and believe I need an inseam of around 102 cm (40 inches).  I really like your merch, but it doesn't even come close to being the right size for me. I know it's a tall ask (XD), but I would really appreciate an expansion in the size chart.  Also love the vids, keep em coming <3
You could have possibly used a Book Plane to shave those pages into alignment with each other.  3 (4) keys bookbinding does a LOT of planing when making his books.
...mother of books....
This way you can exercise while reading XD  When you showed the book before adding the stain I was already looking at it as if it was the final result and I just thought "This is going to get better now"
Wow!!!!!!! I never expected this collab!!!!!!!!! Goblin army rise up!!!!!!
Amazing
It looks like something from a doctor Sues book! I love it! ❤
Mildly disappointed you didn't bind the ends together to make a... Wheel of wheel of time
Ach das ist gar kein Mikrofon 😯
This is the definition of a stupid idea executed in stunning beautiful perfection! Great work
I aspire to own things that are this stunningly beautiful and hilariously impractical
Your work is mind-blowing fantastic! I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time and I am sure, your copy will eventually end up in the white tower in the book shelves of a brown sister. It just has to! I just read all the books on my e-reader and am surprised at how huge the story is. Keep doing these silly things! Love your work!
Am I dreaming???? What a crossover, and what an amazing design!
You are an amazing artist Martina  ❤❤❤
it makes me really happy knowing that Brander Sanderson is totally capable of seeing this and getting, in fact, super jealous
can someone explain what is skjera bagera? it is alittle similar to somethin in my language. What is it about
well shit they look amazing and I have just found my next thing to do with my life
Imagion you see someone, who sitting in the Buss or the train and read that Book…
Which would take longer: reading the whole series from start to finish, or making this Special Edition? Super fun! Thanks for sharing!
i adore that hoodie sooooo much
Oh my gosh Martina! bro
Does the nerdforge store work for everyone? I can't get tp the store page, I get a notice telling me it isn't safe
Very nice to see Hansi also working with the Lether^^
ITS A BLINKY !!!!!
IT'S A BOOK SLINKY!!!!
Looks amazing. Great work. Personally I would have chosen to send it to either sanderson, shad, or disparu but oh well. Amazing work, now I want more than ever to get into book binding and leatherwork.
Oh, it's Robert Jordan!!!!
this is the most epic and glorious thing ive ever seen. bravo!
This is EPIC! and by far the most wacky project this far [yes, even more than your brothers car] 🤣
Name for tablet please
In fifteen years, you’ll have to do the Stormlight Archive.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
You guys are just so crazy, it is absolutely amazing xD
That's not what she said? 🤣
Do Discworld next!
haven't read the books yet but seen the series.  Super cool.
This project wasn’t stupid it is absolutely epic and I love it so much.  Great job!
My uni library has book scanners, that have a table that levels out the top pages, no matter how big the book and where you open it. I think it's kind of like a scale, where the heavier side of the book pushes the other side of the split table up enough to support the lighter side until the open pages are level. Maybe you can design a table like that for this monstrosity.
this is so dumb.... I wanna make one too xD
u r such a great person u make the stupid ideas ( not really)come true ❤
I'm always fascinated by how you keep doing what you're focusing on for long periods of time. I mean i can't concentrate on anything for more than 10 minutes...
I’m curious if you’ll drop the purple sketchbook as a separate item (since I have the green and blue ones already)? I am still going to get the collectors set, because your sketchbooks have been the only ones I’ve actually ever used that I’ve purchased and I LOVE them so much!!! So I’m happy to get another set, and shipping to Canada just hurts on its own. Lol. Also, your cutting mats are the only ones I use, I hope you’ll drop an even BIGGER size in the future. You’re seriously the only YouTuber I follow that I EVER buy merch from. 💕💕💕💕
What is that? It's your Encantus!
i imagine someone seeing this on a shelf and being like oh cool art and them having to explain it’s actually a book
Lol. Imagine trying to read it on the train...
Awesome project.
Amazing, it's just so long (that's what she said) and killer artwork like always.  I actually find using whetstones really great for smoothing the sides of pages, I've done it with many of my books and the results are so satisfyingly smooth!
hey why did you take my anthology book?
Now you just need to contruct a (possibly ornate) custom lectern in order to read massive books, which has 2 sides of independently adjustable height to allow for turning the pages and a support to keep the book in place while it is angles slightly toward the reader.
I wonder if it would be possible to do with the Warriors series by Erin Hunter, it has near 50 books now right?
I like how The Wheel Of Time can now be used as an actual wheel.
Petition to have this as an audiobook by Daniel Greene, while he’s reading from this monstrosity, including all his struggles with opening, setting up supports etc. 🤩
Book + slinky = Blinky!
it looks amazing 🌻
Glue The book in a tube and make the book in a weel
That carving was amazing!
Currently rereading this series because trying to rid that awful show from my mind!
Can you do this with the Harry Potter books please!
The most impractical book ever:
When you recognize the covers two seconds in…
I love that you’re also Norwegian!❤
This was one of my many favourites love the video
..... cryptic hoodie size M already taken :( Hope there will be a restock
My brain just absolutely loves making horrible scenarios. Imagine spending all that time making this and realizing only AFTER it is shipped out that the books were out of order. That would be pure horror. Also I died so many times watching this laughing so now my throat hurts even more. Curse the sick. I LOVE THE CHAOS.
@Nerdforge did you seal the finished dye job on the leather? I always hold my breath when you leather craft on the items itself as I find it already hard to do on a marble slab 😅😊
I absolutely love your videos, you are so talented and your enthusiasm is infectious. I feel so inspired by your projects! I can't wait to see what you do next. I also very exited as I just ordered your new hoodie/joggers set, so excited for it to arrive!!!!!❤
Love this. Finding out it’s what the author wanted is hilarious.  Also i have never been more jealous of people who have money. The sweater and joggers give me life ✨
If I had the tools and know-how, I would absolutely make a reading pedestal for that monstrosity that allows you to adjust the height independently on each side to accommodate the changing thickness as you go through the series. It probably wouldn't be too difficult at a basic level, just have a couple platforms with a giant screw that you could adjust a nut around to change the height on each side, and some simple mechanics to synchronize the two sides so you wouldn't have to do each side one at a time. As a side note, I'd love to see your impressions on that new vegan cactus leather some companies are making, I got some off Amazon pretty cheap, but it's only like 2 square feet, or 1800 square centimeters, so there's not too much I could do with it.
It's funny. It's just funny, you can do anything, it's fine, nobody is harmed even though it's an abomination of a book. It's art. It's expression of your ideas. There is craft, invention, and precision involved, you did your best, and it turned out great.  In practice 19th century people often bound magazines in ridiculously wide convolutes. I don't work with periodicals, but we have a bunch of these bound journals which at times are thicker than they are tall. It's cheaper to order such a thick boi from your bookbinder than to have each individual issue bound, or even a few issues bound together. Just take one year and shove it under one single cover, yes...  I'm a librarian (in a ginormous library) with, like 1,5 out of 10 level actual skill in bookbinding, restoration, conservation etc. (And knowledge level maybe 6 or above about these things, I'm more of a reader/writer than doer).
I know how to properly read this book: you open it circularly on a spinning platter and read all the books in one sitting.
And you just did the to be nice?? Yeah you’re rad as fuck
"If it breaks, I'll send you some glue or something." I mean, the original versions all needed glue, so us WoT fans aren't strangers to that anyways :)
I would 100% buy the _Wheel of Time One Book Edition_ *stares at Torbooks
You had me at skjera bagera
This is so fucking incredible
Daniel Green is amazing. Couldn't have gone to a better person.
14 books? Why no "New Spring"?
Fallout kitchen ohhh my that is soooo cool
5:13 - 5:23 I just adore the wheezing laughter!
Martina kıyafetlerinin benzerinden saddle yapıp merch lesene =)
Honestly this is most fascinating video I’ve watched in weekds
I'm glad nobody was hurt making that monster. A nice blend of your skill set to get it done.
I'm inspired by your projects. My favorite so far is your rogue assassin armour oh and the dog armor really nice
You should definitely do this for warriors, but I guess it would be hard cause they’re still making them lol, maybe just the fireheart arc
This is an utterly ridiculous masterpiece and I love it! 💜
Disappointing, it would require at least twice the number of volumes to create an actual wheel.
Whoa your work area looks like a dream room
Why did you not trim the pages to all match?
Why not make it look like it's one book?
Thank you for not claiming you have OCD because the raggedy edge bugged you! Oh and yes, I laughed out loud at "that's what she s" Making up for Hansi's absence eh? 😂
If it´s stupid but it works, then it´s not stupid. If The Wheel of Time is one of your favorite series then I would recommend The Belgariad, The Incarnations of Immortality, and the Xanth series.
This is so incredibly amazing and ridiculous! I love the final result so much it's beautiful and badass and requires a wheelbarrow to be carried; in short it's perfect! (and also a librarian's nightmare but that's just me not being able to shut off the professional part of my brain)
your accent has changed so much, it's funny how it's less pronounced than before
Click. If you know you know
Would you do this with other series? Like HP (the 7 books), Wings of Fire, A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones), maybe The Discworld Series… Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia seem too small to be this type of impressive.
I'm not book nerd but I love a good dumb project truely a masterpieces
Okey this was really cool.. now do DISCWORLD. I DARE YOU
his hom is like a CAVİN
I just want to see brandon sandersons reaction to this book
ıts so beutiful and FUNNY‼🤣🤣😂😂
this is so much GOLD    ARE YOU KRAEZY😾😾😾❤‍🔥💥👑📀🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙💴💴💵💵💵💶💶💶💷💷💸💸💸💳💳❌❌
Beautiful work.
When the Stormlight Archive is complete I hope you give that series the same treatment and send the single volume to Sanderson himself.
my dad is crazy about the wheel of time so i had to show my dad and he was impressed :)
I saw the thumbnail and immediately knew it was the Wheel of Time. I have a love/hate relationship with this series. After rereading it too many times I have stopped finding new good things in it, and the bad just stand out too much. Reading it now makes me angry.
Now we need some furniture YouTuber to create a support - cradle for it, as balanced plates, so it can be read. Similar to book-wheels of olden
The manual to women has got to be even longer.
Imagine if the cover is very great with little detail and the content of the book is mid, Or math formula with theory and unresolve hypotesis.
I have a suggestion for a video! You have that clock feature in most of your timelapses, I think it's time (pun intended) to make it on brand
Oh lol she made it seem like it would go to a fan of her page Either way- this is amazing work
I litteraly cannot find the whole box set even used at a reasonable price and you just made that haha
And that's just the manpages for one UNIX version.
Now imagine she had painted the sides of the pages with something.
As soon as I read the title I knew it was your WoT books!!! So excited!
This is such a coincidence, i just began reading this series and i saw your video!! Love it!
That was really awesome
Some one tag Robert jordan
Next do the 32 volume 2010 Encyclopedia Britannica.
Am I the only one who thinks that Martina's at her best, and funniest, when she takes on projects that immediately makes her regret her life choices? 🤣
when i saw the thumbnail i was like "what even is that long?" soon as the vid started and i saw those covers.. yeah, that checks out.
It would be cool if you did some wallpapers / lockscreens for phones and computers 😁✨
The level of creativity you both have is truly amazing! I never know what to expect when I press play on one of your videos but it's always worth watching until the end! The music in the background is perfect keeps me watching! Great job as always!
NOT THE PLUSHY 😭 IT'S SO PRECIOUS!!
As silly as this might sound, I think this is my favorite book you've made! I love all of them, but the ridiculousness of this one is just so magnificent! This on the giant one or my absolute favorites besides the metal one. I NEED something like this on a bookshelf for my bedroom... I could probably bind all four parts of the book im writing right now! All 1400 pages of it! Hmmm... Maybe its time to learn book binding, after all!
I have read Wheel of Time several times and I truly love that world that Jordan created. This is one of the most insane things I have ever seen......and I want one. Really amazingly dumb......still want one
A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. 😱
It looks AMAZING!!!
This is obscene I love it XD
As a big WoT fan, this is EVERYTHING  It's crazy, it's impractical, and Daniel is 100% correct, it's everything Robert Jordan wanted ❤
during the video i was thinking about how much daniel would like this haha, awesome
EPIC!
I want my Harry Potter and Stormlight Archives bound like this!!
16:13 LOL the way she looks so scared
Man, It thought you were making that women handbook from the memes
i love this and an idea for a new video do the same thing but than with harry potter
2:36. Sorry too late. And I would have glued them two and two instead.
And I love it
I am very impressed in your work, wish you all the best ❤❤❤❤❤
at first i read "a 12000page animation" x)
Once Sanderson is done with The Stormlight Archive I want those in one book for him. All 10 of them
I see you have been raiding Skinnloven. Good stuff!
Hey, I like Wheel of Time too. :3  robert jordan was a master of his craft and I'm sad to know he's gone, but I'm glad his son took up the mantle. however....i don't know anything about that live action adaptation >_>' Oh also, bookcrafting was one of my passions for a while XD
This is amazing, I had Daniel in the back of my mind the whole time, but was a cool and random collab. The leatherwork is just incredible, really well done as usual.
ME: *has SEEENNN the omnibus things authors do* ALSO ME: *is watching this AMAZING!! video by Martina* AHAHAHAHAHA!!! xD MY BRAIN: 🤯 DOES THIS MEAN… IT IS THE ULTIMATE MANY BOOKS IN 1?!?! >;0 BETTER THOSE OMNIBUS BOOK THINGIES!!!??? D:< MIND BLOWNNN!!!  ….I DARE MARTINA TO MAKE A GIANT BOOK OF HER FAVE COMIC OR SOMETHING!!! >:D I went to this bookstore & it was a time where they had this GIANT book!! 😭 it was soooo HUGE, I think it was an artist’s book?? 🤔 I found out in the middle of writing this!! xD  DAVID HOCKNEY HAD A SUMO BOOK!! >:D I hadda go scrolling on Foyles bookstore’s bloody Instagram account hahahaha!! 🤣🤣😂😂😭😭😭 It’s a BIIIG book!! :3 ANDD since you loveeee doing weird wild things— I thiiiink this would be a hilarious & frustrating book to make!! >:D ahahahahaaha!!!
The Patreon donator scroll in the middle instead of the end is nice. I was thrown off at first, thinking the video was over. Expected another ending ruined by credits, instead it was just a nice thanks to supporters and then on to the rest of the video.
Insane
As she said herself, it's a stupid idea but it just looks awesome.
I remember Jordan one day promising us the last book will be just one book, even if it needs to be delivered to people's homes with a forklift. He most likely made a whole other separate quote about the wheelbarrow, I need to hunt it down.
Ah yes gone are the days where I have to get off my throne and grab the second book in a series
"Stupid projects require stupid solutions".  If it looks stupid and it works, it's not stupid XD This is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen and now I want to learn how to redo the bindings of my most cherished books you're so awesome!
That is incredible!! She is so talented it completely blows my mind!! That carving is insane!!
God forbid you lose your place
If one person could do this its Martina Sjera Bagera
hi nerdforge i may not be the biggest fan and i havent been here for long but the stuff ive seen from you is just incredible! as a polygraphy/graphic design student i recognise some of the methods/machines you use, like binding the books together or the paper cutter and how you design boxes or covers, so ive been meaning to ask, did you also go to a similar school or are you just a great hobbyist? what inspired you to get into it? either way its amazing you share them to everyone here on youtube, its very nicely explained and i believe it inspires others to try as well, like im very excited to try cosplaying based on your videos!
I already watched this video yesterday but I'm watching it again because what the hell is that 😂❤
As someone who dabbles in bookbinding AND dumb ideas I fully love the chaos. (I only think I would have sanded all the edges to be the same height)
i read the titlae and sore the vido picture and was like matrina what have you done! also i know but everytime you cut up a book i almost start screaming. :)
This was amazing... But even just seeing a clip of the "Weaving" from amazons attrocity made me want to pull my eyes out lmfao
1:18 thats what she said
Nerforge made Robert Jordan's dream come true 🥺
Reminded me of the muppet dance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-kDtgtF9qU
HEY MAKE A READING LIFT FOR YOUR BOOK!
I was hoping that the edge of the pages was going to be painted too. Maybe to depict which book is where with each having a unique design....maybe next time...which I'm sure there will be next time. ❤
This is so cool. The only thing I would have liked more was, if the edges of the books were smooth(probably by using a belt sander or table saw). But really an impressive work❤
"i dont like craking the spine of my books"  The book :
Аж прочитать захотелось
That is hilarious! You would need another book series in order to read that book series! Great job, you two! And I love the plush! So cute! This video was a great way to start my day. Especially watching you lose it over the Slinky Book! Can't wait to see what you come up with next!
I saw a fan account on tiktok and made my way to the Op page on here. Thankfully I noticed it was a fan account so I could find the YouTube channel.
The merch needs more pockets
I was watching thinking of Daniel Greene and when it turned out it was I SCREAMED 😂 what an amazing mashup, love both channels ❤
Oh Martina, what have you done?!   You created a monster.
Damn I really need to read this series already.
This is awesome
This is amazing, but also, I was hoping now that the canvas is so big- you could paint on the edges!!! Missed opportunity!
Anyone know the song used while they were carving the leather? ^^
This is amazing! 😂
Perfect for reading in bed! Slinky book…
I recall seeing a paperback computer book, perfect bound, with nearly 2000 pages. I thought that was pretty much the limit of that technology. What you've done is reach into the far future, gotten the final volumes of A Song of Ice and Fire, and bound all eight volumes into one book.Bravo!
The spine art is gorgeous. Love it!
cool slinky lol
I would love to see for the holidays a Santa workshop build.  And I mean an EPIC build. A big castle. Smaller workshops. Reindeer house. Maybe a portal that the big guy uses to travel in and out of for efficient gift delivery. Monster watch tower. You could make this AMAZING!!
Epoch, oh I mean EPIC!!!
You Ma'am are absolute mad lass, in best way of course.
A Daniel Greene and Nerd Forge collab?!
Impressive work! You need alot of skill to do a project like this. Well done. Looking forward to next project.
Monster edition 😆😆😆
11:48 that is so cool!!
That is so over the top, but yet so you. You are amazingly talented.
Not an abomination — an absolute work of art!
I, ah, may have passed this on to some friends at Tor who worked with Mr. Jordan and his editor, I *strongly* suspect they will get a kick out of it. This is gorgeous and also I need that hoodie
Now do Disc World
OMG! As soon as you said Wheel of Time I KNEW it had to be for Daniel 😆!!
I was hoping you'll send it to someone that does really awesome edge painting
Literal book binding!
9:24 is it made from vegans?
🤯❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍👏👏👏👏👏👏
I need a playlist of all the songs in her videos 😩
You did this book series justice and maybe Amazon should take a page out of your book or possibly read one of them 😅
woow nice HUUUUUUUUGE book.
I love your bookbinding videos. That what brought me to your channel 🥰
I was taking a break from working with the audiobook of tWoT in my ears...  And found myself watching this video... The wheel weaves as the wheel wills... 😂
I think you should use coffie to color this white pages
I feel like something you missed with this was to add a very very long piece of ribbon to the book as a bookmark, lol. But thats just a tiny little thing as this was super amazing to watch and crazy cool.
Incredible work, and I’m glad Daniel Greene was the recipient. Perfect choice.   However, and please don't take this as criticism or elitism or completionist bullshit because it's really not, but was there a reason why the prequel, New Spring, was not included? Just curious.
i was so excited for the joggers !but theyre just a tad more expensive that  i thaught they were going to be ; - ;
perfection!!!
Haha such a cool project, love to see you work with leather! Hope your hand is ok!
❤❤❤
Martina: Don't show this to any book-binder. Also Martina: Posts this video on the internet.                                                 --- Nerdforge 2023. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely awesome! :D You guys are great!
Man, this whole vídeo made me so happy 😂😂😂
I can imagine this being in a fantasy library on a set of scales, where the scales change weight as the book is read
Martina! Holy shirt that's amazing!
2:38 I think you are the only professional Bookbinder, most of us know😂 love your videos you’re the best❤😊
Hello Martina I just rewatched your video about your  little finger missing and your amazing cyborg prosthesis its also amazing how confedint you talk about it , and I think I had a cool video idea what if you  would build a add ons with a little engin so it could be a screw driver or a little mixer for your drink or another add on with a knife and so many possibly cosplays.
Damn, I wish I could afford the supplies to do this with Michael Moorcock's Elric Saga 😍
I am a 64 year old woman from the states, watching your videos. and I LOVE Every one of them!! You have such creative Ideas and make the most outlandish things!  I don't understand half of what you do, but you are so entertaining to watch!  Keep up the fantastic work! I look forward to seeing more!!
I am not a bookguy, but damn, even I am jealous!
I am the evil uncle that would send a child to a bookshelf to "fetch me the book down" for story time if I had a book this size.
4:53 your book slinky has been diagnosed with scoliosis :(
You could of cut the sides so that they would all align.
This book reminds me of the pages I have to read til the next english test😢
the set looks amazing, the window is so cool
Thank you for once again giving me ideas for my D&D campaign to terrorize my players with.
A librarian's nightmare.
This is SO GREAT and also not very surprising to hear that Martina ended up making someone's dream come true
I’m gal glad I got the sketchbooks!!!
Robert Jordan would be so proud.
Wow, again a great project done amazingly well! By the way your merch looks fantasic, thats the first matching set of clothing I have ever thought looked good together.
Thats why in ancient times they had much bigger book formats than today (and reading tables). I'd be interested in a half meter square format (1m x 0,5 m or in medieval units 39 by 19.5 inches)
should have done a different color headband for each book... :D
I wasn't expecting WoT video by you but oh well, The wheel weaves as the wheel wills
The end result is spectacular but, you taking the books apart REALLY hurt my heart.  Even more than when you did the LOTR.   Which also turned out spectacular.
That is so epic! I love your videos, so inspiring and educational. Thank you for your videos.
This is how it feels to be forced into reading a book you don't like for class.
Oh my god I'm glad you're insane enough to do wild shit like this. It's fucking amazing.  Also, maybe someone should make a reading contraption for it with two movable height platforms. Like two opposite elevators.
ngl...this merch is probably one of the best looking ive ever seen!  kind of intrigued to buy a set for me
She is so dedicated to each project and she so attuned to magic as a witch I really like her work🧙🏻‍♂️🌜🌝🌛⭐️⚡️🌪✨🔥🌧
I worked with machines that could cut stacks of 1000 papers all to the perfect size.. Maybe next time look up a printing company for help with that.
I want your house
This is so incredible :)
I love it when you do something with books🥰
Still not enough for all my sins.
I have a request, can you pls make the guru guru instrument from zelda ocarina of time ? (in a fantasy way of course), who can play real music, it's could be cool too see it
I love these kinds of videos. We were you taking a book series and making it into one big book.
I don't know how you always do it, but again, this is sooooo cool. And Daniel's reaction was so honestly geeking out. Awesome!!! I'm always in awe how you push through these incredible big projects. The amount of patience required is huge! You two are amazing
Book slinky!
The work of a bored genius is still entertaining
Love this so much 😂 I think it would be really cool if you did a Baldur’s Gate 3 inspired project, seems really up your alley!
now to make a table that would have adjustable sides to accommodate the change in heights as you read through the book
It looks incredible. 🔥
I do enjoy watching these videos.  Not just because I like bookbinding (not that I can do it myself, but it makes me ambitious), but because I love the bubbly energy behind the craziness.  I wondered if you were going to attempt to trim the page edges to get that all smooth, but would have no idea how.  The "slinky" bit reminded me of a book technique I've seen where the page edges themselves are gilt, so solid gold, but when you bend them slightly, a "fore edge" underpainting becomes visible (not sure I'm explaining this correctly.  Now, to check out some of that merch...
How did you guys start with a DIY mini fridge and end up in this project?
I love how uninged and wholesome this video was, thank you for the great work you put out there
You got a lot of skillz and patience
Do a drawing on book like you gave a lot of canva
Honestly, it was kind of a no-brainer who the mystery youtuber was gonna be 😆
I want a video of the youtuber reading this book.
I love you’re content and I have a question. Which kind of leather do you use for armor? Because I’m thinking of making Mandalorian armor out of leather and have absolutely no idea what leather to use.
Wow that's so cool and crazy 🤣 I would love to see you make a book nook! ❤
17:20 I laughed out loud there 😂
You should try to do one of all the works of Tolkien. In order of the general timeline. That would be epic.
Totally impractical, and totally freaking awesome.
Absolutely great job! Just one thing...maybe once all the books were glued together and while they were squeezed it would have been good to use a wood bench planer to grind and smooth all the pages together just enough to bring it all at the same level...But anyway it looks amazing!!!
What if they bring out a other book of the Weel of time  😂😂
Not sure if you're a steampunk fan, but have you considered making a book that uses a clockwork locking mechanism built into the cover?
Unbelievable work!! I feel like this book needs it's own reading table contraption that's part balance and part pulleys or gears. Maybe with a crank handle to lower and raise the sides while reading?
you've already got the skill of a 40+ year old professional artist and you're not even 30... that's impressive ngl
I absolutely love it. he is also one of my favorite writers besides Robin Hobb and Weis and Hickman. but this is beautiful. what is that lovely fantasy music at 2:50 I want it in my playlist.
How much did it end up weighing? It looked really heavy.
I think you should've binded those books on a wheel, so it would fit to the title.
here me out... a book donut where every book is bound together including the first and last connected to each other.
I thought it was going to be Daniel from the start! It is massive and I love the design👏
What is the music at 16:00 during the staining
Hi guys! I wanted to thank you for the video and say that I caught myself thinking that while watching your video I have the opportunity to move for a short time to some other and better world) just like when you read a book!
Next "stupid" idea..... The Legend of Drizzt?? It's only 39 books long.
The laughs at 5:15 is so contagious.
Wow the hoodie and the pants looks amazing!!
The amount of care and effort put into even these dumb projects is why I love nerdforge so much :D
As always a beautiful result.
Could you make an actual wheel for the book to wrap around, connect the front and back cover together so that it could be read by turning a handle? That would be a neat follow up project :D Fantastic work as always.
Oh noes, you read Robert Jordan's Wheel of time! So did I and it was a tough one. So inteeeerrrrmmmiiinnnabbbllllyyyy long that I basically gave up two books short of the end, also because Robert Jordan gave up 2 books short of the end. And then the story was wrapped up by another writer who was speedy and to the point.  If Wheel of time would have been made visual in the way you just did I would have known straight away there was going to be a problem.  And just to show I am no slouch when I comes to reading, I own all of Terry Pratchett's books and I re-read them every few years. It's a lot more than 12.000 pages but despite being all fantasy they feel very real. Also full of interesting ideas for you to do something with. Build The Tower of Art, or dress up in a wizards costume, or be worlds most powerful witch. Don't try Unseen University, you can't see it ;-)
It's phenomenal! Loved the painting but also LOVED it unpainted...is that allowed? 😅❤
It's funny, I clicked on this video as something to watch while I design a wheel of time inspired tattoos. Maybe I'll find some more inspiration here too!
If the straps work, it ain't stupid. Be proud of your creative solution. :D
Ridiculously entertaining
Jeez, this makes me want to do someting like this for my Sword of Thruth collection !
Hey ! your hoodie is really cool, can I buy it if I live in France?
Sending this off with DHL is the hardest part I think. Dropkicks Happen Lots loses and destroys your packages
Magic system, in France, is a music group 😆 when you said it looks like magic system, I couldn't imagine something else than this music group 😆
Äntligen släppte ni mershen, har köpt setet och räknar ner dagarna 😃 Älskar designen! 😍
I need more stupid projects like this, hilarious 😂
You should do Eragon next to celebrate the release of the new book !!
In simple words, “You are amazing”.
reminds me of the meme: manual for how women work 🤣
Imagine going to library and borrowing this book
@Nerdforge great video and we love the stuff you create but im not going to hide my sadness at the point that you did not show the finnished book in it's case that you made. 🙁
I was like "na she is not gonna sew the headbands, she's gonna glue them on" she did 💀🤣
I feel like this perfectly represents the massive commitment that reading this series entails. I'm so glad to see some WoT love!
Loved this project, but I’m with you different sized pages let it down a little but wouldn’t be an easy one to solve. The reaction must have made it all worth it
4:34 brah I looked carefully and it doesn’t look anything like Magic System : https://youtu.be/jBhGTI9YIME?si=ZK38mWtC6jIVrg26
12:01 Who s dat Impostor?   Btw can u do the same process with mangas?
You're amazing. lol
Now, you KNOW you have to build the cart that’s supposed to go with it for carrying it around, right? It’s what Robert Jordan would have wanted.
An okay book series But a artestic masterpiece Is what you made
There's a book series thats a favorite of mine that i happened the of been with it from the start. From book 1 in 2008 all the way to book 15 and the end of the series in 2020. There happens to be a model kit of the main ship from the series. I've been thinking about getting the model kit and buid it then cut the ship in half and make book ends out of it to go on both sides of all 15 books. I haven't done it yet tho because im not confident to do a build like that
I wonder what the folks who work on the TV show would think of this monster project!
This is amazing.👏🏻🤯😍Can you do this with Harry Potter books.That will be so good looking.
This is indeed the dumbest sh1ŧ i have seen and yet its such an awsome idea!!!
I'm always in awe at how talented you are! You're such an inspiration!
Surely reprinting to a larger scale book would have condensed the page limit? 4 pages to each larger page, so 3000 pages at about 30cm thick, making it more readable. But you'll have to have got the digital version or scanned every page, also printers probably wouldn't have enough ink.
You need a table with two lifting columns to be able to read it
I loved your homage to Mistborn, as I more recently fell in love with Sanderson's works, but Wheel of Time has been a love of mine since I was young. Thank you for this beautiful tribute.
My family all loved this series - brought up a feeling of bonding and nostalgia! Thank you 🖤
Next project: Martina flies over to paint the page edges
It was my birthday some days ago I was in Oslo I think I saw one of your works great job
That was deadly, and sooooo jealous! I would take my hat off to you, if i had one!
STUNNING!!!!! I WANT IT! 😭😭😭😭
This project is the definition of “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing” <3 <3 <3
Love it. The only way to make it better would be bubble wrap.
I can't decide if that is the coolest book gift or the most EVIL gift ever for someone to read! If you'd gone to a local printers they would have been able to cut them all down to a single text block size
I need me a girlfriend like that
1:16 That's what she said. Giggity.
That's not long enough  That's what she s...
It should feel sacrilegious, but blasphemy has always held joy
MY FAVORITE SERIES!!!!🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩
WHY ?
The door next to the kitchen is too white. It needs some weathering. 😂
本当にこの魔導書(?)作るシリーズ好き
can you people mention which music are they using? We need names, Names!
いつもながら本当に細かくて丁寧な作業✨✨神は細部に宿りますね
I now want to see this done with Discworld.
Them: "Sure honey, let's go to the bookstore, but you're only allowed one book." The book:
Loved the video! What do you usually use as an alternative to real goldleaf?
imagine having to read all that
Wow...this brought tears to my eyes 💕
I really would like to buy your merch or sketchbook, but I'm BROKE... I really can't spend 6000 INR for just a Hoodie no matter how much I want it. I'll end up begging on the street if I do. 😭
Wonderful project
I knew it would be Daniel lol. This was awsome and I'm not going to lie. I'm very jealous and want one of my own!!!
Really cool Video, but i dont support animal leather... sorry
The is nuts 😂😂😂 l love it❤
As soon as you said that you were giving this to another YouTuber I knew!! I've been a fan of both you and Daniel for years so this just brought my heart so much joy!  I'm currently reading through the entirety of wheel of Time slowly but surely!
This is incredible but I do kind of wish you’d sanded down the edges so all the pages were even
It would have been fun if you made a devise support thing (alternative to Hansi's stock of books) witsh grows (like something likea jack) so that book is stil readable 😁 well now it is an art peace and not ment to be  read anymore, I guess. But just for fun..lol. your lether work is amazing as well as your design. There is nothing dum about it, its art.
Books were fine but the tv series was so bad.
❤❤❤
"This has to glue for a while!"
“Just don’t do anything to offend her.”  I remember this passage, Nynaeve is telling Mat about how he should not offend Queen Tylin.  Soo fun
Me: An abomination* indeed! 😍 Also me: Should I glue all the books of my favourite series together? 🤔  *Just for the title, friends. The craftmanship is as always perfect!
What the hell did you do and where can I get one of my own?!
Too bad Amazon didnt put this much effort into their live action adaptation.
I'm surprised you didn't include a two level moveable reading platform 😂
Am I the only one who wanna see an hour version of that video lol? It’s so amazing but so fast 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope her boyfriend gets to have a glass of milk on her bowls.
So cool!!!!!!
Ça me rappelle le manuel d’utilisation d’inspecteur gadget dans le film xD
C’est absolument GÉNIAL !!!
you should have used this book while doing the book paintings.
Anyway u can copy this I want to BEND TEST it myself,  also a big fan of wheel of time
Looks fantastic! But, could you imagine if she accidentally put the books out of order after all that work? lol
That thing is epic, Martina! The whole time you were gluing and clamping, I thought, "If it's stupid and it works, it's it really stupid?"
I can definitely say that this is the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen (other then my majestic ass cat)
You just made NERD HISTORY little lady.
How long will you have this merch??
Wheel of Time? More like Tome of Crime. This is such a monstrosity lmfao.
Dumb idea maybe, but great taste in books!!! ❤
You are incredible!
Would have been cool if it could have been turned into a circle so when the last page of the last book ends, you start at the beginning again.
good grief! what a project. totally bonkers, but utterly brilliant...as usual!
Do an outrider themed video
Sick project
Kind of upset that Sanderson's name isn't on the cover considering he's responsible for the series even being finished.  That said, probably one of the coolest books I've ever seen in my life
Watching this brought back fond memories of watching my dad work on leather projects. Dad was always working on something when I was growing up.
As someone who makes weekly stupid ideas, I just have one question: why?
This object needs a specialized desk with some kind of adjustable apparatus, dedicated solely to the reading of it.
This book is an exercise to read.
I love the WoT series almost as much as I love this video! Martina, you’re amazing and such an inspiration thank you for your content. It feeds my soul ❤
Instruction book for woman?
So satisfying to watch the carving and staining... and honestly, just the whole making of it! Awesome job!! 👏👏👏
Just out of curiosity. I wonder if it would be possible to print the entire wheel of time series in the same manner that the Bible was printed? If that makes sense? Just really small print, tissue paper like pages... and have it be of a slightly easier to read size lol
I'm disappointed. That I can't like this video more than once. This was EPIC!!
"STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR SELF" THAT WHAT SHE SAID 😭🤣
You have got to do this with Harry Potter ❤❤❤
I was having a terrible, horrible week, and this made me giggle from start to finish. So thank you so much! ❤
It's a bolinky
To think if the Dresden Files series were fully written you'd have over 20 books to bind. 😁
now we need the video: "I made a book, but each page is a book."!
You should do "deathlands" books 126 books in all lol.
is that wrist Brace for carpal tunnel?  If it is give up it won't work I speak from experience I tried for 2 years to avoid surgery
awesome work!
That looks sick.
This monstrosity is useless, unpractical and WHERE CAN I GET ONE?!

"You're gonna have to wait to the end to find out who"   The Goblin in the comment section:
Please please release the blue sketchbook separately! I have the purple and green already and I'm too poor to buy the whole box set just for my one missing book! Pretty please Ms. Forge? 🙏☺
Your hoodie design is so awesoooooome!!! 🤩🤩🤩 if only I have the money to buy it 😢😢😢
I love it. So ridiculously over the top. But beautiful!!!!
Nice slinky book!
I would have started this differently. I would have placed the books side by side on a work surface, upside down, side by side, not on top of each other, and then bound them.
Вот это прикол! Я чуть со смеха не упал!🤣
What is with the stairs in the background? Do they have a dead end? I mean... what "house" is that, where you are there??
What glue do u use??l pls tell me
it's beautiful. even if the project gets dumber with each 30 second interval
If you like wheel of time you should give Raymond E. Feist a shot. First book is called magicians apprentice.
Dude, it may be dumb but it's awesome!
nice video as usual WOW!
I was literally fantasizing about this exact project yesterday
Oh my gosh as soon as you said the amount of books in theseries i knew exactly what series it was. This was great! Proud of you Well done Love the end result
*takes book on airplane* Just some light reading for the flight
This was such an amazing video to watch. You can tell that y'all love what you do, and seeing the end result was so super satisfying. 💙
The first sponsorship anyone has ever done that I might actually buy from.
"Book press isn't big enough, but still works as a book press!" 😂LMAO
librarians now have a new weapon XD
Omg, best book series!
I was waiting for an epic montage of you trimming all the text blocks to be the same dimensions.
1:16 😮
please design the the kitchen door
Whenever she was doing the bending test I kept wanting her to see if the wheel of time would bend all the way into a circle/wheel.
I could only imagine trying to send this USPS media mail haha
You need to make a ridiculously large magic tome!  Pages larger than tabloid.  Requiring 2-3 people to carry
Martina, you are absolutely insane and i LOVE IT! Your videos are so much fun to watch and live through vicariously since atm I cannot be as crafty as you are, which we will be fixing in the future! Hahah i hope to meet you someday just to experience the chaotic fun that is you. Love the content and PLEASE more Nori content adventures of Nori is a must!
Why... Just why Martina, so many books... 12000 pages it woukd take me 1 year to finish this book
having sent a package that was over 8kg from Australia to New Zealand (several years ago) which was almost $110 in postage, I shudder to think what this cost to ship o.O
Great but, i find it'll be a luttle difficult to read that in the bus 😊
I feel like jumping up and down every time this channel uploads
I need to know that this project makes it safely to your friend, this is too cool!
Holy moly wow 😮 that is the most beautiful thing I've seen in quite awhile
Here I am just carrying them all around on my phone like a sucker....
A book with an unbreakable spine! 😦😧😮🤯💀
Just LOVE the whole video...but most of all I LOVE your enthusiasm throughout.  And once again, I was wondering just what would the results be if you teamed up with another of my fave YouTube creators, Ginny Di.
the gold leaf had me rolling hahahhahahha
In the beginning, I was horrified to see Robert Jordan’s Magnum Opus series being “defaced”. And then. I was like: yeah I would absolutely adore this 😂😂
amazing project for an amazing series. love the books and this would have made Robert very proud.
Good book for some light reading
15 years from now, maybe try The Stormlight Archive in one volume. Eh?
This was truly glorious!! Loved this entire video and the reaction at the end was just adorable.
Great video but i can't get that plushy out of my head. I must have it...
Martina, I hope this finds you well & happy. One of the best things I have ever done was to watch your cllab with Linus Sebastian on LTT. I though you creation then was amazing, so much so that I found your channel and subscribed. Madam I am happy to say you do not disappoint! Your and Hans have creativity that is so on a next level and it is a pleasure and thrill to watch you step through your creative process(es). Many thanks for helping to fill some of the void in me with a renewed desire to be & think creatively. You are truly an awesome human being to create such unique beauty and give it to the people that are luck enough to be in your circle.
Hey does anyone know what the words on the sweatshirt are?
I pray Martina double checked the order of the books prior to combining them.
As MumboJumbo said: fully commit to stupid ideas. I'd say you nailed that one lol. It's purely silly epicness 😚👌 Speaking of epicness: props to whoever makes the music in your videos!!
“That’s not a book, it’s a dick measuring contest” -the spouse 😂
Part.2: What the library said when I returned the book(s)
Such a nugatory work, had fun watching it though, thanks for the hard work!
LOL the second you said "Wheel of Time," I was like, "The Goblins are going to love this."
Martina's Artworks are the definition of PERFECTION 🤩who else agrees? 👇🏻
I am SO curious to know how much shipping costed on an item that big! We appreciate everything you and Hanzi (and team) do for our enjoyment!❤️
7:34 na man I thought she about to start some lore
In a bit over a year, you should be able to do the same thing with Stormlight 1-5!
That's about what a braille Bible would look like if it was made into one volume instead of 17 or 18 volumes. Only the pages would be thicker and page size would be bigger, about 12 inches or 30 cm on a side.
TV series was absolute trash. I hope the book is good.
As an unhinged bibliophile, I appreciate how truly insane this project turned out to be. This is, like, the best kind of bonkers.
your muscle 'll improve when you readed this book XD
Youtube series of someone actually reading this book.
Martina is the human version of the word charismatic
Someone get this technology to Brandon Sanderson!   Great video! ❤️
If you push it over the edge of the stairs will it slinky down the steps?
book: IM A TALL BOI!
12,000 pages and STILL lays flatter than most books I own.
I would absolutely buy that book or just a print of that design!!!
Currently reading WoT. Didn't know that Loial wrote the book in-canon. I thought on Chronicler could do that
I would like to tell you about what’s called a “book arch” you can make for books like this with so many pages to be able to read it properly if it’s not a thing make it one lol. :)
I had thought I'd seen it all on YouTube.......... I was so wrong. 😅😅
I would love to see a reimagined version of a library wheel specifically designed to carry this tome. A wheel of time if you will.
The fact that she's smiling throughout all this tedious work tells you everything you need to know about this girl. What a talented pair of people! Every video of theirs make me happy
She made an omnibus
I have read the books 3 times, listened to the audio books twice and watched both TV series. It's one of my favorite series ever.
Yeah, that's cool. *aggressive thumbs up*
I was really expecting the books to go to Sanderson XD
This is brilliant or just madness
How about attaching the spine to a bicycle chain, and make the book an endless chain. You can then house the book in something like a spell casting altar.
❤
I'm not sure if I like it or not... xD
Oh that guy he play DND rustage😂❤
Did you know, most Gold Leaves aren't actually made of Gold. It's usually made of Aluminum and Copper. Sometimes Gold mixed with Silver and Copper. Good thing they actually used real gold leaves. :D
Yet another amazing work of art from your talented hands. 👍👍👏
the hoodie and loggers look very cool but might i ask what the words are and say?
My immediate thought when seeing the thumbnail was 'no, Martina why do you torture yourself like this' 😂
If all of humanity was to die out and this was the last book on earth and aliens were to find it imagine what they would think of it.
2020’s high school history books be like
😂😂😂 You should do this more often, imagine Dune like this
I'm about to be the worst kind of person right now.  Technically, paperback is 11,898 pages.  Hardcover is 10,173
When you said Wheel of Time as one book, I automatically thought of Daniel. I'm glad he is the one that got this.
I have never been more angry than I am now seeing this 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like you would need an adjustable lectern for this book to comfortably read it. A magic lectern if you would.
Bookmakers since ancient times: "Huh... too big of a book is quite unwieldy, let's make volumes!" Martina: "... Nah!"   🤣  BTW... it is just awesome!
This is, without a doubt, the coolest, most ridiculous project I've seen in a long time.  If only the producers over at Prime had shown half as much care and reverence for those books.
It makes me sad to know that there is only ONE of this out there and there's no way to buy one! Such a crazy creation. I absolutely love it!
moist
Oofta...you should have shaved down the edges of the pages to match.
You gonna have to make a custom book display pillow like they use on old books in museums just so you can open it and read it.
Thats one pretty cool looking montrousity
When she said she was doing a Wheel of Time book, I said to myself : Daniel Green would love that. What a surprise to find out he was the one who would received it ! A great video as usual !
I'm in awe, this is so cool
Wait? why not include New Spring?
I need a Skjera Bagera compilation video so I can watch it over and over
while I could see it coming, that was a great ad segue.
How many times did you check to make sure the books were in series order?
OMG, I love that series, I am so grateful to see that other people also enjoying it, and that you have the TOR released version! Not to be too judgmental but I think you could have included a few more of the symbols from the series such as the yin/yangish tear drops for the Aes Sedai and then perhaps a sunburst for the Children of the Light. Then again if that was included then probably would need a wolfish bit added for the Wolfkin, oh and then a simple hand for the band of the red hand.... hmmm, this seems a bit too much... IT TURNED OUT AMAZING THOUGH just ignore my ranting.
The moment I saw the thumbnail my first thought was "I can't wait for Daniel to see this" 😂
that is not a book thats a boooooooooooooooooooooooooooook
"That's what she.." 😂
I love when you do book binding projects. I'd love to see you do  a project for the book Neverending story by Michael Ende so many themes and characters to pull from.
Child: Can I bring my book, please? Mom: But, the luggage is full. Child: Just one, please? Mom: Ok.
Omg this is amazing and DG's reaction is freaking fabulous!!!!
I wonder if this would be comfortable to read on a couch or bed with one end resting on the couch/mattress next to you 🤔  Also, yay proper gold leaf!! 🎉😊
I also have golden hands, only they are inserted with the wrong end.😂
Awesome
I don't know what's crazier. That book or the fact that I now need one in my life.
I certainly hope you double checked the order of the books BEFORE you glued them together. Very cool
70 dollar for a hoodie ? i dont know in which fantasy world you guys believe that this is a ok price
Could you do The Drizzt Novels by R. A. Salvatore please next ???
A medieval style crank-turn screw platform to hold book to open page would be a neat accompanying project.
Ok that was sick 👌👌
I have never seen a book so cool that makes its reader look so dumb 😂 Amazing!
17:23 her expression omgs i couldn't stop laughing 😂😂 and the "WAHHHH"
This was amazing!
imagine a book is misplaced
That is absolutely gorgeous ❤
My favorite series of books were Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends but Wheel of Time is probably my next favorite... This is awesome...
Finally a book that will get me working out for those perfect arm definition and core strength! 😂
Thank you. I think everyone needs a slinky book in their lives. 🙃
I'd love to see you revisit this type of project with another series. I think it would be cool to have each part of the series be able to be separated from the whole with a lock and key or some similar mechanism that relates to the story. That way you would have the huge, epic volume of text but be able to read the stories in a more manageable way.
Missed opportunity to turn it into a literal wheel
Book Slinky = Blinky?
Absolutely gorgeous. The way this series should be sold at Barnes and noble 100%
Who knew it was possible for an item to be both ridiculous and epic? lol
I have never wanted to buy merch before. But that set!!!! Omfg!!!!! I HAVE TO HAVE IT!!!!! great job!
This is a physical version of a kindle, the book series just keeps going
This was cool, but I feel like it would be more practical for use (and I know that wasn’t the point), if the entire series was available as an editable pdf that could be printed out on A3 size paper but with the same font size as the original books. The margins could be made narrower too. That would mean you can get 6 books printed on the same number of pages as it would take to print 3 of the original size books. I dunno if I’m wording it right but I hope you get what I mean. It’s kind of inspiring me to try this with my own fandom (Jurassic park). Fortunately there are only 2 books in the series so combining the two in A3 size is more manageable but who am I kidding, I don’t have you skills… yet!!!!😅 Great work as always!
This book is insane! I can tell you are self conscious about your lost finger, even though you made a video in which you made a prosthetic piece for your hand. But you are very smart, pretty, and you are so creative. So keep up the great work! I love your hair btw. It's very nice.
Why do i suddenly have the urge to do this to my warrior cats books? Lmao, that would be one THICC book🗿
My friend read the entire series. She would loved this. Amazing job!
Is it wrong to be so in awe of the cover and spine that I feel there was an opportunity missed with unadorned page edges?
Unnecessary and so fun
I feel like it would be a perfect book to read sitting at a table in front of a window by just leaving it on its bottom page edge like at 13:55.  Or on a circular table with the two end covers face to face. . . Like a book doughnut 😯  Also, sad I cannot afford Displate. 😔
Imagine being taking that in public or inviting o school!?
Would it have been feasible to sand the edges of the paper so they were all the same length? Or would that damage it too much?
The hoodies look so cool. I will be buying one of these thank you very much :)
1. My immediate thoughts were ratchet straps. 2. My last thought was perhaps a special shelf could be created to make this easier to read. 3. My lasting thought is, that this is fantastic and I'm jealous.
THIS IS SOOOOO FRIIIIIGGGIIINNNGGGG GROOVY!
I want to see a wall scroll of that. It's just that awesome.
This is something you can't do with ebooks.
Thank you so much for sharing❤ I absolutely love your artwork❤!!!!!
could you do all the witcher books in order? including comics?
The fact that you put so much effort into something that you consider dumb says more about your dedication to your ceaft than anything else.  Js,  Also super jealous of Daniel Greene rn.  Lol.  Js.
What is splendiferous gift for the perfect person! That is a truly EPIC centerpiece for a bookshelf
Epicness
Holy crap what an insane amount of details for such creative project!
The background music that starts at 14:30 reminds me of something but I can't for the life of me remember what it is. If anyone has any idea I would love to hear it.
If u have do it in a way that u can just take book by book like a puzzle. But it looks great
Alexelcapo it's happy😎
Now do discworld! 😂😂
Martina, NOT DUMB!!! This is stunning!!! ~Chris
This is amazing! And the hoodie and joggers are amazing too - I'm curious of the writing on them? Looks like elvish or something like that? I'm curious of what it says
Ah! Nice to see you do some simple, chill book binding again. Nothing like going back to basics every now and again, am I right? ... Oh... actually never mind...
Okay, I want one of these, only full of watercolor paper! hahaha This is ridiculous. And epic. Epically ridiculous. 🤣🥰
LOve all you guys do, thanks for the effort.
title on front your new mega book should be "understanding women" on second thought books now big enough for that
Martina, I think you officially qualify to be renamed to "Madly Marvelous Martina."  😂    ...It turned out so ridiculously epicly cool though! 🤩
Now I need to see Sanderson react to this!!!! 😂😂😂😂  And Harriet.  She needs to see that RJ's wishes have finally been fulfilled 😁
5:37 now we know the book from those memes really exists
but for what ?
Imagine Brandon Sanderson gets so jelous of it, that he commisions you one lol
Amazing book(s) binding Martina and Hansa.
You say this is the wonkiest thing but do you forget you used to bind and press books on a broken chair? 😂😂😂
Hello Martina what an epic build beautiful art piece and such a wonderful gift. And speaking of epics perhaps you might like David Eddings 12 book Belgariad/Malloreon series. Or if that is not enough perhaps the 29 volume series of Pug the Magician spanning over a 1,000 years by Raymond E Feist.
Ok, I have loved everything you have done, even this one's carving, however the book was just silly. However after seeing Daniel's reaction, totally worth it!
That's so beautiful
You chosed a good person to give this to. Daniel is such a fan og twot. Hes gona tresure it a lot.
Might have to get me that hoodie
I feel like if you wanted to read this thing you'd need like an antique wooden scale system with a wheel to like slowly turn and shift the weight as you read it haha
Do you know what would be more cursed if you put the bend vertically
You chould send something to sanderson😮
yeah, wheel of time, nice books
I would love to see that done with the Inheritance series, those are my favorite of all time and have a soft spot on me.
You need pipe clamps- you can use any length of metal pipe and clamp pretty much anything/everything. Quick release clamps like yours are handy but I love using pipe clamps for panel glue ups and other ridiculously over sized things.  I don't understand why you glued the leather in place before carving and stamping it though... Was there something about that I missed? Looks great though.  I also would have probably used a sander to even up the edges of the pages though
Making a tablet that could snap/attatched to the back of the carrying box so you could rest one side of the book at differents height level so you can open and read the book at the correct page would have been awesome too :P but damn everything you make is a piece of incridible art!
🥹obviously you created this masterpiece for exactly the right person. I cannot imagine ever being bored by your videos. They almost always make me laugh or shed tears or both. Thank you both for all the hard work you do following your dreams. I know sharing it takes even more work, I hope you know it IS appreciated 🧡🖤🧡
I watched this whole video thinking Daniel Greene would love this then it ended up being to him! Perfect ending 😂
I watched an older video. Your accent is less noticeable now. You sound like Lawrence Welk and he was born in North Dakota
A work of art is never dumb!
So wonderfully beautiful!!
As a guy, I can assure you that the clamp was huuuuge.
This is amazing and needs to be a Cursed Object in D&D. Not because it's stupid but done so freaking well, but just because you'll lose hit points if you drop it while trying to read it! Also, while I'd love to be able to put my Nerdforge sketchbooks in a nice boxed set, there's no way they'd fit in there after they've been filled. They warp really badly when trying to use watercolor, so my blue one cracked and has expanded so much that i had to take out some pages. I haven't tried the other two yet, but did you fix the binding issue?
I have that full collection myself, complete respect, it's so heavy in its hardback format, it ended up bowing the shelf it lived on. Would not want to try and lift them all together 😅😅
I've been following Daniel Greene for as long as I've been following Nerdforge and love this crossover event.
Car jack would help reading that!  Hah!  But seriously... it would...  kudos!
I think this might be the textbook example of "why not?...."
Gosh i love your book videos❤❤❤
The perfect series to do such a project... I'm currently reading it again ... for the 8th time....
Ha! Guessed right. Who else would you send something that awdiculous to?
Someone had to make up every part of bookbinding before there were tools for it. Your rachet straps are an awesome idea
I would love to know how much the book weighed after all was said and done, amazing work as always, thank you for all you do
I just knew it was gonna go to the goblin
I do love a Displate. Expensive but very nice.
Ginness world record book?
That outfit is epic! -Where’s it from?-
Love the silent "That's what she said" at 1:15
Displate says your NERDFORGE code expired but the link in the description works! ❤
The hoodie is OUT?!? *Bum rushes merch site* Just got my order in, (had to go with the cropped hoodie/joggers combo) and I CANNOT WAIT to rock these!
Mad skills
You'll need a bookstand that acts like a balance scale for that book, maybe a next project so the book is actually functional?  Regardless of that book being so dang big, it does look amazing :D
“That’s not long enough… that’s what she-“ 1:16
As soon as I got the email notification that new merch dropped I literally bought everything. Love this channel so much!!!
I am so jealous ! It's ridiculous how I am jealous 😮😂❤ it's beautiful! 🥹🤌
Maybe a cover for an e-book reader comes in more handy?
Nerdforge x Goblin is wild lmao
They did something like this with Agatha Christie books once
Needs a custom lectern with two halves that raise and lower inverse to each other. It'd work with smaller but still absurd books as well.
I read the full series on my kindle. Never realise how huge each of them were in physical 😱😱
I think when people complained about wasting gold leaf, they meant that you didn't need to use full sheets to gild small areas
the perfect book to take on a long flight.
No New Spring, very sadge
I just wish you had sanded down the pages... 😀It is amazing :-)
I would suggest doing this with the Dresden Files, but it isn't done, but if it ever gets done, I may need to have this done.
I really need to finish this series.....read the first half about four times but never have the energy to see it out
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait a second ?! 😮 The books are the wheel of time saga ! My favorite 🥹🤌
My problem is that Wheel Of Time is such a gawd-awful novel. It goes on and on andvon and on and I simply couldn't remain interested.
Now you need to do something with the covers ! 😮
Amazing:):)
martina i love your work but putting art on the other side of the pages opposite to the spine wouldve been the final touch
I love the Book and ur skills.
Okay hear me out. Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe, but re-printed on monstrous elephant-folio or atlas-folio pages so it actually can be lain out on a table to read like a normal book
Watching it bend... I can't help but wonder if it wouldn't be easier to read on a actual wheel itself, looks long enough to do it.
I ORDERED A HOODIE, MUCH EXCITE
I was like- "It had to be Daniel!"  What a silly, cool project!
I can see myself in a comfortable chair reading this book in one sitting.
Martina, you are so amazingly talented.
I smile throughout your videos. It’s not easy and can’t thank you enough! But thank you and have a wonderful evening.
Ahhhh that tooling came out so beautifully Martina! Amazing work as always I love your book binding projects. Makes me want to get off my butt and finish the one I started ages ago! 💜
I was looking away from the screen when you said “all 14 books” and I was like “I bet it’s Wheel of Time 👀” I love this!
(3:37) “This has to glue for a while”
Your videos are amazing and I’ve been watching for years! But this video obviously took a lot of effort and deserves more views
I want to know what Brandon Sanderson thinks of this 😂
When you read  the video title and snort so loud you wake up yorur SO .. this guy..
Your videos are always a pleasure to watch, I have such a good time. Thank you for this quality time! You're always so impressive in your creations ❤Kisses from your French fans !
This needs, like, a rotating cantilevered shelf specifically designed to both display it and read it. Such an amazing piece of work (not that I expected less)! 👍
Ok vag tan  needs to moist to be worked with got it
What can I say, you're 💯percent Mad as a March Hare, BUT I LOVE IT.😍🤘👍
this is definitely the kind of book i would imagine to find at the Library of Hogwarts
Amazing that’s all I can say
man, those 12 entire pages be looking THICC
I’m so excited for a 70 year old Martina to send the entire 10 book planned stormlight archive series to Brandon Sanderson when he finishes that.
5:15 it’s flipping you off😂
Isn't the dragon just a metaphor in the Wheel of Time? I'd don't remember there being a literal dragon at least.
I could only think of Daniel as the person who you were gonna send it to (not knowing you knew each other) and omg lol it was!
how to understand women: volume 1.
Amazing!
not so sure how smart it was about putting real leaf gold on parts that potentially bend a lot [while reading] wouldn't it come of easily over time when its not under another clear plastic layer or somthing ?
Thats going to be some heavy reading LOL😂🤣😂🤣😂
You're work is incredible to watch! I love how everything you make is so very unique and one of a kind! Hard to find that it in a world where it seems everyone just regurgitates ideas from somewhere else! Thank you for sharing your creativity with us!
All I can say, as an employee of USPS, is that you were both and simultaneously blessed and cursed by the shipper, who ever they were.
You should do a project of making that clock into something cool!
I laughed so hard at the very end when Martina is calmly reading a page while holding up 20 kilos of book in one hand.
"If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid" - some guy
I clicked on this knowing Brandon Sanderson was somehow involved in this nonsense
You know how with paperbacks you take a few pages and lay them flat to carefulöy crack the seine until you reach the middle? Imagine doing it with this book 😂  6:17 I mean..floppy books are the best right? 😅😂
That was amazing. Seemed janky it the beginning, but you trusted the process and it turned out very cool in the end. In the part of the video when you were waiting for the delivery, I was thinking "what cool pants! I wonder if she has them as merch?", and then BANG, yes you do! I must get myself a pair, and some sketch books for my artie friend.
The funniest part is, watching from the beginning, I kept thinking "I wonder if anyone sent this video to Daniel." PRESCIENCE.
What if you joined the start and the end together and mounted the spine against a wheel that turns so you can turn it so that whatever part you wanna read is at the top?
People whining about a waste of gold is very strange to me, literally its main purpose is to be a pretty and rare material lol.
I love this so much!!! Someone should make an enormous tome reformatting though; something cube shaped.
I know it looks really silly, and inconvenient but I'm pretty sure someone would pay a pretty penny for this... whatever it is.
Neat project. I harbor grave doubts about that spine's long-term stability. But since it'll probably spend most of its existence sitting on a shelf as a display piece, it'll probably be fine.
Silly you(s) ^w^
me looking at the title: oh god why me, immediately upon seeing martina pull out the first book: ah yeah that makes sense now
I have been wanting to read The Wheel of Time for a very long time. This seems like it was such an amazing project and it turned out just AWESOME! Oh! And thanks for introducing me to such a nerdy YouTuber who I’ll definitely be subscribing to 💜
Worlds thinnest fantasy book
Love, love, LOOOOVED this ❤️
This wa beyond expectations great job!!!
We need more Hansi on camera. \o/
This may be "dumb", but it's genuinely very special, and it's kind of amazing of Daniel was being serious about Robert Jordan wanting this to be done.
Maybe
The wheel ofrece time is an amazing fantasy book series
Amazing... Simply amazing... I still haven't finished Eye of the World, yet. Watching this made me want to get back into it.
Beautiful result. After seeing and loving the bend test, I too want to make a book like that. Leather carving looked fun to me and I always wanted to try bookbinding. Just a question of what kind of books should I use.
This is equally the stupidest and best book i have ever seen.
This was the most EPIC book binding of all time! And Daniel's reaction WAS EVERYTHING!!!! Awesome, random, wholesome fun per usual Nerdforge! This was perfect 💖
You guys never seize to amaze. Just WOW!
"Please don't drop it on your face." omg, the book reading experience could go SO wrong with a book this big XD
How did you attach the gold leaf to the leather? Glue?
I like the fact you use Gavin Luke for your videos. I to am a fan.
Love that books series. Sad the author died before it was finished but glad he dictated everything to his chosen successor. You have to put the Map back in! Next Project!!! The back of the Kitchen door is too white. Needs something....Mural of Dystopia-esk!
I want to make one ahhhh
It’s the fact that she wakes up one day and decides to do this whilst I wake up and decide to watch her do this
Next episode: Space and time warp around the gravity well created by the massive tome, creating a powerful black hole which promptly consumes the whole universe.
I was wondering who the recipient could be, until she said it was going overseas, and then it became almost obvious. This whole endeavour is amazing.
Homegirls been working those guns 💪 good on you! You inspire people
Now you'll have to make an adjustable book stand so you can read it.
Now this is interesting.  An entire universe in just one book.      And I was not disappointed in how unbelievably LARGE that book was.
You should put an exit sign on top of the door in the kitchen, it would bring everything together
this is beyond epic
Fun fact for those curious about vegetable tanning: leather is made a few different ways, but the most common ones are chrome tanning, which involves treating the hides with chromium salts to make them flexible and non-porous, and vegetable tanning, which uses organic compounds called tannins. Yep, the same ones in tea and red wine. They're called that because they tan leather. Vegetable-tanned leather is more durable and much better for tooling and the like, at the cost of being stiffer, more porous, and more expensive. Chrome tanned leather is usually what's used for jackets and furniture, but it doesn't age as well and it's harder to dye after it's left the factory. Also it's an ecological disaster zone, but what isn't these days. Neither of these are the historical method of producing leather, which was much more disgusting, and I'm not gonna go into it. Seriously, don't google it while eating. And yes, if you wanted to, you could bind a book with chrome-tanned leather, but it won't last as long and you can't tool it, so there really isn't a point unless you want your book to look like a biker jacket. This is your fun fact of the day.  TL;DR: tree bark and acorns make leather for books, chromium salts make leather for handbags, and this project was EXPENSIVE.
Changing the thumbnail worked for me haha. This one made me click :D
When insanity meets talent!! My god woman what have you done!!!!!!!!!
This is so cool ❤
if the number of books in this series doesn't make this daunting enough to start, having to flip through this monstrosity probably will. (i got up to book 6. i think.)
You have the power of an Aes Sedai. ❤
this would have been a "dangerous" project with a living author....
I loved this so much but watching her rip those covers off the books made my soul cry a bit. lol!
Ok I guess I will read the Wheel of time now alright.
Ou hey what is you Hobby? Martina: Suffer ._.
The wheel of time is an immense series that is hard to read, digest and follow but man is it worth it
This is too epic! I guessed it was going to go to Daniel! I wonder if Brandon is going to be a little miffed it doesn’t also say “& Brandon Sanderson” on the spine? 😄 Great work!
how
You guys are as crazy as can be. I love it. This creation was stupendous. Awesome work from the both of you.
okay but this is also the perfect canvas for painting on the side of the pages because it’s so huge
Normally to align the pages you'd use a guillotine knife and trim them identically, but these aren't going to cut more than 1500-2000 sheets at a time. Even with a hydraulic clamp (set as heavy as possible without risk of damaging the paper) and a freshly sharpened blade, you'll likely get a millimeter-ish of draw on the cut. And what you have there looks more like 10+ times that. There's no blade sharp enough to trim that much paper without SIGNIFICANT draw.  So maybe you could have used a belt sander or similar? While the whole book is clamped, just sand down the sides to smooth them out. The challenge here would be to get them perfectly parallel and aligned. Mind you, I'd do a test first because who knows if that would just look like poo.
Martina, you have gone again, being yourself
Your projects are always on another level. Many creators put in the bare minimum amount of effort when putting out content. You really work for your projects. They are always complex, intricate and amazingly detailed. Always look forward to your builds.
You did it again, love it never saw such a huge monster book!! When I see you I kinda thing we have things in common, I have ADHD or maybe very enthusiastic. But my creativity is somewhat pale in comparison to you. You can do anything at top level.
Your channel should be number one recommended on YouTube.. your art, talent and crazy mind are the perfect combination for every project ❤❤
That is incredible, but imagine if Martina had also painted the page edges. The most overdone book in the world.
16:35 Someone can tell me the name of this music ? Thanks ^^
That is one of my favorite series as well. Kind of hard to transport that around...lol
amazing idea, amazing creation, amazing final review, also so kind and fun video) I laughed a lot) and full edition 7.5cm-thickness with 1340 pages of "Witcher" is busted)
That is so ridiculous.  I love it.  I generally am one to embrace new tech, but when it comes to reading, I stick to paper.  There's just something so much more satisfying about reading a book, instead of just text on a screen.
you summoned me
HEELLLLLL YASSSSSSSSSSSS IVE ALWAYS IMAGEND DOING THEIS OMGGGG AHSGEHBDSJBSBDBDBFB I LOVE IT I LOVE IT ILOVE IT
part of me wants to do this exact same thing, just for the idea of "Wizard who has too many spells" cosplay
Algorithm cookie 🍪
Your craftsmanship is beautiful.  So happy when I saw a new post appear on my feed by this lovely channel.
Крутая штука! Никакого уважения к читателю))))
Epically brilliant 🤓
This is amazing! I love your channel and the Wheel of Time is a fantastic series. I am so happy to see such a beautiful piece of literature become one with a beautiful piece of art. You guys did a superb job.
Video idea you should create a how to train your dragon mural or a portal in a wall to the httyd universe or any other fantasy univerce
As someone with a slinky for stimming purposes, I will forever love the "Book slinky". The dedication to the  silliness is comendable and I have nothing but respect.
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
A submarine door and a pinball machine?
I outta look into that book binding for a D&D cosplay with my characters book of shadows
Plot twist! Some of those books were placed upside down!....
"Bend over my dear" Yes, I’m talking with nothing BUT my book!!!
My ALL TIME FAVOURITE bookseries!!!!!! I've been reading this for decades. Every year I do an entire read through! Amazing job again my lady!
You don't stop to amaze me 😍
A table with a convex surface or half wheel for the book to lay on and be transparent with a mirror to reflect the binding would be cool!
Ratchet straps are a perfectly reasonable clamping solution.  I use them when making large cabinets or picture frames and such all the time.
I feel like now you need to make a reading table for this book that has two spring loaded platforms so that both sides can be properly supported no matter where in the book you're reading.
My brother and I CHACKLED bc my brother said that could kill him lol
OML I'm halfway through the 5th book (Fires of Heaven). I've been reading the series about a year (with a bunch of other books scattered in between) and according to my Kindle, I've only read 40% of the series.
You're gonna need a step stool to read it....
Hold up.... so the show has like... MILES OF CONTENT LEFT TO CREATE? my girl loves the series. My fav books are J.L Bourne- Day By Day Armageddon
jesus marry me now girl
You have the coolest fashion sense, I'm so glad your merch isn't just some t-shirt with a logo on it. Wow that is amazing
I called BOOK SLINKEY as soon as she folded it in half. Lol!
This is 🔥🔥🔥 lol
OMG OMG OMG I NEED THAT NORI
Already at 0:06 and seeing the Wheel of Time books I had a dopamine rush. I cannot be happier for this project!
I think you missed an opportunity to make a book as a wheel.
i loved the book amazing job !!!!
I LITERALLY JUST GOT THE PURPLE SKETCHBOOK NOOOOO 😢😢😢
This is probably the craziest project you have done.  Also what was shipping like $700 USD?
The idea is so silly at first thought, yet you manage to make it so lovely and awesome! 😍 I wouldn't have the guts to take on a huge project like that, bc if I did I'd probably end up completing it only to realise I put one book in the wrong order! 🤣
You were already a legend, many years ago. But honestly, this is one of the most legendary things ever achieved.  You are living the dream of millions.
Whats the final size? Length and weight
That abomination has made my day, and brought back some motivation. I'll have to try making one of these books for myself now.
Of all the books that need a bookmark lol
Also, if you wanted to make some Wheel of time prints, I wouldn't say no lol I still have my dragon and I LOVE it!
What songs did you play?😮
Lol the booklegg thingie, looked like one of Aginor's weirder creations 😛😅😅 Awesome work 🖤
Love your awesome creative mind and to see it come to life is just mind blowing to see
POV you're a Wizard in a high magic DnD campaign with homebrew spells, and this is your spell -book- tome  I was sure you would do this, and know this, but maybe you forgot? The uneven edges can be aligned with a handplane, I'm pretty sure. Just plane it down
😇😇❤
Now create a special lectern to read it on. I imagine it'd be basically a set of scales, with each cover attaching to a scale and the scales moving up and down to hold the page you're on at the same level.
These books are made for walkin'
i would love to own this amazingness, just saying they are lucky
Now imagine someone sitting mext to you on the train and being in the first 100 pages of the book
Tolkien, eat you heart out.
Just wow
To fix the different sizes you can use sandpaper to gently buff down and blend the height differences. This was so insanely beautiful I am a huge wheel of time books lover and you made the most ultimate  W.O.T. book ever.
The page ends, (top, bottom,side) need painting or gold leaf.  The exposed pages on that book look bad!, too new and white!  Take care.
Hey Martina I would love to see you making an epic wooden podium/book stand to hold one of your books. I know you would make it look EPIC
the dragon needed gold grills lolololol
As always, truly inspired and epic!
A normal Artist would have designed just the slipcase for a boxed set of 'The Wheel of Time', but Martina just isn't normal... how should her friend ever read this crazy book?
I'm sorry but just seeing this makes me die a little inside.
Totally impractical, absolutely beautiful!
5:11  that is the best laugh ever!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Martina is an amazing artist!! Awesome job!!
Most beautiful thing i've ever seen❤
I was excited about starting the project, then I saw they had maps in the innar covers and my soul died........... Ok I have watched further. My soul is at peace now
Love the hair as always
I thought you were doing a huge painted design on the white pages side at first 😂
Her merch are the best I've ever seen!
When I saw that white door in the video I immediately thought about what happens if she painted and drew something on there lol Btw I can't avoid thing about that all ur videas are so amazing!!
😮😮😮
If you had painted the back orange, you could have called it Edge Sheeran. (I'll show myself out)
You just made this fan girl so happy, The Wheel of time is basically my favorite book series EVER and seeing it like this made me so happy. Also, you changed the thumbnail, put it back lol that's what grabbed my attention lol
LOL!  I knew when I saw the line about 12,000 pages into one book it had to be Wheel Of Time.
It's not stupid if it works!
This reminds me of the book from spongebob 😂
It was kind of dumb from the gegining but MAYBE you got somo kind of record... Beautiful work, by the way! ❤
I wanna see a timelapse of you reading that all the way through lol
Lashing down with an angular piece of wood that is longer than the length of the book? Not a good idea. It would have been better to reduce the pieces of wood to the size of the book, because now you are only pressing the ringlets together and laying them on their side. Ask someone who knows about load securing.😅
The autism in this video is off the charts lol
Could you have sanded down the edges of the paper while it was ratchet strapped to make it all the same size??
It's such a silly yet awesome project! 🤣 My 2 leatherworking cents: rather than using stains, you could've used leather paints like Angelus': lots of different colours (even ones you could never achieve with stains, like whites), great flexibility and they're not runny (thus fantastic for use with brushes - and no bleeding)! 😉 Plus, should you ever need to repaint something, you can even strip the paint away!
This is uniquely awesome and ridiculous at the same time. Love it.
Epicness
The new thumbnail does make more sense 😊
Imagine if you did this with the Horus Heresy...
If you make the two covers touch, you can read the book endlessly as a wheel for all of time.
Now thats a true American Phone book of a Chatty Cathie 😂
This is amazing
Sadly, I can't buy the merch. (Due to payment options), but I do love the designs on de hoodies and sweatpants.
RIP the back of whoever delivered this.
sorry i wasnt waiting for the new thumbnail with that huge looking bock to click the video
That was amazing!
"These books were made for walking, and that's just what they'll do- one of these days these books are gonna walk all over you" 😂😂😂
“This might be very very smart or very very very very very dumb” - the story of every invention ever 😂
Honestly this is so beautiful. What a masterpiece. AND you gifted to Daniel Greene how awesome. 🎉🎉🎉
I saw a thumbnail on Reddit and I was convinced it was fake. I’m sorry Nerdforge, my faith failed me but has now been restored…
For reading, you need to put each side on a springloaded plate/tray stack. Automatic leveling!
I LOVE so much your place!!! That room is incredible
Великолепно! Обожаю смотреть твои видео! Они так вдохновляют и помогают не бояться больших проектов))  Идея безумная, но такая красивая!!! Удачи и творческих идей! / It's fantastic! I really like to see your videos! It gets me a lot of inspiration and helps not to scared big projects)) The idea is amaising and crasy, but so beautiful!!!  Good luck and creative ideas! (sorry, if it is wrong translation)
Its not even fair how cool this is! What an amazing project, bravo!
No way my husband isn't getting out of buying me that jumpsuit for Christmas. It looks amazing!!!
This is the most amazing thing ever.
Currently reading this serie for the first time, and it's awesome.   And i LOVE this book. Your art skills always impress me. Kinda want to read it in a 1 book form now😅
as if the eye of the world wasnt long enough as a book on its own......
OMG that is so cool!!!😮🤯
Dumb question, how much does that MASSIVE book weight? lmao
I gotta say, that is insane. Well done.  Be proud of your creation.
I feel like you missed the opportunity to age the paper and yellow it. It would look so much better
I enjoy your content. Its amazing!🎉
Well done! Now I need to read that book! I already bought tome 0 let’s see how it goes
I love the WoT. It's amazing. Actually going through my 2nd read through right now and I'm at book 7. I love the series and love what you did here. Amazing project. Amazing series. Just great job.  Edit: You should auction this off. I know i would pay a lot for something like this. Ans you could then donate the funds. Its a win win xD
hey guys so usually im just a silent watcher but this deserves every praise there is because YOOOOOOOO this time you really outdid even your own self, i mean this is just freaking amazing, the details are just mwah. anyways with that being said, i dont think this was stupid at all i could literally watch you do something so mundane like idk mopping the flor and i'd still enjoy every second. PROPS TO YOU GUYS!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I would love to bind a lot of dnd rulebooks together just for the drama of pulling it out and thunking it on the table any time there is an argument over rules
Whhhaaaaattt 🤯🤣
So she printed half a Stephen King book.
I've been waiting for this haha [after Harry Potter, I just knew this day will come]. Awesome job as always 😁
I did not know it would be Daniel and thought what would happen if he came across the books in a bookshelf roast😅. So glad it is him though!!!!
I like how you basically made the Rolodex of time 😂
tis is viutifol
I love the dragon it's my highlight of this masterpiece!
Hopefully she put the books in the right order. I definitely would have accidentally mixed them up.
Why, if you live in Norway, don't have a dealer in Europe to buy in your store? It's very expensive to buy through US and pay custom taxes. It's very disgusting
Next project, a bi-level adjustable desk designed to read slinky-books.
Martina and Hansi. You are completly nuts. Love it. Keep on
What?! You didn't paint the edges of the pages? So disappointed ... *jk I really should rebind my WoT series because mice bit the covers while ex landlord was doing work in ex-apartment and left gaping holes in the walls, but I'm a slacker unlike you.
Love your epic projects!!!!!!!
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
You two are super talented! And super nice and fun to watch exclamation point cheers to the both of you🎉❤
Am i the only one who saw that the picture of this video changed 3 times?
id KILL to see the sweatshirt/pants in different color themes 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
go martina
I’m only 25 seconds in and I’m confident that it will be Daniel Greene.
I had to pause to recover from the heart attack triggered by the savage slaughter of perfectly fine hardbacks 🤣🤣🤣
As fun as beautiful, wow, insanely crazy ! Congrats !
Incredible job.  I hope the author sees this
Using a bookpress as a weight on top of the books is a great example of "task failed successfully". Big, strong and fluffy dragon hug for all of you.
Gotta ask did you get inspiration from the massive one piece book that some dude did that apparently is so big it can't be read? Plus I'd love to see what you'd do with the discworld books
Imagine if they printed all the books out on some huge paper turning it into a MASSIVE grimoire lol. Everytime you open it you’d feel like you were about to cast a world ending spell 😂
I'm pretty sure I have this in ebook format. 😂
i need this so bad lol
Wait until you find outvabout the 100in1 one piece volume
That. Was epic!!!!  EDIT: this video piqued my interest and I am now onto book 5 and have watched the series twice!!!
If it works is it stupid?
The merge ad made me sad, because I really like the hoodie and waited for it since the last video to order. But today I saw that it is 86,23€ including shipping. That is sadly way to much 😔
Can you please make a cyberpunk themed cyberdeck?
tis is cool
that was awwesome!
"THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID" HAD ME ON THE FLOOR😂😂😂
ello
The way that I KNEW it would go to Daniel as soon as I saw that this was a video about The Wheel of Time😂❤
If stupid works, it ain't stupid... wish someone would do something even 1/10th as nice for me...
Wow she as so awesome
imho, it so freakin' amazing! How can it be dumb if it looks absolutely mafinicent! XD Bravo!
Not a professional bookbinder Jet,(aprenticeship) but i saw this, and maybe Show my Boss
This book is an abomination before both gods and men and I love it.  Also, this is clearly a thicc boi. But you know what would be truly awesome?  Remember the giant spellbook?  That. But WoT.  We have the thicc boi. Now we need the tall king.
I couldn't stop giggling through this whole thing :D <3 love it!
i love the wheel of time Soo spol much 🖤😄
5 Bier für die Männer vom Sägewerk
I love her laugh
Love your Talent! A Little Heavy Reading!!! LOL
Youre like an adict. You keep doing more and more extreme challanges
Why did you not use your lassr engraver to engrave the leather
My first reaction was *"why?"*  But, this was not a 'why,' but a *necessity*
hey im sorry but ive been binge watching your videos im officially in love with your channel and you of course
Anyone else getting Zhongli vibes from the joggers and hoodie, i love it
*It would be cool if you airbush the side of the pages gold just to make it more magical. But that still turns out great. Amazing Job :)*
You guys are ridiculous, and I love it😂
THE WHEEL OF TIME IS AMAZING!!! shame i havent been able to buy all the books, i have 5 of them but the books i need are no longer available in my country TT^TT
since this is the wheel of time why not make it circular
Awesome. No other words. Awesome.
Have you ever thought about using carbon paper for your tracing needs? You could literally cut your tracing time in half by tracing only once.
I'm a professionnal bookbinder who graduated from école Estienne and I must say this is some great stuff, I can't wait for this monstrosity to be seen in a few decades or centuries in a rare book fair. Us bookbinders love funky shapes and systems. This is for sure a great fit. I'm pretty sure we all asked ourselves at some point "what if the text block was much wider than the spine is long ?" and this is a perfect example. Also this act of binding together multiple books is not new, it's called Sammelband (and other names but this one will work for an international comment on a youtube video) and has great historical interest as it allows us to define reading practices of the owner of the books who comissioned a bookbinder to bind them specifically together. It means it had meaning for the owner ! Great job, in so many crafts, you are an inspiration !
When I first saw this video, I misread the title - I read it as "I made a 12.000 page book animation"
A true artist...bravo!!!
This is so rediculous, I absolutely love it!!!!!!!!! The painting on the back is stunning.
Now do the same.... with the Discworld series.
This is mental illness at its finest.
Brilliant idea turning a book series into a work of art. Now imagine this on a book shelf with lights.
Now Turn the Harry Potter Series into ONE BOOK.
As soon as you said 'This is going to a youtuber" I said out loud, 'Bet its Daniel Green' Haha!
probability somebody clipped 17:23-17:24 bit and looped it is probably between 92% and 98%.
@Futura 💋🌏 Clic canal. Jugar lista: "Corrupto Amérikkka..."
Omg i just knew it was for daniel😂😂
It would be easy to make a stand that would make a book like this easily readable. You would just need a baseplate as large as the open book, and two smaller platform plates to support the covers, which can be raised and lowered along vertical guide posts to the necessary heights. Imagine two hands holding a slinky, and you'll get the idea of the mechanics behind it. The whole thing could be nicely made from wood. For bonus points, you could build a stand that uses two pulleys attached to two center posts, at the top and bottom positions of the book spine, with cables that automatically raise and lower the two platforms as the pages are turned, keeping further to the "wheel" theme.
Yeah, wow.  That's amazing work! Nice job. I would buy one
Even before she announced who she’s sending this to, I knew it was Daniel 😂😂 #booktube my gut feeling was right. Beautiful work!!
I would assume you can sand uneven pages at that point, I hope the edge of all the pages will be painted one day
ahhhh it's so annoying that I don't know which size of the cryptic clothes are the ones in germany... I really tried to google it but is seems impossible to actually get something that looks good... I have pants Width 38/Length 30 and my hoodies are XXL but I really don't know if 2XL or 3XL is the correct size for me :/
And at the end you get a simple guide on the topic "how to understand women " 😂
Would love the artwork on the spine as a wallpaper for my PC 😍
This is absolutely perfect!!! o_o I know these take forever to do but God damn I wish I could have that as well 😂
You are an absolute Rock Star!!!!
You really rolled the dice on this one! (Had to sorry)
Hello, as usual you're very inspiring. After watching each of your videos I plan at least 3 projects in my home (BUT I have full time office job & 2 kids & I just moved - change home... a lot mandatory things to do - BUT nevermind !!!) THANK YOU for this motivation you bring me !!
That is such a brilliant piece of original art. Beautiful!
Omg that is insane and amazing! What an stunning job as always!!!
Youve outdone yourself! What a masterpiece <3
WHAT IS BEHIND THAT DOOR?! i have so many questions
Robert Jordan The Wheel of Time book series?? Ah…just watched further and you highlighted what series it is 😂
Martina makes the most amazing useless things.
15:06 what is this song please Google can't find it?😭  19:56 🤣🤣I know I have a dirty mind but that doesn't help.
I am on my way to see if my broke ass can afford that badass hoodie!
Epic.
I can honestly say, I have never seen a bad video from you. Very talented lady, keep up the amazing work, it is really great seeing what new ideas you come up with, (hopefully with more of your art skills, :P )
That's so cool, do Horus Heresy next 😆
Just as an editorial advice - your leather work there is amazing - but we don't see it until 11:40ish. Can I suggest a "splash" 5-10 second opening so new viewers know what they're getting? You're the artist, not me - but a little bite up front will encourage new-comers to stick around. And that leather work was / is amazing!!!
😂❤ wow  just wow
I started picturing your watercolor painting idea from a few books before. Doing scenes on the front  top and bottom of the pages.   Probably too late now! But it would have been a nice big canvas
It's amazing just wish you would of put it through a band saw or something to make it all even
Absolutely beautiful work! The only suggestion, I would make, is to always stain, and paint, from lightest to darkest.
Love your imagination and creation al are amazing. And the craftman you have is wonderfull.
I too have always thought about reading a series as a single book. As a younger man I fell for David Eddings, "The Belgariad", and just dreamed of this. Thanks for the leather carving that took it right over the edge...
That leather-work is incredible guys 👏🏻 Wow!  Book slinky for the win! 💜💜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
But what about New Spring 🥲? It deserves to be there if we have Crossroads of Twilight
The most AWESOME part of this has to be the leatherwork. Anyone can make a 12000 page volume, but only @Nerdforge can make it look right.
This is pure dedication.
"Stop playing with yourself" 💀
🫠 would Love to see this treatment for my favorite manga death Note 🙌🏽😎
As soon as I saw this huge paperline on a preview picture I thought "well, it is probably WoT"
Will you do something for the Inheritance Cycle? In honor of the anniversary and the new book? But not like this...😂
Wow! Sykt kult!
There was only one Youtuber that this could have gone to. Wonderful video.
How does one even read (handling wise) such a book?
I would love to see a book bound with denim instead of leather.
That is awesome!!!!!!!!!
I loved this one 😆 I clicked the diorama option for your latest pole, but bookbinding was a super close second. EPIC!!!
You should have gotten one of those paper guillotines to make all the pages the same size.  That would have improved the finish and truly made it look like one large book.  Plus they are super fun to use.
I'm just eating water and drinking some food its alright could do with less chocking but sti...
Just wow.. lol Nice job!!
Bookish Lunacy at it's most epicly awesome. Please, you two must never change!  👏
I was genuinely thinking that Daniel was going to be so jealous watching this so I'm delighted to know that this was just simply the perfect crossover
"Stop playing with yourself" - tee hee
"Don't show this to a professional book binder" So of course i showed it to a professional book binder. She said it was a very "unique" way of book binding 😂
Just Amazing!
A custom podium would probably allow for the best reading experience. also have you looked into mushroom leather, kinda new but a step toward sustainability.
I haven’t laughed this hard at a video in so long. The slinky book is now a thing. Finished project is absolutely stunning 🤩
This is so cool and now I want to purchase all sixty-two original Goosebumps books and do the same thing.... I dunno why but that's the book series my brain chose... also the Harry Potter and LOTR series would be just as insane.
😂 I love it! I have ebook reader with basically only the WoT series on it, so I don't have to choose which WoT book to schlepp around with me.
if i had to do this with my favorite book series it would be... 41 books... yikes
you could have built some sort of pedistal i would imagine the magicians would have at home... or two,  to hold the other side up and make it readable. hm
Breathtaking!
That leather work is amazing. I dont think i would have the patience to do that.
?
I love you - I mean that -  if I could email a delivery address and get a "you" - I absolutely would.... BUT.... even for you... this was crazy.... I thought you topped out on "I chopped off my finger, so made a new one".... but.... no, turns out you have a whole new lane of nuts.... And I love it..... MORE PLEASE!!!!
This is probably the best fantasy series of all time, shame modern tv is ruining the story 😂  I still have to restart the series and get past book 10 😅
My childhoood that didn't really exist is complet to see a big book like from a cartoon in real life
*slow clap* amazing. Beautiful. So incredibly silly and I’m here for it.
I‘d love to see a project for the percy jackson series since the show is coming out next month🤍
Wow this Book is huge 😮 and so beautiful ☺️🥰
Ahh, now you get to learn about the differences in types of paper and ink, because some of them are acidic!
I often wondered what the whole series would look like, properly done, as one volume. Now I know! Great work!
Published 2 hours ago, 51k views and 198k likes, how?? Great content btw 👍🏻
This needs a dedicated rolling pin that you can put under the back of the spine, that way it forces the pages of the section it is under to stay slightly apart, and you can slide it as you progress through the monstrosity.
Did you tell him it was real gold leaf? It would probably blow his mind!🎉
As always I'm in awe of the skill and creativity on display here. Impressive stuff!
That should be in the Smithsonian 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 or at least featured on Ripleys Believe It Or Not.
As if I didn’t already love your channel, finding out you’re a fan of WoT is the icing on the cake! I’m curious though, did you consider using an Eastern dragon rather than Western? Or incorporating a heron into the cover? Excellent work!
I would literally pay hundreds to have a masterpiece like this one 😮 Would you be interested in making a second one 👀😂 ??
That looks more than 12.0 pages. Maybe 12,000?
the world creative would be an understatement for this innovative amazing woman
You have indirectly made me have to read this series.
Beautiful and amazing work. Keep being stupid 😉.  I really thought you were sending it to Maisie Matilda or another artist first.
I love all of the videos, but I have to say, the book bindings are my absolute FAVES!! I wish I could like this video a hundred times!
dont hate me for this...but seeing that "book" open reminded me of an old meme...the caption was "the book on how to understand women"
Just curious, but what kind of glue do you use to bind it all? Love your work!
I would fully die if I got this. ❤😂
That is so beautiful ❤
Really awesome cover, now you can build a sort of adjustable wood piece that you can elevate with a endless screw system, you put it under the side with the less pages and you adjust the height to match your reading advancement, and maybe make it in a way it can fit in what is left of space in the wooden box, or can be attached to it.
Oh no
Okay, that was very, very cool; not stupid at all. There's a few book series that run that wide, that'd be excellent candidates for the One Book treatment.
Wow  ❤ totally amazed by your creations
at first I thought you are gonne make a massive Flipbook 😮😮😮
I have been tempted to take the last three books apart and make the chapters all work out. I know its next to impossible but I have always wanted to!
🤩🤩🤩 this's sooooo cool
I mean this is a great idea . Beautiful work as always. Keep up the good work. You all put a lot of time into this project and you can tell. “Stupid projects require stupid solutions”. I know you said that but this was anything but stupid.
Noticed your Nuka Cola fridge 💯 Fallout fan? Fallout artwork?
That book is a true arm workout 😆 It looks so beautiful!
5:32 Idk if that's a Stonjourner (A rock type Pokémon) or if tis a slinky in book form. Lol xD 5:57 Hey, that's what I just said, Hansey. XD
1:17 he he...
There is no difference in colour between real and artificial gold leaf.
I love your videos a lot! I absolutely love your enthusiasm.  She’s probably a stoner with her attitude   Perhaps?
Place some books on each side. Thats a work of art right there amazing!
Does anyone know the background music used in this video? She always manages to find really cool tracks that add to the whole vibe of her videos 😎🎶🎧
It's so glorious! I love it so much. I'm just imagining at customs the agent seeing the very large, heavy, duct-taped box with the shipping manifest: 1 book  and being like "Oh yeah, they're absolutley smuggling something" and then opening it and seeing that it is, in fact, 1 book
that final result was just fire!!! *chefs kiss*
No cat spine: 0/10.
Frankenspine!
This would be perfect for people with a reading addiction. “You’re only allowed to read one book this week” 😂 I would love to have a bookshelf full of slinkies. ❤
You need to build a custom table for it!
I love all her reactions and expressions. it makes it all seem so real and funny!! love your video's<3
I remember when I started reading the wheel of time series. There were only 3 out at the time. Each one the size of a brick. I was half way through the third book getting very concerned cause he just kept adding characters. I was not ready for the absolute epic number of pages this thing would become.
Love it. What a great piece. Thank you @Nerdforge.
Excellent job you too!
On the off chance that you do this again, I would suggest an Oxford Hollow. It's a tube of cardstock in between the leather spine and the back of the text block. But instead of one large tube, maybe a row of tubes, perhaps a second row as well. Either way, this was enjoyable to watch
"Thumbs up for book slinky!"
You could do the same with The Lord of the Rings. Sure it won't be as BIG as this project, but as far as I know, Tolkien wanted TLotR to be one book, but editors said it would be too big or something similar.
5:30 🎶 These books were made for walking, and that's just what they'll do. One of these days these books are gonna walk all over you 🎶 😂
We do not deserve this woman. Protect at all cost.
Have you thought about making your own marbled endpapers?  I think you'll have fun learning the process!
That is such a monumentally stupid project done so monumentally beautifully I don't know how to feel.
So ……if you were to bend the book 360°, you would have an actual wheel of Time book….uhmmmmm
This was so amazing!!! ❤
Next time try spraying the leather with water BEFORE staining. You will end up with way less splotchiness and get a better result
this was amazing, but also low key disappointed he didn't slinky it 🤣
Oh my gosh guys! How about next project! “A book robot!”
Oh my gosh nerdforge! you guys for sure have to coolest merch on all of YouTube. I am so buying your hoodie and pants, and your sketchbook, and cutting mat, and thermous, just pls don't go out of stock while I'm saving up
Omg that was awazing
The artwork and the gold leafing looks so amazing
So when are you going to go for reading the entire book front to back? 😂
If someone like me gets it i will treat it like a holy object and would not dare to touch it. Damn i wish i was an adventurer
Ok ok obviously the book is epic, but can we take a moment to discuss the beauty of the merch? Sweat pants that look like a racing suit?!?!?
This is WHOLESOME
I love it! It makes my day much better everytime I open youtube and see a Nerdforge notification, because I know it will be something ridiculously amazing! You guys inspire me to become a better artist in each video!
you guys are awesome. and so glad it went to someone equally as cool as Daniel!
Wow. You are amazing. I love the Art on the back 😍😍😍
OMG! This is what I had thought of doing with the Witcher books. Wouldn't be as big, but so fun.
Also should be a merch " If we're gonna do this, we are gonna do it properly" hahaha
You outdo yourself every single time. Incredible!
I love how much work yall put it. Shows me I don't got what it takes to be a craft youtuber, but its amazing to watch. LOL
Everything worth doing is worth overdoing. This was so darn epic <3
While it may be unsatisfying to have all of the books be slightly different sizes, I think that's a really cool part of it! You can clearly see where all the books start and end that way!
Good lord.
this is utterly frivolous and i love it
You guys can create anything Awesome and so entertaining. And all kinds of great sense of humor. Awesome job. See you in the next one. 😎😎🔥🔥
You should have made the book loop back onto itself. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning
I'm so confused on how to order the joggers! 😢 my waist is 27 but my hips are 42 , no idea if I should he a small or an L or XL
Do Harry Potter next
My favorite part of the video is where you state this is your "favorite book series" at the start but yet never once state the name of the author.  Good job giving credit to other artists !
This is unreasonable.
Imagine trying to read this in the evening in the bed😂
Okay but you have to age the paper tho
Hi Martina this one's amazing but I think it could have gone to another level, if you had painted the map on the book pages like you did for one of your other books sets with painted scenes on or put some of the characters on to it on the white side where you read from. But double thumbs up from me 👍👍
i know people throw these words around but genuinely you have outdone yourself with this one 😭😭 this is simultaneously the most amazing and the most unhinged thing you've ever created and i love that for you lol
It would have been hilarious if martina was just bodybuilder over the top buff in one arm. "Wow! So much muscles! How did you do this?" - "Reading?!"
The quiet _that's what she said_ got me 😂
Imagine misplacing one of the books before glueing
As a fellow bookbinder this is awesome!! ❤📖
What’s the music at 2:54 ?
That guy reads all of those books 💀💀💀👽👽😎😀😯😉😈😈😈, you can upgrade fantasy novel stories 😀😀😯😉😈😈😈😎😎😎😷😷😷
omg when you said you would send it to someone i instantly thought of Daniel!!! I love both of your guys' channels so it felt like my two worlds were colliding lol btw the merch looks so cool
I’m Dying of Laughter when they opened the book!
Love this! The binding, the artwork….. the whole thing 😊❤
Did I see Biltema :O
It is not a stupid idea. It is the kind of stupid idea that can make an entrance to World Guinness Records
They don't really sell that stuff on nerdforge   😀😀😀😯😉😈😈😈💀💀💀💖💖
my fav quote from my fav creators: "behold our dumbest creation yet" LOL in case you guys are thinking of doing this again (pleeeeaaass LOL), you can follow the wave and create the widest book holder for your new beastly 10-thousand-something-page book 🥲😂 just a suggestion~ btw, the final book looks weirdly AMAZING!
"Nori, stop playing with yourself ! " LOL !!
Can somebody pleaseee tell me the song at 9:57
Amazing work I love your videos. Thank you for sharing.
this is the kind of chaos i live for
That Nerdforge tshirt is super cool - I would wear that! Is it for sale somewhere??
Sad thing.. I’m a fan of these books, id buy this
Amazing... but hard to read in bed.
Ahem, would that thing break a guiness record of the longest book?👹
I love the idea making a book that, while technically readable, is practically completely unreadable. It's a beautiful art piece for sure!
"Watch the next episode where we build a contraption to read this book with. A handcrank will raise one platform and lower the other all while keeping the bend in the spine on some soft velvet so the art is safe." 😅🙈
missed opportunity to create a full circle with the wheel of time
This is the most amazing book ever seen in my life by the way thank you❤
What’s the sine teams latest installation? I think you’ll find it. Very intriguing. An educational. https://youtu.be/XN2zHpfcxOU?si=4pDyeQT7YFyeb_BM
Androl would be proud!
Have you heard of time team?
Everybody needs a slinky
First
Imma put the fun in functional.. but loose the ctional is for sure the funniest thing I've heard today! LOL!!!
If I had the skill, I would adore doing something like this myself
This is amazing, I am going to try this. My new coffee table book hehe. It's a true masterpiece.
This is the best thing ever!!!!
Your videos are very inspiring!
I love the mumbled "that's what she said" joke... 😂
Next project: A giant book cradle!
I question how well this monster book will hold up to actual reading,  but your creation looks amazing! You are very skilled.
more like block of time
I saw the thumbnail and thought 'She should have done that with the Wheel of Time series'. Lol.
This is an average sized wheel of time book, from my experience.
I liked my own comment
George R.R. Marten might actually be interested 😂
Very, very, very well done Martina!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
hate to the horus heresies as one book.
13:00 that's what she said
this entire video is a hate crime
You should use a sander to make the pages smooth.
So as the person who recommended the learn GILDING. I officially grant you the Honor of Being. Master Gilder!  Clap, clap, clap! Good job. PS- i hear they are doing another Open Sauce. I would love to see you guys again!
Ok, two of my favourite content creators sponsored by Displate on the same day ? That can't be a coincidence 😅. The second one is Josh from @Let's Game it Out, yes, completely different stuff.
When you realize it is thick enough to block tank's projectile...
it's no end, Wheel of Time! it's no begginin, so keeps spinning! Oh, the paint drys! There is a end!
It's a Book Slinky, A "Blinky"!!!
You think that's hard? Try binding together every book in the riodenverse (aka all the books writen by rick rioden) (But make sure it's in order or shite getts confusing). Actually, imma pitch the idea to my friends now and see who wants to do this with me
Where do I find music used in Martina's videos? It's always so magical and authentic!
Now do the stormlight srchives. that will be fun. ❤
I thought there were too many books in the series - now you have the solution. Nice work.
Light reading 🤣amazing, great job!!!!!
That's probably the most useless book on the world. But certainly one of the prettiest.
have made great progress not impulse buying but that is the coolest sweater and pants combo i have ever seen in my LIFE. AND IT'S 100% COTTON????? ORDERED THANK YOU and it's so cool that you designed them they are AWESOME!!!
Omg the edges would have put me over the top, I would have sanded them down lol beautiful project as usual! 💕
The book flipped open at 5:36 reminds me of a slinky!!! Edit: and then right after, you spoke my thoughts lmao
the 'thats what she said' that got cut off ;-;
How much huge book do you need?  Yes💅 (You are the coolest❤)
Your both amazing to come up with such a difficult project and the end result is WOW. Reading it on the other hand is well not even sure how you would start.
At first I thought this is dumb but after it was done, this is a great decoration piece. The back part of the book' it is truly amazing!!
You are incredible I absolutely love watching you create the most fantastic art! Thanks for another great video :)
How is it possible for someone to even do that!? Im always in disbelief that someone can be so incredibly talented like she is 💕
",,,this has to glue for a while... " :D
I've seen book like this. It was something like "Everything we know about women". It was tens of thousands pages and all pages were blank 🤣
It is THE GREATEST honor to have this work of art in our home 🥰 Watching you make it adds a whole new level of appreciation and admiration. BIG HUGS 🧡🧡
I bat youre sketch book set
Could you do a A3 or A2 book next?
To read it you can just set it on the floor, and when you have read a few books you’d need to set the allready read side on a chair or something
What a precious book, the one book to rule them all! Wow, that has a ring to it.
"Dwarf Fortress User Manual Vol. 1 (Abridged)"
I wonder what will you do if you would glue on of the books the wrong side🤔😁
Amazing job as always Martina!
I love your videos
love this crossover so cool to see daniel react to this
I wanna see someone do this with JRR Tolkien’s books to make a real-life red book of westmarch
Hey Martina, noticed you were wearing that wristband a lot through the video Don't overdo yourself please Hope it's feeling alright now
I hope that in 10 years when Sanderson finishes the Stormlight archive That you'll do the same
A leather casing with the buckle to hold together a book series like that would be good or packaging
challenge: fill it with words
Great video❤❤
Your merch looks so sick! Its honestly by FAR the best merch I have ever seen in my entire life! I hope its gonna be available for a long time until i have enough money to buy it ❤️
Shouldn't it be a wheel?
Just needs a couple of "desktop scissor lift tables" to read it 🤣🤣
Reading it is probably also a workout at the same time xD
You impress me with your skills in every video. Amazing work!
Thank you kindly as you say for brightening my day. Dang that would be so cool  if you did the same thing With David Mack's  graphic novels  Kabuki.  Be safe Rest well  & GB4N. Lady artisan & all.
Lol cool video
that is soooooooo sickkkkkkk i wanntt onee pllzzzzz
Long book is long 📗📘📙
What an incredible idea 😊 Maybe you could have used a CNC mill to flatten the side?
Thanks!
My two favourite YouTubers just casually collab! Love it
This turned out to be absolutely beautiful. The colors, the gold and the design are just amazing. Well done.
The word "amazing" keeps loosing it's meaning with every creation you make. 🙏
A few years ago i watched your video of bookmaking at first time. And two weeks ago i made a book by myself becouse of the inspiration you gave me. And today i see a nev video oh hilarious making of this masterpiece... and i just hope that after two years i would not repeat this ..)  nevertheless, thank you VERY much for every video you make and for every strange thought that knocking at the door of your mind! You are crazy, and i admire it!
Oh. My. <insert deity/higher being (noodly or otherwise)/great old one here>. What have you done?!?!?!?!? 😃 Edit: Forgot to say - This is awesome! Bonkers, but awesome! Also, I love the pronunciation of "wonky" with a Norwegian accent 😀
this is so dumb, i love it
On that note I should get back to reading wheel of time.
The abundance of skill and talent you possess is jaw-dropping. Well done!
2:33 The book tower makes me think of the cake in Sleeping Beauty 🤣
Someone get this to Brandon Sanderson
Omg nice to see Daniel lmao
As a professional book binder .....
This is insane I love it!!!
It doesn't have New Spring. It's WORTHLESS! Get it outta here! Do it again, and this time do it RIGHT!  Just kidding, this was a fascinating video to watch. It's so cool to see this actually done, and tbh I'm very happy Daniel got it, he deserves it. Now I just need to see Brando's reaction to this.
Too bad you didn't make it into a three foot tall illuminated version, that would be way better
I read the first few books as a teen and well, life happened. I never wanted to watch the show until I finished all the books. I’m feeling inspired and will have to start from the beginning again!
Love it. Not an artist of any kind myself, and crap at dyi. However... I wondered in Nerdforge's previous videos too, why not sand down or cut the books to align? surely we have margins, the text inside will be off centre just slightly... but on outside aesthetics will be better :)  Obviously, tell me off if that's just stupid for some reason, that I'm not seeing :D
I wanna try something like this so bad
Idk who he is, but this horrible unreadable book binding experiment still has to be better than the show
"So over the top, so dumb, and I LOVE it!" wow, sounds like the type of guys I was attracted in my 20s!
A world record has been set for "the most longest and the most stupidest (jk) book ever created
❤❤❤
Abomination indeed, but so freaking funny. Here is a design challenge: Do the same but invent a system where you can clip the individual books from the shared spine. I know, I just invented an unnecessary complex book-set case with a bendy back/outer book spine. It would be as aesthetically pleasing and awesome as this insane masterpiece while providing a slightly more convenient reading experience?   Or - maybe we should challenge you two to invent a magical book-set dispenser for when A Song of Ice and Fire is finished (that should give you ample time to work it out, as the final books may easily look like this monstrosity on their own). I want something that looks like this (a shared spine) but it will open secret flaps and push out the requested book upon request. (I think I have seen someone making something like this for a Blueray box set (?) but without the beautiful leather craft)  It would be a wonderful collab with our favourite "queen of shitty robots" btw while proving that Norrbaggare and Medel-Svensons can work together decades after "Selskapsreisen" was a success. (For those not getting the references, go to a Nordic library as I think the references may be too old for the internet).   Thanks for giving me the best 25 minutes of entertainment I will experience this weekend   (Oh - before I log off - have you ever wondered how these books would look like as a single "scroll of papyrus"? I certainly just started to wonder about this without any idea of how to make it without massive amounts of ugly scotch tape). As a person who likes to bring a book and read in a public cafe or on the bus while living by the slightly adapted words of beauty from the 1st Corinthians:   "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of all is the blue whale".   This nerdforge project is taking this motto to its natural consequence.
What about a follow-up video for this one, documenting Daniel's reaction to this "I made a 12.000 page bookbinding abomination" video...?
You made me cry while you made this Its so Beautifully done. When you said you where sending it to a Youtuber I wasn't surprised when it ended up being Daniel Greene
So at 6:00 .... why are you not binding the "first" and "last" pages together to make it.... a WHEEL? or circle.. whatever :)
OH BOYEEEEE they're my favourite books too and i'm super jealous! AMAZING job Martina and Hansi, you cleansed the books of power of Bezos' taint with your epic homage and the world is whole again.
The moment Martina said she was mailing it to a specific YouTuber, I KNEW it was going to Daniel Greene!!! Even before seeing that they listed his name in the section below the video!!!  I loved this! Excellent job!
5:13 The mad scientist contemplating her creation
That reaction upon receiving the gift was so fantastic ❤
Projects like this always make me think: "What would the creator/Author of it think seeing this?"  I'd love to see that with my works.
i wish robert jordan had lived to see this opus, this labor of love martina ps. it also makes a great workout routine
satan i gatan det ble sykt nais
"Mega dumb idea. What if we use ratchet straps?" That was my first thought
Why the hardbacks? 😭 I guess they were the only ones big enough, I just love that series and I’m hurt. Intrigued and here for it, but also hurt 😂
incredible crossover
I was laughing like 3 minutes 🤣
Why have I always wanted this?
That is absolutely incredible.  You are exceptionally talented and thank you for sharing.
i love the fantasy/historical side of youtube cause it takes extremely noble and traditionnal techniques to make the  ✨silliest✨ things, while still being some of the coolest things we'll ever see. incredible!
Some might ask "But, why?" The only good response is: "But, why not?"
It seems your creativity (both of you) has no bounds! fantastic once again!
Skjera bagera
Coucou encore une super vidéo comme d habitude ( Epernay pays du champagne dans la Marne France ) passe une bonne soirée
Has one guy really written that many books? :o
watched season 1 love it this channel keeps defying physics with fisics i love it lol
i love the outcome it looks so good!!!!
Skjera Bagera "hey i have ther entire series but in the las 8 or so books i have the logo of amazon stamped on it and i hate it may be you could show us a new way to fix this or rebind them i realy love my books and i realy hate that logo ruin it the covers, i hope thet this is a good idea love your videos by the way
Amazing, gorgeous, and completely impractical.
One of these days I'll finish the series. Very impractical but one of my favorite projects.
"It's pikachu!" ... I mean Daniel Greene...........
Amazing!!
yes folks we have created the world's first book slinky
Yay WOT!! AND Daniel Greene!! Amazing result. Love it!
"stupid projects require stupid solutions" 🤣 You invented the book slinky!
Just kneeeeew that’s who it was going to from the beginning. 😂  And MARTINA, THIS WAS SO FRICKING AMAZIIIIIIING!!!! The forklift that Jordan wanted for his final book is THIS! (Also, where’s New Spring?)
OMG!!!!! This is SO AMAZING!!!!!! You are so talented. I love Daniel green! This is epic!!
Its a book slinky!!! 😂😂❤❤
I wish I could live in your videos; the whole idea of Nerdforge was what I always wanted to do for living.
That is awesome!
Looks like a meme I once saw that said "tax declaration for dummies - pocket edition - volume 1 of 12" 😅
You could've made a contraption holding the covers that levels itself so the "book" never goes too heavy on the side with most pages.
To be dumb...is a very good video, thanks
I really hope you double checked you didn't get them out of order by accident.
This is oddly satisfying
You are a book murderer! 😮
Please colour the pages edges or paint a picture on it.
Of course it's the wheel of time. Bigger is allways better 😎
OMG the books are back and this is the craziest thing ive ever seen❤
I don't think words can express what I'm feeling right now😮
5:13 adventure time lookin ass book
Are those tattoos on her arm new?
I knew which youtober it was for immediately 😂
A slinky mechanism!… like a crank or jack that would raise/lower either side of the book would be the chef’s kiss on this.
I only found your channel because of your book shenanigans, and I am here for this latest adventure! Also, anything book related I send to my fellow bookworms with the message "she's at it again!"
I wonder if tattoo transfer carbon paper would save you a step when it comes to tracing? Put the carbon on top of the 'leather', print the design and stick it on top of the carbon, then trace it. You'd need a firm surface underneath though.   Actually on that line of thinking, I wonder if a tattoo machine would be an effective way of carving the 'leather'. I'm curious to try!
hilarious and epic build…and the prequel is only ~300 pages!
Ok, are you running out of ideas? This seemed like such a waste of your energy, time and resources. I think you two really need to challenge yourselves to come up with very different ideas for 2024. What about fantasy insprired furniture flipping, building models onto furniture, art bombing areas in your neighborhood with whimsical models hidden in plain sight, shadowbox art painted with working lights, etc. I really appreciate you sharing your amazing talents, but how many more unused books will you bind, and how many more gaming consoles are there to creatively cover?
So cute, it's an amazing project
Fantástico ❤❤💚💚💛💛🇧🇷🇧🇷
Awwwww Wheel of Time & crafting. Perfect combo Juniper books is shaking
I love youre hair
5:16 now that's what we called slinky books!
this is so fucking cool, you're so fucking cool!
Wow!
I absolutely love this. I’m currently reading the Wheel of Time series for the 2nd time. 🐉🪄🗡️📕
what the heck😂
Went into this going, "Tell me she gives it to @Daniel Greene. SHE DID!
Now if I can only get you to do my entire Shannara in Hardcover series  😊
I was trying to figure out who in the world the series could be going to and right as you were packing it I was thinking "it couldn't be Daniel... could it??" and then it was.  That was amazing!
i would be soooooo paranoid to glue them together in the wrong orientation or wrong order.
This makes me appreciate that the 14 books were broken down to 37 volumes in Germany.
Martina, you are so incredibly creative and talented!! Its such a joy to watch your videos!!
This was such a mesmerising video to watch! Beautifully done!!
Early?
now you need to make a book stand, like those 300-year-old book wheels, so that you lower and lift the book to read it. 😀
Did you enjoy reading the book 😂 I never stop laughing but you what looks absolutely amazing  ❤ it 😊
This is so dumb. I love it! :D I wish more people did dumb stuff just because they're fun. The world would be a much more ridiculous and fun place.
Literally the best gift ever
Amazing! Now I kinda really want to read the series.  ... oh, well. I'll add it to my ever-growing List.
And Harriet said it couldn't be done.
that one TV show "My Strange Addiction" but it's a playlist of all the bookbinding videos on this channel
Love love love that you gave it to him
Next dumb build is an adjustable reading platform for that book. Epic build and phenomenal leather work!
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
How much makeup do you need to cover the eye bags that you must have because these take you so long
Im kinda pissed you did not smooth out the difference between book sizes somehow but this is hella cool
That gives a new meaning to the term 'box set' :D It's absolutely AMAZING - well done and keep up the great creativity.
Just imagine, go to the library and ask for a book "The Weel of time" and the librarian gives you this 16:57 with serious face.
This is such an insane level of awesomeness.
It's kinda' weird how you watch people on YouTube and the familiarity makes it feel like you know them and they're an old friend.  But if you ever saw them in real life there would be an imbalance where you would feel like hey, buddy pal my great friend it's great to see you.  How are ya?  Doing good?... but they have no familiarity with you so their like hey, complete stranger this is very one sided because I know nothing about you.  You may be a nice person or a stranger danger alert.  I have yet to assess that since it's been 4 seconds that I have known you.
She never stops impressing me
But not the thickest book in the world. The thickest book in the world is 5,5 m thick and weighs 250 kg.
For projects like this, you *need* a lower table...
I have a book like this, it’s a 1915 century dictionary with every word that was in the English language of that time. The spine is over a foot long.
Now make the same thing with A Song of Ice and Fire, but with 3000 blank pages at the end. 😆
I've got another idea to make it yet more stupid 🙋‍♀️ make another one and paint the pages like in that video with the lotr hp books😊😊😊✨
Talk about a broken spine😂😂
I imagine a professor asks for a 12 page paper and you turn this in 😂. “Oops, I thought you said 12,000…”   Such an awesome idea and it turned out amazing!
Iss quit UnManjabLe...
🙋‍♂🙋‍♂🙋‍♂
You're actually crazy lmao. Good work!
That book is a manual on how to understand women...
as i read the topic i know what you had in mind 😀 and its awesome! Love it! i am reading the last book by now ;-)
This is so amazing. I continue to be amazed with how large scale some of your projects get, and this may not be a whole room, but I think it is still very much so an achievement
"That's what she said" joke straight up killed me xd
YAY BOOK BINDING VIDEO! I’ve missed the aesthetically pleasing leather working and of course the ✨gold leaf ✨
smart
Martina I finally got a picture frame for your painting in metric dimensions. I had to go to Canada for it.
What talent! WOW
when you opened it at the half it looked so goofy
Now make another with painted page edge and send it to Sanderson himself lol.
Having this sent to me right when I’m building my new bookshelf was just perfection. THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH!
Ugh. Why?
9.9/10...not even a wheel...very disappointed.  If you're gonna turn a giant book series into a giant book, why not the Malazan Book of the Fallen?
As a fan of WoT, this was a pure joy to watch!
It's always a great day when Nerdforge uploads!!
Wahou!!! Amazing Book! Great job. it must have been really fun.
next make a scroll out of it :) next time :) nice work :)
That merch looks awesome!
Loved the « that’s what see s…. » and the perfect cut haha. As always, great video !
Imagine if one book was out of order
MARTINA, I need to know!!! What boots are you wearing with the Cryptic Set? They are so cool, and totally complete the look!!
*requires a stack of books to read the stack of books
I was sooo hoping it's going to him haha. Looks amazing.
This thing looks like the slinky of books.
19:12 Heyson - Phasma, if someone wanna hear it :)
I wasn't the first, but I'm seeing it for the first time in such a short time since she published it, I've never been so happy, hail from Brazil, I love you ❤❤❤❤😢
🤯🤯🤯
Fyyyflate. Dette må jo gjøres med flere serier!! holy shid
I started learning bookbinding this september and I was kinda inspired by your videos on the subject
That's absolutely insane but so fricking awesome
👇Under an hour gang
Martina, Amazing as always. You never fail to brighten my day. I do wish you would reconsider the project I wrote you about. Stay Awsome!
Wonderful work Martina. But how can you read this book, lying in your bed? ;-) 🙂
the guilty party always holds the gun 😂
I'm just soooo giddy watching this! Every time Martina says "dumb idea" I'm in my head "No, no, amazingly creative! Yes, get those ratchet straps... yesssss!" 🤩🤩🤩
gurll you are so so creative, u really motivate me to make stuff myself. thankyou so much
Det var veldig bra! Bra gjort!
Hi Martina! Are you going to create/recreating landscapes or cities in the future? You should try to recreate Death City from the Soul Eater anime.
OH WOW! I don't think I can make a book like that, maybe I could try making a complete set in five big books. I am happy that the person who got your book of Wheel of Time. LOVE YOUR MERCH! With the weather getting me down I couldn't craft or paint anything, hopefully I'll get some art idea's and paint again & sell since I want to save enough money for future project idea's.
I love when artists take an outrageous idea and execute it so well this is amazing
Thats why box sets exist 😅. Nice project tho.
I was sure that you would've painted the paper edges
Me when I watch nerdforge videos and my mom walks in: " don't ahahahask (wheeze) 😂"
now we just need an apparatus, that allows reading that smoothly and comfortably. @simonegiertz
I love the end product!❤
Damn, Martina.  You really outdid yourself with that one.  Amazing!
Best thing ever. Think my book club will be mad if I make that my next choice?
"Let me get my staining supplies! ☝🏃‍♀" I love how excited she gets! XD
Imagine doing this and realizing u put the books together in the wrong order😮 😳🙀
Only 14 books?! You mean no New Spring? Oh no :( you will have to make it again.............. (kidding :D)
"ma'am why are u buying all these books" "uhh..... experiments......" also it hurts seeing all those books getting hurt but its for a good reason
"It looks like a pair of legs" GONK !
It could double for a slinky!!
Alexa Bliss swallows.
omg wow imagine if some artist did a flip book on that IT WILL BE  A MOVIE!!
How the Harry Potter books felt like as a kid:
. . The Booklinkie . . 😂
This is hilarious, Steven Erikson posted to facebook wanting to legit make a one novel edition of Malazan years ago (also around 11,000 pages)
That carving is 🤌💕
As soon as i read the notification for this video, i was like, "why martina?!"  Oh you really are something else 😅
I laughed so damn hard around 5:12 😂
Imagine the artwork you could do on the edges of the book to go along with your beautiful cover.
If you make a mistake in order the books, like 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7, you'll need to skip and search for them. Just like old music Cassette tape. Also, it's kind of a workout book... "Alright, it's time for some workout reading. Book, get ready." 😅
I want to do this to the Riordanverse books so bad, but they're still publishing lmao 😂
She made a real life version of that long book meme
If there was ever a zombie apocalypse I’m betting you’d stay alive the longest 😂 i love you to much
I have several, full editions of the wheel of time books as this is my favorite saga ! I'm very happy to see the final result of your work on this great piece of fantasy and also very sad to know I would never be able to add this book to my wheel of time, now dedicated, bookshelf. As usual, an incredible work !
NO! GOD NO! NOT WoT!
Oh I love this. I laughed, I cried, I’m not even done watching the vid yet.
Ah yes. Project earth before "volumes" were invented and patched into the "book" item. Such strange times.
Sadly can't watch this because YouTube thinks I'm using an Ad Blocker :(  They are killing the platform.
Ideas are only crazy, until you prove it actually works.
omg i'm impressed. Binding 400 pages without misalining anything is hard enough but this many without being like the width of a book off O.o  I imagined doing that with the 23 book of the series I'm reading currently and then i remembered that of the 10 books I own, almost every is another edition and even with the same cover, same year, same publisher, one is about double the hight of the other XD better not try it XD Kudos to you and happy to see more book related projects :D combining bookbinding with fandom love is the best
"Aaaaaand back to the project 👉👉" is still one of my most favourite parts of your videos!😊💜
Now bookbind all of Discworld novels into one book
You could paint such a big painting on these book edges! (Haven't watched the video yet so you might have thought of that already)
The wheel weaves as the wheel wills!!!
Your skills know no bounds...  I'm left speechless EVERY...TIME...
I forget whether it was Robert Jordan or Brandon Sanderson who said that Book 12 would be the last one even if they had to invent a new way to bind books to do it. Only then it turned out that that's exactly what they would have had to do, so the last volume wound up getting split into three anyway. I think both of them would approve of this.
wheel of time is such an amazing series! although i have to admit the first few books are kinda slow paced...  personally i dig the Amazon live action show they made, but ironically it seems like they are rushing through it and skipping lots of parts from the books.
That is a book that one has to read STANDING oml
9:22 so they poor vegetable oil over a cow and make it let a tan by sunbathing???
I think every professional bookbinder will see it :D
And that'd still be smaller than Stormlight 5
This belongs in a museum
😮
Oml I've read the wheel of time and this really puts into perspective how long it is😮
I really like your videos and ideas, I wish you continued success, I hope you will always be this smiling, greetings from Turkey.
As a long time WoT fan, I love this! I was worried for the maps, but I should have trusted the process. My WoT collection is a mish mash of paperback, hardbacks, different cover designs and digital books. I would definitely buy this to have the collection in my bookshelf as a decoration (and then read the kindle version because I-m not insane). Good work!
Well that was indeed, dumb
rip trees
WoT ❤
heeeey! quick question, where do you get your music from??? the one you use in your videos???!!!
It's Daniel green!!! I'm at 0:30 min and I'm 100 % sure 😊
Daniel Greene is a fake fan and nightmare.
Insaaaaaaaaaaane 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I like Martina a lot.
I can only imagine going on reading binge with this lol
so thats the davinci resolve user manual, i guess 😀
I was halfway to typing "SOMEONE LET THE GOBLIN KNOW" when she announced she'd be sending it to a "youtuber friend" so I relaxed and enjoyed the video :D
It's really cool 😎, you should do another sketchbook series
average stormlight archives book
😮 Good lord i want this so bad. Its so obnoxiously large and I LOVE it
5:13 literally the "how to understand women" meme's book 😂😂😂
That is so wild... I love it❤
that would take my mum i bathroom trip to read
“Stupid projects require stupid solutions” needs to be on merch
60TH COMMENT
Love her hair😫💜
Holy cow!!! 😂😂
She is casually making modern art at this point
It’s a monstrosity. I love it!
Want a challenge? Reply to me if yes
So cool
just saw this video on my fy and i was like "what in the actual fuck" 😂😂how do you always come up with these ideas?
Nice😹😹💜
I was just re-watching some of your old bookbinding videos today, so I'm happy to see this!:)
She finished making this faster than anyone has ever read this series 😂
Brandon Sanderson immediately sending this to his publisher to expand his word count for his next book 😂
"I'm gonna put the "fun" in "functional!" I love the way you said that. XD Don't you always, Martina? 💜
As soon as I saw "Wheel of Time" on the thumbnail I sensed that Daniel would be involved
THATS WHAT SHE SAID I HEARD IT I HEARD IT
You are madder than spam with an egg in it
last day of school homework be like:
You’ve suddenly made me feel better about the size of the books I bind😂
The only part that I felt a pain in my heart (hehe) was when Martina removed the covers, but the end result was amazing.
That’s a lot of knowledge
Thicc
Impressive! :D (Pls like + Comment 😢)  👇                      👇
Oh my gosh yay I finally got here early for once!! Best artist duo on YouTube!!
🇧🇷
we already HAD dictionaries
I am so glad this video came out when it did, I want to make a similar monstrosity to hold all my recipes and now I have the insight of how to do it 🙌 Amazing work, as always 💜
New upload! Yay!
This concept is crazy but you guys always manage it so I have no doubt you’ll knock it out of the park ✨
I've got two daughters and I'm going to need to send you a video of them speaking into a tiny shovel saying "back to the project!" And "and now for the final result!" They love your show keep up the amazing-ness!
Second!
Yeah new video!!❤
Wow! Yall inspire me! Can't wait to make projects like this one day!! 😊
So cool i love your videos and have been watching the for a very long time
Heyyooi🎉🎉
Like number 50!!! 😂 I love this channeeeeellll!! 😍🤗 Wait... First comment too? 😮😮😮
I’m early! So excited to watch this video!  IM LOVING THE FINAL PRODUCT ITS SO GORGEOUS. The bend tests are hilarious and I’m loving your pink and purple hair! Honestly wish I was the one getting it but it’s gorgeous!!  HIS REACTION WAS SO SWEET I LOVED THIS VIDEO
