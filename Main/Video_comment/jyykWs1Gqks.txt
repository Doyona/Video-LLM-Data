Use code EVANANDKATELYN50 to get 50% OFF your first Factor Box at https://bit.ly/3rtCbaL! Also for those wondering about Evan's back: it's pretty bad right now and still affecting how much he can do on a daily basis. Our video schedule might be affected while we're trying not to push too hard. Hopefully he can avoid surgery but only time will tell. We'll try to give more updates as we have them.
So, as someone who has family who woodcarves as a hobby... you're supposed to go with the grain. And take off little bits at a time. That one piece that curls up (7:18) is when Evan accidentally used it correctly - that's what most of the shavings from wood carving look like. The machine is screaming at you for using it incorrectly, lol  /lh
I am begging yall ro bring back the choose your weapon tool shirts 😭😭
Ive watched this video a bunch of times but i just noticed that at 1:07 Drill Guide isn't spelled right in the listing, its spelled 'Drill Guid', which really says something lmao.
On a serious note. For drilling you can get a drilling block at your local hardware for like eight bucks. Great for drilling straight
6:30 i thought it was evan screaming in lowercase lol
I actually use this pump all the time
6:20 the sound my brain makes as I visualize the injuries this thing has definitely caused. WAAAAAHHGHGHGH I feel like I sliced a chunk out of my index finger just from watching this
I thought Evan was screaming but it was the tool😂
as someone who has wood carving as one of my uni classes, just saint that it's much easier without machine :p
I have already watched this,  but watching again because it is so funny😂
10:20 i dunno, thats how i screw
4:22 it’s a standard format for flex shaft motors, REALLY common for jewelry!!  also straightup they’re more often used for metal! there’s points designed for wood but the edge geometry is REALLY different.   used correctly they can carve through mild steel like butter, but wood famously introduces INSANE friction!
There's no way that "weed" was going to come up with that tool. Those were tiny baby oak trees. Their roots are already probably nearly a foot down into the soil even when they're that tiny.
I pray that they returned all of these...
I think you sold the multitool hammer way short - look how much joy it gave you!
I think the idea of the hammer was so you don't hit your finger because that was the main problem
Katelyn fought for that (under $15) tooth and nail.
Does no one know that most hammers have a nail setter on top of the head of the hammer already now a days
You could probably make a better drill pump at home using a flexible tube, 2 bearings and a 3D print. It's ridiculous to try and use this kind of vane pump for a "motor" made for torque.  Edit: this is a peristaltic pump
6:30 i thought that was evan screaming for a moment
At least they’re cheaper than what Evan would get
Yea definitely not Editing
6:21 i thought Evan was screaming 😂 the wood sounds like him for some reason
Just wondering, has she tried drilling on a shorter surface?
Aah, I think you can flip the drill and have a lot more room for your finger. It's still crap but may work better.
this is my fav video!! who's with me??
Not that I think it would have changed the results even a little, but the drill straightener thingymabob, if it’s too tight coming from that angle (teehee etc), use it 180degrees opposite?
The “chisel” sounds like one of those disgruntled pugs
The 2nd product literally sounded like Evan screaming
I never get tired of you guys laughing so hard at the multitool. 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly, i thought the wood chisel/engraver was Evan making a screaming noise.
The drill handle should’ve been pointing the other way on that first one, you had the drill inserted wrong
❤️ Joob
That electric chisel looks like it carves worse than just . . . ordinary chisels. Harder to do, less control . . .  The first time I picked up old dry wood and tried to carve delicately, I made a very passable eye. With green wood, I found I could actually carve about as well as I can 3d model.
For a pump enthusiast, you need to learn about prime and priming the system. Add a Tee and a tank with a valve to flood the system. The liquid is the coolant and lubricant to stop the magic smoke from escaping the pump.
as much as that drill guide sucks, you're using it on the wrong side
I’ve seen those water pumps for water beds. My parents had one that you ran another hose into and the water flowing through the input would pull the water from the bed. An electric pump would have been easier and quicker imho.
sorry watching this randomly now....i have a version of the weeder thing -- but the brand i bought was grampas weeder....it is a wooden handle and good metal foot stuff -- its the best tool i have ever bought for gardening i swear!
In 13:32 the rating was 3.5 stars but you showed it was 4.5 stars.
16:30 for 10$ you get a proper pump already including a motor :D
The amount of unintentional dirty jokes in this "family friendly" channel are awesome lol that multitool is the dumbest thing ever 😂
did the wood sound a bit like evan or is it just me?
just think about it this way: at what comedy show, what date night, what theatre, could you pay $11.99 as a couple and laugh this hard?
18:05 WHAT!!!!!
The bench is too high for Katelyn and she's using the drill guide backwards...🤦‍♂
you kinda can't have air in the system when using water pumps.....
I don't think that was weed
ok so i have one of those weed pulling tools (one that’s actually made well) and they’re actually for larger weeds that have big roots that are hard to get out by hand. and when they’re actually made well they work really nicely! definitely easier than having to dig those tough roots out by hand. there definitely is a learning curve though and they’re not the most intuitive tool until you get the hang of it
15:18 you did not prime the pump. Especially with the long tubing amount. That makes its value very low. Might as well use any aquarium pump.
I usually don't say this, and I usually don't like content made by couples, but I really love watching you. You complement each other very much. It's like you were made for each other! Besides that I can not even imagine these videos being filmed without one of you being in the shot, unlike many other content made by couples. Keep on being cool and continue growing in YouTube space!
At 9:35 to be fair this tool could possibly work really well as a safe way to grip nails when you're starting to hammer them in for those that are always in constant fear of accidentally hammering their thumb instead (like me). 👍🏻 Beyond that use though, I agree it's a worse version of every other tool that it's supposed to be.
Her nose ring is unbecoming and she feels like she has fully lost any authentic connection with her audience she once had, -4/10
When I heard the sound the Electric wood chisel hanging mill grinding woodworking carver pedal control engraving machine wood chisel carving machine with handle 5 blades +foot control pedal made I thought Evan started screaming.
11:57 you gotta run away from the pain
6:20 i thought that was evan screaming  😂
RIP joobie joob
You put the drill in backwards for the first one
Carving doesnt make a mess 🤨😂
there are better drill pumps
6:55 BOBBY DUKE! BOBBY DUKE! BOBBY DUKE! BOBBY DUKE!
my family has an old fully metal step-and-twist style weed puller. you only step on it to help push it down through tough weeds.  I've pulled up thick tree roots and the stubbornest of weeds. it's lasted my whole life plus. I don't remember when we bought it; I was probably a baby. I tried to buy one recently but now all I can find is the crappy amazon ones!
i feel like the drill pump could be useful for gas siphoning maybe? but like, if you're the type of person who carries a full tool kit with not-just-car-tools in your trunk. like a quick emergency DISPOSABLE pump. If it did worked for resin it would have been useful for that.
It just occurred to me, are they using the drillguide backwards? If Katelyn held the drill the other way then atleast her knuckles wouldn't catch on the rod, I think.
2:55 - Ummmm... flip the drill 180 deg... 🤨
The workbench looks too high for Katelyn to drill straight down properly anyway. You need to be able to stand over it but...
flex shafts are really useful but i have my doubts about that attachment
A hammer that requires a second hammer
As a sort of beginner, if you do want to experiment with electric wood carving, try a Dremel and carving bits. The sort of swirly ones.
You know that saying "anything's a hammer if you try hard enough"? Prime Hammer™ just didn't try hard enough.
GOD you guys are obnoxious
15:00 yes i did notice the drill is spinning the wrong direction and you didn't talk about it
I wonder if the blade heads on the hammer hand piece was more for like Wax carving, looks like a jewelry motor
Helps if the people testing aren’t uncoordinated
Unless the electric chissel is like a tattoo machine... that stuff they sold is literally a scam by definition
5:25 The name just rolls off the tongue.  Absolute marketing genius!
For the drill press things put the drill on the other side so your hand isn't going between the rods. The pump might work better if you prime it and fill the intake hose with water first
Even : there is no 0 stars in Amazon so let’s give it a 1  Also Even at the end of the video : 0!
I love watching your videos, especially with my wife, it's always clear you're having fun together and it's wonderful to see :)
I love y'all, but they make drills with bubble levels on the back lol. You can also get circular bubble levels that you could UV Resin or hot glue onto the back of one of your drills for poor Katelyn lol. She can do the thing lol.
To be fair, I'm pretty sure that tiny tile would have split regardless of how you tried to hammer it.  I feel like there could be a tool like that that's useful if you need to properly center and apply good, even force on a nail or something but...obviously that ain't it.  Or if the weight slid more it'd be like a reverse deadblow or something idk.
Such couple gosls. I wish my boytoy wanted to do arts and crafts w me.  Honestly, he prob would if i asked him to but i dont work with amateurs. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🤣
The one of the reasons why Katelyn can't drill straight might be bc she is too short. The angle is way too high for her arm. She should try to drill at a lower setting to have more control.
10:57
Even: words are hard Kaitlyn: words are hard for Evan
Like any pump, you probably were meant to prime it
Surprisingly high ratings for things that are literal land fill material :| This stuff should be illegal for how bad it is :|
I want to see Katelyn drill on a table that is actually her size at some point
a screw driven with a hammer holds better than a nail tightened with a screwdriver
That hammer multi-"tool" was absolutely hilarious. I needed a good laugh, thanks!
15:20 I believe you need to prime it
You would drill a lot straiter if you used a table at an appropriate hight yours is too high
Hahahahaha that hammer bit was the funniest thing I've seen in months
When they titled the second tool "screaming splinter maker", all I could think is: what are we in for 😂
Pumps sometimes need to be primed, I wonder if that's where the problems lie
6:24 for a second I thought it was just Evan who was screaming 😅
oh, under 15 bucks, thats neat, 2nd item is over 15, checks out,
Regarding the drilling guide, the drill is supposed to attach to the body toward the horizontal bars. This would provide more stability when drilling and the vertical bars wouldn't get in the way of your hand.
Since i see u guys put  lil 10 mins videos behind a pay wall....well I'm unsubbed now for that, keep up the good work
Those Drill pumps are very useful if you have to pump liquids from containers out or into other containers and stuff like that, for example emptying a jerrycan into your car. My Guess is that those idiots writing those Reviews didn't read what this specific pump was made for. You cannot use every pump for everything. Some can resist Fuels and Oil, some cant, some need some sort of lubrication which water does not posses and this way the pumps get broken. And the thing deadly for every pump, Turning it without fluids inside, this will destroy the bearings, the seals and everything. The other thing is did they turn the Drill into the right side the pump needs, if they dont this can also be a factor that the pump gets damaged.    This is probably the reason why it just worked so short periods of times for all those reviewers or that specific pump is garbage.
I think I've watched this one a few times now.  Still makes me laugh xD
Fiskars makes an awesome weed puller.
3:02 You could just flip it
No joke a flex shaft is a good tool to have on hand
Honestly you guys are more generous than me with your ratings. I would give the electric carver a two for the ear abuse and the pump a three for only being able to handle water and leaving parts of itself in the receiving bucket (which would be bad if the thing you're pumping is for whatever reason for drinking).
Katelyn would have a wait easier time drilling straight down if the tagle wasnt at her friggin chest 😂 having to hold her arm so high up basically makes it impossible for her to aim it properly and keep it steady
That electric chisel sounds like what you'd get putting Toad in the FNAF Scooping Room.
Ah! You put the drill on the guide backwards. The trigger part should be facing the opposite side so your fingers don't get caught in between the metal rods. The drill guide is still cr*p, though.  🤣🤣🤣
"never run a pump dry" no one seems to know this here :)
you guys are so cute! lol I love that you play together. Its great that evan plays and doesnt need to hide his inner child behind to cool for school attitude most guys mask with.
also I meant to type Evan
y'all should make a t-shirt of even head and put on "TECHNIALLY"
y'all should make a t-shirt with just a big picture of even head and put on "TECHNICLLY"
Rip cheap ass pump. Love the testing method. if it cant pump rezin its useless LOL
Evan and Katelyn, when you test a pump again, Just use one bucket with the inlet and outlet in the same bucket will save you have to refill..👍😁
The 10 in 1 that was really 3 in 1 that was really 0 in 1 was absolutely killing me
Hi, I guess someone should mention that a regular waterpump isn’t very suitable for sucking water up a hose with an air vacuum. You should get the pump as close to the water as possible. It will work a lot better that way, especially when you want to pump a medium that’s much thicker than water is. I reckon it could pump resin aswell, but you just need a very short hose from the resin to the pump, or maybe find a way to submerge it.
@11:05 YouTuber dies from laughing
i have an idea for next video what about that you will have 40 dollars budget and you need to buy tools and other things to make battle who can make a prettier thing out of resin with 40 Dollars
In the 80's and 90's dont you remember the external frame that you used to get with your electrical drill from all the major tool suppliers?    It was a simple external frame that could be used for depth and  straightness.  Maybe you could do one for katelyn to aid her enthusiasm for drilling.
The weed puller is a knockoff of the Grandpa weed puller that is made of far better materials. The puller is made of iron. The Grandpa works great! But I only use it in my lawn not on mulched areas. It works best with dandelions and violets
You know? I think Katelyn has gotten better at drilling straight down. When I remember watching their first life hack vid, it seemed at a worse angle than this.
Человек тяжее члана ничего в руках не державший делает обзор на инструмент....
I wouldn't give any of these things more than 1 star on Amazon, honestly 0 stars would be better.  As for the "carving tool", 1 star, because almost any other real carving chisel would work better.
I really like your vids. Feel very candid and natural. Also, I am really happy it's just 2 of you and you are often seen filming with dslr. That's great
what's the point of this other then giving Amazon your money? seriously wtf
I’m sorry was that a list 25 into loop 😅😅
Love how these two crack each other up after all these years 😄
I love drill guid. Almost as much as lamp.
2 ratings..  1.7 stars..  How?!  To my knowledge you can only giver integer ratings so the only possible averages are 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5.
The multitool looks like something an Indian dude on tictok makes using a shop full of real tools.
Best E & K video ever!
i love how they couldnt stop giggling over the multihammerpliers
With that drill guide, I'm pretty sure you won't have issues with your hand hatting it if you use the drill on the other side. That said, it's still clearly garbage.
I wasn’t looking at my screen and when the wood tool starting making sounds I thought it was one of them screaming 😭😭😭😭
21:40 i swear there are products like this that actually work
17:40 Stuff :0
How did this Scoopy Doo get this perfect girl?
"I'm gripping you by the stem!" Had me cackling so much.
Not me, bedridden with back pain, suffering because I’m laughing too hard, seeing Evan in the same boat. I feel you, buddy.
The hammer at least keeps people from bashing their fingers open. Probably something useful for clumsy people.
The drill guide has since gotten up to 4 and a half stars, based on two reviews that essentially say the same thing. Worth it for the price. But the rest of the review, they both complain about the product and that it has no directions.
21:57 😭😭😭
21:52 😭😭😭
3 stars for the chisle, 2 stars for the hammer??? That is at least 0 stars... 😮 I think the waterpump is the only thing rated right... 😂
6:35 erm that’s not ment for wood, it’s a Lino carving tool that is electric. I think it means all it does by being electric is you don’t have to heat up the lino with an iron.
Have you looked into doing. Resin chess set?
Im in tears laughing please more of these
10:38 theWords are hard is so perfect in this moment
Y'all should do a video for wood carving! Not using that awful machine though...
That weed remover is just a cheap version of one that I have and it's much better. Even though I picked it up at a dollar store. It actually removes weeds. It's really good
when hammering into concert 1st you drill a polit hole and drive the nail in sharp hit... professional models use tiny caps to fire it in like a bullet ..and you would never hammer into something so thin and expect it to survive
5:58 he should’ve said “wood”. 9:55 protects thumbs for those who don’t like their thumbs hammered. I’ve seen some parents at Home Depot kids workshop that would love that instead of letting their kid hit them with the hammer. They looked at me like I was weird not caring my daughter hitting my thumb or finger.
I love you guys! If I’m having a bad day I sit and watch your videos for the 100th time. My sister and I watch you nonstop! ❤️
I share the horrible inability to drill straight down :(
I wonder if the first one was backwards.... Like she wasn't supposed to put her hand between the rods. To be fair they never actually show u how to use the thing
I am late to this one but if no one has said it yet….  The electric chisel is for fine details lol
the back pain and wheezing got me so bad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Drill pumps are terribly handly for quick jobs or when you don't have electricity nearby. Just a drill and a hose to get water upwards. Ofc you want to prime the thing or you're going to burn it out no matter the material. Preferably buy something of quality plastic like Gardena or a metal one.
The advertising on the box for the multi tool sound like me trying to come up with recycled answers for a history project 😭😭
Sorry guys but.....your carving tool, that sounds like a dentist's drill, has just woken TC, my cat.  He says, TC that is, that he is going to put a report in to your Supervisor Joob. Love your channel....from Yorkshire UK xx
Now you should buy vs diy the drill straightener for future use
Wood carver go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Put the drill in the other side! 🙈
You guys are so inviting and happy. I want that. Evan, you remind me of my family doc. He’s one swell dude and so are you. Congrats on your channels success!
😂😂 The Hammer
First one said it's a Drill Guid. 😂 That's on the consumer to still purchase that. 💀
Y'all just got me with a more targeted ad than Google with personalized ads turned on and a year of data could ever dream of! 😂
If you put resin through those hoses you will never get the resin out
Thanks for the lols 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Evan= we can't rate it 0 cause there's only 1 stars or above! *later in the video* Katelyn= you wanna rate it? Evan= 0!!
At 3.39 the reactions she had over the drill were so hot..... That they decided to have a quickie, Because they swapped sweaters
Evan’s optimism is truly inspiring
Laughing so hard your back pain kicks in is my kind of laughter x'D Oml
18:57 I've got one similar but better quality it's amazing
So, the multitool is a hammer, that needs a hammer to work. It's a screwdriver, if you add a screwdriver to it. and it's a pair of pliers, but they don't work without proper pliers or a vice..... Yyyyeeeeaaaahhhh.......
Lol as for your knuckle getting in the way because of the guide rods you should have 180 the drill and drilled it from the other side because that is how you are meant to use it if you have to use it because you guys are right it looks and is made terribly
I never thought I would laugh this hard at a multitool.. Sorry, I mean at a hammer-pliers-hammer-pliers
I luv u guys and ur crafts and creativity
With the wood carving tool I thought Evan was going to crawl out of his skin hahahah
The drill pump would be amazing for changing fish tank water 👌🏼
I think you are supposed to turn the drill 180°, so the handle is not between the two posts.
I have a GOOD one of those weed pullers, and it's actually great! That one though... that's terrible.
...if you guys are gonna get a woodcarver thingy, bobby duke arts I think it's spelled? Collab rn, and love you guys lol. the only sponsors I can watch and I think y'all are like my comfort channel, something like that
couldn't you turn the drill around 180 degrees so it doesn't hit your knuckles?  Still a piece of junk, but just wondering.
That was definitely a DeWalt drill. The battery, 5 AH or 6 AH? I'm just asking because I use DeWalt also.
Most water pumps need to be primed and will die VERY quickly if they’re run dry. Wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people killed the cheap drill pump through user error without realizing it.
Does pulling out fingernails count as “pulls out nails”? Maybe that’s what the second pulls out nails was for.
I was confused on one of your past videos when someone said they’ve stripped a nail. Now it all makes sense.
I could not find any videos where you used Thick-it to make scorch gel. This is just Thick -it, water, ammonium chloride, and a little dye, so you can see where you put it. this is applied to wood with a stencil. Once it dries, you remove the stencil and heat it up with a heat gun. The result is similar to wood burning. I made a few gifts with this before I got a laser.
LOL ok with the woodcarver that looks painful to use but when you carve with tools its just like anything with woodworking you need ear protection.
e & k losing it over the hammer that is also a hammer and a hammer but also pliers and pliers is my new favorite piece of media
omg evan just lost so much at the hammer(5x) screwdriver (5x) thingy I cackled together
calling it now, they have the drill running backwards x.x
“Wood carver” but in the voice of the witch from brave
Could the drill be turned the other direction relative to the frame thing for the first one? So the handle misses the guide rails?  (Not that it would probably do anything to improve the thing 😅)
10:56 I’m crying dying laughing with you both 😂😂😂😂 11:57  the editing here killed me off 😂😂
As a goldsmith, that "wood carving tool" is just a very cheap version of one of my primary tools that I use for pretty much every piece of jewellery I make. I recognized the handle the second she pulled it out. Very hilarious to see it advertised this way and used so bizarrely. Maybe some wood carvers use a flex shaft as well, but I'm much more familiar with it being used to drill, sand, texture, shape, and polish metal at my bench.
Edibles
I keep coming back to this video for the hammer that is also a hammer and also a hammer
Evan and Katelyn videos are hilarious if you assume they're high.
I wonder if the drill pump could be used to get a siphon going.
I found you after listening to you on lateral. Fun video
5:10 in his defense, a flex shaft can be used for so many things!  Also, that foot pedal sound is the same sound mine makes, and my flex shaft is a $200+ foredom flex shaft (I use it for metal smithing) 👩🏻‍🏭
I’ve grown up watching you guys, y’all are so underrated
do you think you could've used the drill guide  holding the drill the other way around like not in between those metal rods
Sunken Cost fallacy in action!
i wish they'd opened up the pump casing to see the state of the pump at the end. its screws are Right There
You should prime the line first for the drill water pump
Rewatching this a month later and I just remembered that I struggle with drilling straight down as well.  That’s why my wife and I got a drill with a bubble level in the back of the drill.  Align the bubble in the middle and you’re drilling straight down
Evans laugh is contagious🤣
cant believe i’m just now finding your channel after the safiya collab! i know what i’ll be binging now for the foreseeable future 🥳
One time I tried to find a lunch box off Amazon and the photo shop was so bad they put 7 and a half sandwiches in one segment
Um, that hammer thing is pretty awesome from one standpoint. It saves your fingers and thumb from destruction...lol
Thought it was Evan screaming 😅
I have just discovered Evan and Katelyn two weeks ago and I have not stopped watching them since so comforting and funny such good content guys x
Evan: struggling to pull the screwdriver out of the multitool Katelyn: pulls it out immediately  Evan: 'you're so strong, I couldn't do it!' 😂😂😂
The weed remover actually looked like the thing my household has (??) I can't tell the exact difference but the thing my family has is also a claw-grabber thing with a peddle to step on - that you're actually supposed to step on after you've aimed it at the weed. It worked great pulling out dandelion from the lawn, and dandelions have notorious long root and very spreaded (and nowhere to grab) leave so I'm guessing this might be a cheaper version imitating that real tool? I had a lot of fun playing with that tool when I had spare time when I was in high school so I remember it super clearly xD
I have a weird idea, could you guys put a fresh Rose in liquid nitrogen put it in UV resin suspended or code it and then cure it in UV resin and then see what happens, and then if you guys want you could also use a 2 part resin.
Officially one of my favorite of your vids!
I have a weed puller like that - except it didn't come with a pole, I attached it to an old broom stick. I love it. It works really well for certain kinds of weeds.
What did I just watch?!?
The first tool is very human in design!
06:20 I though that sound was Evan screaming xDD
for some reason "↗️NOT how you do it" has had me in tears for about fifteen minutes, just something about the way its synced to the music gets me. beautiful bit of editing.
Have you seen Adam Savage's tour of his workshop? Historic & impressive.
I'll create a new comment, why not,  I own the drill pump, I bout it 3 years ago, It does work but not for long, I think I got 5 uses out of it for just starting a siphon for a few minutes each time. So yes it works but not for long, you gave it a fair rating,
YouTube recommended your channel to me. YT has annoyed me a lot lately, but the recommendation has turned things around. I have been watching your videos through the day and they are very fun and entertaining,  It's like the best parts of Jenna Marbles meets the TKOR from 2 years ago.  I am so happy I found your videos,
Cool
That caving thing looks like it will carve lino
Just discovered you all, and I haven't laughed so hard in a while! I'm a cook, and I would cook dinner for y'all any day!
use resin or 3D printing to make your own resin-pump?
I'm the same as Evan, I say "technically" whenever something can kinda sorta do what it's advertised as being able to do
I’m going to buy that hammer hammer multi tool for all my friends
Did no one notice the shirt switch?
Why does the wood carving sound just like evan screaming
10:35 😂😂😂😂😂 Evan losing it absolutely killed me
Why not fasten the base then turn the drill 180° so your fingers are caught between the guide rails
omg the sound the wood carver made- i was away from my phone and listening to just the audio and i thought it was evan making the noise 😂😭 then i realized it was the chisel..
"I would give you a zero, but thats not possible. So i give u a ONE."
You guys look so happy about wasting money! 😅 what did you do with the products?
Wait wood craving is considered mess free? Out of all my projects it’s the most messy. I love it though, well kinda. I think I will love it alot more when I’m actually using equipment. I don’t even mean the right equipment either. I just mean equipment, I’ve been using scissors, and a pencil shapner blade. With a lot of bandaids I use them for many reasons. I have extremely sensitive skin, I have to use them for pencils, even with a rubber gripper.
It's so nice to have a channel in can consistently enjoy no matter my mental health because it's just wholesome shinnanigans. Incredibly appreciate ❤
The last product I bought on amazon came with a offer for a 30 dollar gift card, all I had to do is give them a 5 star rating with no commentary included so they could attach the 5 star rating to any product they sold. So much for the rating system if people will sell themselves.
Here me out: a really awesome resin version of trash man with embedded googly eyes✨
At least the tool wasnt photoshopped into the box too 😂
I have 2 multi tools that are also hammers. And they work a lot better.
My fiancé now asks for me to put on your videos when we eat dinner ❤️ I may or may not watch all the time
As a fyi, factor, now being owned by hellofresh, is a negative thing.  My family had severe issues trying to one pause a hellofresh subscription while on vacation, and two cancel it.
Katelyn could probably drill straight holes if she had something to stand on.
As a 6' tall guy with long-time back problems (no more), who spent way too much on chiropractors, I would love to give you some tips about what solved it for me. It's a stretching technique, and it's totally FREE! Just want to give back for all the entertainment you've given me.
To drill straight it would help if you did it on a lower work top. This one is definitely made for Evan's height and Katelyn has to hold the drill above shoulder height.
These two are not very bright and should NOT be testing stuff!    First off, the dude wouldn’t of even been able to pull the nail out with the actual hammer since they put the nail into a small block of wood that he can’t hold down securely, that prevents leverage against the nail!   And then the pump?!  Dude, you have to prime the damn thing first!  Liquid has to be inside the pump. Otherwise it’s just pushing around air, not fluid!      These two are painful to watch.    . . . Idk how a pump works!!   wtf!?!   😆😆😆
I have you set tool and it actually works really well
Because all you're going to do is really anger people who know how to use a toll
And please learn to use them before you start making videos like this
Another such thing as instructions on how to put stuff like that together right
By the way when you all banged on that with a hammer it ain't going to go in straight now at all ever
Not everyone has the same amount of money you all do the Ford expensive tools
I've used a drill pump before to send water outdoors from a plastic tub used to catch water from a bad roof leak in a commercial building. you should really have a much shorter hose on the inlet, just long enough to reach the bottom of the vessel. the outlet hose can be much longer though.
Look you guys seem to be goofing around and not properly testing the stuff. The chisel looked to be working but you guys were putting too much pressure.  The drill press you had the drill in the wrong way and did not calibrate it to be true. The water pump you are supposed to prime the pump first and start off slowly as the fluid builds pressure it also is not ment to be at top speed.  So my question is if you are crapping on these products would it be fair to say we tested them correctly?   I mean looks more like a vaudeville act than test... if so was funny
All those pumps (motor powered included) need to be primed first
enjoyed your video. keep them fun.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, but the screaming around 7:00 from the wood tools... Oddly relaxing to me... I'm not sure what that says about me 🤣😅🤔
Are they father and daughter as she looks way younger than him.
For drilling I found an interesting tool called Bullseyebore.
Most pumps for liquid require priming. They won't pump air. I'm surprised it worked at all and not surprised you burned it up. You probably needed to submerge the pump or find some other way to fill the hose and pump with water before you began spinning it. It MIGHT have lasted longer that way.
Really poorly made tools. inappropriate materials as well as terrible phisical design almost tells its own story. how about showing an effective tool alongside the junk?
Turn the drill around the other way.
Evan definitely got a bollocking for that $60 when the cameras went off 🤣
At this point Amazon is on par with Temu and on its way down to the depths of Wish.  Is Wish even still around?
Word working of any kind will generate a mess.
6:22 It's sounds like Evan screaming
for the water pump you should also try to use smaller amount of hose and/or put the water you are pumping higher than the container you are pumping into
I really wanted to buy that hammer, but you didn't provide a link..sheesh.
2:58  Uh, maybe try using it the right way round?  The product looks kinda cheap, but come on.
even if you COULD use the pump for resin - it would be for one use only.  How in the world would you clean it and the hoses out aftewards???
words are hard so its my wiener
At least with Temu, if you're not happy, they'll credit your money and tell you to keep the item.  //  (They don't accept a '0' so I'd say a .5 is the least you can give - they do accept 1.5)  The 2nd one should be a .5 - they lied when they didn't say it was just an 'attachment' to another tool.  With the attachment, maybe a 1. - The 'multi-tool hammer' is a .5 . - The drill pump - depending on how long it lasted for just water - maybe a 3, a 5 if it lasted for 1/2 hour? - Weed puller .5 .
people are totally inept,  not really testing anything, just making a mockery
I'm not sure if anyone else has commented on this, but you were drilling from behind the drilling jig. Have the drill handle out front to allow your hand some space. I'm sure it will improve the accuracy of the jig 🤣............... not. EDIT: I'm not the first to mention this.
The pained “Ooh, you did it, you’re so strong”, left me breathless. 😂😂
Cool! They took the fun out of woodcarving. Just what I was waiting for!
Why americans dont read the measurements??? You know how big it is... never look at the pictures...
Factor is fantastic but its like 120 bucks a week
I legitimately thought the sound the wood carver made was just Evan shouting at first. o_O
6:20 LOL I thought that was Evan screaming for a second XD
The wood tool screaming sounds like it could be evan😂
So four stars aka 80% for a pump you can use once and doesn't even work properly. Really not sure about your ratings.
I thoroughly enjoy my nail polish bottle as a nail polish AND a hammer way more than that hammer tool. Also, use at your own discretion. I just use it for hanging up framed art/pictures. So not very large nails. Would not recommend you use it to hammer any thick nails(metal nails, not finger nails), especially into would. Drywall is fine, or if using a thin-ish nail.
Oh no 😂 I'm laughing so hard at the hammer hammer hammer hammer plier plier plier screw driver that I'm wheezing and coughing 😂😂😂😂 10:52
How did you give that chisel a 3 ! It didn’t work !
Now it make me want to see a video about u 2 DIYing by adding your ideas to these to improve them?
I swear the chisel sounds just like Evan yelling... XD I initially thought it was him just being enthusiastic about it working.
You guys are so wholesome ❤️ I love watching your videos that laugh was so honest 😂❤️
You'll having way too much fun, great reviews.😂
Do not use resin on the pump it will kill it after the resin dries you wont be able to turn the fan
Pretty generous ratings. 3.5 for something that worked for 5 minutes? No.
You need to prime the pump
Flipping the drill in the first one whould get rid of knuckle on metal action, but still looks horriable, remove all the plastic and exchange for resin, wood or metal maby itd be sturdier
So a few thoughts: Drill press:  The drill should probably have been rotate 180 degrees so your fingers didn't hit the bars.  That being said, looks like it's too cheaply made to be worth it. Hammer thing:  Only real use might be to hold the nail while hammering.  That being said you can do that with pliers too, so yeah. Drill pump:  Not saying *this* drill pump, but there are some that are actually really useful to remove small amounts of water (up to ~ five gallons) from areas where you can't easily get a normal pump in.  Also, as with any pump, it helps to prime them if at all possible so you aren't trying to pump air.  That's probably why it struggled with the 'thicc water'.    Still an entertaining video though.
How is it that the drill at 6:30 literally just sounds like Evan going AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Second tool is what happens if someone sees a dremmel tool and then makes an entirely new version. From memory. Oh and they are 4
when Evan was carving I <3 U, I thought it was HELP at first lmao
How stoned do you guys get ? You’re both awesome I  have no clue how this came across my feed but you gained a new subscriber
As a Carpenter I couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂😂at the"multi-tool" .
The chisel machine sounds like a screaming marmot.
NGL I legit thought the sound from the chisel tool at 6:21 was Evan yelling “AHHHHHHHHH”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 like he even makes the same noise at 9:16🤣😂🤣
The drill pump actually works well with a quality pump
Thwse two are insufferable
The Multi Hammer was awesome. It’s a hammer, hammer, hammer, pliers, hammer, and pliers. Lol
For the drill straightner, you used to get drill straight rods, with measurements on them.
For the drill press you probably need to rotate the drill 180 degrees for more clearance with the drill. With that said it's too flimsy to be accurate so it's likely not helping much.
Pls make this a regular segment. 😅
Since im sure cat fur ends up in 99% of projects, why not try to make jewelry or something integrated with joob hair. I have some ideas
The drill couldn't have just been rotated about the chuck axis by 180 degrees, to increase hand space?
You should put a Christmas tree in resin
just a W stands for win or that something is good
For will it rice crispy we had a good idea... How about nuts? A lot of varieties to pick from and can do a nut allergy friendly version with toasted chickpeas!!! Also... For valentines or easter you could try it with chocolates or candys
are you maride
the first one they spelled guide wrong
Katelyn: "You wanna rate it?" Evan: *Staring intensely into Katelyn's soul* "ZERO" I wasn't expecting the video to just end after that 💀
next  challenge take all useless tool and see if they can make it better
They should make a video where they have to make something with all of the worst gadgets they have
Somebody probably mentioned this already but some drills have a built-in spirit level. That's probably the easiest way to make sure you're drilling straight down. It looks like there are also stick-on levels you can stick on the back of your existing drill.
Technically it did work, even though it made me sweaty and uncomfortable.
I recognize that Adam Savage has that one book “Every Tool’s a Hammer” but I think that one multitool took it to heart a little too much
you could've just put the drill on the other side to have more room for your hands, on that first one....
You'll NEVER learn to drill a straight hole (vertical orientation) if you're starting with your drill hand level with your head.  This poor girl has never had a good teacher.
Proof once again that Amazon is slowly but sure just turning into ridiculously marked up AliExpress. I loved how in the beginning Evan was like, "Well you can't give zero stars on Amazon so..." Cut to end, "ZERO!"
I thought that wood carving noise was Evan screaming, the pitch sounds remarkably like his voice  Also why does the multi hammer look like a speculum from my nightmares
Ok really though a good flexshaft can be great
Bruh I really love the way you edit videos but this one is top notch!!
First off, I absolutely love this channel and they've generally really helped with my mental health but also, in the back of the studio on wood stand thingy they have EK for Evan and Katelyn.  In Afrikaans (a language originating from Dutch mainly used in South Africa which is where I'm from) EK means I.  So everytime I see the sign I just think, I.
I humbly request ya'll complete a project using the hammer that's a hammer that's a pliers. LOL! Evan in his *engineer panic* was hilarious!
Hay I'm no expert but I just wanted you guys to know thows aren't weed around your tree there small sprouts probably frome the tree
I’m being told that you used the weed tool wrong from a friend that very passionate about this product
You could cut better with that woodcarver off I bet
Anyone else think the chisel screaming was Evan making sound effects for a minute?
6:21 *looks down to see why Evan is yelling* oh
The soy..
Hahahahaha, the hammer/wrench! I have a hammer that has all kinds of sizes of screwdrivers inside the handle that I got at the 99 cent store but it does not have a pair of pliers. lol
I build a lot of things in the wild, which includes a lot of hand carving. There are several secrets to it that will make the carving tool you bought work better for you.  The first thing is that each piece of wood has its own character in the grains so that it will make terrible chips and splinters if you carve it in some directions but it will carve nicely and smoothly in other directions. Just experiment with each piece of wood and, if one direction doesn't carve smoothly, try another one until you find the directions in which the wood carves nicely. Eventually, you'll start noticing various patterns in the kind of wood you're using that will help you figure this out better when you first start carving but, even if you don't notice that and chip the wood on your first try, you can usually fix this once you find the direction that works. In my experience, it is usually perpendicular to the grains of wood and from the outer part of the branch towards the center with the direction often shifting at the pith (which is the center of the branch and I've only carved wood I've cut down myself so I don't know how to tell this on pre-cut wood).  Another thing is that you don't want to try to remove too much wood for every cut so you want to make many shallow cuts rather than trying to quickly remove the wood you want to carve away because trying to remove too much at once will also cause it to chip and splinter instead of resulting in a smooth surface. If you do need to cut a lot of it off, use an axe or a saw or be extremely patient slowing carving that part off. Personally, I do parts like that with my hatchet.  Also, make sure your tools are as sharp as you can get them because sharper knife is safer than a dull one because a dull one is more likely to catch and then pop off of the wood and onto anything in its path after that. I've caught myself with my knives before and even my folding saw and they'll give you quite an impressive cut if they catch you. So you also want to think about where your knife might go if this does happen and then make sure either not to carve in the direction of any of your body parts or, if you do carve towards yourself, make sure that you have something preventing the knife from popping off and cutting you This can be accomplished by certain positions of holding your knife and the piece of wood or by having something that will stop the knife before it can cut you. There are a number of excellent tutorials about all of this on YouTube, which is how I learned.  Once you get the hang of it, carving is actually pretty fun. It does make somewhat of a mess, though, because you end up having loads of wood shavings everywhere and they screw up the vacuum if you try to clean them up that way so you want to either be outside or in a place where you can sweep the shavings up. In any case, that machine will be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it and I think you guys will enjoy all the things you can make with it as much as I enjoy all the things I've made with my hand tools.
That "electric chisel" is the WORST version of that product that i have ever seen
6:20 i wasn't looking at my screen and I legit thought that was Evan screaming for a good 5 seconds
15:14 - "Is it succc-ing at all?" Yep. Sucking BIG TIME, just not in the manner intended.
Man, if only you could use the drill straightener the other way around so your hand isn't on the same side as the rods 🤔
Whenever life gets a little too stressful, youtube redirects me to your videos again and I end up rewatching anything that gets thrown at me. True comfort content. Thank you so much for doing what you're doing!! <3
6:17 I THOUGHT THAT WAS EVAN SCREAMING
now that you have an electric chisel, you should do a wood carving video! :D Maybe make a tiny Joob that you can rub catnip into
love how the multitool got the best out of Evan hahaha
Evan reduced to soundless laughing/gasping is probably the best thing ever.
So the drill one in the beginning, why not rotate the drill 180 degrees so you hand doesn't hit the rods?
If used wrong enough, every tool is a hammer.
You put the drill into the straight down drill guide 180 degrees off of the orientation you were supposed to...but it is still a cheaply made flimsy piece of junk.
For a second, i thought the screaming chisel was a screaming Evan
Why do I always get woodworking ads on ur videos
Hi guys! I’ve just had a baby in November and I wanna thank you for providing me some much needed entertainment throughout this difficult time! I’ve watched you for a couple years now and I always find myself reverting back to your content. I must’ve watched each video 5x over 😂 hope you guys have a merry Christmas 🎄
People who actually use tools should do tool reviews
My neighbors early early Sunday morning every freaking week - 7:03.
I love that the english amazon product descriptions are messy to begin with, which explains why they are even worse, yet hilarious, in other languages XD
i was distracted eating while watching this and i literally thought the first wood carving machine was evan screaming. it took atleast 10-15 seconds to understand what was going on
Funniest try it episode while y’all were laughing at the hammer(3)/Pilar’s(3)/screwdriver/ nail and wire cutter😂 I was tearing up from y’all thank you and keep doing great things
That motor sounds like a dremal
hope everything gets better soon, all the luck in the world
At the end, Evan looks like if the singer from System Of a Down was a middle-aged dad and i love it
Not a member, but I saw the title for your recent member post. My (37) spouse had spinal fusion surgery last February. If that’s anything like what’s happening with Evan, I’d love to offer support and encouragement. What to expect and advice if requested.
About 5 times slower than a normal chisel although you were using the chisels upside-down
The real version of those weeders actually work really well, but not the cheap Amazon one apparently 😂 I think they’re called like grandpa’s weeded or something.
Idea of a craft make a colourful catnip figure/sculpture/2D/3D (what every you want) of jub
That electric chisel wasnt a failure! It just came with the game "operation" pre installed !
Yall are helping me through covid right now
" I think I heard a little creak"   that was his back ;P
no subtitles this time :(
If you don't know what the actual use case of a tool is, don't review it. You seem like nice people, but this content is useless.
E: How many multi-tools do we have in the house?  in T2, when they're wiring Cyberdyne with explosives, John Connor looks at the security monitor, sees police arriving on-scene.  He says "we got company"  Mom asks "police? how many?"  his answer is the same as my reply to your question, "All of them? I think"
To be fair to the drill pump, I believe you are meant to lubricate it fairly regularly. That said, it is junk, and deserves a 2.
I think the problem with the pump is that it's a submersible pump and breaks quickly if there's any air in it. The new issue being that your screwdriver isn't waterproof. It'd probably work great with underwater motors bolted to it but those cost more than a dedicated water pump.
i had a good drill pump made from metal and used it to empty horse water troughs to clean rather than a bucket also they often need priming
You needed to put your foot on the pedal for the last item
7:31 well, you're not using an engraver correctly, that's for sure
Rip eavreone elce that was whereing headphones dering the wood carver 6:19 - 6:28 and afie seconds after of more testing of it. Also rip even and Kallen they had to hear it full volume in real life
I have used a drill pump that worked amazing just don't full throttle it there are plastic parts and the drill is designed to put out a lot of torque and or speed
I like how the "Drill Guid" is specified as (Gules), like it's some kind of a heraldic emblem.
10:23 😂😂😂😂😂🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 10:45 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂❤❤
The concrete nail has me dying
when you were using the wood carver I tho Evan was yelling
2 ratings - 1.7 stars? That's not possible.
Is the drill required to be between the 2 metal posts or is that just how she chose to use it?
w means win Evan
So for the “wood carving” tool you may want to look into how wood carving tools are supposed to be used and then reevaluate the tool. Just a thought.
The woodcarving tool sounds a little like a pug 😂
man the second product hurts my soul. I did printing in college and one of the printing techniques I studied was wood cut where you use tools  similar to that, the fact it is electric and  vibrating seems to only make things worse, i'd rather spend the time filling the chisels to make than sharper. The handle for the knifes seem to be very good for grip however. I'd spend just the 12 dollars and leave the electric part behind. xD
This made me laugh so hard I literally couldn’t breathe!!! The hammer and hammer and hammer was the best
Oops misspell oh well
Factor is like ramen but way healthier but I'm a picky eater so I'm not Buying it And I'm 11 years old so I can't even get buying if I want to
I'd like to see an autopsy of the pump!
12:53 Man.. I was really hoping for a "NAILED IT!" comment.
That first one isn't a guide, it was labeled as a guid
I thought it was Evan screaming at first
Hey, what a coincidence! I have that EXACT SAME sweater!
The "outro" got me.
Amazon tools not from a major brand are a notch or two below harbor freight. They are good for making landfills bulkier.
Look who never primed their pump
The wood carver sounds like a screaming goat 😂
you should give the hammer an extra star just for being able to hammer a screw :))
Was the money spent?
Love your video but are your glasses safety glasses?
I love your all’s videos. They bring joy to my day! Ps. You should get into the commercial business 😆
With a little bit of modification, that drill pump is actually a really smart idea. Like people who own fish tanks have to do water changes, and that could make it so much easier! Or even filling a fish tank
I swear that the first couple noises the carving tool made sounded like Evan holding a sustained yell.
You should take apart the drill pump and make it out of resin so that it's much more versatile.
Question 🙋‍♀️: That back pain was close to the kidney. Do you guys have any kidney stone history in the family.   This could just be random and you don’t need to pay attention to this, just an idea. I have dealt with 6 kidney stones and 1 kidney bolder in the last month and I just was wondering because that was the same exact place my pain was.  But it could just be random back pain, just wanted to ask.
I think that's the worst reviews. Not the best products but not the best knowledge of what they supposed to do.
[11:55] Evan drinking 'Health Potion'
[10:44] I couldn't tell if Evan and Katelyn was laughing at Evan's back pain or how terrible the hammer/pliers were. 🤣
3:00 maybe you put the drill on the bracket backwards? Maybe the drill should be above the extendable foot? Seems like that would at least solve the finger space debacle...
drill guide: guide rods prevent finger from pulling trigger.  solution: either turn the drill around the other way, OR lock the drill ON, then you don't need to keep the trigger pulled.
The wood carver sound was giving me flashbacks to middle school when we had to design and make wooden CO2 cars and all class long it was the sound of a saw against wood and the smell of burning wood. 😂
I know a good amount of people who use that drill pump for quick and dirty oil transference.
You guys should do a giant resin tootsie pop, or maybe a real one? I think that would be cool also loved this video made me laugh :)
I can still smell the sawdust. I wish I were joking
I know the top you got for the flex shaft isnt the best but a flex shaft in general is great to use for many projects, personally I've used it on jewelry but I'd think you should be able to use it on wood and resin to carve details and polish
You are some of my favorite YouTubers- started with diys, and now even loving your gaming uncut videos even though I don’t play games myself. Katelyn is my puppy’s favorite, and after perking up and watching intently he consistently walks up to the tv and puts his feet up on the wall and tries to boop her
Best resin project ever! Custom resin chess set and board!
My husband and I have actually been using factor for about a month now and it's surprisingly so good. Our favorite part is you order individual meals so he gets the protein packed ones and I can get vegetarian and have something different for dinner
1:43  that's what she said
Are there any coupon codes for Evan and Kates merch?
I wasn’t looking 6:21 and I thought Evan was yelling
That "hammer" aged Evan by ten years.
In all the years of watching, I’ve never heard those laughs, those were some real genuine laughs between you two. It was a lovely moment 😊
Your overall reactions with the hammer tool has me breathless in tears! 😂😂😂😂😂
I give this video a 5 star rating! I know what to w 😂
i love watching you vids stay motivated to reach your 2 m subs you have in spired me to make crafts you are awsome
I want to see Even and Katelyn re-design these tools so bad just to do a comparison
I didn't get an alert for this video and it doesn't show up in my notifications?!
I think you the drill in wrong position in the press
Every tool you give to two moles with their hands mounted upside down will fail! 😅
Its just a matter of time until some screenshots from this video will be used on the product page of those chesp products on amazon😂
Bless you, dear editor, for saving our ears. RIP Evan and Katelyn's hearing.
I had that hammer show up in recommended items! 😂
umm anyone else notice they put the drill on backwards?  nothing would have been in the way if you put it on the other way
Watching Evan die in engineer …during the multi tool segment  Has made my day!
Okay…hear me out, I think they should try making these items next. They could 3D print a lot of the plastic parts and add metal etc and see if they can do it better.
At first i thought the sound of the carver was evan screaming
You can use any of those tools as a hammer!
99% of what is on Amazon are Chinese crap with fake reviews
That hammer-hammer-pliers-screwdriver-hammer-screwdriver-pliers is just fencing pliers with extra steps.
With the drill guide (and I'm not saying it's not garbage) couldn't you have just held the handle away from the guide rails instead of facing them?
Fun video!  The weed puller is a design from at least the 1800s, classic weed pulling mechanism. It just does not work so great made out of plastic instead of iron or steel. Probably also has to do with the compromises to make it a good plastic mold. That said, there's a reason it's not a super popular weed pulling tool anymore.
Sooo... you missed the opportunity to take the pump apart and inspect the damage. :(
I genuinely thought when Evan said "Technically you can pull out nails" he had managed to hurt himself that badly.
I think you were too generous with some of your ratings - I don't think any of them were worth more than one star - well maybe the pump....
I feel like now they have to test different woodcarving tools to justify that $60 purchase 😅
That hammer, hammer, pliers, hammer, pliers, screwdriver will definitely be replacing my LTT screwdriver 😂
Best... video... ever! Full of laughs and snorts and back pain.  Wait... I bought that drill pump... *hangs head in shame*
I literally laughed so hard I cried on this one. Almost as good as that time you made me belly laugh for, like, five minutes just upon seeing your thumbnail. 😂❤
9:12 he snorted😂, oh n 11:12 & 11:13 to name a few, LMAO
That last clip is giving resin javelins and the return of some fruit zombies.
I just can’t think about the hammer that’s also a hammer that’s also a screwdriver that’s also pliers that’s also pliers that’s also pliers that’s also a hammer that’s also pliers that’s also a hammer that’s also pliers without laughing.
LOL wood carving is definitely NOT mess free 😂
K: what are you gonna carve ??  E: CATS   Same Evan, same. And if I got my husband crafting or creating something artsy, it would probably also be cats
What is the transition music from? I remember it from a TV show or maybe another youtube channel but I'm sure it's tv. Please help! It's driving me crazy!
When I first heard the woodcarving thing I thought it was Evan screaming.
So far I could play that "at first i thought this tool looked weird" ad sound byte over all of these 😂
lol
Was hoping u would open up the pump to see what it looked like inside
Those cheep plastic pumps absolutely _have to be_ primed before use. Just like any other pump. Running dry for even a few seconds will do some damage. "prime the pump" means to add  the fluid being pumped before turning it on.  "The water got nasty" because you used the product improperly. Now are there instructions on how to use the pump properly? Don't know about THAT product, but there have been on every like product I've ever used.   Don't get me wrong, even used properly they don't last _long_ but they are a viable short term solution for specific applications.
Technically that weed is a tree so I know of no “ easy “ weeder that works on it
love how they are in a oak bed and calling the saplings growing off the roots weeds good luck pulling those out lol...
That electric gouge/chisel thing would probably work relatively well for harder woods if your sharpened it.
pump enjoyer lol i am dead
Fun video as always for you two :)   I do believe you overlooked one major thing with the pump.  most water pumps need to be primed (long story short air is compressible, liquid isnt, so a dry pump isnt really able to do much but once primed (flushed with liquid) the water is able to push/pull/move.  I am really curious how the pump would have performed if used 'properly'.   Did the instructions not mention anything about priming??
Love you guys and give joobie a hug for me pls ❤❤❤
Katelyn and I have the "can't drill perfectly vertically" in common...
Hi I have a resen idea eye of sron
The Technology Connections music
On that first one you are using it the wrong way round!! That's why your fingers get caught. But it's still trash. Haha
6:20 i thought it was Evan that was screaming 😭🤚
The emotional journey on Katelyn's face from "Beautiful wife" to "drilling straight down" is such a trip
10:33 I don't really know why I laughed so hard but I came so close to peeing my pants.
I thought the wood carver was Evan screaming at first 🫢
i wonder how the carver would perform on eva foam or other types of foam. might be usefull for a cosplayer?
Solutions in search of problems ... why? Just why?
A siren went off in my neighbourhood when the pump started trying to work on 'thick' water and I thought for a second that it was the drill motor overloading.
I laughed so hard, and I felt for Evan when his back hurt from laughing 😂❤ thank you for brightening up my day
This pump or some like it are sold at autopart stores as a fuel siphoning tool. Honestly maybe just getting the last little bit of water out of a pool or spa could make this a useful space saving tool.
I'm always so conflicted by this type of video. They're fun and entertaining but also...so very wasteful
The laughing fit at the absurdity of the triple hammer pliers screw drivers was worth every second of this video. Thank you guys!!! 😂
11:57 I LOVE THE MINECRAFT EDIT Please more gags like that
For the first one, the drill straightener  Can't you just approach it from the other side? So the metal bars are on the other side of your hand?
No black and Decker? Lol
17:45 apparently I'm not the only one that just puts painters tape on things when I'm hungry.
The weeder is a copy of Grampa’s weeder which is an amazing weeder. I would try that one if you do want the actual good one 👍🏼
The drill press thingy was probably meant to have the drill on the other side of those support beams.  Just a guess.
Hi Miranda!
I just saw that drill pump on Project Farm too!
#16 on trending today and almost at 2M subs. Congrats y’all!
19:11 "I don't know why so many people keep on buying it" - Someone who bought it.
Just as an FYI .. There's a bulb out on your EK sign that now looks like F.K... My wife and I love your videos btw!
You guys should make a legit project using these tools
The weed grabber is called clean hand, because you remove the weed with one hand, and your other hand stays clean!
Make your own cardboard, and use that cardboard to make something for joob
Every tool can be a hammer when it's convenient
I thought this was buy or DIY and I’m wondering why you didn’t diy lol
SO the next episode is Evan's intervention to talk about his addiction right ?
But, you couldnt posirionjng the drill in the other way around the flimsy thing? So your hand didnt touch the rods.  And please! Use earing protection !
the return of the thick-it!! yesssss!!!
For the pump, even if it could pump something thicker, if you used it for resin wouldn't you just leave a bunch in it that would cure and make it inoperable?
pretty sure its designed for carving wood, not cats, don't carve cats probably.
6:17 at first i thought the sound the machine made was evan screaming and peaking the mic 😂😭
when the screaming started i thought it sounded a little like evan screaming for a second 😂
all the laughing about non funny things feels very cringe.
That’s the thing about good tools nowadays.. my 35yo craftsman drill has a bubble level on the back to orientate you lol
You were spinning the pump wrong way...
The wood tool definitely deserved a lower score. “Technically it worked” Not for $60 it didn’t!
6:20 so THATS what my neighbors keep doing.. and yes... it's a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE noise to hear for hours in the morning... :/
When you use pump it use important to prime. If they dont have enough head pressure the pump wont be able to pump. The thicker the material the more hedges pressure you need for it to start pumping. Also if the pumps are not primed they start running on air over heat and are destroyed this is true for 10 dolars plastic pumps and 10,000 dolars pumps
the real friends are the pumps we abused together!
6:21 wasn't looking at the screen and thought Evan was screaming HAHAH
If you're going to rate a product over 1 star, shouldn't it be good enough to be the product that at least _some_ people should choose?  Merely "capable of possibly working sometimes" is still a good two steps below that, with "outperformed by a cheaper product" and "outperformed by using nothing or a free makeshift solution" between.
Totally thought that was Katelyn's arm at 2:17
6:21 the way that I first thought it was Evan screaming and then it quickly started to sound like Nanalan saying Yyyeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
At least we got some great laughs out of it
The 60 buck flex shaft wasn't bad for the price.
as a note for drilling straight, a guide block is more than sufficient in most cases (and the good ones are built to allow drilling pipes - something like the Wolfcraft Accumobile is cheap and light (I have one and I didn't pay the inflated prices I'm seeing online)  The hammer is a bad implemention of fencing pliers coupled with some "improved hammer" features  Drill pumps have been around for a while and are useful to have hanging around for emergency/occasional use. The really bad part is that a _really good_ one is only $19 (clark C300PPB) and the one you showed is a knock off of a fairly good $12 Draper tool (18937)
i thought the sound of the electric woodworking machine with handle + 5 chisel tips worth 12+60 dollar was evan screaming
maybe the carving thing is for linocut?
The hammer multi tool sequence killed me 😂
- Guider: You can attach the drill feom the other side to have free room for your fingers - Hammer: Clamp the nail and just hammer it in holding the tool, no need to use another hammer. When it's in, use the other side to finish the job. - Weeder: You need to step on the pedal to clinch the roots.
I got a weird sensation as u tested that wood chisel - the sound triggered ‘smell-o-vision’ - burnt wood dust 😂  still smell it and nobody is doing work on wood 😂😏  that tool has broken the 5th dimension
You got me with the woodworking. I made a noise that concerned my spouse 😂
Did you notice the screw “GUID” material type is “material”? 😂😂😂 I would rate the woodworking tool a 1 because the listing doesn’t tell you what you need to make it work.
To anyone interested in the Flex Shaft. I actually highly recommend getting the "original" version of the Flex Shaft/Pendant Motor showed in the video, it's an incredibly useful tool, especially for small work like Jewelry making. It combines a small handpiece with a lot of power, for less power but more flexibility a "Dremel" is best and for even less power but absolutely amazing flexibility a "Micromotor" is best.... Under the Line, a Flex Shaft/Pendant Motor is basically a beefed up version of the commonly known Dremel Rotary Tool... The leading brand is Foredom, Dremel also offers a model called Fortiflex. Cheers
Katelyn: “So, how are you feeling, how’s the experience?” Evan, with his entire body: “Haughnnnnhuh…”
Your drill is on the wrong side of the uprights.   Also, you're trying to pull out small tree, not weeds.
That prime hammer deserves 5 stars purely for hilarious entertainment value. 😅
Oh the weed thing looks really similar to what we had. It picked the weed up by pushing the pedal down when the stick was in the ground around the weed. We used it mainly for dandelions and worked really well 8,5/10 of the tries
Next video: throw all these garbage tools and measure the distance.
Why didn’t you try the “drill guid” (sic) from the other side where the rails aren’t in your hands’ way?!?  Liked the drill pump but was screaming at the start, “it’s spinning the wrong way! Reverse the drill direction!” Then you did and I’d be happy with a score of 3.5. (For water.)  If the weed thingy said ‘use the straw end’ I’d take that to mean the other open end of the tube whcih would bore a hole round your target weed and loosen the soil round the long root, then use the other grabby lever end to grab and lever your weed out. But as you’d have soil on the end you’re holding to grab and lever, the claim of “clean hands” is a dirty rotten lie (unless you wear gardening gloves? But then every tool can leave you with clean hands.  More of these!!!
The hammering a nail into concrete it does mean your fingers aren't near the nail.
did anyone else think at first that the chisel sound was Evan screaming? because i definitely thought he was just screaming to match the sound😂😂😂😅😅
I had to relisten to Evan saying "I don't know what it's good w"like five times, what a good sound. 19:31😌
The only thing with pumps I have to say. Trust me, I have had to pump different viscosity fluids.. you have to prime it first, which is where you get a lot of time waiting before you get fluid dispensed. But you guys are smarter than me and already knew that.
ngl, I was concerned when I saw poor Evan's face slowly turn red at 10:50 or so.
2:50 Guys... there is almost 360 degrees of freedom to place the drill in this thing and you picked the worst one... come on.
Katelyn!! Thank you for protecting our poor ears during the wood carving test! 6:39
Kikkerland actually sells a mini multitool similar to this and it seems way more functional. It would be so cool if you tried this mini one! Or just a bunch of tiny tools in general ! I would totally watch that!
i have one of those small pumps i use for olive  oil... it costed around 20 euros.. so you can get a good and cheap one of those that work well... that one seems useless though.. haha
It’s basically free, you can write it off your taxes.
Laughing so hard your back kills you.  Awesome stuff.
Noone ever said carving is mess free
The pumps work i use them all the time but you have to prime it first ..it has no barring so uses what its pumping so you have to fill the tube and pump with liquid before starting it
6:19 I thought that was Evan screaming
Curious with the drill guide if you replaced the plastic dowels with aluminum, or even wood, if it would work as intended & help Katelyn drill straight.
Did the pump maybe just need to be primed?
But there are really good drill pumps on the market. I just wanted to say that. It's a cool video, very informative and funny.😂🎉
What makes the hammer part even funnier for me is that my mum, only know the bare minimum of DIY, has bought every DIYing man in the family, and everyone has either stuffed them away never to be found or just straight up threw them away. My dad has at least 7 of them hidden away in a secret compartment in his car that only he knows about.
I bought a super super cheap drill press like the first item shown. No instructions. I was hoping for step by step instructions here. I just go "3 hours later" Oh well.
The VERY FIRST item was KILLING me the moment I saw the photos. I was dying just based on how the size was ALLLL over the place. I can't-
“Thinking quickly, Evan constructed a hammer using only some pliers, a screwdriver, and a hammer.”
I love your DIY projects they make me laugh and makes my day every time I watch
You tried to screw the nail but you stripped it instead! And the way you both laughed until you couldn’t breathe after was brilliant
"Easy" "Fast" "Clean Hand" 😆
would love to see you guys doing parodies of teleshop with this thing haha must be hillarious
I want an Evan control test of the drill guide, so he can put his money where his mouth is! Also what if you moved the drill 180°? Would that be less cumbersome?
YouTubers ever
Hi
Those ratings were too generous 😯
Those electric chisels work well for removing resin 3D print supports
2:48 Turn the drill around, Katelyn! 😂
Evan cry silent laughing was amazing 🤣
TELL ME HOW I THOUGHT HE WOOD CARVING TOOL WAS EVAN SCREAMING
I love your fun science experiments…for weirdos. 😂😂😂😂 you guys always make me laugh that I have to remember to breathe.
A child with Dyslexia could build a Drill Guide for less than that and have it function... Wait. *GIVE ME SOME DOWEL.*
I use those pumps and they work great. Biggest mistake people make is they don't prime them. Not sure about that exact model but the ones I have make it very clear in the instructions that it should never be run dry.
With those drill pumps, you are supposed to prime them first. Put some fluid in the pump first (pour a little into directly), and then run it. It have a longer life also. They work surprisingly well.
I own one of those drill powered pumps that I got at Harbor Freight for like $13.  It's great for the RV and for Camping, for pulling water out of the lake or river.  It's great for fast quick showers or cleaning things while on the go.
With the weed you should have used the extra bit for leverage
Next video: how much time and money will it take to make them all work as intended? (Not building a totally new tool!!) I'd watch that.
man i would have loved to see the inside of the drill pump to see if the blades where melted or scraped up
Just wanted to point out that the music during the score/rating sequences was originally used in the Little Lady Jesus reveal, which automatically makes this one of the top 10 E&K videos
not to defend garbage from amazon, but i think the difference with the hammer thing is that instead of hitting the nail directly, you're aiming for a larger target and can apply more force with less precision/restraint needed, and positioning the nail with the tool instead of fingers makes it easier to align it straight (and allows more precision in doing so since the tool is longer) at least that's what it looks like it could be!
Would love to see the drill pump insides
3:00 User Error - you've got the drill attached in reverse of how it should be.  It's obvious via use that the 2 rods that extend from the base are there to offset the weight of the drill (being over them).  And clearly working on the narrow dimension of a board is more difficult and less stable than the wide dimension.  Despite how cheap and flimsy that tool it, it actually could aid in drilling if used correctly and with some care.
OMG😂 please tell me that you added these individual video reviews on each product listing 😅
you can probably 3d print a pump that actually works =)
I think you were too kind to that noise maker. It looked as if the hammer/pliers tool would carve better, with less noise.
Nice before and after setup 😉😜
Products are bad but not as bad as those 2.
Im sorry, the minecraft hearts killed me 😂
🤣🤣 k: if you say technically... E: tEcHnIcAlLy 😁 love y'all's content 💖
At first I thought the sound of the wood carver was Evan screaming hahahaha
whoever turned down the volume on that tool in editing... I wanna kiss you for being considerate.
Technically
Evan busting up laughing and then Katelyn joining with the multi hammer tool was too contagious
9:46 "i dont understand why that's better than hammering the nail" because when youre hammering a nail into concrete it wont hold itself up like it does with wood after you tap it a couple times. you have to get it pretty deep before it doesnt need to be held straight, which requires hitting it hard which isnt safe to do while holding it with your fingers. so they make tools like this that hold it for you.  it also makes it impossible to strike the nail at an angle and bend it by accident.  its not a multitool. but its perfectly good at the one job it's designed for
I would be curious if you were able to take the water pump and recreate it with the tools that you have.
To be fair, a pump like that isn't supposed to work from a dry start - you're supposed to prime it with water first.
A good version of that drill pump is a life saver. We need something like that for water changes in the hot tub cause we always end up bailing out the last 30 gallons cause it wont drain after a certain point.
Omg watching you guys crack up so hard that you couldn't speak 🤣🤣🤣I'm laughing so hard my stomach hurts!!!!
This is a great break from the trauma of Gaza. Please openly speak out against the US's decision to veto a ceasefire.
The possibilities are numerous once we decide to act and not react.
It takes a lot of force to get a nail into concrete. So this is probably why the multitool has a guide. Because I a nail is harder to start straight in concrete then in wood?
i have seen them laugh before, but this is the first time they reach ultrasonic XD
that drill pump would've actually worked if they used a harder and more resistent to high temperatures than plastic! Now I'm actually surprised and would be excited if you guys wanted to try recreating it with some harder and heat proof material!
6:18 i was on a different tab at this time and i genuinely thought that sound was evan screaming
I'm picturing a "Technically..." shirt with Evan's raised finger on it. Also, that's the only hammer I've ever seen with a kickstand. Good grief.
Couldn't you use Hammer Power to cut the nail?
regarding that weed grabbing tool, we have one that works really well, except ours is a metal claw and wooden handle. Maybe the one you guys bought was very poorly made, or there's a certain technique to it.
Oh actually we use a drill pump all the time for moving thin flooded water. We also once had a really bad leak in our sauna that made us have to remove all the water without using its drain (the sauna wasnt actually fully plumbed in. It was an interesting circumstance) so we used the drill pump (a better quality one cough) to make a sloooow siphon work faster.
✨TECHNICALLY✨
None of these should have been over 1. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it deserves a better rating.
You can tell just by how he’s standing his back is really in pain. Poor guy.
hii! I luv this!! ❤ >:D
Just listened to the Lateral episode you guys were on, not knowing you were on it. Loved it, and I hope you're on again! :)
Well it had one thing going for it ... *at least* 50 seconds of laughing so hard you can't breathe! (10:40-11:30)
I feel like Evan's chaos always follows with a talk of "but it's a write off!"
OMG!!! This is painful to watch. Why do people make such garbage?
I would love to watch a video of you guys carving wooden cats! Joobie deserves to be immortalized in a wooden carving 😂
Drilling a straight up and down hole is even harder for us height challenged individuals.
thats not a weed.. thats your tree sending up new branches from it's roots. my oak tree does that too.
I think my favorite part of this video was Evan losing the ability to speak because he was laughing too hard
Tbh, most pumps like that need to be primed first
I keep hearing Jackie aka Nerde Crafter singing. Figure it out. Lol❤😂
Pretty sure the slot in the concrete hammer is to put a blank pew pew ammo and strike it to ignite it. This sends the nail through concrete. Glad you did not do that.
Editing note: those title cards with the breakbeat is sick. Please do more of those:)
Just so you know the pump needs to be lubricated and I think it says it in the discription!!!
"If your hammer don't hammer then it sure as hell ain't gonna do anything else that's useful to you" ~MC Hammer, probably
Not that it redeems the drill guide, but try rotating the drill 180 degrees so that the bars are further from the trigger.
Flexlible shafts are great for carving, but you need a normal rotary chuck and some bits. The big advantage of a flexible shaft over a dremel is that it doesn't vibrate your hand as much...but putting an oscillating bit instead of rotary completely defeats that advantage.
10:45 did Evan SWEAR??? /jk
lol. Rotate the drill 180°
so those drill pumps need to be lubricated to properly work by removing the front and adding some form of grease to them before use, but  of course it's not mentioned anywhere int the instructions
I have a drill pump (But from a local hardware store). It's been extremely useful when friends basements have flooded, etc.
While the like drill straight tool sucked you could have flipped the drill 180° and not had the guide rods be in the way.
At first I legit thought they had put audio of Evan yelling over the electric chisel to cover the bad sound, but no, it WAS the bad sound
I had this video in the background so I wasn't actively watching and I genuinely thought the wood carver for a moment was just Evan screaming
On the second tool, Harbor freight has a flex shaft grinder for like $50 and I highly recommend getting one of those if you have a work bench you can mount it at. I currently dont so I use a dremel but a flex shaft grinder is just better. Plus being able to swap heads is really nice. So I recommend getting a grinding head for it, they are like $15. I used to have 3 cheap ones that didn't have toolless chucks so I just kept one for a cut off wheel, one as a grinding wheel, and one as a wire brush and just swapped the heads.
When the 'painful audio' kicked in, I actually thought it was Evan making a noise, didn't even recognize it. That's scary.
I feel like the pump is a 3d printing project. That way you can replace the parts when it breaks
You thought you looked at those tool listings for too long well- yeah idk where I was going with this
The designers of that multi-hammer tool asked the question "What tools can we cram into a hammer?" and shoved everything in it.  I'm surprised they didn't put in a kitchen sink.
You are supposed to lubricste the pump first. And frequently after
I wanted to get into factor cuz I hate cooking but when I found out that they were now owned by hello fresh I lost interest cuz I had terrible experiences with hello fresh. The food I got from hello fresh also had no flavor at all so that was very disappointing.
You are going against the grain of the wood making loud sound
I really hope y’all returned the ones that don’t work or at the very least write it off as a business expense lol
that hanging router is great when used with Dremel attachments though
Technically needs to be a shirt😝
It seems like the engraver was meant for metal? Could be wrong but I feel like I’ve watched someone engraving copper sheets with a similar tool.
I was not paying full attention and thought that the screaming sculpter was EVAN screaming 😂😂
6:20 sounded like Evan screaming for a good 3 seconds
QVC has a better made version of the last one. We got it to work for us but I don't know if it has to do with better quality or more shallow weeds due to us having more of a sandy dirt here at the shore.
The chisel could be a new vibrating device to add to your collection (AHEM!!).  Perhaps, you guys could make your own multi-tool to show Amazon how it's done.
The pump attachment likely isnt self priming so you have to overload it to get it to work, which in turn causes it to fail so quickly
Is Evan having back issues…he seemed to be standing a little more compressed on his right although since he’s alway on that side it might just be him naturally angling to the camera.
Carving isn't always calm and quiet, take chainsaw carving for example. Stone carving definitely isn't quiet, I know from experience.
The "weeds" in question were live oak sprouts from the tree you were standing under. They don't have roots to pull like a germinated weed would.
You know the video is gonna be interesting when it’s starts with Evan browsing Amazon completely unsupervised.
6:20 Carving by hand is faster and more efficient than this!
Fun vid, please use hearing protection. Tinnitus is lame
1:37 puzzle adjacent with Evan & Katelyn yea!
I think Katelyn just needs a drill press
9:41 What the hammer multi tool does do is let you hold the nail while keeping your hand safe, it probably isn’t the best way to do that, but it works.
It isn't that Katelyn is too small, I think the bench is too high for her .... perhaps an adjustable bench?
*W *I *Y
When you laugh so hard the back pain kicks in
Katelyn´s so freaking beautiful!!!
i have a drill pump and have used it many times.  not that one in particular, but i know it wasn't expensive.
evan: do you smell burning plastic continues to go full speed
How do you get an average rating of 1.7 with only 2, whole star, ratings... the math ain't mathing
The amount of tears I had while laughing when y’all burst into laughter was more than I expected when I first began this video. That was a joy and delight and nothing at all what I was expecting to happen. Amazing as always haha 😂
Lol!  Why buy a hammer and pliers when you could buy a hammer-hammer-pliers-pliers? =P
6:20 I legit thought that was Evan screaming. Also, for the pump drill thing, I assume the reason It was breaking so fast for everyone is nobody was priming the pump first.
the thing about the last one is that it works as intended. if you use it properly. people just dont know how to use tings anymore.
I've never heard quotations on a word vocalized better than Evan's "technically" at 12:59
LOL! "Zero." You make me laugh. Thank you.
The multi-tool segment was the opitime of "the sleepy hahas." My face hurts sm rn lmao I hope you're feeling better, evan
Would the pump have worked with the resin if you went slow?
You can get really good water pumps that runs food a drill and under $30… this not one of the, .
Half this video was just them laughing, and internally crying😂 so a typical evan and Katelyn video
6:20 I THOUGHT THAT WAS EVAN, NOT THE TOOL
On the plus side for the "drill guid," I am impressed that they specified its color in heraldic blazon ("gules" rather than "red")!
Katelyn: do you wanna rate it?😅 Evan: ZERO. >:(
This video is exactly why Evan is my spirit animal, lol.
Tell Katelyn that some power drills have a bubble level on the top. It will help her so much!
i would love to see you do products that have half good and half terrible reviews and be the final judge
So I need just a whole channel of them doing just reviewing juck cause this seems to make y'all just joyous. Y'all are always positive vibes but just extra in this video.
I swear I've never laughed from some on YouTube laughing. But I found myself cracking up with Evan laughing at the screw driver hammer
Katelyn: Wow you really got that screw in 😂😂 Evan: it hurts!
Fyi, that style of water pump is easy to burn up if it's spun dry.  Then make it from the cheapest materials you can find in china and 30s life sounds generous.
This was so much fun.❤😂 I love when you both crack up do much you can't talk.
I love how the screaming chisel reminds me of our really dull woodcutter. It literally sounds the same. And yes it's also really really loud.
Bros acting like this garbage is anything more than 0 stars
hammer + multi-tool = bad time
Nice vid guys ❤
Why would anyone want a multitool that includes a hammer??? Who wants a heavy screwdriver? 😅
Hey! What's with the vigorous hip swinging??!!! What kind of channel is this? 🙂
Was that balsawood hahaha?? A butter knife 🍴 would do a better job
Every day I check on if you have a new video😂 you guys make me laugh one of my favorite Youtubers out there. Wish she made it YouTube video every day.❤
I need just Evan and Katelyn laughing as a short. It made me laugh so hard my eyes were watering. Thanks!
Honestly I think most people who are disappointed by their Amazon purchase is when they don’t read the product specification thoroughly, I for one am VERY thorough when I read it before buying anything! Even If It’s a cheap product you should do fine😊
I have a request! I’ve been wanting to know about what would happen if you made a gingerbread house and then poured resin over all of it? Would it catch fire? Would it seal everything forever? Would the frosting melt? The world needs to know! I feel like you guys are the only ones that can answer this question! Love your channel!
For some reason, I now want to see them make their own take on the weed remover tool.
That wood carving drill freaked out my cats 😂
I really enjoyed this video. I'd love to see other videos structured like this. Maybe even repeat the same video with 5 new products for the 2nd channel.
comment for the algorithm
The hammer/hammer/hammer/pliers/pliers thing looks like one of the worst tools I have ever seen. Even just as a heavy object to hit something, that handle looks like the worst thing to have to hold while trying to knock in a nail!
I thought that the sound of the tool was Evan screaming in frustration 😂😅😢
"It's a hammer, which is also a hammer, but also, a hammer, and pliers, and don't forget, also pliers"  You guys would be really great in sales 😂😂
I like to imagine there's one person that created all of these tools and is just so mad, creating a video to show how to properly use it and makes it work 😂
Evan laughing so hard he activated his back pain is so relatable 😂
hes terrible
Do the same concept, but with the highest-rated products, and see how much you can abuse them before they give.
The "weeds" you're trying to grab are baby trees. The video was very fun to watch. Thanks for the entertainment.
You guys were generous handing out those stars.  I wouldn't have gone above a 2 for any of them.
Pulling a live oak seedling is quite a challenge and different from your normal weed. Compare it to other methods like hand or trowel. Very unlikely that anything will pull it.
for product 1 - get a drill press 2 - the carver works the tips are not sharp enuf or the wood was to hard 3 - its good to hold your nails and not hit your fingers 4 - yah its crap and i think the label was backwards 5 - a metal one would be better
15:52 those are clearly bugs lol
Interesting video but when they used the drill pump it would not work with resin since you would not be able to clean it out afterwards if you did Use resin since the resin would get in the pump and you wouldn't be able to clean it out therefore the resin inside the pump would dry out and stop the pump or miniature water mill fan inside from working
If you actually get a good one of those weed pullers, they're great, especially for dandelions 😂
6:20 I really thought it was Evan screaming 😭
OMG! he almost poked his head with the screw in the hammer hammer hammer screw crew driver pliers pliers pliers jejejejejejejjejeee
The carving machine sounds like Evan 😭😂
9:10 oh yes, hammerplier, I know that gaming youtuber/director
Does anyone know what the music sample is during the product change?!?!  It's driving me crazy trying to figure it out.
am i the only one who took WAY TOO LONG to realize that that sound was not in fact evan screaming at the top of his lungs at 6:21? XD
I genuinely thought the carving noise came from Evan the first time-
The weed puller did keep your hands clean.
people have been making weeders in just that shape for centuries and god knows why.  the cast iron one my dad left me is probably about 100 years old and not one bit more useful.  dandelion roots are too scrawny and the root bulbs of blackberries are way too big.
Anyone else find it hilarious how annoyed Katelyn was about the 70$ that Evan spent, while she wanted to buy a 300$ coffee table😂❤
You guys are so wholesome I feel bad about it.  My cold dark heart is...well, it's tepid.  Best I can do, not your fault.
If you lube the drill pump each time before using it will last quite a bit longer!
The fact that it’s a hammer 4 times but you still have to bring in an additional 5th hammer. I can’t. 😂👌
I doubt you'd want to use a pump like that for resin as you mention i looks like the water was washing out all the lubricant. You'd probably be better with a peristaltic pump which keeps the liquid and the mechanism isolated. The downside of pumping resing though would be that you need to wash it out before it starts to set (espeically if it is made of plactic with a low melting temp)
😂 I don't think those were weeds. They looked more like tree saplings and they can be hard enough to pull out as it is.
Hammer thing might take powder charges :3
I am glad that I’m not the only one who horse laughs over the Chinese descriptions and images lol!
Wrong bit for engraving! Plus it is not sharp enough by the looks of it!
"baby? maybe this is going to be a new hobby of ours".  ...... "oh your going to be a wood carver?"
With the first one maybe drill on the other side of the metal rods?
Watching you guys split your sides laughing over the multitool hammer, hammer, pliers screwdriver, pliers and hammer genuinely gave me life!
You're not supposed to "cut" the nails.  You're supposed to cut them off if they're stuck in a board.
They didn't give the multi tool enough credit. One of the "pull nails easily" was clearly being used as a pliers and the other one was a hammer. 😅
1:43.  Not that kind of channel
I am the best rated tool Ü
1.2M subs and worried about $50 spent on content that can be written as an expense smh
Oh my god, them reading the name for the chisel gave me flashbacks to safiya nygaard wish videos
the drill pump need to be lower than the container. You destroy it by running it dry.
does anyone know why the wood carver makes that awful sound
I'm confused.....  Are you going to carve wood, or cats?
Those are some of the dullest chisels I've ever seen😂 A sharpened chisel should cut through that like butter just manually.
please use liberal use of the amazon return feature.
10/10 for the video, 0/5 on all those "tools". Although that "hammer" is a 5/5 on laughs
10:53 I haven’t laughed so hard or so much in years! This part just got me so good!
There is something so joyful about watching someone giggle till it hurts 😂❤
6:37 why?? Why does that exist,
I think the pump could've worked better. A lot of these kind of pumps aren't self priming meaning they need to be full of water before you can use them.
That is the worst multi tool I've ever seen! 🎉
Those weren't weeds. The were oak tree saplings that are connected to the root base. 🤣🤣
You now have a multi carving tool, a name brand name is “foredom rotery tool” its better than a dremel tool. They have many different handle tools as you guys bought just the carving one, but a cheap Chinese knock-off one.
Not saying it will be good but I was always told to prime a pump when possible. Might make the pump last longer ( maybe ).
As someone who is in the Amazon Vine program, where we get free samples of products with the hope that we rate them, I can attest that nearly everything that's sold by a third party is terrible quality, or, at best, mediocre.  I rate most things 2-3 stars.  Sadly, most other Vine reviewers start out by giving everything 5 stars!  And if there's a major problem, they give it 4 stars.  So, really, Amazon ratings are useless, and I only go by the reviews that talk about specifics (good, bad, or neutral).
Very often I too find that I’ve been busy with “stuff”! 😅😂
Ive never heard wood scream like that
this is one of the funniest episodes ever
the first time the carver started making that noise i fully thought evan had just started screaming.
I remember my aunt had a hammer multi-tool where you unscrewed the hammer to reveal a screwdriver that had multiple interchangeable tips. No pliers, but pretty useful!!
YESYESYESYESYES i really didnt have a great evening but now you uploaded a video - instant upgrade
I really hope you guys are coming to open sauce in 2024 cus i just bought my tickets
Pump might have worked better if the primed it, probably burnt out the pump running it too fast trying to clear the air from the pump.
Don't you guys have to tools to make a more durable drill pump or a pump powered by any other motor
11:47 so real for leaving this in. When it hurts so bad you can’t even make a noise lmao 😂
I had to stop whatever I'm doing at the multi tool section. Was too busy cracking up!
re: the awful drill guide - there was no advantage to having the drill on that side (where you could hit the button anymore).  You could have drilled from the other side, where the rails were not 🙂
I think you might need to prime your pump.
I could literally watch you guys assess amazon scam products all day long! This was hilarious!
For that pump you need to prime it first. Meaning there needs to be water in it before you should start it. Operating any pump dry will cause the motor and impellor to burn out and break. That pump may have worked with that thicker stuff if you primed it first.
You need a technically shirt
There was some PRIME editing in this video.
Rotate the drill 180° so your hands don't touch the rods. But y'all knew this
❤Thank you for this, you had me in fits of laughter with this one, hammering, screwing, stripping and vigorous hip swinging, this video has it all, thank you hammer hammer pliers pliers 😅
You need to prime the pump first.
I think the “hammer “broke Evan
I hope someday you find a good tool to help Katelyn align the drill successfully. 😅 Also, you know the tool is *questionable quality* when the description is in the title rather than having it down below on Amazon.
Thanks for the giggle, nice one.
Well, that ended abruptly. If I didn't see the credits scrolling by, I would have assumed it was an incomplete upload.
I love this format 😂
Evan and Katelyn being our local testers so we dont spend money on bullshit 😂
Hello Fresh is union busting and has unsafe work environments where people slip, loose limbs or even die. Happy eating!
Love your vids. They are funny, wholesome and you speak clearly (as a german that‘s important)
You should replace the lightbulb that's dead at the bottom of the E in the background
The "under $15" in the title is an outright lie
all people care about is the three-letter s word and things out of context in that sense recently i have been suffering from depression and other mental illnesses due to this and i wish it wasnt like this so please try to be a family and kid-friendly youtube channel again for the people who need it most
I was not looking at my phone for 6:27 and I thought Evan was shouting 😅
When you asked yourself if the pump was sucking anything I thought "Either way: it sucks." 😅
My gawd, I haven't laughed that hard in months. I was caught in the giggles along with ya'll.
18:11 😂
The Steve carrell that’s what she said mosquito is wonderful. I love how wonderful your editing is growing and finessing.
Evan getting an owie then going to have some of his drink had me absolutely cracking up. Poor Evan
As someone who’s 6’+ I feel your back pain Evan…. I’m sorry man
One of the funniest videos y'all have done... Need more junk reviews!
Not me watching this video at 6pm not having eaten a meal since what counted as breakfast…then seeing the ad lol
To be fair... All multitools are a sh*ttier version of the original tool, they're just supposed to be handy in a pinch when you don't have acces to a multitude of tools
My new puppy sure found the sound interesting 😅
“What are you gonna carve?” “Cats” - legit what my grandad did for most of his working life after the army. He sold his wood carved animals at loads of craft fayres and cats were his specialty! He is very old and in the early stages of dementia now, but we still have so many of his carved animals around my parents house 😊
The photoshopped images are so funny too me, do people really think they are fooling us? 😭😂
U2 are my favorite Youtubers and I am so happy to watching your new video I am crafting right now it’s perfect to watch thank you guys and I am happy to be a supporter
We have one of the drill pump things. Worked great when we had a waterbed and needed to easily start the siphon to drain it.
Get a rotary head for the engraving unit. at least you can use it instead of the dremel
The electric Dremel is me when I see a spider in the shower
would love to see you try woodcarving without the machine of death (to everyone's eardrums) trying handcarving maybe?
I’d like to see Evan make a drill guide for Katelyn.
I'm sure everyone is going to/has already commented this. But Katelyn, have you tried drilling from a higher vantage point? I was taught to look at the top of the drill, so you can't see any part of the drill below it and not press down at all, just use the weight. For reference, my table is about mid thigh height.
6:20 It just sounds like Evan screaming
I love your vids
I think starting the pump at full speed was guaranteed to break it. It likely would have done so no mater the quality of the pump.
Carving is not quite and/or not tidy... L
while i dont disagree that its garbage. flip the drill to the other side 3:09. 15:20 ... you have to prime the pump, running them on air ruins them.
I think Evan and Katelyn should collab with @DrAlexTubio to get that back straightened out!
For my work, I got that kind of pump. It was a slightly more "industrial" version of the pump, purchased at Lowes, but on day 1 of trying to use it, I managed to break the screw on plastic parts for the hose and had to go to Lowes to buy replacement parts. However, once I changed out the parts, it has worked fine ever since. I pump water as well as thicker liquids with this pump.  I did not like that the hose curls and therefore is hard to handle on your own. I zip-tied sticks to the ends of each hose to straighten them on, and, the torque created from spinning the blades in the pump means that the hoses will always be pointing in odd directions while you're using it.
Evan, you didn’t prime the pump!!!
11:00 never thought id see these 2 goof balls max out their goofometer :D (words of love.. not insulting)
I’m from brazil and here the name Evelyn is very common, so sometimes I call the channel kate & evelyn on the auto pilot mode and then I realize that it’s wrong lol 🤣🤣
6:21 I thought that sound was Evan screaming 😂
6:20 for a brief second i thought the noise the chisel was making was Evan *screaming* and was very concerned/confused. 😓
Ouch, it's like Temu, but you paid 3x the price.
Evan was given free reign? Uh oh. We are certainly in for an interesting video
You have a light out in your E
It's amazing how much user error is involved in these products "failing" smh
"clean hand" So only one hand stays clean, the other gets filthy.
michael scott flying around is sending me
You guys are great. This video made my day, I had a good laugh
I like how instead of pumping the water in the same bucket to create a loop they switched buckets at leats 8 times to continue pumping
I appreciate you Editor Katelyn
This is brilliant, so good, enjoyed till the end 😊😊😊
Pumps don't work unless you prime them by filling them up.
I love ur vids. You've gotten me through so mush in the past year tank you guys
Follow up video: specific products that are better alternatives to each of these!
To my surprise a tool I bought appeared first. For the sake of £10 I gave it a go. After using it the first time I put it in the bin, I didn’t really need it but thought it might be useful for light work, nope! And yes it smacked my fingers a bunch of times when it binded. Would also give it a 0
I'm sure Joob was terrified by that chisel nose.
I do really wish they took the pump apart 😆
Congratulations on your new Screaming Banshee electric chisel wood carving accessory with 5 blades.... 😆😂🤣
To be fair those weedpullers are awful even from reputable brands. My parents made me pull weeds and we had one that was heftier and sturdier than the one shown but it didn't pull the weeds any better.  But it had a shoeter handle which made it a pain on back to use at over 6 feet and i kept on breaking those bloody things simply by using them as intended. Got through three of them before my parents stopped to ask me to do it.
I never thought I’d laugh at people online getting hammered and screwed.
Are you guys giving away these tools after the video?( If yes I would like to have the flexible shaft dingus, it looks cute)
I’ve been watching y’all for years now and I loveeee your videos and the variety of stuff y’all do and how funny y’all are!!! Can’t wait to see the next video!!😊❤️
I've been through some tough times recently, struggling with some loss. I'm so glad I found this channel, it's been really comforting to me. Your chemistry together and positively really helps my mood. Thank you guys so much!!❤
Evan my brother in ageing, I know exactly what that feels like to laugh so hard you hurt your already hurting back. Time to go lay down. LMAO
Seeing you guys Laugh so hard and for a moment, helped to start my weekend off right 😊
It broke my heart that Evan's response to "what are you gonna carve" wasn't "wood" xD
Are you guys high
I would have loved to have seen you open up the pump to see how poorly it was constructed from the inside and what exactly broke. Maybe you could still do it in a second channel video?
Yup all else fail use a hammer🤣It's already halfway in anyway🤣
I love the videos of u guys. This made my worst day of this year so much better. Thx. ❤
You should try copper electro forming. You can basically coat everthing in metal (dried leaves etc.) 😊
The problem with the Drill Pump is that it is probably not self priming. So unless you get the water to the inlet of the pump first it is just going to spin and burn up the plastic.
Got a drill pump similar to the one featured, but mine is completely made of metal. Think my dad bought it in the late 80s. I know it's been thoroughly abused in its life but it's still going strong. It would probably move resin too.
Lmao
Not a professional, but I use a flexibel (the chisel thingie) quite often (with different tips) and typically, if it makes a sharp noise like that, it means you are forcing it too much<3 you kinda need to allow the tip to do its thing, and not try to rush it
You should have a big trash can in the background!😂
The electric chisel makes the noise I imagine Katelyn was making inside her head when she heard Evan had spent the extra 60 bucks.
Seeing you two laugh so much about the hammer tool had me laughing too, and put me in a much better mood.
at first i thought Evan was screaming but it turns out it was the carving thingy LOL
This makes me wonder if you can use a gravel vacuum (for aquariums) for resin 🤔
6:19 Oh my god, at first I thought Evan was randomly screaming to mess around, and then I realised it was the carver/wood, what the-
Watch these companies take photos from this video from your reviews and put it on their Amazon listings 😂
For the weed puller there's one thats like "grandpa's weed puller" or something and people have gone nuts for it on tiktok! Works better than the cheap one you guys got 😂😂
:)
that carving tool sounds like both of you screaming at once
3 for the wood carver, but 2 for the hammer?!
OMG i got late by 2 hours..
The first time Evan used the woodcarver I thought he started yelling and then I realized it was the machine and lost it laughing.
Tape a bubble level on the back part of your drill to keep the drill level.
I was excited to try factor until I heard they're now owned by hello fresh. Sadly, I find hello fresh ready-to-eat meals to be disappointing
you guys are probably my favorite youtubers! i love the “not that type of channel” moments and the cozy ones as well. keep doing what you’re doing! ❤️
Have yall ever tried making homemade rivets?     I just tried last night (skinny brass rivets for a leather project) and i failed horribly, and i would like to see your attempts.    Maybe you could figure out a better way to do it than i did.
6:20 I literally thought Evan started to scream but nope, it was the “carving” sound 🙃
I've been stuck in the hospital since Tuesday when they had to hammer a rod into my tibia after I split it falling down the stairs. In my drug addled state I'm imagining them doing the surgery with that hammer multi tool and laughing so hard I'm crying. Thank you two for giving me a moment of levity in a terrible week.
I can’t wait to see your Safiya collab! You always make me smile!
You guys should try carving with actual hand tools first before rating that awful piece of equipment lmao
Nothing could have prepared me for those last 30 seconds… 😂😂😂
The moment i saw the chisel and knew immediately it was a flexshaft thing and didn't realize anyone wouldn't know and reminded my experiences aren't everyone's. Also... $60 for a flex shaft is a good freaking price actually. XD
If you prime the pump and keep it at low rpm it might last a lot longer
Zomato.  just gonna leave this comment here, those who get it, get it. 😂
Watching you two absolutely lose it over hammer-hammer-pliers-screwdriver-hammer was so funny! Thank you for leaving the full laugh attack in!
Get Katelyn a Drill Press
The pump does seem interesting! I wonder if you guys were able to make something similar/better if it would actually be a good tool to have laying around 🤔
Evan, you're an engineer and should know that there's a difference between "pump" and "self-priming pump". The pump you tested is not self priming. You're supposed to fill the intake hose up to the pump prior to spin it. I haven't seen the description of the product but they might have failed to mentioned that, which would account for most people failing to realize that and getting it to fail. Also, I imagine a bunch of people trying to use this with long hoses or hoses that collapse on the intake. This is not meant for that. I would imagine using this to empty a large fish tank for instance.
How many Evans does it take to screw in a screw?  One giant one to spin the house and a regular sized one to hold the screw
OK, I'm the type of person who has to pause and read everything when it pops up and I'm so glad I am right now! I'm only at 0:06 and I'm already dying laughing because one of the 1 star reviews is "My wife left me after I bought this. Please come back Miranda." Then the next comment that came up is a 5 star review that says "So good I have a wife now. Say hi Miranda" !!!! I love when people mess around in Amazon reviews, thanks for including it in your video Evan and Katelyn! I'm only 6 seconds in and I'm already having a blast.
i legit thought evan was screaming when i first heard the wood carving noise, it sounds like a soul in pain 😂
I have used a similar tool to the drill straight jig, owned by a friend that does a lot of 3d printing, but it was aluminum instead of plastic and made for Dremel tools.  You were supposed to clamp your dremel's flex shaft tool into it and it (supposedly) turned your dremel into a teeny tiny drill press.... But i never needed super precision drilled micro holes enough to justify buying one for myself.
Um, tell your wife about the bubble level on the back of the Dewalt drill.
I love how there’s a timestamp called we died💀😂😂
Yeah, things don't get credit for being able to be a hammer.  Anything can be a hammer if you hold it right   (Same can be said about a weapon, lol)
How long until we see pics of this video on ebay pages selling tools "used by Evan and Katelyn"?
Im laughing so hard rn- During the wood carving tool I got an ad for an electric wood carver!
Katelyn is too low to drill properly. Get her a step stool.
I hate to point out that any hand tool, is also been used as a hammer.  Show me an adjustable wrench without dents on it, and I'll show you one that has never been used.
For your resin issue I suggest a peristaltic pump. When you inevitably get resin stuck in it you can just replace the tubing.
The hammer/hammer/hammer multitool part killed my, yall had way too much fun with that one 😂
5:20 Evan falls for sunk cost fallacy
Id like to see E&K take some bad /cheap tools an re engineer them to make them better .
I'm gonna guess she could easily improve her ability to drill straight if she lowers the table she is drilling on.  Even if you you've gotten very good at drilling straight free handed, you're going to have a lot more trouble if you're piece is too high
The stick for the weeds looks like a terrible version of a great tool my mom has. It's made with a sturdy stick and a better mechanism with 4 metal grabbers, it's very good at pulling weeds out with a thick deep reaching root. I once pulled out one that had a root as thick and long as a rats tail😂 We help her every year, since the garden is big and since she's gotten that tool I'm actually having fun getting the weeds out of her lawn😂 it also hasn't broken in years and we've used it alot. If anyone else has problems with unwanted plants taking over your grass lawn you should try it out, I can only recommend it
To the guy who said it wasn't worth his time to return the item...Amazon is usually really good with refunds. If you open the chat feature and say, "This thing is a piece of crap and it broke right away" they'll probably just refund your money. I've received a few broken items from them and I've never had to return them. Jeff Bezos may be an evil little demon, LOL, but the company does have some pretty good customer service.  Oh, and if you receive a good product but yours just happens to be broken...Don't leave a negative review. I can't stand when people do that. It's not an accurate review of the item, you're really just reviewing the shipping. Ask for a replacement before leaving a review.
All tools are also hammers. Screw Driver? mini hammer. Wrench? Big hammer. Phone? Delicate hammer.
Bro, you two DYING at the hammer/hammer/pliers/hammer/screwdriver(?)/hammer KILLED ME 😂
I'm not even done watching and this is now my favorite video. Lol
Drilling guid lol
That carving motor was actually cheap. Foredoms are a few hundred dollars. Ask me how I know lol 😅
Shazam picked up on that music you're playing during the transitions as "La Segunda Nostalgia" by The Chapu. I don't see it listed in your music in the description. Is Shazam wrong? Shazam's sample sure does sound like it. I homed in on it because it sounds familiar, from another channel, but I can't remember which one and it will irritate me until I do. I say that because it's familiarity is distracting. I get it that it's a "me" problem. But any interaction gives your channel a bump in the algorithm. I have never been known for my diplomacy prowess.
That purple/orange "Words are Hard" sweater really suits Evan! Great incidental merch plug :)
Technically that "Multi-tool hammer" is metal poo.
One minute into this video and it has already made my day!
a video AND a gaming uncut upload in 1 day? spoiled 🤩
the first time i heard the electric chisel thing i actually thought it was evan screaming 😂
honestly Katelyn i would not feel bad being unable to drill straight down when the drills are way too big for the average woman's hands :( !!!
Oh god the concrete killed me 😂😂😂
I wasn't looking at the screen when Evan used the carving tool and I thought it was him mimicking the carving tool.
lol!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
My drill pimp has got me out of a few binds
Could Katelyn try drilling on a table / bench that is lower down? The equivalent height that the bench is for Evan 🙌🏻
Katelyn's editing has gotten so good, it is so entertaining to watch and gives me a show-like vibe, love it
You used the weed remover all wrong!!You are supposed to w
"oh no, hand does not fit"  rotate the drill 180 degries ffs.
Saw your video pop up and watched it instantly, besides that I was at school and couldn't have volume, and am dyslexic. It was a wild ride but I liked the vibes, so I am back.
Laughing so hard you activate the back pain means this is a great vid 😂😂😂
When Evan started laughing and his back pain started, I lost it! 😂
I'd love to see you two linocut though! It's easier! You can carve cats to print on clothes 👀
Pop
Finally a new vid❤
The power chisel you guys were going too deep shower cuts and are the chisels are not sharp enough
I dont get it. You gave the multihammer tool only 2 points while having the time of your life.
You guys should try to make diy scorch paste since you have thick it.
That carver is terrifying! The manual ones seem much safer. I do like my engraving tool but you guys have bigger tools that can do that with much less effort.
Such a laugh-inducing and fun one, you two!! My favorite was the 3 hammer + 2 plier multi-tool. SO HANDY!
to be fair, the drill guide was a lot straighter than the control. also, could you have loaded the drill the other way? so you hand was on the side that didn't have rods?
6:25 i genuenly thought Evan was screaming here at first
To be fair, there are few types of pumps you cannot ruin by running them dry...
lol =P
Every one of these are only 1 star at best, geez guys giving them 3 are you insane. This junk should be in landfill.
To be fair, running an unprimed, stalled plastic pump for more than a few seconds could only end the way it did lol
Oh boy Evan nearly died during that multitool test lmao Oh god that is some hilarious s***
3:33 major "I wanna give you a zero, but that's not possible so I will give you a one" meme vibes
The carving thing sounds like a dentist drill and it made my teeth hurt-
That drill pump, even if it was made out of more robust materials, doesn't seem to make much sense. Pretty much only good for filling up a large bucket from a kitchen sink since there is no way it could handle dirty water, it'd gum up and seize immediately.
All the way back in high school I had an art teacher that had us carving limestone rocks. It was so increadibly fun and I always wanted to get into serious carving after that. I never had tools or money, but a few years later a friend of mine showed me he was getting into wood carving. Wood carving was so much more difficult than rock carving because you had to really know how to control your hands. Which I did not! The rock carving was so slow and time consuming which is what made it appealing to me. The wood was too soft and every little nitch took out so much wood...I was left with little undistinguished knobs...  But I could TOTALLY see Evan getting into wood carving so the two of you could include it with your resin hobby ❤
That style weed puller on an actual wooden stick is a great weed puller. The cheep handle is SOOOOOO bad!
I for some reason thought the wood carver noise was Evan screaming put over the video. haha
You know.. it’s funny that w
for the first, why couldn't you hold it the other way? where the bars were on the other side of the drill. not trying to stick your hand between them. that seems like user error there.
Not to worry Katelyn, same for not drilling straight and I have to use a level to hang a picture😂🤗♥️🕊✨
I died when Evan laughed so hard his "back pain" kicked in 😂😂
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
This is a LEWK for Evan! 🔥 80s-inspo Evan ftw!
he hammer hammer hammer hammer pliers pliers tool, HEAR ME OUT! I think you can hammer it to do some of those other funky things..
I've been eagerly waiting for a video to be posted for the last 2 weeks love Ur videos and always look forward to the next one ❤
6:21 i thought it was evan screaming 😂😂❤
10:30 Evan has fully transcended from dad jokes and has evolved to sweater dad with big shop glasses unable to stop laughing at his own jokes!
Did the burnt out  light bulb in the E bother anyone else?
The multitool was really worth buying, laughing that hard is priceless :D
the electric carver for a second sounded like Evan screaming, then the new bit sounded like Katelyn screaming, i thought i was losing my mind for a minute there!
I actually think the first one has potential if it was properly developed
10:38 Evan just failing words and nearly failing to breathe from laughter is my favorite part of this whole video
When i was younger we had a nicely built (wood handle, metal grabbers) version of that weed remover and it worked really well so I'd say it's moreso that that one is incredibly cheaply made than the thing itself being a bad idea
The drill bit kind of looks bent itself
I'm legitimately upset that you gave money to the people selling these awful products 😂😂 Good entertainment content though 10/10
If you watch closely, you can see their sanity leaving their bodies right in the middle of the video 😅😂
Someone should tell her that drilling straight and level is impossible for EVERYONE, that’s why every shop has a drill press, so don’t feel bad!
It’s the full six minutes of dry laughing for me 😂
At a certain point, that electric chisel sounded like a dying Muppet 😂
So which tool is the worst not including evan guys 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I usually love your videos, but you knew they were bad quality before you bought them... and you found out they were bad quality while giving them money for the bad products. I hope you returned these items and didn't support those stores.
It's not a multitool if there's no bottle opener!!!
Honestly, the only thing Katelyn need to drill strait is an apple box. That counter is too high for her.
Most Pumps need priming, e.g the hose to be filled up.
the biggest problem of trying to pump resin is that it will clog at like 3 uses. It's not easy to remove from surfaces so it's absolutely  pointless to pass it through a tube. Maybe with hydrophobic protection but not very hopefull about that eitther
6:20 i looked away for like 2 seconds and genuinely thought that noise was evan screaming his lungs out lol, this machine sounds just like him somehow
It’s the uncontrollable laughter for me . 😂 Hilarious . I didn’t know if I was laughing at the terrible tools or you guys laughing at the terrible tools .  This episode is one of my favourites because of the sheer ridiculousness . Those tools were bad!!! Ahahahaha 😊
Tool Kiiiiiiii
What is that song they are playing during the product intro screens? Why does it sound so familiar?
Every time I feel sad or something I watch your videos. I was binge watching pumpkin experiments again and then a notification for this video came up, and you know what? I feel better now, thank you.
I have not laughed this hard for so long! Thank you 'it is also a hammer, and a hammer'
You dorks, you should prime the pump so its not burning up the impeller on the start up. Just fill the hose before the inlet then insert it into the bucket.  Love you guys :)
You guys make my day. I've loved your videos for years, and I can't wait to see what else you guys put out in the future ❤
The drill pump could work with maybe cleaning a fish tank???
Your next T-shirt quote …”Pull it all the way out to get the full experience”
when will you guys play OneShot its on steam and there is a cat in it! you two would love it
I love that the "dusting off a hammer" keeps returning. =)
Just one question.... How does 2 ratings get 1.7 stars?
So try running the carver on a slow speed, a flex shaft running at full rpm doesn't work on the hammer attachment, try 500 rpms I use a speed controller on mine and use it to engrave silver jewelry, and if you add googly eyes on he motor for it it'll improve to 5 stars
Evan laughing so hard it hurts his back… yeah I felt that 😂😂😂
I use one of those drill pumps in my storm shelter if the sump pump stops working for some reason. Had one running for almost 2 hours.
At 5:55 when Katelyn says "what are you gonna carve?" I honestly anticipated Evan going "... wood!" 😄
under an hour gang !!😎⬇
returns should give an automatic -1 review imo
I was crying laughing and was trying to tell y’all to breathe while desperately trying to breathe myself. My hubbs looks at me…I try to tell him about the video but my voice was getting higher and squeakier to the point he says “pause the video cause the dogs in the neighborhood need a break”. I laughed harder!!! Thank you guys for one of the best videos I’ve seen in quite a while 💜
I wouldn't rate any of those 'tools' above zero. Having fallen for garbage like this before, I make sure to read the comments & check the ratings, yet still take it all with a grain of salt. Remember if it seems like a steal, it probably is - the vendor stealing from YOU!
Are..... Are they okay? 🤣
THE CHISEL???? I GENUINELY THOUGHT THAT EVAN WAS SCREAMING I SHARTED MYSELF😭😭😭
But was Evans hand okay??
7:58 3.5 are you crazy?! lol! You should try a real power carver. I think good old hand powered chisels would cut better than those. Then, you are the guy that said Special K treats are better than Fruit Loops, so you have no credibility anyways😅 Love the video
The "brushing hammer workshop work" is one of my favorite long-running jokes of the channel. ❤
2:10 about the drill guide: i think you did it the wrong way (pointing about "no wiggle room"), you could just flip the chuck part to the other direction (knowing that it could also be used for forstner drill bit, also gonna solve the "no wiggle room" issue), or you could just place the grip the other way (or you know, have the drill locator by entirety face the other way or something). and i also noticed that the control test and the product test ( 2:40 ) have different sides to demonstrate the differences (control test being done with wood laying flat on the table, while the product test done with drilling the sides instead, at which the unstable demonstration happened). i felt like it's unfair demonstration, but it's fine lol
just finished the drill guide. you know you could of put the drillhandle on the other side. that way your hands wouldnt hit on the metal rods. but yes wouldnt change that much.
who comes up with these things. 4 of them are things I don't know why you would want them and the first one can be solved with A $7 drill block.
9:46 Just let that poor piece of wood die 😭
That looked like a many tree you murdered.
This was really funny! I wonder why you two have never given/made Katelyn a personalized, custom sized, workbench. :) If it were the right height, she could drill straight!
When you started laughing I started laughing so hard my mom asked me if I was ok 😂. I love your videos. They always make me happy. You are my favorite channel (all of them)❤
29m 10.044/10.045kw
The flex shaft could be useful..  Dont know about the chisel part though.. hopefully you get the drill end
I got my Words Are Hard sweater yesterday so now the whole video I feel like the Spider-Man pointing meme.
The hammer hammer hammer hammer pliers pliers tool made me laugh so much that I had to pause 4 times. I admit I drooled a bit while laughing 😅😂 That was the best purchase, recommend for good laugh ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Me: pauses to enjoy E&K unable to speak with laughter  Chapter title: We died 😂
That multi tool is something. Technically it removes nails twice: metal and finger. Oh boy my fingers involuntary curled up when that happened.
This video is hilarious.
I stepped away from my computer to do some work and at the 6:20 mark I swore it was just Evan screaming. I just heard "Can I test it?" "How is it?" "AHHHHHHH" 😂
Greatings from the other side of the world from Buenos Aires Argentina 😊
Now you should go buy the good versions of these products
The laughing fit at the "hammer" got me so bad. You two are delightful
Y’all’s content is the best ever 🐢 also merry Christmas
What are you gonna carve? ✨cats✨
You two seem like such fun people to talk to
When the sculpting tool started to make noise I fully thought it was just Evan screaming for a full minute
10:35 lmfao🤣
YOU HAVE TO PRIME THE FREAKING PUMP!!!!!!!
"a fun science experiment for weirdos" explains the whole channel
yooo is it just me or did yall step it up with the editing and transitions in the video?? absolute banger!! ❤❤❤
I laughed just as hard if not harder that Evan was!!! Do more of these PLEASE 💜💜
never run a pump dry
Hi, i dont coment much, but for the ingraver idk what wood you used, just as i learned it should be soft wood and more moist. If that dose not work maybe try using it as a shaker for molds and concrete and such
so excited to see you guys posted a new vid!
15:05 - You have to prime a pump, or you just grind it.
I thought Evan wrote « HELP » instead of « I ❤ U » 😂😂
Get a drill press with Katelyn’s name on it
It's not unusual that pumps need to be primed first (water needs to be in the chamber) before they work.
2:50 Shouldn't the drill be mounted with the handle turning the other way?
I love your videos so much be been watching since I was a kid (just turned 18 🤪) watch u guys all the time when I’m not feeling too good. Always brightens my day
yay excited for this video! hang in there Evan my bf has a slipped disk and i have chronic pain so I know it can get pretty bad be kind to yourself about work and allow yourself time to rest.
Love you guys your my favorite YouTubers!!!!!!!!❤❤❤
Had so much fun watching 😊 The first drill thing could work better if you flip the drill handle to the other side so you have space for your hand 💡
Katelyn's height is reducing her ability to drill straight. Maybe if she stands on a bench, she would have more control.
I dont think ive seen Evan laugh so hard he squeaks 😂
Katelyn: "How is it?" The wood: * screaming *
Holy crap, laughed soooo hard at this episode! Loved this one!
your ratings are way too generous…
Dont know about the carver but the flex shaft rotary grinder is soo usefull! When you just quickly have to deburr or grind something
That "(under $15)" in the title was absolutely passive aggressively added by Katelyn
6:19 I LEGIT THOUGHT THAT WAS A SCREAM! Like... "Why is Evan screaming so mu- oh..."
as a wise man once said: "everything is a hammer, at least once"
I love your videos.❤
good make a full workshop for under 100 dollars plz  love ur vuds
This electric wood carver cuts worse than a manual one
this is exactly what i needed today, i accidentally slept through my last exam of the semester and i was so stressed out, the teacher is the best and is letting me retake it, but this video will be perfect for de-stressing, i love your videos you’re the best <3
Maybe wax carving?
I literally love you guys, everytime I’m bored or when I’m baking and need something to watch I would always looks for you guys videos.They are so entertaining and funny. Ps: love the editing
Hey! Excited for this!! ❤
If you turned the drill around your hand would have more room. And you can't compare drilling on the flat edge to drilling on the wobbly side.
You know a product has to be good when it has 10 words in its name.   Who needs a single snappy brand-name when you can make the title of your product just explain everything about it!
Evan will ALWAYS buy the expensive thing is what we learned through these adventures
This was released 8 minutes ago ago and I can confirm that this was a good video and I watched all 22 minutes. I come from the future. Yes time travel exists 15 minutes from now. I knew you were going to ask that, because of time travel.
Lol, this is the most evan and Katelyn thing ive ever watched
I felt for the drill and straight you could have come from the other side where he poles do not get hit with your hand.  I am writing this mid point of that where it was stated there are no zero stars.
My favourite thing about your videos is Katelyn's editing!💛
Ooh and E&K upload, todays a good day
This will cheer me up after a 3D printer clog!
never seen the bottom of your chat before lol
You guys are awesome love your channel
I cried laughing at that multitool part :D

There was a cup turner photoshopped into a bunch a pictures and one of them was of a couple having a candlelight dinner.  It wasn’t on the table or even in the restaurant. It was outside the window like it was stalking them.

Hi guys

Also for those wondering about Evan's back: it's pretty bad right now and still affecting how much he can do on a daily basis. Our video schedule might be affected while we're trying not to push too hard. Hopefully he can avoid surgery but only time will tell. We'll try to give more updates as we have them.
