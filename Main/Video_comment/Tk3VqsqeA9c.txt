greedy
The biggest crap is when clubs start a super league... In the third case, some club will steal a large amount of money. You know what I want to tell you (stealing money for your own interests) Clubs should compete and not deal with other things. Here nui more in the game just the game as such. The Super League is the brainchild of certain lobbies who want to get rich. The game of football itself will no longer make sense.
The cheek of Man City and rotor ham to think they’re big clubs 😂
If they had gone ahead with this, I would have burned my Liverpool shirt and never supported the club ever again.
When does it start? I thought it was supposed to be starting in 2022, but there are only three and a half weeks left of the year, so I assume it's going to start very soon! I would have thought they wouldn't have held it when the World Cup's on. So, I assume then that it'll start after its Final on 18th December then! _ _ _ _ What's that? _ _ _ It's been cancelled? Did I blink and miss something? I was wondering why I hadn't heard about it for a while! One minute it was all over the media and next moment I wasn't hearing anything about it anymore! I must have blinked, and it was cancelled whilst I was blinking, or something! Oh, I was SO looking forward to watching all those plastic clubs playing each other endlessly and repetitively in their elitist private members club! Who doesn't want to watch Barca and Real play each other again and again and again endlessly in "El Plastico", or whatever it is called?
Then when this "Super League" gonna start the competition???
I remember seeing the announcement on Twitter and running to SSN to see if it was real and my heart sank. Then to watch the Super League collapse on Twitter.  The biggest win was football Twitter collecting against this
Should have all been relegated automatically
Never forget this nearly happened. I’ve always been a United fan but since this happened I have struggled to feel any connection to them. I will never forgive them for trying do this and kill the game we love.
Let’s face it, It will happen one day. I’m dead against it, but money talks
Rip super league you will not be missed 🤮🤢
Why so many dislikes
Premier league fa cup carbon Cup champions league Europa league have all run they course and don't matter in what other jackass fans or other ex players say cause ye all a pack of stupid retarded jackasses
Confirmed income for these clubs
It’s been a month and I still watch this just to laugh at this farce 😂😂😂
This isn’t the end, it’s just the beginning. The clubs involved have made a mess of this project but make no mistake, it is in an embryonic state and will definitely happen eventually, it’s just a matter of compromise with UEFA who will sanction a Super League when it is suitably compensated.
Tottenham????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trickle down economics, huh? That works.
Its over guys
Is NBA good for basketball?
The rich gets richer.
10 likes and I’ll release my Disstrack on super league
This is hilarious, Sky Sports narrative manipulating sports fans as they have the most to lose. Gullible fans sucking it up for Rupert Murdock. I love it. Doesn't feel good when its happening to you does it? Karma coming back to haunt them. I personally don't care whether the teams stay or go, but I'm enjoying watching Sky, UEFA and FIFA getting a taste of their own medicine.  LOL, 1000 CHELSEA FANS OUTSIDE THE STADIUM,  ZERO ARSENAL FANS PROTESTING OUTSIDE THE EMIRATES.  you can't make this stuff up, Arsenal fans know this is there only chance to be relevant and competitive again.
Here I am a hard-core Chelsea Fan and it feels really bad to see Chelsea being part of this money laundering project. What a disgrace indeed
Sky sports stfup, I’m not even subbed to u. Why are u in my notifications
*JEBAĆ SUPERLIGĘ* 🇵🇱🖕S****League
As a united fan... I have just burnt my top... being a fan for over 30 years. Glazer... disgraceful.
Total elitism..
I love the idea
It will become boring
And what exactly makes Tottenham super? What late achievement does qualify them to be part of the 12? This whole idea of a new super league is just a bad joke...
Sadly the Middle East and Asian market will lap this up as they sit at home with their replica Ronaldo and Messi shirts on, probably not even knowing about the history of the club they 'support'! This is the market they want, and the Yanks of course. The real fans don't matter, no-one cares about them.
Wdf is going.
So Leicester will win the premier league this year probably BRAVO 👏 EXCELLENT EFFORT 🙌🏽
Go ESL!!!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️🙌🏼🙌🏼Whooooo!!! 🗣️🗣️🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼😆😆
Fans don’t attend and it dies.  But fans will attend
what is my total price? of mouse an keyboard
No one should watch it then they will have to cancel it
I'm a real madrid fan but I'm not gonna support any teams in this shitty ESL
No
Je soutiens la super ligue à 💯 je dis bien à 100 pour cent . On va enfin une ligue intéressante ou il est impossible de prédire le vainqueur à l avance. ...ça permet de tester quelque chose de nouveau et si c’est un échec ben ils reviendront à la formule ancienne. Vamos Perez. Le PSG est prisonnier des intérêts français hélas, sinon il aurait été intéressant qu ils rejoignent ce groupe. L UEFA a besoin d un bon coup de pied au cul. Vamos Perez.😄
Like vaccines, digital passports etc, after a while, despite complaining, people will just accept it.  Life goes on
Kettle calling the pot black for me. Euro super league and Sky, just 2 greedy pigs at the one trough. The hypocrisy knows no limits. 👎
It’s a ridiculous idea
ESL is the future !
Time to choose you 2nd liked team
Where is the 10 billion coming from? Who is paying these clubs all this money?
Wtf spurs doin
Liverpool being the fan's club was fake at the end
Can somebody explain to me why everyone is mad about this , it seems like a great idea to me we get elite clubs competing against elite club
How can it possibley help the football pyramid when none of the founding clubs can get relagated!? Disgusting!!
I'm not a huge football fan or anything, but this is STUPID. (I'm an NBA fan)
Lol he had to take a pause when reading his much they would be getting
Damn, I’m just go and support Leicester. Biggest club near where I live. Bye Arsenal 👋🏽
12 big clowns!
i agree with the super league, can't wait to watch
Have a super league but hold it once every 3 years. “Big Clubs” get extra revenue and there’s still some form of novelty. And players will be less worn out from the extra matches too. Big Players who have “won it all” such as Ronaldo and Messi have new motivation as well and will be motivated to stay on with their respective clubs. Ofc this super league should have its own “relegation system” such that only the top 20 teams in the world qualify every 3 years. (Or a qualifying metric based on past 3 years performance in the champions league). Win for clubs, win for fans.
all other clubs should sign agreements to never sell a player to these clubs ever agian that way gl farming the non top clubs for there players
At first you can't believe it, "My - *insert club here* - ? REALLY?" But then you think about it again, and the owners all were ready to do this if they felt they had to.
surprised that Spurs wants to join this gang...with all the big teams not in EPL,they could finally win a league title...😂
if we just dont watch the matches , the league they will end up in a loss and eventually stop
Nothing is a disgrace... UEFA should stick to national/country games  Must they handle both club & national team   Abeg let give super league a chance  Is UEFA FREE FROM CORRUPTION?
Shameful
Just seeing Uefa cry about the ESL makes me think it is one of the best ideas football has ever seen. When the corrupt are afraid of loosing their seats, something is going well
Brb imma gonna start to watch so called "farmers league" that CLEARLY are respecting the fans
america got involved in the middle east and look at what happened
i dont like this but .. i guess its for the future ?  money is king .. remember ..
The PL did the same thing to the championship and FA.  Has everyone forgotten?
dogshit
But hey,  if arsenal and psg or Barca vs Juventus are playing eachother,  you won't watch it?  Course you would
If the big six are out, PL will be wayy more interesting
Bring it on
The nba of ⚽️⚽️
12 clubs have come together. Wrong, 12 owners.
Absolute disgrace
U just lost a billion fans this is ridiculous shows the wealth gap.. needs to turn in to nba where players get and attain more power... is inter miami gonna be one? 😂
I thought covid is bad... My God what's wrong with our beloved football has become!
Will open african champion league
Get out of our football, the American financial giants. we don't want another Major League.
Sky and bt will be there too 💰💰all greedy the lot of them !!!
This league will be a bore it will be like Uefa champions league every week
The real dirty dozen.
Nottingham forrest as my 2nd team, is now my 1st, bye liverpool
Meh... all shouting boycott will hypocritically watch these games.  this is good way to shake up old and boring league when the bottom 12 teams in each of these top team's respective leagues do not pose any competition and these top team simply have to do their chore to play them. If its about money,,,, hell YES... that makes more sense.. you want your team to have best players, coaches and facility.... it doesnt come free and charity.   This will be more fun to watch rather than some Tier 1 team thrashing relegation team. So stop bitching
What’s everybody so upset about
i hope these clubs will all be liquidated or the owners fined into oblivion they cannot be allowed to get away with this i also hope that every fan of these clubs continue to fight this and boycott their clubs making sure they gain no more revenue from fans    they want to think they have all the power? i think it's time to show them who really has the power
Don't let foreigners buy English clubs. They don't care if our national sport is ruined. I won't watch Man United or buy a single product, ever again.
What does this super League mean??
Football is finished if it happens.
Good by to the, clubs  c ya
We've emotions attached with these competitions. As a city fan I've always wanted us to win the UCL and was always heartbroken when we failed to do so. I don't think we can generate those emotions for a new competition made for fixed number of members who have joined just for money. Football is becoming more of a business than a game. Disappointed.
Those walthy billionaires has put so much money to this. Its soo much, it is too much to loose. It is up to you pheasants whether to support this and make them even richer or turn your back away and not support them by not buying season tickets and tv subscriptions.
Goodbye football, what a shame, going the same way as boxing and formula 1!
I'm not gonna support my team anymore . Money and politics have ruined football. Greedy people forgetting what the game is all about
Absolute disgrace all of these owners
"Capitalism is only cool when it's done onto others, not on us" -western population
Money money money 🤣
Its not "the clubs", its the bosses of the clubs, its their fault. Thats an important difference. Its not the players, the trainers, the employees, the fans, its the bosses of these clubs.
ESL is the form of a fight back from them againts the corrupted UEFA and FIFA. ✌🏻
Lots of money involved!
what the hell happened in this week?
Im so relieved, that the Bundesliga wont change! Im sorry for the premier league...
This is exciting, I'm up for it!
It's just a game.   "There you again with your first world problems, when your living is easy"
Did each club's supporters agree with this league?  Time to show them who is boss!!  How much longer are supporters willing to be extorted...
The owners are not from Europe. They don’t understand European football culture
Why the english are angry. UK isnt in the EU anymore. Is called European Super Liga. ;) look the list  most english Clubs.  ;)
Wanger saw it coming 10 years ago
People are going to like this once it is implemented
France and germany 👍👍
NO WAY THATS IT FOOTBALL IS OVER
Just imagining the profits for these founding clubs is crazy
Bloody traitors bastards I was an Arsenal supporter, but not anymore They sold themselves even knowing that it will destroy football Shame on you, not only Arsenal but all the 12 dirty bastards 👿👿
I'm just done, never saw this day coming. I'm outta here, support my local team now tbh if possible...
I agree with this new money-grabbing league only if they share the billions of euros with the players. I just hope it produces fun games to watch.
Maybe this problem because of pandemic. And no one know team's financial than the president.. thats why they want something that can give more profit for the team.. because UEFA and FIFA didnt give or maybe don't care about it.. so they fight for this
There is only one way this league will not  run and that is the fans if the fans watch they are going to make money and keep running this stupid league
All fans hate it. Won’t succeed!
It's All About Money, No More Excitement, Football Is Dying, and Is A Disgrace (Quote from Mark Goldbrige LOL)
Call them out...the owners of the clubs who are betraying football and the fans. I don’t mind getting used to a league without these teams. Let s make these clubs gradually irrelevant!
Eufa and national leagues have to ban them, can't compromise. Because their goal is to replace both eufa and national leagues to form an Europe-wide league with many divisions. The point is what is better for us fans, national leagues and eufa league based on that or an united Europe-wide league. Europe-wide league is good for more regular competion of good clubs. But the danger come from Founding members and their bosses can hold too much power. And this kind of "globalization" in football will kill small clubs with very hard competition.
If they follow the american NFL/NBA/MLB format, there will be a time, I  can guaranteed it,  when the ManUtd, Arsenal, Liverpool or even Real  Madrid, will be playing out of New Jersey or Qatar, or Singapore or  Shangai, or Hong Kong or even Wuhan... They can take your team,  your  franchise name, all the history in the game out from where they were  born, such as England, Italy or Spain and  relocate them to where they  will pay them, screwing up the local fans for ever...
Goodbye football...Goodbye everything💀
I love it. Out with the old. In with the new. Ac Milan will once again be Ac MONEY 😍😍❤️
Now the teams are becoming corporations
They must have a big reason to do us like this
Don't even support a big club just follow my hometown club ipswich and love them so Stick with them as it's in my blood. All i see in Ipswich and Colchester are plastic fans with sports direct big club shirts.. If this happens wonder if these plastics will have the balls to wear so called big club shirts then.. I love football and love the history of the english league pyramid as everyone has a shot at going up the league's but if this happens it will rip the heart and hope of the game 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬😤😤😤
Welp it's not to late for me to support a new team.
This is total corruption! AC Milan, Man United , Arsenal can’t qualify to champions league!
So why does Arsenal London, currently 9th. In the Premier League think they have the right to no longer having to qualify for a European competition  ? Just an example of many !
we already have this in football its called UEFA champions League.  irs corrupt and the greed it apparent.  no need for europeon super league.   Champions league.
It is many years since football ceased to be a sport and became an industry. I wonder why the Banks don't call in the overdrafts of the clubs involved in this latest racket, as well as all the overdrafts of all the players who play for them, and put a time limit by which the overdrafts must be cleared. Fight  fire with fire. The proposed 'Super League' would soon loose all its appeal, when the clubs are forced  out of becoming prima donnas, like many of their vastly overpaid players. This would be further hastened by ALL spectators and club 'members' , revoking their memberships and ceasing to pay club 'dues'. No income forces closure. Football could become a real sport again, instead of being the money printing machine it has become. My tip, if you love football, watch local non-league teams and encourage their players.
How the f'ck did spurs get an invite 😆.  But seriously hope the owners lose money
It's never gonna happen. No chance. They're just manoeuvring for a better cut of Champion's League cash. Still terrible way of going about it though. Won't be forgotten (I'm a Spurs fan). Greedy and selfish.
Stop selling fodbold clubs to Americans
And just gotta say why is Tottenham there....
Big6😂 4 of em are not in the top 4 right now in premiership no wonder they want their own league
I love how they call it the Super League.  All the other teams will have to be in the Villain Regime to even things out.
Nice to know that football clubs know how to not get people to watch them
This is a joke
This all happen because of UEFA .. it is uefa faut as they are expected to reduce the gain for clubs
A world league come on what an amazing idea
The nwo of football the great reset of football
Heartless...   Super League? Without Me! ☺
If the games are fire. It will stand
Europaen Super League biasa itu 👎 nya
This is BOLLOCKS EVO EFC,
Bravo 👏
Hmm UEFA and FIFA is not happy about that? Hmm okay, that´s good! I´m not happy about UEFA marking Slavia Prague as a racist club so screw them and will remain a Rossoneri fan with or without of the existence of European Super League! Sempre Milan!
Dry you're eyes, Cant wait, well done the 6 ,3.5 billion dam right
Shame on these founding teams. As a MU fan, I feel disgusted for the MU management.
AFTER 50 YEARS SUPPORTING MANCHESTER UNITED IT BREAKS MY HEART TO SAY BYE-BYE ILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER GAME AT OLD TRAFFORD OR ON TV GLAZERS ARE SNAKES THAT NEED TAKING OUT
Play badminton britain,oh i forget you flop with that lol
YES FOR SUPER LEAGUE!!!
i hope Chelsea come to their senses and abandon this league.
this was a bad idea
Let's take this time to acknowledge the smart moves of both the Ligue1 and Bundesliga clubs
I this bloke just reading the news off his phone 😂, sports journalism definitely isn’t up to much these days is it.
these 12 clubs are simply despicable!  I will appreciate their defeats.  Such a bad image and a disgusting example!  £ $ €... but ultimately, is there still any point in looking at this kind of fake competition with no soul and no glory? A complete empty shell😂
This will gona to be the greatest league on earth people that think that I am saying true like this
I don't get why everyone is upset for this European Super League.  You fans did NOTHING when all the players of your beloved football team took a knee as submissive slaves in order to appease the blm b4st4rdz. And now you complain for this bs.  PATHETIC.
The superleague! (AKA The death of football...)
Like drogba would “it’s a disgrace , it’s a f*cking disgrace”
I no longer feel I can sport Liverpool and it is the hardest thing I think I could ever say, football is on a life support machine and it will now turned off in this next week I am going to channel my support in my local club and make sure they are given my money to keep them afloat, To all my fellow football fans ( even man united fans) I morn with you in the death of football
I’m not very familiar with soccer so can someone explain what this means?
It will happen Good old days are gone forever Money Talks 💰💰💰💰💰👈😁
Football is dead as a man u fan i am angry
Football is dying already, this is final nail in the coffin, these clubs are aware of it and this move might be the worst ever, but nothing we can do about it
Its a disgrace I've been a Manchester United fan my entire life football is over
It was inevitable this would happen. Football is big money business and has to move forward. Some teams are far to big and powerful for the leagues they are in.
I'm against this superleague but also if it stays true I won't lie this is one football tournament I won't even skip one damn match 😂😂🤣
did you see that ludicrous display last night?
UGH CANT WE JUST HAVE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THIS IS BORING I AM HAPPY THAT ARSENAL MADE IT BUT THEN WHEN A TEAM MAKES TOP 4 NOTHING FOR THEM
What’s the threat?
What is Tottenham doing the "super league" when they havent even won a single champions league title? LMAO
boycot  the super league
If the owners of these clubs are so concerned about their fans desires perhaps they'd like to reduce ticket prices so they can actually afford to watch a match (after covid of course).
Ac milan? Spurs?
Can't wait to see the new league 😊
Anyone who supports this proposal needs to get the hell out of our game. No true supporter would so readily cast aside over 100 years of tradition.     Frankly, Stuff the "global audience".  Our domestic game is more important than their entertainment.  They aren't part of football. They don't, can't and will NEVER "get it" like true supporters who turn up at the turnstiles week in and week out at all levels.   This absolutely must be squashed at all costs and the perpetrators HEAVILY sanctioned to the point of full lifetime bans from domestic competition for any player willing to take the money.
Nah is he actually reading off a phone with a flip cover😭😭
Cut these Clubs off and their players from every other league and competition.
Is nobody else wondering who is funding this €3.5 Billion? Or have I missed something
Disgusting. All of it.
Americam capitalists would leverage peoples healthcare for money if they could (they do in America) so football wont cause them to loose any sleep. They must be stopped
Jp morgan the real culprit imo 🧐
RIP FOOTBALL
The most stupid rule ever in football history!
Simpel. Dont go to the game or watch the game . Its all about money so lets not support these bastards
Dislike =no super league
By our responsibilities as big clubs he means, is to make as much money as possible. Football is finished
Read my lips "NO MORE FOOTBALL.
As someone who doesn't really care about league football in any country, this actually seems like a good idea to me. One league, where all the best players compete? Might actually pay attention to that...
UEFA MAFIA
All the leagues from the founding clubs should ban them FROM EVERYTHING! No premier league for you, no la liga for you, no Serie A for you, no nothing.
Great reset🤡
What gonna happen with the champions league? With this be coming reality very soon
6:03 to 6:36 FFP! FFPPPPPPPPP!
The “BIG 6” NEED to take a stand for Football when & wherever they can, MNF, SUPER SUNDAY.. ECT. It’s more than the Clubs now, players from the “BIG 6” would lose the right & honour to play and represent they’re country for Greed, Selfishness and Wealth. They need to realise how they started, and where they’re footballing Journey began, why they fell in love with the game so many of us also love. Strictly speaking I want to see the Various England Nationals take a stand & use the platforms they have to voice they’re views and opinions on the matter at hand. Enough is Enough.
UEFA MONEY VS ESL MONEY . Just take u r time n think guys y UEFA is saying  players cant play in world cup is a black mail so they will fight with there club . If these big teams leaves pl will not hav money they will lose n series n laliga as well . So its money vs money situation.  Everything is money but esl rules r harsh. I love esl idea but they r disadvantages  . UEFA says we care about fans why r they starting conference league only to make more money across europe
So glad I dont support one of these clubs
Ladz, this ain’t no conspiracy theory. Hear me out. These 12 clubs have created this super league as a leverage in negotiations with their respective local league. You see, a couple of years back, the big teams that dominated their local leagues made quite a large percentage of their league’s TV rights. This was based on the popularity of each match being watched on TV. This led to a wider ‘club worth’ gap between clubs in the same league and results like Barcelona 7-1. And these big clubs basically dominated. But recently, the leagues have caught up on this and begun distributing the money almost evenly to the clubs in the league. Which is giving less popular clubs more money and so better transfers, and resources. So the big clubs are not happy about this, because A they aren’t getting as much % money as they used to and B, because these less popular teams are now better equipped and put up tougher games against the big clubs. Therefore, the big clubs have created this super league as a negotiating tool to allow for greater percentage profits from their respective leagues. I honestly think that this super league won’t happen as the repercussions on the clubs is too big, but it will help them secure a bigger share of the TV rights $ in their league.
No agreement , no surrender to these mercenaries , greedy b@stards !
As much as it would be morally right for the football world to be united and boycott this proposed Super league, something tells me that TV companies such as Sky would jump at the first opportunity to snap the rights to show this.
esl might be a good thing for football
*world football
No this isn't needed at all
All they want is money 💰 the super league has to go
All that money to support the new League? Why not use the money to support clubs that are dying? Or people that are dying of COVID?
Even the IPL had resistance from conception. This will transform football to new heights.
Why banning the teams if they r not happy with eufa... Teams should be able to choose thier prefer European cup competition
Its all the fault of English football club ex owners who sold their clubs to Arabs, Russians and Asians, why do they complain now?
this silly competition should be rename as, "european super league ft. arsenal and spurs as reguler guest"
I actually love this as a fan   No bs tournament style but everyone play everyone and see who gets the most pts
I’m a foreign armchair fan who consumes football exclusively via highlights and who only has appreciation for goals and tricks in football and not tactics and I think this is great to  play Real Madrid and Barcelona every week.
I can't wait for this.... Go to hell idealism
Good news... 😊
All about money same as when sky  got the footy years ago.
Bayern, Dortmund, Leipzig and Leverkusen already said Nay. You have to dig really deep if you want some teams from Germany. :D You can ask Schalke, they are currently last place in the Bundesliga, and their demotion is basically sealed. They might need some money.
I was gonna buy a Manchester United kit not any more hello dourtment shirt 👋👋🏾
NBA€$€$ süper league
A sad sad day for football.
They want to stay big clubs forever, so they get together and form a league that they cant be relegated from. Lol
And they cant buy foreign players now😔😔
Thank goodness I'm a Barcelona fan so this means nothing to me.
"Black Tuesday" 20th April 2021 is the time to unfollow these clubs on social media.
I'M SORRY BUT THE FACT THAT THIS VID HAS 10K LIKES (BOYCOTT THIS)
We have to fight against it
If all of their fans left then that would serve them right
Yay for var I'd rather have var than this shite
They are **** ing football
I’m taking down my flag as much as it hurts I can’t support this
im not sure if i liike or hate the idea because idk this is just very surprising i dont think that it will ruin football i think the premier league world cup champions league and so on are gonna be the same but with the super league asswell
I wouldn't mind the idea of a Super League if there were 2 tiers consisting of 20 teams each with a promotion relegation system.
Sky is only salty about this because they haven't secured broadcasting rites. If they had done they would be singing praises for the ESL because they're all about the money too.
Europeans are sad, others are excited
anyone here who supports the Premier League like me? im chelsea fan btw
Will they still be playing in the prem and Ucl the rest of this season
Im just sorry for the fans, the players and the managers
The day football goes all F1, a sport for the wealthy not the fans!
"Open a new chapter"??😂 its the end of the book now😤
Can someone please explain to me why this is so frowned upon? For me it seems like a great idea, to see the best of the best compete against each other on a weekly basis... This is exactly what the NBA does with basketball... if you ask m, that works pretty well
I may have to support another team now
Rest in peace FPL
Why it's even happening
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I don’t get it. There is already a league similar to the super league is called Champions league and Europa league. Why the need to get another league?
If this really takes place then i will support luton town fc rather than Chelsea 😭😭😭. A man can change his religion but he can't change his football club. But i love football. And to save it from those money dog i will even change my beloved Chelsea 😭😭😭
Another sign of last days :” men will be lovers of money, betrayers” 🤦🏾‍♂️
"As flies to wanton boys we are for the Gods, they kill us for the sport. Soon the science will not only be able to slow down the aging of the cells, soon the science will fix the cells to the state, and so, we will become eternal. Only accidents, crimes, wars will still kill us. But unfortunately, crimes and wars will multiply. I love football." - Eric Cantona    The Gods, FIFA and UEFA, kill players for the sport. They feed and profit on the dreams of those too young to realize how replaceable they are. As idols are created and made eternal, more dreams will be born. More people will be exploited, and those made eternal, will keep being exploited, until they've nothing left to give. I love football.
Half the clubs are garbage in international comperisons if you look at their latest track records. Teams like AC Milan who are even struggling in Europa league. Smh
Put them down to the non league, take their funds, replace them with the top 6 of each league so the top six of the championship will be in the Premier league, remove relagation this season so they can all stay up and restart the season
The real football has just begun 😍
What is going on
Many teams lost millions, maybe billions during the pandemic. Jts the reason why they are moving forward with this plan. Maybe it will temporary.
Its funny that everyone opposing this league will end up watching all the matches
Only reason sky care is because they aren’t involved and the potential for all the money they put in going down the toilet, love it
Where's all this money coming from?
European Soccer League. Nobody wants this NFL American crap in our beautiful game...
deduct 50 points from these clubs for each season and see how big they are after that
Can someone explain why this is a big issue (not trying to argue it isn't, just quite oblivious rn)
super league they call it huuhhh......it is more of a cowards league....is china behind this too??
This is just messed up. Why don’t the players just stand up and say they don’t want to play
people always say "boycott" blablabla. Owners are not dumb, eventually people will forget and itll be the new normal and they will make more money. Cmon, yall thought the elite havent thought of this reaction? They understand human nature and that with time we wont give a sht anymore and just enjoy the games.
They do realise that if it goes through, which it never will, no fans are gonna watch the games and they wont earn anything
Football and var is wrestling in disguise totally corrupt
It's these lockdown measures, no fans in stadiums, no gate takings for the clubs. To me I see this as 'competitive' friendlies.
Its all just about money if u want to ban them u have to limit players crazy wages....
Clearly just about a business model for the future. Only dollars. Americans don’t understand the history Arabs want money. This has to be stopped. BAN foreign ownership ! Take the hit in lower player salaries and it will come better again likely with better British National side performances. The Real Fans won’t care about super leagues !!
Florentino is such a clown 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Disgusting , Dishonoreble, Disrespectful, Disgraceful, Despicable 😭
Boycott and when they realise there aren't fans putting money in, they'll want to come crawling back
Buy Fifa and UEFA Is a maffia, it's no Wonder the biggest clubs are creating this, I think it's great news bojkott the Uefa/Fifa maffia
This is weired idea
This is not the end of football. This is the beginning of a new era. Fifa and Uefa should stop acting like they own football.  Yup this all about money, it's always about money. Clubs wants more money cause the owners are all businessman and they greedy. On the other side fifa and uefa want to keep the old system cause they corrupt.
"Made by the poor, stolen by the rich"
Hey pls support our teams pls 😭😭😭 Pls pls if we didn't support we will not see laliga or seria a or premiere league pls support our teams to go in old league pls pls 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 pls pls don't let they go okay
😡
f××k superleague🤮🤮🤮
I didn't realize European football teams are currently non-profits! It seems all the anti SL folks are bitching about money, money, money, greed, greed, greed. I don't think any ones goes into business with the idea they wouldn't make money. Club owners are no different.
That's why i hate money👎
Remember when boxing started generating new belts... new stupidity all for money.   Now nobody takes them serious.
If I played for any of these clubs I'd be very worried will I be allowed to play for my country at the Euros ??? I don't think they should be allowed !!!! And if I was one of these players I'd be looking for a club who are not involved in this rubbish !!!
The European super league want to kick the champions league and Eufa  period 🙂🙂
As a United fan and I am absolutely angry, football is dead
What idiot would want to do this it’s going to ruin football, honestly they have no brain
Listen I'm opposed to this form of super league. But i have always thought they should do something like this. But the way they are trying to set it up is stupid. There is no competition. It should be that the lowest two clubs of each league (Premier, Bundesliga etc) should be relegated out of the super league and the top two teams of those domestic leagues should be promoted into the super league.
Everybody should refuse to watch the super league
The best solution if big players like Pogba, rashford , jesus , if these big players start resigning and saying no to this or else it wont happen.
The Premier Leauge  History Will Never Be The Same Again, *Its Eleven Heaven For jamie Vardy* *Woah OHHH CAPTAIN MARVEL WHER YOU WANT YOUR STAUE VINCENT KOMPANY* *Oh YESSSS WELCOME TO MANCHESTER* *into Lampard ESSIENNNN* *OH no Gerrad Slipped*😖😭 *Oh What a Hit Son WHAT A HIT* LAST BUT NOT LEAST *Man Utd Have Done All They can here Man city are STILL alive Balotelli AGUEROOOOOOOOO*  I swear we Will Never See Anything Like This ever AGAIN and He was right about that football is now ruined It will never be the same agin
Are you telling me you have never seen members of an organization gets tired of the organization and say we can do better than this and do do it?
Can't wait to see how much Sky bid for the TV rights. What will Gary Neville have to say then .
Literally football became trade totally
Can someone explain why it’s wrong? Isn’t it just better competition?
UEFA should just courier the Champions League trophy to Paris, irrespective of how this plays out.
How long before all these presenters get a few quid to change their tunes? At that point it’s America 2.0
Its basically the clubs that if var goes against them they think that the game was paid off
There needs to be a unified front from all the fans of these 6 teams now, taking away the cash cow for these owners.   If you're a true fan of the beautiful game, you can start by unfollowing your club and their players, if they're one of the 12 teams announced as having joined this (un)Super League, on all social media platforms.  There has to be a unified boycott to get our teams back. Will happily stand next to the supporters of the other teams in voicing my anger at this news.  Disgusted with the actions of my football club. Ashamed to call myself a fan as it stands now. Watched many fan forum reactions of all teams and everyone has voiced the same views, so there now needs to be a collective shunning until these people (owners) are gone.   Gutted Utd supporter.
Im almost 30 and never ever would i thought this would happen my last weeks as a United fan are done after 20years im done with Them smh sad days coming 😢
Ban those clubs from the current season and adjust the league accordingly
Is this actually going to happen? If it is it is a disgrace I am no longer a chelsea supporter
This is pretty much the world right now we have more money so we have the power 🙈😂. People will still go and watch it tho, because they are morons 🙈😂
I am not a fan of any of the 12 clubs. Fans should go and support their 'second' team (we all have one!), even better if they are in one of the lower leagues. These clubs desperately need our money. I would be more than happy to give it to them instead of one of these greedy clubs. Football without fans is nothing.
Don't we already have this concept running for years and years? a league full of  champions? Oh yeahh its called CHAMPIONS freakin LEAGUE!  One of these so called "founding clubs" will be looking back at this moment aa their downfall. Something's gotta give.
While making this decision, the clubs have made no discussions with two most important stakeholders: 1. The fans 2. The players Their billions of dollars are just paper without these two.
I rather to support Liverpool in Champhionship or even League 2 or even the lowest league in England, rather than support them in this stupid breakaway league. If they choose to do it than i choose to turn Blue After 20 year never think there will an end to support but it coming closer
Boycott
How did Arsenal made it in?
So we now have to get ready for regular defeats 😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Kick them out of everything. Including UEFA, FIFA, the FA, the PL, everything. For the fans of those clubs this is the same as Wimbledon moving to Milton Keynes, except by 12 of the biggest clubs in Europe. Its seismic, but we’ll get over it in time.
sky sports saying "its all about money" is rich but I do agree.
Cause Man City wanna chase quintuple 🤣
Football is ruined 😭
everything is for money now !
a fight between the rich who own the FA the EUEFA the FIFA and the rich who own big clubs... and they all use fans in their argument... fans should boycott clubs merchandise
this is so stupid uefa are idiots
They should be banned from playing in all competitions with immediate effect until they sign agreements.
And you'll always walk alone.
shame shame shame.
Scam world continues. Since 2020 weve all been played by elite scum changing ways of life.
12th of April 2021 the day Football Died R.I.P
This will be the beast leauge in the World
Great news
It’s on the players to save the game...
Follow the the irish leauge boys we wont sell ye out
European Super League? more like England Super League
The Americans are laughing at us now
As an American, this sounds like all of our sports leagues or even our college leagues.  The super league is the NBA and everyone else is now the G League or this is the SEC and everyone else is now some mid-major conference.
“English and European clubs” England is in Europe bro
ESL not willing to work with UEFA. There's huge overlap and conflict of interest.
Just give FIFA, UEFA, and all  the national base league a fare share, they will stop complaining and you will never seen this issue brought up. Football is already ruined by money long before this day. 😑
“Respond to their desire “..... no one asked for this 🤦‍♂️
I m a barca fan . Now I will support West Ham now.
Boycott the big 6
Do any British fans want to watch this freak show tournament? This will appeal to the armchair "supporters" who have Liverpool & Real Madrid bed sheets and curtains in  Asia and America but have not an will not ever attend a game. Revamp the current structure of the domestic and European competitions? Yes. Walk away from it all to play the same 11 teams until the arse falls out of it? Away you go.
And fifa is not about money ????
Boycott the European Super League!
Proud to be a Bayern Fan even more !  ❤🤍
Horrible
Basketball, here I come!
It's just a tour of friendlies and without income from the normal leagues these clubs will not join in the end.
If Man Utd play one second of a game in that league, I will no longer support them.
Great idea, I don’t see the problem
Hello there, I’m new to football and this seems like a great idea to me. Can someone pls explain what the hesitation is all about? Thanks!
Rip football Made by the poor, corrupted by the rich
This is an obvious reaction to state owned clubs spending billions “ psg owned by the government of Qatar and city owned by the government of Abu Dhabi .
Disgusting , I'll boycott it
It's literally turning into the NBA 🤧
Rip European soccer... Us Soccer only matters now... Money is not the answer for everything or this situation at all.
All of it is nonsense. Risk-free money supposedly intended for "top-notch" infrastructure and facilities, which they obviously already have.  As a Liverpool fan, I'm primarily disappointed with FSG. They seem to have no idea what YNWA means. If Bill Shankly were here...      “The socialism I believe in is everybody working for the same goal and everybody having a share in the rewards. That’s how I see football, that’s how I see life.”
This is an absolute *DISGRACE* to the sport of Football. These club owners are continuing to ruin my club, its legacy, and the sport of Football. Greedy scumbags!
This is gonna be brilliant
Football has always been my sports #1 for about 25 years, but because of these greedy a***oles now I prefer Ice hockey and other sports. This is what you get when you sell your clubs. Nobody should own the clubs but the fans. It's so sad that nobody stops these mf. They should be punished as hard as possible.
Ruining football culture making it more complex and greedy fuckers who can even sell their mother for money. Non-sense straight non-sense.
Nooooo!
Players of these clubs should go on strike
That Thumbnail is wrong cause Arsenal is not part of the Deadly 6
To get access seeing man united play in EPL live for 3-5 years back it's so god damn difficult at my country. Truly difference then 2010 era, big money they earn more difficulties for fans around the world to see their favourites club playing live, and here we go now be a witnesses about the rise of ESL, 3.5 bills is tremendous huge amount of money what the FC can get, i believe ESL will be out of reach for some red collars in many countries around the world, the owners maybe forgot that die hard fans doesn't care about whose club will they play against, die hard fans just wanna have easy access to see and support their beloved FC until they die.
Wow football fans are soooo dramatic “R.I.P Football” 😂😂😂😂
imagine the players have to play twice a week (always) now
We already know from the Incredibles: "And IF EVERYONE's SUPER,... NO ONE IS!"
Let's all stop watching
It's a disgrace a f😡cking disgrace
Football's coming home, never again.  Imagine fans will have to produce PCR tests and endure massively tight restrictions to see their teams worse then now. Only the super rich can attend now at a drop of a hat and multi-national corps lapping it up.  Watch as prices hit the roof.
football turning into dream league soccer
Another competition Spurs will NEVER win.
6000&1
3.5 billion to save Barcelona and real Madrid cause if the super League doesn't kick off they will go into liquidation simple equation
They are turning FOOTBALL into AMERICAN FOOTBALL!
18 April 2021: The end of football
If you have a Sky Sports subscription, let them know that you will be cancelling if they attempt to offer live coverage of this "competition".
Respond to their desire......what fan wants this?????
Football fans: (sees FIFA glitching) "Hey, what was that?"  FIFA: "I went forward in time, to view ultimate futures, to see all possible outcomes of the coming conflict." UCL: "How many did you see?" FIFA: 14,000,605 Football fans: "How many did we win?" FIFA: "..."
It will be like NBA??
:( sad
The World Cup in Qatar is an even bigger moral dilemma and all these pundits and players don’t talk about that. I’m against this super league too, but at least have the same energy for both.
only english teams that will stand a chance in this league are man city and liverpool, all the others are miles behind
All cry about it if your club wins it the best in the world 😜
Could they possibly be parting from the corruption in fifa and uefa....  FIFA has proven to be a massively corrupt organisation,  it may just be the beginning of a rescue plan for world football...
3 of those clubs hv never one the champions  league
made by the poor and stolen by the rich
Well I’m watching F1 better than this bollocks
its up to us the fans now whether their greed is justified or not.
I hate Americanize.
Leicester and Everton gonna boss the premier league nxt year.
It's SOOOOOO touching how concerned the "founding clubs" are about the fans' preferences. I weep for their thoughtfulness!
If you win the ESL cup what does it mean? It means it was your turn!!
All about the money. Imagine the premier league without Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham & Manchester United that would be very hard to pick a winner in the Premier league lol Leicester would be the best team in the Premier 😬😬
Now football shouldn't be called football, It should be called soccer What a disgrace 😡
I'm an Atalanta fan recruiting new fans here You are all welcomed
Its like Avengers vs Thanos
I am a man united fan and this is disgusting, the beautiful game we all grew up to and loved is broken. We are should boycut all this clubs and the super league, they are would have no foundation without the fans, and by boycut, this is the only way to get football back
better watch the farmers' league than this sh-
The funniest part is that all the owners got together and said “the fans are gonna go crazy for this one” aye
Why American like to ruin our leisure? Go do your MLS
Time for Tottenham to wipe their hideous history.
There are clubs in this ESL that never lifted a Champions League wtf is this?
I don't know why everyone is crying about this. I like the idea of Super League.
Reminds me of how the Premier league started in England... coincidence that Man U is apart of this...I think not
There’s no money in this without the fans, if we boycott it, it’ll collapse
Proud of Bayern and Dortmund
No thanks. I'm watching rugby from now on. Football is an utter joke and disgrace
What does this mean?
Footballers should go on strike or something cuz I don’t think any of the players want this either
Proud of the Bundesliga clubs👍🏻
As a United fan, I'm actually disgusted by this and SAF knew this would happen as soon as the Glazers took over.  They're just there to line their pockets. Everyone should cancel their sky subscription, don't buy the club merch and just boycott football until these fat cats see that WE THE FANS have the power and not them. They're disgusting weasels that need to be brought down to reality.
Best thing ever happened to football.... Now there's a reason to watch it again
Arsenal still think they’re in the top 6?!!! 😂😂😂
So Bayern and PSG will stay in CL to gain more trophies?
Boycot al these clubs
This is what happens when clubs sell their soul for foreign owners
I don't like UEFA or FIFA but It's preferable to a couple of European elite clubs going rogue to satisfy their greed for money. This is not about the fans, it's about getting the richest clubs in Europe even richer and free to run their schemes outside UEFA.
Financing by China. Pathetic
Come on the PL can't afford to kick out the teams, if only Liverpool and Man Utd left the PL, then the PL as an exportable product severely diminishes it's appeal not too mention domestic tv rights/money. They are the ones with the true worldwide audiences and let's be honest, they sell the PL aboard.
That explains why I like to support bundesliga teams it’s because the fact they are not money monsters and 51% owned may fans
american fan here  and this is such an stupid ass idea
Wouldn't surprise me if this league was ppv
Looks like I can no longer support Chelsea. Not and English team anymore. Millwall here I come.
Glazer is a fckin Mr Krabs
Back in the seventies Kerry Packer brought in World Series Cricket, cricket prospered by it. Could football also prosper or is this a death nail, Time will tell. Cheers
Football was good while it lasted but thanks to the likes of abramovic the games gone
Should only be for those clubs who win their domestic cup competition. Not just for big clubs who make already massive money
Just kick them out of their domestic league's and they'll turn course really quick.
What can we do as fans? For this, Unite. Those at Europe should not go to the matches, those who are outside europe can let the tv viewership decline drastically so that they do not have any fans for their greedy endeavour. We can do it, without fans they cannot really achieve anything. It boils down to how much we want it to not happen.
Moneey... Money.. money... Money... Money... Money 💰💰💰💰💰💰....
As football fans we need to boycot this, dont go to their matches dont even watch them.
I better support Leicester, united has let me down
I support it I think now super European league will be less chances to get in
What would happen if all the Football Associations, UEFA, and FIFA banned the clubs who participate in the Super League from all other competitions for as long as they participate in this nonsense league? . . .
SuperLeague makes total sense as most of fans would love to see more games between top clubs; they just need to add several spots for other clubs who may get there on annual basis. All national leagues are against it because it takes money from them! Thats where the greed is ;)
And whats going to be the best The neutral place of final will be in qatar china north Korea or another country that Puts the most money on the desk. Human rights will be equal for the finals states
Jesus Loves you all, he died for you all and wants the very best for you all. Have a blessed day 🙌🏾
Its a disgrace,
So what about the fans who actually pay for the teams .... that’s ok charge the poorest people who use football as a break from normal life  money grabbing bastards ..... hope it flop badly .....
The privatised downsizing of football. No doubt with the money very likely on offer in the "Super" League, the Premier League will become the new Championship. Whilst the owners sit atop and cream the profits from the creme de la crème.  It's funny they are going around announcing that they are doing what the billions of fans around the world want. Really you are just going to blatantly lie like that? A slap in the face.  If you are against this please don't support it with your money... it's a very selfish idea.
Disgraceful
RIP Manchester United 1878-2021
Indonesia
It's like celebrating your birthday every single day,there is nothing special about it,a terrible idea!
Remember that Nike advert
Why u all moaning..it's about money and how do you think big clubs pay their wages and make big money signings.they need this.and UEFA and FIFA knows that they not gonna get any profit from this that's why they are opposing it
the whole worlds gone mad!
This goes ahead... we riot.
This is going to safe football. Ask yourself: Do you want a System like Boxing or a System like MMA?
Let’s just all wait and see how it turns out. I’m sure everyone will still watch.
I hope ESL will End soon
See how these clubs do when no1 goes to the games and no1 tunes in to watch the games. Totally boycott everything to do with this. I hope all the players leave these clubs because this is a disgrace
Any player who plays in this leauge should be banned from international football
Bit hypocritical for Sky to be condemning a league created for the sole purposes of generating money. They singlehandedly ruined the Premier league and competitiveness with their money.
One word: Boycott
Liverpool did accept but they say he was the most hesitant
So is like dream league scorer?
Arsenal rn is not even eligible to qualify for Europa League! And they have signed for the Super League! What a joke XD
Glory hunter fans are the only ones who actually want this
They don’t care about European fans anymore . Chinese money rules everything.
The governing bodies has come down hard on these clubs immediately. If they bottle it now then football is dead.🛏🛏🛏💔💔💔
I think what’s happened is because of the pandemic the clubs have lost a lot of money so made there own league up to get loads of money really bad way to do that
What if the whole world boycotts this league
10 billion for the pyramid, yeah right! Lipstick on a pig time!
why
"Billions of fans. . ." as if, duh
The players must boycott
english premier league... french league one... italian serie a... spanish la liga... wheres the german bundesliga???
what is wrong with playing more games and earning more money?
In the wake of covid good luck setting up fixtures . Also this is a CLEANSE of football. The premier league can go back to being affordable with reasonably priced players
We all need to unfollow these clubs on all platforms and tell everyone we know to do the same. We have to do what we can to stop this.
Tottenham in a european super league 🤣🤣🤣. Leicester have more of a shout, at least they have won a major trophy in recent times. Greedy bunch of money grabbing c***s
In other worlds arsenal and  hot spurs will never win a trophy.  Key to life keep the bag coming"
As wrong as it is and believe me it is wrong, you will all still watch it if it goes ahead maybe 5-10% won’t but trust me yous will watch
If we are condemning this “greed” and this being “all about the money” can we also go into the trophy cases at Man City and Chelsea and condemn everything they have won in the past 20 years?
" yeah it is about the money " drops the phone   Drops my heart 💔
They true UEFA are thieves
Arsenal? 😂
Arsenal wasting their time in this new league their not good enough it’s all about money remember it’s the fans that pay a lot of their hard earned money to purchase match tickets and merchandise feel sorry for those great fans
Rip Football 1869 to 2021
Dinamo Zagreb 3 : 0 totteham 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolutely disgraceful!
I really don't get it....why is everyone upset at this again?
I'm hearing klopp is threating to quit and man City manager is also threating to quit. Jose walked not sacked..he refuses to do anything on super league and he will make a statement  to say football is for the fans.
Very sad 😥 for me
Money is killing football!! Sad but true.
Time to start watching Tennis
can someone explain to me what the hell is happening to football
Football needs a change and this pretty much summons it up! All the corruption scandals between UEFA and FIFA through out all these years manipulating the games, internal illegal bidding, money laundering, human rights abuse in Qatar and yet many european countries turn the other way, the Americans had to stepped in and confront the corruption FIFA has been involved when none had balls to do so yeah how pathetic.  Bad for football? Hipocrisy at its best. This the best thing can happen to the beautiful game! The current governing bodies are simply scared cause they can't have their ways anymore, this change may or may not be good at first but could open the door to a better way to regulate football for the better.  Many fans don't look beyond a seat at the stadiums or watching a game from home, they have no clue how corrupt these organizations are and have been doing through the years.  Is time for a change and this may be it!!!
Apperantly PSG has more soul than any of the english big 6
A Mickey Mouse Cup is given at the end of the ESL season.
And that would be Arsenal and Spurs' highest achievement in this competition.
Everyone who is against this and is willing to boycott  it as a fan like this
Lower tier champions League Scunthorpe United Vs VFL Bochum winner gets Europa League qualification.... I mean surely that's the no grainer money maker give the little guys a chance or kill the entire sport with the money and greed......
Any self respecting fan needs to not support this, you have to put football before your club right now
The day it starts is the day I will retire from supporting this sport and Manchester United.
This Manchester United supporter is OUT!  I will not support a club that participates in this so-called "Super League".  Manchester United was doomed the minute the Glazers arrived and it's been all downhill since then.  Ready to pick a new team in England and as for Europe, well Bayern Munich seems to be one of the only teams with honour and pride.
Absolutely disgraced and ashamed as a life long Chelsea fan with Abramovich joining this “super Ligue”! How much money these people need more to be happy?!!
Whats the criteria for these teams? Past success? then why isnt forest there? current success? why is spurs and arsenal there? 'big' club? why isnt everton or newcastle there? why these teams?
When this doesn't happen the six clubs should start the next season in the lowest English division with - 20 points
About time can't wait  👏
why are teams like bayern, psg, dortmund and maybe ajax not in this?
Suoerleague is great. Better quality football for the fans. Who really cares about the small clubs
The Premier league should give points abductions and hefty fines and put the clubs on place  this is outrageous they think they can do what they like
To be honest i love this league....said what you want but at the end of the day it's Awesome....
I am hopeful, in a way, that many people will stop watching football now; I don't regret quitting my football addiction two years ago, even though I had watched football my whole life. It's like gambling with your emotions: your happiness depends on something that is completely out of your control. Giving responsibility of your well-being to other people/parties is a bad strategy for a happy life as other people will prioritise their own interest over yours and it also means that they can easily manipulate you for you dependence on them ( as Sky have continually shown with their price hikes).
New favourite club:  Bayern Munich
Joe Glazer knows nothing about football. Knows all about (borrowing) money
It's not going to happen
Bloody hell; Jose’s left spurs !!!
Manchester United disgust me for this I hope Ole and the players stand against this
Why the hell did barca agree to this!!!!!😠😠😤😤
World's greatest clubs😂😂😂😂 spurs ,man city ,atletico and arsenal never won a champions League ever 😂😂😂😂 wat a joke ...
Just rumors,this will never happen.If it does, everyone will leave football and we will lose the excitement of a big derby such as Clasico.What's the point,anyways?
This will make football boring. every week we will have a big fixture? plus it will make the national leagues less interesting and the Champions league will become like the FA cup for the super league. It will just make things less interesting. Lol Plus the Glazers are the vice president, trust me this is not about football but about money. ManU fans know what I'm saying.
This feels like a new beginning
Im so happy my team of Napoli doesnt want to have anything to do with it
RIP FOOTBALL... All those memories 😠😠😠😠
FINALLY, people blind to the fact that fifa and uefa is corrupted as F. For YEARS has been raiding african children to make it in europe and disgarded if not making the cut leaving hopeless people on the streets of europe for many years and still counting. The monopoly scheme as been evident for a long time inside fifa and uefa and since the big clubs want their fair cut the whole world goes mad? You guys forget quickly, wonder why blatter and platini is under years of investigation and sentenced to jail? All brackets of fifa and uefa is corrupted as F
Last thing we need is Americans to tell us how football leagues should be run
YNWA my ass
Ucl is there to watch why super league im proud that any german team had not agreed
playing against top teams regularly takes the excitement out of it. We eagerly wait for those big games and now they're going to happen every week?
Football is not about 20 clubs... it is about the fans.  Forget these clubs. Many clubs have disappeared over the years through administration etc. And the game carries on.      Kick them out of all tournaments they are in now for bringing the game into disrepute.  Everyone boycot them and the TV games of this super league and let them fall apart and come begging to be let back in.
Change is good.
Shameful
time to support my local club
The one burning ember of hope in this Hindenburg level disaster is that the game can still be saved, assuming the supporters of these clubs can find a new club to support. Don't watch Arsenal, don't buy Barca jerseys, don't go to the San Siro to see AC Milan. It's not going to be easy, and I understand how fandom works so the idea of supporting a different club is blasphemous, but at the end of the day this is as much about the existence of fair competition and the sport itself as it is bleeding your team colors. If the fans stop supporting these clubs, then the clubs will panic when their bottom lines start dropping.
i hate how this guy is holding a phone like its pretty natural. world is dead
Disgusting  Bear in mind that those 4 billion after this they will cut down to maybe and if not less than 1 billion fans left
Football. Created by the poor, stolen by the rich.
The FA should kick these clubs out of the Premier League and block the English players playing for England. I’m a Liverpool fan and this not what the fans want. Never heard or seen fans calling for this! Plus when did Tottenham become a big club?!
dream league soccer just got real
After hearing of the Uefa Nations league, I expected more crap
All teams involved should get a point reductions in the Premier League after this doesn’t go ahead (hopefully..)
4 Billion fans around the world would love to see the big teams play each other every week. In management, its called resistance to change. Its very clear this change is threatening the relevance of the premier league and other bodies in football hence the objection.  I speak on behalf of many football fans around the world, Man utd vs RM, Barca Vs Chelsea, Juventus Vs Liverpool, Arsenal Vs AC Milan, these are mouth-watering fixtures any fan would love to see every week. If you are a fan of a small club, am sorry but go and compete with teams at your level. The European super league is for the big clubs and is a brilliant idea. I support.
forget what the clubs think about this because we know they are only bothered about the money. but what is the players take on this? do they like the idea of not playing for their national teams? I feel after two years of the super league all those clubs will collapse.
Only people that lose are FIFA, uefa. It's just an extra competition structured within the current set up.. What's the problem?
How is anyone surprised? The Premier League is the same idea exactly, and it succeeded financially spectacularly. This was and is inevitable at least to try it. I don't see how it will work without promotion and relegation though, the Americans want the same model used by their sports businesses, and I don't think fans will accept that here in Europe. I hope not.
The END OF FOOTBALL
Wait whys Tottenham joining?
its an absolute disgrace....but I dont see it happening...it wont materialise (he says hopefully knowing that there's a big chance it will because money is king)...then these teams should be severely punished for this violation
This is awful but SKY is a bit hypocritical to condemn the next step on the journey that they started.
Don't watch it and it will be a massive failure. It is about time the people stood together and fought the greedy elite scum that try and control every aspect of our lives.
Super league is gonna ruin football
boycott the games. thats the only way this super league fails
Messi vs Ronaldo weekly , real Madrid vs Barcelona weekly
I doubt fans will be willing to subscribe to another expensive subscription to watch this farce of a league...biggest boycott ever
There is a perfect video about the European Super League
Arsenal and spurs being classed as top 6 pathetic
If you hate your owners and need new owners to hate, come join Birmingham City 💪
As an Arsenal fan it’s embarrassing to hear that this is what the club has come to. We can’t even beat Fulham yet alone finish top 6. Just pure stupidity
Kick the big 6 out of the prem, see how much money that makes them
Anything that sticks it to FIFA is welcomed for me. I hope this super league reach out and invite some of the asia-based and south america-based clubs. That way, it can gain relevance.
These newsreaders calling this ridiculous but I bet Sky Sports will be the first to bid for TV rights
English people be like leaving the EU but building a European Super League
this the issue worth protesting for
where is the 3.5 / 10 billion coming from?
Has anyone consulted the players or managers regarding these changes?! I can't imagine so.
What is wrong with everybody here so negative!! It’s a new “midweek” competition it’s just more football and more opportunities to win an extra trophy! It’s also more money and prestige for our clubs! Why all the distaste I don’t get it honestly. I love football and the more competitions and games I can watch the better
It really pains me to say this, but I will probably disown Liverpool if things don’t get sorted, will give my support to a club that cares about Football. Genuinely heartbroken. Huge respect for Bayern, Dortmund and PSG for rejecting this!!
Like it or not the SUPER LEAGUE is the future. Change is here
This is ridiculous! Even more so is that there’s 12 teams confirmed and 6 are from England? Tottenham and arsenal are not elite clubs, rip football
Bayern Munich is very quiet
3 and a half Billion per club , so not about the money then 🤣
love to see super league i dont care fux u
I am utterly shocked by Liverpool here. John Henry needs to listen to the fans
Enough is enough      I am in support of the formation of this super League 😂
Football is now just a billionaires playground and the players and virtually all mercenaries.  The soul and integrity of the sport is long gone.  If this goes through I’m done.  Will save me a fortune in monthly subscriptions.  Sky BT Sports etc etc.  Also Sky and BT sport are as much to blame.
oh my god
The worst day in Football history
I guess arteta wasn’t kidding when he said he isn’t planning for another season without European football lmao
To be fair they can't just keep doing what they were doing previously no fans are able to show up so.whats the point 😱 they may aswell just have the best clubs play each other
Watch this come in Sky Sports Retro in 10 years
sounds good to me 6 teams out of England means bring the old firm into the English prem let them have their Superleague the rest of the world won't watch it
All the people who say "No to Super League" are dumb as a bucket of shrimps
Boycott it.
Super league is gonna bang, cant wait for that
RIP Football
No one moan when ruby did it why are you all bitching because football are doing.
Let’s invite villa, Nottingham forest an Ipswich all substantially bigger then spurs,city and arsenal on a European level
Honestly I hate this idea,the excitement of big European teams facing off in the champions league is amazing but if they playing each other every month the magic will be lost,another thing all these top clubs especially in England complain about game congestion yet they want to add another league into the already crowded space,I can see these English teams opting out or force losing in the league cup as its not prestigious or financially beneficial to them.
I’m not going to watch this Super League. It’s a cash grab, and a way to keep the underdogs down. It’s that simple.
Wake up call for corrupt UEFA ,The guaranteed money on offer for the big 6 is triple the money you get for winning the champions league, that's very interesting UEFA 👍
the players havent signed a contract to play in the Super League.  So they could critize it and protest against it
The begginig of the downfall of football
Best news ever. This is the future SUPER LEAGUE
Farmers league is real
Not interested. I’m done. Goodbye beautiful game 😔
Now what's the point who wins this year's UCL,la liga,epl. I will watch local football teams from now.
If they want more action in UCL just make another group like europa league instead of top 4 teams make it top 5 like it’s not that hard Make a round of 32  We love seeing teams like lecister work hard and get into champions league  West Ham looking like they might be in the UCL
So they want to play I'm league and champions league and have a European super league tournament to themselves,   they will dominate domestic football even more as how will anyone else challenge them domestically when they get all this money
Boycott + hate! I hope they lose money!
Hold on  Aston Villa have a champions league Hamburger have a champions league  Nottinginham forest have 2  Ajax have 4  PsV have 1 Marseille have 1 Not Tottenham not arsenal not athletico Madrid  Not psg not Man City  Have it so how are they bigger?  Wtf have Spurs done in the last 50 years  What a league cup? 🧐 wtf is that  Inter Milan won it in 2010 the last time before that was in 1965  Acc Milan last one it in 2003 they haven’t even been in the UcL for like 10 years  Man Utd didn’t even go through the group stages of the UCL  Man City was just started to be useful in 2008  It’s a complete disgrace  Leciester won the league in 2016 since then they have been a bigger club than Arsenal in terms of “BIG 6”  It’s absurd
Just stop this mad respect for PSG and Bayern Munich for saying no
Wait idk what's the big deal? Why is everyone reacting so badly? I'm genuinely asking? What's the problem with this
Soon they will start drafting the players across teams just like they do in American football
From the 4 billion fans.... Reality is most (80%) support these clubs
Okay everyone is saying this is "bad" "disgusting" etc.  But WHY?
Pure greed,ban them from domestic and all uefa competitions.The new champions league format was not suiting them so start their own.
Kick them out there domestic league and cups
Super league is rubbish. I am only going to watch EUFA CL. I believe u earn the right by performances not money.
Btw Perez the Real Madrid president has been working on this since 2009...
6 of the 12 are English clubs, 3 are Spanish, how is it European
Won't happen, let's unite ourselves with hating scoucers
it should be the fans decision, get fans to vote and decide
I'm a huge Chelsea fan and I hope we will win this season in Champions League.
Exclude the clubs and players from any and all domestic, FIFA and UEFA competitions and flood them with lawsuits. Plus the supporters should boycott any and all games (when matches can be attended once again).
Absolute disgrace
BREAKING NEWS - BLAME MAN CITY
It feels like we're still in 2020
How on earth have Spurs got a invite?
Top teams vs. Top teams, this is exactly what we want to see. You fools talking about you don't want that. Every event is amazing when it's the best v the best or creme de la creme. Let's go !!!
The end is near guys repent your sins and trust in Christ
This is brilliant news, happy Liverpool fan here, come on the reds let's win this 👌😎
What Perez is saying about giving the fans what they (we) want is total rubbish. All they want is more power and money, that's the only thing they think about.  Maybe I should just stop following football as it is.
Let's go Super League!
the only global sport in the world............great English skills
Super League go to hell!
I really hope no fans go to stadiums to watch this rubbish... Football is now just about money
We cannot let this happen
If this does go ahead I hope the rest of PL clubs refuse to play any team involved
I'm more shocked that Arsenal have been invited to join, they're literally an upper mid table team these days 😂
Man United fans seeding at this... Joel Glazer Vice Chairman of the Super League 🧐🧐🧐
Let’s go support your local clubs now. Let’s start again.
Football is dying
What's Sky going to now? Support it? Probably ... hypocrites
Greed
The final of the European super league with be played in Saudi Arabia on sky sports box office €19.99 at 4am.
Ashamed to be an Atleti fan
How is this the players fault tho
The big six will surely not be banned from the Premier League? The club's wouldn't go ahead with it
Great news
350 million euros
At least these teams have gotten used to playing in empty stadiums already. Do they think any of us want to see a repetitive list of fixtures every year with no need for qualification and no risk of relegation? I think a lot of fans, including me, will be looking for new clubs.
it will fall flat on its face basically if you have your favourite food or drink everyday it then becomes boring and not an exciting treat! same principle cant they see the whole excitement of qualifying for the champions league is the whole point and if your in it every year that takes away the anticipation especially for smaller clubs. disgusting simple and needs immediate action i.e take them out of next seasons fixtures
The champions league as its name states is not a league. The format of the ulc should change to an actual league. The idea that it’s closed and for only the founding clubs does worry me as it means other teams around the world lose out on being as big of a club as these 12 founding clubs. I personally feel they need to work with uefa and fifa on this. The champions league systems in my opinion has been stale for along time and needs updating. I just feel the champions league needs to change to an actual league where it’s mid week football and then home league games on the weekend like it is now. I do feel a bit worried that 6 of the 12 teams So far are from the PL and it’s a closed league there needs to still be some sort of entrance to this European super league that’s why I think the ulc needs to just join this idea and there still be a way for clubs to join this new league from some sort of promotion.
Yeah so excited ❤️
How have our English clubs said yes when PSG SAY NO TO IT WTF HAVE WE BECOME
All you big 6 fans that are looking for a new team to support; Norwich is an amazing family club, run properly by lovely owners and could really do with the extra income for our season in the Prem next year :))
AM NOT REALLY SUPRISED THAT IT'S THE GLAZERS IN THE LEADING ROLE OF THIS DISGUSTING THING....THIS IS FOOTBALL NOT NBA😤😡
The project is debt financed by JP Morgan. That means that these clubs need to pay back that 3.5 billion investment. If you’re a fan of one of these clubs you need to just take a break from it for a least a year so that they take a hit economically. It’s the only thing that can stop this
As a fan I am gutted. But what about the players. Kane could of easily smashed the premier league record
I don’t even watch English league games that’s corrupt enough
Yeah this is about money, a lot of it.  He hit the nail on the head perfectly
Bring back the European cup. Only champions allowed to compete.
FSG OUT
They sold their club to the Devil
These superclubs want to end UEFA's monopoly over elite football ie champions league. They want more money out of UCl....They DONT want to give up their domestic leagues for sure...Could happen that these clubs break away from competing in UCL.... but still compete in Premier league, La Liga, Seria A. Only Bayern Munich's decision to stay out of super league is based ethics and morals. PSG has close ties with UEFA...so they dont want to join this....SImple
I will not be watching that
Chelsea and Spurs aren't all time top six. Everton and Aston Villa are.
Sell outs
people dont like change...
Super league begins...  Real Madrid 8 Arsenal 2  AFTV - It's time to go!!
Would love to hear a single non Brit sound off on this because for Spanish, German, French and Italian large clubs (and their fans)  this all makes total sense, its just the British and the Prem that complicate the issue
this will destroy football as we know it, don't think that this should proceed, something or someone needs to stop this promptly.
As a Man United fan I am ashamed of my club. Owners care more about money than fans who have supported this club all thse years  If this is the future of football then I’d rather stop watching
Greedy wankers , they are doing this right now because the fans have no voice in the stadiums , we have to do something 🟢🟡
Remember when Gary Neville said they will back out once they see the backlash 🤣
This is better then the new CL. Its not to replace the National leagues.
Everyone that supports these teams should change to the EFL league as they deserve more fans , im choosing Nottingham forest,  come on you reds
Arsenal thought they could sneak in this like no one would notice they are flimsier than Prince Andrew's Alibi
Sham Sandwich, stick it
Boycott this stupid "league", boycott every match and every team participating in it. Let it die.
I want to know know the players opinions are, they should be coming straight out and telling us, the fans what they think of this. Absolutely disgusting, this isn't a competition at all. The joy of leagues such as the PL is that even 'small' teams can beat the so called 'big teams', which brings so much joy to the fans and the rivalry amongst  Many teams. The players and managers need to come out and have their say and not be silenced by the people who employ them. I can imagine they have had fincial threats and more thrown towards them if they speak out about the club, absolute joke!
No problem if six leave  then upgrade via the league's tables remove them from all British sport and ignore all climbs from a British football and ban the club's from dealing with other clubs from the country and across the world the only way to deal with this is mass protests at all of the six stadiums by there own fans and true supporters cancel there season tickets and let them remain with empty stadiums across the world  life is more important than death  as a west ham  supporter this will make us top London club every year LOL
This is just about money by club owners
ITS TIME TO SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL! THAT'S WHERE REAL FOOTBALL IS.
Ban the clubs and players from current domestic leagues, uafa and national competitions.
Leicester city and West ham ahead of Liverpool, chelsea, tottenham and arsenal this season, rediculous that the competition has been taken away from the game.
This is absolutely nonsense, who needs super league?
Fans may cry foul but will they vote with their feet?   When FIFA demonstrate their corruption by awarding a world cup to Qatar, a country with a climate that is totally unsuitable, that has no football heritage, no stadiums, no substantial fan base, no grass roots and laws that would make many fans unwelcome, will fans stay away, or go anyway?  oligarchs
I’ve been an Arsenal fan since back in the Highbury days and as much as I wanted the club to win the Europa League, I want them to get kicked out, and the top 10 of the prem? Forget that! Anything that can make Kroenke regret his greedy decisions is a good idea, being from West Yorkshire, perhaps I should have always supported Leeds and perhaps from now on, I will
Same thing happened with the premier league when it was created, so chill everyone and enjoy the superleague it will not destroy football. And UEFA and FIFA is now using all their muscle to try and stop it when we all know how corrupt they are and all they care about here is the money they stand to lose if super league happens. They care very little about football they are worrying about their peace of the cake
SAD DAY 😩
When i first heard about this i thought it was just the media creating a story. They talked about this many times in the past, but it seems serious this time. Obviously driven by the enormous drop in revenue from covid, but who is financing this? where is the financial backing coming from? and and how is this financial model sustainable without additional interest in this super league.
I'm a city supporter, I will never go to or even watch these matches
Honestly I would say replace the cl with super league
Football has completely sold out. Globalism has won.
Relegate these clubs,relegate them ,all points off everything IDC that I support one of them because its a fecin disgrace
This is absolutely ridiculous, we can’t let them ruin our league and the whole English Game..  I am a dedicated United supporter and I am sickened that my club is trying to do this and I hope we get  reprimanded for it
Next thing will be Celtic and Rangers leaving Scottish football for a new league competing against the Super League that may include the likes of Ajax, Benfica, Porto, Sporting Lisbon, Anderlecht, Red Bull Salzburg and Olympicios
Bit rich from sky who charges ppv for games in a pandemic. That is greed
Oh dear, I for one will not support this, and spurs I will not follow you anymore😡😡😡😡
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Hopefully as a bonus EA Sports gets forced to make a better football game or go out of business.   People are complaining because they fear change. If it's one thing this pandemic should teach, EMBRACE CHANGE and watch things get better that could've always been better.  I don't get people saying these owners/clubs are greedy. Have they considered the profit share of the current governing and regulatory bodies of football in current competitions???
😞
Superb news. Hope they use VAR. This bring more money for them to spend big money on expensive transfer markets. I am done watching England vs Andorra.
Who gonna win this leagur🤣🤣
We as fans need to boycott the whole games.
Even if these bastards reverse their decision we should all abandon the big teams now. They stand for themselves and no one else, as they’ve shown. Bin the lot.
Finally we will stop seeing mediocre teams that always lose in the first round. There will also be a guarantee of economic solidarity with them. Stop being scared. Long live 🙌 the SUPERLIGA 🇪🇸
Football died years ago so this does not surprise me. What makes me laugh how did Spurs get into this ? What have they won lmao
Money has killed the beautiful game of football ⚽️
My great and most successful club in the world Rangers will replace one of these schiesters in the Premier league then?  #55 titles 😁🇬🇧🇬🇧
So, what happens if one is relegated ?😅
So after all of us fans have had to sit and watch our teams play the beautiful game through a TV screen for for over a year when we just wanted to be there on a match day watching a pl, fa cup, European game. We’ve missed it and now when we’re finally allowed back in stadiums we got this to look forward too?? Complete uncertainty? Repercussions? Those special European nights becoming stale? People losing their passion for the game? It is truly saddening to think that after being starved of it for so long the whole sport as we knew it might never be the same.
Money and superstardom has already ruined football. I don't know why everyone is complaining now. Football hasn't been a true working man's sport for a long time.
Only the best runs clubs refuse to participate to that circus Bayern , BVB, Paris, Olympic Lyonnias, Marseille, Leverkusen, RB Leipzig
I dont understand y are people so  mad about teams joining the Super League.  I was waiting for something like this for a very long time I pray it happens 🙏
It’s the asernal taking part for me😭🤣🤣🤣
As a Chelsea fan, relegate us all. Absolutely disgraceful
The "Kerry packer" cricket scenario now come to football.
How embarrassing haha
Ashamed of my club chelsea. Disgusting, all clubs should be punished wherever possible should this go ahead fully
If you fans of big clubs are really that unhappy starry following you r local team instead as majority of you have closer league teams/non league teams who will value your support unlike these unruly giants
Get the foreign owners out! Premier league needs a german model were 51% of the club is owned by the fans.
August 2021, Sky Sports launches new channel, Sky sports Super League.....for only an extra £9000 a month
If these so called big six clubs think "it all will be ok once the dust settles" they've got another thing coming. They're actually telling their own supporters to 🖕🏻
Glazer has said ‘We played Leipzig, Istanbul and PSG twice, this isn’t enough for a club our size, we want to be playing Juventus, Madrid, European giants every season’  Well maybe if you qualified you'd be playing them you fool. Can't beat those teams that he is trying to belittle. Vile minded people ruining the biggest sport on earth.
Exclusivity in football. This is bad. Football should be inclusive. Where is the underdog story we love will be gone.
Ban them all from English football. Be strong with these clubs. Out of everything.
Its all about the money sky sports will want it aswell to get more money for each big game they play not surprised.
Gary Neville says it's a disgrace it's all about greed but the end of the day sky started all of this with the premier league back in 1992 so he is right it's all about money sky Have ripped the general public off for years and he is working for an organisation saying that that started it all
they should be banned from the domestic league, and when the super league collapses and they want to ccome back, they should have to start from the bottom at at least league 2 if not lower.
Arsenal will be relegated in a league that u can't be relegated from 😂 this is crazy
Billionaires are destroying everything in the world piece by piece.
He says listening to there desires but yet no one wants it to happen dont get that lol stupid idiots 100 years of sports what nonsense.
Greedy people who don’t care about supporters
The greed that these club owners posess is unreal.
the end of football
The Super League is a giant middle finger to the Champions League.  It's stupid man. If UEFA and FIFA reject their proposal and the clubs still go with it, they are gonna lose money and players in the long run, and ultimately will tarnish their popularity and brand moving forward.  This move could destroy club football as we know it.
I can't wait it will be great
I dont care i just want to watch my team play, I didnt start supporting my team because of FIFA or UEFA or FA
Please please please 🙏 whatever happend just dont change the UEFA anthem😭 its our life
Kick them all out premier league could be anyone's next year that's more exciting then that superleague bollox where arsenal and spurs will be fighting for who doesn't finish bottom
Absolute power absolutely corrupts 🤷‍♂️
Greed has and always will, kill everything it touches.
Not about the fans it's all about the profit
It's crazy that millions of people in this country cannot see the pattern. Corona virus kicks in, no fans at the game, corporations carry on as normal, making more money. No fans at the game. Big corporations calling the shots whilst the majority, the millions of people locked down divided as ever!
Boycott
Why are Tottenham there? 😂😂😂
Let’s face it most working class have been robbed of their game for years now. High ticket prices and high television subscription have been a joke. I know loads of people who haven’t watched champions league since it moved away from terrestrial television simply because they can’t afford it. The game is geared for the middle and upper classes of society and this is another kick in the face for the average person.
Realistically if we boycott it, they wouldn’t get enough money to run. The problem is there’s gonna be people who don’t understand and will still watch.
When I was 6, I wanted this to happen. Back then, if it had, like the proposals I remember, it might have been for the sport and not the money. Now however, it is absolutely about the money and as an Arsenal fan, I'm pretty much ready to walk away from the club's fanbase forever because they are greedy cunts. Heavily considering becoming a Millwall fan.
They are trying to emulate the American model of competition. MLB NFL NBA huge billionaire teams with no consequences if they have a bad seasons and keep all their money.
Lmao big club, big club, big club and...Tottenham 😂
arsenal gonna be small team in this league🤣
Prince Philip died so he wouldn't have to see this.
They haven't thought it through. There will be no away fans. Who will travel abroad to watch a 'league' game.
it’s funny bcos this is the same way the Premier league started, just on a european scale. amazon or bt will probs take the deal. funny how the premier league forgets that part
If my team Leicester, joined this break a way, I would disown them totally. Fortunately, I don't think they will be approached.
I’m a West Ham fan now. Hail Lord Lingardhino
Been a arsenal fan my whole life never felt so ashamed shirts going in the bin will never step foot in the Emirates again
350 million for each club? What's the point when the football fans will stop watching?
Me a liga Mx fan : 👁👄👁
'Mid week' so those teams won't be i Champions or Europa leagues anymore? What a clusterf**k.
Nightmare  Darkest moment
If it happens kick all the teams out The football leagues, FA Cup, Carabao Cup. All players affiliated to any of the clubs not allowed to represent their country. Believe you me they'll come crawling back with their solid gold begging bowls!!!
They're ruining it...they're turning it into the NFL 🤦‍♂️
Time to support Valencia
Football being a non contact sport now and var have already ruined the game, but this is the final straw bye bye 👋
Now lets see how the leagues react. They dont have the bottle to deduct points or drop the teams from their leagues. If they dont do it now then these ESL clubs have won
Yes European Super league is like ultimate Team in Fifa be happy. If u fans don't like this stop playing FIFA
Players are ready tired with the games they already have ...wtf
I actually feel like there’s indirectly a major positive behind this. If the clubs are kicked out of their respective leagues it will act as a kind of ‘refresh’ to the English Pyramid which would lead to a more unpredictable Premier League and greater support down the lower leagues. It will give the FA an opportunity to sort out the English game that’s been ruined by money
Everyone who is still a fan of these clubs should be ashamed of themself.
Come watch cricket
Super league= Corona virus in football
I really don't know why people are surprised, these clubs have been acting with impunity for years. How can these clubs and their players be expected to act with integrity and by the fans interest when some of these players earn nearly 600,000 a week? And lower league clubs going out of business? The FA/PL have only themselves to blame for this, they should have put a stop to this year's ago by capping wages and investment in these clubs, and by making it a fairer league for all clubs.
If spurs are in there , why not Nottingham forest and Blackburn? What a joke lol
This is the worst year then 2020
All the greedy clubs joined, very sad considering they are always complaining they play too many games in a normal season.
Why are arsenal tottenham and liverpool in there they ain't even in the top 4 at the moment arsenal and tottenham would be an embarrassment in that league the way they are playing and the position they are in in the league at the moment
Tottenham ? In a super league ? Why ?
I guess it's better than the corrupt organisations running football at the moment, everything else about it i hate
I will walk alone, Devils destroyed football, I'm beaten to blue, I dont feel like a citizen more like a powerless farmer, those teams were never with us, they're not more than a club, they're less then a club, the Lilywhites have withered, its @/nevermilan now, forget 'la beneamata' they're never beloved, la colchoneros should sleep on the ground from now on and last but not least, The royal became the oil. The rich only want to get richer..  They destroyed so many traditions because of money. Tbf all those owners should immediately give up their positions, and i'm not only talking about them losing their jobs, more so them losing their lives. Fcking greedy old moneychasing egotypical pieces of utter shite.
Unfollow that 12 clubs
Disgraceful and pure greed. Fans should protest this move
UCL winner gets €82.4m EPL winner gets €150m  Total= €232.4m  You participate in the European Super League and get €350m,   The winner gets €500m  Now I see why clubs wanted to join 🥴
Everyone like this! if you think the European Super League is going to be the death of football ⚽️💰😬
So Man City or Chelsea  will be the last ever champions league winner
Arsenal are poooor loool
This is a total disgrace but sky helped start all this,, football is no longer for the working class and that's cos of sky money then greed feeds greed and now we have this. Relegate the 6 teams now ban them from all other competitions one of these teams is mine but I will go and support my local team bye bye football and thanks sky......
If real Madrid barca man utd and arsenal go shame on them they have so much history
I’m a Spurs fan and will always be a Spurs fan but this super league will kill the English game. Even though the teams will still play in the premier league I can’t see it being competitive
So 11 clubs and Tottenham
F you Man United. I'm done. I wont be watching this travesty of an event. Boycott and dont give them your money!
I just love the concept of this new competition. Don't know whether this is gonna get materialized or not, but it'll be exciting to see an entire competition only with big teams. Football needs something new like this and those who're blaming these club owners for their lust for more money, they should also remember that UEFA is changing the format of UCL and other European competitions for money only so that they can have more viewings and more sponsors. There's nothing wrong in earning more money if you can and especially as governments are opposing it, there must be something good about it. Although I'm expecting some rough replies in my comment section, but I just love this new concept anyway ✌️!
Im going to to support Norwich and fulham full time
it’s a breakaway from european football not domestic football. it’s now changing football because of eufa’s sanctions. chill out
Stop crying, it was obvious decision by big clubs. Just wait super league this should be really interesting competition
Seems the teams have had enough of the red tape, low share of prize money and shady management by the likes of the FIFA....
Arsenal is not one of the 12 leading clubs
I'm appalled..deduct 15 points per season from each club. Let's see how long they  remain  'top 6'.
Surely teams won’t be able to stay in their domestic leagues as there are already too many games to keep up with!
It’ll happen, sky runs football with their money all over the world, people can’t travel so they’ll watch on sky which means more money for then
How can you support this, look at Porto beating Juventus to face us in the quarter finals, I was on the edge of my seat watching that, taking that away from us is disgusting!!! So ashamed in football right now
Premier League is greed. What was wrong with the 1st Division on the free-to-air BBC or ITV?
They gonna get banned from everything and no one will watch they league its their loss cause they gonna be sad haha
4 billion fans, only 12 teams to watch, what a great idea, extrodinary.
💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
I remember creating a super leage on pro evolution soccer and had real madrid finishing 18th that would b the reality of the super league some teams may never come close to wining it
i say all 6 english clubs fans should protest and boycott buying ticket that will hurt the owner's pocket
UEFA can’t ban these clubs from CL and EL  because without these clubs playing those competitions nobody will watch it.
i just hope nobody watches this🙏
I didn’t get it why it is badd?!!
People saying they’re gonna boycott is hilarious 😂 it’s not for you anyway it’s for rich tourists, also sky was never against the premier league being taken over by rich Arab billionaires for past several years, they’re only upset now because they know they won’t be able to get the tv rights, bye bye sky ! At least you have rugby super league 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The audacity of arsenal and Tottenham to believe they belong in that league
Good bye football I will not be watching it anymore. I have had enough of all these greedy people that thinks they know football. Good bye football I have great memories of u
Two words...... Greedy bastards!!
Won't work, no one will watch the games as protest= no money, therefore superleague will fall apart
WHAT IS SUPER LEAGUE?
Hahaha  this is great, Europeans can barely afford the players wages and ticket fees, they’ve been trying to get Chinese tourists in the gates for years, this way they can increase the prices as well as get rid of loud local European fans
2020 was way better
As an American that only watches European football when no American sports are on at 7 in the morning on a weekend. Why is this a bad thing? It just sounds like an independent champions league.
Tbf if the super league plays once every 2 weeks an teams still play in there natural league an super league replaces the champions league an the top six from pl changes an other teams have a chance to compete it could have potential as long as it comes to a logical agreement id like to play a team like psg or real Madrid more than once it be fun the fans can save up to book a holiday for a week go abroad but during that time get pissed in the pub while your team batters real Madrid get new players new money all for getting rid of the champions league it sounds like uefa dont want this to happen but a whole season to predict the best team in the world instead of a little tournament an it doesn't affect anything else beside money wise in their natural league witch tbh man city do every few years isnt so bad
I found out about super league on wikipedia about a month ago. I was like: Okay, probably a new uefa competition like nations league. Nothing special. I didn't know it would probably cause the end of this sport.
Well I guess Son and kane will stay at spurs now
In a way I kinda don't agree with the players being banned from their national teams. They didn't get a say in the matter, and even if they don't want to be a part of the ESL, they signed a contract for their club, so unless they're sold to another club or they decide to leave, they don't have a choice but to play in the league.
West Ham till I die....
As a Man U fan I’m ashamed they’re not making a stand against this
My kids are going to grow up not knowing the real passion and grind of football
Ngl I hope all the leaders get assassinated
Who is paying for this?
Brian swanson's voice tho
Letsgo nottingham forest!
The premier league is a massive part of my life and has been for over 20 years...... this makes me very sad
All the owners of the clubs involved need to f**K off. All of the clubs should be ashamed of themselves. They are wiping their ass's with everyones history after taking a money loaded dump all over it!!!
R.I.P to the game it's a sad day & I'm absolutely Disgusted by my club Man Utd for signing up to it
This thing is going to destroy football
I’m done.... Liverpool can get fucked 🖕
Boycott
Only yesterday morning, I was saying how my love for my club (Chelsea) is at its highest it’s ever been. What a let down to hear this news. It’s up to the players to refuse to play, and the tv stations to refuse to buy the rights to show any matches
If you have Christmas every month, will it still be so special?
All those black live matter signs an they never really cared about anything but the money
*UEFA , FIFA , Premier League and La Liga aren't fighting for the fans . They are just fighting because they would loose money from this 💯*
They only agreed a champions league deal recently
How is thai any different than the leagues we have ? UEFA and Fifa are worse than this. If you boycott this you have to boycott the CL, Premier league and all UEFA and fifa events or Zoe are a hypocrite
Who’s buying a championship season ticket with me next season then lol
Once the Super League agree to pay UEFA, FIFA , Premier League and La Liga a certain percentage of the money they earn you'll see that they would stop complaining 💯
The glazers took my club. Now they took the sport. They are the devil.
F*CK OF THATS NOT FOOTBALL ANYMORE
lol, killing off an already dead sport
What fcky is this
They’re only upset because they will lose money
My Motto now Go West Ham Go Ps: i was Liverpool Fan
It’s just disgraceful
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
@Mr DT
As fans we can stop this. Don't pay for it, don't watch it, protest it, boycott it. Do whatever it takes imo. Football belongs to us, don't let them take it away.
@AFTV
Absolute disgrace
@Arsenal
Goodbye to Chelsea UCL dreams
@Sky Sports News ESL " Its Time TO GO " !!!!
Those who have made these decisions feel we will all still continue to watch despite what happens. We will still buy season tickets, merchandise etc. We need to make a stand. If you support one of the 12 clubs, boycott the games. Don't watch, unfollow the club pages and sponsors however leave players and managers out of it. I doubt they had a say! We need to unite 🙏
BREAKING NEWS! Jurgen klopp has gone on strike!
As an Arsenal fan, how do we expect to compete in a super league when we cant even beat bloody Fulham at home????
they are willing to give up their own national leagues just to get those damn millions ... disgrace!
Seems like all channels and pundits says same NARRATIVE . Can someone show opposite thoughts and justifications , i know media became a junk in the last 20 years , but you can't be on one side only, you need to invite people from other camp. I am against this Supe League from the first glance, but i remember that Premier League was created similar way, not mentioning Altenrative Current was also blamed by everyone.
NO TO THE SUPER LEAGUE
Disgrace
Quality football and I don’t have to watch Burnley vs Sheffield? Where do I sign up?
6:32 "yeah this is about money " 😂😂😂😂
I know Arsenal are run by leeches in the Kroenke's who don't value the history of our club. I'll always love Arsenal but I will not be watching supporting, buying shirts or following any Arsenal activity if they go through with this super league. I will revoke my fan card definitely and just stop watching football entirely. I'll stick to Basketball and mma.
hail european cowards league
He said he will respond to our desires but nobody wants the super league 🥴🥴
Super exciting count me in. Doubt it will happen. Premier league needs those clubs to maintain the cash flow so unlikely they will be kicked out.
There can't be a top European league without Bayern Munich.
Don’t go support it. Fans are the blood life of any football club and without fans your nothing. When gates back open do bother going to games unless it’s EFL.  I’m so glad I support my home town Rochdale AFC and not a premier league team. They are ruining football it’s it’s sad to see.
I love it. This will make the league more fair since  all the league has been a no fair league in the first place. It’s always the team with the most money that never gets relegated anyways. If there was a salary cap then I’d believe all the hate that comes from it but since there’s no salary cap then I say go with the super league. It’s only fair. I always see the same teams with money in the top 10 over and over. I don’t blame super league. I blame all the leagues or fifa for not having salary cap. We always see all the attractive players in one team. Where’s the competition in that? If there was a salary cap then we’d see the likes of Mbappe to West Brom or some club and make that club more attractive to watch mostly because of him. Vote for Salary Cap. It will do good for all the leagues and clubs since it will have a trickle down effect. Which would make all team attractive to watch instead of the same big teams over and over.
Agree with all the comments. This is the death of many teams not just in the lower leagues but also the premiership. What the so called top six have done is stab everyone in the back then kicked them in the face when they, we, are at our lowest. The premier league and other bodies need to stand up for the fans and those teams who stand with their fans. Let them go on the understanding they can’t play in their own league or cup competitions. If they change their minds they still need to be fined and deducted points for even threatening to do this. This is the time we need to stand tall and stand up to these bullies of the football world. Why should they dictate who is allowed what and who is the top six? They need punishments done now. Only then will the fans across the uk will feel we are in this together against such greed.
I'm just so disappointed....
world wide player wage cap! world wide cap on fee's to enter the ground....end tv commercial deals that exclude youths from under privileged families. They are the future of the game after all.    champions league football should be only the champions, earn the right to play in it. make the uefa cup the best of the rest league.... letting the winner into the champions cup the year after. These greedy corporate scum bags need removing from our game...  fifa included, there management of the beautiful game has taken us here.... enough already!!!
Rubbish
Greed greed and more greed. As an Arsenal fan I’m livid 😡😡😡
Show me one Fan who supports this league... you will not find anyone
Kick them out of the traditional system,let them go play their private league
I feel like thats a plot of a sports movie....how bizarre
I'm excited by this, I wish EPL will be scrapped as well due to poor officiating
The end
boys i’m going to newcastle who’s coming with.
The “super league” will most likely cut a share of the money for the domestic leagues and they’ll be allowed to do whatever.
sky or bt surely wont go near this given the feedback of fans
Im predicting that this is just going to be used as some heavy handed bargaining tactics for the biggest teams and how tv rights work.
Footballers in this group of 6 will relish the idea making them million pound a week players However football in England needs to return to it’s grassroots with the working class supporters and realistic wage structures As a Sheffield United supporter I’m all for it before anyone comments I’m still in mourning
It`s a disgrace, It`s a F****** Disgrace
Time has come to deduct points off these clubs. Big heavy fines. Strip all cups off these teams. We'll done to the German and French teams.
Basically B-Tec champions league.Disgraceful
Football super money league- STOP!!
I still hope that the backlash from this will make a few clubs reconsider and change their minds...This CANNOT happen surely? Bayern, Dortmund and PSG should be applauded for their actions..As a Liverpool fan i am bloody embarrassed by this ..PURE GREED
finally the moneymen have come to roost
Manchester Utd and Manchester City Arsenal Tottenham and Liverpool  Chelsea Ac Milan Inter Milan Juventus R Marid. Barcelona. Going have on  super league. This crazy
With the huge teams gone, new teams will emerge as the NEW “Barcelona’s”, and etc ... Of every league where teams are being drawn out from. Just trying to see the bright site of things.
Can someone please explain to me why this is a bad move? Why do people have a negative reaction? Why would it "destroy" football? Please tell me. I couldn't understand why
nobody watch it
Welp, time to support MLS ✌
Gotta get bill Gates for this one :(
I dont care about history if this competition goes through it will be exciting.
Wait so are they kicked out of their national league, like will those 6 English teams be banned from the Premier League
those rich *******! don't fall into the trick that they are going to support, they are doing it to get money... i hereby boycott manchesterunited! ...  childhood manchester united fan.
NO TO THE SUPER LEAUGE
Tottenham in the super league ? 😂 so it clearly is about money...
Let them go if they want to not uefa ban on players or teams if the six English clubs want to rejoin the English football pyramid then they will have to start in the conference or league 2 on a caped budget and 7 academy players in the team make them earn there place back banning players from playing internationaly and in Europen club football hurts the game even more than this does I don’t agree with the league and I won’t be watching it either but this whole eye for a eye mentality doesn’t work
I might need to take off my Chelsea shirt and put on West ham shirt!!
Villa are getting a stadium expansion soon, all new fans are welcome! Nah but seriously this is a joke. Something needs to change soon!
Tbf the champion league isn’t the champions league
Who is gonna watch that league? Now fans have chance to show how powerful they are and just ignore that whole league.
Another scary thing is these 'founding' clubs have the power to bully the governing bodies like FIFA, EPL, UEFA as well. And that is exactly what they are doing too. Because these clubs are the prominent clubs represented in the domestic and international european leagues, it will also be a huge loss if these clubs are absent (or banned as some governing bodies has stated) from these leagues. These founding clubs know the governing bodies simply CANNOT afford to not have these teams competing in the normal leagues like the EPL. This is criminal manipulation.
SuperLeague is gonna be amazing, yeah sadly a lot of other teams will die but I dont care and why do you even need a million teams in this world. Bayern Munich and PSG will soon join as well. And no relegation model works just as well, it’s proven from MLB or NFL or NBA.
Most of the Pundits have made us "fans" hate this. We dont know whether its good or not
Do the players or managers even want this to happen, i dont think any players never want to play for their country again, it is shambolic and disgusting from the greedy owners
Myself and all my family have been stoke fans all there lives if stoke were as big as united or Liverpool I would honestly not want to support my club anymore. Feel bad for the fans of these big clubs. Just pure greed from there owners. FA sort it out you need to stamp this out now otherwise they will rune football
It’s a disgrace 😭
Won't happen. Players joined these clubs to win trophyS. When they're only eligible for one trophy, they'll want out, and the top players won't be interested in joining. Also, potentially, all these clubs may have voided their players, managers and coaches contracts, meaning ALL would be free to walk away for free. Collectively, they would be financially richer than their respective clubs, so don't necessarily expect the clubs to be in the stronger position.
Its embarrasing calling myself an arsenal fan
as a madrid fan.. knowing that florentino will be at the helm.. i’m beyond disgusted and ashamed.
Fair play to PSG and Munich for rejecting this
Football made by poor ruined by billionaire.
This is wrong!! But! If this league was going to be made no matter what did theses clubs feel like they were going to miss out on money if they didn’t join. Especially clubs like arsenal Tottenham who are struggling right now. They will get the money boost but being a Liverpool fan in very disappointed YNWA doesn’t really mean anything now does it
everyone now go and support barnsley
Serve 14 days notice to withdraw or face expulsion from the football league. And shame on any media network touching television rights with a barge pole. Disgraceful.
I just hope that if this does happen that the players to be able to play for their country
BAN ALL OF THEM FROM UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE , EUROPA LEAGUE & none of their players can play for country !
It’s all about money never mind new clubs will come into premier league and teams like Brighton Newcastle will win the league at last   Alas maybe not
As a United fan, this is a disgrace
Football isn't dead.
Anyone got any suggestions for a new Manchester Club if this goes ahead then I'd feel betrayed as a city fan
So it's an invitational?!?! That's absolutely horrific.
What is premier league viewership removing these teams? Next to nothing for outside England. Means no money flowing for England. Haha They will have to accept!
Arsenal fan here. I have been going off football the last few years as its all money and the home grown roots of football is dying. This is just the low of the low. Money grabbing cunts.
Im gonna move from spurs to bloody burnley.
Can we have afc Wimbledon and Accrington Stanley in the champions league now all the greedy big wigs have disappeared and given up with their fans
There will be no bans. When it comes to money, money rules. But my gut feeling is this is just leverage. This BS surfaces every few years. We will see what us as football fans are made off now, if this is really a serious move for the closed shop league. There will be deals done and us as fans will be hoodwinked. If ever there was a time to be together here it is folks. FIFFA, UEFA all corrupt and potentially this now. We just let them get away with it every time. Lets not forget the world cup in the desert fiasco and what it took to get that one through.
It's not right at all
Money money money that's all it is
Boycott, boycott, boycott.  If sky sports supports it cancel your membership if Amazon takes over which is the plan cancel your subscription because they will raise the price anyway. Americans don't watch football and 3rd world countries can't afford it and they have other things to worry about.  Save the EPL
It would be hilarious if the big 6 got relegated/made non league because just imagine how funny like West Ham challenging for the title
Guys comment who you used to support and who you'll support from here on out I'm a united fan who will probably be an Everton fan from now on
If the biggest stars like messi Ronaldo came forward and said we won't be playing in super league then the outcome might be different. Then these clubs would think twice before creating such leagues
So fellas you've not got a team any more? Norwich is available 🔰💛💚
I really don't understand the fuss about a European super league? Its either I don't grasp something about football or what, but every season we have the europa league, the champions league and depends where you are you can have competitions etc FA Cup, so whats the harm of these 12 big clubs that we only get to see play 1 a year if they are lucky to get drawn? Yes its about the money but this is a big step for football in my opinion.  P.s don't give hate bc I have a different opinion to you
So how many match do we get to watch a week. And how will the players fare
Rangers should be in this no matter what watp
This is a disgrace Thats coming from a Liverpool fan
It sickens me to even watch this
I quietly took off my Spurs shirt while watching this 😪😪😞😞😓
“Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of a cancer cell”
To any Chelsea fan that reads this.   These clubs have made it clear, money is more important then the fans... If you live in West London you’re welcome to watch football at Loftus Road. This is bigger then any rivalry
America needs to stick to inventing their own sports, and stop ruining ours
The money is disgusting
RIP Football, welcome soccer
I want to know what the players in this super league think about this 🤔
this is how soccer gets ruined
We need to get rid of this “super league” it is a disgrace they need to sort it out
Imagine only English clubs,Italian clubs and Spanish clubs are the ones who have actually accepted this silly proposal to destroy football and their fanbase worldwide 💔
Who will be the new big six?
As a Arsenal fan im absolutely ashamed of my club for this which isnt new but this is the cherry on top.
Stupid
Football has 4 billion of fans think half of them have just gone
Yeah, it’s about money Truer words have never been spoken
*Intense rubbing of hands*
Disliking this ain't gonna help lol
Makes me feel sick.
Shocking. I hope these 12 clubs will be punished.
this is a depressing day for football
Greedy bastards. RIP football
money money money
Time to walk away from football or move support to smaller teams.
please AC Milan leave the super league 😭
Wait!How will they make it year long. Just like the ipl by plauing each other twice + ome march a day or with matchdays. There will only be 66 matches, right?
small clubs and Tottenham hotspur
Wait so it's actually happening??!
None of the fans wants it it’s just about the money
F you greed and money!
I'm a 38 year old United fan. Fan for 35 years. If this happens - I'm done. I'll go support Aston Villa coz I've always loved them as my 2nd team.
Anyone want to come support Swansea city
The 'elite' clubs have stuck a finger up to the fans and the tradition, history and passion that made us all fall in love with this game. They have learned that the loyal and local fanbase is increasingly irrelevant as an income earner and so they have been betrayed. I'm a Watford fan, and I feel worried about the wider implications of this move on the sport, I can't imagine how it must feel to be a loyal fan of one of these breakaway sides right now. A dark day for football. RIP.
They won't do it- too much risk with backlash from players and fans - audacious bargaining tactic by top clubs to get an even greater share of TV revenue.
Spurs and Aersnal on Super league,  Leiceter and West ham NOT on Super league Kidding me lol
RIP football
A bit disingenuous for BT and Sky to criticise clubs for making money at fans' expense. Football used to be free-to-air until their paywall excluded fans from watching games. The only ones with the right to criticise here are the fans themselves.
No no no. The downfall of football...
disgrace
Absolutely disgusted by the greed of owners. As an arsenal supporter I'm embarrassed.
They ate fixing something that dose not need to be fixed it is like giving bill gates 20K
Absolutely disgusting Glazers out
Bring it on !
These are effects of monopoly and capitalism! Big corporations have gotten to an extent of defining everything for everyone else. The day FIFA allowed Clubs to become so commercial is the day this problem was born! Clubs should have never been allowed to run as businesses!
F*ck Uefa. I will support every Action against them.
This is an absolute joke and this will destroy the league from the prem all the way down to league 2
Big brown envelope coming UEFA’s way and a few old fat men’s signatures at the ready....
am i the only one who thinks compitition between big teams throughout the year is more interesting.??
Players must boycott
Gonna support PSG now. Done with Barca.
Fun fact: all of the English teams what are doing this aren't founder clubs of the efl
Disgusting
No to superleague No to var
Everybody knows Uefa is corrupt thats why im supporting the clubs for leaving.
You can't stop this from happening. It's wrong and offensive but people will flock to it. It's like Star Wars, you will boycott if you knew the original Canon. Yet a fan will arise
Games Gone
This is definitely a threat to the FIFA mafia. Unacceptable.
We can even beat Fulham.....
Stop super league
uuuhhh  GREED....  por favor no permitan esto   ....fair competition PLEASE.....
Uefa please do your best to save football
wtf
This is discrasful nobody wanted it
This has to be Stopped or Else The Beautiful Game Will Turn Ugly Forever.
Im not sure wut to do cause if i leave united peeps will call me plastic
Wankers
No chance for relegation for any of these 15 founders clubs? Seems corrupt to me
honestly as a city fan i’m disgusted by what my club and what all the top clubs are doing, this will be the end of football
تم تدمير كرة القدم
This has been in the works since years ago. When you have  corrupt UEFA and FIFA what do you expect?
Theyre trying to tell us its what we want as fans? Manipulative horrible behaviour
Why on earth would they be allowed to continue playing in their domestic leagues. With the money they are making, 3.5 billion just to enter, the other teams would have no chance competing against them.
These governing bodies have no one to blame, but themselves. They've let these clubs be bought by greedy, shady business men and state officials. WTF did they think that was gonna lead?
Let's be honest it's not gonna happen or atleast it won't last, especially considering everyone is pissed, the outrage from fans and ex players will be a message that they fucked up
now stoke city is going to tear up the prem xD
Football is officialy a rich man's sport.
I’m fuckin glad I support Sheffield wednesday not a top 6 club. Also I don’t think it will happpen , I think UEFA and fifa will stop it and the other football associations
We're so winning that
Fans will come around, and I won't be surprised.
So basically these 12 clubs are creating their own NFL/NBA league.
I support Spurs at the moment but if this goes ahead I will go and support my local club Watford
Give the champions league to psg... The other clubs wanna join this super league punish them by disqualifying them from the competition
Disgrace..
Cant wait for this :)
I'm really glad Leicester didn't take a part in this.
The Rest of World Football LIVID right now..  Apart from Arsenal fans 🤔🤔🤔
Absolutely disgusting what can my club compete for anymore on a cold Monday night the fa cup draw 3rd round praying for Liverpool or Man u now I'm hoping for Burnley or Everton 😑
Wait so even if Harry Kane stays at Tottenham, he could be banned from the Premier League and still not break the goal record? 🤣
Man why the hell are arsenal even there and they gonna finish last every season
I'm a utd fan, I DO NOT support this idea that the club has joined in with, however I will still support this club.
Im glory hunter. Visca barca
Owners are about to end football as we know it 😭
So the top 6 r not in the prem anymore
GALATASARAY
Trickle down economics?????????
Yk what the saddest thing is. No players or managers had a say in this. They’re careers which they worked hard for was decided for them. Everything they’ve ever worked for was just thrown away cuz of their greedy owners
I'm happy, basketball style football
We need the European super league
Folks are tuning in regardless. If they’re truly loyal to their team. Many act like the squad has say, it’s the board that holds final say. In the end, it’s a money transaction for these people in power. Greed can be a disease if you allow it. Issue with ownership is that once they get more, they want more. It’d be dope if they simply created the ‘Super League’ as just another major competition minus the breakaway. They could’ve worked that out. It’s the “breakaway” that’s devastating the world.
A disgrace
Guess they'll be getting J Lo and Pitbull to do the theme song of this new competition. Absolute joke how they're trying to Americanise everything! Currently looking at my artwork and posters of Manchester United hanging up in my room, contemplating taking it all down. Sad times.
I'm a real madrid fan and I don't like this  this is so unfair you have the money and history you get to the tournament by default you don't have that you're out or you can barely join and also nothing can replace the ucl
France and Germany have boycotted it tho I swear ???
Football is dead!!!
No more Fifa games after this..
Never thought PSG would be in the moral highground.   Have Porto and dortmund play 2 legs.  Have PSG play the winner in champions league final
Guess I’m now a Stockport county fan now.......
boycott
Disgusting from Chelsea
I'm a fan of one of the 6 and I'm disgusted by this. Not going to go to the games and I refuse to buy any merch.
From a spurs fan to West ham fan now, hammers!! I have never switched but I just can't do this, f off to the *financially* big teams
Why can’t they just work something out that doesn’t ruin the football
When you thought all the bad news ended with 2020...
all the English clubs chuck them out of the the Premier league sell outs
It’s a joke they only think about the money and what is the point? If you finish first or last you are still going to win lots of money. No ones going to want to play and no one is going to want to watch it and it will be a huge impact on the lower teams. Sort it out it’s a disgrace
Disgrace
It's only what Sky and The Premier League did to the old First Division. It's all the same greed.
The European Super League is the most stupidest decision I've ever heard from this this i don't even have words for how shameful this  It is just so they can get the extra cash
Just asking why?
Sky and BT are going to be out-greedied. £15 a match? £50 a month for Sky Sports? Then they introduce VAR to try and save the flagging viewing figures and kill it. So they're going to lose it.
Awful idea, that's what the champions league is for ! Completely ruining football
Relegate them .. From a chelsea fan.
Hypocritical fa trying to get to a high ground. Lets not forget fa is the reason the pl is already a super league when they allowed rich owners like abrahimovic and mansour to pump unlimited money into the club and buy trophies. When they allowed owner like kroke and glazers to use the club like their sex toys to please themselves rather than fans. Where was there morality then? They are only mad now because they are not getting a peice of the cake. This abomination of esl is the hate child of fa lets not forget that.
Well those clubs won't have to worry about racial abuse anymore on social media , they are going to suffer another type of abuse which will make the owners want to sell. The owners of those English clubs should sell and buy a European club if they love European competition so much
THIS IS DISGRACEFUL
This won't make me stop supporting Liverpool. The powerful run the world. These are the team that win most of the trophies in their respective countries and they will continue to do so, if they feel that they want more competitions, then so be it. People complained the same way about the uefa nations league, but I see stadiums full in every game.
Come support Everton q club who does things right 👍🏽
if u didn't know... club football has always been about money... the players , the clubs we fans are fools to not believe this...
Let’s call it European Soccer Super League, cuz that’s not football mate
make it happen!
" You will never walk Alone ".... didn't realise when that "never" changed to "have to " !!!!!!😞😞😞
Tbh football is not really competitive  compared to American sports. In football it's always the same teams with the most money that win the league, with rare anomalies (Leicester, Wolfsburg, Deportivo La Coruna) over the last 20 years. The only way a small team can eventually win the league is if they get a multi-billionaire owner(s) who can provide the resources needed to win titles. There are also too many crap millionaire footballers. So a league with the best of the best footballers who actually deserve to be millionaires makes sense in this regard. If the Super League becomes a separate league there should be a draft system and salary cap system in place as well to ensure high level competition consistently. The world is changing, so the Super League will probably happen, traditional leagues will remain but won't be as exciting and will lose money big time. The only people that can stop it are top pro footballers if they boycott and decide not to play, but they won't.
If anyone wants to support Saints, we’ll welcome you with open arms... (especially Liverpool fans) 😂
Spurs and arsenal in a super league lol, they aren’t even champions league quality.
Arsene WENGER predicted this a long time back..😎
the thing is that sky would be one of the first to broadcast the league, this can only be stopped if broadcasters refuse to comply or big name players refuse to play in the league
And.................Tottenham Hotspur. 😂
Put a de-esser on this guys mic
Will be amusing to see spurs tenth in the premier League and bottom of the super League. Hahahaha
footballs finished just these stupid fkn money grabbing turbs!😡
Joel. Glazer fck u
The Super League will happen and you will watch it.
As a Bolton fan this Herts that I will never experience the Premier league again
Maybe football lovers all around the world were disadvantaged, about that club, despite how greatness and honoured they are, were seeking that "rebel-backed" European Super League. There was some elite so-called "football rebels" said that the Champions League and all UEFA club competitions is worthless, but they didn't care about football and just care about business, "money, money, money", just like that. They're being careless about being revoked by their own decision, and thus drowned into the declining era.
🤬
I'd like to know how the players feel about this
Mighty Arsenal can't even go past Fulham but wanted to join a league to play with Real , Barca on weekly basis...😂😂
I’ll never forgive my club for this even if it doesn’t go through, almost going through an identity crisis...
Proud that Bayern isnt involved yet
Excited for this tournament! Can't wait
Boycott them..whatever it takes
So every year these teams plus a couple of others play themselves instead of the champions league? Sounds boring. Where's the romance, Where's the intrigue? I know these teams normally make Champ League but look what happened to Liverpool this season. This just seems wrong.
No one buy the games
I don't understand the outrage, the breakaway is only on the European level, so the prem will continue just without possibilities for fairy tail runs into the top 4 places. A Leicester miracle could still happen just to win the league, and not like a Leicester could become a European regular and win it someday anyways, it will always be the royalties that compete in the last stages. It is basically just a reform against UEFA more than anything,  not like UEFA is known for being the cleanest organization, and with the sketchy FFP stuff. Yes it will be more Elitist stopping the cyclical downfalls for the "elite clubs" and clubs like Arsenal being in it makes no sense but it's not like "destroying football".
6:03 so the founding clubs did all of this just because of money..... This is a disgrace
What does the footballers think of this😕
You can bet your bottom dollar that sky gets the rights.  Then it will be the best football league in the world .!!
Its the Lowest Point for football ever
So proud that no German team joins it probably the most best league than in the world
They have the power and they have the legal standing also.  If EPL bans them they'll lose big TV money because no foreign TV rights is based on watching Aston Villa play Brighton. They know there's a president of MLS players playing in FIFA competitions so FIFA doesn't have a legal standing to stop their players playing in FIFA tournaments. UEFA preempted this announcement by appealing to emotions. Politicians that doesn't understand football is running and giving comments.  The dispute is about Ceferin's idea of forcing these teams to play in expanded champions league where competitions is a lot weaker (not gonna sell on TV) hence less revenue. They're already doing thus playing in their domestic leagues. UEFA is just too corrupt and maybe these teams are too greedy as well. But they generate the revenue and deserves more money and better competitions.
The great reset
I did support united but if this does continue then I’m supporting Salford
Okay so, I know that they will carry on in their current leagues and it just replaces the champions league, and I actually don't mind the format, but the part I hate is that it will just allow the 15 founding clubs to compete every year, even if teams like liverpool and tottenham have bad seasons like they are now, they will still just be allowed to compete in it because of some apparent right to do so? Everyone loves it when teams like Ajax and Porto make it to champions league semis as the underdogs. Also, the stuff about these clubs getting €3.5 billion is ridiculous. It will just create more of a monopoly amongst the best players, and then we wont see teams like leicester or west ham or atalanta becoming big european clubs as all this money will just give the big clubs even more money. I dont understand why everyone in this believes that they need even more money. Most big clubs still make hundreds of millions every year, what do these clubs expect? €1 billion spent every transfer window? Anyway, I'm gonna stop ranting now.
I'm as disgusted as everyone else, but also I just think about how dreadfully boring this league would be, luckily I'll be boycotting it, but my god, how boring seriously
As a fc barcelona fan football is dead today . Rest in peace messi and koeman and laporta.  Stop this idea of destroying this legacy which is created by the fans for so many years
To watch this League, you just need an annual subscription to another broadcaster for 15 € per month! Shame on you
So it begins .... they'll move the World Snooker from the Crucible to China next.
This is a disgrace. Its destroying football and these 12 teams are just greedy for money. It’s a bloody disgrace
Brentford here i come!!!
3.5 billion tho...
Dock points. Fines and bans as well
Disgracee!!
The fact that my team that lives by the fact that they are "mes que un club" are on that list of founding clubs to kill the sport kills my soul.
Im stacked for ESl
“Yeah it’s about money” someone get those words carved on stone
this sort of thing should only be done on fifa, its a disgrace that it's happened in real life and all the owners involved should be ashamed at what they've done
Sanctions for all involved 20 points deduction and financial cap for next season and transfer bans. Fans of all clubs involved don't let your team become a franchise.
Just costing fans more money to watch it which sports channel is it going to be on and how much more money will it cost a fan to watch this league never mind travelling to other countries to watch it live
Stop
This will ruin football.
Bolton Wonderers in Super League!
This is a absolute disgrace
League games and uefa champions league were fine, why change something that works, I just don’t understand
Don’t you guys think you only oppose this because the media and football associations say it’s bad?
Glazers 😡😡😡😡
100% agreed.
Why's the world so clapped nowadays 😔
There will be corruption and even possibilties of match fixing may arise....
Man! First Chelsea, City, PSG and partly Real Madrid ruined football by boosting transfers and clubs with backalley money. Then came all those ridiculous political statements like LGTBQ and BLM. For me that was the final nail in the coffin. If i haven't lost all interest this will definitely do it!
They think they will get away with it because they are attacking European football and not Premier league! It's wrong... I'm disgusted with Arsenal agreeing to this!
We can't allow this to happen
Count me out Real Madrid 😑
Disgusting.
F in the chat for football as we know it. What a sad day.
The premier league is the most watching league in the world what happens to the fans as well there just gonna be forgotten about is that it Man City are even gonna win 3 cups so far it looks like and they wonna ruin it because it says it will start as soon as possible like tf...
This is a fantastic idea and as a fan of one of the clubs in question, I can't wait for it happen.
I made a custom tournament with these teams back in the day on Fifa 2003
Leicester city come on 🦊
Well done, watch all the other premier League cups get destroyed from this
Oh I hope so dearly that chelsea just send their academy guys or second-string team to this competition. Oh how sweet would that be. I'm not gonna watch the super league no chance. Oh and also send athony barry as coach. That would be hilarious. Cause I don't see any other way players could survive that schedule. The problem is no one asked for this. While a lot of people surely are "change = bad" I don't think that's the case here. We want the league to be more competitive that every pl owner invests in their club and makes them better, which in turn makes the whole league better. This just increases the gap between the bigger teams and the smaller teams. So either you relegate all these teams from the pl or we get the same top 6 every year. Bye bye to leceister and west ham making top 6 again. Cause the big 6 will just outspend them. Horrible horrible idea.
The Americans can't control Uefa, so they decided to break it from the inside. Sport is politics, and football is the king of sports. And the United States needs total control over the entire world.  The main sponsor of the Super League is JP Morgan. It's obvious.
Our desire is for the top teams to fight for their place in the champions league and then play against each other. not make a closed league and keep playing against each other every other week. STUPIDEST DECISION EVER MADE!
Bro I honestly thought this would've died out. We can't let this happen UEFA needs to make some rules so that these clubs and their players can't play in any domestic and international tournaments.
Disgrace
Its a heartbreaking news. I don't want my children to see this
Relegate the clubs that signed and suspend all players from international tournaments
it's pathetic
The thing makes me laugh is the champions League is great due to playing othe big clubs from other Nations every couple weeks and that's only certain ones playing the same 11 teams week in week out defeats the objective of playing those 🤷‍♂️ and no disrespect to arsenal or spurs but if I was one of there fans watching your team lose every week to better clubs surely going to be fun for u 🤷‍♂️
Take away their titles, league and UCL.
Juventus only accepted because they are in debt 😔
My worst nightmare has come true
we have to try and stop this :(
I actually thought i never would say this but i am ashamed to support Arsenal
It's absolutely disgusting for these teams to make their own cup. Football has totally become a money seeking business. If this continues, I can say that Football is officially finished.
Only corruption can come from this...
If this is what these clubs want then I really hope the respected Leagues and UEFA will ban the clubs from all competitions entirely and if possible terminate all contracts the clubs have with players and staff so they can go on free, and the players and staff who don't leave to be banned from play in EURO and World Cup competitions. I've lost all interest in watching these clubs play, let alone giving my support. Already removed notifications and reminders. I guess you could say I'm boycotting without even being bothered. I'm now on the lookout for a new club to support. Anyone?
3.5 billion. 😳😳😳.  Ok ok.  Maybe it’s not a bad idea.
It’s just a desperate attempt to generate money. You think they’re giving away 3 Bill per team for nothing? It’s probably for Corona testing machines at matches 😑 2 facts. Kronke will be keeping 2 billion of Arsenals money. Every club will be releasing a home, away and 3rd “ Super Leauge!” Kits
Let them do it let them ruin it and see what happens
Seems like an act for anger. Dont believe everything u see. Attention
I really hate why Manchester City agreed to this
What do you wantt? Its greaaaatt
This is greed.Manchester United want to through away their history for this.I would sack the board they clearly don’t care about the history of their clubs
Time for Messi, Ronaldo and neymar to transfer to either Germany or clubs like PSG, West Ham, leceister and etc.
My mind is like blowing 😣 bad feel under my stomach and can't even concentrate on TV , wtf is happening😖😵💔🤯
More globalists getting rich off the pandemic.. it all needs boycotting.
It's a jackpot for Formula 1. Most of us would rather watch Formula 1 rather than football😔
Absolute disgrace, and if the players who participate in this league can't compete in the Euros, the face of international football competitions run by UEFA, and maybe FIFA, will change completely
Money grabbing bastards. It's disgusting how we now have a league where there is no promotion or relegation
I cant believe this at all it's a outrage
Why is this so bad? They are still gonna compete in there domestic league?
Declare West Ham the PL champions and give Jesse Lingard the Balon D Or.
Well. This is definitely one of the worse and terrible times as football fan. I think I should start supporting my local club 🙌
The government should nationalize all clubs and return them to the supporters.
Nooooo 😢
Ima start supporting Frankfurt full time now
My guys out here tryna play dream league soccer irl
This league, made UCL is not UCL anymore.  Boycot this league.
Can someone explain to me this super league and why it's so bad please. I know  what it is but I don't understand why it's so bad ?
I don't see anything bad, but just the creation of a new tournament. UEFA doesn't help the clubs during difficult situations, they have to survive themselves. UEFA just makes money that's it. Did it help any club during the Pandemic? UEFA is just a stomach, no brain for innovations. Now when the biggest clubs decided to change something they can not accept it. The only thing they worry about is its stomach, they want the bigger or biggest piece of the pie. Even Champions League was criticized in 1950s
As fans, no matter who we support, we should come together and boycott this disgrace.
I don't want liverpool to be out the prem or the champions league no more moments like last year if they do come back I hope they still keep them in the prem but just get rid of the owners
it seams the english FA have made prominent people to tarnish the image of the SUPERLEAGE🤔🤫🤷‍♂️
It's treason
why spurs 🤣
Cr7 left the chat ffs
Sky: This is disgraceful. Also Sky: How much to show the new Super League?
Well with European soccer officially dead I guess it’s time for South America to take advantage of this and get back to being top quality football
Booo City !!!!!
Disgrace for the game. Everyone wants to run wherever money is.
Well idea is nice. All top European teams should be put in one league so we get to see strong competition and matches.  Round robin tournament not knockout like UCL.
Eradicate their trophies from history and expel them from the PL, issue their league titles to the highest placed non big 6 team for each season
AFAIK PL votes pass with 14 votes. Here’s hoping the 14 vote the 6 out of the Prem.
It's all about money not football. The rich clubs get richer and the poor get poorer. Fans neglected. A disgusting decision.
This will be interesting. Time to change football.
Make them move out of the country
i'm dissapointed and as well as shocked like what were they thinking joining this for arsenal. They know their form right now and joined the league just to get crushed for good? did they accept it because it was the only way to enter big match as tgey cant be even top 6? did they join for money? did they got swayed away by good talks from those people that said"despite your struggling over these seasons, you are one of great club in history "? And why spurs there? so many english clubs? because for money only. Such a dissapointing league i've been supporting.
Lol Sky is so nervous their TV deal won’t be a good investment now, that’s what 70% the fear-mongering is
This is just modern elitism and promoting superiority complex
This is great news more competition and money for clubs to win. It will help shorten the money gap between arab money and abromovic money. Hopefully the 3bil payout is soon
This is a disgrace fans should boycott this
This is ridiculous!
This Is The death of football.
Yeah its about moneys again..
i want to care but i just dont, i dont give any of my money to anything football related. i watch free streams, play 5 a side for free when i can and support the same club my dad supports.  does this all mean we will see draft picks like in nba ?
Not saying I agree with the new super league, but football is already full of greed anyways. Where there is money, people will follow.
This is not nba 😐  what? Uefa champion league is outdated now? , is that what it is? or perhaps likes of  clubs like  Milan,   Valencia,  arsenal which once were amazing teams just  cant compete in uefa for last few years  because they play bad and now this clubs need a respect back ? Jee jus man
So this is how football dies... This is just a punch in the face for everyone who truly loves the game... The ones who play in the Sunday leagues and support the club nonetheless...
Fans will follow their terms
I was already close to giving up on football, this is the last straw
Three clubs must be psg,bayern munich, and borussia dortmund
American money and influence they don’t give a damn about the fans!
This is the first time I feel shame supporting my club
This is the final nail in football...I'm a  United fan but if this happens then I won't be anymore
So if super league starts then champions league would be done forever?
Mike Ashley could make a big name for himself here.
I get it though the clubs just want to play each other more
Football is all about the fans......
Its just greed. Pure greed
My club has just ruined football... Wow
Blame European football associations for allowing money bags to take over clubs 100%. They should've reduced foreign ownership to no more than 50%
Its just.... sad
they said its a league for the best teams in europe. the 12 team founded it and none of them is from bundesliga or ligue 1 why??? where is psg bayern and dortmund
Its pure greed!
They should allow only top4 club yo compete in ucl
💔Time to find a new love...
How is this bad
when this fails in a year or two the leagues that the clubs were originally in should strip the owners of their clubs or say you will have to start at the bottom of non league.
Football died years ago. Get down your local non-league side!  Arsenal fan, die hard. My grandad worked at Highbury, it’s in the family.   However, with the way football is (prices, so far away from the working man, players ambling round, the Kroenkes being scum, VAR, the money in the game... it’s all just massive bore off.  Proper to take my lad to watch non-league.
WHY SPURS! Well idc i'll watch it regardless...
Why?? Clubs r ruined cause of corona n uefa doesnt gives us lots of money super league can gives us more than 2times
LETS GO SUPER LEAGUE👑🎊❤️
This will only work as a pre-season tournament.
Can’t wait for Aston Villa v Benfica Champions league final
The only way arsenal could come back in European league
Totally outrageous
at least 10 billion euros, I mean...
So? Why are you all emotional? Every one of you would chose £££ over Fans...
About super league, those clubs have 95 percent global audience. It's UEFA to lose. They will take all TV deals. Who desires watching Liecester or westham in champions league. Let them first become big clubs with fans. I support super league. Other clubs should not just Leach on popularity of the big clubs.
😭😭😭 my god, imagine life without the normal premier league
This is just sad
well i mean FIFA is corrupt, UEFA is corrupt, and these 12 clubs are individually corrupt   theres a reason i dont like soccer in Europe lol
This is a disgrace take away the sport we love like this.  The owners of these 12-13 clubs are greedy. Probably 95% of football fans including me think this idea of a European super league is disgraceful.
Don't say you're doing this for us. The fans are happy with the current state of affairs. You just want to fill your coffers. THE FANS DO NOT WANT THIS.
play all the youth and development players, turn it into a european youth league.
new west ham supporter ✌🏻🙂⚒
Natural next step
I would love to watch such games
OMG- Chelsea!!!!! As a blues' fan I don like this
All the more you shouldn't buy any of the clubs merchandize and should just turn to china for fakes or even subscribe to any cable network for football.
My man lowkey broke at 6:13  You could feel he was trying hard to stay objective
If they come back, send every team involved to the lowest level of the country and take away 85% of their money so they know what it feels like to be a league 2 side
So basically the champions league will be dead if this idea comes through.
Time to support lower league football. Hope no one watches this   new format.
Absolute disgrace. I will never watch or give my money to any of these pathetic clubs. Kick them out of the league and be done with them. I would rather support my local club after this. Pathetic owners.
People fear change. Change is good.
I can't imagine I am going to miss Norwich next season
“Created by the poor destroyed by the rich”
Remember the wall btw east and west germany, these mfers just built it again. Must unite all fans against these owners.
Yes i support 😍
So can arsenal still play in the premier league
i don't understand what's wrong with the super league
"yeeh this is about money" 😔
The point of this is to make big popular clubs with great extroadinary players go against each other in their own league so it can generate more tickets and revenue which makes the manenegment richer but when big clubs play against each other every week it will lose the big game concept and will turn into just another game.
Such massive change surely means players get to walk away from their contracts!
3 Londen clubs 2 manchester club 2 Milaan club  2 Madrid club   How lame can is get
Deny these clubs any other competitive play, and deny their players any national team play. Supporters of these clubs need to walk or else they are equally responsible.
Football will lose out, fans will boycott..
15 psychopaths sat at the table and announced...
Good no one will take the 2nd rank of AC Milan now.
I am ex lfc fan i am just waiting on ex utd fans to pick there new team so i can choose the rival of that team
I know you guys against it and I am sure you guys can’t stop watching it. So calm down don’t slap your face
For Christ's sake this aint FIFA/PES 🚮
Am I correct in saying that all leagues will still continue and this will be added
No, I don't want this. I hate this idea.
😂😂😂This can't be real.
Watching SuperLeague will be like stuffing yourself with the same cake every day. Will get disgusting pretty quickly!
woow woow super league
lets gooooo
I HATE UEFAMAFIA THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE 🤩😍💙
Good they must add my club from 🇿🇦 South Africa
gold digging league
On the search for a new club. Any suggestions?
Screw the owners. Greedy trash. I'm done with football. Filthy!!! Ban the lot! Dock the 6 clubs points immediately!
How ? Please explain you guys are a bunch of snowflakes just because your team isn't in there . If they were you would be all for it . This is like a real life video game .. I love it 😍😭
Well
Football is done
This is how it's feels when you get disowned by your own club, huh?
I'm here laughing that people think these owners give a damn about how fans feel. I'm an Arsenal fan and I know for sure that Kroenke was the first owner to agree to this. Maybe I'm just accustomed to my shitty owner, but I can't believe people thought these clubs would do anything else but join the Super League.
Joel Glazer the 🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀
Arsenal fans finally happy 😃
From today onwards.. I'm no longer an arsenal fan... I'm joining the aston villa family
I don't see how this helps the football pyramid... All this is going to do is make the super teams even more op by giving them even more money... Small clubs can barely compete as it is, now you want to give the giants even more money? Where's the logic? Lol
Relegate the traitors immediately!
SAY.NO.TO.EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE
We already have a European super league it's called the Champions league.
Can someone explain what is wrong with super league?  It will be exciting, more match for fans, more money being generated to uplif the clubs?
I actually like this idea of European super league. People who are saying this is about money are hypocrites because EPL, Champions league, World cup are also about money. FA, UEFA, FIFA are  upset because they are losing a share of the revenue and control. For me its exciting watching these big clubs compete with each other often.  These big clubs are saying they will still compete in National leagues , this super league is an additional entertainment for fans as well, whats wrong with that. I love it.  People complaining about money and greed, give me a break, its always been about money and greed even before this. Clubs, businesses and people like you and me always strive to improve our income and better ourselves
Boycott this, don't watch the matches on TV and don't buy tickets for the matches.
What the hell are spurs doing there??
🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
How has it come to this my friends. But can i know how do Tottenham survive in that
PSG and Bayern rejected superleague🎉🎉
I’m confused so why exactly is this a bad thing for football
The 50+1 rule would have stopped this
$$$£££€€€ it's all about
HOW IS THIS A DISGRACE GOOD FOR THE GAME
Have they signed a TV deal??????.No TV Deal no go!!!!
Now that chelsea is out of every major competition im gonna have to support another london club... What should i go with... Man this is gonna suck The ucl was good enough But nooooo the fooking rich wants more like always RIP football Dont call it the european super league Call it the european soccer league They deserve to be called that
I'm not watching football anymore 😕😔
This can only happen with fans.Boycott the games and it's finished.Simple.
The UEFA champions winner for this year will be PSG? 😂😂😂
everybody, please calm down. this is all just a poker game. these big clubs just wanted to use this Super Trash League excuse to negotiate a bigger share of the existing profits. i dont think they will REALLY start this league. It's all just a big bluff to see who folds first. if you really really sit down and think about it, this Super Trash League makes no sense. It wouldn't work.   In a week's time, these founding clubs will issue statements that they will cancel the Super Trash League.  Don't start tossing your jerseys to the fire just yet, lads..........
Imagine the bungs that will be happening to get this one over the line and regulated
I created this kind of league in PES around 10 years ago. It was exciting at first though.
Never been more disappointed in liverpool owners for agreeing with this idea. Absolutely disgraceful and profit driven.
I hope you never get to air a single game! You’re crying because the parasite teams will lose MONEY!
How are they going to play 22 more matches added to the already hectic schedule.
Stamford Bridge is so ugly
What wider football piramid? The top clubs treasury is going to get fat.
It's like an English league with a few extras. Nuts.
I'm ManUtd fan, but above that, I'm football fan, f*ck.
The end of football as we know it
Can someone explain this to me please?
He's got me shorts....... Golden Gordon.
These guys acting disgusted but do you think Sky will boycott the competition? Hell no 💰
AC Milan, owned by an American Investment firm. Inter Milan, owned by a Chinese company Juventus, owned by, for legal reasons lets call them, "Italians". Interesting. Its as if the non-Italian owners of Italian teams don't care about Italian football, and sure don't give a damn about the cities themselves.  Arsenal, Chelsea, City, United, Liverpool, Tottenham ("English" owner). Same deal. In Spain, the presidents are voted in by the greed of the shareholders.  This isn't a sporting competition, its a racket, run like the American "sporting" franchises. To the fans of the teams involved, we've jokingly called you "consumers" instead of "fans" for years. If this goes through, I guess it won't be much of a joke anymore.
Disgraceful being a liverpool fan at this moment
The fact that there are no one from farmer league
Greed.
Everyone against the super league without even understanding why. Uefa wanted to add more teams to the ucl and make it a league format which means more games and more money for them while players suffer and play more games. So uefa are the selfish ones here if you ask me
lol . uefa , fifa n the premier league just got violated n it's funny af 🤣 the top dogs bout to watch they're p'z disappear
I knew this was a terrible idea as soon as I learned that Spurs is considered a Super Club.
No To Super League 🙅🏽‍♂️🙅🏽‍♂️🙅🏽‍♂️🙅🏽‍♂️
I never thought Dream League Soccer would become a reality
a third of these clubs have never won a european cup.
Well looks like I'm in to volleyball now
Pure nonsense!!
Honestly though how can the PL ban their biggest clubs and not take a hugeee loss? Maybe even crumble. This sucks but I think the Super League has leverage here.
Disgusting.
if this will actually happen and UEFA and FIFA wont accept this and wont participate in a so called super league, the football world will burn this summer.
SLEXIT.  Much like Megxit's car crash Oprah interview will only lead to a backlash, exclusion, and ridicule.
Bastards
Can someone explain ne what’s the problem? I have been seeing comments here and on Instagram tht “we can’t let this happen”. I m not a very football person but I keep my self updated with such news. Pls a line or two lines will be enough
Fifa must stand their ground and not except this rubbish and if these teams threaten to leave Europa league or UCL then their respective leagues must cut them loose as it will be chaos on who goes to ucl when the top 4 is made up of those teams that don't want to participate in Europe.  So disapointing😭
I think this one is unstoppable. Like when the premier league broke out from the championship.
For me as a fan of the game, I've been waiting for the creation of a intercontinental league like the fifa club world cup, that would be far more exciting
It’s not the clubs, it’s the owners
Money and only 💸💸 No one cares about the fans😠😠
We need to stand up because with fans the game is nothing
You know what? Let this happen! Expel these clubs from domestic competitions, ban players from international competitions. We’ll see how “popular” and “rich” they are in 3 years! The best players will move back to the real, competitive Champions League anyway! There will be no prestige in a closed off American style franchise where you don’t have to FIGHT for a spot. Boooring! If the clubs ever wanna go back, they will be given a fair chance at the bottom league! Enjoy the decade of progress, it will teach you to appreciate “the ladder”😀
No German teams, thats very Perfect. 😉🙏💪
The owners statement should have simply said: we want more power and money
Fans are gonna crazy yes but! thats imply another meaning....
Not watching it is the only way.
I think this is a fantastic idea period. The biggest clubs in the world join to create a super competition that will be very exciting. They will make more money because they can. Big teams have always had great power already. Now, they just say damn you to uefa and make their own league to make money. The only downside I can think of is that the domestic leagues, apart from the championship race which usually just consists of two teams, wouldn't be as competitive as it is now due to no top 4, top 6 race or such anymore. Maybe, another con could be that we will not see surprises as we do in the ucl, i.e atalanta or port made it to the quarterfinal of the ucl.  I'm saying this as a fan of one of the big club in a foreign country so my perspective may be greedy and does not align with smaller teams' benefit but a league of elite clubs is absolutely brilliant.
How TF are Arsenal in this they’re struggling to win games in the Europa league
This is where we stop 🛑 watching football ⚽
What is happining to our beautiful game
All just because Chelsea 2-5 to West Brom. They vowed to never allow it again
How did the dream league soccer game know about this 🤔?
utter disgrace. Forgotten all the hard work of Busby, Ferguson, Paisley, and many more. Disgusting
State of Sky. You wanted me to pay £15 to watch Burnley vs Sheffield United.
i will miss the  ucl even though my team never won it . ucl matches gave me reason to stay alive
Manchester United >lecister.
Why is everyone crying. It’s mid week. The normal marches continue. Why would I not want to see the best club’s play every week. I’m excited. Sounds amazing to me. The best league in the world. And premier league continues on Saturday
ridiculous.
and you'll be watching this super league live on sky sports *wink *wink
Football has gotten diluted.
Don't be fooled!!! This is all a ploy so that Everton wins the FA Cup, Premier and Champions League. Ancelloti is an evil mastermind! 🤯
I don’t quite understand the widespread anger and dissent in relation to this news. Particularly from the supporters of the founding members. Because it seems to me, if they can carry on participating in their respective leagues, then for a Man City fan or a Man United fan they’re really not losing anything. What they’re gaining is that they can play quality opposition regularly in Europe. And for those football purists who’ve got their panties in a twist over this, they can watch the cold night at Stoke during the rest of the week. It’s not really damaging to the clubs fans.
Hold on a minute.... Tottenham???!!!
Makes sense this was coming, just look at how little Pep cared about the League Cup.
This is how football dies...
Its a new competition. They aren't leaving any competitions. There is nothing wrong with this!! More sports!
The best solution to this isn't banning teams as that harms everyone and it will create a devastating split in the sport as these clubs are worth too much. Let them have their Super League or workout a fair compromise to allow the competition to run side by side. I see this as UEFA Being hostile to anything that could possibly challenge the status quo. UEFA and FIFA don't have to recognise the competition officially and surely they would lose far more by banning the teams than just continuing with their usual business. It's a closed competition, so it's very likely that the viewer traction will gradually recoil into nothingness over time.
Lol Tottenham big clubss
As Arsenal fans, I feel disgrace about Arsenal to join European Super League. Instead, Arsenal can be repair the mentality of the team.
Isn't Uefa corrupt? Why is this bad?
VIRUS
“Yea it’s about money” 😂
I don't get why fans are opposed to this. This will be so good to watch
The beautiful game is now just a play thing for billionaires who are bored and greedy for MORE money. Sad day for the greatest sport on earth.
Oh my gad everyone stop crying, this is the future. It'll be fiiiiinnnneee.
I am all for it, why should mastercard, Sony and Gazprom get all the money, breakway and remove VAR as well.
F this bs!!!
Premier  League without  the big six yeah come on Norwich champions 2022 I'm actually a manu fan
Boycott this bs!
Greedy money grabing buisness men protecting their investments at the expense of the history of clubs and fans, i hope the premier leauge deducts them points and explels them from all domestic cups, feel for the fans but they need to be sent a message
“Created by the poor, stolen by the rich”  Live by these words, don’t let them steal our beautiful game.  SAY NO TO EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE
👎
Of Course, this is backed by JP Morgan. No surprise there. Those guys are quite the octopuses. Let's see what hapens.
Between founding clubs and football associations, founding members clearly have the power in this game theory situation, however an important variable on this are the players themselves.   They can’t pay all of them the amount earned by this super league, so if u don’t want this nonsense, then make sure players aren’t ok with this supe league.
What about Nottingham Forest, when are we Joining hahahaha
Sies
I think it's good
RIP title race, mid table struggle, relegation battle. Its gonna be a big throwing league. Teams that already made the playoffs can throw, teams that don't make the playoffs can throw. This is going to kill the game.
These greedy clubs should learn from the German League Clubs.Proud to be a Dortmund fan that is true to its supporters!
3.5 billion if so then how much money did UEFA Champions league made all those times ? UEFA must have  ripped off these clubs  and didn’t give them enough Shares
European league will become charity league 😂....plyrs will  play for fund their clubs...i feel bad if the project really happen, all football fans around the world should label them so called 'rich,full history,big' as 'beggars club!'😂
Tottenham??? How does a club with no trophies get in here???
I’ve always had a soft spot for villa anyway.   Throw those greedy sods out of our league.
Great news
As a barca fan this is so sad 😢😢😭😭🙄🤦
Six clubs will get 400 million super league money and over 100 million from the premier league !!  No other team can compete with that.. they would have to be kicked out of the league.
F*cK you European super league
I've been supporting ManU since I'm a little kid. I'm so disappointed and I don't know if I will continue supporting them if they go through with this....
I’m really confused about this, does that mean there is no premier league or laliga?
Ban all of the clubs that signed up!
3.5 billion??? How much of that will these greedy owners pocket?!!
Leicester have more Premier leagues than spurs. How is spurs big six? Delusional.
Well Leicester has a new fan now.... Ffs barca 😟😟
All *actual* football fans need to unite and fight against this, Boycott this * Money league *
Ah yesss. Finally, I will get rid of this addiction - football. I won’t have to watch it anymore.
Boycott, start a petition and riot!
Why is everyone complaining about this? Tell me how this will ruin the football? How is this a disgrace to fans?
Boycott it people no demand no supply dont watch the games
The only reason there’s huge propaganda against it is simply because the governing bodies are the clubs themselves in this case meaning they don’t need a regulator. Something associations hate because they like the dirty money involved behind the curtains in all current competitions. The super league would form a new path for conduction football competitions without a 3rd party. Don’t be fooled by the media. There’s a reason they all agree on something for once.
As long as there is the champions league and the premier league I don’t really care
Let them.  Then if they want to participate in their domestic leagues, charge them a hefty tax and distribute that money.
Looks like I only support gamba Osaka now
i mean sure the owners got behind the scence and planned this big joke of a leauge, but will the players actually play or agree to this? cuz they can easily not play, i mean a fine or two from their clubs won't matter to them .
I don’t think players should be punish I feel like they have no say for the club it’s just the greedy people at the top of the club, the people at top should be punished fired fined!
Disgusting. RIP Football.
Players are human not robots. 😠
Goodbye Arsenal, glad I have been tracking Westham's performance
if these teams don't want to play champions league and europa then what is the point of having sf and finals this year as well, declare psg as winner of cl and have a europa league final of roma and villareal.
Corrupt UEFA is sweating now massively. Not that I like the idea but I just love seeing this corrupt UEFA suffering now.
Football.. leagues cups in jeopardy ... We won't stand for this
They doing all this before Qatar World Cup 🤔 hmmmmmm
This is not surprising but I’m wondering why everybody thinks it’s so bad? It’s just a league and admission to it has been based on performance it’s just that the performance they’ve gone off is revenue.
As a lifelong Man Utd fan I'm fuckin embarrassed. I will boycott this league no matter what. Glazers out 🖕
I supposed the extra money is worth arsenal getting destroyed every week by Barcelona and Madrid and City
It's all about money 💰💰 and it's not fair at all
Biggest change in football ever.
How is he gonna say it’s our job to respond to their desires, when literally nobody or the 4 billion fans wanted this or even still want this to continue. They are all a disgrace to football, they only do it for the money.
This is a disgrace to football and I hope all the clubs will come running back and forced to start from rock bottom. However, in reality, this will flourish even if Europe boycotts it foreign watchers will bring the money in, and it will be normalized for a few decades before some new money making method overtakes it I rly want this to fail but I can’t see it happening and if they do come back to the pl they will just find some new bribe to get past the punishments
To all football lovers Football is not finished, because football is all about fans, and we are football, not these gold diggers. We will play and we will support football, and we wanna show the gold diggers that we love football not the clubs. We wanna show them what is passion, we wanna show them what is football, and we wanna show them they are nothing.  We are football Created by poor, carried by passion.
i like the idea of this super league
This was Cantona's speech. You guys thought he was crazy.
WE CANT LET THIS HAPPEN football is ours not theirs
So let me get this straight. They are taking clubs with the biggest followings and making a competition for them just like the UCL. They will be still playing in their respective leagues. Giving them money to develop their squad and infrastructure to improve the football quality, as well as, give money to clubs in their respective leagues. So basically, we will be watching greater quality matches ever week or so? I mean yes these clubs will be making a lot of money but us as fans benefit from this as well. No ? Am I the only person who don't mind this? I think this challenges the powers of those who run the PL and other major league.
They'll have to play more than the odd mid week game when they're black balled from the Premier League
Won’t happen
The football apocalypse has come and florentino perez is the anti chris what is the world of football comeing to!!!!!!!!!!!
Going to cancel my sky subscription if this super league takes off. Man Utd runs through my veins but they are a different monster now and I don't recognise them. The Glazers' indifference to destroying the heart and soul of football is absolutely sickening.
Damn, I was wondering at what point it will happen. Rather sooner I suppose
Sorry this was inevitable and with the pandemic was  accelerated.  Uefa can try to claim “innocence” that they’re not involved. But they have been looking at this proposal for years and are very much involved...  the reality is as Football is the worlds most popular sport the CL should attract more revenues than the NFL and unfortunately they do not... looking at the ratings they have established that when the elite clubs play each other viewings go through the roof, however for the smaller games which we see during the group stages  it just doesn’t happen.   The tipping point for clubs particularly the premiership clubs is the fact that the broadcasting revenue is not distributed in the same manner as it is in Spain where the likes of Liverpool who with the EPL and the CL within 2 seasons still cant compete with Barcelona and Madrid in the transfer market...  The reason being the premiership distributes the TV money in a way that basically mean the Big 4 are subsidizing the league.. domestically it is estimated the 80% of the uk fanatic and casual football fanbase support/ follow Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham.. and it’s those who buy the subscriptions... this is even proven in the ratings where they go through the roof when these clubs play each other...with the global market Tottenham are replaced by Chelsea following their recent success and foreign imports during the mid to late 90s. What is frustrating the owners is that domestic revenue has 50% of the total value split evenly among the the 20 clubs before a ball is kicked. 25% is issued on league placement and the other 25% is issued based on appearances on the TV... The foreign broadcasting revenues 100% is distributed evenly amongst all 20 clubs...  This is not meritocracy as we keep hearing for those who oppose the super league.. this is football socialism where 16 clubs benefit from the global fan based of Utd, Liverpool and Arsenal who should be competing on budgets that eclipse Barcelona and Real Madrid..   This is made worse when the international broadcasting revenue for Laliga is distributed based on club buy outs meaning Barca and Real Madrid secure a substantial amount of revenues as a result..  To show how ridiculous it is - before the recent TV deal came in for the premiership which was the season Aston Villa got relegated. Their bottom placed finish secured earnings considerably more than Bayern Munich and PSG of whom competed in the CL and won all their domestic titles..  So again the arguments being held so regarding meritocracy ... how is it that a club finishing bottom and getting relegated can earn more prize money than clubs who win their respective league and Cup competitions? (With a global fan base I may add)..   It’s like anything in life you don’t get the rewards you feel you deserve ... you’ll seek out an opportunity where you will get a better deal... this proposal was inevitable...
This is bs
This is the day that football died.
The death of the game. It's over for me. Don't know how to support another club can't do that .Glazers own my club . man Utd. It's not our players  it's the owners .Won't be my club if this happens . Using Covid as an excuse to privatise our game .
i hate this really.
I support the European Super league. UEFA and FIFA should stop exploiting the current football world.
Premier League won't kick anyone.
Disgusting people like Platini Latter and infantino already killed football in Europe a long time ago. It's really bad for smaller clubs but it was so already. As long it is against Fifa and Uefa monopoly it's OK.
This was planned years ago was leaked back in 2018 about this European super league starting 2021
As another person said in the comments, When this whole thing goes down, let them start from lowest division
“Unbelievable Jeff “😂
What is this nonsense no one wants this the incident of throwing money on that FIFA oldie was so seems perfect now put that money in your ass
If the super league goes on I will stop supporting chelsea cuz at this point why should we care about them when they don't care about us
What’s happening
UEFA & FIFA are panicking, they have been corrupt and greedy for a long time. The big clubs are the ones because of which they pocket such hefty money. I am not on the side of European Super League, it will make the eagerness to wait for big games, zero; and in essence football boring. But let me clear you UEFA & FIFA are no less of a culprit for the creation of such a ludicrous plan by the clubs who contribute the most to UEFA.
so what happens with Valencia CF, Aston Villa, Marseille, Lazio, Steaua Bucharest, Red Star Belgrade, Spartak Moskow, Birmingham, Fiorentina, etc ?
Any fans ditching their clubs after this - your local League 1, League 2 and Non-League clubs could very much do with your support around now and next season - the higher clubs will survive this, try and support smaller where you can ❤️
champion league is a world class competition because include top 4 in every league
So now European football will have "the split" just like US' Indycar back in 95-08, ok?
It’s gonna go like this. Ban big players from repressing their country at world cups and other things they will leave for clubs in the traditional champions league etc. The super league will then lose its marketability and the clubs will try join the traditional system again. They’ll be left with mid table possibly championship pedigree players
I say the players and managers walk away now, don’t play your upcoming matches until this is sorted
Can we sign a petition to cancel this? If yes, allow me to sign in the name of my whole family.
Arsenal and Tottenham they wanted to escape to a league they could compete in 😂
I enjoyed watching city.... oh well I guess.
Well it was a good ride while it lasted. I can't support this, goodbye Man United.
to increase dramatism some matches will be scripted, but nobody will know
"Our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to the fans' desires"...  I've never seen one football fan ask for a European Super League.
And to think VAR destroyed football, than this.   Both VAR and stupid league to be removed
Huge disgrace for football
The idiots build the world and the smart guys demolish it
EUFAlona Now-alona.  EU FAirplay is just hearsay.  On comes Supervillain league. Bye bye penniless heroes.
Looking forward to European Super league 🥳 What a spectacular tournament it will be !
3.5 billion euros WTF
I have been supporting Liverpool from literally the minute I was born. I am absolutely disgusted. It makes me sad. Ruining the game
All Pl fans lets stop supporting our club , instead support clubs like Leeds, Norwich ,etc
Konami League. Disgraceful!
Master League project
this is awful. it's embarrassing to call myself a Chelsea fan right now. They're letting down us all, both fans and players. Neither get to have a say
might just become a colchester united fan smh
“Super league”  *Arsenal and Tottenham are founding teams* 😐
It's got America written all over it
If i say to you that a fortnite winner gets paid as much as ronaldo salary in a year, would that open your mind why these clubs are after more money? UCl prize winner is 19 million. Just saying...
This new Super League has got these poor fellas out of bed, they must be pissed!
What a disgrace
What a disgrace I've been a liverpool fan since I was 4 I'm 32 now if this happens I will never watch a Liverpool match again
Waysssss boy 💔💔💔💔🤬
this is brexit all over again, and guess how many people still talk about that? no one lol.
Super League is exciting🔥❤️❤️ LETS GO SUPER LEAGUE ‼️‼️‼️
Great idea. If u do not like do not watch it.
Boycott fifa 22
This is  just  awful
Why is everyone bitching soo much. Let teams do what they want. Football clubs are businesses so let them make their money
If Chelsea joins this I’m supporting Brentford i don’t care
this super league wont only take the 15 clubs, they'll also take the rest who will want to compete for those 5 spots, fifa will have next to no power in Europe and will shrivel up in the following years. expect these "founding fathers" to dominate football. if you guys feel this ruins football, i recommend watching South American football, its decent, specially Argentina and Brazil.
We live in a society where....
Disgusted to my Team Barcelona FC i am a shareholder and I will get legal assessment as soon as posible and group up with other shareholders, this must be voted out
Got it, But why arsenal is a big club??
At least my Scottish leauge stays pure but gonna miss the European nights
Guess Arsenal have done me a favour
Sad to see money winning over football.
Nope... not in my name
Football should be for everyone and not only for money
Rest In Peace Football as we know it id guess
Football isnt dead. Football will always be football. But the sad thing is, is that the only thing thats destroying the game is money. You play the game because you love it, not because of the money.
As a Nottingham Forest fan, I am disappointed that we have not been given a seat at the table, we have won more European cups than 5 of those teams. We deserve a chance to be hated as well surely. EDIT: Some people really didn’t get the sarcasm did they? Any forest fan knows we’ve been rubbish the past few years. It’s a joke, wouldn’t want to join the super league even if they asked us.
FC Porto fan in here   We love to beat big teams and sneak into final stages of big competitions  Is not that what football is about?? RIP FOOTBALL RIP FOOTBALL FANS
Daniel levy masterclass, yet again.   Don't qualify for European tournament so make your own
Wait a minute- Utd, Arsenal, and eeerrr Spurs aren’t even in the CL - so how are they big clubs?
Of course sky don’t want this because they would lose the rights to the top six clubs and their sky sports subscriptions would drop like flies! They are as greedy and as corrupt as all of the people they are telling their pundits to attack!
Uefa Cup, Champions League, Super Cup, World Club Cup.....I don't see the big deal with another cup for elite teams......all this whinging is about money and who is going to be out of pocket or who isn't included.   People being outraged for the sake of it. Get over yourself,
Big clubs? More like which clubs bring in the most money.
RIP football (1869-2021) 152 years old.
I'm 25 years old, supported Liverpool from 2005  Today, football has died. If Liverpool will only participate in Super League and no longer in UCL and Premier League, it kills me to say i'm going to have to stop supporting Liverpool. This is a disgraceful decision for the long term..
Tottenham fan here and idk even know how we made it if there talking about big clubs, then yes we are somewhat richer than other clubs but we havent even won a trophy for a decade now i even think Leister deserve to be there than us the whole idea is just outrageous and disgusting
Poor people made football.  The rich have ruined it.  Think about that for 2 seconds.
F*#% STAN KROENKE!!!!! RUINED ARSENAL!!!!!!
These bigger clubs just want more money. You messed up and allowed Americans to bring their greed to Football.
Is FIFA makes this！If they are fair, we don't need to do this！ Fans never know what FIFA do for these teams！！😠
Super league or super money?
Wow! When the rich want their cut the poor bend over. Football's very own Brexit!
Goat vs pessi
Next , super league on weekend and domestic leagues midweek lol ..
This makes me so mad, angry and I feel helpless. Loved the PL so much. Football is culture, history, idendity, togetherness and family and for these crappy owners it's just a business like selling burgers.
LETS GO ! Super league
A football league from which its founding members can never be relegated; the ultimate closed shop.  But these are currently the elite clubs of Europe and likely to remain so, able to attract the world's top players with vast salaries and a guaranteed promise of football every week against Europe's ultimate teams.  Threats of relegation, point deductions, loss of titles or a ban on players competing at international level all ring hollow. UEFA, FIFA and the Premier League are utterly impotent. These clubs' owners care nothing for history or titles, only money. The Premier League without the big six, a World Cup bereft of the very best, or Champions League devoid of the top clubs are all finished.  Capitalism at its worst and the ultimate example of what can happen when businessmen with zero interest in football are allowed free rein to purchase the world's top clubs.
What bothers me more than this so-called super league is the hypocrisy in all the reactions to it. Football is commercialised down to the lower levels, everyone knows how corrupt FIFA, UEFA, the national FA's and the clubs are, and this super league is not really that different from UEFA's new Champions League proposal (which equally sucks because it also includes participation through merit rather than qualification through domestic competitions). Yet everyone's suddenly pretending like all the football clubs, national FA's UEFA etc are charitable organizations. They're not. They're all greedy and only interested in profit. Get a grip.
This is disgusting, football will die
Real vs barca  barca vs city these games are rare so it has lots of value but once we see these game more often we will be bored seeing the same fixture and there won't be any development of new clubs these super league may be stand too long if started also
If all big teams play in same league there will be no big team eventually one big team will be last, probably Spurs😂.
Maybe they have a good reason why they join the super league.
All these teams have moan about fixture congestion in the past years and are willing to add 22 games to their schedule.... How is that good for the players. Let them go I watched man city v Chelsea yesterday terrible football boring game and that was a cup semi final how is that game going down as a league game with nothing on the line zzzzzzzz
Besides obviously money is a crucial factor. Do you think football would exist if it was not entertaining or profitable? Pep G said it perfectly: the best teams typically has the most money to attract the best players. Think about how great it would be to see purely great players competing aside from those who are not really that good. You cannot tell me all teams are created equally because teams become regulated for a reason. Some never to make it back to the champions league. Everyone needs to stop complaining and support football in general.
First of all, this is not good for football which is already spoilt. Secondly even if this goes through, these clubs will pay crazy inflated amounts for transfers. Everyone knows they have money, if they go in for a player, every accepted bid will be excess of 100m
This all started when they took the UCL off itv
This a channel the Wates to charge £15 PPV a game during o pandemic so they can get off their high horse
I wonder why everyone is so bent out of shape about this talking about 'end of football', that's rubbish. This is terrific news!! As long as there is a qualification mechanism in place that allows for other teams to compete then I'm in. More football for me🔥
If I stuck to my principles there’s no way I could support United after 16 years... I guess I will keep my merch and memories of the past alongside the new club I’ll support which will represent what United once was. The spirit of their past will live on, and the torch will be handed down. This is life.
We all remember when the world was laughing at United fans during the Glazer takeover.  USA USA USA they all sang.  Not singing that now.  Boycott the whole thing, and kick these parasite owners out of football.
i wish all fans of ol those big A boycott those super league games.wait no fans allowed in stadiums  🤦‍♂️
Be great if they booted them teams out the prem right now...  Top 4 =  Leicester West ham Everton  Leeds
I find it very hypocritical the way Sky Sports criticise this Super League as straight “greed”. Isn’t Sky the one that wanted to charge us £15 for watching Sheffield v Newcastle Utd? For Sky it’s okay for them to increase their revenue streams but for others it’s a ‘disgrace’? Also, if you’re so against this Super League, I don’t want to see Sky bidding for TV rights for it. Been stealing from us for years, making us pay £40 per month to watch football, thieves, you’re part of this greed too, stop trying to act like you’re innocent.
Richard Masters first off have to sort out VAR and stop trying to control how often a team wins the PL in a row.
Wdy mean people saying football is dead. 70 years of European football through waves of change and through fluctuation led to todays golden age and like wtf 😂😂 stop being a muffin head come on. Remind who s the real money digger like obviously UEFA and FIFA scumbags. Regarding clubs been devoting themselves for the last ten years for their domestic league and UEFA gone too far for greed come on guys Super League was inevitable
Manchester City fan here . Following this club for 10+ years. Never been so proud of my club until now.
Im confuse whats wrong
I do not understand why people are so butt hurt. If you’re truly a fan, you’ll stick with the club. This might be great for the biggest clubs out there. Do not shut down something that has potential. The formation at UEFA and FIFA had to start somewhere. The new Super League might be a necessary next step. If it fails, it fails, but if it works 🤷🏾‍♂️
Dream 11 soccer predicted this
My guy said Manchester city is a founding club 😂 😂
Glad there's no Bayern, respect+++
I dont actually believe that these greedy owners literally talking to sheikh mansour
These owners may of just ruined the careers of some young players dreaming of winning a WC with their country.
Absolute disgrace
Honestly, everyone knows it's an empty threat, the PL and other domestic leagues cannot ban their top teams, they'd lose too much revenue and viewers from that. It's probably best if all involved parties just come together and find a solution that works for everyone (like turning Champions League and Europa League into actual UEFA leagues with qualification through domestic leagues).
bayern psg dortmund not in it which is a positive this league is ruining European football.
I'm  looking forward to it These clubs will fight for a title They won't be able to buy players for clubs outside the League These clubs will be finished in no time And Smaller clubs like west ham , Granada, Atalanta will be fighting for the champions League  A new set of rivalry will be created
VAR and now this football is done.. also why is totenham on that list.
Replacing Europa and Champions League with Super League. They're not leaving their domestic League.
Thank god, I didn’t get a Manchester United tattoo.   Ps: I never thought I would say something like this in my entire life.
Why the hell are Arsenal there! they have only just been in the top half all season!!! I am a Liverpool fan. I'm now an ex fan or Liverpool and football. Absolutely distgusting. The big 6 should be Man. city, Man. Utd, Leicester, West Ham, Chelsea and Liverpool. I hope all these clubs get the biggest sanctions, multi millions fines, relegate them out football league all together.
Just to clarify: Bayern have NOT declined.  Bayern, Leipzig, and Porto are the 3 last clubs to join as founding members.
This will be better then champs league! All top flight clubs! There keeping it competitive! Fantastic stuff!
For those disliking this video, please know that Sky Sports isn't creating the European Super League, they are reporting on the fact that it is happening. So why are you disliking their video which gives us coverage of these unfolding events?
I think its good, probably gonna give more players that normally dont play some game time
If there will be a ban, on World Cup by FIFA or Continental Cup by UEFA, Conmebol, AFC, etc for any players who joins this Super League, IMHO this new competition will keep on running though. With that much of money, they affort to pay the players 3x even 5x of the salary the top players are having right now. Just playin for 4 - 5 seasons and you won't have to worry about money for your grandson. When you have enough, you can quit the League right after and be able to play in the World Cup. So in other words, this Super League is not a big problem from the players point of view actually.
Honestly i hope both parties call each others bluffs and we have absolute chaos just to see how crazy this is going to get.
I'll gladly walk alone and away from this disgraceful Liverpool team football is nothing without fans
Excuse my ignorance. Why is this a big deal and why is it bad?
Fucken hell 😲😯
This won't go ahead.
I am ashamed my club is one of the founders if this starts I'm done with football I just got into watching it and now I'm about to come out we need to stop this guys
With the World Cup being  around the corner , the UEFA would have the upper hand on this fight. This will be CR7 and Messi last World Cup and if they know this can jeopardize their participation on the WC they would not endorse the super league
If Chelsea don't withdraw ,I'll be a Leeds fan  Football is ruined ,what kind of nonsense is that
You can see how the PL became a success, because fans got something - they got to see all the games of the teams they supported.   What do the fans get out of this one?
I’m now a ex Liverpool fan no more of my money will be going to them. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Ok super league but why Tottenham they ain't got no silverware it dont make sense
No more stoke on a Wednesday😂😂😂😂😂
Life was so simple In 2012
Here I am in the United States, years of getting up at 4am-7am on a Saturday or Sunday just to watch my team (Liverpool) play. Liverpool is a town of anti establishment and now home to a team ran by greedy scum. This is a sad day for all fans of the beautiful game.
Financial fair play, was, and is more than ever, dead. Bye.
Kick them all out of the EPL now, give the 3 points to their opponents. If they want to comeback 2nd division with a transfer budget of no more than 500k.
Well goodbye football
Football was ruined 5 years ago. And now the nails are being driven in the coffin.
This will disrupt the football world.... We all know what happened to cricket with the introduction of IPL...Similar situation here...Money talks.... No one can stop this move by big clubs...This will happen and this will become new normal and this tournament will attract fans globally money will pour into it...As simple as that...Traditional football lovers may not accept it...I belong to that grp so it's a blow for me..So sad..
Yeah this is about money lol
I’m Manchester United fan but if this happen I will never support football again
FFS arsenal i thought our club has some class and history what a fkn joke .
they shouldn't banned UCL UEL and shouldn't creat european super league too.  it's my opinion what do u guys think?
There should be resistance,  fans >>> money. Coaches and players should resign. Fans should boycott. And as a last sort These clubs should be banned from competing.
Liverpool fans should just support Everton or Tranmere or Marine
First boxing now football RIP
So it's just another competition, right? I'm just a little confused about how this will ruin Football and how Football is now "dead" and how does this correlate/ linked with Arabs and money??? Idk too much about this, I tried to do some research but I am still having trouble understanding it and what does it have to do with FIFA and UEFA, and why are they issuing bans? Very confused, can someone explain Please, Thank You :)
What a way to destroy football as we know it, absolutely disgusting money grabbers. As a lifelong Liverpool fan I’ve never felt so ashamed of the club in all my life. Ruined football.
Liverpool fan since birth feels their first hesitation or doubt of allegiance...groundbreakingly sad  -April 18 2021
Shameful
Why are the Americanizing football? Bollocks!
Either way the rating gonna be high
Money money money , complete farce this is a joke as if they dont get enough money as it is !!!!!!!
It's even get more ridiculous that rivalry fans like Liverpool MU, Barca Real Madrid, etc agreed on the same terms ( disappointment, disgraceful, and many things)
Football was created by the poor and it's stolen by the rich our beautiful game is gonna be ruined even more by  money ' money money money '  💵💰 The owners just don't care about the fans or the players all they care about is Money 👿💰
Fifa doesn’t own any club so it’s normal for them to disagree with them cause of the amount of money they are going to lose
I am no longer a Chelsea fan, I now support my local club Sutton United.
This just shows how the world has changed. Ppl are all selfish creatures that are divided by money
I never thought liverpool will do this I don't know about other clubs but liverpool people's club 😶😶😶😶 I have no hope left for humanity now ...😞😞
At least they standing up against uefa
I will watch super league here u come 💪💪💪💪 ufea for little there not helping any club pushing great club on their knees.
It's a horrible idea. But most of us would watch the games. If you watched the 90 minutes of Crystal Palace v. Newcastle, and Southampton v. Aston Villa, then you can tell me I'm wrong.
If they still play in their national leagues then why is this so bad?
I don't see why people are so opposed to it? Would it not be cool to see the top European clubs to compete every week?
Fifa is going to have an emergency meeting to prevent such an event from occurring because this is bs. Hopefully it is stopped.
F*ck arsenal
If this happen NBA will takeover Football 💔
It's a DREAM LEAGUE there's no better form for football to take
Whys everyone so shocked ? It's always been about money this isn't breaking news ... the world including sport is being dictated by wealth and greed .. this is the clear example ... rant all you want it will happen because money talks
9 points clear at the top, first league title in a decade and I'm still gutted, I don't know if I even want to watch the rest of the season...
Why are Arsenal one of the big 6 clubs..Judging by league positions as of late I think Leicester City have taken that 6th spot!
We LOVE IT ❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What happens to the champions league next season?
When clubs suddenly realize that champions league glory is not guaranteed in spite of spending astronomical sums, when the economic situation is bad, and clubs are poorly run, this is what happens. The powers that be only want more money and do not care for the fans, passion or even their own players. Incidentally, it is the fans and players who should have the biggest say in the matter. What a bunch of pig-headed characters!
Its gonna be fun🎉
So arnt the top clubs just playing in Europe like they usually do !?
I want to hear arsene Wenger on this
Why Tottenham and Arsenal but not Porto? Or Ajax? Or Sevilla? Or Napoli? Or Roma?
Can someone explain what's going on? Why is everyone so mad?
Why not just have premier league XI vs la liga XI  Also the french league vs German league etc
I don't understand why people don't want this is it more fun to watch weak teams vs other week teams and weak teams vs big teams or big teams vs big teams yes it's unfair for the poor clubs but let's be real we will enjoy watching the games well at least I will
Debating whether to change alligence
So there still playing in the prem just not part of the champions league and europa?
This is the stupidest idea that I  ever heard from those owners
Just like that
Liverpool supporter here..if they are supporting this then I'm going to be actually disappointed with them as if they are not making enough money already..this calls for a Boycott of all major teams in the Premier League
Guys it's technically the NBA of soccer now, I kinda like it... Now this league is gonna have the best players in the world, how cool is that!
My kids in the future: "Messi and Ronaldo are overrated they didn't so it in the Super League" 😔
This is gonna be lit. It’s an amazing business decision and it’s gonna make hella bank. Fans want to see the best vs best. No one wants to watch Munich win Bundesliga every season or Liverpool destroy Brighton.
Luckily if it does go ahead English fans know exactly how to get their clubs banned from Europe
Conspiracy theory from Uefa am disappointed in the participating clubs
A great chance to get involved with FC United of Manchester,
Anyone feel like this is a bluff power move so these clubs have a guaranteed spot in the new CL format and for a larger share off the CL money
A Manchester United fan all my life,if my club goes away from PL to this , i will quit watching
rip footbal 2021
This makes no sense, clearly no one wants it, the teams risk being kicked out of other competitions, managers already complain about fixture congestion all season long. Can’t see how this would go through as is.
I’m done supporting Man City
Is this that bad an idea though. Lets be real, who wants to watch barcelona vs cadiz or man city vs plymouth fc? The big clubs have no obligation to carry the little clubs. UEFA are the once causing trouble, they are the ones that are threatening eviction of the big clubs from their leagues. If you read the press release, the super league is played alongside everything else. This is just business and capitalism at work
This is why clubs need to be majority owned by the fans. Disgusting
For my sanity  I disassociate myself from Manchester City  This is truly saddening to see German national team every 2 years for me  Die Mannschaft forever
Glazers out
As a Barcelona fan since 6 years of old I feel this is a disgrace for every football fan. Football was all about passion , not money.
It’s like a nightmare... Why would destroy the thing we love the most.
Its not a league standalone. It's a mid week competition cause of what is happening with the CLs
Rich clubs playing against rich clubs... yeah i foresee their tv deals are gonna be "cheap" hahaha...  good luck with the players in those clubs not playing in any UEFA & FIFA competitions like the World Cup or getting any ballor d'or Also huge irony when Liverpool complained about the huge amount of fixtures but now decided to join another league on top of bpl
Boycott these clubs and these owners are nothing but greedy corrupt liars and they betrayed the fans, they can sugar coat it anyway they want but this is just share greed by globalist elites the worst kind of people to walk the earth
Even Johan Cruyff wouldn't agree with this new project. Football is not play for money but it play for passion.
Still haven't seen a single person who is a fan of this idea... If this is really about money, who is going to provide it???
Can sumbdy explain please
Is this that bad an idea though. Lets be real, who wants to watch barcelona vs cadiz or man city vs plymouth fc? The big clubs have no obligation to carry the little clubs. UEFA are the once causing trouble, they are the ones that are threatening eviction of the big clubs from their leagues. If you read the press release, the super league is played alongside everything else. This is just business and capitalism at work
No Chelsea 😭
What's the problem then
I wish the owners would not try and lie and dress it up. They are not helping football, they are not balancing football, they are not increasing finances for anyone but they themselves . They don't even understand football. It would be better if they just said 'we don't see this is a a sport but a way to make money, we are greedy, scummy bastards and will do anything to get more cash'. At least that way they would be being honest.
You lot will all end up watching the super league lol 😆
Everyone is now going to support their local club, I’m a man united fan and now I can no longer support them after this
I hope it fails and they have to restart at the bottom of the pyramid
As an Arsenal fan, what this means is £3.5b investment into these original teams. That's £291m Stan Kroenke will receive and he will not invest one cent... He will put that straight into his back pocket
Let's call it for what it is: American capitals try to ruin the old structure of euro football so they can gain full control of the sport. UEFA is a corrupted org does a lot of bad things, however they do a lot of good too, lesser of the two evils.
Now arsenal will be the new burnley 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
I actually wouldn't mind a Super League. The game has always been about money anyway - Man city are the living proof of it. Don't kid yourself thinking that your club cared about you before the news came out today. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE MONEY.
Can someone explain to me why this is such a bad idea? Clearly there must be benefits to it but all I'm seeing is people jumping on the bandwagon and saying its terrible... if sky had the broadcasting deal for ESL I'm sure their pundits would be backing it.
these clubs think that all 4 Billion football fans support one of the clubs in the super league. Its a disgrace
Looking forward to it!
Lol why are we surprised. Imagine Kroenke or Levy hearing 3.5bn for the founding clubs
April 18th 2021 - The day the Champions League died.
If Joe public signs up for this forget it
Why are people annoying by it exactly. Do you think they no longer play domesticly?
As a Norwich fan, it's such a horrible dicision
Please someone tell me , why it is bad if a new league is started. I am confused
Perez has the audacity to say that trash. He's an a**hole.
They gonna do this for more money so how abt all the fans end up not watching it
Hope some of the players say something about this, Gary gunna be pissed
Liverpool are a disgrace not a single fu## given about there fans, same with all the other clubs who want to be a part of it!! Get rid of the greedy owners and replace them!!
*UEFA is like EA wtf!*
Guess we will have to combine the scottish and english league to try survive.
Liverpool joining hurt me the most😓
Well at some point something of this magnitude had to happen. That is if u late people who don’t care about football take ownership of futbol clubs. Billionaires are poachers, they wanna stay at the top of the food chain, and no matter what it takes they are willing to go that extra mile. I we can all whip and mourn but they have the big guns. They know people don’t care for champions or other leagues not because of how fair it it is, but because of their big clubs they have grown supporting. They know people tune into Europa only because man United and Arsenal are in it. People don’t have arch serie a only because of the top players in the top clubs in Italy. Honestly I stopped supporting Real Madrid when cristiano left. So these guys who are orchestrating this super league know all these finicky details and are basing their monetary decisions on that. Fight them or work with them .
Sad times
am i the only one who isn’t totally opposed to the idea of this..
I'm 54 and used to follow city at Maine rd all the time and havnt been to a game for a good many yrs cos football was about Saturday's 3pm and i could see were it was leading when football sold its soul to sky. I will never support Manchester city in a European league, we were city long b4 we had any supporters from overseas they all came from Manchester. Start again city i want to watch  city against west ham,Aston villa and the rest couldn't give a stuff for real Madrid it's only the beginning eventually games will b sold to the highest bidder to host your club it will cease to have connection to Manchester
Oh great so a more predictable and boring Champions League with the same teams every year. Completely plastic, unexciting and offers no real heritage or excitement.  Utter trash. Reduces domestic rivalries to nothing.
Three words
stop blaming Americans!! I'm american and would not support this! Greed has also ruined our sports.
Can someone explain to me the reason why the fans of the participating clubs are angry? You get to watch the best fixtures of each league every single week.
GREAT IDEA BELIEVE ME ITS THE FUTURE OF FOOTBALL.
Why is tottenham there?
You had me till you said Tottenham fc
cry me a river.
I'm an Everton fan and as much as I dislike Liverpool and the other teams involved in this Super league shite. It wouldn't be the same without them. I feel for the fans involved in this crap. What's your thoughts if you support any of the top 6
What do people have against this lol ?
I have been a Juventus fan for 11 years... I think being a torino fan will be a good choice...Sorry Juve...storie di un grande amore ends here.
The Super League will succeed in getting in more seats at the Super Bowl. And the Super Bowl is an entirely different sport compared to the Champions League. Football is supposed to be the beautiful game, not the money game. It was a voice for the poor English when it was invented, and now it's being ruined by corporations. These 12 clubs should be ashamed.
I’ve never been so happy my club wasn’t winning titles, because I’d be heartbroken to have my club betray me so badly. I feel for football but god I feel for big 6 fans
Ban all those founding teams from all English competitions and European competitions
Trying to create completely new sport with rule similar to football is better... There has never been a serious commercial attempt to do so...  The reason is that football is also needed to be challenged... being #1 in the world is good, but strong challenger will even make the game better,, And now basketball as world #2 just can't do it as the game itself is not as simple as football...
All of them should be relegated from their domestic leagues... coming from an ashamed Spurs fan...
Prem will become the farmers league
Bitterly disappointed in Liverpool.
Glad to hear that most people are against this idea, I know those that are planning it dont care, but.......you have lost this football fan forever. The real issue however is the 6 billion dollar debt currency loan from international desperate shadster Jaimie Diamond and the vile organization known as JP Morgan Chase. Which is actually a room full of ancient corpses stuck in purgatory but that have found ways of possesing and controlling this living realm. This is such a pathetic desperate cash grab by whoever stands to benefit, literally the losers at the top of these 12 clubs are making a power play to ensure their lives of never ending indulgence and luxury could never come to a hault, and guess who they are sure will be the suckers to pay the debt?????? You, and me of course. So if you have a soul and love the game, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS, it has nothing to do with football and everything to do with permanantly lining the pockets of a handful of bloated slime.
Uefa please get a spine and stand up to this mega rich lot stop this !
No way I will be following this garbage  if it happens
Football is ruined forever. Anyone got any other sports they can recommend?
30 years a United fan. I feel empty.
And when every week is super, nothing will be...
Boycott now
How have arsenal and spurs swindled there way into this.  Seems like this was spurs only way of keeping Harry Kane at the club and Barca’s only way of keeping Messi 🤔
You guyzz need chill. I feel this is like a bargaining chip which will be used against UEFA. If they go ahead and ban players from national duty it's going to stop them from playing in WC. The same WC which needs to be boycotted for being built on death of thousands of poor people. Now either boycott the fifa WC or this. Because all the top players from these clubs they wouldn't dare to ban them. If they ban them the Qatar  royal Kings will be coming with the whip to the UEFA officials. Again I am not trying to say this is perfect but WC needs to be boycotted anyway possible.
Give them an ultimatum, join the super league and get banned for life! I'll support Salford United
I don’t think it’s as bad as it looks. I could care less about small teams that park the bus. I want to see Bayern VS PSG. I want regular attacking football.
Get this American Soccer League away from me!
I was raised an Arsenal fan and have supported the club religiously since a young age. I've been to more games than I can even count, home and away. I've never been ashamed of my club as I am now.  I would have stuck with Arsenal through anything that happened on the pitch - we could've been relegated to League Two and I still would have been there, going to games. This is different. It's a total betrayal of the fans. This isn't the club I fell in love with. Where are our values now?  I'll be cancelling my membership if this goes ahead. Enough is enough.
No european super League from Inter of Milan supporter
Let’s see how will this go but I’m still a little upset with this
Just like YT boxing, it's happened to football. Two of my favourite sports:(
RIP Manchester United. Always had retarded owners and this just ices the cake
This has been a long time coming.  The money has officially taken over the entire sport. And nothing will stop it. Even if by some miracle it doesn’t happen now, it’s inevitable.
The ESL is an absolute disgrace to the beautiful game, placing profits over what the sport really should be about, passion. We need to boycott every traitorous club that decided to join it, as should we boycott the league in itself. This is a sad day for football, a very sad day indeed, I would argue, the saddest day in the history of the sport.
Aight.. that's it.. I'm supporting Burnley
Let's be honest, this was going to happen anyways, the pandemic has only accelerated it, a more american style of top unmovable teams format is more marketable
Lovely to see how people react to changes....
I think it’s going to be good 🤷🏻‍♂️
„to respond to their desires“ wtf ?
Hope this ain't gonna end football
This will be 🔥
This is kinda weird
Just greedy people wanting money
Ffp rules is the main reason
Get that guy an iPad ffs
😐
Uefa champions did the same thing.... Only difference Clubs took the power to their hands
As a Tottenham fan of nearly 40 years all I feel is numbness. You hope against hope for years your team will at last win something on its merits. But this? Spurs haven't earned this, not that it's worth joining anyway because it's a total betrayal. We were spoilt by the original Premier League cash grab. We were spoilt again by the Champions League being open to non-Champions. But this is far worse. It will ruin Spurs for all time. I've admired Leicester for a long time. Time to change allegiances? Feels like the best move now, in the immediate wake of this travesty. These 12 clubs deserve to lose everything, each one of them, and I hope they do.
As a Liverpool fan I have never felt so betrayed
All the leagues will be competitive and will get boosted money wise from new sponsorship deals
The Premiere League doesn't have the balls to follow through with their threat of banning the Big 6 from domestic competition.
WTF IS GOING ON I CANT BELIEVE THIS...PISS OOOOOFFFFF!?!?!!!
Any real football fans would boycott these games and teams when fans are aloud back in this will kill football scumbags the lot of them !!
Uefa and fifa full of crap and now this...... 🤢 🤢 🤢
This is just exciting. 😁😅 I mean, just imagine, we're gonna have to watch big games week in, week out! I like this one.
I really don’t understand why people are up in arms over this. Isn’t this the same way the Premier League was formed when clubs broke away from the FA’s old 1st Division? UEFA is scared they will lose control and money. They’re profiting heavily from these clubs and the clubs have had enough. This so called “closed league” model works just fine in the NBA for example. How are fans being disenfranchised though?
Think deeper into the situation it will build up leagues all over the world
So proud that my brave Scunthorpe United have rejected joining this league
I love Barcelona with all of my heart but what there doing is absolutely appalling. I’m disgusted and embarrassed to be a Barcelona fan. Never would I have imagined that my club would put profit and money over there supporters.
I think its a great idea
I pray to God that this stupid idea fails and when it does, these teams should not be allowed back in the leagues along with the players who signed off on it no matter how low they start. What a disaster
get the hands off my football !
One thing realy excited about this league, all big club around europe will be battle with league format not cup, so you can see where your favorite club will stand if they on the same league
RIP FOOTBALL 1836 - 2021
Football is finished, I am so sad to hear about this....
So it’s really happening huh I actually can’t believe it
All clubs in the Superleague are no more clubs anymore... Trash clubs
Sky sports....this is out of order... New league... sky sports TV rights... Sky sports.... what a league.
Why they had to ruin the game? Greed so much greed
Personally I think football as we know it should end once Ronaldo and Messi retire
I thought the teams would get a share of 3.5 billion. Not that they would each get that amount. Either way I'm disgusted.
I have no Interest in this
Arsenal and Spurs two trash teams are in the super league SMH what a disgrace
Read thru the comments, I dont understand the negatives to this. Being a football fan I wanna see more football across borders being played. Plus o see the clubs taking back control rather than the Scum corrupt FIFA Founders.  This could be a good thing, but again I dont understand y it's such a bad thing.
I bet behind the scenes sky are thinking how much can we charge for this new league..
Sky Sports News: "This poses an existential threat to football as we know it". 0:06  What nonsense.  When will media outlets report on the news rather than making ludicrous statements.
This is awesome as a football fan I'm so excited about the super league,  all they doing is replacing the water down championship league to a real champions only the top 5 leagues should be in the champions league anyways.
3.5 billion to "elite founding clubs" during an economic crisis.. absolutely shameful.
I GET that international fans want to be able to get access to their clubs. But does that mean you then rip it out of the souls of the local FANS who love these clubs dearly😥
it’s a sad day
Can someone please explain what the big problem is, and why these teams want to do this? I mean it seems like a good idea.
UEFA has themselves to thank with creating the monster of UCL 😤
I like it. Need to do something against fifa and uefa corruption
What I know they are not stupid to make such a decision (12)they must be  having a reason as to why  they accepted we just still need a little understand
Knowone is going to watch the prem anymore fr
Fair play Bayern and PSG! The fans are with you.......  This is a pathetic attempt of a moneygrab.  It'll burn out before Guy fawkes does!
Horrible news but great to see the true fans of football are against this unfair so called Super league
Look at all these uefa and fifa shills!
Glazers vice. Ffs  Doesn’t look like Utd will turn around.
Time to take off my Man United kits and support West Ham, Lord Lingardinho 🔥
They have been talking about this for a long time now, thought it was all jokes/compromising but now real. If they start the super league for the big clubs they should also start a non-super league for the smaller n relegated clubs cause this is BS I think it’s April fools guys, no form of regulation and I hope FIFA/UEFA don’t support. look at the $$$$ involved
Arsenal supporter and all i can say is..............Pricks!
Dream League Soccer, lol.
If they're gonna do it, then psg, bayern and dortmund should join them.
Oh Jesus if this is run by American money they wont have draws they will make the goals bigger and have no offside.
Galatasaray ?
What the hell is this?
Not sky sports 🤣🤣 talking about Greed
So am I to understand that these teams may not be participating in their respective league games against league opponents therefore would they still be participating in the champions league or with these teams not be in the champions league?
I have so much Hate inside me right now.😡😡😡
Chuck them out and dont let them back it wont work, no competition, boring games no one wants to see the same thing all the time
BOYCOTT
Don’t watch it
Sunday 18th April 2021    remember the date   The day that football died
Big name clubs started this Super League so how can it be bad, they probably did it for a reason it's a battle rich vs. rich and I could care less. ✌️✌️
No one believe am going to make it through bainay options trading platform I join but today am really enjoying it all thanks to Mr Romel lota for his good work in my life,you can ask me how for more info
football is dead thanks for killing a game the world has loved for over 100 years
What a load of bull
FENERBAHÇE
Am I the only one who does not have a problem with this? It’s not like FIFA and UEFA are saints anyway 🤷🏽‍♂️ If this generates more revenue for the clubs involved to improve their teams then I’m all for it.
Big six of the Prem is gonna consist of Sheffield and Villa ........but West Ham is gonna rule the league now lol.
Bayern and psg!!!! They show that football is not for making money❤️❤️❤️
Spurs? How embarrassing.
The only way this changes... if the fans of the clubs DO NOT BUY TICKETS, APPAREL, or anything else sold by the clubs. Clearly money talks; this is how fans have a say.
Wenger in 2009: ‘Maybe in 10 years, you will have a European league…the money that will be coming in from the Champions League will not be enough for some clubs’   Wenger in 2018: ‘It is inevitable…to share money between the big clubs and the small clubs will become a problem’
I’m done with football   Fu<k them
If all those players who will participate in the Super League won't be able to play for their national teams, won't it make them less attracted to play for those 12 clubs?
2025 Champions league finals. Eibar VS Crotone . R.I.P Football
Meh. Brighton and Hove Albion are the future of european football anyway.
I wanna see Messi, Ronaldo, Rashford, Mbappe and Lewandowsi in one league week in week out the super league is the new world order for football
And I thought VAR was ruining football this is absolutely disgusting. Worst news I’ve ever heard feel hurt my club would be a part of this, hope 90% of these ‘big 6 clubs’ fans do the right thing and boycott their team. No matter who you support we are all fans and I love my club but I love football more.
Nowadays it's not for the passion it's for the money 😭🥺😓
an absolute disgrace, been supporting united for almost 9 years, been watching football since i was 5, considering abandoning this club and everything about this European Super League.
more reason for ronaldo and messi to leave their clubs
This is a tricky decision, Something isn't right.. UEFA prize money is too small maybe ?? because 12 of the biggest clubs doing the same thing isn't to be underestimated espicially when all of them are facing serious financial problems
5:10 it's all about money folks
I hot the mod this was being planned 10+ years ago.. Told the person he was daft..he replied..wait its gonna happen...so said so done
Sky Sports pack cancelled   BT Sports cancelled   The day football died for me 🖕
anyone else want to wreck the glazers house
UEFA didn't protect big club players from overwork First the stupid nations league and now more UCL games? So many players have already been suffering from injuries this season English FA and lower teams not letting 5 sub changes, didn't give sheet about big clubs yet they take advantage from sharing fee This is what you deserve. Its time for big clubs to say what they want. It's not the end of football. This is a historical moment
Yea no more Cadiz beating Barca or Madrid, no more lost titles because Juventus drew at Udinese on last day of the season, no more giant killers in FA Cup. No more promotion celebrations after 20 years being stuck in lower division, no more meaning to the beautiful game. Football is becoming f u give me money. Football passed us by, if this is what kids wanna watch this super league let them have it I and many more wont.
Pathetic.
Let’s see how long this league will last when fans of these clubs boycott them. Cause as far as I’ve seen, this league got a universal thumbs down.
i think football will be better with this league all u guys a to do is listen to the players that are playing now and not just x players
This sounds amazing. All for it!
I dont think it is a bad idea but one of the things that makes the big games so crazy is they rare. I'd love to see it. Something fresh! High quality soccer every week.
They are just replacing champions league to the super league . I dont know why people are so mad. They will still compete in local league. This is inevitable and will happen sooner or later so we might as well get on board. Football has always evolved . Premier league part way from FA . Champions league changed format so it is part of evolution
I don't understand why people are so against this? Personally, I would really enjoy watching these teams play against each other every week. Apart from the format and the rule that founding teams can't be relegated, I completely support this idea (granted that the teams continue to play in their respective domestic leagues).
The day football died. 😢😢
UEFA doesn’t want to lose the Champions League money.
Sky Sports pack cancelled   The day football died for me 🖕
So I'm the only one in the comment section that actually thinks this would be fun to watch? I'm a Lille supporter and I see no problem with all the mega clubs in their own league. No more PSG 😂. Most of the supporters of those clubs are global anyway. There are more Barça fans outside Spain. Why not have an international super league that brings those clubs together on a weekly basis and globally with potential fixtures in China, America, Middle East, etc?
just support huddersfield with me boys
We hate the SUPER LEAGUE, Disgrace!!!
I'm lost for words 😕
let them send threats full steam ahead
Am I the only one cheering for this??
Reading news on the news channel
Leicester deserves to be there and would probably compete more compared to Arsenal
I'm considering not watching football anymore.
Kick them out of their domestic leagues!!! Let them play amongst themselves!!!! This will destroy grass   roots football.  Call it what it is..... GREED. No, no no !!!!! Ban them from all domestic football.  How dare they  destroy our dreams.  GREED, GREED,  GREED.  This is NOT right!!!!!
i love it big and bold, i rate this because these clubs are standing up n not backing down
People saying it's all about money. Football has been about money for years and always will be. Both UEFA and FIFA have shown their hypocrisy by condemning it.
We should not watch this league at all.
Sick this is sickening.
I feel sorry for the players...The stress they are going to go through will be massive. Imagine a club playing this new league, Champions league, epl , FA cup, Internationals...
Mate its 310 Million not 3.5 billiion
Regardless of who you are, where you come from, which team you support we need to unite as fans and stop this and save our sport
Relegate them all to their respective last professional leagues. Make the climb up. No UCL and no EL. If fans do return, no fans for them. Absolutely disgusting.   I've been a Chelsea fan since I was 6 years old but this... this is so wrong. Mr. Abramovich you should be ashamed of yourself. I apologise to all affected by this decision on the behalf of Chelsea fans.    A sad day for football.
We as fans should abandon these clubs en masse. Every non-local fan of any of these clubs should go support their local team. Just buy a shirt, go to a couple of matches and the transition shouldn't be too painful.  I've been a Man Utd fan for 30 years, from Birmingham, I buy the kit, go to a game at least twice a season, but if this goes ahead, i'll be wearing claret and blue next season.
I actually feel like crying
The real scandal here is that arsenal weasled its way into it and tricked the higher ups that it is one of the elite clubs
Football is dead
Spurs scrape europa by Chelsea beating wolves and suddenly they wanna play in the super league 😂😂😂😂😂 lol
Well, PSG just won the champions league
I mean it's not a bad idea
Always been a red.. Liverpool has always been a fan based club.. What happened 😔.. Taking a decision that is completely against us..
Who knows what may happen might be a madness lol
What a disgraceful move! You can't be serious if they go through with this  This would destroy football in general
Stop saying ‘well done Bayern’ they bully German clubs taking their best players for peanuts . They look after their fans but certainly do not care about the rest of German football! Plus they’ll join anyways
How is arsenal apart of this they shouldn't be in it they cant even beat a few Europa teams
What is Tottenham doing in there 😂😂😂😂
to tell the truth those teams in one league  the level of football is mad mad  will be lovely to see  but that doesn't mean to get out actual league completely
FFS !
"Whatever lets me skip fighting for top four I will bend over for". -Tottenham and Arsenal 2021
I’ve only been a football fan for about 4 years now. Crazy how it’s changes now.
So it's legit ? More corruption in the game then...
Not watching that shite.  I can't believe the owners think fans want this imitation USA Superbowl bollocks
Ridiculous! You can’t just put yourselves above others! Stupid!
Beat Watford and West Brom and then we can talk about a super league 🤣🤣🤣 jokers
Juve and Real gonna have a ref bidding war
Its about time this happened. Slap it up fifa and UEFA they are corrupt money grabbers they have stroked everyone for years
Theres 20 teams in the league with the bottom 5 qualifying based on their regional domestic performance. So there is essentially a relegation?
WTF!
Good luck to these clubs. Uefa is corrupt and not fit for purpose. Its record on tackling racism among fans and players in its competitions is abysmal. Also why on earth are sides from duff leagues like luxembourg and faroe islands allowed to have places in the champions league when top sides from countries like england and spain miss out.
How did arsenal get into this?
Fifa 22 is gonna be dodgy. 😳
Shows how corrupt football really is.. Fifa could put a stop to this immediately by announcing that footballers who are involved In this lose the right to represent their county and participate in the fifa world cup then you'd see how quickly it fail but it won't happen because this has been an enivitable scenario considering the financial rewards at stake
It's a shame....greed and selfishness is about to ruin football for ever..🤑🤑🤑🤑
i dont want this because i just know arsenal will finish rock bottom
I'm not shocked that the club I support is in this, I'm just shocked that it is considered a top club 🤣, Spurs fan here.
As an arsenal fan, i am absolutely disgusted. There is not a chance in hell i will carry on supporting arsenal after this. It's absolutely disgusting and will ruin the game entirely. The clubs left out of this will struggle dramatically. The clubs who have founded this super 'joke' league should be ashamed of themselves and if the league is not to go ahead should be punished massively. It completely baffles me how clubs are just looking for money instead of the welfare of the game and its fans. Greedy!
All the people on the comment section are on suicide watch 😂😂
[ASHAMED]                    Fans are more                    Important than                           money!                   Ruining the game
🤑💴💵💶💷💸
The way we can destroy the super League is simply by not watching none of the matches or investing our money into the team. Without the people's money, this league will die. Do not support this league, don't vote by investing your dollars into the teams.
Been wearing a Liverpool kit since I just learned how to walk and now I’m coming to a point I never thought I would come to, the consideration of supporting another club
without the big 6 there is no premier league so the premier league will do nothing.
Guess I’m going to support Crystal Palace now
Lol I am a Tottenham fan but why they and Arsenal in that list 😂😂
Goddammit United.
I don't get what the problem is..  The biggest and richest clubs in football want to start their own league so that they can make even more money. Makes sense. Right? Besides everyone knows how corrupt Fifa are anyway. 🙄
The fans are gonna turn on them soooo fast and they're gonna backpedal sooo fast and it'll turn into an ugly blemish on their character and finances so quick and the managing individuals will be forced to resign so nicely.
Let's be honest once this competition is started, most of the stadium will be empty even if the fans are allowed to be back at the stadium 😭 As a United fans, it was a heartbreaking news especially we are doing really well on UEL right now 😔
Can someone explain to me why they think this is killing Football? I really can't see what is wrong with it.
Football is done every football fans who supported thse clubs are devastated to hear this 😞😞😞😞😞
Big clubs such as Bayern and Borrusia saying no to this nonsense is what fans want to see, now it’s just upto the players to stand against this.
How can they even think this is a good idea, it’s going to ruin the game and all leagues as competitions
Sky will negotiate tv rights and suddenly Sky sports news will have no issues with it all.
Gud
Arsenal just want to rid themselves  of the constant terrible refereeing by the horrible mafia that the English FA are running
Liverpool lowkey just said to fans "you will walk alone"
Only clubs that need this realistically is Barca and Ac Milan. For the fans of these clubs they should know why that money will be useful
Isn't the champions league enough?????  Ridiculous decision.
Footballs just become all about the money, the soul of football is being snatched away by using some weird American format, it’s a disgrace! The Top 6 clubs in the prem league should be boycotted!
The end
Let's face it we'll all still watch our clubs,
Anybody got a new team I can support
Rip football.
The Knee Benders 🤣😭
Chelsea fan here... Dreadful...amend the laws of the game, relegate them and cut their spending (transfer ban for 20 years), and remove them next 5 years from domestic competitions and European ones. It will definitely help football at all levels
Football is dead, time to support the likes of Leicester and West Ham in their quest for top 4
support your local team
Proud to announce I will be supporting Brighton if Liverpool join
this is going to be a disaster but when you look at it’s the perfect opportunity for people to realize what footballs really about don’t just support bigger teams because they win it’s about the spirit of the game and that spirit is still there in local clubs and now after everyone has snubbed them they are getting angry because of the super league this is your chance to support your local clubs
I supported Arsenal for more than 20 years, I will find another club to support if they go through with this!
Is this all down to uefa trying to change the UCL FORMAT
Good for arsenal coz that's the only way we, the fans, can enjoy european football 😅
Greed greed greed let them go. 12 super teams someone will finish bottom. Good luck getting glory hunters to support a team that finish bottom for a couple of seasons. Rest of the clubs should boycott playing these teams and refuse to sell players to them.
I thought I'd never see the day of thinking about switching my club! The game we love is dead
Well this is the beginning of the end for football. End times are here in all aspects of our lives
As an American who just started getting into watching football, this is a  disgrace to this beautiful game. For the first time in a few years I feel like watching only mls again.
No tv channel should show this games.This will put end to this garbage and their  greed quickly.
Anyone else think Spurs only joined to try win a trophy
My Respect to the german teams when I saw that none of them are going to support this📈
Why everyone so upset
I am ashamed to be a Liverpool fan , a club built on tradition and there fans and they give that away for 3.5b. Apparently loyalty does have a price
The players of all these teams have to do something there is no way a group of silly rich men can gather together and keep all the money in their own exclusive pot, this isn’t politics or banking JP Morgan is the route of most evil and behind this poison
UEFA, FIFA and the rest will all cave in, albeit with their palms wide open accepting untold billions (bribes) for their co-operation. their all a bunch of useless money grubbing soulless cowards.
Look likes we're not going to see many legends in fifa 2022
Great for football
im a casual. why does everybody dislike this
The world greatest Club FC Bayern Munich rejected the offer !
Glazers don't care about United one bit🙄
Basically 15 clubs trying to dictate and control football as a united fan I think it’s pathetic and a money grab. Fan should boycott there respective clubs because we don’t want a USA NFL style league where it’s a exclusive rich boy club with
I have started a petition to boycott the SuperLeague on my insta account. The account is called @boycotthesuperleague
Big 6 fans come to Luton we will welcome you😂
As a city fan.. this is disgraceful. No matter what team we support right now, we all have come togeher to realise this is disgusting.
Any northerners looking for a new red team to support, Middlesbrough is a great club that actually cares about our fans
When they loose fans they will realise their greed has blindsighted them.
relegate them all, and I thought Mike Ashley was a bad director
Ahh.. America, you People just can’t leave it can you...
I can see a player costing a billion Euros in the near future .
Luckily my backup team is Wolves so I'll sail on with Wolves.
will those teams be able to buy their players from the normal leagues ? if the leagues boyott the superleague will they also not allow them to buy from their leagues
The beautiful game lost
The fans need to found new clubs to replace leaving teams. AFC Wimbledon are a great example of what can be achieved.
This will be the start of ww3
I have to say that what I am hearing is completely bizarre and lacks any semblance of logic and reason - how the hell are Spurs involved??
Football never was about money. It was all about passion. 💔
Im so lucky to support a club that doesnt want to be in this league, but i send my deepest condolences to all the fans that are being mistreated by their clubs.
Liverpool are vile
It wont happen
Stripe all of them of their Honours and refuse them entry back in when this new shite show of a league fails.
Why is Tottenham, when is the last time they won a league title
It’s really sad but the douchebags in Uefa and fifa have also brought it on themselves
Worse case scenario is the super league pay off UEFA & the FA to allow teams to compete and give a % of money every season from the 6 premier league teams.
Excellent idea. About time. Lets get this European Super League started!!
Ok maybe it's time to quit watching football and become fully invested in mma
After supporting this club my whole life I can't believe what we have done, never have I considering supporting another club
I don't think who invented the football meant it to go this way 😔 shameful !!! The football that made most people love the game is gone a long ago, unfortunately this is just the way all in the world is heading to !!
“We’re going to support the wider football pyramid” does this by LITERALLY destroying the football pyramid
Those bans won't happen. I'm more interested in seeing how teams qualify and how teams can get relegated in this new league. One thing for certain, it's taking the featured matchups in domestic leagues and CL away. 10bill Euros per club, gosh that's so insane.
This is a front. They’re not looking for a knockout cup at all. They know they are going to be told they can’t continue in there respective national leagues and when they do they will use this as an, “ah I guess we will have to make our own league” excuse. I think they’re planning a full blown league. Not knockout competition.
We all know we want this...
I'm taking my Manchester United jersey down from my wall for the first time in over 3 years. It won't be put back up until this is all demolished.
Bad idea
I hope all the people outraged by this are ready to not watch the games when they happen, just like we did when sky and bt tried charging £15 for PPV matches
Get them out of the Champions League and the Europa League right now..Take every single cup away from them. Erase them from the history books..
Game is gone we lost
Mike Ashley ripped the soul out of my football club years ago. Our fans have been told to sit down, shut up and deal with it. Now owners of the “important clubs” are doing the same there is uproar. It is despicable, but I’m struggling to have feel any emotion towards it because my clubs already been completely wrecked.
in other words these 12 to 15 teams want more money to pilfer more players from lesser teams and still pocket even more profits..
Screw spurs I will not be renewing my season ticket or buying any of there merch again
Let’s be fair sky have a lot to lose, it’s almost like they coordinated their narrative. The idea is bad but I feel theirs some media dark arts going on here ....
The only thing good about ESL is that AFTV will be lit every single week!
Boycott the clubs
I hope they lose all their fans and everyone boycotts it. Disgraceful. If I supported a big 6 time, I would now go and support a German team, and I urge you do the same until this madness stops. Please don't fund this money grabbing filth.
They want to regulate their own brands. They will get more money playing in  a midweek super league than playing in the premier league and champions league combined. Plus all the commercial revenue, sponsors, tv rights. They will be spectacularly wealthy and play less games. Who would care about a premier league without those teams. The other commercial interests and governing bodies will either have to compromise with the breakaway clubs or else their leagues and product will be unwatchable with the worlds best players in a super league.
A lot of comments saying this is the end of football...a lot of panic ..same thing happened when premier league broke away from lower leagues...want to hear more from both sides before I make up my mind up
The funniest part is that all the owners got together and said “the fans are gonna go crazy for this one”
Managers need to start resigning in protest. Refuse to work for these clubs. Or they don't care about football
I wanna commit $uicide I lost my hope for this beautiful game
I have loved and supported Manchester United,  but now after all this it might be time to part ways.
My life as a Chelsea fan is over 😭
leicester city should be crowned the premier league champions if this goes ahead!
*RELEGATE THE BIG SIX RIGHT NOW AND STRIP THEM OF THEIR TROPHIES*
We need the players to rebel against this, this is not a good idea
Pure greed
Communism rules
What would you rather watch?..... City vs Juventus, city vs Barca and city vs Milan or ..... City vs Fulham, City vs Brighton and City vs Crystal Palace??
My heart breaks for the fans of these clubs, and all football fans across Europe. What a disgusting decision by these clubs.
As a Chelsea fan I’m just disgusted. We sold our soul.
End of football
This also just completely fucks over England's hopes of winning international tournaments now that the players are being banned by UEFA and FIFA.
I'm an American (meaning I know more about money and finance than the typial european) and I think the super league is AWESOME. It won't be on the NFL's level of course but nothing is. But the super league will do great things for soccer
I hope no one pays to watch the new league games and I hope no one goes to the matches live. Greedy and ruined football. Football will be missed
How did Arsenal get in first and how did Spurs get in second
Ugh
Take away everything, just don’t take away football...
Greed GREED GREED GREED GREED GREED
It's not a bad idea though, i think this league is really gonna be fun
Players need to go on strike. No pun intended.
The end.
Its time for psg to win the champions league
Somebody should do something
Only day being a Sunderland supporter hasn't sucked...but sad for the reasons why...
How would teams compete in 2 38 fixture leagues a season plus cup competitions?
Fans need to unite and protest relentlessly
There’s no way someone who really loves the game would support this disgrace of a competition. Unbelievable
After years of supporting Arsenal I feel heartbroken to support Another team but I have to PSG it is
Rich boys league for the unskilled teams who fear relegation. Nice.
They've indicated they would stay in their respective leagues (why would Premier league/Serie A/La liga be upset?). Maybe it is time to break away from the Champions league and UEFA. Why do we as fans think UEFA should have all this power? What gives them the right to ban players from playing in the World Cup? UEFA and FIFA are the most corrupt organizations in the world and yet we're upset about this news??
Disappointing
In other news Covid-19 is a scripted plan by these billionaire elites to usher in The New World Order! One World Government by 2030 is the agenda 👍 There taking over sports now
what a joke
Drogba has 4 word to say...
And after 1 season they will crawl back to us trying to get back. So sad what happened to football.
Elitist wankers
I’m a United fan through and through, I’ve been with them through the glory days and through the suffering but now I don’t know what to do. I surely can’t stay with them through this. I’ve Always liked Everton I guess😂
joke
The real scandal is that Spurs have been added. Cmon
This is the day greed killed football.
at least keep the champions league song....
I genuinely never thought I'd question my allegiance to Liverpool. But, this honestly has me wondering if I can call myself a fan of this club anymore. Istanbul, the comeback against Barcelona, ending the PL title drought, it all feels so shallow now. Absolutely gutted.
Relegate them and take their money away and give it to the smaller clubs like Bolton and etc
Since when was man City and spurs one of the big 12 in Europe?
Dock them all 100 points tomorrow and fine them billions. Leicester can have another league title and sheff utd fans you can avoid relegation
Boris i will take back everything i ever said about you if you remove the rights of these Americans from owning English companies.
sorry mate no longer am i an arsenal fan.
even if this went ahead. i think the players would get so much abuse that they might give up aswell. imagine all riots could happen people burgler players house it could be alot of violence trust me. after a year of covid people are already mad and this happen, am telling you anything can happen. that have this all wrong. and soon they will realise that money is not more important than passion.
Whats the point in a league where the top 4 clubs don't qualify for Europe.
I take it Sky and BT won't be showing the games then. How many fans say they won't follow it yet will go ahead anyway.
We all need to take into consideration that the owners are the ones making the decision, not the coaches, staffs and players. Cancel them, not the ones on the pitch. Been scouting leeds and Dortmund for awhile now... I might transfer myself to one of them if this truely proceeds (god pls don't)  Also mad respect to the german and french big teams for not joining.
Football is ruined
This is just a massive game of poker....the clubs themselves likely recognise the challenges of setting up such a league and probably would rather change the current Champions League to better suit themselves, whilst UEFA and the domestic leagues recognise the threat a breakaway league would pose to their finances, but they're probably also bluffing in their threat to ban them from all other competitions given the massive amount of money that in itself would cost them all  Someone has to budge
Wankers
How disgraceful
First time the comment section isn't complaining about Sky Sports...
I'm finished, the games dead 1. Relegate the clubs 2. Ban them from international competition 3. Stop watching the games or buying the merchandise.
Don’t like this proposal at all but i am interested in what other teams would even consider joining this?
RIP uefa champions league
I’m not supporting Chelsea anymore
I hate them for that
This european super league is a stupid plan
So 12 clubs will share €3.5bn yet hundreds/thousands of other clubs within each country's pyramids and non-league systems will share just €10bn between them all?
man utd , liverpool were moaning how many games they had to play, let them chelsea , city, arsenal , tottenham, fuk off and live in spain , supporters stop your support for the dirtbags
Football is in the mud. Like surely this is it. There’s no going back
Disgusting
finally we can all agree that Everton is a tiny tiny club
If this actually happens i will leave my beloved club of manchester united fan for 20 years. Loyality is gone. time to support teams like QPR amazing club.
Why don't this so called big teams go play in saudi Arabia no1 will care
It's a disgrace Boycott
If we all don’t watch it they won’t go through with it the whole reason of domestic football is for the entertainment of Burnley vs united with Burnley fans possibly watching there team beat a brilliant team what will it give fans of clubs outside of the “super league”
RIP Football
I wont support Spurs no more if they join this league ill just go watch my home town play instead in the Southern Combination Football League. My allegiance lies with English footballs pyramid system above all else.
Arsenal n Tottenham are mid table teams how are they involved in the so call big six
Tf is the esl and why do yall hate it?
As a AC Milan fan if this happen im gonna support BVB 09
Need banning this is outrageous
Ppl calling for the big 6 to be punished and held accountable by the premier league are in for a rude awakening about how much power has shifted to these clubs
This is great.. people who hate it don’t understand what the league is and can’t give u one adequate reason for hating it. They’ve just heard the media going against it and decided to oppose it too.. in reality the media outlets u follow will be losing money as they’e paid millions and billions for the rights to broadcast the domestic European leagues  and champions league.. so of course they’ll oppose it.. especially when u consider that the Super League will probably be broadcasting matches using its own platform, probably an application similar to the NFL and NBA, the App will probably be reasonably priced and will allow us to watch all super league games on demand 😍 the only reasonable objection to the super league is that the domestic leagues will be hurt, but in the long run club football will take its rightful place as an international competition rather than a domestic one, rather than arguing what league is best we’ll get an opportunity to openly and actively watch all Europe’s elite compete
Boycott these clubs
Good idea! a football league like the NBA or NFL. They can maybe organise a draft every year to recruite from smaller leagues.
Disgrace
Get ready for your Sky / BT sports package to go through the roof ! And do you really think the likes of Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford, Phil Foden etc will request a transfer, away from Big 6 clubs,  just so they can play for England and thus miss out on quadruple wages ? The PL will not do anything cos without the Big 6 they will be nothing. Sky wont pay the big bucks to screen the likes of Brighton vs Burnley etc week in, week out. Whichever way you look at it, it all boils down to money, and (apart from Leicester winning the PL) money always rules.......
I am all for it, try it and let's see how it works...
I wont be watching ya s**y super league!! The premier league all the way !!!
Fifa will need a hefty bribe to accept this
1 . Players who play in the super league are not allowed play for their national team   2. Before joining any other league you pay off all you're debts ( outstanding money owed for all transfers )   3 . Not allowed take part in domestic trophy's or european trophy's .   4 . When the super league fail's as fan's boycott it & team's want rejoin there league system they can but the need stick to financial fair play rules & are to be placed at the bottom of the football league system like rangers & juventus have been forced to do
Managers and players in these teams should take a stand against this.
Don't agree but kind of karma when the big clubs formed the premier league and turned there backs on the football league now that the shoes on the other foot the premier league and SKY not liking it don't expect loyalty to something that was built on greed in the first place, but for the fans real shock especially given the unprecedented times and these greedy so and so's announce this for gods sake could of waited if so desperate till once stadiums were full again and the pandemic over.
I wanna dislike this video because of how disgusted i am but then i realised its not sky sport's fault🤣
Time to watch the mls
Arsenal fan no longer, Fulham fan from now
The only good thing about the Super League is that UEFA will consider not adopting the new 2024 Champions League system  Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good
Biggest beneficiary is arsenal, they ain’t playing champions league anyway, atleast now they can call themselves a big club and get into top football.
Wtf
Support your local (non league) teams guys
Just boykott the Super League and they will suck dicks to get back.  My work here is done!
38 premier league games, between 18-23  Super League game. Up to 6 FA matches plus  up to 5 EFL matches. That's a possible 70 matches  from August to May..  Minimal guarantee 58 matches a season...  The extra 5 slots for the ESL might not be worth it with the extra signings needed plus likely to go out first round after them 18 games.  I bet some of these games will be at neutral venues.  It's like a pre season tour during the season.   Man U v Milan in Los Angeles or in Beijing..  Spurs v Arsenal in Saudi Arabia.    These teams are gonna need huge squads.
Prevent and relegate all involved teams
Time to switch to the bundesliga
Lads if you ever wanna switch to being a QPR fan that would be nice, we are absolutely shite most days but could use the ticket sales once we are aloud back in the stadiums lol
Thats a ban from domestic competions...as quick as possible These clubs have made a mockery of the beautifull game
So glad I support hibs in the spfl
Sky will be the first entity to try and buy the TV rights.
I am embarrassed as an arsenal fan
Spurs ha ha ha ha
im proud of fc bayern munich and PSG to say "NO"
Iam supporting this league
Tottenham and Arsenal? hahaha
For the first time in my life I'm disgraced to be a Manchester united fan 😭
Am I the only one who see this as a turning point in football history? It would be absolutely beautiful to see the mob of FIFA coming down. This is great news! Clubs are the real owners of this game. They need to get rid of the “middle man”, who happens to be a filthy partner.
Absolutely disgraceful. Shame on them all
If you support any of these teams (whether you've been supporting them for 30 years or 30 minutes) and feel angry/dejected/betrayed/heartbroken, Congratulations. You are a fan for the right reasons
sundowns pirates and chiefs must joinnn
Cheers capitalism, youve ruined football.
disgusting. Creating a further gap between the ‘big 6’ and the rest of the football pyramid. No thoughts to the players having to play even more games. Clubs have folded during the pandemic and here’s a handful of clubs now receiving an obscene amount of money.
We’re going to see the kids play a lot more
All just money Grabbers basiclly nothing to do with football
As a football fan u never want ur football club to be fined, but uefa please fine all the clubs
I'll watch the French League now.
Wetsham always open for more fans boys ❤️⚒
What is the achievement winning this league? The winner of economics?
Arsenal gonna lose 9-0 every match 😂
Unpopular opinion ... amidst the pandemic, UEFA and FIFA got the super-money, while clubs fell into deficit ... it's simply a power grab that's scaring the current governing bodies which wield too much power, not only in terms of sport (but also economically and politically)
Why on earth is Tottemham in the list?
sky making all the dummies frightened. calm down you idiots. it will just replace the champions  league. the prem will be played in the same way
Arsenal..must be a glitch
Promote the enitre top 9 finishers in the championship.
Asteroid is on it's way to football boom bye bye
Where are all these billions coming from? If it weren’t obvious football is rife with dirty money and money laundering before this might just make people open their eyes a bit moe
I doubt the Premier league will ban the clubs. They will lose money, deals, viewership, sponsorship
I won't be following any of the games. They can go "F" themselves.  A great time to focus your individual support (financial by way of buying jerseys etc.) towards your local teams.  I just ordered a Salford City jersey. I've been a Man-U fan since I was 9 (37 years ago) and will no longer support them.  This is grotesque!
This is the one time when all the fans come together 😂
if only there was a way for these clubs to help them get and keep top level football. Pipe dream I know but say if they had larger stadiums, bigger fan bases and commercial deals they would be able to buy the best players to keep them at the top... 🤪
Relegate them, relegate them all.
My team aren't part of it. Bayern, Mia  San Mia, respect from England
Welp, time to stop supporting Juve 😔
I don't get why everyone's so angry
Why is this so bad
Why is everyone against this? I reckon it will be sick. The same teams usually finish top 4 every season. If anomalies do get qualify for champs league. They usually don’t get far and ain’t in it the next season. think this way is better.
United for life.. Up Super League
Lifelong spurs fan and I honestly hope we lose Wednesday to Southampton. FOYS 🤬 Also Arsenal are 9th👀
I want this league... bring it on
We can't let them get away with this! We have to make sure we do our bit to disrupt their plans! Without the fans they have nothing. DO NOT BUY MERCH, DO NOT BUY TICKETS, DO NOT WATCH THE GAMES! These money hungry businessmen are trying to ruin our game - we have to stand against them!
If people were honest with themselves they would say we're not a fan of UEFA and FIFA either.
Wtf are they going to do next start drafting players
Man United called red devils! Devil always makes you do bad things!
They don’t seem to understand the reason people look forward to big games is because of the stakes and build up which can’t be achieved in this league. They also seem to forget where the world class players that get people watching come from, they are almost always developed by “small teams”. People need to vote with their money but never do.
Honestly i cannot see the big deal cus if it doesn't replace a prem league or anything then why is it a big deal just an added competition
Bit hypocritical of the Tories to condemn this
Get rid.
I feel ashamed to be a liverpool supporter
Really? My spurs decided to do this?
Guys we can’t let this happen. Every single person needs to pull together and get this absolutely appalling criminal idea stopped!
They r all running scared from Bolton Wanderers inevitable rise to the top of the prem 😂
Finally Juventus will get a chance to win a european trophey and also ac Milan will win their 8 chl title 🤪🤣
Won’t buy. Won’t watch. Boycott the greed folks!
This is an "operation"... wonder who will get affected... and who will benefit...
Done being a Manchester United fan...
I guess Leeds is my new team
Why is it bad for them making a new league? Can someone help me with this
Save Our Leagues
Gonna end up watching Stockport county if this goes through.
this is basically how champions league started when only top teams that were league leaders got to join
I hope, somehow, that absolutely nobody watches this elitist garbage
Never been ashamed to support Man Utd, until now.
Liverpool? Come on.. wrong side of history lads.
BOYCOTT YOUR CLUBS
Football is dead, I will no longer support spurs and I am a baggies fan now
Kick the cunts out and create a full British league  25 years of supporting Man U DONE mate DONE
its a disgrace. I'm stopping my arsenal membership tomorrow. all fans of top 6 must do the same. I want to playing English teams not Barcelona and Milan. i have heard RB Leipzig have joined. These 6 clubs must be kicked out of English football and I'm a Arsenal. Stan has killed my club. No real football fan wants this
Wait so who's the other 3 clubs? Germany and France said no unless they're waiting to see what happens
Cancel Sky
“Leading football clubs” Arsenal and Tottenham...
Money 💰🤑💸💲💶💵💰🤑💸💲 talks 👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄
Why are AC Milan, Arsenal and Tottenham on this list?
Breaking News - We don't live in a Corruption Free World 😂
Ultimatum needed tomorrow from PL saying you have 24 hours to either pull out of the Super League or get booted from the PL.
I say do it we need a super league, if they want to ban the teams let them, it will only make super league more of a thing
Don't see any of this happening. Similar to 'Project Restart' this is just the big clubs putting pressure on the relevant existing authorities to fix their existing competitions. European elite football has been a stagnant market for years, and needs a shake-up. This will make that shake-up happen, and beyond that it means nothing. The only reason financial headline figures are quoted in the statement is to make the rest of us realise how much money is tied up in European competition, or at least it's potential. Just like OR, it's pretty transparent tbh
Aren’t these top clubs already complaining that there are too many games in a season already? 🤔 💰 💵
R.I.P good soocer - 19.04.2021     w´ll miss you...
cash cash cash football as we know it is over
Act of reprehensible vandalism; a complete anmbomination. The clubs, and anyone associated with this criminal proposal, are not football fans, but avaricious sociopaths...!🤬
The melodramatics of people is hilarious. The Super League will be hugely successful & clubs will be clamouring for the 5 yearly qualifying spots up for grabs.
Hopefully people drop them and support teams like wolves and Leicester ciy or rb leipzig
I actually like the ESL, I’ll get to watch the best teams play against each other
Most of the reaction is coming from reading a headline and not the details - the clubs have said they would remain in their domestic competitions so the impact is on the UEFA competitions, which are already greed driven so there's no change there. I would prefer an actual discussion on the proposal and not outrage reactions to headlines and non-sense about ripping the heart out of football - how is it? If Liverpool still play Leicester on a Saturday and then this competition on a Wednesday, whats the difference? Probably better football? I'd like to understand it a bit better rather than hearing all the shouting non-sense.
4 billion football fans will turn to 4 million and those are small team fans
Lol, maybe being an arsenal fan ain't that bad now cause we ain't a top 6 club anyways 🤣🤣🤣
Well it looks like I support Salford City
football is over now no point anymore let's get all the small clubs all over Europe and out those clubs from the league get thm out
Greats such as Shankly, Brian Clough, Don Revvie etc must be spinning in their graves regarding this. Absolutely brutal RIP football.
Please ban these teams from the league, that would be so brilliant
Anyone knows of any of these 12 teams are gonna be in fifa 22 ?
Good news
I’m done with your ass Manchester United!! I’m done!!😤
An absolute shambles and dark day for football, created by the fans and was only intended for the fans until the rich bastards came and took our game away. I'm baffled by Man Utd's decision to participate in this, to quote what Sir Matt Busby said "Football is nothing without Fans" clearly the fans mean nothing to  these owners.
This is not good but the Threats from the Premier League, La Liga, and other Domestic Leagues to ban these clubs won't work I'm afraid. FIFA's Threat and UEFA's Threat of banning players that participate in either the World Cup or Euros are the only REAL Threats to deter this Super League from happening.  The Premier League CANNOT ban the Big 6 or threaten to relegate them lol. The Premier League is the richest league because of the amount of money TV companies pay them to broadcast their matches. TV Companies pay to show Man United matches and those teams that make up the Big 6. If the Big 6 are gone, there'll be fewer people watching the Premier League and the TV companies will make WAYY less money and they'll either cancel their contract with the Premier League or renegotiate for less money. The bottom line is that the Premier League will lose Financially if they ban or relegate the Big 6. The TV companies are CURRENTLY paying to show Big 6 matches not Fulham vs Aston Villa, unfortunately (because they have a less worldwide fan base)so yeah the Domestic league cant ban or kick out the Big 6 unfortunately because of the impact on their Finances if they do so. The Big Clubs know the Power they have. It's why they are Bold to reject their fans and outcry. They are doing it for the money, unfortunately. Barca and Madrid are in serious debt and this is serious gold for them to get their finances in order. The dumb Big 6 are bailing them out. Madrid and Barca will get the money they need, then proceed to keep attracting all the Big Players to play for them over the rest of the teams that make up the Super League. The ultimate winners will be Barca and Real Madrid. I can't fathom why the Big 6 would sign up for this when their Rivals in Spain are in dire financial pain. Why help them out after years of wasteful spending? I guess the allure of more money is hard to turn down especially for the owners.
The death of football as we know it
I have lost my respect for Barca ,we r no longer mes que un club (more than a club).Rip
Ggs ig I’m a Leicester fan now. I can’t handle supporting a team in the f*ckingsuper league
At least Villa can get in Europe, right?
Read the room you billionaire tw@ts.  You think you have the power, but trying making money if there is no one there to watch.
So Arsenal and Ac Milan can’t spent money to buy great players but they can spend it to destroy football 🤔🤔🤔
Is This The End Of Football?
Aftet they never received no income from the fans in gate revenue due to the pandemic this was bound to happen... CHELSEATHROUGHANDTHROUGH💙💙💙
Football is no longer for entertainment, strictly business now...
All clubs not involved should kick these teams out of their domestic league.  Arsenal fan
With the threat of not being able to play for your national team, should be enough motivation to refuse in participating in this ESL!   To not be able to represent your country at the World Cup is enough to opt out of any financial incentives!
You watch these bastards at SKY get behind this!
This Is A Disgrace To Football
I don't understand what all the fuss is about? I think it's a great idea
These spineless rats. Shame on liverpool, shame on city, shame on utd, arsenal, Spurs everyone involved, I’m disgusted in my team liverpool.
I was a Barcelona fan for 17 years. I will now support Cadiz
We are Leeds United , WE MOT ,
I hope all these clubs realize that they’ve made a very big mistake .
I am now in full support of Bayern Munich instead of chelsea. They are absolute Legends and have massive respect for the game especially because the owners consist of legends like kahn, rummennige and hoeneß
I support this league... Now all the fans and pundits criticising owners for money Greed... Where were they? when these rich owners spent a lot to bring big players to clubs..... This is amazing league, so dont become rigid and support it..
I really want to cry 😭😭😔
The disrespect from these American owners mate they don’t even like football
I believe Arsenal is gonna lose all their games in this new league😂
The real problems are the owners of the club's glaciers for example. They dont understand football and are solely in it for the money. Despicable  if you ask me!
And now in steps Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix the sharks are here and football as we know it dies rip
At least we gonna see big teams facing eachother every week.  Uefa and other bodies should reach an agreement with them
Dammm I don’t even want to be a Man U fan. I don’t know to feel about this.
Is this the end of football
i’ve supported chelsea all my life so sad to see this😔
why are you guys against this?
Why is Tottenham in there? 🤣🤣
PSG, Dortmund, Ajax, Sevilla and Bayern will join and there will still be 3 spots left to reach to 20. Interesting to know who else will join.
Even our dumbass of a Prime minister is saying it’s bad
Super league = football syndicate
They should all be taken out of the league as of tonight and basically be given 24-48 hours to pull out otherwise they go down to league 2
Since I live in the U.S. I have more options to watch association football. But not European clubs anymore. I have a team in the Mexican league that I like. Just watch Liga MX.
One time peoples say UEFA MAFIA ... now they suport uefa wtff
Kick them out of the league now, Ban players from international teams and from ever playing in english football again. A F*cking disgrace. Kick Chelsea out of FA Cup Final And Spurs and Man City out of Carabo Cup. Replace them with Teams from Semi finals Who aren't Desecrating the game. Kick them out of the league now
Every fan I’ve spoke to tonight would consider walking away from the game we love, if this became reality. I’ve played & watched football for nearly 50yrs, & I’m gutted & sick of the greed killing our beloved game!
Football is about the fans, and the fans don't want this. It will fail drastically if they try to push it through.
RIP
Lol people just hate to hate. This would be amazing
They'll find you can't buy prestige and history. Over several years I worked in Canada, US, Ecuador and Japan. In all of these countries I would often find bars showing FA Cup matches, no matter what teams were playing. People wanted to watch because it was the FA Cup.
Something that will Unite all football fans against a common enemy!
how funny would it be when the "Top 6" lose their fans AND their revenue right after breaking away. Shrewsbury Town vs Doncaster Rovers EPL titles races for me ☺️
I'm so disappointed that I have been supporting Liverpool and now 😪 football has been ruined i want to support a difference team now
It could all be a power move to get uafa back to the table because the bigger clubs want a say in new champions league
This a disgrace to the world of football, I honestly hope those that want this to go ahead burn in hell.
I know this comment s gonna get hella hate.. but im excited about this new league.. NBA style.. LET'S GOO!!! @SUPERLEAGUEWHYTHEHELLNOTANYWAYS
Bye Chelsea, I'm going to start supporting Fulham
I'm a united fan... I hope UEFA and FIFA, Premier league etc throw the book and the rest of the library at us. This is disgusting.
Get out of the domestic leagues, we don’t want you in them.  Get out of the champs league we don’t want you in that either.  And any player who plays for you can never represent their country again.  See how Super your league is.    Man City were a league 1 club not so long ago... Juventus went bankrupt and had to start at the bottom again.  You’re not super clubs.  Arsenal are 9th in the league, Tottenham have won nothing of note since the 80s. Real Madrid get govt kickbacks to keep them afloat.
just shocked. dont know if im going to watch football again
How have they got time to play more midweek matches in an already congested fixture calendar?
Disgraceful... R.I.P Football.
18/5/2021 this is the last day in the football which we all love it from our hearts
Everyone complaining about it will be the very same people tuning in to watch it.
I'LL FOLLOW MAN CITY WHEREVER THEY'RE..
Free football ⚽️
They simply want to line their own pockets, this is an absolute disgrace 😤
RIP
How are arsenal and Spurs biggest in Europe at the moment
This is what happens when filth like the Glazers is kept in Football.  I'm United till I Die.  The Glazers need to GTFO
Cantona drew me into football and led to my support of Man Utd. I’m not supporting this club anymore. Grealish is the only player I’ve liked in the PL this season, so I’ll just support the player (unless he joins a club in the super league - then it’s truly over)
As an arsenal fan I wonder...why did we want to join this league? We can't even qualify for the European league
Is this real
Nobody should watch these games!
35 years of loving football and United has gone!! I struggled to watch football the last year with all the political narratives all over it, but this is the final straw!! This last year has definitely been an awakening to how corrupt the world is.. money, greed, control and power!
its such a brilliant idea i cannot wait ! Good luck to MCFC in this league they will smash it , exciting games every week !!
Shameful for Arsenal, United and Liverpool especially as the top 3 big boys in this league due to history! I watched my team celebrate a draw and now to top it off we’re accelerating to be in this league like what on earth has these clubs become with these American owners trying to make football like NBA 🤣 football is finished man
End of football...
I can already see it UEFA CHAMPIONS FINALISTS “Eibar Vs Cagliari” 2024
Get a grip there's more important things in life than this silly little sport
Oh no
I'm hoping this happens,  finally a league with proper competition, MUFC.
This is why Manchester United started a Women's team. They knew full well what was going on. Greed is the explanation.
Go to hell you greedy bastards..you destroy everything we love about football...
Funniest thing is Arsenal and Spurs in it 😂
Nobody wanna see the same clubs play eachother every year the champion league was already way in favor of the big clubs but this will be even worse
Been a liverpool fan for 37 years but that's it I've had enough that's the scummiest thing I've seen in football history  I'm taking my fanhood to everton where they actually know how to run a football club
All these armchair 'plastic fannies' of the top six whining and moaning will still go out and spend £50.to £60 on a new club shirt next season and an extra twenty for the name of the latest Carlos Kickaball striker they've just bought from Ajax on the back.  Watching from L1 whilst the PL destroys itself is rather therapeutic. You deserve all you get.
I’m a Tottenham fan here in America, isn’t this the same thing as the champions league? I’m confused at why people are mad.
Do they wanna kill other european leagues? like champions league!! wtf
im considering a new club...
Worth pointing out that according to the UEFA coefficients Inter Milan are the 26th best team in Europe and AC Milan are 53rd!  Bayern rate as the best team and aren't even taking part
Pure greed, corrupt. 'Enjoin good forbid evil' Quran 9.112
This is just another mechanism to grind out more sponsorship, cash and so on. So Europa league clubs will also now move up and play in the champions league. Lower league clubs will be in the Europa league. They are just playing musical chairs for Billionaires and Millionairs.
So I guess I'm a Leicester fan now? This is extremely disrespectful...even tho  I'm an arsenal fan, I hope this league doesn't work out at all
I'm all for it, on the condition they add in WWE style storylines, less teams, so you gotta find a way to make it interesting, imagine Liverpool are winning a crucial match and then Ole and Pogba come in with steel chairs and injure Klopp and Salah
I am embarrassed to be a Liverpool supporter. I may support another club. It’s over. Goodbye football, it was a beautiful time.
I swear , when this start all of us sounding all emo here will be the first turning our tv channels to those end less Classico’s
Listen, I'm calling this now, most people who are showing outrage now, will still watch and support the league when it starts, say you won't, but you all will.
I encourage everyone not to watch this, make your voices heard, no true football fan wants this. Don’t watch it, don’t support it. This is an absolute disgrace, if fans truly work together, we can stop this.
Yes! Arsenal got into Europe!
The jacks are going up, the jacks are going up
Ashamed to be a United fan right now not gunna lie this is horrific for the sport, if this doesn't get stopped and goes ahead then Im done with football....
Fuckin disgrace. Stan Kronke, Florentino Perez and the rest of them will rot in hell
I’ve only been a arsenal fan for 6 years but just switched to the hammers the clubs are all greedy
My problem is Arsenal and Tottenham. What are they doing there. Why do they want to be the schalke and Shelfied United of this super league.
Gillingham season ticket is looking enticing... as long as they dont make we wear a bloody mask.
Liverpool left I’ve heard😎
What a joke this is I will not support Tottenham anymore this is shambolic
Well gonna support wolves next season.   Thanks for the memories Arsenal, hope you will not got battered by every opposition in the super league 🙃
All these clubs have turned their backs on 100+ years of tradition and history to sell shirts to Americans, Africans, Chinese and Indians. Absolutely disgusted
My beloved Chelsea is involve in this ?what a mess, my heart bless. I guess i should start focusing on basketball.the Worious for life.
Football finally coming to an end 😭
I’ve been a Tottenham fan all my life but... I’m still a Tottenham fan mfers sorry your broke ass club isn’t popular enough to be among the elite
im surprised that psg arent a part of this LOL
wouldnt you rather see ac milan vs manchester city vs barcelona more often? I know I do. Champions league is not enough
With all this backlash by the fans the super greed will be cancelled
Poor Tottenham there gonna get smoked in this league
😂I’m so excited about this,  is PSG getting their first UCL ? For being a good student.
What are these guys doing at the studio this time of the  night, especially on a Sunday?  Don't they realise tomorrow is Monday! (The worst day of the week).  But i guess the ESL roll out calls for an all-nighter!  Time and a half after midnight .. lads?
Chelsea have been helping the community of WEST LONDON,  I JUST HOPE THIS DOES NOT CHANGE ANYTHING,  THE CHARACTER OF THE TEAM AND THE HISTORY
As an arsenal fan, I’m disgusted. Arsenal firstly should not be there, they’ve been awful but becuase of 💥money💥 there they are. Also, europa league has been for nothing...thanks.
This is horrible overall for the sport
Looks like Leicester just won the league again!
Ashamed to support arsenal at the moment, going to sell my shirts and start supporting my local northern irish teams
** If nobody watches....they lose money, and it will fail. Don't watch the clubs in it, and watch their investment fail. Everyone would have to be disciplined about it though, because some of you would have to make the difficult choice of not watching and supporting your home club.
It was inevitable... Accept it or not ... CL group stage is a joke ... Europa league is joke .... Everybody who is condemning this idea here will be watching these mouth Wartering fixtures everyday...
Disgraceful.
Can’t wait. I’m actually excited
Wow...
RIP all man city fans who were applauding their club for not being a part of this. If cheating and corruption was a league they would win it every year
All those guys who troll to leave their clubs after a loss, the copy and paste same old response— that could actually happen Bc of this. Shambles,.
This is really bad but you watch this turn into the biggest thing ever. Bayern and PSG will join the league after they see the money it brings in
Can't see it working. The players have been threatened that they'll not be able to play for their countries. As a player id be handing in my transfer request and refusing to play. Who would you rather play for, your club or country?  No players no super League!!
Disappointed as Man utd fan💔
WRONG  They do not need permission. It has nothing to do with FIFA. They own their own stadiums and can conduct whatever they want on their own facilities.
This is not only ruining the game itself but the players as well. I swear these owners think the players are robots that can play a 90 minute game every day every week for 15 years. I think even some players might boycott their own team. Well at least the ones with pride
Ah for f sake really it'll ruin the game
They wanna earn much $ but players from that clubs cant suffer more
I'm not saying I want this but people these days do afraid of change man ha 😄 the whole word are in tears but we will get used to it as long as it isn't a stupid competition where the players are restricted and the teams are trapped in the league.
Leicester, West Ham and Everton are going to cruise the premier league now. Liverpool, United and Arsenal are going to fail miserably and come crying back to England in league 2.
Makes me glad to be a fulham fan lol
As a liverpool fan I can't believe my club would betray me im going back to supporting celtic
THE GLAZERS LAST MONTH TOOK 70 MILLION POUNDS OUT OF MAN UTD HELPING FOOTBALL  I JUST SAW SOME PIGS FLYING
Mad
Fair play to Bayern who walked away
and so they give in to the greed. How disappointing and pathetic it is to see clubs like my favourite Manchester United, Barcelona etc. give in to their greed and attempt this miserable excuse of a cash-grab. I genuinely hope they get punished for having decided to go through with this. It's an absolute shambles right now especially considering the timing of it. On a positive note, it's nice to see the fans are united against this atrocity
We are witnessing *HISTORY* FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS
People power, just boycott your club, I've stopped following Spurs, not putting a single penny into that club.
Short MANU STOCK
ruined it now
Leicester are going to be the new champions
I want to actually kill my self
This is disgusting and a disgrace to the beautiful game, ive supported my club as long as I could remember, i never thought the day would come where I would be sick of being a supporter of my club. All these 12 teams need to kicked from their leagues and fined immediately if they go ahead with this, hand them point deductions. Football has been taken over by the greedy, we've seen it with the 2022 World Cup and now were seeing it again.
Global soccer followers do not care about local leagues . We just want great games . I would rather watch manutd vs Real Madrid rather than manutd vs norwitch . I don’t want to spend my precious 90mins on meaningless and less competitive game .
We want super club world cup every 2 years , same format as the WC
Disgusting. Florentino Perez is a disgrace to football. This is the end of football.
If they get it right it could be alright because the Champions League will hopefully turn into a worldwide knockout tournament with every other Super League making world football stronger and maybe teams from a Europa League (secondary competition) can compete too it will be better than Fifa club world cup.
Manchester United fan all my life, I'm genuinely physically sick. I hope they are relegated or thrown out of the Premier league I will not use we or us when I say that because as of today I have no team any more. As if things couldn't get worse this year. So depressed. I stand with all fans no matter who you are we do not deserve this.
It is going to ruin football.
Its a very American style league.
Action this day : deduct points to relegate them, ban them immediately from domestic and European competitions, and ban their players from internationals - they want to run for the benefit of asian supporters, good riddance !
Glazers are American wtf do they know about football,the cheek of it
Football is going to end, i cant believe it
That's a joke, I genuinely hope this crashes and burns
Better quality games why are people bitter ? Only the big head who not getting money are upset we as fan gettifn to see higher quality matches ans not traveling till to Western Europe where it’s freezing to watch games
Expel all 6 from the Premiership today
Sad time for football. Created by the poor, stolen by the rich
This is dream league's blueprint
Give clubs like Burnley and Everton their best players and Chuck them at league 2
I like the reaction and double take to the 3.5 Billion Euros.
So are the prem clubs leaving the prem for this league?
Thank god sir Matt Busby isn't alive to alive to see, as a utd fan I will not be supporting this
Rangers and celtic should be allowed to move to the English premier league
Money talks... I think this will go ahead even after the initial backlash. The establishments will be bribed to agree to it. Founded clubs will receive 2 billion. Wow. Wonder when it will start.
im not gonna watch football anymore...
Dock 20 points of teams tomorrow. Lets see wagwan then
I can see a huge rise in support for teams like Salford and Tranmier after this because of the United and Liverpool fans who have some sense wanting to watch proper football
I really hope the new Super League anthem is as catchy as the Champions League music. 😁😁😁
For all the crying and whining done by FIFA and UEFA believe me that they will fall into line when they receive those big money handouts by the Super League clubs   and fans worldwide will watch it along with looking forward to seeing their teams winning the Super League championship   Blame UEFA for allowing this mess to begin with when they decided to delude the Champions League when they added non League champions into it
Can someone explain why this league is bad? Just woke up and suddenly watch this o.o
Kick all the teams out of European competitions with immediate effect and the players won't stand for it and if they can't play for there country they will boycott.
Not going to watch one game of these teams ever again. NEVER AGAIN. A game of the working class...
This is basically pissing down on other fellow top league teams that they are below these big clubs.   Completely making a mockery out of other professional teams and also a monopolistic business love by oligarchical clubs to sideline other clubs that are just as deserving to compete at a top level.  Football is not worth watching at all.  It has become a disgusting money game and deserves full boycott
Words are important but we've got to back it up. Don't be tempted by the pay per view nonsense. Turn your back on this financially.
RIP Football 1846-2021
Sad day to be an inter fan
I'm a liverpool fan, but this doesnt feel right 😕😕😕
Uefa & the BPL need to stick to their guns. Kick them out. Don't want business men ripping the soul out of football.
I’m not with them but you can’t relegate this big 6 lmao. The big 6 would just refuse to play championship and then u got a football league without them and every prem team collapses as that 100 mil tv right that keeps their huge wage pay slips alive is massively massively reduced so don’t be saying that. Even if u did relegate them teams like arsenal just played most the season with a huge academy team so even if you relegated them and every senior player left they’d still walk back into the prem 😂😂
I announce if this happens I am no longer LFC fan I am Evertonian fan
I'm done with United . I hope the premier league punished the club's and relegate United .
I will never in my life watch or support this, they are killing the game we all love
Just go and set up a tournament in FIFA rather than destroying football😡😡
Bruh, I used to make this league in FIFA 18.😂
Shame on ARSENAL,  CHELSEA, LIVERPOOL, MANCHESTER CITY, MANCHESTER UNITED & TOTTENHAM. Greed PURE GREED 😡
This is turning football into the NFL with no consequences for playing poorly. the clubs as it is struggle against the likes of Burnley and Fulham A straight money grab during a pandemic and you have Leicester and West Ham who don’t get a chance but are higher than the so called big six. Disgraceful
Been supporting Chelsea my whole life and I'm considering a new team.
Solid League tho👀
RIP football April 18 2021
Thats an oof,
Does anyone actually know why they're against this?
An absolute joke. Ripping the heart and soul from the great game. Hang your heads in shame.
Where's that King Lear quote that Cantona used when you need it?
“The poor people in England/Scotland made the sport and the rich ruined it” saw someone on tik tok say this and wanted to say it here because it’s true.
All this money, yet where is the support for grassroots football aye... Kids have to pay to play football these days for Saturday and Sunday leagues, hell they can't play on the street, rarely ever see any footy going on the park and you want 3g or 4g pitches that will be 40-100 quid depending on the size of the pitch...
As long as my players can play for their countries, allowed to compete in other competitions and the league has a relegation and promotion and works in unison with everything else then maybe it won't be as bad as we think but I don't know.
You know what’s funny, I had a weird feeling last night that something bad would happen. My senses were right. Although this was the last thing I would think of. Killing the game right in front of us. Thanks billionaires.     Created by the poor, stolen by the rich
whats so bad about this? honestly asking
Rip
Wtf no one wants this!! It's all about Money for the already Fat Cat owners!!!
being a Leicester fan lookin real nice right now
A total disgrace and an absolute joke. Get out of football.
We have to boycott all these clubs.  It’s going to hurt not watching city in the semi final but they are forcing my hand.   Cunts
Rip Football😭
The Beautiful game is now dead
The owners are collectively so out of touch.
All my life I’ve supported United for what them to turn thier back on me for money 💔 RIPfootball🪦
I’m really disappointed in Man Utd, even when their greatest ever manager doesn’t approve of this so called League, they still went on with it😭😭😭😭😭😭 this is disrespectful to Sir Alex and those who died supporting the badge
I am a 21 year Arsenal fan, is a disgrace to football and the club that the creation of the league. AND SERIOUSLY HOW COME THIS TEAM IS CONSIDERED A BIG TEAM? LIKE WTF
Bayern isn't in it atleast
UEFA does not own the game. One of the most corrupt institutions complaining about greed and money. Football will survive if these big clubs are ruined because of this, or small clubs are ( this happens anyway).
Bayern and psg ❤️
Claude knew it was time to go
Cant believe this after all the history utd have in the prem i might have to start supporting derby my local team and stop watching united at all
I am ashamed to be an Arsenal supporter.  To Bayern and PSG, do not become a part of this unconscionable money grab.
So proud of my club Sunderland rejecting the proposal of this insanity 😭
Every single club involved in this should be excluded for the remainder of their current domestic seasons and places in any European competition. Disgrace.
GET FSG OUT
So this means spurs and arsenal have european football next season?
GET THE GLAZERS KILLED
I am a spurs fan always have been and am really disapointed in daniel levy thought he was one of the rare chairmans that was a football fan and a spurs fan if this goes ahead i will not support tottenham my club of 20 years that grandfather supported in the 1930s im done
These teams should be banned from the champions league
"Yeah it's because of money". 😢😪  Aren't we good enough for you ?
Some of Europes top teams.....and Spurs.
I'm heartbroken seriously heartbroken I already support a bottle job team I just think after 13 years or supporting them I can't do this anymore 💔 R.I.P Football mark the date everyone Monday 19th April 2021 the day football died forever (Any other teams accept me 😞💔)
Arsenal can’t even beat Fulham, but they want to join a League where they’ll play Barcelona or Real Madrid on weekly basis 😂
Well, today is the day I become a Walsall fan
If this happens then every other football team might as well cease to exist
Will they not be playing in the Premier league anymore??
As a Man utd fan, I am now done with the club. You may call me plastic or a fake fan, but I am no longer following this club or any other club now. This fantastic beautiful game has now just been made ugly and I’m done with it. Cheers joe glazer you wanker
Disgraceful. Embarrassing. Heartbreaking.    Champions league 2025: Mighty Burnley vs. world-class Malaga.
Inter Milan  Ac Milan Tottenham  Arsenal  Chelsea  Manchester United   Must me over the moon tonight. What a sell out.
Cheers, sons crying
People will complain but will still watch the super league
i cant believe this as a dormund fan, whats happening with football rn??
Supporting West Ham now
I don't agree with the super league , but if it happens we will watch our clubs play at the end of the day
This is the time fans of the biggest clubs in the world should unite to boycott this
If you don't boycott your club if they're part of this then your complicit in the destruction of football as we know it in Europe.
If we all agree to never watch any of these games maybe they will cancel this
As an American who doesn't know much about association football, can someone explain to me why this is such a big deal?
Who invited Arsenal lol. They're literally a banter club.
Every football fan is now supporting PSG
I wonder will they ban any players from international football
What an L for football
to all the fans crying about the super league? GROW UP!!  The best teams in Europe are going to compete against each other, Teams that have been held down by these team dominance domestically will now have a chance to be the best and maybe even join the super league in the future. this is evolution, this is how so people reacted to the idea of the "Premiership" and that was successful, it's 2021 and it's time for the next step, and yeah maybe it will fail and you can be your high horses gloating but at least it was tried.
THEY JUST KILLED FOOTBALL.
good , the best should only play the best
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!! STORM THE CLUBS AND THREATEN OR (KILL) THE OWNERS! THIS OUR TEAMS NOT THEIRS!! LET'S GOOOOOO
Im a Leicester fan now
RIP Premier League
So 12 founding clubs, and 12 more open spots for clubs who compete their way into the super league thru domestic league competitions.
This makes me sick to my stomach. Just pathetic.
As a Real Madrid supporter, I now hope PSG win the. CL this season...
Americans have entered football lol
Fines and points deductions
Not a big deal it's not going to happen ..  infact these "big" clubs owners are idiotic for even thinking it could work
For all the local fans. You aint important. It's global entertainment. €3.5bn each club? They don't care if you never go to a game again. You'll be replaced by tourists.
Kick 🦵 them ALL to the curve ⚽️!
Sounds like an 8 year old dreamed this up
Let's be honest, we're all just customers; we always were.
Assuming the super league is in addition to the current competitions these clubs are playing, I don't understand why people think they're betraying the fans. Genuine curiosity if someone could explain their viewpoint
Sounds league another cup competition of the elites?
Without any relegation, this would be the worst league.
So this means these clubs won't compete in PL anymore?
It's all about money 💰💰
Ruins the prem for the others in it and those of us who only dreamed of promotion to the top flight. Taken
Massive respect to the clubs that have rejected this. You know what football is really about and what it means to the fans .
I feel like I lost a child. Something I’ve loved so tenderly for years has now passed away and at this moment I deal with the grief of memories that will I never experience again.  Thank you premier league for being a part of my life every year, nearly every weekend, for almost 15 years of my life.
Problem is all these foreign owners of the big clubs who have no idea of the history of the game.
it doesnt matter if 7 billion people hated this idea. the fact that 15 billionaires like it is the issue.
kick em out
PSG got a new fan
So proud i m psg fan , after all the badmouthing we go through
Scum all of them
Football I’m breaking up with you
You have got Dover who can't do their games as they do not have enough money to put a team out and then you have teams who want to be in a super league to get more money when they already have billions. RIP to the beautiful game 😭
I don't remember this being a desire of mine
I hope the glaziers fuckoff out of United they are destroying the club
If there are any liverpool fans thinking of jumping ship and supporting Everton instead of that absolute embarrassment of a club of yours don't bother im sure Tranmere Roberts will take you though 😂😂
Bye liverpool gonna support Westham
Wow. Just wow.
I support it
The death of football. The rise of soccer 😔
I started to support everton in June, aside from Real Madrid. Now I’m considering dropping Real Madrid for good and following a normal club like Everton.
As a lifelong Chelsea fan and a former head of a supporters club I am 100 percent against this. I don't know of any Chelsea supporter who isn't.  It is a dark day for our club after a great performance and result yesterday.
If Aston Villa did this id never support them again. Thank you Villa. I love you. win or lose on wedesday, even if we get smashed, ive never been prouder to be a Villa fan. i took this club for granted and maybe expected a bit too much at times but thats what football was about. maybe not anymore. Grealish please dont sell your soul and join one of them clubs. we love you.
Why do it
🤦 Man city why am I not even surprised ya'll being listed here . 10 years of supporting  city, they never failed  to amaze me. It's not all about the money. I even respect bayern and psg for rejecting the offer
So 3.5 billion for each club involved?
They will just blast to the top winning 10-0 on a daily
The solution is simple, UEFA, FIFA and all national FAs should ban all these teams from their competitions, any player who plays in this league should be banned from ever playing in any national team and any FA teams. Basically any player that plays in this league can only play in that league but nowhere else. Fans should boycott the teams and major tv outlets should not broadcast the games, maybe the governments should not issue broadcast rights in their respective nations. As a Chelsea fan, I would quit Chelsea and look for another team to support in the premier league. This is just  bullocks, not interested in watching this league.
It means they won't play in national leagues (PL, Seria A, La Liga) anymore? Or they won't play in UCL?
After supporting Liverpool for over 15 years, i cannot keep supporting them after seeing this. This is a disgrace and football has died tonight.
We love you Leeds
Support a real team :Leeds United
Never thought I’d say this but I’m glad I was raise to be a west Ham fan 😂
Every team gets 3.5 billion , our game is ruined , all football fans need to come together and go against it
Money is power...
Florentino Perez is an extreme sociopath and narcissist. He looks like a vampire that will suck the blood out of everything good
Good news for arsenal😂😂
Finally not power to UEFA. Vamos Perez
Ban these clubs from there leagues honestly this is disgraceful. If they don’t feel like there leagues are enough for them. Get them out. They want to be greedy let them do what they want in there new league. Can’t believe this
Well.. Fifa 22 should be interesting 🤔
Fan of this proposal or not??
Absolutely disgraceful, heart and soul absolutely ripped out. Arsenal, Man utd etc should all be relegated from the Premier League and fined.
Yo let's go watch basketball or cricket
No bundesliga club. They didnt want to take part at something like this
The fact that they didn't even let their fans have a say
Absolute idiots Chelsea you are an utter disgrace for signing up along with the other 11 and 5 from the premier league. Well done you took the people’s game from the people.   R.I.P Football....
Ban them all now.
So why didn't they focus that in the Club World Cup
I support west ham now.. Go Lingardinho!!
I'm just baffled.Dont know what to say.
Just kick them out of the premier league. It might actually be more interesting without the Big 6 winning every year.
Heres me nearly crying cuz i have supporter man u since i was born
Time to sit back and watch the top 12 clubs  European Super League   Let's go!!!!
Made by the poor stolen by the rich
Serious question as I have only been following football for a couple of years, how big a deal is this? Is it an argument that comes up every few years or is it bigger than that?
Been an arsenal fan since 2001 and I’ve just decided to burn all my jersey of our greedy club! Absolute disgrace from a bunch of pocket filling owners! Well done to PSG, Bayern, and Dortmund to sticking to principles. I envy you as a former Arsenal fan
as a QPR fan i would like to welcome all that stop supporting their club after this
I’m a Spurs fan and who the hell do they think they are we are not even going to qualify for Europe we are behind west ham Leicester two aspiring clubs who deserve to be in this league more than us at the minute this is purely based on the financial backing behind the clubs complete greed .
So disgusted as a Barca fan, this is absolutely shameful
If any of you fans of these teams needs refuge in a new team westbromwich albion will welcome you happily
Out of curiosity, how much would each club earn through the European Super League?
Vardy gnna have a party in the pl again
Beyond ashamed of now what's no longer my team⭕.Truly, truly disgusting.
As a United fan, I am never going to watch this. They sold our history. That is unforgivable
Isn't this a step away from champs league with the same commitment to the league??  I think that's a good move if that's what it is... Uefa and fifa corrupt and living off big clubs..  I have no idea how this is gona work and my 1st thought was same as every1 else but if all they're doing is refusing to pay and commit to Uefa commitments then I don't see anything wrong with that...
6:33 “Yeah, this is about money” 💔 - so sad to see football being buried alive by greed and  money
It's greed, just pure greed. A ploy to keep the biggest clubs at the top. It just takes the competitive edge away from your clubs like Leeds Utd to Granada FC. As a soccer fanatic and Liverpool  supporter, I have a sour taste in my mouth.
First Var and now this  R.i.p football
Sad sad sad
This is unnecessary
Useless Arsenal. Not shocked.
Ok so im now supporting leicster city
Time to support Grimsby Town
I feel so bad for teams like Aston Villa West Ham cause all the clubs in the super league are going to get all there best players
I hope all these premier league teams are stripped of their positions, fined and worse. Don’t even know what to say about the players obviously it’s out of their control but just can’t imagine playing for one of these teams after this.
Money is the root of all evil.
Everyone start supporting your local teams. We have the numbers, we can damage these greedy bastards in a way in which they would have never imagined. Do the right thing.
Football should be free. Not confined to specific teams regardless of their performance.  One example is Leicester which is currently better than Arsenal.
Eggggsaladddd 👴👏
You know it's fucked up when JP Morgan is involved.
I've Always had a Dream Of Supporting Leeds FC!!
yes... bring it on.. people who say it is the death of football are just hating
This is a fuckin joke money is all they care about I'm disgsuted by tottenham for even considering joining i hope those of higher powers do everything in there power to prevent this from happening i agree with everything gary
Disgusted as a Chelsea fan.
Respect to John McGinn who rejected the invite 👑
Ajax is bigger than half the clubs there yet no invite???😂😂
RIP Football, We had good times together, At least they can't take that away from me.
It’s also worth mentioning that we can’t blame the players and coaches for their club’s choices. It’s all coming from above and by the different administration. A way that players can protest against this nonsense is to move to a different club. That’s the only way which I can see the players protesting(I hope that this is going to happen)
Am I the only one that hates international breaks? I love football especially the premier league but this is just more football for me and anyone who thinks like me! They said there will be financial ramifications etc. I dont care about that...I just want to enjoy more football. Also it is not like the EPL was paying fans. I don't think anything to do with money affects fans in any way. I maybe wrong but I personally don't see that now!
From the success of Busby, Ferguson and the many memories and achievements the whole club worked and earned for is literally just pissed down the drain just like that I can’t believe it and my whole life I’ve been a United fan, I will never wear or support United ever again absolute disgrace our club just gone like that
If your club is involved in this disaster and you still support them then you don’t care about football.
PSG’s owner owns BEIN Sports which show UEFA champions league games. Bayern also have significant resources tied to the champions league. That’s the only reason they both refuse to join.
Complete disgrace. Anyone who supports this isn't a true football fan, or even a fan of proper competitive integrity.
My heart is broke RIP Liverpool FC.  What is ironic about this is that all these ‘big clubs’ were small at one stage. Torino were the biggest in Italy, Preston & Aston Villa were huge in the 19th century ect.
we have the power. boycott this Shitty League. then they will turn back to UCL
Football was ruined the moment PSG paid over £200 million to take Neymar away from Barcelona. There's no cap on wages and transfer fees. Clubs have to make money somewhere
The working mans sport has been hijacked by the billionaires club rip European football dominance
Club fans: This is embarrassing hopefully we dont take part, otherwise am not a fan anymore Club owners: adios mf
Extremely disappointed in my dear club Milan, made and supported by the poor and middle class we choose to join a league made because people want more money. Not the Milan I support.
I'm all for European heavyweights playing each other more often but this is not how you do it
This wouldn’t be happening if it wasn’t for the pandemic, fans would be holding mass protests outside stadiums etc, disgusted by LFC talk about going against fans wishes.
3.5b 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good to see no German teams give in to this absolute fast
This is the great reset ! It’s not just a fake and planned pandemic this is a new world we are going into where the rich get richer and the poorer are left to fend for themselves !!! Wake up and realise what’s going on around you people, corruption and money are all around you and ultimately a select group of billionaires and global elite decide how the masses live 😢
I hope Benfica doesnt participate in this...
Good to see so many fans showing their support of football, rather than the big clubs
This is a disgrace they have broke so many fans hearts it’s ridiculous
All these people have done is stolen the brands of those 6 clubs involved and are moving them abroad.   The beauty of football is seeing smaller clubs compete. Seeing a youngster from a Norwich or Leeds make the England team. Seeing Leicester win the league through sheer determination....Im glad Im not a supporter of one of them so called top 6 (Spurs and Arsenal in there is laughable aswel). Gary Neville is right, relegate them all
I don't know how to feel about this.
The end is near.
Top 6 = Top 6 sell outs 3.5 billion each come on disgraceful
"Created by the poor stolen by the rich"
I was a Liverpool fan for 31 years, up until an hour ago when they released the statement confirming the news. A football fan no more. Shall be burning my Jersey's tomorrow. Haven't even got the balls to announce such a thing with full stadiums. Burn in hell FSG and John W. Henry.
wanting to buy player + No money = Yes to super league / football clubs now just brands. sad day.
As said. I hope that UEFA and FIFA bans the clubs/players from entering in competitions which they solely represent. Thus meaning that Chelsea, City, Real Madrid will be banned from Champions League
Typical american owner.. Money money... All liverpool fans support Everton.. Maybe we can get a 80 thousand staduim built instead.
Makes me sick to say I'm a man utd fan  and it angers me I pray and hope all teams and fans of football stay strong and fight this horrible group of people and there greediness all about money and not football
I’m in the minority. I could be wrong but I want more football and more competition between big clubs
This league is a great idea and good for football. FIFA is behaving like a tyrant. They can both coexist
Well done you've just killed football.
Wht would arsenal agree to this....we are no were prepared...this is why the Kronkes are trash...if they loved the club they would never put us in a shitty situation!!!!!.......Glazers suck too...
I mean the big thing is that jp Morgan is ready to underwrite this by 6 billions euro,that means that from business point' of view,even some financial people think this has potential,this is the real threat for existing football system',because you can't say straight away to the big six to f*Ck off from pl,who Will watch pl without man u, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and man city,who Will watch la liga without duo clasico,who Will watch serie a without their biggest 3 teams  But there's a light for UEFA, FIFA, PL etc in this game,the fact that haaland and mbappe don't play in founding clubs of this ESL right now,if these 2 guys keep on playing outside these 12 founding clubs,that Will be a weapon to fight this ESL proposal
The footballing god really doesn't want west ham to play in the champions league. Or at least not a good one. Lol
Lads, at least we can savour the beautiful game that once was. Future generations won't realise how much heart went into this game, when it was made by the poor, but stolen by the rich.
just punish all of them except for chelsea
I would still watch this tho
So spurs will never win the premier league? Lol
Money has ruined football as we know it dagger to the heart this as my Club was born out of famine and oppression to feed the poor and help poor of what is still to this day one of the most deprived areas in Europe was not created for money so glad my club is not in this super league If I was a player I would not play in this.
The dream that a club can start from the bottom and reach the highest point of the pyramid is dead
Bye bye football 👋
Utter greed
The fact it has no relegation means its a joke.. Silly American style league.. Guaranteed money every year with no chance of losing it.. What will happen then.? The biggest clubs only become even bigger with even more money to spend than the smaller clubs. you cannot run this next to the major leagues, it just puts everyone else at an even bigger disadvantage, the fun of the major leagues is the chance of a team like leicester city having the chance to win the league or west ham getting into champions league.. this will take that away.. same clubs every year in champions league & super league.. I would BAN them from the major leagues BAN them from playing in the any Uefa or Fifa comps.. any players playing in an unsanctioned league do not qualify to play in the world cups.. and when it goes tits up and they want to come back put them in the conference.. saying it will help all clubs and its what the fans want.. sorry but BuIIshit!
Three and a half BILLIONS... (speechless) sums it all.
As a Chelsea fan, I'm both ashamed and disappointed with my club...
Honestly I think it is so f***ING stupid and poor form most teams including man city I am so upset with them  I am a city fan
German and French League views 📈📈
all about money....nothing else.
All these teams should be fined and deducted points . As a united fan I am disgusted.
Those are the teams we all watch either way...so we what’s the problem? No one wants to watch Burnley or Stoke or even Newcastle...we watch these leagues to watch the best teams compete.... even with all the possible threats the FA can bring to the teams, we just don’t care anymore...besides no one considers the level of investment the owners have put into the teams...just because they are billionaires does that mean they should lose money?
FIFA talking about banning players from the World Cup is legitimately the best idea the most globally corrupt organisation has ever had
Lol.     You can't stop this moving train, sky, you can't.
the next step is to move those clubs to the US, Dubai, Japan, and China where they can generate more income, ticket prices will go to the roof so the average fan cannot afford them, so it's going to be all corporate
Should happen, would be better than UEFA
not happy with the whole thing but biggest question is why TOTTENHAM? they don't have the history, trophies or the strength to even be considered top 6.
As a Chelsea fan, I'm absolutely disgusted.
This just sounds boring
It is environmentally damaging with all the travelling. Sponsors like the Emirates and Qatar Airways must love it.
I'm absolutely ashamed to be a Chelsea fan tonight. I'm so sorry to every other club in England and Europe. Us and 5 other clubs in the premier league are being totally out of order and just money grabbing. Honestly I'm gutted.
This will end up like the chinese league. Too much money with too little a following. Eventually these sorry excuses for football clubs will come crawling back to uefa and will start at the very bottom of the football pyramid
Man I'm done with arsenal I don't even know why we in it when we're gonna get battered  Bristol city here i come
Good bye Arsenal, hi Leeds
52.5 billion will be given to the 15 founding clubs all together. Where they gonna take that money
I’m disgusted at Liverpool
I will no longer be watching football if this goes ahead, we all LOVE our national leagues. The is all about MONEY. I hope fans can unite against this - do not pay to watch any of it either in person or on TV, we need to boycott this.Disgusting treatment of the fans. Have supported Liverpool all my life, this is awful.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY... THESE PEOPLE ARE GREEDY
I’ve loved football and been a city fan for the entirety of my life but if this happens I’m done, Football is dead
I blame united mainly, glazers grabbing more power they allowed it to get to this point by not boycotting them while they had so many chances
Why is the super league a bad idea? Genuinely asking. Thanks in advance!
This is a football cartel
Because money matters, football doesn't. P.I.G.S  🐷
It's unsustainable without any fan support, no one will watch, zero revenue, no players will participate. Astounding how many fans are so willing to quit supporting their club rather than taking the fight to the elite who have hijacked their clubs and are defying their fan base with these greedy selfish decisions. Utd till I die I'll go down with the ship if needs be
As a spurs fan experts in bottling the thought process behind this was none. Struggling to even get into the prem top 4 and they think they can dance with Real Madrid on a weekly just absurd
Spurs are not a big club, big spenders?. Yes, FACT.
Tbh if they are truly helping the smaller clubs and remove the safety of the founders and move it to end of season-preseason tournament id be down
ill stop watching my team if this shite goes ahead
Rest In Peace Football. Thank you for everything
Watching my beloved football club join the Super League is heartbreaking, I burn the kits and every single merchandise that i have   Today I'm going to support Portsmouth now, come on Pompey!!!
How are spurs involved when was last time they won anything? League cup some time in the naughties, and early to mid at that, Juande Ramos won it with Martin Jol's team. And city haven't won the champions league yet so not a true elite European heavyweight yet, real Madrid are fascists.
I wonder if they’ve considered whether the paying public will actually buy the product they’re trying to sell? Globally, the demand must be there... but I very much doubt British fans will want any part of it. I, for one, won’t be buying or watching. Why would I give two hoots about who wins this “Euro Super League”?
GREED, GREED, GREED. humanity's greatest weakness.
Absolutely detestable from those 12 clubs. GREEDY!
As an Arsenal fan they don't need any more money to spend on Chelsea's rejects.
We should have riots
What a time to be alive
Today I become an Accrington Stanley supporter
This will be a civil war; are there clubs that are bigger than football itself? Let's see.
U can buy everything but not our hearts
Wouldn’t mind 3.5 billion tbf
Glazers destroying everything that Man United Believe in
just reiterates that Everton are really the people's club. However, would be interesting to see if anyone else was invited and said no and on what grounds contributed to that decision
I'm supporting bloody Burnley at this rate.
As an angry ivorian once said: ITS A DISGRACE
Fans time to vote with our feet, no more going to games no more merchandise, bloddy sell outs. Im an arsenal fan and i think this is disgusting, the prem has like 5 teams not in the big six that are better than us. We havent been in a champions league for a couple years and know just peel off. What a joke if this happens that will be it for i think alot of fans.
Let’s be honest Tottenham only signed up so they can be recognised as a big team lol
No matter the teams we support, this atrocious decision goes against what football stands for. It is not what it “stood” for, becasue the game made for everyone who has passion stands strong at this very moment for those who are not in ESL. ESL has no history, and will not have legitimate future because the It is merely a monetary organization, no more no less, disguised behind the facade of “competitive” football. Shame on clubs, heart broken for players, and speachless for true fans of the game. Must unite together.
it’s time to support west ham
One of the reason's I love football is the grassroots elements of the sport. This will kill off football as we know it, it's only about money now.
The games gone  First Takeovers Then Var Now This💔😭 If this goes ahead I’m not supporting Liverpool anymore I’m not supporting Southampton Something needs to change right now
Never have i been morr proud of being a bayern fan
This is crazy man
The world needs to boycott all their games
I mean is any player really going to want to play in this? They'll be banned from playing in essentially all other competitions. Players won't even be able to represent their nations. They'll be playing the odd game midweek, it would be what, 28 games a year if each team plays each other twice.
Boycott
For the first time in my life , I’m disgusted to say I’m a chelsea fan
Execute everyone responsible for this.  FIFA please stand up to this
Absolutely terrible
So disappointed. Stripping away familiarity. Football is already the worlds most popular sport. Why does this need to exist?
THIS IS BOLLOXS!!!! I am dissapointed with LIVERPOOL!!!!
A disgrace, nobody who really cares about football can support this.
Boycott the Americans who are taking over European football. They even call it soccer, what a disgrace
Simple. No one should attend those matches nor watch it on tele
Mark my words. This is the death of football.
RIP Football, thanks for the memories
Ruining the game that we all love 😪😪😪
There is nothing wrong about this They are just adding a new league to bring more competition. The premier league will still have all the clubs
All the 12 disgraceful clubs should be banned from their domestic leagues ASAP.
If the EPL were to ban Arsenal FC from Premier League, I would be totally fine with that.
What happens when money matters more than the fans, the history, and league. So disappointed in United. Capitalism run amok, Its Disgraceful.
Every single player in the top 6 should hand in transfer requests tomorrow morning and go on strike. Don’t kiss the badge, lads. Be men. This is a total fiasco. After 46 years of watching the Newcastle, I’m done. Sir Matt, Sir Bobby and Bill Shankly will be spinning in their graves. Shame on those who signed off on this.
Arsenal can't even win against Crystal Palace 😭😭
As a Benfica fan this is tough news. It’s not even that we can’t qualify for it. I just always dreamt of my team winning the UCL. Or at least the Europa. But now that’s definitely not gonna happen. I know that it’s unlikely but that’s the point of football. If Leicester can win the premier league or Monaco can win Ligue 1, then we can do it too. But now it’s just the rich trying to get richer. How original
Not sure I understand how this is earth shattering news, this has been openly talked about for roughly a decade, the game has to evolve and obviously it was gonna be the European big boys that made the move. Could it be a disaster, yes. Could it be a success, yes. But let’s dial down the moral outrage over businesses doing business.
Football is dead.Down with the money league!!!
As a Liverpool fan I'm absolutely delighted with this news. I know there will be a lot of jealousy from other teams but every team in the new competition deserves their place as we all bring massive viewing figures. Each team will apparently get £3bn...some of that will inevitably bleed down to the smaller 14 Premier League clubs! YNWA
This is a point which will show who will blink first...the "big clubs" or the associations. These clubs monopolise the star players. who do you want to watch playing week in week out...
Just imagine all the clubs get their money for signing up of this league then play their U-21 youth team. I’d be so satisfied to see that lmao
I’ve no interest in watching Chelsea play Juventus 15 times in 2 yrs
I haven't waited 16 years to get back in the Premier league for it to all fall apart the following season. This is a joke
This is disgusting and no-one should condone this
I’m confused. What’s occurring within the league?
Premier League and UEFA,  you created this monster where just a few clubs dominate. And now look what's happened. RIP football
this is bad
This is a fukin disgrace! Dock the dirty money grabbing whores points and fine them massively... this is thr most disgusting thing football clubs have ever been a part of... i hope the Liverpool fans come out and condemn this, im an everton fan and i wouldnt want this for my 9wn team its just wrong and i dont want people from my city supporting this absolute joke regardless of red or blue
Football was fine as it is we have champions league for big games this is acc embarrassing
Greed taken to new level, fans and football forgotten by those signing up for European Super League and furthermore disgusting that my own club are involved. This will be the final nail in the coffin for football
The ONLY things these ‘owners’ care about is the money..................So BOYCOTT the hell out of them. Don’t buy anything. Don’t renew season tickets or spend a penny on these 6 clubs. As a supporter it will be hard. BUT look at it as short term pain for a long term gain. Deprive them of cash................They just might them get the message
Bye Liverpool hello Aston Villa
the rich always wins
This is a business idea not Football at all.
Imagine Arsenal having a fixture list of:        1.Real. 2.Barcelona.3.Juventus🤣🤣🤣
Football used to be interesting now it’s just a elite sport
You are having an absolute LAUGH!
Boycott the Super League games and don't pay to watch them on the TV. Let them breakaway, relegate them to League 2, in years they'll beg to get reinstated back into the CL.
Iv watched city since I was 3 years old, been proud to say I'm a blue every day of my life but today I am not ! Especially from out history we should know better disgusting !
Basically segregation, where the 'big clubs' consider themselves untouchable so they decide to form their own league without considering or respecting other clubs and the leagues that gave them the platform to become successful.  Disgusting from all the clubs involved, the rich just satisfying their greed and filling their pockets. Football is nothing without the fans.
When fans are given the go ahead they can return to stadiums, fans of these "founding" teams should not do so. Teach these greedy fucks a lesson
?
I hope the respective FA's throw the book at them immediately.
I’ve never had more respect for  Bayern in my life, true class shown by a club that values football and it’s principals, psg are only not there cause there tied up in tv money. The rest of these clubs are disgusting faceless business who couldn’t care less about football and what it’s true values are
This BS might be the cause we all end up uniting around... the #1 sport globally is being attacked and we need to stand against this money grabbing
I dont get it? Isit a new premier league or a new champs league?
This is a rare opportunity to switch teams, torn between Wolves, West Ham & Everton.
Brentford winning them prem, lets goooooo🐝🐝🐝🐝
The fact the team I support (spurs) takes part in something like this goes against every reason why I would support them, they sold out and I can't back this decision, they play a single game of this I won't stay to see how well they do
Lol Arsenal in the super league? Free wins for everyone. But respect to Bayern for rejecting 💯
If this goes ahead it officially be the end of football history ffs 😭
As a recent fan of Spurs, I knew we were desperate for a trophy, but to join this league that fabricates this idea of a "football team hierarchy" for the sake of having big teams compete every week is blasphemous. Full respect to PSG, Bayern, and Dortmund who have not agreed to this as of this moment.
In all seriousness boycott your teams dont by merch dont watch matches dont by ticket the whole thing is for money and if they dont get it theyll have to turn back
Say goodbye to football ppl
I don't get what is all this
So they not going to be playing in the premier league then ?
Just withdrawn my support for Liverpool FC
As a Saints fan for the past 7 years, I  feel bad for fans of the English Teams that joined, it's an absolute disgrace tbh, I can't even comprehend as to why they'd agreed to join *sigh*.
UEFA and the FA will cave and let them have it so that they can get a slice of the pie... Just like the Premier league all those years ago. I really hope I'm wrong and they get brutal and shut it down but money talks
Ras Arsenal gonna be the new Italy of the six nations 🤣🤣
im a spurs fan and we are utter sh*t rn, we dont even deserve to be in this. its ridiculous!
The game that we love is gone 😞
Super league isn't it the Turkish league?
Can someone please explain why this is a bad idea? Thanks
I sense the End.
I dont understand why the players are to be punished
Nothing but pain
“They will get €3 and a half billion a year”  That’s all it’s about.
It ain’t a sport it’s a business the elites have fucked everything up for us
WHY.......
I hear your watching that "Super League" now Father Ted.. What's the churches stance on this? Are we all expected to watch it aswell?!!
I don’t get it, if they break away, will they stop being in the champions league as well as their home leagues? I mean if it’s just a league on its own, why can’t we have all as well as this new one? Somebody please explain
Thats it footballs fucked
We as fans need to boycott the games when we are allowed back in the stadium. This is a DISGRACE and GREED!!! Football is for the fans and this is not responding to the fans desire because we did NOT REQUEST IT OR WANT IT!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Nobody is asking why Tottenham is included? When was the last time they won anything in Europe?
As a United fan... if this is the direction the clubs going... I never want to see them in the premier league again, in my eyes, they no longer deserve it
Multiple things go through my mind hearing about this.   First of,if this is like a champions League 2.0 (they continue to play to their respective national comps for example premier league, fa cup etc) what is the real problem? They get more revenue and we get more "high quality" games. Secondly the only reason uefa Will step in and try to stop this, is because they know they Will lose money, they dont care about football, most likely uefa Will back out and let them do this after they get a good share of the revenue Lastly i heard that bayern dortmund and leipzig havent decided 100% so we might see them also in there.  Hopefully whatever happens Will be optimal for the majority of teams/fans/orgs
Rip
If it goes ahead we should show them what we think by not paying to watch the games . Period! Without money it will flop big time.
They already have these teams playing each other in the Champions League, this is an awful move.
Arsenal🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am so angry at the Owners. FREAK THEM
Embarrassed to be a Liverpool fan
Simple solution: stop supporting your billionaire club, if you supporr one (cancel membership, cancel season tickets, don't buy shirts, etc.) and instead support your local club and support them with your money 👍🏻
Like how they think people want this
I am absolutely gutted to see this league even commence was a life long barca and city fan and now i am ashamed and disappointed
just another small stepping stone toward the majority being completely and totally left behind.
Bayern Munich and Leipzig just joined
I wanna cry
European super legue is sick
I don’t see the problem. The domestic leagues will continue as is. This is just a replacement league to the champions league, just higher quality and better games. Smart move.
This Super League is just erase all Football History. RIP FOOTBALL
Glazers out
How dumb are united they just got good n cudve won the Prem this season if they stayed n City left man soo bloody daft who will watch it now man
I will actually stop supporting man United if this happens. Sad. Thought i never see the day
The premier league teams in next years champions league are going to be hilarious.. West Ham, Leeds, Everton,Aston Villa.... let that sink in 😂 big night of European football we’ve got Aston Villa Vs Real Sociadad in the Champions league final 🤦‍♂️
premier league created this monster thats happens when you invite americans to the party, they only see profit once a game for the common person now a game for the elite
Never been this disappointed, disgusted and embarrassed to support Liverpool FC
As life long Man Utd fan, I've had some great memories supporting this club. However, I cannot support the club with this. The league wins have been amazing because of the footballing rivalries and the competition all the teams have provided in the league. They've basically looked at us fans and said we don't care about you, just give us your money. I don't intend to go to any further Man Utd games if they're in this competition and nor will I purchase any merchandise and that hurts me deeply 💔
Does this mean these teams they won’t be in the respective leagues?
they can rejoin in the vanarama national league when it goes wrong
Well us spurs supporters weren't playing on winning a trophy anyways
I've been a Liverpool fan since a young boy. This has got me seriously questioning my allegiances to the club. My club is on the wrong side of history
This is A Disgrace!!!!! I can’t be bothered to even watch my team any more it’s all about money now isn’t it I am now no longer interested in football and I hope one day our football will be back😔
I think Arsenal being there is the biggest insult ever 😂😂
Created off money and greed exactly the same the Champions League and Premier League were.
this sport we all love is going down the shitter, being Americanized, bunch of greedy Wankers
The reason Bayern and PSG didn’t join it is cause they have a 1 team league so they just will keep on winning there own tittles where like English clubs and Spanish etc have harder leagues
First football became a none contact sport, then VAR! Now this, final nail in the coffin for football. Sad to see.
As much as I am sad to see this, what the Super League is trying to do is copy the financial success model of the NBA and F1. Sure, there are other basketball or racing series, but the one people want to watch are the elite competitions like NBA, or F1. On the business side, every major broadcast companies would want to sign the rights to play the Super League matches, which will result in big revenue. This will then attract bigger sponsor payouts. So, bigger revenue means higher salary wages, which then attracts the best players to play. FIFA and UEFA can ban these players from the World Cup or Euros all they want, but at the end of the day players play for the paycheck. In the future, kids around the world will grow up and dream of playing in the Super League. International competitions will be a non factor as the glamour and the glitz of fame and fortune can only come from playing in the Super League. As for the grassroots to find future talents, these elite clubs will be able to set up academies and youth competitions throughout the world to ensure the best talents only play in the Super League.
Was fun being a Man U fan! Football will never be the same anymore if this goes through, I will not be supporting Man Utd anymore if this goes through....
Can't believe that Arsenal of all teams have agreed to this
As a Liverpool fan... WTF..... Sorry,  but I will not be Walking with you, on this one.....
Good bye my beloved Manchester United! Going to Leeds United!!!!
I hope players in these club begin a boycotte.
The clubs only care about money let’s go psg and Bayern for rejecting the offers
I was spurs fan one day ago..
Why!!!!!!!! Football is perfect just the way it is, we don’t want this and we surely don’t need this, what happened to the love of this game all that history is going down the drain with this so called super league
It's only an alternative to champions league.  Nobody wants to lose the biggest teams in their respective leagues
Where were you the day the beautiful game died?
Arsenal can't win in the epl how we gonna win in this super league this is a shame
Football: Created by the poor stolen by the rich
This is about money. We all must stop supporting these clubs and teach them a lesson . We are their fans becoz what they are and how they play football, not by looking at their bank accounts. They are just trying to kill football and being a socio, they didn’t ask my permission before they agree to anything... either I will no longer a socio or my club never gonna play in such league... let’s see who wins ...
Screw the EPL for the ESL, football is dead now.
Relegate them all now
Yes....finally....FIFA and UEFA will no longer bully clubs...
Hell yes!!
You sold the fans out iam disgusted it makes me feel sick.
Well ex football fan here. Have fun lads.
relax, it will never succeed. Many players will reject it because they want the World Cup, and the strain will tear clubs apart. Many will move to big clubs who rejected it, like PSG, Munich. Kane being one..and then the trickle will turn to a rush and then its all over. Super League finished.
Arsenal buzzing, it's their only way to get back in to a European competition 😂
Let’s boycott and not watch the crock of shite 🤣 absolutely disgusting. Teams who know better. Abysmal
I'm abandoning my support for Tottenham because of this. The idea of a Super League is absolutely appalling.
Well 100 years for a lot of clubs and history of football now gone because of money 💰
I’m old enough to remember when it was actually English 😂😂😂😂
No one asked for this super league nonsense, absolutely disgusting!
What a disgraceful decision. None of the mega rich care  about how we feel about this as fans. I am a Liverpool fan and it is disgusting to see this go through. Is our proud history flushed down the toilet now? The 19 league titles, 6 champions leagues, Club World Cup, 8 league cups, 7 FA cup, 3 UEFA Cups, 4 Super Cups, and 15 Community shields, does it all count for nothing now?I feel so bad for all the other teams who are also big clubs in the PL and everywhere else that their history counts for nothing because they aren’t rich enough. Money and greed has swallowed the game I love, and this is an absolute farce. And the audacity to do it mid season, disgusting
Theyre lucky this was announced before fans are allowed to be back in stadiums
You'll still get fans going to support them and this is why it will go ahead. People are weak minded. They will moan now but forget about it down the line
Looks like I'm off supporting Tranmere now then eh, can't believe my club is part of this.
And the people who created this stupid league know how upset people are but of course they don’t care because they get money. This is terrible
wow is all i have to say.   wow
Shocking that my club, Manchester Utd is doing this, fans need to come together and stop this like when they wanted £15 per game during the pandemic , disgusted by the greed
Absolutely terrible.
They turned on the fans
Sell ur souls
Total disgrace always money over football
👎👎👎👎
As a culé my heart is sinking
It's sad and disgusting all they care about is money I'm embarrassed to be a chelsea fan right now
Respect to Bayern Munich
Rest In Peace Football 😥
As a united fan I’m embarrassed for my club
Just look at the owners of each club. This is about money! No real fan would approve of this.  Arsenal have ruined my evening many times.....but never have I felt this disgusted.
RIP Football 1872 -2021
All fans cancel their season tickets !!!
The premier league should disband all clubs that break away from it. Never let them back in and then see what happens. Would kill the sport but these greedy bastards cant keep getting away with it
As an Arsenal fan I’m looking forward to Barcelona putting 6 past us is the like the old days .
This is a disgrace to the whole football community.
Leading football clubs, arsenal and Tottenham when West Ham and Leicester probably deserve it better. Disappointed in Chelsea
I thought my bengals nfl owner was bad for never spending money to get players but it’s better than this absolutely disgusted as a man city fan
If Bayern would join they would lose half of their fans. The end of miasanmia
Am very disappointed with my club chelsea very disappointed
Game's gone! Almost 150 years of sporting culture and heritage being destroyed in the name of corporate gread. Never been so disappointed in my club.
They need to go through the banning of these stupid arrogant teams.
Ladies and gents remember the first division...reap what you sow
The super league is a good idea and will revolutionize football. Only small clubs like liverpool and Arsenal are worried. I speak for everyone when I say YES to the European Super League
water polo is where it's at now  lol
this is worse than covid😔
Ban them out of existence, people need to realise this isnt football. This is a huge money grab
Can any of you crying in the comments explain whats wrong with the proposal? the best should go up against the best i want to watch some quality football and what have i got this sunday? man u vs burnley and real madrid vs getafe. im genuinely interested how the best teams playing against one another is gonna kill football. no teams relegated is a real issue though but the blame is as much on uefa as the teams. anyway i thought 3-5 real top fixtures on a weekend is a dream for us fans but youre all acting like its the end pls explain
Is it confirmed or not
Banned these club for 5 years from the leagues
This is attack on the UEFA instead our own domestic leagues
Am so happy psg said no
Corona virus fast forwarded their plans 😞🤔
If they really do this then boot them out the Premier League and don't ever let them back in....even when their pissy little super league fails,if they want to go then they stay gone. Sidenote...i am wondering what the managers and players are thinking about this...what if the best managers and players don't want anything to do with this because they know how wrong it is and transfer requests get thrown in at these clubs. Edit...Klopp and Ole won't be the managers of Liverpool and Utd they'll tell the owners to f**k off because they know how wrong this is and it's not like they need the money and have to stay
RIP FOOTBALL - ❌❌❌ AJAX AMSTERDAM FAN FOR EVER
Arsenal competing in a 'European Super League' when they struggle to maintain a top half spot in their own domestic league is like trying to swim through mud, shocking.
Good for them
Please just don't
these same clubs blocked newcastle united from being taken over..... football is dead ladies and gentlemen
This is actually unbelievable, this can’t actually happen
Football has officially been destroyed by rich club owners who only care about making even more money what an absolute disgrace.
so if the teams get banned does this mean psg wins the champions league😂
3.5b each or split between the teams ?
I wont watch it. Let it fold n watch them beg to come back to the champions league
Why has Tottenham gotten an invitation
the day football died
No fun seeing the big clubs vs each other every week. Thats why there is the uefa
The irony of a Sky correspondent sneering that " this is all about money" it was sky that started this culture back in 1992..
Give the champions league to psg
Well, time to sell my United shirts and find a new club to support
Lol
A mass boycott is in order here, this is downright CRIMINAL, I'm an ashamed Man United fan, the glazers have ruined football.
There’s literally no gain for any of the players besides a different trophy. I don’t understand how these clubs think financial gain on the owners end will change the fact that players will likely want to leave.
So.pretty much this is league of friendlies among the top clubs....no real competition of gain and losses
JUVE IS GONNA GET SLAPPED😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
SHAME da-ding-da-ding-da-ding (that's the bell for the pig's trough) SHAME da-ding-da-ding-da-ding  SHAME da-ding-da-ding-da-ding SHAME da-ding-da-ding-da-ding SHAME da-ding-da-ding-da-ding
Why would players at these clubs support this if it would mean being banned from their respective national teams and international competitions (World Cup)?
Dock points from those team instantly.
Im glad I'm a newcastle fan
Jack RL Not only have they lost our support, they have lost our respect. Never have I been more disappointed to support Manchester United . RIP Football
the clubs view their fans as people in China and Asia, pot hunters. not fans of the game. with no relation if 2 teams are doing badly play each other - who cares ? next development will be pay games at different stadiums around the world
If you are not performing, you can crate a new league again and again. Bonkers !
With respect, since when did Spurs become a big club? I mean Leicester have won the PL Spurs haven't. That's unfair on Leicester. MUFC fan
Im a united fan and if this happenes i think we and any other BPL clubs should be stripped of all titles and kicked out all other competitions. Greed and money corruptes the world
Time to begin supporting Kiddlington Development Over 56s
Arsenal ain't even a top 8 team. Wtf is this...they can't win the champions league or even get in the competition! Haven't won our own county's league since 2004 ffs! Get real. Get Kronke out!!!
Bombshell.
And just like that, the game is dead.
"You'll never walk alone"  How ironic
This is a sad day for football
Absolutely disgusting.
Shameful.
Not watching a single game or even highlights from this league. I hope these clubs all suffer.
Is this guy really just reading from his phone? .... professionalism?
I blame US nationals buying world Football clubs and trying to bring the NFL system to world Football (soccer).
Yes I have been asking for a long time!! Some people are scared of change.
No kane for euros 🥵
We lost our soul when we left Highbury.
Respect to bayern, dortmund and a few more big Italian clubs for not joining. They know and preserve football culture.  Edit: and psg
I am one of many horrified Liverpool fans! I'm not sure I will have a team if this happens. Do they think that regular supporters can afford to travel around Europe every week to support their team?
It's time to support the clubs that really deserve it Leicester Everton wolves Aston villa Sevilla Atlanta  etc...
I've supported Manchester United all my life and i love the club but im on a 50/50 pledge on whether on continuing my path with this club
That is the final nail in the coffin for me. I hate the non-contact I dislike VAR  , I dislike the lack of English players or even european players. But this stinks.  I am not supporting my club anymore and I now definitely need to find another sport. I love snooker thank god.  I think maybe cricket or Ice hockey.  Yeah Ice hockey might get a few tickets to Some games and start following ice hockey.
How are spurs in the super league
Gonna kms
Fans don't want this. There is no football without fans. Ridiculous and short sighted.
2:00 to our desires huh? We didn't want this, we never did, we never will, why tf would they want this abomination? It's a disgrace to football, and the owners don't have a clue, these people are half the reason Bury got fucked over.
Awesome... just replace arsenal and  tottenham with psg and bayern and it's super
Games gone
I’m just hoping this is a joke for a giant Nike ad
We didn't witness champions league creation We didn't witness world cup creation But today we are witnessing the most powerful league in Europe Don't be sad after all
joe glazer 2 year ago said he took him like 2 years to understand the offside rule and he will be one of the guy running the league
Money grabbing dickheads
This is disgusting
This is a disgrace rip football😔
Somebody please explain to me what consequences do these teams face? Can these teams actually be fired from their leagues? And does this mean these teams are going against the UCL, or they will be competing in both?
I've loved liverpool my entire life, but that's enough.
Supported United all my life absolutely disgusted, pulling my membership and  unfollowing this is me done
Thank the lord for my massive club in a tinpot league WATP 🇬🇧
Am I the only one who's giving this thing a chance?
SMH
Buy buy Chelsea..Milwall ♥️♥️♥️
So it's essentially a hand-picked elitist rich man's club of clubs?.  And all the games will essentially be friendlies because there will be nothing to play for, as no relegation or promotion.
Arsenal and Spurs won’t even finish top 6!! Throw all teams out of the league now
When is the next hockey 🏑 game
'Created by the poor, stolen by the rich. ' 😔
Money money this is all this about. pathetic
Thank God something new. I’m excited. I can’t wait to see a super league with the best teams
Are man city fans against this?😂
As a Leeds fan I never thought i'd be standing side by side with the likes of your man utd fans or chelsea fans etc.
Cant believe that statment was expecting the clubs too distance themselves from this, its the complete opposite
All these comments and people.will still watch. No one boycotting when blood money bought clubs success and all of a  sudden fans acting outraged. What could they expect.
how have arsenal scabbed their way into this
supported arsenal since young😔all of those memories for nothing man. off to wolves i go
If nothing else, the fans are all against this and it may lead to a boycott of the bigger clubs and support for the smaller local clubs who definitely need the help.
I’m relieved I support a club that isn’t part of this Mafia scheme. I could not imagine seeing my club playing in a league like this. I send my deepest condolences to all fans that are affected by this decision.
No more supporting Man Utd. It was good while it lasted ! Time to support another red team- Nottingham Forest!
Just finished reading McMafia... This should be added on as a final chapter.
Man I grew up my whole life having man United win everything and now in recent years I finally got to watch my club liverpool lift the same trophies it was magical, that enjoyment has now been killed...
not gonna lie, outside of football this is a great Bussiness.
You watch FIFA and UEFA crumble in all of this and nothing will happen and the big teams will get their way.
Greed knows no bounds.  Bayern and PSG rejected this. Only big clubs to have a spine. The rest of those "founding" clubs, say goodbye to your fanbase. If this goes through, i am done with Spurs. Sickening and Disgusting.
So other 3 will probably be bayern,dortmund and psg
Wait once you join the super league does that mean your in their forever or just for 1 season and then other teams will join?
Loved creating top Super leagues with all the team involved in the old Top six Arsenal are bearley a top ten team Leicester deserved and would win more games than them.Footballs dead anyways I told everyone get to the top clubs now and I was right R.I.P Premier league YNWA96
Relegate the greedy, grabbing bastards and ban their players form playing at World Cups and Uefa tournaments.
Big up Bayern
Liverpool will rule the super league
Okay bye Chelsea 13 years of supporting you in 19 years of my life is done  Thanks for memories and ups and downs  I will support Borussia Dortmund from now on thank you very much  Hope these team gets their point deducted as a result and relegated to Championship
It won’t happen🤞
It's going to be interesting when Man City lift the Premier League trophy in a few months
I feel disgusted to be a spurs fan. Have followed this team my whole life but they have betrayed football by joining this
If this is true I’m not supporting Chelsea anymore, ruins the whole sport.
Good bye man utd after 35 years of supporting my beloved reds  I'm out  P.s. I'm sorry and sad for all other fans whose club disowned them
Finally no more shitty games now the worst game you could have is arsenla vs ac milan which is pretty high quality
First time i feel ashamed of being a Manchester United football fan 😪🤬
Real Madrid 5 - Arsenal 0, Barcelona 5 - Arsenal 0. DT - "When's it gonna end Robbie" 😂😂😂
What the F
Been suporting real 12 years, today is the day I am done🤍😪
I have never been so disappointed in my team
They only did it to escape Marcelo bielsa 🟡⚪️🔵
Past year the worlds completely gone to sh*t. I thought nothing would even surprise me anymore, and now this. The end of the beautiful game.
City fan. All 6 bottom of the pyramid.  Sickening.
RIP FOOTBALL
I had a certain comfort in football knowing it would never change but that's gone now the game I love so much is being taken away from us
3 and a half billion euros
Rest in Peace football. Our love was sold by money. Against modern football. Always.
Bet your bottom dollar, Sky Sports will be showing games from this Super League.
Just because the clubs are going through with it doesn’t mean the players, managers, staff, fans want to go through with it. At least I f****** hope so
Fan power can stop this...
WERE THE PARK LANE WERE THE PARK LANE WERE THE PARK LANE TOTTENHAM WERE THE SHELF SIDE WERE THE SHELF SIDE WERE THE SHELF SIDE TOTTENHAM it’s been depressing i’m glad i don’t have to watch this shite team anymore 😂
Basically fans in the domestic country’s don’t matter to us. Footballs global Chinese’ will pay us 10x more
Some people are missing the point. They are NOT leaving their domestic leagues. Unless uefa throw them out i guess
This has ruined football no more super Sunday 🙏🏻
Football is ruined
Can’t believe Barcelona are also a part of this what happened to “more than a club”  and the fact we want to work with our enemy papa Perez is just awful I hope Laporta makes a statement saying we are not a part of this mess
From this day on I'm no longer a Liverpool supporter. This club has strayed too far from its motto and from what Shanks built.
Not sure why people are so upset. UEFA is a proven racket, rife with corruption.
This doesn't make sense what if 10 of the founding teams finish bottom 10. The league is going to kick out teams which finish upto 5 places Abo e the bottom 10?
Was it broken??? Was it not the biggest sport ever. WTF
Manchester United, u have betrayed me and the rest of your fans.
Disgusting
No longer supporting Manchester United , I will be supporting Sheffield United instead
UEFA will eventually Regulate them, if they dont the next UEFA elections they will push their own person in there. FACT
I don't see what the problem is. This is a really nice idea. Hope it goes through tbh.
I'm ashamed to be a united fan 😔
As a PSG fan i hope they also join in on this thing because this would push the clubs to the new limit
Enough ! to statethese clubs will help football at all levels - how effing stupid do these greedy bastards think we are ?deduct points, relegate them, take their titles away, ban players from international matches ... Bayern Munich and PSG  respect !
Is this no different than how The Premier  League was formed with the heip of Sky.....a breakaway.....for money
Its been a good run Chelsea 💙 off to Leicester we go 💙 😭
I can’t believe this is happening. So sad.
All these years supporting man united I guess it’s time to support my local club
American owners running fottball. Chelsea and city were happy not to join and got pressured by everyone else who did join and feared falling behind
As a Manchester United fan, I have always supported the Red Devils through the highs and lows but this day marks the day I have lost all respect due to greed and corruption....
Never been more disappointed to be a chelsea fan
Hang on, has Joel forgot about the other teams left out???
I’m off to watch golf. Anyone coming? 🚕🚕🚕
I don't see the issue, you need a first division to have a second one and then relegation. This is taking the FIFA and UEFA out of the equation. Removing the shitty TV deals and modernizing the game.
as an arsenal fan my entire life i’m not even surprised we’ve gone ahead with this. this was the last straw for me. i’m done. no point anymore👍
They looked at euro league and saw how good basketball became, with the closed league, and thought it will be great for football. As European Basketball died, due to the closed league, European football will die as well! What a horrific day for football fans, all over the world!
RIP THE BEAUTIFUL GAME
Pure greed  I'm So sad 😞😥
“Talk of a Super League is a move away from 70 years of European club football," Ferguson said. "Both as a player for a provincial team Dunfermline in the 60s and as a manager at Aberdeen winning the European Cup Winners’ Cup, for a small provincial club in Scotland it was like climbing Mount Everest"
R.I.P Futbol
Disgusting
Interesting how there are way more likes than dislikes on this video considering the comment section and general reception to this news.
Nothing will happen! This is hype... all the fans will go on supporting their side and the cabal will carry on turning this beautiful game into a WWE show...
Ashamed as a Liverpool fan, this may be the end. Hopefully the German clubs continue to stay in their senses so we can at least watch the Bundesliga
What the hell is going on
Can't believe it but after 20 years following Manchester United I'm actually considering following another team
This is just stupid to me this is gonna ruin football completely
There doing it now so they cannot hear the fans, cowards. Why not let the fans speak? Why not wait until you can hear Liverpool, City united, and every other fan  speak and one?
Disgusting. Just disgusting
Already sick of seeing the same clubs each year in the Champions League, no desire to watch them play each other every week. Boring beyond belief.
BOYCOTT
Is all about money we all know
Phuck super league!!!!
This is disgusting. I won't watch a second of it.
American businessmen ruining everything. What’s new?
No way. Discusting. Nobody watch.
Let me get this straight the 15 founding clubs are in this league forever and every year there is room for another 5 based on their league form so basically they’ll rotate 5 in 5 out spread from the participating league clubs? 😂😂😂 fckin insane so these clubs could finish in the bottom half of the table and still get to play super league every season and Fck the teams who have finished in the top 4 apart from the winners of each league who presumably would have the privelage of them qualifying that is of course it’s not a founder club who is guaranteed a place anyway so basically 7th place behind the top 6 would get you in if the top 6 founders all finish in the top 6 of their own national league, any team who managed to get 2nd 3rd 4th and so on get fck all 🥴
I waited 30 years for Liverpool to win the prem, the struggle, the banter from other fans for so long, the feeling of winning it was utterly fantastic - and now this? Obviously the prem wasn't as important to my club as I thought. Tonight, my club has let every single one of its fans down, it's sold out for greed. I'm disgusted.
Premier League, UEFA and others need to show balls and immediately and persistently. Maximum penalties including immediate point deductions and threaten to throw the clubs out of competitions and players out of internationals..  They have to show they are serious and ready for war, war for the future of football. Are we fans at all important? Show it!
SMH
I am shocked that my club (Chelsea) is part of this. I have no words but just disappointment by all of the teams who have joined this League. Fair play to PSG, Bayern, and West Ham, etc. for rejecting this.
brighton supporter now
imagine if the top six were booted out the prem. Tbh doesn't sound so bad
I'm a union berlin fan now. I'll See ya bois at Bundesliga meet ups 🙏
As if VAR wasn't enough. Guess it's the end of football.
⚽️ ⚽️ F
They basically made a Dream League Soccer a real thing ..... 👀
Boycott. Stop watching the league.
Kick Racism out of football together with Elitism. We are all United as one. Leave our football alone.
noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Roman abramovich is bullshiting with us over an over again
This is simply unacceptable football fans across the world must protest to show these money grabbing vultures from ruining the beautiful game
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
This is an absolute disgrace. So ashamed to be a Tottenham fan tonight 😞
Ashamed to be a Madrid fan . Who decided these are the big clubs. Yes watching real Madrid vs Barcelona is exciting, watching Liverpool vs Juventus is exciting. You know what else is exciting watching west ham competing for European stages. Watching Leeds and Villa coming to the top tier again and watching Everton play so well.
Such a sad day for football
REAL MADRID RULES FOOTBALL
If we don't stop this this beautiful sport may have been ruined
The beauty of football is smaller clubs fighting their way to glory, not the big clubs always being in the spotlight
Football died with the introduction of VAR, today is just the funeral.
Well guess I'm supporting Bayern now
Why is Arsenal part of them 😂😂😂
Greedy W⚓ s....this has to be stopped
Out now, promote 6 teams from Championship.
Lad stop supporting these big clubs let them go sour support a knew team like Brighton help get the prem get back up
Fans across the world should boycott those clubs that support this rubbish
What a disgrace. Fine all the clubs and dock points. The champions league will always be the premier European competition
Everything is about globalist greed now.
I’m going to support Peacehaven FC, forget professional football
What's Champions league for??????!!!! Your'e locking away clubs that shock like Leicester, AS Roma, Marseille, West Ham soon lol what the fuccccccc😾ccxxx
What happens when it goes bad
All football fans need to boycott this and contact any advertiser involved in sponsorship for this money-grubbing league and tell them we won't buy their products anymore. We need to blacklisst everyone involved otherwise football is over for the real fans.
They haven’t realised they’ll be playing to empty stadiums cuz no one, *no one* is supporting this
RIP football
VERY EXITED for European Super League.... Start it ASAP..... Big matches every midweek and weekend🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
This league is so crap. Honestly why would you want something like this. There are too many fixtures for clubs at the moment. We don’t need this league when we have the europa league and champions league. Can’t believe my team Liverpool are doing this, fool the teams who are doing this.
So basically 6 greedy billionaires have made their own football league and will dictate how much money they get!!
I'm 31 years old and have supported Manchester  United for for 29 years. Since the first time I can remember putting on any kind of shirt and it was a Manchester United shirt. If this is true and goes ahead I'll never watch or wear a shirt again. I will never support that team again. Absolute shocking
No fans want this
"By bringing together the world's greatest clubs" What if this season Atalanta or Napoli finish above Juve? Nothing. Juve are still just going to be like "we go to the elite competition even if you finish above us because we're the greater club" makes me sick.
We need a super league
Boycott this, hit them in their wallet or they dont care
How did Tottenham get in??!
wow now glazzers giving statements??? now i truely believe this is not good for football. he never talks about football and if he is saying something now you know its a scam
how can you say no to 3.5 billion
WTF 👀
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Total disgrace. English football is finished.
I am sorry but I’ll have to say a painful good bye to Manchester United my sweet club if they join that league. It’s nothing but greed. Aston villa get ready to receive a new fan.
What a great idea
isnt this just replacing the Champions League?
Money has destroyed our game
KICK THEM OUT IMMEDIATELY. ALL OF THEM. Out of their domestic leagues, and the current champions league. Out. Ban players from world cup qualifying and Euro 21.
I'm an arsenal fan,  relegated us.
RIP football
I'm happy that my club (Everton btw) whom are a big club not what we was but still big.. This is ridiculous, gonna kill football... In England especially promote 6 from the championship and relegate them...rather watch barnsley than man u
Liquidate all their history they had before this is disgraceful
As an arsenal fan im disgraced by this. We will literally be the relegation fodder for that league without the relegation lmao
Let them go! But expel them from all leagues and the champions league, force there players to never be able to play for their national sides, and when they start to crumble under their own weight, put them in the lowest tier of whatever league they come from.
Respect to West Ham for rejecting it
Absolutely shameful. JP Morgan and these overseas Investors got their grubby hands on European football.   Time to teach these bastards a lesson lads....I'm done with Man.Utd as of today. DONE.
How tf are Arsenal in it? They just drew at home with Fulham
Damn crooks wiping the club's history booooooo All for 💰
As a lifelong Manchester United fan, I'm ashamed of my club, football is dead, full of cheating and greed
101 reasons why this shouldn't go ahead. I support Bournemouth so shouldn't be as disgusted as I am but it just makes no sense in so many ways
PSG and Bayern are happy winning their Farmer's League and getting all the young talent in their league for free. So they don't have any interest in this Super League bs.
Boycott all clubs that are entertaining this stupid league
BREAKING: Football has officially been sold out
This is really disgusting
Made for kids
I’ve never been more ashamed to be a United fan in my whole life. The fact that both United, Liverpool, and Arsenal are doing this is shameful. These three clubs are debatably the most historic clubs in the country. The fact that they are leaving the prem, for some plastic league is beyond me. As someone that lives in the Manchester area I’ll probably just support Oldham now,
ban all the clubs from existing football competitions until this 'super league' folds. when they want back in, put them right at the bottom of the pyramid system
Money grabbing basterds
Simple solution, put a transfer embargo on these 12-15 "founding clubs".
its a good move. football can live without fifa and its childs. now its ESL. then own league. etc. with more fair share. its fifa greed all the time
Sounds like the NBA franchise
What a hell Tottenham play in this level ,,,,, please think twice before announced even primer league not their level 😂😂😂😂😂😂 from Gunners
As a United fan I’m fuming.. time to support Queen’s Park Rangers
games gone dead with no fans in the stadium and now this
This was all so west ham can win this season
They Should Fine the Clubs and Sue them for this. An Absolute Disgrace to the Sport of Football and its being Poisoned by Parasite Owners 😡
IT IS HEART BREAKING😭😭😭😭😭😭 FOOTBALL WILL BE GONE 😭😭😭😭😭😭
noo fucc we need to riot
This is great news! An elite league for the best teams. No longer will we need to watch crap teams like Aston Villa or Stoke again. Elite quality football being brought to our screens
As a Liverpool fan am not happy about this it f disgraceful what they have done it not fair for the fans these football clubs should be punish for this.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
So this is actually happening? Wtf
Not gona happen
Obviously a good news who enjoy football. As a chelsea fan it is a great news since i dont watch unnecessary matches like west brom against Sheffield.  But i can understand supporters from left alone clubs are complaining also League’s. Who will watch epl or la liga or even any other leagues than this awesome competition
West Ham and Leicester title race sounds kinda sick you know 😂😂😂😂
All These Clubs should be punished severely
Im a tottenham fan. But regardless i hope we get heavily fined or docked points for this.
I have now left Utd come on lecister
just about the money but i guess 3.5B was enough for the club owners to be hated by everyone
As a Chelsea fan I announce that I will now support Birmingham. RIP FOOTBALL
KICK THEM OUT NOW!!
unsub, unfollow these clubs. this is a bad dream. idk how else to describe it
historic day for football......in a very bad way of course.
I love when money hungry corporations try and sell themselves as visionaries who really care about the common people and just want to give people what they want because they just care so very very much about the purity of what they are doing.
The excitement in football will be zero.
TV networks should refuse to show games, sponsors should refuse to sponsor them and if the teams come crawling back with their tails between their legs they should be refused entry back
Can Scottish teams compete in League 2
Sky better not do rights to this or I'm  off it totally,,,
Smells like an American idea.
No fans are turning up for these games, or tuning in, and without that this is dead
welcome to america people youll be here for a long time
R.I.P Football
LOOOOOOOL THIS IS MAD
Fml whats the point 🤬
I’m a arsenal fan and the club should be relegate along with all of them
FOOTBALL IS DEAD Money is taking over discusting FIFA DO SOMETHING AND BLOCK IT
Tradition in sport should never be sacrificed for money. I'm an Arsenal fan and I can't support this. No Chance!!!
Joel Glazer is vice chairman? That makes sense, greedy bastards.
They don’t care about football just money, ridiculous
All those players from every team joining should refuse to play and ask to leave
As a Chelsea fan I've always said I'll support the club no matter what. If they stop winning titles I'll support them. If they get relegated I'll support them. If they go broke I'll support them. But this... This may actually cause me to stop supporting them. It's so sad. I never thought I would consider to quit watching football.
An absolute shamble of a move. As a Chelsea fan I'm disgusted. This is so wrong.
ban them forever
get this man a tablet or laptop
Riots? I think so
Not only have they lost our support, they have lost our respect. Never have I been more disappointed to support Liverpool FC. RIP Football.
It’s all for money. I hate that the beautiful game has come to this. And here I thought the US was the only place all about money when it came to a league system.
Boycott the big clubs
This is a joke!
football created by the poor stolen by the rich
PSA: If we ignore that the super league exists and don’t pay to watch it can’t run so please don’t watch it or support it in anyway.
as a arsenal fan thats me done done after 32 years. disgusted ashamed almost feeling tearful. How could we behind such a unfair monstrosity. football is greed obsessed already this will finish it off as a fair sport for good. You will never see me down the emirates again if this is allowed to go ahead. I hope the fa throw the book at them, otherwise the game is finished.
This is a war on football, these big six are nothing but traitors to football,  they've basically announced to their own fans the murder of the club's they support, nobody supports this,  florentino Perez and Joel glazer? Joel f**king glazer?? These people are treacherous cretins
American owners like Glazer move teams from one city to another depending on which city offers them most money and best stadium. The super league idea is same money grubbing idea. Glazers are parasites
Good news for Arsenal😂😂😂😂
Horrible horrible - man utd fan. America destroying the game
Imagine psg and Barcelona getting relegated 😂
absolute disgrace
Who y'all think winning?  😂😂
We can not finance the super league by watching it, don't support it, don't do anything that has with it to do. This is the only way that we can demonstrate against it.
Like Mark Goldbridge said, we are supposed to be moving away from elitism!
Disgrace, absolute disgrace
Absoulte disgrace i cant believe this
Super league is the cancer of the beautiful game
Stop supporting these clubs.
Are they forgetting the champions league??? How are teams who can't even get in the top 6 in the prem get into the top 13 best teams in the world hahha
Ruining football, made by the poor, stolen by the rich
Greedy bastards, won't get another penny from me.
Practicable is that even a word
Goodbye Tottenham
I'll never watch this tournament. Players need to start speaking out.  These clubs are violating their contracts.
All of these clubs are scum but the fact Tottenham are now prevented from being dethroned as one of the 12 biggest clubs in Europe forever is insane. All based on, at the right time, two or three seasons finishing in the top 4 in amongst a history of mid-table mediocrity. If this had been set up in, say, 1988 or 1982 it would be Ipswich or Southampton or Nottingham Forest declaring themselves a European superclub for all eternity.
Congratulations Leicester, Atalanta, Sevilla, you're now all top of your respective leagues.   We'll no longer be recognising these 12 scum clubs.
Niran get ready to film Croquet this week
Please can someone explain why everyone is making a fuss?
I LOVE IT. FIGHT AGAINST THE FIFA AND UEFA CORRUPTION. CLUBS TAKING CHARGE, THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED.
Love it 👍👍👍👍👍
S***, it’s happening. RIP football
I love the superleague
When the old “big six” decide to return (if they ever do and if they’re allowed to) relegate them to the championship. Or even lower.
"Our responsibility as big clubs" - rich owner who has never watched football 2021
will the premier league and champions league go ahead for the rest of the season then??
As a united fan, ban all the clubs from the premier league immediately. These clubs have let football down and shouldn’t have the honour of playing PL matches.
Chelsea 💔 why?
Please Premier League go in hard on the big 6 for doing this shite
GOODBYE FOOTBALL HELOOOOO UFC
I'm completely against this. But if it does happen why tf is Arsenal there😂😂
So where are these clubs so elite that they shouldn't have to ever risk their place against, say, Leicester?  1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th.
Deduct points from the lot of them kick them all out of champions league and europa
European super league is against footballing merit. Being backed by oligarchs and nations with disgusting human rights records is against footballing merit, and by extension humanity. What's the difference? Somehow you buy into one idea and not the other?  This Super League is an inevitable result of the CL giving places to non-champions, and the breakaway initiated by 6 clubs in 1992.
This changes football forever
all tv media should boycott as fans would not pay to watch for that....but highly unlikely
welcome to globalism.
Brilliant! Can't wait for this new league too commence.
As a kid who’s supported Utd for 11 years I’m disgusted with my club I never thought I would be saying that but all of these fans may aswell go support a new club because I’m embarrassed with my club and I’m sure most of these fans are...
This ain't opening no chapter for real fans🤦🏾‍♂️ They're trying to take away the one thing that kept us all together  Heartbroken...
Not fair on other clubs like Everton , West Ham and Leicester etc
Ban them all
I've been a Chelsea fan my whole life but this is disgusting
These owners were all about the money before they bought the clubs, it's how most of them built their wealth to buy the clubs in the first place. Therefore it should be of no surprise to anyone that they are still all about the money now. The real questions should be directed towards the governing bodies and how they have allowed football to descend into this situation whereby characters like these owners have been allowed to even propose such a thing.
Football has given many people a bit of hope and a escape especially over this past year. This announcement takes away everything that has made football so special, how sad👎🏻
Ps im now a borussia dortmund fan. From northampton. Goodbye manchester united as i once knew and loved you have killed football and are an absolute disgrace. Glazers have officially killed us guys and girls.
American soccer ball
protest at the stadiums and not let them get into the training grounds or stadiums and hit them were it hurts
The death of football....
We played and trained for so hard so win cups and then they do this ffs 😞
What Sport Shall I Watch More Now?
Guys football is gone lets just enjoy what is left before its gone🥺😭💔
I ain’t a football fan anymore lol
'Respond to the fans wishes?' Are you smoking crack? There's no fan I know who thinks this is acceptable
I'm so angry 😡
Worse than Brexit
I’m no longer a Manchester United fan if that’s true
As a United fan I hate city and Liverpool but I genuinely feel sorry for all their fans because their club has made the same awful decision as mine
This is killing the dreams of the upcoming teams like Westham united who have tried their best to qualify to ucl
Let's hope all six are expelled from the premier league tomorrow, and everything else that goes with it... When Joel Glazer stands up claiming to be the voice of English football, then that's enough, over and out.
guy literally said its a mid week competition, nothing to worry about, also sky are making a hell load of money out of postponing information they already had with all these videos
How is promotion going to work annually for 5 clubs if the founding members can't be relegated? So you get your 1 year in the league then you miss out next season because you were in the league that year and get auto relegated?
the fans of all these clubs were warned about selling their souls , this is where it leads
As a life long Liverpool fan this is breaking my heart but I absolutely cannot support this. I cannot follow a club willing to destroy football for everyone else
As an arsenal fan I don't mind this. Sick of playing molde and dundalk every season.  350 mill straight away.  Might be invested in the squad.
Glazers have done what even the most skeptical United fans couldn't imagine. They have not only dragged the club down on a footballing level but also on ethics, they have sold the club's soul today without breaking a sweat about it. If United would be relegated to league 2 but we got Glazers Out, I would take it. Save the club Utd fans before it dies.
The great reset has begun
Cannot wait to see Man City vs Barcelona for the eighth time in one season....
West Ham FC, looks like your fan base is just about to get a whole lot bigger.
I mean... You couldn't write this stuff anymore
Watch Madrid week in week out but this is an absolute shambles VAR now a super league footballs getting ruined
Already been fucked for the past 25 years but na this is fucked man. Deffo a day for the history books
Time to support Burnley!!!
its a disgrace...goodbye football...united fan
What does this mean to the domestic leagues? These clubs who will play in the super League, will they compete in their domestic leagues?
The day football died
Kick them out now..Feel so sorry for their fans..stand up and stop this rot now...Ban any player that trys to join this.
Great. Man Utd were on the brink of finishing 2nd and building a great squad for years to come only for this to come and completely ruin it.
Death of football  I will hate the club I love  You deserve to be in UCL , Not entitled to it Ya football has more fans and you’ve just lost all of them.
Football is doomed
Gtfoh
Now we will know who is the best of the best
It's only for money not for fans 😟
Spurs fan & f'n fuming
As a city fan I am appalled the fact we haven't considered what this effects instead they see money and just accept it
The year when smaller teams in all leagues have upset bigger clubs in their respective matches, so they make a league of their own🤦‍♂️
this is pathetic  if they do this i wont watch     glazers can be unalive please
I am ashamed to call myself a fan of one of these teams now.
Joel Glazer....you are the worst. You can't guarantee world class football inside your own club, much less for this ridiculous sham league. Thank you for ruining my beloved club first and then proceeding to ruin my beloved league. Shame on you Joel Glazer. Shame, shame shame.
The death of football.
Why.
Never been more ashamed or embarrassed to say I support united, a shocking day for football
What's the point man, these rich fuckers who don't understand the culture of football now own it. Sad and its been coming for a while. Everyone should start supporting lower league local teams, only real football left.
F 🤬
Absolutely Disgraceful i dont know what to say.
At least we will see teams like arsenal relegated 🤣🤣 ohh plus useless liverpool and the mousey citizens 😂😂😂
I’m supporting West Ham that’s where my Moms from I got a claim
This is all a Bad joke rip football
cant wait for this to suck
First Prince Philip and now European football dying 😭 that Attack on Titan ending must have been seismic
It’s hard enough being a Tottenham fan and now they go and do this. Disgusting.
I'm no longer a man United fan
This is a disgrace the football I Rember was a football where arsenal were in top 4 city and Chelsea didn’t buy the league not a super league and var diss allowing goals that were a toe offside
My English isn't that good. Is the super leuage now official?
I can't do this what is this
R.i.p football
So No relegation at the Premier League this year and 3 clubs from the Championship get promoted, easily fixes the 6 slots lost!
This simply cannot be allowed to happen. It’s the hopes and dreams that make our beautiful game beautiful. Celtic 1967 kings of Europe all players born within a 40 mile radius. Amazing Liverpool and Man Utd teams that ruled Europe. Stories like Bournemouth, Leicester, Montpelier and Gretna etc  Save our beautiful game
This is worrying
I feel like my a part of me has died football isn't a sport it's a community that's just been ruined by these greedy owners who see it as a business
R. I. P MANY FOOTBALL FANS LIKE OF FOOTBALL
Sad day for football
I used to do this every career mode in fifa..... That was cool because it's fifa, but this sucks big time irl, ffs. I know my grammar is off but idc.
This is just a symptom of the absolute disease that the game has become in the last decade... that’s me done with the game now, what a shame it had to come to this
Another bollocks tournament for the rich to get richer. 😟
Thank god PSG and Bayern didn't take the offer cause this is bad...😭
Does this mean Sheffield utd aren’t relegated? 😂 if so, they can do one, lol
RIP FOOTBALL
Do not be surprised if next year's Qatar world cup is cancelled
You're all not laughing about the Glazers anymore, are you?
What chelsea u did
The moment my club isn’t mine
I'm done being an Arsenal fan. They can shove their club in their ass.
As a Spurs fan, this is just finding new ways to suffer
I can't believe that cheapskate Kroenke pushed this as well, and I'm an American!! SMH, NO TO SUPER LEAGUE.
Whats wrong with our one domestic leagues premier league ect and the champions league football is just muk now
Time to become f1 fans bois
What a joke
May they rot in hell for destroying the integrity of the game
I refuse to watch any European Super league matches, please join me in protest.
SO Players fans the cant do anything football is done
See when all you English epl bum sooks go on about Scotland be a pub league? Get it up every one of ye! This is the souless clubs you support and the reason we'll take "pub leagues" every day of the week. Grass isn't always greener pal
Man United better form an ultras
I’m down for it
Lets all boycott it 😂
Stop bloody moaning,It's just a replacement for the champions league for god sake,Get a grip people
Put a ban on it
Load of bollocks
This can’t happen no I’m ashamed as a Chelsea fan seing this happen
It's not a super league if Stoke are not in it. Everyone knows that ever since Stoke decided to retire from the top flight it's been short of quality. 2 team league bro
This is a real slap in the face to football fans everywhere
The day football died for me
Looks like I won’t be supporting or watching anymore arsenal games then football is dead
gg football
WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THE €3.5B FOR EACH TEAM COMING FROM THEN
looking forward to the super league ngl
Does this mean Evertons the biggest English club now
What an utter joke
Respect to Bayern and PSG last year champions finalists haven’t sold their soul
Absolute disgrace the lot of you. You have buried all the big major european leagues and our beloved premier league. What a joke. I hope you all drown in your billions shame on you all.
Chelsea are an absolute disgrace. Supported them since a kid and I always knew Roman was a greedy man but this is taking things to a whole new level. I will boycott them if it goes ahead after 20 years of being a loyal supporter. F*ck the super league!
This is going to be like that Soap Opera from years ago, ‘El Dorado’, out in the Sun, new faces, slick set, loadsa money thrown at it..... utter Sh!t and over after one season.  If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it.
I hope all these teams get kicked out there leagues. All the clubs who joined are a bunch of money hungry clubs and just don’t care about the fans
The players should boycott.
what the hell? we have the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League. what's wrong with them?
Disgrace
I’m a fan of arsenal not anymore though
Premier League 1992-2021 Money League 2021-
Yuck
Mark your Calendars, folks.  Sunday, April 18th, 2021: the day football, as we once loved so dearly, died.
We all know fans will swallow this and still watch
All it is, is a mid week competition not affecting anything else. All clubs are struggling right now so how can you blame them for self preservation.
I refuse to support spurs
RIP FOOTBALL
That's it, my lifelong support of Chelsea is over. This isn't about sticking with your team through thick and thin, this is the owners of a business (and that's what it is now, a business) spitting on the lifeblood of what were once great clubs. Appalled, dishearted, upset, I can't really come up with any other words for how I'm feeling right now...
Well goodbye to united I'm supporting Brentford
6:33 Thank you Captain Obvious!
F U MAN U
We should all unfollow these teams and stop buying their merch
I'm upset but my team is tinpot so idrc
Suddenly the Cantona Speech makes sense,the sport is dead
This is a middle finger to UEFA.  I don't agree with it, but it is what it is
Let’s goooooo!!!!
This is gonna kill the excitement of champions league
Im absolutely disguted to be a Manchester United fan
Why did are clubs do this to us
Joke this
If they say finding clubs that it mean they sponsoring themselves or what?
DISGRACE!
Respect to German league and French league 👏🙌
They’re all in it together. JP Morgan investing in it, the board and owners getting their extra 100 millions while small clubs face extinction.  How dare they say it’s for the better of football. It’s for the better of their wallets.
I’m in shock☹️
What am i hearing ....
This project won't last for long. And we all know that.
There is more soul in the championship then in the premier league nowadays, disgrace
All the clubs should get the 400 mill for joining the league and then just leave 😂
3.5 bill well that’s it so
Utd you've just lost a Season Ticket holder. Utter disgrace!🤬
Are we quitting the premier league as well
If spurs (my team) do this I might just support my local team gills
I actually want to cry. For the first time in my life, I’m ashamed to be a United fan and I _never_ thought I’d say that, ever.
Nothing super about it. They might be big name clubs but half of them are shite and the other half are good to decent. Should be the sub par league
I wanna die
Great, now the Premier League and Champions league have lost all interest ffs.
These clubs know their value. The PL and other leagues will know how much revenue they'd lose if they excluded these clubs from the domestic leagues
Football has died 😡😒
RIP FOOTBALL 😔. GREED IS ONE OF THE WORST HUMAN TRAITS
Its sad😟
......
Free football chain
I support the super league it's forward thinking.
I’m a arsenal fan but after this not anymore
I'm so happy Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley aren't alive to see this 🤦‍♂️ Absolute shambles from Liverpool. Embarrassing
Sky sports and bt sports you deserve this for charging us extortionate prices
This is a nightmare scenario.
So upset, football is now dead
We haven’t agreed to this our owners have I’m disgraced with what John W Henry has done here I’m 100% sure that if he ran this through the whole club no one would agree especially the players how is this fare on any of them the legends the current everything they have worked for is being fucked up by our owners smh
Just another money making scheme
This has devastated me
Angry rantman is about to turn into thanos
BOYCOTT BOYCOTT BOYCOTT
They're actually going for this ffs😭
bye spurs i am now supporting watford
Who giving the clubs the cash
Can't wait to see Liverpool get mid table every season (Liverpool fan btw)
I never suspected this to say, but I will actually support passionately PSG for the remainder of this Champions League season.
Time to support lazio
Disgusting. Shame on those clubs
Someone please take the time to explain everything to me. Like will be still be in the Prem. how long is this super league and just everything
This so sad
Why are people liking this video. This should be given so many dislikes
This is disappointing, I'm gutted, absolutely disgusted and outright furious these money grabbing owners are ruining my sport, our sport, this sport is people's lives and these merchants are just grabbing money from us, I'm tired of this, absolutely tired of this shambolic groups of ppl, as a chelsea fan I'm not surprised but as a football fan I'm in tears. STOP TAKING MY FAVOURITE SPORT, STOP TAKING OUR FAVOURITE SPORT. Football is from the UK, let's bring football home from these money grabbing cheats, I'm in tears, ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES
Grim end to a grim weekend.
Iam a Chelsea fan and ashamed
Arsenal and Tottenham 🤔🤣😂 some super league 🤣😂🤣
SAY NO TO SUPER LEAGUE❌
I want to be sad but I’m a Celtic fan and just realised I already am 🥲
Those of you laughing at the 12 team's fans, you're fucked too! We're all fucked because of this!
I quit as an arsenal fan we will never win a game
What the actual f#*^
A very sad day for football
How dare you greedy owners especially roman I supportrd Chelsea since 7 and u don't care about thr fans all cuz of ur money greed a deadly sin 😭😭
All gone wrong
we cant win a prem game what make them think we can win any games in this i am a spurs fan btw
Jesus Christ....
Every fan should start supporting grassroots and make these big 6 clubs loss all there supporters specially at the gate.
Absolutely disgusting
Screw them. Let them leave. It will fail, but never let them back.
I must say it doesn't sound that bad rn. Everything is the same just with another competition
Created by the poor. Stolen by the rich.
This is disaster for European football. Especially for Champion league,only large clubs can benefit from this super league.
well lads, thats the end.
As a Newcastle fan I have absolutely no problem with this... as long as the six clubs are now removed from the Premier League and are never allowed back into the English football pyramid.
Unbelievable. I’m speechless 😢
This whole European super league is confusing and useless
Wtf🤯🤯🤯😡😡😡
I’m shaking right now. I honestly feel sick.
Unbelievable.. the worst day in football..
Fans stop supporting your clubs involved in this betrayal.
I have enjoyed supporting Chelsea all my life. Goodluck blues. Today is the day I leave you.
The death of football (April 19th 2021) fun while it lasted.
Might as well support Burnley at this point
The beginning of the end... what has happened to the world. I’m an arsenal fan and I’ve never felt so disconnected to my club than now....
Where's Nigel Farage when you need him..
Everything you love about football write below👇🏿⚽❤️:
Football, made for the poor, ruined by the rich
Ffs
Disgusting
This isn’t football any more, this is just money grabbing stupidity
🤮🤮🤮
What a disgrace . Rip Football . I hope the owners are ashamed and i know there not . Money hungry pigs
At least juve had a bit of decency to pull out
Tottenham last again on list 😂😂😂
The fans of these clubs need to boycott them. If you watch this tournament you're endorsing it and giving them the money they want
As a Chelsea fan I am disgusted no thought about the fans what so ever absolutely disgraceful
Nobody wants this why is this happening
So UEFA to stick to what they said and ban then from comp and maybe international
Unbelievable Such Stupidity😪
I hope they all lose fans
Wait this is actually happening 😂 i thought it would be a big anti climax 💀
When it all turns sour and they want to return, make them start in League two. Right at the bottom.
RIP football 1863-2021 I'm done
Boycot football
Claude is turning Claude is turning in his grave rn disgusting
Disgusting. Beyond angry. RIP football
Lived it loved it rip
Right then Im officially a Rugby fan
This is bs
“Respond to our desires” no one wants this
As a Chelsea fan i don't even have words💔🥺
Well at least saf is the only one and the last one to win the treble
I'm absolutely disguised most of these owners don't care fair play to Bayern and psg for rejecting the offer
Football is nothing without the fans
RIP FOOTBALL 😓
Rich fucks doesn't even bother  spending money on charity's and fan byeee football
I want to dislike the video just because I'm so pissed off
The reason why european nights are so special is that we don't have them so often if this was to happen football will die.
I wanna cry, but as an Arsenal fan I’ve lost all my tears...
Absolutely disgraceful
End of English football
Wow
Kick em out. The world will move on without them.

RIP FOOTBALL
That means clubs like Leicester and Atalanta are doing something right. The big clubs are scared of us
What a disgrace to football
It cant go ahead
As a Liverpool fan, I am ashamed that we're involved in this so-called European Super League.
Football is for the passion.  Football is for the unexpected.  Football is for the community.  Football is for the history.  Football is for the fans.
RIP Football😔😢
We have to unite as football fans and mass unfollow all the big teams on all their social media platforms
Greedy bastards
