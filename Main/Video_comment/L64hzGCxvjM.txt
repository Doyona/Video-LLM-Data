End of the day with a ‘normal’ job you get maternity and paternity leave. You shouldn’t feel like u don’t deserve that when at the end of the day it’s your job. You don’t get the first moments of a newborn back and she is priority not us, be brutally honest with yourself and give her your time not us!!
Awww bless her she’s so gorgeous 😍😍. She’s so blessed to have u two as parents. Ur both doing an amazing job. Love u both xxxx
Omg I love it!!
