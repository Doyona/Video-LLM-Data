Fast forward to amp trap house skit
4:17 😂
Said that tv old school.. I'm like shit I'm getting old...
god forbid you bring all your D block brothers over lmao
Why don’t you guys get buy land and build a house suitable for everybody in Texas? Land is far cheaper right outside the major cities, you guys can also tailor the house for your needs most houses are the market are designed with a growing family in mind not content creators you guys could build perfect rooms for each member and save on the costs for things you don’t need like a kitchen and you guys would be within driving distance of tons of activities for content creation. Just a thought. Love the videos bro!
"It's real estate agent a real real estate agent"

Davis clumsy ass tripping on the stairs
Nah when he got to fanum about the importance I lost it 😭
Agent the only nigguh that wants to keep amp together 💪🏽🙏🏽👍🏽
2.8 million…..I’d rather die 😂😂
The rest of AMP know how smart and knowledgaable agent is, thats probably why they're letting him handle things like this. They all care obviously, this is a group decision but agent is the AGENT.
He need a room big enough for that forehead
Or his and his is crazy 🤣

AGENT IS A GREAT GUY

Agent is the found father of all AMP members being successful
Without Agent. KAI wouldn't as popular as he is right now, Duke Would probably still make 2k Videos, Both Chris Would Be working 9-5, Fanum Would probably still be in NY. Agent is the found father of all of AMP members success. Bless that brother
That’s the one ngl
Young brothers enjoying life!!!! Live that 💩 up my brother

🤣🤣🤣🤣 Agent is the only one concerned
Amp keep it up
John 3:16-17

👋🏻
i feel like agent is documenting it all but the other guys are helping . it just isn’t being shown
They’re not buying any of these homes he’s doing this for the views the real AMP house they’ll will never show the address or even the front view from the street
This is the new AMP house 😊💪🏾
Nah that real estate Agent line was sum fye
Move to Oakland California y’all can afford it
That houseeeee🔥
5:03 👀 if yk yk
Take the stamped approved house
Agent doing this so he doesn’t have a shitty room making sure he puts in all the effort for the best room 🤣
First & the third one fasho🔥 damn y'all niggas is rich . This got me motivated as heck . I'm only 14 got a long journey to go with my music 🙏🏾🕯️🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OR THE LAST ONE NO CAP💀
IF YALL DONT GET THAT FIRST HOUSE NIGGA WTF????
Agent the Business Man
I thought the first house was way better than the 3rd one
4:56 “ you really ain’t into clothes” 😭😭😭😭
Kia and agent must be paying for this 🤣
House 3 is the one…
Jesus loves you all, have a blessed day or night. May His peace be with you. ❤️
I’m so glad y’all moving to Texas
Buying or renting???? I don’t need y’all getting evicted again. I need to see more wars in the crib 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so far Kai winning
Nice rental.
You guys should keep to yourself and respect the neighbors please! Doesn't matter if you're part of the community. You can't be loud smh lol
buy a farm
"His n his"☠️
His And Hers Or His And His😂😂😂
Why don’t y’all build your own house
the 3rd one is definitely the best outta this video an the new one ngl
I'm not gonna lie 4:10 Had me he really an opp for that 🤣🤣🤣
7:19 what was that agent?
“ i was gonna buy an airplane hangar but we just bought a crib instead” gotta be one of the richest statements ive ever heard💀
Where would the team be without agent💀💀
House 1 was the best, but all 3 weren’t all that
Agent the real mvp
That dance room could also be used as a gym 💪🏽
Now I see why you go by Agent lmaooo
you didn't know how to tie your shoelaces til the 5th grade? You know what Bobby Shmurda was doing in the 5th grade?
*His and Hers or His and His*
4:14 6:10 6:43 8:55
agent is a ahki for amp 😭 mashaa’Allah good head on his shoulders
YALL NEED A CRIB OUT IN THE COUNTRY WITH NEIGHBORS FAR AWAY AND A WHOLE LOTTA LAND !!! It would be 🔥… COME TO TAMPA/ODESSA AREA OR WESLEY CHAPEL

I told yal before Agent carries. Smh
yeah agent do be looking like the one who should fix these things out of amp
We need a whole video on how to buy to house agent 🙏🏾
The real estate agent threw me off with the “ his and hers or his and his” pause 😭😭😭
I love seeing my black brothers and sisters succeed 🙌🏽🚀
His and hers or his and his😂😂😂 for him and low
Imma be honest, I only started watchin amp recently and I was sad already thinking it was over, every night i be laughing my ass off at the videos🤣
Bro the last house is fkg EXQUISITE GNG
That 3rd house just got more space for daviss to put his trash at🤣
24 hours in the movie room?
Ngl I see why y’all don’t get a lot of bids is because your not a little professional about it. Like dress up a little bit and don’t be cussing left and right and acting like a kid. Just carry yourself a little different while your there and go back to normal
Davis freestyle was actually decent😂😂😂
If they have the chance,this could be a cool AMP house ngl
Did he take down the first video??
When you want bigger, there’s a house down the street from me for $8.5m 12bdrm 15bath has huge pool and 2 cabana homes with kitchens on 2 acres. Taxes are $65k a year
Your making NY sound so much cheaper
W agent
Love the 1st house, that shi bussin
Agent has a big forehead because his brain so big and smart it had to take some extra space..
Damn I really hope they find a crib. One where they can recreate and multiply the success, growth, content creation, and brotherhood we saw in the first house 😭
9:05 went over a lot of heads
Notice how agent said you bend “someone” over right here.    And not you bend a girl over Agent a  🌈 Niqqa.   No judgment here though … …
W house
5:03 😂😂
4:15😂😂
Crazy his name is agent and his getting the house
Looks familiar aye
Davis definetley be tearing his meniscus although it might not be serious he still got mad wear and tear on them jawns
Remember when FF said these guys were losers, he he he. oh boy.
Get number 1
Ohhh yeaa duke  parkour  videos back
Ngl agent is so funny bro😂
The last house is sick
"his and hers" or "his and his" 🤣🤣 he snuck that in so quick
nah 2k19 with the durag is crazy 🤣
is this africa where are you getting a house with more than 3 rooms for under 2m?
Cameraman : “AMPK” Agent : AM- AM- **realization sets in** tf u just say

*Nah the last house was really crazy fr*
Whatever house ya pick agent should get the master bedroom
You’re definitely appreciated Agent keep shining
2:49 light stunt !🔥🔥🔥
Bro said Amp Killers
2:14 *What about "her's and her's", that's what I'm talking about* 😂😂😂😂
I believe AMP members have specific specializations. Agent is the guy who handles transactions (financial stuff)
🙏🙏🙏
🔥
I’m just thinking how funny it would’ve been if a swat team pulled up because the white people saw a gang of black people looking at a house
That driveway has to be huge considering everybody has like 3 cars
💀💀💀💀
W
Imagine having Real Estate Agent on yo squad 🤣🔥 W
That bedroom / apartment is dope!
That last house was it
Can we just say w Agent 😁
Damn agent got shoes on now that’s crazy
Agent is the backbone of AMP😂💪🏽
The third house is tough but I feel as if the first one is the best for them, the third would’ve been the best if it wasn’t surrounded by roads and other houses so closely💯
ayo agent i wouldve up
Know exactly where that house is
Y’all definitely moved into here lmfaoo the attic was where kai shot that jail stream at
Glad they buying instead of renting this time
Yall niggas broke
that last house tought asf
The last house yall looked at was a dub
His and his is crazy
why is agent talkin to da other members like a ex trying reach out :(
It’s safe to say Kai might be Agent’s favorite! 😂😂
make sure the houses are a good distance from each other don't wanna get kicked out again😂😉
nigga said the worst house is the best house 😭
If agent don’t get the master bedroom we rioting
Agent 00 out here wearing DAME DOLLA 😂
Why y’all looking for a house when y’all can get a big ass warehouse like funny Mike and build inside of it?
Fuck any comment if you ain't subscribed yet.... Damn agent KEEP GRINDING THOSE VIDS OUT
first time seeing agent in sneakers and not in slides😂
Nah the whole beginning 😭
Whenever they move into a new house just know that it’s not gonna be a house that he shows on one of these vlogs. He knows It would ruin the house reveal video
The last one
If y’all caught the video before this one they put in an offer for the second house agent toured in this vid..
House is a W frfr 💯!
this is why agent my favorite amp member i like content like this
Im ngl that 3rd house is the house i used to have dreams about living in wtf
If AMP gets another house for the start of the summer, shit will be outta control & things of that nature.
After looking at all these houses, none of these compare to the OG AMP house
Thought u said that was too much
8:55 This nigga Davis always falling and shit💀
not the “ hahaha” at the end 🤣🤣😂
The next house AGENT LITERALLY DESERVES THE MASTER like fr he deserves it.
there all cool but there not  better then the old amp house also there all pretty close to neighbors which could be bad
Let’s go Agent hustling for that AMP house🔥 thanks for the content love the squaddd
The last house fire. So much space you might get lost
nah cause why is the last house actually fire
I'm starting to realize that Agent is actually like the Amp Agent of the team far as setting up deals and business ideas low-key . #clutchsports.
Imagine if they had time to build they own house 🤯
So ready for the new house
amp whatching this and see these houses for the first time : )
Whenever y’all do multi person videos just rent (or buy) a bus & have everyone park in a parking lot relatively close to the crib. Works wonder for the parties I host in Atlanta
The last house is the one!
the first house would fit the amp vibe
The first house fye ‼️
Did bro say his and his ….
Horse can go for 70k. I guess that's why.
That last one the one for sure
