Oh no how will they survive 😂😂😂
So who is the new King ?
I wish I had seen this video. I have always gone with Asus hardware, but recently I brought a Asus Strix 790E motherboard and I was busy and did not realize the board came with bent CPU pins. It was too late to return the motherboard cause it was past the return period. I tried to RMA this with Asus and it was a joke. The support was sketchy to say the least and they charged me $25 just to send the board to them for shipping and to replace the CPU socket, they claim it is not covered in the warranty so charged me another $45 to replace that.
Oct 2025 here.   Is this still an issue?!     Things changed yet?
I totally forgot about this video and bought an ASUS TUF laptop last year. The bluetooth device is failing sporadically and it feels like a driver issue. ASUS wants me to send the laptop to themand take up to 2 weeks to fix it. It's a common issue too. Been a common issue for years, according to reddit.  I phoned them and asked if they could send me a new adapter (support says it's a hardware issue), so I can fix it myself in 10 minutes. They don't do that, so I need to part with my laptop for 2 weeks. Horrible customer support. I'll buy an Intel mini pci-e module for 15 bucks and solve it myself.
This. Started getting a weird optane memory error out of nowhere. They told me to flash the bios. The latest update just killed my MB and they don't care. It had cost me hundreds of pounds and at least three weeks of lost time.
This video needs to reach everybody. massive rog motherboard issues till today
The ASRock comments have not aged well, lol. They are destroying Ryzen CPUs right now, especially the 9000 series X3D ones.
Let’s Be Real About What’s Going On…  For years, these big tech YouTubers were happily cashing in on brand deals, praising companies like ASUS like they were untouchable. “ASUS is the best!” they said—because the money was good, not because they cared about us, the actual gamers and consumers.  Now all of a sudden, the same YouTubers are bashing ASUS because ASUS refused to keep paying them more for the same recycled reviews. And guess what? Now they’re all pretending to be “fighting for the consumers.”  Really? Where was that energy when the sponsorship money was rolling in? Did we—the actual consumers—ever get anything back? Did they care about us then? Nope. It was all good when the checks were clearing.  Now it’s “We’re doing this for our people”… come on. Stop the fake hero act. You’re not doing it for the people, you’re just pissed your payout dropped.  This isn’t about us. This is just another money move.  So please—cut the drama. If you actually care about the community, stop faking outrage and start creating content that actually helps gamers. Not content that just helps your bank account.
And this is a content creator. Imagine how trash does it feel to be an end user
Yup, I’m going to use MSI, it’s decided now. I’ve heard soo many more things about Asus it’s just intense. And the fact that now, 2 years after this video, Asus is still doing badly is enough for me. They aren’t getting my money! They don’t even have a QVL compatibility list for m.2 drives so you can check if what you are using is actually compatible! I asked why but contacting them was a nightmare and I finally got the answer, “because hard drives are constantly changing and we can’t test them all.” They are just lazy as all heck! They don’t care. But other brands like Msi has that same list. So do most mobo brands. I still don’t trust Asrock or Newegg because they sold me broken stuff that was “Newegg refreshed” and 100% guaranteed to work and tested but dead on arrival. Man, I liked Asus and Newegg at first too but, just can’t trust em. Thank you for the video! you have gained a subscriber!
buen video jayz
I'm in RMA hell right now. I overnighted my motherboard to their repair center in CA. The USB on my X670E Crosshair Hero stopped working. The board they sent me back doesn't post. Post code 00, DRAM light. The replacement was in worse shape than the one I bought retail. They told me I had to start the RMA process again. Which I did. They provided a shipping label. Then 48 hours after Fedex indicated they'd dropped it off... I get an email from ASUS saying that it had been sent to the wrong repair center, and it was going to be another 5 days to ship it to the right one. I called them and they said there's nothing they can do. I sent them a sternly worded email yesterday. They haven't replied yet.  I'm grabbing a Gigabyte board from Microcenter tomorrow morning and contacting an attorney. Asus warranty is completely worthless.
I wish I watched this before I spent money on a new system. It just so happened to have an asus motherboard that was recalled back in 2018 but the store didnt inform me about that, and now my system is bricked after owning it for 10 months. Very sad indeed. :'(
I know this video is old, but I just got an ASUS ROG Crosshair X870E Hero motherboard. It gave me a black screen for a very long time and showed a C5 error. After many hours, I found out there are bent pins in the A2 DDR5 slot. Both the seller and ASUS refused to help — really disappointing from ASUS.  And I’ve built many PCs before without any problems.
You are the  best!
it's from the bloodline that we Chinese are so good at protecting our money. even it hurts someone else.
Hey guys, did anyone experience any issues lately with their new motherboards? Trying to figure out if they have changed a bit or still sell you stuff that break
I'm a new victim of the scam created entirely by ASUS. I bought their rubbish laptop less than a year ago and it has had a lot of issues, and their customer service and technical support are terrible af. I will never buy any of the products of this rubbish brand. I have four other laptops from four different brands (Microsoft, Acer, Apple and Dell); I've used them for 5+ years without having any issues.
Time to grab Aorus as your main!
My Tuf F15 died today just before my birthday. Thanks for the gift ASUS!
I lost all confidence in them 20years ago and refuse to use them in all builds.
If you are a regular consumer asus would say it was the users fault and they would ask you if it want to pay full retail for a refurbished beatup motherboard that's been dropped and dented but hey it's a consumer problem.
Even to this day you still use ASUS parts
Firing a sponcer dayumm that’s big wow I don’t think I ever heard of a sponcer being fired 😂 well you know what your doing Jay I don’t blame ya. I’m glad the new pc I’m planing to get has a msi hehe.
# 1858
have a TUF gaming laptop just an entry level one.... noticed that i have many lockups and random crashes for no reason where i always need to restart ... nothing to do with drivers... plus the screen is rated as one of the worst you can get for RGB colour accuracy its quite Dull prob one of the worst screens they put in there budget laptop  there was a time when ASUS was number 1 and Acer was considered budget inferior but i think its the other way around now
Yea what a bad company, if you need to get rid of a ROG GPU, lmk they don’t deserve to have any high end components at your facility 🙁
Which brand is better for the B650E motherboard, Gigabyte or MSI?
OMG I had so many problems with my ASUS board I didn't know it's a known issues. Gladly I manage to make my pc work flawless but it was so frustrating at the start.   I had problems with Win11 drivers and go back to Win10, My CPU acted weirdly and overheat for no reason for some times but after few updates and firmware I manage to make it run fine. But until this day if my PC do a restart, the power button is flashing and the screen turned off until the windows is up and then turn on again. couldn't fount any solution for it. I thought it was the GPU but I bought a new one and it just the same. I build computers for more than 20 years for me and my family and friends and never had such a bad experience.
Nooo, I just finished my very long time build. It took me 1 year to build, because of custom watercooling, get fittings and parts. Also finding time for it as a dad to three kids...they get prioritized. I have an Asus ROG CROSSHAIR X670E Hero, 7850X3D, 64GB 2x32GB DDR5-6000 Corsair RAM, Radeon 7900 XTX, 1500 Platinum Corsair PSU in a Fractal Design North case.  It freezes in the Bios. I updated to latest BIOS and same issue. I'm so frustrated, I'm not sure I have the energy to disassemble it again 😢I even just tried to install Windows or Fedora. Of cause that didn't work either 🤯  What did you do @JayzTwoCents? Any recommendations?
Thanx Mate, You and  Steve etc., so on the money. Thank you for standing up to them. I got bitten by ASUS and have now moved to MSI for my gear.
I just got "ASUS'd" recently with an old X99-A II. I originally built a system using that board with a kit of 32GB (2x16) HyperX Fury DDR4-2133 RAM, and it worked great for several years (2016-2021) until I retired it. I recently decided to start using that system again as a secondary workstation, and I used a cheap 8GB Kit (2x4GB) of Patriot DDR4-2666 RAM to test everything out to verify that it worked. After using that 8GB kit of RAM, literally *no other RAM modules* are detected. I get a "No RAM" q-code when I try only my previous 32GB kit, and I only get 8GB detected when running both my old *and* new kit together. I tried clearing the CMOS several times, and I even tried the original BIOS version, nothing worked.
This is clearly because the are globalist smart city surveillance oppressors. They also robbed employees of pension in 2008.  It seems a clear timeline to me, Since asus have become am atrocious company for products and customer service, they have been refocusing of smart city tech development amd rollout.  The future is not a good one.  Imagine you can't go anywhere without permission can't tweet without getting arrested or your CBDC UBI allowance gets  cut. And the customer service and complaints procedures are worse then than now.  Computer says no.  Asus are spearheading global.oppressiin, this is a far bigger concern and their treatment of customers in recent years clearly highlights their morals ethics and designs for the future.😢
damn, I just ordered ASUS ROG Z790-E Board...
I built my whole setup with asus. Monitor motherboard gpu
on the day of the premiere I bought asus R5E10 for a premium price, but I wanted to have it on the first day. It worked great, until I uploaded a new bios. Problems with fan controllers, instability, and finally disabling the possibility of overclocking due to an uncovered bug in CORE processors. Great, especially when you look at the fact that I spent $1k on water cooling, with two 420mm radiators to overclock the 6950x to 4.5 non-stop. I changed to MSI in 2020 and it worked. This year I was building a small computer, I chose ROG strix x870... memory instability. Only after reading the experiences of others, I understood that this is another generation with a problem in the design of the motherboard, and the fact that the tracks are in the wrong places and therefore the motherboard will never work as it should. I returned the motherboard. I had to change my plans, and I bought an MSI project zero motherboard - it cost half... it workes grate, now for a month almost non-stop loaded with work. I did not think that I would change Asus for MSI a second time... but I will never touch anything from Asus again.
I recently got that same TUF B650M board you have next to you and have had no problems. Was my first build and went soothly, even updated bios before putting it together but it’s wasn’t a BETA version. I’ve bought asus products in the past past and never had issues but it’s alarming to hear their post sale service is so bad. Hopefully I never have to deal with them
Just built a pc this year, made sure to get a MSI Tomahawk after seeing this a Steve’s video
Well, fuck, i'll now need to send back my asus tuf motherboard i ordered, didn't know they suck such ass, i'll definitely keep this in mind to not buy anything ever from them.
This video is kinda old, but i may pinpoint an other huge problem with asus. The software to manage the motherboard on windows only affect for the current user, and it is required that the current is admin of the system. Thats a major security flaw. If a consumer could consider OK, or dont understand the problem, a compagny with enough care about security would ban that.   We've managed to lower a bit the fan speed curve in the bios. But that was enough for me to consider stop buying Asus motherboards. That was a 4k$ computer (with an Asus pro art and an rtx  5090) an user gonna use everyday for vidéo éditing and AI.    With asus troubles, Amd cpu burning themself/or it could be because Asrock problems , Intel Cpu dying... Sound like we've reached a gap
I've never felt comfortable buying from a brand that starts with "Ass"
Im glad I just seen this. I was thinking about updating from my Maximus X Formula. No need to now. I have had all kinds of problems with USB on my Asus boards since my Striker Extreme. My X Formula USB 3.2 port does not work properly on any of the 6 - X Formula boards I have.
Bud light beer failing is a great example if ASUS wants to fafo 😂
since my x370 crosshair, i will never buy asus again. the rgb on this motherboard literally disapeared at the first bios update in 2017 loooool.
Wish I had watched this before buying my x870 crosshair.  Ryzen 9 9950x 128gb memory and I wanted the 5 ssd on the board.   Now I'm puckered.
Kinda fortuitous getting recommended this video now. After quite a few years away, I recently built a new desktop. There was no company that got avoided more than Asus. You're welcome, Asus. F'in idiots.
Been a fan of Asus from the A7N8X days. Still running strong. Updated several other machines. I recently purchased the Asus Prime 870-P WIFI. Worked without a hitch. Built several others with Asus. No problems. This video is very disheartening  to say the least to see this especially with  the Asus brand. Maybe i have had great luck with their products. Customer service is EVERYTHING. It can make or break any company. One issue that is current especially in the GPU department. The prices are a  "Nightmare On Elm Street". Enter at your own risk..Thanks
Have you heard anything from Asus yet?
I switched a MSI to a asus board and absolutely hate it. Switching back
I've always bought Asus, and I haven't had crazy issue, but this seems crazy...   What brand do I go with next? I'm Looking to upgrade from my X570-I gaming motherboard and 3080 OC White GPU.... should I go we ASRock or MSI?
i should spaming 1 star trustpilot review, i hope no one bough any trash electronics anymore (not just asus every corporate)
Purchases an astral 5090 from a scalper
I’m just curious if you have a follow up planned for this? Has the manufacturer reached out after an appropriate amount of time to attempt to kiss and make up? Was it a bad run of luck attributed to a few employees who couldn’t be bothered to take pride in their work?
Do you still recommend to stay away from Asus MB? Did they get any better and can you recommend Asus MB today? Thank you
Are B650e-i safe for 7800x3d now?
I loved always asus
Should i buy gigabitin or msi motherboard if not asus im switching ddr4 to ddr5
Just killed 2 keyboards because my ASUS MB did not recognize RAZER and DUCKY keyboards, never again !!!
Isn't this crap normal for all Chinese made products.
I wish I had seen this video before just getting an ASUS PRIME X870-P WIFI - no problems 6 months in. But in the future I'm buying MSI for all my computer parts in the future.
My desktop computer has an ASUS motherboard. I just bought an ASUS motherboard for work.
I salute you and your integrity sir.
This is an old video, however... Why does this "you better start getting your stuff together Asus" sounds like they actually haven't? I mean the whole "hehee, this is an MSRP card but it isn't" with the 5070 Ti? I've felt for a few years Asus has been acting up like privileged kid. Now it's like privileged DUMB kid. Sigh.
Dude @Jay you are scaring me I was gonna build a system with a 9800x3d , asus x670e or b650e f .. should I not use asus boards or what ? There are only a few options for the am5 chip set 😬
And forgetting they are getting to greedy and selling garbage products.
My 3060 fan died.... it was under warranty... RMA's back ASUS... they sent me  back a  used comparable item.... I am SOOOO done with ASUS!! All of these multi-media giants, tech giants are just screwing consumers over to save a buck. Disgusting is an understatement. I should have gotten a new GPU.... just a for s**t corporation...
I just bought and built a brand new PC with Asus x670e-f motherboard and Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and it didnt even boot, i spent 3200€ on the entire thing, and yesterday I sent the motherboard back, now im waiting for my brand new MSI board... oh how ironic to find this video
Jay, What motherboard should I use?
I spent $2500 CAD on a laptop that doesnt work and even after 2 RMA they cant fix it and they wont give me a replacement, laptop only worked for 2 months and even during those two months the laptop used to crash a lot.
Hate seeing all this Asus stuff coming out in recent years, used to be a massive fan
CRAP! i wish i saw this a few days ago before i bought an x870-f   I had no idea asus was shitty like this 😢
It’s too bad to hear this. I have been a diehard customer of ASUS. Reliability is paramount to me and when I upgrade next time, I’m going to have to do a lot of research before I feel comfortable.
This is a bummer to see my new build has a ton of Asus parts
You will only like Asus until unless you have to deal with their customer service. It's nightmare how they treat their RMA's. Google "Lawsuit against Asus" if you wanna see hundreds of people crying over poor customer service on reddit. Most people are blamed by Asus that it's CID(customer induced damaged) when they ship out a product under warranty and repairs are billed to customers. Don't buy Asus.
yep i wont ever buy another product from those clowns. my motherboard was faulty and they straight up ghosted me. When I called the pc parts supply store they told me they are not surprised and that they are the biggest headache dealing with RMA
After $ervice Unavailable $HIT
Never been a fan of ASUS to be honest. as you said: cool looking, fancy products, BUT too many flaws for the asked price. Totally happy with 100% MSI, which, is by far more on the gamer side, than ASUS could ever be.
I liked ASUS for a good while but had a bad expensing customer service a couple years back and never have used them again
I havent touched ASUS since the days of my G11CD prebuilt, where I upgraded the ram, then found out I couldnt take advantage of the higher ram clock speeds because the ASUS BIOS was locked out. Then I built a budget rig for my brother, and an ASUS Prime board came with the Ryzen 3700X cpu I bought, and it was the WORST user interface in a bios I had ever used, and it would not get the ram profile to properly run the rams rated clock speed. Not to mention some weird issue where everything just ran incredibly slow/stuttery. Swapped to an MSI board, and was golden.
Ok u scaring me as i was planning to buy part form them and upgrade gx4090
Guess it’s no more Maximus boards for me. Gonna have to learn to like asrock or Msi
I know im super late to this but look at asus am4 b550i support for 4000 and up gpu's, doesnt work!
My last three builds are ASUS and I've never had a problem with them. Great boards.
Is it all ASUS brand including laptops? Is there a list?
thats crazy had to jumper cable clear my bios cuz i was overclocking ram then i see then when that sigh of relief hits, how ironic hahaha ahhh hollyyyy shhhhizzz
Honestly, year after  ...Id still say frick ASUS and their 0 customer love. Proud big names put their mouth where their words.
Thanks. I've been trying to find a mid budget laptop ($1000 - $1500) and I've been looking at some of the Tuf Gaming laptops.  Perhaps I will look closer at some MSI laptops instead.
and now they think they are so good they can charge 800 extra for their astral version of the rtx 50 series
My PC is full of Asus stuff, never again. It's a nightmare, along with Corsair.
I get the frustration with ASUS messing things up when they send you free hardware.  I wish I had that problem - well the free part anyway.  So, I would say don't look a gift horse in the mouth and instead work with them to get it sorted out rather than flame them.    Look, when you overclock hardware, you are driving everything beyond design specifications.  This means more heat and more heat means shorter lifespans at the component level.  Just because devices can be overclocked doesn't mean that it is a good idea to do so and without adequate heat transfer mechanisms in place (proper thermal/electrical engineer level knowledge, not garage band style engineering is needed to be certain of this) then you will eventually damage your gear.  Blaming the failures on ANY motherboard manufacturer when you have been driving their hardware harder is not taking your contributions to the potential failure into account and that is dishonest IMO.  You said yourself that ASUS should not release a beta bios update if it has the potential to do real damage.  Well, what do you think you are doing when you tweak clocks, timing, impedances to get that last 1% speed increase?  You are literally doing the same thing that you say ASUS should not.  I am willing to bet that your motherboard failures can be traced back to over- heating related issues brought on by overclocking.  You can't get temperatures at every location on the system that could be a point of failure.  Heck, even traces can suffer heat related failure.  Each trace has its own impedance and impedance, contrary to many a youtube channel guru is NOT resistance. Impedance is comprised of resistance, capacitive reactance, and inductive reactance:  Impedance Z = R + j(2πfL - 1/2πfC).  WHY? Because everything has resistance, capacitance, and inductance.  Even resistance is different between DC and anything with frequency (read up on skin depth effect).  My point is that every trace on the motherboard that carries high frequency signals will have a difference total impedance when driven at different frequencies.  Do you think that everything other than the changes you are making will "just work the same way"?  Not a chance.  If you tweak your hardware, then you are always partly responsible for any failures you may encounter. Once you own that fact, you might have a different opinion when looking out past your own face.  Knowledge is power. Knowing less than enough puts one in a position to open mouth and insert foot.   I would be very interested in the statistics on how many motherboard, CPU, RAM failures occurred as a result of overclocking as opposed to stock use.  I am sure that would be a telling story and might shed some insight as to what all component manufacturers are dealing with.  You can't expect BMW to warrant your car if you jacked with the ECU to get more power and blew the engine. Ok now I am done.  Let the flamers flame but doing so will just show you fail to understand the points made above. - Cheers
Jay bought Asus wtf
I remember when Intel looked down their nose at AMD. I also remember Asrock having issues with their VRM temps. I love Asrock. They are my go to brand... I just ordered an ASUS board because the price was fantastic...now I know why.
Wow!! ASUS used to be the brand everyone used. They and Intel were how it was done. Now MSI and AROC are the brands used today. That has changed a lot. After going back to building PCs I am in some overpriced demented Twighlight zone episode.
Retired my 2017 ASUS ROG Crossblade Ranger MoBo a month ago before watching this.  I loved that board.  Decided to get an MSI while retaining my MSI RX 580 GPU, at least until prices come down.  Hope ASUS can get it's act  together again.
MY asus TUF x670e plus wifi , died 6 months ago, they kept it for 2 months , trying to blame me, I had photos of the vrms had discloring on the bottom as well as the cpu area , I use one of those water coolers with 3 fans . I finally got them to replace it , i kept getting emails from different people.   Well yesterday 01/16/2025 , it started with the 20 minute before windows would come up , i'm on win 11 23h3 .  I just ordered a laptop, and i am going to send this pos .   i did ask them if they could update me to a ROG as my sons have had no problem , i offered to pay for the difference in price. NO was what they said
My brand new (2025) ASUS laptop is basically unusable.  Duck you ASUS.  Your customer support sucks and i feel like a moron now.
just about to assemble a new build with an asus board which needs a bios flashback for a 9800x3d now i want to send it back and go for gigabyte ((((((
Well shoot I just built my pc with an asus motherboard AND asus GPU...
so they stopped supporting you and now their products are bad? good job
I'm getting back into the PC world after taking a number of years off. Was planning on doing an ROG themed build, should that no longer be the plan?
Know im late to the party, but i really hate to see this been using primarily asus boards for going on 10 years now without issue. Last board i bought is going on 3 years ago.
this video aged ❤️‍🩹 well
Sounds familiar. I bought a new motherboard in 2012 and built a system. The board would not recognize all the ram I put in it as stated. On my 3rd (2d two were refurbished) I finally got the memory right, but the system overheated.I had to have an external fan blowing on the motherboard for 12 years. Finally started to build another system. So far I've had 2 bad motherboards and sending the second one back. Not to mention support doesn't know what they are talking about many times. I've had it with them as well. Wish I knew what motherboard to buy (high end) that would be reliable. I could go on, but....
Hi Jayz,  This is probably the worst video to ask you this, but...   I have the Asus Pro WS W680-ACE IPMI, and all the SSDs and M.2 drives are visible in the BIOS. However, when I try to install Windows, no drives are detected, and it asks me to install drivers. I’ve downloaded all the drivers from the Asus support website, but it still doesn’t recognize the drives. Can you point me in the right direction? Anyone? Please? :)  Thanks!
Year later I'm loving this, wish I'd have watched it 12 months ago. I wouldn't have bought 11 months ago the ROG STRIX  Z790 E Gaming Wfi ii. Had nothing but CPU overheating 14900KF, finally died on me last week. Waiting for a MSI MPG Z790 EDGE TI MAX WIFI Motherboard to be delivered via Amazon as I type. Hope I have better luck
Done it is then.  Selling all my Asus stuff and not gona purchase any.
My build idea to replace my FX6300 is using an ASRock X870, thinking about looking at other ASRock because I'm thinking of going with PCIe WiFi/BT5 card instead of built in. But that depends on what I find for quality differences, I like wireless, but the lag on cheap BT just sucks
This aint new for asus!  Why anybody buys their shit is beyond me!!! Msi all the way!!! Im planning on a full MEG build with either 9900x or 7950x3d or the new 9950 x3d comming out in 25! its litteraly art... that dosent burn up ive had msi laptops and have always been impressed with them
This is so Funny I know this is a year old but I just recently went thru the RMA for a Prime Z790-V-AX. The NVME port went out I thought I had a bad nvme but put in a new one loaded in windows and came back the next day to the exact same issue. So I removed the board put in a ASROCK Z690 Phantom 4 and low and behold the original NVME booted right up with no issue. Sent the ASUS off and when they sent it back with no repair saying no issue could be found. Put the Board back in and then my temps went thru the roof on my CPU and could not get them back down no matter what i tried. Pulled the board sent off again, it is important to note that in the asrock the idle temps with a 5.2 overclock on a 12900k are 33 degrees with the ASUS they were at 55 to 60. there RMA process sucks and takes way to much time with little to no result other than they say you are crazy. So now tomorrow morning I am reinstalling the ASUS. I just want a good working MB the z690 is good but is older for sure DDR4 etc...But I agree they are a mega corp. that doesn't give a crap about the consumer which sucks cause I was a die hard ASUS fan. Now looking at the Steel Legends product line may try them...I don't know....
I gotta geekcom powered by asus . Yea i see why asus isn't doing well now.
My personal rig is going to be a 14900K  on a MSI pro z-790A-max Wi-Fi because of the Asus shenanigans and AMD isn't an option for me because of the types of games I play are geared towards INTEL/NGrredia and I'm checking out the ARC B580 trying to find a 16lane variant because I'm not wasting half my pci-E slot☺️ found one FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE FKN DOLLARS!!!!!! WTF HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS😮
They're afraid of getting their ball suit off if they burn down somebody's house
So I'm a beginner and after a bunch of research on the internet and YouTube I decided on the ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A Gaming WiFi motherboard and the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU so what do I do now? I want to put together a higher end build for 4K gaming but not go overboard on features that aren't worth my money.
This is the reason I come to these channels (JTC, GN). Not necessarily "this sucks and should never be purchased", but certainly "this is happening, and needs to be fixed. Make up your own mind before purchase".
to think of it, the only failed GPU so far I saw was Asus GTX 250 (at work 15 years ago) no matter how slow and crappy the others were, they ended up being thrown away just because they sucked - not because they failed...
agree asus kiss my ....
I had several bad boards, including a Hero, and a Formula, back in the i7 4950K days, kept RMAing boards, with perfect sockets, and they kept telling me the sockets were damaged.  I got tired of teh lies and quit Asus over a decade ago.
Have been avoiding Asus Products for the past 2 Years just garbage
asus tuf x570 sucks a lot !!! Weird problem all the time.
My crosshair X870E shit the bed, won't even boot up. Sooo pissed!!!
I heard how good Asus were meant to be in the early noughties. I bought some bits from them which just didnt work, or GPU that constantly blue screened but all problems went away when I used my old card etc... I sent RMA's spoke to the seller etc and I just got so sick of it in the end I lost out!!  When you work your behind off to save up and buy high end kit, many people will understand when I say what happens after you 'lose' that money on bad kit. It hits hard.  After that experience, ASUS were NEVER on my list again. I saw stories along the way about bad experiences and it just kept getting worse until 2024. No loss to me, I've had years of rock solid reliable computing with other brands.
I wish i watched this before i built my pc. I was recommended to get asus by a pc repairer. Now im stuck with an asus mother board and gpu. It hasnt failed on me its been great but now im worried for when it does fail.
massacre... The board starts after more than 60 seconds. But when it goes into sleep mode, that's when problems start to appear. After some time, the board wakes up, but without RAM. It displays q-code 46. Then you have to unplug the power supply, wait a while and start it again. Then the board tells you to enter the BIOS (F1). And check the settings. Configuration - ryzen 9 7950x3d - asus rog strix 1200w argb power supply - rog x870e hero motherboard - corsair 2x32Gb ram, cl30 6000 Mt/s.
Just bought the zephyrus g16 and it's full of bugs. Keyboard stopped working, audio changes drivers as it feels, internet connection is garbage. All I've ever bought is asus.   Getting ready to build a new generation desktop in the new year and I won't be buying anything asus ever again.
Asus are banned in my house ive only ever had issues with ASUS products, failed motherboards and dead strix gpu fans. Im solid MSI now on motherboards ive used so many and never had one issue, guess you can call me an msi fan boy now :)
So what mb would everyone recommend for a 78003xd that is still really good and has multiple nvme slots. Im building a pc for the first time but i keep getting mixed reviews on what i should get.
I just got an asus case and mobo, mobo so far has been perfectly fine, it was all super cheap but so far going well
I am going back to intel all because of asus not standing by their products, knowing they are selling you garbage..... some of us work hard for our money asus and save for a long time, I am not buying another asus product ROG STRIX my ass RAW SHIT is more like it
I have never seen anyone i know have good experiences with Asus for years. I swore I would never use them when years ago there was a popular motherboard ( forget which)  they absolutely refused to acknowledge an issue that their support forums were full of people begging for any kind of help with no responce while making it nightmarishly hard to actually file a ticket on the issue.
What business do you run then, other than this channel> is it a pc building one or just curious. Nothing nefarious. Or is this channel; the business
Thank you for taking a stand.
If you think Asus is customer unfriendly, try to change MSI laptop keyboard...
thank you
even asus made me disconnected in roblox
Wow what timing for this video to be recommended to me. I recently had to send asus my $1100 dollar Maximus z790 extreme because of blue screen issues. Bad enough this most likely happened because they allowed voltages that were too high to run and damage it. But the icing on the cake is when those a**holes sent it back it had the wrong SSD Nvme lever's installed and lost screws and a back plate for another Nvme mount point. I bitched up a storm and sent it in for a second time. They send it back with different, but still incorrect levers so I cant put in my OS drive. I'm loosing my mind, did they have some random guy off the street work on this? This was a once in a lifetime dream PC build I did that cost me 10K and I have nothing to show for it. Now im broke and trying to see if I can get really lucky and find another new z790 extreme board that the scalpers haven't got their dirty dick beaters on. Well after I get done having a nervous breakdown.
are there problems with the asus b550 tuf board if so please let me know I was going to build a new computer using the b550 tuf board and a ryson 5600x would I be better to use another board and if so which board would I be safe with , this is the board, ASUS TUF Gaming B550-PLUS WiFi II AMD AM4 (3rd Gen Ryzen™) ATX Motherboard (PCIe 4.0, 6, 2.5Gb LAN, BIOS Flashback, USB 3.2 2, Addressable 2 RGB Header and Aura Sync)ASUS TUF Gaming B550-PLUS WiFi II AMD AM4 (3rd Gen Ryzen™) ATX Motherboard (PCIe 4.0, 6, 2.5Gb LAN, BIO…
Huh. Asus has been my brand since my first build back in 1999. Oh well, sayonara Asus!
so, ASUS is doing this stuff to people for quite some time , this guy's real problem was that they didnt treat him as an influecer ... instead he got parts like most of the regular people. He is just mascarading that he cares about you or me. . OFC i cant be sure about this , but its what my guts is telling me ....
4:16 is it though? That's one way of interpreting it. To me it looks like they rushed out a fix asap, before they had fully tested it, so if people had the issue and wanted to take the risk they could. I would infinitely prefer that, to waiting weeks/months with no pc. At least they gave people the option. You didn't have to install it if you didn't want to. It's literally says it's a beta bios in the first few words of the description.
Asus TUF X670e- plus , got it one year ago. After days of instability and problems, it gave up. In one year. Asus. Military grade. We live in weird times, I belive nothing is set in stone anymore. Had an MSI gaming since 2015, no problems, probably will go back or prefer Gigabyte.
Jay I had a Silverstone PSU once that I'm pretty sure put sugar in my gas tank while I was sleeping. You need to fire them ASAP.
Thank you for your report I know the story is owner a year but still I will not invest on ASUS
So what You are saying is that the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS ELITE X WIFI7 MB I just bought should do Me fine ??
Asus has never given me any problems at all. Bad batch probably, who knows. I love the x670e hero though.
I have mutliple computer at home. And i never used asus mobo. Lol
My Asrock has red cpu light but still boots and i trust it more than Asus
Great customer service video here, thank you for helping me decide what NOT to buy.
My sad ass looking at my new asus b650 plus inside his box😢😂
So the way it looks matters to you rather than it functionality eh? Well thank you jay for letting me know about ASUS becoming shitty like Incel er I mean intel.....I will keep using AMD when i finally upgrade ( when they make software intended to brick my system that is)  and avoid ASUS. funny because ASScrock and MSG er MSI used to be the crappy boards and now they are solid.
I'm still using my Sabertooth 990FX R 3.0 . It has ZERO issues. I run it at power saver on the EZ bios because I just don't want to spend the time UNDER clocking it. I also use a water-cooling loop for the CPU even though I never overclock it. I did this to insure it would last a VERY long time and it has. I saw the videos on places in Africa where they used to live by farming and fishing until the "green" recycling thing happened in America which resulted in shipping old electronic and computer components over there  and some ASSHOLE making a business out of it which destroyed the environment so that they have no other choice but to slave away breaking down and scrapping computer parts that further toxify the environment. this is what led me to despise you in the first place because you encourage profusion instead of economy. I cannot fault you for that because I honestly don't think you know better.
Okay well then RESPECT to you Jay. I often thought of you as a toady mouthpiece and today you proved me wrong and I love it when I am not always right! It makes me feel human.
This is what happened to many popular brands of products.
only ASUS products i even consider are MnK. nothing inside my case
Time to boycott Asus.
That happen to me with their bios long time ago and I quit them forever, I was full asus fan.
I'm building my first PC in 2025 before tariffs on GPUs skyrocket prices, luckily I live near a Mircocenter. Question is ASUS still canceled a year on and should I avoid buying an ASUS MB if i want my PC to last? Will try and get a 9800X3D, if not definitely getting a 7800X3D TIA.
asus is like this with everything. I needed a laptop battery. They kept copy pasting from their booklet and sending me that email. im like LISTEN patel. i know im out of warranty. I just need a damn battery.
It's just more than 1 thing with them. It's a lot of Bad Shit. The only thing these Clowns know how to do these Days is Overpricing their Flaky Shit to the Moon. They think they are Jensen Huang or something, lol. The B550 Boards were a Nightmare with them so i'm never buying anything from them ever again. I have them Ultrablacklisted.
Oh ffs i just bought an Asus g17 4070 with an amd 9 7845hx. 😢
I have a ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (WI-FI) and have never had an issue. It sucks these newer boards are having these kinds of issues.
Props
I have some problems with MSI: their laptops are nightmare to fix, even the best editions of their graphix cards DO NOT HAVE any fuses on 12v lines, so cards can just burn fown very badly (mine gtx 770ti nearly did) and motherboards may not have very reasonable price tag. I have always been choosing ASUS for stability and better ability of overclocking, butvnot anymore.  Guess i'll be AMD and MSI/Gigabyte guy, just like 10 years ago
I still buy from them...
Watching this on a brand new (white) ASRock build. I can't say what their RMA is like because I've never needed it :D
So... I have an ASUS TUF Gaming laptop.  Should I move to an MSI, Alienware, ACEMAGIC, or Acer laptop? :/
I got a maximus hero z790 with bent pins, waited 2 months for replacement.., terrible.
I know there's a lot of water has gone under the bridge since May of last year but the comments keep coming - here's mine. I didn't know to listen to you a year ago. I'm heading into my 8th Decade soon - it was all I could do to shop for a Gaming purchase, a G10CE to play an air traffic control sim on. The past month has been a horrendous journey of learning and trying to reconcile what ASUS has done to me. Watching this video has been a genuine source of healing. For that and so much more, Thank You.
I bought asus vivobook s14 2024 with latest AMD chip. Thought it will be fine, but after about a month or so it would reboot on its own and everytime I would connect it to my 4k display with good hdmi cable, screen would tare and glitch. So, yeah I should have listened to you.
they don't care.......yet........
I just built a new system and wanted to go with Asus, but decided to go with the MSI Tomahawk.  Thank God!!!

IF YOU HAVE TO RECOMMEND A GOOD MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURER FOR GAMING PC...WHICH MANUFACTURER SHOULD WE CHOOSE, SIR...THANK YOU
I have an asus g15 laptop that I used for about 3 months before I was DONE.  The armory crate software is a virus…but if you kill it, your fans and lighting stops working right. On top of that, the laptop will not actually turn off.  No matter how I shut it down, the laptop is dead when I take it out of my bag.  It’s a known issue with the crappy bios not having the right sleep state.  It’s a garbage company.  I bought an Acer Predator and I love it. It’s 10 times the machine and has been a joy to game on.
So what board manufacturer is the new ASUS?  I’ve been using them for decades, just bought a 7800 X3D for an ITX build..
Asus sucks. Two bad mobos. Never turn on, ever. Waste of money and time.
I reached out to Asus several times regarding a ProArt Motherboard that's supposed to have working Thunderbolt ports (which they don't work) and they never get back to me. Customer service is horrible. Now I have a motherboard that I'm not using just sitting around.
2024 the year that tech Youtubers unionized and extorted companies for more money from their contracts. 😂
Had so many ASUS problems .... Glad to see other people with a platform calling them out on their BS!
I buy msi warrenty and so longs u dont overclock they replace mine no matter what even did my processer when my cat jumped on it and bent pins they didnt care. Microsoft and intell are boat anchors period
Does anyone know if this problem persists on the x870E-E chipset?
Thank you for this insight x
Saw a great deal on an Asus Tuf b650e... Glad I watched this before the purchase 😂
asrock has been really good in my pc so far
Hummm, i think I will buy a Taichi instead Crosshair. Thanks!
Some things to think about and regret here ASUS! It is a huge deal. I have been building systems for over 20 years moving to primarily ROG products. I just purchased an ASUS ROG Strix Z690-I for a new mini TT200 water build a few days ago and... well after watching this video... this video is over a year old! I am going to be returning the board. The last thing I want to deal with is an uphappy customer because ASUS failed to back and support their own products. I will likely rock Gigabyte or Asrock moving forward with my customers.
They're trying to save money on their side.
I'm having a horrible time with Asus RNA right now. They sent my motherboard back with no bubble wrap in the box and vent the motherboard up. I don't know if one of the pins got bent somehow but I am getting BSODs and they didn't fix the original problem... No idea what to do other than buy something other than ASUS next time
I had pretty much decided to buy an ASUS pc or laptop. Thanks for warning me off.
I'm just looking at getting the Asus ROG STRIX B650-A GAMING WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard. Do I look at other options?
Not sure what the drama is but whatever it is I've been using Asus components for 8yrs now for some tough overclocking, heavy mining, overheating condition testing and the list goes on. I personally award Asus the most resistant toughest most reliable pc parts maker badge! I had some of the best (non Asus) psus dying in smoke while Asus  motherboards would still run strong years after it happening no issues, Same goes for Asus gpus being overclocked beyond the limits to the point of crushing PCs and damaging other components but it took reverse to stock settings and those gpus still run with 0 issues after 4+ years. Whatever this guy says Asus is definitely on top of my shopping list for pc parts.
wow your video only pops up AFTER i decide to build with a asus tuf gaming z790???? rude 🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if ASUS made some diversity hires for BIOS. You need absolutely solid, experienced true engineers, expert in software and hardware, to tweak the BIOS that sits between them. There is no room for diversity hires.
Is x570 hero stable. Was going to get x670 e hero. That one is out.
My last ''new'' asus motherboard arrived with several broken pins, and the one i got it replaced with had a pre installed program (sonic) which mutes certain types of game cutscenes which took months to find the solution for till i stumbled on some old game forums from about 10 years ago. Republic of gamers my ass.
honestly I have never had any isues with ASUS just been lucky.
I'm buying ASRock
I wonder if the issue people had were with AMD only. I use Intel and never had any issues with Asus products.
Fear monger
Currently building a PC with an i9-14900K and ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Dark Hero, so hopefully the Intel side of ASUS doesn’t give me any problems because I’ve used ROG motherboard based computers for years now and have been nothing but happy with performance.
In the last two years every ASUS GPU I’ve purchased (two) has died within weeks
Lol at all of you STILL buying up all the asus boards and pumping ROG stonks. You'll never learn. Every viral build and the majority still uses asus and rog. Lol
I’ve purchased 2 different several thousand dollar machines. They both quit working after 2 years and support refused to fix the issue. They quoted me $1250 to fix one of the machines due to a malfunctioning board, as my warranty is out of date. However I find it odd that I didn’t even get 2 years out of either, it must be a quality issue. I will never buy another product from ASUS for as long as I live.
Been a year, and asus still doing the same ol' stuff. Haha
Well didn't give a fuck still bought asus card
Not me waiting for ASUS to send me a replacement mother board of a month owning it smh
I build HIGH END gaming machines and I used to use ASUS only but I never even look at their stuff now and have not for about 1.5 years.
I'm so happy with my Gigabyte
Know what happened during the last tech layoff ,all the techs from Asrock went to Asus and all Asus techs moved over to Asrock. This is why As rock is now making a better product lol just kidding.
Got a ASUS Rog Strix a few years ago, only had troubles with this one from day one. And it's definitely the last product I'll ever buy from them, so this video doesn't surprise me ONE BIT.
YOU'RE FIRED MAN
PLEASE HELP! idk if the asus problems are still ongoing, i do have major issues with my new build!!  Ryzen 7950x3d Asus rog crosshair x670e hero Gskill trident z 6000mhz cl30 Asus rog strix 4090 oc 24gb Samsung 990 pro m.2  Problem: random system resets without any bluescreen, long ram initialisation especially with expo set in bios, screen flickering, usb problems like pc not booting when certain devices like my asus rog swift is connected and a few other symptoms.  Please help
Can anyone recommend, a reliable gaming flagship motherboard, instead of Asus?
Wow, what a bomb!
Jay I was wondering if you every fixed the issues with your Ram being unstable I currently have the same build you do I have run memtest86 and done several things to see if the Ram was faulty and all had turned out okay. But every time I put my pc in expo 1 it runs for like a day then the motherboard starts to error code out with many different codes but all down to memory but the memory is fine but the expo just causes crazy Instability I have reached out to Asus but they are not really helping at all so I was just wondering Jay if you fixed the issue or do you have any advice please.
How can we as consumers trust anyone? It seems every company in every market are just saying fuckem!
I switched to MSI 7 or 8 years ago when an Asus board I had been using lost its USB ports..  The board had just went off from warranty.  I also had problems with drivers.  Everytime i wanted to print something, I had to reinstall the drivers!  Switched to MSI and all my problems went away!  Well, it became time to upgrade again and I wanted USB 4.0 really bad.  MSI had nothing and Asus had a board that advertised 4.0..  So going against my better judgement (it had been 8 years!  I justified that they had to have gotten their act together by now!). I purchased the x670e board, RAM, and cpu..  and it ran great!  I was doing my upgrade in steps..  a little later, I upgraded a lesser computer.. I took the liquid cooling off the Asus and put it on my smaller system because I had a new, larger cooler for the Asus.  it refused to boot.  i put the old cooler back on it..   still refused to boot..  so i finished the upgrades on the smaller system, and decided to move the Asus into a new case and bought a 360 cooler as well...  got it all together.. and no boot.  so i began systematically going through it.  reseated the RAM, double checked the wiring on the cooler for the 10th time, reseated the processor, etc...  still nothing.  After a week of trying this and that here and there..  i noticed 2 bent pins on the CPU socket.  so now i have to try to fix them before i can go further... just to keep trying to figure out why this thing refuses to boot...  i just ordered another MSI board!  screw Asus,  another 400 dollar lesson.  Had it booted when it should have, those pins never would have gotten bent.  I'm just hoping this whole ordeal didn't mess up another 600 dollar processor and 200 dollars in RAM!  ill never buy another Asus product as long as i live!  Never again Asus!
I bought an Early ROG back in the 2000 and 7000k Intel era and both of those boards Fried themselves within a Year. Done with ROG. However, I now have a 7600x and have a B650 TUF and it seems to be doing Great!!
I was just about to buy their b650e-e board with a 7800x3d but after this video I might go msi or different direction
How about their cooling systems like the rijuan 2
I have no problems Asus Tuf Gaming X570 - Pro Wifi II, this is a AMD 4 based System so I am  not going to support Asus Motherboards for the next AMD 5 System. I'm looking at a Asrock or Gigabyte motherboard. And I'm not support this brand because of anything funny, but the AM 5 B650 motherboards aren't very good. Not sure how Asus will survive but if they not making good products, then why are we as a consumer supposed to care about the Company?
it doesnt mean the board is fried however it does mean the cpu is not comunicating with the motherboard. in some cases if you try a different cpu it will work fine as in my case BUT i did have another z690 hero that did not work no matter a different cpu memory stick or gbu so i had to RMA that board to asus.  it seems to me that in some cases the board will stay bricked with a 00 qcode but in that case more then likely the board has phisical damage that may not be seen in other cases where changing the cpu does work that is a cpu to board comunication problem.  another error code is 55 also meaning cpu to board comunication problem but that is a lot easer to fix then the 00 qcode. also i just purchased a z790 hero board and after i got the board i installed it and boom i got the 00 qcode with that board to and to top it all off some of the high end intel cpu's like the I9 and some of the I7 cpu's are also failing on there part due to bios defauilt settings that can fry the cpu.  so to sum it all up we are spending big bucks and getting screwed by asus and intel. as far as my RMA of the z790 hero asus wrote me back and said it was my fauilt so it fell out of warrenty and i would have to buy a new board from them so as i stated before we the consumer are getting screwed and we all need to step up and put a stop to all this the consumer should boycott asus and intel untill they get it right and they should not be ripping us off with things like advanced RMA or dening our warrenty because of there failer to produce a product that fuctions as it should after all its our hard earned cash that lines there pockets.
Thank god I went with gigabyte
I think Armoury Crate with the ASUS ROG Chakram crashes my pc so it won't boot. Each time I've bought the mouse eventually the computer wouldn't boot.
It is amazingly stupid that it would VOID your warranty, if you update your bios to FIX a problem that can potentionally BREAK your cpu! I mean, how???? The problem should not have been there since day 1!  I was not even aware and already been benching my system not even on the latest bios update. At least the CPU manufacturers cooperate extending warranty, but the problem in the first place was with the motherboard and bios!
Moral - windows ❌ Apple ✅
omg thats sooo much jay.. have always been a asus guy.. think i might move to gigabyte
I just finished an RMA with Asus.  I bought a ~$2k monitor of theirs and was having dimming issues with the panel.  Three times I sent it in for RMA and each time they sent me a brand-new full retail box unit as replacement.  In the end the design was just bad as all the monitors have this issue, and Asus gave me (not the store I bought it at) a full refund!  I didn't even ask them for the refund - they offered it!  They Fedexed me a check within about 10 days.    Sending me new, not refurbed replacements each time and on such an expensive product says something positive about them.  Perhaps they are learning from their mistakes?!
Just bought a new MOBO from them ROG Z790 Hero and  pins were bent when I've opened the cover. Also just read in some forums that the policy of ASUS is to refuse service when a customer receives a board like this... I always was a fan for the products they have....
Ahh crap, I bought a gaming computer last year that came with a Z790P and it ran fine for a while.  Then games started crashing earlier this year and nothing I've done is resolving my issues.  Wondering if it's the board now...
So;  MSi Tomahawk for a 7950x Build then?
So MUUUCCHHH respect. This is why I've been following you for years x.
Asus identifies itself as a good brand,  since they identify themselves as a great company you just can't do nothing about it,   they are long gone in nardia land where rainbows and unicorns are real to them. they have deceived me a lot, the amount of money and time i have spent in these last 6 years with asus was  bad spent, im one of those who bough the Asus tuf z790-plus combined with the i713700 and i melted the processor and the motherboard with default settings just after 1 year and 9 months i have sent the MB and processor to the vendor and after 1 year im still waiting, is really disgusting because the vendor is associated with asus and they keep telling me they are waitting, i asked for a new CPU and MB and they literally laughed at the phone by saying " ohhh we cant do that, we need to find the origin of the problem to come to a solution bla bla bla...you didnt flash the Bios like you should..." i was and am very disgusted by the support im having,  i just flushed 600euros on the toilet, sorry my language but im not rich but i know they are getting their pockets pretty full, this situation should be in court because i know im not the only one,  and i had the liquid freezer II 420 imagine thaT
And so what motherboard manufacturer do to recommend? I've been using Asus mobo's for 19 years and zero issues.
“Bye the time you realize your MOBO is trash, its too late.” You are so right!. Ive had this B550 MOBO for a few years, nothing but problems, USBs randomly would turn off, PCIe components intermittently disconnected, and when I upgraded my GPU to a 4070ti, The whole system collapsed. It ended up being a crappy, cheap mapping of ASUS design that conflicted the lane communication of the 4070ti with the USB lanes… Im never buying asus again, ever.
If I may add, asus zenfone have problems too. Specifically the 8 flip model suddenly bricks for no reason.
From what I gather, if I'm looking to build or upgrade my system, Asus may not be a viable option anymore, leaving me with a somewhat restricted choice of brands.
Man, I wish I saw this video before I got my 7900X/B650E-F bundle from Micro Center in late February 2024.  I've had nothing but issues with my board since I got it (actually had to exchange the original board because of instability issues with the ram, more than half the time it wouldn't boot, not even to the splash screen, also exchanged the ram just to be safe), and now I'm gonna have to RMA it because of an M.2 issue I'm having (already RMA'ed my M.2 SSD, Samsung said they couldn't find any issues with it and still offered a replacement, which I took) still having issues and the ASUS support agent I just talked to was not helpful at all, and seemed like they hated their job.  I should've just stuck with Gigabyte (had a B550 Elite V2 for 2.5 years, almost no issues, save for some USB instability early on), or maybe I should've looked into ASRock more (had multiple issues with my B450 Pro4 board so I wasn't keen on em before)  Ugh.
have they fixed this issue, or what other mobo's would be a good option other than this one?
their customer support has no capabilities and knowledge...or they pretend not to know. Only response you get is send it in for repair. $$$$$   We need a right to repair push from all tech media creators. I was having an issue with a ROG phone not loading recovery mode. I'm assuming it's a file corruption issue but of course ASSU doesn't offer a software tool for this type of flashing. Another repeated question they asked is am I using third-party software.   I was trying to use recovery mode because sometimes the phone will not boot properly. So I was hoping recovery mode would be a little more effective than system restore. ASUS support had no helping information to provide. My issue is possibly just a simple software (firmware) issue and I would think companies should provide a tool so people can go through some basic trouble shooting, especially when it comes to software. If the issue persisted after attempting to address possible software issues  i would move to hardware.
Why did i not do research before buying a motherboard from Asus,  i hope i don't run into issues
I’m stuck in a bios loop with my asus X670E - pro WiFi motherboard
I had a defective Asus ROG mini itx x470 AM4 board in 2019 the RMA process is a complete wash. Switched to MSI and could never be happier. No more ASUS hardware for me after that.
Anything Asus has manufactured since 2006 is worthless garbage.
Ok now asus having problems too”any body has any experience like a good experience with any motherboard? Because I have  on my rig a rtx 4080super with ryzen 9 7950x3d msi b650pro and my motherboard it’s horrible with overclocking even tho it tell you it supports 7200mtz oc still having problems I had to disabled the   memory context for it to work and still not having a good experience I need a decent am5 ddr5 motherboard thats will work good with everything you throw at it I don’t Mind paying a little more than a budget as long as it work good with no problems I need a good motherboard,has anybody has any experience around here with am5 motherboards? Please help
ASUS has been a fierce competitive brand producing gaming products within the recent years, but no matter what goes, everyone researches what products are best to suit their builds for trust and safety.
It's always like this for almost every great thing...  Start off great then when their leaders get soo high that thier head are in the clouds, they forget about the standards that got their head in the clouds in the first place...  Thank you for making this video.  Trying to build a mid and high end PC for work related computing and this help me decide on not going asus doe stability and reliability.
Here's me thinking of upgrading my mobo etc and looking hard at ASUS 😢 I think I may keep looking 🤔  Not sure which to look at now for a i7 14700k
Does anyone knows how to fix problem with Armoury crate ? . Every time i install this  my pc windows 10 Freeze .. I  do format , clean install , reinstall  nothing works !!!
My Asus mobo acting up and I no longer trust them!
My last Asus build had a flaky LAN port, stability/driver issues and a board that was so fragile (thinner PCBs lately?) that simply pressing lightly on the motherboard around the IO pin headers caused it to shut down suddenly, been building PCs for over 25 years and I have never seen that.
I remember i bought a brand new Asus laptop and realize theres a dead pixel! only realize it at home and not valid for exchange or RMA
I've finally got a refund for 1 of my 2 boards, currently waiting for the second (£275 each). my PC parts supplier have had to replace 3 x 13th gen i9's because of these boards. my husband just sent back his 13th gen i7 because both of our asus boards have fried every CPU within a few months. Ive just ordered the MSI z790 carbon wifi motherboard instead and my husband is moving to AMD
a lot of people on amazon received defective and used boards, I used to trust asus but I have to find another brand.
My asus zephyrus M16 gpu fan is having a loud noise and the device is shaking after 1 year of use..  not worth the money .. don't buy this piece of crap
You know what they say about nose rubbing after you say something.
ASUS makes a lot of OEM boards inside their factory. This quality problem probably goes across several brands.
Running Linux on my  ASUS Nuc 14. Simply amazing. Testing a Rog Flow 16x w/ Linux, incredibly quiet, cool and fast.
About the time of this video (I'm just seeing this now) I built a new pc based on an ASUS TUF Gaming B560M-Plus Wifi motherboard with an i7 11700K. Immediately the problems started. All the error leds jumped into action in all kinds of different patterns. Long story short I had to return the MB with the CPU (+ aftermarket cooler) and RAM installed. Now I never found out for sure that the culprit was in fact the ASUS motherboard but now that I'm seeing this video I'm not that surprised anymore. I have built all my pcs ever since Pentium II (using ASUS MBs among others), so I am no noob. ONLY built that ever went haywire was with this ASUS MB. Coincidence?
Jay I am going for AsRock x670e Taichi can you tell me if this good mobo to get
This morning, I handed over $2,121 dollars for my new build.  Not one component began with the letter 'A'.  Keep up the great work!
I had a really great experience with ASUS RMA recently...They replaced my NUC with a brand new one within a week...
SH**.. I have an ASUS manufactured product
Never forgetting my old TUF laptop that would restrict its intel I7 to 25W under load, because it didnt have the cooling necessary for that chip
I'll never buy ASUS ever again until they know what they are doing. I've purchased recently the most expensive mobo of my life and it's working like shit ! Bad bios, black screen, reboot and even not boot at all.
Hell yeah dude. ASUS is trash
Nothing new for me. I've worked 3 years as service specialst in MSI representative. And you've just noticed that MB prodicers are fuc..d up? Srsly?
AS U SAY ITS TIME TO TELL ASUS WERE THE BRASS IS GOOD FOR U AND THANX
So i don’t know what good Board to get for my 7800x3D
Bought a TUF a year ago (2021 model). The driver own failed for the Wifi driver annoyed me to death!
I just made a new pc. Im glad there’s nothing asus in it.
A year later, I'm curious if anything has been done to address this by Asus?   I am in the process of finalizing the product list for my first custom build in 15 years, and now after months of getting up to date with modern PC tech, I'm wondering if I need to drop any Asus in my list, or if this is still an issue.
You look like a nerdy Mel Gibson
The sad part is that they are still the best even with these quality issues. Asus imo doesn't have any competition.
Finished with Asus have otherwise always bought Asus products have spent over 100,000 on their products in the last 25 years but have recently experienced their new policy money over customers
i remember when ASUS was the brand you pick when you want quality, not this cpu frying BS You just go - get an ASUS board and you are set for the lifespan of that PC. i still have their old A88X-M Plus running fine, I had to save up  more as a kid to get it but to this day it runs with no issues whatsoever!  I swore on ASUS quality, i knew they were the stuff to get if you had a bit deeper pocket. I EVEN RECENLY BOUGHT 2 OF THEIR TUF MONITORS, since i was completely unaware of this situation -_-  I might need a brand recommendation for the future purchases...
I'm currently dealing with my own RAM stability issues on a asus rog strix Z690G. Random blue screens, windows freeze, and crashes. Swapped out the RAM, processor, and PSU before finally discovering it was a bad DIMM slot and decided to send in the motherboard for RMA. They gaslit and denied anything was wrong with the board and just sent it back... First thing that happens after I set everything back up was another memory boot failure.  F@ck me I guess I'll just not be able to use all 4 sticks of RAM and just go down to two. Last time I ever buy an ASUS product. Pathetic...
I grade products by problems, cause corporations never fix problems, they make excuses.
@JayzTwoCents you should hear about HP and my experience with them....which I have in writing.
"But you don't care" at the end had me cracking, but ya FyAsus!
I am still rock'n the ASUS RAMPAGE V Extreme from 2014 and it supports all modern tech.  I have onboard m.2 @ 4TB, 64GB ram. 8 core 5960x proc, and 2080ti.  My 10 yo rig rocks balls.
I gotta a question for Jay is it wise to go for Gigabyte Aorus X670e Pro x MB
Do you still stand by this and if so what brand do you recommend now? MSI or GIGABYTE for a motherboard?
ROG hasn't been about actual gamers since they got rid of the laptops with large cooling channels.
Wish I had known before I bought my asus MOB ..new from box to build only to have to contact asus with a no power/no post issue...just to be told it was a bad MOB from factory. Left waiting for asus to call me back after talking to them and stuck with a dead build.
Watching this a year later and I had a similar issue.  Ordered an Asus RTX 4070 TUF from Amazon, which was a return but was supposed to be fully working.  Wasted 3 hours trying to get it to work, drivers would not recognise the card, artifacts when booting to windows, could only run one monitor.  Send back bought a brand new one, and it went in like a dream.  Will never again buy anything discounted as a return.  My guess is someone screwed there card up, ordered a new one, swapped the card out and sent it back.
I was here on June 1st 2024.
Does this apply only to mobos or gpu as well ?
"that is the 3rd wall" 🤣
Damn I got a build with an ASUS MB but now I'm scared since watching this video lol.
I watched this videp not realizing its from 2023 a year agp now - after GN Ausu Ally video.
I wish I had seen your video before I had purchased my Asus laptop, I bought an Asus G733py-xs98 in 2023 and have had nothing but problems with it since the day I got it ( not able to return it now). Asus is replacing my laptop & I have a choice of two laptops to choose from and wanted a little input. I was given the option of the Asus  ROG Strix SCAR 17 X3D Gaming Laptop (2023) New or ROG Strix SCAR 18 (2024) G834JYR-XS97 new. In my old system my memory has 64GB the new offers only come with 32GB. Also the ROG Strix SCAR 17 X3D Gaming Laptop (2023 has 3D which I no nothing about in laptop/computers, on the other hand the ROG Strix SCAR 18 (2024) G834JYR-XS97 has i9 Processor 14900HX 2.2 GHz. My primary use for the laptop is rendering with light gaming. If you had no choice but to pick one of the replacements which would you choose? Thanks -Kimber
I'm here because 2 years after purchasing an ASUS B550i, I bought an RTX 4070 Super and found out that this MB has crashing issues with RTX 4000 cards. There are numerous Reddit and Forum posts about it and ASUS has known for over a year and has yet to fix or acknowledge the issue. Never buying ASUS again.
Love this. Asus has given me the worst customer experience ever. It was my first experience with them after buying the Rog Ally and will never purchase this brand again. I just don’t have a voice so love that someone like you has disclosed the terrible consumer ethics Asus has.
In my opinion, ASUS does things in a 'conventional' way. Just take a MSI or Gigabyte (any other but I saw 1 or 2 same as Asus - same A320 entry level boards) - just look at the layout of the ICs, capacitors - the way they are arranged - Asus just has a lot more of it (more complicated like a maze) than other brands.
Jay, you obviously damaged those boards when you opened them. Asus does not warranty physical damage by the customer.   You do realize that you need to wear a hazmat suit and install the boards only within a vacuum?
I have had a ton of pc issues and I'm not incompetent in troubleshooting. But it took me several years to figure out all the issues I was having had ASUS logos. Im done with this brand also, 1 motherboard workstation that wont post Z10PE-D16WS, 1 motherboard frequently crashes  A88X-Pro, Graphics card died after 2 year R9 295x2, returned buggy wifi router RT-AC68U. All i have now is 2 monitors and 3 routers AX11000, AXE16000, AX6100, and the all frequently drop connections and devices though out my house. I spent enough to figure out its all ASUS fault I have this issues. They spent to much time on pretty equipment  and not enough on quality. I'm never buying anything ASUS again.
last few years I'm watching this AMD this good AMD that good, pushing AMD  and at thew same time throwing sh*t against Intel products  looks like Karma found you finally  I have multiple ASUS (intel) products in my systems, I keep using them, they all work perfectly, overclocked, no error for years.
How interesting.  I had a same problem with the ASUS ROG Z790 HERO
Okay lets stop for a second now! I understand you dont want to roast any more company here, but i had 2 times the exact same issues with amd chip and cpu. Same shit like asus.
It’s been a year. You should watch your latest video to see how things are going now.
Seems like ASUS has an extremely poor management culture and is mismanaged.
if any venders are out there watching this you guys should sell all asus crap at cost and be done with them
I used to buy Asus TUF boards for my builds because of their rock-solid reliability and value for the buck but my experiences with their "support" starting with the Z590 then the issue-ridden Z690 when all they did was claiming I was responsible for my problems with their product well, the buck stops here.  I've been building PC's for relatives, friends and acquaintances since the late 80's, must've assembled over 100 of them, I know my stuff enough to tell I wasn't the one at fault for crappy software. They made me so mad I turned to... AsRock now that it wasn't part of Asus anymore and was gaining a reputation for crude-looking but reliable products. I admit I did it out of spite and it was just for a demo X790 system but it turned out to perform so  flawlessly I started building more as clients were asking for them (the systems) since they were less expensive than those based on MSI or Gigabyte, though not by much all things considered. I have no idea if AsRock has a good support record regarding major problems because I have yet to encounter any issue I couldn't fix myself with those boards. As for Asus, I will still use their GPU's but only if a client demands it, otherwise there 's plenty of alternatives.
I guess MSI is the way to go. I'm still not confident with Asrock yet till I see the real reviews on it. What a shame. Been using Asus for over 10 years. Made 7 builds with it. Will be doing a new build soon cause only stick of ram works in my Asus motherboard. Besides, there prices proves they think their 5h1t don't stink. Maybe they will listen when people stop buying their product. Good luck with that Asus. Scares run deep.
I’m done with Asus too, a motherboard I bought was defective in 3 of the ram slots out of 4 .
As a asus fanboi   I am really ashame of my own pc in my room that is mostly asus branded
Yeah, after years on gigabyte I went for asus mb + intel cpu bundle in a local eshop and damn did I fk up... No way to hit the max. XMP clocks... Going down the rabbit hole I found out these boards just do not work properly even after like 20 bios versions... The funniest part is the xmp clocks are "up to" so no way to claim an issue under warranty. Never doing the same mistake like this again.
I would love for BestBuy to drop them from their stores. Z690-e I had sitting new for a while just went nuts all kinds of stuff. Hopefully it didn’t take the cpu with it.
So Republic transformed into an Empire, i never liked that company, my every experience with them was extremely uncomfortable and negative.
This video could have been filmed just today
I bought asus z790 prime a. I really don’t know what to think about it 🙂🙃
Finally realising this in May 2024... Asus now have resorted to scamming consumers...
Thanks again Jay, you truly don’t know how much my heart/ pockets feel like right now, I was literally all in on ASUS and then this happens, to which I already have a bad temper/ disposition towards someone else’s stupidity when it concerns my 💰💰 , I 💕 you I think ur the best friend any of geek would ever appreciate AGAIN!!! THANK YOU BRO 👍🏿💯💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💕💪🏿👑
ASUS: Oops I did it again
No, that is an admission that we cannot fix our engineering and we are going to let you brick it then blame you for it. Corporate WIN WIN!
Wish I saw this before I bought a laptop from them. I lost $3k in a laptop that died after 1yr and 2 mo.
Indeed Asrock has done solid job with their AM5 motherboards
man i have been an ASUS fan from back in the AM2 days before i could afford anything Intel. very limited back then as you know... always stood by ASUS but this last year both Intel and ASUS have let me down when i relied on them the most to come through. i purchased A PC worth 7k for the first time i was able to have the best of the best of whatever i wanted so i went with my usual picks but the top of the line this time instead of the usual entry - mid level i could only ever afford.... ill tell you what! from the unstable, over bearing, i9 13900k sweat chip to the Strix Z790-F Motherboard im done! as soon as i can afford to I'm going to wipe my ass with them and throw them into oblivion. have had a nightmare of instability for nearly a year now with the last 4 months it morphed into Constant crashing and BSOD Loops. 100's of hours trying to troubleshoot, countless reformatting, numerous BIOS version tests, component tests and an ongoing headache, i have finally been able to dwindle down the problem to being 95% faulty motherboard 5% possible faulty Chip.... these supposed high end, top of the line components at the time i purchased them worth close to $2000 NZD are absolute garbage!!!! (mainly the board if it is indeed the main culprit) which after tests by a pro IT i know and his colleague they both have landed on it being the board which was in my top 3 as the main fault. whatever is wrong with this sad excuse of technology has had me ripping my face off! i don't know whats wrong with it being less than a year old and started off fine for three months has turned into constant BSOD Loops 90% of which happen back to back to back endlessly, before i can even get to the windows login screen, halfway through reformatting, but most the time not even that far!. after some testing using the original bios version that's stamped/stickered on the board or 50 / 50 the newest which for my gen Asus board is 2202 and going into BIOS to change the default power limits and enable intel's fail safe because these guys have no idea wtf they are doing anymore i get maybe 50 / 50 stability... i can actually play AAA games max setting as you would expect with such a setup, just never know for how long before yours truly gets hit with BSOD Loops compliments of these morons. (Mostly ASUS) and now some Intel, with most their 13th & 14th gen releases. and i have no figured out with ASUS when i do manage to fresh reformat and just install the basics I.E Chipset Drivers, GPU Drivers, WIFI, and Windows Updates etc it seems to hold its self together OK without much sign of problems, so then i go and Install Armoury Crate so i can run and change my "High End ASUS components lighting, mouse buttons etc and instant crash BSOD and im back in the BSOD Loops instantly. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! as soon as i can get my money back I'm done with these idiots. sorry for the massive Rant but after nearly a year of this crap on and off and constantly the past few months this is the least i want to say about them lol.
never agian asus
ASUS absolutely sucks … why !!!  Reasons: premium pricing comparing towards many third party brands, but many bugs and hardware defect after stress test, out of box hardware failure going 1 to 1 exchange
And here we are 1 year later and they're doing the exact same thing
I will not buy ASUS product anymore, since i have been dissapointed by they stupid CID rules...No More ASUS
This aged like fine wine. [They did it again].
My Asus threadripper system has been blue screening many times a day this is a new starting about two weeks ago, but its not everyday.
The thing that really pisses me off is a LOT of people thought it was AMD's CPUs that were faulty over this. Not for AMD's sake, but just for the sake of truth and being able to learn which product is broken or not. ASUS needs to be LOUD about these issues when they come up. Why do companies try and be shady? The companies that own up and GET BETTER when crap like this comes up, always do better in the long run.  A year later and we have the RMA problems brought up front and center by GN. ASUS must think because they make high end, fancy "Republic of Gamers" ROG and have been popular that no one will care. I mean no one does when Nvidia (who also makes fancy high end components) screws their customers on VRAM and price right? The problem is this: most people buy high end crap as a flex, as a status symbol. As an American, I can tell you this is everywhere. Most people can't even see the benefit of paying for Halo tier crap without a frame counter. I'm guilty of this as well.  We are setting the standard of being customers that are willing to take this shit, like an abusive relationship.
ASUS needs new leadership who will not take any incompetence and fire the employee's bringing down the company... All the brands can and do have bad runs and one hopes ASUS will come back, but I wouldn't buy any of their stuff at the moment either
This aged like a fine wine.
Who's here after GN
WHY are companies that are there to supply the gaming community FUCKING gamers over? Modern bullshit and dirty corporate ideas to squeeze every penny out of us instead of working with us. PSN, Ubisoft, Asus, journalists just writing bullshit. The price of games and the quality is a joke in 2024.
Lose the annoying background music.
Jay or anyone in the comments, I've been using Asus since 1996 with their first motherboard a Pentium 1 socket 7. It was the very first board with a  CPU temp sensor. I was 11 which I built it. I've also switched to MSI and onetime I used Aopen. but I kept going back to Asus. my latest build is the Asus z790 Pro art Creators. with an Asus 320 mm AIO cooler and a Asus Tuff RTX4090 and Asus 4K HDR monitor. I have a lot of good luck with the equipment but what is teh top brand for motherboards today that seems to have the best quality and warranty support? I guess times are changing in the tech world. Is MSI a great brand to fall back on? Is Asrock I've never used Asrock I always saw it as a joke of Asus. I do have a gigabyte board but It's not my main system.   I've been following you for years, love your content.
I bought my Asus MB before watching your videos. So far so good, no issues. I have a b650m TUF. I uninstalled Armoury crate though because their software is indeed poor. I have EXPO memories and they are working fine. no fancy stuff on my PC though. No OC
ASUS quality hits an egg against a stone
What im seeing is 1 little bear had a bad experience so now all of his friends must join in
Asus didn't change much over a year, even now days after a hole year it has gotten even worse... This is sad
I will ask what do you recommend as the alternative between like Gigabyte, Asrock, MSI etc for boards? I’ve been on Asus since my first build in 2012, looking to build a new one because my rig from 2017 finally died enough to merit me start a new build.
I've had an asrock MB for 5 years and never had an issue.
I fired ASUS 5 years ago with a brand new nonfunctional board.  Bought a Gigabyte and no problems.  Actually bought two 390 Gigabyte boards.  My new build is a MSI and it's running great.  Although MSI is overvolting the Intel CPU and they are being forced by Intel to fix it.  Tried to install the ne 3.0 BIOS and it failed after three tries and I gave up.
Damn I wish I knew this before buying the QHD screen RoG Flow X13 that thing was $2,499 too
I got burned for $300 on an RTX 3060 that was advertised on Amazon sans power spec... not even a picture of the port, no cable, and after 3 months of research haven't been able to find a tech who can figure it out.  ASUS techs kept passing me around and finally blamed the problem on the psu manufacturer, who returned the compliment back to ASUS.  I understand the support for ASUS is all outsourced, but they don't even publish owner information for this gpu on their website for a popular product that's only 3 years old.   Shoddy and crooked.
i used only msi since 2010, no problem at all.still have my n460gtx cyclone and its working fine!
Anyone watch Gamers Nexus asus vid?  Lmao they just keep screwing themselves 😭
This has aged like fine wine after the Gamer's Nexus post today. LOL
A year later, and Jay is still using ASUS in his systems...I wonder if Steve's newest video regarding his experience with his ASUS Ally will REALLY make Jay stop using ASUS.
im back to watch this after the GN new Asus RoG Ally video
This aged very well after this latest GN vid and the recent 4090 repair cost quote. Well done JayZ!
This is so insane to see now when gamersnexus just put up their "asus scammed us" video, wow... ASUS is so scummy .....i will never guy another product from them.
ASS-US.  😂
I find myself back here because of Gamers Nexus and Louis Rossmans videos, and the way ASUS treats their customers. It looks like this has been going on for a very long time and you were right! I’ve had some great ASUS products but also have had an awful return process with them. I will not buy anything from them again.
Jay, sorry to say that I just found your channel, but I am now going thru your more recent videos. My comment is more of a question. Us mere mortals don't have the same exposure to manufacturers that you do. I have always used and found Asus to be reliable and therefore never needed their consumer help. What MB manufactures measure up to consumer trust in the absence of Asus? Who do you find good, solid component, least problems and the best to work with as a replacement and WHY?
long time ago i bought a ASUS B75 Motherboard P8B75-V LGA 1155 2nd hand. it was working perfectly then and when i was moving it to a new pc case a drop of my sweat fell into the pcb, not on a chip or mosfet--just the pcb that doesn't have any chip on it. guess what? it didn't work even after drying it. from then on NO MORE ASUS product for me. maker of weak products, what a shame
What asus is doing is BULLSHTA
I really regret buying the Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard! The BIOS updates are a nightmare; I'm stuck rolling back to version 2602 even though version 3501 is available. ASUS customer service has been no help at all—they don't seem to read the emails thoroughly since they keep suggesting fixes I’ve already tried multiple times. Also, let’s not forget the infamous issue with the Maximus Z690 Hero motherboards having misattached capacitors that could cause fires. Luckily, mine didn’t catch fire, but it's still not functioning properly!
Armoury crate app is slowing down my laptop🤮
Recently had bought an Asus MB last year and it was having crashing problems and issues with the BIOS that uses things like webcam drivers from 2011 which causes issues with Microsoft. Finally got tired of dealing with it and return the board couple weeks later and went with a MSI MB and its been steady as ever. Won't go back to their product which is sad I have used a lot of their graphic cards and currently have one but wont be trading it out for another one once I swap it.
Yeah, i got scammed by Asus on a gpu warranty claim, bad fan. They said the gpu had been tampered with and they tried to charge me for a bunch of repairs. I always keep video records of everything, including unboxing and first run when installing expensive new hardware, having had to deal with these companies in the past. The card was new out of box. Plugged in and 1 fan has a bad bearing. I had to file a complaint with the ACCC and provide the full video to Asus to get it resolved. It took 7 months. That was my last Asus purchase.
I just rma'd a 4070ti strix card and they sent me a physically gouged card as a replacement that had sharpie covering the scratches. They better send me either a replacement or a new card. that's just unacceptable as their remanufactured standards. this i honestly a joke. last time i invest in a asus product.
Sounds like your build pc, had a bad batch board, thru the soldering process. Used to be the production  manager for an engineering company, using Rohs pcb's in many varied fields. 99.9% of the time, random faults were down to poor solder profile loaded into solder flow process, more often than not, pushing them thru too quickly, to keep up with their orders (used subcontractors to populate) Rohs solder process has a very, very narrow window of correct temps and time frames, which if not followed to the T, would see batch failure rates around 20 to 35% at best, far higher, the further these flow profiles are fiddled with. Have a look under a microscope, for cold soldering on the pcb's, as if you see it on visible components, you can 100% guarantee the BGA components Will have terrible joints. BTW  i left said company after CEO refused to bin bad batches, sent em off to the US market (after telling him they would most likely fail) then got blamed when they arrived atop 2 mountains in their forests ( were fire service comms devices!). Lets just say, our last meeting was not a quiet one!
Ok so I'm slowly piecing together my first build I bought a Asus Rog Strix Z790-H. It is an Intel mobo. Should I be worried about it failing.
Uratowałeś mnie przed zakupem części Asus za kwotę 5000$ dzięki. Pozdrawiam z Polski 👌😎
I'm sorry asus... but you're fired!  I agree, Asus only sell crap now, defective items. Wrongly made designs & their support sucks.  So, I am done with them completely, becuase they have become a bunch of idiots.  Thank you for the video & good luck.  And Bye Asus, I am boycotting you completely.  CSL & OUT...
Hello :) was there an update to asus' way of handling stuff? id expect a company like asus to shift
The new workforce.  The veterans are retiring, and this young generation doesn't care about workplace standards.  Pooky was supposed to separate the returns. Instead, he sent the boards out to you.  Started complaining about work-life balance and not being paid enough to send you the right motherboard.
I recently bought an azus z790 board (Used) but looks new but about four pins were bent slightly. Yes it's used but watching this and seeing the state of the board that I got, makes me wonder if they got it with the bent pins and didn't realized until they installed it and popped the socket.
ASUS IS TRASH
Six days later and still no replacement motherboard, lots of promises but no action.
I fired Asus a long time ago ! they make trash !
The Asus Tuf Gaming Gt501 case is awesome  Though I haven't had the pleasure of going through customer service for any issues either
this is really disappointing to hear. I will pay extra for a reliable honest brand. I am looking to replace my old ASUS computer and not having a good brand to rely on will make it harder for me to research new computer parts.
I am/was a big fan of Asus. At the moment I have their 27inch 2k monitor, Hero maximus X motherboard and Asus lapotop. What brand can I switch to because the other one that was my go to was Gigabyte. Any suggestions or are all brands crap now.
ASUS is the worst pc purchase Ive ever made
Thanks for this Jay!!!!!
Is there a update on this, I was shopping around and found this damming ASUS ROG review?
I must agree. Bought a new ASUS board (Z690-A) back in 2022. Broke down after 1 year. A let down. My system was always based on ASUS motherboards. No problems. Had to revert to an older ASUS motherboard which is still is running good. Quality issues? Yes probably. Blowed also my new 2TB Samsung NMVe up. Warranty gone. Motherboard went back into repair. A 1st in all the time when I build PC's for 20 years. No more ASUS for me now.
Je suis sur le cul , cette marque était le fer de lance maintenant c'est embourgeoisé quel tristesse
Respect. I rarely watch your channel anymore but I respect anyone who finally turns his back to all these big companies
After getting their ROG Ally, I have been leaning in hard on Asus. The handheld outperforms my aging desktop, and I have been looking at building a new rig. Your video has opened my eyes, and I now have to consider a different brand. Thanks for standing with the people instead of profits.
You could not buy their products and not wait for random YT to call them out for the shit you know its design to f you over.
Thanks for being truthful
Thank you so much Jay. I've done three custom builds so far since I got into being a PC hobbyist. And all three builds had ASUS mobos in them. However after researching everything that you are presenting here, and can confirm to be true, I congratulate Asus in saying, you lost my business.
TLDR: ASUS scammed thousands of customers through lies and deception, denying their own international in-warranty repair service.   To whoever reads this, ASUS screwed my hard back in 2019. They claimed to have an international warranty service for their laptops. In short, you could request in-warranty repair in one country regardless if you bought the laptop in another as long as both were found in the same region.   In my case, I bought an ASUS TUF laptop from amazon USA while living in Mexico. I did this SOLELY based on their claim of international warranty, both USA and Mexico are in the same region (North America), and they were even directly listed (alongside with Canada) to be eligible for international warranty.  Unfortunately, a couple months after buying the laptop it completely died, would not turn on NO MATTER WHAT. So I got a hold of ASUS Mexico and explained the situation, they told me they could do NOTHING about it and that I would have to deal with ASUS USA for that matter. At the same time, ASUS USA refused to RMA because the laptop was going to be shipped from Mexico. Even after DIRECTLY citing BOTH THEIR WARRANTY POLICIES, showing how BOTH listed this international warranty service policy, they denied it and played dumb. Never got my laptop fixed.
Looking back, I really wish I had seen this coming! About a year and a half ago, I put together a computer based on Jay's recommendation. Everything seemed fine until late January, when both the motherboard and CPU decided to call it quits. Luckily, Intel replaced the CPU in just 10 days, but ASUS, the motherboard manufacturer, wasn't as swift. They initially sent back the same defective board, claiming it was new. After sending it back again in March, I'm still waiting for a replacement here in April.  Just this week, they offered to send a board worth $150. Mine originally cost over $350, so I declined, hoping for a comparable or identical replacement. Frustrated with the ongoing ordeal, I even reached out to the President's office for assistance, receiving a response but still no board.  This computer is crucial for my business, so the delay has been incredibly frustrating. Suffice it to say, I won't be buying ASUS products again.  (I have included my email to the president office below, been a real nightmare.)  Ron  I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the handling of my recent support case involving a damaged ROG MAXIMUS XIII HERO motherboard, which is currently under warranty. My expectation of prompt and efficient service has been grossly undermined by the significant delays and inconsistent communication from your team.  In late January, I sent you my defective motherboard and after two weeks, I was informed that it was going to be replaced with a new board.  About a week later, I received the new motherboard, only to learn from my computer tech that it was the same defective motherboard I sent in the first place!  This is after hours of him working to get it fixed and then informed your board also destroyed my CPU which had to be replaced.  Then on March 25, 2024, I dispatched the defective motherboard to your service center for repair or replacement again, as per the guidelines outlined by ASUS Support. It has now been nearly three weeks since ASUS received the motherboard, far exceeding the promised timeframe of 7 to 10 days for resolution. This prolonged period of inactivity has caused substantial disruption to my business operations, resulting in significant financial losses and undue stress.  My frustration is compounded by the lack of transparency and consistency in the status updates provided by ASUS Support. Despite repeated inquiries, I have received generic, pre-written responses that offer no meaningful insight into the progress of my case. Furthermore, when attempting to check the status online, I have encountered conflicting information, with different links providing contradictory updates on whether the product is still undergoing diagnosis/repair or has progressed to the replacement stage.  This inconsistency and lack of clarity are wholly unacceptable, particularly given the critical nature of the device in question. As a business user, I rely heavily on my computer system for essential tasks, and the extended downtime has had a severe impact on my productivity and profitability. I expect ASUS, as a reputable provider of hardware solutions, to uphold the highest standards of customer service and professionalism.  I cannot believe you actually sent me back my original motherboard, stating to me it was replaced with a new one!  Therefore, I demand immediate action to expedite the resolution of my case and provide me with a clear timeline for the completion of repairs or the replacement of the motherboard. Additionally, I request transparent and accurate updates on the status of my product, delivered through personalized communication channels rather than generic responses.  Furthermore, I urge ASUS to review its internal processes and address any systemic issues that may be contributing to these delays and communication failures. It is imperative that steps are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future and restore trust in ASUS as a reliable service provider.  Failure to address these concerns promptly and satisfactorily will compel me to explore alternative avenues for resolution and escalate this matter to higher authorities. I trust that ASUS values its customers and reputation and will take swift and decisive action to rectify this situation.  I expect a prompt response to this complaint, detailing the actions being taken to resolve the issue and restore confidence in ASUS Support.  Sincerely,  Ron
What companies like Asus do is they build up their brand with high quality, great customer service. Then, they simply screw over their loyal customers by turning to shit.
Thank you!! You LITERALLY just saved me from buying the ASUS ROG Strix Z790-A Gaming WiFi II !!!
"for us to say, hey, keep your -" (different voice entirely) "stuff" (first voice again) "it's a pretty big deal" :D
Thank You!!!
Hello from Canada eh! Congratulations, please publish a video of manufacturers, if any, that have consistently held the same or better high standards of quality and ethics as you.  I recommend you read the book "In Search of Excellence" and recommend it to the new generation of CEOs.
I have avoided asus since 97-98. Had three products from them. All failed in a month. Never bothered with them again.
I've never built a computer, and I don't know much about it.  I'm just starting to learn by watching these videos.  I know not to buy a motherboard from asus.
Damn, this is a hard pill to swallow. Been using ASUS motherboards since 2008 and I loved their software like AI-suite and their UEFI was superior for my needs compared to when I had MSI a few years ago. This is reprehensible.
You're right, the support from Asus is very bad. I wanted a Polymo Pannel as a replacement for a Rog Crosshair X670e Hero. Unfortunately the support says you can't get it. Unfortunately I'll switch to another brand
I only found you a couple of weeks ago when I was troubleshooting a PC upgrade (Forgot to update the BIOS before putting a newer AM4 in, derp) but I really appreciate the integrity and lack of tolerance for greedy corporate BS yourselves and Gamer Nexus show. You've quickly become two of my most trusted resources for PC building knowledge.
Good Call, I own a Asus Rog Strix GL702VSK LAPTOP and guess what it was a lemon from day 1 realised I got to Undervolt the CPU, overheating problem, crash during game... its a good office desktop. nothing more.
Never buy Asus. My laptop failed within 24 hours of sale. Asus replaced the motherboard ( they should have given a new piece) and now after one year it shuts down automatically.
Now ASUS apparently refuses to sell product. Many people have had problems purchasing ASUS products over the last 2 years. ASUS just repeatedly cancels orders without explanation. Some people even go as far as calling the CEO office to clear their purchase. I tried this myself and had ASUS cancel 4 orders, using 4 credit cards from both Amazon AND their own website. Something is very wrong at ASUS.
i always have issues with MSI
they want to see if you can fix it to see if you know how to work on computers lol
I’ve just thrown away an ASUS Strix B650e-f motherboard as I had faulty RAM rails a1 and a2 and I couldn’t get an RMA from ASUS, After months of being without a machine I have now bought an MSI which has fixed the issue but I am £200 out of pocket!
Asus Volvo'ed
Just received a reply from RMA for in warranty z790e mobo. They are charging me for labor and parts despite having 2 more years left in manufacturers warranty for labor and parts. Never buying Asus again.
Thank you for this! Thank goodness I saw this before beginning my next PC build! I was going to go with ASUS parts as I have been a fan of them in the past. Never again.
I worked with a number of ASUS enterprise products, and the servers were complete trash right out of the box
10+
sent this to my buddy that always tries to shill overpriced asus rog stuff to me
Ive always noticed that my builds consisting of Asus have always been the quickest to bite the dust in one way or another. Thank you Jayz for putting your own funds and neck on the line to bring the issues to light.
I just got the asus rog strix x670e-a gaming. I’m wondering if I should return it and get something else 🤔
Sounds like Asus dumped the channel and channel is butthurt
Perfect example of unprofessionalism and false neediness, Smart move.
Heroe maximuim 11 is dog 🐕  💩 it won't want 😂 bios update with wifi or flash update.   If it's on Default bios it only wants ethernet cable too then bios update 😂
Thank you for your honest review and comments on Asus quality and customer support.  I have sworn by Asus quality for years in my past builds as the “go to” brand for gamers.  I will be looking elsewhere from now on based on this content.  They just messed up big time!
this could explain my 2020 zenbook issue that I have, ASUS dropping in quality - screenpad issue (fixed from warranty) - Bluetooth issue (fixed from warranty) - microphone broken - USB port broken  and yet the old ROG I had from them was GREAT!
I did a build and when it got a orange dram issue, think my fault due to expo, anyway I striped it down and theres a bent pin!! but I messed up and touched it and bent 2/3 more. Basically the board bricked and wouldnt reset on cmos, battery out (even tired a new battery) There support said speak to the place you brought it but will they accept a board with bent pins. Its was my mistake not checking it (did I do it now when I was careful and know what Im doing)! great video!
Ngl glad my asus motherboard was DOA at least i can switch it before catastrophic problems
Hey everyone. I forgot about this video and just got my 670e-f amd board which I will be using a 7800x3d on. Is this board still having issues. Should I just return it and go to another manuafacturer?
Was working on a new build and this popped up (Thanks YouTube for scraping all my data...) and I'll certainly re-consider my Asus ROG board. Thanks for looking out for the Public Jay!
i was just about to order an Asus Motherboard and i was searching for your review, and i found this, absolutely going other brand now.
stopped buying ASUS for our company because of you .. thank you.      it's only about 300 pc's but still gonna make a dent
You were too kind to them.  I loved your words man I got off ASUS after it was time to move on from my X99 Deluxe.   I read all these reviews above these things wrong with their motherboards.   I wish I could remember what, but I have been king-hit then beaten while still unconscious, so I can't remember much
Is this controversy still a thing are have they been forgiven. I can’t find more recent things on this and other things. If someone could tell me I would like to know.
and i mean i ordered my asus prime z690, i just have to pray
the "we so sorry" tune in 6:49 was damn funny lol
I bought an Asus Tuf Gaming B650 last week and it wouldn’t turn on.  Before that I had a brand new Gigabyte board and it had damaged pins.
Yeah I'm done with them. Sure they don't care, but a lot of people will ask me what is a good brand to buy and I am directing them elsewhere from now on.   Earlier products were great under the brand, now they are crap. Its the typical formula, more money, more execs who are rich kid dirtbags who don't know anything about business except how to cut quality. Boeing syndrome.
This makes me worry about the fact that im new to pc building and was leaning hard in asus [ROG] just for the fact that the first pc i bought had asus a320m-k with a 3 3100 that ran beautifully right up until i built my first rig this month, it has a ROG B550-f with a 7 5800x. Now im wonderring if my temp problems are the borad.
i agree TOTTALY  You Got Ball's !!! thanks for showing what the general customer experience you could not be more clear. My regards from Holland
yea. just bought a bricked 4070 ti super. The reviews on b650 boards are terrible. Bricked new gpu at 850.00. They have had the card for 2weeks, 4 days. They are going to replace my new card with somebody elses rms'd card. New given an old card fuc asus
I've got a Crosshair 670E HERO board with an AMD 7950X and have been constant USB disconnect issues the past year or so. I'll be sitting here working and then hear multiple USB disconnect chimes, the mouse stops working and drives disappear--and then everything reconnects. Sometimes it happens every 10 minutes or so. Sometimes, it happens every couple of hours. It's driving me nuts because when the drives reappear and AV scans through everything, I have to close multiple windows each time it happens. I haven't installed a new BIOS since I bought this PC from Origin. I'm hoping there might be a fix in the BIOS since the board has been out for more than a year, but to be honest, I'm scared to try and install new BIOS on this board since I've heard such horror stories. Any thoughts?
asus has horrible support the arabs do not speak good english
10 months later, and I was about to purchase an ASUS product.  In my shopping cart and everything, waiting on payday.  …Then I watched this video, and am now on the hunt for literally anything else.
They sent me a broken aio and completely snubbed me with it. Bad RMA experience. I bought 6 aios.... 3 120mm  Rog Ryo's and 3 240mm rog Ryos. One 240mm had a  broken pump line at the pump side, right the the fastener coming out the pump. The only way i couldve got a refund was to fip m myself opening the box... thats what i do when i buy from ebay.... im going to have to treat ASUS like a random person on eaby rather than the multi million dollar corporation that they are.
I will buy another brand for motherboard for sure . Thanks
march 2024 still random crashes and intel ethernet driver going out randomly
what do I do my previous ryzen 9 5900x exploded last year and I looked in hwinfo64 a few weeks ago and tested it under load and it was reporting 50-60% "power reporting deviation" I contacted asus and they said they basically can't help me
Asus still owes me a motherboard on RMA
Im running a MSI z790 with no problems.
Should raffle those motherboards if they are just sitting around doing nothing. Let some normies try and ticker it out
I wish I'd seen this video before committing myself to buying an X670E.  It's only been a nightmare since I bought this motherboard and tried to return it under warranty.
if I may , I've heard and constated with a lot of videos & reviews that marketing management of fame brands is what causes the majority of those teck problems ,may be capitalism targeting goals in some manners ,but let say this after covid pandamic prices are in ascension and no one can say where it is going in the market ,even gigabyte , msi aorus have a decline the quality compare b350 with b650 in durability ...
Honestly this whole video just makes me laugh.  jay is getting treated like a regular customer while not having to pay for anything and because he has a YouTube channel thinks his opinion to a company matters when he prob hasn’t paid for anything in years. One of the most immature ways to make a video he is whining that his free motherboard doesn’t work and that he isn’t getting another free one along with free accessories.
I have been spending tens of thousand on Asus products  every year and I have no issues with their products.  Besides Asus gives very good aftersales support in my region. You're probably just bitter that you couldn't have it your way with Asus... You being biased about your opinions isn't something new and smart people will know this fact. Good luck trying.
I still like Asus. They made the first laptop that I used as a kid, so I bought an Asus MB for my first PC build and I don't have any regrets, other than wondering why a modern board came with RGB hookups instead of A-RGB
So unfortunate.  Asus was such a good company 8 years ago.  Top tier in fact- must be a bunch of inclusivity hires if I were to guess.
damn I just watched this after I bought and built new pc with B760M-Plus D4. I never had issues with Asus so far. Hopefully this one stays safe. What other brand do you guys recommend?
It's just plain carelessness and very informative. Don't pay your employees enough or reduce benefits = crap.
I had 4 transformer tablet books for my family. They shut down the server to unlock bootloaders so now a have 4 bricks that were not cheap. That absolutely ruined them for me. Had many of there networking and other products. They will not get anymore of my money. They did apologize for my frustration.😂😡🖕 how many customers hardware was rendered useless. Now that is customer service.
Bought a Asus ROG Strix Aura 1000W psu 2 days ago. Now i think i will return it and buy a FSP Hydro Ti Pro 1000W instead
my asrock motherboard still rock
I just bought an asus motherboard and didn't even know about this, pray for me brothers
ASUS used to be the premium high-end motherboard maker. But Linus put them and all his personal and work computers posted them all over his YouTube channel so they can the default brand for all custom computers. They have enough market share now to slack off and make shitty products
I have been building all my personal rigs with the Crosshair line of motherboards for so long, this is such a bummer to hear. Now I am ready to build a new rig and wanted to jump to the 7800x3d w/ Crosshair 670 Hero... I guess its time to do a deep dive into what the heck I should actually be building this generation. Or do i just wait for the next one and let my current cpu setup ride (5800x with Crosshair VII Hero)
Damn, I'm just seeing this and bought an ASUS laptop a couple of months ago 😢 Ugh fck me
Man, I'm so grateful for this video. Thank you, Jay. I was looking into starting to save money in order to build my self a decent PC, wanting to get a bit expensive motherboard and CPU, guess what brand I wanted to go with.... Knowing that I could have killed my CPU, that I would have been saving money for... wth Asus
Which component is good for RTX4090 with i9 ? Which Board is best?
My PC is 15 years old. 1st gen i7 and a MSI motherboard. I changed a couple of things here and there but this PC lived for 15 years. Two of friends brought a PC a few years after mine with high-end Asus board and both had problems after a couple of months. ASUS couldn't help them with it since their replacement warranty were only for 48 hours after the purchase(I might be wrong with the duration but it was something ridiculous like that). ASUS washed their hands and since then I knew I wouldn't bought any of their products going forward.
To me it is insane that a manufacturer can put out an update that voids the warranty of their own products that if you dont use potentially puts you and your pc at risk and even still doesn't fix the issue.   Where are the lawsuits?
The last deception was asus rog 43inch not oled   monitor kkk
I have rog products an i agree 10000000000000 % whit you ❤❤❤
What motherboards should we use? MSI line?
I got a new pc when I watch your video the darker parts like your shirt and the drawers on the left looks grainy/noisy, Any help? Is this a gpu problem?
Im agree
Went with Gigabyte motherboard and gpu in my upcoming build partially due to this info. Was gonna go with ASUS from past positive experiences, but brand loyalty only goes so far. Quality comes first.
Thank you for watching out for all of us,I personally appreciate it as I was just starting to organize my layout and goals for my new build in 2024 and I just saw this video on this topic and now know what to look for.
I hate the RGB builds, are we building a PC or a Lamp 😅
ASUS taking the Microsoft Windows Updates approach 😂 have a PC with ASRock since 2013 and it's still running, problem free.
Is a rog crosshair hero vIII x570, am4 likely to be a problem as i just bought one, bit worried after watching this?
Thank you for letting people like me that isnt up to date with this stuff know whats happening before giving money to this mfers. Not many channels would talk bad (truth) about a giant brand like asus
That's why i did not bought asus
now this is interesting. So could my problem be because of the asus board
Asus has become bloated, the last time I did a BIOS update on my ROG motherboard it installed too much unnecessary garbage that I ended up uninstalling.
It happened to me too and I didn't get my money back with the Z390-f series 😭😭😭
Asus want consumers to go away. Guess what they will.
First time checking out this channel, was looking for reviews on asus rog strix z790-a wifi II because i just requested refund on z790-h which said on newegg and asus' comparability list that my i9 14900k 14th gen would work. It does not. Even did bios update and all troubleshooting recommended. Their tech support had to read from a book to troubleshoot when i already know and did all the basics and told them. I'm hoping the z790-a wifi II works, or I'll be firing Asus too. Thoughts or prayers on what I just ordered would be appreciated.
I have learned SO OOOOOOO. much from you i bought a pc from PC SPECIALIST (UK) with what i wanted. THEY built it for me. The parts i chose myself. I wanted the AMD RYZEN 9 7950X3d. I had no idea what MOB i need so they just give me the B650. Not the best but supported the processor. i got 32gig mem, and a RTX  3070Ti gpu.from Zotac, all amazing with LED display. I got Corsair AIO cooler, win11 pro and armour crate installed. I have never looked back. I did nothing it was all done. I just pressed go. I have a 32" 4k samsung Oddessy monitor and its amazing. I have NO 3rd party apps, done NO tweaks apart from HDR, and Norton security thats it. fans run awesome with armourcrate fan control, system running at 30% cpu, chipset at 28% mob at 30. I had nothing to do. total cost £1500. If your interested in my post i am more than happy to send pics of my build that just knock me out. The LED are more than something to behold. Check out the monitor, i just watched you unbox a 4K monitor, This 1 is awesome. Thanks for your inspiration, YOU give me the confidence to build my PC.
Personally overall I've had the worst luck with Asus. I have a 2060 that one of the fans failed and was still under warranty which they did cover for me, I did have to pay shipping to them which is normal for warranty work but they ended up just replacing the card and returning it to me. The one I received back is nowhere near the card that I sent to them, I'm not positive but I believe they sent me a refurbished unit for a card that was only a few months old. I also have an Tuf-Gaming x570 board and has an odd power issue where it won't reboot and you have to physically power it off and then back on, evidently others had the same issue with their x570 boards, I replaced the PSU but ended up buying a Gigabyte x570s to replace it with. I tried selling the board but was promptly returned because it wasn't the wifi version, since I'm stuck with it I may as well try it again but honestly haven't had the time to mess with it. I cannot see myself purchasing another Asus product, they are always more expensive when compared to other options.
Bye asus!!!
Thanks God i found you . I was about to buy the hero or the extreme.
My ASUS TUF B550M build in 2020 was a nightmare! The issue with the usb devices constantly disconnecting (resulting in games constantly crashing to desktop) unless you manually configure the PCIE settings to Gen3 in the BIOS took months to find the fix for. And then 6 months later after the community finally found a fix, ASUS finally came out and admitted fault and that they knew about the issue all along and just never told anyone.  I love the aestetic, specs, and price point of the TUF mobos, but i think my B650M build is going to use the MSI Mortar. I just cant support a company that lets customers spend all that money specing out a full pc worth of hardware, only to become unpaid beta testers required to invest serious time into getting the system to operate as a stable build. So frustrating!
wow. So the hype about first early access and beta testing in the gaming industrie have reach the hardware industrie... We see what it can happen with some shitty games, imagine with hardware.
Makes me feel better about replacing my recently failed ASUS X570 board with an ASRock. To be fair the ASUS board was 4 yrs old when it died and I had to pick the ASRock due to cost. My server has been running an ASRock MB for a couple of years and it's been solid though so I trust the brand enough.
I am here and going through some videos for decision making on a new system to build because my desktop crapped out on me after years of great times in 2022 and so late 2022 I decided since I am using my system in different locations more than I used to to go with a laptop instead for easier portability. I got an Asus TUF F15 laptop for $1500 and change, i7 with 32GB RAM, a 3070, and 2TB m.2 drive.  in late last year literally like a week past the 1 year manufacturers warranty, a fan started grinding/making noise but it wasn't affecting temps just a nuisance. I did what little troubleshooting I could, found a new fan online that had my laptop model number listed, for sale BY ASUS through Amazon. was not the right fan, and then in early January a few weeks later it stopped booting to windows and instead goes to the BIOS dash where it says no storage detected, swapped in an M.2 drive I know works and still no storage detected so likely the storage controller and its out of warranty and now I am going back to building my own, That laptop never took any drop, fall, spill, damage etc and just died on me. Was always transported in a laptop backpack in its own compartment, but I am not in a position to spend another $1500 again 16 months later so a friend is going to be giving me a 1060 6GB, a water cooler, and power supply he isn't using any more, we have storage and other things laying around, so I am going to need a CPU, Motherboard, and RAM. Probably the first time I am going to not go with an Asus board, and I am thinking while I am trying new things and on a tighter budget than previous builds, as much as I love intel and always envisioned myself with an intel build, I am going to give Ryzen a fair chance this time I think.
OK, I was thinking i'd upgrade from ASUS Strix Gene XI, to another ASUS, but I've changed my mind.
damn republican gamers
Intel is full of shit too. As well as Microsoft. I think these companies meet together and discuss how to fk consumers over based on the market fluctuations.
Yea I’m done with Asus. They are just for aesthetics. Build quality and customer service is the worst.
I don't know, I respect this video, but at the same time, to cry about free items you are getting... Saying it's the final straw... It's a bit pathetic.
Gigabyte are also becoming an issue. They're shipping unsealed boxes from the factory (the product inside is sealed with tape).  I ordered a 3050, 4060, and a b760m mobo and they all arrived from Amazon UK with the box unsealed.  My pc wouldn't boot with the 3050, the 4060 is working (thankfully) but the product was shipped from Amazons return dept (they dont even hide it, theres a label on the box stating it). The motherboard, once connected to power, turned itself on all by itself (indicating a power loss from the previous owner), so i know 100% that these products get passed around "as new" but they're not.  As for Asus, i tried them for my very first build with an intel socket mobo way back with a Q6600 setup. The motherboard was extremely unstable, i replaced it by rma, second mobo was even worse. Since that day ive never purchased another Asus product. And refuse to do so for the remainder of my hardware purchases.
I'm so mad at Asus, I always have used Gygabyte & msi. so in December 0f 2022 I bought the TUG x670e-plus wifi, I had bios 1813 with no problems, then in February 2024, I updated the bios to 2413 , 2 weeks after installing the bios running OK, now March 2024 the motherboard takes 10 MINUTES to SHOW the TUF bios screen, it sits on that screen for 5 minutes , then the Win 11 cicle starts turning round and round for 10 more minutes .  this board has never been overclocked , using the 7700 at 4.5gigaherts and the memory is CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 4800MHz CL40 Intel XMP iCUE Compatible Computer Memory - Black (CMK32GX5M2A4800C40) , the boot drive is the Crucial T700 1TB Gen5 NVMe M.2 SSD with Heatsink - Up to 11,700 MB/s - DirectStorage Enabled - CT1000T700SSD5 - Gaming, Photography, Video Editing & Design - Internal Solid State Drive  , the " old "  boot drives still in a second nvme slot is SAMSUNG (MZ-V7E500BW) 970 EVO SSD 500GB - M.2 NVMe Interface Internal Solid State Drive with V-NAND Technology, Black/Red .     I need the small slot to use the Asus Thunderbolt 4 card (it only works on a small slot , why who knows )   so now the only replacement with a small slot  is the MSI MAG X670E TOMAHAWK WIFI motherboard AMD X670 Socket AM5 ATX , SADLY GIGABYTE has no motherboard with a small slot , so hope MSI is still as good  as it used to be.  my 2 sons have Asus ROG motherboards  and they seem to be still working .  does anyone know if ASUS would RMA this board that went into service on 1-1-2023 ??  let me know if you have a phone number to get this board replaced.  thank you all
Can we go after Nvidia please next 🤣
Wow... I'm building my first PC in 20 years this year and all I've been eyeing up is Asus boards, because 20 years ago Asus was like the gold standard and the last PC I built I used an MSI board and had major issues. Glad I saw this.   Has MSI improved? Is Gigabyte any good (they were low end back in the day)? How's ASRock nowadays? Also see NZXT boards now...   Anyone have a recommendation?  Cheers
I use to love Asus. The last few boards I had major issues getting updates, and support. I moved on to other boards and have had a great time so far
Disappointing to watch this; my current PC (built in 2020) is mainly ROG; I was just getting in to planning a replacement and was going to buy Asus again. Not sure what I should go for now. Perhaps Gigabyte?
What's an asus alternative ? i mean the strix rog products are usually some of the highest quality.
7:15, ahaha. Yeah, here in Ukraine when their x670 motherboards were frying CPUs and were sent for RMA to asus authorized service, every single one of them got a response: pins were bent. So, yeah. Can't prove but a well-known fact!
Oh why didn't I see this sooner! I bought a "white motherboard" from Asus a month ago and haven't got it to work yet.
"Keep your STUFF" 😂 🤣😂🤣
I love my ASUS board, never had an issue - this is like one of those rando Yelp reviews
It’s smart on Steve’s part to speak the truth ab a company, even if they’ve been a sponsor in the past. 99% of tech info sources like YouTubers, websites, etc, are completely biased by sponsors. What makes creators like Steve and Linus stand out, is that they refuse to sell out and promote products that they don’t genuinely believe are worth buying. The trust built between creators like Steve and Linus and their audience, makes their value as ambassadors skyrocket.
I've had problems with my computer just powering off while the temperatures are in the mid-range. I first suspected the PSU, then the GPU, but after eliminating the other components one by one, I'm pretty sure it is the motherboard (z590) that is faulty. I have ordered a new non-ASUS board that is being delivered tomorrow. If that fixes the problem I will try to RMA. This would be the first motherboard that fails on me so quickly, it worked flawlessly for about a year.
Hell yeah. Instant subscribe. Thanks for saving me the pain.
software is also shit and sometimes false positive 😂
mother board Rog is shit cards too😂
I ban this brand too
Asus is shit products 😂 specially rog two GPUs died ,never over clocking no sights ,just died chip
had a asus b550 plus ac-hes  stopped working randomly  as of today a asus b550 plus wouldnt start  hit the power button then just turns off  i call faulty board, 2 boards by them costing me money cause they are trash
OMG you savedme from making a big mistake. Last time I built PCs Asrock was crap and ASUS was great, soI decided to go with ASUS. Seems I was wrong. Thanks for sharing this.
I had a Maximus IV Extreme-Z and using a Maximus XI Hero Wifi motherboard since 2018. So far so good.  I upgrade every 5+ years.
I hope EVGA releases AM5 motherboards such as x670 etc
I just built a new rig a few weeks ago with the Asus ROG STRIX Z790-H GAMING WIFI ATX and the RGB refuses to work no matter what I do. Everything else on the board appears to be working fine. I used an RTX 2080 Ti for about five years and the RGB only worked for one month. I never could get it to work again. Asus has a real issue with RGB. I'm pretty disappointed with Asus. I've been a fan of their hardware for many years since the GTX 660 Ti days. My last Asus motherboard had a dead PCI slot. It wouldn't detect my Creative Sound Blaster AE-9. I had to cram it in the slot between my GPU and CPU cooler. It barely fit in there. I now have it installed in the lowest PCI-E slot on this new mobo. I do love the new PCI-E release button on this new mobo. It's so much better than the old method that was a total pain to use. I also love my Asus TUF RTX 4090. It even came with a small anti-sag magnetic stick. I'm still a fan of their products. They do need to improve quality control a bit. There's no reason my RGB refuses to work even when enabled in the BIOS. My motherboard is completely dark. The only LEDs that work are system boot LEDs for RAM and CPU check etc.
Amazon sent me product that was returned broken 6 or 8 times.
I love the "keep your stuff" you dubbed over. I have to ask.. what did he dub over?
Hmmm wonder what he really says at 1:11 hehehe
love the mouse pad or desk matt, where can i get one?
I see Asus get bashed for there customer service and rightfully so but don’t kid yourselves all these companies care about one thing and one thing only and that’s there bottom line, I only used to buy EVGA and Asus products and they’ve always worked for me and I’ll continue to do so for better or worse minus EVGA for obvious reasons.
Man, this is really sad. I love ASUS products and always have. 😢
This is exactly the issue I am currently fighting ASUS over. I purchased a ROG Strix Z790E Gaming Wifi on January 2nd of this year. Upon installing it and lifting the ILM to place the processor, I found damaged pins. Thankfully it was within the Best Buy 15 day return period, so I returned it to the store for an exchange. I received the new one following my return from a vacation, I state this because of the 15 day return window. So I was able to finally get around to installing it at the end of January, unfortunately after that 15 day return window. Well low and behold, I lift the ILM with the plastic cover and find yet again, damaged pins. ASUS is refusing to consider it a warranty issue, stating that damage is not covered under warranty, even though I have stated multiple times that is was like that out  of the box. They are telling me to file a shipping claim with Best Buy, even though the damage to the pins has nothing to do with shipping damage. I will never purchase another ASUS product again. They have corrupt and shady business practices, and are going to be their own demise. So now I sit out of over $400 due to this companies lack of standing by their products.
Last week i sent my 4 months old Asus rx6800xt to service, because it was overheating. It's still in for testing, but the staff there told me i'd get a replacement, doesn't sound good.
Never again asus! 🥴🥴. Back to computing stuff since 2006 and this fkn motherboard has turned what should have been a dream into a nightmare.  All that I expected from thist sht was “TO WORK”.  🥴🥴💩💩💩
Is all these fix by now? I was just about to pay a new rig fully ASUS (AM5, rtx, etc), should I start all over again with MSI?
Just bought a Rog Z790-A, installed it and its bricked immediately, think my CPU may be toast too
I lost my trust in ASUS products about a decade ago. Since then I'm buying Gigabyte and MSI motherboards.
Damn, hopefully my Z790 TUF motherboard and 4070ti don't mysteriously die after 1 year from purchase (I kinda hope my 4070ti dies within a year of purchase so I can try to get a 4070ti super or 4080 super).
I bought the Asus rog 590e a year and a half ago so far has been ok do you have any advice on a Intel processor better than the i5 11600K 3.90 6 core with PNY rtx 3060Ti . I am an armature builder of 20yrs and still game at 62 yrs old so anyone who can offer advice on Gpu,s or Cpu,s I will listen. Thanks so much for your comments on the show they really help guys like me, and thanks for the Asus warning .
I just bought an Asus Rog Strix...Intel 13th gen. If I'm not blown up in a firestorm, I'll let you know how it goes. Testing so you don't have to..........but I did get a real good deal, so there's that. Probably should have watched this video before buying...hopefully you're expert rant has saved my ass.
No more Asus for me! 🖕🖕
i have no words for this. I bought an ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-I GAMING WIFI mini itx for 430€ and ran with it into warranty. I always handle my products with care but my expierence that i got now with ASUS so called Premium Support.. in short: 1 month without my mainboard. Sent me back today with new damaged backplate and a arrow sticker on it that says its my fault and my warranty is gone. BIG thank you ASUS for 430€ direct outta my window.. never again.. so fucking pissed and sad at the same time. WTF is this!?
I literally just RECIEVED my ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi II and I’m going back to search for a replacement board now because I do NOT want to go through any of these issues.  So if anyone knows a good INTEL (i9-14900) board that has NVME PCIe 5.0 and Wi-Fi 7 I’d love the suggestions  Or at least if I should indeed start my search by going to MSI
I bought an Asus board for my first pc I had a few people recommend Asus and it was DOA. I went to gigabyte and haven’t had an issue.
nobody point out that he said "keep your stuff" but stuff was obviously was voiceovered lol
I have a B550 and i have experienced loading a game and have no sound only in game
@RHSGaels 4 minutes ago Just got off the phone with ASUS support. I sent them a DOA Motherboard that had a bad socket, bent pins. Apparently bent pins void the warrenty, even when it comes from the factory. Sadly this wasn't even my first experiance with them, this was the second MB that came in DOA. They repaired the first one. The best, is when I informed them, that I was going to post on Social Media, they told me, if thats what you have to do, then do it. DON'T BUY ASUS!!!! They don't care about the customer, only their bottom line.
so what motherboard should i buy for my intel 11 gen? please someone!!!
hope my a620m plus doesn't fail like that
Ok, I'm ready to upgrade, which board should I be looking at?
I own several pieces of ASUS hardware and have luckily not had any performance issues.  I am, however, a bit miffed that they no longer allow you to unlock the bootloader on the ZenFone.
Agreed. I purchased a brand new 4070 Super and was thrilled to install and use it, only to discover that it wasn't compatible with my motherboard—only mine. This issue was widely discussed across forums. When I reached out to Nvidia directly for support, they seemed unaware of the problem and consequently couldn't offer any assistance. Needless to say, I ended up purchasing a new motherboard from a different manufacturer, as I won't be investing in any more ASUS products in the future. Even if their products are excellent at the time, it's unacceptable not to provide support for your own products or update them when issues like this persist for months. Adding insult to injury, the GPU itself is from ASUS.
Wow! This has 105,000 Likes, and there is a reason why I found this video! Another techtuber also has had enough of Asus. So, although I am using Intel, I think I will need to look at Gigabyte, or other. I have used them for over 20 years, almost exclusively. I went to Gigabyte one year, maybe 9 years ago, and I noticed the mobo rebooting 2x to get going, which I think was something normal in its process, but I didnt like it to I defaulted back. With 4mil subs, and 105K likes, this is going to spread like wildfire!  Sooo, is there a mobo around 350 and under that supports 192GB ram, Thunderbolt4 ?  I dont think its much to ask for, and I am a ZERO gamer, just Photoshop and Lightroom  (olds-school CS6 and LightRoom classic/But recently been using the newer cloud downloaded versions).
When I built my first computer, I bought an Asus motherboard. There was something wrong with the first one, can't recall exactly what, but it was sent back for a replacement. After getting the replacement and starting to put together my computer again, I discovered that part of the chassi I bought was broken, so had to take my build apart and send that for replacement aswell. Got a new chassi and put all the components together, boot computer, do setup, everything seems to work. Except. I have 95% CPU usage while idling. And my speakers don't work. Some investigation revealed the sound card on the new motherboard I got was broken and stuck in an infinite loop of disconnecting and reconnecting, which caused the CPU usage to go mad. But at that point, with having to tear my build down repeatedly and returns and replacements having delayed my new computer by over a month already, I decided to just disable the sound card and get an external usb soundcard instead. So I've never been all that sold on Asus motherboards.  I do quite like their ROG peripherals though (headset and mouse), but recently I've had issues with my mouse randomly disconnecting and reconnecting during use. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the mouse itself or the usb hub it's connected to, but no other device connected to the same hub is displaying the same behavior. Could be an issue of the hub not providing an even power supply, but with this video, I'm getting suspicious...
Back when i started building pcs in 2010, i had to replace 2 different ASUS motherboards for my pc, and a friend who i built a pc for had to replace 1 ASUS motherboard. After losing those 3 motherboards ALL WITHIN A YEAR i decided to never buy ASUS again. I switched to MSI and that was the best decision I've ever made. I used that MSI board i got back in 2011 until 2023 when this year i finally had a decent enough job to upgrade from 2nd gen Intel to the newest Ryzen series. Literally that MSI board lasted 12 years of gaming, my cpu was overclocked everyday that board was on, and i never had one issue with it. Honestly screw ASUS
ASUS is the worst computer i ever bought , also their "after sales service" is non existent
Do they have strange problems with the gpus? Hum
I have SO much problems with Armoury Crate, for years now. Upgraded all my hardware to the latest greatest of ROG and I have to remove and reinstall it every 2-3 weeks because my MOBO disappears from the software, soon followed by Ryujin.  They always ask for overclocking to blame it on that (even though every SHOULD be overclockable) but I haven't. System is not stable when I do. Send up logs and such multiple times, and they have NO clue what's going on.  First, I was graphic card enthusiasts, followed by mouse and keyboard, then my first mobo and with the latest built also the watercooler. All so I could synchronize the RGB with the same software. Big, big, BIG mistake.  Ps The first board I received was refurbished and missing stuff.
Der RMA Support in Deutschland funktioniert 🤷🏻‍♂️.  Mein x99 3.1USB Bord wurde im dritten Jahr kostenlos repariert. Ein stepp down Modul für 50Cent wurde erneuert.   Seitdem funktioniert das Bord weitere 5 Jahre ohne Probleme.   Verbaut ist ein 5820k und läuft auf 4Ghz, seit 8 Jahren 😎😜👌🤷🏻‍♂️.
So what motherboard do I get for my amd ryzen 9 7950x3d then. I haven't bought the chip yet and I'd really like some recommendations.
Sounds like ASUS has been running fast and loose for quite a while now. Probably a revolving door there with a few people holding it together. That can only last a short time but seems like more and more companies are allowing that to become their standard operating procedures because it’s easier than fixing the issues. It’s a shame to see a great company to be allowed to be managed into the ground
Trying to be cool by saying 'You're Fired', but you are coming across more like a scorned lover, lol.
Anti consumer/repair is such a damn problem across a wide range of products. Take shitty John Deere for an example. They will void your warranty on your tractor if you don’t take it to THEIR own repair center. They also have computers that only they can use to diagnose a problem I think too.   Wish we could go back to the quality of stuff of the old days were shit actually lasted a long time. Now it’s just greed, and money ruining everything.   Honestly surprised the PC market hasn’t exploded or crashed yet, I was expecting the vehicle (specifically the pickup truck market) to implode thanks to Covid, but this is just BS at this point. No excuse for quality to not return to pre Covid levels. Honestly scared for my future ngl, shit keeps getting worse and worse every day it seems like.
I’ll never buy another Asus product again lol,.. I have the x570 crosshair dark hero 8 and it’s a solid board but I’m looking to upgrade to am5,.. looking at the asrock taichi or the msi carbon for a mobo
Asoooooooooos
I've got a question, for anyone who knows... does these quality and danger issues also apply to the laptops, specifically ASUS Rog Strix 17 and 18?  Thanks!
Dude just bimboized Asus... it's good for these companies to know that they can't just get away with anything just 'cos they're paying.
Asus screwed a bunch of people on the Z690 Formula  board that had a VRM waterblock.  The block contained mixed metal aluminum and copper and nothing in the documentation told you that.  I called 3 times and noticed smashed pins also.  And the aRGB header stopped working.  I have sent it back and they have had it for almost a month.  I bought an ASRock Aqua board to replace it.
I was thankful for this video. Asus motherboards are overflowing (in amazon), and when it was time to buy a new motherboard i avoided this since i was  upgrading to the Ryzen 7 7800XD. Motherboard are expensive (chipset even more so) and i didn't want my computer burning and them not taking Responsibility for it.
I bought a rog b760-a a few months back for my new computer. Worked good for around 3 months. Then computer wouldn’t turn on. No reason as I used it fine the night before. Turns out the CMOs battery was 100% dead and wouldn’t let the pc boot at all. Once I changed that pc worked again. And I’ve heard that it’s supposedly super rare for that to occur.  I’ve had to reinstall drivers and such cause it picked up a habit of restarting while playing games and being an over all pain to work with now.
DO NOT INVEST IN ASUS PRODUCTS, when they are good they are AMAZING however god forbid you receive a faulty product. refusing repair due to damage either the courier of their choosing or their own staff caused. they also sent me a $260 repair bill for a product thats msrp is only $199, however every store I've looked at is selling it for 150-199. the math isn't mathing and all I'm trying to do is get my BRAND NEW ROG product that didn't work properly AT ALL either repaired or replaced. the damage in question does NOT correspond with to original issue, they are claiming the bios flash back button on my motherboard is missing however is used it while attempting to troubleshoot/diag their product, the issue i was having was both pcie lanes were messed up....... If i were yall id stay away.... i know im going to from now on this is an ongoing case in 2024 they have the WORST customer support ive ever dealt with
So glad I watched this video. I spend about 2500€ on ASUS ROG parts for my daughter's PC last year. Recently it wouldn't start up, so I started taking it apart to see which part is not working. I found the CPU had a bulge like in your video. I had not taken it apart since I first assembled it, and had tried an auto overclock right after assembling it. That hat resulted in lockups, so I reset it to non overclocking in BIOS. I though the damage was probably from that attempt, so I ordered a new CPU. The new CPU ran for a total of two days before having the same problem. I'll try getting a replacement CPU, and I'll just junk the mainboard.
Spemt $5k on a laptop that has pissed me off way more than a $500 one ever has. Fuck ASUS. They produce crappy unstable products these days.
The B550 I is faulty, does not work with NVIDIA 40 series cards. I've spent over 20 hours with their customer support team, speaking to supervisors, and they "drop the call" and take no notes. 40 minute hold time each time, and each time you have to explain the case for half an hour. Eventually they sent the replacement, and it was another broken B550 I. Done with Asus forever.
I personally have fired AnUS 8 years ago
Recently built a new AM5 build with an Asus Strix X670E-E & it's worked flawlessly since, got a ton of USB devices connected to it as well.
Is Expo better than XMP? Also, if you were to buy a 4090 which brand would you go with? I'm Considering the Asus ROG STRIX GAMING OC but after this video now i'm questioning that.
Wish I found this video a week ago. Just installed a x670e-a in my new pc
Which board manufacturer still has good customer support? I just ditched Gigabyte and went to ASUS, due to this video, I hope to not regret it. So is there a board manufacturer that still can be trusted and has good support and customer relations?
i have a asus prime x670p .do i need to worry
My asrock board still living after 6 years. Thought they were a cheapo brand but msi and asrock are where its at apparently for mobos.
Watching this as the tuf super is supposed to be here tuesday 🪦
I wrote for several different sites over of 6 years. 2015-2021. At the time Asus was making amazing products. But they were a NIGHTMARE to deal with.
I watched both this video and Gamers Nexus' video at the time this problem was revealed and even today I'm still amazed that ASUS would obliterate the image of their brand like that.
When businesses do this shady crap they deserve everything they get.
The shame of it is, none of the others are better really. MSI's customer service is filled with liars and anti-consumer behavior (they fried my laptop keyboard, when my laptop was sent back for a faulty screen surround, claiming I had done "liquid damage" that did not exist before it was sent there and forcing me to pay $400 for a replacement when the original repair was covered by warranty), with arguably having some of the better products out. Gigabyte has never been good, Asrock doesn't have the feature set to meet the demands of the consumer, especially the high end parts. EVGA, the shining beacon that they are generally speaking, has only one major design language, and it doesn't flow with most builds. Every single one of them needs to get kicked in the ass for a variety of reasons.  Also, the lack of white hardware is honestly a crime, especially for AMD. I hope the rest of the brands see this as a warning and step it up, because I would love a Formula level & design board from someone else.
ACER have that for me. their products were garbage 4  years ago.  I had two Acer Nitro 5s returned in the period of 3 months due to them breaking.
I'm surprised I'm just hearing about this now, seeing how this defiantly has screwed me over!  Because Jan 2023 I decided to do a full upgrade to Ryzen 7000 and get a Rtx 4080, so I went ahead and ordered up an X670E from ASUS, and 6000mhz DDR5...  Back then the big thing going around the early adopters was Ram instability.  It was DDR5 RAM this, Ram that, every problem was Ram, and Samsung vs SkHynix chips and so on.  As well as the bios for the new 7000 series was still being updated multiple times per month.  SO!  I pretty much chalked my problems up to being the Ram was sub-par and Ryzen 7000 was still wonky causing issues.. and Issues I did have a plenty!  upon first start up of the system I would blue screen every 5 seconds or so, it was hell to just get the drivers installed so the computer would run more than 10 mins without a crash.  And I had severe audio issues, audio going in and out, and loud crackling noises as well as volume level at 10% was basically full blast, had random studdering issues on screen and in device manager missing devices so that it was absolute hell to figure out the drivers for the system because the computer was reporting back that devices were non-existent to the motherboard, when they were in fact hooked up or in the case of the wifi actually built in to the board.  I was able to get the systemm so it would run for about an hour at a time without crashing by running in limp mode basically, AMD eco mode and Ram turned down to 4800Mhz, it wasn't until a much later bios updated I flashed in around Fall time of 2023 that it finally became a useable computer, it is now stable.. HOWEVER the cavoite is, its running in AMD ECO Mode, and ram is stuck at 4800MHZ as well as the CPU voltage is always going over 1.5v even at idle.   But this is the best I can get it, any tweaking of the bios at all sets the computer back into a fit where the mouse starts glitching across the screen and games crash constantly.  Its unfortunate because I paid for more than what I'm getting, The Bio's version that I found works the most stable is V.1415  for X670E    I just built someone a computer yesterday also a Ryzen 7000 build on a X670E Aorus board from GigaByte!  paired with 6000Mhz ram and a AsRock 7900xtx, guess what?  Zero issues at all.. everything worked so flawlessly right out of the gate and is already overclocked and running 4k happily within temps.  The sad part is, this build cost a lot less than mine.  Moral of the story, I guess I'll try to save up money again to replace this board I'll try and swap for a GigaByte or MSI board seeing how well they've worked for me in other builds.  (last time I buy asus)
Asus was the only mobo ive known for like 15 years lol
I too am an ASRock Taichi man myself.  ASRock has not been the prettiest motherboard but it has always been the board for new hardware and Rock Solid performance and price.  Back in the day I thought that ASRock was the Test bed for ASUS because ASRock always had the newest developmental boards.  Now I just trust ASRock and Gigabyte for my Motherboards.  Sorry to hear about the ASUS boards but I saw this coming when that white board with the 2011v3 socket kept eating CPU's and boards kept bricking.  So many RMA's sales for that board that I started avoiding ASUS that year.  It seems that they have not improved since then.  Too bad because they where so great in the old days.   RIP ASUS.
Here I sit with an ASUS ProArt X670E, 7950X, 64GB of ECC UDIMMs no less, and on BIOS 1807 and not had a single problem once my initial board was replaced because the first was bad. Luckily, I had to deal with Microcenter for that who are great, they took another out of stock and used that, and dealt with ASUS on their end. Am I sitting on a time bomb?
Not surprised it is about AMD motherboard. Generally speaking AMD's AGESA is bloated crap and AMD based motherboards from same series, let's say ROG boards are better on Intel. Anyone remember small fan crap on X470 chipset? Or crap when MBO manufacturers put small BIOS chips, e.g. MSI re-released new boards with MAX name, because AGESA is bloated crap.
I've RMA'd two ROG STRIX 3000-series GPUs, due to wobbly fans / degraded ball bearings causing really loud rattling sound after only two years. I know it's anecdotal and could be down to sheer bad luck, but I'm staying away from ASUS from now on. I rate MSI higher now, which is funny because it used to be the opposite back in the day.
i watched this on an Asus laptop.
My god, who do we even buy from anymore? Lol Newegg is lowsy, asus is lowsy, gigabyte is lowsy, and EVGA is a no go 😂
Had 2 ROG boards fail within 2 years the one before those lasted 5 years. Switched to TUF gaming... not much better. Will try MSI next
I’ve been running a TUF build. I’ve been impressed by the AI overcclock feature. I have found it difficult to make time to learn to do it myself. I’ve had zero issues I’ve not caused myself. However. I respect the community enough to say that minus some major response to the issues, I’ll go somewhere else next build….
I’m done with asus too. Always had a bunch of problems with their motherboards.
We are living in a very strange era with our favorite brands  The Intel disappointment high consumption very poor performance .  Now Asus creating problems with M.Ram DDR5 on AM5 I am waiting to change motherboard and processor An exhausting wait full of doubts about the choice of motherboard . I have always used Asus motherboards for its aesthetics for the quality of its products . I have also used some motherboard from Gigabyte very beautiful aesthetically ok materials but some apps are really horrible pure garbage . Msi I really like its oc bios approach but much less the quality of materials . In conclusion I really don't know which motherboard to choose platform AM5 to match it with an r7 7800x3d abandoning intel altogether On video cards I live in Italy it is not possible to pay a 4090 at 2300 2500€ translated into dollars is about 2499.98/2717.37. I also don't like NVIDIA's policy of leaving behind from the expensive DLSS a barely previous generation as they did with the 3xxx to 4xxx series who's to say that as soon as the 5xxx series comes out they won't play the same game? . I don't even like the new connector as I don't like that it didn't even deign to update the D.Port . In a nutshell I bought a 7900xtx + Nitro I am doing great and feel super happy with my choice .  Paying it 1,086€ about $1180.43  In conclusion I am still looking for my AM5 motherboard that will not give me problems with DDR5 .
The issue is AMD not ASUS...think about it
Bought a refurbished x670E it failed within 3 months had someone look at it and it was a power issue sent it in for rma and they told me the issue was bent pins. At a loss of words and considering taking them to court as I know for certain that was not the issue
Just bought an Asus board for my first build... I'm sending it back tomorrow... Can you make a suggestion for a replacement for Asus Rog strix B550-f gaming wifi II?
they're hoping people install the beta bios in a frenzy to try and fix the issue so that when they try to RMA the board they dont have to replace it because they "voided the warranty" thats some shady MSI tier behavior
Yep. Ya zen pro book  sucks  got my  money back  never again
Thanks Jay! Lets see what Asus's sales numberss look like for 2024 - good followup vid
Absolutely loved this video when it published. Now I'm back here to mention an incident that recently happened with me. My ASUS PSU fried my Zotac Nvidia 3090 GPU. Never made any tweaks to my setup either. After multiple emails and an excruciatingly long phone call, they have refused to help me with my GPU even after they inspected the PSU and concluded that it was a faulty unit. This felt like a good place to mention this.
That helps me make a few decisions! Thanks for all you do!
Asus can't tell me where is SSD drive it's located on motherboard of the Q530  laptop? i have a chat with them they don't know i have been an Asus for more than 15 years i'm disappointed by this company i don't know what is going on you can't upgrade a laptop anymore mean if the drive died that it buy another laptop what a system we have now. i have a 500gb i want to upgrade to 1 tb i can't ? ASUS said? i won't buy ASUS brand anymore.
I don't trust AMD stuff since my laptop started acting weird and there was no possible cause other than the AMD chipset. So my PC builds never include anything AMD and everything's been fantastic.
Don’t even get me started on if you purchase an asus product from Best Buy and don’t take the geek squad warranty. There is basically no manufacturers warranty for routers and mobos purchased at Best Buy if you didn’t get the extended warranty.
Watching this while having a ROG stix motherboard searching for a solution to a D7 code VGA light issue. HELP!
Same with ps5 update
If you hate asus so much why make this video clearly you don't pay for the hardware it's usually given to high rated YouTube users with over 100k in subscriber and physically you have to apply for products review i can't just write a letter to Asus or gigabyte or msi and ask if I can be a product tester and review about my rating for how good it is on triple a rated game
Hey YouTube maybe you need to review this guys video all negative comments
Yeah i bet anything those 105k likes are the idiots who bought a Asus product and returned it for some bogus reasons false marketing or my laptop overheated and my cpu fried and Asus refusal to honor the warranty and the store said I damaged it yadda yadda whatever
Well fokes I'm gonna to be my usual negative Sally self always talk crap about good companies that make long lasting products "note to self remember to get rid of my personal 10 year old asus rog laptop and desktop all bs for rating.
I bought an ASUS ips panel few months ago on Amazon. I was completely stunned at how bad the IPS glow was and the overall quality of the picture.
o, then bb asus - gigabyte is realy cool today and better. I am sad, thad evga dont bring some board but ... ok
I think i am lucky and happy with pc s in general. I had one component fail on me . A gtx 680 , that i used for 8 years straight. Almost daily. Never made any problems, never was loud. It went out as it lived , quiet. May you rest in peace my friend.
Abit was top so many years ago they developed the soft bios, I stuck with them then they became so big the did not care. Now today they are what nothing like they once were. I went to Asus motherboards and graphics cards . I dropped all video cards from Asus due to multiple failed cards over a short amount of years. Hope it's not over with motherboards.
good video and this is why i love you guys
Jay, 20 years ago it use to be 1 in 10 mainboards were faulty. I always called ASUS .. A SUS , as I've always been SUS when buying their products now.
Thank you so much for this! Its so needed!
I have a question, i bought a STRIX X670 E-F gaming wifi and the 7800X3D... should i worry that my PC will die? or should i rest because of the latest updates?
sign of the times, prices keep goin up, quality on things keep goin down. fairly certain there's an audio problem with my current board too from asus
Well.. same for Alienware, MSI, HP.. etc. They all had issues and they came back. (Sortoff) I had never any issues with my Asus stuff and luckily we get 3 years of warranty in the Netherlands 😅
Im 7 months late to this vid but im glad I saw it.
Well... I'm glad I didn't go Asus for my AM5 mobo. That said, I think AMD is part of the issue. MSI has tons of bios issues too.
Great Vid.  Stick it to the man.  ASUS U suck
16:07 When I built my first ever PC over a decade ago I had to call ASUS to troubleshoot my system crashes. I thought it was the graphics card, which was an ASUS 6770. I was just a kid at the time. Didn't really know what lead to chase. The motherboard was PCIe 2.0 x16 and the card was PCIe 3.0 x16. As a part of my troubleshooting  I researched if that discrepancy could be a problem - it wasn't (or shouldn't have been) but really ran out of ideas. I called up ASUS support and I'm almost certain I got through to a well known technical rep (who at the time also made visits to other Youtubers when discussing ASUS technical aspects for their videos) who, proceeded to tell me that the graphics card being 3.0 and the motherboard being 2.0 was "a problem" and that they needed to be the same, otherwise it was my fault (indirectly) so, even though I was pretty sure that was BS at the time I just kind of went along with it to get my RMA. Why would someone who is a technical SME need to say that the PCIe standard was the problem when he, the technical "expert" himself, knows full well that it's highlighly unlikely a hard crash is a result of a PCIe spec discrepancy? Even back then being inexperienced I could sense the transfer of liability. Doubly worse looking back is his, and thus ASUS's, leveraging of "expertise" to decieve a customer genuinely looking for help. The condescension is still around I see. BTW, the cause of my crashes had nothing to do with the card. My Biostar board had a bad DIMM slot. No stick in slot, no crashes. Sticks in any other config? worked fine. Live and learn. Speak with your wallet. We purchase products not only for latent capability but also for the capacity for those manufacturers to support us should we need help. I've owned many ASUS products, from the Zephyrus gen 1 and 2 to motherboards - when something (like a bezel panel arriving warped) needs to be fixed, they're outright incapable of repair. Need to reset your laptop and get a driver that was on the original OS? They wont provide it if you initiate a wipe. Now with their boards being so overpriced, it's just not worth it. I'm not getting anything I cant get from another brand, and it's not like it can get worse.
My asus z690’s sound chip is terrible, it’s literally blasted super loud static noise twice which probably permanently damaged my hearing thanks asus.
ASUS is a pile of shit, I had an ASUS TUF F15 nothing but problems, fan would ramp up for no reason on battery, Armoury Crate would just spaz out most of time till I rebooted. I work in IT so I done all the troubleshooting I could do. It was a shitty laptop, I have now an MSI stealth 15 pro RTX 4060, its been brilliant.
ASUS seems to be going AlienWare. Caring more about aesthetics than function. Add their customer service issues and they're killing themselves.
If asus is struggling and asrock is doing better how are gigabyte’s on that aspect on am5?
Wow I'm sitting here with my g15cx just took a dump on me and this video popped up. Guess it was the sing I was looking for and yes I will change my profile pic thinking about going with msi on my new build any good recommendations on a good build keeping it around 2 grand
The swear-word cover-ups in this got a laugh out of me. Reminded me of watching movies on tv that the tv channel had to censor. EG: Blues Brothers where instead of "bull****" they had some dude say "bamboozle". Just the obvious word-swap is hilarious. Also, I was big on Asus for a long time as quality, but I'm glad I watched this. Def second thoughts about it. I've noticed brands I used to like, eg: Logitech, have just gone to crap these days.
They cant do this by law, its not fit for purposes there should be a recall on this.
Wow. You'd think they would make everything good for the influencers which shows another level of don't give a damn. One story, of many stories, for me was getting so run around by LG that after three attempts and numerous phone calls; my time wasted far exceeded the value of my television and I just lived with it while buying Sony entertainment products.
It's actually ironic how I got a blue screen as u were talking about it @10:00.
yeah.. not gonna buy anymore stuff overpriced for a few more plastic and led
Good info, i am looking to build new system and saw this video, everything i have is in my cart ready for check out but now i am stuck which way to proceed with parts and brands. ASUS has never left me stranded. Any suggestions?
i am now a Victim of Asus too . i sended in an Z690 Formula with the corrosion on the VRM Block , and they found a slightly bended edge on the PCB and decided to refuse an RMA. another disapointed EX buyer
I had purchased 2 asus gpu's 2 years ago, one being a asus 2080 blower style gpu and the other being a rog strix 2060 super blower style which both didn't even last a DAY, the 2080 worked fine for a couple hours until it randomly froze then restarted with it artifacting and showing code 43, the 2060 super on the other hand COULDN'T EVEN GET INTO THE GAME before it also restarted the system and interestingly never displayed again; after that I was so frickin done with asus I just returned the cards and never bought another asus product again. Literally every other gpu I have owned NEVER gave me ANY issues other than asus.
What motherboard brand you guys can recommend?
Now when I think about it, the 690 formula never got recalled, but they did eventually end up destroy the entire loop. Radiator(s), GPU block, pump(s) etc. Did ASUS even put an effort into getting this out there? No.
Had 3 boards 10 years ago that all failed in the same way within 1-2 yrs and swore off of them
I have an ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-F WIFI GAMING mobo and since three months ago and have no issues! I am happy with it and many more of my friends use Asus mobo's, and they never had any issues with them, interesting.
Goodbye, ASUS! 🖕👎
Massive respect to Jayz. Not simping for the corporates!
7 months later, what are your opinions on ASUS now? I am planning on using a ASUS ROG motherboard for my pc build and I want a trusted opinion on this
I bought a rog strix 5700xt years ago. The washers were bad, cooler sagged off the card. My card melted, haven't bought from them since.
Seeing this video has helped me hammer the final nail in the coffin for ASUS, It looks like I'll be switching back to MSI for the first time in a decade, seeming how their quality has (allegedly) started to go back up. I've never had any huge problems with my WS-Z390 PRO until recently its just been fucking up for no reason at all, I think its time to make a switch soon. It's a shame to see a company that was so well known for making good quality hardware throw everything down the drain.
lol gets an asus ad midrole
Is this fixed now? Just bought an x670e hero and 7950x3d
I never liked ASUS, although I've also fell into their marketing trap and I currently own a router and a monitor. Well, the router does the job, because it's not the latest model (I got the latest model Asus ROG Rapture GT-AXE16000) but I returned it after 1 day of usage, or should I say no-usage, because it didn't work and it got worse with the new firmware update, which had to fix things, but it made them worse (dropping wifi every 5 minutes to dropping wifi every 1 minute - well done ASUS!). The monitor is full of features and .... they are only available through DP 1.4 and the cable it came with is 1.2 (Well done ASUS AGAIN!). HDMI? Yes, it works, but you can't use the "cool" features of your monitor, so go suck a cucumber you poor customer. I had a laptop, man, I had to return it quicker than my wife returned me to my mother, when I came home drunk, one night :D (kidding :D ) So I never liked the brand and their products and even despite my gut feeling, I always ended up with one of their products and was reassured of my initial inner feeling of disappointment. So yeah, good job man, finally someone admits it in the big youtube community as well and thank you for making me believe that I wasn't crazy this whole time!
Amazing video. I've been thinking the same way for a looong time - for more than 10 years. As far as i remember asus stuff has always been this way. I don't know why this is brought up now. Hardware have been kind of good - not the best at all. Software and support has been terrible. My Asus laptops failed. My Maximus vi formula - kind of working. XMP resetting, problems with the BIOS, lost my RAID few times, the battery runs out in two years and you have to disassemble the whole system in order to change it and other stuff like this. They are not producing their hardware, just using others to assemble something that is kind of working. My PG279Q monitor although it's a great piece of tech there were a lot of stuck pixels. Their main purpose is RGB and oled displays just to make stuff look cool and nothing more for not reasonable amount of money over the competition. The best brands I've been using are MSI and EVGA. I'll be updating my system soon and there will not a single Asus branded part in it
I built with MSI and intel. No issues since built.
Arrogance? Let's talk MICROSOFT.
I'm confused. I was gonna choose the ASUS ROG STRIX B650E-E for my Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Should I choose a different mobo or what?
I've got that taichi and a 7800x3d, the only issue I've had so far is not able to get ram to expo settings,  the ram is running the expo timings but 200hz below.  It's ddr5 6400, but running at 6200.  I don't know much about messing with the voltages so it's running stable at 6200.
Thank you for this video! Every PC store in my area (Bay Area) pushes Asus like they're the end all be all. They have a few Gigabyte Mobo's on deck and was thinking about staying with Gigabyte since my 10 year old system is still rockin'. Just curious what everyone's thoughts are on current* Gigabyte quality. They seems to be one of the few companies with decent pricing. The Aorus z790 Master is only $370, and for all the features it seems like it has solid cost/performance.  Thanks!
Happy to know that this is NOT "only me" issue. About 7 years ago I've got my first ASUS laptop for day-to-day normal usage, and I swear I've ever barely had any issue with that. About five years later I've decided to upgrade to another Asus laptor (TUF Gaming, to be more specific) - an I can guarrantee you that the issues with that one (which by the way had very good reviews online at the time) started almost from the beginning... About 2 years after it's purchase I can resume my experience in: constantly Blue screen about up to 5 times a day, wired mycrophone "does not exists"/works anymore, same with the wired headphones (only bluetooth earphones are still working fine, but ain't really sure for how long), half of the keyboard has no longer the "fancy gaming light", the power of the fans is no longer adjustable ah, and afcourse the battery - well, basically it dies about 10min after the plug off the wired charging. So yes, this is TRUE NIGHTMARE, which was not cheap at the time for me. I will never EVER buy anything from them and moreover would't suggest that to anyone. So yes, thank you for being honest Jayz!
HOW IS IT PRONOUNCED THO??
Asus were always bad before, as i got a way older faulty board with blinking green light issue. The msi and the asrock one, still works today!
I own ASUS PRO B9440UA-GV0191R ... 1000+ bucks laptop -- PRO laptop ... the biggest PRO disaster :D ... inflatable li-pol battery opened the case like a pistachio nut :D and this battery is bad quality in general, there is noisy fan, various power-on problems especially after prolonged non-use, performance is questionable, only one usable USB-C port occupied by power supply and the second usb-C port had problems with my external HDD, there are so many problems with this "PRO" laptop that they probably didn't mean it seriously, and software support is lost - they do not solve any problem on their PRO product ... will I ever buy another ASUS product? NO .... I repaired several ASUS laptops where I saw how they save on parts quality -  even the battery charging unit is done so that the mosfet fails after the warranty .... if I want PRO quality, I will look in other brands ... bye bye asus, it is no longer the quality 10 years ago.
What about asus laptop
I've had my own problems with ASUS and I will never buy their garbage again.
They were so high up but couldn't see Mt. Tai.
The audacity to call yourself the “Republic of Gamers” and do the most non-gamer shit ever is impeccable.
Oh No ! I just finished a build with an ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Hero - WiFi 6E, ARGB Header (3), USB 3.2 Ports (2 Type-C, 8 Type-A), M.2 Slot (3), am I doomed?
How disappointing! After our local custom builder shut down during COVID, I standardized on the Asus D700 line of business PC's.  I've purchased over 3 dozen for my company.  They have been our go-to brand for monitors for many years, as well as other peripherals like DVD-RW drives.  Everything has always been great.  Recently one of the newer D700's had an SSD fail.  I called to take advantage of the 3-year on-site warranty.  At first, despite the on-site warranty, they tried multiple times to get me to send in the machine for repair.  Why would I do that?  Then, it took them 2 months to do anything.  Finally they sent a new SSD to me and scheduled a tech out to install it - only install it.  Turns out the replacement SSD was not imaged, so I ended up installing Windows and everything myself.  Not much of a warranty or competent repair.  What a shame.  They are great machines.  SSD failures happen and are not the system manufacturer's fault.  They are also easy to fix.  Unfortunately Asus failed miserably. Luckily I was able to back up the system when we started getting errors, so I got the C drive back easily.  The recovery partitions, etc. are a different story.  Get it together ASUS!
What was the other brand he fired as a sponsor?
And so … Rasta man a stand up and repel satan 😤
Thanks for the heads-up ..  I wanted to buy a  Asus ROG STRIX X670E-E GAMING WIFI.. but now I’m not so sure .. what kind of motherboard and cpu would you recommend for a high-end  (first) computer build ?  Pc case : Lian-li o11 dynamic evo xl  Ps. Sorry if my English isn’t that good !  I’m a dutch (the Netherlands) fan !
Does Asus smash pins on RMAs? Yeah, they certainly did on mine.
Jay, how do you feel about EVGA motherboards.
@JayzTwoCents I sent ASUS an email asking them if they would send a crosshair VIII Hero to my little brother for Christmas. He has Osteosarcoma and this could be his last Christmas. He wanted me to make him a gaming rig. I have some parts but not everything. They emailed me back and said, “we do not have a program for what you are requesting and cannot help you at this time.” Assholes. Put these clowns on blast Jay. They can’t bother to reach in their billion dollar pockets to help a dying kid at Christmas.
I had a Asus Rog gaming laptop and the motherboard of the laptop totally died after one year and more of that I even hadn't played a single game on it! I worked on hard work to collect money and buy it for 1700$ but it became a pice of garbage and when I had contacted with manufacturer he sent me to hell. I will never buy Asus anymore in my life!!!
is the MSI MPG B650 EDGE WIFI a good and safe choice?
Asus made the first laptop i used in college and it was dead within 2 years.  It was strictly used as a student workstation and that was still too much.  That was 13 years ago.  Haven’t bought an asus product since, and i was confused by their popularity at the time.
Im so glad I didn't go with ASUS  now in my new build. I built it less than a week ago, I went with the X670E Asrock Steel Legend and a 7950X3D and 6000MHZ RAM and its been absolutely rock solid since first start up.
I'm still running an AsRock Z97X entering its 8th year of service, 1150 with a 4790K, best PC I've ever owned.
😳I used to thought that the tuff Asus motherboard used to be the most secure and stable, but if it's not 😠 and they're just arrogants that only care about the money and not about the customer, can you please Tell Us which Brand and model would be the best for AMD? PLEASE 🙏🙏
Jay you saved my ass I just bought an asus board on Amazon but after seeing this I quickly cancelled my order before it shipped. Thank you!
good 4 u J and thnx for taking a hit for the team (sort of)! ASSUS products are waaaaaay overpriced anyway these days...
I mean thousands of dollars of parts which yes u advertising but no one here really Goes and buys these high end stuff only rich do so it’s not like it’s that good of advertising
Hmm funny u just posted more Asus
My ASUS will not install a BIOS update from any version. Thought my CPU was bad, and I replaced it twice. GPU kept overheating and replaced it. Still can't play a full game of CoD without my CPU overheating, leading to a full shutdown. Gave my cousin all my old parts. They work flawlessly on his MSI board. I can't afford it at the moment, but I will be switching to MSI.
So glad my new build has nothing Asus
I can see you have a Z690-PLUS WIFI in a stack to your right. Can you please shed some light on whether that model is known to come with some issues? I'm building my first PC and that particular board (DDR5 ver.) is among my top choices. There are also several ASRock models that I took into consideration so I would greatly appreciate if you could explain which ones are to be "avoided at all costs"? If you can't be that specific can you at least tell us during which time period ASRock was pumping out shoddy products?  Thanks and stay awesome Jay! It was your channel that encouraged me build my own PC instead of buying one of those questionable prebuilts.
Thank you, I was going for an asus motherboard for my 7800x3d😱😱😱😱 I've bought a gigabyte instead.
I was just about to grab an Asus Strix B650e for my new build. Think I'll do my research and look at MSI like my last build 😅😅
thank you, I just recommended a friend a Asus Motherboard, exactly this because I known Asus for years and thaught its good. Turns out Asus changed. He got a other now👍 I will not give money to ppl who handle problems like that💁🏻
Well, glad my b550 pro still working properly. However, I work in the Quality field. As a consumer, looking to upgrade from my 1st, pc build 2 yrs ago. Clearly, there are changes in the asus manufacturing plants that have impacted the Quality of tech produced. Good thing I watched this video.
I was just about to build a PC using an ASUS board and thank you for the heads up. They’re not getting my money
You overclocking it and now you saying it's Asus fault..I'm outta here
Excellent video. Ive been anti asus since 2016. When my brand new monitor had a line through it, and they refused to RMA it. They even went as far as to accuse me of damaging it.
MSI BABEE
i've had the same issues with the Rog sticks B550-F gaming motherboards. turning up with broken and bent pins, capacitors blowing up, and parts NOT being fixed correctly. it's like they don't even have a checking area anymore, i'm about to have to change out my motherboard now i've not even had it a year because it's having power fails and 2 B memory slots don't even work!
You guys are behind the curve by 7-8 years.  I have stopped purchasing ASUS products since I experience issues with a screen I bought and the bezel kept was coming away from the frame.  Long story short there customer support sucked. when they sent me a replacement (refurbished mind you) the same thing happened again.  Their quality has dropped to the gutter.
Wish I knew this before I ordered the strix b550
Im so thankfull i found this channel. Planing on building my first budget gaming pc in 20 years.. there is alot i have missed it seems 😆 almost went full asus yesterday. But still putting together my shoping list to play star citizen.
Im so thankfull i found this channel. Planing on building my first budget gaming pc in 20 years.. there is alot i have missed it seems 😆 almost went asus yesterday.

When looking for a new motherboard, I saw more bad reviews about ASUS motherboards than any other brand. Terrible reviews. It was wild because I thought ASUS was like top tier until now
One very simple question: why download and install beta bios updates and not download the stable bios update through "My Asus" software ????
In the past 4 Years I had 2 ASUS motherboars, both died after 2 yeas as the warranty covers only 1 year, it`s seems that its intentional. Now I will never tough a ASUS product again
I dumped ASUS as a brand in 2017…worst experience with a manufacturer from ANY industry that I have personally experienced ever.  Washed my hands of them, and have never looked back.
Ive been saying this EVERYWHERE for 3 YEARS and got downvoted removed and censored all over the place. Glad you have 104k likes lmfao.
yep. Tired of them. after listening to this I will not be buying my new Asus graphic card from Amazon today. Anyone got any other suggestions which goes well with Microsoft Flight that won't break the bank and still give me ultra settings?
My big expensive treat yourself build features an ASUS B550 board... Now I'm worried cause I just updated the BIOs (NOT TO THE BETA VERSION) and just bought a new CPU.  How worried should I be? Gonna stick to AsRock/MSI from here on out
The amount of ASUS motherboards I've seen in repair videos was enough to deter me tbh :p Like Northridge Fix, I feel like every video of his just starts with "Here, we have an ASUS motherboard" or "Here, we have an ASUS laptop"
chose msi over asus for my latest build. good looking!
Just ordered my asus b650e-e lol
Nearly 4 million subscribers to this channel. If Asus doesn't care about 4 million people, well that speaks directly to the topic of this video.
So glad I went with the TaiChi.
Thanks - scratching my Asus purchase
watches this after purchasing rog strix z790 a gaming wifi ii 😐😐
Had a buddy of mine with a Intel 13 gen on a Asus board, just as much and as confusing issues like you had aswell.
This is going to sound crazy but, i just had a 6900xt LC OC hybrid cooled gpu fail after a year and a half. not sure what happened but was experiencing crazy artifacts and directx crashes. (well the pc thought that's what it was). I sent the GPU to them on 11/22/2023 and they were able to replicate the issue and declared the GPU toast. it's not 11/27/2023 and they have already shipped me a new replacement. I can't complain. I don''t see any company with that fast of a TAT.
I am so glad I watched this. Haven’t build anything in 10 years. Was about to build my wife and I a new computer. I was about to order ASUS again until now. Thank you!!
Does anyone have experience with the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator motherboard? I just ordered it yesterday and now I that I have seen this video, I am doubting my purchase. The reason that I went with that motherboard is because I wanted a thunderbolt 4 complaint motherboard.  Please reply
Thank you, was looking for motherboards and now I can cross off a ton of bad boards.
Msi all the way for me 😁 msi gpu and msi motherboard if i had the money or time msi pc case for me as well
My z790 just crapped out last 2 weeks. I only got barely 3 months of part time service. Pathetic. My backup system is 7 years old!! Wow!!
A big thumbs up and respect to show us all this dark perspective of Asus 🥰
thanks for the warning.  i was planning on spending about 5k on a new build and was thinking of doing a rog build.  not sure what im going to build now.
Evga>Asus Msi>Asus
Bought a Dark Hero X570 and the wifi crapped out within a couple months, unfortunately I had the board since 2021 and only built with it this year.
Going to Intel would be your biggest mistake.
Me building a pc hearing about Asus as I bought a ASUS Prime Z790-A.
My Asus mobo died. Seems like it was always a problem too. Looks like I'll consider some other brand for its replacement.
I had 3x (THREE) crosshair 8 extreme x570e boards explode when coming out of sleep within the first month after building (no i didnt make any mistakes). The German reseller of course had to comply with the law and replace them, but by the third one I was receiving scratched up pieces of shit for a replacement (so their german support is garbage too). no discount, nothing. on a fucking EXTREME. Fucking great experience buying the most expensive motherboard I've never justified. Now I live in fear that this one is gonna do it, instead of running for 16 years like my old x58 prime. my z370-i was just ok. Done with Asus. Garbage tier experience.
Well crap. Bought an asus mobo last month because the name and previous good experiences.
👍👍👍👍👍
I did have a problem with ASUS got my 4090 TUF and ROG STRIX X670E-F. We are having a hard time from booting and getting it to windows. then we found a temporary solution that i needed to turn of my monitor then turn on the computer. The technician though it was a motherboard issue he said that we would wait for the bios update then we got to update the bios unfortunately  it turn it self off. So we had to buy another motherboard my fault was i bought same brand of motherboard thinking that i was just a faulty motherboard. So i got the same brand again and POOF same result. and i bought again a motherboard that is MSI X670 and the problem is gone and i'm playing with it already.
This has steered me away from Asus components for my new build. Thanks for helping me dodge a potential bullet there.
Why is this the first in hearing of this in all this time?!
Bought a 2nd hand system with 7950x and Rog Strix x670e-a MB. Having trouble getting RAM to perform to spec led me to this video after reading countless posts of users at ASUS forum having myriad troubles . At least I found out before installing my business app's and becoming dependent on the thing for my work. Thanks Jay!
Shit! I ordered an Asus z790 yesterday...
So Jay.... I have just built a pc with the z650E-E for AMD.... I am having trouble, shocker! The immediate issue is the "expo" setting to unlock my memory 6000 speed. It locked the bios.... had to reload it, reinstall windows... etc..... Now I am affraid to even try it again. Went out to specifically look for the troubles and came across your video (and others) so now I'm about to send some stuff back to Amazon and go with a motherboard for and Intel chip and memory. I am pretty sure that this is all I have to replace to re-put the build together for an Intell i9 14900. Can you please help me out as I have spent too much time in research and have a pumpkin sized head now. Please tell me a good recomendation for a Motherboard, Memory for the Intell Chip????? I got a AMD 7800x3D to grab a few more FPS on DCS World.... Would a differant company like MSI take care of this?
I love the PC / Gaming Community… Thanks for speaking out loud and standing for the people who havn’t that much of an impact ❤
Good! Ppl and companies should stand behind their product, not be s***heads. Keep ‘em comin
This video has shown me to NEVER buy ASUS products. Thanks for posting it.
I know this video is 6 months ago But my neighbor called me to help building his PC i had a flashback when i saw his Mobo same as in this video no bend pins or scratches and we started building it then we got to install windows then his games and test some CS2 Dota2 and League then render some of his short film projects and works fine at first then crash we thought it was the GPU overheating but in my head: NO is it?, Then we switched the mobo from my other rig everything works fine we even let the Pc run all night and i said to him get a refund on that Asus Motherboard and buy an Msi or Gigabyte
Well I guess that explains the sus in Asus
I've loved ASUS as a brand for a number of years until about 3 months ago when I purchased a $5,000 laptop from them which I received and never worked. So I called them to get an RMA which they refused to give me stating that it was my problem and was probably a Microsoft issue. This laptop was getting a blue screen and never worked. Not once. After five calls to support, I finally did get an RMA, but it took me many many hours and I had to pay our Tech person by the hour to help me deal with them. Their support is seriously the biggest bunch of total assholes, what a joke. I own a business and I buy all of our computers, and these guys lost me as a customer.  It was so clear and the voices of the support people every time I talk to them that they did not give a fuck about me, the customer, or my problems. Even though this literally had nothing to do with me they just sold me something that was totally defective. They felt that this was my problem, not theirs. I was beginning to think I might have to sue them. They said it's no longer their policy to do returns...wtf? They are right there with HP now in my mind. Loyal corporate customer, gone forever. The same week, I also bought an iBuyPower desktop, it was also defective. Those guys have us-based support, I called them up, got my RMA and it was no arguments a much more professional operation much more customer oriented.
As a longtime customer, I won't be buying ASUS anytime soon
Asus will be the new blackberry.. or nokia. Too arrogant for their own good
jay i have the usb disconnect issue i thought it was the ryzen 7 5800x and connected amd they have been really good but the problem still happens asus on the other hand is saying they released a bios update to fix this which i did and the problem still happens i dont have alot of money as im unemployed to even buy and use gigabyte or msi b550 motherboards to see if the problem it just with the asus board💩
When my refurbished $315 HP gaming PC works better than an ASUS.
Asus ''We don't care'' They should rename just to ''Sus''
i just purchased an asu’s tuf b650 plus mobo for my new 7800x3d… is it still safe to use it without going to the beta? or should i return it since i still can?
I literally just built a new system with an ASUS Z790-Plus WIFI D4 TUF. Haven't heard about these issues until today and yesterday, and this is a 6 month old video. Though I'm not having any problems with the board. Everything has gone smoothly and temps are fine. No power surges or fried parts.
Are the 650e-f versions exploding CPU’s as well?
I will never buy an Asus product again 😞
Oh god I’ve always loved ASUS products .
You could have gotten through as todays news is - "Asus Apologizes for Typo on Evangelion Motherboard, Extends Warranty and Offers Replacements" - perhaps you frightened them lol.
Thank you very much for this. I am in the process of researching products for my next build. I now know to stay away from Asus. You have our backs instead of just milking a sponsor regardless. Huge respect.
MSI motherboards have never led me astray
I got a asus rog strix  b550 and it came with Bent rgb ports and they told me I have to pay for shipping and the fix  and I still have a warranty
I have a b550 should I be worried
ASUS has always been garbage in terms of value, quality, quality control and warranty handling. At least for the past 20 years that I've been following. They wanted to be the Apple of motherboards so bad that they overpriced everything and blamed the user for their sh*tty products with sub par components and poor designs. I'm a bit confused how you are just now realizing it. It's always been exactly like this. Really hoping that your confusion is sincere and not just a big disawov move after sh*t hit the fan hard...
My ASUS RTX 2080S Bricked after few years. And I never OC.
Worst RMA process imageable. I'm going with MSI going forward now that EVGA is gone. EVGA was the best...
O.O I hope these problems are with recent ASUS motherboards, my custom build uses an ASUS motherboard for AMD, I bought all the parts in 2020!
Late comment but I have a ASUS laptop and I've had a lot of small issues that make me want to pully hair out because theres so little documentation about it. Specifically relating to wifi. And I cant use a cable because of how my router is situated
Ive been Gigabyte for a while now. Never had an issue
Asus tuf psu killed my 2 motherboards within 1 days
I most certainly will not be purchasing any asus products anytime soon
coming back to this video after my Evange-N-lion tweet blew up wtf has happened to ASUS lol
You just confirmed my choice of board on my new build coming up. Going with ASRock
so if ASUS is not a good brand, what should i switch to? I hear gigabyte lacks quality control too  maybe MSI?
Asus Rog Thor 1200w Platinum PSU died today on me and it’s brand new too.. time to go back to Corsair
No idea why it took so long for guys to stop swinging from Asus nuts. They’ve been terrible for years
in process of purchasing new gaming pc my IT guy thinks that the issues around the 670 boards are fixed and there is no risk around me going with the Asus ROG Crosshair X670E HERO Motherboard anyone have thoughts one way or other?
so what brand should i switch to most of my personal rig is asus?
Ive always had excellent experiences with Asus. Sad to this being the case.   Jay totally right about asrock, i put one of their boards in my brothers build it works perfectly fine.
Damn I hate to hear this. I’m looking for a new laptop for Christmas. My old ASUS has been a great machine! It was banged around throughout college while I was getting two different degrees at two different colleges at the same time busting through a minimum of 25 hours a semester.
shite, did i get a returned product?
I agree with what is going on with asus. I been using asus for a long time and was the first motherboard I would go to.  I have a Z790, Z590, and 2 Z390.  None of the boards work with what I want to do. Right now I am fighting with the Z790 after the last firmware update. Go to asus support and basically comes down to reinstall OS and see what happens. Even thou nothing has been changed to the OS, only change was a firmware update.  Seems like they don't want to look into there own issues. I give pages of information on what is going on and what is happening and I get told, did you do this or do this.... Which is all in what I already gave them in the documentation.  Comes down to try reinstalling the OS.  Really...With all the crap I have and the hours it takes to reinstall when nothing has been done to the OS or any apps installed. And it was just a BIOS update that made things go to crap.  So Yeah I am over asus boards. Just writing this gets me so frustrated and my mind just goes on and on just like this post. I can't even think straight when that name comes up.  Got rid of my 390 boards but still have the 590 and 790 and looking to see what to replace them with. Any ideas?
These issues are why I didn't even look at ASUS MB when I upgraded my hardware this week. Companies put out sketchy product then refuse to stand behind it & then the half ass fixes void warranties  ya I can do without ASUS. The only thing they have done is tanked a decade of brand building. Gonna  take them a lot of work for people to trust them again, if ever.
Wow. Sat having my morning coffee before heading to a local store to pick up an Asus Rog Strix Scar 18 and randomly clicked on your video. Store trip cancelled, thank you 🙏🏼
I seriously hope they get their shit back together. I've been a rog enthousiast since I got into building my own pcs in the 90s. Hate to see them go down the drain...
so? what happen now. is there any change? i didnt buy new pc because of this. i dont want msi board
Asus and Gigabyte dont honor warranty on GPUs. My last 3 RMAs were declined as they said there was oxidization? The GPUs were in perfect condition, located in a sealed air-conditioned room.
Bruh, I just bought an Asus motherboard 2 days ago...
Well I'm just now seeing this.. On the topic of anti-consumer, I recently purchased and installed the Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360 Illusion as well as six Cooler Master MasterFan MF120 Halo 3n1Fans to match what came with the rad. Well on the pump on the side it has a sticker over a tiny hole that says if removed the warranty is void, as well as the six purchased fans having stickers on the cables saying the same nonsense, which when getting to me two had already been mostly torn. Coolermaster was my first choice for AIO back in the day when I built my first PC. I loved them so much they were my first chair too. Now getting these I feel like as a customer I have no consideration. The pump sticker one takes away from visual aesthetics, and two I know overtime its going to be heated and warped or have the epoxy begin to run downward toward my board. Will it be conductive and short things, no I don't believe so from what I know about epoxy and how it's used to protect boards. But will it eventually slide, collect dust, and void the warranty that relies on the location of a sticker? Absolutely. The fan cables is what really gets me though because of the time it took to route them without tearing a single sticker was infuriating. I've been working with electronics for years, doing board, and cable repairs while I was in the Navy so I have a bit more practice than the standard consumer facing these issues. This seems predatory and unfair. I can't imagine some kid saving all their money to build a PC, ripping off a sticker, turning it on and having a dead fan to only be told it's no longer covered by a warranty. @Jayztwocents
lol I've been absent from the pc vids for a while...wish I saw this before I bought an asus product 2 days ago.  Failed within 24 hours of purchase (Destrier chair) and taking it back this weekend.  Lumbar support clearly lacked quality control where it no longer adjusts.  Popped off a knob to see what was happening and omg there is a screw slightly digging into a round piece of metal (that's supposed to twist and push out like a piston to push the lumbar into your back more) but when you turn the knob it just slips now so with no solid contact turning it no longer adjusts the pressure.  Idk if that is extremely poor design or poor quality control but for a $900 chair either way is an absolute nono, and that really soured my taste with Asus.  That combined with my Asus mobo having some inconsistent stability when using xmp every now and again on z490...I think I'm joining the Asus exit at this point.    I also have a feeling it was a chair previously RMA'd because there is another dent like they had it screwed in at one spot where it made contact before(but don't see how that would last long at all).  It should just be a hole in the metal piece that the screw actually screws into and it would solve the issue and not just a screw making contact on a round piece of metal that makes a small dent that will inevitably fail at maintaining contact.  Like who designed this chair lol
Asus is garbage. I have been a ROG fan for YEARS but as someone who builds PCs regularly I have come across so many problems with their products post covid. And now with EVGA silently going away I feel like all my go-tos are gone :(
Curious as to when AsRock was an "avoid at all costs" brand. I didn't know anything about the brand when I built my first system in 2017 (6 years ago, wow). But some website (can't remember which one) recommended one of their boards (The Z270 Killer SLI for those interested) for my i5-7600k, so I ordered it. Depending on whether this was before or after they got their shit together could explain some of the random blue screens I've gotten throughout the years.
So Jay I have to ask you... Is it the AMD cpus you are not recommending or the ASUS products because as somebody who is in the market for an upgrade I'm getting very mixed messages from you.....
Bye Asus 👋
@JayzTwoCents:  I'd love to hear a follow up on this.   It seems there are many like me, who are looking for some recommendations on a MB manufacturer moving into 2024.   My AM4 X570 system needs a refresh, Even thought my MB is not ASUS, I have the same stability problems.  I've reached my breaking point with the random BS, memory stability and bios shortcomings that seemingly get worse with every BIOS "upgrade/fix." I'm looking to move back to Intel. What manufacturers are providing both service and a top tier intel platform (current & future?) Is MSI still your Choice?
MSI is not too far behind. Recent RMA was a horrifying experience that was waste of months of time and shipping fee. I ended up with downgraded motherboard without any prior notification + and with a missing m.2 heatsink. I do not know which company to even go to anymore.
Ok Im inn , I'm about to build 2x 4k$ systems.  What 690-790 motherboards would you say its good, if se skip the asus ones. ???  I was looking on getting asus but now I wont. But then what to pick ?
I was ordering a new gaming pc - I chose the Ryzen 7 7800x3d in kombination with the RTX4070. - After seeing this video - I have cancelled my order and will get a i 7 13700 K same graphics card. Thank you for uploading.
My TUF x570e just took a dump. At first, the QLED led me down the path of my GPU, then SSD, then acting like my PSU died. But after forcing it to post it became very clear that the board itself was done. The GPU and PSU worked just fine another rig. The SSD I can't test as I currently have the only M2 board in the house.  But the BIOS wouldn't even display after a force post.  So I started to work on an RMA, but man, was that a complete hassle. I was about to just order a cross hair, but after reading reviews of it and my board, I just ordered an MSI.  Honestly I think ASUS has gone the way of Toyota/Honda. "Hey remember us? We made that awesome stuff back then, we don't make it that way anymore but still buy our stuff."
This video confirmed my thoughts, tuf gaming plus x570 has been a nightmare whether it be issues with RAM or lag in games and VR being unplayable, switched to ASRock and everything runs perfectly. I'll never buy an Asus product ever again. This is after sticking with them even with laptops. Utter trash at this point.
damn, so glad i went with an msi motherboard in my build even though i had no idea about the asus stuff..
Truth to be told i only heard good words about alienware... Rest of the gaming companies always got bad rep, from reviews.
And two months later: ASUS, you're rehired! I need your money...
i used to have respect for asus, now its just like JTC said, money printing company.
Coincidentally I have a 7950x3d and asrock combo....as my first build and it's reliable. I had a gut feeling that Asus is trash without really looking into it and boy whattya know
I have the am4 socket asus b550-f gaming motherboard. I like asus i have two of there itx boards but after i upgrade to am5 in the next two  years, i will no longer support asus. I don't know any other good motherboards i can go with. Any good suggestions.
*Thanks a lot for kick out ASUS!,* *some years ago, they were great. Today, I spent 4 hours to try updating the BIOS. Now, I have to send it to ASUS, so that they can repair it. One Decade ago, updating the BIOS was easy and just worked.*
I stopped buying Asus products a few years ago following their poor quality control, terrible warranties and poor customer service.  i laughed when they were heavily promoting the ROG ALLY as i knew i would never own it.  Use Lenovo products for my gaming laptops and PCs now and have not looked back.
Good thing I’ve always been down with MSI. ASUS bit the hands that fed them and it’s going to cost them.
Faced terrible support from Asus not so long ago... I am done with this brand
I just bought an Asus motherboard 🥲
Anyone else have a wired ethernet network issue with the ASUS TUF GAMING B760M-PLUS WIFI D4? It will not boot to a PRIVATE network, only a  public one. There is also NO profile in the registry. Ended up using ChatGPT to make a script that does this on boot-up.
Found this video a little late, but just experienced a failed Asus Motherboard within a year. A short in one of the NVMe slots. Sent it in through RMA and I received an email from Asus with a picture of a bunch of bent pins wanting me to pay for the repair.
I guess you could say Asus is a sus company
Was about to buy an Asus motherboard. Thank you for saving me
I'm never buying an Asus product again. Bought a 'gaming' laptop last year with one year warranty. The motherboard failed after one year of usage now they wan't me to replace the whole motherboard which is gonna cost me a good fortune.They won't even try to fix it and charged me some money just for diagnozing.
This issue has plagued me with my Asus Z690 Strix Gaming WIfi board.  The massively over-voltaging in the bios has degraded my memory controller to the point that I can't run XMP, can't run anything but locked down intel defaults on my 12900k. I just can't trust ASUS anymore.  I didn't want to mess with really OC'ing my system and just enable XMP and left the defaults (ASUS optimizations are the default on this board) and it overvolted the crap out of my CPU and 1 year later it is very unstable.
Thanks Jay, this has probably just saved me a small fortune and hours of time and trouble.  We often choose to buy a particular brand over others due to its perceived superior performance, quality, and support. As consumers, we understand that our resources are limited, and we don't have the financial flexibility to keep replacing or upgrading parts on a regular basis. It's part of what watching you guys do on line with parts we may own or aspire to own one day is about.  When we invest in a brand known for its high performance and quality, we are essentially making a long-term commitment. We do so with the confidence that our purchase will withstand the test of time, reducing the need for frequent replacements. This not only saves us money in the long run but also ensures that we can rely on our purchase for years to come.  Moreover, the quality and support associated with a brand provide us with peace of mind. We know that if an issue does arise, the brand will stand by its product, offering assistance and solutions. This reassurance further justifies our initial investment, making it a cost-effective choice in the grand scheme of things.  In a world where financial prudence is a significant concern for most consumers, choosing a brand based on its perceived superior performance, quality, and support is a smart decision that aligns with our need for durable, reliable, and cost-efficient products.  The last motherboard i purchased for myself a good ten years ago or more was Asus, hence was top of my shortlist, respect for not standing by a sub par product, how will you evaluate their products in the future though?
You should file a lawsuit for selling defective products that marketed as Toptier😏
Ironically my  old Asus Graphics card just died  and I was thinking of rebuilding with mostly Asus products.  mainly just cuz look really good in my build of black/white... now I'm just ignoring looks to go with anyone but Asus.
I’m not including ASUS in any future builds.
Welp, this just diverted me from buying an ROG Strix for my newest build in 10 years. Going MSI
do the same happen for intel processors?
I've used them a lot. Still like them. BUT I don't have anything really new either.
I got the asus Maximus extreme z790 and had to rma the first board because it was dead on arrival! They handled the rma pretty well and haven’t had much issues except my i9 13900k is throttling at stock speeds on Aida 64!
Yet another company that tells consumers that they're number one while treating them like number two.
Yooo Asrock stuff really is rock solid. I use it for every budget build and they end up being the builds I have the least issues with.
I have been using hand-build development systems for myself now for about four years. I couldn't afford to step up to the thread ripper class, so I went Ryzen 9 12-core, and after a short flurry of missteps, I ended up with ROG Crosshair VIII Hero (WI-FI) 128GB-ram, 6TB-SSD. That system was very solid until I dropped the CPU on the floor. When I picked it up, I found the pin array was a mess. Two hours with a magnifier and a pair of tweezers (and many prayers answered) later, it went back into the socket (thank the Lord), and I never touched it again. That system was solid for about two years, and then I started having terrible peripheral problems I couldn't diagnose or live with. I decided to rebuild it with an Asus Intel-style board, using a fairly strong i7. I loaded up Ubuntu 22.04.2 and could never gain stability. It was one thing or another. After wasting a week of my own time fooling around with it, I returned the motherboard to Best Buy and switched to ASUS TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI. It is still not what I want. I am used to Linux(Unix) systems with uptimes that stagger the imagination. Under normal circumstances, there isn't a reason to reboot them. My system does strange things. I will come back to it, and the screen is black. The computer is still running, but the monitor says there is no signal. I can't shell in, I can't control-shift-F2. Touching the power control lightly, hoping to nudge it out of sleep (if it is in sleep) doesn't do anything. Then I do the unthinkable. I pull the plug. I should never have to do that !!  OK my next motherboard (as soon as I can afford it) will be (NOT Asus). My problem is I want to build a development workstation, so I want the hottest Ryzen CPU with memory(at least 128gb-ram), nvme gen5 slot(at least 2), SATA slot(at least 4), double slot for my GPU, slot for my 10Gb nic. Any suggestions for a non-Asus motherboard ??
Bloody Rgb Pirates...😂
I had bad pc parts from other companies before,It’s not just Asus.I’ve had nothing but good Asus parts.
i have asus tuf x670e plus wifi, and is is last asus mb i will buy, i am having stability issues with expo 6000 cl36... i know that i have xmp memory, but in the past i always used xpm kits with amd cpu and have had 0 issues, funny part is that asus and asrock is owned by same people, and it feel like good personal migrated into asrock and shit stayed into asus
Been using an AsRock z170 since it released.  AsRock is the ROCK.
Jay ive been watching you for very long time learned how build pc bc of you and im soo thankful for you 🙏
Im betting Asus has spent too much time on woke justice thereby sacrificing true workmanship.
Yup I can definitely confirm that ASUS is utter shit. They aren't getting another dime of mine. However I will say that MSI makes some pretty crappy products as well especially their laptops which are known to have hinge issues.
I've had great luck with my ASUS products and have just upgraded some things and no problems. So hard to say.
Hey Jay if you where going to buy a gaming laptop for say $2000, is taht mid range?  What would you buy?
makes me not want to update my bios to 14th gen for z790-e.
I am having an issue right now with the Z790 Extreme and got an RMA with a cracked diagnostic screen, RSVD 1 switch left to on, dirt and pubic hair on thermal pads, all m.2 latches were broken off. 7 responses from upper management saying it is normal wear and tear.
Huh, so I had an Asus TUF B450 pro gaming Mobo and it just stopped working, now it's making so much sense. Thanks Asus, I couldn't afford to replace my pc and had to sell my desktop due to your sh*t
Thank you for being completely brutally honest and ripping into ASUS. This is awesome. I had 3 DOA asus motherboards two B550's and a B650. Never got my money back for the b650, or the replacement. Asus support and Asus themselves are just terrible.
I just bought a Z690E gaming mother board for new pc build and could not even get it to post until I flashed the bios via usb drive. I wasted 2 days eliminating possible hardware issues. Asus customer support never recommended I flash the bios. I had to figure it out on my own. And as you said my warranty could very well be void lol. Oh well system is running good now but that is some BS imo.
Hey I have an ASUS looking to go to a semi white silver MB is MSI good and if so which model is Balanced for everyday use and some gaming for COD?  I have an Intel i7 13700K and DDR5 6000 memory at 32GB
The whole production line of ROG has quality problems and those cheap products are not. It's a shame his reputation is going to shit.
more backbone than Linus
I am shocked about Asus failure. I just found that today
My first build was around 2004 with an Asrock board, since then I have always ridden with Asrock. Asrock is absolutely top
I've always wondered if reselling RMA products is common among manufacturers?
Hello! great video thanks! question, If I have a budget to buy some new parts for PC like motherboard, RAM and CPU. Is there a webpage to build this? thanks!
BE CAREFUL I FOUND THE PROBLEM BUT THIS MUST BE SEEN FROM A TECHNICIAN  ITS THE PINS ON AM5 SOCKET!!!!!!! YOU HAVE AS MANY PROBLEMS BECAUSE THERE IS A PIN SOMEWHERE IN THIS SOC bent AS IT WAS ON MY ASUS PRIME 670E PRO IT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MARK TAKE A MAGNIFIER AND CHECK IT AGAIN AND AGAIN..... THE PIN WAS BENT TO THE OUTER POSITION A BIT SO DON'T TRY TO GET IT WRIGHT IF DON'T KNOW HOW !!!!!! AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T CHECK IT IN MANUFACTURING PROCESS.AFTER I GET IT WELL DONE THE SYSTEM    WAS RUNNING FAST AND SMOOTH WITH MY RYZEN 7900X POST AND RUN IN 10 SECONDS!!!! YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE WITH YOUR PHONE CLOSE ENOUGH AND THEN ZOOM IT THE MB WAS KNEW AND UNOPENED THE PLASTIC COVER YOU DON'T HAVE TO SQUEEZE IT TO OPEN!!!!!!! PUT FIRST THE PROCESSOR AND THEN TAKE IT OUT GENTLY .IT IS WAY MORE FASTER THAN AM4   .THERE ARE SOME FALSE DIRECTIONS IN YOU TUBE BE CAREFULL!!!!!
Wow with almost 4 million subscribers Asus definitely going to feel this one. No doubt I've been an Asus fanboy way back since 2010, I've not been upgrading my PC for almost 11 years now, and guess what the motherboard is Asus and it lasted that long without issues even with the latest Bios for the MB. And I even bought their Asus Laptop because it's quality that can last long. Thanks for the views and heads up, not going for Asus anymore. They will feel the pinch just like Asrock before.
This is one of the main reasons I switched to MSI when one my friends asked me to build him a new PC recently as well. Since my friend does not know about PC as much as I do, I do not want him to have to face all these RMA and customer service problems by himself. (Not to mention ASUS has been insanely increasing the prices for their ROG lineup.)
The USB-Board Bug is also still a thing, removing USBs that cause Freezes and Crashes of the whole system.
I watch this video again and again, love it. hahaha...so true...we unveiled them..
I updated the X470 Bios probably 20 Times, still BSODs and Freezes...Disaster Asus with alleged "PEAK" Products... MSI Board nearby, smooth, clean, no bsod, everything like butter.
I miss the good ol' P55T2P4 era 😢
Hi Jay, do you think that ASUS have turned a page and are better now or are you still no longer supporting them?
are we surprised, AMD systems having drivers and bios issues? COME ON.... chumps buy amd because they can't afford Intel.
damn
I have a 3k Asus (1 year ago) and a 2k lenovo (10 years ago). Can you guess which one is working without hardware problems? yup Lenovo.
asus need to step up, recently i too had a problem with asus products, i bought a wifi 6 router ( tuf ax5400) after the updated firmware,  my router went faulty, ie. the led status did not showing and also frequent disconnection, they offered me a replacement with the tuf ax6000,  now there is a firmware updated, i am currently scared to update after what i went through...however i do appreciate thier efforts in replacing my ax5400 with ax6000
This is nothing new. The company I worked for in the early 2,000's stopped using Asus boards for the same reasons. Flakey boards, and lousy support. We switched over to MSI at the time because their support was great.
Funny, i had AsRock Z68 Pro3 board with i5 2500k for many years and it worked perfectly, i gave that pc to little brother and it still As Rock Solid :D
My Tuf Board From 2016 Had a bios up date and from that date it would some times crash when trying to sleep had to wait for a new bios update to fix it I updated for windows 11 and its fixed and I could not even do it through the bios internet update I had to do it through the usb update   because the bios said It was on the latest version  just some stupid things that i have not had with gigabyte or the msi ones i have used and built for people
Is this board still not worth it even with the new BIOS that recently came out?
Not going to buy a single part from ASUS anymore. End of Story.
It's da vaxx
I smashed all my ASUS stuff after watching this.
I've been anti Asus since I bought a Z290 Maximus, it came with no bios chip, sent it back to newegg got a new board, still no chip, Newegg then told me to deal with Asus, RMAed the board, they sent it back with the bios chip in it but would not post, they then send me the bios chip alone, and it was missing pins.
imagine spending $700 on a motherboard
Sound like a google map review.
ASUS has been doing this for years. Im glad someone has said something and is refusing to deal with the company because of it. MSI is going to be the king from here on out.
ASUS used to be the GOAT in the early 2010s and they have completely gone down the toilet. My latest build is an MSI board going on three years and I haven't had a single issue with it.
I hate this brand the most! Bought a 1500 Laptop - Went bad in 1.5 years. NEVER AGAIN!
RIP Asus, I greatly pray for your downfall, you don't deserve your customers' loyalty.
I once had an MSI board fail in 2011. "To fix Intel’s 6 Series chipset design error, the SATA problems in its 6 Series chipset, MSI implements the latest Intel B3 Stepping 6 Series chipset on its P67/H67 mainboards for fixing SATA problems in the Intel Series 6 chipsets." It was a hassle to remove the motherboard and be without a working PC for a few days, but they were honest about it and replaced it for free with an updated version. I've been using MSI ever since.
I've had to use ASRock as an alternative to build my very first gaming PC back at 2010. It was the "weak" spot on my rig, it had OCZ Reaper DDR2 ram, an Phenom II 550, a rebuilt Antec power supply. I expected that board to let me down. I've replaced everything on it, but that motherboard. Did handle the whole rig to my elder brother, that thing still runs solid. I just can't believe that ASUS went to the one I want, to the one to avoid.
You can tell everything you need to know about a company by the quality of their customer service.
Sadly in my area unless I want the utter gaudyness and obnoxious looks of MSI products ASUS is one of few other choices. But thanks for the heads up!
me staring at my last Tuf Gaming MB 😭
Fuck - I've had Asus motherboards for like 20 years. Buying a new comp, and it won't be from them. I'm so sad... I loved that brand.
anyone know if this issue has been fixed?
Thank you so much for this information.. It saves me a good chance that my system will get fried with a new Strix card.. such a shame because my MB and current GPU are both Strix but now I'll likely be moving away from Asus and ROG..
my asrock board completely died 1 day  literally on the 3rd / last year of warranty.. i never bought asrock again
ROG STRIX MOBO audio is such a problem and the bloatware, if i knew i would've never bought
bro i loved asus and i was thinking on upgrading my cpu and mobo soon but looks like i need a different type of mobo i dont want my x3d to explode. no more asus products for me. let em know we dont support theyre shitty deeds.
Just removed ASUS mobo from my order list.
As rock still has this cheap image from back in the days. My personal experience is that as rock is rock solid... I'm happy to buy as rock sny day. My nemesis with 2 dead mainboard batteries from a new unopened box was MSI. Also shady support and scalping operations. I personally fired MSI from my options. Sad to see that Asus is going down the drain. It was always a good reliable brand in the past.
this is too much drama, a lot of bs. Like they care ur channel bro.
The fact that ASUS doesn’t offer burn in warranty for their PG27AQDM OLED model proofs that they don’t stand behind their products lmao
Does this include the ASUS PRIME Z790-A WIFI ATX LGA1700 motherboard? I was going to get this for my build what other motherboards do you suggest?
ASUS sucks! I hate what they did to me!
asus MOTHERBOARDS  olways prablem witch RAM
you tell em jay dont take that BS man big respect to you
Been pseudo binging your channel vids, love the info you put out but not sure where to send questions.  So.. I had a tendency to go with Asus products in the past but with recent issues they seem to be having, can you recommend an alternative brands to look towards especially with EVGA going away as well. Looking at new MB and CPU with a Video card in future, currently running a Giga Z590 w/ i9 11900KF and Giga 3090 Aorus Master. Also looking at replacing the case I am using and wonder if you have recommendation for a good full tower? Doesn't need to include fans or RGB as I will be installing those myself. I don't plan to do intensive water cooling just AIO CPU for now, dipping my toes in the water you could say. But I want it to have good amount USB3.X and USB-C as well as modular design capability. Thanks for any ideas and thoughts.
Bummer.. I got me an asus mb for my build. I've had to wipe it clean 5 times just to pin point that Aurmory crate was the program causng instability.
Damn.  I love ASUS products. This sucks. Oh well.
Hello Jay - ich have the same problems with my Asus Mainboards - now i get the third Asus ProWR 80 Sage SE wiFi - because the first - the CPUsocket was damaged - the second one - the BIOS can not setup a RAID with the SSDs -NVMe -built into the Mainboard - thanks for your video
..had two of their Creator ProArt boards in a row come in faulty from two diff retailers a couple months ago... ended up going back to gigabyte for my last build
In the last few months I bought a few Asus motherboards from New Egg.  The First one was a Rog Strix Z390-H Gamer came from China and it took a couple of days to make work about OK.  In the mean time I ordered another motherboard, a Asus  Gaming Z690-PLUS WIFI D4.  I had a bios error and no post.  When I added an old video card it just barely worked.  So I returned it for a new one.  The new one could not install window 10, 11 and linux.  I phoned Asus, no support phone lines in Canada. For support I waited about 30 Min and when I talked to a tech, he just hung up on me.  So I bought a MSI board and I did not get any serious problems.  I agree with you, Asus is out forever.
thank you for this video you saved me from buying an asus from amazon, deleted from cart lol
Have you and ASUS reconciled yet?
I can't believe this was 4 months ago, hopefully this video saves Asus.
The decline of Asus started a long time ago, and not just motherboards. I'm a corporate buyer and stopped purchasing Asus over a decade ago. Your experiences are par for the course.
Thank god I found this… was about to build a new PC and upgrade from gigabyte parts to asus since memory express has bundled deals for MOBO and cpu… now I’m nervous AF 😂 are the higher tier gigabyte MOBO and 4080 GPU good? 😂
Was just considering an ASUS mobo for a new build... I guess I will look elsewhere now. ASUS, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
I think it would have been just better to do the Video explaining all ASUS faults first hand.  They can then "sack" you (same result for you) or take it on the chin and try fix things now it is public.  That would leave things open for discussions on how/what needs to be done.
I will never buy this brand again.. thanks finally someone honest
I love Asus !! I never had an issue with Asus I have been using them for over 35 years since 1989 jayz two pennies buy brand new and see if you get those bent pins
is this for all motherboards??
Oh dang im used to buy stuff for Asus. Look like they are over it.
When u get something free and still complaining 😮
Watching this video with Freebird playing in the background hit different.
I have a ROG Maximus 9 hero Z270 and was thinking of upgrading to a newer one and now ASUS is just not one of the motherboards I'm gunna look at. Thanks for this great video and it really gives me confidence in the selection of product you guys choose.
Wait is this why my pc would just crash and freeze and id have to hard reset it atleast like 2 times a day....
Jayz- I've been so busy with personal life that I missed all the Asus drama. But I lived through 3x motherboard nightmares last year. Manufacturing defects across 2 new ones and 1 replacement they sent me. It took me 4 months to get my replacement (thst they tried to charge me for because the lost my board they already analyzed but asserted they never received it. Mind you I was still waiting for the replacement so back and forth a couple dozen times me asking "what could you possibly be charging me for"). Utter, utter, incompetence. I turned the koolaid spicket off.
This has been a problem for a sustained time, and I am sad that content creators are now finally calling them out. Not because it took so long; I mean they can always swing back and do better, but they have not. :(
Just to be clear, is this only with Mobo's that run 7000 series CPU's only? or is it happening with the 5000 series aswell.
after i buy asus rog phone and also motherboards and i didn't get any support on any of them ! i stop even looking to asus product , they are nice only for design ... otherwise they are bad since 2020 till now !   we need better company to trust it with it any advice ?
Just buy everything with a credit card then charge back through the bank, that will fix them
As a company they have definitely gone down hill. they refused to replace my 5 month old defective power adapter for my laptop after MAKING me send it in for trouble shooting even though i told them i was pretty sure the adapter was the issue. I had to pay over $20 for shipping and then they said it was customer induced damage and wanted me to pay $116 for the adapter. ON THE INVOICE it says the adapter is $25, the AC cord is $4, LABOR $60, and shipping back to me was another $20... oh plus tax...  Labor for sending me a part that costs more than the part??? What is happening over there?!
They're all 3rd party companies....and they all have the same mentality.  The good ones go out of business because they do things the right way and cheap people don't want to pay for that premium.  I'm talking BFG and EVGA as example.  Also the enthusiast gaming community is very small compared to the whole industry.  I mean, GPU's aren't even being prioritized for gaming now, nVidia is pushing most chips to AI.  We're supplemental income for most of these companies.
Have they bothered to respond at all???? 4 million subs, over 2.1 million views, and nothing after 4 months.
I have been looking into getting a pre built via Digital Storm, however they only offer asus mobo's. Does anyone know if they will use other brands? Reluctant to get anything asus now...
Should be a mass lawsuit against them. 💲💲💲💲🤔
Asus should closed doors be done sell off stock
This sucks.... I love my Asus monitors, they've lasted so many years and are great.
There's no good laptop brands left. Obviously you can always spend 3 grand on a laptop, but that would be silly.
I totally ghosted ASUS for MSI too. I now wonder why I haven't been using MSI. Now all 6 systems in my house have an MSI board. Solid!
What X670 mother board would you use and what cpu would you use with it as well as GPU for the whole build?
Asus still fired 4 months later? Honestly curious
ASUS.  You lost my business
Damn. Guess I read this too late, my whole computer is basically Asus but I haven’t had any issues so I guess I’m lucky.
Can you do a video on motherboard manufactures like who to use after asus a lot of video makers use them.
I think Asus will be ok....
I first started deploying Asus motherboards in the 1990's and generally they were the first choice for the following 25yrs, although expensive gigabyte and intel server boards were nice alternatives.  In 2019, I noticed significant issues with new ASUS server boards.... and degradation of overall support services and bio updates.  ASUS is dead to me.
Asus rog strix the worst laptop ever built.. never... NEVER buy a asus laptop...if you buy one youll regret for sure..
I don't think I've ever bought an ASUS product that actually worked without problems. So far I've bought a motherboard and a router ... the MB has problems with microphone input, router randomly loses internet connection every 10 minutes for a few seconds due to their crappy firmware. I've had to buy extra things every time so far, just so I can get the very basic things to work.
I never understood why some people are still obsessed by Asus, every product I bought from them was a fail, hence I stopped buying any of their products 15 yeas ago.
Wait a minute! You're a goaltender???
So what brand are we going with now?
got Flow Z13, this tablet is really a disaster, i brought this thing to the service center nearly 5 times! 5 TIMES!!!  and ASUS warranty is really sucks! only 1 year full coverage in 2 years warranty? they can kiss my A.. after this i will never buy your product ever AGAIN ASUS
Hey, I have been having problems with Asus boards for a while now, specifically my last two boards, most recently Asus Maximus Hero Z690, where they just will not run stable in XMP.   I didn't know this was such a widespread issue.  Where have I been for four months? lol.   I always associated the big Asus brand name with quality, and I honestly thought it was the RAM, or maybe just something I've done.  Now I'm watching this video going, what the heck, do I just need to stop buying Asus?  I consider myself squarely novice, so I frankly rely on Jay, Steve and Paul for the tech news.  Heck, I put my first PC together just watching Paul do a walkthrough.  I'm a sucker for brand name, and I can say before I watched this video, since EVGA is now out of the GPU space, the next GPU I bought was going to be Asus.  Now I doubt I'll buy either an Asus mobo or GPU.  It's like the last pieces of the puzzle are finally falling into place.  I think it's time to give some other manufacturers the chance at my business.  Thanks, Jay.
There's a lot of righteous indignation here.  Obviously ASUS has had a major PR issues with exploding high-end MOBOs.  I appreciate that you had a bad anecdotal (personal) experience with a white high-end MOBO, but the criticism has a ring of indignation that ASUS did not truly give due deference to a major influencer.  I agree that repurposing returns (especially without checking them out) as new is laziness, bad policy, and causes unforced errors.  I will look at other manufacturer MOBO reviews with an open mind and may well change my buying habits.
If you buy with a credit card. Your protected. Section 75 is your secret financial superhero – buy something costing more than £100 and less than £30,000 on your credit card, and your card company has a LEGAL responsibility to come to the rescue if there's a problem.
Thats what happens when you put the shareholders first and not the costumer. rip asus
Lol you just could,nt make it up
I have a ASUS ROG Strix X670E-F that works well and itll still be the last asus product i buy. Toxic company.
Thank you
Okay honestly the usb port problem with frequent disconnecting and connecting randomly has been in Asus motherboard for longggg time (like many generations of intel) and for some reason they havent fix it. It actually corrupted my external hard drive because it disconnected during usage. Yeah i can zero in on the motherboard because all usb devices doing the same shit and only in that motherboard. Change it to different brand, and its all smooth sailing. Secondly my asus laptop suddently turns off and couldnt be powered anymore. Its just so sudden without any warning, and guess what, i found out that its a common problem with Asus laptop too. Never will i ever buy Asus product again. Its bad quality product with premium price.
FYI: MSI is no better in customer support. They don't accept any responsibility for misselling, lying, and messing up their drivers. So don't expect much from them either
Amd and asus both sucks..
End of 2020, I bought the 2021 ASUS A15 FLAGSHIP TUF Gaming laptop. It has been AMAZING! I'm on it right now. But it's time for an upgrade and I don't think I'll be getting a new ASUS. Instead I'll build a custom desktop with parts from companies that care about their customers and stand by their products.
I have one of these motherboards, with a 7 800 X3D, system seems fine but should I update the bios?
I have one of these motherboards, with a 7 800 X3D, system seems fine but should I update the bios?
I"m glad I waited for my upgrade.  Will avoid asus MB next round.
After watching this I recently went looking for a new motherboard that was NOT ASUS. First I saw a review of the new B650 motherboards (all 35) and all of the ASUS were priced equally but used cheap components that would not handle the heat. So all of them were not recommended. Then I went to PC website selling motherboards and they had only 33 left. I went through the list and an awful lot of the 33 were ASUS. I'd like to think that you had an influence in saving builders from the mistake of thinking ASUS was still top of the game.
It's a pitty that I didn't find and watch this video earlier because I still relied on ASUS good reputation over the last 30 years and ordered a TUF Gaming X670E-Plus WIFI which arrived here with only three RAM slots working. And yes, If you have whatever tip to try to get all slots working, I have already tried it. - The board is definitely damaged in some way. It's so damn annoying.
I've had multiple Asus mbd along with Intel cpu, but the last one went dead while still under warranty. My builder sent it out for rma and warranty was denied due to a bent usb pin. My builder then graciously replaced it with another Asus that I have to underclock to 85% otherwise temps go thru the roof.  Fool me once ASUS, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
thanx for this revelation Jay,two days ago my asus motherboard also gave up the ghost,it wont even start,it was a very expensive undertaking,i needed a computer with power for music production,the last time when i tried to start it up,nothing,i needed a replacement this time however i went for an MSI motherboard with an intel CPU,that way i wont have surprises with the memory compatibility wich AMD has,on the online store where i do my component shopping there was not much choice for AMD certified memory,cheers mate
I bought a asus strix b650e f before all this, I am about to build my pc and I am hesitant on building it now seeing this.
Back in 2012, I think, their motherboards had quality problems... I dropped the brand since. Western Digital had a similar problem with their caviar series after buying Quantum but with time they grew costumer's confidence again. For me, Asus never made it back.
Not me watching this just after I bought an ASUS motherboard 🥲
Honestly gave up on Asus about 6 years ago. Used to really like the TUF line, but they've really dropped the ball on quality, but importantly, actual build design. When I was looking to build my 9th generation build, they were so sparse on SATA connections, multiple LAN connections, and just seemed like they were more interested in 'cute' designs than actual horsepower. I had good luck with an RMA in the past as far as getting it overnighted, but I've been completely happy between a Z390 Taichi Ultimate and this Z790 Taichi Carrara have been absolute monsters.
I've had good success with Gigabyte products for the past several builds.
GamersNexus ought to win a Pulitzer Prize this year in 2023.
Ive never had any good luck with ASUS parts for a computer. Prebuilt laptops havnt been terrible but everytime ive used their motherboards ive been met with nonstop issues. armory crate also is hot garbage.   Im a gigabyte guy.
As a long time high end pc builder, Ive always done exclusively asus builds where possible...  After hearing the warranty deal, this made  my choice even easier. I have  been purchasing msi and asrock products. Ive built probably 50 pcs since this video has been released and that money would have normally been gone to asus for boards and graphics cards. I had the chance to buy the rog  4090's for these high end builds, instead I went with founders cards. I dont think there is much asus could do to change my mind.
Here’s a hot take: don’t get mad and blame asus because you went amd and your build didn’t last 4 months
Its hard for me to listen, course  ... i bought Asus / Asrock parts like Graficcard, Mainboard for the last 15 years. For me they produced good and stabil hardware. So ... what now ? Still bying there stuff, change to another producer ? :/ Edit: Never had problems .... But, to be honest. My 1gb Ehternet conector sometimes change to 100MB. If i just change the cable , i return to 1GB. ( After some time the same issue, i change to the old cable, back to 1gb.) ... so thats all done as an error right now.
My 8 months old gamer pc all of sudden died under gaming. I think it's the Asus motherboard fault. It's still under RMA. If I can avoid Asus from now on, I will. Piece of sh*t brand.
I always liked the idea of one branded builds, more compatibility, One software controls all & flexing purposes. and MSI was my go to Brand .  During the usage of my "MSI" build (which I did in 2016), I saw how elegant / high end Asus "ROG" line was; and wanted to switch over to a FULL Asus ROG build whenever I need an upgrade.  Anyways, it's 2023, time for a whole new build! I went through Parts picking, which I consistently picked everything ASUS "ROG" despite the price difference compared to its counterparts (It is obviously more expensive). I showed the build suggestion to my friends for feedback (before ordering) and they told me: "Your build is great, But just watch this video".  I follow this channel for years now and I recognized Jay chill attitude regarding everything. unlike other hyper critical content creators for over small stuff. BUT MAN THIS MESSAGE WAS SERIOUS!!  I knew this is a serious deal. Without any hesitation, I went back to all "MSI" build again.  "MSI" , I guess we're gonna spend more time together :=)
my gt510 case had every fan installed backwards, 3 front fans pushing air out of the case, with a filter, like the dirty air from inside the case is gonna mess my room 😂😂😂
Hi jayz, I would like you to refer you to the Asus forums regarding the Asus rog ally. I hate to see consumers treated regarding the Rog ally. Would you like to make a video about that? Just to protect the consumers? Please take a look at the Rog ally forums regarding the SD card malfunctioning. Something has to be done... Thank you!
I’ll never forget when I had a warranty and their monitor had stopped working which was not my fault, and I ended up having to pay almost just as much as I bought it for
Asus 4 months later: Still doesn't realize or care.
After 7yrs of Asus devotion, my new 7950x build is MSI and Corsair.  Crazy bad quality issues, RMA'd 2 x AIO's and 2 x Crosshair VIII Formula MB's  Horrible RMA process. FREEDOM HAS NEVER FELT SO GOOD!!!
I do love when greedy boardroom policy's translate to some hard feedback in the real world. Hopefully that company will consider the damages caused to the company by those managers on their corporate side.
Holy shit im glad i came across this vid. I was about to buy Asus Mb, GPU's but now, i dont know who to go with for reliability :(
How you feel about hp?
Built my first new PC in 8 years. 970 to a 4080.  It is an Asus GPU.  I am shitting myself, lmao
absolutely
It was absolutely by chance that I found this video. I'm looking at finally building a new rig and was researching the 4090. I've been a huge ASUS fan in the past, many years ago. When EVGA ducked out, I started looking at replacement vendors, and a lot of people were moving toward ASUS. I didn't give it another thought. Thank you so very much for the straight talk!  Absolutely, if the post-sale experience is shit then what's the point. I'm very grateful to have viewed this. Subscribing!
ASUS has lost my business. Don't want to say forever but maybe, just maybe.
I had problems with my asus phone and landed here. The problem with asus is at a systemic level.
peak
Good going posting this man mad respect..
asus is in busy with one eye project, so they didn't care about their consumer
Beautifully said sir, thank you for sticking up for the consumer.
9/18/23 just order brnad new z790-A wifi - wont load xmp profile, wont load any kind of overclocking or fast boot, might not consider asus for super high end anymore, no good bios support or updates
I only have old ASUS stuff so im not scared ^^.
im upgrading from 5800x3d for my 4090 build, so should i go Z790 + 13/14 I9 K/KS or X670e + 7/8 950x3d?
Also, the only thing I'd buy from Asus would be their monitors because the PG279QM I have is awesome
Have you gotten a 4090 Founder's Edition without coil whine because I've gone through 3 in search of one, then tried a gigabyte gaming oc 4090 and it had a worse silicon lottery for MHz, so I returned it and it had coil whine, so I don't want an AIB 4090. So I'm just wondering if a 4090 FE without coil whine exists?
Asus' bad QC is even visible in how many asus tuf/strix 4090s are suffering the most notorious coil whine issues of this GPU generation
I tried getting a PG27AQN for my setup and there was a problem with all 4 of the screens I've had so far, the current screen has a stuck Red Pixel but it's in a place where it's not as noticable but it still appears on Back rip. Idk if I want to try the panel lottery again it took 2-3 months so far and I'm still waiting for some refunds.
Why I'm not Surprise for this. Cause ASUS even during the "Rock Solid Heart Touching" era. I already Did ASUS. And went to Gigabyte. And Continue to DIS ASUS Brand. Well, for 1 their Warranty/service centre in Malaysia sabah here are pretty much better off.
Thanks for this video. I nearly bought an ASUS board but am now going to go for the msi mpg b650 carbon I think
Really wish that I had seen this before I started my build in late July. I have used an ASUS ROG GENE Rampage II motherboard in my rig since 2010. (yeah I am one of those folks who doesn't need to upgrade every 15 minutes) It was finally time for a change,  though, and I felt good about what the money's worth I got out of that board for over a decade. I decided to go with ASUS again. This time around I didn't have someone else build the system out for me. I decided to solo my first build. (with a lot of guidance from some fine folks on YouTube - thanks Jay as well as others)   Now I am running Z690 Maximus Extreme with a intel 13900KF.. Somehow I did not catch wind of what had been going on with ASUS boards until after my 30 day return window had closed. In my video watching I was more looking at technical build tutorials than reviews I suppose.   Anyway, at this point I am trying catch up on what I need to be watching out for in terms of bad behavior and keeping my fingers crossed. From what I could tell this particular board might not have been among those that were having the issue, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong. I would rather know.   Its a shame too. I really let my ASUS flag fly with the build, all the way down to the custom paint job I did on my modded Cooler Master HAF case. (the same one I bought in 2010. I think I kept it around long enough that it's not just old now. its retro! lol) I feel a lot less pride in that now, unfortunately, given what has been going on with ASUS current display of integrity, or the lack thereof. Still the ASUS accented paint job is unique, beautiful and took a ton of work. I won't change it at this point, even though it might be more attention than they deserved. After the time money, effort and love I have put into this build though, if their products fail me and they don't make things right, I will be quite unforgiving. The 1C3B0X lives!  Now I just hope she doesn't catch fire on me. haha Wish me luck.   I will end by saying thanks to @JayzTwoCents for the good advice and key tutorials.
Same Thing Happened To Me With The Crushed Pins And They Wouldn't Repair Or Replace Done With Asus
Love my ASRock board
I am sorry you are having problems wt Asus, I have used them for over 30 years.  I am a tech guy in the Denver area, I will talk wt my fellow tech people in the area and see if they are having issues.
Does their problems also affect their hero Maximus z790 boards? Cause I just bought one and saw this video.
Really appreciate the video and you using your platform to make a stand. Hope it makes a difference down the road with asus , but even if it does not , at least folks that seen this will do their research before blindly buying “xxxx” brand. I kind of wish one of the big YouTubers such as you or GN would maybe go the extra mile and give folks a solution in instances like this. Like hey this company is less $hit, here was our blind support experience with each one. Possibly do a video on the big companies  support process. Maybe take 5 or more random parts from random vendors and go through the warranty process as the average joe and show your experience. Kind of like a secret shopper. Could even have viewers that maybe have a defective product in warranty send them in for you to use as a test case. I know it’s not gonna be a huge sample size . However if you had 10 instances with motherboards or video cards with Asus, MSI or Gigabyte and 7 out of 10 positive with one brand and 3 out of 10 with the others … I feel like it would empower the viewers. Viewers would maybe speak with their $$$ and force the $hit vendors to step up. Because as an average consumer it’s hard to pick one brand. Reddit is full of people crapping on each brand lol. I mean I get it , folks are less likely to go on Reddit and say wow I had the best time ever. Some do, but folks are more likely to go out of their way to complain about a bad one. I dunno just a thought. Kind of like your “which brand we can trust in 2022” video but with more in depth look into the actual RMA of each. Which that video kind blew my mind with how much   asus went down in a year. Either way thanks for all that you do in your videos and keep being you ❤
I’m glad I saw this before choosing a new mobo. My tuf gaming mobo that came with my prebuilt for some reason refuses to work with 2 ram sticks in (on top of the fact that my i5-10400f is bottlenecking my 12gb 3060). I was considering upgrading to another tuf gaming mobo but I think I may consider a different brand now thanks to your video
why i love MSI..
Very Good Information! Thank you for lifting this!! Screw the ASUS crap
Is this only an issue with Ryzen CPU’s or has anyone experienced problems with one of their Intel mobos?
It has been years that I am seeing Asus decline. At first it was not so obvious because their main hardware was still great. But it started to being more apparent as they start putting their name on garbage screens, garbage case, garbage prebuilt, garbage portable devices...Still I was still confident in their main stuff, the motherboards and GPGUs. But now even that is jumping through the window. I would say that Asus became a greedy w**re and they forgot about the customer for short term easy money.
my sister recently got a tuf b550 plus with wifi and its been having alot of issues since it got built wifi and blue tooth sometimes doesn't even show up.
was just about to grab an Asus board bundle, perhaps not then.
Well shit I wish I would of watched this video before I bought an Asus mb😢
This deeply upsets me.   My first RMA experience with ASUS was phenomenal. I purchased one of their high end X58 boards and it went DOA within three months. I called their outstanding (at the time) US based support, and they sent me another board with no questions asked. The new one arrived, I shipped out the old one, and that was it. It was an experience that made me an ASUS customer for life and I haven’t bothered looking at other brands since.   Asus used to have a hands on culture with their community. I remember downloading beta bios for that board from a community forum sponsored by Asus. Their community managers used to offer these and they would not void your warranty.   So sad.
Just when you totally redeem yourself you pull another stunt asus.  Back to a Dell xps.
My asus prime a320m-k works fine
To be honest, the AM5 launch has been disastrous for AMD in general.
When I first built my computer a month ago this is about the same issues I was having. Mouse was stuttering, sound cutting out, videos choppy., and it specifically wouldn't pick up speakers. I mean it literally specifically would not recognize speakers. It was fine then just all of a sudden went out. It would pickup headphones no problem but I tried 3 different sets of speakers and it specifically wouldn't recognize them, I don't know what the deal was. Mine's a 7800x3d, 7900xtx, and MSI tomahawk x670E. I updated the bios but it was still doing it, then I did a system restore and tried updating the bios again. I don't know why but it let me update the bios again, or maybe it didn't actually do it the first time, I'm not sure. Regardless, after I did that the computer was fine.  I had a Asus p6t deluxe v2 when I built my original computer in 2008 with an i7 920, it was a decent enough board and never gave me issues. Then I had an Aorus with my 8700k and now I have an MSI. Asus prices for their motherboards was kinda ridiculous when I was looking at AM5 boards. Getting 4 m.2 slots and PCI 5 is ridiculously hard to find unless you wanna pay 600+. That's why I went with the Tomahawk, it was under 400, has 4 m.2 slots, and has PCI 5.
damn, I like evga and asus. what the hell am I suppose to do
Edit. I forgot, I actually have this neat little extension that allows me the ability to block youtube channels. No point in trying to reason with clearly moronic "influencers".
is ROG out of this, i mean ROG is independent company under ASUS? Or?
This is eye opening, too bad I found this after I put together my very first AMD build. Good thing I went with the MSI board.. I have a ROG laptop that's been pretty solid, it's sad to see that ASUS has gone downhill in their customer support. Just came across your content recently and appreciate it. Cheers!
Wow I was going to make my daughters first build an asus build……..yup not anymore. Thanks for the info Jay we all appreciate it!!!!!!!
I recently bought 32" TUF  series monitor, it was absolute garbage. But I hear their ROG series are great. Why have two series of products that have pretty low price difference. Asus, stop making TUF monitors. Stick to ROG.
I don't know about motherboards, but I have 5 Asus souped  up routers, they've been great. I did have one defective, Asus replaced it with a brand new one within 3 weeks.
gotta love a guy whos not afraid to roast one of his sponsors. shows where your loyalty is at. im not even a regular viewer or heavy into pc stuff. mad respect man keep it up!
Good thing I saw this video, I was heading into buying an Asus TUF gaming X670E plus. Now I'm looking at swapping to the MSI MAG X670E tomahawk (or any other similarly priced and well reviewed competitor I can find). Similarly priced, but from a company that apparently knows how to make a product.
Sad news indeed I always use ASUS for my builds . Now I will have to reconsider my options , Well done Jay for telling the truth
I like to buy the ROG Radeon GPU’s so I’m a bit sad not to see reviews of future products.
I bought gpu for the need. Happily gaming now with both pc and old xbox. Better be i generation behind.
I got sucked into the Asus void, treating” myself to a brand new, completely Asus build. (The ROG Evangelion collaboration). Needless to say,  it’s set me back a pretty penny, but more important, the hours spent with instability issues troubleshooting. The time spent just getting it to turn on, to even post, to detect the ram. Changing different fan configurations in a losing battle inside a case that was never gonna be “cool”, just look cool.  Game crashes, fatal errors, Asus’ ever expanding bloatware to fix every hardware issue with software.   You nailed it on the head - complacency. The brand I  used to trust decided to become ostentatious, all lights, all aesthetics , no quality control.   That evangelion and all its parts are  shoved in my closet, and my new NEW build and gift to myself,  (Gigabyte Z790 Aero G, Aero RTX 4090, in a CoolerMaster HAF700), is way cooler and COOLER!   These types of videos are EXACTLY  why I watch and trust you Jay! (And of course Steve over at @ GN) 😆
I am very unsatisfied with ASUS since my Ryzen 5 5600 build. The software is a desaster. My new board, unfortunately a Asus because of compatibility, can't even finish the updates. It just loads forever at ~25%. I hate this brand, please go to another planet and sell your boards there, so another brand can step in and fill your gap.
"so i started streaming and this happens" que asus zenbook ad 😂
My last two ASUS motherboards were bad out of the box. 🙄
the craziest thing is this shit comes with malware pre installed and other bloatwear.
Their stuff looks awesome, but i have a am4 motherboard from asus... its great, although has some smaller issues.... that i didn't expect to have when buying it for 250€...Will be my last asus product.
Thanks Jay, i was right about to build a mini itx PC with and Asus Z790-i. Not anymore, ill be sticking with my trusted MSI products.
Well shit.. I just build a new system with an Asus b760 plus mobo... Wasn't aware of all this..
I have had two of my ASUS motherboards die in the last month after updating bios!?. One is a Prime X370 mb and the other a B450 tuf plus gaming . What is going on ?. I have never had trouble before with any Asus motherboard now two dead in a month ?. One will not boot up into bios and won't clear ram nothing even with battery reset!. The other won't go into bios and show boot post of USB overload protection checked every USB port no damage only thing that was done is update bios and download load newest and drivers ?.
This is the main reason ill always be a fan of MSI, never had a single issue with any of there products
Sad to hear this news. ASUS was my favorite pc company.
From the other hand, Asus left rusia's market, as Ukrainian I very much appreciate it, but brands like MSI or Gigabyte still operate with those terrorists.
I bought a ROG Zephyrus in 2022 and the display backlight bleed is absolutely atrocious.  Asus doesn't give a poop and said I'd have to pay for service, labour, parts and shipping to even LOOK at it.   Game over my friends.
ta know i am currently building a system and was going all out on it was going to go asus but ended up going msi and boy am i glad after watching this and experiencing this with my previous board the hero i am done with asus until they show they actually care about theyre products how many times have we heard to big to fail
Good to see. I've been screaming don't buy Asus for years. I also build computers and do IT for a living and Asus has never made good on a single claim I've been involved with and they have all taken months to eventually get a, paraphrasing here, FU
Shame.  Since 2007 every build I had was based on an ASUS board.
Oh! This crap crash has been happening years from amd 3600x era with Asus motherboard until now!! My motherboard is Asus X570i My computer is still occasionally random crash even in the window login screen. Blue screen when you are watching youtube, randomly crash when playing AOE2/ LOL. (It's quite stable on Diablo 4/ American Truck, rarely crash/blue screen, maybe only 2-3times since) Updated my bios, reinstalled windows without any hardware monitor software include Armor crate/ Afterburner/ any RGB controller, except the AMD adrenaline which I need to undervolt my 5700xt Also some say you need to update your chrome about the firewall stuff. Now, after 3-4 years, my pc is much better now! I say better, not totally fixed and stable. It's still crash randomly (mainly AOE2)but a lot less. Maybe once every 2-3 days. And the blue screen reboot, it happen maybe once a week or two. I am happy with that now!!!  Do not go for AMD + Asus combo! Sorry my bad english.
been running asrock z370 extreme 4 since release and can hounastly say its never given me any shit
Good thing I ran across this.  I was about to put $2,000 down on a ASUS laptop from BestBuy.  Went back and did some reading/rating by many of the customers who have purchased that model and so many of them are having several problems with it.  Quality control is just garbage at ASUS.  Thanks for saving me headache.
Reminds me of why I will never buy from Acer again either.
I stopped buying asus products years ago...i used to use asus and abit all the time for pc builds 25 years ago. Their laptops as well.   But i bought a Rog Ally....hoping, just hoping it would make it 3 months without a problem. The LB button stopped working (crushing too many zombie heads in dead island riptide i guess😅) and their outsoursced tech support in manila were a joke. Level 1 should have been enough, but even their le el 2 were lame.   RMA'ing it this week😬😃
“Keep your [S T U F F]”
Damn. I’ve been using ASUS ever since I got into PC building/tinkering(15 ish years ago). Currently have ASUS Mobo and GPU in my rig, started getting blue screens about a year in with an error code that linked to the RAM. So I replaced the RAM, didn’t fix it. Ended up just chalking it up with Windows being Windows.  But it’s the only problem I’ve had with any of my PC’s that I haven’t solved. Weird that it’s a “newer” board(9th gen intel).   Also, haven’t been keeping up on the PC part industry. What brands are top brands now days? MSI? Looking to build a new PC in the next few months. I assume EVGA still good for PSU, Corsair & G Skill good for RAM?  Best Mobo and GPU manufacturers?(yeah, I know the GPU’s are basically just “improved” cooling/clocking)
Actual FOIA? I thought private companies/organizations were immune to the Freedom of Information Act...?
I knew it was the ASUS and I was going to comment on your other video that it was because you weren't using EVGA. Pitty they don't make AMD boards, and an even bigger disappointment that they aren't making GPUs anymore.
I hear your concerns and agree with the majority of them. Audacity ???
What do people buy then?  I heard even worse things about Gigabyte and other brands so what is left?
So I just got a Ryzen 9 7950x3D CPU and Asus Strix x670e-e is still the best recommended mobo.....Do these issues still apply and does it apply to that particular board? If it is what board should I get instead?
Get ASRock
I have build computers pretty often and MSI is far better than any I have tried. I just never have problems with their motherboards or video cards. Any others I have tried either stopped working or didn't work correctly. Asus gave the most problems and had the loudest video cards. My last build I just instantly went with all MSI. It has ran flawlessly as usual. XFX ripped me off one time by changing their warranty policy. That was the only video card I have had to just stop working. We used Gigabyte parts at work one time and had several problems with that computer. That has been my experience.
Long term Asus customer here, and I am pretty severely disappointed in the brand too.  Currently I own 3 Asus laptops, with one being a Prototype for the Rog Zephyrus Duo, with the current Duo being my dream computer. And on all 3 of my laptops I've had issues with batteries. Batteries burn out and need to be replaced and I'm just getting sick of it. Starting to shop elsewhere for my computers. Looking at alternatives.
Damn I just bought a ASUS laptop lmao
I keep buying HeySus products. Never had issues with them over the last 15+ years.  Gigabyte...that's another story.  I miss EVGA :(
Jay an advice, I am in contact with Consumer Product Safety Commission on these issues regarding GPU, melted connections and other fire related issues concerning "Fires"! I do not know if (CPSC) will do anything about this or not, that said ASUS needs to be put on notice! Maybe others should contact this government agency as well, to be determined?
Made the mistake of buying an Asus ROG Strix laptop. The motherboard shorted within a year. They refused to cover it under their warranty. Never buying Asus again.
Whaaaat? I was about to make a new build and go with ASUS. It's been many eight CPU generations since my last build.
Save your Money$ AND PICK ANY OTHER Brand.... Asus has failed as a Tech Company, after 15yrs I've decided the X670 Family is worthless and Blew up the X670XE Asus motherboard (Using heavy Explosives to make sure it was unUSABLE {Editors notes, it Melts as Fast as Being turned on} and so i've optied for MSI or Gigabyte to use PCI 5.0 with some Stability... Sad day, but I needed a system that didn't Forget my PIN more then ONCE!!!!!!!!!! I rather Build a Linux system then use ASUS....and then attach Opiniheimer as a Support Agent... more Stable than ASUS in 2023 Had I waited and not wanted Gen 5 I'd seen the Tests and Noticed your paying 700$ for a Paperweight PC... I rather give any other Motherboard the Time of Day... ASUS is DEAD forever.
I bought an ASUS x570-e a while ago. And I'm joining you in boycotting ASUS. I will never buy their products again, and I will actively discourage everyone I know from buying their products! We (as consumers) cannot allow this anti-consumer behavior to stand.
Oooooooh....*Good that it's brought up to the surface!* I got a Prime X-670E-Pro, my old MB was a Prime-X470-Pro. Now I'm Using an AMD 7900X and so far so good. No OC. As of my experience, the Prime seems to be a solid card, Not too cheap, and not Overkill with a Gazillion of features.   Also shopping for a monitor as the ASUS 49" ROG Strix XG49WCR. Now I'm not sure.  If customers are treated this badly I will rethink my monitor options.
preach
brahhh i just got an asus mobo and gc
I almost bought a B550 ASUS motherboard for a budget build until I saw this video. I'm really glad I watched it.
I've had nothing but problems with MSI motherboards (RAM slot issues, BSOD, weird bottlenecking on 4790k), but going to add ASUS to my "do not buy" list since I am looking to do a 7800x3d build.
Jay, First Awesome Video Like Always!!!  Would it be possible to send me that Asus AMD Crosshair Extreme 670E Please!?  My old x99 just crashed but I can use old case, power supply and video card and just get the other parts little by little as my budget lets me.    Thank You!   Let me know what you would need from me to make it happen.
Always respected Asus for their products, I had 2 mobos and 2 GPUs and they are working great still, 12 years. But I guess my next mobo and gpu will not be Asus, it is frustrating, but it is what it is...
Wow.  Have ASUS give every one of your followers a free FIXED motherboard and we will still support.
That really depresses me because I was thinking about building another system maybe I will not
I really haven't both computers in a a while Jesus actually I was building them above and beyond Windows your fault High the longest warranties and the most reliable products I used to be MSI and the other motherboard to missions
I would never spend 25-50% more for a brand like ASUS, MSI or EVGA, with the swift evolution of hardware, it makes more sense to buy something cheaper and replace it within a few years.  Correct me if i'm wrong, but If the specs are the same, then the difference usually comes down to the cooling on the gpu and paying more for a brand. I replace that myself or hire some cheap labor to do it for me (gotta love the labor cost in Asia).  My system is a ASRock B550M PRO4 AM4, AMD ryzen 5600G oc'ed, 32gb ddr4 3200, 512gb Adata PRO 512GB m.2 NVME, ITW 3060 RTX. What you would consider budget for 500-600 bucks.  As you can see my motherboard and cpu are the only real brands anyone has heard of, i'm not willing to compromise on my motherboard and cpu, but everything else will be replaced or upgraded in time, it's probably been 10-15 years since i last purchased anything from Asus.
ASUS have been in my bad books for many years, ever since I bought their AIO model ET2321I (an All-in-one PC).  The day after I bought it, I put a CD into the (vertical) CD tray, closed the tray and... nothing.  I opened the tray again - and the DISK WAS GONE.  unbelievably, it had fallen out of the tray inside the computer.  So I took it back to the store for service "under warranty".  They refused to do anything, claiming that it was my fault.  On the plus side, this PC is still in daily use, despite having cracks across the screen. The touch screen works fine!
Hey jay, can we get an update video?
Subscribed in support
I dumped ASUS about 6mths ago to move to ASROCK for stability
Asus never was that great, it was more hyped than anything else. Specially the GPU´s were hyped. So many other good brands around with better or equal Support, Software or Hardware.
Asus, the perfect way to destroy your brand. I will never touch any of their products again. The management of the company should be replaced without hesitation. This is honest content which is sadly lacking on the internet.
JayzTwoCents please also look at the asus notebooks where the asus crate permanently reduced the fan speed to approx. 75% and the notebooks don't perform as well as they used to, they simply overheat.It's a complete disaster FPS in games dropped by about 50%.
Agreed!
I love my Asus laptop frying itself for 5% performance boost
After the 3rd time of bad support from a company that you promote I would of left or started immediately looking for a new partner. But I I see why you tried to stick it out. I love the video and all your others keep up the hard work
Yea, it's pretty bad honestly. I also lost an asus board and toast after 2 years. Very frustrating for the cost.
I’m really shocked my motherboard was fine out of the box. I got the ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-A. The white version back at the end of January for my new build. So far running great but moving forward will stay away from this brand.
Dang should of seen this video earlier I just order an asus 790 white motherboard 3 days ago
I bought Asus stuff from early on when i started building my PCs, but i stopped a few years back when they didn't want to replace a display of my ultrabook which literally dissolved itself with hundreds of pixel errors. It was like 1 month over warranty (it happened way earlier, but because of the high dpi you didn't immediately realize it was pixel errors), but it was OBVIOUSLY a hardware issue... so i was very disappointed, having supported and also recommended them over at least 10-15 years. Never again.
Msi gang !
Sorry if they can't make it properly they need to hand to rog title to somebody who can because it is not just a name it is a symbol
My Asus computer blew up after just a few weeks of use.  Performance was slow on startup, before even installing anything. Now the battery won’t charge.  It’s terrible, and the support is equally terrible.
Damnit.  Im building a new gaming PC. Should i avoid asus mobos now ?
Wow have been looking to upgrade my gaming laptop and was looking at ASUS amount others. Glad I found this video as well as some others articles about these issues. So much for them getting my business
Thanks Jay for informing everyone about this. I was thinking of upgrading my motherboard anyways, mine is a Prime B350 motherboard, its old, its ancient by todays standards, but it came as a bundle along with a CPU & CPU cooler by AMD. I haven't upgraded any parts except for the original CPU & GPU. I was thinking of upgrading my motherboard, CPU, GPU, maybe even getting a M.2 stick as a boot drive, migrating everything else to SSD's, but haven't got the time to do so. Eventually i will do it. Can't wait to upgrade my rig. :)
i was always a asus brand lover but after this video i will really give Asrock a try for my next motherboard.
lmao my motherboard died a year ago when I was depending on it to do its job and bring food to our table. Stupid ass quality. It almost got me fired at my job as a VA. Thanks ASUS ROG
i bought a new g14. a nearly 2000$ laptop. One of the fan bearings went out within a month producing a noticeable squeel. It also arrived with dead pixels. Their response? thats standard for variance in manufacturing....
Jesus, what the fuck happened?! Asus used to be top dog in the board market. How did they fall so far and who's replaced them as top name when it comes to motherboards? MSI?
Got the ASUS tuf gaming X670E-plus, due to having used ASUS for ages. Didn't know that they had fallen from grace tbh.
..... Did a bunch of research on parts for my latest build. It's been a bit since i built a computer.... But the last several times I've built one, I've always used ASUS mother boards. It was just something I didn't need to worry about since in the past they were reliable.   My parts haven't gotten here and after watching this .... I already wish I got an MSI board.
greetings from here, I still have this old Z270-A motherboard, there has been nothing wrong with it. The next one would be someone from the 300 series. all my life I have used Asus and AsRock (cheaper Asus) motherboards. After the Msi capacitor problem, I haven't used their boards.
Okay sir we will now stop buying Asus products, right away.
God, I really hope their laptops are still ok.....because I just bought a very expensive one....... (hasn't arrived yet)
Kinda wild that I'm watching this video now having just built a computer primarily with MSI parts 3 months ago. I was an ASUS fanboy for years. Never had a problem. Nothing failed early or anything like that. I even had a good customer experience with getting one of their monitors fixed while still under warrantee (aside from FedEx damaging it in shipment twice).  My very first computer I built used a MSI mobo (circa 2004) so I knew they were good. Funny how things go I guess.
Dang I just built a pc with a Z790 and I’ve been fighting my wireless adaptor disconnecting randomly.. guess this might be my problem.
that edit for " it's hard to tell them keep your /stuff/ was pretty funny lol"
Damn
WOW this sucks cause I was wanting to make a mega ROG build with there case motherboard and a 4090 gpu.  Know I’m not sure what to do 😢
I bought their top of the line board years ago, it was DOA.  They warranteed it but in a short amount of time stop supporting the board....but kept promising for new bios and updates on all the forums etc. Maximus IV Extreme. The bluetooth and iROG never worked well and so never again Asus!!.  Meanwhile Abit was still helping me with a board, NF7, about 10 yrs after it was no longer being made.
i beg to differ...   i just built my rig last week, Friday, using a am5 asus b650e-f board...   the thing's a beast and i couldn't be happier with asus...  i used armory crate app to install the drivers and boom, perfection....  when i saw the title to this video, it kinda threw me for a loop...
I purchased a top end ROG Strix g16 in 2021. It was having some problems staying on. Got it checked. Turns out the motherboard is not working. Now the support is telling me to replace the mb. Worst purchase of my life. Not at all worth it.
I wish I had not been 3 months late seeing this video. It would have changed my mind on dealing with an Asus product period. I purchased a ROG gaming router and had an issue with the routers software, I contacted Asus' support. Jay is absolutely correct about their support being a joke. Every time I called or emailed about the routers software issue, they wouldn't even get the issue I was having correct. I kept getting the line, "You will be contacted by higher tier support within 24-28 hours". I was NEVER contacted by 'Higher Tier' support. Just stuck with the form readers in India that never helped me. So, never again will I buy another Asus product!
Wow I am so close to making a few ASUS purchases. I am now reconsidering after this video.
This seems to be a trend with big names in the PC industry. Nvidia, Razer, and now ASUS. Looking an awful lot like any future upgrades will be MSI.
Am I safe to assume that if I haven't had any problems with my ASUS Z590-P + Intel I5 11600k setup that it shouldn't be a problem in the near future? I assume the majority of the issues are regarding the boards he had on display during this video and maybe specifically with AMD CPUs.
6:37  the "Frick" gets me everytime😂
Wish i would have seen this before buying my asus b650- A gaming
Wow. I have a Asus z760 and z790 pro art in my carts to purchase for myself as a upgrade to my new build and my daughters first build for game and streaming.
press f to pay respects
Watching this feeling conflicted about buying there 200+ aio
So I missed out on watching this video when it was released. But this probably explains why the Asus tuf z590 that I bought last year didn’t work right and had to send back twice. And my newest build with an Asus Rog strix z590 has been crashing and locking up since I built it back it February 2023. I new I should have bought Gigabyte motherboard I wanted to start with. Nice video good job
Asus has been garbage with their phones and tablets long long time ago. Why did you even deal with them?
that explains my problems. Been buying asus for Quite a while now. My most recent gaming laptop burned out due to a recall issue, which never happened at all, and it took then months to replace the motherboard.
Well done jay well done!!!!!!
I’ve been an IT professional for 30 years, even owning a PC Networking and repair company in the late 90s…and Asus is the worst company I’ve ever delt with. I made the mistake of buying the Asus ProArt PA90 in September of 2020 and got nine months before the insanity began. I identified an issue with the BIOS not opening the cooling lid fully after it opened a few dozen times without powering down. My mistake was attempting to be a good guy and let them know of the issue, even though I could work around it.   The rep had me run the default setting in the BIOS. I knew that wouldn’t fix it, but had no idea that the BIOS defaults would stop the lid opening to its full position when hitting higher temps forever. So now it had to be shipped to the ONE repair shop in the entire US. Turns out they were grossly incompetent and had no idea how this machine is supposed to operate. 4 months later, and untold battles with these morons, and ASUS finally sent me a new machine.   I got from August of 2021 to August of 2023 with the new machine (maybe 1,000 hours) before the video died. Not the Quadro card…but I’m guessing something on the board. Thank god I setup remote access so I could log into it. So now I have a $3,500 paper weight cuz I can’t depend on it, and I’m not sending it to the incompetent repair shop.  Moral: NEVER BUY ASUS!
I’ve purchased two Asus laptops and both were shitty out of the box and Asus would not honor their warranty and ducked and dodged making things right. Never purchasing a single Asus product again!
I was with SteelSeries mouse keyboard headphone set, and I switched to ROG cause I loved the keyboard falchion, but damn their software is the worst shit I have ever worked with. Damn i regret...
Sounds like the corporate world strikes again... they seem to do a certain thing after they've been around and developed to a point, gotten a good name and product - they tend to start valuing things a bit differently - if you look you can see all kinds of corporations doing it - especially now, haha...  Clearly, quality and customer satisfaction have been replaced by the name.  I really hope I didn't waste my money here.  ...it's not exclusive to any particular type of company, either... Asus, I have used for so long... and I sincerely hope the stuff I ordered is all in working order when I test it, I know the things to *expect* but I was going to go with MSI - except I used them many years ago and the product I got... wasn't great quality, so of the in-stock options I chose Asus, since I will already be using a part of two of their make in the new build, which I already owned.  Sure hope they don't just cut and run, because I remember some tech brands in the past that were great, and then decided to disembowel themselves, so... this would be a tragedy, if I end up getting something defective or some RMA damaged crap, heh....
ASUS has never cared about quality nor support. I don't know how they fostered such a reputation, because I had an old board (Core E6400, Nvidia chipset iirc) that would be horrifically unstable out of the box; I RMAd it 3 times, never solved it, kept claiming it was some other component. 6 months later they quietly released a BIOS that fixed my exact issue. I've avoided them ever since and been quite happy.
so this ASUS Z790-A ROG Strix Gaming WIFI Intel LGA 1700 ATX Motherboard no good?
MSI and Intel for the win 💪
I understand and support you completely. This behavior by Asus is unacceptable. Thank you for informing everyone about this!
I mean I’ve never had a problem really and have used last few gens of hero boards. Came across this after buying a asus 4090 so we will see. But at same time hearing about Problems with free boards etc kinda makes it hard for me to feel bad when it even came down to them sending the wrong color 🤣 I usually just buy via Amazon these days so just instant return no questions ask if anything is off with it when I receive it but I still would trust them more than msi or possibly gigabyte still imo
Thank you for sharing this.  It's about time I change things up a bit too by trying a different brand - glad I saw this as I'm just starting on my next build.    I'm having a similar issue with Samsung and their support... or lack thereof.  Their marketing has outpaced their quality.
Wait what? I always thought ASRock were decent. Bit basic, but otherwise stable. What did I miss?
I just dumped 2k into a new build, updating my 8 year old setup, was basically Asus... Went MSI this time mobo and graphics card.  Have had noooo problems.  I'm now sure of my purchases, after watching this video.
I've had nothing but problems with ASUS. I tell everyone that they are the worst company, and people unfortunately always assume that they are amazing. Don't get me started on Armoury Crate (it took them three years to update it enough to be able to actually uninstall properly. If it went bad, which was often, you would have to format the hard drive and reinsall windows to fix it). I have had nothing but issues, random network problems (took years to fix), no support, and they would always blame some other component when contacting support. ASUS is absolute shit.
Driving back from best buy after purchasing asus G18 while listening to this.  I will return this faster than you can say bios.
I have a Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite AX with a Ryzen 9 7950X CPU, and it has been rock solid since December from an OS perspective.  It was new and I couldn't install the OS without flashing the BIOS first as it didn't pick up the SSD.  The onboard Realtek WiFi 6E had connectivity issues as well that I have been working thru but that seems to be a common issue with this wifi chip.  Suddenly after August patching the system seemed unstable like wifi not working reliably, so I reflashed the bios and removed the patch (which got reinstalled shortly after), and then I got the system stable again but I got an external wifi adapter as well to test.  Then yesterday, I got like 3 or 4 bluescreens in a row so I wondered what the hell is going on.  After that group of bluescreens, I got it up and saw that I only had 16 GB of memory vs 32 GB installed so I figured it's the ram (Kingston Fury Beast) so I removed the ram and reinstalled it swapping positions, and since yesterday it's been stable now.  My son's x58 system (w3950) is like 12 years old and I think I've had to reseat the 6x8GB dimms (48 GB RAM) maybe twice for something similar.  I'm surprised that this system didn't go a year before having to reseat the ram.
I literally have the exact build Jay mentioned. 7950x crosshair hero 4090 etc.. I have had the exact same problems he was having..every..single..one. I tried everything, you name it and to this day still have some of those same problems randomly. Now we all know the truth. "We're getting AMD'd right now, and by AMD'd..really ASUS'd" - JayzTwoCents
Just bought MCI!
I’ve never purchased anything from Asus always wanted to but thanks to this video I never will. Own and run gigabyte mobos 3 in the last 6 years in 3 different builds and not a single issue not one so easy basically just plug and play love gigabyte.
Dear Jay you are beyond delusional, we will still buy asus cos it is supreme and u know it.
I have noticed in the last couple years that companies, not just ASUS, are hyper-apologetic instead of actually concerned about fixing the issue.  This appeasement-culture is way over the top and I pray it stops. Asus is just one example of so many quality companies that have raced to the bottom; so much so the minute I hear and apology I now say somewhat aggressively "Stop apologizing and fix the problem, your apology does nothing for me other than to exacerbate the problem!!   If ALL of us start taking this approach "maybe?" it will make a difference (or not)
I'm looking for a gaming laptop en the Asus rog strix was high on my list, even though I heard about qc issues and coilwhine, which asus said its normal yet no other brand has it. This is the final drop, if they cannot give a known tech reviewer decent support, how the hell am I going to get support
OMG !!
I have asrock, never had a problem... meanwhile back in the day i had 3 asus motherboard RMA
meh, you could just re-align pins with a needle yourself
I'm ROG STRIX X470-F guy.... 🥲  so the problems with rgb sync, fans, sound and ram were not me?
Watching your video to end... I need to address I was kinda early adopter for amd 😁I got x370 gigabyte board and 1700x.then 3800x on same board, and I also have x570 gigabyte and 5800x... Gigabyte board is crap, it's a disaster and I got all of these issues with nvme and USB and restart and alllll.. So it's part gigabyte crap and part AMD crap.
By the way, my 6700u zenbook sucks ass... And I was screwed by Asus to buy it
Giga byte is worse... I think we must go after asrock and msi
Keep your “stuff” 😂 riiight, y’all thought you was slick with that edit? 🤣 Nah fam.
im glad i saw this, we bought me an Asus gaming computer today, but tomorrow were going to get our money back and go into Currys and get a better one. Thank you so much for letting us know how bad these computers are.
💯
I watched this the day after I purchased ROG Strix Z690-F.  Nothing but trouble, weak manual and the Bluetooth signal is intermittent.  I'll live with it until they fix the bug or perhaps this is an unrelated issue.  BTW there is only one 19/20 pin header on this MB (???). I usually replace my system every 3-5 years so these really are a God send for me. Love the content, keep it coming.
I've always been a big fan of ASUS products since I started building my own rigs over 20 years ago. But... Software and support have always been their Achilles Heel. I stopped using their graphics cards ages ago, as they would only update drivers at (long) sporadic intervals, whereas nVidia drivers were coming out frequently and reliably.  So, in order to keep up with the graphisc engine I would have to disable a lot of the proprietary ASUS software that came with the cards.  Just got a refurbished ASUS laptop (2021 model) and I can only hope it will last.  I'm already pretty disappointed at the state of their BIOS, it appears to be the "Special Ed" edition with pretty much NO adjustments the consumer can make. It's a ROG Zephyrus S17 (GX703HS), and there isn't even an option for performing a BIOS RAID setup, on a laptop which claims a 3TB SSD which is, in reality, three 1TB NvMe strips which aren't even RAID configured. Yes, I know Win 10 will let me configure a Software RAID, but my research has uncovered the fact that it's a less efficient setup that leaves a lot of storage unusable. Very sad that they've slipped this far. MSI, eh?
It’s a weird year when buying a mobo I felt most comfortable with gigabyte😂
👍👍👍👍👏👏
Asrock .   Is the best quality at the moment
Good brainwash you do here. Pity tactics in the current era. You call Asus shit because you want to replace their brand with yourself. I'm an asus customer since ages and have no problem with their quality.
I realize you are supposed to be a professional.. I’ve always supported you as a creator.. I also realize you are trying to be ahead of the newest and greatest..   how do you NOT know that the x3D processors are not supposed to be overclocked?? And that beta programs/bios/etc are not to be used by the masses until it is fully released by the manufacturer, because it could POSSIBLY void the warranty??   I’ll agree the broken products and them not taking care of you warranty wise is absolutely crap.. but you should know better..
Thanks Jay, I am so thankful for this info! I will  never buy an A monitor or anything!
Sorrow Jay, you‘re unsubscribed. You are completely wrong. Bye bud! Stutter on!
I was just browsing for the Crosshair X670 models and found this.  Had no idea Asus was going down hill in quality.  For like decades they have been my rock solid brand with zero quality problems.  I’ve owned generations of ROG Maximus and Crosshairs without a hitch. That’s quite worrisome.
I loved the design of the 14 inch ROG Zephyrus laptop, so I bought it for college last year. I AM ON MY THIRD LAPTOP FROM THEM. The first one crapped out after 3 months, with only what I can pressume was a GPU issue, it would crash with a green screen and artifacts at the top of the screen. The second one crapped out after about a month, the thing would only boot to a black screen, the power light turned on, but not the screen. So far the third is ok, but every once in a while the wifi freezes. Moral of the story, I'm not buying from ASUS EVER AGAIN.
When my screen died literaly 30 days after my warrantee ended on my ASUS ROG Phone 5, I no longer buy ANYTHING from ASUS or ROG. I lost out on $1,200 for the phone and $800 worth of accessories straight down the toilet. Still makes me angry looking back.
Asrock has been better than ASUS for a long time.
damn just as I bought an asus laptop all hell broke loose xD
wish i'd seen this before i upgraded. i managed to get on latest bios, and still can't get expo working
asus update on this suggesting the memory controller is to blame if you’re stressing it with more than 32GB and blasing fast speeds and 4x sticks.   if you’re having these issues try 2 sticks with lesser expo option, or 4 without expo
It’s hilarious everyone loves asus. Everything he’s saying about bent pins and what not has been going on for almost 2 decades. I have tried to use asus mb when doing system builds at my previous job I was at for 12 years. We ALWAYS had problems with quality control. RMA with them is a joke. Every board we sent back took at minimum of 2-3 send backs to get a correct / fix product. We had so many problems with them just reboxing the board we sent to them back to us untouched completely. Their customer service fking sucks. I abandoned their crap years ago and never looked back. It’s beyond me all these complete idiots that spend big bucks on these motherboards when a cheaper brand works better and offers a better experience. Thank you for making this video and moving away from them.
I have had a terrible experience with Asus RMA as well. I had an Asus monitor that developed some black spots followed by vertical lines all on its own. upon taking it to RMA, they told me that it had suffered damage. Now considering that the monitor sits on a desk and the black spots developed at the bottom of the screen, which is the least damage prone area, I wonder how in the world did they come to the conclusion of physical damage. They refused to replace the monitor, even though it was under warranty.
I was wondering if it was just me being unlucky, cuz pretty much all components I've used over the years that died on me were not Gigabyte, nor Sapphire or other brands I kinda learned to trust. Nah, it was always Asus... How strange.
Why have you not cut off NZXT? Their customer support is horrid. They lied about the H1 issue and denied many early adopters like me the updated pci-e riser or a full refund.
I've been out of the pc part world loop for a bit and am now upgrading, almost bought asus mobo but then I saw this video, time to start looking at asrock, I had already ordered strix 4090 but not paid yet so i was worried should I cancel the order but then you said that the gpu side is okay so phew, I can go get my 4090 tomorrow
with the summer period I missed a lot of video and info. Your video made me realize all the problems I was having with my asus motherboards especially with the ddr...  I know that your video is 3 months old and that you'll probably never see my comment, but I wanted to thank you for opening my eyes to these problems that I hadn't seen despite my 30 years of experience.  bye bye Asus and once again thank you so much for this video
Just recently got my "new" Asus ROG Zenith II Alpha,  and it came in an opened box, a thin peice of antistatic film bag on the back that would have had a component in it, and the wrong user manual.  I haven't been able to test it as I am still waiting for my AIO. But for over 2k the damned thing better work.
Gigabyte or MSI?
so im was going to buy a asus z790 do you think this is still a good idea
Funny.. i had evga mobo for over a decade... Switched to asus for the last 2 builds and now with my 13900k, got gigabyte because i felt like asus was lacking with z790
They truly go out of their way to be sure that they don't repair anything unless you're willing to pay them money to do it. I've had this experience with them twice. It doesn't matter if it's under warranty or not. I had a chip in one of my fan blades on a gpu that was under warranty, and it stopped functioning.  I sent it in via rma and was emailed saying that it was damaged due to the chip in a fan blade and that they would repair it for 400.00. I've also had weird issues with my Rog x570E board as well. It just sometimes doesn't want to post. Then, 30 minutes goes by, and I try again, and it functions fine. I've been a hard-core asus guy for years but it's time to move on to something different whenever I do decide to upgrade my pc's. I haven't had any issues as of yet with their Tuf line of components. The Rog 3090 has been great. The Tuf 4070ti  has been great. My son is running my strix 2080ti, and its been great as well.
Wow, I was about to wait and buy the next Asus all and laptop when the 7800m xt actually hits. But I guess that's out the window for me now.
Jayz ! Say it ain't so ! Asus ? Aww hell naww !
ASUS went from "the brand you can´t go wrong with" to a no-go.
I got broken socket on Asus in 2010 and they said I broke it! So it has happened before.
I want to know what motherboards would you proudly endorse? My wife’s is having trouble and asus was my go to but after seeing all this it’s gonna change
Never trusted Asus... Always built my pc with MSI parts.
Well, if they want me to “go away as a customer,” that’s exactly what I’ll do. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Add their ROG Strix SSD enclosures as being worthless to the extreme. Total pieces of trash.
oof. This is what happens when i stop watching JTC. I JUST bought some new parts, all ASUS. Big oof. Funny enough, i did have some issues setting up my build with my mobo. Luckily, i got it to work without updating BIOS. Guess i wont update it at all now. Guess i should save up again and get a different mobo asap.
damn i wish i knew this before i built a 4090/7950X3D setup on an Asus B650E mobo...
thats a big L for ASUS... I havent heard of all this bullshit that has been going on and I bought a TUF monitor... and it fucking flickers and turns black for 3-7 seconds randomly... very nice ingame
So it looks like msi is the only decent motherboard. I will not buy gigabyte for anything same thing from them. So is ASRock safe from this since its their parent company? My taiichi board is great, but i absolutely hate polychrome lol other than that this board is great.
Thanks!
Has Asus gotten back to you on this QA issue?
In 2019 I bought a mid-range gaming laptop for about $970. (Intel-i7 9th gen and a GTX 1650) Being the ignorant teenager I was, I didn't get the 2+ year warranty and instead opted for the three month free one.  Six months later my fan has become noticeably louder and my cpu and gpu is nice and toasty.  I did some research and it turns out that the model I got had a severe manufacturing defect that cause the fans to grind on the bottom of the case.  This wasn't just my laptop.  Tens of thousands of these laptops were defective and ASUS didn't even attempt to notify me.  As you can guess, they refused to give me a refund or replacement because my warranty expired.  I just can't believe they didn't do a total recall of these faulty laptops.  Disgusting.
I think Jay is 100% right about Asus using the brand image they've built in the past to cut corners and stop caring about their customers.  I had ongoing problems with my last (Asus) motherboard, so I bought a different brand this time.  What Asus did by telling customers to download a firmware fix, not knowing they would void their warranty, is *extremely* shady and should be illegal!  This video is exactly the kind of thing we need to know about.  Asus had better get their sh*t together fast because brand reputations can change faster than they think, and I won't be buying anymore Asus products until I'm convinced their support system has been fixed.
I remember in the late 90's ASUS products were ELITE and the best of the best. Now, it seems they fell off a cliff and destroyed their brand. What a idiot I feel like since I just bought a new mobo and new 4090 branded ASUS. Boy I messed up.
Another reason I should've bought a steam deck instead. First, I buy am ROG Ally and then the steam summer sale makes the steamdeck much cheaper, now I learn too late about their issues here. Ugh.
I had an issue that was fixed by other brands and they pulled the "not on the qvl" line on me to avoid fixing the issue. That lost my confidence in their customer support. But I thought if I stick to QVL then it'll be good. Seems this video shows that's wrong. ASUS becoming the new ASRock.
Was about to buy a ASUS Motherboard for new build - guess now I will look somewhere else.
Funny they still haven't resolved the capacitor problem.. I had a high end MB in 2000.. they rejected my RMA.. It's not about a mistake.. just take care of your customers when you f up.. never bought an Asus product since.. same goes for Dell! Great decision!
What a powerful message, wow. This is bigger than just Asus. Brands getting so complacent that they lose ground.  Is this critique also valid for Asus game laptops? Unfortunately there are not many laptops containing AMD 7945HX. So I was considering  Strix Scar 17 but this video gets me doubting... 😢
I learned the hard way when I built my first PC six months ago and still do not have a working machine
Imagine releasing a product to the PC market where VOLTAGE REGULATION is in beta.
Wait hold on, Jay has fart sounds and other immature effects on his streams!? I might have to check him out next time he's streaming
ASUS please do not budge; you don't need to. We do care. Some of your work on youtube taught me few things; I learnt from you. No offence, one batch or span of defective product does not dominate the history. You are firing Asus; I mean sorry you don't own the company (and it's not an employee you can fire); at least have the curtsey to say "I am done with Asus", "I don't want to work Asus again". That line is a click bait, and you know it. Will skip your videos if things dont change. My oldest Asus board  was released in 2003.. still is running today. I still use ASUS. Even my phone is an ASUS Rog. Never buying anything if Asus has a competitive offering. The battery is still a legend there. You are looking at cutting edge top of the line stuff as an example. Lets be honest shit happens. I like ASUS because they just design with sense and care for the end user. Yet to see a product range from them which dies on people. Sony, Phillips, Asus, Sonodyne, (Mac G3 & G4) etc... those are solid manufacturers. I have had expensive stuff die out of no where, but products from these brands are still working. The Sony Trinitron set my late Grandfather (love you) used later in his life is still working; no speaker issue or degraded image. It has gone through 0 issues 40+ years. So if you dont like a brand fine, dont take their sponsorship. It's unfair to give them a bad name without verification of the point of fault. They have a longer history that the last year or so. Specially the ASUS board designers generally have very sound design and implementation. So bent pins (manufacturer, quality, packaging, post factory handling, packaging material) anything there can ideally cause it. Just because ASUS does not fit in your workflow don't work with them, you don't need to. Proof must be present across the range / batch to share something online so serious.
I am a owner of Asus rog strix g laptop. I was influenced by the streamers who were using asus products but it was my huge mistake and i still regret it. Within purchasing in 1 month they gave some bios update which prevents undervolting this laptop burns to almost 100c. Few months later other parts started to fail. Some years back devices built to last decade but now they are making products serve warranty period or deliver some bad updates to make device dead.
I got asrock board on sale and was waiting for the issues, but I found what you did. AsRock solid. It's AMD build too and it ran well when I got it. Runs well today. No issues.
I was thinking of getting a strix g15, but theres so many videos popping up in my feed saying asus isnt good I'm reconsidering my choices
Ooooffff Why are Budget brands better nowadays 🤣
I've only ever used MSI since 2006, when I built my first system, never had a problem with them, besides when I pushed my luck and put a i9 9900k in a cheap MSI motherboard I ripped outta a prebuilt lol, Ill always stand by their Motherboards
Unfortunately, most of my build is ASUS, including the monitor. I purchased the ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-E from Newegg and paid the extra for a NEW part just to receive a used board that was DoA. Box was beat up, ESD bag scratched/holey/torn; Accessories missing and the cherry on top PASTE IN THE CPU PINHOLES! Many spots that looked like someone stabbed it with a screwdriver including the GPU release. Snapped off buttons on the I/O board. I tried to get a replacement and it boiled down to "You'll just have to buy a different board" because they apparently don't have new ones.
i thought i had a virus on my asus laptop. so i factory reset it multiple times and the temps were still insane. like 80c on idle, pushing 100c while gaming. i had just cleaned the fans recently also. so i thought it was a motherboard virus and took it to a repairman and he said there was no virus on it. so i was stumped and redownloaded all the software and temps were still outrageous. so finally i factory reset it for the last time and decided not to download ANY software. temps were normal on idle. so i thought and thought and before the only software i had downloaded was the ASUS ARMOURY CRATE. so i thought no no no, that cant be it, thats their own software that cant be the problem. so i downloaded it again to control my fans. BOOM temps shoot up like 30C on idle. even with fans up near 100% the temps were still near 80c on idle. i coulndt believe it. so factory reset it, DELETED ANYTHING TO DO WITH ARMOURY CRATE, and since then temps have been as good as they get for a laptop. now my temps are about 30c less and the fan doesnt sound even near 100%. so for a fact asus armoury crate is malignant software that ironically you download to control your fans, that makes your system heat up so much, that you need to turn up your fans. i have seen a handful of other people say they had other problems with armoury crate, and ive been posting this everywhere i can, hopefully to save someone from using armoury crate, or an asus product ever again.
idk who to trust for a motherboard anymore. MSI stuff has always failed on me, ASUS are terrible now, motherboards are so pricey that I'm hesitant trying new stuff. I might have to cave and return to MSI, let's hope they stepped up their game.
*looks at the box in his video, then back at my 4 days old TUF Gaming B650 plus WIFI* Well... fuck.
ASUS can go ahead and digress :)
This is sad. I've always had good luck with Asus. But you're right, their customer service is garbage.
thx for the video. I feel like all you said is whole new level of truth. Like 3 months ago, my motherboard and GPU diceded to die and I was kinda forced (friday morning + long weekend) to buy both of them from ASUS and ever since I have isues with stability of my PC when I am overclocking something. Like I can't even have my RAM's set to 3600MHz (or 3200 on old ones) without getiing issues and I am forced to have them set on 2133MHz to work properly. All that ASUS support said is that my old RAM sticks are not compatible with MB (even tho they are on list on their website...) Anyways once again thx for video and have a nice day/night
Gigabyte are the same.
Asus really fucked me over recently. I bought a new 3090TI from them, paid msrp, owned the card for roughly 8 months and it died. They sent me a used one that had scratches and sharpie all over it. I eventually got ahold of the ceo office and after threatening a lawsuit and they agreed to send me a new one. I appreciate they accepted but it wasn’t fair to pay MSRP for a used card.
Been using AsRock B550M Steel Legend as a jump from MSI. 💪
You did Steve dirty on the choice of pic haha
I bought a Crosshair hero 7. Every other time I tried to set a fan curve, the system would turn off. Memory issues as well. Finally upgraded and won't buy Asus again.
Thank  you for putting this out. I had no idea this was going on...rl stuff has lead me away from builds lately. Historically, I've loved ASUS and was even sponsored by them as a pro gamer and later as a sponsor of a major gaming event. It's sad to see they've lost their way like so many companies of late due to focusing on things that don't matter like social issues instead of their products.   Perhaps you could make a video ranking manufacturers on their products and warranties so that we can get an idea of who we can trust as consumers. During covid when product wasn't available except through OEMs, I ended getting an Alienware R9 with a 2080TI that sounds like a jet plane taking off in my room, on and off every 4 seconds, that I have difficulty hearing games while wearing noise cancelling headphones! You'd laugh if you had it in your studio today and tested it. You simply wouldn't believe a company would ship a product out like this.
I bought the ASUS Rog Maximus X Hero, the software borders on malware, and the support is non-existent... Not buying ASUS again...
ASUS 18" LAPTOPS ARE JUST CRAP
This sounds more like AMD issues than Asus to me.  At least your personal rig.  That is exactly the problem that plagued Bulldozer gen.  It's their drivers being absolute shit.  My Asus intel systems all run perfectly fine.  I have never had to RMA a product though so I understand people jumping ship if its as bad as they say.
So who do we buy without Asus? I've already written off MSI and Gigabyte.  MSI treated me bad a decade ago so I don't buy them. Asus support is a total joke. I want to buy from someone else but we don't seem to have any options.
I would have bought an Asus if not for Steve. Got an MSI Aegis.
I have been in computers since the later part of the 1970's, I live in an RV with a small dog , 17 laptops, four going on five very big (Antec 1200 & Cooler Master Cosmos II PCs) - most on LINUX, just a few on Win 10 for tools I can't get on LINUX (Very few but there are some). I am self taught in both building PCs and programming in many languages, most not used by me any longer. I am 72 years young and I watch as many of your videos as I can every day, we both have similar experiences but I am not a gamer, Mahjong and Solitaire are my exceptions. I live in central Florida in an RV community with many very old people, I support and maintain most if not all the PCs in the park. I mainly build Gigabyte MBs with AMD processors, most of my laptops are Intel. I do have other hobbies as well involving collections of Movies - 1500+, TV shows120+, Audio books 2500+, MP3 & WAV Music 120,000+, none PC stuff include Swords and Guns, most of which I can't even pick up anymore, but if war ever comes to my area I can hand out war tools to a lot of younger people, I pray it never happens in my lifetime. My best wishes to you and yours and thanks for all the wonderful videos...
So, I bought a new ASUS ROG M15 in 2020, and honestly not thrilled, since I had to replace the fans about a year after I got it, just out of warranty.  And after swapping them, I'm still having issues today with it shutting off/restarting randomly.  It's a shame, I loved my 2013 G750.
About time Asus gets called out. Their Rog laptop lineup this year has atrocious quality control
Love you daddy
I fried two of their 3080 rog strix gpus and then after that my aio stopped working with the mobo switching to gigabyte for my third build because I’m out 2 gpus and a mobo
funny about this video i have a asus mb and my bios made my pc go ape shit like blue screened 8 times in a row and then the pc just stopped working all together had to update the bios for it to work normally
I have been an Asus router user for 17 years, since b, g, n, AC and now owning their AX routers, their routers have never been failed for me and very reliable, however, my recent AX6000 failed and had intermittent internet via both cable and wifi 6, was super super disappointed with their support, so slow and non responsive even though I stated that both of us are working from home and rely on stable internet. Maybe it's time to get away from Asus seriously because their quality went downhill recently! remember their gear is not cheap at all. Now when it comes to motherboard, I will rethink hard again before I choose Asus boards. (I still do have a 15 years Asus mainboard running PC right now).
Is it okay to skip BIOS versions and go straight to the newest one?
oh yeah...my dongle has been going on and off for 2 years now and I've tried for many times on how to fix it but gave up... so I guess this is why...
My Asus has been going string for the past 3yrs…nonetheless, what other brand should I look for for my next build?
ASUS Prime Z690-A,  mouse kept powering off, mic blowing out, settings not being saved, lights turning themselves on, streamlabs crashing. I could not find the problem.... this makes sense
Thanks for fighting for the consumer!
Currently sitting here eyeing my Asus 3060Ti.  Glad their card business isn't complete Alienware yet...
Its okay, linus media group are happy enough to stay in the gutter with these companies due to their shady ethics.
What you guys are doing is absolutly what we consumers need,  thank you.
Have had the worst customer service experience with asus over 2 months nows and the level of customer care is non existence
When ASUS was releasing the 2022 ROG Zephyrus Duo 16, I did a pre-order from B&H Video.  I paid 5,000 dollars for the PC.  I knew it was going to be super expensive, but i thought it would be great having a powerful gaming laptop.  As soon as I got the PC, I turned it on and it couldn't load Windows.  It said it couldn't find the Hard Drive.  Spoke with ASUS Rep and told me that I had to send it in for repairs.  I told them I waited for months for this PC and I wanted a replacement.  They wouldn't do it for me since I didn't buy it from them directly.  I decided to return the product and never going with ASUS again.  I had better support with HP OMEN team.  Now, I'm going to be working on a custom Desktop PC.
What specs would a tip-top end of line last gen pc be (amd 4 slot) Glad you posted this before I buy the asus 570 mobo I was looking at!
Their products are straight Garbage. Most of the devices we repair are asus brand especially laptops. What df is wrong with their quality. Come on Asus step up your game.
Michigan here... crazy news about Asus... I have used their mb for over 10 years in both intel and amd formfactors.. In the last year I have picked up 3 ROG Strix boards the most recent being for my 5800x3d and no problems as far as I know... My son is ready to move on from his 10900k and is going to the 7800x3d. He said he won't do Asus, not knowing why I watched some videos on what he said was going on with them... After watching a view videos on the issue it is apparent that Asus is drinking Bud Light.  Sad indeed. What a shame.
I'm gonna be blunt but only an idiot risks installing a Beta BIOS on their motherboard. Generally, do not update the BIOS unless there is a valid need/reason to do so. Tip for RMAs: Take muiltiple clear photos of the item you are returning, not only capturing the issue clearly but the entire product at all applicable angles/sides.
Yup, I got a damaged z490 with bent pins and dealt with the condescending  emails for months until i was fed up trying to get my money back. Never again
BTW - many thanks for the warnings, new Gaming Rig comes now with MSI Mainboard and PWU instead of 20 years of ASUS.
Used your videos to build my first pc this weekend, love the channel.   Mega Man box in the background is all I can think of.
You saved me some trouble Mate I'm about to build a new Pc and have used asus in most of my builds for years, now i wont thanks
Since 2011 I stopped buying ASUS because of its low duration and suddenly death. Better GIGABYTE, MSI, AsRock, those are high durable and also high quality components. Don't trust ASUS
Which brand would you recommend? I'm thinking about putting together a PC in the coming months.
Hi, I bought and am typing this on an ASUS Prime Z690 P Wifi I built Dec 22. It's now August 23 and I'm having Intermittent but more often recurring POST issues. PC is up right now obviously but only after several tries of.....  1. Press Power On. 2 The system fans etc come on, the power up LED blinks about 10 times then it shuts off. 3. Try again, same thing, same thing, same thing. 4. Pull the power cable, wait 5 minutes. 5. Try again, same thing, same, same thing...then....Dough, it finally stays on and boots to BIOS warning about stability issues and forcing into BIOS for a reset or exit without changing.   Note My BIOS is already at Default Optimize (Slowest memory settings, no XMP etc, I was never able to use XMP profile to boost memory speed, it would BSD).  If I turn this computer off I don't know if it will boot again. It's become more likely not to POST than to complete the boot. And nothing was changed. This 8 month-old PC that has been working great up to now, as long as I didn't use XMP, which proved unstable, all parts brand new except some old secondary drives I had from my old computer.  I'm thinking some sort of capacitors are burning out already. What do you think?   Note: The ASUS HERO board was recalled due to some reversal of the chip installs that were burning up some capacitor causing the same no post/boot. I'm wondering if something similar OR just cheap parts have caused this. I'm really upset I have a lot of time/$ into this computer build and for a few months down the road the motherboard to burn me like this is frustrating.
Is the 5800x3d susceptible to overvoltage in a b550mk prime motherboard?
Asus is garbage and so is their customer service. I purchased a ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 17 8 months ago.  They have had it the better part of the last 5 months.  Sent back to me unrepaired.  I had to send it back to them again.  And as of two days ago I finally got my replacement.  And yup its defective physically out of the box.  Their customer service is an absolute joke.  I never would have imagined spending $3700 for a laptop with this bad of customer service.  Never again.
When I built my current rig during the pandemic, I had to RMA 2x intel i9-11900Ks and 3x ASUS Hero XIII Maximus boards, and when I finally got stable components, I still can't overclock the CPU or it bluescreens. Looking at finally building my 13900K build and am heavily considering moving my board to another company. Which is sad, because I already have to get a new GPU company since EVGA isn't making video cards with NVIDIA's shenanigans.
Hello, it's the first time I'm writing to your channel. First of all, I congratulate you for what you do. I'm appealing to your experience and to those who are reading, please. I bought an Asus Rog Flow X13 gaming laptop, I've read about the topic of voltage, and truth be told, I'm paranoid to know if it can harm my system or not. Everything is updated to the latest version of BIOS, Nvidia graphics card, AMD graphics card, and all drivers in general. So far, everything is working perfectly, except I notice that the battery doesn't last very long. And some strange screen flickers that went away when I turned off hardware acceleration in the BRAVE browser. In summary, have you done any reviews or do you have any advice about the X13, please? Thank you very much! Mariano
The last 5 builds ive owned have been asus board and gpu combo. I have decided to go elsewhere also
This reminds Apple of denying battery problems with Ipads to force people to upgrade. Happy someone has taken a stand and actually Asus we will not be using your products. Have dripped Asus and Gigabyte for poorly designed boards being overpriced. More people should do that instead of being brand crazy there are alot of choices out there.
I purchased only 1 Asus product a smartphone. And it bricked in warranty period. So no more Asus for me.
Never, never, and never, no matter how long eternity, I'm going to let an ASUS product into the house. If I want stability there is Gigabyte, if I want a little more features, there is MSI, but never ASUS. And I have not had any problems with ASUS simply because I have never bought anything from them, it has been enough for me to see many of the products that my friends have bought them. If you want a PC that will inevitably break, Asus if you want a computer for years, Gigabyte or MSI.
Today, 8/10/2023, I got an e-mail from ASUS support of a Motherboard which I RMA'd a long time ago was on it's way. The original RMA was denied &, my warranty voided. This is a ROG Strix x570e Gaming wifi. This model was plagued with power surges HDD burnups & power supplies shorting out.  It was so bad, NewEgg took down all negative reviews with any mention of powre surges &, over voltages.   Are there any more of you getting new boards after having your warranties voided?
Are there any issues with their laptops?
Does this apply to Asus GPU's as well?
i always ran asus but i also have never had a stable usb3.0 port on any of my motherboards including the rog board i'm using now
Man I’m glad I watched this video I was about to drop some serious $$ on ROG products
Asus was always one of my favorites until the dirty shit they pulled with their newer equipment.
I peeled of Asus over 5 years ago - was a HUGE fan until constant quality control issues...so sad really.
Which motherboard brand is good ? Is Msi good ?
This is wild, I hadn't heard of all the issues lately with Asus. I've been a fanboy of theirs for coming on around 20 years - specifically for motherboards - because they've had great quality control and reliability. My last build was a Z77 Asus Sabertooth motherboard back in 2016 and it's been rock solid - but even then, it showed up with one of the heatsinks just plain missing one of its two retention screws, so it was handing sideways and an obvious issue as soon as I opened the box. Newegg was the distributor that I bought it from, so I put it down to maybe a Newegg issue, but now I'm not sure - maybe Asus's QC has been in decline since all the way back in 2016.
ASUS customer service has always been terrible....  At least in my experiences...  It sounds like the problems they had with the FX bulldozer line-up...  I suggest waiting until second gen ddr5 processors and motherboards to adopt it...  ASUS should take a page from Microsoft...  Microsoft in 2017 discontinued their smart phones...  They thought that because it was selling well that it would continue to do so...  Boy were they wrong...  Windows 10 phones started to decline in sales about a year after they came out...
My system is old but asus mb asus strix gpu ... Lol i wanted to upgrade anyways
Brands I do not trust as a college educated IT specialist (+ brands that don't give a f- about you): HP, ACER, ASUS, ITconnect, Evolveo  I live in Czechia (gaming PC is *relatively* about 2-3 times as expensive for me than for you guys from western countries like US, France) and as a gamer from middle school I've bought an Acer Predator (noone in the family knew how to work nor even build a PC and I was like 15 so me neither), it's over  years old now and I've replaced the motherboard, original HDD, bought HDD, PSU, 3 RAM sticks. They've put a random-brand PSU into my system with no 80 Plus or anything like that, made in China (PRC, *not Taiwan)* and it killed my 80$ RAM kit, entire motherboard, both HDDs. Overvoltage killed almost everything and a nearest service guy said he thinks everything's dead. Luckily both CPU and GPU survived... without those I'd have no more money to spare and while still studying at a college, I do need a gaming PC for my assignments... The best part is when I reached out to ACER they *couldn't care less* cause I was out of warranty for like a few months (~2-6 months) already. I was told they no longer have any compatible MB and the support person couldn't even tell me the form factor of the MB (I was a high school kid, second year in high school, I was learning Intel CPU code names, *basics* of programming, trimming ethernet cables and just totally basic stuff, I had no idea what my PC even really is xD, figuratively speaking)  Right now I have an ASRock MB and (sadly) an Evolveo PSU (I got a great deal I couldn't let down but I will not have this PSU for more than 2 years, stuff I've experienced (2 dead phones, exploding batteries, overheating to like 50°C (yes, you can not hold a phone that hot, I am not even exaggerating) and seen on the internet and heard from peers is just too much but I have no money so it does have to do it's job for at least 2 years and then I'll buy at least an 80 plus Gold PSU)
LOL, newegg also doesn't cover the resale of items that are missing parts or provide the warranty...  We just bought 2 new ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 17 (2023) and I'm praying that I won't have these issues.  Thanks for sharing the update, hate to see the fall of a great product line.
Sorry to hear the problem you're having with ASUS. I have to computers that have ASUS components. Motherboard and a laptop. Which company would you recommend? I used to like ASUS. But I also have a 4th Generation MSI motherboard, and it has been outstanding. Now it is a 4th gen, so I don't know about the newer gens. But I've heard always  good or great
I just bought an ASUS 27 inch monitor a while ago. now it has lines on it. RMA is shit!
I'm boycotting this company. They are so shady.
I think aorus gigabit boards are better than asus i think asus has got to greedy and they dont care about there customers i bought 2 boards from there and both faulty !
It would be helpful if you could qualify if this is 'across the board' (pardon the pun LOL) on all ASUS products ... or just recently released boards ... or just the higher end boards (which it seems most of your comments are about)???
Man what a shame to hear of everyone's experiences with this company. I must be one of the few lucky ones, I got my laptop 2 years ago and have only suffered a few dead pixels. I guess their shit customer service explains the rock bottom prices.  My next laptop won't be Asus for sure.
I bought a Asus gaming headphone and it is crap

so so, you have been supporting their shady practises for how long? not telling us?
My cpu was always steady of gigabyte boards. Now on asus and my cores are all over the place. Not sure how to fix this but it’s very unstable.
Damn Jay! that was a boss move son. I have always gone for Asus mobos because they seemed to be of better quality and looked rad but after hearing this, I might try out another manufacturer.  My last purchase was in 2019, a rog strix B450f board and it has been solid as heck but the time has come to upgrade to DDR5 ram. Who do y'all recommend?
Thanks for the heads up.  I am in the market now for a new video editing computer.  The two top contenders were Asus pro art or an Asus ROG with an AMD Ryzen i9.  The bad reviews on the BIOS issues I thought were limited to the pro art line.  Thank you for saving me from throwing my money away.   Subscribed.
I wanted to go with AMD for my next rig. I think I will just stick to tried and true Intel. I don't live in the US, so absolutely zero chance for RMA within reasonable time frame. So whatever I get needs to work without any issues and AMD is just too risky at this point. Too bad, I planned a 7800x3d with ASUS motherboard, but now I'm going to skip AMD altogether.
Hello is this issue also with Intel cpu or only amd? Is this issue fix?
I had oneAsus motherboard back in 2007 in a custom gaming pc.  Had to RMA it.   The second mobo was DOA - RMA.  Third at the time - worked when it wanted to.       The third finally stabilized after being kept in a storage unit for 9 years  I've been running an Asrock mobo with an AMD FX 9590 for years with no issues.
In short stay away from Asus!!
Has anyone had issues with b550-xe board?
Sounds like Sony all over again. Back in the day Sony was the be all and end all of AV devices, today I doubt anyone has a Sony TV or Sony device to play their music other than a PS5...
Also their customer support is absolutely rubbish. I bought an Asus laptop (which I do still use) it had some problems which I couldn't find fixes online. I might be able to get in touch with an actual person but nope their website redirected me to a bot over and over again.
Thanks. I have a rog phone5 S, sent it back under warranty and still fighting with asus almost a year later. Still no phone... stil no answers....
Happy I found this video. I was going to buy an asus motherboard but gonna but msi now
That's the best negative review I've ever heard. Lol. Got it - go with MSI or ASRock not Asus! Lol
Good, so then I'll keep buy Asus 🤣
Yeah, my last two desktops were ASUS motherboards, and one of them was just a nightmare.  ASUS used to be great, utterly reliable.    The key question, what brand do you think is  at the top of their game right now?   Not sure anybody else has stepped up their game enough to the high levels that ASUS used to be at.
@jayztwocents  I am beyond frustrated with Asus. The Z690 formula also has a major issue, which was originally falsely advertised and covered up by Asus (and/or EK?). I feel like this issue could use more visibility. My story is just one of many frustrated users.  I sent my Z690 formula in February to fix their corrosion issue, and they sent back a refurbished replacement a month later, claiming to have fixed a CPU socket problem (which they charged me for --- I didnt know any better). I had to follow up with 3 different reps before learning that they never touched the VRM; the "replacement" was not even ready. Luckily, they refunded me for the useless CPU socket repair. Over two months later they told me I could send it back for the VRM... I sent it in again, using that shitty white box I received. Somehow the PCB got major damage, and then they refused to fix it or cover it. I disputed and spent another 6 weeks going back and forth with the support rep. At one point, she told me they would cover it, but ultimately they didn't and stopped responding. They sent it back unrepaired and now I have a broken motherboard simply because I wanted to RMA in order to fix their original, non-copper VRM cooler.  I tried to buy a NEW replacement off Amazon (sold by Amazon/Asus). It showed up in a generic cardboard box packed in white foam. The box wasn't even the right size. The socket was missing the pin protector. The board had finger prints and was clearly used. None of the original equipment.
Literally just sent a B660 TUF motherboard back to RMA since I couldn't get a signal from my GPU  or motherboard regardless of hardware config, 2 monitors, DP or HDMI.  Pretty sure at this point I won't get a replacement, wish I saw this earlier as I bought it 2 weeks ago and sent it off 2 days ago.
I'm also done with ASUS.  Bought a M-16 w/ I9/ NVIDIA 3060 etc....  >$1800!,  lasted 1 1/2 years.  ASUS wanted more than I paid for it (>$1800.) to fix it.  Also had a Z270A motherboard in my desktop fail.  No more ASUS.
Is that only for the and boards or is it for the intel boards too
Sowho to go with now? MSi, Gigabyte or ASRock?
Since I've had my fill of issues with gigabyte, I thought I'd go with Asus next time, but I guess that won't happen.
I'm looking to buy a new notebook soon. Good to know that Asus is a red flag, they are dropped from my list now.
I dropped ASUS after their Zenith Extrema Alpha literally cooked a ThreadRipper because the faulty bios ( never fixed ) read the temperature at -265.c and turned off the CPU fan and left it that way. ASUS Fan control software did this, ASUS BIOS did this. Jay put my onto Fan Control - Fan Control works so the fault is solely a software one.
I had similar experience as some people in comments section. Bought a new MB for my new pc from asus. My system runs some time and after shut down it take 2 hrs to turn on every time. I sent the board to rma to check if there was a problem. Guess what they send a big picture of very micro scrach and says warranty void after some long frustrating mails and phone conversation. Btw those scratchs were never there when i sent. Their RMA is so good that they dont even check what exactly the problem is. There was no issue with the MB it was actually because of using 4 ddr5 6000hz ram as Jay mentioned in one of his video. The worst company ever to exist.
Unfortunatelly they concentrated too much on being big instead of being great.
Damn this could explain why my PC randomly started failing and couldn't find the cause
Sorry for my ignorance but is this something an everyday consumer should be worried about? I mean seeing how we don't get review units like influencers? Also what brands would you recommend I stick to. I am pretty outdated on PC knowledge, but looking to upgrade soon, hence why I'm asking.
Great to find this out. Now I can’t decide between MSI or Gigabyte (especially after gigabyte got roasted in a prev video in 2022)
i have a older gen asus tufgaming x570 right now with 5800x and it has been just as smooth as all my old intel setups but i’ll be sure to watch out for asus next time a do a build but that’s gonna be a few years
Wow I have an Asus mobo that has been running since 2012 it is the secondary computer in the house and I am about to put Windows 11 on it.  I have another Asus Mobo in a build from 4 years ago which has 20,000 hours.  I thought it was world's best brand.   I guess my next build is going to have to be something else.   This is like when Nissan went down the tubes in the car industry.  Edit:  the 2012 build won't take Win11 due to TPM issue.
Many companies forget what it means to make great products. After initial success, sales and marketing people take over and the product people eventually make their way out. — Steve Jobs nice looking packaging but poor product
i always stay a generation or 2 behind current in terms of pc building for reasons like this. I always have this nagging feeling that when tech falls out of current gen is when its been fully released. Im not paying top shelf prices to have shit short circuit on me because its in "beta" phase. TBH, most top shelf rigs are most style over sustance to the point where you get these back water looking rigs (cheap ass looking) outperforming current gen in both output and cooling. "Buying at release is just paying the most amount of money for the worst version of the product."
Asus so sad always ran to them first… not anymore… byyyeeeeeeeeee
i am upgrading my asus rog build from 5950x and 69650xtx to the new gen, what brand do you think i should go for now?
Well, I just got myself Z790. We shall see.
I've got the aSUS Hero gaming motherboard years ago, the audio worked for like 6 months, then I had to buy aSUS xonar ae sound card, Thought that would fix it. NOPE. It worked for about a year, then nothing.  Now I'm just getting a USB sound card to hook my head and mic phones to. It's in the mail. Havent had headphone or a mic in about 3 years. it about time I try to fix it.   Done with aSUS, Never again will I build with aSUS hardware.
so basically they made a bios that burns out cpus, then created a beta bios that if you use doesn't fix anything and voids your warranty. is it me or does it seem like they put out the beta in hopes loads of people would get it, burn out their cpus, lol i have been saying asus is a crap company for years.
Something must have changed in recent years, because Asus used to be highly reliable for me. I purchased an Asus laptop over a decade ago that served it's purpose well, then their desktop hardware worked great for a couple builds. I'm currently on my 2nd TUF MB, I think the first one was my fault, but now I'm not so sure.
I guess Asus is not paying YouTube at least ;-> because if it wasn't for YouTube that kept putting this video at the top of suggestions for me to watch, 2 month later, I probably would never have seen it. And I, planning to finally building a new PC about 7-8 years after my last build, can now erase Asus' products from my shortlist, where 2 of the alternatives I had for motherboards were Asus-products (leaving only Gigabyte products there for now, while hoping that the recent "calling-home" thingy was a one-off that is corrected now). Always happy to join in against shady business customers handling.
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!!!!!
8:30 , This is what we call a fiber, Those pins are not bent.
Noooooe I just bought the Z790-P 🥲 It was going to be my first DIY PC. Edit: It's the only ASUS item in the whole build plus Wifi card. I still have time to return and change.  Thanks a lot! This video was so helpful!
DON'T BUY ASUS PRODUCTS
Omg and I just ordered the Asus TUF Gaming Z690-Plus D4 (no wifi) board, I hope everything will be ok, could you please recommend me a board?  I need the PC mostly for gaming.  The parts ordered are: Processor: i7 12700k / with the Noctua Cooler procesor NH-D15. Ram: G. Skill Ripjaws (V F4-3600C16D-16GVKC) DDR4 2 x 8 GB  3600 MHz CL16. GPU: Asus TUF Gaming RTX 3070Ti OC V2 8GB, GDDR6X, 256bit. Power Supply: Be Quiet Dark Power 13, 80+ Titanium 850W Case: Corsair 4000d Air Flow (I having second thoughts that it may be to small?!)  And The MSI Pro Z690-P DDR4 board is $66 cheaper and I'm thinking that I maybe should've gone with that?  Thank you in advance!!!
Dam...  what a shame.
Wow! I cant even imagine the meeting where it was decided to implement such a caveat. Like Ive been in my share of incompetent meetings, but wow... how da fk was that decision reached? Im returning to PC after like 20yrs on Mac, and my last PC (and every PC prior) ran on an ASUS board, it didnt take long in the research process to learn, "okay... dont just get an ASUS".
Funny seeing this now.  I don't think I have anything Asus, would have to double check my wife's pc.  But I bought one of the ROG Allys.  Was excited about it as I don't game much anymore and wanted to get back into some light stuff.  I had the Ally for a week.  I got it to work and run a game 2 nights out of that week due to issues/updates.  Games it said it could run, even on low settings weren't playable.  Was cool to play Halo handheld having grown up with the franchise and Gameboys.  Farming Simulator worked great, for a time until my save file corrupted.  Deleted the save, REINSTALLED the game, and started over. No skybox.  Sky was black.  I reset it and returned it the next day.  Had it for literally 7 days.
I'm about to start a RMA for a 3080 tuf.  I keep reading about their CS and now this video.   I feel like this is going to be a nightmare.
Just bought a ROG STRIX Z790-H Gaming WiFi on newegg last night for my first ever build. Should I be worried?
Wow, and to think I refused to buy ASUS for years solely because I found their "REPUBLIC OF GAMERS" tag to be so embarrassing.
Nice and all but what is a good brand then to sellect your pc parts?
i just bought a 7800x3d paired with a ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A GAMING WIFI am i safe?
Well, I have been buying ASUS for years and never had a board go bad.  But you do a lot more volume than I do.
Awesome video yet again!  I was about to buy an ASUS motherboard, but will happily buy my second Asrock motherboard for my new PC.  Thank you sir!
My mate had an Acer laptop that lasted him absolute years, but, its age did eventually catch up to it and he had to get a replacement! He got an Asus laptop! It lasted all of five minutes before he got ANOTHER new laptop! I was in the market for a new laptop at the time and asked what was up! Long story short, I got a Fujitsu Siemens instead! Years later, my dad was thinking of getting a laptop and he asked me for advice, I told him "either go Dell or Acer, but whatever you do, AVOID Asus and HP"! This was from collective experience from within our Xbox Clan, mind you, I cited aforementioned example and even same said mate's brother who had a HP but seemed to have a different fan every other week! Okay, I might be exaggerating on the how many fans he had, but it genuinely felt that way! His fan went, he was using the one from the living room temporarily until a replacement came! It came! He soon went back to using THE SAME FAN from the living room, a big full size fan like you find in offices, by the way, jus blowing cold air into his thin HP laptop! It was ridiculous! So, I'm not sorry, HP, I'm not sorry, Asus! I jus cannot in good faith or conscience recommend your products!
But you don't even look at the TRADITIONAL Hardware Jam up Culprit, AMD?  :)
Gigabyte is still the king
Fire Aorus  motherboards total garbage, master x570  tried 2 boards both failed in short time. Never ever buy again !
glad to hear you are going back intel man ive always been rocking intel and its great and always been better than my buddies amd pc's.
ASUS is a trash mainboard manufacturer. Had LGA1366 and AM4 boards from them. Both had problems. Interesting quality from a 'god tier' brand.
It’s been a couple months on these motherboards has there been any update or improvements since?
Thanks for the review. I was considering buying a Asus gaming laptop the ROG 18", I like the look of the laptop. I think i will go with Alienware.
Do ASUS's problems also extend to their graphics cards as well? I was thinking of buying a 4000 series graphics card from ASUS and this is making me rethink that
Someone working there must really want ASUS to Burn from the inside out.
Ive never once had a good experience with an asus product
this is crazy, i made a build last year around October time of 2022, Ryzen 7 5800x with ROG strix b550 or b570 cant remember which one, but after 1 month of use and about 1 months of trying to find what was going on with it as it just one day would boot and was unstable, i replace GPU, PSU, RAM, to then find that is was the motherboard and CPU that had seemingly died or fried one of the two (bought new MB to test CPU), so i RMA both of them, CPU replaced in around 1-2 weeks but the ASUS MB took them 7 months to refund me (witch i only got 2 days ago) because they was trying to say that i had damaged the board in the corner of the PCB on install🤣🤣, like iv messed with computer take them apart and putting them together for around 10+ years I'm by no means a professional but fuck im not that dumb, i sorted my computer in the January of this year, went with MSI and by nothing short of a miracle my computer has been fine since. LOVE you ASUS.
It’s not only Asus that is going anti-consumer and starting to lack quality control recently but I also heard similar cases with Dell. I’ve heard many complaints recently about Dell Products also arriving defective or sudden bios update provided with Dell makes the computer unusable. I think it’s a general trend with some PC companies so that they can make more money just by selling another laptop.
What a shit show. I always used MSI boards, never issues. though I did often go with Asus video cards. I guess I'll stay away.
Glad I don't have any Asus stuff! I do love all my Gigabyte/Aorus stuff though. :) Appreciate you dropping Asus with all this BS.
Been using asus for years...and have been absolutely astounded by their crap support..the way they put a product out on the market then abandon it
If I didn't have mad respect for you before, I definitely do now. Great lookin out. As a sidenote, I just ordered an ASUS B450M-A-II motherboard from Amazon for my first-ever PC build. It was between that and a very budget MSI board that were within my price range--not an ideal choice to be honest lol I've had my issues with MSI in the past. I first ordered the MSI board and within 24hrs had a change of heart and went with the ASUS instead. I was just thinking since it's an older board with all the kinks worked out and no issues so far (that I've heard of) hopefully it won't blow up on me any time soon. Such a shame about ASUS--they always seemed the strongest most reputable mainstream company I knew of. But after all this coming to light, I think you're definitely onto something and making a great call to end your sponsorship for the forseeable future. Again mad respect my man! I only found your channel very recently via Linus' related/recommended vids, but the more I see and hear the more I am impressed. Keep up the great work, service, and integrity, and best of luck with your new setup! Hope you get all the love, support and respect you deserve. Lookin forward to discovering more videos on your channel.
Boards sre more expensive than ever and they dont even function.
When, or if yours burns 🔥 up ... After putting it out ..... ..... Go buy a MSI x570 carbon  or any MSI or  Gigibte Ausroc motherboard.  For 300 bucks, it will kill your overpriced crap!  90 amp capacitors  14 + 2 rail some 16 + 2   All the best parts between 250 and 350 bucks.  God like sucks donky balls! 🫏  A msi carbon , you can overclock all your parts a coUntry milllllllllle!
I got an Asus laptop during COVID and its drivers were broken. They wouldn't fix it because it was an intermittent problem, so they claimed it was working as intended.  It took an entire year for them to finally fix the mobo bios and system drivers to make the system work as intended. It sat in a corner gathering dust for about 13 months.  Finally they released a major bios update that fixed it.  I had an $800 paperweight for 13 months, because it randomly locked up and required a hard shutdown.  It works now, but even 4 years out the battery lasts like 2 hours, so it stays plugged in for the most part.
Jay thanks so much for your honesty, I like Asus but if they are going to act this way, I am using something else. I am building a computer this weekend thanks so much Jay I will either go with ASrock, MSI, or Gigabyte
I watch your channel on and off,  glad I watched this as I'm getting ready to build a new pc.  I have always loved Asus
anything ASUS in my consumer affairs/purchases has been  black listed since last year ;-)
This evidence is making me steer far away from Asus products. Too bad because I used to be fan.
I just went to intel
I have been a die-hard ASUS supporter. I've always trusted them. Now who do I trust?
I am currently running my rig using a ROG STRIX B450-F GAMING. As someone new to hearing this issue, is my rig at risk? I haven't had any issues in like the couple years I've had the MoBo. At one point I was having some ram issue but that has since been resolved
Oh, I was just about to pick an Asus board, when this showed up on my feed. I used Asus boards in every build, no issues and kinda trust(ed?) the brand. Thanks for the Video and the comments here. You probably saved me from trouble.
I only buy motherboards from ASUS. I tried MSI, ASRock or AOpen in the past, but was disappointed the one or other way. But my ASUS mainbords were always of good quality, so I stuck to it.
Simplest thing.  I had used an ASUS motherboard for my previous setup, i had some issues. Their AI Suite programm would randomly stop starting, nothing could fix it, uninstall and install was doing nothing. Which you know, is fine, shit happens. But, when i tried reaching them off with support emails and all that..NOTHING. Just nothing. I got one answer one time that wasn't even close to giving me answers and that was it.  That was it for me. ASUS never again. If you don't have customer support, you probably shouldn't exist.
I have had my own issues with an H series board I bought from them for my first build.  It just stopped working and wouldn’t even boot, so I tested the power supply, and it’s fine.  So, my conclusion is that the board was the issue.  Read about the customer service, didn’t feel like dealing with that nonsense on top of dealing with the crappy laptop, so I mourned the $160 I spent on that board and bought an EVGA board.  Edit: the Asus gpu and the lights on one of the case fans I bought for that pc also went the way of the dodo.  The only Asus product that hasn’t done so is a monitor.  I have set aside funds to replace it when it joins the others in the no longer working department.
Wanted to ask people here what they think of the proart boards from asus, I bought the z790 and so far it seems to be doing ok, wanted to see if anyone else has experience with it.
This is a great video. I bought an Asus laptop last year July 1 and just yesterday the laptop had a cpu or motherboard failure so the 1 year warranty was just out of date. Today I spent 1:30 minutes on the phone with customer support just to get a simple RMA ticket to get it repaired free of charge. I hope they just fix it and send it back without further issues.
its so crazy that everyone believes and sides with Jay when he is totally full of crap and any serious pc enthusiast and overclockers knows Asus is far above every other brand. always has been and still is.
I'm not surprised. Years ago I bought an Asus MoBo from Tiger Direct. After I built my PC the CPU was displaying -245 degrees. I reach out to Asus Customer Service and they told me that they couldn't honor the warranty because it was supposed to be in the Chinese Market, not the USA. So I reach out to Tiger Direct who replaced it with an MSI board. ..Funny enough Asus Customer Service reached out 3 years later to finally honor the warranty...I told them Ummm Since you didn't honor your warranty I had to go through the merchant for a like replacement...The CS said Oh! Ok.. click...So it's been 8 years and I have completely banned all Asus products and whenever someone asked for my recommendations I steer them away from Asus...I now work for a Medical school and they were recently considering Asus products so I niped that in the bud... As I see it if they can’t have the decency to honor their warranties  they don't deserve my business
so many sheep in the comments you'd think it was a farmers market
Got my B450 Prime A II and it only lasted for 2 weeks. They won't return it as they said that I "inflicted" the damage. Lol
Using AMD without updating your boards is impossible.
I have am 4 asus prime b-450 m-a and I’ve had it since I bought the prebuilt but the prebuilt parts was r5 2600 6c 12T and amd radeon 580 4gb one stick of ddr4 8gb of ram… now I have a ryzen 7 5700x and a radeon 6600 8gb and 64gb of ram maybe the am 5 platforms are if there are blowing up I need to find another brand for when I go am 5 and anyone got any recommendations?
I hope you don't regret burning the Asus bridge...
thanks, 2023 rog laptops coil whine say hi
Still running a home server with Asrock mobo for 13 years.  Haswell CPU.  Makes me rethink rolling dice on buying products from new companies that enter market.
I watch a lot of different tech tubers, but you Jay, are the one that stands out most to me. You stand up for what you believe in and don't take any crap from any company. You are my most favorite tech channel and I cannot emphasize that enough. Keep those videos coming! The day you retire, will be a sad day in my book. Also, I will not be using any Asus products in my upcoming build!
Also 2023 laptops like ASUS Strix Scar 17 2023 G733PZ/PY have serious issues like sudden reboots while using APU/iGPU, fast-flickering in the top screen area, loud coil whine and USB C issues 🤦🏻‍♂
they want you to put the fix to void your warranty!!!!
Oh boy, this industry is just depressing at this point. There seems to be one major company after another screwing over customers and becoming just another greedy giant. Ain't gonna make much profit if your reputation goes to shit and people go elsewhere! I buy because I trust a brand and think most people do to.
I no longer want ASUS in my next build, but it makes it kinda hard, biggest pc shop in norway mostly has asus gpu and motherboards...
Honestly I first want to thank you for your honesty about this whole experience with Asus. As an owner of almost a whole setup of ROG (w/ the exception of my fans & ram) this is extremely hard to hear, but needed. I respect the amount of honesty it took to make this video & I can see it wasn't easy for you to make because like me, you genuinely like Asus/ROG products. I originally fell in love with ROG because of the aesthetics of their products. And even though i personally have never had any RMA issues with my ROG products, this video definitely opens my eyes to what i could potentially have to deal with if i ever do in the future, so thank you for shedding light on Asus & their poor customer service. Clearly they have alot of learning to do about customer priority, like you said. At the end of the day a brand is more than their aesthetics, it's about how they treat & deal with their consumers. Even though it really pains me to hear how bad of an experience you had with a company I really like, I am pretty sure for my next build i will be changing over to intel & Nvidia. Thank you for keeping your content honest because someone else might've felt the necessity to not speak the truth at the sake of being provided parts from Asus. That really shows that you do care about us in the Tech community & your follwers by providing us this vital information about Asus.
Dang just stumbled on this video... putting together a new build and Mobo and GPU are both Asus... I may have to rethink that.
Yup too bad their New Rog 7 phone doesnt even support wifi calling or receiving texts over wifi. just another major Gaming oriented company shitting the bed
Calm down Karen
Does they have the same issues with Intel motherboards
Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
what brand moba to go with then?
10:15 Funny  I have a few years old Asus TUF Gaming X570 Wifi with a 3600, and on rewatching this episode, I just realized that I have a bunch of issues with USB stability.  Things like the keyboard not working after a restart, and having to force power off the machine TWICE to get it to work again. Some device that I can't find that keeps disconnecting, so I constantly keep hearing the USB connect/disconnect sounds from Windows.  I've been blaming Win11, but now I'm putting 2+2 together and wondering about that....
After watching this I returning my motherboard that I just bought
Cool story,  So tell me again did you just forget about this of did they offer you enough money to start using their products again?
Love my B650E Taichi board..
Is there an update to this?
Thank you brother. This video did push me to spend some cash I didn't expect to, but I'm so happy to let go of my ASUS fanboy days. Been using them for almost 2 decades exclusively now. MSI's Dragon finally won me over lol
THANKYOU! THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO!! I'd love it if you could respond back with a comment. I've never bought an ASUS. At work, they provided an ASUS Chromebook which worked well. I've been looking at (2) models. Last year's AMD Rog laptop is $800 off at Best Buy for $1299 with the 2/1 flip and all those great specs and all those awesome ports, so, I don't have to buy docking stations. Anyway, upon further investigation, I learned there have been tons of quality control complaints, blue screens of death and conflict issues with the hardware. Then, I see they have moved to mostly Intel I9 models in the 2023 versions. Okay, sounds good. There were bugs. You fixed them, you got rid of AMD, sounds good, right? So, Best Buy has a limited quantity of Q540VJ laptops which were released late last year, also for $1299 - rebranded from Vivo or Creator series (you don't know for sure) with a special Best Buy configuration that is different from ASUS on website. But, the specs again for the price sound fantastic. So, you read on the Best Buy site to see about expansion and you get conflicting answers and you don't know who to trust for the answers and then I call ASUS and after waiting on hold, the ASUS rep doesn't have a clue. I know more than the person at ASUS who was helping me.  One ASUS support rep said we don't tell you what size Torq screwdriver you need to add ram and advise you to take it to a repair shop. I said can't you open the manual and look it up. "I'm not allowed to do that."  You are not allowed to do that? To tell me the size of the base of th unit's screws because I am a consumer?  I was so annoyed at that bullshit, I called back and had the call escalated sitting on hold and reached another person who didn't know. He honestly did not know. So, he created a case and told me there would be a follow up in a few days. Can you believe that? I could download a DELL manual on their website. But, this is a special Best Buy configuration, so, I don't know for sure what I'm buying.  Anyway, the unit comes with an I9 chip and 16 ram and 1TB, but, some people say it has 8gig soldered on the board and ASUS thinks it is 16gig soldered with an empty 2nd slot. Either way,  there is a crazy motherboard limitation that you can only max out at 24mb - is that crazy? You can't go to 32gig! Then, there is conflicting info about if there is a 2nd mv2 slot for an SSD or if I can upgrade to a faster Samsung 990 SSD, etc.  I can't even ge a straight accurate answer on whether to buy an 8gig stick or a 16gig stick. I also asked them if it uses a Torq5 screw on the base and what size screws, so, I can make sure I have everything I need if I buy it to get it set up and go, without delays getting extra ram, an SSD or screwdriver I need, etc. In the end if the unit is not upgradeable, it's a dealbreaker. I shouldn't have to buy it at Best Buy, take it home and have to return it after a week or wait for delivery of parts. It sucks, but, I know more than Best Buy knows, too, and I don't know everything. Geek Squad? Not easy to get the tech to answer this. They want you to leave it in the shop and the salesperson is lucky they know how to ring up the sales transaction. They don't know, either. I am disgusted. I've had good luck with Dell support on the phone through the years. I hate HP support on printers, so, I don't know if I am ready now to buy an ASUS. I've beginning to have 2nd thoughts about quality control and about any customer support issues I may have.  If you are not going to have knowledgeable support agents, you might as well just get rid of the people and add AI and bot chat and if they do that and I can't speak to anyone live, that would also be a dealbreaker. Just disgusted. Best support experiences I've ever had, though, are with Apple. Anyway, done venting. But, if you read this in a timely manner and can answer the questions, I'd love to read your response otherwise I have to decide this weekend to either buy the ASUS and maybe return it or just pass on ASUS completely.
Thanks for pointing this out
Sheesh. My only real experience with Asus is the P8Z68-V Pro Gen3 I'm still using, which has thankfully been rock-solid for eleven years and counting.  Given all these videos and reports of bad experiences it looks like I might want to rethink about which Z790 board I choose in the near future.
msi msi msi msi msi msi
i watch this video after purcased $4500 in Asus products to build a PC...... a 7950X3D, Strix x670e-e, Strix 4090 OC, and etc..... and now im questioning my whole life man wtf! What do i need to do to the PC before or after i put it together? Do i update the bios? and if so how do i do that before its connected to all my other expensive components? Having a crisis right now
Asus becoming second Gigabyte, at least in terms of brand power and price to product quality ratio.
Bought a 4070 TI Strix a few days ago (to replace an old EVGA 1060 6gb), so guys can imagine my face watching this haha. Used to like TUF motherboard series, and has one in my current RIG, but after this certainly will think twice when need to buy another board.  Kudos J!
I used to love MSI, until they sent me multiple bad motherboards, then I switched to ASUS.  I don't know if they have corrected those manufacturing defect issues but I miss knowing the parts I purchased were high quality and would perform as advertised.
I stopped using ASUS ten years ago.
What brands do you recommend as a replacement? My defaults have always been asus or EVGA. EVGA is out of their damn minds right now with what they are offering that aren't even in stock.
Republic of Overpriced Garbage 🤣 ijk I just can't afford it. Shameful nonetheless
Had Asus motherboard for 10+ years, still working well.
I just bought a ASUS ROG Strix DD5 board for my first new build since 2012 because I've had nothing but perfection from them in the past. As soon as I opened it the CPU socket cover was loose and there was a row of bent pins directly under one of the PEGS ON THE PIN SIDE OF THE COVER. Thankfully Amazon had a new one to me the next day, but now I'm nervous about how reliable this board is going to be.
I wanted to buy asus rog strix B650E-F gaming wifi ATX AM5 Motherboard but with this issue going around I chose to wait for abit, is the problem only for X670E motherboards or all of them?
I Was going to say it's possible China, being the manufacturer of ASUS products, ruined the quality of their products because they have a vendetta against Taiwan. However, that wouldn't explain the awful customer service experiences.
OMG I'm an Asus fan, hope I wont encounter this issue with Asus in future
Which is the other brand he has banned within 11 years?
I have been buying Asus boards for over 25 years and after what I see from you and others I will no longer buy anything from them. They did it too themselves.
Glad I saw this video. I am about to change out my CPU/Mobo combo to AMD from Intel and was thinking I would stick with the same ASUS mobo brand that I have been using for years. Guess its time to start researching other brands for a Mobo. This sucks, loved ASUS.
Goodbye ASUS and I will follow you to end JAY. My next $5,000 build will have zero ASUS no matter how much I love their aesthetics.
I am Asus all the way, hope you're listening. Asus u need to fix this for your other customers.
What would you recommend for a good Mobo for the 7800x3D? Not looking to overclock. I just work and game on my pc and run 3 monitors. Building with a 4080 as well.
Hey Jay, what's a good replacement motherboard for a 4090 + 7950X3D build?
Asus did almost the exact same thing to me with my very first build: bent or broken pins, TWICE!!! They were the number one reason why my build took 6 months to finish!!! 😭
Jay-Z  thanks man no asus for me than..
Just dropped 5k on a new build, with my best custom loop yet (planned at least). Have been using Asus MB and Monitors for years. Appreciate this video, wouldn't have known otherwise. No Asus in this build.
i understand the frustrations and the bad experiences . though like when i read the pointless praises in the comments and people like building an army to talk sht to asus its really cringe . people may have bad experiences and its of course important but like this military approach of shtting on a brand always sounds cringe and trust me they are fine and will be fine for a long time asus is basically porsche of the computers so no matter what u say like " asus has fallen " or "oh they are not gonna recover from this" etc is just sad . people are really braindead. the amount of people happy withj the brand should be like 98 percent to be honest does this make the problems irrelevant . of course not . but i think its the people just wanting to hate on anything and lash out like brainded spoiled kids is whats annoying me . just to be clear jay has made a great and informative video i liked watching it and im sorry as a business he had to deal with these situations its definitely frustrating
Currently shopping for a motherboard for a i5 13600kf, which brand MB and model do you recommend for it? Been about 10 years since I have build and used to trust ASUS.
I find that asrock is really good. I think they have made leaps and bounds.:)
Mad respect, I'm going to watch you more now. We need more honest people.
My 10 year old ASUS motherboard maximus hero vi still working, but 1x EVGA GPU died and other GPU on way out, and recently PSU died (basically like a clock at 10 years). The MB always had crap driver/bios support... they didn't update it at all and come windows 10 upgrade problems started and all their software stopped working. The MB HW was good and only had to replace the coin battery. Just rebuilding the whole thing and going with a gigabyte MB...seems most reliable and the company getting more focused on enterprise rather than gaming. MSI would be second choice.   I used plenty of ASUS ROG stuff in the last 20 years...Software, customer service, and support was never good, though 10+ years ago their MBs were the top choice for performance, overclocking, and multiple graphics cards. I don't think it matters today because other brands offer the same BIOS tools and honestly overclocking isn't really a thing today...just like SLI/crossfire not needed. When shopping for MB today for AM5 build, my mine focus was low price and reliability...features or future proofing wasn't.   A B650 board for $150-200 good enough...add some expo 32g DDR5 RAM ($100), a 7800X3D CPU ($400) to match with a RX 7900 XT ($700), and reuse your PSU/case/fans/HDSs, you got a high end setup cheap considering 10 years ago I spent 3500+. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't why anyone would go with an Intel/Nvidia built today...cost so much more for worse performance.
Well I know what company I’m not buying from anymore 🫥
I just went back to Intel (13700K, primarily a gamer) and went MSI over Asus after using Asus exclusively for YEARS.  Asus is far too expensive to be as junk they are now.
what if you bought one? is that representative of the average user experience? NO, we have a saying in Portugal: A cavalo dado, não se olha os dentes. (You don't look at the teeth of a free horse!) lool
Ive watched this video twice now and after this my next build will have an MSI board in it. I'll happily admit that prior to this I was an ASUS fanboy but Im done with them now.
That's crazy!! Thank you Jay for this honest review.+1sub for no bullshit!
It's funny that you mentioned Asrock. I have an Asrock board in my PC. Sure, not high end stuff, but it's reliable, and it's a hand me down from my brother. We also built him an AMD build (the one that became mine is intel) we also had an Asrock motherboard, and we weren't disappointed
Was just planning on my brand new pc build, was thinking about what rog motherboard to pick (because I dig the design too), and I stumbled upon this video. I think I will look elsewhere for a new motherboard now.
I was thinking to buy a Asus Rog Strix B550 -f gaming wifi ii motherboard to pair it with a 5700x and a 3060ti.....after watching this video I'm worried now....can i used the motherboard or should i see some other one.....can you suggest me one with wifi in the same price....it will really help me....thanks
Just leave your system at default settings. All this messing about is your fault. You sound like a massive baby ffs!
Hahaha, I just watched this full video (after seeing it the first time it came out). I have an ROG X670E Gene btw, paired with a 7950x- long story short, I had to RMA my motherboard and it’s going back to me “fixed” this coming Monday. J’s channel is one of the few channel that made me gravitate towards ASUS these past few years, and I’m glad that J is being honest. It looks like I’ll be switching to other mobo manufacturers in my future builds (I also build computers for friends and family as a hobby).
IF Asus want to be credible they must have a better quality check box by box and classify them in the right category no? a broken motherboeard never should be shipped out they are box protected how  can pins be scrapped in shipping?
The price cosummers pay to build a PC gaming  they should expect good bios updates that have been proven safe   same things for the pharmaceuticals who release vaccines that are not provven 100% safe.   Asus better get there act together for that brand could desappear if they do not?  people will look in another direction than Asus?
I bought a Strix Z790-E in February.  It was up and running with frequent USB issues until it bricked with a "USB over current detected" issue about 3 weeks later.  After some basic customer support, it was sent off for RMA.  They find a single bent pin on the CPU socket and inform me this isn't under warranty (I didn't really think to check before sending it back unfortunately, so I cannot say if it was okay before).  A few hundred for the "repair" + shipping got me a totally different board (I had a little scratch on the solder side of my original).  THANK YOU for making this stand and bringing more attention to their quality issues and poor customer support.
all asrock boards are FUGGLY... there design team needs to be fired..
I would ditch AMD before I ditch ASUS.  I quit watching your channel after you made this video. I don’t agree with your decision. You strike me more is an AMD fanboy.
I've had decent luck with Gigabyte..
Well, sheet. I've bought a ROG Strix x670E in the late February - no issues so far, but you're scaring me now
Ive been having similar thoughts. I stopped purchasing their pc components, but I'm having a hard time deciding what to replace their networking equipment with. Who are y'all using for routers and switches? It seems like that sector has almost completely gone to shit.
I have always used ASUS motherboards until my most recent build with MSI. I am very happy with the swap.
This video has made is where i will never buy anything asus ever again and im sad i have a asus gaming router but i haven't had problems with it just worried how they would handle a problem
lol its funny that you think they care what you say
I've had major issues with 2 Asus motherboards (both died abruptly) and that was 15 years back. I thought they must've grown better by now. Welp, guess they never learnt.
Bought a asus gaming laptop once, had issues, the design inside was very poor for heat management, just poor overall, so never bought a asus product ever again.
Man, I really wish I saw this before I bought my board recently
Always Asus or evga
i am looking to build my first pc and i have the asus tuf gaming b550-plus wifi ll and an4 in my amazon cart. What would be a good mother board around 170 dollars cause thats what this one is and i liked it but i havent bought anythig yet but i plan on buying ryzen 5 5500 cpu but open for any suggestions at this point. ryzen 5 5500 99dollars motherboard 170 dollars gpu 135 dollars 600w power suply 50 dollars  2tb ssd 93 dollars cpu cooler 18 dollars 16gb ram 30 dollars tower 53 dollars with three fans pre installed thanks.....650 dollar build probably will need some thermal past at well as windows 11...
I bought a 7950X3D for my second build. I'm not really versed in this build/PC parts stuff, either. I also bought an X670 Aorus Elite AX, and I've been reading some things about the BIOS that sound troubling. Can you give me any advice on this build? Anything I should know? I'll be doing this build this weekend. Please advise on anything important I should know. Thank you so much for your time in reading and responding 🙏🏻
I’m STILL looking for incredible…
I just got an asus zephyrus.....am i screwed???
Its crazy growing up one of the major PC brands was Asus if you had an acer people made fun of you and called it ghetto Asus etc
not me changing the build i have saved on pc part picker for my goal PC
Their products are the most expensive out there.  They charge more period.  Their service used to be good and it was why I’d still buy them.  Now, I’m looking to find another brand to be loyal to.  I have been buying ASUS motherboards and GPUS for over a decade.  It’s a shame their quality and their materials they use in their products has gone way way down and we all have kept buying
This absolutely blows my mind as I have been building computers for over a decade and out of all the companies Asus has always been the most reliable company for me.  If there was any company I would push off is MSI I have hand fulls of absolutely horrible experiences with MSI including RMA and many products coming faulty.  Now I don't know what brand I can go to when building computers for people and myself.
I was preparing to buy a new pc, my  curend one is 4 years old si it is time to move over a new gaming rig.I was planning to go full beserk with asus rog seriea from case coolers vents gpu etc etc but after seeing this i will go for corsair  /  msi combo.
Asus Armory Crate is the WORST fu**ing program I had to endure so far. It's so terrible, I have reinstalled million of times, it never worked with some sort of bug! I had laptop too which died just after 2 years like 1-2 months after the warranty...
Why do I fell that almost every single tech/computer part being sold today has some sort of problem or will explode in 1-2 years.  Still running i5 8600K with a msi Z370 Gaming plus (basic Z mobo) and it’s running stable with a soft oc since day one.  Don’t think I’ll change anything for a couple of years since everything seems fragile and it’s going to brake fast
Well fuck me for buying a x670e 2 months prior to this video.... Have had tons of crashes and even with all the fixes it still does the random usb disconnect thing sometimes and an occasional bluescreen. If anyone knows a fix lemme know-,-
i just had a motherboard die that was from asus
damn and I just bought an ASUS MB.......ughh
This post was this just a prank?!
ive had several issues with current and past pcs. and after trouble shooting those systems for sometime weeks one end. i always feel its the mobo thats the problem. ive had asus, asrock, and msi boards. all seem to have or had persisting issues that i cant resolve. Id really appreciate some input on a solid brand or even series of boards within a "reasonable" price range. Or even brands to stay away from for components such as ram.
Oooofff. I am in the market for a whole new pc build. I was going to go with a lot of asus branded parts, even a new monitor. Unfortunately I trust Jay's opinion on the matter and will probably be going msi with the motherboard. Hell even asrock. I have them right now and I have had 0 issues so why not?
I can tell you why all this happening , so you know the tension between US and China are not friendly... US cut off the "Chip" Supply to China... so now everything thay ou said "Made in china"  and China is having issues with Taiwan... Which Asus is made , won't be as good they are recycling the products.... And this is what you get the aftermath of a "Trade war"  And yes people the conflict outside of gaming influences us gamers!
So glad I watched this was starting to get components for a new computer and have owned ASUS in the past, but WOW if they are going to be shady about their products yeah that's a hard pass for me.  This is what happens when companies/corporations succumb to greed, and bend the knee to the stakeholder profit shares. Wonder if they understand the numbers of losing customers? But thank you for your integrity as I am sure losing a supporter like ASUS for your channel is not easy.
Is not this kind of shit happening everywhere? why are you guys pretentious like it was only Asus as the big brand did this? Only Apple deals with very excellent Customer Support after sales, and this is not happening in Indonesia at all as American Company never really want to have anything on us but our money lol.
My heart stopped for a second because I didn't remember exactly what motherboard I ordered but it seems to be a gigabyte one, I hope that means I am in the clear.
so i shouldnt get a asus mother board now huh
Asus can't handle AMDs power and prowess. They can stick to intel
I have a ROG Zephyrus S Gx531-GS. The mother board ended up frying itself (outside of warranty). Never overclocked, no liquid metal, no overvolting, always plugged into a power surge protector (no parts were modified or removed, completely stock). It looks like I'll avoid Asus for a bit.
I've had several Asus computers over the years. My current one is the Z97-E USB 3.1 with a i7-4790K CPU. This system has run flawlessly for the past 8 years. But I finally decided to build a new computer and have ordered the Asus ProArt X670E-Creator and a Ryzen 7900X CPU. I bought it with great confidence that it will be another awesome machine. Now after watching this video, I suddenly have become a bit worried. It is due to arrive tomorrow. I really hope I will not be disappointed. My super excitedness has now become a bit of a worry. Fingers are crossed. 🥺
i have an asus ROG Strix B550-F mobo after watching this does anyone have any recommendations for a new mobo?
glad I'm building an Asus computer with a couple years ago parts lol. wish i saw this video prior to so much ROG stuff :/
I know I will never buy another ASUS motherboard.  I wonder what their gpu cards and support is like in 2023.  ASUS has been known for quality for a long time, but apparently no longer.  ASUS should be ashamed.  Oddly, I do have a ASUS gaming laptop and I love  it. It works perfectly , has great quality , and looks great !!!!.  But,   sadly that was and will be my last ASUS product for life.
You fired him, but there are plenty of guys who is willing to hire them, God, I am so sick and tired of y’all complaining about this system, hell, I even heard one guy complain because he didn’t had LTE or 5G and what I find really amazing the same one’s who is complaining about this, and that are also complaining about the price. Get a life even if they would’ve gave this shit away for free you were still complaining like a bunch of itches!!! so stop complaining if you don’t like it return it get your money back by something invent something better but other than that please for the love of God stop complaining!!!
My 6 month asus z790 prime just wouldn't turn on after being off for a week. Going through the rma process now! I dont have any hopes at all. Might as well go msi or gigabyte.... 😢
All of the ROG shit is when I started avoiding Asus. Too much stupid bullshit for the e-waste kids. Showed a clear priority shift. Started going Gigabyte.
Can some one help me i have no idea what to do or how to get an answer from the company they keep ignoring me  I send a defective keyboard back to Asus using their RMA system, got charged 35 dllrs non refundable, after a week i was told that the device was not reparable and they were going to replace it with a "new device" for 190 dollars, while offering zero manufactures warranty besides the 90 day period after the repair. The asked for 190 dllrs while the same new keyboard with warranty is 240 on Amazon. So i rejected the repair and ask for my keyboard to be returned as is, when I got it back the keyboard was incomplete missing the number pad, after calling Asus and letting them know about the issue they keep telling me they will call me back in 24-48 hours but still nothing. I payed on May 2nd and got my keyboard back on June 9th since then I still haven't received a answer from the company, i just want a my missing part back, a replacement or a full refund since this part cannot be purchased separately not will it work properly without it.  I have the RMA number an case number if necessary.
Have always considered Asus a solid option for my builds. No longer I guess. Do better Asus!
6 or 7 years ago, when I built my current PC, Asus used to be the best of the bunch.  My last three builds had Asus motherboards. I'm avoiding them like the plague now, this isn't the only issue with them according to other videos I've seen.  I'm probably going Gigabyte or ASRock now I think for my next build.
It's over man, the Devil has taken control of the whole plane and this is what Chaos looks like, best thing you can do now is build an Underground bunker and take your good shit with you and build a faraday cage around your bunker, and gear up to protect your life and your family and wait for the End to come.  The lord of Spirits' awaits you.  God Love and protect you Jay.
Asus has been overpriced for so long that I stopped buying their boards several gens ago. With ASRock you get good quality without the premium price. Yes they weren't great not long ago. But I've had no issues with the last several ASRock boards I've had and I still have 4 in my home being used. I use to view strix GPUs as the very best along with EVGA Ftw models, but Asus messed that up with their defective strix 5700xt they took months to acknowledge.  They mostly got away with that as everyone with that GPU took to fixing it themselves including myself. So yeah, Asus been overpriced and often unreliable with GPUs as well.
Same here i bought Asus motherboard. It's pins was damaged. They didn't replaced or refunded. i lost my money. i hate Asus.
Glad I just got a MSI board for my first build!
I bought ASUS with X570 chipset.  I have bluescreens almost every day now. USB disconnecting, all kinds of weirdness.  RAM memory that is on the supported list are not actually compatible and must run at low clock or the bluescreens will increase to 10+ a day. Stutter and freeze lag in games and applications was a problem for a long time until they fixed BIOS. There have been over 10 BIOS updates to fix all kinds of chaos and it's just one problem after another. I used ASUS for every build the last 15 years but after this I'm not buying them again.  I'm afraid the motherboard have damaged my CPU or memory as the bluescreens never go away.
so here's my question as a not-mega-involved builder....what's the best supportive brand now for higher end chipsets and features?  Asrock?  I hear bad about MSI and others as well.  I agree 110% with calling out Asus, having used their boards 80% of my past builds going back into the 90's, but i don't track what's what nowadays.  I just build a new one every 2-3 years as needed.
Does this mean you won’t use any asus products from now on? If so is it only for the motherboards or all Asia branded things
cJust look at the Rog Ally now, SD cards frying left and right. It's almost like they just don't care. BTW would love a video getting more word out on their latest Quality failure the Rog Ally.
Bro…  Long story short after my XG mobile died two days after use.. I went as far as getting in touch with the office of the CEO and they told me the same thing level 1 support did and pretty much said f you good luck. You have your options.   What an absolute joke. This company is worth billions and yet the customer focus and experience is non existent. I spent 900 bucks just to me told to bad…   DO NOT BUY FROM ASYS
Shit i used to love asus, now.i dont know who to go with for a motherboard on my next build. Previously, asus stuff always lasted me way longer than it needed to.  I need to find a new brand to trust to house an i7 13700kf that i plan to buy
I have a Rog Strix Z790-E Gaming WIFI motherboard that died completely after 3 months. I am RMAing with ASUS now. Will update how it goes. But, I'm not very hopeful.
I have an hero 7, ethernet port went bad 1yr in.
Had an Asus mother board in the cart, went to look for reviews on it and this came up.  Removed the motherboard from the cart, replaced it with an MSI board.  Cheers.
Damn. Now I'm nervous. I just RMA'd an Asus board (z790 chipset) last week. I hope I don't end up dealing with the mess you described. Fingers crossed.
Gaming laptops ok still ?
I agreed,I have the asus tuf 670E plus wifi and im having problems with it. Is glitching so back.
Geneation failours. You know, new generations of employees. Failed new workers.  Workers who hires new workers, that failes. Seen it to often.....
I couldn't agree more. I purchased ASUS boards for most all of my builds and it was a superior product for a long time but the company has completely gone downhill. Support doesn't exist anymore.
I definitely have not been happy with my Strix X-470-F Gaming board from 5 years ago.  I need to upgrade this R7 2700X.  Guessing my next board will be ASRock, but I have another issue.  I need a board that has an X8 PCI-E slot for my RAID card and it doesn't seem like any of the current boards have the 2nd PCI-E slot running at X8, only X4, which is bad for the RAID card.
i gived up on Asus years ago
3rd wall? 4th wall? it takes 7 boards from asus to get a good one. LMAO good one jay.
I ONLY use EVGA  motherboards , yes they are plain and just nuts and bolt motherboards BUT , they are high quality with the best parts possible , been using them for like 15 years never once a problem .. and great customer service .. shame they stopped video cards but their motherboards are rock solid .. EVGA for life 👍
Don't let me even start saying what a piece of crap their software has been all these years, and still unstable and buggy af
great informative video
I see that after we just got 50+ Asus mobos at work lol. Eh, wasn't the one to insist on Asus at least
Also an MSI guy here.  Last two builds used MSI and haven't had any issues.  My video card is EVGA, sadly...so my next build will need a new card, which is looking like it won't be ASUS if these shenanigans continue.
I like MSI, I have no need for anything ASUS.. already ditched the old ASUS GPUs
Been working on my friends ITX build, had to go through 3 ASUS MBs.  2 arrived with already bent pins.  Third board posted for the first few boots, then stopped after without me making any changes in the build.  This is ridiculous not even the voltage, but somethings got to be horribly wrong to get 2/3 boards arriving already damaged.  Not to mention, I opened the second MB and it looked as if it were already used, dust, water/liquid marks, the screw holes were stripped around the edges.  What the hell is going on
Is Asus and AMD different?? Is getting an AMD Ryzen laptop a good idea ??
Doesnt surprise me. Ive heard a lot of bad stuff about ASUS the last couple of years and im not even a nerdy hardware guy. just someone whos casually interested in the technology. sadly theres no other product range that comes even close to looking as cool as the rog strix series in my opinion. feels bad to actually wanting to buy something because it looks really cool but you know youve probably gonna have problems with it. any recommendations for a 4070ti or similar card with a similar amount of rgb?
Well done Jay and what you are doing is very much appreciated by the average users.
First Jay has Zero knowledge in tech and 2nd his so called dumping Asus is funny. His taking umm yeah taking inventory is income. Lie on.. Requested board for a thief...not an influencer or creator.. Nice try
I got a gigabyte after seeing these videos
Asus aside, the whole rma to influencer argument is a 1st world problem if I ever heard it. The truth is the majority of returns of any motherboard, ram, or other internal component are due to novice builders buying incompatible products to their build and buyers remorse. That being said, sending a tested rma to review is wise and should be considered a gift horse.
You earned my subscription.
This is sad to hear ASUS is always been my favorite PC parts company
THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!
So I wanted to build my first Zen 4 PC and ran into trouble with both MSI and Gigabyte motherboards.  In both instances, their support came to the conclusion that the motherboards were defective. Returned them for a refund and purchased a new ASUS motherboard and it was fine other than it would not boot due to a dead CMOS battery.  Other than that easily fixable issue, ASUS products have been very satisfactory for me.
Is this Asus AMD mother boards only? Or Intel as well?
As a long time ASUS user and former fanboy that started to experience the ASUS bullshit slide a couple years ago, it's awesome to see more and more content creators drop them.
This is not the only corporation like this.  The problem is that there are to many customers and there will be more customers tomorrow so these corporations don't have to care.  If they did care it would show.
Im planing to buy ROG ally, but honestly after this.... No...
Asus found a way to get out of fixing my motherboard with extended warranty...
You say their graphics card are fine, but my Asus RTX 2080 Super just died last week, I haven't had a GPU die on me since 2005. Going back to MSI now for all my hardware
I was looking for which motherboards to get. This was very helpful. Actual experience and details really helps. Now I know which ones not to get
So pretty much the Z790 Asus boards aren’t the smart choice?? /:
I was about to buy a pretty pricey laptop to game and edit on when the kiddo was using the desktop but not now that's for sure
Yea but if you’re a very small channel and if only asus is the only company you’re being sponsored in I highly doubt you’d “fire” them.. now that you got all the fame and fortune you can do this. Imagine a small YouTube channel saying this. Yea right I doubt that’s even an option.
i would only buy Nvidia GPUs, AMD CPUs and Asus ROG Strix Motherboards.  i would stay far away from Gigabyte products, literally all of their products.  my 1st GPU was a Gigabyte, it failed in the 1st 2 weeks and they refused to do anything about it.  but now, i will avoid ASUS at all costs.   ive seen the images of boards and chips burning up.  i liked MSI boards until upgrading to AM5, and now its literally a 30 second boot time, compared to a sub 10 second boot time with AM4.  so what, now id my only option to buy a Gigabyte board?  wtf ASUS
wish I had seen this before I dropped 600 bucks on an ASUS board. shame on me. lol
TBH I dropped ASUS quite a few years ago now. They probably took longer for their high end motherboard/video card market segment to get affected by the rot, but consumer Asus equipment has been flaky for a while now. In my experience as an industry tech supporting customers and recommending equipment, Asus have represented the highest rate of returns even including early tp-link stuff and acer (which is saying something because acer are pretty crud) and others. Okay so it's not the design or intent; when their tech works it's great stuff. But there is some kind of issue with their quality control because the rate of lemons is too high. Too high for me to comfortably recommend it to my customers. Especially when there are perfectly good alternatives.
Will Asus become another SOYO?
hot damn, i was almost about to pull the trigger on a ROG ally.. i know i know, not the same thing.. but if they can fuck consumers over motherboards, i'm pretty sure they'll do the same with any of their products.. dodged a bullet with this one...
I've been having issues with ASUS since all the way back when the Ryzen 2700x launched, I RMA'ed 2 separate boards, and once I got the 3rd board and it still didn't work, I bought a much cheaper Gigabyte board that I'm still running with 0 problems today. They used to be the shit, but now they're just shit.
This is what I like about Jay. He's direct to the point! Good job boss. Stay that way. ^_^
I bought an ASUS monitor for my first gaming pc about 5 years ago. Within 6 months a bug occurred where the monitor resets itself every time you power it on. Apparently after researching it was a known issue that could not be fixed at home and had to be sent in. Granted I could have sent it in but I didn’t want to be out a whole month without gaming. the fact that this bug was known and the monitors were still sold left me salty. Apparently this was the beginning of qc problems. I don’t like hating on things. Hopefully they fix themselves
Oh boy, I have a x670e extreme still in box for the am5 build I'm gathering parts for ...
In all fairness, this is why I never buy any tech until it is at least 12 months after release. NO company makes anything 100% bug-free on release.  I'm not defending ASUS, by any means, for anything they've done. It's just my policy that I want reviews on stuff before I touch anything, or even consider buying it.
Recently discovered my ROG Strix z690-F fried my CPU which was the reason for my GPU issues. ASUS support didn’t help at all, gave me the wrong information for the wrong issue for the wrong board. It’s a shame that ASUS shat the bed so hard they used to make killer laptops and pc components
bye felicia.. asus still a billion dollar company without you
Thank you for giving me 1 more reason I unsubbed. Shill.
1 month latter....
I bought a ASUS tuf mark 2 few years ago. Never used. i opened this year for build a PC. The socket has missing pins . The worse is i bough a good processor too and when installed some socket pins broke by the pressure (what material is now using for build this thing (it's weak)) can't return because time and is a waste of materials and parts. it was a LGA 2066 so you imagine how many pins this thing has. Well i ended purchasing a other motherboard lga 1700 with a new processor. Hope i has luck this time.
Sadly I have to agree with you on this. My first pc had a rog crosshair iii and i've stuck with asus as my main mobo brand for every build i've done for myself. but ever since the am4 generation came i've had nothing but bad experiences when it came to asus mobos. like you said it took me 3 rmas to get a mobo that wouldnt die and by the time i had one that didnt just randomly die they had already released a v2 version of the same board
Guess I am lucky for the last 15-20 years of buying only asus
F
Damn just ordered a asus motherboard yesterday and today i saw this video pop up. Thinking about returning it now, its a x570, should I be worried?
My asrock 570 taichi is a pillar. Running a 4089 and. R7x3d.
I Love Asus but... im to poor to buy :/
I just bought an asrock motherboard it's my second board from them everything else have been Asus. I don't understand why a debug light and power button requires $400 plus on any other board. If Asrock can do it they all can and I don't mind paying more but not $300 more.
I had problems with my first asus rog strix mobo/pc build.  They told me a bunch of baloney so I went with a Gigabyte mobo on my upgrade.  I have had 0 problems with it.  Kind of crazy for me to see that both you and Steve doing this as well.
Dang took you 7min to get to the point *unsubscribed*. You absolute walnut...
Asrock has been my only board pretty much. It's annoying that people act as if they are all low quality. I had a 3820 and upgraded to a 3930k which I ran until Feb of this year. Overclocked both of them hard, never had an issue with x79 extreme 4m. For an HEDT board to have quad channel ram, a not so good VRM, and hold out at 4.7-4.9ghz on a 24/7 overclock for about a decade straight.... for $215 bucks, seems pretty good to me!  I got a Gigabyte board this time and while it works fine for being a cheaper z790 option, it notice it coil whines so bad. Louder than my old asrocks SBfan sometimes. I would have gone Asrock again but the feature set for these gen boards is so out of whack IMHO. I wasn't about to give up my indestructible backup ps2 periphs just because someone wants to spend my money on flashing RGB.
The x570 Tuf boards are problematic and you should never enable any auto overclocking or boosting because you will get crazy voltage and temp spikes. 3800x sits at 60 celcius then jumps to 80 in a millisecond then slowly back down to 60 then jump again. It cycles like that based on demand and you can hear the cpu fan cycle also. It never ever just hums it always cycles when gaming. Instead of overclocking a option to fix is to just cap the voltage in Ryzen Master. I have seen the voltage go up to 1.68v in software sensors as it cycles and that explains the 80 celcius jumps. What all this means is that anyone who just builds without overclocking is actually hurting their cpu more than setting a normal overclock because the cpu is constantly heating and cooling in cycles degrading the cpu quicker than constant steady temperatures.
So...should i avoid getting Asus rog ally?....
Steve is too in love with his hair.
i can assure you ASUS support has not improved at all whatsoever.  I'm being denied a refund on my Z690 Formula board that was affected by the corrosion issue....even though it still states on their website that they will refund all affected customers....
Thx
After watching GNs video on the CPU failure. Couldn't the MB cause the issues they had with the AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3d? They were using a ASUS MB
Hello MSI.
Well sh!t. Just finished the hardware side of a new build with all AMD/ASUS parts. Ryzen 9 7950X, X670E Crosshair Hero, ROG Strix RTX 4080 OC. Hasn't been powered up yet. Fingers crossed I guess.
I had puchased an Asus motherboard product within the manufacturer warranty Asus declined to help.   I thought maybe it was a Hard Drive issue, or a Bios issue,  having spent a fortune on the motherboard I couldn't be sure on the issue.   Asus denied any faults and would not help even though, it was in warranty. The system kept freezing, I had black and white squares on my monitor, I couldn't understand the fault. Things would fail. I decided to buy a new motherboard, I went with a different brand,   When I tried to install the ethernet cable, the component of the board tray seemed too small. I used the wi-fi but there was a loud whistling noise from the motherboard component, I sent it back and got my money back, I decided to try Asus once more and this time the product I have to say is really good, no issues,   I was thinking of selling the computer going with a higher end of Asus, but hearing about this, I don't think I'll bother.   Thank you for helping me decide and I definitely will stay well clear of Asus from now on.
So if i have an am5 asus board and a ryzen 7000 series... The board might fry my cpu? Or is it just specific boards with specific cpus? Is there a list somewhere with known combinations that fry the cpu?
Asus x570p is literally the worst experience ive ever had. Bin worthy
He said "Hey Zeus"
hey Jay. What kind of video card would I need for my pc. MB= MSI B 550. Cpu AMD Ryzen 5 5600  core. DDR 4 3200 Mhz 2x16 GB. Nvidia Geforce GT 710
i learned from you tech guys to always update the pc to latest , bought a 4k pc and 7 months later saw the latest bios and i updated the bios and bye bye my new pc ,lucky me had 3 months of warrany otherwise i was fkd , all i can say was wtf thanks for the video 👌👏
I'm glad i swa this before i just bought new hardware yeasterday. I was about to buy Asus again and now i went MSI instead.
THANKS jay you have saved me over 2000 dollars by dropping asux.
"Beta BIOS" is functionally the same as beta games where "Well, we weren't actually promising a functional full release, so we weren't obliged to try."
WOW, what a damming video to ASUS, very sad.  I am still running my ASUS P8Z68 Deluxe motherboard with intel I7 must be going on over 15 years and still trucking.  I have done a few upgrades like going from HD to SSD (much faster) and adding a water cooler to the intel CPU to avoid heating and crashes when rendering HD video at the time.  Not supporting Windows 11, I have considered a new and maybe last build sine I am 65 and the 2 builds have worked a long time, especially this current one.  However, I have enjoyed your postings and trust your take on the market and vendors.  Guess if I build my next one and start looking more at the MSI and Gigabyte motherboards. I do have a question for you on my water cooler. This is an Intel water cooler, I have never broke it open to check for fluid levels, believing it is a sealed system and should be fine.  Would this e a BAD ASSUMPTION?  Does not seem to have any problems, it is on all the time and just that once in a blue moon where it crashes or I leave a USB Stick in the USB port and it won’t reboot (once removed works fine).  JAYZ. Thanks for all the input you have provided in all your video, they have been enjoyable!!  😊
I had problems with all of em MSI Asus gigabyte they are all the same
Well I WAS going to buy an ASUS Mobo and GPU but now I think I'll skip on that. I don't like what they're doing and how they put out bad products.
i moved over to professional "off the shelf" workstations many years ago because of massive instabilities in motherboards for custom built machines.
i bought asus b650 plus a week ago should i be worried after watching this video😮
To be honest man Asus customer support is atrocious. I had an aero 15 only a couple months later for the RTX 3080 GPU to crap out. Then it switched over to Intel graphics. I would not see nothing on the device manager. And to try to flash a bios on their laptops good luck. You're fucked. I would stay away from asus
he talks about motherboards right? I wanna ask if it also applies to phones because I'm thinking of getting the Rog 7 ultimate?
Bought z790 e-gaming wifi half year ago and since that time had a problem with one slot of DIMM and bluetooth
interesting since asrocks is also an asus product
I was not happy with my last newegg/asus motherboard experience. I purchased 3 formula board and every one had bent pins.. One was just a couple that I was able to fix under magnification, but this is ridiculous
It really sucks too because ASUS used to be an absolute pinnacle of consumer-sided, gamer focused products. Of course, every company has had bad products among great ones, but it's genuinely sad to see such a decline. It will likely affect all their product, including their gaming monitors. I personally own a PG279Q, which is an excellent ASUS ROG G-Sync, but I started upgrading my 5-6 year old setup recently, buying a new PC being the big step, but now I'm looking at my monitors and...Asus has disappeared from the top of the line. LG, Dell (ffs Asus you are getting beat out by Alienware...), and Gigabyte are crushing them in tech reviews from similar channels to yours and the amazing people over at Rtings.  Blows my mind, but it's a consistent trend that when a company gets significant success from a consumer group, they almost always stab the consumer in the back later down the line. Which is why "brand loyalty" has and always will be stupid. Personally, I'll definitely staying far away from Asus products on all fronts until they can actually prove that they are back in the gamer business.
Honestly, with all the trouble Asus software has given me, screw Asus and screw their products!
Asus died for me last year when I built my current PC. Kudos Jay. My my B550 w/ Ryzen 5 has had very weird issues with RAM stability since I got it. I somehow got it to pass testmem5 eventually, only to become unstable all of a sudden a few months later(it reboots maybe once a week on average, still usable but officially the worst PC I've ever built out of many). I decided I'll be replacing the board eventually to alleviate the problem. I'm just finding out about this Asus thing now but it lowkey explains some things to me.
EVGA doesn't do GPUs anymore. ASUS trash according to this video. What is the next best brand now?
heh, i have asus mb and asus rtx 4080 and i asked them if the coil whine is intended (really loud in rdr2, somewhat in few new games but faint) answer was "yes they do that, call us if it breaks" it is really intrusive to me but i guess they have deaf testers. second, i tried to use my BT headphones and it breaks every 5 seconds which is unacceptable and they said "update bios" even tho i said i have the latest version. all in all, my sh*t works but not as it should and the customer service is garbage a t best
Asrock has always made good boards.  I have some from 2011 never an issue very reliable.  I have had issues with Asus boards in the past 10 years though.  Never has been my first choice.
No more asus for me on MB or Routers.  Sad because they made great routers.  One of the reasons I don't mess with consumer boards anymore preferring to use server and workstation w ecc.  They are over built not to fail vs consumer that are built sometimes on the edge with poor quality control.
YUP MY  last mother board had the usb c port burned after 3 moths  F me
I was in the process of building a new gaming PC thanks for the insights. As a disabled vet, I can’t afford stuff i depend on to crap out. I won’t be putting any Asus products in my  build.
Their Logo is an EYE and a G.
Bad leadership at the very top, it really is as simple as that. Asus used to be one of my go to brands, but I've had similar issues with their products recently. No idea if there is a board of directors involved in Asus, but something has to change.
durr I'm being AMD'd is the dumbest shit
I had good experience with ASUS GPU, but I bought ASUS M/B and was disappointed. I got burnt by Gigabyte so I don't use that either. MSI or ASROCK seems better choice nowadays.
I watched your video it was too late. My regret period expired yesterday. would trade Rog Crosshair X670e Hero for Asrock X670E Taichi
no more ASUS for me i have x670e prime wifi and it will be my last item i buy from asus
its not a cap that was installed back words its a diod
3.9 Million viewer's do Asus!
I bursted out launghing when you said you ordered the white mobo for the 3rd time and got a black one instead
Jay you're fired.
Lead the charge! They won't pay attention until they start losing market share (read: money). If enough computer build streamers/channels/whatever start doing this and people steer away from ASUS and to their competitors, they'll be forced to respond.
Thank goodness for this video.  I was probably going to go with another ASUS board.  I guess I am using one of the last good generations.
Stunning! Those "mistakes" MUST be quickly remedied by any competent business. What the hell is going on, ASUS? Perhaps the do it yourself PC builds are becoming a thing of history.
gr8 video show those motherfcorporations that they are nothing without customers they want to f.....k
I RMA'd an Asus ROG motherboard in 2018.  I received a used unit in return.  I tried for a while to deal with their customer support to get an actual new unit, but I gave up in frustration and simply vowed to never buy another Asus product.
I love my rog but i cant agree more about the software support
Oof I have an Asus ROG strix monitor b550F motherboard and an Asus 3080TI I hope I'm in the clear
well shit, I just bought an Asus TUF F15
Your video just saved me a lot of money and heartache as I almost purchased the ROG Rapture GT6’s last night for my daughter. She is autistic and she’s getting into the gaming but our Wi-Fi just won’t cut it.  Had internet guys out to run her a direct line but couldn’t due to old phone lines in the house, built in the 70’s. Told me I needed to get a mesh network.  I have no knowledge about anything on this but started trying to research it. It’s too much for me to understand. Can anyone help me and tell me of a good one? I need one that has 3. Our house is a ranch style and the modem? And her computer is all on one side of the house.
Very interesting to watch love the info. I have always been an asus fan and have never had any issues with anything ive ever gotten. I just did a rebuild 8 months ago with a Z690 Maximus hero  and before that i had a Z490-E and all my graphic cards have been asus from 1060, 2070 super, 3080, to a 4080 but next time i do a rebuild i will deffinitly be doing a double check and a little more research!
I used to get the latest tech asap, but now it's like... I will just wait a few months or even years. I get to upgrade for cheaper, and I won't get rekt by these greedy companies rushing out garbage.
Damn. And I was just becoming a big fan of Asus...I was getting ready to get an Asus motherboard and graphics card for my first PC build....better run back to the drawing board. ☹️
Gg
Is this just Happening on one ASUS board or multiple boards?
gigabyte>
Did you fire AMD for selling faulty CPUs ??
I don't really understand why companies think that deception and information suppression work better for your brand image than honesty.  Like, as a consumer of any product, I would be far more likely to continue buying products from a manufacturer that issued a recall as publicly as possible.  Not only do I likely get a free replacement, but they are standing behind the quality of their product, at their own expense.  I know that if there is a problem with something I buy from them, they will make it right.  When I see a company hushing up their own mistakes in order to save money, I will immediately stop trusting any products they put out, because who knows how many issues they will cover up in the future?  All trust is lost.  They will end up losing money by losing my future purchases, even if I never bought anything from them that was broken.
I use a Rog Strix laptop for work as an animator, they are beautiful on the outside. But thank God I got the warranty, because one day the CPU just crapped out for no reason like 6 months in. Got a full replacement to the newer model. Tbh would not buy from them again
So whats a good brand? When 50 series come out, my rig will be closing in at 7 years. I was gonna go Asus since EVGA is out of the game.
I dont know what I am going to do for my next build.  I always purchased EVGA video cards and ASUS Mobos.  So sad to see ASUS nosedive like this.
I was planning to go with an Asus board for my next build, but looks like I'll stick with either Gigabyte or MSI.
Been using Asus since 1995 original Pentium , but sticked to MSI for the last two generations, have 3 systems, all MSI, no problem
This is the kind of content we need. "We don't grade brands on their problems. We grade brands on how they handle those problems". And that statement captures everything a supplying company needs to know and do when they claim to "put the customer first in all we do". Well said, JayZ.
Nah these were review boards. It's just that Linus got to them first 😂
I was a big fan of MSI but two RMAs later for my gaming laptop, having loose screws inside was the last straw, many brands are doing this to themselves. HTC comes to mind!
Sounds like there subcontracting everything..
I have an Asrock Xtreme X99. Been so reliable for the last 15 years. Think it takes time for brand consistency to filter through. As with Hyundai and Kia for cars etc.
I support work . Everyone is an asshole at 7
Asus goes through these cycles
Sim Racing YouTubers need to do this with Fanatec 😂   Soooooo who can we trust MSI??? I’m new to this and was looking at ASUS but not anymore after this
Thanks for the video. I had a very good opinion about Asus until now and they have (had) a lot of good products. I guess I'll skip them when upgrading next time.
no no... Jay you are fired. Asus will always be my top dog. Love my Z590E, and every other asus board ive ever owned.
And this is why I refuse to buy the ROG Ally. Asus isn't reliable anymore. Steam deck ftw
Has this gotten any legal repercussions from ASUS?  I’ve seen in other businesses, when brands gets damaged they tend to sue.  Companies can’t handle the truth that’s why they have legal teams…
Asus is becoming such a scam as a company! Thanks to Asus Ive had the worst experience ever in my life with a piece of technology!  I bought an ROG Zephyrus M16 for 3000$ in April last year.  In April this year the GPU fan startet rattling. So i turned it in to RMA (i couldve fixed it myself no problem in 5 minutes, but I didnt want to void my warranty). After 2 weeks it came back with severe overheating problems! The fans were normal, but the GPU instantly hit the 87°C threshold when hitting it with normal workloads. It even went up to 100°C several times. Because of the overheating it clocks down to 210MHz all the time. I was lucky to have a 3D Mark Firestrike Benchmark back when i had it new where it scored like 23000. Now its always down to 4000-10000. Thats like half to 75% performance lost.  When I first got it after RMA i inspected the insides and the workers removed the whole cooling plate which was defenitely not necessary! They were even to lazy to put a new warranty sticker on there after screwing on one.  I was so upset and had to discuss 2 weeks with the support, that the laptop was damaged in RMA and they should fix the issue. I am dependent on the laptop for architecture renders, but the support didnt seem to give a sh1t about my time.   So after 1 month having trouble i got it back from the second RMA.  They didnt do anything to it and just sent it back with the RMA diagnosis: "No hardware defect was detected. The issue couldnt be reproduced" This message is so hilarious. I sent them 2 pages of information with the issue and how to reproduce it and they just straight up ignored everything.  I wasnt accepting it and sent it in a 3rd time with a statement, that they must reproduce the issue when hitting the gpu with load!. Well guess what. -> "No hardware defect was detected. The issue couldnt be reproduced". And guess also: The issue still persists. Still overheating.  After talking with the support on why the hell they are to stupid to reproduce the issue they told me, that they even did a furmark benchmark. Yeah and? They didnt tell me the scores or any temps. Of course the Laptop survives furmark, its thermal throttling, not frying itself. Duh! They refused to do a Firestrike Benchmark stating "it survived furmark so why another benachmark" even though i told them, i have evidence regarding the problem on that benchmark.  I am now at a point where I have had enough of Asus and there scamming RMA tactics.   I am in contact with my lawyer and will bring it to court. F this company. 3 Months of permanent trouble. Im in my masterclass of studies rn. Every month of not working counts so i already went out and built my own PC to work on. Of course without any Asus parts lol  If anyone reads this and also has an Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 with a 12900H and a 3070ti, please do a Firestrike benchmark and send me the scores. I need backup from working similar models to bring top court probably!
my asus laptop is so old ryzen 5 5600m vega and a gtx 1050 xd but still runs great even with the cpu fan dying out because of the copper heat synch between the gpu and cpu has been enough to keep it cool enough to now shut down or throttle horribly. that being said this thing is like ten years old and ASUS was a different company back then. never been so happy with a laptop purchase before and i've moved on to a more  modern desktop, but it will always have a soft spot in my heart.
I have been calling ASUS products Ripping Off Gamers since 2 of their "premium" motherboards failed within a year for me. Made the switch to Gigabyte due to GN's deepdive videos praising the quality of the components on Gigabyte boards and have never looked back.
I'm not very tech savvy but after having recently getting my pc built with a strix z690-F gaming wifi motherboard about a month ago, this doesn't give me a lot of confidence that I made a smart purchase. I know he talks about the z690 hero motherboard specificially but can someone who knows their stuff tell me should I be worried with the z690 gaming motherboard as well or are they less failing prone to the hero version?
I have a ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-G GAMING motherboard with right at 22,000 hours on it and not a single issue, ever. I wonder if I'll be surprised. And yes, its been stressed many, many times with the i7-8700K onboard and the 32GB of Corsair memory. Thank you for the heads up about Asus because I'm just beginning to spec out a new computer, and it looks like no Asus. Companies go downhill, we've all seen it over and over.
The over volting has been going for over a decade...Out the box Asus motherboards would void your warranty. I have had more high end Asus boards RMA'd than any other brand. But still the Asus fanboys pile up. I have very little sympathy for Asus clients. They have been doing this for many years but the fanboys refused to listen. This is no different than Dieselgate where VW and co would sell more vehicles pretending to abide by the same laws as their competition.
Yeah i dropped 7 grand on a system with a 700.00 Asus motherboard and 6900xt and its been the biggest pain in the ass with not posting due to vga bios errors.
I've had ASUS mobo's for about 10 years now. And have literally held off upgrading to the 7950x because of mobo's killing the CPU's. HIgh prices seem to not mean good quality products anymore. A shame, but kudos to you for standing by your own standards 👍👍
I get what you are saying, but you do come across as an arrogant "influencer" who wants things for free. Kind of like a spoiled child.
Nearly 2 million views. It must have been a blow to the company. Let's hope so. With this, maybe something will change in their operating policy.
I still have my ASUS.........I am not happy with it, but it's all I have.
so recently my PC wouldn't switch on (or at least that was the initial thought for obvious reasons). Press the on button and nothing. Checked the usual things and eventually got it to run but not post. Thought it could be the controller of the front panel so I tried turning it on by the pins. After a while of not being on, it would not turn on again. Over the weekend I tried the pins and nothing. I just left it. Sometime within the next 30 min thereafter I noticed that the PC was running (still no post). My research naturally changed to a "delay" in turning on and I found a few people complaining about the same thing. Each of them with ASUS boards. Ended up ordering an MSI one instead.
Sadly i didnt see this earlier, my asus rog motherboard is garbage. Newest Bios - Random pc restarts. 1 version older Bios, ethernet problems, constantly losing connection to the internet. Jesus
AsRock is owned by Asus in case Jay doesnt know. AsRock intent is a subsidiary to compete on the cheaper side.
I was a huge Asus fan boy when am doing my system 90% of the parts are Asus but recently my new build I went to msi hell even got the deep cool AIO and it's solid and affordable and everything is so stable I never had any issues to this date and it's been like 4 months so far hope it continues to be as is  for many more months to come.
1:14 nice dub
i was on a msi intel 10th gen and that was really soild i had no bluescreens only times i got bluescreens was when i started being stupid and overclocked it 5 some ghz on a 650 watt psu and after switching to amd ryzen 5000 on a asus board i kept getting bluescreens just for staying on the desktop
Avoid ASUS like the plague, got it👍
I've been out of PC building for about 5 years. I just ordered a full build, and went Asus for MoBo / GPU, and Monitor. Just processed all the returns and ordered MSI for replacements. Thank for the assistance! I appreciate a person of integrity.
Meanwhile my B550F AM4 socket runs and guns day in and day out 😘
Thank you, I share the reason you mentioned about ASUS. I trust your deontology so, for me ASUS is over
I just built my first pc and am new to the scene, I got a z590 Wi-Fi plus asus motherboard should I be worried at all ??
Thanks for this video Jay.  When I built PC's back in the 90's Asus was a big name back then.  My boss bought Gigabyte MB's for most of our computer builds, mainly to keep the price down.  I am considering buying some parts for a gaming PC for myself and was looking at Asus once again, but your video has changed my mind.  I'll give Gigabyte another look (heck they are still less expensive in price up here on Canada), or even MSI for my future gaming PC build.  Your honesty and antidotal stories are appreciated.
@Jayztwocents, OK so we now know ASUS is shit. What motherboard do you recommend for a gaming build in 2023? Seriously, all you said was “Asrock” and that’s it. Can you please post a video highlighting your gaming MB picks for 2023
Wow this actually puts into context so many of the issues I’ve been having with my ASUS builds. Going MSI from now on. Bye ASUS.
I remember the day ASUS made some great MBs (back in the 90s). Once they went into Laptop and PC (gaming oriented) I gave it a try and never had any issues there either. I am using Asus screens since 2012 and this is my 2nd one (first one gave up the Ghost after 8 years), thus, I as a consumer, although I am not a Asus Fanboi, I will however not consider any shops that do not offer Asus products. They make excellent products and not being able to first hand see and compare, I cannot spend money there.
Im kinda spooked. So is Gigabyte a brand I an trust? I wanted to do an AMD build
Acer should hit the heat sink while it's hot in the absence of Asus. After inviting Steve to their HQ promoting their new GPU, Acer should touch base with Jay.
I always choosen MSI over ASUS, no particular reason. I'm glad I did.
it seems that more and more companies are turning into trash tier
ASUS is run by incompetent baby boomers gen
Thanks Jay. I'm going back to MSI for my next build
Sounds like they have bad QC
So, what is the best brand for Ryzen?
Are there any solutions for this as of June?
Asus = A Suspect! A lot of Sus.... What else is new?
ASUS is the blizzard of PC hardware
I am so glad that I just upgraded, and my builds are usually last 8 to 9 years.
currently rocking an x570 ive had problems since I got it, it might be time to upgrade
Huge damn respect
I love Asus I've never had any problem with them
Last time buying Asus. Thanks man!
I’m so glad i decided to stick with AM4 instead of upgrading to AM5. Zero intention on upgrading for at least another 3 years.
I have returned 3 motherboards for ASUS in 10 days non of them worked on 13600kf and I'm waiting for the fifth one because gigabyte motherboard was always give me bluescreen with my ddr5 i hope this one works i really hated my new pc because of it
Wow, it explain a LOT ! Thx for this ! Personal experience : I have an 2021 Asus Zephyrus G14 laptop, specs are amazing but the Armoury Crate software is pure garbage. It overides anything I tried to setup to get full performance when working on battery. Even uninstalled, my fan is running high for 10min at each boot, even ice cold cpu/gpu. Like the app is still runnning lowkey. And when using their Armoury Crate, it allows components to run overclocked when asking full performance. It's really strange way to setup their products =/
Wow - What a major stand. Thanks for being willing to do this. I have always respected you and your channel - this just makes it go up 1000%. As a major content creator and consumer supporter. During all of these troubles with hardware that have come to be - If you had an Asus MB that was an ROG model but from another series ; say the PROART line ; would you switch out that mb to a different brand so that you wouldn't be using an Asus product anymore?
There is still a problem with the Aura Sync on my X570. It turns constantly off. 🤣 😅 I reinstalled Windows 9 times and ASUS still says, i need to reinstall it. 😅  Ahh forgot to say that no soundcard is working on it properly. 🤷🏻‍♂️ After that video, i never buy ASUS stuff again. Thx for sharing.
I hope that NVIDIA gets the same treatment.
Jayz thanks for all you do I have to make time to read more of your reviews prior purchases
JZ MY LUCK READ YOUR REVIEW ON ASUS AFTER MADE THE PURCHASE I WILL SEND THEM A LETTER ON YOUR REVIEW HOPING I WONT HAVE TO RETURN THE UNIT BUT WHEN I START TO HAVE ISSUES  NO OTHER RECOURSE WAY TOO MUCH$$$$   Stephen Jayz Two cents
i got the ASUS STRIX GAMER LAPTOP "NOTEBOOK"
Down with Asus I quit years ago due their customer service.
And then there is noctua who send LGA 1700 mounting kits to any customer who bought a cpu cooler, free of charge.
Oh, God, the zoom in/out way overdone, and too fast. It's like watching the Banana Splits, but at least they were smart enough to stop the seasick-style zoom after a few seconds. Stopped at 7:06.
Great.... I just bought an ASUS GPU :|
15:25 lol, sure. It's obviously more like "We don't grade brands on their problems, we grade brands on how they handle sponsorship contracts"  Watch what will happen when ASUS offer him tons of money for some sponsorship, it will be like "guys, you remember ASUS failing on me while trying to game on live stream? Yeah, it was not ASUS, it was my faulty HDD that actually was from some other company that didn't want sponsorship"
I really hope Evga comes back with there Graphics cards!!  At least they cared
So glad you have posted this. I have an ASUS ROG Rampage VI Extreme and since its build 5 ish years ago, all I have had is random crashes. Could be playing a game, or just sitting there with nothing open.  Shame I grabbed an ASUS gfx card, but defo wont be buying ASUS again. Thanks
Honestly, I've run into other problems with ROG as well.   I bought a laptop, mouse, and cetra 2 wireless headphones all at the same time from ROG.  Within 6 months, the mouse was dead, and the headphones won't charge anymore.  No bluetooth connects on my laptop, including the ROG wireless headphones and the ROG mouse....you'd think ROG devices would have no problems connecting to an ROG laptop....Also, the USB ports on my laptop are...finicky, at best.  Half the time I have to constantly attach my USB drives and my mouse constantly disconnects, but just for like a second.  The price I paid for these things, you could easily get equipment.  Also, trying to get help replacing the parts is impossible, because when I connected to the ROG website, the maintenance sends me to ASUS and then they don't know what to do because they are ASUS, not ROG.  (So they told me).  I just gave up.  I'll never buy ASUS or ROG again.  You can get better gear for cheaper from other places.
I've been struggling with an ASUS Prime Z790-P WIFI D4.  It simply won't post and flashes meaningless error codes on the power switch (there are no on board LED's).  After going through two motherboards this week, I'm giving up on them.  There is no way to update the BIOS since I can't get in the BIOS setup screen to apply an update (there is no USB-based BIOS update support)  I'm using a i5-12600KF CPU.  Anybody have a good alternative brand and model?
I have been pulling back from Asus for some time now with the weird issues developed all the way back with Core2Quad motherboards. When I was working, those and the Z77 motherboards just seem to stop working all of a sudden no matter if they were used for years or brand new. And Asus would just replace the new ones with some of the replacements having the same issues as the brand new ones. It has been going down hill from there.
Thanks for the heads up, was about to get a Asus z790 proart. What would be a good replacement for that?
So which brand should we move forward to? Gigabyte?
so they will drop in price? im all in for that
And I wanted sponsorship from Asus. Who cares now…
OK, no longer purchasing ASUS products - sooner or later, perhaps after they lose a few million in profits, they will get the message that you can't just unendingly crap on consumers. Thank you for the video update. Enough is enough.
Why hasn’t there been a class action lawsuit?
If Asus has any integrity, they'll restructure, focus on these issues, and let their product improvements do the talking until the wounds heal themselves. No PR bullshit, just quality. So so sad that the company has fallen to this. QA is down is nearly every industry in the world and it suuuuuucks.
Asus sucks.  I bought an ROG Strix g15 and all that's left of original parts is the motherboard.  Underpowered PSU, Cooling is sub standard, if I didn't add a quality cpu cooler and a couple other fans, this things would of caught fire.  I don't even know how they say their slogan "republic of gamers"  with a straight face. It should read as "Republic of Fools" for the fools like me that buy their crap product. LOL
Wow asus f’d up.  Will cross them off the list now.
Clearly I am not using ASUS in my new build this year. You're right any manufacturer can have issues/problems but it's how they handle them that makes the difference. I have used MSI for some time and I like the way they work. Thanks for having the courage to do this.
Just seeing this now makes me happy I did not order a new Ally and went with the steam deck. Specs are great, but only with the proper support.
this is russian roulette for PC support
The last sentence basically is what's gonna happen at ASUS HQ. They don't care. This is why I have not bought any ASUS product in years and never will. Expecially the ROG Ally.
Excellent video!!!
dragged not drug
I know this is different than a regular PC build and motherboards, but I bought a ROG Zephyrus G15 about a year and half ago and it basically broke down within a few months of ownership. Horrible screen bleed, speakers going out and then the WiFi card busted. And these engineering geniuses at Asus also decided "hey let's put the main heat outtake vent of the laptop right in the hinge and have the hot air blow right over the screen, it will be FINE". I'm fairly sure that awful excuse of a cooling system is why the hardware went bad so quickly. The biggest waste of money I've ever spent on a tech product and here I was thinking that their desktop components were at least somewhat better. But apparently Asus's piss poor quality extends there also. Downloading an essential BIOS update that stops your motherboard frying your CPU, but it's considered "beta" and therefore voids your warranty. Yeah that says everything you need to know about Asus and "The Republic of Gamers".
Two mainboards with bent pins on the cpu socket!! What That Fuck!! How steve says to asus fuck your boards!!
I was planning on a full ASUS ROG AMD build, but thanks to this vid I wont be bothering anymore and have chosen to shop around longer now
I got those same smug, unsigned emails from Corsair, after their extremely crappy keyboard software bricked my computer.
well this explains why my asus board has been acting crazy for over a year
Never...ROG rules...period
In 2019 i build myself a new gaming pc. I choose the Asus Z390 MB. The mb worked and still works fine the way it came out of the box. Following the principle "Never fix a running system" i never made any updates to the firmware. I just considered the risk of doing so not worth it. I see my opinion confirmed. You use something experimental and they will use it against you.
Has ASUS responded to this, or any of this situation since this started?
i had always problems with Gigabyte Mainboard and GPU ( 3090 ) .... lots of RMA´s
How much do you want to bet that intel is sabotaging AMD as they have done in the past. History is repeating itself.
I spended more like 5K on Asus Rog parts in 2017. Will be the latest also. But the ultimate highend is unpayble these days. I have an Rampage VI Extreme with an I9.
Why don't you just buy motherboard like the rest of us? You would still make your content and get views...just less profit i guess. Im sure ASUS is fed up with all the content creators "demanding" new stuff for free in exchange for "promotion" of the brand. Plus I would not be surprised if you get into legal problems for defaming the brand ASUS...good luck
It took 5 (five) months to repair my Asus laptop because of how long it took to deliver replacement parts to the service. I had to buy a new one because I cant wait that long, it is MSI and I hate its software and drivers... it is a mess.
My who just bought an Asus RTX 4090 watching this video while sweating, just for Jay in the last 2 minutes of the video to say "The GPU side is okay", I swear I heard a rock fall from my heart xD
As a Taiwanese, I could say that even us don't buy ASUS. They're notorious for poor quality and China-licking
S T U F F ™
bought asus tuf gaming motherboard. never seen so much bluescreens before. i like my new msi build now.
Was buying asus stuff for the last decade or so. It's sad to see them fall this way.
Note to self, never buy Asus motherboards ever again.
I'm sorry, stepdad, but you can't keep spending all of mom's money on these stupid computer toys just because the Mexican Viagra isn't working.
My current PC is old, 2017, and it's an Asus RoG build. I am looking at finally replacing it (finances suck) and after this one lasting this long with no issues, I was seriously considering getting the same, but now? I'll talk to my tech guy and look at something different
#1 reason I’ve refrained from FOMO’ing into the ASUS ROG ALLY and going for the STEAM DECK instead, Can’t Truss ‘Em!
i've been saying that amd processors are the ones that cause blue screens. after two amd processors i started buying intel and never had an issue. my amd issues date back to like 2007-2015. unfortunate that they apparently haven't gotten any better.
I was about to purchase the rog zephyrus g14 as my portable workstation but I’ll have to reconsider my choices. Any suggestions for a good amd advantage laptop?
I have an old Philips LCD display... before i thoguht.. maybe i should upgrade.. i got an asus monitor and the color were very strange.. not natural and really weird... so i returned it.. I even did the auto sync setting etc.. i just thought the colors and display was just so off and weird I did not expect that to even be an issue.. but it was..
I don't think ASUS ever needed you. You definitely won't be getting anymore exclusives from them. Oh well.
Damn, im building my first PC and though I chose the MSI over the Asus mobo, I did end up grabbing the Asus ROG Strix 4070 Ti. Hope i didn't make a big mistake - it was just a great deal at the time (unopened 4070 from my friend who only asked $625 when it normally goes for $900-1k). It's been difficult to absord everything in the PC-build universe 😂
The good news is it doesn't seem like they're giving influencers special treatment over regular customers...
Can I ask a question here?  If ASUS is no longer reliable, then what exactly is a quality mobo for a Ryzen 9 7900X and the RTX 4090?  I'm really not that knowledgeable about computer components, I just try to "future proof" every 7-10 years with the best I can get in the moment. And all the highest recommendations I've been seeing online for the Ryzen 9 and the 4090 says to go with the ASUS rog Crosshair x670e hero.   Apologies if this is a dumb question or not okay for this space. I'm just kind of at a loss and haven't got a local shop.
Top man Jayz TwoCents well done for calling  them out .
I am getting ready to build a system with an I9-13900K. Usually I use Asus but after seeing this video I no longer want to use them. Can you suggest the best Motherboard for this build?
Oh f* . I just bought an Asus  board.
Might I suggest they pull their head out of their rear end.
Sad!  ASUS _used_ to be _THE_ motherboard to buy...
I've been using Asus products for a very long time. But it's painful to hear and deal with, first hand, the problems that have come up recently. My first personal computer (PC) was an Asus Laptop. My first desktop PC that I built had an ROG CODE motherboard for 7th gen intel. Now I've got a new Asus motherboard and I'm displeased immeasurably.  This laptop has been through thick and thin, dealt with an exhaust that could possibly burn my hand, dealt with several reinstallations of windows, it's on its second charger, the original battery after 9 years is completely dead, the original hard drive has several bad sectors that I had to use software to tell the HDD not to right or read from there, and yet it still turns on and works hard.  The motherboard for my first ever custom PC build stuck with me through everything I threw at it. I had all the cooling it could ever need and took whatever speed ram I wanted without complaint. I gamed on that thing day in and day out nearly every single day. Not once did I encounter an issue with it that I did not cause myself. It still works today. My buddy has it now and still uses it.  I am now the unhappy owner of an ASUS Prime Z690-P WiFi D4 motherboard. I had to dig through the bios to force it out of RAID so I could boot into windows and needed to scour the internet digging through forums about other Prime motherboards until I found a small thread that could help me figure that out. I have used this motherboard for nearly 1 year and the biggest problem that I have with this motherboard is that within 6 months of ownership, the motherboard had become unstable. What used to run perfectly at 3200mhz now has to run at 3000. While that sounds like a small problem, I have already swapped around the 4 sticks of memory that I have and have found that one of my dimms will cause the system to crash repeatedly. Windows repair can't fix it, reinstalling Windows with a 100% brand new install wouldn't fix it, clearing the CMOS and popping out the battery to make sure it was cleared wouldn't fix it, resetting it to factory state wouldn't fix it, upgrading and downgrading bios versions didn't fix it, but as long as that 1 dimm was not populated, the system would run perfectly fine at 3200, the rated speed for my Corsair RAM. I contacted ASUS after dropping the speed down to 2400 and they escalated and then promptly dropped me with a message telling me to lower my memory frequency. Are you joking? This is a brand new motherboard still within warrantee. Now I'm hearing all about these problems ASUS has been having and it's an absolute nightmare.  All I wanted was a reliable motherboard and I shelled out a lot of money to get one. My entire system costs a third of the price of my car and this took YEARS to save up for.  ASUS, if you're reading this, I either want my money back or a new motherboard. Anything else will not due. I don't want to be given the run around again, I don't want to have to wait weeks on end for a response, I don't want to have to dig into your own bios files to try and figure out what could be wrong, I want the product I paid for to perform as advertised. Otherwise, I will abandon you. I am the primary system builder for nearly all of my friends and I would normally recommend your products or even purchase them for them. Now, you've put a rift between me and you.
Asus rog strix just out of standard waranty the loudspeakers crapped out  seems to be a common known issue verry poor material
ASUS is the Spanish pronunciation of Jesus. Therefore ASUS F***ing ASUS makes sense.
Damn i love my asus 4090 strix card
Really sad to see how idiotic beancounters destroy a great brand like Asus.
Whohooo this sounds bad i will get MSI next time i upgrade. I have trouble with the HDMI connectors on my Asus GPU some times there is no output towards my monitor. Geding no input on the monitor screen. Extreme static sound out off my speakers during Dolby Admos sound. After 28 years off Asus product its over next time MSI. BTW my GPU is Strix 4090
hey ASUS< im in the market for a new PC, and i'll be going evga because of this video. this is what you get.
My asus motherboard stoped working after a few years and to have my computer fixed would cost 11000 swedish kr Said asus. Now I never want to have asus again.
F asus. Use 2 b gud
ROG        S   tri   X
ASUS X570 board was sent 2x to another country to be fixed and still failed when I got it back. Found answer on forum the following night, a special screwdriver forum of all places. Has run for 2 months and now after a system restore it bricked and spat out Q code 9E & blank scrn. I'm trying GIGABYTE or some other struggling board maker trying to prove something and not screwing us.
after i left Sun Microsystems for each mission critical system i had to design i chose to run the best OS on the best hardware each sysboard was tested and tested . At least 15 years by now i choose to run OpenBSD on Dual 939 VSTA from asrock those were rock solid and ran few offices in Paris 24/365 for years. I very appreciate ASROCK sysboards way better than Asus,MSI and gigabyte...(far less RMA'ed on many systems i built) I just gave those  away last month ...
never had an ASUS board and have only use d MSI boards, the one i have now (MSI MPG Z690 Force Wifi LGA 1700 DDR5 ATX Motherboard) is the best boa rd i have ever used and refuse to use anything else, it is DDR5 btw so u cant use it for DDR4
Ahh.Suss...
I really love Asus especially TUFF series of stuff. but ill def be looking harder at other companies on my next build.  Just built An AMD 5900 with Asus Tuff Wifi Pro II motherboard and a 3080TI Asus Tuff, Its been rock solid since I built it in October.
your getting AMD'd this is why we buy intel  lol asus too is trash tho, good call
What's with all these brands suddenly acting suicidal out of nowhere?
Rog republic of greed, the stuff they get a way with.. This is just a feeling but its like another brands 90 euro mb that got better capacitors than the "gamer" 300 asus gaming, sure alot of extra stuff. But the skimping on small cheap stuff reminds me think of how seagate went from great to i dont trust it (2 diffrent models of hd failed 1-2 months after warranty ended, 2 weeks apart...  I do remember asrock fighting improving, updating, letning overclockers play in bios when they improverd, most dint have multiplyers unlocked (long long ago)
Simply wow - big balls!!!
A sus company: ASUS
I haven’t really followed what’s been happening. Is this only a Asus issue or other brands are having issues? Was considering making a new am5 build, now I’m not so sure.
Can someone help me out. I have a Asus board. I recently over volted my soc cpu parameter so I can raise my multipler to overclock my cpu to 4Ghz. So is this bad long term? Is that what all this Asus bad rep is all about? Also I over volted by small increment. Like 1/3 a volt. Any feed back would be much appreciated.
I had been an ASUS fan for over 10 years with 2 ROG laptops, 2 tablets and a motherboard for my server build. Sorry to hear their Customer Service has deteriorated so badly. My ROG GX72GL is ready for replacement. Guess I start looking at MSI as Alienware has gone down hill also.
ASUS is bad quality for years. I hated everything I bought from ASUS. Hardware problems, overheating notebooks under normal conditions, bad software, literally no driver updates... Never no more.
just about to pull thetrigger to buy X-670E now I'm going for MSI B650I
I fired Gigabyte years ago..worst motherboards I ever used
I haven't updated my bios since the day I built my computer in 2018.  Upgraded RAM, new gpu, etc etc etc. upgrades over time. Even a new CPU  Literally zero issue. Ever. Idk why people keep tinkering with shit.
This didn't age well. Turns out MSI, Gigabyte, Acer and maybe others have the same problem. While the warranty thing was generic and updated official🤷‍♂️
I banned MSI couple of years ago sins they cost me my company. After using MSI/gigabyte products from the X38,  up to Z170, I was a big MSI fan, build most of my client builds with msi. because of there fast RMA and mostly because they had little fails. But around the Z170 Mainboards and the 10 series GPU. MSI really stopped making working hardware and caring even less about warranty.   And so i took Asus off my black list because they were doing great around that time with there RMA and service. To be fair i used asus hardware for Pentium 1 up to X38 then there quality and service dropped, with just broken stuff coming out of the box and returns.  But i would not trust MSI for one second, Asus always solves there stuff without the courts. I got this board MSI Z170A GAMING M9 ACK form them (500 euro board ) quality of this board was more like 50 euro board.  I build 5 systems for clients and i got stuck in a loop for 1-2 year, they kept sending me broken shit. got broken RMA boards or just fabrication error board or heavily damaged boards or 75 euro crap boards as replacements.  Most of the MSI GPU had fan issues, couple burned out, but my patience ended with there MSI seahawk cards even if MSI sells you a water cooled product out of the box, the box tells you 3 years warranty , you get NO years warranty. Because msi does not do warranty on watercooled products. I can tell you EKWB that was a partner in this card was not happy and replaced my products because MSI refused to.  They kept hiding behind legal bla bla. half way that year they blocked me for there site, so i could not RMA or ask questions any more, my only option was court cases and i ended up with so many  cases, that i had to refund all the open builds. and close down my pc building company because of all the costs.   And gigabyte does the same they put out quality products and service for a couple of years and then you get a couple of years of no service at all. Seriously Asrock is now considered ok,  i been scared to buy there stuff. just there broken website puts me off them most of the time.
Fuck yeah Jay! I grabbed a B650 for my AMD build, damn thing blew up my RAM sticks the moment I enabled EXPO (no custom tweaking. literally turned the setting on and POP!), had a horrible time with it, more problems than I care to type out trying to get that piece of shit to work. And it still sometimes just can't find the RAM sticks on reboot even though I've tried everything. Next time I open that case, I'm snapping the damn thing over my knee and replacing it alongside whatever else I'm workin on in there. I get it's a knew board but come on guys, you can't release shit that burns out components when you use the features you sold it on. After the amount of money and pain in the ass factor, I don't think I'll ever buy from them again and they deserve getting roasted by reviewers.
I bought one of their gaming laptops, literally cant play whit stable FPS because of tems. I know its not a ASUS specific problem but I expected a bit more.
Great - so which 4090 do I buy then if Asus sucks now?
I thought Asus was a serious company and to build me a new PC , I had planned to buy an Asus B650E E-F motherboard, but after the serious problems that appeared with the Rysen 7800X3Ds, I lost confidence and I finally bought an Asrock B650E Steel legend wifi motherboard with which I am very satisfied
I have a Crosshair VIII Dark Hero, should I be worried about something?  Been running alright it seems.  My m2 drives sometimes don't register....not sure if that's board or M2 faulty tho?
where is this video for Gigabyte ?
The ending really puts things into perspective "but you don't care". They really don't. That's why we're are lucky to have people like you with integrity who put info like this out there.
They'll be fine without you and will probably outlast you despite your attempts to influence - you sound like the bemfoys crying over hogwarts legacy and how J. K. Rowling is bad :')
I was kinda wondering why my Asus computer stopped working after just 2 years. Motherboard got burned or something idk, I'm not a computer expert.
Such a shame how asus went downhill so much
I had a couple ASUS and Asrock motherboard in the past. (2 intel-3 AMD.) I always had issues with the ASUS.. Never had any problem with the Asrock. Personaly i never buy any kind of ASUS product. I hate the whole bullshit overpriced brand since 2014. Always had issues, and cost more then the others. Nothing new. Peoples just started to realize now, because they lost money with the HIGH-END products. But asus always was this shit with the "cheaper" stuff.
Bullshit. Dont bite the hand that feeds you. Asus was here a long time befor you and will be here a long time after you. Some pip squeek Internet channel is going to worry Asus? NOPE!
Ya well… you are fired… oh wait you do d work for me… fuck
FAMOUS BRAND IN ASIA LIKES GIGABYTE,MSI,ASUS,HTC,SAMSUNG,BENQ ETC
I bought an asus motherboard years ago and the wifi and bluetooth on the board just never worked. I had to buy a pcie board to get bluetooth and wifi
Are these problems happening with the ROG STRIX B650E-F boards / BIOS?   This has me worried as I've just dropped on one together with 7800X3D  :(
You made a 20 minute video about a computer company you don’t like…white privilege
A wise old man told me true character comes out when a person has to deal with their mistakes. Judge them off that not how they handle their successes
Oh boy I just bought a Asus power supply
I also hate it when my free stuff breaks
thanks for the msi rtx2060 ventus 6 gb oc graphics card 152.50 bidding
Wtf @asus
Funny enough my dad was ordered to build like 15 or so PC for local company 20 years ago and he ordered asus motherboards but none of them worked and none of them were accepted to be returned. And now, when me and dad started to trust to asus, coz we thought that they changed and their laptops are good, this happened 😂😂😂
why trash them publicly don't you think it will effect you getting new sponsors down the line ?
I use to be a gigabyte fan, get all my stuff from them.  Not to long a go I got some asus stuff and it worked. But now the battery on my aces laptop is dead (3000€+  4 years of use and now the battery is 100% dead)  Armory crate has to be reinstalled whenever you skip some updates. Also most of there software work Great until it just completely stops working.  Safe to say I will not be recommending asus anymore.
Brought a b550 wifi an the antenna things on i/o shield were broken
No more free shit
I've been Asus's customer since it was Asustek - the 2nd class brand leader. I can confirm that they didn't trick customers with these hidden 'over' tunings just recently. They've actually been doing either overvolt or overclock a little bit since the leading brand motherboards were reclining from market and Asustek rose to replace them. Not just mother boards. Asus did overtuning their 3D accelerators and GPUs also.
Sad day indeed. I have been buying Asus products for probably close to 25 years, never had problems, but if they dont mind screwing large content creators what chance do I have? Suppose its time to find another vendor.
Called ASUS support because my RAM speed wasn’t where it was supposed to be even tho all the settings were accurate and I don’t think the tech had ever even seen the inside of a computer before in his life. Put me on hold like 5 times just to come back and be no help. That’s my experience. 😂
This is really sad because I've always been a huge Asus fanboy. And now that I'm a grown adult and can finally afford to put together a "dream build", it's depressing that after all these year, I can't put them into it.
У меня был такой ноутбук Asus часто проблема решил перешел на Acer все норм потом 2019года купил компьютер с сборкой вся MSI просто класс включить и забудь нет проблема уже 4года без жалоб,сейчас у меня msi z490 gaming plus+i9 10850k разгонял 5200ГЦ достаточно но хочу перешел msi z690 torpedo EK X + i9 13900K но деньги нет накоплю((((( У меня видеокарта msi rtx 3090 ventus 3x oc кулер убрал поставил кастома водоблок. Я знаю что MSI хороший качество как Xiaomi))))
Yet everyone is losing their minds over the Asus handheld. Only because it’s internals are slightly better on paper than the steam deck. Yet the hardware is junk and the software is buggy at best. And if anyone thinks Asus is going to address those issues, I have some oceanfront land to sell you in Nebraska.  Asus has always been the bottom of the barrel when it came to hardware. Their stuff is absolute junk.
It is good to have morality upheld in a world of such decline i dont think americans understand just how serious things with china are and war but what happend abt 10yrs ago ?? Azus used to be the rock of stability and testing
it always has been the problem with the tech giants. every time they get support from their buyers and get bigger they start to treat their customer shitty, just like Apple. i thought apple is just the rude one but now i see other like asus had the potential not even mistreat but even screw their customer.
I almost bought the proart mother board, what would you recommend me for a strong gaming/art creation pc?
does dropping a sponsor also impact access to their products before launch ? anyone know?
Screw asus , they dont care about the consumer
Used to be, When I thought of putting an ASUS motherboard into a build, I was grabbing a flagship piece of machinery as if their decades of manufacturing had culminated into their latest product.  But my Flagship PC build, meant to last me some years has sunk, It's like the goddamn titanic. I've got issues that i would presume could only happen in a generic part. Dollar store problems from within the top percentile of price points. And it literally disgusts me how it never used to be like this. There seems to have been a change in workers standards, But its much more likely to be the fault of just cutting costs and corners.
everybody excited about the ROG Ally needs to watch this video.. I don't know how anybody could get excited about something as complicated as a handheld gaming computer when they fumble the thing they're supposed to be "the best" at- motherboards. I'll stick with steamdeck, thanks!
Asus tuf is still good price for gear and in Germany i can return them in stores and get my money back even if asus crys
5:30 "It takes 7 boards from ASUS to get a good one." That hit so hard as that is exactly what happened to me in like 2014. Since then I have only bought one other Mainboard because there was literally nothing else available and it's been giving me grief for years and years at this point. So yeah, quite happy to see them get a bonk on their high heads...
I've had mostly bad experiences with Asus products.  Two monitors I bought from them both ended up crapping out, and my Asus laptop that I bought six years ago still has hard locking issues that I can't resolve.
those 1.5 centers really blow.He started  ideal one  jumped to  idea two , mentoined idea 3, slowly  recoursed to item 5..and  I jsut went CLICK !! whew  Jayz and  asus ..whew
ASUS  I bought one of their damn lapys  back in 2017, WAs told in 2019 that  I should upgrade.who knows how bad they are? THEY are really bad, have found out that  they do not make their components to last, cuz they figure that you WILL UPGRADE every other year!  My  adaptor  was dying out  only 85%  power then 65% power then 45% power???? The plastic  bolts that held  bottom screen together BROKE when the very hard metal  nuckles  did not respond to opening  lappy?  I hd to buy a DELL  lappy..it does work well.I took tha t ASUS and married it to a vertical  bumper resistance  pole. WRAPPED the crud out of it.. and then jsut threw it away. NOBODY can get any infrom my lappy it was gonzo  pieces!
Bought a comp from nzxt with a bunch of asus parts. Oops lol 😊
I miss EVGA    :(
Been watching a few vids here and there from you guys, you taking this stand just made me subscribe 😅 I hate when big corporations take a shit on their consumers. Love the stand. I don't use Asus or msi due to really bad support, but I'm happy we agree on asrock 😁 the little underdog that could!
Been hating asus from 2013 cuz of their weird laptop, and yet they said it's normal.  Feels good to watch this video hahahahah.
Good, good.... thats how it should be...
I had 2 asus motherboards same model, both had the same issue of randomly putting my hdd(every hdd 5, or 6 even os hdd, and external) reader head into park screwing up everything, had to restart every time. I vowed to never buy an asus motherboard ever again.
good to know. was about to buy my gcard
If you couldn't afford the latest and greatest via staying with old hardware winner winner chicken dinner
I was just about to order their asus tuf gpu and mobo...
I agree....there motherboards are sh!t now. Never again will I support asus...NEVER!!
I've hated ASUS since I was doing my first PC build towards the end of high school in like 2004. Absolute assy support. It's funny though because I decided to finally give them another shot last year when I was doing some upgrading and surprise surprise I had some trouble getting the build off the ground where I'd never had such issues with Gigabyte nor MSI. I'm curious to see if they can bounce back in the mid to long term or if they'll flounder for a while and crash. Don't wish ill on them but you reap what you sew.
i got a Asrock B550M Steel Legend and it is solid as rock ;))
Go MSI ... EVGA
i have an Asus B-550 plus, not high end obviously, but in all seriousness should i get something else? im like barely competent at doing major swaps and another motherboard swap fills me with dread. im shocked i got it right the first time without bricking anything.
So what brand should I even use then lol I feel like all of them are a bad choice, I found out last week that my gigabyte board can download malware lol
Basically this dude jumped on a train - lets TARE DOWN asus company.... the worst of all... these "influencers" are influencing each other. Why does anyone trust these people.... they just buy and review tech. No knowledge. I listened to this guy till 10:10 - he said 11 years has a tech channel and still he knows CHIT. hahaha. Doesn't know a thing about computers. Hahaha. Imagine "accepting" Ryzen gear XD dumb. I wouldn't take Ryzen free. If you gave me 1 million ryzen cpus I would destroy them. I wouldn't even gift them away.
I'm gonna buy MSI products in my future builds and also I'm gonna try ASRock products.
I got a monitor from Asus, bought it a few years ago. Just after a week or so, it got a pixel issue, so I sent it back in for repairs. It took them 2 weeks to provide me with a new monitor. When I got home and tried it, it got a green pixel like right through the middle. So I went back to the store the next day and sent it in again. It took them 3 weeks to replace it, but now it has been working since then and it is around 4 years ago. They sell faulty products, replace them by faulty products and the support is horrible, even for one of their most expensive products at the time.  I also have a Notebook from Asus which I also sent in 2 times and it took almost a month to get it back every time. Software and hardware issues all the time. I never bought everything else from Asus since then.
lmao @"brand strength". When appearance is all that matters, all else goes out the window.  Just like my willingness to participate in uncontrolled proliferation of expensive trash products flooding the world markets.
I used to be very into Asus products, but the last 3-4 years I've noticed a decline in quality as well as service.  They are very Anti-Consumer now.
Which brands can we trust? I have heard of a security issue affecting a considerable number of Gigabyte motherboards lately. So, what is left?
I used to look up to ASUS as a manufacturer of quality PC peripherals, Turns out they are just as fucked as the US government via Trump. Glad Im not the only person to Fire ASUS, But they have been fucking us since crosshair 6 at least. ROG need not apply
All of you americans should unite and sue Asus as a whole, regardless of whatever tecnical shenanigans they try to pull off (such as voiding warranty) to avoid any consequences, so they finally realize they are not untouchable nor above the law. The customer always has the final word, not the corporations.
3:54 - Disgusting...   I will never spend another penny on Asus products. Never.
Fired them a long time ago
All i see is a grumpy complaining OLD MAN. that cant figure out things calmly and clearly he has no knowledge of troubleshooting PC
Dell makes the same sht with it's rma. Our company bought optiplex 7000 and precision machines with 12th gen Intel, and all of them became motherboard rma. The "fun" was, that they replaced those mobos with refurbished mobos. And ofc some of them already gone wrong again. I must say, not just Asus gone junk, but others too. But wich product maker should we choose than?
asus wont care cuz they could just scam other channels lmao
Thanks, I'm glad I watched this before buying my new board
Thank you for posting this video, I'm no longer going to buy ASUS products after watching this. I was a almost over a decade ASUS customer!
Actually, I've been having a bit of issue with Asus as well recently.  I purchased a ROG laptop from them.  I kept getting system lockup issues.  Not blue screens, nothing like that, the system would simply freeze up.  After making sure all my drivers were up to date, bios was correct, etc, and it STILL kept freezing up, I sent it to be 'fixed'.  I should have sent it directly back to Amazon and asked for my money back.  Though I said it was locking up, they decided their fix would be 're-install the OS and send it back to me.  Not only that, but their admin account was still in command, but 'disabled', so essentially I had no access to the computer.  I ended up re-installing the OS again myself.  Of course, this didn't fix things, and lockup/freezing issues continued to appear.  So, I sent it back to them AGAIN.  This time, I included a specific list of peripherals and programs I was using and had installed.  They sent it back to me with their repair form saying I had claimed the laptop was slow to boot windows, and that their fix was to...  RE-INSTALL!  Amazing!  It didn't fix a damn thing!  So, once it started freezing again after I got it back, I just said to hell with it and tried trading out some of the 'user serviceable' parts.  SHOCKER, I installed 32gb of corsair ram instead of the garbage they delivered it with, and wow, I haven't had it freeze once since!  I have MANY Asus products from the last decade or so, and have never had issues with them until this year.  And yes, the laptop might just be a fluke.  However, the way their service department treated the issue was not, and that has utterly put me off Asus, at least for the foreseeable future.   Something VERY wrong is going on there.
It sounds like Asus has some shady business with Intel to screw AMD up. It's an assumption but these days this stuff happens Al the time
Has there been anything with their laptops though? Just double checking before I buy one because it seems mostly like a PC builders problem
It's quite a sad situation tbh. I run an ASUS Zenith on my main rig and it's been solid for years now. Long dreamed of upgrading it to a SAGE but with AMD taking the piss on Threadripper following Intel's demise on the HEDT space, guess I'm going to be on Zen1 forever.  Conversely, my living room gaming rig is built on top of a Gigabyte mobo that simply fails to post like 30-50% of the time so... that's a brand that I don't think I'm buying again. Which really thins out the options.  Also kinda surprised at the backhanded AMD slander as I've been with them for years and it's been just solid. I'd be more suspicious of Windows rather than hardware for those issues, my life's been way way better since I just stopped installing it. DID have an issue last time I used it, tho, where plugging in a USB3 device would immediately crash the OS, good times.   Finally: With the RAM stability issues, what happened to running memtest86 for that? They even have the UEFI binary version. Never seen something manage to crash unstable memory setting more reliably than it.
Thats it. I'm going back to SOYO...| wait...theyre gone.
At the IT repair business I’m working at we were trying to fix someone’s Asus gaming PC that had this exact issue and it even killed the 1200 watt power supply that was in it! Pretty much while we were troubleshooting the PC the power supply suddenly failed and tripped the circuit breaker to the building!
I have problems too, with my Asus B550 and 5900x... Often Bluescreens! Never buying asus again!
I bought an headset from them which didn't last a year, then i gave a try on a mobo and the Qlatch was missing..... No rma from them just "return to merchant" answer....  I fired them 2 years ago....
EDIT: It's funny that you mention you put a MSI board in to replace an Asus one. Because I know MSI has been on the shitlist (at least with Steve 100%) for years now. Even I tend to try to avoid them, but it's well known too that 'some' of their products are actually quite stellar and come highly recommended. Motherboards, it seems, top the list.  I'm very sad to see this. Asus has for many years been considered a trusted brand among us builders, "you can't go wrong." But you know, the signs were there back in, BIG "I think" 2017, when they were having issues with an security weakness. And so hearing things have only gotten worse, disappoints me. But it's also exemplary of why I will tell you, DO NOT FANBOY. Ever. It helps no one to just blindly "love" a product or company or hell, even political party. Do your homework and make educated decisions. EVGA was once cream of the crop too. NZXT. Razer. They're not heroes. They don't exist, so don't put material "things" or the people that make them on pedestals. Ever.
Don't build a lot of PCs anymore but I've used two or three dozen ASRock motherboards since the early 2000s without ever getting a bad one.  My Asustek ratio is roughly two bad of three or four, and while back then Asus had good support whereas ASRock had no support, Asus was also quite often twice the cost.  ASRock was cheap & fast, with the features that I wanted and none of the fluff I didn't.  Asus had prettier BIOS, but literally who cares?  As long as I can figure it out, I don't care about the prettiness of BIOS.  Seems to me that if Asus doesn't have great support, they've got nothing marketable.  Kudos though for turning down their money, integrity is everything.
Damn...
I am done with Asus altogether , last system was a Asus 1080ti and an Asus mobo, 1080ti died last year and mobo 2nd one mind you of the same model is on its last legs.
I have an ASUS ROG CROSSHAIR VIII DARK HERO ATX AM4 motherboard…should I be worried?
The cheap Asrock board I got had been way more stable than my $500 ASUS board.  Based on this video, my next board is definitely not going to be another ASUS.
It's ASUS -- my ASROCK X670e system has been absolutely rock-solid, with EXPO enabled.
Love Asus laptops, so sad to hear this
I haven’t liked asus in a long time. I had a issue with a power brick for a 300$ monitor and they told me I had to buy a new cord myself for 100$ and it wasn’t under warranty even tho it was only 6 months old. I returned it and got a 150$ ACER 1440p 165hz  monitor and it hasn’t let me down
ASUS one of the most big disapointed for me. I go for DELL, never buy any product from ASUS!
I had ASUS mobo, ASUS chassi ASUS watercooler, basically i had ASUS everything.. I returned EVERY single product except the Graphic card because i couldnt, and i bought MSI... Because ASUS was REALLY CRAP and their customer support was even WORSE, and I said this 1 1/2 YEARS AGO so this video makes me really happy. SO everyone its time to stand up against this kinda Fu**kery and return everything you have AND NEVER BUY ASUS AGAIN.
Sad to hear. I've been using ASUS boards for more than a decade now. first a TUF in 775 era, and currently still an ROG Maximus Code on 1151. Both are great, butt for the next build I'm not that sure anymore, also the prices are nuts
I've found that years ago.
Bruh what are you talking about?
I have an Asus VivoBook Gaming Notebook, which randomly resets for no apparent reason and I lose all my current work,  It has an AMD Ryzen 7 processor,
So if not Asus, what brand should I be considering for my new build's motherboard?
Expensive but shit ASUS, wtf Republic of Gaywoek shit?
Asus is garbage, even the rog and there ailen ware stuff they made also was garbage.  ill be sticking to my gut with this one here.. TEAM MSI
this is absolutely terrible... I built my computer about 2 and a half years ago... absolutely loved ASUS, but seeing this actually kind of makes me regret building a full ASUS build. everything on it has been pretty solid, motherboard, power supply, graphics card, cpu cooler, all of it was ASUS.... guess its time to try the MSI build I have always wanted to do for my next upgrade.
Yeah, and I found out just recently what low quality recycled PBC are, the board I got for my 9gen processor was so freaken weak the tower cooler could warp it.  I can look at the board and it will warp so I started the boycott after them sending me continous crapy boards and moved on to Gigabyte.  So go right ahead get on the recycle wagon and produce crappy shit, nope I just won't buy it.  Edit: It should have took me a year max to build my 9 gen computer its taken me 3 years thanks to having to throw out one because it wouldn't fit in the case because the cooling tower warped it so the plugs wouldn't even align with the backplates.  I sent one in to get the socket spring in the hing fixed but they didn't even bother because my RNA wasn't clear on the fact it was a loose socket hing and they looked at the pins and sent it back saying nothing wrong.
I just had a shitty experience with an Asus pre-build PC that I swapped. First time ever I was getting my hands dirty in a PC case.  The swap was successful except for some shenanigans I had to do with the rad. But the back vent didn't turn on... Thought it was a setting problem and an experienced friend of mine told me: "It's ok, just go in the bios and set it like you want It's an Asus motherboard, you should be able to do that" And drum roll.... No way to set the fans or even to set the Ram frequency for my new ones... Apparently they put a laptop motherboard and bios in a gaming desktop... Had to download fancontrol (thanks for that by the way 😊) and a separate power display is coming for my fans... G10CE, wouldn't recommend it, way too hot (94°C with approximately every game), no real way to upgrade without a swap and if you do so you are blocked by the motherboard's settings...
This crap has been going on since 2000's people just ignore it.  It's good to see the enfluencers ending contracts with with Asus. Asus doesn't care once they have your money.  I personally refused to use any Asus products starting back in 2003 when my first Asus board caught fire on startup, tech support wanted me to pay to send it in just for them to tell me it's outside enfluince we can send you a refurbished board for $200 which was$50 more than what I paid thankfully the electronics store I bought it from happily let me exchange it for a MSI board and no problems.
Bummer, Asus has been my go-to for quality and fast products for at least 15 years. Wanted to make a mini Linux build, but at this point I might as well just buy a Mac.
Idk who you are. I have an ASUS ROG G15. Why am I here?
Thanks for the insightful information.
hello, IE user! Asus is for YEARS the biggest ars**ole.  only nice painting outside (aesthetics). horrific tech quality (soft, hard, utilities).
you have bought Asus : which brand do you recommand now ?
I dont think Asus care what ever you do. Just my 10 cents.
Always loved asus displays and i have some of their older boards by a few years. Sad to see this going down.
have you tried resetting your pc ?
Dude the prebuilt I bought from ASUS ROG a G10CE and it POPped in two weeks. Good build but damned poor hardware.
i got gaming pro 570 with ryzen 3800 and its so hot, sometimes didnt start at all. Asus never again
ASRock was spun off Asus in the early 2000s as a budget brand. If the budget brand now makes higher quality products then clearly something is wrong.
How do we feel about MSI these days?
Msi dragon or go home!
Was it made in China? Asus was good when it was made in Taiwan.
Please help a boomer noob! I have been running Asus ROG's for my two last gaming laptops, mind you I don't upgrade often as the last one was seven years when it died on me last week. But as I have had a solid run with both of my computers I was looking into buying a new asus laptop. After noticing there was a buzz about asus and then seeing this video I don't really feel the same confidence about the company as I did. Well, I still need a new laptop, but as I have been completely off the news bulletines the last five or six years, I kinda need a headsup on what brands to look into and what brands, except asus to avoid. I would sincerely appreciate any thoughts into the question what brands to buy?
Finally the big "influencers" are realizing something that i knew 20 years ago..  Asus is trash.  The ONLY bad boards i have ever had were ALL Asus.   At one point i had a stack of 3 out of 5, that i had at the time, that were bad.  Had an HP modified version in a Pavilion fail in less than a year after buying the computer new.  And this board wasn't just a direct replacement board because of the orientation of the RAM in relation to the "Piglet" chassis we had.  It's only been in the last few years that I found a board that would work in that chassis.  Their monitors and laptops have always been overpriced hot garbage.  Like Alienware (especially after the Dell buyout). But yeah, I prefer Biostar, Gigabyte, and especially MSI.  My last 2 Ryzen builds, a couple years old on the newer one, are an MSI A320M and X470 GAMING.  So not sorry to see these big performers dumping Asus.  Overpriced and under delivering from the beginning.
I was about to build new rig this summer, I excluded every Asus parts on it after this video.
I build for others, Asus is off the list, i had issues too with high end mbs.
the new board should be fine
very good jay very good
what do you mean squimish
lol
your alll good jay i was just bitchin
i need wifi security cameras parking and rest area for australia post baxter victoria
I had two ASUS boards go out on me, so I switched to MSI, sound so far.
CEO of asus : "just go pay ant fix jayz2ct, pay him enough" :) lol that is what is happening on other channels, asus reps coming exlaining, and they all get hired again lol
I only build systems for myself and my family, so it doesn't happen that often. It's going to be very easy for me to file ASUS away into the bin of no-name knockoffs and just never consider them again.
OK NOOB give me all those motherboards!
Is Linus still going to be able to get the Ol reach around from them every other video? I sure hope so , that tool bag needs all the greed $ he can get.
i have had many manufacturers over the years gigabyte and msi and many more! but never ASUS! Now I've built a new system! the first time with asus products! Z690 Formula and asus tuf 4090! the z690 formula was in the RMA 3 times! until I finally got one that worked! the 4090 has coil whine of horror! I always thought Asus was quality! But I was taught a lesson! That was the first time Asus for me and also the last time! Never again ASUS!!!!!
It appears to be a big problem with several companies and the way they handle RMA's. Most recently I returned a power supply to Thermaltake only to receive what appeared to be someone else's return. Speaking to Thermaltake they apologized and took back the PSU and promised a retail packaged brand new PSU to replace the one they sent.  Long story short Thermaltake called me 7 days prior to the new retail packaged PSU was to arrive to inform me I would not receive a new PSU....and they closed the case! The PSU was purchased from Newegg and they stated they might be able to help but only if I could send back the original serial number PSU that was sent into Thermaltake per authorized RMA. So Jay I feel you when you are mentioning ASUS, I have been down that road to and yes I am beginning to see a lot of very shady practices by these PC suppliers and it sucks when they scam people out of their hard earned money by refusing to properly do the right thing!
ASUS is the worst. I have had many issues in the past with their customer support and basically every time you have a problem that is related to their hardware, they just tried to blame me, even though I have a premium customer support warranty. This is especially sad, because they are releasing now the ROG Ally, which seems to be a really nice device...  ASUS never again :/
I'm having a lot of the issues that he had on stream, audio crackles, random black screens, etc.  but I'm running intel/nvidia hardware with a gigabyte motherboard. Could it be a BIOS issue?  - I know asking vague computer problems and expecting very simple "oh, yes it's this that's causing the issue" answers is asinine
Guess I'll be going to Razer when I upgrade from my G14.
how is this even possible. don`t you have national regulations for consumer protection stateside
I have a Asus ROG Swift PG279Q 27" Gaming Monitor, 1440P WQHD (2560 x 1440), IPS, 165Hz, after a year I lost about 7 pixels. Asus was awesome in the return, repair and shipping back process. It is 2 years later and the monitor is stilling going strong with no dead pixels. I always go with gigabyte for mb's.
So happy I got a gigabyte motherboard for my first build, she's been going strong for 2 years now. Now I know to get another gigabyte motherboard for when I start my next build in the future, especially since I plan on attempting a hardline watercooled build and the last thing id want is to do everything correctly and then still have a broken pc
Im building first conputer for my kids. I wont be using their parts now. Thank you
Jay, I'm a fan of yours but I disagree no matter your disappointment. Asus makes good products. I got the ProArt Z790 Creator Wifi and it's the Best for Filmmakers and Musicians like me. It has everything from 4x NVMe to DDR5 to Thunderbolt 3/4 to 10G Ethernet.  All the power needed to edit 8K or Compose Film Scores with Huge Orchestral Midi Templates and Many Virtual Instruments with 128GB Ram.
Our company has moved away from Asus a year ago because their notebooks had so many RMAs, it killing our regular business operation. So, really appreciate your straight forwardness and looking after us - the users.
X570 plus wifi is the worst motherboard I’ve ever had. Never buying ASUS again.
I purchased the extremely expensive PG35VQ (35" HDR1000 monitor) at around 3k. Even so, it was one of the best purchases ever; the brilliant but nevertheless true (not wide-gamut) colors at HDR are awesome. BUT: I had a problem with the fan acting up and with such an exquisite hardware, I wanted an exchange. Granted, I got that. But the first was defective (the glass screen was broken in one corner) and the second time the fan was even noisier. So, as each of those "exchanges" took a considerable amount of time, I just let it slide and lived with it. Now, 2 months after the warranty of 3 years is void, the monitor no longer "starts". It keeps off, even though it has power and all.  So, their products are really great, but good luck if you actually need your hardware replaced....
Hell yeah well done man. Been a huge fan of ASUS until a recent built where I went through 3 boards before getting a working one.
i STOPPED using Asuc in 2018 because of such bad customer service & poor QA from ASUC     and have recommended to my customers any other company
I bought an ASUS monitor along with an ASUS GTX 970 about 6 years ago and it has been a nightmare. I am loathe to ever turn the computer off because the monitor will straight up not pick up a signal from the card. Whenever this happens, I am forced to restart the computer, and if that doesn't work; I will have to turn off the computer and monitor, unplug the monitor from the GPU, turn on the computer, then plug it back into the GPU and turn the monitor on (IN THAT ORDER!!). Somtimes I have to do this half a dozen times before the monitor gets a signal. ASUS is ASS
i had   Asus B550 F gaming with R9 5900X Asus I7 1165g7 zenbook  1x Asus P9D-MV 3x Asus p10s-e/4l (1 of the motherboards have 1 defective Ram Slot, buyed it used with the Error) 2x asus p10s-m 1x Asus p11c-m/4l 1x Asus p11c-i 3x Asus p11c-e/4l  All motherboards are working fine and have no problems with it.

Sorry bro, but this smells like someone hurt your entitlement for getting flawless free stuff...listen to yourself from 6:30 onward...man they gift you that stuff and you b*tch about it as if you paid with your moms kidney...Dont get me wrong, I normally like your channel and content - but this part was really phrased badly. You sound like the villain princess in a Disney movie who has to undergo some character development to reconnect to normal people.
Time to buy an HP Spectre
I had a PC from them a good 10 years ago or so.  Good machine, but with caveat. After 3 months, the graphics card went don. It burned. Which was absolutely weird. It never overheated or anything. Just one day, it just... went boom. The thing was still on guarantee, so no problem. They kept the thing for 2 damn weeks in service, exchanged the graphics card and voila.  2 months later - same story.  I've been sending the thing to service every 2-3 months 4 times in total. My guess is, this must have been a motherboard fault.  They eventually exchanged it for a SLIGHTLY WORSE model, because they no longer produced this particular one.  Fortunately this one works well to this day - and with some graphics card upgrade and exchanged drive, it now serves my parents well. But honestly, that original experience I had was kind of harrowing.
I have a Ryzen 9 5900X on a B550F  motherboard, am I screwed?
I've had weird stability issues with my Asus tuf x570 mb and R7 5800x for a long time. My PC will randomly be fine, but then boom. Similar issues to what you were having with your system. I'm not even doing anything crazy. I have 4x3600Mhz Corsair ram set to DOCP and using PBO. No special settings or power profiles. I even went in and manually set everything to 100% and level 1 in the bios on any performance enhancements.
Omg thank you for making this video. I sent my RTX 3060 to the ASUS warranty and they made me buy a $48 FedEx Shipping label. I made sure I cushioned my graphics card with so many of long sleeve shirts and cardboard and they claim they only received a “Fan” when I know 100% I put the entire Graphics Card in the box. I called them 4 times to change and update my address to my new one and six months later after so many RMA escalations they ship my Graphics Card to my OLD address. This was 3 months ago and I’m still yet to see my Graphics Card because they say that they can’t find it. Worse part is having to endure the gameplay of a GTX 1650 when I have everything thing else overkill for that Graphics Card like:  ASUS ROG Maximus 13 Hero i9 11900K  32G 3600 MHz  CL14 Ram EK 360MM AIO 1000W Corsair PSU  1T Samsung 980 Pro SSD  And still experiencing lag due to the Graphics Card even on low Settings. I don’t think they will ever give me back my Graphics Card and it’s sad considering I was a streamer and see my future goals go down the drain is truly heartbreaking.
I find this so frustrating because I waited for 5 years to upgrade,  building my kids systems and replacing them twice and my wife's system one during that period.  I was just wanting to make sure everyone else had a decent machine.  I was finally ready to buy in and then we had the shortages and AM5 was looming so I waited, and waited.  The AM5 hit, the boards hit and I finally pulled the trigger,  a several thousand dollar trigger between all the parts. I picked a very high end X670E Asus board as a centerpiece for that system.  Kind of a bit excessive but the hope being that it would last me a long time because my previous experience with Asus over decades has been fairly good.  It's an expensive pile of crap, stability issues, Aura Sync failures and I don't want to touch the Bios because who trusts them anymore.  It's just such a feelsbadman :(
I wonder how Corsair will respond to Asus being boycotted because they integrated Asus deep inside their iCue software
This literally sh*t especially for us editors 😏😭
Only stunted minds play video games.
My ASUS TUF board just went out. It just randomly no longer boots Windows. It reads all my SSD drives but says "No bootable device found." I tried to reinstall Windows via USB and CD drive. The motherboard reads both the USB drive and the CD drive but still says "No bootable device found." Instead of wasting my hours, possibly days trying to fix the issue, I just bought a brand new MSI motherboard. This is my THIRD ASUS motherboard to fail in the past 10 years. Never buying ASUS again.
Asus got me over a decade ago with the ASUS P6T. Board had bad memory slot issues so they released the v2 variant and all of us with the messed up board were left with no help. No RMA. No warranty being honored. Asus has been a garbage company for a lot longer than as of recent. I will never use any of their products ever in the future, especially after this video.
ASRock needs to immediately change their slogan to solid as an ASRock.
Fuck I was just about to get an upgrade. Might have to go for MSI.
I learned years ago that ASUS doesnt stand by their products so this is nothing new to me.
Brother, just send me one of those Asus laptops rog strix . I am okay with your decision
thank you
I bought my pc new from komplett. Ever since I received it I kept getting freezes constantly. I sent it back, they said they found nothing wrong with it and replaced the parts anyway and did re-install. I got it back and it kept freezing again. Was thinking is it something on my end? Is it my power supply or something. Nope it was asus armory crate for my asus rog strix motherboard that kept freezing and crashing my pc. I tried everything under the sun to stop it from freezing, saw on reddit that armory crate was cancer so gave it a try.  As soon as I uninstalled armoury crate my computer has worked perfectly. Not had one freeze in 6 months thankfully but man fuck Armory Crate and Asus
ASUS sucks  -sun tzu
ASUS lack of quality is nothing new. I haven't bought ASUS since the time I got a DOA motherboard, had it RMA's 3 times by ASUS and the 3rd replacement not only wouldn't boot but damaged a brand new processor. ASUS then said it was "obviously my fault". That is when I switched to gigabyte.  I tried to look up when that was on Newegg, and my order history doesn't go back that far so it was some time prior to 2013. ASUS has been a failure for a long long time.
1:14 nice censoring
I’ve had some weird problems with my pc, like the devices disconnecting and reconnecting mid-stream, and certain audio/visual input mishaps like stuttering/cutting out, but I’m using a Prime X-570p. I’m not sure if those motherboards have been linked to anything bad, because it was seen as one of the “better” boards to go with when AMD launched the 3000-series, but I just thought it was weird that you had similar problems, especially while streaming.
i have the tuf gaming z790 plus d4 and my cpu voltage was always at 1.4v and i thought it was normal until now lol
Some manufacturers don't understand how dangerous it is to F around.. after watching a few of these types of videos talking about asus im no longer inclined to buy something from asus if i can get it from someone else just the same.. very dumb behaviour.

what a dumbass move.
I just came across this looking for something else. I may me able to help you with some of your issues of sound, mic dropping out, RAM issues etc. It seems that the ASUS Z590/Z690/Z790 boards all have similar issues which comes down to USB ports failing, resetting, only working if you unplug the device and re-plug it back in which is absolutely useless when it comes to using a powered external USB drive for backups if you have to keep leaving the drive unplugged until you get into Windows 10/11.  For the most part, the main issues with the USB ports are the PD firmware, voltage set manually and the ASUS Armoury Crate (AAC). With AAC installed it seems to do weird things to the USB ports and when you have certain devices plugged in, they either stutter, fail or stop working after a reboot and the current fix is to unplug the device un re-plug it back in. Some devices still fail after a reboot and freeze the system up until unplugged and then plugged in again. In my case it was an external powered USB drive for backups doing this which would even let you reboot the computer until you unplugged the drive.   Try this one thing to start with; use the uninstall tool for AAC and reboot you computer. Most of your issues with disappear in that one item being removed. Make sure you have the latest BIOS, PD Firmware and ME installed. My motherboard PCH voltage starts at 1.8v and goes to 2.1v so to give the USB a little more power. I just set it to 1.9v as the intervals are 0.1v. Also changing the fast boot to disabled is recommended to help recognise every device each boot which in reality adds 1-2 seconds tops. With the build I'm fixing at the moment it has over 6000Mb/s transfer with the new m.2 drives anyway so I'm still in windows within 10 seconds so it's no big deal.  People have said in other boards there default setting for PCH is 1.82v and max is 1.9v so they have set it to 1.87v but have found the PCH section on the board gets too hot. So for them it was stability with the USB ports and too much heat which caused a problem eventually or instability and heat within tolerance. Some people found moving certain devices to certain ports fixed the issues as the power delivery was evened out more. A good utility to use is USBDeview which tells you how much power usage is being used and also which ports and controller are being used and what devices were even previously used to help with moving devices. You will also need to use device manage with device by connection view so you can also see what controller has what device plugged in which will help with splitting the loads. This can also help with plugging in USB port multipliers and it is recommended getting powered ones to help reduced the power draw on the original port as power is a big issue and causes port resets etc which then drops off things like cameras, microphones, keyboards etc.  Then we hit the RAM issue. 2 sticks plugged in seem to work fine with or without XMP enabled. plugging in 4 sticks seems to create the initial issue for some reason. Again, make sure the firmware on all RAM sticks are the same as that will cause issues and BSOD. Then you can set XMP on but sometimes with heavy loads or large file copies, you will get the BSOD. It looks like when setting the XMP profile to on, it changes the settings and voltages but the voltage doesn't always go from the default of 1.2v to 1.35v for example even though it says it does. Monitoring software in windows will show it is 1.2v still for some reason so after you have set XMP on, also hard set the DRAM Voltage to whatever it is meant to be manually. In my case it is 1.35v but if you see in the monitoring software that the volts are say 1.34v, just up the voltage in the bios to 1.36v for example and make sure that the voltage is actually 1.35v or whatever your RAM is meant to be.   I then also tried installing USB PCI-E controller cards but they would be seen in the BIOS but not in Windows 10/11. Both controllers were ASMedia chipsets and they needed firmware updates to be seen properly in the newer z690 and z790 motherboards and then presented as hardware in Windows 10/11. You need to plug the card into older machines and use the ASMedia Firmware update tool for the chipset on the cards. I had 2 cards and one had an 1142 chip and the other had a 3142 chip. Finding the ASMedia firmware update tool was easy enough but finding the latest firmware for each card was not so easy. I did find both in the end and updated the firmware and then both cards are now also visible in Windows 10/11 to also help spread the load of USB peripheral's. If you need help with these tools and firmware files, send  me a message.  It's still very early days but I believe the USB issues are now sorted but I am still testing the RAM settings and things like loading the PC up and massive file transfer's before I am satisfied that the issues are now resolved. I hope this helps with your issues and resolves them too. So far, So good but I have lots of tests to run but confident I have sorted out most things now and hopefully everything once I have completed all my testing.
My ROG laptop died 3 times since I got it for Christmas. I will never buy  anything from ASUS again.
What do we do after our X670E's cook our AMD CPUs?
I recently said goodbye to Asus. 2-3 years in of owning my Crosshair VI, I started having issues with POST that got worse as time went on. As long as Windows booted, everything was fine which is why I dealt with it for so long. I recently upgraded to an MSI X570 board and it is like a new computer.
Remember all the BAD VRM's on all MSI AMD boards leading to the RETURN TO HONOR CAMPAIGN? I do... Again with the AMD bashing... I knew the Video would get around to pounding on AMD at some point. That Intel Money is too juicy and good.
Asus in their haste to release the bio uodate didn't modify the disclaimer. Not defending them. But..it's too bad, I have a full strix setup last few rebuilds and their great systems.
Just picked up 670e same white board… will be bringing it back because I know my other board ROG 6something for my amd7800ryzen and can’t use the overclocked Ram. Going MSI
Did y’all finally take the red pill? Asus has been doing this garbage for years. I’ve had blatantly broken crosshair boards (one that was setting default v core to 1.8v on a 3900x along with all other voltages crazy) I ended up having to dos flash the bios because asus wouldn’t replace it. Still had issues. I had a $150 water cooler that was literally never successfully installed because the temps were ridiculous. They asked me if I I was using it on intel or amd. Then when I said it could not even cool an i5 at stock speed the rep told me it’s really designed for amd cpus. Even tho it shipped with the intel bracket pre installed. They wanted me to pay $40 to rma it wouldn’t guarantee a replacement. I just put it in the garbage. The first high end WiFi card I bought was asus. Windows 8 came out and there just weren’t compatible drivers wasn’t able to use it. Have had defective hardware including gpus, motherboards, etc. I just had to return to the store because the store didn’t have another one in stock and asus would not rma. The stuff has always been b grade in the quality department and their support has always been d grade at best. People are just finally waking up.
ive been building and repairing pc's for 20+ years now and ill be honest and say when "gaming systems" became a thing then asrock became my goto boards, with a very good balance between price and features. Ive built entire suites of systems with Asrock and not had issues for years on those systems. On the other hand , Asus were throwing out crap from start to finish with their boards. In fact years ago i wouldnt touch gigabyte and asus at all! wouldnt recommend them and certainly wouldn't build with them. Asus were the higher end of the budget laptop scene with Acer being the lower end. And even that has now switched round! With Acer producing some superb budget laptops and high end stuff and Asus producing plastic crap that breaks in seconds! I learnt long ago not to trust Asus boards and tbh even GPU's and i never have. Asrock have never once stumbled on my own systems or any other client build system i have used them on; even in the days they were seen as the outlier of boards to use. But then i guess im old school from the generations where we still had Cyrix cpus and if you wanted Office suite to run and play nice you had to use Intel!
I remember when I built my first PC back in 2016 I had a Corsair PSU. It died with a very loud bang and smoke coming out the case. Corsair’s support was terrible and it took 2.5 months to RMA the product. I eventually got a replacement and less than a week or so later that one went bang too. Corsair then took a further 3 months to fix that issue and I ended up just getting a refund to buy an EVGA psu. RMA process is so important for me now so I’ll be steering clear of ASUS for my next build
I lost faith in ASUS back in December of last year. Reasons were because my friend told me that they had a ROG motherboard that bent the CPU pins. They even burnt their PC parts because of these simple issues that are easily fixable.  Good thing this video helped give out more awareness on this issue.
I have a ASUS GPU before but it died suddenly without any issues. I did not OC'ed it nor tweak anything.
TLDR = Long time OC-er, use to be greatest Asus Fanboy. I've quit Asus long ago when they started making 4 phase double components VRM's and calling them 8 Phase and calling them great while they were not. Especially charging a Premium price for those designs while other companies have offered true 12 phase designs for same money.      Bit about me. Skip to next part for my Asus history. Well I am 52 yeas old with decades in the PC hardware. My background was electronics and when first Spectrum and Commodore computers came out I was hooked as the user. My HiFi and electronics knowledge helped me with the Commodore head adjustment and many other things :)  Early 90's I have started to work for IBM Germany and soon I was putting PC's together for the people in the office to buy them from the company. Like when there were non used hardware it was possible to sell it for a nice price to a people from the department. That was a time where people have had 286 machines and latter on 386 and 486. When Pentium came out I have moved to the Amsterdam Netherlands and I have left the IBM. By that time I was building and fixing PC's, making networks for small companies and fixed any issues people have had from printing to ergonomics at their working stations. I was building custom servers and working stations for design studio and video production. That was a time of Pentium Pro mind you. First Fast DV video editing card in Europe was ordered by me and that Company have had first editing solution for DV in Europe. Sony DV cameras have reached broadcast quality and were so portable compering to Pro Beta's.  So yeah when Asus came out I remember being it cheap option and just an average far east supplier with a big appetite. Back then in local shops choices were not that great. It was more what is in with the chipset and socket you want/need than what brand you choose. You would take what there is, build a system and then spend a day testing it before you give it to the clients. Torture testing everything you could. For me Asus became reliable solution even when their boards were not as advanced as some other once. They would just work. Asus availability became very good and their offerings started to go towards high end still keeping low cost and middle cost solutions. They were offering a lot of products and they were reliable and available. At one moment I was building all machines exclusively with Asus mainboards.  I was always running two rigs with newest and best there is. One Intel and one AMD rig. As soo nas something new would be out I was selling my things and building new. I was into OC-ing and extreme cooling. My first water-cooling setups were with Danger  Den water blocks and heater cores and Enheim aquarium pumps. I still have Asatek Vapochill case with a fridge at home. I use to get pure copper and make my own cooler prototypes. One hybrid CPU cooler that was half TEC half Air Cooled was featured as news on HardOCP web page. That was before anyone else thought about it. Half year after it Coolermaster  made their version. When Asus came with graphic cards I was on the board and having good experience. When they came out with Laptops I got some inside news and soon I have started getting them for my clients. They were great to. So yeah I was Asus fan number 1.  Even when they started charging arm and the leg for their mainboards I was in. Twice more expensive then Some other top brands = who cares give me Asus. Before it got popular to count phases of the VRM I was deciding what board to get by VRM design and cooling. That is due to my electronics background. OC-ing back then was requiring nice amount of clean power to CPU. When Cases where all beige color and no windows and just one single 80mm exhaust or intake fan spot and PCU was 200 Watt I was running 450 Watt Enermax PSU with two fans. I Was cutting out windows in the side of the case and using 12V car inspection neon lights and was cutting holes with a jigsaw and installing 12cm fans in those cases. Window and light was not for looks but to see is everything was still at it's place once you bring your PC to a LAN Party. I was painting my cases and making ducts before there was anything you could buy with a window and in any color.  Anyhow with i9 9900K I have discarded Gigabyte as well. Their default core voltage on stock settings was melting CPU even on huge water cooling setup. Went with MSI and getting MSI mainboards nowadays. I see trend for all brands to give to high default core voltage to make sure that top CPU models run stable. This is resulting in the wasteful heat production and no performance gain. Sure it is not as bad as few first BIOS generation of the Gigabyte mainboards for i9 9900K but it is often even 0,2 V higher than necessary when you have good cooling system.  Nowadays I think all mainboards are way overpriced and they lack even basic features and still demand ridiculous prices. Like till you get LED code indicators and hardware switches on the board you need to pay 500 bucks for the mainboard?? That was on every 200 bucks mainboard just few years ago. We live in the times when Companies can do what ever they want, charge what ever they want and people just accept it. Like current energy prices and prices in general. Here in the Europe it became ridiculous and still people take it. Food is twice more expensive, my energy bill went from 130 to 370 bucks per month. I thought there would be an revolution and heads would roll for that and nothing really happens. Even those companies started reverting the energy prices before people rebelled.  Asus needs to reinvent them self. They did it once when they were starting their saga. Can they do it now?
I had an ROG Strix Helios Evangelion PC Case pre ordered for MONTHS from Scan computers- these guys were great and kept passing on the dates that Asus had sent them etc etc. Out of nowhere the product gets changed to the standard black case, but the price hadnt dropped (about £100 diff)   One phone call later and apparently Asus just decided to do the same thing to Scan. Sent them a load of standard Strix cases at the Evangelion price.. (this all happened like, February)
Yeah I've had a few bad experiences with Asus I don't wanna buy anything from them again absolutely useless support.
Kudos JAY!
I own Asus hardware (ROG specifically), and I have to agree their software is a headache. I haven't got problems as big as those, but it is still annoying.
I'm still rocking my gt62vr MSI ALLL THE WAY
Massive respect!!
I was very excited to get the Asus Rog Ally but seeing this video has made me see Asus in a different light. I don’t want to support the company if they are treating the customers like this.
In ur opinion would u reather pick asrock or Msi for motherboard ? Not going on the looks , just going by how they operate and run witch would you have , just seen a new asrock mobo and it looks pretty nice , it’s in the light line up
3.9 miliona martwych subow chlopie masz
chłop sie zesrał, ze asus mu mało pudeł przysłał. Beka
I want to ask you what Motherboard would you recommend that I use that would be as good if not better than the ASUS X570 Dark Hero, if these boards are going to cause my problems I rather not use them, I rather replace my Dark Hero with something that would be a lot better for me to use.
well dang it... i have only ever used ASUS mobo and never had a problem but i only rebuild every 6 years or so.. was thinking about a new sim racing build.  what mobo do i go with now
I gave up on Asus years ago after so many failures. I've had amazing luck with Msi.
I wish I would have saw this before buying my motherboard 🤦
Asus support is no different than any other large company. Not to mention that your particular case should be handled by the local retailer, because it is not a manufacturing fault but a storage and handling issue. Most likely, your socket has been damaged by the previous influencer. Next time buy your board as a regular customer, from a reputable retailer, and you will receive both a brand new item and a decent support.
Asus sucks and their customer service is garbage. I had their portable screen and it broke on its own FOUR months in. When I contacted them, they stated "This type of damage is not covered under warranty" which is insane because they couldn't explain why as it literally suddenly stopped working
drama queen
Wayyyy back Asus released a flash your BIOS from Windows tool (XP days) it bricked my Asus mobo, I couldn't figure out anything so I emailed Asus support several times, no answer. Tried calling them got nowhere. I day or two later they pulled the tool from their page. I didn't use Asus again until years later like a i7 build it was solid. Tried them again with an AMD build bricked from Amazon... So yeah they have gone down hill bad.  Amazingly I am running an ASRock build now with a 5700X and I love it, rock solid!!! Planning on going with a Taichi for my 7900X build soon.
why buy Asus when you can buy MSI?
i am so glad i watched this video
I compliment you on your decision, i had my share of asus dealings at the end of 2022, resulting in a solemn swear never to buy anything of this borderline criminal corp
not getting aSUS products until Jay gives the green light once again.
ASUS are done
Damn this is hard to hear but I value it, Jay. I've defaulted to Asus stuff for decades, and honestly I've never had the need to deal with their customer service for anything. But hearing this report and learning about the issues, I'm going to at the very least think twice, if not use this as an excuse to move on for good.  What are brands that are known for being great for customer service, build quality, RMAs, etc? EVGA, from what I hear, is excellent (RIP EVGA nVidia cards), and personally I've found Corsair support to be responsive and generous, very helpful--would love to hear your thoughts on that.
They became APPLE
They gave me a bad GPU and I still don't know what to do. They keep replacing it with another faulty 3090. I can't even play anymore.
always thought ASUS was the best, but it seems they cashed in on their credibility by selling bad hardware.
Asus was always o repriced and shit, never had asus never gonna get imma stick to my nice gigabyte stuff
while that is bad isnt EVERY company in exsitancxe like this now? so y bother relying on any company for sponsors?
Keep an eye out for other companies to do this because no one is buying anything and they can't survive without revenue. So is it Asus or the chip manufacturers making Asus do this? Well graphics cards be next?
I'm surprised it took so long for people to take Asus of their high horse. Their off shoot Asrock has been pumping out garbage for years. Their network brand Asustor is selling NAS'es with the shoddiest, unsafest and least advanced software I have ever seen, belonging more into the 90s with the many oversights it has. So I'm not surprised about their BIOS screw ups, because their quality control has never been up to standard. Besides, their BIOS was never great to begin with. Usability is poor to say the least and none of their updates are properly documented. I won't buy from Asus or one of their subsidiaries any time soon.
What alternative do you recommend for MOBO? I was going to go ASUS but after watching this, I’m all set.
Youve got more patience than me. I fired them 10 years ago when i was using their server boards in my business and I had to get to the point in the chain of talking to the guy who released the bios that caused the problem and said guy didnt believe me until we did a screen share session where he could see me demonstrate the issue. Thank god our thorough testing found this issue before it went into production but that was the last straw for me.
That is not good at all, sounds bad. I have bought Asus for years now hearing that sort of things makes me think twice about the future of purchasing their products. Normally of course BIOS update is very risky and it can brick anything. It is rare though as long as you are careful but it still can happen. Most of time you do not need to do bios update. Now I am not too sure because of you said one phrase "Void the Warranty" If the BIOS brick it. It makes me think that is totally unacceptable. It is Asus responsibility for making BIOS for customer and that should have warranty just in case if it brick the motherboard. Now without warranty I am not confident anymore and not able to buy their product with motherboard that sometimes require BIOS update, especially security update for Windows operating system. Its disappointing to hear that news that you deliver it.
I was going to get two ASUS products ASUS ROG Strix B650-A Gaming WiFi 6E AM5 (LGA1718) Ryzen 7000 Motherboard(12+2 Power Stages,DDR5,3xM.2 Slots,PCIe® 4.0, 2.5G LAN,WiFi 6E,USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C® Port) and  ASUS ROG Strix LC II 240 ARGB All-in-one AIO Liquid CPU Cooler 240mm Radiator  so I guess I'll have to look for one can't get that now.
I’m glad to hear it wasn’t just me having this experience with Asus. I grew believing Asus was basically like the top of the line when it came to computer brands and I saved up to someday finely get one of those “Expensive but worth it” Computers that was pretty much 100% Asus parts. Of course I spent close to 2x as much for the brand name compared to others but I was so sure it was worth it. Well it was also the first lemon of a computer I ever got. I had weird BSOD errors that didn’t actually have a real error code constantly and randomly. It would work fine for a week or month and then just repeatedly crash on boot for several days. Fortunately I was still within a month of the first year of buying and could RMA it. Turns out they needed to completely replace the motherboard to fix the issue. The worst part is the customer service was so God awful that that experience alone, not the issues with the computer, has made me never want to buy Asus brand ever again. From a brand that is supposed to be well known for their brand experience, actually interacting with their customer service made me hate them so much I’m literally boycotting and refusing to buy Asus anything now. Seeing this video helps me know it wasn’t just a one off experience apparently. I wonder what happened to them?
Keep going like this and see if any manufacturer is ever gonna trust you enough to sponsor you again lol
cant get good free stuff these days
Jay,  Maybe functionality should be the primary goal of all builds, not what it looks like.  You seem to care more about what the PC looks like than the quality until the system doesn't work then you compromise.  Just sayin'.
Thanks for the warning!  I was considering buying the new Asus handheld… you just saved me hundreds of dollars.
I had an asus laptop from 2015 that still works and runs not great, but hey it still works even if laggy.  So I thought it was a good brand and decided to buy a PC from them.  1800 dollar fucking pc doesn’t turn on as soon as I get home, after 30 mins with “customer support” having me repeat the serial number serval times, I decided to return the product.  My ibupower PC lasted 2 years and my cyber power PC lasted a little over a year, those experiences sucked ass, but to say that the “trusted” Asus brand was the worst experience in dealing with a brand I ever had in my life compared too those two shit companies saying how much shit the asus brand is now.  Never fucking again asus. Never.
I remember being told that going gigabyte is bad idea, after I ditched ASUS in 2019.   My Aorus mobo after all this time still work perfectly fine.... Bye ASUS.
Does the Z790-P Prime suffer from issues too? Whenever I read about these issues this Prime lineup seems to be fine? Can anyone share their persoective?
Missed a chance to title it A.SUS
Asus was my way to go when we talk about MB and GPU.. its so bad  to see what they are doing
would this be why ive had constant issues with windows 11, with its audio randomly going and then coming back when i have to toggle the volume level.
Yeah back in 2019, I bought a ASUS desktop and it kept on freezing or turning the monitor off so much that I decided to never buy another ASUS.
rtx 4090ti is worth 300 billion worth of movies or more
Their sound card gave me hearing damage. YKW tinnitus is? I do. If you think my comment is just trashing our dear friend for no real reason, just lookup “Xonar Essense stx Random LOUD high pitched Ringing.” I couldn't figure it out why they didn't want to address a stupid problem like that back then, but, now, I guess I know.
Damn. I’m looking to build my first PC around a Ryzen 7 5800X i got, and i had planned on an ASUS mobo with good reviews, but i guess i’ll have to rethink that now. It wasn’t a newer board, i don’t think, but i don’t wanna chance it after seeing this
That's really unfortunate. I've been a big ASUS fan for years. So sad. Too bad. :( I used to build Asrock boards before. I guess that's where I'll return. Thanks for the heads up. ;)
AGREED! I had nothing but issues when building my first Ryzen build. Went back to Gigabyte and will never switch again.
Being that this is the ONLY company that has ever given me issues with motherboards. I second this! Their strix cards are the only thing that was decent quality.
that's pretty fucked up, and is making me reconsider replacing my ASUS Stryx 970 with a more modern Stryx card. Thanks for sharing and for the integrity.
As a consumer who has been buying Asus and ROG hardware for over 14 years, this is very disappointing to see. We as a community help Asus and support ROG with debugging and testing to make things better for the rest. "Releasing" a "beta" update and then expecting consumers to be test it knowingly that it'll void their warranty is a recipe for disaster on so many levels. The genius at Asus signed off on this has really messed this one up. I love ROG but this behaviour especially with enthusiast hardware is unacceptable.
Hi Jayz I managed to get a G11CB-I/H170 (lga1151) motherboard super super cheap (£25gbp) with a i5 6500. I’m wondering what is the maximum this motherboard can handle. Does it support the i7-7700? I can’t find a motherboard manual online. If anyone can get the info my friend it’s you 😊😅 Thanks man
ASUS is Asian shit
well done!
Wow, I was at one point considering an Asus board for the build I made earlier this year and I'm glad now that I didn't
I got lied to and screwed over by Asus mobo support some years ago and haven't touched them since.
I wish these PC part companies mad modular parts. Dont like a particular color swap it out for these shields or plastic pieces... the aftermarket painting / graphics would go crazy
This is not an effective it way of begging money from Asus. Try different strategies to get money from them . This won’t work
I have been loyal to ASUS since very early 2000's ... about 20yrs,  but forget that!  This is inexcusable!
My TUF 3060 TI has artifacts now
Why do you burn bridges like this mate ?
I bought a Nitro 5 (17 inch) a few months ago. I hope I don’t have this issue. Idk what board is in tbh. Lol
I've never liked ASUS myself. Gigabyte is off my list as well..... Not that many choices left.
Jay!!! which MSI mobo are you using for "MegaMan!"
I'll be back when my new ASUS motherboard arrives and is installed, this does not look good.
Good on you Jay! Least you guys have your buttholes intact, unlike most YouTubers.
Not a massive computer guy, but I respect and support anyone who stands up to unethical business dealings and works to get truthful, accurate reviews out to the consumer. Dollars are finite and are getting more so for us consumers. We really need people like you to use your influence to protect us. Thank you.
In Germany the biggest PC Hardware Online-Shop "Mindfactory" banned ASUS products for a reason. 👍🏻
So what's a better brand of motherboard provider to buy now
i really had a bad experience with Asus boards .. msi for me is the best solution
Used to love asus. until i purchased a "ROG" keyboard. For a 200$ keyboard i was more than upset. What a disgrace. A 40$ keyboard sol to people willing to spend more.
damn been a big asus mobo buyer for a long time wonder who i shuld switch to
Went with MSI for like 10 years now, never a problem. ASUS has fallen from grace years ago.
not only is ASUS doing poor in the hardware problem but also causing problems with their programs too
i bought their gaming monitor. i had to ask for servicing every month lol.. until i decided to change a new monitor
Im not on  anyones side because i have to pay for products i buy  all are the same gigabite video broken ,leadtech the same they dont exist anymore etc ,sow i dont tell that others are good like nvidia mafia but are the best in videocards and asus mafia but nothing broken sow so far from them too.I dont know the contract between  you and them ,i like your videos you made some good money through hard work but you knot fire what you didont hire.😂  If you want it to have more effect ,let go of your nerves because you make mistakes when you have them and tell the truth,which may not be far from what you say.   I wish for everyone to have good quality parts at good prices.
runnin a tractor at this point.
just dont touch amd, that is problem, not asus.
The ps2 mouse and keyboard ports are a huge turnoff.
I only noticed the heatsink on the chipset of my b450-f strig rox was backward when I was looking into installing an m.2, and noticed it wouldn't actually fit on the mobo. Should have taken pictures, but working up the nerve to gut the system and fix that myself was real shitty. I hope asus gets their shit together.
over the last 20 years i have always had asus motherboards  and have had good reliability from them , one board had a recall years ago and they swapped it out , but i had no problem personally, its always hard with comparability with any brand to make parts that work seamlessly together , but you only know how good  a company is when you have problems , i have had my Z590-a for many years in now and its never missed a beat for me , just purchased there 1000w tuf power supply ( atx 3 )  if its half as good as my seasonic has been after over 15 year  service i will be pleased , needed the extra power for   7900 xtx vs sapphire nitro+ will be keeping an eye on them now ...
Well, well, well. I went thru 3 Asus z690 wifi plus D4 to get a working one. The time wasted and self doubt on building PCs for 20 years for this issue Asus will never repay. This was a Microcenter special so it had to be that board (buy a 12700k and get the board for free). Even a guy at the store overhearing with the sales person said to me: "You gonna get that board? I'm waiting from the customer service to verify mine since it doesnt boot up". Same what happened to me after 2 boards and third, one Im using, is a charm finally. Yes, the condescending troubleshooting stuff is also infuriating even more so when I said I was on my second board not booting up and they said "it was extremely rare for that to happen". Well, this video explains it and seems it's true their quality has been going to the shithole for a few generations now.   Word on AsRock, it was the only brand I used for years and this was about 10 years ago so their crap phase was a dodged bullet. Same with Gigabyte, boards that lasted 6-7 years and then they went a crapoid phase and hopefully they are good again because I got a gaming laptop from them. Same with AsRock, got parts to build a music production PC. Lets see if those brands are back to what Asus was and its glaring Asus is now where those brands were.
Random but when Jay said “breaking the third wall”, he’s not technically wrong since they’re filming in a corner!
I have gotten Second degree burns from my Asus Laptop, Not even gaming and Shocks from the Case, the outer plastic housing has a charge going through it on both sides of the touch pad resulting in a tingling, quick "static shock" even stinging shocks. I noticed this about a Year in, but didn't worry to much, after 2 years and me burning my hand to the point of Red, raw, dry, skin and small blisters, There Customer Service basically told me because my Laptop is 2.6 years old "its expected to have normal wear on the PC" My last Computer I had for 10 years.  I will never buy another Asus.
Jay thank you for this video.
That's a shame to hear as I always loved Asus. The computer I built back in 2018 had primarily Asus/ROG components in it. Guess my next one will be from MSI then.
I did like Asus and always had this feeling that their products are not super reliable , but after this not sinking my money in a sub par brand with quality only in advertisements
Is it ironic that my Asus ROG laptop with a 960m juat blew a cap? Or is it planned obsolescence?
Keeps getting part’s after parts for free complaining that there is dust in pins. If you actually paid for the parts you have rights to complain if you don’t STFU.
This guy doesn't take himself for shit... A real diva! It's funny to hear him talk about other people's arrogance. He shouldn't look at himself often.
Old gamer from literally the 20th century who had to getva job and NOT build or upgrade in over 2 decades. So I'm very ignorant. But you just said you chose something, hardware! because the way it looked? WTF is going on. The way the thing looked in your personal box! SNOB
I have damn near the same rig you do. I get random BSOD 4-6x a day, stock. Win11 pro. Sound will randomly get boosted and sound like dog sh*t. My 32GB of RAM @ 6000 MHz used to register 32GB, but after a reboot it said it detected 8 GB... WTF?! Another reboot and it's back to 32 GB. WTH!? This was my last AMD/ASUS build. MSI/Intel moving forward.
Shit I was about to order a ROG Ally, was a bit hesitant thinking about warranty and quality. This pretty much made up my mind. :/
Speaks volumes about ASUS quality control.
I had similar issues with my Samsung 980 pro ssd and found a lot of people do. Customer support was atrocious and no acknowledgement of the issues.
this is too bad, I have an Asus maximus 9 running since 2016 and it has been rock solid. I don't think I would totally stop buying Asus. dunno maybe your just a bit butt hurt?
Glad to have seen this video before I did my build! Influenced me enough to go with an Asrock motherboard and I am very happy with it!
I make no judgement on the video and Jay's decision, except to say that there's no such thing as "Freedom of Information Act" (FOIA) as it relates to ASUS and Jay or whatever. FOIA refers to US governmental openness relative to its citizenry and disclosing documents related to governmental functions. A private company is not impacted by FOIA one way or the other, and a customer of that company could not exercise a so-called FOIA claim on a company. FOIA has absolutely nothing to do with a private business. Thus, I don't understand what he's saying. Still upvoted.
MSI boards have always been better than Asus and less expensive
So I just took the time to go back through all my orders.   Notice how inflated the ASUS ROG Maximus Hero line has increased over the years?   My last 4 Builds ALL INCLUDED an ASUS ROG Maximus Hero Motherboard:   1. $229 Z270 with a 7700K  2. $260 Z370 with a 8700K   3. $399 Z490 with a 10700K   4. $599 Z690 with a 13700K (Don’t have this one, just put to show)   5. $629 Z790 with a 13700K Fucking explain  Please Fucking Explain…..
Damn it! They should care! ASUS has always been my goto motherboard brand. I havent had luck with anything MSI in my early computer days... talking Athlon 1600 days. Im about to try a Gigabyte board. Good luck, I hope I can come back to you asus... but not if this is how your going to treat someone that reps your brand.
I will not buy ASUS never again. F them they already ask for too much money on boards or cards.
Something involving Integrity #°RandyMarsh
I bought a Zephyrus G14 that started blue screening every 3-5 minutes. I did everything I could for three months. Reinstalling  updated every driver a dozen time, installed Linux….  I finally sent it back to Asus after reporting the problem and it took them 6 weeks to install the OEM Windows 10 OS. I got it back, turned it on, selected “windows update” and it blue screened. I recorded the BSODs I could, and recorded the black screen freezing, crash logs, Bluescreen reader output, and shared logs with multiple communities… Asus refused to do anything.  I upgraded the RAM, SSD, ram every memory/drive test imaginable, I even bought software that does some crazy driver inspections and tests. No dice. I have some 90+ videos and pictures of ONLY the failures I managed to collect before Windows rebooted itself.
Im a store manager in a gold store Asus in italy, i shared the video to the  country MB manager..i hope they will regain their quality to best brand
Well I don't care because I use AsRock and MSI.
asus laptops are garbage, had one, bsod, sent it back, still had issues, stay away from anus, um... asus
sucks i really liked asus, still feel like my z690 was at fault for my last pc going out, now i just got two of these new boards the x670e and z790, wish id of went with another brand now for mobos :(
has 3 x ASUS ROG Laptops for my 2 boys and I     Mine has the best specs but a tons of software issues.....
Made the mistake of buying an ASUS laptop, wondering if the issues I'm having are down to the BIOS
Why are they still making motherboards with useless outdated PSI slots???
So that is like us going to the shop buy a new Asus product that is very much tied to string as you are walking out thinking you will have a good day only for them to pull the string and watch us blow up on the way out. Great thank you Asus good to know we got MSI and Gigabyte.
The only notebook i owned where gpu burned was Asus, and not today was Like 2012. They replaced The Board and The gpu, but The chassy was still falling apart. It had a metal radiator on the side, but it enlarged over time and ended by not connecting anymore correcly to The plastic chassis
What about BIOS support for x570? Are they still to be trusted? I have a TUF motherboard, this worries me.. i've set my bios manually to values i think was safe enough to gain max performance but hearing this i don't know if i even want to update my bios firmware anymore
Truly a sus company
Their rog phone also have bad quality too especiall rog 5 where dead issue is a daily thing you see. And im one of them. Wasted money on their product
That is why for years I was saying MSI is the best.
I was going to buy an Asus Strix ROG 4090 OC.  Should I stay away.  My first option would be the 4090FE but can't get it in Australia.  Should I get a Gigabyte Aurous Master 4090 or do are they poor choice as well?
I myself have 100% failure rate on 2 Asus motherboard I owned over the past years. The last being b550 f gaming. It just not going to turn on after 1-2 months usage. No more Asus.
I have the same Apex board. It's an absolute monster of features & performance. I really hope I don't run into the same problems regarding any rma issues if I ever need to.
It's been a long time. I remember when you started to do this full time. 3.89 M subscribers. I'm so happy for you.
Wished I would’ve known about this when I built my PC, great job Jay
bro has beef with asus 😭
Thanks Jay.  I built a system years ago on ASROCK because the person wanting the system just did not have the budget for another board like Gigabyte, MSI, or ASUS.  I know what you mean about ASROCk being bottom of the barrel at one time.  We RMAed 5 boards for that system over a month before they got me one that lasted and boy did it last, after 15 years that board is still running fine as a media station for a TV.  The problem then was the cheap CPU capacitors among other things, they'd pop off and the system was done after 2 to 4 of the 8 died, you'd even hear their little aluminum jackets bounce off the inside of the case when they popped.  It doesn't game anymore but it does Netfilx, Hulu, etc and has tons of old videos recorded on the TV Tuner card and stored on a 4 TB HDD.  I knew ASROCk was rough back in the day but that clinched itfor me I haven't built a system on them since even when people begged because the price was right.  It might be time to give them another look.
I love all of my asus devices
It's not complicated.  They used to manufacture in Taiwan, but they thought they could save money by manufacturing in China.
I black listed asus 12 years ago because of their board and bios.
To the workforce of ASUS, the people on the ground doing the real work; my advice is to start weighing your options over the next couple years and moving to other companies. Most of you like with any company are working hard. Dont get layed off, leave them. Unless they do something real in the next few months, they are headed to fail in the next 8 years and layoff will start way before then. Ive seen this 100 times before.
Guess i will buy a legion now and not a rog
I got my ASUS motherboard about 3 years ago and my graphics card is Asus.. D:
i have b450-f gaming II mobo now and for some reason almost every week I get a blue screen, especially after updating drivers from Armoury crate
This is the company that puts Threadlocker on their PC's.  Never buying from them again.
"You'll own nothing, and be happy."
We’ll see how the shareholders feel about asus latest fumble
at least they said sorry, asus Middle East will not even look at your email
My 3090 White edition was absolute trash. Constantly crashed my pc. $2k for nothing
BRAVOOOO!!!! WELL DONE!
I've never had a problem with them.
I love when you're audio went out you say you've been "AMD'd"! haha just proves to me that there ARE still audio issues with AMD no matter what the cultist AMD worship fanboys say! That's why I refuse to go back to AMD for anything!
Sad, I wanted the zephyrus m16 but now i will avoid it, there are also some negative reviews on amazon regarding the quality and customer support.
Little late to the party, But My 7950x3d on my msi b650m is rock solid 5.5/64ddr5 expo np here... no anus oops sorry asus here.
im glad someone is finally holding a manufacturer responsible for their bullshit. when are we going to talk about forcing scarcity?
Good to know about this.
If a company says <if you touch a screw on my card you void the warranty> well sorry but they are not worthy!
Fagnerd theres no drama
I run a computer shop in the UK, and two years ago we dumped the Asus brand from our product range. I cannot begin to explain the incompetence of this company; their RMA system is an absolute joke and they make zero effort to resolve any issues with their products. Great video and I hope it gets shared by millions.
I’ve stayed away from ASUS for a while now. Had two monitors that started to develop dead pixels after the one year warranty period expired. I could understand one dud but the fact that both of them have this issue tells me it’s a quality issue.
All the motherboard manufacturers are guilty of not properly supporting their hardware with good software. Anything that is first party software, lately, seems to be utter trash lately. Corsair... Razer... GIGABYTE! There are others too. But those are ones I have personally had, and returned because the software was utterly limited or useless outside of installing and forgetting it does something...
Am about to build a new computer soon, high specs and all. Was going to get a bunch of asus components becaus i thought they were solid good products! Luckily i found this video, wont get any asus in my new rig! 👌
dont forget armoury crate. its by far the worst software ive ever used if it comes to something that goes in combo with your system. it always bricks drivers and messes with other stuff
Lol asus just lost 1.7 mill customers 😂😂😂
I can’t change my behavior based on a Youtube-channel/Manufacturer feud. I have to go by my own experience. I have 2 high end Asus Zenbook laptops and they have been rock solid performers. I will continue to keep Asus in the competition when I am choosing new hardware.
I don't know if it has to do with Asus' snootiness, but I've been wondering for a few years now why the biggest German hardware dealer doesn't sell Asus products anymore. They have completely disappeared from the shop. Asus is just a popular brand, for whatever reason. I have never understood the overpriced products and that people pay so much money for a product just because it says Asus on it. But I think it's good and right that you draw red lines here and say "Up to here and no further".
My Asus laptop has a malfunctioning trackpad that stops working and nothing seems to bring it back except rebooting multiple times. Sent it back to Asus. Came back with same problem. Finally having to use a USB mouse.  Gave up and retired it to the junk pile.  Bought HP laptop.  Trackpad works fine.  The wifi keeps going off line.  You have to reboot multiple times to get it back.  Finally plugged in an external USB wifi.  The overall quality of computers has really gone downhill.
Well, I guess my (currently all ASUS) rig will get a massive shift in hardware manufacturer once I finally move off my first Gen Ryzen
Damn - Here i am wondering if i should buy the Asus Rog Strix 4090 or the MSI....
I wonder which of Asus' competitors has sponsored these videos.
hi jay ,,,where do i start ,,lol from Cleveland Ohio im 53 been building since 1988 loved a lot of computers when they use to give all the shiny lol meaning software and support i got a asus tuf x670 mother and a Ryzen 7 7700x with a asus 3060 ti tuf game  v2 was keeping with the build to the tuf theme one day i  put the gpu in the sys when i got it and the hole thing died got stuck on memory light so i updated the bios and nothing ,,i am on disability fixed income so i buy a part at a time ,,i changed out the mem thinking that was it ,,not it ,,,sent in the motherboard for rma and should had took photos before i did because they said it had bent pins so ,,i could pay 120.00 more for a replacement so i did ,,got it back and still nothing everything was dead ,,wasnt thinking it was a cpu problem since i had not overclocked it ,,really was upset about it ,,sent the cpu back to the people i got it off of e-bay they were real nice on a refund ,,,they had in there add no retuns but they helped me out anyhow ,,got a norther cpu and a air conditioner  blowing directly on it since i saw steve cast on the motherboards and cpu problems ,,i did a bios update ,,i wrote asus about this and let them know that it was wrong ,,didnt hear back yet and its been about 2m this keeps me ocupied i cant get around that well and the money i put into this and to have a huge corp like asus or amd  just say eat it hurts
I remember when my friend bought his rog Mainboard  We wanted to remove the usb3 cable from onboard and without any force, he pulled out the io-port :c   Up to this Moment, even budget Mainboards haven't had this problem...
Sadly the majority of problems is down to user error or abusing the equipment. Anything that shows bent pins or physical damage was most likely to be caused by the user.
That sucks to hear i love my asus rog strix g15 laptop but if there messing around like this it might ve the last of there products i use
I just bought a new ASUS GAMING LAPTOP. It runs ok but the wifi adapter really sucks and the speakers really suck. Most of the time I have to turn the volume all the way up and still can't hear it. I have to use an external wifi adapter to get any kind of speed.
Good to know. I am getting as much info as I can to build my first custom PC in the near future and this would have been a dissapointment if I had to buy something that would have broken my pc
Another situation where someone’s been the hero long enough to become the villain. If you ask me asus is doing the same thing a lot of companies are doing right now. Sacrificing the consumer to hold onto the money in the ceo/investors pockets. But that’s just my perception.
Hey i don't know if anyone gonna see this comment, but i am saving up to build my own first pc. And i was thinking of using ASUS PRIME X670E-PRO WIFI, but im not sure if its a good option or not.
thanks for putting this out as i was about to start putting some thought into a new build after having my current pc for 5 years and is about time for an upgrade. Ive always loved the style ROG asus parts have, but i'll just have to go with something else till they fix their shit.
I bought a asus tuf fx506li laptop 3 years ago. Now, my wifi never worked. It just stops automatically. They never solved this problem. Now my laptop is almost dead. There is always crunching sound inside my laptop. But my laptop never got a single blow from anything like waters or balls etc. not even a single scratch on it either. This mf laptop only lasted like 3 years.
It is kinda sad to see my fav brand go so far down so fast. :( I'm still very satisfied on my AM4 build w ASUS, the 570 Prime Pro and 3090 Strix. I'd like to jump up to a similar AM5 build w ASUS but have lost confidence as a consumer. I need to be able to create confidently and have productivity stability at a high level, ASUS used to be able to provide that, and look beautiful doing it. The dollars don't make sense even if you look beautiful but have to spend hours chasing BSODs and wondering if your $2000 is going to catch on fire lol.
Here's an idea. Take all your unwanted Asus products and donate them to a local high school computer class. Tell the teacher whats wrong with the products and let the kids have at them. Nothing beats hands on learning.
Drama queen
Is this just with pc motherboards? I got a top of the line ASUS ROG strix 17 SE laptop last year. No issus so far.
I've stopped buying Asus more then 6 years ago. When every single Asus board started to go bad on me. Capacitors blown. Random bis glitches, stability issues, reboots, etc, etc. Then the same shit started to happen with Asus Graphic Cards.  Boards stop working right after warranty, or just before. Nothing would ever be fixed claiming it was me. I have NOT had the same issue since I switched to Gigabyte boards. And since then I now have 3 PCs sitting on me and still working. Gave it away to kids and nephews and got 8 year old machine that still works with Gigabyte parts.   Asus is permanently on a blacklist for me. I would go as far as to say that any of the industries I touch on if I hear Asus I will advise to get rid of it asap.
G'day Jay ol son....Do these issues go back a wayz, i have a X470 Tuf Plus board for my Ryzen 5 2600, do  i need to worry about🤔😳. Im on a Disability Pension and cant afford my only connection to the outside being a bloody "Asus" Bomb sitting beside me😱 Cheers for this Very important update, from Downunder🙃
I bought a ROG Zephyrus for Christmas last year, it probably has 100 hours of runtime and the screen has started going out.
So ASUS has garbage QC, Gigabyte has massive security vulnerabilities in their motherboard firmware.... guess MSI or hell, AsRock it is when I do my next build.
The problems you describe, especially with customer support, are ones I've been having for many, many years. My region support is trash. I had to RMA a monitor 4 times, because they either sent worse ones, broken ones or the wrong damn model. I dread bad Asus products for fear I will get screwed with support. And RMA is a lottery system.
Funny... I had 2 ASUS mobos and both loved to not work with one specific CPU I had (oldie FX4350). I thought CPU is dead so.... Now I have 2 ASUS mobos, 2 FX4350 and 1 Sempron or whatever I received with one of those mobos. That taught me to avoid ASUS mobos. And it was prior to Ryzen's release.  So for now lessons I learned are. Avoid WesternDigital HDDs, Gigabyte PSUs, ASUS mobos and Razer (they have software enforcing "damaged state" to force you buy new one).
MSI is garbage as well. Everyone needs to boycott that as well.
asTHetics lol
If you don´t want them send them to me. Maybe I can use them..... I live in Estonia  :D
Gigabyte motherboards for life!
I have bought ASUS monitor, motherboard and laptop.. ALL HAVE BROKEN!!! Customer service was terrible as well!   THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING THIS OUT !
I just bought the AP201 case, can't wait to build in it. It cost me about 95 US dollars.
My full rog build experience for  support and return for replacement  is terrible as hell please avoid the brand trust the video
Ill take one of the X670E to finish my build :) 🤩, it really sucks they are going down this path, as my last build was a total TUFF Gaming system all the way.
Sad cause my Asus motherboard is bullet proof. Now that they trashed themselves I might have to go ASRock
Now do Nvidia
im proud you did this, people needed to see and asus needed to repent. big business' shouldn't screw the consumer who made them
Never thought I see the day Asrock is solid As a Rock
I will continue buying Asus. Great products I love everything abous Asus.
What a bummer, everything i have is from asus, like from 2017/18 and works great.
7 years ago i had to change their first g sync monitor for 7 times !!!!! the 8 one was a new the others where so crappy "reppaired worst then the one i shipped to them....i had to write with a chief she send me after 7 changes a new monitor thanks to her wtf asus tthinks
Hi Jay, I just found your channel.  I can afford to buy broken stuff. Would a Z790  be a good choice with I7 13700K Raptor lake 3.4 ghz sixteen core lga 1700 processor . With ddr 5 6000 mem
Thanks 😒 Now I have to rethink my build.....also great work Jay on taking care of the consumer, WE appreciate it ✌🏽
All the pcs I've built have had Asus mobos looks like it's time to give another brand a chance
I WILL N E V E R PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM ASUS PERIOD BECUASE JAY HAS SHOWN ME THE WAY!
ASUS is a heating trash peace of tech. A dirty secret of theirs: they always tend to put their power components very near or close to where the heat is, and If you haven't noticed that after all these years then you indeed deserve the trash ASUS you're using...
As of today this video has a 100k likes and almost 2 million views. Asus better get their shit together as this has sent shock waves through the community.
I have the hero in my pc…I’m guessing I need to get rid of it.
Thank you so much for being pro consumer. I really think it is some of the best GOOD you can do for humanity. More than every corporate greed is destroying the world and economy. All for a new yacht and the bottomline.
Gigabyte, everything. no complaints to this point.
i was just thinking on buying a laptop(ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 with 76WHr Battery Ryzen 7 Octa Core 6800HS - (16 GB/1 TB SSD/Windows 11 Home/8 GB Graphics/AMD Radeon 6700S)); then should i reconsider this?
I really respect the balls to do this! Been watching this channel for years along with Gamers Nexus. You two are carrying this side of youtube.
that "stuff" was totally post-production lol I get what you were doing and it's almost funnier than a bleep... almost.
Asus doesn't care what you think, Jay.  Never have and never will....   For every Jay that is done with Asus, there are 50 new "Jay-clones" lining up to support the brand.  So really... whose firing who?
I will never purchase another ASUS product again. ASRock is great !
"We want to address the concerns that have been raised by our users about whether recent BIOS updates will impact the warranty of ASUS AM5 motherboards. We would like to reassure our customers that both beta and fully validated BIOS updates for ASUS AM5 motherboards are covered by the original manufacturer’s warranty. We would also like to confirm the following points:  1. The ASUS AM5 motherboard warranty also covers all AMD EXPO, Intel XMP, and DOCP memory configurations.  2. All recent BIOS updates follow the latest AMD voltage guidelines for AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors.  Furthermore, we would like to reiterate our commitment to supporting the AMD AM5 platform and our customers. For any further inquiries about your ASUS AM5 motherboard, please contact our customer service for support."  -- Asus  Haha, now everything is covered only to save themselves, beta bios, expo/xmp, everything is under a warranty, lmao.
Well.. Never an ASUS product for me ever again
Asus is officially cancelled for me.
Over the years I've used Asus boards in all my PCs. I guess I've been lucky I've not had issues with them, especially in the latest builds. Thanks!
I’ve built a ton of systems the last 6 years.  Never had one issue.  You’re just a YouTuber.  That’s it.  You’re barely qualified to even talk about this stuff and have a very inflated opinion of your skill level.  I’ll continue to use Asus and I will be fine as will Asus.  You’re a bit of a drama queen.  You like to screw with voltages and timings and then cry when things break.  It’s pathetic to see so many people in the comments let this guy make their buying decisions for you.
@1:14 - "Keep your stuff" - what was the original? =P
And that's exactly the reason why I've only bought MSI for years now.
Switch to MSI
Very cool to see you're on top of this with Asus.  I finally abandoned them altogether when I returned a $350 motherboard for faulty power connections and they refused to repair or replace AND sent me pictures of bent pins in the CPU socket that WEREN'T bent when I sent it in for warranty work.  Other incidents before that led me to believe they've turned into a garbage company for the last few years and I'm DONE with them.
Never liked or bought Asus. Always preferred other brands for motherboard auch as Asrock and MSI. (I used to really like Abit a LOT of years ago but they vanished)
Thanks Bro, Boycotting all their crap.
asus for those who dare to explode?
Asus used to be the best and coolest. I hope they come back strong.
ROG took the bluetooth, RGB lights and FN functions hostage, because their mandatory driver doesn't work. they took these functions forever, and now i have an almost inert keyboard. thanks ROG for taking my hardware hostage and giving me no recourse. no hardware is safe from bugged bloatware. we need a new criteria called "full driver independency"
Having issues with my desktop as we speak, p.c. won't boot due to a GPU POST failure. I replaced the GPU twice, the Motherboard twice (both ASUS), the RAM, the PSU, the CPU cooler and the case...every single item has been replaced and I am still getting GPU failures on boot. I will say, the first ASUS MoBo was legit bad due to issues with RAM. With 4 sticks installed, won't boot either.   It is sad to see how far they have fallen.
I bought an ASUS gaming laptop for my daughter in Aug 2022. A BIOS update bricked the computer. When I contacted them, they said my warranty expired in JUNE 2022! How is it possible that the warranty expired BEFORE I purchased the computer from MicroCenter? MicroCenter even contacted them on my behalf and they won't budge. So now I'm stuck with a $1000 dead laptop after 6 months of use cause apparently the warranty expired months before I purchased it.
I agree with this.  I cant believe Asus has gotten so awful
Powerfull and iv found the man with the brass cannonballs here!  and to be honest enough builders use your channel jay to actually follow what you advise.  well done for actually doing this and making the point.
Oh wow, now my PC crashes make sense, I've bought an Asus Rog Strix motherboard, and since that time I was experiencing random crashed with my PC, specially with gaming (fortunately I got it pretty stable right now), but this is a shame. I've also got issues with my monitor as well lately, also a product of Asus now everything makes sense.  Thank you very much for your video Jayz
My experience with ASUS had me wishing MSI on installation.
I will avoid this brand in future too. I have bad client experience too. My Bluetooth does not work and they refused to RMA. They said the vendor should not sell overseas and the vendor is Amazon. They said they got no control over where Amazon sells the product.
I’ve not been paying too much attention to Drama but I’ll not be touching another ASUS product just because of issues with their products. Got a z690 ddr5 motherboard from them and it’s just absolute trash and has been nothing but problems. The MSI I replaced it with has been solid.
I got a b650-i and my front usb wont detect my usb sticks or my xbos controller dongle. My boot time is 45 seconds with the newest bios. Amoury crate totally sucks. I feel your pain
bye bye asus known for a long time this would happen
Just built my first machine in almost 7 years, its a beast. Got the Z790-E and a Strix 4080.. thing is insane
Yah, I used ASUS a lot over the last 5-10 years, but left them out of my new build.
I git an asus ROG Strix B650-e Gaming Wifi.  Dropped a Ryzen 7900x in it, and 32 GB of G.Skill Expo ram.  When I built the rig at the very beginning, I was having huge stability issue.  Going from 2 sticks of ram to 1 helped a bunch.  So I swapped ram with another system.  The G.Skill worked just fine, and the ram from the other system (some generic Samsung) had issues on my Asus Motherboard.  I reached out to Asus, told them what I had done, and my troubleshooting.  They told me that I got the wrong ram, and that I needed to buy XMP ram.  WTF.  Expo is specifically for AMD, XMP is not.  And to add insult to Injury, it took them 17 DAYS from initial contact, to when they finally replied to me.  17 DAYS.   Complete BS.  I built the system right when AM5 and Ryzen 7000 came out, and in the 17 days, a new Bios came out which fixed stuff, but I was just totally amazed that their initial decree, was that the problem was I was trying to use EXPO certified ram on an AMD Ryzen System.
Wow wow wow people are finally talking about this. I have a Asus X670-P Wifi that has insane ram instability. I have 3 m.2's on the board and when I boot only two will show. The same 2 always, after only restarting when I get into windows the 3rd m.2 will show. I bought an asus Laptop which was a $650 laptop and if I watch any Youtube videos or such it will lag and desync audio and video. Asus is such a shit brand and for years I've always avoided HYPE brands but gave in when I bought my new pc in December 2022 and this laptop at the same time. I wish I could go back and stop myself or assassinate my past self for making this decision that's how much I hate having Asus branded stuff in my house. Also my USB ports are so shit. I cant connect USB to my top ports otherwise the pc will BSOD if not windows will tell me that the device is unrecognized.
Hopefully it'll be the kick in the nuts Asus needs to look after its customers again.  Looks like they've lost focus.
Been arguing this for a couple of years now. ASUS warranty is in name-only. Had one laptop I sent in five times for a single issue. Each time it got worse. I ended up paying an ASUS authorized repair shop to manage the RMA for me. ASUS warranty accused the ASUS authroized repair shop of deliberately cutting a ribbon cable that ASUS warranty sent back to me cut.
I moved away from ASUS 2 years back. Their products are no longer top of the line, and once they release a product they're basically done with it. If there's a flaw you're stuck with it.
all u ever do is complain 🤦🏼‍♀️
literally on hold with Asus customer support for a clients laptop when this pops up on my feed
I’ve never had a problem with Asus.
Makes sense. Aligns with my x570 strix with one of the two Ethernet ports not staying in reliably (it will drop periodically). Plug on the Ethernet cable to the 2nd Ethernet port and it’s stable.  And yeah asus also did the “have you checked the Ethernet cable?” Nonsense. Yep. The first class cable wires back to a pro rack switch that worked for a decade and works just fine with the 2nd Ethernet port. But it’s the cable. Right.  Agreed. ASUS as a brand across all product likes is dead to me.
Uh oh. I’ve been loving all my tuff gaming gear .
I experienced bad support with Asus for years.
So glad I stopped buying Asus MBs a few years ago. I've had bad support experiences with them before but nothing like what's going on now. And I actually switched to Asrock on a recommendation from a white box builder friend of mine. He'd used 100s of their boards in his builds and had no bad CS experiences.
I take them all thank you...🙄🙄🙄😑
Sounds more like my experiences with MSI products.  Between my B450-A motherboard and my wife's MSI laptop, I'll never touch their products again.  The hardware is substandard  and their "support" wavers between gross incompetence to sheer arrogance.  I had bought that board because it met my particular desired specifications, but the USB is flaky at best (sometimes not even recognizing devices on USB3), pushing out BIOS updates that **FORCE** enabling (IN)Secure Boot on my Linux system, their Dragon utilities on my wife's computer that caused major stability and overheating problems on my wife's MSWin10 laptop (merely scrubbing that product off, without any other changes cleared up nearly all the problems there that weren't caused by crap hardware design).  Even the internal USB connections seem garbage, and an internal memory card reader on the desktop system is just as likely to not see any cards that are readily recognized elsewhere.  So from what you're saying, I should be looking at ASRock boards next.  Board colors don't matter to me as I never use window cases.  My current primary system uses an old IBM X3200 server case, with two optical drives and 4 HDD bays (front accessible).  It seems modern case manufacturers think you shouldn't have external drive bays anymore (to which I say why should I even buy a mid or full tower case then).  For that I might as well get the cheapest low-profile case if I have to pile some shedload of external devices on it.  That or nail together a case out of lightweight plywood.
I just bought a beautiful Rogstrix Z790-E with a gorgeous 4080, no problem at all! a magnificent purchase and quality products! My 13700K and Corsair Dominators run like butter, the MOBO is amazing, not sure why people complain that much
A shame, I have Asus products from 7 years ago and it's running like the day I built it. Guess things are slipping from those days. This video alone probably ruled Asus out completely for me as an option to consider on a next build.
The only thing I had to RMA in a long time was ASUS laptop... This explains alot. Not only did the screen stop functioning, but The OS they install had more issues than I can count lol
@10:30 you have a hard drive/SSD drive failure where your OS is installed. It causes random errors in windows. At a certain point your computer will become inoperable unless you switch OS drives. Better sooner than later.
Well no more Asus for me thanx for the vid!!
Along time ago i purchased a 750ti from asus with and it went out under warranty. Contacted them they then told me it wasn't under warranty then they said it was then they said if they couldn't fix it then i was not eligible for it to be swapped. Never ended up getting it fixed just bought a new gpu instead
ASSUS
I have 2 ASUS laptops both about 2 years old (rog zephyrus g14 and a zenbook duo). The zephyrus just randomly stopped turnning on. Might have been related to a recent windows update might not have been but it was so random and because it straight up doesn't turn on I can't troubleshoot it. At the same time, the zenbook duo can't stay powered on if the plug gets detached. Glad to see I'm not the only one.
TBH, I have entirely given up on PC gaming. My rig is 6 years old and I’m not building one any time soon. I recently bought a PS5 and I am good to go. It’s a relatively inexpensive investment and I get 60 fps 4K in most games, sit on my couch, plug and play. I’m too old for this shit anymore and have no interest in MMOs, shooters and Diablo style games, so need for a PC gaming computer.
TLDR for my comment: MSI sucks too, they all do in one way or another. Capitalism baby!!  I don't think you are going to find much different with the other top end competition. I once RMA'd a laptop to MSI and then they sent it back WITHOUT any thermal paste OR pads on. Thank god I took it apart to check their work! The RMA was for a bad TN panel (screen) and they ended up replacing the whole motherboard for no reason other than not liking my thermal paste application. I called them out on this and they didn't really do much to apologize or make up for it. In fact they just blamed me for the thermal paste upgrade I did, which reduced temps by 7c under load.
man it's like that with their other products as well!? I have 2 ROG phones, friend has one, rog 3, 5, 6. ALL had cpu issues and died, official service center charges over $700 USD for replacement. Told me to get just a new phone twice. They need to get their shit together with product quality.
❤Jay you Got this bro
My personal setup is running an ROG 6800XT LC...and a TUF 590X board...haven't had any issues for 2 years.  But also I'm a big advocate of "don't do updates if it ain't broken"...but I have seen many complaints and issues with newer Asus products.  I used to swear my Asus, but my next build is looking like an anti-Asus build
Hopefully EVGA expands more to take ASUS's place in the market
Hey I heard you want to build computers with our products and  post the builds on the internet. Here's a board that someone else returned. What can possibly go wrong there?
Really is a shame. Asus was the first motherboard company that gained my trust back when I started building computers. Prior to that I was buying the cheapest stuff I could find and things would burn out all the time back in the early 2000s.  I feel like they were one of the vanguards that really pushed for standardized quality.  I guess management has changed.  Seems all companies are falling apart.
7:00 - Had a similar issue, i bought a new ASUS board and got a already repaired one, the RMA infos incl. the original owners personal data like phone number, address etc. was still in the box...
Thanks for this. Asus has always been a go to company for me, but I've revised that opinion. At least all of my Asus gear is more than 3 years old.
I just did a build with an ASUS ROG Strix B650E-F for my nephew.  I had ram issues on the get go.  Finally got it to recognize the ram.  When installing windows I had a network error, had to bypass the windows 11 network check and finish then installed network drivers and it finally worked. Wifi I cannot get to run.  I installed an el Gato in the other vid slot and the computer fails.  I cannot get it to even boot.  Left that out and got the system up and running.  I also tried just a 10% boost and it crashed the board.  I wound up uploading a BIOS via the back port and it restarted.  This board has been an issue from the get go,  every issue Ive found on the net it has had.   Ive got him to order a new board NOT ASUS.  Ive been a fan of and a user of ASRocks boards for the last 10 years without issue.  So I got him to order one close to this strix board.  I used to do builds with ASUS boards, but never again.
I used Asus Monitor their warranty was so bad they just refund me instead of giving me warranty their 3 years of warranty is totally useless
GG!
cringe
I've asrock b450 board, its great for tweaking things : )  i think i'm just gonna update the bios for 5gen ryzen and stick with that. I had a feeling about this new "FX" ryzen family may cause problems with some boards. But this warrantyvoid bios updateXX..DDD lmfao
Thank you for showing me this, my next build was going to be asus.  Not now.
So ASUS is garbage
why upgrade a bios if your not having an issue,
Asus fucked me with the x370 mobo. I’ll never buy asus
Lmao good on ya, Jay keep up the good work 😅
You are literally molding the integrity of the domain. Much respect.
Bought a new Asus laptop a few months ago. It was close to their top-of-the-line unit. It was not cheap, i paid a lot of money for it. After using it for a few days i noticed that the wifi signal was extremely weak, and the bluetooth didnt work at all.  I figure the antenna probably didnt get connected during assembly. If it had been a cheapo laptop i'd picked up used, i wouldve just lived with USB wifi & BT dongles, but i bought it new, paid a lot of money for this system, it should work 100% ASUS wanted me to ship it to them, be without it for weeks, shipping at my expense, also wanted me to be ok with a bunch of disclaimers that made sure i was out in the cold if it got damaged in shipping... I just returned it to the store and got my money back. Still using my old laptop.
Respect!
have to agree.... yep. I've yet to update mine with my 3950x and I can say I'll by anything else... even a Mac.
Asus did repair my broken z790 mobo though
LAWL!!!!!!
I stupidly left my rog laptop on a cloth covered chair plugged in and I woke up in the middle of the night to a weird noise and there was smoke pouring out of it and it burnt the chair up
I bought a 2022 g14 a few months back and I'm not happy with it. It is perhaps the most bug riddled thing I have ever owned.
You’re a man of integrity Jay keep it up brother.
damn Jay is just a youtuber who gets stuff for free from the massive company that is asus and makes videos about those free products that then make him money, oh no whatever will asus do without you
I have had more bad Asus products straight out of the box over the years, than any other brands collectively.   It's really disappointing
I wish this had been recorded in January of this year.  I've loved ASUS motherboards for years, so when it came time to build a new PC, this time I decided to go with an Asus build.  I got an Asus motherboard, video card, and platinum rated power supply. I noticed system instability from the get go, but after updating drivers and messing with some settings, it was doing alright... kinda.  Then, 2 weeks ago, the power supply just dies.  4 month old platinum rated power supply.  Dead.  Now, I was thinking to myself, "Self, you know that statistically there's always a chance of a bad unit, even in the best rated lines."  So, then I had to deal with the Asus RMA process, were I get the honor of paying for shipping my dead PSU back to Asus, even when it's clearly a manufacturers issue.  I'm supposed to be getting back my repaired PSU tomorrow, so we'll see if it actually runs.  Thanks this vid, it's appreciated.
Asus is lacking in all departments, I just ordered a gpu from them and the power cable had 2 completely disconnected wires from it and they told me it's my responsibility to send them back the entire card for repair or buy a rog power supply for a replacement wire instead of just sending me a new wire.. Asus ROG Strix Geforce RTX 4080 OC edition btw
I thought it was just me... I bought a new ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E, in just a few months the PC would not boot. I replaced the powersupply, nothing. It turned out for some unknown reason the BIOS on a 6 month old firmware needed updated. After updating the 6 month old bios on the PC I just bought it started working again.  Even worse Asus support was useless. Clicked the support on amazon, that lead me to asrock who after several days just told me its not their problem and I needed to reach out to Asus not Asrock but could not provide a method of contact. Just dropped me and moved on.
On a separate note, I had a screen I had to claim warranty on with ASUS (not turning on). They were prompt to pick it up, but delivered a screen back that had been shattered??!! I emailed them back and: nothing. Radio silence. What a shame, never buying their stuff again.
Wow.....this world man
RIght so instead of panhandling for product buy it new like everyone else
YUP! I bought a ASUS PRIME Z390-A, the board was completely fried. I sent it in after I inspected everything... And low and behold, when they got it a pin was bent! Something that was not there when I checked it. After that, in my next build I bought a ASUS ROG Strix B550-I GAMING, that entire BIOS was corrupt, the plugs on the motherboard literally fell out when I tried to unplug cables to troubleshoot and every time I started that computer, the WIFI disconnected itself for no reason. 4 months of sending back and forth to them saying everything was great! Today I only go for MSI or Gigabyte. Its really sad because I used to love ASUS and always built with them every time I upgraded. End of an era...
Wow I was just about to buy that same exact Asus motherboard for an all White build. Dodged so many bullets.
*FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT?!?!?!?*  *EHO THE EVERLOVING F!$K DOES ASUS THINK THEY ARE?!?!?*  *THE FREAKING GOVERNMENT?!?!?!?!?!?!?*
Thank you for taking a stand and I stand with you.
pc gaming is *NASTY* these days my god
scumbags like asus are why us liberal democrats want governemental oversight over all these psychotic companies  vote democrat if you want more power as a consumer  vote republican if you want rich people to keep getting away with their shit    simple as that
Sound like Asus is trying to avoid replacing thousands of boards for free.
"Keep your stuff" 😂
I bought an ASUS display, where once it goes to sleep it does not detect a signal, so i have to cycle the power to wake it up. I had thought it was something i did. Now, i think maybe it is a design flaw.
I said it a 1000 times, Asus has best hardware and the worst software!!
OMG they lost my tablet at the start of pandemic with an RMA (tablet died after 3 months use). The courier investigation proved they received it. I got nothing.  lol they also got nothing for the new video editing rig, and the file server I got later that same year. They also didn't get my money for gaming laptop from this year. Glad to see ASUS getting thrashed even more publicly.  Fudge them!
I'm sure they won't care either, people will still buy their product lol
The same happening with Samsung they have local policies for RMA if you're not from the same region or even state they won't refund you anything or accept RMA. At least in EU.
can you fire MSI next? I am still upset because their customer service and hardware quality of a gaming notebook I bought 2014.
I've always used ASUS, if I'm still on the X570 platform and need to get one more Mobo, what brand would yall suggest?
Mai asrock and gigabyte been good
Moral of the story: Don't build. Just buy a laptop LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bumbling idiot bumbles for 15 minutes piling on with other influencers after shilling these products to YOU ALL for Years !!!!  He got Tens of thousands of dollars of free product to advertise that CRAP to you
The best laptop I've ever had, by far, was my last Asus laptop. The worst laptop I've ever had, by far, is my current Asus laptop. They went downhill very quickly... I'm not a tech nerd by any means, but it's pretty clear something has changed.
Complains about getting free motherboards from Asus, of course they not gonna give you brand new if they have some used ones in stock
That a very chinese idea
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to computer hardware, so I appreciate the heads up. When I buy my next computer, I'll avoid anything asus.
THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THIS!!  Scumbag Asus has failed with a lot on alot there products, especially with high performance laptops having coil wine. Biggest issue with them, once they have your money they will not fix any problems and dont care. Steam on the other hand, excellent hand held, customer service fix any problems you have. Good company at the moment, steam deck all the away and its cheaper.
So proud of you! I've been an asus fan and still have an (almost full including headphones) asus build but same as you I noticed issues are piling up on every single product, it takes insane amount of effort to work around crappy drivers + firmware + software, not to mention hardware issues because of BIOS bugs. I understand nothing is perfect but I wont give my hard earned money to a company that's making me sad every time I buy their products. So yes same as you no more asus for me for next build.
ASrock is just opening champagne .....
This stupid laptop had a fan that rattled - and they knew that was a fault in the series so they replaced it under warranty. That didn't fix the issue, it still rattled incessantly. Second time around they said they can't fix it. Sent me a new one. And what do you know it, as it neared the end of warranty its started rattling as well. They didn't fix the faulty fans, they simply shipped out the same ones and hope they work long enough so that people can't have it fixed under warranty any more.
the gpus are only good because all they do is make a heatsink and cooler. Cant for the lights too
LOL really... the last several years? I build my first computer back in 2005 with them, and never again......... they are also great on paper, but not so good running down the line.... Just like Apple with most of their products....
*consumer goodwill
i always knew asus was crap since I was a kid just looks cool but a shitty company
Bud Light is still worse hahahaa
Call them out on their RMA process being terrible too. My x13flow hits 95c in seconds of opening a game and throttles itself to sub 2ghz but "passes stress tests no fault found"
Hence why i avoid Asus especially their gaming phone as a mobile gamer no matter how much they hype it I'll stick to redmagic thank you its better
Asus is crappy company from begging. I have very bad experience with them all history of Anus company 😢
ggs asus
i was gonna get an ally now i’m never buying an asus product again
I have a Z390TUF with a i9-9900k alongside a RoG3080Ti, I've had the motherboard for a few years now and I then got this GPU when it released. I can truthfully say I've had zero issues with ASUS. Other than your word I'd have no reason to question the company, it does everything I ask of it so far.
Help I was about to buy the scar then the news came out about Asus. What's the best performing non Asus alternative?
i look at ur videos so i can build my computer and now im back to square one now idk what cpu or motherboard to buy lmfaooo damnn
20 years ago I switched to Asus because I had no confidence left in other brands. Looks like I’ll go back to MSY again
I’ve literally bought a hundred boards since 99 and the most reliable have been from ASROCK and EVGA. The dozen or more ASUS boards I bought, didn’t make it past 2 years. Haven’t taken a chance on another ASUS product for 10 years.
I love AMD, and prefer them over Intel. Bought nothing else since Ryzen was released. This week, after a particular nasty experience trying to get a build using a 7800x3d to work with a quality RAM set, I sent all the parts back and got an Intel chip with a z690 motherboard instead. Everything worked, on the first try - using some old DDR 4 I had flying about. AM5 wasn't ready for release, AMD better take heed to not repeat the mistakes of the past. Until I see a stable product from AMD, I'll be buying more Intel chips.
Yay, just checked my rig and it's MSI! Will avoid ASUS from now on just like Razor accessories. I wonder how many of the 1.6M viewers of this vid will change their preferences in the future.
times have come when creators fire the sponsor instead of vise versa
My Asus laptop I got in january keeps crashing too since I bought it
Wow I have a ASUS motherboard in the trunk of my car that is going to UPS tomorrow as an amazon return. It wouldn't POST sigh. I AM almost certain that IT was not a "NEW" board. sigh. FOR going on 30 years...ASUS has always been my go to brand. I have lost my trust in what I buy AND who I buy from.
What board do i buy then
These stuff smell like company espionage. Only need 1 correct engineer to turn your corp rep into poop.
That tells me been over and spell run
I don't even watch this channel, and this video was just one of the random ones on the main page when I loaded Youtube........and I have respect and appreciation for this channel's honesty/ethical/integrity.
since 2005 i know amd is burning cpus i dont get why stupid people still buy amd amd is the worst gayshit ever released
I got a Asus board and every few weeks when I boot my PC my internet does not work. The only fix I have found is to power off, remove the main power cord, tap the power button a few times to remove any existing power and plug my pc back in.
Its a shame really. It really is.
Agreed, its sadly also alot of money for one card wtf m8
My Asus G14 Zephyrus with anime matrix is pure Garbage... It overhear its slow and armory crate sucks ... its freeze all the time. Customer services didnt help me. I paid 2k for a laptop pushed by influencer ... Never ever again Asus ... To me Asus use to be like Honda ... Fun but also relaible
I couldn’t agree more. I still have my display laying around that got turned in twice before just leaving the warranty and then the display broke again. Half honest apologies were all I got. Never again a product by asus.
Its weird seeing this guy saying things that kids say.  Like its been real.    Just be you stop trying to cater to the kids.  It comes off as weird and ingenuine like youre 50 yrs old and trying to be cool instead of literal and well spoken.
I have asus X670E crosshair extreme and it burned 2 processors x7950 and X7900 not 3D if you want me to ship them to you just let me know  The X7950 burned before updating the bios  After the bios update it burned the X7900
I thought ASUS was good?
Whoa man! I better change my build now! Thanks guys
I got an ASUS ROG strix with bluetooth, and that bluetooth they put on is CRAP, i bought a 10 euro bluetooth 5.0 dongle to be able to hear music with my airpods pro !
Please, send me rtx 3080 ti and ryzen 7950x and a powerful mobo with rgb with hyper x 8gb x4 rgb.
i have a massive question, do you actually pay for all things asus sends ?
Sounds like you are bitter that they don't want to support your channel.
Recently had my laptop screen die... they want my local service location to take my laptop for a week just to make sure they have the right part. Literally gave them the serial #, model number, etc ... so they can ship the part... how does that make sense
You might've just saved their company...
The rockman X behind just caught all my attention
yep got tired of buying from New Egg and shit not working.  I have bought my stuff off Amazon ever since and after 6 build I have yet to need to return anything. New Egg lost a customer for life.
Question: People months ago were talking about the 7950x being unstable and unreliable. Has it been on ASUS boards all along or is there still an issue with the 7950x's still?
And on top of that, Armoury crate is a nightmare
++++++++++++++++The Asus older model motherboard worked for me for a very long time.I replaced it with a new model and a powerful processor.I was getting blue screens and computer crashes.I cursed Windows because I thought it had a bug.When the warranty of the 12 GB graphics card expired, all the mosfets on it blew up.Of course, Asus didn't want to hear about a warranty repair they claimed that it was my fault because I did not replace the thermal paste hahahaha.The thermal paste was stated to last for several years about half as much as I had a graphics card. Since then, I have not bought anything from Asus.Somewhere from the beginning or halfway, Asus had good products when he established himself on the market, rubbish with a short duration started coming from him.
Clown 👎👎
Yeah like Asus pay attention to this third-rate channel that will do anything the sponsor tells them to do
I feels weird to buy any hardware going forward when the era of cloud gaming is right ahead of us.
It's a pattern, isn't it. The same story, every time. Brand builds itself to be highly respected and recommended due to the quality of their hardware and/or support.  At some point, someone - probably a suit in some office who's never stood closer than 10 feet from a motherboard, nevermind handled one - decides  "you know... we're just not making enough money, still. We need to make more. What? We can't make more without sacrificing the quality that got us here? Well, then it's an easy solution.. Start cutting corners. Reduce the quality. Just make it look cool, and let our name and previous reputation sell the product".  And at some point, inevitably... something like this happens. And then the company pretends to be all "surprise pikachu face", "We don't know how this happened! This is most regrettable!! We promise to do better! In the meantime, please keep buying our product!"  And what does it boil down to? Greed. It's always greed. Because no matter how much $$$ they make, it's never enough. They demand more, even if it means burning the very customer-base who got them where they are. Because all the suits/shareholders know, or pay attention to, or care about is how much of a raise they can give themselves this year.
I've had the same realizations since buying some Asus BS back in 2020 and having headaches with them still until this day. They're gone for me.
2023 the year brands cancel themselves 😂
Man, it blows my mind to think that MSI of all manufacturers ends up being your board of choice over ASUS. I first got burned by MSI 15 years ago, and saw it happen many more times to others, and I have never bought a single product from them since. Their brand was entirely toxic. Now it seems maybe they've turned it around? Meanwhile, ASUS has basically been my go-to for motherboards and budget laptops. No way I'm dealing with them anymore. This is nuts. Thanks for going into so much detail on these problems, and like others have said, big respect to you for dropping them as a sponsor. I know that's never an easy decision.
Ive been using Asus products for more than a decade now. Best company for me.
:o
Asus have always been pants.. Even their laptops have been poor.
I'm confused, is he related to Jay Z and 50 cents?
I have been on Gigabyte in the past and now MSI board and GPU. No problems. I'm glad i do not have ASUS.
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 cheeeeeeeeeeers this is brutallllllll for consumers but mannnnnnnnnnnn heart out to you Jay your taking an amazing step for us all !!!!1 HOWEVER I STILL MIGHT HAVE TO BUY AN ASUS COOLERED GPU CASUE IM GETTIGN DEPSERATE THESE DAYS LOLOLOLO
Hearing this news and how they're treating customers/consumers, I'm moving forward with AsRock and MSI for all parts in addition to laptops. Thanks for the honest news and review as always!!
these boards are way way too expensive for those type of issues. Glad my board and whole system is solid as a rock. Can basically run for weeks on end without ever having any issues at a fraction of the cost of those ones.
They should care. I have had plans to make a new computer using latest equipment by Asus and well they just lost a sell due to this video. Listen up Asus!!!!!
Man that's wild. What a shame that ASUS can't just make quality products and back their shit.
bought an Asus laptop (high end) 10 years ago. after 14 months it broke.. usus would not even fix it when I offered to pay for the fix.. they just sayd no.. that was the last time I bought anything Asus..
I bought TUF gaming laptop because they marketed it as military grade, and has tough materials.. but less than a year the monitor is already broken, it can only run on 60Hz.. and 6 months later Wifi LAN card is broken, sometimes it is will just disappear in device manager as if it got disconnected.. I checked online for any possible solution and it's very concerning that these are very common issues with this laptop, which is supposedly "tough"
Sounds like the HR department went woke and hired some third-world engineers. Recently bought an Asus gaming laptop it has bios issues... Serious ones.
in my own experience with Asus is kinda simliar. Me and a friend where upgrading our PC and got 2 Asus boards. Both of them where defetive. His didnt even start up, mine didnt saw both RAMs i plugged in. His replacement worked fine. I got mine and it had the same issue. I bought a MSI after that and i never had problems. Since that point in time i only buy Motherboards from MSI
AsRock makes some of the best working products. May not be the most powerful or colorful. But they really stepped up the quality.
I stopped using Asus in general after buying a ROG RX 570 which after like 7 months of using it the thermal paste on the GPU was hard like a rock and also when playing games it would almost hit 100c and idle was on 60c which for 3 months i didn't play any games because i was saving up to get instead an EVGA GTX 1660.
I was about to buy a ROG strix 4070ti
I built and am still using an ASUS Z270 gaming  motherboard. I cannot find the support page on their website. Yes, sure. I understand it is an older board now, but why pull down the support page. My system still plays the games and runs the software I want.  I will stay away from ASUS when it is time to build another system.
im sorry but where does it show how his issues are related to the board? i get the frustration but wheres the evidence?
The RMA stuff is exactly the reason that I haven't used ASUS for 5-6 years. I had a SFF prebuild ROG system that I returned twice, due to the graphics card not getting power and ended up getting a refund for. I don't remeber which system it was, but the card was a GTX980. Then I had a 27" monitor that was RMA'd FIVE! times and every time I just got a monitor that somebody else had returned. One of the monitors I received even had another customers RMA papers in the box. They used to be a good company, but that went down the drain many years ago.
ive had ASUS since my Pentium 4 slot 1.    I am honestly shocked!
I have a asus-tuf dash 15 with a i5-11400 and a 3050ti and lately i have experienced 3 random blue screens , usb ports randomly stop working and the laptop being overall slower. Is this linked to this or this is just a coincidence ? (It also automatically took me to the bios update screen where i clicked yes without realizing)
OMG! :O What brand should I use instead of ASUS for a pro audio/gaming pc build?
I have an ASUS ROG laptop that short circuit, so I had to replace all internal components. What other laptop manufacturer is the best bet now?
Hey look I got the gigabyte auris pro boards having same issues blue screen etc. I'm truly leaning on this being more AMD FOUGHT. I'm not saying azus is right cuz they're definitely wrong putting out a beta bios to void there warranty. But at the same time they're testing trying to fix AMD's problems I see a asus just trying to cover their ass. Lol . But doing it the wrong way
Well when I got DOA MSI board with no visible damage - it would not react to power I was just told I have damaged it somehow and my warranty claim is dismissed. Great, thank you xD
Haven't pitched in since I was building my last rig. Was planning to visit in a month or two, when its time for a new cooler. It's good to know that even if you don't keep a close eye on a creator that you refer to, when you have actual questions about "the topic", you can steel feel safe coming back and relying on that information. 1st ever time I unironically thought about Patron as a service, while watching a YouTube video. I am basically proud of my MSI board, but was thinking about switching to ASUS due to availability down here where I am. Well thanks to you I know have one on my mind about doing that! Will make sure I know what I'm buying from them for sure (if I do)!
My top 4 brands in order are Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and ASRock. Well, nothing will last forever. The order soon will changes.
Ive returned my ASUS Laptop 2 Times and it kame back with the same issue. 3rd time was for full refund. Props to my local reseller to deal with their BS.
haha... no one cares. i have graphical Asus monitor and is perfect. only gullible suckers care who change their motherboard every year
It's a shame about ASUS and what they've become. I bought an ASUS PC back in 2010, and it's still running. It's just not my main PC anymore since I finally bought a new one (Skytech) last year.
Asus strategy is based on releasing one overperfoming and overpriced flagship which sales another 10 thrash products of the same series ... it has been like this for nearly 2 decades and working quite well for Asus (confirmed by former Asus engineering manager I knew) ... if you take a closer look and compare each product with the competition, you will get the point Regarding the Asus MBs for AMD CPUs, they just suck ... since the chipsets have been dedcated for ATI or Nvidia, ASUS never made a good one for AMD and still sucks today when chipsets are open for both (mosfets, powerlines ...) but not all products suck, just the MBs for AMD made by ASUS :D
I'm not defending ASUS and this guy is probably or most likely talking facts BUT I can't help but to feel like his criticism is too Arrogant especially from a FREE consumer stand point. I suppose when his channel are big enough he have the luxury to pick and choose sponsors where as when they first started wishing and appreciated all good and bad sponsors.
I remember the last time i bought anything from asus was 14y ago or so, the m/b was dead after a month under guarantee, but the replacement was not any better, after a few years dead too.  Since then i went to gigabyte and hp. Never had a problem with gigabyte m/b's.
Hope China invades Taiwan soon
ASUS has been in the shitter for almost a decade now. I remember having to RMA 5 ASUS laptops in a row over the course of a month before getting a refund because of horrific coil whine that I just couldn't ignore
I switched to an AMD build with a 3900x and an Asus board. I've never had a build with more problems from never being able to connect more than 1 m.2 or SSD, to absolutely no stability with any degree of overclocking for memory or CPU and just small hiccups and issues with specific games. I'll definitely be going away from Asus and AMD once I can afford another build. These problems absolutely killed my desire to keep self building rigs so it can be someone elses issue when I have things fail or not work.
Many years ago, when I got my FX8300, I buy an Asus motherboard (gaming aura). When I move the motherboard to another case, I got a BIOS update with infinite loop (I don't know why) and, nothing. My motherboard died. I buy a Gigabyte motherboard and my FX8300 run fine today. Now, I skip Asus when I buy a new motherboard. No issue with MSI and Gigabyte, but Asus, never again.
love it
Thank you, I hope this video is the next highest viewed video on youtube. Asus deserves it for their software, and they know it.
So helpful to me, thank you. I have an 8 year old Asus Rog build, its been fine, Iv had minor issues that iv just lived with and its time i thought about starting from scratch. After watching this I have no reason to think about using Asus in my next build.
What is with the massive drop in build quality and QC lately?
Yeah, I loved Asus years back ... they did a lot of fantastic stuff. But that really has been going down for years now. They always have had premium pricing ... but back in the day they also had premium products. The procing stayed but the products went down the drain ...
thank fuck i havent started my new build yet the whole thing was mostly gonna be around rog stuff
ofcource he is gonna call it and AMD problem.. classic Jayz...
Appreciate the vid Jay
Hearing this, i´m glad moving from my old Love to Gigabyte, and i realy loved them, i even bought me an Asus Smartphone,just to have One. But now u have become a absolute NoGo!
i heard that is because us/canada mostly got the stock from vietnam? last recall also for vietnam made only? is it true? for cn/tw better maybe?
thanks for stick up for us mate! shout out to my man Steve as well!!  huge respect+
I once, and this sure has been a while by now, had a Rampge III Extreme Black Edition which I had to RMA... When I turned it in they were like "well damn, never seen such a complete box returning"..  When I got "it" back it turned into a Rampage IV Formula. Which was a 2011, not 1366...  A few months later I found the same motherboard for sale for 4 times the price I bought it for, it made me feel ripped off, even tho I can not conclude it was mine or not, this was pretty painful..  edit: Their claim was there was no 1366 board they could give in return and mine was unrepairable (It was a memory issue, which sounds a lame explanation)
ASUS has had questionable quality for decades in my experience. A lot of people thought I was unfounded for avoiding them over the past several years but it looks like I was justified.
Well everyone should move back to gigabyte motherboards
I've been loyal to ASUS MB's and GPU's for years now. Not anymore! Their increasing lack of quality control, ownership and customer support is disappointing and frankly sickening. My new build will consist of an MSI Tomahawk and Gaming X Trio. This is the way!  I hope you're listening ASUS! AMD, if you're listening, dump ASUS now!
what BS everyone stuff up once in a while sure don't buy that product but new product will probably be fine (I'd watch out for sponsored revives if i was a consumer)
i used to build budget pc during pandemic, from WFH & online school it's usually ryzen Apu and b350 prime + and after 1 1/2 yr, 3/5 build comes error "usb over voltage" or No display. After that I said am done with Asus.  note: all those computers are just for normal use MS office & browser.
I hereby declare that ASUS "Republic of Gamers" (ROG) is now "Democratic People's Republic of Gamers" (DPRG)...
Maybe Asus can send Dylan Mulvaney a laptop and see if that helps.
My motherboard b550e came with the bios flash buttom broken, amazon would not give me anotherone, somehow managed to get it running and flash the bios through f2 menu, fast forward to like a week ago had random occasions of bluetooth simply not working ( no way to turn it off or on) then blue screen, after that updated bios and now every now and then blue tooth or audio goes away for no reason. Also resize bar turns itself off for no reason.
I hate Asus, good to know that the bigger players see the issues.
How are the Intel boards working???....lol
Before talk shit about someone , return the free things 😂😂😂😂
Biggest problem is they have the majority of the market so they can get away with this nonsense.
Amazing thank you for educating us. I had no idea. Last time I buy an ASUS motherboard. Thank you!
if jay says never buy asus ill never buy asus i trust jay and been watchin his videos for ever. i trust my boy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is very difficult for me to accept as a heavy Asus fan. I've been purchasing their products for years... I guess I'll try to move to another company then.
ive had nothing but problems with my asrock b550, so dont hype them too hard lol, going to gigabyte.
Please don't ditch AMD on your personal build!!! Don't blame them for ASUS' problems! Just get a different X670E board from another manufacturer.
nig, im still running a gigabyte mobo from 2009.... gig-A-byte~~~
Alright, then who's the new favorite on the block these days?
boycott budlight, tarjay, asus...
Glad I saw this. Doing a new build for my studio... Asus is out!
MSI is shit, Asus is shit.... Not much left anymore...
My ASUS B550 F Strix overvolts my 5800X by far too much, meaning its unstable at stock settings. I expected it to be fixed in the BIOS at some point. Considering I had these products since launch, im surprised its still not fixed. Really not surprised by this recent development.
Thanks Jay. You’ve always stood by us gamers. I will never buy an ASUS product ever again.
Do I smell a EVGA oportunity?
Then why go back to Intel? Just switch motherboards!
Any company that quadruples the price of its products while simultaneously cutting the quality in half deserves to fail.
i always prefer gigabyte more than asus since long ago
the ASSRock revolution is now
I wonder how long till he starts featuring Asus products again.  Money talks specifically for YouTubers
Oh dear, finally. I've got experience with ASUS RMA, it's not funny. Long story short: 1 year and 1 step before a lawsuit until they realized they won't win if it really came down and I got my money back for a $3k Zephyrus, where they'd lost at least $12k in sales, because they "repaired" it 5 times, always replacing MB. They even managed to scratch the entire frame, seemingly forgot tu put on thermal paste (overheating after 3rd repair), the list goes on... I wrote a google review, but Asus authorized company deleted it and only kept the photos, pretending that they repaired the frame, whereas in reality they completely messed it up during "repair". 30k+ views, people thinking they offer good service.
YOU CANT BLAME YOUR BUGS ON ASUS!!! What a joke, your crying about free stuff. I hate this channel and yourself now. I don't want to see you ever again.
I bought an ASUS ROG G752!After 3 months the laptop started to release lots of smoke(black smoke)!Since it was in the warranty time,I contact them!Well,Asus customer support just gave me their midle finger!So I decided to open the laptop and check it myself what went wrong!One of the fans just got on fire and meltted!This back in the days shouldnt happen with a supposed "gaming" laptop! Just a reminder the price this laptop had back in the days,and how they treat their customers that waster thousands with one of their most expensive products! FU ASUS
This is what I call: WWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
Stopped using Asus motherboards a while ago, customer service and quality has been dropping for some time
asus is one of the best, if asus is going bad, the rest is going worst
I have been using Asus brand for many years. 12 years only ROG laptops, plus a monitor, router, ext. DVD, mouse. And never had a single issue with their hardware. So I have to strongly disagree with your generalizations. Seem to be the only one here... shocking.
I bought assus ROG MAXIMUS Z790 HERO motherboard and I cannot get it to work with all the 4 ram slots. It can recognize only 2 sticks of rams. Asus claims  you can have 128 Gb of ram with this motherboard however many people are reporting issues and asus didn't fix the problem yet.
Started using MSI back in 2012, never stopped since then.
Just like me to only find this out after swapping to an ASUS B550.
Rip this channel
Who are you Who is asus
Damn . . . . I just built on the Z690.
Built an asus z790 for someone 13th gen intel and it was flawless and works fine. Stop buying 3rd party vendors and no more free asus gpu cards🤣  Meanwhile Intel nearly voided 9900k cpu warranty when it lost its 8th core as faulty claiming because I ran xmp to fully capitalize my 3000mhz ram speed. Theyre all shady
EVGA gone, now ASUS. Man the tech industry is dying or greedy and losing its passion.
Ive had no problems with asus monitors or motherboards. Skill issue tbh
No asus, no asus...feel anger from this guys and legit.....and I feel to with my Mobo Rog B460 G
Respect to the channel 👏
AsUS is As$. I bought a 1680 in 2017 and it crapped out within 6 months  Thanks asus  Eat my ar$e
AMD and ASUS are the best at what they do, what is the % of these defects? Please, you don't have the slightest idea of ​​how quality control is done to criticize it.
Perfect timing for your video as I’ve been looking into getting either a Steam Deck or the new ASUS ROG Ally…
Never had issues with my PC, but after I watched this video, I got an DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error with STXII.sys as source of the issue. STXII.sys is the driver for ASUS Xonar Essence STXII sound card and I got also an ASUS TUF Gaming X570 Plus motherboard…
I'm done with ASUS gaming laptop 🔥💻🔥 me and my wife and have owned 4 of them. All of my rigs were over 2k each, but they only lasted for 2 years before issues.  The power bricks always go first on all 4. The power out port has come lose and failed. Had one where the video card failed in 4 months, and they replaced it with some cheap junk.  So yeah, I have about 10k over 10 years into ASUS. NEVER AGAIN! I just brought the Alienwear X17 R2 for 3k, hoping I'll have better luck gaming it's my first Alienware, so we will see.
I had an Asus laptop I got around august 2022 and a few months back after a bios update from. It's site it decided that the screen wasn't compatible with the laptop and I wasn't able to connect it to an external screen I wasn't able to get the screen working and have no idea how to get it working. It's 2000.00 down the drain
It's seems a lot of companies are crapping on their customer base lately? Well, there loss.  Our misery if you dare to buy it !
I disagree with this
Thank you for the update.   Azroc over ASUS... wow... times change.  Thanks for the info.  Sounds like a change in ASUS's higher ups - unfortunate.
Maybe it's just you and not them.
''  that we can no longer support the brand or allow them to be one of our trusted sponsors''  No ..They sponsor you, you do not support or sponsor them ... Asus is Huge company ... I 'll take any Asus any day over a dell . You wouldn't criticize dell because you are an american .
Hope your recovery is going well Jay.
I’ll give it to Jay here, he is super smart and knows his stuff. It’s just I have found he’s really not a channel for people that don’t know the lingo of computers. He’ll say things super fast and assume people know acronyms, not saying he’s bad or doing it wrong because his number don’t lie. HOWEVER… He is 10000% spot on with this video, I have had so many issues with Asus and then when calling customer service, lets just say I’ve had better luck at the DMV. I have had them do everything from giving me the run around and stone walling me, to telling me everything is bad just return it and try again with a new component. Asus has dropped the ball and that ball is rolling down hill towards a cliff. If they don’t course correct soon they will find them selfs in a Bud Light situation real quick.
as someone who’s always ordered asus mobos, this makes me sad. i’m definitely going to do my research before getting another asus.
The absolute worst customer service ive ever had was asus. It was a nightmare.
Hats off to you man.We need more reviewers like you!!
Just to be clear this is only happening to the 670e chipsets and not  older chipset.
Jay,i bought a Rog Monitor and it have a very long scratches😢So FUCK Asus
hmmmm this might explain a lot, my maximus xii hero has had some random blue screens too/usb device/audio issues.  Wonder if it is at all connected....
Yeah,Fuck Asus
That is too bad, I used to recommend ASUS to everyone.
you seem ungrateful
Organizations that deny their failures, will eventually lose. When they start tossing out bullshit, they fail to understand that much of that will just blow back upon them. .. as it has done.  Greed cannot be the only reason for anyone to DO anything.
I’m still gonna buy their shit!!! Lol
This sucks, I really do like strix products but this is beyond unacceptable
please recommend me a setup to play cities skylines and city build games  this is all confusing
I say let the mega corps become so tone def and ignorant to the real world that they kill themselves in an ignorant bliss. WE AS CONSUMERS VOTE WITH OUR WALLETS. and we VOTE NO
one of many zombie stocks going to zero now that there is no more free money printed.
I been using Asrock since 2014 on all my builds. good cheap boards. My latest build I been using since October 2022 is an ASRock Z790 Steel legend (Openbox) for $180 this one has all the features I need, with a I7-13700k (New) retail price and a RTX 3090 ROG STRIX (Openbox) for $800 from microcenter and had no issue with anything. FYI, go to your local microcenter and if you see something you like on the open box section ask them to show you the history of that item and ask for the price to be lower, most of the time they will give you a better deal. Them just add their warranty on it for 2 years and you good to go just in case something happens to any of the parts.
they stopped sponsoring and this guy got butthurt xddddd
asus doesnt give a $hit about him  and his "problems"
Had to send in my laptop three times for a defective RAM slot. First i was positively suprised as they fixed the slot and ALSO replaced the battery for free. But: the battery caused an issue where it would get stuck at 0% and not charge any further, shutting off as soon as the charger was unplugged even after multiple hours of charging. I described the issue in detail and sent the thing in THREE times never getting the issue fixed.
I fired you years ago. Why are you in my feed delet.
This has been going on for at least the past 6 years, mate. Thanks for letting everyone know about this junk.
Asus has come out and said that the voided warranty warning was a mistake and they have changed it. There excuses is that it's a standard warning on all Beta BIOS update. They said they were more focused on getting a capped voltage bios out to customers.   Now that they have came out and said that the voided warranty was a mistake will you walk back the firing of Asus as a sponsor?
had problems with a evga mother board, it was my second computer build  , it crash a lot and lock ups , sent it for rma to evga  i box it an old box and with staic prof bag,  evga sent it back said it was not the right serial number mob, sent in a box with pununts and not bag , I ONLEY had  the one , I HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANOTHER EAVG PRODUCT !
to be fair, why trust anyone with the word SUS in their name anyways😂
I have an 8 year old predator asus tower i got from costco. Still runs like a beast. Diablo4 never crashed. But im sure if i tried streaming it wouldn
truth be told i always purchased asus stuff, I haven't built a new computer since 2016 i know crazy. But it does every thing i need it to and more. I have yet to see any reason to upgrade. That being said, just off of the experience i seen with others as well as you. This hole thing seems like a ploy to get people to intentional blow up there boards so they buy another one.
Thanks Jay!  HONEST as always !
I commented the most egregious of errors. I bought a mobo from Newegg right before the broken mobo debacle happened. I didn’t have all the money for parts so the mobo sat for a bit as I got the rest. Well system built on that ASUS B550 TUF mobo and everything seems okay except it says I am WAY over current on my cpu voltage. I did everything possible to remedy the issue but, at this point since my cpu hasn’t flat out died, I can only assume it is just faulty. When I called “customer service” all they could do was an RMA process leaving me without the pc that I need for not only my enjoyment but, mainly for work… so now I am just holding onto that mobo that at best just has a faulty sensor or read in the cpu voltage, and at worst is actually messed up and slowly killing my parts..
Asus is trash. Have a z490 moon with issues and their tech/warranty claim is a s-show, they basically wear you out to prove your issue to the point where you just give up. Never buying asus again.
Wow are Asus products low quality now?
Bro do you know how privileged you are to even get sent free stuff from companies like this? If you dont want their stuff send it me as I'm looking for a monitor/tv for my xbox series x so I can unlock it's full power as my tv from 2011 just ain't doing the job😅
The Real *Sleeper* in the Market is ASRock. Reliable, Affordable, no huge Failures and works for Years. I once used a ASRock for at least 5 Years and there was never a thing. Now i am STILL running a MSI Z170-A Pro / Intel i7 6700k Combo for at least 6 Years and works.
I have always used either ASRock or AS(s)US...  I will stop with one of them in the future. Same goes with new nvidia hardware..unless they fix the stupid scalping.
I am so glad I watched this😳😳😳 I was moments away from buying the 670E board and then I saw this. MSI here I come. What the entire fux Asus… then to read what Scott said, something has to be done. I had been ROG since X99 and had upgraded ROG ever since but to tell someone a bios upgrade voids your warranty and destroys components… I’m so done ✔️ I guess it’s MSI here I come
Horrible horrible software department and quality ASUS ROG has.
Can i honestly get 1?
I bought an expensive ASUS motherboard and it wouldnt post because i had a wireless keyboard and mouse connected.  Just gave me error code 99 which made me take apart the whole pc and build it again, checking every connection, just to get the same errror.  i will never purchase anything from ASUS ever again.
MSI is the way to go boys, been saying this for awhile.
thanks for the tip o7
I also had alot of problem with Asus, Bought a laptop from them, it broke down and they kept sending me a broken laptop back this went on for like a year (I think i send my laptop 4 to 5 times in total) and then they told me it is out of warranty and i had to start paying for the repairs even tho they never fixed the issue in a year time. what the actual.. This is 6years ago and none of my friends have asus in there pc now. Whenever somoene ask i strongly recommend not taking asus products ever.
my mobo is asus even my new gpu is asus because usually it last long for me, i used MSI before but it just burned everytime :( which brand would you recommend please ? :/
that is why I am following you. You and Steve. An honest persons want for us the best. Making us having the best hardware for the best experience. If you guys are not out there we could been sucking the Failure of the bad product. Stay strong, you and Steve are my powerful mentors.
I have a shitty asus laptop that’s been giving me problems less than 2 years old……hate the fucking thing. I’ll never buy another laptop or any major device!
The eye man
can companies please make more white editions. lol
Can you give a top 5 or 6 motherboard brands that you'd suggest at this point going forward?
The average consumer that knows to have standards for their product has lost their faith in Asus the day their AMD Laptops had worse thermal performance than the Intel ones because they couldn't be bothered to cut holes at the bottom.
Yeeehah!!!! 🏆 Jay, we need more people like you in the world, who dont hold back the lies and bullshit, scared of losing a sponsor!! Thats why your channel is my go-to channel on Youtube whenever i have pc related issues!!! Keep up the good work team!!!! YOU'RE AWESOME!!! 🤠
well it's a good thing I have no interest in Asus products.
My first asus laptop lasted 5 years under extreme abuse and poor system cleaning. My recent one lasted less than a year. Always went to them for computers, never again
Good move! was ASUS "Fanboy" for decades, then the quality and support went worse, current build has no A-SUS in it, only non SUS parts.
No more Asus for me. In case you think that's not a big deal - I build lots of PC's for people.
So sad to see Asus from a solid and reliable motherboard maker to decline to this.
Tell this to micro center in Denver. I returned so many asus motherboards for these reasons and got banned for my returns. Are you seeing this micro center? Here is the proof.
Never again ASUS. Bought a ROG phone 5 two years ago and the motherboard is going out like all of them. Tried to get it repaired at the main north american branch and they literally told me that I had to ship it to china because they don't do that here... What a POS product and company.
This is not good for asus
Asus has poor quality control; I was always disappointed with their products, still wonder why Linus praises them so much.
Well, probably done with asus too
I can atest to this, Asus is garbage.. but I keep buying their laptops cause razer is too expensive..
Doesn't ASRock share the same management with ASUS? Will ASUS management spill over ASRock?
ASUS has been like this for a very long time.  3 instances:  1. ASUS Mainboard 18 years go: 14 years old me being a computer nerd on a tight budged had a warranty case with the board. They acknowledged it, but could neither repair it nor send me a new one. After almost 4 months, they offered me a replacement board that was different. I said yes and got the cheapest of all cheap ASRock boards. Which was not even half as expensive as the ASUS board I had before. That ofc sucked, but gaming little computer nerd that I was - almost 4 months without a PC was traumatic.  2. ASUS Graphics Card: 10 years ago - barely after warranty one of the two fans stopped spinning. A new cooler was not offered by them and just a bit later the second fan stopped. How hard is it to make proper fans?? This short after warranty period, this left a bad taste.  3. ASUS Sound Card: 8 years ago - 2 years warranty - after 3 years the jack socket stopped working.   3 ASUS products so far of which one was a hard fail and two were moderate fails is just a bit too much for me. I buy things for more than 2 years to use. I build a new PC every 5-7 years, get high end stuff in it and use it till then. After all this, I'd have more expectations of a product from wish than from ASUS.  Maybe objectively the build quality is better, but my own experience is that ASUS products are designed to break once the warranty is over and support is horrible. Experiences of friends kinda match the same. ASUS stuff breaks down quicker than other brands.  Why even go for 2 more ASUS products after the first incident? Told myself "confirmation bias, unlucky case... can happen".  I am done with ASUS. And since I have built close to 20 PCs for people around me in the last 6 years, ASUS lost more than just me as a customer.
So you have a cpu that has 2 options for bios or operation and it's asus fault not ryzen? Lololol
im smiling looking over at my all msi build cause ive always hated them
jay ill tell you this. i got out of the car biz because of this. i was a mechanic but got sick of doing a job multiple times because a brand new part was bad. right out of the box or minutes into the test drive. then wrong parts started happening. you literally had to inspect everything 1000% as it showed up or youd get blamed for it even though nobody could get a working part. and ive watched that transition into other markets too. think about the global chip shortage in every market and people said theyd make due with a lessor product just to have something. and companies released junk. get used to it.  asus has been this way since 2017ish and they did the first ryzen release. the processors were great. amd admitted memory support was iffy but it was first gen and yeah it was. but amd also gave us the same binning of processors nomatter the series all chips were created equal. buy a 1700 and get the same as the guy that bought the 1800x. they more than made up for that.  asus on the other hand got slammed for having terrible memory support. this many years later memory that is claimed to be supported i have never got supported speeds and stable for more than a few days. other days i might get a few minutes. guess what their still at it and even worse because people kept buying that crap and they kept selling it. they got me again when the video card shortage happened and i bought a 6800xt the asus was in stock and lowest price and i know why. the fucking thermal pads dont even touch. i can literally see it with my eyes and a camera while the card is assembled. does my card like to crash at stock predetermined speeds certainly. does that surprise me on a card i spend 1300+ dollars on from asus. it should. but its why i havent given them another penny. msi used to be my fail safe. i had a system from 2006 with msi mobo that is still running. and i only strayed away because the asus prime x370 pro was supposed to be one of the very best and the taichi was alot more for the same performance. i should have spent the extra dollars on stuff i didnt need.
Armoury crate is horrendous.
Thanks for the input, staying away from Asus now!
SUS NOT SOOS WTF IS HE ON, METH?
Daym i am very scared for my motherboard cause i though asus had a solid brand that you would save up for. Didnt know how anti consumer friendly their practice is. As much as how nice their products look i want something that i can rely on without thinking twice.
hey man send me an asus x670e ill take my chanses put your money where your mouth is!!!!
Only a small 4 million abonnees see this...
dang i used to be a bit of an asus fanboy.. (more than 5 years ago) sucks to see they fell off so hard.
This is so disappointing from Asus. I also purchased the ROG hero board for my 7800x3d and have had so many random issues with stability, crashing, stuttering, and sound issues. All of my previous builds ran perfectly using Asus boards, but I don’t think I can use their boards moving forward if these issues are more wide spread. The final nail in the coffin being a complete lack of accountability from Asus. Thanks for bringing this to light.
ASUS worst support! RMA my 3090 and they send me 2070s wtf!
Used to love Asus and used their parts where ever I could. Bought an Asus Strix 7.1 "gaming" headset and the thing self bricked itself after some auto driver/firmware update to the USB station. Last Asus product I ever bought. Their after sales/support suck donkey nuts. I chucked the product and the brand and never looked back. MSI replaced Asus in all my last 3 or 4 PC's.
Oke, as a simple consumer then.. NO longer buy ASUS product..got it.. I currently have Asus products.. Will not buy in the future for next PC / upgrade..  thank you.. Will spread the word also
that's the thing, ASUS has never been good at support... but they've been pretty good quality in general so it hasn't been an issue for me, i've been using them for a good 15 years now but they've slowly been getting worse the past couple of years  i finally had one motherboard die which i could prove without a doubt was dead and they spent 4 months fighting everything, taking like 1 month to reply at times  and they couldn't provide any proof of them actually checking or their reasoning on why they thought the board wasn't dead  their tech support is just flat out rude sometimes, the next build i do i think i will be switching it up and not using them finally  i know i'm not the only one, if you're Australian you have almost no chance of getting support from them... they have one place in Sydney and its full of people who have watched 1 or 2 youtube videos and call themself a hardware pro
As someone who's been team ASUS for just over 20 years, and who's made purchasing decisions for work that's involved hundreds of ASUS products (usually motherboards, graphics cards, and laptops), I kicked ASUS to the curb a few years ago when they made a laptop so bad, and refused to acknowledge it until there was a class action lawsuit.  The replacement laptop I got was still mostly garbage for what it was supposed to be.
ASUS quality used to be top notch, used them also for over 20 years..  20 freaking years!  I had motherboards fails, laptop fails and all out of warranty.
Thank you for this message. In the near future I am doing a new build, I will jump on board the ASUS boycott and go with MSI / anything not ASUS. As always, thank you JTC
What boards are you guys using for your current builds? Who would you recommend besides ASUS?
I don't like intel there is way too many software and game incompatibilities with drivers always had driver issues in general
Your integrity and ethical values are shining throughout this whole video! By calling out the hypocrisy and defending the truth, really shows your will for righteousness towards all the customers whom was/is and possibly will be victims of this brand.
I totally had issues with my audio, It all had to do with the sonic studio stuff Asus  sends.  I disabled EVERYTHING around that and it all works fine now.    Initially I didn't have it installed and it was running like a dream, but I was being thorough and installed it and that is when my nightmares started.  I disabled it all and have my system running stable, but I really don' t like having drivers installed and virtual sound devices detected but set to not use...  it seems like such a hack.
Ive had the RMA issue  where they send me the RMA from someone else as my new product from many companies.    Its so annoying and why does it happen?
Dam, and I just bought an ASUS GPU...
My last pc worked perfectly fine for 4 years. My new one has had nothing but problems ever since I bought it. Brand new ASUs board and Ryzen 7900x, restarting, crashing, blue screens and every other problem it could possibly have.
Agree 1000%
Oh, your perfect AMDs are blowing up. All the tech channels bent the kneen to them. AMD sucks and runs hot.
Its a tale as old as time. Brand comes out, makes incredible gorgeous product, makes waves in the community.  Brand gets huge, makes large percentage profit growth.  Brand levels out, to just a steady small proffit growth.  Investors get whiney and need to make large percentage profit growth, not just small profit growth (even though growth is growth).  Brand cuts corners to continue to deliver large percentage profit growth.  Brand is dogshit. So many exact scenarios likes this accriss the "united states" products.
ASUS wants us to go away? Ok. Their products have been to expensive for a while now, they are too brittle and don't give back enough.
i have 4 asus mainbords + amd cpus and im also not happy so mutch problems  in the last 2 yeahrs my 2 intel gigabyt systems 10 yeahrs old no problems ^^ next pc will be intel and gigabyt agan.
Purchased an ASUS ROG Strix G15 desktop. It arrived with a RTX 3060 GPU that was bad. They would not fix the GPU without sending the entire computer back for warranty. I could not be without the computer for the month or two it would take to repair. Not happy with ASUS and their warranty process.
I went with MSI because even though they are more pricey I've had better luck with them. The first Ryzen processor I had on a ASUS board the moment I tried to OC it died about 1 second after clicking the button to accept the new numbers. That was with the first gen Ryzen CPU. The CPU was fine, the board died. That was with the Ryzen 7 1700, not the 1700X.
My question:  Asus screwed up badly and eveyones dumping them over this one issue.  Nvidia has completely FUCKED the GPU market, price gouged, lied, introduced mire subtiers at more money each generation and you still all flock them.  I havent bought anything from nvidia since the 1080 out of principle.  Why have they been allowed to do thisnfor so long? Time to ditch them as well.
Thank you so much for doing the right thing. I recently bought the ROG Maximus Z790 Hero and have had the blue screen issues and my computer sounds like it is about to blow up. Do you have any good motherboard recommendations to replace the ROG Maximus Z790 Hero?
Any Brand recommendations for good quality and affordable 14-15" gaming laptop?
I appreciate the heads up, but, crap, I went with ASUS for the board and graphics card based on a build I watched you guys recommend. I'm having so many problems with the limitations of the card that at least I had planned to replace that when one comes on sale that is compatible with the 550F board. Any recommendations on brand for that? I do appreciate you using your influence to try to rein in these corporate douchebags.
You saved me a lot of money thank you sir 🙏
They need to fire their customer support that does Ticket Stonewalling all day long and never accomplished anything.
ASUS sucks hard ..I bought a ASUS laptop 3 years ago and it was with factory defect - 1000$ in the toilet ...don't waste your money guyz! ;}
I blacklisted them over 10 years ago and branded them ASUCKS! I had a laptop that died after about 10 hours use and they totally stonewalled me... no success, terrible customer support, zero interest in rectifiying the problem, I was very upset, took a look myself and the caps on the MB had swelled up..
I dont has anything asus but i have a amd build and the past 2 weeks ive been having issues with everything after a recent driver update
Any issues with asus laptops that you know of? I'm on disability and spent every penny I could spare (which wasn't a ton). On an asus ROG strix g15 advantage edition.. I hope I made the right choice..
Thanks jay I have made my decision I will not be putting any asus products in my new computer build @ASUS
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't any software that is still in development that has proven catastrophic failure/destruction/crashing not qualified to even be marketed as BETA but rather ALPHA, which is not suppose to be ( if I'm not mistaken legally ) even distributed to the consumer?
integrity .. integrity ... integrity .... 👍👍
Thank you, Asus boycotted.
Not bought an Asus product since 2017 just out of a lack of need, currently using a lappy as daily driver cause of the previous shortages and ironically ended getting a good for it price anyway so win but yeah no I ain't touching anything Asus for a while if this is how they do people now. Thanks Jay much appreciated, you have always done a good job of addressing this stuff in the proper manner so yeah thanks.
ASUS has been responsible for a lot of vendor fraud at our work
Im currently doing an intership as a IT support for a tech shop near where I live and one of their customer wanted the shop to build him a gamer cpu. The motherboard they choose was an Asus z790 and for some reasons, when we plugged in a keyboard, it would stop booting for no reasons. We contacted the support, bought another z790 and the same problem occured again. The support response was that we didn't do the job properly and that the motherboard wasnt the reasons why it wouldnt boot. As someone who is studying to become an IT support, those interaction made me despise Asus and Im never gonna buy from them.  And for information, the one who built it has 20+ years in that industry so I don't think it is his fault at all.
im using my asus that about 5 - 6 years old... it was powerful back then and still runs most everything I need including several (no small) video games... what will I be buying next?
Can confirm my ASRock Z390 board with a 9900k has been stable for years.
Asus MB I had 6 years ago had a bios bug that fried some of my cpu cores.. now i use Gigabyte
I feel like one of those cringelords that complain about companies going "woke" ... but as someone who has always tried to incorporate asus into my builds... this is sad to see.  No more
That's Corporatism for you.
yep my 3k asus build fuckin blows mainly the MB had to try 3 differents MBs to get the computer to act right soo dont buy!!! This is the BIG PSA we needed..
I'm seriously starting to think this stuff is related to something a lot bigger and more malicious than greedy manufacturers and declining customer service. There are a lot of products that are no longer being made, products being made to die in short timeframes but past warranty, and cutting of support across the board. Some of this from companies who have built their reputation on supporting their customers. Considering the JIT business models and increase in floating credit lines etc. needed to manage to stay in a relevant market position, I don't think these companies are doing this of their own volition. I see a lot of odd changes going on in unexpected places in multiple industries and a lot of it seems to be coming from the financial side of things in ways that are beyond cost cutting or marketing screw ups like we've all grown accustomed to. I'm trying not to get into conspiracy theories but now that it's affecting people I know in my own industry its hard not to see it.
A sus
ah shit my mobo and gpu are Asus products...
Fack ASUS!
I remember back in the  late 90s and early 2000s, everyone clamoring to only get ASUS MOBOs, even my dad while raising me would tell me to usually go for ASUS motherboards during that time, but now for the past good couple of years it seems to be nothing but problems with their stuff from every aspect of their company.
i have faced his issue wih ASUS back in 2018,TThey refuse to replace B85Pro Gammer In warranty Motherboard for 3 continuous years they just gave me tha same board each and every time i went for replacement. Worst consumer service experience ever
Wow! I'm an ASUS fan but after hearring this, OH BOY!! Loved using them for my gaming rigs but have had recent issues and after hearring this, i understand why...
Too bad. I've always recommended their STRIX graphics cards to friends and have been using them since 2016
I got the ASUS ROG motherboard and honestly hate it, their armory crate thing caused my pc to BSOD constantly whenever I was playing games more intensive than minecraft, took me forever to figure it out and I still have no clue why.
I dumped about $7k into a build a couple years ago and focused primarily Asus parts. I had always liked the brand and had/heard about good experienced.  Long story short, the monitors I bought did not have cables capable of supporting their resolution. They shipped with 4 cables and I had to purchase my own to get the dang things to work without cutting to a black screen every few minutes in a game.  The motherboard died exactly 4 days out of warranty. I gave them another chance with my replacement choices and got a cpu cooler with mislabeled fans and found the motherboard did not support my the ram that was listed. Not as big of issues, but just came across as low quality/scammy. Not to mention the fans (case and cpu cooler) work like ass without armoury crate, but that piece of junk breaks every few weeks.
Lol that’s funny cause I did a RMA on my z690 and their was long hair all over my board when I got it back and it does suck that they aren’t trying to do quality control
i like pc youtubers you guys don't care if the company is huge or well known you'll trash them just the same
Perhaps I'm an outlier but I'm very happy with my Maximus Z790 Hero Motherboard.
ASUS is a crap company.  i was told by them i had won one of thier contest got many emails from the company only to not recive my winnings.  its been 2 years now im never getting it.
How about we show Asus our opinion as consumers by shipping all of the not in use products back to Asus that we have? That might ring the bell in HQ. I've got few old GPU's and a mobo to ship.
Last 2 ROG laptops suffered from coil whine. Latest one was like a couple of snakes hissing away. My Lenovo Legion is as quiet as a mouse. I can't buy Asus again.
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  RIP ASUS
What does it mean when people say it’s been real? Real what  exactly?
Why does everything good die...🤦‍♂️
the computer industry has been going nuts since 2019 & after evga left the game I'm now very very concerned for any brand name & I'm so glad my rig will last for another 5 years of gaming & i do feel so sorry for folks with these problems. But when i did buy my rig 6months back my ryzen 9 and asus board went wrong hence it went back to scan all of it and i went back to intel and msi why it worked for 6 years so hence it "should" work again
Very sad day, I stand with you. Been a Asus die heart for decades , 6/7 full builds, and now I’m done.
I feel like gigabyte is the same way
This makes me very sad... Their gaming laptops are amazing, especially the Strix series, but now I honestly no longer feel comfortable supporting them. So once i need to buy a new laptop, ill probably look into alternatives...
Kudos for standing up and not peddling shit hardware to your fans. Will think twice about asus proudcts now thanks 🙏
you can't spell Suspicious without aSUS....no pun intended.
When I RMA'd my ROG monitor back in 2016 it took a month for a new one to show up. And it was...broken.  Then...i sent that back... Waited 2 weeks...and I got given a dirty, used monitor which I cleaned and didnt complain about. It worked in the end, still have it but it uses the old HDMI standard... So planning on swapping it.  With that whole experience I've leaned away from ASUS brands when it came to products which I know I can't fix.  This was my experience from 7 years ago.. and all this drama is just not surprising??  I'm also choked into an ASUS brand as they only offer newer gen ITX board currently. So I'm waiting to upgrade my PC until cheaper, different brands one arrive..!
Respect to you an team to stand up against these criminals
Facts I upgrade every other year or so donate to kids and friend old builds but the last 3 asus boards I have done isn’t this past year have all burned up an no response will never purchase again
Freedom of information act requests only apply to the government
I have a X670E Hero board too, about two weeks after building my PC i lost a stick of Ram. It was fine initially then i started getting blue screens and eventually it just refused to boot. I don't know if it was an issue with the Ram that died two weeks later or the board itself. I went down to one stick of ram and it was fine, i have ordered replacement RAM but have not installed it yet. As it stands the PC isn't giving me issues i don't want to tempt fate.
No talk about the Asus router/repeater outage eh? Maybe it happened after this vid was published.
hey jayz! do you have some 2nd hand asus parts that you are going to dispose? Please spare me some. 🤣🤣
Are you sure you aren't putting a power supply on it that the mobo is not rated for? AMD doesn't over-volt their CPUs; although you can change those settings in Adrenaline under Tuning. It could be Wattman doing it, which there was/is a known bug in the software. I've been in this since 1989, never head of this, nor is it a thing. I work in the federal government in literally the biggest enterprise environment in the nation. I worked with a kid that was so stupid he tried to mount the mother board straight to the chassis without any stand-offs screwed in first. Told him over and over and he fried that motherboard... He tried to say it was ASUS! LMFAO! If you put stuff in your system that they explicitly don't recommend then when it burns out it is your fault.  Everyone getting 1500+ watt power supplies on motherboards that recommend no higher than 800 watts. I literally get no guff from any of my AMD products nor the ones I run at work. The Intel based computers constantly are an issue, especially with overheating. We get more problems with the cheap cooling they put in laptops now. I'm not buying a little amount like dude in the video... We're literally buying in the billions of dollars worth at a time. Intel lost me mostly when they started locking their multipliers and CPU registers. There are features in your Intel and AMD CPUs that the manufacturers disable and enable between models. For example, back in the day a 486 and 586 CPU could run Pentium instruction sets, but the feature was disabled. There was a utility you could use that would change the CPU registers to enable the disabled features, so you could run a program dependent on a Pentium with a 486DX CPU with no issues.
asus always a shit company , i buy rog laptop back in 2016 . it keep getting bluescreen . i have no idea what caused it so i go to asus service center they said it was the hardisk . i take me 2 hour drive to get there . and tada after it comeback still got blue screen . so i search in google what wrong , it was the ram . i dont get how people at asus have no idea what happend to their product while all i need to do is do more research on google. and im scared to open the back myself because it will void the warranty ... what a shit company
I wrote them off years ago when they sent me a bad board and refused to RMA it. It had a crushed corner like it was dropped. I switched to MSI and never looked back.
The B550I AORUS PRO AX was so expensive for how average it has been, the Bluetooth will just stop working and not turn back on until the power cable is unplugged for minutes. I'm so untrusting towards motherboards rn, I don't expect these kinds of issue and also other issues haven't mentioned (even after replacing PSU, reapplying CPU, and M.2). Now you're telling even ASUS is a shell of itself and just lego piecing of other technologies together hoping it works
ASUS went down the same path Sony did.
So glad I see this before buying a TUF laptop
AAAHAHA! I dont buy Asus since 2010 because their qualitiy is crap! ASUS: GO HOME!👍 Using ASRock since 2010 and "all" are still running! THATS Quality!
I bought an ASUS motherboard two weeks ago, motherboard was delivered inoperable. 🥲 I had to buy another motherboard
I graduated with an electrical engineering degree. Engineers rely on devices and documentation to report accurate information. When engineering specs and settings are "tweaked" for marketing purposes, it's a safety hazard.
thats wierd i bought a ryzen asus board 4 years ago, and i have always had wierd problems with my system, this explains alot
As fucked up as the US laws are I can imagine ASUS being in the safe just because they wrote somewhere noone even knows about that the beta BIOS voids warranty. Here in Europe there is 100% a lawsuit brewing.
ASUS also relies on slave labor in China to assemble their products. That means ASUS made the decision that they needed that much more money that badly that they needed to also utilize slave labor.
And I wanted to buy a Zephyrus Duo 16"... 😢
one might say its a sus company
Fuck, I just build a gaming pc with asus rtx4090 and asus tuff motherboard. I should have go for MSI or Gigabyte.
Oh sheeeee time to not buy Asus anymore.
Mad respect for sticking to your integrity Jayz and team. Big 💪
so are the 570 boards safe?
I was thinking about buying ASUS mobo and a laptop, but I reconsider it now. It's a bit hard to find non-chineese (taiwan is not chineese) manufactured things. By non chineese I mean that their goverment is not altering their company.
👏👏👏👏👍👍
NGL AsRock is quietly great
Finally a youtuber spoke up about Asus bullshite. 🙏
ASUS SUCKS. My brand new zenbook 14x duo blew up MB after a months use . i wish i could report it to New york Times. i am from USA . I bought this laptop in india from ASUS estore. Blew up . they replaced MB under warranty. now machine cpu thermal throttles. asked CEO desk of ASUS india for replacement with brand new machine as this repair qualifies as a refurbished sale to me. no response for CEO ASUS. wihs Jonny Shih know how his co counterparts function and what crap co policy they have not ro repalce a defective expensive product by repair to create new problems. ROG ASUS . no wonder they made the ASUS ROG series. :)
I had problems with my b450 out the box with ram speed
Well your right man my Asus after 3 monthes of use i had 2 issues one with ram profile the other with sound driver
I quit buy anything Asus over 15 years ago.  I bought a laptop with a 1-year accidental damage warranty.  It fell and cracked the screen about 4-5 months in.  I tried to file a claim on the accidental damage warranty, and they refused it.  I went as far as including the BBB in on the conversation.  Then Asus said they would honor the warranty, the BBB closed the complaint, and then Asus reps stopped responding to any of my emails.  $800 lesson learned.  The company that once was my go-to for motherboards and graphic cards would go on to never receive another red cent from me.  And whenever the opportunity arises to share this story, I do.  For anyone out there who values trustworthy and honorable company, please, do not even consider buying anything from them.
As u said Soon as I went live this happened!! My fone goes 2 YT ads 😂
Used them once and rma was rubbish. They basically said sorry warranty no longer valid as I don’t have the original receipt. After this never recommend them to anyone.
Whell this going to hurt Asus Ass 😂
Since i was a kid Asus was brand that i always perceived as one of the best quality brands. Same as you in recent years i noticed this decline in quality and specially software design/support. Software is so full of crap that you do not need and complicated that it defied its purpose. As an example I bought ROG delta headphones some time ago and only way i could get some meaningful and under performing bass on them is by fiddling with their software in some hard to understand menu. It is a headphone for god sake is it so hard to just give me your best sound quality out of the box without installing yours proprietary software.  Not mentioning their never resolved issue with mic being half the sensitivity after power cycle of the PC. Those overpriced headphones are in trash now and i will never buy another ASUS product again. It is totally correct when you say that they are so high into marketing and making the design and looks of product to be top notch but totally neglecting core purpose of the product you are using. It is like making a car seat that looks awesome with all the stitches and coloring but is totality uncomfortable to use. ASUS get to the ground level!
Tldw   Short and to the point, stop rambling
There is so many other competitive board gigabyte have some good boards msi evga I wast a fan of them of first place.
Si nu strunz!
I have built 5 Asrock AMD budget systems over the past 4 years and they have all been rock solid stable without any problems.  Only issue I had was a failed chipsent fan and I contacted Asrock customer support and they sent me a fan no charge.  I will continue to use their stuff on future builds.
The minute you said MSI board in it over ASUS I stopped watching. (After I submitted this comment)  MSI and ASUS are seriously the worst companies.  MEH
They damaged my monitor shipping it back to me aqnd wouldnt honor a new one, a discounted one, or simply having it shipped back to repair it. I took it out back, video taped me smashing it into the ground and I sent them the video clip. Asus f*^&*^g sucks, absolute garbage company. my last build with their products is the last time I invest with them as a consumer.
It's sad. For the last 20 years, my MBs and GPUs were Asus. My Desktop is from 2011 with a sabertooth x79 and use a GTX 1080 (2016). Works like a new. But I am near to build a new PC...
My asus 2080ti has bad fan bearing already i went and got aome bearing oil from an rc store and fixed 1 so i got 2 of 3 working but now i need to buy a new set
I love the taichi boards.. still rocking an x399
How are they sending you an RMA board? Why aren't they sending you new board when you can promote their products.
Asus has always been terrible quality. Every single enthusiest grade PC that walks into my shop with hardware issues are ALWAYS asus, Every single time.
Why do I get this video after I buy an Asus video card? wtf. They used to be fire
glad i stuck to my guns, in had 2x bad boards end of 2016, audio clipping issues and letency, second one was dead on arrival. Went to Gigabyte Aorus and zero issues..
I never use ASUS lately. Their x58 boards were solid
Asus sucksssssssss
nice video 👍
I'm glad I didn't wait for the 7950X3D. However, I regret getting an ASUS motherboard due to the lack of choice with BuildRedux. Nevertheless, it's been functioning well so far. Unfortunately, I've had a negative experience with ASUS in the past when dealing with issues. When I tried to initiate a RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization), they made it difficult for me. For example, I had an ASUS laptop with a failing Wi-Fi, which they initially fixed. However, in the process, they ended up breaking the onboard webcam and returned it to me in that state. I requested them to rectify the webcam issue and replace the power adapter, but they complained about wear and tear on the keyboard, even though I didn't ask for it to be fixed. All I wanted was for them to correct their mistake and replace the adapter.  To make matters worse, they wanted to charge me nearly $200 to replace a keyboard that had normal wear and tear, as it had been used for gaming for almost a year. This experience has led me to no longer support the ASUS brand in any way.
ASUS behaving like the DPP now sheesh. Breaking things and trying to silence opposition. More focused on branding.
Asus has attitude issues. Buncha arrogant priks who takes all the money but none of responsibility. I told their service centre rep in person their brand is garbage and I will never buy asus again. My out of warranty laptop turned brick when carrying out their bios update instructions. It was followed to the books. They wanted $700 for a mobo relacement when the laptop was sold new for $1000. Get fked lol.
did asus get bought out by china?
ASUS and Gigabtye have proven to be pure garbage.
THYE NOT EVEN WANT TO FIX WITH COST THEY PRODUCT THEY SUCK
I have a LAN issue on my ASUS Motherboard currently. The 2.5 GB port is not working well. Asus ROG Maximus Z90 Hero Respond if you have a fix please.
13:15 ASRock -- I'm not surprised you like them. I've been using primarily ASRock boards for a few years now and have not had a single problem. Also, ASRock boards offer great bang for the buck (features for price).  Funny, ASRock comes from ASUS, and the two companies are on opposing trajectories.
I live in the imaginary, reading between the lines states you are a nobody to them unless you buying their product cash and then reviewing it?
I've always been tempted to buy asus because "pretty" but end up staying with msi because I've never had any issues with their hardware.
My next board(s) won't be ASUS. They have continually shown they don't stand behind their product and made it really difficult on consumers for several years now. With the price of modern gaming boards and half the time there are issues, I'm done jumping through the hoops they have created just trying to get through the warranty process.
I literally told asus to piss off this week - I thought a port had blown on my mobo and I got the run around from their tech support. Pretty much told me to contact the seller I bought the board (brand new) from. All I asked about was my warranty and was given out to for contacting them first and not the seller - I wasn't asking about the sellers warranty. It took quite a bit of over and back to get a straight answer. Told them I'm done with Asus. Going back to MSI.
lol wow, I went with an Asus board this year when I made my 7950x and RTX4090 build because I thought they were good. I also got a second monitor, an Asus ProArt, for the same reason. However I haven't had any issues with the board as of yet. the one in my previous build was an MSI and that one did have issues which is funny because it's the exact opposite situation of what we have here.
I just received a "replacement" z690 hero mobo due to the capacitors being burnt out on my original.  The replacement board I received has the REVERSED capacitor that has been recalled.
Sad to hear this im still using 3 asus motherboard asus maximus hero z390 asus prime z390 and a mini itx asus all 9th gen all working amazing.
Really sad to see this, been a massive Asus fan for years. IDK what is wrong with these companies tbh
Maybe you can reach out to EVGA to see if they can start doing motherboards for AMD chips, this does open a void that they can fill hehe
I have an asus monitor, asus gtx 1080 and an asus mother board, from like 6 years ago was going to re-upgrade soon, but guess im not touching asus this time around
Was just about to buy a bunch of ASUS stuff in bulk for friends and family until i saw this video. Just gonna cancel everything i had added to my cart from ASUS.
Another issue that I am not sure is talked about is that their Zephyrus  gaming laptop have issues. I shouldn't have to go into the registry to stop the laptop from overheating itself for no damn reason.  G17 and the G15 that I tested both have done that. Idk just seems silly to me. The laptops kept overheating and crashing so I fixed their dumb default choice myself. At standstill with no applications running the ram usage was 80% and the computer temps were nearly 90 Celsius. I think Asus is acting like Razer in a sense. They are more focused on the look of the product instead of the longevity. Good choice Jay and all on this channel deserve the best BB
I was seriously considering the 16" 2022 or 2023 Flow X16 but after watching this video, I might have to reconsider. Luckily, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i (Slim Pro 9i) seems to check all the boxes I am looking for in a laptop.
Well I was going to make my next build Asus not anymore been using MSI and my only complaint is the app that controls the lighting which every time it updates it loses my profile but that is absolutely the only issue I have had......
I bought an ROG Ryzen chip laptop it was a huge powerful machine first gen the dam thing had so many problems I had to take it back to best buy and got a replacement and had the same problems. Bad keyboard the USB ports stopped working and there was other issues at one point the machine would just lock up. Its was a brick. For that price of a laptop massive machine that would break down so bad was just a pile of crap. Never went back.
I like how Steve has to comment before this guy will say something. They want to be always with the people no matter what. If everything was quiet he will say nothing I bet.
Asus motherboards sucks. Personal experience.
Not a fan of msi product. So what mobos do you suggest? I personally like gigabyte.
Okey so i have been using a tuff gaming b550-plus motherboard for the last 6 months do i need to be worried or am i safe?
I knew when i saw a regular knows nothing about PCs woman have an ASUS laptop ASUS was no longer the niche hero of pc building. They fell down the shareholder corporate greed model like every co. In this society. WE MUST CHANGE OUR ECONOMY AND STOP GREED/CORUPTION. Its most common human trait and everyone acts like its rare.
i just recently built a high end pc using ASUS ROG brand motherboard, gpu, and a ryugen II cooler. it worked great at first but then i started getting intermittent memory issues and graphics issues. it never stuck around so i could never solidify what it might be. i was suspecting the motherboard but i still wasnt sure. this video really sets in stone that whatever the problem is, its probably my motherboard. makes me sad because my build looks amazing. but the constant yet changing issues im having to deal with are really destroying this brand for me.
ASRock has been more reliable than Asus for me for over a decade. Haven't used an Asus board in well over a decade.
Jay: because of the bios issues  The Dev That publishes bios updates that uses the same boiler plate beta legalize and didnt change it because they were pressured to try and get a fix out: 😢
Asus has clearly gotten to the point where they think they have so much power nobody matters because to them they will still sell lol well maybe this time it wont work out for them!
That would explain why I have gotten random bluescreens and weird bugs
Amd is a beta platform....
Bmw now asus.. let me down. Trust is lower....
What about the gaming tuf a17s? are those coming out the gate DOA? I am looking to drop 1500 and need to know
I purchased a $3k+ ASUS Zenbook Pro Duo for work from B&H and it turned out to be defective; I was in love with the style of that laptop that when B&H confirmed that I could return it for a brand new one I did so... Got new one and it died not too long after I recieved it while I was playing a not very graphics intense game... thankfully B&H were amazing through this whole ordeal and they gave me a full refund.   TL;DR: f ASUS... B&H are amazing!
I was building a new PC in March and decided to go with a ryzen 9 7900x with the asus x670e-plus wifi board and corsair dominator ram, and I'm telling you there was only problems. Boot took close to 2 minutes, system would suddenly freeze and crash, my cam would suddenly freeze in the middle of a stream, windows told me it wasn't shutdown properly whenever I booted up the pc, it just wasn't functional. I swapped the board with an MSI carbon and everything has been working perfectly since then. Moral of the story, never go with asus when it comes to motherboards
Asus has been going downhill ever since they lied about vrm counts
How can Asus flopped the mobo for one of their partners so bad. They pulled a Newegg and paid for it
that is why I just bought Steam Deck instead of waiting for Rog Ally. I really do not trust Asus.
a Lot of respect for that video
I only like their monitor strix monitors. The rest I go with MSI. Screw em.
Ouch, ASUS no longer being good and reliable?
So they are....a business.  Crazy.
I am unsure if this is clickbait or not but I'm far ahead of everyone out of using ANYTHING ASUS/CORSAIR  products.
Great courage man
Good to know. Note to business owners and management: understand your audience and consumer. Treating them like money trees and giving useless junk back won't work indefinitely.
Bro is like blizzard apart of asus??
As someone that bought Asus rog laptop, it has been nightmare since day 1 it came and i will NEVER buy something from them again. Laptop had bluescreen on startup issued from the 1st boot and it took them 2 weeks before they agreed upon taking it in for inspection / repair. After that, i was sent the laptop back, with OS REINSTALL???? (not like i tried it 1st thing out of the box). In the paper i recieved (can provide if someone wants it) it was literally written that the laptop crashed upon first boot even when they tried it, but was fine after so it is all fixed. Ofcourse the issue was still the same and nothing changed. After another week of painfull experience, they took it back again, waiting 2 weeks, i got a replacement motherboard and everything was running fine. 3 days later, I picked up the laptop, closed it, rebembered something, opened it again and the screen was fucked. Random colors across screen, full black screen etc. +1 rma later, i found out they nicked the cable when putting it all back togehter and it was at the moment i closed it, the monitor cable just gave up. After the laptop came back the 3rd time, 1 srcrew was missing (they "overscrewed" it and it didnt hold in place), back cover popped in place in my hand after picking it up from the box. Never touching them again.
Would you take $500,000 or dinner with JayzTwoCents?
i had no issues with my asus rog strix b550 gaming motherboard or my asus rog strix 3050 rtx gpu. Was a sweet rig. just me tho. I mean if you build pcs every week...i think its safe to say youre going to have issues time to time. The average person builds 1 maybe 2 and they should be fine tbh.
even their "support" for a simple curved screen is non-existent. they just reply with a generic we'll get back to you, or we've sent that off to someone who knows something, and i never receive any kind of technical information or any relevant information whatsoever. sad, because i did like their products back in the day.
Glad I got an MSi board for my new build. Mpg z790 edge just sitting in the box waiting for my other components to come in.  Back in 2008 I had an asrock board fail, sent it into cx service and they fixed it. I ended up selling the board and it caught on fire in my friends tower. If asrock is better than asus than wow that really blows my mind.
Would love to see an asrock based gaming build from you haha!!
I would leave "You dont care" to their judgemant, however man you have a good point there.
i knew asus was trash when in 2011 i dropped my asus laptop and the charger broke the motherboard and they wanted 500$ for a new board.  every laptop ive bought since then has a charger port thats not directly soldered to the motherboard.
I used to run a Formula 7 until a couple of years ago and it was a really good board even their gpu's but with what's been going on I will be avoiding them for a while until ASUS improves their relations with everyone and up their game with manufacturing too. How can ASUS have dedicated ranges for Enthusiasts and the like and not deliver fully working products and the service that should be there for all customers etc.
It feels to me as bunch a crybabies crying about their MB don’t match the colors of their PC build. Ok fine there’s some stuff that needs improvement over asus side, but giving that much atention and mixing personal experiences with busines… makes me feel like bunch a crybabies crying about whatever.
Love this video, it's exactly why I switched to Gigabyte now.  Build turned out great and haven't had a single issues.
The last Asus motherboard i bought was back in 2013 was DOA put the pc together and power it up and nothing .. seems like they reverted back to the old ways again
Good to know that i should stay away from asus in the future i used to trust their products before but now wth are they doing this? well good to know that i should stay away from them.
good to know when I need new parts. MSI seems the opposite of ASUS, they were worse and they have gotten better of the years.
at least you got free shit I guess
Bought a asus monitor the xg27aqm and I totally regret it. It came with dead pixels. I returned it and got another one . However, the colors are waaaayyy too red ! And I hate it .
Sucks because their phones are awesome
This video has me asking, what does Jay think about the top motherboard brands today?.   Which ones are still good?  Which ones are meh? And are newer brands stepping up to the plate to fill in for failing brands?   That would make an excellent video.
Shout out To ASUS! They should have made their durability flagship consistent!
Hey J can I have one of those x670e motherboard 😊 I'll choose that one asus tuf gaming x670e-plus wifi 😊
I have asus tuf a17 which was unusable for 1.5 years because of temperature issues. After fighting and reaching out to asus Global team, Asus Global TSD team fixed my laptop and Asus gave me 1 month warranty extension after the laptop was stuck for more than 6 months in service center and was stuck in service centre since February, 2023 till now to actually get fixed along with outdated specification as they are 1.5 years old now I used to recommend asus but now I only warn people not to buy Asus
2 times is 2 time too many.
if the support is the only issue, then i'm good, here in south america ASUS is great with that, great warranty and overall quality
i have 5950x x570 dark hero and i have to run it in eco mode from bios or its sits at idle on 70 to 85c with watercooling if u have temp issue just search bios for eco and enable it
Why do you speak bad about China 🇨🇳
I wonder if ASUS ends up getting woke to try and get more costumers? lol
i was willing to buy a b550 asus board and asus 6700tx for upgrade  but not anymore i will look for msi or something.
Sorry but all this mock outrage and posturing is why I mostly watch GN now. No doubt in a few weeks you'll be all over Asus again and then they'll be a new company to bash, AMD maybe? It's tedious, seriously, but then it drives huge numbers of subs and views right?
Man, I had Asus laptop 2012-2016, and for several years Prime z390-A served me very well 2019-2023, but now I've lost trust on them. Treat how you want to be treated.
Building my own computers for almost 30 years now. Never had problems with motherboards, just a few DVD and hard drives. Current PC had a Asus motherboard and I'm experiencing restarts in the first 10 minutes after start (depends on room temperature). Always suspected a bad connection on the motherboard, but this confirms it.
Ooooooh shiiiiit 💀💀😟
i've been an asus fan for years, since 2012, i've only got asus products. i upgrade based on generations and was thinking of upgrading to ryzen 7xxx since i currently run an asus crosshair 6 hero with a ryzen 7 1800x paired with a rog strix 1080ti. i will upgrade to ryzen 7xxx, but the board will not be asus, probably an x570 godlike from msi, as for gpu will be a 7900xtx likely also from msi, or a 4090, but definitely not from asus.
You earned my Subscription. Glad I chose Gigabyte!
was just about to upgrade, TLDR dont buy asus thanks
So conclusion is avoiding Asus ROG motherboards, and go for Asus TUF and AsRock motherboards??
Is asus at blame or shitty amd ? Honestly just asking. Nvidia / Intel folks that’s the takeaway.
You just earned so much respect and credibility back
Ure so right ! i have an Asus Build with an Z690 Formula there have been an issue with the Watercooled VRM Block..... no communication to the costumer.... There was one quote in the FQA for about one week or so then it was gone nothing. Then this shit with the Bios 2305 it had massive Memory stability issues again no communication and they took the bios update offline then after two weeks or so online again with no backlfash compatibility.... no F***** ing word about whats going on.
@JayTwoCents Which motherboard should I replace with Crosshair X670E Extreme? I am building a Ryzen 7950x with 128GB RAM.
Sucks to hear. Always like Asus for many years. They must of tried to save money.
My recent support experience with Asus was exactly the same. The support person had no product knowledge and had clearly been briefed to get rid of customers with patronising, useless help that ignored the content of the support request or directed me to web pages with irrelevant info. Infuriating.
Hey man my M16 2021 had burnt LM on the heat sink. I wouldn't trust them again on putting it on so I did it myself. I understand the pain. My AX8U ASUS router bricked itself after not even 2 months running ASUS own firmware. So. Right now I've got to keep my laptop until I save up and switch. I feel bad really I really like the branding of ASUS but they dropped the ball.  Edit: I trust JayzTwoCents. Thank you for your solid honest content. You helped me with my first build and will take that to the next and into the future.
it's actually AM5 mobo dunno AMD maybe bad, I'm with intel 13th gen here run very well
Good
Good
In 2004 I bought an ASUS motherboard that had a problem with capacitors (too few yellow caps) that caused the constant blue screen. It can quietly issue a Rev1.1 without rev1.0 recall. The warranty processing took 6 months. Since then I've avoided ASUS
Every computer ive hand my hands in to help direct friends and family to build parts wise have always been pushed to Asrock because they've been highly reliable to me whether overclocking or not
I had a an ASUS Motherboard Prime And for some reason the motherboard kept on resetting and the USB Would stop working. I had to just get a GigaByte motherboard sad thing is I cant return the ASUS Motherboard and it was only a month old. I have an ASUS 3080 TI I just hope that don't die next
It's pronounced 'ASS🐎US' and yes even their brand new devices give problems🔥 on arrival. But same goes for HP  and Razer, both big fraud A-holes!
Armoury crate is the worst piece of dogshit a manufacter for motherboards has ever created, just wanted to say this,
Recently I've had nothing but problems with the x570 boards for both my machines. Working fine for over a year and the start of this year just so many random boot issues. VGA errors, HDD errors, mem errors and CPU errors. Somewhat stable now but still get some odd issues
Worst RMA ever  Everything i had eas in warranty.... took 28 days to set up the RMA. Shiping it out cost money, having the RMA shipback to me cost  more than the product at this point... Whats the point of a warranty if it made so difficult ti get the product in working condition?
Thank god I didn’t buy a asus ally
Hello there. I just bought a new gaming laptop, it's the Asus ROG Strix G15 2022 model. After 1 month, the laptop just goes black screen and no response. I just went tot the service centre and they told me that it's probably a motherboard problem and then I told him that it's a new bought laptop that's with me of only 1 month. The person couldn't believe it but told me that they will try to fix it since it's still under warranty. Right now I'm still waiting for their response and it's already been a week already, they said it's about 2 weeks at max for the repair.  TLDR, I'm having second thoughts on ASUS' quality. I like the ROG series but I might look at other brands if ASUS is like this.
I Love ASUS!! Don't forget ASUS ROG ALLY!! The next gaming system!!
Incompetence, or arrogance?
My next PC was definitely going to be on an ASUS MoBo... Now, not so much 😢
I think Asus has had a lot of issues with DDR5 ram. Last year I was having blue screens a couple times a day and now I still get them but usually when I leave the computer running. It's really weird but I've been reading similar stories from other people with my Asus motherboard. They sure take their sweet time to come up with proper drivers.
ASUS thankyou from being pro consumer and  cutting ties with these scamtubers! They are truely evil and only lie to their subs, I will only buy ASUS from now on.
my Asus board for my 10900k doesn't work with the integrated LAN if you enable 2.5G! It will work and then stop and hitch and disconnect and reconnect and this is all random. Making online gaming impossible. It is a hardware bug in the intel chip. Did Asus fix my board? no! The driver fix released fix it? nope! Disabling 2.5G was the fix, very sad. :(
Ive gone to MSI boards lately - they have been rock solid
Good to know, but are the laptops still reliable/any good? Thanks!
I just brought a Asus...
Asus = Target = Anhauser Busche = Pfizer = Moderna = AstraZeneca. Damn....
I have an Asus mother board but I have a i913900K so am I good?
Well, I’m about to buy a new laptop. I guess I know what brand I won’t be buying.
the only reason I'm commenting is because of the ad I saw you guys were in that almost traumatized me, where you broke the guy that was playing a game on a slow pc. I almost had a heart attack. I don't have money or anything well all I have is $20 dollars, I would give it to you for that pc at least it was something. I can't believe you did that. I know you have money and plenty of pc's but man that hurt. I've been trying to get money to buy one at least a cheap one, I would of want that one just because it was working. I just can't get over it sorry for me complaining but like I said it hurt. :(
Not gonna lie this seems like an over reaction
It's a real shame. Used to be the go to for quality and good experience. I have a full ASUS fanboy build and can't say anything bad about any of my components, but they're 2-2.5 years old by now....
Asusnumbahwan hahahahahaahahaha
Do u pay for the motherboard. If u didn't no bitching 😂
Here's to hoping my zephyrus g14 survives
9:46 wait I bought a Z690-wifi d4 mother board (im new to building and using a pc) and ive been getting random blue screens and crashes during my game or just it being on the home screen for a couple hours. your telling me that thats might be the reason why.
sO wHo dO wE bUiLd a AlL oNe bRaNd pC WiTh noW?
I was dealing with this a few years back when they wouldn't give me a replacement of a graphics card (1080Ti) that completely died under warranty. I went back and forth with them in emails for 6 months !! they wouldn't give me a replacement for the 6 months saying to try this and that and finally I went through a lawyer and sent them a legal letter. The next day I received call from their country manager asking me my address and sent the replacement card within a week straight from the factory.. I sold the card as is and have never touched any Asus products since..  If I didn't have a lawyer in my personal close circle I probably wouldn't have gotten a replacement after months of back and forth and countless calls waiting on line.. They don't respect the community, it's all a charade to cash in the 'fans' and then completely ignore them when it comes to support. Glad people are realizing that the company doesn't care about the customers and neither should we.
I'm on my 2nd Asrock MB, that is about 6 years, and an Intel CPU... no issues. I love Asrock. They are the only ones that provide the amount of SATA conections as I need for my 6 drives on a MB that does not cost a kidney and a lung.
So going forward with My new pc. Go with msi or gigabyte parts?
Even my monitor recently has been a let down. They product testing was not there. I have so many issues I don't even wanna list.
Asus is the new razer
i'd give asus a break, just be honest about flaws in a product, going to an extreme of total rejection doesn't work for a lot of things and won't work for you. taiwan is a country under threat of invasion and needs our support !
I refuse to buy any digital content that contains any form of drm. Except steam. Steam is the one exception that i gave in on. And i feel like steam is offering a service and convenience that makes able to feel okay about it at least.
2 times? Was the first one ThermalTake?
If that 790 Maximus Extreme in the foreground needs a good home, let me know. Been looking for one... apparently they're discontinued.
Good thing I use gigabyte/aorus hahaha😂
I love my Asrock Steel Legend X670E.  Not a single problem with it.  Just saying...
always run asrock never had a board fail got an asus router always having issues with it and it doesnt like to port forward
Subbed because of this video. asus has been garbage for years
Can I get the Bent pin board?
I don't buy Asus over 10 years, this is so mutch overpriced Rog shit...
Which mother boards would you recommend now??
Planning to upgrade my rig soon. Asus was my go to for a motherboard for all my past builds. What brand would you recommend?
wow.. this comes as a shock to me.  I am currently shopping for a new PC and thought to continue with the ROG ASUS line.  After watching this, no way I'm buying ASUS.  Thanks so much for the PSA and saving me grief down the line.
I already boycotted them after the capacitor thing. I had an issue with my x570  Crosshair Hero, and Asus was horrible about it.... then I heard about that and how they handled it and said I'm cutting my losses.  This is the year of the boycott!
What are you going to do with all those Asus motherboards?  No, I don't want one - I've had my fill of Asus builds, too.
I don't know how this got recommended to me but that Jesus sounds like a real jerk and I'm glad you fired him.
I work for a large corporation where I see the same sort of money hungry, arrogant leadership prioritizing profits and shareholders over the customer experience.  Overextending the promise of our marketed products without the capability to deliver reliably is hurting our brand.   Looks similar in this example.  Nice video.
You should use more asrock. I only had positive exp using asrock mobos. the bios is not as bloated as mis, gigabyte or asus and it is stable as fuck. maybe it does not get you the last percent of performance, but at least it does not crash and burn your stuff.
I was about to build 3 new PCS for my sons and myself and after seeing this clearly shows me the quality in these items are not good. I will not order anything from this company including MOBO or graphic cards. thank you!
i bought asus 1y ago, and i had a problem with their motherboard cozing me to lose 2 PSUs. i build haply my pc "boom" 1st PSu destroyed , revuilded it with other psu "boom" anoter psu destoryed. Luckly now eevrythjing is good but i would never buy asus for what i survived
I resell thier routers and modems and they are a pain in the ass to fix and sell. Especially since they are no better then Netgear. Only Asus and like d-link have stupid small tip cords. Every other manufacturer has regular style cords. Netgear, Tp-link, Belken, Cisco/linksys, arris/Motorola are the only brands that I’d ever support. They have a long shelf life an are easy to fix and always work! Asus are like the Apple of gaming equipment and doesn’t give af about their consumers.
I known for 15 years that ASUS is branded hyped garbo and have cautioned consumers ever since. I back then decided to make a ASUS build with the greatest hardware they had to offer in term of Motherboard and GPU, with quad GPU support promised. After a while the dual GPU graphics card burned it's RAM so it left artifacts. Why this happen? The cooling fan had only one speed, and that was slowest possible, if you wanted it properly cooled you needed to install software, and 90% of their software does not work like intended, unlike MSI where normally less than 10% of their software fails. And when i realized the RAM i had was not doing it's dual channel like intended i asked ASUS about what RAM i could use to fix this, they basically went with "F** U** we ain't telling you shit about what RAM would be suitable", it's as if they never had genuine support in the first place.  MSI has never failed me with their desktop hardware apart from a WIFI antenna that started going bad after 3 years and one software that did the opposite of intended. As for MSI laptops, they got zero clue how to make a functioning laptop, they can't even sort out the traditional 103 keys or even a trackpad or even cooling paste.  So yes, ASUS more like ASS-USS. Im never buying from them ever again nor recomend anything they make, just like with Realtek, if you see a crab on your computer chips, it's likely a bug/failure about to happen, they have a even longer trackrecord then ASUS of making cheap trash hardware that is bound to only function if it's forcefully integrated into the motherboard, and even then i would question it's viability and quality, to me it seems Realtek's attitude is "our customers are to dumb to notice that it's trash we salvaged from a less reputable brands trashbins".
As a property manager, I kind of get it.  I'll love an HVAC/electrical/plumbing provider because they do great work and show up quickly (becuase I can give them an enormous amount of business)...but they inevitably forget about me and stop showing up when needed and the work falls off....always musical chairs with service providers in my world.  I would imagine tech companies are similar with their products and customer service. lol
Re-Subscribed coz of Respect
I used to like Asus but my ASUS RT AC3100 just suddenly died just after a year of use and they won't RMA and my Asus LYRA I replaced it with has been nothing but junk . Got a tp link archer and has been flawless . Done with asus
I’ve been a fan of Rog for more than ten years now, Rog has been my go to option for mbs and laptops. Most of them work very well but the last laptop I’ve got from them was a big flop(keeps overheating itself although there was no load, fan spins crazy, random restarts, I’m not the only one who had this problem). My last purchase from them is a x670e hero mobo, so far it has been working without maybe too many problems except for some random kernel power issues alongside with a few IO ports issues. Moving on I guess I’m gonna go with gigabyte and MSI more often although I do like rog’s aesthetic design more, the way they treat their customers are just not acceptable
Honestly, I've used Asus for years but sounds like I've been fortunate to not have any problems. I have a mobo and 2 monitors from them, but honestly, this is enough for me to just not choose them in future. Thanks Jay!
So, I've had laptops fail from MSI, Razer, and Alienware. My current Asus laptop is really good, but now THEY SUCK TOO?? Who can we buy high end hardware from that DOESN'T suck??
Ill buy msi
Bruce Wayne was right. You die a hero or live long enough to see yourself the villain. Asrock! Cheers!
I've watched Asus quality drop steadily over the years. Bugs and general quality problems became more and more common and more and more significant. Asus was top-tier back when I was into overclocking. Now? I consider them a brand to avoid.  Thank you for the honest take on them.
$1k motherboards that blow themselves up with BIOS updates that void your warranty, and manufacturers wonder why enthusiasts just don't bother buying much new hardware these days. ASUS used to be the gold standard in reliability, but now they're just a shell of their former selves.  My last two ASUS motherboards were an ASUS ROG Strix Z390-I and an ASUS ROG Maximus VIII Formula. Solid boards for reliability, especially the Maximum VIII Formula. But after all of ASUS' recent mishaps, I'll be looking elsewhere. Jayz, do you have a recent video on board brands recommendations?
Thanx for the heads-up, looks like ASUS gets the budlight treatment from here forward.
I bought at upgrade kit this week and there was not one ASUS product in there. Thanks for warning us. ASUS underestimate the power of word of mouth. Hopefully this hits them where it hurts most. In the pocket. Its discouraging to see this (but the truth needs to come out) and then I think that I have a ASUS laptop and motherboard in my desktop and this is how they treat their clients.
I loved asus builds and I still do but the reliability just isn’t there anymore and their customer support is ridiculous. I still love their styling over MSI but as a brand asus just can’t be trusted. I’m sure they’ll make an attempt to bribe their way back in but even if they do it seems that the company as a whole is broken…
Lol, love all the virtue signaling coming from pretty much everyone. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it...  asus will "remain fired" until some indeterminate point in the future when they have made incredibly small, but obvious changes to appease purveyors, then when the water is calm again; people will be diving right back into that asus pond lol. Its fine really; just reminds me of everyone "quitting wow" not too long ago lol.
Years ago, my Asus P6T7 WS SuperComputer kept having component issues. I RMA'D it   FOUR times! and the last time it arrived, it came back with a massive crack down the middle of the board, then they told me that i intentionally damaged the board and said it was out of warranty, NEVER again, will i ever trust asus, especially after this video!    Thanks!  however, if you want to send me an x670e extreme.... i wouldnt mind... but will not pay for it :D
i'm running gigabytes in am5--thus far rock solid, stable and very fast. they seem to like hynx ram. years ago back in the socket 370 days i had a asrock that would run ddr or sadram--the old thing ran great for what it was. in am5 i would go with a gigabyte/asrock or MSI any day over asus
It's alot better to be loud about ur mistakes because it shows honor and the fact that u stand by ur product even when mistakes are made. Trying to hide shit is NEVER good.
Yuppppppp.  Had a diagnosed MB issue and they basically told me I had to send it to them and it was a 6+ month turn around time at the time.  No other option or cross ship for a motherboard that was practically new.   So my only option for a work from home pc was for it to be down for 6+ months.   Nah, im good. Never dealing with them again.
Speak up!!! I myself recently had issues with a asus product absolutely horrible I’ve had to replace a motherboard 3 times and have to waste 4+ months just waiting on parts never buy asus !!! Avoid them at all cost !!! If not it will just end up costing you more in the long run
My partner had issues with her Asus ROG Strix X470 for the longest time and we couldn't figure it out. Aside from the motherboard, her build and mine were identical. Random bizarre errors that just made no sense, especially based on the very basic usage she was doing with it (light gaming and streaming, that's it, nothing weird, no overclocking, nothing). Swapped to a different motherboard and all the problems went away like magic. They have been garbage for a while, never going back to them.
I love Asrock, being using its board for the pass 15 yrs.
Thanks for the video, changing to MSI now.
My last experience with Asus was not to long ago when I was looking for a gaming laptop. So I landed on the G14. That had issues with swapping from 60 to 120Hz. So after some back and forth emailing I got a replacement. It had the same issue. Had some calls with the Tech support, had to post some videos on YT and I was able to return it and go my money back.  So the costumer service was good, but  I didn't end up with a working device in the end.   Got a Lenovo Legion after that and that works just as expected.
Thx J! Noticed the same and switched to MSI this round. Much happier
Nice
Had the last good gen of Asus
Jayztwocents trying to be the good guy lol! It's respectable decision but you have been fired too
back in the day I bought a very expensive dual socket workstation board from asus, it was the only one around that had PCIE Gen 3 for this socket/chipset. Turns out, no, the chipset cannot do gen 3. Not a big issue if not for the fact that I spent so much extra money specifically on this one because of that feature (mucho monies SSD cards back in the day, speed was everything). They jerked me around for 6 months 'the website says it has it, so it HAS to be user error on your part'. Finally they got one and their engineers verified, it indeed does not do the thing. No refund, and they said they'd update the website with the correct specs. 10 years later and its still got incorrect specs. This wasn't some El Cheapo board, it was uber expensive and hard to get. I never bought a single trashsus product after that, and never will agian.
This is incredibly vindicating to hear. Asus completely screwed me on a Rog Strix board that never even booted up. Sent it back and they claimed that there was a drop of thermal paste on the board and it was my own error. WTF is that?? I had been an Asus faithful for over a decade at that point. But the truth is that I've had THREE Asus (Asrock and Rog) boards either die within 6 months, or never booted up to start with. I'm still stuck without a gaming computer after building one TWICE within 2 years. But never had an issue with a cheap Gigabyte board. They even had the gall to say they were going to charge me for the service!!! They didn't even bloody do anything. I doubt they even opened the box, at this point.  The irony is that I'm still running my old Asus tower that I bought from BestBuy in 2014! Works like a champ with a 4th gen i5, with a year old Asus monitor that I'm now paranoid about. But I'll never spend a dime on that brand again.
I remember i had a Sony tv it lasted 20 years before it diet and now everything u buy from phones to tvs to cars to washing machines everything is dying in les then a year max 2 years sad
Okay next build i'll be Hard Asrock build
Me on my asus monitor👀👀
Used Asus most of my life.  Learn to build computers mine runs fine!!!
DRAGGED. Not Drug.  For gods sake Jay.
If ASUS have inked an agreement with you i know this video will never happen so 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 money money
this is why you dont outsource to asia
I feel like I'm done with Asus, my entire set up is Asus and a while back when I upgraded to there 3080 it was massively underperforming and they said nothing can be done like it's just luck of the draw? It shouldn't of passed testing but it somehow made it onto the shelfs. Now it is in my pc only giving me small improvements over my old 2070 super which it should of been destroying in every aspect. Now I don't know what brand to switch to for future upgrades, any suggestions people?
I have not done a build in a few years and am looking to build for my wife. I immediately went to ASUS, because I am a fan of the ROG series, but so glad I watched this. Now that ASUS has gone to crap, what would be the best brand recommendation?
Why would u use on board audio with such a blind setup mr jay. That's crazy
Had to rma mine due to usb instability.
I accidently applied the incorrect BIOS to my Asus GPU (normal BIOS for a V2 version). Why is there no check by the way? Then I asked Asus whether they can provide me with the original BIOS to flash it back... They dont! How can they NOT have their own BIOS? I asked again and explained it further, but they kept telling me that they only have the BIOS available on their website and they cannot provide anything else.
I have a fx504 from 2018. Worst laptop ever. Materials sucks, performance are not so great, overheats really easily (I just changed thermal paste yesterday), changed ac port, hinge totally destroyed. Funny part is that I,m not using pc so much anymore so yeah it really sucks.
ASUS has really disappointed me recently. I have had a MESH network comprised of 4 ASUS routers.  I love it!  However, when I was considering some upgrades/new routers I found ASUS lacking. When I called Customer service I was shocked at the lack of knowledge and inability to answer what I thought were simple questions. Did some digging on various social platforms and found a very sharp downturn in the reputation of ASUS. When my routers finally start to die or no longer able to perform I have not idea what I will do.   What alternatives are there to ASUS routers?
thanks bro was about to buy a new  pc parts and monitor  from Asus ( cause i like to buy quallity products in general  that will hold for many years ) but now i change my mind and will be looking for other brands  i can relly on. it will cost me alot of of my hard earned money and i dont change pc every year  (i do every 5 years or so) , thanks for your honesty !
I stopped buying Asus 10 years ago. They make unreliable products. That was my experience.
I’ve always had good things with  Asus I always go there tuff gaming  stuff . Sux to hear they are going down hill
My last product from asus was a video card, bought it in January, and well. Ended up with a broken video card. I've spend like 5 months gathering for a new rx 6700 xt and well. money wasted.   Got nor replacement, nor help from asus. Well so much for so much money wasted. Guess I will need at least 1 more year to gather for new parts.
My only experience with AMD and Ryzen was my first computer build ever. I can't remember the board or much about it. But what I do remember is have 5 years of blue screens. Whenever I would restart my computer for any reason it would get worse too so I had to leave it on 24/7.
I used to swear by Asus. This is disappointing. They need to tighten up
so in the last few months I have had usb disconnect issues, can't figure it out for the life of me, have other friends completely different settup and same kind of issues going on. to me they have fcked windows in the resent months, I thought my pc was getting old but these issues sound very similar, and exact same pc on all day then bang, random crash shit, and then suddenly its all fine and working again. should talk about how every app has individual profiles forced by nvidia, so when you set the global tabs setting it " DOES NOT " change it for all apps and some are defaulted to adaptive power, so to me all the different predefined profiles, by the developers, is messing with things but what do I know, I'v went and individually changed them but it revertes every windows update and its a pain in the ass even though it does seem to make my system run better, steam is defaulted to be forced to adaptive power for some reason also..... not sure if that is related in any way but I'v seen like nobody talk about it.... still never buying asus again now.
Well, I heard Asus has finally extended warranty to beta BIOS releases as well. I'd say it's about time. The problem is....I want to upgrade my 5800x to a 7950x3d and my rog strix b550-f to an x670e-e but now....idk. I like amd and rog but I might have to switch to an i9-13900k and a z-790 if it keeps going like this.
Capacitor is the other way around bwahahahaha
Well shit. I am in debt after building a PC using their product. FML.😭😭😭
So when Asus is no option which motherboard should i get
A shame I have a newer ASUS board. Definitely a big money sink now that I have it.
I stopped buying Asus products about 15 years ago. Every motherboard I purchased had some annoying problem and they refused to help. I've always told people since that, they make pretty stuff but not good stuff.
I wrote to asus years ago to change their name to anus .
It's a bit over dramatic when you say ASUS is shit because you are getting everything for free but it's black not white. You make money because they send you free shit. But I agree with the rest.
i hate msi.... but im letting go of asus because of this video... thank you jay
Hearing this sucks because ASUS is normally my go to
Thanks for the warning, I was just thinking about building a new PC lol
What brand motherboards should we use now? 😭
What magic hacks is this... if you google Asus RMA, you get nothing but ASUS sites for the first 2 pages of results... I've NEVER seen google results be so monotone  How is it that it's not until the third page of results that you start getting into reddit user stories, toms hardware forum complaints, etc...   Do ASUS have some sort of Bot-swarm messing with the google algorithm or something? I genuinely want to know, and I would love to see the Spiffing Brit do a video on it.
jay is a man of the people
Nice video
Basically this mean don’t build a pic without looking at a video of the same build cuz u never know ur 600 dollar moon might break ur 1500 dollar cpue
Glad I’ve seen this.  I was going to buy an ROG laptop for $2000.  That’s a lot of money for me as a student.
Asus and Gigabyte had problems with internet Adapters as well and Asus just released 1 driver update in the beginning of the z490 launch and thats it. It still causes internet drop and if you ingame you disconnect.
My first motherboard was a ASUS and that was 20 years ago and already had problems on the high end 😂
When I upgrade my current PC (Asus motherboard)  I won’t be buying another ASUS motherboard and be looking at other brands.
I don't know if it's due to the recent videos I've been watching regarding ASUS, but I have been facing a lot of problems in the new build. I bought ASUS TUF B450 in 2021. I went with ASUS because I always wanted an ASUS board and I used to love the BIOS (specially because tech channels used to specify ASUS BIOS being the best, and ngl, it looks cool)... But since past few updates I've feen facing issues such as memory problems, freezing and NVMe not detecting randomly (even when system is ON). The NVMe problem is not only with the M.2 slot but the Samsung 860EVO SATA SSD as well. My previous GPU (GTX1060) just died randomly while the system was ON, back in October 2022. The GPU worked really well throughout and had no thermal throttles whatsover (I don't overclock GPUs as I just do casual gaming). I have checked different power supplies to fix all the issues I faced, but nothing seems to work. I think I should consider a different motherboard in my next build.
O damn, I just spent $2700 on a new Asus desktop ASUS ROG GT15CF Gaming Desktop Computer - 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900K 16-Core up to 5.20 GHz Processor, 32GB RAM, 8TB SSD, GeForce RTX 3060 12GB Graphics, Windows 11 Pro - I don't know much about this stuff anymore, I hope I'm safe. I've been buying asus stuff for about 20 years and it's always been awesome.  Seems like they are starting to behave like Dell.
At work, we exclusively use ASUS boards. Expensive ones. And I've always scratched my head why it takes these "premium" boards so crazy long to POST. Time to splash screen is long. Time from splash screen to OS is long. At home, because I'm broke, I have pretty much the cheapest board money can buy (yes, ASRock) and it boots like a bat out of hell. Now, I'm assuming there is a reason why the ASUS board takes longer, but... somehow, that alone has made me dislike ASUS boards. I feel like paying a premium, you should expect a better "experience" than if you went with the rock bottom equipment?
Stand by your values and watch how many people are really on your side. Keep up the great work Jay, better to lose a crappy company than the consumer. 💯💯
Well damn, I guess I'm not using ASUS in my next build
Can we just mention how 💩 asus software is?
common sense.  don't use beta released bios firmware
I am a diehard fan of ASUS but unfortunately when I purchased a laptop from them within less than 2 months, I had to send it to one of their service centers for repair.  Asus's build quality has gone downhill where It may still have great performance the builds are cheap and don't hold up as well as they used too. I have not had any issue with any Lenovo dell or apple laptops. but unfortunately when I decided to get a 2023 ROG first laptop to die on me. Also happened as said above within less than 2 months.
Sad to hear. I have an Intel/Asus build that has been awesome. It is 3 years old now so maybe that was before they really went down hill. I will steer clear going forward.
So I'm all for calling out poor customer/consumer service but let's not forget what MSI did with their nvidia 3000 series gpus.
I had a sabortooth motherboard, and it was amazing. So i bought the gaming + wifi x570 motherboard, and it left me feeling like it wasn't quite as good of quality granted. im comparing a top of the line to mid level new but still seemed off quality.
This happens with intel to.? Or just one AMD platform?
I've said this several times in comments but this is exactly what happened to me in my I9 9900 build with a Asus board. I updated the BIOS, the BIOS overvolted my chip, then two days later, they pulled the BIOS from the website. It took forever to get them to own up to it and by that time, the 10900 boards were out and they didn't have any of my board in stock anymore. I got them to send a WS board of similar price, but it's still in the box years later.   I used my first ASUS board after the board in my first build crashed (Foxconn Bloodrage, remember those boards?). I was brand loyal for years.   Never again.
When I build a PC I do NOT care about looks and RGB. I care about two things and two things only, QUALITY and PERFORMANCE. The rest is not important to me.
So should I cancel my Rog Ally preorder ? I just wanted a good pc handheld and honestly scared if they won’t fix any defects if it arises
PC Part Manufacturers are getting lazy af. Faulty asus boards. Shit value gpus both amd and nvidia, no good 140mm fans, only 120mm, no innovation, they are just lazy, they dont do anything good now.
The only time I ever owned an ASUS product was a laptop back in 2016. Battery died within 2 months of owning it, & I didn’t even game on it! I was using it for study when I wasn’t home. Needless to say I haven’t owned any ASUS product since & never will! Bastards!
I recently got an ASUS Z790 E-Gaming WiFi, and THEN I see this video... Now I need to know I should return it-
Dropped Asus in 2006, because of problems with video card drivers. Support didn't care. So I banned them from my private and business life.
Imma sit back, relax with my AM4 and enjoy the $h!tsh0w.. 😊
Really a shame, Asus was such a good company for quality ten years back.
Alright, thanks for the info. If I‘d ever be to buy asus stuff, I‘d do that at a reseller, because I hate exactly this kind of drama with bad customer support. Thumbs up for that. 👍
Was working on an ASUS build; Because of this video, I will look for alternatives. Thank you!
I just bought the Asus Rog Strix Z790-E motherboard, the system freezes for an inconsistent time and I have to reset it, sometimes after 4 hours, sometimes after 2 hours. To test PSU power, I stress-tested both my graphics card and CPU at the same time and had no problems. Thinking it might be from the rams, I tried to plug it in and it still kept freezing, and I didn't get any error codes as a result of trying with memtest86. This time, thinking it might be from the motherboard, I returned it to the place where I bought it and bought the same motherboard from a different place, the result did not change. I really can't figure out what the problem is. 😩
JayzTwoCents always keeping it real and true. ALL my homie watch JayzTwoCents as well and Jake Baldino.
i must admit always been a asus fan boy   never had any problems  whit any of there products   but  how  this all went  i will never use them agen i really want to build  a platform around the 7950x3d  but   i think il  wait a while
I started my first PC build late october last year and ended up only two months ago. I bought all my parts including the asus prime motherboard assembled my pc with my friends help and we started it up. Initially it worked but after about two hours of run time it continued to crash. In total it took half a year to have a functioning PC. I had to take it apart and put back together a total of three times two of which were more stressful since I did it myself in order to diagnose what was wrong. Aside from that I took it to a pc consultant two seperate times, I live in the middle of nowhere so it was an hour and fifteen minutes one way to the PC techs place, and they couldn't figure out what exactly was wrong. Then I had my friend who is very knowledgable with pc building/works with companies setting up servers/networks help me eventually when he was free. We narrowed it down to my memory or my motherboard and I ordered another set of ram to see if it was a faulty stick of ram. Since both of my ram didnt work properly we assumed it was my motherboard. Since I started the RMA process somewhere inbetween all of this and waiting for parts and everything going on in my life at the time, I had to buy another motherboard entirely since the processing time for asus RMA's only give you a month from when you first contact them about wanting a RMA. Bruh. So it was the worst first pc build experience ive personally ever heard of first hand and I wont be building one again. It Is fixed now but I m out a whole motherboard and one set of very nice ram almost 500$. Asus wasnt very helpful or understanding with my situation so that didnt help me in all of this.
Imagine being someone who works for these companies and wake up and see notifications for an upload by these tech youtubers videos and seeing your company 😂😂😂
Sadly most of the time the bigger the company gets the less they start to try and give a damn.
To draw from your MOST important point in this whole video. When do we get to see this megaman build???  Im just about to build a new PC and this has put me right off using ASUS components. Im sure i wont be the only one. Companies need to get their heads around that YT creators have a hell of an influence on the market these days and sort their shit out.
What is this FOIA situation? Was there a class action lawsuit with a gag order? I am so confusion.
It is sad to see a brand we used to trust failing this way, I experienced their weak support when I had an issue with my newly purchased laptop few years ago but I didn’t bother that much because it wasn’t that bad and my  strix 2080ti works fine with no issues, but after this I am hesitant to go with their strix 4090 or z790 hero. Hope they get these issues sorted out and get back to what they used to be
As rock gets a bad rep they genuinely make good products. I'm still running my first build and my asrock rx5500xt still runs every game almost perfectly. I have an Asus rog b550 and it's been solid but I think I will find another brand when I build another pc. Asus has good hardware but crap software
They told me they ran out of Cyberpunk 2077 keys when they were doing a promo that gives you a free game with a router. Never touching that pile of rubbish again.
Right after this video Jay apologized on another video to the world that his credibility is at a 0 he should never be trusted.
I've actually built over 60 machines with ASRock motherboards over the last couple of years. (Mostly AMD builds.) I've had issues with exactly (2) of them and ASRock handled the issues promptly and professionally. As you commented, ASRock had definitely made the effort to upgrade their products and service. I only use ASUS motherboards when a client insists on one.
I’ve always built around Asus products, but honestly every single ROG builds I’ve done for myself and friends have alwayssss had problems. This confirmed what I felt for a years now with ROG…damn shame about ASUS as a whole tho
This sucks. I just went from gigabyte (horrible RMA experience with the GPU and Motherboard) to ASUS (B550A) so now I’m wondering should I send this damn thing back ?!
This brand didn't just die, it was murdered.
Damn, my last few builds had ASUS parts in em. This sucks to hear.
My first Asus product was the Asus Zephyrus M15 2022, with the 3070Ti.. I had to do 3 separate RMA’s for it, due to it just out of nowhere, stop powering up. When the keyboard lit up, a few seconds later it just cut off, bought a new charger after the second RMA, when it still hadn’t been repaired!! Which only temporarily fixed the issue. Sent it off for the third time, as it began the not powering up thing again, couldn’t even access the bios or anything too during all of this, not sure when was wrong with it, but it works alright now, but they hardly communicate what the issues were with the laptop, they’re just terrible.
Thanks, based of this I had to cancel my Asus Ally pre order. This is bad.
This is what happens with company when finance and marketing people (who were selling Coke or cereals 3 years ago) take over. And technical people actualy developing and making the product are left behind.
Do if  I'm not going Asus for  gaming laptop what to buy then
Asus is dead
MARKERS MARKERS MARKER, please use markers... specially on long videos.
I think I'm going to stick with ASUS until I personally have an issue.
If ASUS has any doubts what consumer care and support can eventually do to a brand - I had a pre-order for the Ally, then I watched what was going on via Steve and you, and I canceled that pre-order out of concerns for support. I'd rather get Steam Deck regardless of hardware power and age because of the support for the platform.
The sides have fallen a lot in terms of quality
What about rog7?
Nice
buy more Asus fuck those hypocrite YouTubers destroy brands for profit.
Glad brands like EVGA exist to set a gold standard
maybe you need to buy your own boards to review ...  they are always PERFECT ...         they send those boards out to lots of youtubers so, its like dating the girl that did the hole football team... stop complaining
ASUS reputation: gone
Should I be worried that I recently purchased an Asus GT-AXE16000 recently?
For the maindboard, MSI will be my first choice (most of the people's choice actually), 2nd is ASRock if I'm in a tight budget, 3rd is Gigabyte if there's no choice. For GPU is the same for MSI the 1st choice.
Thank you.  Unfortunately for Asus, I highly doubt I will return to them. Looking forward to new models from other brands you recommend.
I have the exact same issue with the USB, it doesn't read my thumb drive until I reboot. I am the latest bios. How annoying. Where do we even log the issue?
I think we're seeing the end of the DIY pc era.
Stay away from Asus. Got it! I hope Gigabite is a bit better.
Can you do an update on the company blacklist for people just wanting to build a new pc today?
Who fucked up now Jay?
So what is the best now? I want to build a new system
ASUS MORE LIKE ASUCK
Is it meaning AM5 is unstable for both motherboard and AM5 cpu?
What dis Asus do?  I've used them for my last three builds (one core i5 and three core i7's (different generations).  Every single one of those systems still works, spanning back at least 10 years.
Is this only for 7800 chips? I have a 7950 with an asus board, should I get a different board?
Wow, what news on Asus! I've always thought Asus has been one of the best brands to rely on.
Who are the better brands right now?
Asus quality has gone down and so has corsairs. Was a mad corsair fan and they have just gone to shit.
I've been complaining about Asus for a decade. So glad people are finally picking up on how much of a s**t company they have become.
Could this be why my build with an ASUS board keeps having boot issues?
Have been espousing the mediocre-at-best quality of asus shit for 15 years, the ONLY reason they're so popular is because they absolutely FLOOD the market with advertisements, sponsorships, endorsements, everything.. You can't read a news article while taking a shit without seeing an asus ad being jammed down your throat. Every asus product I've /ever owned/ has shit the bed, every one. But I've still got SOCKET 3 motherboards from the early '90s from other manufs that still work just perfectly.. But in my entire retro collection up through to current-gen hardware, nothing asus ever survives.
I was gearing up to build a new PC and was going to use another Asus board because I've always used Asus boards. That's not gonna happen now. What's the next best brand?
We sell Asus products (amongst other brands) at work and Asus is by far the biggest culprit for RMA and warranty claims
A 700 bucks mb to run at defaults is not a good sign
These seems like a bad GF break up. Bad break ups usually only the bad comes out.
Thanks Jay, I was on my way to get a Zephyrus M16 but stopped short after coming across this. 👍🏾
I've had ASUS laptops for the last 15 years.  I bought MSI this year.  Between the price difference and all the bad press I couldn't see risking the money and more than likely having to deal with issues/drama.  I'm happy with my MSI vector gp76.
I blame biden
Fucc ASUS, the customer is always right
Won't you loose Asus Fan looking your channel  for their product review ? PS: I also lost trust in Asus my next build will be Full MSI, I still rock my MSI 1080Ti today and still love it, but went through so much hassle on Asus Motherboard... Hero XVII Hero XII etc....
This is awful. Thank you bringing this to light, Jay.   I have 3 PCs at home and each has ASUS products in it. And thankfully they’re a little older and all okay.   But this is bs and there’s no way I can trust them anymore if you can’t trust them.
I was about to drop 5k on an asus computer. I decided to look it up i am so glad i did i wont be getting any asus computers.
Still sounds better than my dark pattern experience with LG. (I won't ever buy anything LG ever again, from fridges to phones) This Asus issue partly comes from the consumer shift from traditional retail to online purchasing. With traditional retail the retailers usually ended up on the hook if they stocked bad products, and if a manufacturer screwed up too bad they would loose the sales contract for a whole retail chain.  With the online thing the manufacturer usually just looses a single customer while still keeping the money for the completed purchase.
Asus you are very relaxed!!!(((
Ordered a white 4080 from Asus on the Amazon store and they sent me a black 4080. I sent it back immediately, I didn’t even have it for 10 minutes 🤦🏽‍♂️
Youre saying that all the youtubers builds being faulty were asus fault and not amd? xd
I got MSI motherboard for phenom 2 and worked 10~ years. Now have asrock since 5600x... Works fine.  Graphic cards Asus worked fine; 7770 worked 6-7 years, rx560 works, rx6600 works
i was about to get an asus board to replace the one in my home server that’s messed up, but i ima go with another one even if it costs me more
Nailed it.  You hit it on the head and did it over and over again.  Thank you for your honesty and for even giving them the chance for redemption.   ASUS used to be king, but the king got greedy and has now fallen.  It felt so much like when they started with the ROG crap, it was a money grab.  Now they won't even stand behind their own product (ie MB and BIOS)?  They really don't get it and have lost touch with who they were as a company.
I used to be such as Asus fan since the Pentium 4 days. 2-3 Years ago it all changed. Too many issues with many products they offered. I was such a shill for Asus products. Swore off them. Haven't looked back. Its a  Shame. They were so stellar years ago.
Glad i went msi for the new mobo.   Used asus years ago, didnt know it had taken a turn like this.
My budding doubts about ASUS began with the Maximus VIII series. The only board in VIII line not to have the M.2 SSD connector was Impact. Instead they used a completely out-of-place enterprise grade U.2 connector, severely crippling it's usefulness in SFF builds. Many decided to sit that one out, and wait for ASUS to come to their senses with the IX series. ASUS responded with an announcement that Maximus Impact would be discontinued due to declining interest in ITX boards; the wording made no attempt to recognize or address the poorly regarded design decision and popular discontent, instead it portrayed the platform as a dying fad. Looking back at it, I believe they were already planning to cross the $1000 boundary with the Maximus product line and couldn't have an ITX board hanging along, so they knew perfectly well how to sabotage the sales just so they make a slim profit and make it look as if responding to demand.
I appreciate this video. Was seriously going to pull the trigger on an Rog ally. After hearing the way people are being treated I'm not going to even bother.
It wasn't that long ago when I remember Jay saying something similar about Gigabyte, how they were done with Gigabyte because there were too many products arriving that were DOA, followed up by poor support. Now Jay takes Asus off the board along with Gigabyte, probably two of the largest mobo suppliers out there. That doesn't leave much left over to pick from. I've never been a huge fan of ASRock, and I had bad experiences with MSI where I had very poor support. To me since the start of the pandemic and these last two years of super high inflation, just about every company I've had to deal with, there support has gone out the window, but they have no problem taking you money. it seems there QA has also gone out the window, and I had to replace a lot of poor quality products.
I completely agree with you Jay this should not be a thing !!!
Bummer, I just got an ASUS GPU...might have to go swap that out
You should have bought the MSI.
I agree with you on Asus. everything has been going down hill for them. And i as well will be moving to MSI as well. But i will say i think your main issue is your AMD CPU. I dont see near the issues you been having at all. I9 13900k, Asus Z790 Hero, MSI 6950
That's real scummy of ASUS, how can they release an update they know has issues then say "OH, btw if you use that you void warranty". Seriously wtf
"And we got the black one.... and obviously, it doesn't fit.." LMAO!!
👏
Brilliant video, thank you for your loyalty to the customers! Also a small suggestion here - when you test and review stuff, please try focusing more on the "companion software" as very often while the hardware can be great the accompanying software is a total disrespect to the customer and can totally destroy the experience. For me personally this was the case with the Asus Sonic 3 and Realtek Audio Console for their Maximus motherboard (outdated documentation, hard to find correct downloads, compatibility issues). Currently I'm dealing with a similar problem but this time with Corsiar iCUE (some features never worked since I bought their K100 keyboard - like hardware lighting, and now I'm stuck in a situation when their software can be neither uninstalled nor reinstalled on my machine, rendering this expensive keyboard pretty much unusable atm)
I always went Gigabyte.
Yeah man! It's been real. Great brand with good products (in the past) but enough is enough.
I used to love Asus ROG gear. Had a ROG laptop that was giant and solid AF and it was great! But that was like... a decade ago XD
Respect sir🤍
People who assemble pc's know you have to steer clear of ASUS. Oh and Dr Disrespect has ASUS... get it? :)
"Keep your stuff."
asus already had kind of lost me. believe was a strix 900 series gpu, something like 30% less performance than printed on the box. shame really, as i learned computers it was always the go to brand.
Hi Jay, I have been using ASUS MB and graphics cards since Core2Duo era. I love that you are straight forward stating facts, but maybe its just a shitty period.. I mean, yes some products are better from MSI this year , next year maybe Gigabyte is the best etc, but saying you are fired to a brand that its consistently good for many many years, sounds a bit harsh to me. What if you want to run an Asus MB in your rig in two or three years ? Are you going to stand by your current statement?
I'm not going to be picky on aesthetics, just give me a quality product!  If you're saying Asrock has given you absolutely no problems, then most likely I'll go with that brand!
damn. I've been an ASUS rog guy I have built 3 rog PC's in the last 18 months but thanks for the eye opener I will be searching for a new trusted brand maybe EVGA. if anyone has any recommendations feel free to let me know
i got one Asus motherboard with bant pins from the box, but ASUS saying talk with local retailer , but they saying "band pins " is my problem ... and i can pay for the fix, that cost around motherboard price...  asus didnt even let my ask for support when i state the country.
I built my first pc a couple of months ago, and im glad i didn't go with Asus. I wanted to build with Asus, but I've seen so many people giving it negative reviews, and I'm glad i looked it up before I bought it.
So for years ive been pronouncing it wrong? Lol i always called them A-SUS not Soos 😂
I trust more the chinese now
Buy an Nvidia graphics card now!!
Sadly as much as I've trusted the brand but yeah it's dropped in quality.  This is sad because I thought it was an installer issue. Time to look around 😢
So what do I switch to Msi?
I bet this sellout (jay) will start working with them again , its just a matter of time
I always ordered an Asus board. well not anymore.
*I've bought more AsRock boards then Asus boards* They USED TO BE located in Indiana and USED TO BE cool. Now I've sent them bad boards and they returned me WORSE BOARDS. I've bought a laptop or 2 from them, BUT the Customer Support was in Taiwan or something - No more Indiana. AsRock has treated me very very very good with the rebates and Customer Service from what I can remember.  Asus employee said years ago = *You can buy MSI and settle for a Buick. When you buy Asus, you're getting a Mercedes Benz* HIS QUOTE
Not surprising to me, I had an issue with the 1st generation zenbook (blue screened after 1month of owning it brand new).  I went through hell trying to get it fixed through warranty.  I was out a laptop for months… i haven’t purchased anything ASUS again…
No data statistics evidences? Source: DTM
You know I have only been buying Asus products strictly for the past 15 years. Now I have no idea what to buy is probably the sentiment for quite a few of people.
I bought am5 650 E gaming for the new Ryzen 9 7000 series would I change my motherboard different one
lol when i upgradet my pc i got an asus motherboard with smashed cpu pins and they told me i did it and refused to replace it so i had to buy a new motherboard (msi) i now know that asus is a shitty company and i will never buy anything from them anymore
Arghh, was looking at buying a new mobo and was gonna go for ASUS. Not sure anymore...
I have been buying and suggesting asus for the past 20 years. It always seemed quality. They cost a little more, but i never had problems with them. I will need to be a bit more cautious.
Funniest thing is I’ve ran AsRock boards in 3 systems since like 2002, and none of them have had problems.
I'm so supporting this, they have no clue in software, ive had problems with my ROG 49" screen mostly related to their so called "Asus Widget Display" software (official), this thing is a complete sh!t, not only that, they will not even try to support you with this software because they got a 3rd party to make that for them so they just dont support you with that - as simple as that, they just DONT.   Also there is nothing impressive with that screen beside its physical size, its VA panel 3840x1080 144hz, i do have Dell UHD 49" as well, which is way but way more impressive in every damn aspect.  Back to software, their PN 50 mini computer are awesome, beside the fact the something with the eth/wifi is just messing up and switch them every now then,  super weird, happen to all of them( ive got 8 of them!!) and yet no one from Asus regardless of its role was able to help me.  This video is just on point, if they lose it on the hardware side, they are done, thanks Jay, youre the voice of all the small unheard consumers.
Apple same way too . M2 chips get real hot
Steve has made the pc industry into a big drama
My asus zenbook pro duo cpu died randomly. Spent 2k on it. Bought another for 1k screen damaged just to change motherboard over and sell parts off it! Lovely laptop but always thinking it'll die again. Probably sell it off and cut my losses.

I got a lot of Asus products. Worst Support on Planet earth. I wish i would be joking, you guys have no idea how Bad the Support really is. No help, they dont speak your language or Englisch correctly. No help, they try to avoid every warranty case. Its hardcore.
I once had a laptop from Asus like ... 14 years ago. And never bought their production again cause it was a piece of junk in terms of quality.
Glad you have taken this step Jay, glad to see there are people who still have integrity!!! 🤝 Asus complacency and anti consumer tactics couldn't come in a worst time for them when they are about to launch the ROG Ally hopefully people will see Asus BS and think carefully about buying the console.
Thanks Jay, updating my PC from Z270 had zero issues with my MSI board (and gpu), but was thinking of trying Asus, guess I'll stick with MSI
I will be switching away from Asus in my next upgrades
After I finish my car build, I'm building a vr driving sim rig, I officially won't be using any Asus.
Thank you jay, it’s guys like you that can hold these companies responsible.  Much appreciated for looking out for the consumers 👍
They were making Asus tuf laptops motherboards fry proccesors. Mine was one of them
this hurts really bad... been an asus fanboy for YEARS phones. tablets. and PCs rocking a full asus tuf pc now even the ram is ASUS TUF alliance.... the TUF AIO broke down after 4 months so thats now a Cooler master. and had some small problems with m.2 randomly disconnecting.. never occurred to me that it might be the board... O.o...  Question- is this also a problem for asus bs550 boards ???????? should i get something else?
I literally just ordered a gaming rig with ASUS motherboard and parts and an ASUS laptop 🤦‍♂️ Cancelling now, not going to waste $5,000 on ASUS.
I had 2 ASUS laptops both gaming. I like them both but keep in the quality they died.😢 So yeah I don't go with aces anymore and if you're talking about desktops no way am I going for them cause mine were laptops and if desktops are bad i'm jumping in the brand
I fired ASUS years ago, they are trash.
My desk From Upliftdesk holds 800lbs with two industrial motors. Cost me $1000, and it is 72" long, so I can hold 3 monitors and one 48" TV that is sideways for Chats. Also, the desk has a Hammock so I can sleep underneath it when I raise it up high. The Desk I chose is made of Bamboo Wood because I chose to not buy anything from the Amazon Rain Forest.
The incident with the Asus Rx Vega cooling solution, where they botched and it never got out. Instead the gaslighted eveyone thinking it was user issue.
Im so glad that in Australia we have strong consumer protection laws. Even with that 'disclaimer' from ASUS about individuals "voiding" their warranty if they install a firmware update from THEMSELVES, they would still he held accountable.
Makes me worry about getting the ROG Ally handheld (by ASUS). I feel like preordering it isn't... wise.
Yeah just because they’ve had a shiny name don’t mean it can’t get dirty. No one has challenged them really so they think they are better than everyone
I’ve been saying the same thing about their shitty support and the fact you can get MULTIPLE DUDS IN A ROW FROM ASUS. Speaking from personal experience and friends experience. Yet they’re marketing/branding is arguably one of the strongest on the market. I highly commend you Jay and Team for speaking out about this. Hopefully other creators follow suit however I’m not too hopeful. Definitely going to be checking out the channel alot more ❤
Bought a $2000 auss 3080ti in 2021, had a bad fan after 3 months, asus refused to fix it but gave me a refurbed unit with lots of scratches on it. I also needed to pay to ship the bad unit back to their warehouse.
just don't buy from asus  simple as
wow
Let's not forget their latest issue... on May 15th, they pushed out a corrupt server config file to their routers that broke internet/network connectivity over WiFi to thousands of customers (even those that had automatic updates disabled.) Within 10 minutes of the router booting up with that config file: it would run out of memory, and CPU usage on a single core would be pegged at 100%. Most media outlets didn't see or notice it, but as tech support for an ISP that serves several states...we certainly noticed it with hundreds of calls, from all ASUS router owners saying their internet is down and thinking it's an outage... Nope, the fiber is fine. Your router isn't though...  ASUS quietly in the news section of their website released an apology and fixed the issue on their end. But they caused a global outage for all of their routers for a solid 2 days. This not long after the whole motherboard fiasco.. 🤦‍♂
Would share a recent story coming from a asus laptop  Last February 2023 out of curiosity i updated armoury crate to latest version believing it would increase performance. About a day later my 144hz refresh rate continouly died. I had no choice but to dial down to 120 hz refresh rate to have stability   Now going back to near present. This May 16, 2023.. out of curiosity i updated my armoury crate again to latest. Oh well that was the last thing i did when for some reason the stable 120 hz died too. Now i am going to test their warranty by servicing the laptop. This would be my deciding choice to have some consumer trust buying their products. Im hoping for the best
I've had 2 Asus mobo, and a Asus GPU fail on me within the past 3 years so I already avoided buy their products now
So what are you going to do with all that ASUS equipment?
What a royal fuck up. I was eyeing an ASUS mb for AM5, so glad I went with an MSI.
And this is why i stick to Intel. Yes its a little on the warmer side. but has great customer support and ive never had a major CPU failure. and ASus products have been nothing but a headache for me lately. Failing monitors, Motherboards that just randomly crap out. Graphic cards that have just quit working not even 3 days after purchase. I bought my first asus laptop in 2012. The HDD supplied died basically right when the warranty expired. When putting in a new HDD none of the laptops functions like the keyboard light, volume control, disabling the touch pad etc ever worked again cause i couldnt load in the default software and there was not a place i could download them. this is why i stick with MSI, Asrock, Corsair and EVGA.
OMG Z790 has ps2 mouse/keyboard connector. WHaaat?
I have been an ASUS user since I can remember...late 90s early 2000s. SAD to see them being like this. I think they are taking a stance like NVIDIA and won't move.
I have been down with ASRock since the AMD Athlon "Thunderbird" came out, how ever its alwaays been a amenities for the price range thing. My last ASRock how ever I was rather fine going with the X570 Taichi... And yes, they are a damn hard to make any sort of build theme out of unless your building around that look.
Usually Asus gives pretty good warranty and service. I tried claiming for warranty and it was easy to do. Now Apple on the other hand , is kinda hard and you will most likely get rejected and blamed. This is based on personal experience.
True...from my experience, ASUS isn't reliable. Thank you Jay!
I've bought a lot of Asus stuff over the years cause they always worked good and I never had any issues but if this is how they're going to behave I guess I'll have to stop
I just want to add to this, this video was released shortly before this occured, but on may 17th (2023) an automatic security update for newer asus routers (security updates can't be turned off btw), such as their AX89X router, had a bug in it that caused the router to hard crash every few hours. This was a bug related to AI security where a log file in RAM wasn't dumping it's contents and would get filled up until it overflowed and crashed the router. And it took 3 days for them to release a patch. This is just ridiculous!
Armory crate installed a network utility that kneecapped my network speeds from about 600-800mbps to 50-60mbps.  Not to mention a broken audio driver. The amount of old unstable crap that it tries to install is awful.
My AsRock build was the most solid build I have ever had, my Asus (Gene IV) was my worst. MSI and Gigabyte are tied for my second best overall.
I’ll know not to use asus
Wasn’t MSI having similar (ok, not that big, but still massive) kind of problems about a year or two ago? It surprises me they are the brand to go to now. Did they redeem themselves so fast?
How do u request product to test
I'm old as dirt, I've been building high-end systems since 1995. Over all, if I added up all the mobo problems, amd far out weighs Intel with problems. I stick with stability and avoid asus after having terrible support. For now, I use Super micro, MSI, Gigabyte, but have used other brands, ASROCK, even budget brands such as biostar with zero problems. Who has time for hassles? I don't.
OMG man i upgraded my pc ryzen 7700x with asus b650m motherboard. and first 1 month i got pain blue screens. And after i got MSI b650m   0 issues. !!!
Sucks. Asus used to he the top brand for conputer products but i guess that era is over. Been liking gigabyte stuff lately. May try building something with asrock soon
How low has Asus fallen.
This really sucks, my first own PC is asus (which I'm using now) the graphics card is outdated for the software I use. So as someone in the market switching over to a custom PC, I several of computer parts on my list were asus. That will be changing now.
Not gonna lie my OLD ASUS vivo book 14 laptop is still my main pc after all the upgrades and repairs after like 5 years but I tried to replace it with a newer version of ASUS ROG STRIX and this laptop was burnt out in less than a year something about the newer cooling system isnt right and when taking it apart the new pc was much dirtyer than a pc that was 4 years older it so this has to be a desine flaw. If I am going to recommend a laptop I can only recommend #1 HP or #2 a older model ASUS after years of taking apart computers they seem to be the most sturdy built and parts are readly available.
I have an ASUS 3090 with very loose and noisy fans, which is a problem other people have been reporting. And, idk about other GPUs, but for that one you have to get to fans by taking it apart from the back, so basically the whole thing. Not sure I want to risk messing it up so I guess I’ll do an RMA and wait 2 weeks…
So don’t buy an ally then? Lol
Never had an issue with Asus. Stuff happens.   Now DDR5. That’s where you should have dropped ram suppliers.
Loved asus for a long time. Had many of their monitors and other components and they worked great. I bought a new monitor in January and it’s pretty much unusable. Dead pixels, and screen flashing continuously. Very disappointed.
Respect!
Idk about this one. Asus usually is the one that has the highest level of quality and least issues at least in my experience.
Lol I had to RMA a socket 2011 board, back in the day. That's was due to the board being advertised with certain PCI-E support that turned out not to be true and then they quietly removed the statement from the specification page. I returned the board and guess what they said there were bent socket pins.... And wanted to charge me for the repair. Thank god I used insured postage, told Asus to get stuffed and just claimed the full cost of the board from the courier as they must have damaged it (I took a photo prior to sending) and bought a different brand. Haven't used them since.
It sounds like they had a bunch of poorly made products out there that they were liable to fix so the best way to get out of this responsibility would be to trap customers into voiding their warranty with a "beta" bios. Class action lawsuit?
I have a plus wifi II  Lucky that's a motherboard from when Asus was reliable
Currently in the process of getting some parts for my desktop build. Huge props to you and Steve for standing up for the consumer. As a current owner of an Asus laptop I'm definitely a fan boy of the brand however the way they are going about this situation is a huge slap in the face for the consumer.   Definitely would love to see a video of the motherboards that don't have these issues.
Fuck me. For real like I NEVER bought asus but for my last build I did. ASUS only!! Over 5000€ and after seeing how they are handling this I will never to again.
What about ASUS' Threadripper motherboards? I've not seen any talk about them. I presume they are OK? Threadrippers are WAY too expensive to see them going up in smoke!!!!
Right.  I quit buying ASUS products already 10 years ago (except one B350 mainboard) because i could sense their lack of consumer focus back then.  It becomes more important for youtube reviewers to reach out to the SHAREHOLDERS and inform them how ASUS is misbehaving in the world.  The management of ASUS obviously does not care about customers but they sure as hell care about what shareholders have to say.
Yo Jay, greetz vom Germany. I tell you what i do man. Same that i die with intel. I switched. Now i am rockin a nice ryzen and by the time i need a new board. Gues what, it wont be an Asus. Thanks for beeing so straight! I had a 144hz Monitor from asus a couple years ago and when i got it back from RMA it had another fault like no one tested it after fixing. Second time it came Back and didnt work at all. It was a complete joke...
asrock?
glad to see the over volting addressed, i initially thought that the 13th gen chips just ran high voltage from the factory, until i tinkered with overclocking and realized otherwise.   not glad to see how they treat their consumers.  first thing i noticed when i fired up this 13700k build was that the asus z790-e gaming mobo was shooting 1.45v-1.7v into the chip at the stock 5.3ghz clock. tinkering with a few settings; MCE off, core clock, voltage, XMP on, c-states off, and SA voltage, i managed to hit a comfortable OC; 5.5ghz at 1.296v. not the best or worst chip, i def lost the silicon lottery, but my overclock lowered voltage and temps significantly and squeezed out 200mhz of performance from the chip.
Done, not buying any ASUS products ever... til they get their act together.
Asus sux
I´m using a ASrock X570 Extreme 4 and it´s awesome. Used ASUS for two generations before and can´t really complain but you get more Value for your money with ASrock
Me…. sitting here staring at my asus x670e prime slightly concerned…. Lmao I just wanted all white lmao
since 2013* ist missing in the title
Is my Asus board possibly the reason Microsoft Flight Sim continues to crash?? I’d appreciate some help!
lol Anus
I don’t know about the rest of you but I do not pronounce it “asues”
Iight so not using ASUS anymore, got it.
My Asus motherboard has always been a bit of a nightmare tbh. Well said Jay.
you leach out every last bit of power accept failure in your experiments
all that glory you got on ASUS boards and bios throw that away as well you couldn't have done it without them
I wonder if these issues will find their way to the ROG Ally?
I'm with you!   I've been using ASUS motherboards for at least 20 years.   Last upgrade, the onboard video didn't work.  So, I "updated" the BIOS thinking it would clear up the problem.  As soon as I powered it up, it let the smoke out.  So, I couldn't get a new motherboard because I updated the BIOS!  stuck, I bought another similar ASUS (like a dope!) motherboard and again, the onboard video did not work.  I sure wasn't about to updated the BIOS again.  I put in a video card and it works fine.   No more ASUS for me until you say so, Jay!
Sad glad to see that this is making waves I have had issues with asus for years I was hoping it would just get better. But this will do.
i'll never buy another ASUS product ever again
Man,hats off to you sir,not many would and did what you just did
Are ROG laptops getting issues too?
Describe to this channel because you are here for the consumer
Theyre coming out with an oled monitor pretty soon I was thinking about getting. Now i have more to consider. Thank you
I've bought primarily EVGA but also _some_ Asus stuff over the last 5 years, but only used; they aint getting my money. Asus lost their way years ago. I've _used_ some Asrock stuff across 2 decades - they really fell down for a while, but it I agree that they seem both their hardand their attitude is doing quite well recently. I like what I see with Asrock, I hope they continue on this track.  Asus though... They can certainly come back if they actualiy really want to - IMO their issues seem to boil down to bad attitude. But its bad enough to affect not just their brand relations in practically all regions but their actual hardware and management too. So this is not an "a few bad apples" case, this is systemic. They can certainly chance that, but it might take a change in leadership just to make it possible. Leaders can change for the worse so they can change for the better, but doing so is incredibly difficult at that level while simultaneously remaining at the same post. It's hard administratively, personally, and it really shakes up the trust from sharegolders and perceived job security with upper middle management - people with a lot of collective reach and pull in this big a company.
I just bought a Crosshair X570 VIII Extreme based on a video from a year or so ago from you, I am going to run a 5950X, with a RTX4090 in a Corsair Icue7000x Case - should i be concerned now? The extreme board is obviously 800 bucks and before I install or even open it I need to know what to look for. It's also coming from China and I got it off NewEGG...i'm getting a bit nervous. Anybody feel free to comment or provide feedback if you have built something like this and or have had success or failures.
Asus Graphics Card division sitting there like 😎
I never bought a thermaltake product after you exposed them
I recently bought an asus laptop that keeps reseting back to bios and losing sound.  A complete lack of help on the help line and a refusal to send a new computer or refund after 8 hours on the phone.  I no longer would buy anything Asus even though it's been the go to brand for the last 15 years for me.
Very commendable
Literally just build an asus full build yesterday. 😢
"We grade brands on how they handle their problems".  Right on!! I hope ASUS gets their act together again.  I've had several good machines based on their motherboards.  Brand loyalty is hard to win and much harder to win back.  Ask Newegg about that.
Jay! You should look at the issue with AI mesh drop out which happened a few days ago globally! Unautherised (as in auto update turned off) firmware install knocked out Router and AI mesh extenders e.g. RP-ax56
A-men to that. Don't think I've got any Asus gear in my current build... Just as well, really.
you know, i never thought my motherboard would be the issue, and its not a new series either. but i consistently have things like my webcam, game capture etc crash like you mentioned. might be time to try a different mobo and see if my issues go away...
I had a Acer laptop i got at the start of college and it lasted like 9 years. Bought a Asus Rog laptop later and it was complete shyte. Doesnt sleep, touch pad/mic/included software doesnt work. Avoid everything they have
That's why in my country we call it Asuck
Well that’s just great to hear. I just ordered an ASUS Stike MB. Not even delivered yet. Are you saying I should expect trouble with it? Is it best to just return it? Are any other MB manufactures any better in quality?
Love your work Jay Asus was my go to for years Unfortunate that they have gone this way
Holy crap. When I put my newest system together I went through two motherboards, thought it was just a fluke and still have instability issues. Figured it's just my component combination, but I've tried two different combinations of RAM. Audio crackling, first system turn on of the day. A few minutes in all my USB devices quit working and I have to restart and then it's fine for the rest of the day. Pretty sure with everything that's going on it's an Asus problem. Might switch motherboards.
I thought it was only a me issue with Asus until all of this started to appear! My recent Ryzen builds with asus used to give me the same issues as you Jay, after replacing several components even the CPU, I still had issues. I waited one more month hoping they will resolve themselves with updates but I just decided to switch completely to MSI and had no issues since.  It's disappointing to see Asus neglect is quality.
thats why we miss evga so much  any how, if i ever said this line in @9:10, they said im racist lmao
Wtf I bought this motherboard Asus z790 prime WiFi before this video and I haven't test it yet. Hope there is no such problems. Have anybody test this motherboard?
Imagine being AMD and being behind Intel for decades, They finally make the ground they need and Asus shoots them in the foot! Pissed isn't the word!
Thank God I have not used an Asus mobo or product. I always used MSI or ASrock. My current build is MSI mobo, Gigabyte gpu and Coolermaster everything else
Everything I've ever bought or dealt with from Asus from wifi adapters to motherboards has been bad. My first issue with Asus was the X99 Rampage V Extreme board back in 2015. Board came dead on arrival on bios 1 and bios 2 worked but could never be updated as all updates would brick the board. I also had plenty of issues with parts i bought through newegg back in 2017, ended up going to their warehouse in city of industry and returning their crap to them.
Hey Jay, this video is regarding mobo but i want to share my experience regarding gpu: I build pc 2-3 months back & used ASUS's gpu 3060ti dual, it had some issues so went for DOA & after month they didn't had same model for replacement nor they knew when would they have stock of it & said there's different dual model but you have to pay extra for it or you can have refund.  My first time using an Asus product cause of the quality & brand name it has or had but after seeing this & other user's experience don't know what to say.....
My Asus ROG Centurion 7.1 headset broke down after a little more than a year and after warranty expiration. Same happened with my Asus TUF K3 keyboard which also has issues with LED and key contacts after more than a year of usage.
I used to be a asus user for a long time, and Jay is honestly right with everything he is talking about. And I guess I think I will take my business somewhere else.
Every Asus product I used over the last 5 years have failed. I got off them in 2020, never had issues since.
fired. hehe. nice one
I've never had an issue with Asus products
4th wall and 7th wall its really
Asus cards though.. but: The ROG software platform is intusive crud. Wrecks system performance.   Whereas my 3070 card works great now, since I dumped the ROG bs & most armour-crate related faf.  Would never touch an Asus motherboard. If youre going for an 'affordable' board then MSI is the way to go.  This recall remonds me of the whole transistors issues in PSUs 12 ish years ago, faulty ones installed bursting. If you wern't in the trade you didnt know about it, & 'they' would try charging replacement fees etc. Lucky for me though.. ..
The Voltage Problem was already there on x570 Boards and killed my R3600x back in the Days. i have to run my VCORE at - offsett to have my current 5800X3D under Heat control. Seeing that this is now even on the new generation makes me sad. And that they don't YET is obvious...but they will if igor comes along too and start trashing them nearly all good influencers have dropped Asus at this point and this will propagate throught the community.
Just redid my build thanks to a failed PSU nuking the mobo. Ended up going MSI and really glad I did.
This dude is out here complaining about boards that aren’t new when’s he’s getting them for free……. Ok one of them has bent pins, the other one has something that you didn’t even take the time to look at. Dude be salty he’s being treated like a pleb by them and not being sent the best and newest product.
this is how you keep fans. not blowing smoke up our asses
the monitor side is also not to bad for asus but this is really bad. I couldn't imagine a brand like msi that I trust to run all my cpu's doing some shit like this
Everyone who is wondering. I can back this up personally. I have used many companies over the years when building my computers.  I have had so many issues with Asus products. I bought a £600 GPU from them, within a month the fans started to fail. I had them repaired and constantly the fans would fail, bearings worn out.  Also it was overheating massively, compared to another I purchased that was the same card (980ti, this was a while back but still) but an MSi version.  I had the ASIC quality checked on my Asus GPU and it was a single point above QA failure.  After that I completely refuse to buy their stuff, on occasion their Motherboards have been okay but that's it. The motherboards I am speaking of were some from 8+ years ago, not used one since then.  Two companies who did the opposite of Aus for me were MSI and Kingston.  Especially Kingston. They are the champions of customer support imo.
A sus
i been wait for rma on asus 3060 since dec and i still dont have my card back
“You’re leaving a ton of performance on the table” proceeds to play golf with friends
Well i had a kind of same problems on Asus ROG CROSSHAIR VIII DARK HERO X570 Board with Ryzen 5900x and GSkill Trident Z Neo F4 CL14 Kit for 1 and 1/2 Year didnt OC and it was working fine and then suddenly from one day to another it just wasnt booting up anymore Boot Error Code 0d with yellow left LED was shown.. so i tought i had 6 Months of waranty left ..put both processor and board together send it back to Vendor with the request for help and testing these products and explaination of already done troubleshooting steps like RAM Swaps etc.. it just ended with both products sended back to me after 20 days and a paper wich told "sucessfull tested and no errors was found" the Vendor has send the Board during that ime to the Asus Company wich tested it and send it back with sucessfull Test result. I just build up my Rig and guess what Boot Error Code 0d.. after all and a few trys on Phonecalls without results .. i went to build a 13900k with ROG STRIX Z790-E GAMING WIFI.. after all its still runnning fine so far even its Asus again .. i dont know maybe Intel Sockets and chipsets do less trouble .. dont know
I have built computers off and on since 1995 and used ASUS motherboards. They all lasted a long time. If they are spiraling down who is a good motherboard manufacture to use. I need no build a new computer in two years.
As soon as you turned on your livestream you got an add as well!?  The timing on that, thanks youtube.
The good thing is that you make us aware of this problems. The bad thing is  that the people who make this stupid decisions(Marketing or what ever are they) will never look  at this video and  they will never listen to the engineers, they will push  and kill the brand.
This sucks to hear because before this I've had GREAT experiences from Asus products, no problems whatsoever! The z270 board I have is still going, fingers crossed now I guess...
Oh my God
Asus is a good brand.  It's your loss.
He can trash his sponsors because he is easily making 6 digit income from YouTube alone.. 1.3 million views on this video alone.  He loses nothing.  Probably asks for patreons too.
I gave up on ASUS two years ago.  I had 4 bad motherboards and my last laptop was junk.  2k junk... wont go back to them for a while.  I went with ALienware... and yes, its better than my ASUS box.
What was the other brand jay stoped from having on his channel?
Get on the Chopper!
Kind of miss seeing JJ showing up in random tech reviewers videos whenever they reviewed a product. Hopefully he moves onto a better company too
Never had a good experience with Asus besides an early Android Tablet and a M.2 Enclosure. Bad motherboard from them, bad laptop from them, bad windows tablet from them. Will not buy anything Asus again and was not even affected by this newest issue.
I always stood behind Asus for 20 some years... but 4 years ago I bought a Asus Flip 14. One month past warranty the hinges broke through the screen when opening it, because the hinges were so stiff. They would not cover it and said it was my fault. After happening to me lots of people were giving rally bad ratings on Amazon for the exact same issue. Asus was always super reliable and great products but this being the first time I had a huge issue they totally let me down and many other customers! Not impressed!
Ugh, was hoping for a Jay review on the Rog Ally 😢
anyone have the first x670e bios backed up anyplace wondering if i should revert mine back to stock.
Jay, the only thing i would have added was right at the end throwing one of the Asus products in the bin :)
It really stinks cause im literally just about to finish my x670e build in a corsair 1000d.
i been an rog fan all my life (27 now), i always liked of their brand looked, but all this "Screwing" you costumers and high horse, is going to their head, and all this about Quallity, isnt existing anymore, i can no longer say, asus rog is a strong solid quallity, cuz they dont give a f*** about the customers, if there is errors or if there is complains.  i thought i could trust you, but you keep breaking trust and dont own your own mistakes Sad to say goodbye asus,
What brands would you recommend besides asus, I'm looking to build a pc, and the motherboard is still a part I'm having trouble picking(for intel 13600k)
Looks like they are all Dueshbags at ASUS👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This is just depressing beyond belief. When I built my system 2 years ago in the middle of the pandemic, I swapped my MSI mobo for an Asus ROG because the former couldn't get the USB drop-outs under control. The Asus has been problem-free since. After repeated issues, years ago, I swore off Gigabyte. Who I had ironically switched to because of issues with Asus before that. We're talking 15+ years of building my own machines. Who the hell is left?! Supermicro I guess?
They used to use self installing Software!, I hope that they return to that format!,✨
They always put flawed products or ( uncertain ) products into the creators send shelves!, Lol'z, ( not always ) but You know what I mean!.so-sad,... I Luv ASUS Motherboards!,✨
Beta is an excellent format for quality if it is done right, but if one thing if wrong, it won't perform well at all...
İdiot, i bought a w790 sage se, seems fine... solid
lol i fired asus 15 years ago so .. welcome to the club :D
lol bought an asus x570 itx everytime my pc gets unplugged the bios resets it self
Wtf i just got a 400 dollar rog
So what motherboard co should be the goto for dependability?  In the 2022 brand video Jay said no to Gigabyte and MSI.  Now Asus.
Yes, I just had RMA problems with Asus, I wanted them to check my graphics card because my graphics card or my mainboard have a problem, but both are from Asus. Instead of helping me, they say the graphics card is dirty, you can throw it away and send it back instead of cleaning it a bit and checking it. I once had a really dirty beamer. I sent it to Acer and they cleaned it up and made it whole. Exactly, I once had a problem with my EVGA graphics card. It was also a bit dirty and they exchanged it because it had problems. Unfortunately, Asus is exactly the opposite of what they claim to stand for in terms of quality and service.
None of this surprises me to be honest. Like I said on a previous video of Jays. One of my rigs that I still use quite often, is a MSI Krait Gaming motherboard, paired with a Gigabyte Aorus 1080ti Extreme, Corsair 850HX psu, corsair 115i liquid cooler, i7 7700k, along with lots of other goodies. The thing has been rock solid since 2018 without missing a break for lunch. So, I know where my loyalty will be staying 👍
With me, personally, I stopped with ASUS when they pulled off the whole VRM Fiasco (2018 - advertised 8 phase, were actually 4's).   At the time, Gigabyte went from the WORST VRM's to the BEST VRN's on the market, and I've had nothing but fantastic experiences with Gigabyte's Intel Boards since.  Went with Gigabyte on the GPU as well..   not a problem at all. Currently Z590 UD AC w/i5-11600k (With a 512Gb M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD for $367.51).  Couldn't be happier with the features and the bang for the buck.   Paired with a RTX 3070 Aorus Master, I'm happy..   Gaming at 2k, don't need 1,244,120 fps..  Im quite content with a steady 70-80fps.
I had a couple of Asus devices about a decade ago. Swore I'd never touch the brand again - partially because I found support inadequate. Later, I found myself in need of a portable games machine, and a test run of a friend's Asus machine convinced me to change my mind. Happily, the question of support has yet to arise. But based on this latest news, looks as though I'll be back to square one with any future purchase.
I have a Asus Strix GTX 970, 2 years after purchasing it their GPU Tweak software was trying to kill the card. How? Their software worked well for the first 2 years, then it would keep the RAM clock speed max but the GPU clock speed low when idle. So the RAM would be cooking because the GPU core was not heating up and the fans were running slow. Removing their software and using MSI Afterburner, the card never had this problem again and still running.
They failed me 1 time 20 years ago. I never went back.
Thier quality was gone 20 years ago :) lol
Ive noticed a quaility drop in Asus boards as well. My 2008 Asus Sabertooth board was amazing everything worked nothing broke. That computer has worked fine since. My most recent build in 2020 was another Sabertooth board. But ive had multiple ports UsbC Usb, Main power, front header connections all come loose after only 6 months or less. had to resolder a bunch of ports back onto the board. Ill have to check out ASRock again. Or maybe an MSI board for my next build.
I'm rocking an Asrock B560 Pro4 since years. No issues whatsoever.
ASUS=Raluuuca
Well this is MY 2 cents :) I will no longer use Asus product also been in this Business since 1990s Was also buying top notch Asus product because yeah they look good and nice feature also BUT when I Invest 4000$ for a Pc I cannot afford that it broke for  negligence on checking the parts Software and Hardware , Still Using Asus for the Moment because i have a built for the 5800 and 6900Xt and when i Upgrade for AM5, it will be NO Asus in my built already removes all Asus software , Crate , Light and all ...Virtual pet WTF !? I cannot aford to be screwd !
I've used ASUS and have always been happy so far. Funny in the past I've experienced some of the issues with MSI rather than ASUS. Things have changed quite a bit since I built mine ~5 years ago
I am not bying another Asus.
WIth ASUS's issues in recent years, what brands would you/comment seciton recoommend? With the last 2 builds, I've had zero issues with ASUS, so it's disappointing to know that my go-to company has gone down the toilet. I remember people saying Gigabyte's quality is good, but their customer service sucks. MSI I've had one mobo from my very first build that I did have issue with, so haven't gone back since. Have they gotten better? It's just so weird feeling like I've got no brand to go to now since the last few years ASUS has shown its colors of not  caring about the consumer
This sucks.... Now where do I go to get a new MB? In fact, where do I go to get anything :( I don't trust any brand, as I generally have super bad experience with other brands
I think Jayz just broke the 4th wall (haha)
A somebody who watched Budlight get destroyed in a month ( a company i thought was unkilleable) a ASUS boycott can absolutely get the brand and punished accordingly.
A lot of companies in China are going down the tubes! I dont know when ASRock was the bad brand? I have been using them for the last 15 years and love them! In fact about 8 years ago I got a bad motherboard, called their support and they overnighted a board to me no questions asked and had me just put the bad board I bought in the box they sent me the new one in and sent it back and they paid for all shipping! That right there solidified that I was working with an awesome company and have never looked at any other MB since!
I bought my current ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition Motherboard from NewEgg when it was brand new with 0 reviews. Boy, was that a mistake. This mb is like a Walmart mb but apparently professional OC'ers sweared by it at the time (I guess the ones they sponsored). It won't let met overclock or under volt! Not the CPU, GPU, RAM. I can't do anything outside of the baseline on this board if I even tick something a cent over it quits on me.  And the first issue that arouse way before this was the first day I got it. The blue tooth did not work at all. It's supposed to be a wifi/bt combo antennae but I could never get it to work... that is until a few years ago I bought a PCIE wifi/bt antennae but the slot it takes up cuts off function for it's only M.2 slot so when I finally got that kinda of storage the mb doesn't even register it at all!  I hate this motherboard lol it sucks balls.  And to top it all off I tried contacting ASUS support but they did not care at all and gave me bs responses over and over playing the patience game with me.
The Moment you offcially put more Trust into ASRock than into ASUS is the Moment you know, you f'd up bad... I Hope Asus fixe that, would be sad if not...
I was an asus fan for many years, built 3 computers with their products. I went with MSI for my last build and glad I did now that I hear this. Keep up the great work and love your honesty.
the last thing i bought from ASUS was a mini itx mobo. There was a LED light mis-soldered to the board that made it short out and fucked up the entire mobo. Sent it in and they tried to say I tried to randomly solder this LED light onto the board and sent the thing back to me. Luckily the local store replaced it after they heard about everything even tho i didnt buy the stores warranty.
After having see this. I look at my 10+ year old Asus ROG laptop and wonder. did I get the cream of the crop? If it is so bad then how TF did mine last so long? And it is still the longest lasting Laptop/Computer I ever owned. Now I am not an Asus fanboy but sometimes you wonder.... Ya know? Now right now I do not use a laptop. I personally have not used a laptop for nearly 6 years. (The Asus in question is in possession of my S/O. No, we never did any type of maintenance of any kind at all to this laptop. And when we did, half a year ago. Literal dust bunnies blew out the fan port. No change in performance. Now I am not trying to defend Asus. I have a very much to each their own outlook.   Side note. I owned an MSI laptop. Which was originally going to replace the Asus. The MSI worked ONCE. ONCE. The Asus had Nvidia and Intel. The MSI had AMD. This is where after 6 attempts. And nearly $5k dollars and 6 laptops later from MSI, Acer, and 4 other brands. That we said screw it. We are now a Desktop only family. And have absolutely no problems at all. MY takeaway from all of this is Stay away from MSI, AMD, and laptops in general. EXCEPT for this one and only ASUS we ever owned.
Just ordered some parts for a new build and was scared to check my receipt to make sure it wasn't ASUS lol.  Went with Gigabyte thank god.  Love your channel and transparancy!
Have to say the same few years back I bought an ASUS gaming laptop cost me an arm and a leg and after a while poof it shit itself and no support or cover from them after 12 months the laptop was dead and left on the shelf I have never been more disappointed with a brand.
MSI it is.
Crap,i just bought z690 rog strix F motherboard.
i passsed on asus MB recently when trying to build a new comp, just way too expensive for what you get. something half the price is just as good and something is wrong with that.
Asus and gigabyte are my last choice for buying anything, and their motherboards are the worst , MSI i think makes better quality products than these two and it works better in most of the cases
my last mainboard have beein like this.. blue screen every 10th time i start up or so.. so rear that you dont rly see what the problem is... im looking forward to a video about what would be a good replacement for the future .:)
My gigabyte board caught on fire
Just a matter of time before a class action comes out for this issue. Honestly, always been pro asus for many many years, always purchased their products and laptops. This is severely disappointing ina brand I trusted for years, outside of Gigabyte.
Im glad i seen this i been debating between asus and msi for longevity and now ill just go msi thanks!!!
I have no problems with my Asus laptop besides the Asus Live update that NEVER works :) But happy to see you video, so I can buy something else the next time.
Ok, no more asus for me.
They are way to expensive and threat customers like dogshit.. asus should get a lession .. by customers stop paying astronomic prices. Let the asus products keep the dust in the stores and they will fix their issues
8:30 How do you need a microscope. There's something there in 3 different areas. Either it's 3 bent pins or something is there that shouldn't be.
I used to swear on ASUS using their motherboards 20+ years but this video answered on my similar strange experiences with them since year 2012 when BSODs, USB failures, voltage jumps and downs started to occur and reliability reduced. I thought its "me", drivers, or some other component issue and my enthusiastic hardware dedication gave me this particular answer as bad series - next time will be better... BUT even next generation(S) had this odd ups and downs giving me similar hard times. I work with 3D, animation and some demanding tasks and this luck of trust makes me quite anxious. I know its mobo because, same workloads works just fine with other brands I work on. I have nice memories with ASUS and wish then all the best but unfortunately, their pretty boxes will not help them.
Their costumer support has been brutally bad for uearst
Much respect to you jay
They also just sent out a broken patch for their Wi-Fi routers. For me it was so bad, Verizon had to reflash the Asus one was connected to
Sice Asus screwed me on RMA on my Z170 board i never buy any part from them...
I’ve been running an AsRock Z77 Extreme4 for ten years now and it’s been solid. It’s great to hear AsRock getting credit for being reliable, looks like I’ll be staying with them for my next build.
For years, the only PC parts that i trust most is MSI Both Gigabyte and Asus has been disappointed me for many years and i'm not their customer anymore ASRock not bad either but MSI is the best
This is exciting, I never had a non Asus motherboard since 2004. Looks like when i'm done with my Strix X570f ill be getting a non Asus setup. I'm actually excited. I never had a problem with an Asus board myself but that's besides the point. Nice job Asus, and thanks Jay for keeping us informed.
Got a new ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming Motherboard in November last year the top PCI-E slot has just stopped working no warning signs just stopped... I won't we getting ASUS ever again..... 7 months is not acceptable F ASUS.
i had a pre built and the 'power bricks' (dual) kept dying until eventually one killed my mobo. i was in full contact with asus 100 percent of the way and they wouldn't even help me once... other than a like to buy another.. they are a joke. i havent been able to afford a gaming pc since. lost all passion for gaming, sudden disability now... i hate my life. currently.
Legend.
Thanks for This.
ASUS stiffed me out from cashback deal, still no response from them and it's been almost 4 years.
I don't buy anything unless it's Corsair or MSI I've had more issues with Asus above anything else. I bought the Asus tuf 15 not even 2 months later both fans crapped out.... Yup nvr again.
Nobody using asus for like 10 years alteady
I've always loved asus's hardware but my God they're software support just getting the basic drivers updated for a motherboard that cost over $600 and they make the switch to MSI as well
👍🏻
you are a joke .so many people have problems with asus for years, what are you doing? Nothing. or just a lot of blah blah. then asus sends you 2 broken boards and you cry and fire the manufacturer? Yes, Asus is really aloof, but apparently you are too. do you really think you little youtube and twitch streamer matter for asus? who is arrogant here now?
Well done Jay! You and Steve are so right!   Unfortunately for them, it is Game Over. I will never use their products again.   Also, I have noticed too, that ASRock is indeed Rock Solid, as you said! Workhorse!, plug it in and let it run!  As also a system builder myself, my goal is to have all the people that trust me to serve them, feel safe.   If I don't feel safe, I will certainly not put the people that trust me at risk, just because some "brand" sits so high on their horse, that cannot see all their fuck-ups!   This thing applies for me, with resellers too. There are times that I have stopped business interactions with resellers, just because they acted like that.   Once more, Thank you for everything Jay! Keep up the Awesome Work! ❤✌🏼🙃
I am running an older ASUS it has been fine and did 2 ASUS builds for some that also running steady. There has been no issues with hardware or with the software. So my question is when did this start and what MB are the issues? These were both high rated MB's one a Ryzen 9 the other a Ryzen 7. I did both in 2020 and an MSI Ryzen build that is rocking away too. I only had  issues with older MB's that were use and abused over clocking beyond specs or a device connected causing voltage spike but nothing I could find from ASUS itself. It is interesting that this hits just a major hack of the Routers from ASUS worldwide just after being for hard/programming issues so bad the FTC stepped in. So what MB do we look too for AMD/Ryzen and up builds? I know people said work force MB builder outside the US is bad as lost a lot of their work force during 2019 to 2021. I see a lot of incompetency in getting you what asked as BIG issues as your relationship is some lost will hurt them as this will travel fast,
I had a similar experience regarding the rma, they just sent me a used broken board back so i went to the store which then stepped in and replaced it from their side with a new one
I regret buying a tuf gaming x670e now.... Its been six months and i regret that decision every fucking day...
i will go with ROG no matter what
That’s a shame. I always considered ASUS to be the most trustworthy brand in terms of quality and performance. The Maximus boards are my go-to and I’ve tried to get as many components from them as possible.   With the Maximus board issues and slow reaction, that was concerning. I think a repeated message of neglect is the last thing they should have been echoing right now.
Been using ASUS boards since the late 90s.... after seeing this, I don't think I'm going to be using them anymore.  Thanks for the heads up.
I'm just glad MSI boards are still good. Thank you tomahawk for not sucking. I have one asus board an old x570, it's fine I haven't updated the BIOS in 2 years that's probably why it's fine😂. But my wife's rig, my current rig and my brother's rig are all running some variation of MSI tomahawks. They still seem to be okay thank God.
I've been using an asus gaming laptop and boy has it been hell.. It's like they sell you a product matching the other competitors and once they're ready to release the next iteration, that previous product's dead to them. Terrible company.
It just seems like you're snivelling about you getting sent returns more than anything else. Sure, that's not cool.  I've been building and writing manuals for motherboards and cards since the beginning.  I've done customer service, repairs, the whole lot. I knew Asus when it was making crappy apple II drives and cards.  In fact, I knew all of them back when they were first beginning in the 8088 compat days.  We'd get crap all the time from all sorts back then. But, you're complaining about getting returns during a chip shortage, COVID and now pressure to reduce China's chip-making advances.  Waaa, it's all about me.  I got free stuff that wasn't pristine. Sure, it's a bad look.   But you (and the other guy) seem to be more put off because you're not special enough to get pristine, new stuff... while places that ACTUALLY sell the stuff are ahead of you. Again, MicroStar (MSI), diamond flower, ASUS, they all have a parallel history of sucking.  Now, we're stuck with what remains.  Back in the day, the 'off brand' boards were more reliable. If anything, you should be attacking their marketing department and advertising agencies, not the poor saps that try to put this stuff together in crap working conditions. Marketing is why we didn't have color TVs at the onset, VHS, and went from Vynil, to CDs, to streaming, Video disk to DVD.... but I digress.
classic bait and switch
Spot on. I’ve been an absolute ASUS fan boy since I started building PCs (that I learned from you, thanks!). Now I just don’t have the faith in the stability of the product, let alone the other issues raised, to confidently put it in a build because the people I build towers for, that’s going to be their PC for a very long time.   I’m looking at parts for an ITX build at the moment and the market is absolutely flooded with ASUS products.
Time to jump ship to gigabyte perhaps.
One of my favorite youtubers made a video about a year ago a out how he'd always gotten asus boards and literally all 5 of them had fried or failed so glad I dodged a bullet with the brand.
AMD next please!
ASUS ROG Support wanted me to ship my entire ROG desktop to them for the warranty repair of a noisy GPU fan; at my expense! I bought an equivalent MSI card to replace it instead of putting that cash into shipping then paying for them to 'repair' all the damage they would inevitably find when they received the desktop. Pretty shady policies. I feel sorry for anyone suckered into the ROG Ally; they are not your friends nor are they right to repair friendly. ASUS failure rate is too high and the support is not for customers, it's to protect ASUS from further expense.  edit: LOL, the BIOS update is one of the hoops they made me jump through, probably hoping I would brick it. ;) Didn't of course... it was done before he finished explaining that it was important not to turn it off, etc.; Scammers!  WTG Jay... now if we can only get Linus Media Group to see the light.
Well, I will keep this in mind next time I buy parts .
This channel is fired   That's simple
Harken, good folk! Lay thine eyes upon Jay... The champion favored by the masses! ⚔️
I was screwed with a faulty Asus mobo as early as 1995. Been avoiding their stuff since then.
Thank you, Jay for telling it like it is. I am getting ready to build a new computer and I think I know what parts I WON'T be using! Thanks again.
And I just bought a new Asus board because Jay said it was his go to.... 🫣  no blame, but bad timing
First EVGA no longer making graphics cards, and now ASUS going down the toilet...  Things just keep getting worse for PC gaming
just ordered a bunch of parts for a pc build i’m doing, i started to worry to see if i got a asus motherboard because i couldn’t remember. i got a gigabyte board.
You finally realised that No1 motherboard manufacturer is Micro-Star International❤❤❤
My old Z97-AR has been having all kinds of usb problems for the last 2 years, been waiting for prices to come down to rebuild. I guess I'm ditching ASUS, thanks for the info.
Great video. I would have loved to have seen who the best alternatives are. I've only had bad experience with Gigabyte, so who is left that is good?
Wow, 13k comments so far.  Anyway, I have been using MSI in all my builds since the 80's for both Intel and AMD and have never had a problem.  And they look good.  And the prices are reasonable.  I can't speak to other brands but I, personally, would never use ASUS.
Wow you have the balls of 14 hillbillies MAD Respect
Glad I saw this just before I hit buy on my cart. Goodbye ASUS 😢
The 35 euro's asus quadcore board i use here is still going  (knock on wood). Pc internet connection failed couple years ago though. Had to plug in something for that, otherwise, still a-okay.  Ps don't bash, just trash.
Ive always bought Asus everything I could since the 90s. My last mobo upgrade from z390 to z690, suffered from frequent blue screens and freezing which slowly improved with each bios update, but still happens on occasion. Definitely noticed a decline. My 4th gen asus mobo and amd fx mobo still going strong after constant use over the past 10 years.
Have you tried modifying the BIOS?
I only used Asus parts for a very long time. Until I had an issue with my b550i board not working with my 4090 FE. I read a lot of old threads where people who owns the same board was asking Asus to investigate the issue. No fix at the time of this writing. And then I saw a bunch of articles about auto overvolting the x3d chip when xmp is on.   To me, these are a lot of red flags. Switched to gigabyte for the new build.
Man I am just gonna hold onto my 2020 build until the tech industry stops being so shitty, seems like every month one more brand just becomes unreliable or skeezy. I don't even know what brands are trustworthy anymore at this point
I don't quite understand how releasing a bios with multiple warnings as an attempt to fix a problem is "anti consumer". If people are dumb enough to ignore the disclaimer, then they probably shouldn't even be building or working on their computers to begin with.   I've been using asus boards for nearly 20 years now for both my personal PC and systems i build for other people and I've never had one fail. But to be fair, i also use Intel chips because they don't have issues like AMD does.
Me who is slowly building a system and the first thing I got is the TUF Gaming board: 😶
I Still Rock with Asus but totally respect your opinion because you deal with these products daily. I just havent had any issues with their products of yet.
What a shame..  I used to like ASUS stuff.  I hope they get their act together.
this guy is lucky that people are so stupid and gullible. Hes capitalizing on the public opinion, nothing more. Go with the current, cash out.
I don't follow brand drama closely... but videos like this do make me want to avoid the associated brands. I'm certainly not unique, a video like this will probably cost ASUS millions.
I have always had issues with basically every ASUS product, their motherboards, video cards, routers, wireless gear, just sucks. Yeah they are cutting edge but they burn bright and burn out fast. They are well known for gear that is not meant to last. Their RMA process is to send bad equipment back to you. In some cases worse shape then when the motherboard was sent in. Just never, never ASUS any product. You do NOT get your monies worth.
Was considering to buy i9 13900k combo from Micro Center with Asus motherboard but thanks to that video i change my mind and I subscribed. Thank you Jay. What motherboard would be best with I9 13900k within price reason MSi Tomahawk maybe ?
And I wanted to build my new PC with ASUS Parts... I used MSI mostly so far but then they changed their light software so my RTX 2080 super just had its standart RGB flow in an all red system. Reinstalled the dragen Center multiple times, tried the MSI Center multiple times and it just didn't work. The old software wasn't available anymore. My X99 Goldlike Gaming Carbon mainboard still has its own software because it is too old so it worked still fine. I wasn't the only person with this problem and the rating for the msi center app did go downhill extremly. As well the software always would put my i7 6950x under 10% load in idle. Even after deinstalling it, the msi light saver still was running and keeped my CPU at atleast 10% load. Had to find and delete it manually. After about half a year they updated it and it worked again. But here it comes, the software needs to run all the time to keep the light you want or it will go back to the rainbow flow. The old separate mystic light software didn't need to run to keep your light. It doesn't sound like much but it maade me so angry that MSI had such bad software and support that I didn't wanted to use their parts again. Now EVGA left the GPU market and ASUS went to crap as well...
ASUS used to be my standardized motherboard throughout all of my and my family's computers. The fact that they began to think ahead of themselves, by being the top of the ladder of motherboards, shows their true nature. The company provide terrible product controls and employee managements. This is worth the drama. They need to feel what it is meant to be at the bottom of the chain once again. Making sure ASUS reflect themselves for their mistreatment to their employees and customers. If they fail to fix their mistakes and their ego, they will eventually lead to bankruptcy.
1:10 Great voice audio edit 😂
Holy shit so thats where all my problems come from i have the exact type of problems on both my pc and my GF pc, i thought it was an all AMD build problem, cause i never had this tipe of bugs using intel and Nvidia, but its true that both of us are using ASUS mobos... i've had a volume up and down bug for more than a year now, i thought i had a bad headset from hyper X too... it all comes to light now, last time im buying asus product... my gf has random blue screens
I have nothing but issues with ASUS. Used their products for over 12 years. Never looking back. Also, going back to intel. I need stability.
I always liked ASUS but this is scummy of them.
I have a z790 hero mobo with a i9 13th gen. Having no problems. Sometimes you just get unlucky lol
In 2007, I bought a brand new Geforce 8800 GTX. After 2 months of use, it overheated to death by exceeding the PCI-E powerdraw, damaging my motherboard in the process. I initiated an RMA. They sent a refurbished card. I never touched any of their products since then. They're greedy scammers.
My next build will likely be MSI or ASROCK. I've used ASUS products in my systems for years, but companies going into BS mode like that is a huge red flag to stay away.
Gigabyte got me last year, RMA'd my Aorus Master...they sent me back a board that look like it had been sprayed with something after a BIOS update cooked the board. Their customer service has been a nightmare for eons though.
Wow this is literally putting your money
im shopping for a new upgrade im going with 13900k and was going with asus bord until i saw this i have no issues with msi ima shop with them thanks jay
I chose to buy nothing from Asus since i bought Xonar U5 and they drivers never worked properly.
damn i love my g14
I had problems with my Asus B550-F Rog Strix and RX 5600 XT since launch back in 2020. Once I change out the mobo to a AsRock Extreme B550, I never had one BSOD, black screen or game crashing. I really do think Asus has lost the reliability of their PC parts they use to have.
honestly, I am not expecting any good support if anything happens to my Asus keyboard or GPU. I just don't trust that company and I am just crossing my fingers when buying stuff from them
Asus went from the mountain top to the basement floor in a few years.... sad to see. I remember the 1080ti launch no manufacturer could compare to their 1080ti oc version.
Ohhh!!!  @11:34  I also have some random audio/mic going out on my Strix X470-F, specially when streaming!  Then I have to change change the audio output to something else and back again, or reconnect the interface USB cable to make it work again.
This explains why AI overclocking presents stability issues crashing my PC while running 3D mark and Blender
Ive never had issues with AORUS Bords also i dont mind asrock either
I’ve always had great experience with Asus products. I don’t like MSI personally…
This blows. I've got 2 asus boards for am4 and love them both,  but moving forward, things like this are not something I'm willing to take chances on
Damn, the ROG Ally looked so good too.. Now I think I will have to give it a pass.
Holding up my hands here admitting I haven’t watched the whole video is this an issue cause by updates or a factory error with a physical issue with the boards I built and all ASUs rig not that long ago 4090 and z790 extreme to boot kind of worried about my rig had no issues but I don’t want to fry any of my damn components especially my 13900k
Every since the G15 and 14 was rehashed 3 years ago or so the quality control complaints kept steadily increasing. Fast forward to the AMD G14. I really wanted it, but at the same time still has a lot of quality issues. Loved ASUS. The only reason i switched was because a fan header on my 2019 M15 laptop had died. No voltage.   So glad to know i made the right choice being hesitant going back and will stick with MSI
I ditched asus product since 2006 after my first custom built desktop from scratch took a crap of just 5 years.  It was built with love and the reward was rather dissappointing on asus part.   My 2 nd and 3rd custom build using a different brand  was the best decision ever made by ditching all asus product from all of my build.
i am not sure that the statement from asus about voiding a warrantee and try to pass liability is enforceable. the argument will be made that THEY put out a product that was screwed and then THEY put out an alleged fix that was unfinished, untested, and didn't fix the problem because of it that they are clearly liable. if the bios update wasn't finished and wasn't tested the it never should have been released with the claim it would fix a problem at the cost of consumers.
1:12 LOL. Should have done more of a mayor quimby voice on that edit!
Have to pull asus down to the ground and let them climb again because we love asus
Not sure if this is Asus though. I mean I'm having weird issues with my older AMD cup + gpu combos...
Do I  have to worry, I have two Sage WRX80e   -  just be careful with updating  the BIOS??
Just did a build using the TUF WIFI6 plus  board paired with Intel’s 11th gen i5 And the issues are just continuing to add up.   From blue screen, random freezing, one of two monitors not detected to the built in LEDs flickering when powered off.  I notice new issues occur when the system is powered off for an extended period of time.   ASUS was my favorite brand as my 2015 build is still running strong. I’m sad to say it but, Currently looking to switch to a different brand.
I'm planning to build a PC Master Race and I always liked Asus/ROG brand but with thanks to guys like Jay, Gamers Nexus, etc...now we know how this brand works and for my new build I'll go for Gigabyte, Asrock, Msi. Thanks for the honesty.
Disagreed
good alternative B650 boards?
The integrity of this community's pillars is incredible, couldn't name another like this. TY
So no Asus, no Gigabyte / aorus, etc… (same company) and EVGA sucks… so wtf are we supposed to use???
Sounds like Asus fired you.
I just bought a ROG b760g and its already shipped... then I saw this...  welp... can't cancel it at this point lol, I think I might settle with that, hope it's good~
This is some Karen level overreaction and drama.
isn't Asrock a company spun off from Asus? and I'm pretty sure they are owned by Pegatron which largest shareholder is Asus. Pegatron also was a spin off company from Asus's structure as well. I'm pretty sure asrock was intended to be a "shittier" brand motherboard to hype up Asus's mainstream motherboard brands. I'm not 100% sure as I haven't kept up with it in some time, but anyway it surprises me the asrock board has zero issues when its inadvertently an intentional crappy Asus board.  btw- I had a white ASUS z590-E-gaming wireless motherboard from Asus and nothing but problems same as what you say about ram instability and always random shut offs only when actual game play would launch but never in menu or doing any other tasks. Then with that motherboard one of the times the game shut off right as it was done loading into game, it was that my strix 3070 had completely crapped out and turned into a very expensive paperweight, when I RMA it they didn't send me the same model back but the LHR version that had just been released which is not what I wanted and they literally ignored my request not to replace my gpu with a LHR one. I know it's stupid when for gaming it doesn't make a difference, but you know what I am paying a ridiculous amount of money more for their product I believe I earn my right to be picky with what I want from them especially when it's their product that is failing me. I currently have a maximus hero xiii and before the latest bio and firmware updates back in December, if I'm remembering correctly, did have some instability issues, and always have connection issues with wireless, and even wired peripherals. For the longest time would not even recognize either of its own ethernet Lan ports no matter how many updates to driver or rollbacks were made and was forced to run a wireless connection and after bios update finally fixed it with still random internet connectivity issues here and there. I have always been a through and through Strix supporter and it is disappointing with all of the patronage given to Asus and faith in them to back what you think you're paying extra for to have better equipment and in reality, you're paying more to have all the issues you wouldn't if you went with damn near any other brand now of days. Work too hard for my money to be spending it on faulty gear that is met with mockery for customer service.
WoW, this is MASSIVE.  Chants " TAKE UM DOWN, TAKE UM DOWN " Lets bankrupt um !!!!
What's funny to me is I quit using ASUS main boards 10 years ago as I had the same issues with their boards.  ASUS has had bios, bad capacitor, and I had one with a screwed up south bridge that was had me confused for weeks before figuring out the issue.  It was just a waste of my time and I quit using their mainboards.   Now I do have Stryx gtx 1080 that I'm still rocking.  It has been a good video card all these years, but knowing it's time to upgrade I am not going with anything Asus simply because Stryx is such a pain in the ass GUI that I never really got to work properly and just gets on my nerves.   I decided to finally build a new system and I'm going with all Gigabyte, I have had Gigabyte boards in the past and all have been solid, so I'm going with B650 Rtx 4070 upgrade.  I'm not rich so I got to go with what I feel will be the best chance of working without problems for what my budget can handle.
ASUS gaming laptop also have QC issues. Last gen it was the card reader and this gen the screen
Oof, and from what Ive read, the other one starting with A, (Acer) exhibits all the same problems.
Respect 🙏🏽
The accountants must have got control of the company.  If they want to protect their brand they need to do the things that made the brand strong:  make quality products and support them to the hilt.
But that Asus ROG Ally rox lol
Narrator did Asus hurt your feelings?
I have always liked ASUS as a brand. I hope they turn this around.
I had an ASUS motherboard many moons ago but within a year i blew up along with the graphics card. so I'm done with desktops.
Like everything today it's made cheaply, cars, electronics, everything. That's why I'm super satisfied with my Dell E5570 i5, superb laptop, the FHD screen is far better than any modern new 1000 dollar laptop, the quality of materials etc, and I got the thing for about 400 bucks with 1 year warranty
Asrock is a branch off  of asus
I was once a ROG fan... Till I felt disrespected by ASUS; and it wasn't even a mainstream problem that beat me up. It was simply a no service issue from their warranty department followed by a weak apology after costing me time and money to do ASUS's job. Sure, every brand has their flaws; but I have never felt pissed on as bad as what NO SERVICE ASUS had so e to me.
Yeah i've had several issues with Asus since Crosshair II motherboard.  I bought my daughter a ROG laptop for college and it has always been a thermal throttle POS.  I'm glad to not use their products anymore.
I know how their support works and it sucks. Too bad for rep being the frontliner on angry customer
I had bought a gaming laptop from them a few years ago. The motherboard crashed within a year. I paid to have it replaced and that didn't even last 3 months. ASUS was useless when I called about the warranty saying it was my fault and they would not help at all. I have dumped them since then and make sure to let everyone I know that  their products and customer support are horrible.
Omg. So i got the x670e crosshair extreme and the ryzen 9 7950x3d processor.... is it no good and wont work???????
My first Strix z790-E showed up with smashed pins... I RMA'd it through Newegg and got another one. Replacement wont run my memory on XMP stable. I upgraded to the 0904 bios but I can only get 7200mhz stable instead of XMP at 7800mhz. So far i'm pretty unimpressed with the quality compared to my previous Maximus IX Formula, which was much cheaper and had more options.
So asus is a no go.. guess i go with gigabyte?
This issue only affects AMD based ASUS motherboards, not Intel.
evga should do mainboards again
Loved ASUS but switched to MSI and will check out others..
ASUS Armoury Crate is spyware. It installs around 12-14 processes in Windows and it is impossible to uninstall. You have to manually hunt every one of them. I am never buying another ASUS product. Hardware is great, but their software is horrible.
I have had nothing but problems with my ASUS motherboard with the 7950x hoping people see this video and don't waste the money. THANK YOU Jay for keeping it real man
I'm not someone that comments often or really at all. I just wanted to say thank you for picking and choosing your battles and taking a stand.   My last build was all ASUS. My current build has a MSI GPU. Any upgrades I make to this system will make it a trend to move away from the ASUS/ROG/TUF brands.
I’m so glad you made this video… I’ve been dealing with an RMA for over a year now for an Asus graphics card.  I bought a Matrix 2080 ti when it came out, which had overheating issues after only a year of ownership (no overclocking). The replacement matrix 2080 ti did the same thing after a year, and the company sent me back a Strix 3080 because their repair facility “didn’t have a thermal pad to fix my unit” without even telling me they were doing it.  I’ve since been sent numerous replacements (all damaged refurbished units), been wrongfully charged over $2,000 on two separate advance RMA’s, and have currently been without a graphics card in my system for 6 weeks after being told I’d have a new in box Strix 3090 expedited upon receipt of the last defective unit I had.  I’ve been through 7 graphics cards, and still don’t have anything. Not only has this whole process caused me stress, aggravation, time and money, but it completely revoked any confidence I had in the brand.
Hah, I remember everyone pronouncing the brand ASSrock because the boards were just that - ASS.  And ASUS was ROCK SOLID.  Oh how the times have changed.
You will be back on Asus in 6 months after they sweeten the deal up for you.
Totally agree.  I’ve had so many issues, my most recent being with the Z690 Formula VRM waterblock issue.  They told me they’d have a replacement in 16 weeks - crazy long but ok - well it’s past 16 weeks, and nothing.  I saw one guy was offered a Cheaper board as replacement. I have invested literally tens of thousands in ASUS over the years.  DONE.
I love your closing message to Asus. Honesty and truth above all else.
Since yesterday, my girlfriend's PC (Asus ROG STRIX B550-A Gaming Motherboard in white) has stopped working. She turned it off, and the next day when she tried to turn it on, there was only a black screen. NOTHING, no BIOS or anything else. RAM sticks are functioning (tested), all cables are connected, and I even removed the graphics card. Nothing is working. Even a CMOS reset, nothing works anymore!!! On Monday, a different motherboard is arriving, and if the issue is with the current ASUS motherboard, ASUS is dead to me.  CPU and PSU are working fine. idk anymore...
I think the problems you had on stream could have been AMD related as I have a full AMD system without a single asus part and I have a lot of issues like that and games crash very often, but that is still very messed up how many parts they sent broken and all the bios issues.
I started to build like three desktop PCs in the past, one of them was the main rig which is with Asus motherboard, it was Rampage IV Extreme [RIVE] with Asus Geforce GTX Titan, it was and still available a great desktop, but that was in the past, after that i didn't look at any more of Asus or similar [Gigabyte, MSI,...etc], i went with laptops and recently by end/late of last year i bought Mini PCs, so i am not going to build any desktop except one for my hobby [not gaming] and done with it for more years to come, so i can wait before i build one to see what new things will be out before i regret it.
It's so sad… I have a B450M TUF gaming but I'm going Apple+console 😅I mean, I do more work than gaming and an Xbox will do me good and for work actually a mac will do way better than a comparable PC which I'd have to spec and buy so much unnecessary stuff that I don't even wanna try it…  It's weird times for sure 😅
Jay, if you want, you can send me all those asus boards if you dont want them anymore!
Ooo poor you, getting free PC parts for a living is so tough! lol
This is sad... I've been an Asus fan and have been buying their laptops ever since 2010. Guess I will look into other manufacturers that don't do stuff like this
Any information on how the Leak of MSI UEFI signing keys will affect MSI boards?
Nice
Just read about mass outages of ASUS routers ... with a half-ass response by them. Yea ... ASUS is out!!!
i absolutely LOVE when people side with the people. thank you so much. big respect. fk asus.
ASROCK AF!  I am running a board I paid !!!!!!$70!!!!!!! for in 2018.  Originally had a 2600X, RX 590, 16 GB of 3200 RAM at normal OC clocks/voltages.  SAME board, now holding up a 5800X3D, RTX 3070, 32 GB 3600 RAM with even tighter timings, like Atlas holding up the world.  Could you even begin to imagine paying $70 for ANY board these days let alone a board that can hold up to that kind of upgrade years and years later?  With stable BIOS updates?  Nope, neither can I.
I bought ASRock for several budget builds for friends and they've had no issues to this day. I'm sitting here looking at my Dark Hero wondering when it'll fail.
Been with MSI for a few Gens now and I haven't any complaints.
Ya asus did me dirty on the asus 750ti card and I'll never buy another asus anything ever again. So I bought the card installed it turn the computer on and matrix lines down the screen. Granted I just bought the card and it just came in. So I call asus and they say no sorry it was a returned video card it's already been registered and we won't honor the warenty. I call Newegg. Nope go see asus. Now the fun begins. 3 yrs of emailing them to fix it and finally after the warrent is void I get the call. Sorry about what happened so how can we fix the error. Oh wait the warenty is over sorry. Screw u asus.
Man I was considering Asus Am5 motherboard until this video, so thank you Jayz for reconsider my option to either Gigabyte, MSI, or ASrock wifi model. Asus should listen to their customers, but instead they are blind in greed that they don't care, and soon someone will take legal action against them for their negligence.
All these videos I'm seeing about this makes me worried as I just recently built my PC with a X670E board and a 7800X3D CPU. Really hoping nothing happens with it.
after watching this it makes glad I haven’t bought an asus board yet, does problems also exist for the b series boards?
i worked for ASUS back in mid 2000's  - as a sales/marketing lead for my region - i totally agree things are very wrong with this company , work culture and ethic aside, the whole idea of being "premium" over other bands (even when other is superior in tech) is just ridiculous - ego is way beyond their heads. In their global training for employees @ HQ in Taipei , they stressed everyone to read "Art of War" by Sun Tzu and thats about it. It was weird cause we had a test in the end asking questions from the book- as per them this book is Sales n Marketing 101. Even in official emails they use all this philosophical BS e.g. when we wanted to change our distributor , this was what was asked from management to replace and find a new distributor " Our work is like a caterpillar, if one leg breaks then we replace it with the other" lol ok that came out wrong but yeah you get the drift. AsRock was initially ASUS, they were one company - but I guess they parted ways later. "The weakest link is always a matter of oceans and waves... microwave"
For how much you have to pay for these ridiculous boards. They should honor their warranty, this is all on them. And not taking accountability or having the integrity to honor their warranty. I'm done with ASUS. All I have in my builds is all ASUS too, so it's not just a few bucks for one part. No it's an entire build that wont be happening in the future because of this.   Glad we have people like you who call out companies when they are doing shady things.
What Asus did its just small bump compared to what apple has done related to costumer and right to repair.
Wow. I havent been in the loop for a few years, and its wild how asus has fallen
It's a dark day when someone thinks that MSI is quality and ASUS is not.
Not used anything made by Asus for a good 10 years now, their stuff is sub standard.
Do these issues happen with  Intel Mobos?
thanks Dude! im a long term Asus customer but honestly its disappointing to see this clear lack of support regards these faulty Asus mobos...
I was planning to build a pc soon so should I not get the Asus ROG STRIX Z590-A?
The same thing happened to me with MSI and I discovered that they do not really have official entities in the world for guarantees. Only third party services which handled the products without solutions. I ended up sending everything to an office in California, USA in which they did not recognize the guarantees on two occasions. MSI from 2002 (KT4-Ultra) to 2018 (Phantom) has been my favorite brand by excellence. I never will buy or recommend MSI!
thanks for caring about your fans instead of the money, i subbed.
Personally I have never cared for Asus. Ive used Asrock for the longest and I have NEVER had an issue.
I had Asus motherboard and it died together killing the cpu (psu was not faulty) after half of year, but it got replaced to another model with additional pay for price difference.
asus  =cheap ass laptops  ib the un the keys bounce if u use em level bad
What alternative good brand for motherboard?
Happened to me, $700 motherboard, now a $700 dollar paper weight, but hey I get to keep the stickers :)
Yeah, I used to SWEAR by ASUS motherboards...no longer.
Lol, I worked for asus years ago. Back then it really was a good brand. Software could have been better, but the hardware quality was good. I had been using an x99 motherboard that I bought through an employee sale, until recently Rock solid, no issues. Then recently I bought a z690 A prime through a retailer and had nothing but issues with it. LAN not working until i unplugged and replugged the cable, sound issues, USB issues. It was terrible. Luckily I was able to return it and swap it for an MSI Z790 A pro wifi and that worked effortlessly straight out of the box. From everything I have seen over the last few years asus has been going backwards ever since i left. (not that I had anything to do with the quality as an office clerk)
Most of my experience with Asus products have been bad, yeah some examples have mostly worked, but many not at all, mainly because of terrible software or Bios/Firmware. it actually looked like they went better for a bit of time in the 4:th gen computers but then just down the drain again after that. The only Asus mainboard I use ( Sabertooth Mark2 Z97 ) have always had this strange intermittent freezing issue during bootup where it just gonna stand and do nothing for several minutes before it continues as if nothing happened, nothing have fixed this but it never changed either. But for some reason every Asus product I owned/tested/worked on have had some kind of minor or major problem with it. this just confirm my thoughts that it won´t change soon
FOIA?  FOIA, Freedom of Information Act, controls how the government releases information.
Good for you, I hate Asus so much, I had an RMA problem with them that has been on going since October of last year. I had to threaten to sue them for them to resolve my case. They lost my PC and tried putting the blame on me like I lost my own PC. They are finally paying me back my full amount I paid for that shit pc. Never again will I buy another Asus product they don’t give a shit about the customer.
Storry: i needed micro itx AM4 DDR4 Mainboard...  the asus Mainboard had manny errors and was verry unstable and finally it killed itself (good luckly it dosnt kill my other hardware :D and the fast amazon retoure of it ). I tried an MSI Mainboard it worked a little bit better... but still not stable... (at least it does not kill itself) And the first time i tryed asrock... IT WAS SO STABLE!... on the first time without any updates :(  At least my asus rtx 3070ti works stable :D  i liked asus really but this is not good anymore... so mutch costs... errors... and kills i rally liked Nvidea to but now its just the monnnnnyyyy... i do not know when my PC dies of age, what to buy anymore...  I even dont like where the pc market is leading its way :( Consoles like PS5 is so mutch cheaper and less proplematic today.  for me the PC market is frozen. We do not need any more Useless Upgrades like a 4000 GPU, for a game like Minecraft or Stardew valley :D Most games ive played do not have much energy consumption. GPU is always like 20-50% | CPU (ryzen 5900x) 10-20% (40% on FHD Stream by CPU)
bye bye ASUS!
Hi.. I am from India..  I purchased Asus Zenith Extreme Alpha, Tr 2990 WX and GSkill Trident Z RGB CL14 Quad channel Kit.. After such a huge investment since the day 1 this Asus MoBo posts one or the other ERROR Code.. Seller washed off his hands.. No repair centre from Asus.. Their response to the product .. F**k..
Not just Asus, Nvidia should be receiving same treatment too
Been an Intel boy through and through <3
Pre rgb PC gaming era was better
ASUS was interesting for a time, but they've always had terrible software. I went to EVGA motherboards and never looked back. Very annoyed with the EVGA GPU thing, but I get it. Something I've seen periodically is the new alarming trend of narcissism in corporations, people who are operating under this strange form of psychopathy end up in positions where they make decisions based solely on who in the organization is opposed to them or agrees with them instead of objectively what serves the customer and the organization best. Weird times we live in.
Thank you for standing with those who have already been harmed by ASUS
Good on you and steve both for calling out these horrible practices.
Criminal lawsuit
Wow. Glad i didnt get an Asus motherboard for my black friday build!
Gigabyte For The Win!!!
I've had nothing but issues from Asus motherboards the last three years. Been mostly Bios related BS that would completely upend the reliability of the board--notably causing random restarts or inability to turn the system on if it had been powered off for more than like half an hour. It was a major issue with the X570 Dark Hero board.  Oh and if change the LED settings in the BIOS the board starts acting all crazy.  Nothing like a $500 motherboard not working correctly. And then some other boards I tried as a replacement have been all over the place.
was obvious this guy would jump on the band wagon...always go where the wind of public opinion blows....
This is why I’ve never used Asus products 😂
So many people love ASUS. But I have had nothing but problems. I always have to replace them with something else. I gave them one last chance with my most recent build. And of course, I replaced it with a AORUS.
When you accept and review their RTX 5090, I'll bring this video back...
My last build was supposed to use ASUS. WAS.  I had a Threadripper CPU. ASUS cheaped out and used the Foxconn mounts instead of the Lotes mounts. Three separate motherboards. All out of spec in different ways, all of which prevented mounting the CPU.  AMD didn't care. ASUS told me I could pay to ship the motherboard in so they could repair it. I would have to pay for them to repair their own defect.  Until that point, I'd been using AMD products for the past 15 years. Now I've gone to Intel and NVIDIA devices with Gigabyte getting my first attention for motherboards.
Must be nice to get $1k mobo's & $2k GPUs for free and then drop the provider...
thanks for the heads up on the current quality of Asus, was almost gonna spend quite a bit on a new motherboard. looking at an Asrock board now instead. I've been happy enough with my asus board from about 4-5 years ago, sad to see that they've slipped that much.
Lol when your (ex) sponsor stops returning your calls and you say to your friends  "No, I broke up with them!"
I will never buy a Asus product again…
itl's like the guy with the golden goose that laid gold eggs, he gets ONE egg and then... want's roast goose... not a good business plan.
Look Jay, you'll be back as soon as they send you some more unicorn GPUS or motherboards...
this is not good what ASUS is doing. But talking about them having these issues I have something similar to do with audio recently which I do not get at all. This is board I have now PRIME BE60 PLUS. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
I can echo all of this. I really wanted to like my Zephyrus.  I really tried. But from day one, the thing would crash every single day for no good reason about some issue with USB. I wasn't even unplugging or plugging things back in, I was just leaving things as they were and instability would just jump right out of nowhere. Gave that laptop two years before abandoning my sunk cost.  However my Lenovo Legion has an understandable support model behind it, the warranty for 3 years was pretty cheap, and it works infinitely more stable than my ASUS ever did. Which is a shame, cuz their motherboards used to be awesome.
my Asus PRIME B760M-A D4 is already on its way to me. Might be a stupid question, but am I safe?
That's really bizarre. I've had nothing but solid results on my two previous ASUS mainboard builds, and both those lasted a decade. We come to 2023, and they pull *stuff* like this?  Good thing my latest build was a Gigabyte.  Bye Felicia. Don't let the door hit you in the ASUS on the way out.
They keep the best parts for reviewers, imagine if you're a regular customer. It's really unfortunate, I have been using an Asus Tuf motherboard and it's been working great.
I had three go to’s when I build my pc’s.  AMD, EVGA and ASUS.  I upgraded my system a few years back that I still use.  AMD Ryzen 9 3900x, ASUS Tuf Gaming X570 plus Wi-Fi and an EVGA 1080 ti, which was recently replaced with an ASUS GTX 4090, because EVGA has left the graphics card field.  I always use these three brands until now.  I watched Steve’ video yesterday and yours just now.  I just could not believe what I was hearing!   Until ASUS gets their heads out of their collective asses, they have lost another customer.  The sad thing is, when they start feeling it in their bottom line, they will not understand why.  I will continue to watch your videos as always and look forward to your opinions on the future best brand of motherboards and graphics cards.  I just wish that EVGA hadn’t stopped video cards.   Thank you for what you do and keep up the great work!
So glad I've stuck with MSI.  Their BIOS support and in particular, for the X3D chips, has been great.  Not a huge fan of their software but hardware has never failed me.
Another solid video from Raxx, much appreciated.
Absolutely right .
Never used asus but hear theyre top of the line. I use gigabyte
EVGA and now ASUS what is going on with the world.
ASUS is based out of Taiwan.  If you know anything at all about the ongoing "we could be in a war any second" conditions there... the decline in product quality kinda makes a lot of sense.  Soon as the threat of a war isn't clouding Taiwan I think ASUS might be able to pull their quality back to their own standards.
so sad to hear asus fall down s low. mine 7 years build whit  asus still running rock solid. Latest build 12 year ago was msi b550 . rock solid too. so i think next one gonna be msi again, and avoiding asus in all kind of hardware, boycotting whit mine friends too. to do this shit to paying customers is just a scam.
Sounds like Abit back in the day. Was the best and most high tech Motherboards the it got bad
Man I was thinking of getting a display for gaming/ digital art, but now I'm nervous to put my student paycheck towards any Asus product. I've been mostly happy with my ROG Laptop, except for the 1 year warranty...
As an Asus customer, I’m out, no more money from me.
I think its quite sad because imo they have really cool looking products for custom pcs, but I have also stopped buying their products. Still use my strix 1070 tho, its still a good card.
Asus  is unfortunately Cheap Chinese products
this whole video could have beed an oldschool SMS: baby Jay is crying because he demanded brand new free asus boards for his business and didnt get what he wanted, thats why he does not want to work with asus anymore.
damn that's exactly my problem with my asus. disconnecting usb stuff and a lot of other wierd things, i thought im stupid
I have owned 3 Asus laptops. A rog Zephyrus M14 and their hinges were so weak it broke, frying the panel in the process. An Asus Zenbook Duo had a weak keyboard I have broke. And a rog flow x16 with terrible software support (drivers need to be reinstalled after updates) and sometimes the fan never kicks in.
It sounds to me that  the biggest issue you have with Asus is contract renewal
Like so many companies...once they grow and get a stronger grip on the industry, more shit slips between the fingers.  Where have I heard that before?
I have been building PC’s for years, using many motherboard brands and I have to say that Asrock motherboards have been great quality products.
Asus is big and they have been around for years. This guy crying won't do anything and I would put money on it this guy will be back on asus products withing six months to a year.
I always thought that ASus and ASRock where kinda the same company, glad to know they're different
Can I have some of your Asus hardware lol? I dont have a gaming pc and could use some handouts!
I know no company is perfect but I'm a Gigabyte lad al the way! (Except for PSUs...When did they get into that? o.O)
When he starts talking about issues with ASUS motherboards whilst having a stack of boxes of my exact motherboard on his desk... 🫠
im so glad im not working at micro center since I can taste and feel the headaches coming in
I'll stick with the ROG Strix Z490 I have, but definitely will be moving away from ASUS with my next build
I've never had a problem with AMD it's all I've ever used never had an intel build it has to be ASUS though I've never used AMD's new chips with their new boards the only ASUS products I've used have been a gpu and a power supply they both still work great even though I've upgraded my gpu and don't use their brand of gpu at the moment I still have it a 2060 strix the PSU is the 850 Thor got it for christmas as a gift on a GREAT sale and have never had a problem I personally have enjoyed their gpu's because I've never seen a gpu stay as cool as a strix does I never had to make a fan profile for the card just plug and play stayed cool and quiet even at full load with a slight overclock the gpu I have now runs hotter even with a custom tuned fan curve though it makes sense considering it's a 6950xt also funnily enough it's an AsRock one the OC Formula and AsRock doesn't seem like one of the top main PC part providers form what I know but I've had no problems a little coil whine here and there but that seems to have gone away just my experience but I've never used an ASUS motherboard but I will for sure be weary of their products for now.
Considering my cpu aio died and i tried to get a replacement from them, no response or been transferred to almost every corner of their division, I agree with this decision. If anyone has a good idea on aio i can use instead of their ryujin 2 aio  Edit: i have had this aio since november of last year not a full year and the pump failed
I trusted ASUS in the past but more and more I am seeing negative reviews of their motherboards and other hardware causing strange issues, having bizarre behaviors or just outright failing out of the box. I considered an ASUS board for a new build because it had good customer and tech reviews but a lot of their stuff isn't enjoying that.
If your rep knows your influence they probably started applying for other jobs the minute she got that second phone call😂
Man… I got an asus mother board and an asus 4090… now I’m scared.
I cant lie, i have been PC gaming and building for 20 plus years, i have used both ASUS branded GPU's and Motherboards for as long as i can remember and never had one single issue, i dont even think i have ever had to RMA a ASUS product i have bought, my current board, the ROG STRIX B550-E GAMING that i bought sometime last year has also been rock solid.
Anyone recommends a good brand for motherboards ? I guess no more Asus
Should one be worried if your pc have Asus Motherboard? going forward?  I had my pc prebuilt this year
Funny enough, I just upgraded my RAM last week. PC had a shit fit and stopped booting. I have a  Asus RoG Strix Z390-F Gaming Motherboard. All I change was the memory after making sure it was supported. Ended up having to reinstall window, lost loads of stuff. Still having the odd issue and have had to remove 2 of the 4 new memory sticks. Good thing my CPU will need a upgrade soon, I’ll be ditching the MB with it and avoiding Asus from now on.  Is there anywhere online you can provide you hardware/software and they look at it and can tell you how best to configure or upgrade your system? That would really be helpful.
I recieved an apparently new ASUS TUF board that already had bent pins when i bought my first 670. It broke installing a GPU and never powered on again and now im out £330gbp.
I used a lot of ASUS years ago and it was all solid, ever since then whenever I see them I generally assume it will be good quality. However I don't go through hardware that much as a general consumer. So this video was VERY helpful. I'll be avoiding them in any upcoming builds.
They nuked a bunch of routers in the last couple days as well with a bad auto update
You want something better go with Lenovo! Their customer service is awful but the computer is killer!
"Ass Rock" , , a pain in the but 🤣.
I'm still an AMD fan with my x4965 Phenom II black Edition 3.4ghz going in to my retro build. Witch will be running 2 gtx550 ti's...in SLI....but that was a long time ago that i needed this for my games....but I have it now ...ok im playing some old school stuff best level
is it just their Mobos or is all Asus stuff crap now?
Totally agree, my last X570 board died just after warranty ended, it also gave so many random issues!  and that was a ROG STRIX board. replaced with a cheap gigabyte b550 and its now running flawlessly.  their quality has dropped so much, wont buy anything ROG in the future unless they improve it.
ASUS has always been up there in price too opposed to other companies
so called computer builders are spoiled now days...
I come from the generation of writing my own batch files  to get my cd rom running so practically any bios is appreciated from me
im not dogging you Jay...Im an MSI fan as well and I totally enjoy and find all your videos informative and informative I just think youve run in to a bad batch of consumer providers and a bad batch of ASUS products ...they produce products for millions of people...its going to happen...ive had my share...Im not any particular fanboy of any  product but if they dont feel solid out of the box<have good components,  or after minimal tinkering I move on as well..one bad experience can leave a bad taste in your mouth I get it...just ask my ex
Thx for bringing this up and using your social media reach.  And I really like the small part about Asrock. It's exactly what I also learned over the past years. If you asked me 15 years ago, if I want I gifted Asrock, I would have denied it. And today I'm using one which I actually bought and recommend.
I had an Asus P8Z77-V Deluxe motherboard, after a year M.2 SSDs are came out, both Gigabyte and Asrock gave a bios update for supporting boot from an NVMe M.2 PCI-E Expansion Card, but nothing came out from an Asus, That day I understand that this company don't cares about their customers.
Where is this description about warranty and beta bios - I do not see this lower part at all
I left amd chipsets when the boards failed from name brand computer manufactures....and started building my own comps...my first board I bought was an ASUS board...it was rock solid...I've used ASUS and msi boards ever since...currently running z690 boards from ASUS with 13th gen procs and have had zero issues. I haven't used any of the current MSI boards in awhile but after hearing they have been using inferior components on their products Ill probably pass ...My past experience with MSI is their driver/bios support is/was lacking...unsure about now how it is now I upgrade my comps about every 10 years my last 2 computers being the z97  and z170 chipsets on ASUS gaming pro motherboards...zero issues and total reliability on both platforms...we will see what the next 10 years my z690 boards from ASUS will handle
Absolutely maximum respect...you have put the consumer first and that's risky move as you live & Die by bands supporting your channel.  🥃 👍💪💯😁👍👍
never used asus products, always thought the ROG line was tacky. Always used MSI and or corsair here
I've been watching you for awhile now and this take just has to many biases. From a consumer point I agree with you. But to ignore the fact you overclocked your computer with its own memory profile not form factory, Makes your faulty hardware hard blame on the company alone. Maybe it was the profile that caused issued for you.    While getting broken parts delivered to you is annoying. You said it yourself that you didn't pay anything. So while yes you where sent a broken product, a product that was never meant to go out to consumers i might add. You did add in the fact that they have sent broken products in the past and that they tried hiding a recall.  i wish you would of gone into more information on those major concerns. rather then how free products are being sent to you with broken pins.      Company deals are important. Its clear that they have shown you a lack of respect for your time. if they still don't have contracts figured out by now I know i would be pretty pissed. But as a viewer i cant relate to that frustration. I'm not doing business deals with ASUS. So really it just seems like you don't like ASUS because its hard to make any deals with them. Not because of the products. for every mechanical failure you brought up it could of been user error. they say "don't overlock past these guideline's"    I love your channel jay and I agree with you a lot of the time. Your hot take's are always spot on. But i have my doubts on this one. Much love man keep up the good work!
Asus PRIME Z690-P WI-FI... Random stutters, sometimes my PC just froze for like 100%, not even mouse move. Check all of my PC components, only i5-12600K or motherboard is what im not swap to test. FUCK YOU ASUS! From that video i now know what is crashing my PC.
"takes 7 asus boards to get a good one" too soon LOL
my friend bought a top of the range pc 13th gen asus rog motherboard that has watercooling going to the VRAM. The mobo vram block started corroding his loop with ekwb and gpu block. his water went from distilled white to a grey colour from all the metal shavings in the loop. they did offer to fix it but still the damage and time wasted because someone at asus created a mobo using the wrong metal in the loop. everyone with the 13th gen asus  rog formula HAS THE SAME Problem.
Hardware companies (nvidia, Asus) are getting slimier and slimier as time goes on. So sad to see, from the gaming glory days of the early 2000's.
Have they just got no quality control, thats what happens when pen pushers dont listen to techs
Remember Asrock is also Asus....... Its like Chevrolet and GMC in the days when they had to brake into different brand because of market share rules.. Also it happened to me thtat I rma'd a board and they sent me a even more damaged one and then claimed I was destroying them on purpose to be able to claim my money.. Thats many years ago and I lost a lot of money since that board fried my core 2 Extreme edition cpu also.. But that was forgotten until now.. Now I will not forget again.
it had been this way since the past.  Asus products are riddle with hardware defects that software can never fix.  my Asus Graphics card gives me random Black screen stutter of death. and my Monitor have these 10 seconds sudden black screen and resume afterwards.
I’m diehard ROG fan, But after seeing this I really doubt about the ASUS product. @ASUS you need to step up & solve this problem & in future don’t act like assh01es. ThankX JTC for this Video ❤
not to be a debbie downer... But we allowed an industry to market a mandatory isolation for an entire generations coming of age. These individuals became adults in complete isolation, with nothing but their rectangles-which coincidentally use algorithms to systematically perpetuate their fears, hatred, selfishness, laziness, uselessness, bitterness, etc. Further, we sent evryone home from work, drove every small business in existence either into bankruptcy or brought them right to the verge of it, while we also STILL continue to pay them to sit at home-often times making more than they could expect to make if they were to return to work. We watch as BOTH of the 2 'choices' we have in phones lose functionality and dont even attempt to change 'form factor' anymore, and continue to top the previous bid for these products. Macbook's took 2009 ish by storm because THEY WERE WAY BETTER AND THEY LASTED FOREVER. My macbook from 2009 honestly was easier to record audio, edit video and combine the two than anything I have ever seen (will ever see) and my new M1 cannot even do it with native software anymore. It was literally drag the audio waveform from garage band into the imovie window, and drop it. Yeah. That easy. Worst of all, in my opinion, is the fact that we get bombarded with news about things like the 'right to repair', while meanwhile literally NOTHING changes-AT ALL. designs continue to get more complex and harder to work on with more and more software blocks, and meanwhile the one competitor released the exact same phone in different colors with a reduced quality front facing camera.   Asus is probably, like everyone else, struggling to stay afloat in this clusterF- we have allowed ourselves to be dragged down into. RIP, innovation, customer service, quality... I mean, for gods sake, I remember not 12 months ago, I had never had a bad experience at chick fil a... I really was sad when that changed.
Nice
Jay, asus is making your hair white. You'll get better leaving them
I don't have any confidence in MSI
I've always had the impression ASUS boards been top notch but.. all the "for gamers by gamers" stuff has been putting me off since they launched ROG. What they mean with a "gamer", is not how I identify myself anyway, I want quality stuff... so dodged a bullet here.
So J, if you only had a choice between MSI and Gigabyte, which one would you go with....  Between those two, which has better bang for your buck, has better customer support and better overall features?
I bought an Asus laptop a couple years ago and it had an issue out of the box of a bad bios where the CPU would get stuck at 400 MHz, making it pretty much unusable. Since I missed the return window, customer service gave me the crazy run around. It was like 6 months and sending it in 4 times until they finally replaced it. Crazy stuff.
Of the four motherboards that I've purchased for my computers. Two of them were lemons, one died within the first week and the other one died within half a year. Both were ASUS.
guess its time to stop buying bud light and Asus
Canceled my pending order, thank you for the heads up.
This saddens me because ASUS has been my favourite computer manufacturer for almost a decade. Really disappointed with their philosophy lately.
Canceled my upgrade Asus board and going with MSI (my current old motherboard that's giving me no issues).
Refusal to buy ASUS products.Taiwanese hate it too
Glad I came across this before buying parts for a new build!
Never stick with a company that has the word gamer in it… They never last
I bought an Asus ROG Strix Z790-A D4 (a $350 motherboard) and it had a solder glob in one of the ram slots. It took out one of my RAM sticks.  I returned the board and my CPU and bought a new board and CPU, this time I got a ROG Strix Z790-A (the DDR5 version). I figured if I had to get new RAM now, I might as well buy DDR5. Well, with this new board, I can't get the system to run stably with XMP enabled. I've tried everything. I've updated the BIOS, reinstalled windows, and more. Also, my Wi-Fi chip is GONE. There is no device in device manager. And this is with Wi-Fi enabled in the BIOS. So I've had to get a Bluetooth dongle so I can use my xbox controller. (The Wi-Fi chip also does the Bluetooth).  So I'm done with Asus now too. This stuff in the video is just more confirmation that I should stay away from this brand now.  It's sad too because I've been an Asus fan for years. My first laptop was an Asus G73JH. My previous build had an ROG maximus motherboard. I installed new routers in my parents house and in-laws house, and I think I spent a grand just on Asus routers. (I put five routers in my parents house and three routers in my in laws house.) (The routers didn't work as expected either btw. They are supposed to be mesh, but I never got the mesh system working, so they are just all operating as independent APs on the network, which sucks.)  Sorry Asus, but I'm done.
Matthew 13:18-23 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Well they lost another customer. Just got my NZXT H9 Flow case and have always used Asus Mobos. Was also going to try AMD for the first time and I know it might not be their issue but I'm gonna stick with what I know. So Intel/MSI combo for me. I use MSI GPUs anyways.
What are our best alternatives now?
I canceled my order. Thanks Jay!
This is Asus' Bud Light moment . Don't waste your money.
Asus always used to be a brand I gravitated towards in the late '90s till early '10s. I didn't have any standout bad experience with them but I kinda just moved away from them in most of my recent builds.. They used to be cheap and good quality. Then they became expensive and good quality (that's when I started looking elsewhere). After this though, I'll probably never buy anything from them again, sounds like they have made the jump to expensive and *bad* quality- and relying on now being a well known, established brandname to keep them going on inferior products through reputation that they gained over a decade ago. Something that happens way too often in the tech industry, unfortunately.
Unfortunately my 9 year old 4790K system died just at the start of this recent mess and my new system has a brand new ASUS AM5 motherboard and graphics card in it. Really wish it had held out a few weeks longer so I could have had this knowledge before putting the new one together.
If you know asus for the last 20 years... no surprise tbh.
10 or so years ago, I got an ASRock board, total nightmare, no need to tell the story. Replaced with an amazing Gigabyte board. Fast forward to a couple years ago, went to build my Ryzen rig.  All advice pointed to ASRock.  I was naturally wary, but got the X570 Phantom Gaming 4, it's run amazingly, so happy with it.    10 years ago, everyone told me the Gigabyte boards were the gold standard at the time.  Now many people frown upon them, and ASRock puts out some really quality stuff.  Just goes to show you, things change all the time, and companies do turn around, you have to pay a lot of attention and look at the specifics and take in a lot of information.
My personal build has an ASRock B250 in it. Also an ASUS GTX1060 6gb. It was my first build and it has been flawless. Looking for a new build because my daughter wants mine. The G4560 has served me me well but im ready to play with the big boys. I still bleed blue but im asking you, what would you build for 2 grand ish?
I'm not buying ASUS again.
lol
This is an AMD problem. Allways is. Intel doesnt overheat and break its self as much as AMD CPUs. Do NOT buy AMD CPUS and products.
as someone who loves asus years ago, i clearly saw a massive decline in their product quality and just general respect for their customers the moment they started hard pushing the TUF series the way they did strix a dew years earlier. just adding more lineups wiht less differences other than "haha tuf not rog/strix you cheap noob?". they just seem super arrogant and think they are waaaaaaaay better than they were at their prime, get a grib asus jesus.
this is wild. I've got an intel 9th gen asus TUF wifi board and have been having so many problems lately. I thought my mouse was breaking cause it kept freezing randomly for a few seconds or completely disconnecting. ended up buying a new mouse and it's still happening though not as bad. Bluescreens here and there, headset going out and having to unplug and replug as well as the mic doing the same thing. Performance has been getting a bit worse in the past month or two also. Now I'm wondering if it's my mobo.
I didn't know your channel was sponsored by asus are your other asus reviews legit or persuaded by sponsorship
I was always an ASUS guy, since I used to be in the PC building industry since 2002. Thanks for this, I will now move on..
Yes Asus recently bricked my router with a firmware update. Thanks a$$holes. "You'll own nothing and be happy".
Jay, what really bothers me is the fact that this was ignored for so long.  Some of us have been talking about this for YEARS.  We were accused of damaging the boards, of not installing correctly and of just being ignorant, this is not just a hardware vendor issue.  Let me give a perfect example.  When I retired in 2019 I wanted to enjoy retirement and Asus had just released their 30th Anniversary Edition 30 X299.  Since I had been an Asus customer for almost that long it seemed like a perfect fit. Except it wasn't.  This system was supposed to support 256mb of RAM with its eight DIMM slots.  Except it didn't.  They didn't have a single supported configuration that would support it.  After spending 12 hours on the phone they told me they were working on it.  Well it's 4 years later and they still don't support it.  The also loved to play "bait and switch," by having the support techs keep changing mid call and then making you go back and forth on the issue.  But the final straw was being told that the board I bought COULD NOT BE SUPPORTED and they couldn't tell me anything about it because it had the wrong country code on the board.  Apparently, the board was supposed to be shipped to another country but ended up at my local Micro Center and by the time this was discovered you could no longer get these boards (unless you wanted triple the cost on eBay - if you could find one).  So, I have a very nice looking computer, that only supports a few banks of RAM (reluctantly), no chance of the QVL being upgraded.   Did I mention that when I went to get a replacement it was the Asus Hero that was recalled? What really bugs me is I have an Asus Z87 Sabertooth that I purchased well over a decade ago.  It sits in my garage (unheated/not airconditioned) running 24/7 in an old Lian-Li P80 case and the damn thing won't die.  My kids and grandkids log into it because I use it as a plex server.  To say I was loyal to the brand should go without saying.  But after the last few experiences with Asus I'm thinking about seeing what Dell has. I know this is long but Microsoft is just as bad when it comes to Windows 11 support on any of these machines.  It's hard to tell where the hardware is failing or the operating system is failing.  At almost 70 do I really have to start using Acer, Asrock and Linux mint?
Super awesome vid, Jay.  Well done.
i had a 7th gen asrock board, the k4 fatality b250 i think it was, and it was awesome, it was like $140aud and had great heat sinks and usb-c and all sorts of great features, recently i build a 13th gen system, and literally the POS asus board i got for $200aud, doesnt even have usb-c, doesnt have heatsinks, its such a cheap POS but its all that was available that wasnt $300aud, thanks jay for sticking up for us little dudes out here struggling
1:12 that was a sly edit but he definitely said something other than stuff and you guys dubbed over it.  And the digital zoom to the side to hide his mouth.  Well done.  "keep your sh**"
every one I know who has built using Asus motherboards have had nothing but problems, I avoid their stuff like the plague.
I had the same feeling when I was trying to get them replace the Asus Zenfone Zoom 3. They always like 'yea we'll fix it, send it to service center' then after waiting months to get it fixed. The line issues still comes back on the phone's LCD. Wasted 600$ on that phone. At that point, I said that I'm never going to buy any ASUS products again.
I have actually never had a good ASUS product. Seriously. Always had bad performing Graphics cards from them. Poor motherboards with bad support. Monitors that only have a DVI and a VGA port and regularly cut out? Check!  Seriously... ASUS has been on my avoid list for YEARS.
And that's what you get from a 230B $ publicly traded company that provides dividends. All they are about is their bottom line with 0 concern for the consumer.
so ive recently bought an x3d and asus mobo, that i had to RMA within days of receiving due to memory issue. the hardware has been tested and the cpu was found faulty.... now i dont know if my mobo destroyed the cpu or if the cpu was genuinly faulty. it has now been past the 2 week return policy and i am genuinly concerned that i may be stuck with faulty hardware that i cant return anymore... the mobo is the b650
Does this only apply to their motherboards?  I'm building my first PC soon (waiting for ram to arrive) and the Asus Dual Radeon RX 6650 XT OC Edition is the GPU I went with...so I'm kinda concerned now 😅
Hello evga for my next build
Thank you Jay, this takes you know what. You are right everyone has problems, its how they fix or respond to said problems and ASUS has failed or tried to save themselves instead of saving the customers. Thank you again Jay and from now or maybe the rest of my life which is very possible, I wont be buying anything Asus.
My Asus MB has been glitchy from day one. The problem I have is that getting a new MB means the *ssh*loes at Microsoft will demand that I buy a new copy of Windows.
jay, asus just relessed bios update 1415. dont bother with it, screwed up my machine. so i had to go back to 1303 to fix. lots of blu sreens.
After the garbage ROG laptop that I bought 4 years ago I avoid ASUS products ever since.
I could see all of this happening if the boards were "Entry-Level" boards, but it's happening with their premium, most expensive boards. Just a real head-scratcher to me!! Seems they should want to take care of the customer who has spent hundreds on one of their boards. SMH
correction,  your first oblication is to work and make money.   ( basic needs always come first, I mean we all need to eat and sleep and poop.)
and this is why i went with last gen asus, graphics cards and chips
It's kinda weird, i used an AsSUT TUF monitor, they gave me my money back, I've had a b350-f and a b550-f and both work flawlessly
"It takes 7 boards to get one from ASUS let me explain"      *-I FUCKING DIED-*
asus is scambags
Looks like my ROG B550 and TUF 3070ti will be my first and last ASUS products
Complaining about free stuff 🙄
Thanks Jay for confirming my sneaky suspicions from the last 5 years. My how the mighty have fallen. Now ASUS is just another turd on the shitpile of PC motherboard manufacturers. It's all cheap Chinese junk, no matter what you're paying for it, or who's making it.
Glad I bought a Zotac 4080 after years of paying premium for ASUS, never going back to them. Even without the recent event, their shit is just overpriced.
Good on you Jay.  Asus hardware has been great for me across a bunch of boards, but for about twelve years the software has often been dodgy--and sometimes at best.  In fact, on my Rampage VI Extreme Omega board, one of their BIOS updates was incredibly bad.  It almost fried my 18 core CPU that cost almost two grand, overclocking it at an extreme level at stock settings that was not normal, and had not been a problem with any other BIOS updates.  Also, whenever I contacted them about issues, their responses were extremely poor, getting disconnected to their chat repeatedly, and getting ridiculous replies at best to emails as if they had not even read a single word of what I had written and what the email was about.
My Z790-E from them for my 13900KS keeps hard crashing apps, I've checked EVERYTHING, 5 different kits of memory,  3 of which are on the QVL, xmp non xmp, checked pins, plenty of PSU power, tried another psu just in case I can only say it has to be the motherboard because this is my 3rd install of windows. I've trusted ASUS for yeeeears but my faith is starting to wain, luckily my client builds haven't taken a shit, but of course MINE is gorked. I have the Lian Li 011 mini airflow so it's a bit annoying to work on so I would love it to just work lmao
Thanks for the vid! I am just about to do a new build!
I went AMD when the 5800x was released since it seemed like everyone was saying great things about AMD at the time. I've never had more issues with a single system in my life. So much overclocking, undervolting and curve optimization just to get decent performance and I still have random memory and usb issues. Also mad respect for calling out these companies on their shit!
common Jay W
I'm curious, has newegg redeemed themselves yet?  This video reminded me of that saga.
I have the ROG STRIX Z690-E Gaming WIFI ASUS motherboard and the ASUS ROG STRIX NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 3070 v2 OC edition..... Do I need to be worried or look out for something?? Ive had this build since last summer without issues, and im not too familiar with all the drama in the pc world.
I was an Asus supremacist until 3 years ago after buying 3k$ ROG laptops for all my employees. They were supposed to be revolutionary in heat management and boasted top performance on paper. In reality, they all overheated quickly, thermal throttled in 5 mins under load, volume caps breaking, the audio jacks not working, and so many other issues. We switched to Lenovo Legions and those things are beasts. Silent, cool, performant, resilient. ROG is dead, long live the Legion.
Thank you Jayz, I've been looking to update my now rather old ASUS motherboard and I've been using them for years, going back to the socket 775 days. After watching this, I'm not sure that I want to go down the ASUS path anymore.....
fun fact, i spent half a day getting rid of asus' crappy armory crate and everyting connected to it, because that software is so horrible it made my whole system unstable. i now use their ancient and discontinued aura software, because that one is solid ... it was created at a time when asus still was good. obviously that time has passed. my current B550 board will definitely be the last asus board for a good long while.
you think only asus motherboards are shit? try any mid-priced asus laptop ever. build quality is shit, perf. is shit, support is shit etc. even the very expensive ones are insultingly bad. asus products were good up until a decade ago. after that is a downward spiral of half-assed, overpriced garbage. there are only a few exceptions but generaly stay away from their products. they don't deserve their price.
After Maximus VIII Crosshair Hero motherboard I can say with confidence I won't be buying ASUS products again. The software is ALWAYS terrible. The hardware in my experience is ok at best. With every ASUS product except maybe 3080 I have had one or more issues.  Motherboard problems I've had: CPU optional doesn't work anymore, PBO crashed programs with the old BIOS version, can't enable some settings in BIOS for some reason (resize bar etc), with some settings the PC won't boot (I have made sure it wasn't issue with Windows install).
About to buy a new lga 1700 mobo. Thanks for the heads up!
Ive done quite a few rolling upgrades over 5 years.  Even at the start i always had a dilemma with brand bc Asus cosistently had the most powerful and most stock, but were notorious for DOA and horrible customer service. So what it equated to was if you got lucky with your product (doa/no warranty problems) you were golden. I almost pulled the trigger multiple times but i value customer service too much so have consistently went MSI.  I honestly could see this coming a mile away.
Dear Asus,  Pay me and I will sell your trash I will sell out for you I have no integrity just make sure you pay me enough to replace the computers you fry and a little more to buy better products
I've been behind this brand for years, I think almost decades (2 decades, lol but I think almost 2). And always been praising them as like they were god and never had any issues with them (luckily). But this is so fucking bad and I would almost want to warn all the people whom I've been praising ASUS to for years. This is absolutely not ok.
Im getting nightmares right now, i had no idea.. my entire rig is Strix.. :( Im scared now
Wow, lots of issues, makes you second guess a purchase of their handheld device. Thanks for the information.
i just bought a x670e hero and 7950x combo, should i send it back? if so, what should i get instead?
I always rather enjoyed ASUS Products, although my old rig has 10 years of hard work behind it, and it had everything ASUS in it. Even the second hand 2060 as a temporary and cheap boost compared to the old GTX 660 was ASUS. The MoBo jebaited me once, making me think it died for good, and through channels like Jayz's I had my eyes on Gigabyte and Gainward. So now I'm rocking an Aorus Master MoBo with a Gainward latest gen RTX. No regrets. Oh and that ASUS MoBo which claimed to have PWM headers? Yeah, they weren't, even though they were branded as PWMs on the silicon... 😂
I once purchased an ASUS product that failed in 8 months from normal use.  The charging port connections on the laptop started to loosen, and the screen hinges on the notebook started making creaky noises, and then finally cracked away from the casing.  I checked and found out this was a common problem with this type of hinge system.  But instead of working to address the problems, and without explaining how they jumped to this conclusion, ASUS immediately deemed that I had misused or abused the computer, and refused to honor the warranty.  Sometime later, I became one of the decisionmakers at my company, with regards to selecting IT equipment.  Call it Karma...  So without hesitation, I steered the company away from considering any products made by ASUS.
I"M DONE WITH ASUS as well! I had a ROG Strix B550-F motherboard I put together w/a 5950X - my first AMD build that started having issues with the ethernet connection (YouTube, Spotify etc.,) would just stop playing for 10-30secs or so; YT would play reliable at 144p otherwise same thing, BUT playing same things in Windows Sandbox or on a virtual machine would PLAY FINE wtf??  I finally gave up and spent another $180 to replace that mobo with the newer B550-F WiFi version - after getting that put in w/drivers and bios updated - SAME ISSUE!  At first I thought it was Verizon FIOS throttling YT and other major streaming sites (they're still suspect, but that's another issue), but when connecting to my WIFI network w/the new mobo, the streaming issues went totally away (which was the same w/all my laptops - no streaming issues on wifi!)  Finally doing a search on B550-F wifi ok, but ethernet issues return a post with others complaining about wired network issues (w/a different ASUS model mobo) - one HEROIC dude's post stated "putting in a cheap PCIe network card solved all my issues...  I decided to do similar, ordered a 2.5G network adapter card - received it yesterday, put it in my system, disabled the mobo network adapter and ALL MY WIRED INTERNET ISSUES ARE GONE!!  Nearly a YEAR dealing w/this issue, wasting time, money, and suffering with this networking issue to discover it's ASUS's JANK network adapter chipset and/or driver code!  How the Sandbox or VMs didn't have similar network issues I don't know but LAWD I finally resolved this plague of an issue!  Back in March I went to Microcenter and bought an ASUS ROG G614J laptop thinking I'll just give up being stuck in my office w/that desktop and have a bit more mobility.  But now I'm noticing that the left side speaker has a "twang" / distortion to it if the volume is just a bit too loud, like a screw is loose or the speaker itself has an issue w/the cone - of course when I started noticing it, my Microcenter return window had closed...  I'm DONE with ASUS - BY BYTCH!
True, I explained to them that the mobo I bought from them doesn't support my Radeon Pro WX9100, and they just don't care... bye bye Asus if that's your vision for customer support. ASUS, It's your shit to fix and you don't care. (PS the same GPU works fine on a Threadripper rig)
7th wall lol
I used to be sort of an ASUS fanboy.  Just loved the aesthetics of their products.  But I've been weaned off that by the absolute dog crap customer support and software issues.  I've been slowly moving away with each new product.  This newest thing is completely unsurprising and just solidifies my disdain for the brand.  All I have left is the mobo and keyboard (that, in my defense, I got on sale).
The last thing from ROG I bought was the ROG Phone 2. Got it in 2019 and it is still going strong today. It's wild that their other products are like this.
AsRock , MSI , ASUS , but you never talk never Biostar?
Algorithm bump
I have an Asus rog x570 motherboard and been having some issues with it. I want to switch to MSI motherboard but what's equivalent to the x570? I have Nvidia Asus rog strix 3080 12gb and AMD Ryzen 7 5800x 8 core processor
Yeah, not buying from them again, i've heard some stuff from others too.
you willing to go this far to do the right thing and severing ties with Asus gets my subscription  thanks for this.
I only use Asus GPU, they never fail me,..But No for Motherboard
When I was still a pc gamer Asus was my go to motherboard. I have not had a pc since 2009 (console gamer). It make me so sad to see one of the best brands in the world synonymous with gaming has gone to shit. Thx for this. Will share with my pc brothers
My X58 Board still kicks ass using a X5675 before Intel Nuked their Xeon Line.  Pretty much never getting a new computer,. It's faster than I ever will be.
Thanks for sharing this. I had taken a long break from building gaming rigs and just built one last year. Sadly.. most of it is made of ASUS parts. It's working ok for the most part now, but the first ROG Ryujin II 360 was DOA right out of the box. Stand alone drivers are non existent and it took forever to get Armoury crate to work, then half a year for it to properly install new GPU and other drivers after a recent software update. The TUF GAMING Z590-PLUS WIFI USB controller would randomly drop all USB connections so I had to switch to a PCI-e USB controller. Another gripe is the Helios case. It's amazing and is built well over all, but comes with lackluster fans and a manual Low/High controller... which for what you are paying for, PWM software controlled fans should really be included IMO. I'm still not sure if the USB issue was drivers, over load or heat (added Lain-Li Uni V2's for case and radiator).. but I'm in the same mindset of avoiding ASUS going forward.
And where are you going to get them from ???? Gigabyte,  MSI ???? They are the same Jay aren't they??? All tree major brands don't give a shit about consumers.
any issues with Asus strix b550 ??
I had Asus gaming laptop and they refuse to register it as their product in their website that was my first red flag
Can't wait to see your Megaman X build!!!  Oh and btw, I've been building with ASRock MoBo's for the last 10 years and haven't had a single issue.
Thank you for the honesty as always. What about their Graphics Cards?
oh man...i just bought new asus motherboard few weeks back. after watch this video makes me wanna change to different brand
This is the reason i will not be buying the ALLY. I'm not going to be a test dummy and if it has issues get no way of fixing it.
Good project
I think the monitors are still fire
I agree with your concerns, I was sick of Asus's flakey boards and support, kicked them to the curb when I built my lastest computer a few years ago.  Thanks for always taking a stand on issues...
holy shit dude.... if i could afford it i would take the asus 570 out of my desktop but i for sure will never buy asus again!
Your loyalty towards the consumer, is the reason I keep watching your videos! Never change man.
I have an ROG STRIX Z590-F and I keep getting an error on boot, that only one of the CPU 4 Pins is connected. I tried replacing the cables and even another power supply and it keeps happening. Sometimes I get weeks without it saying anything and then on every boot it'll pause for a couple seconds to show me the error again. I haven't had any crashes or weird behavior and my CPU is boosting the way it should regardless, so I just live with it. But yea, for my next build I'll stay away from ASUS. I even had connected the double and single 4 pin sockets at first and now just the double socket. Issue still persists...
Noted. Will not purchase the Asus motherboard I have in my cart for this Ryzen build. Or any other build going forward. Thanks, Jay!
Asus sucks wooooo
Build my pc about a year ago with all Asus parts. Spend 5K+. Been having nothing but problems and now I'm having an unstable and unreliable pc. Wish I knew about how crappy Asus is before I built it...
Hey Jay, I'm a huge fan of your content! I wanted to share my thoughts on a recent topic. While I appreciate your passion, I think it's important to take a step back sometimes and thoroughly discuss matters before drawing conclusions. I understand your concerns about Asus' announcement regarding the BIOS Beta, but it's worth considering what was mentioned on the WAN Show. Linus explained that Asus will address any issues that may arise from the BIOS update, and the warning about voiding warranties is actually a default message that appears when installing any BETA version of software.  Keep up the amazing work, and take care!  Sending support from Costa Rica.
Outstanding!  Great presentation, and thanks for holding their feet to the fire.
Speaking of Asus quality control. Yesterday my Asus router started restarting each few minutes. And when I googled, I found other people talking about similar problems. It seems they released something that caused problems on multiple models of routers. Now, after watching the video and getting a new problem on a not even fresh device, I'm asking myself a question — is owning Asus a liability? Did they get rid of a QC team or something?
This is republican corporate America fuck the consumer profits over everything....
My last Asus product was a motherboard that died within a few days of purchasing. I spent about 17 hours on the phone with Asus over several days. I shipped the MB to Asus, then about 2 months later they returned it, refusing to warranty it. Thank goodness Newegg was aware of the situation and let me return it despite the 30 days having elapsed from purchase. This was he last straw. Every prior Asus product I had ever bought died within 2 years. The BBB ignored my complaint as well, unblemishing their undeserved reputation.
What motherboards are safe to get for the 7800X3D?
I somehow glad that this video came out. I might have not involved with asus much. Just some friends with cheap asus laptop having bluescreen and keyboard problems. But that makes me, "I don't want to touch that brand". And this video confirms it.
Owned a Asus board years ago, as soon as I saw the awful boot screen, I already hated it. Looks that my instincts weren't wrong in the first place. Never bought anything of Asus again, sold the board and switched manufacturer.
Damn I might need to switch companies now 😅
Thank you for doing this. As a customer of many ASUS products in the past, I'll be staying away moving forward
You had these "experiences" because you were getting FREE product. The entitlement now-a-days is infuriating. You're making assertions that really only apply to "influencers" like yourself.
Thank you so much!!! Now I'm going to wait, and possibly not buy the new ROG Ally that's coming out. 🤣🤦‍♀️
That is bull im sorry but a manufacturer has to be held full responsible so that statement is flawed if a bord dont work at and all the customer did was turn it on and it blows up cpu then its manufacturing flawd not consumer so if a bata bios fucks the bord up evin more then just like asus can be held responsible i dont care what anyone says asus cannot doge responsibility if they do then they cannot be given money for a new product
Only the beginning of the BS from Asus...   They are allowing Microsoft to deliberately corrupt the keyboard drivers of their old machines in Windows while the keyboard works perfectly fine in DOS...  Outrageous underhanded BS from this Chinese company... ☹️
my last 3 personal computers had and still have ASROCK motherboards, never had a Asus component, not that i didnt like it, just wasnt needed or the case, when i upgraded to 2060 i choosed ZOTAC, Asus was dead last, i love the EVGA design and logo. Asus Tuf was somenthing that made me  interested in a future upgrade or build, but now..... no way
I turfed a great-looking ASUS dual-screen laptop because it ran unusably hot when doing nothing.  It seemed like expensive trash.
Don't you think your acting a tad entitled Asus make products I've had no issues with their motherboards.
This was kinda a random video i was listening to and I am glad to have listened to you. I had a problem with Newegg cause I had a cpu bought through them and when it came to me there were pins that were bent. A friend that was helping build my PC offered to fix it and see if it can be salvaged, but we were prepped to accept that if I returned it I couldn't get my money back. Sadly that happened and when i got the cpu back I was curious and looked at the pins to find that not only it wasn't the one we sent, but it looked like someone just took a thick flat head screw driver and then bent the pins in a different spot every which way they could. I complained to their customer service and they said "New egg would never do that to their stock or returns"  After that I made a vow to not order through them ever again. I hold the fault for the return on the first cpu, but to say I was at fault and sent the one that was even worse made me so mad.  I love ASUS as I have their monitors and such, but I'll start going for MSI motherboards and such for my next AMD build.
that nose hair , is so annoying
This man is for the people 🙌🏽
I've recommended Asus mbs for years. After watching GN vids, I will no longer. It's unbelievably ridiculous that they would fuck their customers like this, and it will take years of no questions asked RMAs to make up for it.
So good to know this now since i'm buying a new PC for myself and i wanted to get ASUS motherbord. Well here in goes, i'll better go with MSI or smth.
As a Strix fan, who just spent $300 on a Ryujin(Because your review, IT IS actually the best cooler I've ever used btw.) This is extremely sad. Everything else in my SLI 3090 Kingpin build is EVGA(I beat you btw on PR AND TS with them lol.) I almost feel bad having the Ryujin mixed in with my favorite brand ever. I'm a builder with over 700 built in my 20 years. The majority of components I went for were TUF or STRIX. This is sad ASUS! I depended on your brand for many builds. Im now afraid I can't continue to purchase ASUS products because of this. FIX THIS, or what's left of it to fix! At least give us some word that you care to some extent about the lifespan of your company. As an extremely passionate PC enthusiast, </3.
Thank you Jay, for putting the consumer and your viewers first! I have trusted/relied on your product testing and reviews for purchasing decisions for quite some time. I can rest easy knowing that was not a mistake! Integrity is everything in the business world. I purchased a Strix RTX 3080 from Asus last year and I am very happy with it's performance. That said, the idea that Asus would do this to their customers tells me I would be a fool to ever risk spending my hard earned cash with them again!
Nice
I have i9 and some weird issue... I pray don't encounter again... and I still think why I didn't bought AsRock.
Oh shit about a month ago i purchased a whole ASUS TUFF gaming system should i be worried?. I  did get a issue about a week ago where it booted to desktop then shut itself off and wouldn't boot again so i turned the PSU off at the switch and took the side panel off and made sure everything was seated correctly (i assumed maybe it had been knocked in transit) ok so waited a good 10 mins after doing this and it booted back up and has been fine so far, i'm wondering if i should contact the company which built it for me and air my concerns based on this VOD :/
Thank you!!! Respect for your work and integrity... the mess is too big to try to hide.
thx 4 the vid. Will stop using asus.
Thankfully, I've never bought any expensive computer parts by Asus such as graphics cards or monitors. The reason being I had several of their wireless sticks and antennas, that are also priced way above competition as a brand statement, and all of them either failed within two years or had really poor reception (I got a <60€ unbranded one outperforming Asus antennas enormously). I guess their sales mostly come from sponsorships and hype, not from actually making good products.
Im not good with hardware parts so im really lucky to watch this video since I dont have any idea that theres and issue like this for ASUS ( im planning to buy a desktop tower this month and if I remember it properly that one use that brand motherboards...)
Lol, they are bad. I have a gaming laptop of 4k€ with an extra warranty, and they refuse to help...
Thanks for helping me decide what upgrades to not buy! MSI is now my money taker. Thanks jay and friends.
Jay, you state they don't care? well, you have 3.89 million reasons that say they should.
I've had an ASROCK b85 fatality for 9 years, sold it and still working flawlessly. It been thru CPU and RAM overclocks. Respect them
Recently I purchased two rtx4060 laptops from microcenter, one MSI one ASUS. I upgraded the ssd on both, lo and behold, the asus would no longer turn on afterwards. Thankfully microcenter took it back, MSI used to be the cheap-o brand but my o my how the tables have turned....
I never had an ASUS board and thought they were always the most rep/pricey and goat but nevermind
Can u imagine the companies that sell these items, theyre probably getting bombarded with problems and complaints because of asus
Who the hell actually thinks "noo, a loud, public recall isn't good! It'll HURT our brand!"? Like, if I walk up to you and say 'hey dude, I'm so sorry, I messed something up before and I felt really bad and I had to chase after you right away and make sure I fixed it' you're not going to reply by saying screw off and I'm never coming back. It's actually some out of touch BS if that's a *"problem"* for corporate. Jesus Christ.
I got since 3 weeks complete crashes of Sound, gpu mouse etc. Nur on an x570 Board. I think i throw it away
I love you J an i do understand why you feel the way you do BUT I also feel you rushed into throwing them out with out waiting doing more research.. they already stated they had to say they that an will honor any beta problems..
Actually have only problems eoth my z790f board and ddr5 ram. Sometimes after xmp setting I have to change the keyboard usb because is does not working. Activision games freezing. Orher games working fine. Tried 5 differet rams... Next step sell this shit and change to msi or gigabyte ddr5 lga1700
I've had similar issues dating back to 2018 and it's wild to see the problems with ASUS mobos frying itself with the CPU in it arent just with me. I've had it happen to me twice, and one of the times not only did it fry the cpu and mobo it also fried a brand new power supply
Are you going to talk abut this same issue for gigabyte motherboards or is this just hate for Asus? also this is AMD problem
Asus laptop adapter replacement is again a pain in the ass right now. It is just not available anywhere😕.
Wish you’d released this a few months ago recently got a z790 rog strix
A campain aginst ASUS? Probably Asus did not pay them what they want! I don't trust these YouTubers anymore!
I have a couple of units of Asus equipment, everything suits me, I'm happy.  They have served me well for many years.
Did i saw megaman there? 2:44
Not Just In the PC department.... But in their ROG Phone lineup too.... They never really came out and accepted their mistake... Whatever happened with ROG Phone 5.....
Can i get one of the motherboard, please??
You didnt even mention their armoury crate cancer software and how it fails to control the rgb on ITS OWN PRODUCTS!! Every company has bad products every once in a while but my first impressions with msi far outweigh my asus experiences.
I had a ROG PG278Q that I used for years, when it broke they didn't want to fix it and considered it disposable goods.  Never buying Asus again.
I have always been a fan of Asus but even before the whole blowing up of 7800X3D stuff, Asus has been a little too all over the place and branching out into other tech stuff. They need to make sure they can really re-focus and improve their quality control with PC components.
Crap, I just got an ASUS ROG computer... now I'm scared...
Honestly... This is really sad because of the Asus divisions that are really good.   Mainly Graphics but also things like the ROG Ally
Awesome video and fully understandable. I would stop supporting them and using ASUS products too. I also had a asus mobo problem with a old mobo that ended up killing a old build. So I no longer use ASUS products as I have also experienced the same type of customer support. Please stick with your AMD build before changing to intel. I would love to see you swap out your ASUS board for a MSI board to test out that sweet cpu and to hear your personal review. Also just to see how it compares. I personally switched to MSI for my last build and have never looked back since. It has been rock solid for almost 3 years now. I have considered a Bios update but I'm really not experiencing anything to make me need to. It would be more to try the newer AMD smart ram feature etc. Excited to see how the channel evolves here on out.
I traded out my new Asus board for an ASRock today after learning about all this. More so because of their lack of customer support. Especially the “beta bios” update fixes issues but voids your warranty! wtf is that BS?? BYE BYE ASUS!
I'll gladly take all the stuff they give you😂
Well no assus for me now.
I have B650E F and one day pc decided im not gonna boot for 5 hours.. Different error code every failed boot and i felt lost. Thankfully it's working like nothing happened since then buy yeah. You can't rely on asus anymore.
In my 15 year experience with computers. AMD had all th problems your share along with bluescreens and crashing. Intel line has been a godsend.
Fuck asus. My x570 hero still have the usb dropping issue no matter using latest bios and driver. They wont even fix that!
I had an asus motherboard, all my sata ports fried, got with asus and they completely blew me off switched to msi, and will keep it that way
I’m looking to build a new pc and I’ve always be an asus guy. I’m going to build an intel build with the latest i7 13th gen. What other mb manufacturer should I go with?
As he and GN goes, as do I. Suck it A-SUS. Ya dead.
Word on the street is the parts shortage is to blame. Meaning cheap transistors, capacitors, etc. They shot themselves in the foot for not paying more for the quality parts needed to make these boards. Gigabyte did the same thing this is the domino effect.
not getting any samples or sponsorship from Asus anymore - makes a video that bags asus and claims they are anti consumer. Makes sense.
ya i stop using asus as well
Muy tarde....
I cannot Im going to do the same ... I was going to build a complete Asus Strix Line build😢...it was my favorite brand 😮 forever.....Farewell till maybe next year
Personally my first build was a gigabyte. Great solid board. This was like 2010 so no clue if their still good.  2018 i built an asus... board felt flimsy as all hell... still using it today. But once I get enough money saved up.. I'm going with something else.
in my 18 years building PC and general tech support; i have never been fond of Asus Not their GPUs or CPUs; at most, i purchased a couple of Crosshair motherboards off ebay. Asrock gives you the same specs without breaking the bank and honestly, they seem to be the only company that isnt causing drama like Asus, MSI, Gigabyte.   I miss EVGA
Linus's crew from LTT has even somewhat shunned them, interesting.
Speaking of asus. I bought a Arion s500. I installed the included software. Went to “reformat device” 7:37. Now my entire is dead. I’ll I get is a message that says MBR Error 1. This literally happened as I’m watching this video.
Wow that's a load a of volcanic boiling crap, if the manufacturer of a said item is putting out a software update to the customers themselves, to "fix" a particular problem with their own items, that shouldn't void any warranty they provide, because it's coming from THEM!!!
Thanks Jay!  I came across this latest video of yours by accident.  I was experiencing a very slow restart issue (5+ minutes) after installing the latest Win 10 updates and was doing some Safe Mode/Clean Boot troubleshooting. I was going through the list of services I already had disabled, one of which was the Asus Com Service (atkexComSvc.exe) and doing some searching to see what this service actually did and why I had disabled it, I was led here.  I've been a system builder for a very long time, and I'm probably dating myself here but my go-to motherboard brand before switching to Asus was Abit before they quit making MBs and then went out of business.  I really liked a lot of the little extras Asus used to include with their product; shielded backplates, all of the cables you needed, SLI connectors and even a printed manual.  Now they have cut everything to the bone and there's not much to differentiate their MBs vs. any other manufacturer.  I've used multiple versions over the years but after seeing this my next build is going to be based on another brand.  Keep up the excellent work!
now im worried about my TUF 15 laptop i just bought last september
Good to see an influencer not just take the money and they run. Great overview of the issues and what you had to do.
So nobody has anything good to say about ASUS?
Over 60% of Asus parts I bought over time, failed and they do not honor warranties.  They are just words printed on paper.  ASUS sucks.
sounds like Asus pulled a Nvidia to EVGA type of situation
I got the ASUS prime z-590 board, and it had a random bios issue I got the money back for it from amazon I upgraded to the Tuff z-590-plus and now that one is having memory issues at random times I switched back to the prime and its fine, but I'd prefer the board that was originally for my build I'm currently waiting on it.
Asus Rules dudes!!!   Well I had the same problems as you do on B650 boards and because its a new hardware  I was expecting it ...  just downclock until BIOS is stable and everything should be fine. Remembering that X570, B550, B450 and even A520 boards still the most stable and trustable PC gamers ever for low budgets people like me …  ASUS STILL THE BEST CHOICE for me…. And Guys we can be better than that, the time of burning witches is done and we Gamers live for fun and joy, our vibes shouldn’t get as low as the haters vides does..   love you channel man
I have purchased asus laptops in the last 6 months. I had to go through four just to get a working one. I really regret even keeping the one that did work correctly.
Ouch. I've been Asus loyal for decades. You've made some really good points.
Their decisions are so far removed from common sense they're baffling. If they're ONLY goal is to make money, how is this POSSIBLY supposed to attract new customers, or retain existing customers?  This actually tugs at my heartstrings. My dad bought me my first computer when I was 9. It had an Asus motherboard and with it, he taught me what a BIOS is. I'm 21 now and have always used  ASUS motherboards due to the convenience of familiarity. I know how stupid it sounds, but I had a sentimental attachment to ASUS. You let me down ASUS, so long.
the premium isn't worth repeat custom THIs is the same shit with companies like apple razer etc   they get popular and then start cutting corners while still raising their prices due to brand recognition   this is why i quit buying razer and looks like ASUS too.   essntially this is the same scam in all marketing they become profit driven instead of premium driven their PREMIUM products should be the ONLY  products and the aim should be high value but at as low cost as possble and expand outward  but i guesds the ever green clusterfuq wasn't worth it
Hmm should i really buy an asus rog zephyrus g14 from asus canada or best buy
Poor guy was sending a "It's those snacks you want ?" to his wife
its not asoose its a *sus*
My audio completely cuts in and out. I’ve already BRICKED a 9900k
There is a lot of companies who don’t have good customer service or treat their employees fairly then they wonder why they loose business or end up going bankrupt
I have the same perblems with Asus I was saving money to upgrade my PC got the Asus ROG Strix z690e and Asus ROG Strix 1000w PSU and Asus ROG Strix RTX3090Ti my psu and mobo have problems I don't know what from but I think its the PSU all of my HD stopped working all the SATA ports stopped working in the mobo 20TB of data lost my RTX3090Ti have a red light on one of the 8/4pin port don't work contacted the seller/Asus and told me to f*** off I used to go with EVGA and MSI for my old PC but the amount of praising for Asus I said I should go with what everyone talking about
Asus is done for me as well. I bought an A15 in 2020/2021 and about 5 months in I just started noticing weird things always happening from their software to just hardware constantly failing not performing and so on. It's obviously not a top end laptop and I was going to school and gaming on it, but 4 cpu and 2 GPU fans later and issues since the beginning with the headphone jack/ usb ports, they just make a sub par machine with comparable prices to mid to high-end machines.
Always sustained Asus is trash
Damn it I was just going to buy a crosshair.viii Extreme motherboard. Looks like I'll be going to EVGA for their x570 Dark
Got the ROG Loki 1000w on pre-order, all these videos have me contemplating cancelling it.   I try to avoid the anti-consumer bulllshit whenever possible.
i was ASUS fan but no more.... zero stability
I helped my bro piece out his new rig, and the ASUS Prime X670-P came defective. It was causing blue screens, program crashes, game crashes, audio issues, the works... He replaced it with an MSI board and its running solid. The past year or so I've only heard bad things about them. Their customer support is horrible, software is horrible, boycotting this garbage with you Jay.
I'm glad to see Asus being kicked for providing terrible customer support. I've been a pretty unhappy Asus customer so this feels like a small revenge :) On the BIOS which (does not)fixes the issue AND voids the warranty, it feels as if the Legal department was asked to fix the problem! :)
I have never had any luck with Asus motherboards.
Thank's ill not buy asus anymore
you know its funny, i built a brand new computer a couple years ago, ryzen 9 3950x with a strix b550 asus board.....  been having SUPER strange issues since the MOMENT i booted it up for the first time.... now i know where they are all probably coming from lmfao thanks for putting this info out there!!!
Thanks for the video, Jay! My last build was all AMD and mostly ASUS with zero issues (~3yrs). Very disappointing how their products have deteriorated in quality since then, and will have to look elsewhere for upgrades next Cyber Monday.  Totally agree they at least still have great looking boards and boxes. 😂
I'm not surprised and happy this is now finally coming to light for media folks. I had to RMA Asus router. They sent me a used router with the previous customers information and setup still on the router.
Moved away from Asus and switched to MSI in 2017.
Tp start with, Without Us the consumers they do not exist just like the Whole natiom of America withput its citizens it doesnt exist. We the people who work pay bills and give money to the government and other companies are what keep it running.  So technically speaking if we stop shopping then they go put of business. Bit, This hurts my heart been a lpng time fan of ASUS and Jay ypu are nearly the entire reason i built Full ASUS PC minus the GPU Fans RAM and storage. I have been experiencing Overvoltage and high tempa on my X-570F paired with my R9 5950X.  Wonder if they'll fix the issues before they lose all of their customers😂
6/7 months ago I was building a new custom computer and I was a Asus die hard fan I bought the top of the line Asus micro atx board and it just won’t power on I swapped power supplies and CPU’s and ram in the end it’s the motherboard and Asus won’t do anything about it. I’m so pissed that I haven’t touched the build since. I’ll have to just get msi or asrock now. But this is bs!
ASROCK coming in for the play coach
1 way . Stop using their products .
Youll have to fight with humans if you want that not to happen again . Thanks to crypto bull shit . They got the leads and now acting along it .
Assus is on fire.
Glad it's not just me, Asus products specially motherboards or really anything they make is trash. I will never buy their products. This is so funny I too moved to MSI ACE motherboard. This YouTube video sums it all...... so true .... I spent tons on money on Asus trash products ! never again !
This is not new . Its been happening for so long . I remember when i got rog maximus xi code and was very excited to game on it . But when i installed the cpu .with extreme care and didnot check the pins . I got the error code of 99 .. i put out the processor and saw 4 bent pins . What i did was i took some small tooles and tried to fix it my self . I fixed it and its still running . Its been 5 years .
My very first build was planned to be on a ASUS B550m. When I finally had all the parts and nerve-rackingly and gently assembled the system, it did not post. After trouble-shooting with others who had more experience than I did, we were able to say that the motherboard was doa. I switched it out for a GIGABYTE board, and I eventually switched out that m-atx board for an atx GIGABYTE board. Someday when it's time to put this build to pasture, I'll know not to think twice about ignoring ASUS for the next build thanks to this video.
i've been trusting ASUS for years... but here's a question, what would you recommend to replace ASUS?  I see AsRock, but i'm looking for a board that has 2 USB 3.0 inputs on the MB, for case front IO, what would you recommend?
But... Asus is an Ally? 😢
It was never their intention to void warranties. You are just looking at a big cooperation that has several branches that don't know that each other exists.
Jay you are smart enough to know that you can flash a non beta bios for RMA. You are a bit too harsh. And I say that just after I flashed a beta bios that does not keep the voltage under 1.3v. It is rediculous. But hey try the ASROCK mitx board for AM5 and you will turn around 180 degrees back to the premium brand that is called asus.
I got a asus hero viii... got constant stability issues with 5900x and 6900xt, will never use them again... you earned another sub here, keep telling it how it is
Oof, I remember when Asus was the absolute best computer company around (maybe except some smaller niche companies) sad times
Had Asus in all my life, PC and laptop too, my last build was a full Asus TUF setup a few months ago (I technically replaced everything from PC case to headphone to TUF brand) and everything works fine and actually never had problem with them. It's sad to see how others, especially influencers get failed products. Not gonna build PC for a few years and prob don't need any PC accesories either, but I hope by that time I need it, Asus fix these so I don't need to shift to another brand.
What mobo brand you guys recommend?
Thats why I always have and always will run..MSI!!
I am wondering if your stance has changed at all since ASUS just announced that their warranties for their motherboards now cover beta bios due to the outcry.
The reason the bios is still under testing is we the consumers are the final testers.  If this fixed the issue, they pay themselves on the back. If it doesn’t the void clause protects them so they can fix it more.  Screw you ASUS
Isn't Asus the parent company of Asrock?
Amen Brother. But i hate msi from years back so what brand do you recommend? not doing gigabyte for same reasons as msi.
Just had a problem with my ROG laptop,  it was working perfectly fine not a single problem, but i`ve remeber gaming center and i say`d uu nice let me install it, after i did that the fans on my laptop went haywired.  The problem is now when i`m gaming the fans are in idle and if try from gaming center to put them on auto  they stay idle only if i put them to the max they are starting and staying at max after that i can`t put them back on auto or 10% or anything.  Asus told me to send the laptop for repairs and ofcourse i need to pay..... It just dosen`t seem faire laptop was working perfectly i`ve installed theyre software and ups i need to send the laptop for repairs....  not gonna buy another asus product.
That's one of the things that I admire so much about you Jay, you stand by your values!
Asus don't care but I do, bye bye Asus, not buying junk from you anymore.
When making new software you make the ALPHA versions where the code is buggy and initial in-house tests are made. When those initial tests are made and PASSED, you make a public pre-release and call it BETA acknowledging the software MIGHT still have specific issues, but it has been pre-test so it won't do catastrophic damage. If you are making software and releasing to the public, which will void your hardware ongoing warranty while trying to fix a crisis, and the software update is not fixing the crisis problem and still has the potential catastrophic damage, then you are not helping and making things worse, even you can argue you are making a trap to exempt you from responsibility.  It's been many years I've not used ASUS since they focus on esthetics and brand name, not durability or resilience. So I'm not surprised this is happening. I'm surprised it took this long to happen.
The thing about ASRock is totally true... They used to be a garbage company that offered basically nothing worth your money. These days, everything they make is pretty nice. Phantom Gaming Mobos and GPUs are plenty Decent and higher-end Taichi Edition products are pretty amazing.
its sucks hearing asus is dropping the ball hard, wish i knew to avoid them before building my pc last year
Can I has some free stuff…I need a gpu and I’ll take you Asus stuff too please thanks
hey dude, I'll take those boards off your hands since you're sick of the issues...I love DIY's hacking.
Makes me worry about buying the rog ally maybe I should get a steam deck 😩
Gosh that sounds like fun; spend few k on a build only to have the core component grenade the entire system. I have an ASUS ROG laptop that's been "oK", but I will not be replacing it with another "Like" model when the time comes. Thanks for the info and warning.
sounds like apple and rockstar.
I have an old Fatal1ty 990FX motherboard that is still going strong as a shop PC when I upgraded to AM4.   Used to love Asus products. This is sad.
Good to know. I was about to spend money on a ROG motherboard. I guess never more.
Couldn't have said it better myself. These past few years, their CC has gone out the window.
Thank you for this invaluable info, as I too have lost faith in Asus as a consumer friendly company. And thus, I will no longer use their products and similarly have no faith in their ROG ally either.  Forget Asus, will be looking for another company for my pc needs.
Jay, I think you're experiencing an Asus problem rather than AMD problem. I bought a z690 plus wifi d4 mobo, just like the one you have on the desk, and experienced exactly the same problems as you are doing now. Tried different bioses, ram settings, and god knows what else but the problem persisted. After a couple of weeks I threw it out and got a MSI one instead which has been rock solid! No more Asus for me, ever.
Tbh they are the best you can get still... Gigabyte is a shitshow and msi makes shit products... Evga doesnt have shit anymore...
5:20 Don't worry Jay, you broke the 4th wall the second you looked in the camera at the beginning of this video lol.
This video makes me regret getting a Asus board for my ryzen 5800x build last year. Should have went with an alternative. 😢 I'm still happy with my Asus GPU :)
This is all disheartening, I used ASUS since I started building PCs in the late 90's. To hear all this shows me they gave up quality for cash. They are just now floating on a name and not the quality they used to have. Shame on ASUS for failing their customer base.
So yeah, what are you doing with your old Asus stuff? Mind sending them to the Netherlands for an awesome project?
I stopped ASUS long ago also.  They are just not trust worthy
1.3mil views in 6 days, at the end of the video Jay said "but you don't care..." they're gonna care when all the people Jay literally helped get into tech start boycotting their shit.
Shows character - well done.  Funny - apart from my first Asustek motherboard (I'm sure it was a super seven, which cost an arm and a leg), I've always had much better luck with Asrock products.
Where is the Asus router business heading? There is so many fail brands with routers, and Asus had a steady period at least.
What does a $1000 motherboard get you that a $250 board doesn’t?
i have the, msi unify x570 i really like it.
Yah, my main system is an Asus Rog Crosshair Hero VIII and has had major issues with Windows 11 22h2 and tpms. With Windows, AMD, and the board, I am not how to part out the culpability but the issue is that this combo basically makes the system restart randomly 2-5 times a day every day. Sucks so bad.  Also, ASUS isn't the only board brand I have had several issues with lately. Gigabyte is literally just as bad.
I was building computers using Gigabyte and Msi mobos from 2002.  Then bought Innowative Asus Laptop with Ryzen 1700x - Strix Gl702zc- it broke down after 1 month.  And after that moved to Strix z370 i-gaming itx setup- lasted mere 2 years before complete failure.   So I bought the cheapest 12gen Gigabyte B660m mobo and it works like a charm with I7 12700 ( restricted to 120w)  Even my ancient buit with Athlon 64 on Gigabyte board still works !  I'll never go back to asus
This is HUGE!  (I also didn't realise that your channel has almost 4 M subscribers. Kudos to you, Jay (and the team).)
Uh, how do you "hide [something] behind the freedom of information act".  That makes zero sense.  Also, that act (see FOIA.gov) is about making US government information for US citizens, not about product recalls from a computer component manufacturer in Taiwan.
These guys are destroying their brand.  The shareholders should be livid and sue
Most of my build is Asus. This is a little heartbreaking, but oh well.
consumer rights and protection can't be voided by a sign or warning  those stickers that say "warranty void if removed" those dont mean anything when the consumer protection "right to repair" exists and so on.
I found this channel trying to avoid channels shilling bad products. I'd always worried the rapid growth would entice bad practices in an otherwise proven channel. This has instantly dispelled those concerns. Perhaps ASUS should take notes, as much as you might do the right thing (though I don't think ASUS do) without communicating that to the public how are we to know. Plus hopefully this backlash can help spawn some actual change from what seems to be a deep mindset of complacency and bad practices to me. I support this move, to me the integrity is a huge part of why I love the channel.
Guys Gigabyte! Gigabyte has the best, and I mean BEST support I've ever had! I'm not affiliated with Gigabyte whatsoever but in the future I'll definitely only go for Gigabyte.
I bought only ASUS motherboards to date. The prices are now absurd, the features skimpy, and now this. Yesterday I said no more Apple accessories, today no ASUS.
I have an asus z790 hero board..absolutely worst board ive ever had. Hard to go somewhere else since i wont buy MSI anymore either.
Ive been with Asus for years but I do recognize that volt issue on ofe my boards and I trust Jay. So is Asrock the new top brand for motherboards?
What about the Asus x570 prime
Hey there, this comment will probably get lost in this sea of comments, but I'll try nonetheless. I was planing to buy the Asus pro art b650 creator mainboard...should I switch or stick with that?
My word! That's just crazy!!
This is a little concerning considering they are about to release a major handheld that has a lot of hype, and is probably going to sell well. Support is going to be what makes or breaks the success of the Ally. It's a big part of what made the Steam Deck so successful.
System builder here. Stopped using Asus anything 15+ years ago - MSI/Gigabyte motherboards and graphics cards ever since. 250+ computers built, zero (as in 0) RMAs.
Also we NEED to stop buying things made in China, the stuff made there has no quality control and is substandard compared to items made in Japan, Korea, Taiwan.  Made in USA would be awesome to see!
Bye bye asus, I am not buying your stuff anymore and I am passing that information on to others.
Thankfully the few Asus items I've purchased have worked, recently I had a friend have some issue with a motherboard as well. I've been MSI/Gigabyte for a while especially since Gigabyte improved their build quality around Ryzen 2000 series.
I hope Asus can fix their image. I have only used Asus boards since I started building my own systems in like 2005.
Asus is all made in china now it sucks
What about the asus 4070 dule
My last two Asus ROG boards had crazy ass problems with bios. Seems all the Asus boards have some type of boot issue dealing with bios. My last build which was the 3900x - x570 era was a rog hero board that ended up not being able to keep time at all. Im never buying an asus board again. I went intel this build . Sad because us old school pc nerds remember when ASUS was the cream of the crop and very expensive. I honestly think EVGA took the throne from ASUS some time ago.
Yeah, it's a shame, I've been an Asus fanboy since 2017. I will be looking at other various companies and not be attached to a certain brand, especially for motherboards.
As someone who has had to deal with the ASUS customer service (or lack there of) for a repair to a faulty GPU, I can say I will never purchase their brand again for any reason.  I get how sensitive components can be and that they have safety measures in to protect themselves from fraud, but the burden of proof was too much on my end to prove that their product was faulty.  In the end I couldn't 100% prove it was the GPU, and they wouldn't budge and provide any type of repair without me paying for the MSRP cost of the card (2080ti).
They can’t beat the awesome valve community support the fact that they listen to their audience and push out patches  like everyday it seem like. Bro even partner up with I-fixit like nobody doing shit like this….Deckyy for live 🥷🏾
We are now seeing the fall of a Mobo manufacturer, which is so sad. Asus has been a trusted brand for years. Such a shame!
I've also experienced their nonexistent support for X79 motherboard repair. They suck so bad now, Good call. We should all stop buying their stuff from now for years.
TL;DR please?
Damn, wish I had seen this news a couple weeks ago. I just bought one of their morher boards. Not one of the ones in question but still. As an avid tech supporter/ enthusiast I'd rather not have supported them and gone with something else.
It’s great that you’re standing up against ASSUS but I doubt they’re going to resolve their issues and regain people’s trust anytime soon.
High time. I during last year I build around 2 dozens high performance workstations based on X570 and more recently X670E ASUS motherboards. I had a moral hangover but these were closest to the specs I desired. But that ends now. ASUS is no longer trustworthy part provider (they previously lost my trust when it comes to notebooks).
Yesterday something got corrupted in my PC and an attempted reset failed. I have a ROG Crosshair VIII Hero. If anyone has info please leave a message.
After my experiences with my current (and last) Asus mobo, I'm done with Asus.
Three months before this video, despite being an ROG fanboy with a ROG edition Lian-LI PC-011WGX etc,  I was finding it difficult to choose between a MSI 4090 laptop, and an Asus 4090 laptop, I went with the Asus one, beginning to think that laptop is going to be the last bit of Asus hardware I buy.
ASRock has been aggressively improving their stuff for over a decade, and ASUS has been slowly declining for longer than that. I jumped ship a long time ago.
Built a PC 2020 and used mainly ASUS parts and it's the first PC in many many years I've head no issues with (so far). Now if I would build a new machine I'd prolly jump back to MSI. Sad but true.
glad i stumbled across this video. Been using Asus products 20+ years, never had any issues. I just completed my latest PC build using the Asus ROG strix Z690-E gaming wi-fi motherboard a month or 2 ago. haven't had any issues except playing one game, star citizen. a few crashes and a couple blue screen fails. I contributed that to the game being perpetually in alpha. But now i'm wondering if I should be concerned about the motherboard after watching this video. should I replace this motherboard with a different brand out of caution???
I haven't got a chance to test out my ASUS motherboard since I still have it in its packaging, but once I get all my parts ordered one-by-one  due to budgeting, I can finally run a test or two and make sure the BIOS is updated.  Mine's on a 3rd gen/5th gen, so maybe ASUS did put out a firm grip on those.  But for 7th gen?  Like bloody hell!
That is one hell of a statement to make. IMHO this is why you have dedicated, loyal followers. Hats off to you mate.
Asus Can Suck One. I bought a brand new laptop and it would not turn on after 2 months. They said send it in and once fixed, they wanted $500 to return it "fixed" which all they replaced was a bad battery. They said we made the battery go bad as it showed possible damage from a high volt change. All my PCs are run through or charged through an APC battery Backup. Asus is done and will never be bought by my money ever again.
I have a 13700k with a asus prime g690 and i have not had any issues yet but i dont over clock or anything i guess and i never used asus i always had a msi board but i wanted to switch to asus because the white board i bought matched my case lol
All they need now is a woke ad and they'll disappear forever 😂😂😂
After seeing this I would never consider buying an ASUS product in the future.
I really love your channel. You always put out such great info!
I have no doubt all of this is authentic, but ... wow, when you said around @2:00 that "I have no idea where to start," you weren't kidding!  You didn't actually start for another half minute, then each thing you brought up, you kept repeating things and saying how unhappy you were, I feel like this video could have been 5x shorter.  I gave up halfway through, but what I picked up 1) there was a bios that could cause overheating, you weren't happy that the fix came out as a "beta" at first, 2) there was a manufacturing issue that caused a board recall, you worried that they didn't proclaim it loudly enough in fear that a retailer would still sell a bad board after the start of the recall & consumer wouldn't be able to check themselves (though you gave no example of this happening), and then I think it gets into generic stability issues? Again, may all be authentic, but I'm off to see if there is another source that is more direct & concise. But perhaps the weirdest thing is, are talking about all these things that you say have been going on recently, but when I search your feed for "ASUS" the previous most recent thing I find is 8 months old.  So either you are saying you worry about consumers getting these products that they don't know about recalls etc, but YOU ARE YOURSELF NOT POSTING VIDEOS ABOUT THOSE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS WITH THE NAMES IN THEM SO THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT FROM YOU, or this is all third hand, save for the bent pin motherboard (meaning you personally had problems with only one of the that stack of products you received from them?) or this is possibly year old experiences that you just decided to share now (and the supply of new boards that you are declaring you will stopped accepting, actually dried up the middle of last year?)
Oh cool. After nvidia I will not buy Asus until something changes. Thanks Jay to help us sort out these companys who want to screw customers because they think they are so mighty and big that they can get away with everything.
I've actually had a pretty good experience in my one time RMAing an Asus product but this is worrying
Dodged a bullet! Was going to do an all white asus build! Thanks for the info Jay!
I wish companies were sending me hardware also :) I understand your point Jay. I hope that won't create issues with another companies you work with  :( Keep the good work :)
The immediate like was for the "Solid as an Asrock" pun
I know what asus did is grubby but you can also not use the bios that voids your warranty plus its not just asus boards roasting themselves all of them are.. along with pretty much every AMD cpu.. the only constant across these boards killing themselves is AMD, doesnt matter if what board you buy for AMD atm it has a chance to destroy itself.. so the recommendation should really be dont use EXPO or dont use AMD
I have a ROG Device name	DESKTOP-QECO8QT Processor	AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor                4.05 GHz Installed RAM	16.0 GB Device ID	AE4865D3-DEE9-4CAD-8CA5-98234A12BF0C Product ID	00325-96331-74343-AAOEM System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor Pen and touch	No pen or touch input is available for this display, With a  nvidia geforce gtx 1650 4gb
Steve ( @gamersnexus ) did an amazing job covering the latest fiasco. As you said, I really hope ASUS gets its act together. This sort of MBA-style save on costs/customer support short-term thinking really doesn't do them any favors among the community in the long-term.
Lmao one white guy Vs multimillion dollar company
The lack of the ASUS channel in the comments is telling.
My first gaming pc was a asus, worse buy I ever made. 2 months an the computer took a dump. Sent it in under warranty, got it back in way worse shape. thank you for holding them accountable👍
jayz just sent me all the asus. i need a new cpu -_-
Hey ASUS are you watching this and doing damage control?  Or are you that cluless?
This is the kind of stuff that finishes companies.
I wish that I had watched this before purchasing my last motherboard. It is absolutely rubbish for the price. No digital error code device only being a small part of the problem, if what I'm hearing about them is anything to go by.
Thats why I switched to lenovo legion
ASUS: Well, what do we do next to expand our brand? I know! I'll get Dylan Mulvaney on our next promotional, with the new "Pink" series!
I'm personally with Gigabyte since 2008.   I bought a 7950X3D recently and then the "burn thing" started in the media. I was literally looking for BIOS updates on the Gigabyte website every day since then. Meanwhile, I envyed the ASUS users since they got a "fixed BIOS" days before Gigabyte reacted. But when I hear this story (pure horror, guys ... the stuff is not cheap, we all know), I'm glad I was with gigabyte and that they did not rush the update the way ASUS did.  What a ride!
For more than 10 years I have been using Gigabyte MB and GPU (6-7 gen or more) for fair price and i NEVER had a problem with it, NEVER. Now i'm using gigabyte monitor for very good price and it is GOOD, no issue at all. How this Asus, having price more then Gigabyte, can be WORSE than gigabyte?!
I have bought Asus MB every two years (approx) since  2009 and never have had a problem with them but watching and listening to you will make me think that I should maybe try a different MB manufacturer. Thanks for the heads up. Keep smiling.🙂
FINALLY! Someone slaps in the face this fucking company! I always hated ASUS for overprices piece of sh*t!
lol, linus says "buy it" ROG Ally, but JayZ says "no more asus!". I guess Linus Tech Tips sold out for the moneys 8)
well said............. i could put up with a company that 1 in every 5 products is defective but overnights a replacment. gives you a discount/ voucher. sends some merchandise..... you talk to a actual person on the other end of the phone........   ASUS : you got a problem its your fault, sorry you had a defective board. looks like you'll have to buy a new one.
I am already long gone from Asus products, no thank q, your overprice never fits your performance.
Great call out Jay. I've always used ASUS MoBo's, and currently use an x570 ROG Crosshair VIII Hero with a 5900x and have been totally happy with it. I WAS thinking of going with 7900x and a similar MoBo, but after hearing all this crap coming out of ASUS, which I find an unbelievable disgrace, I won't be using ASUS anymore. This BIOS thing is a complete joke, on us! Steve said it right - SCUMBAGS!
They went down hill since x99 garbage
I think people should also stay way away from the Ally too with this type of anti-consumerism.
I really like Asus products. But the last time a got a product it was the 360Hz monitor and it had the cashback promo on it.. Did the promo and the money should be transferd within 90 business days... two years later NOTHING.. Been emailing them twice and still NOTHING.. In my eyes thats a scam.. cant support that. And for that reason, im out
if only few customers suffer from this by  updating their bios without reading the terms carefully, that's another story
MSI rules
which among this 3 would be the best next in line to asus? msi, gigabyte, asrock?
so my next build with nVidia 5xxx and AMD 8xxx will not have any Asus parts.. I guess.
I have 0 components from ASUS lolololol. Oh no I lied, I have a 2011 Xonar XTS sound card that causes BSOD multiple times a week =) put the card out, uninstall drivers - no BSOD
Day 2 news after Gamers Nexus premier.
I am going to build an Intel 13th gen z790. I have always built with an ASUS MB.....given the ASUS situation....no more! What do you suggest I use? Who is working the hardest to meed the cutomers needs and build a great quality MB? The current market issues have me veryyyy nervious. FYI, I am a retired Engineer who designed and supported manufacturing of multi layer printed circuit boards. I can validate all of the quality issues I have heard being discussed. Lack of prper testing (letting the customer do it for them). Lack of basic quality manufacturing processes like optical inspection to assure parts are placded on the board correctly and that all SMT solder joints are properly wetted. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
I've got an ASUS VP279 which is fairly new yet on occasion will not power up the next time I come to use it. Absolute garbage.
First of all, I absolutely love the fact that you don't preach water and drink wine. You said this channel is consumer focused and hell yes it has been for all of it's existance. Fucking respect Jay & crew. Sad times are these, with all the brands doing whatever they want with the customers. I was a huge Asus fan boy. I've got an 8700k with a Maximus X hero (was around 600$ at the time), an Asus ROG Strix 1080TI, a Rog Swift monitor and a Rog strix scar 17 laptop. The products I purchased 3 years ago are still working flawlessly. The laptop not so much. Will be moving away from ASUS myself when the time for an upgrade will come.
Was hoping for your take on the Asus Ally, guess not...
Their monitors recently have had tons of firmware issues going unresolved, motherboard issues, and this.  I already came to my own conclusion that I am done with Asus in the future also.  Before even seeing this video.
Unrelated rant.   I believe PC gaming wil be dead in the next 10 years.   And console gaming being the prefered platform.   I have held off buying a new GPU for years because I refuse to pay over $ 600 for a mid range card.   Now that prices are some what normal again.. other prices have gone up and buying a 4070 with a mid range cpu is pretty much buying a bottleneck.  And after calculating the best no bottle neck upgrades. I'm pretty much forced to spend a total of 1800 for a GPU, CPU, RAM  and motherboard.    Mean while a PS 5 with 2 controllers and a game cost under $ 700.   I think I'll just step away from PC gaming as a whole. It's a abusive market with degrading quality and rising prices based on artificial shortages.
Oh man, thank God i ran into this video. I was planning to build  a new PC. I was really looking at Asus and guess not anymore. Can you recommend another brand i should go with and worth the money and also reliable pls. Thank you
Wow you really jumped the gun on this one. Dropping Asus just like that. Didn’t even give them a few days to respond properly. You’re going to look like a huge asshole when you come crawling back to Asus. Better stick to your word…
Well done! "Consumer backlash is causing Asus to clarify that its motherboard warranty will still cover the product when running a beta BIOS"
This is a tough pill to swallow but I'm not surprised. Supported ASUS for years but I've noticed creeping issues with them for the past few years and I can't in good conscience support them going forward.
bee bee poo poo computer nerds.
I moved to MSI since the i7 7700k and no ragrets.
ive always used msi boards, theyve been great, bought 1 asus board when i was upgrading my comp (made the mistake of doing pieces here and there as i could afford it) when i finally got all the pieces, it was a little more than 1 month after getting the board so no RMA, its cpu fan header didnt work, as well as 1 chassis fan header, it also had some kind of issue with the mainboard power connector, cause for whatever reason, if you plug in the power and unplug it, it wont work at all (no power) for at least a week, yeah it had issues, so i contacted asus, had it setup to have them fix it, sent it in, they sent it back saying they cant fix the problem, didnt even bother to offer a replacement im using an msi board once again... lol
I've had good experiences with several ROG laptops by now that I'm in the market for another this report gives me pause. My youngest kid is starting college in the fall and will need a new laptop at some point. He has an ROG GU501G about 3 years old and the gtx1060 is starting to struggle with the latest titles. What other brand(s) are higher on the reliability scale now?
Finally ffs. Had similar crap years ago with them  And yes this is about preventing people's houses burning down due to shitty electronics. There are quality standards our markets. It's not what Asus decides it to be. The same goes for customer protection around hidden defects
Agree 100%  It's refreshing to see a channel, like yours, show that they stand behind their beliefs instead of their sponsorship.  Kudos!!!!
There routers are garbage. If you update, your going to end up with software that makes your router a brick, until you reset everything.
Sir, I'm jealous of your Hair - drops mic
I loved Asus, I had 2 Asus laptops in the past and they are solid picks in terms of quality and value. But now seeing my beloved brand to fall so disgracefully, it's very sad
The fact I bought a decent gaming laptop from eBay I expected better. Was like I need more ram for gaming. As soon as I installed it I dropped from 3200mhz to 2400mhz. Now I would need to rewrite the bios just to adjust the speeds back. Was disappointed with this.
Does this affect older B450 boards?
I’m not sure why this is coming so late – I have been experiencing this with Asus going back to the early 90s.  Their production quality, design elements, presentation, technical implementation, materials selection and design focus are so inconsistent that it’s difficult to believe it’s anything more than a shelf label used by a stack of disparate OEMs.  The only element I’ve seen consistency (though not perfect by any means) has been networking – but every other space I’ve had involvement with has had major problems.   In the early 2000s I realised – I’d had 20 Asus boards and only two of them hadn’t failed in some capacity….  Their higher end gear is often the worst actually.  Complete abandonment of product lines after one driver generation following expiration of a series or model has been so normal that it’s affected their 2nd hand component value in the past, it was downright dangerous to buy Asus unless you were happy to suffer through ancient drivers and firmware that gave you obscure and unnecessary problems in operation. I’ve found the odd gem in their lineup – their early work in netbooks was also not perfect but  class leading and they were making some good laptops about 10 years ago but overall – unless they’ve made something that’s unusual for the brand they’re just far too dangerous to buy. In short – it’s a brand I’d recommend to any of my competitors.
Good video. Thank you
I have a Zephyrus G14 that has factory installed liquid metal. Over time from it being in my backpack has leaked onto the motherboard and the RAM slot and killed my laptop. And of course its out of warranty so they wont help me unless I want ship it back to them to pay a near $100 non refundable Diagnostic + what ever its going to cost to repair/replace the board. So until I can come up the cash I have a useless brick of a laptop and ASUS wont help till they get more money. It's very frustrating cause I use my Laptop everyday at work and at home.
interesting.
這裡有台灣人嗎？
My asus board still has usb issues and every tenth boot i have to unplug and replug my kb and mouse. Happens with multiple kb and mouse brands.  The rgb lights on the kb mouse wont even light up.  Drives me crazy.
In december of 2021, I have purchased an asus keyboard, mouse and headset. The highest quality they can provide. The most expensive one too. The keyboard stopped working after 3 months. The mouse stopped working 1 month later. The headset became unusable 2 months later. So in 6 months I have slowly lost over 500 bucks....
But the scar 18 is still good and if u face any issue with it, they inwstantly reply and send help in 3-4 days
I returned my ASUS-MB for an MSI MB that I'm in love with. Everything about it is a better experience, even the thumb pins for for M.2 drives with large heatsinks work much better with the MSI build. The software is better, and more responsive. I have everything overclocked. I have my 13700k at 5.8 stable, and my 4090 is just stupid oc'd. You'd think I was using a Jayztwocents cooling solution it's running so fast.
If that computer burns down the house they are liable for every bit of the Damage Done. If anything happens to my $10,000 system you bet your ass I will be suing
So does this mean my graphics card I bought from asus a couple years back is a but on the lower quality side?
Everyone needs to contact your local district attorney they can direct you to the Consumer Fraud Department of each of your States and everyone needs to file grievance against this company
I have always been a fan of theirs and bought every one of my motherboards from them never again they can burn in hell
I switched over to MSI
You couldn’t do something like this in Australia. They’d get flayed against the wall in the court room.
Ive been building my own since the late 90's and ASUS MB's were my go-to. I built a PC for my wife last year and after a few weeks it started having issues. I troubleshoot the issue to the MB, and RMA'd it to ASUS. ASUS then claims I damaged one of the rear USB ports on the board and accuses me of damaging the board. I know for a fact I didn't damage the port because nothing was ever plugged in the the USB ports on the back of the desktop. After going back and forth with ASUS, I cut my losses and will never do business with ASUS again on any product. I can see now Im not the only one having issues with ASUS
*stuff* lol 🤣
When the XP series AMD CPU's came out, ASUS was trying to go big, but they really dropped the ball for my companies customers, and my friends that tried their stuff around that time. I know I'm going way back... But, when someone burns you and you feel it was wrong, you tend to remember! And sadly I have felt they haven't changed much at all other than users sorting out how to make their stuff work, and while ASUS has truly improved, but so has the industry! Granted, I own some ASUS stuff, but I'm not boasting about it and telling friends and family to buy their stuff because... Things! :P I really do like their higher end stuff, and their detail on looks is awesome in most cases. Still just a sting that never left about this company for me. Ooof, and then he brings up NewEgg lol Just another shitshow now...
I got a older Asus crosshair vii hero with a 1800x 32gb ram and a 1080ti. I had problems for some reason running  my ram at full speed. Started getting ram problems where it wouldn't all show up sometimes the gpu wasn't recognised, other times it wouldn't boot due to no SSD. After doing a bios update it at least boots but games ect crash after about 5 mins of doing anything. Sometimes game crash other times full on uncontrollable system shut downs.. gonna change board I think see if that helps.
All these 3rd party Taiwanese companies operate the same way and offer the near same exact products as their competitors. ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, Asrock, are basically offering the same exact shit. Best you can do is stick with one and hope for the best. Ive been usijg Gigabyte since 2004 but i can see the same type of BS marketing ive been lucky to have only had one RMA for a $800 GPU that they couldnt really deny, whether they believed it defective or not and they definitely tried to but i wouldn't accept no. Besides that they've been great but I've seen the horror stories.
You better be careful! Asus has deep pockets, I assume deeper than yours but maybe not. They don't have to be right to bankrupt you in a defamation lawsuit.
Well, I gave Asus a solid chance. I was hesitant. And the motherboard was essentially free.. But my Z790 Apex is absolutely flawless. Great motherboard!
Using Steel Legend Asrock..!!! letsGOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Always got Asus for my builds... but I will look other options for the next build.. or wait until this blows over in next gen.
wait, so what's going on? I saw videos (just titles, watching this as the first) mentioning the brand.. so now I'm curious
Same issue with the laptop motherboard, suddenly stop for no reasons
Did not expect to see the pins smashed. I was like . Not even chinese brands from Aliexpress do that. Shame ASUS.
So Asus is giving out the AAA game developer treatment. Release a broken and unfinished product with false promises of fixing it with updates later.
This makes a lot of sense now...I vowed to never use AMD again because my 5800x was so terrible, completely unstable with RMA, could only use 2 sticks MAX at 32gigs. I had the same USB issues though as you with my web camera and mouse/keyboard I did however have an ASUS B450F gaming motherboard....Now all this makes sense.   I switched to a 13700k with a DDR5 z690 ultra from gigabyte and its been amazing.
i have same issue with rog z790-E all USB reset for 3-5sec and all sound setting change to default setting not sure why
I quit buying ASUS Mobo's since 4th gen.  To many failure's and way over priced.
ASRock more affordable and offer premium features, their bios also beautiful and easy to use, owned 3 Asus previous chipset boards and 2 of them died
I gave up on Asus over 20 years ago, every time I ordered a board or a graphics card it was always DOA straight out of the box, this happened multiple times. I switched to Gigabyte motherboards and a Sapphire Video cards and have never once had any problem in over 20 years of using them. I do understand others have had issues, but so far I have not.
I''ve still never had a problem with Asus. lol
Boohoohoo.... Why buy AMD stuff anyway...? Z-690A WiFi DDR5 (for Intel) here... no issues at all Asus has never given me issues, never.
On the second board was it fuzz or bent pins?
Newegg is still doing that. I've bought three GPU's from them in the past and each time they were used and in different packaging yet it was advertised as brand new.
Asus has been my go to board for yrs.  A few yrs. ago I noticed sound cards, etc. didn't work well.  Terrible drivers and they never got better.  Used their DVD players which broke down within a yr.  My previous board never got several things to work well.  My current board Proart-x570 Creative has been out for a couple yrs. and just recently got the usb to work decently.
Msi gang gang rise up 💪
I've had similar experiences with my Asus 790e.  Stability issues, losing just game audio, etc.  I thought it was just me...wow
Let me get that white board i will fix the pins
Hey Jay....not sure if someone else mentioned this, but have you gathered up all of you stock of ASUS AM5 motherboards and returned them? Great video. I had problems with their motherboards back in the early 2000's. Switched to MSI products. So far no issues.
even trying to claim the gpu bracket that was promised with their 3080 strix was a nightmare.. not a single response or update on their portal.. will never buy asus again.
Yikes!  I've been an Asus motherboard fan for 20 years.  Where do I go now??
I know this is really offtopic, but what is that megaman-ish box in the background?
I’m new to this and almost like 3-4 months ago I bought an Asus laptop with all AMD, do I have to worry about anything??
Well for years I am using Asus Hardware since my first Asus GTX 660Ti. But if thats all true I really need to think about a new brand to invest into.
that is "alpha testing" not "beta testing"
I have heard that ASUS is the largest computer manufacturererer.
my friends asus monitor has a dead pixel and my walmart ONN one has been perfect lol
I have an ASRock 11th series for Intel MB and I haven't had any issue with that. I'm so glad I didn't go Asus
give away the ASUS stuff
My last Asus product was a Maximus VI Hero. Glad I moved to MSI for Z390 and AsRock for my new Z790 build. Sad to hear a once great company turn into a dumpster fire.
I mean i'm not super neard to tech but this si good to keep in mind if ever need to buy a new GPU in the future.
I'm with you on this! MSI all the way.
Me: wow those ASUS mainboards look awesome Also me: can I have one of the budget ECS please?
Microsoft needs to hold developers accountable for equipment tests and updates, right now it’s the Wild West. They will put anything out there and say well we’ll get around to fixing ur 4000 paper weight
Makes sense, I’m on the 4th build I’ve done in 3 years and I this is the first time I went with MSI for parts
I have had nothing but trouble with my gaming pc, only a ur old. Mine always comes from updates that are done stealth or as a complete update and my memory crashes. My last crash my dorm slots to both through an error. I shut it down, got my series x and my new MacBook Pro with the m1. Turned my pc on to try to run a new wind install and after 2 months it started up with zero issues. I’m done with pc. They are simply money grabbing, show by stupid equip launches and mediocre improvements. They need a reality chk
You know you screwed up when ppl are recommending Asrock over your product
One! I’ll be resending my ROG ALLY PRE ORDER. TWO! Just got back from a long contract job, guess who will be posting their entire asus rog set up for sale due to these integrity issues?😮 well MSI I hope the 6900xt and 5800X3D work out as a gap filler with your board!💪🤓
I bought a tuf 2080ti 4 months after release. It lasted 3 months, they RMA’d. 3 weeks later got a broken card, RMA’d. 4 weeks later got a card that worked for 11 months. Started artifacting and temps were high. It was out of warranty so I figured “repaste.” Took it apart and it was an obvious mining card with burned heat plate (the copper was almost black) , the paste was powder, missing thermal pads on 4 memory modules modules, and the pads that were on it where the wrong thickness. I took it to a local company to see where the failure occurred. One of the memory modules with missing pads died a heat death. Asus, after 4 emails with supervisors was “f*ck your 1200 plus dollars. Buy a new one.”
1:15 no you dont. Youre just greedy. 10:00 thats normal for Ryzen systems. 11:45 no they dont. Asus products look like crap, especially their laptops and Monitors. Who the hell would ever put Asus mainboards in their PC? It was always Asrock for me since 20 years. But I also dont like how Asrock also became greedy. A good high end board shouldnt cost more than $200. 14:00 wrong, Asrock is amazing since 20 years.
asus started making trash like mouse pads etc. i lost all respect for them. much the same as corsair. made in: (insert slave labour country)
ROG is comparable to Lexux/Toyota or Audi/vw or GMC/Chev Ford/Mazda, same junk- you buy the logo. i would be shocked if any ROG products are superior to any others. if u got money to throw away get EVGA dark for mem oc. there is no debate evga dark destroy benchmarks
JJ needs to answer these questions and problems.
They're focused more on aesthetics than stability and hardware quality. I think i'll move to ASRock next build. I'm a hard core Asus fanboy but.. When it comes to product replacements, it's risky
got an asus h470 prime and 10400f. got full refund for both(yes intel gave me full refund- cpu did not do base specs on the box) and now using b450 tomahawk max- r5 3600 and b550 tomahawk r5 5600 had been using asus sense 2001. rip. ran sli gtx 560's on asus z77-V LK-i5 3570k(back when intel, asus and nvidia offered value.    dont be brand fanbois almost forgot. i bought a G15CK asus Prebuilt with 2070/i7? i think, anyway it black screened out of the box, returned for refund and i'l never buy another asus product.  msi bios alone if you overclock is king of the motherboards. asus bios LULULULUL just horrible
My new ASUS motherboard will only work with certain power supplies, i lined 3 proven working ones up next to test bench, one works another works sometimes and a brand new expensive one doesn't work at all , I've been fighting a case with CCL computers for 7 months for a refund, but they think its fine because it turned on for them, worst motherboard experience ever, been building computers 25 years never seen owt like it
Some butthurt moron: You are fired ! Asus: ok. have a nice day.
Seems ASUSSY.
I have never considered asus as an option. Their after sales service is non existence. Typical Taiwanese style.
Was excited about their new product, Ally, dropping.  Now, not so sure.
As much as I appreciate your videos, this one although has raised some suspicions for me, unfortunately not only about the manufacturers. One aspect that seems to be causing confusion is the who actually fired who situation and why is that relevant. It sounds like Asus did not care enough to renew your contract (and possibly others) and you (and possibly others) are upset about it ;) However, I understand that Asus's quality has been slipping. You and GN make valid points about expecting more care, especially from a premium brand. Nevertheless, I'm curious about the actual extent of Asus's build quality issues compared to other manufacturers. They all have or had their fair share of issues. The statements you've made about Asus's quality don't entirely align with the warranty statistics I've come across. Should I avoid Asus because they have upset you, or is there a higher probability of encountering product issues compared to other brands? I hope you get my point.  Of course the release of the Beta BIOS was a questionable move, but to me it was clear enough that it was a temporary solution - a very stupid one, I agree
Aside from the affected customers having to go through hell...I'm actually glad this happened. It's about that time the big boy brands got a Check.
My 2 builds was on Gigabyte MB. GA-990XA-UD3 (Phenom II 955BE + RX480 giabyte), X670 Aorus Elite (R5 3600 + RX580 PowerColor change for RX7900XT Sapphire Pulse).  Zero problems Phenom II work for today.  Gigabyte motherboards are affected to for this "hot problem" bun not panic and don't lie to customers. Everyone makes mistakes, someone more than other. But it's how you repair it, and act like a man not a coward.
Watching this on my TUF monitor, with a ROG Strix 6650XT and a ROG Strix Motherboard... This will be good...
Pretty bummed to hear about this. I'm a huge fan of ROG, so that's sad :/
I was done with asus after I bought a z390 maxiumus board and it didn't fix in my phanteks evolve x cause because of the IO shield being too big.
Asus are well known for me to be a complete thrash over the last 15 years, mostly in mobile. But still, the most useless and defective company ever is Samsung! Regarding motherboards, 6 years ago I switched from Gigabyte to ASRock. Bought countless ASRock motherboards for countless builds - I have never been so happy with their products! Also over the last month i upgraded my own rig to 7900X, 2x32gb HyperX Fury with Expo 1 at 6000MT, but running at Expo 2 5600MT, just to be sure(a lot lower voltage) at ASRock Steel Legend X670E. I'm a technical artist, i write code and work with heavy 2D and 3D stuff, i game very rarely, Star Trek Online or some old NFS... And this is it
asus is now like the big three, Buy it and its yours . Same with amazon.
all my pc build using asus,start with i5 750 using ASUS P7P55LX, 3 years using and suddenly no display (not gpu problem), build new system i5 4670k using ASUS MAXIMUS VII HERO, never overclock just casual gaming,2 years later mobo died,sent for RMA and 1 year later died again, and from then on, i just stay away from ASUS brand,pay premium price for premium product but got unreliable product, my PENTIUM 4 with BIOSTAR mobo still rock solid till now!!
great, and i just bought a Asus VG279QM Monitor
Wow! Asus has been my first choice (price & features considered) for over a decade. Glad I'm not in the market for a new computer...
Back when I was doing network and PC builds for different solution providers in the city, some of the companies would use AOpen peripherals (network cards, monitors, mice, etc.) because they were cheap.  This crap hardware failed left and right and I would refuse to install the crap on any of my customer's networks.  AOpen was bought out by AOC (or did they just change their name (AOpen Corp.) to run from their horrendous quality reputation?).  To this day, I won't touch an AOC computer part because I know where it came from.  And now, ASUS (a brand that I've never had any problems with but after seeing this...) is being publicly slammed like this?  I'll never touch an ASUS product ever again.  I know the heartbreak and frustration of flaky hardware and I ain't feelin' it.  I guess it's Gigabyte for me from here on out.
I just acquired a 7900x and an asus x670e-e motherboard for my first build ever. I've been buying it piece by piece with my paychecks as I can afford them, and this makes me worried my first build is going to be a nightmare due to manufacturer negligence :(
What a shame. My Z390 worked well so, I thought my next build was a no-brainer for Mobo and GPU. I don't mind leaning to another brand now. Thanks for the heads-up!
ITS AMD:) Using pro ws w680-ace with no issues used Asus bords since 1998 never had board died on me. But i am only using Intel.
I could've told you ASUS was a junk brand 10 years ago.  My msi intel mobo lasted 10 years while my asus amd mobo barely lasted 2.  Not to mention asus gfx cards have some the worst gfx card warp/droop/sag out of any brand i know of.
I was sort of hoping that Jay would end the video by throwing those defective motherboards into a wood-chipper machine just to emphasize his point.  Also, was going to buy an ASUS mesh network system once the prices came down - not any more.
I'm not surprised at all how far Asus has fallen  Back in 2014 I built a rig with their ROG Maximus VI hero motherboard, a $300+ board at the time (Canadian) and just over a year into ownership it fried all 6 of my hard drives, it turned out something on the board had shorted and was sending voltage through the SATA lines.  I was not alone in that scenario, I had discovered 2 other people who had had a similar thing happen with their ASUS boards. Contacting ASUS for help was useless, they refused to help and I have sworn off the brand entirely since.
Could the camera, etc. bug happened because of the 2 chipsets on x670e board? I mean it's kinda new stuffs and one chipset on going though the other one. If you plug your USBs in the first one (by going through the chipsets diagram). Just brainstorming with myself lol EDIT: talking about memory. I have a x670e board too, If I overlock my memory "stable" with no errors running OCCT. If I open 3 browser windows (doesn't matter witch one, edge, chrome) 3 total, the computer hangs then come back, hang, etc... that's a freaking weird bug that I never find out the exact cause.
Wow!  They just released a new firmware update for their “routers” that has closed down my nat.
Thanks!
Such a shame. This tarnishes my fond memories of my Asus  P3B-F i440 BX motherboard I used with a  Pentium 3 550MHz... what a great, rock solid PC that was back in 1999...
hey jayz can you do a video TUF GAMING B560M-PLUS WIFI they have new bios update from march 2023 but i don't if i should update it or not with every thing going on with asus thank you jason
Business wise, making a faulty product, and using that product to test a beta version for free on the consumers WHILE ALSO VOIDING the warranty on that original product is a GENIOUS idea. Its just an asshole idea
Isn't ASRock the cheaper l;ine from ASUS?
This has to be the single most important video you have ever made that has cemented you and your team as "A Class Content Creators". Well done. Subscribed.
way to go by the way us consumers thank you
Asrock isn't the same Asrock 2015 Asrock for 5 or 6 years now. Been pretty solid. I've even talked to their tech support asking about bios features and told me that I can request the BIOS feature and they can customize it to what I want
i have bought two asus gaming laptops since 2017 years apart both were crap hoping to get my money back for this las one maybe
I bought a Zephyrus laptop close to 2-3 years ago, and dear God it overheated like hell. Like, I know laptops are "meant" to overheat and that is usual in that segment, but this one was special, since it overheated badly over doing nothing, and regardless of what I played, it could've even be a paint made game, the thing would just always hit 100c and 87c as if it was nothing, and naturally that killed all the performance from an otherwise capable machine. I sent the laptop 2 times to get fixed by costumer support, which wasn't easy, as I needed to travel to country in order to apply my warranty since I bought it while I was on a trip originally, and the first time they just changed the fan, which made absolutely no difference, so I had to send it again and specifically ask a thousand times for them to double check, to verify, or even change the whole motherboard as the problem was persistent, and... They went, and said they changed the motherboard (at least on the letters that they sent me) and absolutely nothing changed, which makes me even doubt the fact that they changed anything during the time they had the laptop. After that I just gave up, bought a new laptop, and problem resolved. Thing to be said, I bought another laptop from Asus, but this one never have suffered from any overheating problem like the other one, even if I had this one for a long time too. But, surely their costumer service support sucks tremendously
I've had problems with Asus since two gens ago. I bought a motherboard for my wife and it had bent pins on the motherboard. I sent it in, waited forever, and they sent the board back with a "BIOS update" which...I was already on the latest BIOS. They only admitted their fault after I pestered them for weeks and they took it back again. I swore I'd never go back to Asus...but here I am running an X570-e motherboard.  I think if I upgrade I'll go ASRock though. Their Taichi boards are spec'd really nicely and haven't heard of problems from them lately.
Before you buy any product, call their "support" number. If you get anyone other than an American, don't buy that product. You've been warned
I have the Z790 Hero and I can't get it stable.
Sucks. Because my 7970 I got from them was great and my GTX970 was a pretty good sample also. If their quality and customer dervice is dropping though it's a no brainer to move on.
Nice Jay! Big Respect for standing up for us and what you believe. I fully agree with all of it except the Asus graphics cards are decent bit. Remember the Asus Amd 5700 and 5700xt rog strix overheating mess...
Apologies and intentional revisioning of a customer/manufacturer relationship can require going BACK on previous situations and repairing those relationships SUCH that their old valuable relationships can be revitalized and used to regrow that BECAUSE those relationships were such that the brand was nurtured and appreciated.  As a system builder myself, who has previously sold explicitly asus (non-capitalized for a reason), until my own home system failed after purchase, and I spent half a year going back & forth with them trying to resolve the issue, from installing beta bios, to blowing dust out of my system, none of these solutions worked, when a simple replacement to a more modern platform was the practical solution, and would have honestly saved them more money, than the hours I consumed with their incompetent support staff, which converted me from an Asus exclusive system builder, to avoiding Asus, I am unsurprised at this change of allegiance that Jay provides here, though I strongly advise manufacturers to become customer focused, and to avoid what their investors suggest, because they are always focused on the bottom line, because they are disconnected from the support side of almost all businesses.  To keep a competitive and valuable brand, you actually need to ignore your investors on where to invest the money they have invested in you, and instead put that money into value adding activities, such as brand loyalty, which is almost always provided through support and genuine appreciation of their time, by seeing them as a value adding component of your own business.
I don’t even bother with wasting money on the latest gear. You all rabid buying defective garbage is part of the reason as to why businesses think they can skirt on quality.
No more ASUS!!
my asrock b660 steel legend is very stable and works fine. Update: still works fine even after 2 bios updates
When is the class acton lawsuit happening about these ‘warranties’ because I want in
MSI be like 😂😂😂
THANK YOU. I’m glad large influencers have spoken up about this and have been completely honest. I would not recommend their gpus either. I purchased a new one from them going into a brand new build. 3 weeks in I got freezing issues and was  troubleshooting. Finally no signal to the monitor. I’m on my 3rd RMA replacement because every single one has been having the same problems. Ceo also told me via phone that they do not repair these in house which I can kinda understand? But no way I get these replacements which are supposed to be remanufactured certified and they’re faulty. That’s not an acceptable warranty. I have not been given any type of solution even after asking for a refund
Rep's loosing her job lmao.
ASUS the new Apple...
Thats so unfortunate... 😔 I used to love Asus since my first laptop (A3E). Had many of their products mainly because of the bold looks (my laptop ROG G50, ROG phone 1, and some motherboards...), but also because of the so called quality its suposed to have. Ultimately i have to agree with Jay. The more recent products i have from them, the more problems they seem to arise. My last product from them was the Strix 370-i and i still use it in my main computer, but i do well remember the pain it was to get it working correctly with my GPU as it never made it work in PCI Gen3 by default leading to crappy fps in games. Its sad to see a brand that i care so much and had the same "taste" i have go downhill like this, but i hope this is an eye opener to them so that they up their game and sharpen up things. They need to remember that they got into that pedestal because of us, consumers. The minimum they need to do is to respect the ones that make their pockets heavier...  On a side note, Asrock learnt all its stuff from Asus, is like its child, however, they have become better and better lately. That only shows that we can always improve things if we want.
I've been using MSI for motherboards and video cards for years now (after I stopped using them for a little bit maybe 10-12 years back).  I've had nothing but good experiences since.
Nah Asrock, more like Assrot. I got 2 7900xtx from them and they were dogshit. I then got an asus one and it was good.
He'll be back with them in the next 6 months.
NOTE TO ASUS PLEASE ASUS, let us, who are your CUSTOMERS, CONSUMERS, those who "PAY THE BILL" and who are the greatest VALUE OF THIS COMPANY, choose the version we want to install Armory Crate, make available for download the separate versions and clean and let us choose?! Stop treating us like this, we invest in high performance ASUS products for work, study, games, entertainment and we want to have the POWER OF CHOICE and not be treated like mobile device users, where they update and install without choice, please stop it and pay attention to us!!! It will be the downfall of this company if they continue like this, we have always been supporting and we want to be proud to use ASUS again!!! Come on Asus!
I'm with you. I'll never buy an ASUS product again. Gigabytes don't f it up!
ASUS is a Taiwan company. Maybe they were sabotaged by U-No-Hoo.
Oh no!! I use a Scar 15 daily that I got last year, and I wonder what I'll do going forward. At least I'll never buy another ASUS product again. Going back to Acer, and MSI...
Shit, i just bought an asus monitor and Asus GPU like a month ago :/
Damn most of my products including my wifi metwork are Asus. Guess i have to shop another brand.
This hurts to watch. Thank you for the honesty. I have been buying exclusively Asus machines since 2007 and never had an issue despite hard use, OC, and mild abuse. My current build is still Asus... but my next one won't be. Gotta take down all the RoG stickers I guess.
I have an asus hero board as well and I can confirm that it’s pretty much haunted. Nothing game breaking like Jay but the ghost pranks me randomly
Bought a G14 and it lasted a whole year and a half before the motherboard randomly died (6 months out of warranty) and was completely out of luck. Worst part is asus refused to even look at it because it was purchased as bestbuy. Definitely not buying any of their trash again if this is how they treat people
Nope, no they arent, and you will continue to use their products.  I know this because you and I both know compared to AMD and most INTEL mobo platforms they are the superior product.  SO stop your bitching and just admit that you will continue to use ASUS.  please....
I have been having great look and a great time with MSI boards lately. I don't even mess with ASUS anymore.
Thank you for this PSA. Asus was my favorite brand and I'm glad I didn't buy any computer part since 2019 so I avoided the decline. It's been real Asus.
Hey Jay, a couple years ago i bought an ASUS 27inch ROG Monitor which was really expensive. The First one had Pixel errors around the Screen. The Second came with a yellow Stitch on the Screen. Number 3 was ok, after 3 Weeks he began to flicker. That was the Time for me to say "No more ASUS". There is no Quality Control... nothing. The Support was a piece of sh*t. Since this i use only Mainboards and Graphics Cards from MSI. The Dragon Center (MSI Center) could be a little bit better in my opinion. But the Products from MSI are solid and stable. Greetings from Germany. Christian
Hey Jay, I'm glad you finally spoke out about Asus. I was an Asus fanboy but after the terrible experience with their ROG Phone 5, I swore to never buy another Asus products. The phone only lasted 1 month and I had to replace the motherboard and I was denied any replacement or refund. 98 or 99% of the ROG Phone 5 users had to replace their motherboards and I am not kidding. They didn't even recall or acknowledge the problem publicly, it's still an ongoing issue to this day but no big YouTubers ever covered about this issue. The forum is filled with complaints. They basically forced the phone on me as well as a lot of other customers as even sending a legal notice or filing a complaint in the consumer forum didn't help in getting my refund. Their customer service was a nightmare. Their products are all look but no quality these days. Thank you for being honest with your viewers.
I am confused. Does Jay and others in similiar positions pay for the MB's and other equipment that gets sent to them when Jay sends a request for equipment?
Fire nvidia next please
I had no idea any of these things were going on, but I'm not that deep into PC hardware and just recently started messing around with PC gaming. Regardless, this is very helpful to know before I build a desktop.
Yeah I fired them a while ago and went full EVGA, now they dropped NVIDIA 😵‍💫
I got Asus motherboard Z590-p. Seriously i regret it. The last time i was happy with Asus was the time when they made the amazing legendary GTX 680 OC2. Since after that time it was just a shitty experience with Asus. From personal experience I can say MSI is one of tge best Boards. Fuck u Asus. No hate here but seriously Asus fuck you.
This is very sad to see.  I will not buy there products going forward.  I bout a lot of there boards over the years.
I think the last asus product I got was a gaming laptop that, for whatever reason, was killing hard drives inside it. It's not that I stopped getting their stuff because of that, though, it was more of a coincidence. But it sounds like that purchase I made roughly a decade ago or so was just to be expected.
Just shows how good a company EVGA is compared to most of the rest.
I gave ASUS a chance 2 years ago when I bought a Spatha mouse, and it was a tremendous pile of junk - died after 4-5 months and ASUS wouldn't stand behind their product. I'm just lucky I had the foresight to get the extended warranty from Micro Center.
Crap like this..  is why I’ve vehemently stuck to msi boards.  Yeah, they usually cost more but I’ve never had issues like this from msi.  This.. is simply insane.
I have to agree with you about ASRock and it's reputation of old and it's newer product lines. Last November I built myself a new PC (coming from an Intel 5th gen), after the long wait of crypto, scalping, supply chain, xmp profiles and distributor/vendor nonsense that just made it impossible to build a high end machine at a fair price. I opted for a 13900K with an ASRock Z790 LiveMixer motherboard and it's been perfect for me. I was a bit apprehensive about the board at first because there was so little information and reviews about it, I liked the funky look of the board and the overall feature set of what is essentially a lower tier priced board. It was lacking in the audio department but I intended to use an external sound card anyway and it has a built in port for an internal display which I liked from when I had seen one of Jay's videos about how to include one in a build. In summary, a great, lower cost, stable board with plenty of features to use with the Z790 chipset. I am very happy with ASRocks product which worked as you would expect right out of the box, I think a company who has turned its reputation around deserves full credit and for those that abuse their reputation should be called out and made to suffer for it.
Im running the x3d chips on an old msi board i did a bios update for. I can tell u its most likely asus. Or im lucky😂  I also had to return multiple rog laptops back in the day because they would crap themselves not allowing me to use it for the intended purposed (some rengering i needed for school)
Ive been buying basically purely Asus for well over 15 maybe 20 years now. They are usually a bit more expensive than some other options but they also usually had great vrms. I just looked at the asus offer, I knew their mosfets and powerstages etc so I knew if it was good enough for LN2ing whatever chips ran on that MB. Same went for their GPUs. But after this thats it. Im no longer buying their stuff. Mildly annoying cause I can navigate the Asus bios blind but hey. Like this is almost Apple level of disgusting.
Well, last month I encountered with broken socket LGA1700 after 2 hours of Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero was installed with CPU Intel Core i7 13700K & Noctua NH-D15 cooler. First hour I was looking for a way to load Windows, because one of my discs was in MBR, not GPT, and I last logged into bios 6 years ago & didn't remember about this. 30 minutes after 1st hour my PC was off & at second hour I found how to load Windows, and then, after 3-5 minutes blue screen happened. And two times after resets. And after this Windows didn't load. When I tried to restore system, PC turned off automatically, then I tried to log into BIOS & it started to hang in BIOS. At finish system didn't get commands from my keyboard & I had to urgently remove the motherboard. When i did that i saw damage to the socket tracks in the center right, and my CPU i7 13700K in similary places was damaged. As result - official Asus service in Ukraine denied warranty very fast - at next day after receiving the motherboard, citing mechanical damage to the socket. I had no choice but to agree to a paid repair of socket, but even then I received information from official Asus service about impossibility of PAID repair because Asus doesn't supply sockets to Ukraine. To be honest, i'm sick of it & started yelling on the phone with them. And after 10 minutes I've got a call from their engineer, who told me - We will try to take a request to Asus about supply this socket, but we need to open the socket to see what else is out of order, and whether replacing the socket would be advisable at all. And now I waiting for arriving new socket & the result of the service's work. This is the first time when I faced with this situation. I'm a constantly user of Asus products since 2009 & installed three systems myself & this was the fourth one with top 2 motherboard. And I get this beautiful surprise with a lot of spent money. If service will repair this motherboard, I need to buy a new CPU, beacuse previous 13700K has thermo-electrical damage & withdrawal from warranty of it.
2:13 I think you are over reacting, you need to calm down.   4:08 they fucking said what!!! I am done with ASUS!
Wth Asus? So who's the respected mobo manufacturer now cause I remember having problems with MSI and Gigabyte back when the i7 7700k was the gaming king.
I had added the Asus ROG Ally in my shopping cart on the Bestbuy site and literally had my credit card out when I thought, maybe look at some other YouTube videos that weren’t from influencers.  Nothing but QC issues and dead products within a year.  It shock and change my mind about getting it.    The reviews were lol the same, nothing but raving reviews but noticed a lot of forced product placement of ROG Merch and anything negative about the Ally was followed up by, it’s not a big deal or I’m just being nit picky.  They don’t want to lose sponsorship which why they are saying it.    I wanted something better then the Steam Deck but also don’t want something that’s going to die 6months to a 1 year after I get it.  Holding off for some reviews after long term use.
Respect for coming out , saying as it is and standing your ground!! 🫡
I used Asus ROG for years , up to the ROG Maximus 7 formula z270, then the rgb died on it, so I sent it off for repair under RMA, by far it was the best oc mobo i ever owned and after 4 months they said we cant fix it heres a refund and it was gone, I was so gutted I didnt say I wanted a refund , and actually stated in RMA that I wantewd it back either way, So I  bought a ROG X570 Crosshair VIII Formula and updated the bios, and I was hit with all the same crap as you Jay, its vcollecting dust coz they said I voided warranty with there update they suggested I did to fix issues in a live chat, I have no money to replace it and stuck with a old AM1 MOBO AND A 3 CORE BAG OF CRAP CPU AND 4GB RAM, i AV CRIED COZ I FEEL I WAS SET UP
So true. Please spread the word. Going to be hopping off Asus as well. I have a B550f gaming motherboard and I am pretty sure it will give out anytime soon. Only owned it for about 5 months and put very little load on it as well. No overclocking whatsoever, and yet from the reviews thousands of people have, I can't take the chance.
That is the very good statement, where the ASUS and other brands schould realy think about. That was like getting to the point! Tnaks
ASUS X670E-E WIFI GAMING Board 1st board ended up crashing blue screens over and over. 2nd board NO usb ports worked and M.2 Showed in BIos but not while installing windows. 3rd board same issue No usb ports worked had to use a USB-C hub and then M.2 NVME showed connected in BIOS but not showing while installing windows. Anyone had a similar issue? Its the MOBOS right cant be something else?
I was done with ASUS back in 2018 when I bought a ROG STRIX Z370-H Gaming motherboard... Everytime I turned off the computer, the hysterical loud ground humming sound started to blast from my speakers. Replaced it with a MSI board and the problem was gone.
Do the z370e boards have any issues? My friend is constantly crashing.
ahhh this is like when EVGA kicked Nvidia to the curb.  Sometimes companies need to be kicked in the balls for them to fix their shit.
Wow you don’t buy the products yourself? I thought you were some millionaire do thing YouTube slob and here all you do is beg for free stuff? When will companies realize they can showcase their own products themselves instead of sending them to some hack with a call phone camera and an internet connection? 😂😂😂😂
Is MSI still good?
I have been following your channel for a few years and have enjoyed a lot of the content you have put out. However up until recently you have been an Asus fanboy and have always (for the most part) given a positive review of the their products. You reviewed the last Crosshair VIII Extreme for AM4 and I purchased that board and have no regrets. I built another system for a friend based on your review of the Asus Crosshair X670E Extreme. He wanted the best and after we watched your review and he decided that was the board he wanted. I built it for him and he is using the 7950X and has had no issues. The MB bios was dated last August and was the origianl bios so we flashed it to the 1303 bios and his CPU never has gone over 72c even after hours of heavy use. If you choose to cut Asus out that is your decision. But for a lot of people who purchased product based on your reviews. What are those people supposed to do? Unlike your company who get sent things to review your viewers spend their hard earned money on items and if you stop dealing with Asus then what do all those people do? We have spent money on items in part based on your reviews and now you are done??? Not cool
I own mostly Asus products. But let's be honest, almost all their products and flawed and rushed. My 2016 monitor was hacked together.
Respect for this video
WOW the bent pins got me. I just built a machine with an Intel Asus board, built the computer, got Windows and all my apps installed, and then it just died. Completely died. The CPU light was lit, the device would not boot. I tested everything, finally took out the CPU and BOOM there were bent pins which also ended up frying the CPU.   It was not a fun time. 🙃
I am an IT instructor. I purchased 12 Asus motherboards for my computer repair program and out of the 12 motherboards that we received 6 of them have been warranty replaced for various issues. Would not recommend Asus for anyone.
I bought a b650 e wifi should i send it back?
My Crosshair Dark Hero from ~2 years ago will sometimes forget that it has a second nvme drive.  Sometimes when I'm in the middle of playing a game.  At first I thought it was the drive itself, but now I'm wondering if the mobo might have been a contributer.
As a CEO of a company it was a good y call that the contract was being delayed so much. Very unprofessional by asus
Hey, I had an ASRock mobo for my AMD FX 8370e and never had any issues. I was even able to overclock my CPU :)
我是台灣人,,西元2005年ASUS搬到中國生產後,,在台灣銷售的筆電與PC,,消費者使用不到一年,就常傳出小零件壞掉,,具ASUS離職員工傳言,,2010後公司持續在內部已私下抓了30多位供應鏈管理幹,處理賠償與因貪汙造成產品不良,,根本不敢傳出讓外界知道,聽說這些幹部貪污了合計超過30億台幣,,那推算ASUS這10幾年採購零件約略6000億的零件,品質應是都不會太好,ASUS的產品能讓你使用超過一年沒出事,,是上帝在保佑你
I am so glad to see someone online stating this, I feel that influencers have pushed asus for years and my only experience with them was terrible took over a year to get a motherboard RMA back and will never buy their products again.
Me who just bought a B550-F Wifi 5 days ago:  O_O      :|        >:(
I dont even need to watch this video. I have been working with hardware and Asus since early 2000. I know where this is going. I dont even touch it anymore. Even i was some kind of Asus fanboy back in the day. Good that it finaly goes up a lightbulb for the tech revs to. About time. I have been looking at this crap, and tried helping people with Asus for years
as always jay keping it real and giving us the facts we need to enjoy our hobbie  of gameing and pc building thanks jay & team
I stopped using them last year due to their crappy customer service and not standing behind their products. Horrible company.
Been an ASUS Rampage fan for a while, owned several expensive versions of it. Last year went with GIGABYTE Aorus for my Z690 - Extreme Waterforce build
Had a Asus 1070 OC for 7 years now & it's never skipped a beat. But that was 3 gens ago.
I used my rog strix 2 for many years, its a shame to see the quality went off a cliff, I'm using an MSI board now by chance because It was in my price range. I'm glad I didn't end up in this kinda situation, good luck for those who have been scammed by it.
We've been here before.
Asus Netherlands are just lying scumbags, always bougth asus till last year. They lost a costumer forever
If Asus provided a bios update that void their waranty, then this is by design. They uploaded an update, and because customers trust in the brand and NO ONE would brick their own brand, so the customer downloads and installs the bios update. This proves that ASUS did not want to deal with some of the recalls and by design uploaded an update to brick systems so they could save that money from bad boards. They are hiding responsibility behind the disclosure agreement, no one reads those things. Everyone trusts the updates from the manufacturer. Only a corporate puss would cheat the consumer. Because the consumer is a speaker with which a company grows or fails. You can never get too big to fail. People demand integrity, quality, and strong moral compass. Integrity is being honest with yourself and others without anyone knowing, doing the right thing regardless of the outcome.     While making money pays the bills, you should not comprimise your ethics to make more money. If a company will not stand behind their products then we as customers will not either, and we outnumber you corporate pricks by ALOT, I mean alot, alot, and alot. So when you think you are a big dog, just remember as far as numbers go, you are not even 0.01 of a single percent of your customer base. You are not a big dog. You are not even a puppy.
Built my PC back in 2019, and it almost exclusively consists of Corsair and ASUS parts. Safe to say that any future upgrades won’t be coming from ASUS.
Man… I have used ASUS for my motherboards as long as I can remember. Who do I try out now?
LINUS won't be on top of this due to the $$$$$ he gets from asus for that gaming hand held they're launching. But hes over stretched his business where he can't afford it, even selling water bottles for $70 😅😅😂😂
I got that Z690-PLUS Wifi D4 motherboard for free during the holidays with a microcenter bundle. If I paid for that thing I would be absolutely furious. The ethernet port does not work properly at all, I had to buy a USB ethernet adapter. I installed my old GTX 1070 to carry me over, turns out the PCIE 5.0 slot is not backwards compatible with PCIE 3.0 GPUS. I had to buy a riser card and vertically mount my GPU connected to the bottom slot.
Asus has been off my list for years. I've had 2 motherboards fail from them, and then they refused to honor the warranty. Oh and this is after out-of-pocket shipping costs for RMAs where their p&l warranty didn't cover "physical damage" (their components literally exploding). This was back in 2015 and before, asus being a disaster is nothing new. All in all, been scammed out of well over half a grand.
when you said docp, i heard dohc...
Meanwhile Linus is like "oh no guys its not that bad they didnt mean it when they said they wouldnt honor the warranty. Oh we checked it turns out they do that all the time."   ....yeah confirming thats just the way they manage business isnt a positive.   🤷‍♂️
Been an ASUS fan boy since early 2000s. For my latest build could not wrap my head around the reviews for the ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-G GAMING WIFI and mentions of overheating (thanks for peeps who makes these reviews). Plus the price was over the top, this ROG premium is a joke. Made the switch to Gigabyte zero issues, great system, really happy. Now this drama. lol
I went for Gigabyte for a long time ago. Asus were great but the so-called "Asus tax" puts me off.
I had a short experience with asus some time ago, bought a new motherboard, instaled on the pc, new os, new everything, everything running fine, them i installed the software thingy from the motherboard and the system got a black screen when i tried to close it, them the computer stopped botting, was going to the windows loading and getting frozen, them gradually was getting worse, after this just a black screen after the mobo post, them just a black screen and them no video at all, the gpu stopped turning itself on, i ordered a new cpu to try to update the bios because back them this was the possible problem related to the software, that have rolled back the bios for some reason, the new cpu didn't fixed, ended up discovering that the bios nuked itself from existence and i had a bricked motherboard :3  On this board there was some very loosy capacitors, the usb pins was bent and there was some scratches on the pcb. Rma the thing and got the money back, and never used anything from asus again because the way they was so "no this is your fault" just deleted my trust on the brand.
I got a response for ASUS and this is what they sent   "Hi, Our warranty policy remains unaffected by firmware updates, including the installation of beta versions.  We recommend you keep your system up to date by installing the latest BIOS, including beta versions, to benefit from improved functionality and performance enhancements."  I also see they have removed their "disclaimer" from their BETA Bios within the last 24 hours, any thoughts on this??
I bought an Asus laptop 10 months ago.  I have never had so many issues with a product.  Within the first week of ownership the audio failed completely and I exchanged it for another unit (should have taken that as a sign and bought something different.)  It has died twice since then after automatic bios updates requiring warranty repairs to replace the motherboard.  ASUS was unwilling to even expedite the repair after three dead units and it took weeks to get it back both times.  Never buying ASUS again!
I personally dropped Asus as a brand in any of my own rigs or customer rigs 7 years ago now. The only GPU's I have had die on me or in a customer rig have all been Asus. Their quality started dropping already after Z77 tbh. Lower end boards below ROG were becoming kinda crap compared to the competition especially vs MSI and their strenght in overclocking. I'm not one bit surprised to see this.. Don't feel bad for Asus, they had it coming.
Since the covid fraud I have barely kept up on PC Tech info but had set up a few systems during this rime and had zero issues a d now I know why, they were not Asus but i stead 2 each of MSI and Asrock.  Bloody awesome to see a video like this xalling them out.  Had a thought though, is there any chance they are trying to put AMD in a bad light?
Armory crate.
This goes for me too. I built my system based purely on asus rog 1 and a half years agi and im having issues since with it. I cant even run the docp without havin stability problems. Never changed so im runnin id basis of 2666 MHz and that is annoying because it could do a lot mor. I have problems with the bios software. I have problems with hardware compartibility although all hardware is asus. I im outraged for trashing allmost 5k euro for this rig that runs only on 70% of what it should be. I think ill just go with it until it stops working and than ill trash it for good. Next system will be purely non asus, maybe even as rock. Sotry asus but flashy bling and ROG brand will not do it for my next rig.
It's a shame. I use laptops exclusively. I'd had decent luck with ASUS. Even if their laptops are unaffected, it's such a scummy thing that Asus had design or manufacturing issues that they didn't listen to (or care about) internal voices that pointed out the problems pre release and then are trying to leave customers holding the bag if they try the "fix" and then void their warranty and can't get bad parts replaced.  Their customer service, being fully ni hao, was always horrible. But, at least Asus had a strong and helpful enthusiast community.  This situation and even sending out junk to creators that went from the trash bin to potentially a customer... Asus really is saying they don't want customers.
As a dedicated Laptop user, I have been avoiding Asus for years.
I was literally about to get the 7800x3d cpu sooooo i don't think i'm getting it now.
I almosr bought the ally. No thanks
I have an asus b650a does this mean I should swap it out I’ve updated the bios about 2 months ago after my pc ran like trash for 6 months it’s been great since but since hearing this who knows what’s next
Okay fair. But who do we go to? As-Rock has always had shady non-existent support going back a decade. MSI is sleezy, putting triad branding and girls in bikinis to sell pc hardware and diverting inventory to their in-house scalping operations. EVGA walked away from their whole GPU division with no warning. Gigabyte has had huge RMA issues, losing people's products and massive data breaches power supply fires. AMD is telling us EXPO voids warranties. Intel shipped 13th gens that warped mobos. Newegg is reselling RMAs knowing that they can't be returned.. No ones hands are clean.
Youtubers are doing shitstorms again just to have something to talk about. Waste of time on this crap.
ASUS became evil corporation... So sad...
I'm gonna have a big issues when I need to replace my aging crosshair VI Hero... I used to go to asus not only for their reputation/quality but also because of their BIOS and the features included. 🥲. RIP ASUS
Asus as a major OEM supplier to practically every brand out there.  Good luck, honestly... Rather see trash reviews (honest but fair), than no reviews on what's wrong with Asus. In this case no press, is good press.
I paid 2300£ on a laptop, broke after 1 year and they wanted to charge me around 2000£ to fix it... Fu.k Asus. Scumbags!
This really bums me out because my past 3, high end PC builds were done exclusively with ASUS products and I've had really great luck with everything I used. Granted, I don't keep computer gear around long enough most times to need warranty support, etc - but I certainly don't want to spend thousands of dollars every few years with a company who doesn't stand behind their products or care for their customers.
Msi might not be the best  although very very good and my favorite for like a decade  but they're not assholes solid udates and great overclocking
I always bought ASUS. MSI had a missfire for me 2014 as i was rebuilding my new PC by having a faulty mainboard for me and no one wanted to help. Neither the reseller nor MSI themselves, since they couldn't reproduce the problem (so they claim, but getting a different board fixed the issue of my CPU not getting recognized).  So as i got a ASUS board everything worked and that made me a fan back then. Everything i bought from ASUS always worked.  Recently as i saw how they artificially bumped up the prices for absolutely fuck all reason, i told myself that this will drive me back to MSI which it did. I know have a MSI 3080 TI in my PC and besides the obvious RGB bullshit with everyone having their proprietary bullshit connectors and software, making it hard to sync it, MSI forever will be now my go to for everything.  Hearing this now? It just wants me to get rid of my ASUS stuff i still have in there.
I RMA a motherboard two times and I still think there is a problem with it. It is an x570 board and they keep just updating the bios and sending it back to me because they don't get a problem but it can only be the motherboard or ram and with the USB dropouts and ram not working unless it's in a specific order. I still have random crashes and I have tried the linustechtips forum and I have not gotten any help. I've been struggling with these issues for more than a year.
Yeah im just sticking with my Ryzen 9 5900x and Asus Tuf Gaming X570 in CB r23 mc 22,900 59c top highs with a Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360mm a-rgb rev 4. G Skill Trident Z cl14 3600mhz overclocked to cl14 3800mhz 1900uclk 1900mclk 1900fclk 100% stable and a RTX 3080 XC woot.,
Clapping hands for yourself? You in an audience?
AMD is equally responsible for this mess as is ASUS!! Reviewers should start T Bagging them as well but kudos to start taking steps against such malpractices.
Just remember 5700xt rog strix imagine paying extra for a premium and it being shit!
You also OVER. I love ASUS and you are not.
It's really sad to see Taiwanese companies like ASUS, Gigabyte, and others not doing as well as they used to. The quality of their products seems to be dropping, and instead of admitting their mistakes and fixing them, they're blaming other things. Even when customers call them out, they don't take responsibility. It's disappointing for those of us who have trusted these brands for a long time.
G0atsus
Was the same with Gigabyte before
WOW that was harsh but it has become true
Putting the "sus" in Asus.
ASUS AM5 motherdboards are shit. I have Asus PRIME X670E-PRO WIFI with 7950x3d, 64gb ddr5 (with latest bios 1413). Boot time is ridiculously long, usually around 60seconds. I enabled memory context restore, and ok, boot time is better, but system is unstable, blue screens, failing memory tests etc. I had few other problems, like stutters related to software TPM, I had to disable it.
By enabling EXPO on a memory kit higher 5200 you void the warrenty on your CPU according to AMD. Intel void your warrenty if you enable XMP on a kit higher 5600. So it's not only ASUS who are responsible.
Well, I previously fire NVIDIA.  Now, I’ve just fired ASUS.  Okay, more JTC videos to watch before I settle on new hardware to replace my 2018 premium build.
Unfortunately, the quality of ASUS products has fallen below the floor.
Hey man thank you for educating us consumers.
The day I realised my new Rx 5700XT TUF Gaming had a massive heat problem on the VRAM was the day I decided never to buy any Asus product ever again. I fixed it myself with the fix provided by Hardwareunboxed, but Asus wouldn't even consider sending their customers the new cooling solution of the Evo model. I asked them if it's possible to send me the cooler and they just declined. Awful customer experience.
Suddenly I'm glad the ASUS TüF build didn't work out, probably for these reasons. 😅
Can someone PLEASE bring back ABIT and EPOX mobos back... They where always AS GOOD or BETTER than ASUS ones...
I have nothing but problems with ASUS motherboards, voltage problems, CPU's overheating due to asus'  bullshit voltage adjustments, corrupt bios, etc
I was running a Asus Crosshair Hero IV, new with Ryzen 1 and upgraded all the way to 5950X , when it came to my next upgrade I was going to switch to the 7950X and new MB an DDR5 but I thought I would give Intel a look so got a 13900K an Asus Z790 Strix MB and 64GB 5600 Corsair Dominator DDR5, I am having so many issues with the MB causing the PC to blue screen with a new fault each time, latest bios etc, I am so disappointed that I may put my old set up back in...
ASUS used to be the gold standard. I have a RTX 2060 graphics card that works well but I will avoid ASUS products.. Its unfortunate.
ASUS just stated it will NOT void your warranty.  What mobo would ya’ll recommend in place of ASUS?
ASUS now is like Netgear, goes in the trash...ill find someone else to support. Next upgrade will be neither of these 2. TY for this video, just ran across it
for normal content check framechasers... no BS and sponsership he just wants more money
Couldn’t ASUS sue you for defamation?
I paid for ASUS laptop $1500 for work - now it's dead, and I can't get anything from official repair ASUS service
This is actualy sad for me i am a huge fan of asus i had 0 issue with them never had a problem always thinking this is the good stuff but...after watching this video i might consider switching to msi when i build my next pc a shame...
Yeah, Asus gave me hell with my x99 deluxe, their OC socket was known to kill CPU's, it killed 3 5820k's and a Xeon, I shipped the board back to them 3 times and they say they tested it and it works fine, Well yeah if you read any thing in the RMA it will normally work well for a while, I ended up having to build a new rig, they just kept sending me back the same broken board.   Asus gave me the run around with a x299 Zenith Extreme, not a cheap board let me tell ya, 4 months of owning it, I just wouldn't turn on, I talked to a guy, they were of course apologetic, whatever, things happen, they said they replaced the board, They didn't, they didn't even open the box I sent it in, just slapped a new shipping label on it and back out the door, I contacted them, they agreed to take another look at it, they had it for 3 weeks, and said to me that the CPU pins were bent so their goes my warranty... Got the board back, none of the damn pins were bent...  My Asus 5700xt strix, they had issue with the VRM's they used screwed that were too long and the cooler would pull away from the vrm's, known issue, I contacted them for a replacement or a fix, the card vrms would over heat and it would downclock and end up performing worse than a my 780ti, This replacement is the updated model, no they sent me a new card with the same stupid problem, I ended up voiding my warranty to fix their screw up with 2 plastic washers, they pointed finger at AMD on non reference card.  I got more money in shipping crap back to them, its insane, they never fixed any of my problems, I got a Asus x570 atm, if it dies, Im going ski shooting, im not wasting my time. I got a MSI B550 board I'd replace it with.  Yeah, both my Asus monitors, they are like old car if they get too hot from vaper lock, they need to be unplugged every now and then to even respond to the power button, both of my Asus monitors do that, and have done it for years.  Yup, im done with them as well.
I bet that person who seemed like he was on to something in the board room meeting is currently sweating cold rn.
glad i didnt buy Asus fk them
I am shocked, I have used their products for years, and have only had to RMA one board, outside of the warranty window, and they did it no questions asked.
I've built my last three computers with nothing but ASUS, but my next build will include zero ASUS parts. I love when companies make it easy to decide which parts to buy, and which not to buy.
But you dont care,.. that said it all for me!
Appreciate the info, so I can steer clear next time I have to replace my current ASUS.
Asrock are HUGELY underrated.  Great products and support.
I bough my first Maximus board for my 4970k back in 2012, since then, ive ran a maximus board for 6700k, 7700k, and my current rig is a 9900k in maximus hero z390. I was planning on buying another maximus when intel 14th gen/whatever the hell AMD calls the next gen of ryzen drops. But now ive no clue what board ill pick up, but  now im not sure what board ill go with. But after this shady shit I do know that i will never buy another asus motherboard. Vote with you wallet guys, girls, and everyone in between or not in between.
I'm literally about to buy all the parts for an $8K build and have the X670E board on the list, thank goodness I saw this. Going to swap it out for an MSI board
Damn.. I Wish I could have seen/known this before... I bought a whole asus ambient for a new rig few days ago, included an X670E Extreme and I already don't like how I've received the box (the state of It) that's why I'm looking for some more info trough internet. Now I can but cross fingers that I dind't waste 1k€ for nothing. Thanks a lot for this man! You surely got a new follower ❤
ASUS simply got greedy.  They do not have my custom anymore
Asus caters to darksiders. And Intell caters to light siders.  Now you know
My Strix monitor broke just after 2 years. I have had two Strix headsets break on me too, the plastic just cracked on the headband and then it would not stay on.
What a shame really....
I was one of those people who had issues with their ROG X570 ITX motherboard back in 2020 because I got a board from the batch that didn't have a thermal pad over the chipset. Ended up returning that one and getting a new one from Amazon. That one died about 8 months down the line and the RMA process was absolute dogshit. It was overly difficult and there was no communication back to me outside of a slip of paper when I got the replacement from them a month later that said they didn't know what the issue was. The replacement board I got was not new and also terrible because it failed within 6 months. I decided to not bother with the RMA and went Gigabyte. Haven't had a problem since.
These are the reasons I stuck with MSI and INTEL. 🤷🏻‍♂
Thank you for continuing to be pro-consumer Jay.
Using ASUS for my builds for over 20+ years and never, I mean NEVER had an issue with a single board. But this is some sad sh*t! Unfortunately just ordered one for my new build, fingers crossed it goes well this time...
this seems like a hack hit piece against ASUS....did they decide to stop sponsoring you for some reason?
Asus overvolting CPU's? Asus makes processors? OR is it about them screwing their mobo settings?
Respect to you. Its good to see that your stil the same guy from 10 years back.
Asrock build a solid mainboard. I use asrock b450m steel legend nearly 3 years and no issue arise , even update to the latest bios, it still run solid . What can i say, asrock mainboard are solid, reliable and good quality
Ive got a pending return of an asus product and this is making me sweat like crazy!
"We are familiy" they mean the murfee brood? :D
Thanks for the heads up Jay! Much appreciated!
Right when I was planning to buy the Asus ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming or the MSI MPG X670E CARBON WIFI, or the Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master or the AsRock X670ETaichi. Buying motherboards in 2023 for double their normal price...When is my salary going to double?
I brought the asus rog falchion keyboard as a treat to myself and had software issues constantly with it disconnecting and saying it had a low battery even though it was fully charged a moment beforehand.  I ended up leaving it plugged in to solve the issues but was not till the cheap plastic height adjustments feet broke off on one side that I then found it was all wobbly when I tried to just use it without the high adjustment feet.      On inspection I found the rechargeable battery they have inside has swollen up inside and had even cracked the case.  So I now think it had a dodgy battery from day one along with software issues.   All that time leaving it on while out ment I had being risking a fire in my house so I was not happy.    Think i could get help from asus over it? Nope just take it back to the place you brought it and they would not touch it as well.  To be fair it was just outside its lousy 1 year warranty but under australian consumer law it should be fixed or replaced given its cost. I even told asus this but no they just palm it off to the retailer.  Not the first time I have had issues with the brand so with all of this dramas going on i'll be holding off buying the brand again till they sort out their issues.
Damn how the mighty has fallen. Asus once apon a time was one of the best hardware brands on the planet, sounds like they've been falling off that mountain side cliff for a while.
Why does no company care about consumer anymore
My pc randomly hard freezes ever since I built it. It doesn't happen as often as before. I can't reproduce it, but I've had the issue happen enough times to have a few guess as to what is causing it. The fact that it is happening less I highly suspect it's software and not hardware, but then again I've since avoided or stopped doing activities that I lead to these hard freezes. Activities like using my bluetooth headphone and/or attending classes on zoom. It never happens when I'm playing games so I doubt it's the GPU or even memory. I never fixed the issue, but it's not happening anymore, rarely at least. Anyways if you haven't figured it out yet, I have an ASUS motherboard. I built my pc 3 years ago. Now I'm not saying my mobo was the issue. I'm just saying I would not be surprised if it was.  My motherboard: Asus ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI) ATX AM4  TLDR: I'm avoiding ASUS in my future builds too.
13:12 I also have the ASRock X370 Taichi from however many years ago and it's been good to me....except some of the USBs have never worked. And Wireless Mouse/keyboard dongles disconnect over and over so everything must be wired.  Ok maybe it's not that great.
Damn, there goes one strong brand, into the GUTTER!!!!
This sucks I was really looking into buying an Asus ROG Ally. With how the brand is going I won't purchase it
When I emailed Asus asking for replacement q-latches for the m.2s with heatsinks so I can use the m.2s I bought with heatsinks as currently they were held with frigging ducktape on a £700 motherboard. The ASUS customer rep blamed me for installing the m.2 motherboard heatsink ontop of m.2s with heatsinks when it's not even remotely possible. When I pointed this out was not even possible, the rep literally admitted on email that X670E Crosshair Hero was not designed to be used with M.2s with heatsinks. When I asked point blank that were they telling me that Asus is intentionally limited customers on a £700 motherboard, not a single peep. So, over 3 bits of friggin plastic, they were willing to lose a customer. Anyway, I did end up using my own nylon stand offs and bolts to replace the q-latch stand offs as I did find a screw that would go into the q-latch stand offs but... I slightly over torqued one and the metal screw broke inside the stand-off. The q-latch stand-offs are screwed on the bottom *and* glued on the top. So you have to use some force wiggling them off.   Given their scumbag responses via email I had zero confidence i'd get a working board back from Asus if I rmaed it and not to mention it's highly likely i'd get blamed again... 🤦‍♂. Seeing what Jay himself went, justifies my decision of fixing Asus's stupid pig headedness and skimping on costs. They could easily resolved this problem by including replacement plastic q latches for m.2s with heatsinks.
I've been running an asrock ab350m for 6 years now.  just swapped up a 1600X to a 5600.  shit works perfectly.  it has no RGB.
I've been saying that about ASRock for years. I have championed them and Gigabyte for years, if not decades. I have avoided Asus like the plague, that is until last year when I got "stuck" with an Asus TUF x570 due to Micro Center having a shortage of MBs to fulfil their CPU/MB bundle deals. How I regret it...their BIOS is garbage, their components are garbage, and their tech support is horse shit (to put it kindly). My cheapo AsRock that I built over 13 years ago, is still going strong in my son's build paired with an R590.
I don't trust you ASUS, I have no words just because of what you have done in 2023.
Using corsair in expo mode on my asus b650e board with ryzen 7900. After the last Asus incident, should i disable expo mode in bios? I did not update bios.
I'm still running a 3800x and a Asus Tuf board and am upgrading soon and i know I'm moving to Msi because when i was doing this build i got 1 doa Asus board (that i later found out was a bad bios) I feel like all my trust in their bios is gone. I as a consumer don't trust them to be a part of my build anymore. to me Msi has gotten a lot better and i feel like i can feel safe going with their products.
You poor poor thing.
Back in 2020 when I got my Z490-I motherboard, Asus' Armoury Crate wasn't properly controlling my cooler, and that eventually lead CPU damage. Asus completely ignored my complaint and refused to replace the damaged part. I will not purchase another Anus product.
My last 2 builds have been ASUS motherboards and I've always had USB issues with both systems, one Intel and one AMD. My next build will not be an ASUS.
I never did buy Asus motherboards...I only buy AsRock,MSI,EVGA and GIGABYTE Thanks for informing us Jay........Great!!! Video as always:)
Lol the title is so click bait. You are not Asus their Boss so u can't fire them.
subscribed because I like straight talk.  was an asus guy in my 2nd pc build some years ago.  motherboard stability is the essential heart of a system that I want to run for 10 years average lifetime.  I accept zero risk from a mobo company's product.
I forget who it is but there are a couple of the main brands making super hero boards, that said I put a sonic themed 13th gen board in a friends build. That said I will be walking away from asus as well, they treated my mom so bad when her high end laptop died in warranty and they fought me so long that I finally got a warranty claim from 3rd party warranty I bought for the price of the the laptop so my mom lost a $155 ON AN IN WARRANTY LAPTOP that was 10 months old and 13 months old by the time it was over with. She has switched to a bespoke chrome book and her iphone and ipad and never looked back. So yeah no thx asus, no if I could figure out if if I have a hardware or software issue in my box I would love it as the issue is super nebulous, keep up the good work jay.
GG ASUS no re
I think the severe drop in Asus product quality has more to do with stockholders than the engineers... from how I see it, Asus has been more focused on packaging and what knick knacks come with their product rather than the product itself... the most expensive motherboard from Asus atm has more "freebies" that are useless but are adding to cost and causing the board quality to drop... I think a big group in the stockholders in Asus have enough power to force them to ship products with these knick knacks, while the engineering side has very little influence so we end up with a shitty product with really cool freebies instead of having a really cool product with some random freebies...
I ordered an Asus Z690 A-Gaming DDR5 in Nov 2022. The first I received had big scratches on all plastic and alumium parts ... I returned it. I received a new one who was defective (and killed my i7 13700KF). The shop changed my CPU without any question and sent my motherboard for repair. After 1 full month, Asus told them I damaged the socket (but sadly for them, I did photos before to send my MB in RMA). No words from Asus for 2 more weeks ... The shop had finally decided to refund me and I finally bought the z790 A-Gaming.   The first Z790 A-Gaming I received (480€ ...) had scratches on plastic and aluminium heatsinks (and no socket protection). Finally, the 4th motherboard was the good one ! (And to be sure to don't have any trouble with the socket, I bought and installed a Thermalright socket frame !  Asus is expensive, and quality is not there at all !! It's just a f*cking disapointement !
Thank you for your honesty and integrity. I keep coming back because of your sincerity.
Thanx for leaving 😏
Jay, it does not surprise me. I think these issues come from the way ASUS handles its employees. As a person in that industry and in Taiwan I heard TONS OF SHIT about working for ASUS and the people flow there is crazy. That is why they can't provide a stable outcome.
I loved ASUS when I first started getting into computers. They were a brand I could rely on but no longer. Thank you for putting it out there.
Jay could also have posted a simple tweet to Asus. This video is just a smart Business move and will earn Jay some nice money again and do you really think he will never work with Asus again??
Never trusted them. EVGA everyday all day unless they quit producing mobo's too.
yeh fuck paying over 1k for a board that shoddy!
I have a B550-F. So far I haven't had any problems with it a year in now. Glad I know  now to look out though.
Armoury-Crate was the harbinger.
Yeah I bought a pc, died in 6 months
I bought z690 hero at premium price and it has been nothing but horrible. System instability (memory, i/o) and their BIOS updates just make shit worse. Never again ! Problem is gigabyte is even worse. Maybe MSI next time ? Sigh.
I think it kInd of unfair for influencers to be dissing ASUS (probably warranted) without making recommendations for what we should use. I see videos about other vendor quality issues as well. Which manufacturer is the casual builder supposed to trust?
Speaking of Asus. I got a budget 144hz Asus monitor and it just started showing a horizontal line. lol
Unfortunately ASUS ain’t afraid of a Youtuber
Only issue I've had with my ASUS B550-F mobo is that the integrated ethernet port doesn't work in the slightest. Never did. I was forced to buy an expansion card. Coincidentally, it is also an ASUS product.
I got Ausu laptop because I needed a at the fast computer to run Crysis3 game. I think it was G1. It did a good job. Unfortunately it came with Visa. At the time it was latest and greatest. Time said no. So the next OS came out I upgraded the I think Win7. Did mention the Ausu customize there driver and hardware for the Vista. There was no support for Win7 on this computers, Some thing broke or not supported. You had to  buy a new computer one for Win7. I will not buy another Ausu anything.
Wow. Jay doing something moderately decent. I'm surprised.   Not surprised ASUS shit the bed. I avoid them where possible, and have for a very long time. But surprised LTT Junior here didn't eat as much ass as LTT does.  I mean, all of you idiots are misreading the disclaimer statement, ignoring "Except as provided in the Product warranty and to the maximum extent permitted by law", and blowing this up for all the factually incorrect reasons to huff your own taints, but... At least you're finally disassociating from ASUS.  Doing the right thing, but for all the wrong reasons.
Never thought I would say that, but I am happy I bought Asrock ... the X570 and B650Strix both had issues
I did not know that about Asrock. They burned me so bad years ago that I have never used one of their products since. Might have to reconsider now.
I had to RMA one product with Asus that I even opened up. It was my dads 2 in 1 and the fan was hellaciously loud. I even told them what had happened and they still Warrantied it. Glad I didn’t go with them with my last build. Last time I used an Asus board was X79….that system was great. Except the seasonic psu…Crazy how times have changed in the last 10 years
Bought a motherboard less than a month ago, literally was so excited to do another build as I save for them and do them roughly every 5 years.   ASUS ROG Strix B650-A was the poor choice I made. Because I’ve swapped out 3 sets of ram kits and I’m on my 4th now. And I think I’ve realized it wasn’t the ram it’s most likely the board. As now I can’t even get it to post.   This has got to be the most heartbreaking computer experience I’ve had within the 15 years I’ve been building computers. Just stuck here watching my computer that was doing fine not post anymore is just a horrible time, I’ve swapped everything out except the motherboard. Tried to clear CMOS. I’m over the 30D return rate and now I have to deal with ASUS customer support and I’d rather just give up all together. I’ve got literally nowhere with the support.   If you’ve read this far, just don’t buy from Asus. Don’t turn out like me wondering at 4 am why your computer that you poured so much time into won’t post.
I'm sure Asus CEO will get no sleep tonight because they can't send JayzTwoCents  free products to shit on anymore.  Love how half the video is you complaining you got used free shit and not new free shit!!!
Sounds like the Beta bios were just a way to dupe customers into voiding their warranties to mitigate the number of warranties covered for the initial issue. I'll bet they would try to shaft the people with those warranties by claiming they didn't take advantage of the so-called "fix" that was available.
Damn, I've been using ASUS since the beginning. Can't go to MSI either since they were ransomware'd and hackers can send fake BIOS updates that look official from what I've heard.
other than my wifi router ive never liked asus product. been saying for years it is garbage for the price. i wanted the gundam parts till i found out they were asus and i basically cried.   You said it perfectly they intel'd basically and became complacent being the "top tier" brand. Gigabyte and asrock have stepped up. MSI is getting a little complacent also i feel.
Just came to add during covid shutdowns I tried to buy a new PC. I was looking for a desktop but I didn't need super high end. Just a couple of games and mods. They didn't have any desktops. I was forced to get a laptop. The guy was nice and really honest, but I had to get two. Within 3 months, one shit a brick. Took it back. Turns out the motherboard crapped itself. Sweet. Under warranty. Get it replaced... Laptop runs like utter shit now. It got a "brand new" motherboard and runs like shit. Horray... Republic of gamer laptops.  Other than that it seems like a decent gamer laptop for casual. But that was stupid sucky. 2k down the drain.
Fuck this, I'm not getting the rog ally
I purchased an Asus motherboard on amazon and saw this video just before they shipped and last minute was able to cancel and move over to MSI. thank you for coming out with this informative video when you did. you may have saved me from a world of hurt.
Sometimes I think “oh why do influencers get preferential treatment” but stuff like this reminds me that if they can’t even get their shit together for you, what hope does any normie have?
Asrock is Asus' cheap brand,  afaik, so same people
i've been a gigabyte fan for years. Got disillusion by their subpar rog products
Gigabyte and MSi boards are having the same issue now.... so.....
I left them 3 years ago.  Used them almost exclusively for a decade.  They have zero software support.
Its sad that components are 5/10x times pricewise compared to the past but much worse manufacturing.. Left the pc market years back and don't miss it
They shouldn't release a BIOS that could damage the board without requiring them to e-sign a document they're forced to scroll through. The entire process can be automated, and would prevent people from casually downloading something that could destroy their board.
much appreciated psa. i probably wouldn't have heard about this otherwise. which could've spelled doom for the ppl i give advice too cause i'd always seen asus as a rock solid product. guess i should replace their name with asrock for the foreseeable future.
Corporations should be under investigation for this kind of behavior, with handcuffs as a consequence, not just money. ASUS is dead to me for this, _and_ for Scott's post
My brother whois Special needs broke the PowerAdapter for his Asus zenbookFlip. Called for him Asus cust Supp. Told me sorry nothing we can do, NO repalce, RMA, no refund, no Discount, No nothing. But we can sell you one for $59.99. Thank you for your service ASUS. I am Done with U.
So far my falcon northwest x670e azus 7950x3d has been running great for over a month. Fingers crossed.
Thank you for this video. I used to be ASUS customer who has bought a G70s gaming laptop which came with a faulty gpu. Dealing with ASUS support was not easy.
The timing of “you know what happened when I started my livestream” instantly get 2 ads
Sounds more like some PEOPLE at ASUS need to be fired. And if you are a rep, you make sure that everything is checked and signed off before sending to influencers...
Aftet having two gaming laptops dying on me right after the warranty, NEVER AGAIN.
Jay, ASUS products will still be on the market and they still have a very reputable name among gamers. This decision to no longer support a brand will affect your audience. Some of whom may become disadvantaged without your support of these products. I have had issues with ASUS Mobos as well as other products. I haze a Z790 and still experience issues with the X.M.P. and have had to make a custom profile. I have experience with the ASUS RMA process due to a very similar issue of a bent pin and dirty CPU socket. I have also had issues with their AIO cooler display failing. Your reviews and "how-to guides" have helped me get my build running and stable on some of the issues that didn't require an RMA. The support should have come from ASUS directly; however, a quick Google search that landed on your youtube channel has saved me time and frustration. As much as I understand not wanting to support ASUS. I don't believe the entire market will follow suit and I feel this will be a loss for those who follow this channel.
i rebuilt my personal rig with an asus tuf x670e wifi board and it has been nothing but issues. when i first built it, it wouldnt even turn on, so i thought i needed a new power supply. so swapped that and still no power, so i swapped my psu back in and came back the next day to see the rgb on the board lit up. booted up but now to get it stable at times is irritating between the random bsods and restarts when loading games. so now im looking for a different board. i just dont know who to go with now.
I stopped using Asus products in 2019, it felt like they were beginning a downward spiral. Glad I listened to my gut. Seems like asus is stuck thinking themselves too big to fail... looks like we, as the consumers, need to remind them of their mortality lol.
Gigabyte > Asus
I 100% blame AMD, all my MSI AMD Motherboards had issues. I can't even remember having issues with Intel.
just when you thought living on the edge of technology couldn't get any better.....  you warned US of the issues of adopting the latest stuff.
I’m not super smart when it comes to this stuff. Should I worry about my G17 Strix 2021?  Also the removable key mouse they have is amazing I sand down silent keys and pop them in there! So legit!
Glad I built a Z590 Asus. I had always liked their stuff, but if I were to build something new, it'd probably be EVGA or MSI. Unfortunately, with EVGA backing out of the GPU world, I may still use an Asus video card, but I'd consider MSI too. I had their GTX 1060 in high school and it ran great.
Mate I've been in IT for over 15 years professionally and I can't remember a time ASUS was ever any good when it came to MAINBOARDS in particular.  They make great monitors and a bunch of things but MAINBAORDS and ROUTERS...... Absolutelty NO.  I have tried them every few years and regretted it.  I recently tried two AM4 boards, both dodgy issues with random black screen reboot.....  not powering up at all, I had an ASUS Router new AC1750 2022 model..  GREAT FEATURES.......  had the linux kernel it run on just panic randomly and randomly reboot........ sometimes a day at a time, sometimes multiple times in 10-30 min span.......  Most mainboards just frankly SUCK...  What people liked was their overclocking nonsense, they on benchmarks they made a few more numbers......... but no.  Gigabyte 100% all the way.  So yeah..........  A FIRM NO to ASUS on mainboards and now routers.
I wish I had enough money to design computer gear so I can garentee my gear works properly and is worth wat I pay   And stop obsolescence aswell
Asus product is not about consumer needs. It has been building its product aimed at prosumers. The price is always dictates their heading.
6month to have stability with b550 tuf and 5800x. Catastrofic
thats like 16 walls
Ive literally built over 100 computers as i used to do that for a living, but the only 2 asus boards ive ever touched were DOA
No ROG Ally for me then
I just spent 6 hours of my working day trying to update the bios on my ASUS Pro art Z690.... guess what... it wouldn't show anything unless I plugged in an HDMI cable even though I had a display port cable plugged in. and not to mention that I hear audio crackle and random error all the time. And not to mention that I cannot plug my 4090 into my first PCIE slot. I AM SOOOOO Done with ASUS.... my buddy had a bran new build and as soon as he replaced his ASUS mobo everything runs like butter. Screw this.
Thank you for brining this our attention Jay & crew...I used to hold ASUS in high regard...such a shame.
Obviously this problem was just with shitty AMD Hardware, so why blame ASUS? I never heard something like that with Intel Hardware. So just dont buy AMD and you'll have no prblems.
Respect to you Jay ! ♥
Been an Asus fan for a long time. I built my 4th gen i7 on a maximus board and its going strong. And I bought a ROG Strix laptop a while back too (no longer working due to a heating issue LOL)  After this video, I will probably never buy another product from them, and I hope they understand how influential these videos are on a consumer market. Theyre going to be fucked for years whether they fix everything tomorrow or not.   Good luck to the people in that company that actually care, to the rest, good ridence.
Finally this piss poor company is falling down. I still would never forgive them for the loads of trouble I had with the Zephyrus S, a freaking 2700$ machine at that time. I kid you not their standards for quality is horrendous so don’t be surprised at their quality control. I had to return it three times and be without a laptop for 6 months because of the glaring overheating issues and terrible keyboard RGB quality. At the end of the tunnel I completely gave up and decided to take the matter into my own hands, turns out they were using the most godawful thermal paste in existence that literally turns into garbage after three days and as for the RGB LEDs well every time I use them I get pissed off at the unevenness of the lighting and the wrong colors but I can’t anything about it as I got exhausted from dealing with their crappy support. Thank the heavens above that everything else is working well.
Drama queen master class
That is what you get when companies outsource the building of electronics to China, Mexico, etc for cheaper prices and bigger profits. If you have an older ASUS Motherboard your good, because I had no trouble with them. But you nerds want high-tech, so live with it. it happens. Either the Board CPU Combo works or it doesn't. Gigabit is what I'm looking at in the near future.
This kinda sucks, I really liked ASUS and their products. I have a 2008 ROG laptop with a 660m, and it's lasted quite some time, unfortunately not like their newer laptops.
ASUS always used to be my first brand of choice on my builds as they were ALWAYS good and lasted a decade without any issues ... now ... I am on GigaByte ... I built a 7900X for my big brother thing is overclocking and running solid ZERO issues...   Another friend asked me to help with building them a PC ... I tried to go the same route I did with my brothers build for them ... but they pretty much without asking me when it came to ordering ... bought an ASUS b650 board instead ... I looked up the board and such and went alright this should be alright defaulting to my ASUS usually gets their stuff right .... i had a hell of a time getting it to work without tweaking... things did eventually calm down for it but boy this latest mess has me very nervous to mess with much ... thankfully things for it have settled in and it is working for them but compared between the two systems I put together I definitely didn't have to struggle with the gigabyte as much as I did that ASUS ... plus what in the heck is the story with this having to used pair memory in B1_B2 vs A1_A2? ... both systems would NOT post even with the learning but each time I moved to the other slots no problem ... that is some shenanigans for sure...
i literally just canceled my asus mobo order after watching this and gamernexus. their products aren't worth it if they're going to be voiding warranties and other pitfalls in their terms of agreement. what a joke!
damn bro thanks for the info
seems like ASUS just hot potatoes their products.
Another thing that rubs me the wrong way is when my ROG Laptop that had liquid metal for thermal paste ending up dieing they refused to rma it. It was less than a month out of the 1 year warranty and they said that they didnt support it anymore. The way it broke was the gasket inbetween the liquid metal and the motherboard failed. Thus frying the pc for a faulty gasket.
ROG should be company neutral.
I used routers, their routers were fine but the rog push just seemed a bit sketchy
I wish I knew about this 3 months ago. I got the Z690 DDR5 I have had problems with blue screens and the motherboard with the RAM. I had to try online support and took it to best buy. They were confused what was going on. Was getting memory errors.  I just got it back. Still some little bugs going on. Will see what happens in the next few weeks. I guess I will look into MSI if this doesn't work out.
NO ITS NOT ASUS FAULT AT ALL - I TOLD NEARLY A YEAR AGO HOW TERRIBLE AMD IS< AND YOU KEEP BUILDING RIGS ON YOUR CHANNEL AROUND THEM.    DUE TO AMD"S FAULTY CHIPS AND BAD NEW DESIGN THE AIBS WHERE PRESENTED WITH TO EVEN COME UP WITH A REMOTLY WORKING MOBO IN THE 1ST PLACE KNOWING AMD SUCKS ON THAT ASPECT TO ALL VENDORS THEY SHILL THEIR LIES OUT TO  All those ASUS boards around you are HINT INTEL, and ye they all work right ???  yes they do, its just proof AMD sent AIB vendors shoddy drivers and parts like ive been trying to teach you for over 2 years now.  so you bust a vendor for AMD;s lies not to good jay.  msi gigabye all have shoddy AMD boards that are barely holding together right now.  AMD needs a FULL RECALL, but they will slap the issued to asus and the others and redirect point fingers so AMD can sit on their crown of bad parts and keep schilling their lies.
me watching this through an ASUS monitor: 👁👄👁
that sucks... my ASUS board is over 10 years old and still working great. one of the best MOBO I've ever had.
I have a asus z690-f  and 13700k after many bios update(like 5?) It still doesn't work right, my buddy has same exact setup but with msi carbon wifi no issues xmp works better than expected and it's not ram or cpu bc we traded to test... it's the motherboard....  Never buying asus again, they were no help and told me if nothings broke they can't rma bc the issue is software not hardware. Garbage company.
I have actually been using Asrock since 2016, with the B450m pro, then B550m pro, and right now I am using the B650m riptide from AsRock, and I have had never had any issues since I built my PC with that board, Friend of mine is using Asus Prime board, he is having constant issues with the M.2 not showing up for some reason. and it is his first PC unfortunately.... and first experience, I feel bad for him.
I dropped them this year when they refused a return on a motherboard because of a scratch around the screw mounting hole. $800 down the tube because of their unreasonable behavior.
AMD has issues with memory kits even the EXPO ones. I have a kit recommend by MSI on my X670E carbon, once in a while it give me trouble. Still of forcing it to 6000 MHZ, I just put it on Auto, much better after that. The other issues is the booting time for memory training. It is a good alternative for intel for sure, you don't lose performance comparing with Intel on games. I switch from intel to AMD because motherboard long term support. I hope to have the same board in the next five years and buy the last CPU for the AM5, and used it another 4 years. I hope ten years with the same board.
I just had a PCI slot catch on fire and melt my 3070,  on my 8tj gen said rog motherboard been using if for year's then bam melt down
That sucks ! I'm a huge fan of ASUS. As far as I can remember, I've always used ASUS mobos and nothing else, for more than 30 years (before, they were called AsusTek, if I'm right). At the point that I'm totally blind and I'm not even able to know what the other brands have for sale. But given the actual situation, I might have to chose something else. This is frustrating ASF. For real. I don't even know if Asrock, Gigabyte or MSi are good at their shit... 😮‍💨
One of the biggest or the biggest hardware retailer in Germany Mindfactory actually banned ASUS from their product range in 2019 completely. They never said anything about this but it seems like ASUS is doing the same bs with dealers as they are doing with customers and content creators. Actually I never ever had an ASUS product in my own builds. I once used a 1060 for a build for a friend of mine but thats all. I am a happy owner of a Zenfone 9 - and that might be just because it is a whole different division inside of ASUS. I also am pretty happy with all the ASRock Boards I had since ~2009. This was maybe the best decision ASUS ever made to let go of ASRock. I actually stayed away from Aorus and MSI as well. I used Gigabyte Boards in the past but I didn't like the pricing and price-to-performance-ratio of the Aorus products. MSI had a worse reputation than ASRock in my head for as long as I can think. Bad quality for moderate prices (at least for their budget options). Maybe EVGA is putting more effort in releasing multiple mainboards for one chipset now that they are out of the GPU business (sadly - even my 1080 Ti FTW3 cries). This could be a great option for higher end builds now that ASUS is in trouble. Right now my choice would probably fall onto an ASRock Taichi Board again (as I am using my X370 Taichi for almost 6 years now).
wait 'till you see Ally's performance vs advertised....
They sold me a defective 780ti dcu2oc, where fans didn't spin freely and had a big heatpipe dent. It was my first gpu😢, they told its normal and has no prob and I believed em. A Fan blade broke in pc case after some days, they declined my rma. I had to pay extra and had to replace the whole heatsink just to get the fan fixed and later gpu bricked and all of it was my fault as per ASUS. I had to save again and was GPUless till the 1080 came out, asus if you're reading this... You owe me big money. 🤬🤬🤬
HP has used Asus mb's for years.  I wonder if they still are ?
Great video. Maybe a good time to do a ranking of the most reliable motherboards for anyone looking to build soon?
New best motherboard brand?
"The second I went live this happened..." I get an ad with perfect timing. It's the TikTok ad with a Napoleon dog eating a chicken wing too XD
As someone who doesn't overclock of play with bios settings, my experience with AsRock as been great. I typically pay between 100 and 150$ for a motherboard (in Canada), and AsRock as been very reliable so far.
Idk Asrock is pretty legit on the server side. Asus is just hyped to be better but idk that they ever were.
When I started pc upgrades i Almost got a asus mobo so glad I went ti msi it looks better and had  little less features sure. And seeing this video has made me so happy I chose msi bullet dodged on that!
You dont care. Truuuuuuu
Four out of five of my last builds over the last 6 years or so, have been with Asus motherboards. All but two had issues develop after 2-4 years. Only one had an issue within the warranty period. All of them had stability issues and replacing their motherboards fixed it. Now, out of the 6 computers in our home, only 1 has an Asus board (mini ITX). At least that one seems to be going strong. I have avoided Asus motherboards for the last few years because of this.
15:10 - Pure gold. xD
Man, I have a TUF mobo and their 42" OLED...have had no issues and I love the screen but man this makes me feel lucky...and I hope I continue to have no issues.  Christ.
Hi - is the Z790-E specifically having issues? Or is it just AMD motherboard/CPUs?
I've been a big fan of Asus for years. I have owned multiple laptops (even bought a new work one in January of this year) and my gaming desktop has an asus board in it. Because of this video, I will not buy asus again. Thanks for showing us their true colors.
Thank you brother. I've been dyed in the wool ASUS since the mid 00's, and my last 2 builds have been... well.. I thought my 30 years of experience were failing me... Turns out (thanks to you) It was the hardware, not the guy doing the work. Keep us posted man.. So ashamed of  them right now.. And relieved that I don't suck as bad as I thought, but also sad that my broke ass built this system and it cost me far more than I could afford and I'm getting very sub-par performance out of it. Similar issues to what you described. Random BSODs, peripherals not working randomly, just weird stuff all the time that I can't track down. My favorite was the bios auto overclocking my system when I built it, when I had turned everything off to run it vanilla for a while to make sure nothing was wrong.. had processor idle temps in the 70's and 80s on a Ryzen9 5900X.. ( which I bought right before they announced the new series of course.) I have bad luck these days.. Bought the 7900XT by XFX (not my brand, but EVGA is out) because they XTX was never available without being way overpriced, only to get it, have it for a month, and have the market flood with correctly priced XTX's.. One thing after another. PC enthusiasts have a lot to think about these days, and the companies aren't really giving a crap about us anymore. Who do we go to now? Intel has been mediocre for the past few years (The last intel build I did was a 7700k) Nvidia shit on everyone, and now Asus, the bastion of reliability and style just dropped an entire basket of balls on us.. hairy ones.. What's a fella to do? I miss the 90s more and more each day.. Okay, I'm partially lying, I hated building in the 90s..
@JayzTwoCents Jay, AsRock has been consistently of better quality than ASUS for a long time(nearly a decade). You shouldn't be surprised by this. So I challenge you, get a few AsRock boards and test them against the pack. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!
I have an MSI AMD Desktop build from last year and it has been rock solid. I just bought an Asus Vivobook AMD in January, and it was trash. The 1st I returned because of random shut downs during idle. I returned it and got another, about a month in I had the same issue. After updating the ram and SSD fixed my issue. I don't know if I will permanently boycott them, like I have with HP, but not buying from them in the near future.
I recently built a PC with a Asus Z790, every now and then I get a PC crash with a Kernel Power 63 error, starting to question if its the board or another issue I have yet to figure out.
sounds like the company is ran by the Biden Crime Family
Had a very expensive 690 board, nothing but hell with it.
Thanks for laying this out. I’ve been contemplating a new build and am unwilling to go with a company that doesn’t care about their customers.
The screws used to hold down the Asus Maximus XI Hero M.2 heat sinks felt like the brainchild of someone intentionally trying to tank the company
I love all the post editing lines they put in over the live feed's. I like to assume he went off verbally but dialed it back in post xD
Looks like ASUS removed the offending language from the beta BIOS entry.
I've bought so much ASUS stuff, my MB and Video card in my current PC are ASUS, I've owned multiple monitors, tablets, laptops by ASUS. No more. This is the straw that broke my back.
The RMA board from china in the white box may in fact be my board I sent back to newegg, it had two bent pins in that exact location when I opened it however it was in the original box with all the accessories and I didn't get a new one until 3 months later after whatever supply issues with the white motherboard were resolved, luckily the replacement one I got was new and no broken pins and has been working great, sad to see this because I really love the board but that would be crazy if true!
All the stability and sound problems are basically the same as I had with my ASUS striker 2 extreme LGA 755 that worked great until the warranty passed then the sound, video, crashing, and baked to a brick. My friends all mocked me for how much I spent on the build and for getting top of the line ASUS. Guess nothing has changed in 15 years. That was the last ASUS I bought
I just built my new system with asus z690 rog motherboard. Am I it trouble?
ASUS's networking offerings have become complete garbage over the past few years. Inconsistent firmware updates, downright bad firmware, and faulty hardware have plagued their network products, in particular. I've bought ASUS motherboards the past 2-3 iterations of my own CPU builds over the last 5  years, but will likely be done with them in favor of other brands from here on out. ASUS used to be a reliable brand with good quality hardware (AND good software support), just not the case any more. If you're with ASUS, firmware updates...what are those?? Armoury Crate is just awful with driver and software support. Sad to see the demise of ASUS but they're reaping what they sowed for the past several years.
I don’t think I own anything from asus ? I normally go Msi
Thank you for this, I know what not to spend my money on for my next upgrade.
Incentives in Capitalism have been skewed and outright broken for as long as I've been alive.
Jay you are a legend
This makes me sad. I used to think Asus was one of the better ones. We are running out of good pc manufactures
you a big megaman fan? that X in the background is awesome
Was going to buy an asus wifi router, I guess I changed my mind after watching this
Asus was my fav!!!! What brand should I go now???
The first PC I ever built myself was ASUS based back in 2003. I had ASUS motherboard and video card because they were "THE" brand to go with. Now I wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole that someone else was holding onto. I am glad there are some tech influencers out there who will speak up about them and not shill for them like some drop-prone influencers out there.
All of my asus products have been nothing but headaches I had an asus gaming laptop with a usb 3.0 deiver rhat would corrupt everything plugged into it...and this was the official driver everyone got for that laptop My other gaming laptop thermal throttles at the desktop even when brand new My asus desktop rampage mobo has had tons of instability issues My "upgrades" to asus have been nothing but downgrades
Sad to hear always used them on my builds.
That reminds me when I soldered caps accidentaly in a wrong way on old MB and it was worse jump scare than in some horror movie when I turned it on. 😀 6:21 - this exactly happened to my father with his socket 1200 Asus board, I didn't believed to him because he sees shit on close distance, now I am starting to believe to him that he didn't destroy it by himself 😀 I am glad that I have AM4 socket with oldschool pins, thse modern sockets like 1200 look totaly crazy fragile. BTW, I know exactly why people destroy that, because those covers are terribly designed and it's not obvious if you should put it from inside ot outside, this is very often problem that people damages it while trying to close socket and cover it like before but they don't know how to put that cover there. It's fault of manufacturers and they are doing nothing to prevent these ridiculous mistakes. And it's even more ridiculous, people not such idiots, they do it because some older socket 775 boards really had that cover inside under metal lip, so people just put it there as they were used to and boom, socket destroyed. It's mainly fault of people who design sockets, they are stupid. Because of that, when I sell some MB with these LGA sockets, I am always puting big warning on a socket "don't remove it by hand, just close CPU there and it will pop-off" and "don't try to cover it back" because it just makes me crazy how many people will just instantly destroy that socket. 14:00 - I liked AsRock many years ago, I had some socket 478 board with intel 865 board, it was really cheap back in the day and totaly reliable and good MB, then I had AsRock with socket 1150 or what was that for Haswell and again, totaly reliable and stable board, no problems at all with AsRock.
During the days of bloody bad capacitors, every MSI board I deployed failed in less than 4 years. I'm poised to give them another chance.
i saw steves video about the whole issue. problems can happen. sometimes it is just unpredictable what happens with all the different cpus, memory modules and so on. but to handle it like asus is a scam in my opinion. the have stolen those people who installed their bios their warranty. thats such a shady practice. i also decided when hearing this, to avoid asus.
Statement <3
This is why i won’t be buying their handheld next month the way they handle customer support is frightening
Jay i had the same issue with smashed pins! i brought an Intel z690 for a customer build only to find a completly smashed row of pins with White Fur on it *suppose it came from a dust coat/ disposable static coat* i can send photos!
I have tried using Asus for many builds and always wound up back to MSI.
ASUS were my go to component manufacturer. Gigabyte have a bad rep for certain components as well. Who's left? MSI? Anyone else?
So you build Computer Systems on how they look??   Really?  How about Building systems that work..??   Are you one of those folks that think "Chrome" makes Engines go faster?
3:55 *The Definition of Hyperbole* So they don’t claim that its a proper fix that it is in fact a Beta, so it not like this at all.
Hahaha I'm new to all this and I took 1 year to research how to build a p.c I researched what each component was on a p.c and then I built a p.c on my own and when I went to buy parts Asus always seemed garbage so I'm happy I never went with them
I gave up on ASUS after i built my current 12900k build. Have had nothing but issues with my Maximus Hero Z690. Additionally, our brand new ASUS RT-AX88U router randomly died and they expect me to pay to ship it back to them to be fixed under warranty. ASUS is now trash that couldn't give a shit less about their customers. Done with them.
This is sad, ive been a hardcore fan of the ROG lineup for at least a decade and now im going to have to stop buying some of their products unless they make a huge effort to fix this stuff. From now on ill stick to maybe monitors and accessories like keyboards or mice. Im already not a fan of EVGA or AsRock due to hardware issues with them as well so this severely limits by options.
You sound really upset that they didn't continue to offer you a contract for your drama. Maybe they just know who is worth it
What Asus turned evil ??? What happened?
Lol some people really do believe their own hype. you're "firing" Asus as if you're somebody important and bigger than them... just wow.
I dodged a bullet, I've been using ASUS for many years, on Intel CPUs.  I was looking at going with a 78003DX. On a hero board in the next month or so.  Just because I liked the idea of the upgrade path AMD has compared to Intel as my situation has changed and I need to consider being able to drop a new CPU in a board three years down the track.  I was thinking of a Gigabyte or MSI.  Thanks for the content.
I never was on like computer news stuff but i always liked asus, well I have a 9th gen set up so I'm in past asus but bassicly asus now is ruining themselves? are motherboards the problem and customer service situations? beacsuue I was legit making a plan 2 months ago to build a full rog setup.... not such a good idea anymore?
Very sad, i have 2 Asus Monitors that are 7, respectively over 10 years old, still have great color and work without problem. Also until this point, i recommended all my friends that want to build a computer a Asus Motherboard (big part is Aura because it works the best from all the bad Motherboard RGB Experience you can choose from). I never had any problems so i cant talk about customer service, but the products were very solid for a very long time. Don't know when making even more and more and more money and exploiting the shit out of everything came to be the norm... sad times
I have everthing and longer years I never have problem. ( But it ´s TOSHIBA. Yes real have). What other brand should choose in future if want buy components or laptop?
Asus is Asus but without the A, they're just sus
Luckily you now have a MSI board ... Oh ... Oh no ... Maybe hold of updating its firmware for the moment :)
I watched the Asus ROG Ally handheld trailer and it was just a Bunch of Darkskin men and Women.   ASUS is just another corporation trying to tick boxes, make money and doesn't give a f  😃Hope their stocks dump after the bad press settles.
Board problems seem like hit-back for failing to come to terms.
Frame Chasers said companies moving away from channels like yours and linus. Is it the beginning of the end for channels like this? No more samples etc.
Ive been using ASROCK motherboards since 2012 and my first build is still running strong, 11 YEARS LATER! My daily driver was build in 2018 using one of the first ryzens and is still awesome and getting decent benchmarks.  I do have a ROG STRIX laptop that gets very light use but thats performing well, although I did think it was going to be my last Asus product when I bought it due to the lack of linux support.
lmao, the guy that shilled Norton AV to his viewers is talking about ethics and consumer protection.  Glad to see Asus getting their cheeks clapped though.
ROG Rip Off Garbage
I was a big fan of ASUS. Until I got ahold of their monitor series that automatically darkens. No STALKER, no Long Dark, no games where darkness is used for atmosphere. Then all of this? Hah. Kay.
I haven't had no issues with Asus "products" but I would never use them for computer parts cause all I've ever heard is subpar or negative. Headphones, keyboards, etc I still buy. Even use Asus phone. But Computer parts......naaaa I'm good
IMO best Motherboards- Aorus. Best Graphics Cards - PNY, closest to FE design. Memory - Corsair.
ASUS is garbage. Every board I ever bought from them didn't work right from the moment I installed it. I had a ton of stability issues, and the other components in my systems were all on their supported components list. Their customer service was horrible too. I changed to ASRock and never looked back. The first ASRock board I purchased worked beautifully. It's still going strong 7 years and 3 component upgrades later.
For years I used ASUS blind folded, I got a DOA motherboard, I'm done now.
There’s sus in asus
Should've stuck to intel :p
I have been a fan of their products in the past but now this along with other peoples comments... I'll never trust them again
"The second I went online, this happened:" - <Coca-Cola ad starts>    :D
So who's the go-to brand for computer parts now that EVGA stopped making GPU's and ASUS's spiral downward?
For the first time in in 14 years I bought outside Asus. I've always done Asus everything, and EVGA GPU. My last 600 dollar mobo had a blown capacitor. They tried to blame me saying it was because I had water cooling in it. I told them it's literally a mother board with built in water-cooling and why would that cause a bad capacitor. I eventually got a replacement, but the hassle was crazy for what I spent. I bought gigabyte on my current PC I'm building and if it works out I'm not going back.
sounds more like issues with what 3rd party your buying from and your alterations to the product causing issues and then you blaming ASUS for it
Glad this is getting traction.  ASUS is truly scummy.  A friend's ASUS gpu caught fire out of nowhere.  It was still under warranty.  They fought him tooth and nail to not honor the warranty.  He finally gave up because it wasn't worth his time anymore, they got away with sending him a lower tier card instead of a 1:1 replacement.  After seeing him struggle with it I decided I would never buy that brand.
Been a subscriber since... I wanna say 2014.  Tuned out of the PC world for years now. Nice to see one of your videos pop up and see how much you've grown. You had amazing content back in the day and you still do. Keep up the good work.
Wow! This really sucks. I'm 44 and have only been building rigs for about 10 years. In 2013, I finally hit a time in my life where I could actually build a gaming rig. At the time, I knew absolutely nothing about building rigs except that it was expensive. So I went online and began doing my homework. In about 2 months I was building rigs. ASUS has been my go to for rigs since the start. My current build is all ROG. It's a killer rig. It's also 4 years old. My money has been going into building a track ready '10 MINI. My rig is still one helluva performer with a ROG Strix ASUS Maximus XI paired with and a ROG Strix 2080Ti. Unfortunately, at 4 years old it's damn near ancient. It's not a crazy build but it's reliable, fast and it gets the job done. I've been looking forward to building a new rig. The only thing not ASUS is the case and thats because the one I wanted wasn't available. Not going ROG is gonna be weird. Looks like I'm going MSI now. Im not 100% about looks but at least MSI boards look as good as ASUS boards. Thanks for the vid.
I tried asking them for thermal pad specs for my rx5500xt evo and they refused to provide me the specs and tried to force me to send the card to them to have thermal pads replaced but yet they provided thermal pad specs to owners of the rtx 3000 series cards
Brand-credibilty self-destruction, in one easy lesson... this'll take some kind of repair work...
Curious if anyone else has ran into this. I build my new rig yesterday, spent 12 hours on it only because it kept getting stuck on the green light and wouldn’t post to BIOS screen. The board would keep going through its normal boot cycle(red, orange, white) then got stuck on green and no display on the monitor. Monitor would show its getting signal, but no display. Tried different monitors, HDMI&DP cables. Even tried onboard graphics while disconnecting the GPU. Rebuilt the entire PC 3 times just to be sure things were built correctly. Still nothing changed. Tried booting with 1 stick of ram, nothing. Tried booting without M.2, nothing. Even tried booting with a M.2 with windows already installed, nothing. Did BIOS flashback update. Nothing. Spoke with ASUS and they were dumb founded.  Parts are as follows:  Intel i7 13700k ASUS Strix 3070 ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator Wifi:  NZXT Kraken Z53 G. Skill Trident Z RGB DDR5 64GB WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X SSD Lian Li SL120 V2 fans  Silverstone SX1000 PSU
Great job standing up for the consumers 😀👍 Especially, since ASUS seems to have forgotten, who actually pays for their bills.
I have had a Asus motherboard for a AMD 5900X build that hasn't ran stable since I built it day one.  I replaced the board first week and the replacement still has had issues.  Bought a Gigabyte board after watching this video this weekend to see if it is better.
Damn ive been building all asus pc's for years. What else is a really good brand to use for my next upgrades?
I have a b450-i gaming itx asus board and when it working its great but if you change a single setting its liable to reboot until you change it back (even basic things like fan changes or turning off overdrive or whatever)
Used to run 5950X on a DH8 with 1900 FCLK, and everything worked fine; then, 2 BIOS versions later, it could only run 1866. A few versions later, I even had random audio cracking and system freezing a few times a day; had to dial all the voltages once again. Not to mention that the CO values within Extreme Tweaker have been broken for almost 2 years. Tried -30~+10 and not a single voltage changed. The CO values within AMD OC entry still work fine. Reported several times and no one cared.
Man, I've been spending a couple of weeks learning all about hardware and builds and have finally made the big decision to get the ASUS TUF GAMING Z790-PLUS D4, and now I am stressed that I, as a normal customer that will never get the 'luxurious' treatment like such a YouTuber, could be stranded with a possible broken MOB that will give me lots of pain and zero compassion from ASUS....
My last 3 Asus products all gave me trouble....non stop. They were absolutely terrible with after sales support and I ultimately changed to a new manufacturer and cut my loses. I won't use them again mainly because of their lack of customer service!
So long asus, ive been a long time customer going back to my phenom 955 cpu. I currently have 5 personal systems running asus boards and have bought 4 asus laptops not including ones picked out for family. My last set of laptops I bought for my father, wife and myself have been MSI and they have been great.
Jay, half an year ago you were urging us to buy GPUs. Now they are 30-40% cheaper (which was obvious even back then, since new launcher were expected).  My 2 cents here - you are waiting for Asus to pay you top dollar to say they've corrected the wrongs.
Interesting, I had no idea these issues were going on. I had an Asus X99 Pro board that I bought in 2015 and that was solid as a rock, never failed me. For my new AM5 build that I built in Jan of this year, I moved over to Gigabyte with a X670 Aorus Elite AX board. The reason? That board his the sweet spot between giving you shit loads of features and a reasonable price. Asus' boards at the same price point only had half the features that Gigabyte did and I also preferred the Gigabyte aesthetics too. Also, this board has been solid as a rock too, never encountered a single failure or issue. Give Gigabyte a try Jay.
Why do those white boards have 3 ram slots? So weird.
My asrock board is 7 years old. 0 issues.
I was stupid enough to buy their Asus strix lc 240 aio. I don't remember my 10 years old h100i being that noisy, i had to reduce the rpm to like 30% to make it somewhat "silent".   I also bought a pce-ac68 and an RT-AC87U (like 8 years ago), that were supposed to support 5ghz bandwidth. They did, for a whole month or so, then my card couldn't find the router on 5ghz. Some software also had to be installed until I switched to win10.  I bought a GL502VS. Couldn't play modern games until I repasted the cpu+gpu with liquid metal because it was hitting 100°C in just minutes. You had the option to stay on BIOS 302 If you wanted to be able to use an m.2 and a 2,5" ssd simultaniously or you could update to 306 for nvme support but you had to forget the 2,5" ssd, otherwise the laptop couldn't turn on. I had to use some old HDD until I was "forced" to buy an m.2 ssd, which I'm currently stuck with. Ohh yeah, in the meantime the socket for the flat cable for the keyboard was kinda.. wonky, so when I fiddled it just a tiny bit, the latch (or however you call it) got broken off, so now it's just collecting dust. I bought an acer nitro 5, turns out the recently bought m.2 ssd cannot be recognized by either the bios or windows.  Some of their products are absolute shit, but I had luck with some of their stuff at least. My first mid-high class motherboard Asus Maximus VII Ranger was such a great choice, I used it until pretty much now. I think I never had a problem with that board, it had such a premium look. I also bought an ASUS GeForce GTX 970 OC DirectCU II. Too bad one of the fans started to produce increasingly unbearable noise, so I just moved on and replaced it with a 3070ti at the end of last year.
i will never get Asus because Armoury Crate is the absolute worse
godamn jay you tell em its iva
Hehe, Jay added voice over fixes to cover up what he really said at times.  Frickkkkkk
ASUS customer support is the worst, I stopped buying their products because of it
Thank you for making this type of video!
RESPECT 💪💪💪💪
Asux? Never use one in last 15 years :D Used so many Asrock stuff and all the time was a joy.
Damn I wanted you to review the ASUS ROG Ally.
Lmao asus gettjng trahed hard today
The desktop computergame bissnizz is killing itself.
Are MSI Xpower X370 safe to use with 5000 series processor with latest bios firmware?
MSI has lost me because of handling of problems. so i get it 100%
I always use Gigabyte MB
ASUS is Acting a LOT Like our Current Communist Government..Just Denied It, Then Lie about it & Cover it Up & Say Fuk The People ! I have Ben a Long Time Asus Fan Nothing But Asus Bords From X58 Days Untill Now I am Curently on a Asus Rog Hero X570 with a 5950x But my Next UpGrade Wont Be Asus i am sorry to say
This generation of Hardware has been a complete fucking clown show. Hopefully next year or the year after these companies will have their shit together.
Well J I let you Play with there Newest Stuff, I stick with what been running great for the past 10 years an have more fun with it....and Spend Much less...
I've been done with ASUS since a few years ago. My board fried my CPU and itself... but when I sent the board in for a repair, instead of repairing my board they sent me a completely different (used) board. I complained but they had already trashed my board. They didn't even tell me it couldn't be repaired, they just sent me a gross used board as a "repair." Screw you ASUS.
Asus is just like Samsung who uses their previously good name to sell current garbage.
This is amazing, eventually it will be common knowledge to manufacturers that they have to be very careful because channels exist that will affect profits.
So with all these issues of anti-consumerism, what brands should we be looking from this point moving forward? I heard MSI and Azrock what else is good to go with?
I haven't been following much what's happening in the tech world but I left when Gigabyte was having some shady issues. If i don't want to buy Asus or Gigabyte graphics card what's left for me?  Or has Gigabyte redeemed themselves? MSI has not clicked for me either due to their inferior cooler performances.
I am very brand loyal - but now I'm also abandoning ASUS. Just built a new system for my grandsons using TUF Game Z790 Plus WF D4. The board is nothing but trouble. And the communications from ASUS were very similar to what you described: "Just try these BIOS adjustments..." and then when I went to ASUS, there were instructions to make a BIOS change, and then load a BIOS update. They did respond to emails, but it seemed like whoever was responding didn't read my email describing the problems. Like when we first fired it up, the WIFI did not work at all. Then, we couldn't get to BIOS at all - and we tried everything to clear the mobo...it just has been a let down from the get go.  Brand loyal. I still only use Intel processors to build with. But they will not be landing in ASUS mother boards for me again.
The Asus GPU side has not been solid.  They screwed up thermal paste and pad application on the Strix Vega 64 and then had serious thermal issues with the tuf 5700xt.   After all the issues with my strix vega 64 and the lack of support and bug fixes on my X370 Hero motherboard, I'll never buy Asus products again. I bought an Asrock 6800xt, and it has been rock solid.  My next motherboard will more than likely be Asrock.
Just wow, i was getting the ROG STRIX X670E-E and there is no Bios updates, none. Does this mean a Ryzen 7 7700x could get burnt as well?? Thank you!
I have an Asus wireless keyboard and sometimes it works like gold, others it goes completely haywire.
I once bought an ASUS monitor that had the fixed stand tilted about 3 degrees. I returned it, AND THE REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO TILTED. SO WAS THE REPLACEMENT FOR THAT ONE. Luckily the store gave me my money back when I returned the third tilted monitor. Thank you Jay for telling it like it is.
I have used Asus motherboards for decades.  The x370 board I got from them was so awful, I now have two gigabyte mobos in my systems instead.  I'm not shocked.  Saddened, but not shocked.
I have an Asus mobo, the amount of BS I've seen from sound card problems to refused RMAs in this board (x570 Crosshair viii formula) is something that has made me regret making my build.
How can a manufacturer LEGALLY void THEIR warranty with THEIR fix?  That is insane to even contemplate!  This is an explicit example that Right2Repair deserves credence as not being worse than manufacturer repairs.
@JayzTwoCents Do you know if this is an issue with previous generation boards too? I have an ASUS board and I have always suspected there is something wrong with the SOC voltages, even when set manually they seem to really fluctuate to the point where it looks like its still being controller automatically; leading to super unstable CPU performance.
oof
I cant say anything About ASUS boards because i dont own one but i have asrock x670e steel Legend and ive had no issues since i got it.
what fired by you 🤣😂 so is this not a big partly AMD's fault for releasing AM5 when it was absolutley not ready, rushed out to compete with Intel. you reap what you sow
I'm not advocating for any company here and I just wanted to share my experience with ASUS products. I build custom computers for clients, friends, and family. I've been building since I was 12 years old and have maybe 20+ builds on my belt.  I remember the introduction of the Nvidia 3000 series and many AIB brand GPU's were shipped with the wrong amount of MLCCs that were required by NVIDIA. The FE models came with six MLCCs and the only AIB GPU that was released with six was ASUS as I recall. This gives me a feeling of trust when it comes to quality control of ASUS GPU's at that time.   Having built on mostly ASUS motherboards, I really had not experienced any issues with BIOS or Driver issues except recently with a ASUS Z690-E WIFI BIOS update (Alpha) that I believe destroyed my motherboard (Reading is important if a beta BIOS voids the warranty do not use it). The RMA service was professional and had a turnaround of 1 week for my replacement motherboard. Although I believe the BIOS update was the culprit, I'm not able to confirm the cause and only informed ASUS what was relevant to RMA the motherboard.    On a side note, the IDPM design for the Z690 Intel 1700 socket is trash. I lowered my thermals by 10 degrees Celsius using a Thermal Grizzly Intel 12th Gen CPU Contact Frame.  With that said, I almost bought a Z690 Hero and was glad I didn't due to being a early adopter of the Z690 motherboards. I feel like Quality Control is getting worse TODAY, tomorrow is unknown to me. I don't hold much faith in Quality Control post, "Pandemic". I feel like the quality on everything has gotten worse since our country locked everything down and restricted people from working. It's 2023 and things are barely starting to get normal again. Hopefully quality control will get better in the future.  My Z690-E WIFI/i9 12900k is stable and working like a horse to this day.
This is a shame, I liked Asus as a brand. But after hearing about how shady they are, no longer am I a fan or will I recommend their products.
I gotta say, I had been using Asus for several iterations of PCs (and/or main components) I've used, and now I built a third last autumn and winter. And it will be the last one with ASUS, unless by the time I build a new one (which should ideally be some years in the future) they get their act together.  I've had no issues so far with my graphics card except for very annoying coil whine under load (but then I hear that's just normal with modern cards), but the first motherboard I bought was a Strix MB and it had a faulty ethernet chip. So I did some digging and found out, that chip had been known to be defective for years; Intel had done multiple revisions to fix the issue. But Asus refused to make sure they only used the newest generation of said chip (or another model altogether), so when buying any of these motherboards, you have a 1 in 3 chance of it being bad - possibly even higher. I got angry and spent more money on an even higher-end MB with two LAN and one Wifi chips (so redundancy would save me) but the news about Asus I've read and seen since makes me kinda angry about not having switched to, idk MSI or whoever is top dog next to Asus atm.  Also, some of their tools caused my system to freeze randomly in a very weird way. No clear trigger, just at some point the task bar would lock up, then the other apps one after another. Is a real pain if you're remote-connected to work trying to get things done. No fixes for that, just had to uninstall ASUS tools until the problem stopped occuring.   And I never got any customer support for either of those issues. They reimbursed me for the faulty main board, but only because Amazon has a strict return policy and puts customers first.
They will care when the Chapter 9 notice comes from the Board of directors.
still rocking a b 450 motherboard from gigabyte. paid 60 bucks for it. cpu is overclocked, board has been great. giga even added support for much newer cpus than were out when i bought the thing.
lmao so Asus isn't paying you to sell your audience advertising bs anymore?
BIG ROG fanboy here... X fanboy now i guess. @Jay - Respect the honesty! Keep it going brother! Putting your brand above free stuff is amazing!
I did Asus RMA often and their service center staff in India treats you like beggers always trying to prove you did something wrong with the boards. The best and professional service centers in India are Gigabyte ones, hence since last 8-10 years I'm buying Gigabyte boards and mostly they are cheaper than Asus counterparts still go years and years without issues, just they dont look that nice.
Good to know - I've been buying ASUS for my builds for years now. Thanks for the heads up I'll no longer buy a motherboard just because it's ASUS anymore.
TFW 90% of my PC is ASUS, and the rest is Corsair. Man.
Maybe things will improve when China takes them back lol
this is just a symptom of what it means to live in a FASCIST nation.  Welcome to the 21st century in 'murica!!!
MSI not much better! Got a B650 Tomahawk with a dead NIC. Send it back to MSI (Netherlands?). Took 3-4 weeks to get it back, with a notice that I had bent the board. I have been building PC's for 20 years, no way I bent a board!   That is just BS ...
its really too bad.  I used to love ASUS.  I have stuff from ISA VGA cards and Pentium mobos.  I have 50 or more ASUS machines.  Too bad there will be NO MORE.
Well i was think your problem only happen in vn now it's same in your channel 😢 . Ok i hope their new product rog ally will not happen with hardware too 😢
your issues sound more like a windows update issues
Damn. I was always an Asus fanboy, this is tough to watch. But I'm glad you are shining a light on it because it's going to be a consideration for me later this year when I look at upgrading my tower.
My first AM3+ Mobo was ASUS (FX 8350) My first two video cards were ASUS (R7 265 and R9 390)  My bad taste for ASUS came from a RX 470 card I bought a few years ago.. even with the fans set to max speed, it had some weird software issue where it would drop clocks down to idle desktop speeds while in game (300MHz). So frame rates would tank in game even though core temps were well under control. It might have been the VRM having issues or something in the cards bios.  Then I was looking for an AM4 board as my first upgrade in a few years. Watched buildzoid analyze VRMs of a few companies boards and got the MSI Tomohawk. After hearing about all this, I will probably stick with MSI until ASUS gives me a good pile of reasons to switch back.
Good for you Jay and I applaud you for always maintaining your integrity. I currently have a B450 Strixx and am going to replace it, because I as a consumer will no longer contribute or support their tomfoolery.
Well damn that sucks I've used and loved ASUS products for years. Guess I'll make the switch over to MSI or AsRock when I upgrade my PC from now on. What a damn shame.
I regret buying me ASUS X670E motherboard afterwards...
Even MSI and Gigabyte do this starting with the 5000 series. My MSI board brought my 5800x 5950x all to 1.45 volts with my xmp profile... The new 7000 series chips run hotter and cant handle this voltage. This issue is finally being brought to light...  EVERY brand does this. Enabling any XMP type profile should NOT automatically enable CPU OC. More people buy asus than any other brand.   Didn't  Gamers Nexus have 1 gigabyte board that did the same thing? 'We exploded the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D" is the title of the video.   Like holy F×÷+, when the firmware allows it the motherboard manufacturers abuse it and only blame 1 company, Asus.   AMD needs to fix their $*!+. Cant get higher ram speeds without OC that voids warrenty.. COOL Board manufacturers need to quit making EXPO and XMP enable CPU OC when you enable it... This happens on intel too.   So damn tired of these content creators... more like propagandists swaying the entire tech world with their narrow views. Everyone from LTT to GN and JTC all used to be big picture hopefulls. Now they are maurders...
I've been anti-Asus for a while, it's nice to see them tank. I owned 2 X99 E-W/S boards, which I tried getting some help from Asus because of - I think both were caused by some problem from the CPU "burning out the board" somehow - and all I got was a "bother someone else kid". I was willing at the time to pay up to the value of that board to have even one of them repaired, and nothing, just "bother someone else". I honestly don't know what I was expecting from them, but as you mentioned, condescension, was not it. They've been a trash company for a very long time, and what's happening to them now is very deserved.
Yo where are the backplates? Does msi have backplates? I've an x570 Asus Prime Pro... been one of the fuckiest motherboards I've ever had to deal with.
When companies do their best to hide their google reviews that tells me a lot about them. I dug up some and one of their offices in California has a 2.2 star review out of 100.
2 brand new Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi intel motherboards had hairs and dust in the cpu socket around the pins.  These were not RMA they were brand new.  I used my stereo microscope and tweezers to get them out.  Been in operation now for 3 months+ with zero issues.  The armoury crate is just a pile of junk and I will figure out how to remove it when I have time.  The Strix boards have z790 chipset that runs consistently in the upper 60C.  I put a fan on it to help cool it off, but made little difference, which confuses me.  I steered away from my Gigabyte board preference because of too many lockup problems on devils canyon boards.
OH no, what about the ROG Ally? would you take a chance on it?
Just wanted to mention that I personally really recommend AsRock boards. I've got taichi for my 8th gen intel build and I had zero problems with. Event better, I had -1 problem. There was something wrong with my friend's RAM, so we've put it into my board, it was booting for like 5minutes, but it worked, and after putting it back into my friend's computer it started working. (Yes we tried every possible combination in the friend's computer befora that, single stick in every slot, and so on)
Need to change the name from Asus to Biden
Asus cucked me with a X670E. To cut it all down: Refused to warranty a defective board, and tried to charge me for the repair.  Leading edge tech always has issues, but good lord asus can burn.
So is it am5 boards that’s going crazy? I got a crosshair hero vii and it’s amazing
these videos have a lot of complaining and ok, ill give you asus probably deserves it. but, i came here looking for more actionable info for people who already own these boards, and im not really hearing much about what can be done to prevent issues from occurring. Maybe there isn't anything but just hope? i kind of doubt it. any advice for someone who is running an rog strix 670E board and so far is gettting excellent performance and seeing no obvious issues, but is not worried mainly just because of videos like this? and yes, i have expo enabled and have updated my bios (running 7950x3d).
Yes, betas have been part of software and firmware forever. But so have hotfixes. And those are very different things.
I subscribed because you chose honesty over money, and I appreciate people like you. Now I will for sure, never buy ASUS. You did it to yourself ASUS. This kind of QC, and lack of care is all what causes sales to go down.
Awesome video thanks for the info! Asus lost my respect!
well thats two i have marked down for being bad now, hp & asus. will avoid thx!
Well, I was going with an ASUS X670E Hero a $600+ MB, Which is also exploding the 7800X3D which is what I was going to get, Any recommendations for a brand? I was looking at the MSI MEG X670E ACE, are they good?
This is super worrying, i have a 1800$ asus laptop that i love that recently bricked itself. I dont think it had anything to do with all this. But hearing that they're bad with customer support is not a great thing to hear
I have a Asus ROG Strix X299-E Gaming II Mobo, its my second one and I have the Corsair Vengeance 256 GB ram kit max speed. My ram spikes are all over the place and I have had many weird issues with stability for GPU as well. What is a better board for the 256GB DDR4 kit I have? I have plenty of power with a 3080ti and a AX1600i PSU with the Intel i9-10980XE CPU.
And here I am using my ROG mainboard BECAUSE of its software. Say what you want but the firmware of Asus boards is top notch. Firmware updates are easy and do not require CPU/RAM installed and their UEFI support is also solid. Comparing this to the gigabyte board I had before (I would have had to run a program on windows before firmware updating in order to not brick my board) I NEVER want to go back. I cannot judge the windows drivers as I run Linux, but I have never had a problem since I have bought it.
Thanks for sharing, this is extremely good to know. I was just gearing up to refurb my secondary rig that my kids play on and update my main rig and was going to go with Asus (because the products look good), but now i'm not giving them a single cent. I'm not going to support companies that are out for profits and do not care about their customers nor have any passion for what they do.
Use to think the avoid at all cost brand was biostar
What is a good alternative? MSI or Gigabyte?
Not just asus, but ALL BRANDS, take NOTICE….
guess what my next board wont be ASUS  lol
ASUS was the best brand for a while, but it’s not *the only* brand. And now that they’ve finally dethroned themselves, I look forward to the competition between the other companies as they each try to claim that empty spot as *the best brand for gamers*  Snarky edit: Good job, ASUS. Maybe you’ll be able to retake that spot in a few years. Until then, you’re just another bloated hardware manufacturer that deserves neither praise nor investment. And so I say, *Silence, Brand*
I have been a loyal Asus customer for more than 10 years now.. since I got my first gaming laptop ever. But honestly these past 2 years or so have been kinda not so good actually.. I bought the ROG Zephyrus G15 in early 2022 and allthough it is a great laptop and I love the specs and all.. it came with a dead pixel in the middle of the screen and my spacebar will press twice like 50% of the time. So when I actually  use   my laptop  to type   it will  always  do    this and it  is very   annoying  tbh..  The dead pixel is only really noticable when I have a black screen and I use my laptop connected to a gaming monitor and external mouse/keyboard... so it's not really that big of an issue. I don't think it's worth it to have to go through the support/warranty process and basically have to set up from scratch if they do send me a new laptop, so I just kept it like this. But you're so right.. I did send em a couple of e-mails stating my problems and they always seemed to reply with those kind of "have you tried updating your graphics card driver"   YEAH because the new driver version will magically turn a dead pixel on or fix a mechanic physical issue on my keyboard.  Super frustrating.. I then bought the ASUS SimPro Dock because my laptop was from the generation without a MUX switch and I wanted to be able to use my graphics card with my HDMI gaming monitor to get max refresh rate out of it.. The dock is super slick and all, but it will sometimes have a problem where the second monitor just goes completeley black. It will still be there in my display settings, the windows on that monitor wont switch back to the main screen.. it will just turn on for 5 seconds and then go black. The only way to make it work is to restart my computer with the dock still connected.  So basically, anytime my computer sleeps or is locked.. it will bug out like that. Obviously its a pain in the butt to have to restart my computer everytime I take it home and come back to my desktop... OR I just have to not lock it or let it go to sleep, EVER..   Same thing.. "have you tried updating your BIOS, etc.." after more than a month of back and forth mails with the Amazon seller where I bought it from, and they telling me to go directly to ASUS for warranty, then ASUS telling me to figure it out with the seller for a refund/replacement... I just gave up and literally have been enduring this for a year now.   Anyways.. if anyone even reads this sad story.. just want to say FRICK you Asus
As an Asus laptop owner, thanks for sharing. I will have to reconsider adding more things to this laptop in the near future. When did ASUS actually began to fail in quality of their hardware?
Well I’m going to find another option now for my next build . Was such a great product , and it’s hard to believe they let themselves go downhill this far . What’s recommended best case scenario for a MB now , and would you go with the same brand of graphics card as the MB ?
Bought an ASUS mobo in 2016 when I was getting back into PC building and it was DOA. Called support and had a nightmare experience just getting a replacement. Thankfully, the replacement worked alright but that service experience was enough for me to say never again to the brand. I'm a big fan of Asrock now.
I haven't bought any of these Asus motherboards. Hell, I don't even have the latest Ryzen chips (mines is a Ryzen 3 4100) but I know I'd be pissed if I had upgraded to these only to watch my new rig burst out in flames.
Makes me wonder if my Asus Rog Crosshair VIII Hero x570 has overvoltage going on as well, with my 5800X non 3D. Wonder if anybody has done the research on that if they’ve been doing it for awhile.
They've been doing weird cost cutting stuff for a while. I remember doing maintenance on a top end ROG laptop a few years back and there was not only obvious signs that it had been open but by someone in a massive rush that damaged flat cables, forgot some screws and stripped the cooling screws. The owner showed me the paperwork and swore that he got it brand new from a big store, which I'd believe since he wasn't the kind to ever consider 2nd hand. I'm glad he trusted me and that I document my disassembly because he could have made me pay for damaging his stuff. I've had other issues with MB mainly and stability but just thought it was bad luck...and always went through the store for replacement so couldn't imagine that Asus was this bad. But still haven't used any for my systems because of this.  It made me remember the final years of HP and Packard Bell long ago. I'd find melted laptop cases and such weird issues because they would often forget to remove the "peel me" sticker from cpu radiators and they would cheap out on solder then gpu chips would fail, etc.
When i first started building in the 6700k/gtx1080 era; i bought an ASUS mobo, had an issue, talked to a nice person at ASUS who walked me through it and since then have only bought ASUS since l... all of this makes me a little upset.
Wow!  For YEARS, I have always toted Asus as a brand where (yeah, you pay for what you get) you get great quality, great performance, and solid reliability.  However, hear the recent reviews and experiences from other builders it sounds like Asus has coasted for so long on their brand image that over the past years, they've been able to coast downhill and allow their company and name to be synonymous with garbage knock-offs.  They've become the Fry's Electronics of the industry.
ASUS is a complete joke. Terrible quality control.
This is disappointing to hear.  I've always liked the Asus products I've owned.  I've had a ROG laptop for a couple of years. It hasn't been perfect, but I've been pleased with it. I was thinking of replacing it with one of their ProArt Studio models next year.  I built my wife a Xeon workstation with an Asus board, and it has been great.  She hasn't felt the need to upgrade despite it being 5 years old now.  I have an i7 tower with Asus MB and video card that has served me well past it's intended life.  I've got an Asus board in a box for my son with a bunch of other stuff while he collects that last couple of components he needs. Always sad to hear a company I like taking an undesirable path.  I'll keep an eye on what others are saying.
Asus customer support is dogshit in India. They handed there after sales support to scroogy 3rd party company.
I don't know man - this just seems like a whole lot of butt hurt over them not signing another contract with you.
Asus are robbing people blind so they are over charging a loved asus products before
It is 💯 % true that Asus repair centers bend pins on returned motherboards to avoid repairs or charge money for repairs. I am on Z690 Maximus Extreme and it failed, just died completely. I packed it and sent it in for a replacement under warranty. Asus replied that it has bent pins. My board did not have a single bent pin. Sure they emailed me photos of bent pins, but I am certain that photos were of a different board. They charged me money for socket repair, but sent me a different motherboard all together. They are a scumbag company with terrible customer support and anti-consumer policies. F. u. ASSus.
LOL.. have you looked at the ASUS site today.. they removed the void info essay they had with the bios.. Priceless.
30 years ago I stopped buying Asus after getting screwed on 2 sp97-v mobos. Their solution then was the same. Push consumer to flash a firmware update to correct the issue and then abandon because of the flash. SSDD. Don't take my word for it. LOOK IT UP, or ask a greybeard. That was the last straw for me. Last fall after conversations with friends I decided to give them another chance. It's clear to me now that they just don't give a crap. Gigabyte in my future. This isn't new peeps. Just getting more attention now.
Man i have an roc asus laptop that has been pretty damn good..hope the company can come back
Aw, let's see why you're so sore at the creator of retail/mass-distributed wallhacks (The ASUS Advantage!)
why is that whenever anything bad happens people start blaming AMD before checking all the points of failure. After Ryzen, AMD has improved a lot.
I stopped using Asus around 15 years ago, when I had several boards in a row - all different types - where the USB headers fell off.  I already dont trust Gigabyte, after have 3 boards in a row where the Ethernet port was broken.  I am down to MSI - whoo I HAVE HAD issues with, and ASRock.  And perhaps some unknown Chinese brands :-0
You know what’s funny….I doubt the clown jooo lovers over at LTT will have the same stance. Good for you Jay!
Guessing they started tanking after the CEO switch in 2018. New CEOs can be a massive change in company direction, so not surprised to see the corporate sleeze ooze into ASUS after the change.  Been using ASrock since 2019 and been totally happy with it. Its got solid quality.
asus was crap when they do first pixels? i'm wrong?
Thank you for this video.  Have you found any solution to the Asus graphics cards being at 100% gpu utilization just ideling in Windows 11 Pro yet?  My rtx 3070 ROG and 3070 ti TUF both have this issue.
So is this only with ASUS motherboards? Or ASUS all together?
@Jayztwocents you can send me all or any of your ASUS / ROG stuff, I would be more than happy to have them - btw my birthday is coming ;)
Never Asus again
I made the mistake of buying an RTX 3090 from them. I've RMA'd it multiple times and they keep replacing it with faulty refurbished units. Between this and the board issues I've had, I'm just sick of everything. I don't game anymore; ASUS killed it for me. It feels like whatever I buy will have issues, so I'm done wasting money. I'm about to sell what I have to get something back from this disaster "dream PC" I thought I built.
I have an ASUS laptop and had no issues with it...after I removed all the software that came with it, including Windows. But it does make me think twice about considering them when time will come to replace it.
ASUS have already removed the message on the beta BIOS. Jay never said never. I give it a few months and your be praising ASUS products again lol
What brands a left now? Gigabyte, MSI and Asus all have terrible products and customer service.
When some family members built their computers, they each had different model asus intel boards that had the right two ram slots doa, and that was 9th gen I believe. Their replacements were ok, but that gave me a clue on Asus quality control. I haven't had an asus board since my M5a99fx, I've been MSI since and never had an issue.
14:05 I ran Asrock-Intel for a couple years, also had practically no issues. Upgrading to Asus-AMG, still have issues to this day. Every other day it's something new. From not being able to update bios, because my speakers are plugged in!? To like multiple monitors that would just go dead and stay dead, until I plug it out and back in again. Where I never had the issue with Asrock-Intel.  I've had good experiences with Asus in the past, and it's sad to see where they are and what they're doing. I hope they make a change for the better.
Life after ASUS please! Please make a new video about it! I don't know what to buy from now on! Thanks!
love the dubbed in "stuff" 1:14
I have a white Asus x470 prime board and all the usb ports broke within 2 months started with numerous disconnects if i had more then three usb devices plugged in, had to get a pcie USB card, they won't warranty it because xmp voids motherboard warranty. Or at least that's what they told me
quit ASUS products a long time ago. FOr me, in the past yeras, Gygabite is way better (and other brands).
I totally agree with you Jay! I've been using Asus products for very long time also. Since my last experience with Asus as far as motherboards and gpu's go I've moved on it would no longer purchase their  products based on both quality control and price. They are just out in space somewhere? They no longer live on planet Earth!
good video
Approximately two years ago, I began observing overvolting issues on my ROG Crosshair VIII Hero, coupled with the Ryzen 9 5950X processor. When default BIOS settings were applied, the CPU core voltage was automatically set to 1.48V. This configuration intermittently pushed the processor to achieve an overclocking speed of 5.2GHz, albeit momentarily, before reverting to its base frequency. This sporadic overclocking resulted in significant thermal issues due to overheating.  To address this problem, I customized a profile to constrain the CPU boost frequency at 3.4GHz and set the core voltage to a maximum of 1.35V. These modifications effectively mitigated the overheating issues by maintaining a consistent and lower operational frequency, along with an appropriately reduced core voltage.  Moreover, I own a 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3600MHz memory kit (composed of four 8GB modules). I've been confronted with an issue where, if I try to overclock the memory to 3800MHz, the BIOS does not proceed with the boot sequence. This issue persists despite contacting Corsair, who kindly provided a full replacement warranty for all four modules.  The recurrence of the problem, even after the RAM replacement, suggests that the issue may not lie with the memory modules themselves, but potentially with the Asus motherboard.
A"sus"
My last PC build (2021) had no Asus products in it.  It wasn't intention.  I just found better value in other places at the time.  In hindsight, I'm glad.  It's one thing to create a defective product by accident.  But to intentionally deceive your customers?  No way.
I've got a 12th gen 12700k using a Asus board before this bs came out and now it ain't looking good
Fired? They pay you not the other way around 🤡
I've never owned an Asus product - they are just more expensive than everyone else and this can range from small to large sums whereas a competitor would have the same or similar specs for less.
RIP Asus.
prices of MOBO's are stupid,  5 years ago you could get a nice upper mid tier/ low high tier for ~$300..   now $1000  GTFO
Asus fan boy karma lollll
Thanls for the video I am also saying good bye to Asus, my new bult will be MSI or other brand.
my asus rog phone 5 died in exactly 12 months. just after warrantly expired. shitty life. suddenly shuts down while charging and died. local technician said, motherboard replacement, which technically means it is dead.
We got your six!
Uffff and I'm in the midst of a new build with ASUS TUF basis (mobo & GPU minimum). Just started the return on both.
3 years ago I purchased an MSI Z390A-PRO Motherboard, an Intel G5400 CPU & 4 sticks of DDR 16GB Ram! Am looking to upgrade both the Motherboard and CPU while using the same DD4 Ram! What MSI Motherboard and Intel CPU would you recommend?
I just bought the rog ally lol
I have a asus laptop, its the 500 triton SE predator with the 3080ti, had few hiccups with it the first few days but runs all my games perfectly, now theur customer support is actual ass ive hears from many sources plus its not like ill ever need their help as im pretty tech savvy so i know my way around a laptop/desktop. Will i buy more asus products ? Yes if the pc meets my needs which is a working gaming laptop that can run anything i throw at it, will i buy a from a more preferable manufacturer? See answer above
Glad I went with an Gigabyte Aorus Master last time I built a PC now. In previous builds I had been using Asus for at least 1.5 decades.
Who ever put adds in here timed it perfect. 10:09 Started my twitch and this happened. Bam 2x15sec non skip able add😂😂
I got myself a asus tuf gaming f 15 laptop for christmas last year Yeah I do feel like it has very poor air flow there is like 3 little not even centermetre thick little slit airholes this thing needs airholes XD
so I am running x670e and a 7950x and my keyboard cuts out and headset all the time you are saying it could be the motherboard ????? also running corsair ddr5 6000mh ram and it will only run at 3200 every time I try the expo settings at 5200 it crashes. what am I doing wrong?
I've done many builds over the years for myself, friends, and previous jobs. I usually stick with Gigabyte (and occasionally MSI) as a personal preference but I bought an ASUS board (ASUS x570-e Gaming) last year for my latest personal build because of the RGB design. I just wanted something a bit more flashy for myself. I suffered through the pains of it for several months. TPM kept causing issues and failing causing Windows 11 to be unhappy, and I kept getting blue screens from a dozen different errors causing me to think my RAM and a rather expensive GPU were failing but it was weird because I would never get the same exact error twice, not even in the logs or in tests. Long story short (there were more issues including a daily fight with Armory Crate), the ASUS board was a disaster and I went back to Gigabyte. Not a single issue since. Sure it could have been just one bad board, but after watching this video, I think I'll avoid them in the future and stick to what I know works for me. Thanks Jay!
I was so close to buy Asus motherboard 2 months ago for 7950X3D. Lucky me I didn't.
I had terrible experience with Asus with Maximus VIII Impact, which has after 1 LN2 session stopped setting memory dividers other than JEDEC standard DDR4-2133. They denied my claim saying it was working as expected, leaving me with a useless board from OC experience. I said no more Asus after that, but I guess I was strong enough, got 2 M9A's and a C6H, but my main rig is on MSI ever since and I do my OC on mostly ASRock these days.
Personally, I've been saying this for Years. I would never buy another ASUS product again,  Have bought 2 High end ASUS gaming laptops in the last 5 years, They run so hot that they end up killing themselves. When you call about warranty's and such they say that they don't fall under gaming laptop warranty, because they are classified as notebooks, classic B.S would never buy from them again MSI for lyfe!
My reaction when I just finished building a pretty high end all ROG build: 👁👄👁  I haven't used it yet because I am waiting for my monitor but it was fine in testing. With that said, should I just not update the BIOS in the meantime? If it matters, I have the 7950x and the X670E Crosshair Extreme.
Is it just for the 3d model? Do I need to worry about my 7950x?
ASUS is no longer on my list of trusted motherboards.  They need to clean up their act.
Having just bought a Asus for my next build this is kinda disheartening 😅
The warranty void message has since been removed....
Thank you, Jay, for your honesty on behalf of the consumers.
Hey Jay I'm running an Asus b560 prime mb and an Asus tuf 3060ti I've had it for about a year and a half no issues sofar but didn't know if there is any thing I should watch out for on this set up also I'm on an i5 11600k and evga 750 bronze psu
Was already looking into getting another brand due to issues withy Bios, lack of basic features in entry level boards, etc... This is just the last nail in the proverbial coffin :/
I have never received a good asus board
Interesting how no one is talking about MSI , how they have been hacked and how actually all MSI users are at risk.
more like aSUSd
I just recently bought an Asus motherboard. When I heard this criticism, I felt they had duped me. I won't buy from them again if the customer support is that awful.
EVGA box casually standing there... :)
I'm glad people are waking up. I had so many issues with asus products in the past and the customer service was horrendous. I spent 2000 on a pg27UQ a few years back and I had to RMA it like 7 times until I eventually just demanded a refund. Quality control is utterly pathetic, especially for the prices they charge. I swapped to using Aorus motherboards.
So let me get this straight: Their product can cause catastrophic damage and so to avoid any warranty liabilities they issue a fix but label it as "beta" so it voids warranties when you use it? That's some evil villain shit right there.
usually this means the company has switched to china's ODM which use cheap product and now BIOS dev. It happens to all big companies . btw I am using asrock taichi X370 Taichi too it is really solid the only issue the wireless BT doesn't work
Used to buy Asus all the time. Now, gonna find other options. Thanks for the heads up! Love your site! My 2013 build with Gigabyte is still working fine, typing this on it!
Sucks to be american i guess. If this happens in Australia, there are soooo many failsafes for consumers that if there is any biteback from asus they will get so fucked by our government that itd cost them less to just replace every mobo they sold in the last few years. We literally seen just that with steam with this dinky ass country forcing them to change their refund and other policies.
I agree with both you and Steve on the ASUS issue...  I didn't realize that my 'ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WIFI' board was complete and utter junk until past the return period so I've been stuck with it until my next build (next year?).  I used to exclusively buy ASUS because I had great luck with them but now they are the last brand that I will consider.
Amazing to see people seeing ASUS in this light finally. I stopped using them years ago because of these type of issues. I had an old Z170 board from them that would cause a problem where I'd have to repeat literally every component except my processor once a month or it wouldn't boot. To fix this? I had to turn off ALL overclocks, even my GPU. ASUS just said that was an acceptable fix and didn't bother to replace it.   I bought an EVGA Z170 board and all of my issues were solved.   My Strix 970 was a completely underperforming card for a 970 and they said "its fine". When their stuff worked, it worked, but if you had problems, it was like pulling teeth.   I have a friend who bought one of their Rasberry Pi type PC things and when it was broken, they told him to just buy a new one.   Given all of these negative experiences, I've just told people never to use their products.
Glad this channel stands up mode the consumer.  Well said and thanks for the info.
Haha, his about to lose so many sponsors...for the drama... His obligation is to his pockets to stop the cap!
I put a post how ASUS took an RMA and when they sent it back, they couldn't bother packing the large ALL IN ONE computer well enough that it showed up busted.  Did ASUS pay my school back the $1000 it spent on the computer?  NO!!!  GFY ASUS!!!!  So where did my other post go?  It usually shows a person's post at the top.
I've been using Asus ROG Strix and been really happy with these products in the past. About to build a new rig soon to pass on my old rig to my kids. Does ROG Strix have the same issues as Asus normal products? Cheers for any comments on this.
I haven't had any issues with AMD, but I have had issues with ASUS products to the point I had to refund, order a new one, and refund again. Never again. My AMD Ryzen 9 7950x (not 3d) is a real beast and I am more than satisfied with its performance. I feel like they built up their brand and now they just try to maximize profits, which really fucks up their reputation
Customer care is dogshit
Wow crazy. But also i guess it is naive to think that brands stay the same for longer than 5 years anymore. All the people that made Asus what it is probably left already.
C'mon EVGA, I'm now out of companies to support for my next build. I've built a ton of mostly-Asus rigs and now I need to find another vendor. Asus was the last one I've been supporting but I'll never give them a dollar again.
This is too bad. I've used ASUS MB's and Cards since I first started building in 2015. Looks like I'll have to look into another brand or wait to see if they change course.
RESPECT sir.. waiting for LTT to address these issues
People really need to stop saying my ASUS motherboard or GPU works fine, I see no problem. Its about ASUS as a company not just their products. Good on Jay for doing this!
I've always had ASUS for all my custom builds and zero issues, even for the few RMA issues I had. Also I do not wield AMD so dont know how "affected" I am. Im still on the ASUS fan-bus, but again I never had any issues going on. Not going to leave a brand that works for me, because someone else had a problem... So untill it does I guess...
Asus is a company that never accepts their mistakes and me and other people had problems with very expensive motherboards Maximus V I could never make it post with my GSkill memory. They told me it was my problem. Recently I watched a clip from buildzoid that had the same problem with similar motherboard. I never bought an Asus product again and I feel very lucky!  Never buy Asus they have zero customer support and according to my experience bad over appreciated products.
I was just about to purchase an asus laptop, now I’m seriously reconsidering
I'm really dissapointed you didn't name your channel jayz 50 cent 😢
Its a shame to see Asus acting in this manner. I've had an Asus laptop for years and had no issues. I have a x570 and I particularly like their BIOS layout. I haven't had any issues, thankfully. It sucks that this happened but I guess money's more important to them. Thank you, Jay for sticking to your guns, and thinking of us over your sponsorships. 👍🏼I'm subscribed for life.
I’ve always stood by MSI. They’re branding is eh but the quality is 11/10
I'm kindof having the same issue of usb devices not working properly. I've got a ROG b650e-f with a 7800x3D, I use an Audeze Penrose headset and my USB Bluetooth transmitter stick either doesn't turn on, or doesn't connect almost everytime I turn on my computer. I have to unplug it and plug it back in almost every single time. As well as my mouse and keyboard getting intermitten power during the boot process, often which they don't have any power by the time I get to the windows 10 login screen so I'm stuck sitting there for anywhere from 8-10 seconds waiting on them to be usable. I would love some help or advice on this because I'm stumped.
Just canceled my order for Asus and AMD which was to replace my aging Asus Hero/AMD system. Went to Intel and Asrock. Too bad I already opened and started using my new Asus Thor PSU to power my new GPU. Nobody will see the PSU anyway :)
I had back then a Nexus Tablet which was manufactured by Asus.  One day the display didnt response anymore so I sent it in. They fixed it... two days later the problem appeared again.  There were no cracks or otherwise damaged part which I could have been responsible for. They rejected my warranty request without letting me know why. So, good look suing them for a 200-300$ tablet back then. Since then I am always hesitant buying ASUS...
Well, shame on Asus but then again "nyah nyah nyah my motherboard has the wrong *colour*" -- I mean come on, what's left for margin and playing the market when you have to have entire production lines customized to fad feels? Put the friggin computer under the table where it belongs and on the occasion put an EM compliant metal door on it. Can you imagine this in servers? "Oh HP Enterprise can you make me a purple motherboard and a webcam inside the pizza box so I can gaze at it on the KVM console?"
Shit i have a asus board and a 7800x3d… im panicking
Thanks for the warning was thinking about ordering one of their new handhelds but now i dont think so.
Sounds like Nvidia is in the same boat with their 4090s catching fire. Prior to the plague the support for anything has been shit, after the plague it has gone to complete shit for all companies
5:08 I worked for Best Buy in the US for a while and we were told specifically the word "Recall" is banned in the store. We couldn't say it, post it, or email with that word. Not that we didn't tell people of the products needing returned, but it was not a recall because that "looks bad."
Well I was just about to build a system with a ASUS TUF MB and that is not going to happen now because of this video. I hope I can quickly find a replacement.
In today's world, people aren't used to honesty, they're used to having sunshine blown up their rears.  Thank you for your HONEST opinion on this, it's quite refreshing.
Yeah, Lol. It's hilarious to think that AsRock is more reliable and a better choice than ASUS. SCREW ASUS!!!! When you start screwing the customer at this level, you deserve to be ignored by the customer base. I hope everyone boycotts ASUS and sends them a clear and hardcore message.
So who should I buy my next MOBO from then???
I'm never buying anything from Asus again. For such a large brand they have next to no customer service. I currently have an Asus motherboard and GPU, used to have a keyboard, too. To configure the LEDs on my system, I needed 3 separate software programs. They since merged them into two, which are still terrible. I can't control my motherboard/case lights without messing up the rest of my LED setup, including non-Asus components. It has to be on default now with a rainbow effect that I dislike. It may sound minor but this level of apathy, lack of care and lack of easy use is a great example of how bad they have become.

First time.jpg. They've been doing this for years. I stopped buying Asus once I had terrible RMA service from them. I received a refurb instead of a brand new board from them while it was still in warranty.
Asus mainboards are pritty bad these days ... My last one had severe issues and couldn't work after bios updates 😮
Guys, any thoughts about Asus laptops? Do you think that this anti-customer quality control affects the laptos as well? It is cheaper than others, so that makes me think about that as well.
Hm… this is making me rethink my Asus Ally Extreme preorder.
I think AMD should definitely sue Asus, they have done real genuine damage to the brand.
i have a asus laptop which was just a roller coaster to deal with. right now it won't even turn on and idk what wrong with it. motherboard looks good and power still flows cus the rgb lights turn on but idk. and then when i bring it to repair they waited until my warranty ended  and tried to charge me. don't even get me started on them steal my 1TB ssd.
LOL.. how pompous
Asus fried my x99 motherboard and cpu and refused to do anything about it. This is not a new problem
Asus has been bad with customer service since the very early 00's. They made good quality products in the early days but, you had to be completely tech-savvy and rely on yourself with any type of troubleshooting.
This is really sad because I've always used ASUS for their quality and great customer support. Several years ago I wanted to build a "triple A" theme build. I am using an AMD R5 5600x with a RX6800, all ASUS products except for the case and memory, and Adata XPG "ROG Strix certified" 16gb ram. The total build, including monitor, peripherals, and streaming accessories was around $2700-$3000. It is very powerful and efficient and has been solid for the past several years. I will continue to use this build as I believe it is still relevant for today's most demanding titles. However, if ASUS (and AMD) don't get their act together by the time I need to replace a component or upgrade to new hardware, then I'm looking elsewhere. I am very loyal to a brand that is loyal to their customers.
I bought 2 Vivobook Flips last year. They are the worst laptops I've ever had. The corners started falling off, the drivers don't work and it blue screens all the time.  Customer service was so scammy, denying the problems and telling us we'd have to pay for postage and repairs. Their products are vastly overpriced also, so even without these serious issues, I'd avoid them.  I'm upgrading soon and have no desire to go near this dodgy brand again. There's plenty of much better options to choose from, so it's an easy move. Greedy, dodgy companies like ASUS deserve to crash, to make room for good, honest companies that sell good, honest products.
Fuck. I did a new build last year with a CROSSHAIR X670E HERO, and have had lots of RAM problems and slow post times.  I hoped I was the exception, but it seems not. Not doing that again.
I'm in the UK and pretty much ditched Asus back in 2007 after going through 3 Striker Extreme mobos with the dreaded 'CPU INIT' error! (Remember that? 😱) Went Gigabyte/MSI and have never looked back since!
ASUS Motherboard: Your mission, should you choose to accept it [....] If you try to update the BIOS, ASUS will disavow your warranty. This motherboard will self-destruct in five seconds.
Sounds like the company I work for as well, Schlumberger.
im not 100% in this loop but only know a tiny bit but im scared a bit cause i have a Asus board B650E-F and a 7950X idk if thats in the loop of blowing up or not
I built my first desktop on all asus parts in early 2011 on X79. That machine is STILL working (now as a plex server) so its truly sad to see their decline qhen once upon a time they were among the best.
I understand the reasons why but, I’d like you to still cover their gear because it highlights the problems they are having which with a bit of luck they end up changing.
I had two Rog Strix motherboards with issues before this aired and I did jut that, fired them and I will never buy anything from them again. Their tech support was horrible, yeah no thanks. My MSI edge z790 is amazing I'm staying with msi.
So you're saying we need a us made brand?!
I dont have any confidence in amd not asus, i have never had problems building and running pc's for multiple users, just dont use amd and you will be fine amd have always been unreliable cheap parts
I have had Asus Support issues back in the N-Force chipset day's. They would advertise things on the box what the board would not do. When you contact support they said buy the more expensive board when you did that it worked better but still not the what it was supposed to do. But the support team was not doing anything with that info. It was take it or leave it. So after that no more Asus for me. (only Asus board i had after that was for a 2600K i think P67 if i remember correctly). There are enough other brands like Evga, Asrock, GA and MSI that also make good boards  and that have better support (never needed Asrock support so i dont know how good that support is. But had good experience with MSI and great experience with GA in the past but that was a quite a few years ago after that i luckly  never needed it). Its sad to hear Asus is still dropping the ball and it seems even worse now. Pushing bios versions that void warranty removing the ones that do have warranty but destroy your CPU and board. And the new Beta bios still overvolts the CPU to a level that could damage it but you lose the ability to claim warranty. Thats just awful.  Never understood why people went for Asus. When asked they just like the brand or had board or cards from them before. So i guess they never tried anything else and Asus does have better marketing compared to the other company's so i guess that helps in making the brand bigger. I hope people will now think twice before buying Asus products. And hopefully Asus will learn from it. But looking at my experience from years ago and the fact stuff like that still happens it does not really seem a priority for them.  And about the GPU side they also made some mistakes there. TUF coolers where horrible some gen's back. GN and or HWU did some reviews on those.
ASUS is dead to me. Never buying any of their producs again, when they pull shit like this.
Seems like a Prime opportunity for AMD & MSI to throw a Godlike his way toto fix his X670E build
My Asus crosshair 8 hero has also been having usb Issues. Updated bios and issues started.
Agree re. ASUS's software quality getting even worse - But let's not pretend ASRock isn't still garbage just because one board has been stable. Buy EVGA if you want 'started good, still good'.
In our friends circle, 3x Asus Prime B450 boards went bust in the last 2 years.  Maybe Intel is lobbying Asus to make bad AMD stuff 😅
Nice video Jay Z! do you sell the giant pad you have on your table? its awesome.
Hey, it's not just mobos. I bought a 2020 Zephyrus G14 and the bottom third of the screen completely crapped out after a year and a half of usage. The fan vent exhaust aims directly at that portion of the screen, so that's probably the culprit. Anyway, ASUS has been absolutely useless in the warranty department. I give up. This video only furthers my resolve
I am also fed up with getting some of the countless piles of 'free' stuff being a bit dodgy. I did get 100  free expensive things but I can only take so much. 2 or 3 dodgy bits and that's it.
ASUS just removed the void warrenty clause from their Beta bios
Love it when the business boys start getting a bit above themselves in regards to how they treat customers, hopefully this video and others have enough of an effect for them to realise
So objectively, what's the next next thing after Asus GPUs? Seems MSI doesn't do a proper cooling so I'd rather avoid that, too. Gigabyte?😮 And what about MBs?
ASUS also blatantly engages in false advertising on their website. They clearly advertise certain features for a specific model. But when I received the computer I found it doesn't include that advertised feature.  I contacted ASUS support, they took no responsibility, claiming it's the buyers responsibility to confirm the specifications & features advertised on their own website with the place of purchase.....  Pathetic....
I'm torn between whether getting the Asus rog ally now, or just keep my steam deck 💀
I was done with them back in 2016. ROG Hero VI. Glitch in the BIOS caused an RTC clock fault where the clock got frozen in time. They refused to patch it as the boards were just out of warranty.  Sad to see things have degenerated to where they can't count voltage and fry CPUs, then try to cover it up.
Given ASU’s attitude towards its customers ~ me  - in they said not our problem,  a portable monitor which was advertised with a stand - (no stand in box) and you can’t buy it separately, that was there response to the shops Assistant asking them if they could send one .
On my B550 A Gaming Mainboard i have different issues, too. Not booting the system after overclocking the CPU right from the Board Tools. Not from the first Time. It boots a couple of Times and from on booting to another the Bios false. I have no Reason why. Another Issue is, disconnecting my Bluetooth Devices. They're connected on an Asus Dongle. From a Second to another the Dongle is disconnected from the Board. I have to pull it out of the USB Port for reconnecting my Devices.  Asus are no Gods. But, you have to pay them, godlike. They're like the Church. Pay, pray, but there'll be no answer back to you!
Asus is my favorite brand. It's really sad to see this decline and that bios update is completely unacceptable. Hopefully this is a wakeup call. I bought a Z690 D4 TUF board 6 months ago and couldn't be more happy.
its like they didnt want to admit that the problem was so simple.  id like to know who exactly set the bios to 1.4V and why,  and why is it they still set the voltage a bit high at  1.33?
I bought a 7800x3d, my first AMD processor and bought an ASUS ROG STRIX B650E-F GAMING WIFI mobo, my first asus mobo. And while the cpu performance is good, the time till from turning on and reaching POST is over 1 minute! Shutting down the computer just returns to desktop (turning off fast system start or how its called in english solved that). Its just a shame for this price...
You're officially of Asus Christmas list=💀
i was just about to buy a ASUS ROG B550 motherboard, my first new computer build in 10 years, but i won't now because of this video and the issues explained within but also due to principal
Probably a new ceo came in and screwed over the customers, workers, and brand name, so he could take the money and run.  Their stock benefits should only allow them to buy the shares at the end of their term to ensure that they at least attempt to strengthen the company over the long run.
They have supplied the board with an untested bios which destroys your equipment.   I ordered an x670-p prime board and have now cancelled.  If a ship was supplied with a big hole in the bottom (but the ship builder provided a band aid sticking plaster to cover the hole(and by applying the sticking plaster gives a legal get out clause for the ship builder)), would you want to go for a holiday cruise on it?  Thanks for the info Jayz
A few years ago I bought a Laptop from Asus. Windows 10 was pre-installed and their graphics driver turned the colours on the display into a sepia tone by default. Even though I had deleted that software, it'd reinstall itself every single time and forced me to reinstall Windows 10. Bought it online and couldn't afford to return it, so I had to accepted it. exactly a year later, the hard drive died. That along with the wifi constantly disconnecting itself, I decided to no longer buy from them. Seems as though I wasn't just really, really unlucky. Their quality control is actually just a joke and don't want to take any responsibility for it.
I used to trust ASUS even allowing some premium pricing, but well that's in the past.
You got ASUSED
I’m using the x670e crosshair hero with a 7950x and a 4090 and for some reason whenever i stream google chrome on discord for my friends the audio gets all static and extremely loud to the point where I jump to take my headset off and just recently this past week all the games I play for some reason have been crashing for no reason. A lot of things online say it could be the graphics card but I updated the drivers and this was my first pc and don’t have other graphics cards to test so could this all be from the crosshair hero?
As of 5/15/23, it seems like they updated the disclaimer on the beta bios. The warranty disclaimer is not part of the BIOS discription (Strix x670e-e Gaming). Maybe the company listened?
ah i recently bought b660-g from asus. I used to buy asus laptops (still use them). and was very happy with quality. and still i am. My new mobo is something i am getting familiar with. seems decent but i didnt like i couldnt install previous version of bios(should be possible probably). So far no issues with my mobo and its 12400 - why i bought this? i wanted solid single core performance, its for workloads in blender. seems for this it may work well. ofc. its budget solution but why not if it serve purpose. BCLKd it some 12 percent without touching anything else. seems like nice extra.
Sounds like EA blizzard
Would love to see you pack up all of the ASUS stuff (boards, cards, etc...), put them into a big box and ship it back to ASUS. Besides this video that would be a statement. :)
Hey Jay, this kind of trouble blows my mind even amongst the current ASUS chaos. Do you consider the white NZXT Z790 motherboard reliable?
I remember my friend bought an Asus motherboard. The bios on was bad encrypted. It couldn't read ram no matter which ram you threw at it. And I'm an ASRock fanboy. I loving my steel legend motherboard from ASRock.
Building PCs 20 yrs and I only ever use Asus. Never had a problem ever, but that stops now. Never again will I touch an Asus product. Scummy Corporation.
I've always been a Asus "fanboy", always bought and sworn to their GPUs and Motherboards. This saddens me so much.  I am currently looking for a reliable brand to replace them. I have only had bad experiences with MSI, so I don't think I'd go that route. Currently considering going for EVGA.  Any suggestions?
I remember some people that had Asus gaming laptops and the joints on their screens( the folding part of the laptops) broke after a few months. It came to the point where they were using the laptop connected to a monitor to use their "laptop". Mind you, they only used their laptops at home and never took them out anywhere. They regretted buying Asus laptops after that and refused to buy anything Asus ever since.
I started staying away from ASUS many years ago and I didn't know why exactly, I just felt that their products were starting to become more flashy then quality.
I have an ASUS studio book windows 11 and I'd like to avoid any BIOS update, I read that the update often times comes automatically with a windows update. Any ideas how I can prevent windows updating BIOS automatically.
Not every or nay content provider/influencer has the stones to to tell it like it is and much less publicly fire a sponsor... Jay, huge respect and admiration for speaking out for those of us being stepped on with no voice in the matter!!! As of watching this i returned my Asus MB and went with a Taichi... Thx again Jay!!!
ASUS GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER BEFORE YOU GO UNDER YOU F STICKS.
Has this kind of problem already impacted Asus laptops? I was about to purchase a pretty expensive one...
Been buying ASUS products for years and been my go-to-brand, not anymore.
This is so weird. I was the biggest ASUS fanboy you could have. Then I decided to also get an ASUS phone, and it was after that I realized they actually also make some bad products. The sound was so bad, I stopped using it after a month. Been building pc's for a couple of decades now, and been using only Asus since about 2003. I will personally be looking for another brand next time, I am actually so disappointed. Your experiences only fortify my new view on them.. and your words about them getting their act together sooner rather than alter.. I am afraid that is too late.  Thanks for your insights on this.
Ive never liked Asus
<dark twisted humor>  "Imagines a ASRock dancing on the ASUS remains."  </dark twisted humor>  Coming from the "dark ages" of Super 7, my go to was the ASUS P5A.  Decided to sit with my 5900x on a X570 Taichi with 32G of "non-QVL" F4-3400C16-8GSXW.  ✌  (i.e. Never buy the first year model of car)
So, I bought an ASUS "gaming laptop", it fried itself somehow and I RMA'd it. There was an issue with the thermals on the CPU and it would just lock itself to 400mhz. Before RMA'ing it, I did redo the thermal paste in it, no luck same issue persisted. I was truly disappointed.  Later, I bought an ASUS motherboard for my 5600XT AMD chip. I built it, and the first time I turned it on, it popped the CPU - CPU just died. That's when I gave up totally with ASUS as a brand.  Since then, I've only used ASRock boards in my builds, even for my friends. I've built 6 PCs using ASRock's Steel Legend boards. I've never had an issue with those, ever. Out of the box, it just works.  ASUS, which is supposed to be good, just builds e-waste, in my opinion. It's been coming since 2018-2019 already. I'd rather not buy their products - I've just had bad luck and it's just cost me money.
every since my asrock 970 caught fire and destroyed everything i been using asus my system has the x670E strix now no issues so far with my 7700x but i do not update bios unless i have issue
This is sad because I loved Asus. Thanks for the info! Which brands do you recommend which have both good reliability and good customer service?
5:44 there was an msi source code leak soooo…. Be careful updating your msi stuff.
So Asus is Anus *ba dum tss*
It has been Asus in my builds for years, i am considering another brands now
I’ve never bought Asus. I’ve always had a bad feeling about that product. I’ve been happy enough with Alienware/Dell products. I’m aware it’s overpriced however I have been taken care of if I had issues. It’s a stable product for me.
I'm glad Asus are being called out. They've had some sketchy products outside of the pc space too. I remember the tf103c transformer pad which was a premium and quite useful bit of kit, but a firmware update that upgraded the android version made it slow, unstable and plain unusable - and never an update to correct the disaster. Not long after the update the touchscreen became unstable  and just wouldn't work on boot up depending on the orientation of the tablet - something that turned out to be a common experience. By comparison, my old nexus 7 (made by Asus) still going strong.
Asrock keeps sending motherboards with factory bended pins on their intel boards.. i make like 5-10 custom PCs per month and i stopped ordering Asrock stuff because i got 5 boards refused RMA because its a user error and it came bended..
And here I thought gigabyte was bad.
It is sad when a company does this.  I know you do not do videos like this unless the company is a threat to customers.  Thank you for sticking to your guns and doing this video, it is appreciated. Terry from Australia.
And now with how they lied about their Steam Deck clone’s specs and capabilities, they’ve lost all trust I’ve had in them.
ASUS will be bankrupt by Q1 2024
This is kind of like pny and zotac, no one trusts them for nvidia cards but they have better warranty than asus, msi and gigabyte.
Thank you for the unbias review
Specing a new build . Bye asus, its either asrock or msi now.
So it looks to me like ASUS have removed the warranty void writing from their BIOS download page. Is that an improvement or worse, tho?
Anyone remember Abit motherboards? They even had a dual celeron board once. What the hell happened to Abit?
This sucks. I wanted to stay loyal to this brand. They've been doing right by me for so long at this point...
ASUS IS GONA DIE
ASUS has been my goto motherboard from my first build in the early 2000s. But after z490 every board I brought had major problems. 5 straight mbs. And with the prices nowdays, I will never again buy another board from them.
OK now that I think of it... I have had several FAILED Asus products I just didn't add them all up: Asus TUF 15 inch laptop with dodgy WiFi chip - this was the least of them, just replaced the WiFi chip -- all good, Another Asus laptop: Asus ROG Strix laptop with faulty keyboard/motherboard... Asus had to replace the motherboard on it twice... fingers crossed it doesn't fail again since it's out of warranty now... and I had an Asus Zenfone which had a miswired USB-C connector that nearly caught fire while charging and melted it's cable, I found a single cable that wouldn't short on it and continued to use it but thinking back that was another failed ASUS product... that said my main PC motherboard, and my USB DAC and a few other products are still ASUS... I'm going to have to start buying MSI or ASROCK or Gigabyte (shudder)... any suggestions for motherboard brands going forward... random youtube commentators? I was a ASUS mobo + EVGA board guy before... RIP
I have avoided ASUS for a few years now since their MB melted my system. Glad to see the; community now rejecting this terrible brand.
Thanks for that video, I was so close of buying newest ROG gaming laptop, but now I will look for my other options, any suggestions for good reliable brand/model? Many thanks in advance
Asus is 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Making me glad I went with my Gigabyte board instead of my fanboy Asus a couple years ago. My Rampage Extreme IV was and still is an amazing and durable board. It survived a car crash that tore the GPU parts ways out, along with the pcie slot. It gave me the upmost confidence in their brand, but I didn't want to upgrade until I absolutely needed to. Really only did so, so I could run VR.
my latest build was a pro art z790 because at the time I'd like to have my thunderbolt 4 ports work for certain peripherals to work. and you guessed, there is power supply issue for the connected device to work. Some would suggest to use an independant home socket. But that just sounds ridiculous and stupid. Apple thunerbolt were never like that. My lenovo, gigabyte laptop didn't need that. Yet a 1200w PSU driven desktop cant put out enough power/overall throughput with their thunderbolt 4. If its no for certain apps to support i'd fully swich to apple and no to deal with all these complexity. A prodcut should just work as intended wthout fuzz and marketing crap.
I had sworn off ASUS about 5 yrs ago when a new motherboard of theirs failed and when I rma'd it they claimed I damaged it.  The problem was a bad trace on the board.  I took care of it and have built at least 100 pc's in the past.  I haven't supported them since.  Doesn't sound like they have improved either.
I gave up on ASUS 10 years ago. I lost all respect for the crap they pulled with me.
Is the B550m tuf gaming board a problem board?
Thank you! ❤
I'll never buy anything ASUS ever again. Bought a RT-AX89X even it dropped, never worked right. Sent it to them, they lost it when they sent it back.  Bought a z690 board & a USB port was bad, took it to MC & got a z790. That board had bent pins, finally got a good one on the 3rd try. I'll never buy a mobo, GPU, router, or anything from them.
Aboard shouldn’t cost more that $200
Never had an issue with ROG and I’ll continue using them, if these are your best anecdotal arguments. Entertaining channel though, glad the angry indignation shtick works for you. Cool thumbnails and titles, too, here’s your click.
Make EVGA great again
Wow. Really hate to see this. I've used Asus since forever. Always recommended it to others. Western Digital spinning rust was the same way. Hopefully we'll see some heads roll and Asus can restore it's old, well deserved reputation. Until then, I'll consider MSI. Had good luck with them when building "economy" machines.  I think I'll start filming unboxing of new product so that I can prove that I didn't crush the CPU pins or reverse that capacitor.
I have been an ASUS fan for some time now, but with this current PC, I'm not so sure...it may not be an ASUS problem, but I have been getting blue screened to death recently from watching youtube videos...I check the temperatures after a reboot, and there seems to be no issue...This PC ran flawlessly for 2 years, then all of a sudden this...Getting to be a pian. Can play games all day flawlessly which should be much more taxing, but to watch youtube...I am at a loss for words.
i`ve had some problems with my z590 rog strix mb regarding the bios drivers. My games crashing because i had a apex bios driver(dont know when was installed, maybe from aura) and I waited a half a year to give us Intel ME updated driver to solve the problem with my rams that dont wanted to overclock.  I was stuck in 3200mhz. Now everything is fine.
Asus send me a product that works. Or sue me for being honest and your product sucks.
I cant even use dual m.2 ssd at the same time. I'm stuck with only using 1😢.. will never buy another ASUS motherboard ever.
Ive no dog in the game. Or the hunt. Whatever burned once shame on them burned twice shame on me.
I just bought a Asus Zypherus G15 :(
I still have jbs 25 dollar bottom shelf tablets. They dying but still function. Asus tablet lasted almost 2 years and just died. No reason i can discern. All i know they sent a kill command.
Asus has SO dropped the ball, and have tripped over it several times - and I'm wondering if they even want to pick it up again.
Ill never trust asus. Ill now call em anus.
Vote with your wallet people.
I'm now on my third PSU for my X570 Tuf Gaming Wi-Fi in just over 3 years.  I've never had these sort of PSU issues before as I am a light user.  Perhaps you've uncovered something.
Fun fact, gigabyte's aorus x570 also burns CPU's. Today it's time to RMA my new 5950x which was working one whole day. Well wish me luck with that. by the way never more hardware from both ASUS and Gigabyte
That's not the ASUS I've been used to years ago. That sounds more like an overpriced AliExpress...
I have a problem with an ASUS motherboard keeps popping up with CPU fan error sent it back they tested and no fault. Got it back worked fine so weird and 1 month later CPU FAN ERROR again😢 rgb lights flickered every once in a while. So everytime I start my PC it loads to Bios everytime I have to discard and exit everytime just to load into windows so frustrating
I own an Asus ROG strix 15 laptop. Well, one and a half. This is my second ROG (and probably last), 3 years ago i have bought one, after 1,5 years it had a minor issue with cooling fans going 100% when it was not hot at all. Few months after warranty ended, it just turned off and never switched on again. The repair was more expensive than the value after repair, so i left it as a paperweight. I have bought another one, also ROG, and after few months i had 4 bad pixels on it (ok, it happens). Another few months later i have discovered some issues with the matrix hanging on specific position of opening (frozen screen that stays like that untill you touch the cover and/or reopen it). Send it to warranty. Laptop has returned to me, with new matrix... and no possibility to switch it on. Another return, this time it was turning on, working fine, after 2 days, black screen, and not moving further than the asus welcome logo. Another return, but this time no possibility to press some buttons (no reaction to shift, windows key etc). Installed all updates (including bios) and no change.  Another return and asus claimed it was a wrong bios (when 3 times before it was same version bios installed and was working fine). All of the above lasted almost 2 months. The issue with freezing matrix is still here.  I travel a lot and take my laptop with me, have no time to send it back and forth and receive the unfixed device from them....  So despites i love the design of it, i will pass on my next purchase.
THANK YOU FOR NOT SELLING OUT
You know what that is ...  it's the universe telling you to STOP doing FART noises on your videos !
Yes, their graphics card division was definitely still solid for the 3090's at least. Remember the fiasco with the 3090's & that Amazon game killing them due to cheap power capacitors? Asus TUF 3090's already had higher quality caps that worked well.  (Although mine did eventually sag & i had to buy an extra support for it.)
Thanks for this Jay and team. We rely on information form sites like yours (and Steve's and Linus's) to help us make decisions. I have been a diehard Asus fan for decades. My current MB had some issues (more with their BIOS) and it took a long time to figure it out. I am looking at upgrading right now to the Intel 13 series and it won't be an ASUS MB this time. I am going to look at MSI for my next board. Thanks again for the heads up!!! Cheers!!
Im working on my first build right now and asus just fell off the list of potential parts immediately wtf
I stopped buying asus when they refused to repair my motherboard which was under warranty.
I must say that ASRock boards appear to be fairly decent quality these days!
What's funny is that ASRock started life as an ASUS spinoff (hence the similar logos). Now they are owned by Pegatron.
Well.... which manufacturer produces reliable HW nowadays then?  ASUS are the only ones that haven't burned me yet. MSI, ASRock, Sapphire, Gigabyte.... they all made some PoS HW that burned me and made me stick to ASUS. And technically, ASUS still hasn't burned me.
GN: ZOMG!  Corpo malfeasance!!! This was a deliberate fraud right from the start!!! Hanlon's Razor doesn't exist!!!1!  LTT: Ju$t Tru$t Them, Bro - our Corporate Overlord$ know be$t. They're fixing the problem a$ fa$t a$ they can (and fixing their mi$$tep$ of damage control). Thi$ i$ fine!  JTC: Whether it's malice or incompetence, I don't want them anywhere near my rigs; good-bye. *locks door*  Thank you for having the level-headed analysis of this and cutting through all the corporate spin and guff and get to the heart of the issue: ASUS can't be trusted anymore, regardless of the source of the problem.
I should have gone with MSI...
Million views in 3 days... ASUS had better get their shit together... It's bad enough they are forced to deal with NVIDIA'S $HTUPH but there's just horseshit. I have the x670-E... Plus WiFi And I unfortunately just installed this... I hope I didn't brick my fucking system. I spent $4700...
Was about to buy a new mobo+CPU. Had an ROG Strix selected, but after seeing this? Going to change to someone else now. Customer service is important to me, and MSI has been good. Not great, but better than what I've been hearing so far...
I know this is not related to motherboards, but i bought a few asus tuf gaming accessories (mouse, mousepad, headset) and they were awful. I quess quality is similar in all their stuff now.
Fun fact: just because a manufacturer SAYS doing x will void your warranty doesnt automatically make it so! Thats been established law for decades, but the public doesnt know. "Warranty void if this sticker is removed" is an absolute lie!   You have to do something that directly leads to the fault to legally void your warranty! Ex: if you replace a fan and the audio developes a problem, the burden of proof is on the manufacturer to prove you replacing the fan directly caused the audio syatem to have a problem.if they cant, then legally they need to fix the audio problem in warranty.
Solid as an "Asrock".  hahahaha....glad i made it this far; the levity reminded me why i watch this channel.  I needed that bit of hilarity in the middle of your nightmare.  thanks for letting us know what is up in the real world.  It's difficult when these money grubbing manufacturers are taking advantage of consumers who no longer go through retail stores and have little to no recourse as consumers.  Seemingly this has become their business model.  F'em.  Keep up the good fight!
Steve is great!   Jay n crew awesome too!   Great community!
Two words.  Law.  Suit.
Wow. A major decision, but well-earned it seems. It's always amazing how the greed and/or incompetence of a handful of people in key places can doom an entire company, and (be allowed to) spoil decades of hard work building the brand, over the span of a few months or weeks.  Also, sounds a bit familiar. I bought a new ASUS motherboard a couple years back and received a clearly used one (dust around CPU, also immediately failed POST and of course wasted many hours of my time). I blamed retailer (Newegg,) but now am leaning towards that "mistake" actually being ASUS policy to resell used items as new. (Newegg sent a replacement, cross-shipped free, has been fine thankfully.) After all of this is there is zero possibility that ASUS will my first choice for anything for many years. I hope they immediately start the long journey to earn back the community's confidence and respect... but I'm sure they won't bother unless they see sales and profits decline.
Ive had an awful experience with their ultra fragile gamer phones they provide almost no support for and extremely expensive, and even harder to find, replacement parts.  They seem to make these phones purely for mindshare/marketing reasons, not as a genuine product. They design them so that you only want a slim Cover so you can take advantage of all the bells and whistles, yet its design is soo frail you're almost guaranteed to break the screen if you dont fully encase the hot phone with an aftermarket foldover case and a screen protector. Which will prevent you from using the fan cooler they provided."State of the art gorilla glass" my dck.
Ty been having issues with theyre motherboards for a while
I am updating my asus mother board, I hope it doesn’t die
I bought a Z690 board. it worked fine with a 12600k until i put in a 13700k. a month later the m.2 slot didn't recognize and the memory would only run at 4800mhz. upon taking the cpu out i found 1 slightly bent pin. fixed it and it still was screwed. sent back to asus who rma'd and sent replacement board. however that replacement board lit up but wouldn't work with any cpu with any bios. good bye asus
Hopefully Asus hasn't killed your CPU. With that being said. I've used ASRock motherboards for years since bulldozer and haven't had a problem with them. My last build was a ASRock aqua x570 with a 3950x still running with no problems. I liked the MSI GPU so i tried one of the motherboards unfortunately it died after about 2 yrs so i went back to ASRock. I've used Asus motherboards for friends builds thankfully with no problems. I will be steering clear of them now!
This really is all it takes to put someone off a brand FOREVER.
So interesting, I stopped using ASUS around the early 2000's when they had exploding capacitors issue. Went with gigabyte since. It seems since then ASUS improved got more popular and then got bad again.
Asrock was a spun off  from ASUS lol
Damn, my ROG B360-G mobo has been solid for the past 5 years and still rocking.
Hey Jay, I've been watching your channel for a few months now. Big fan, it's because of you that I have decided to upgrade my PC from the ground up by myself. Thanks for that. My concern is that I have a X670E-A Asus MB paired with AMD 7950x. Should I be concern at all?
I have seen ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte board and i must say.  I would not give up ASUS  just yet.  because Gigabyte and MSI are worst.  MSI board don't look like it was design properly and the manufacturing of the board don't look like it is done professionally ( i never used this company but seeing there quality make me lose confidence before i buy it and give it a try).  Gigabyte board.... never never go with this company, I had 3 board return all broken before warranty ended.  I did get a new board each time, which was okay but to have 3 broken one after another before 1 year warranty end... i would never go with this company.
Yeah I'm done with ASUS.  Excited to see the competition fill in the gaps.
Wtf? I love my old ROG3 phone! 😢
Hi I’m Nancy
I had bought a z790 gaming Wi-Fi’s board from asus and it had bent pins out of the box direct from Microcenter.  Replaced with one from Best Buy and did not have the same issue.  Though it’s certainly not as stable as my msi z690 gaming WiFi was.
BIOS updates from the manufacturers should never void warranties...
This is kind of a master class in how NOT to handle a product defect.
Got Asus b570 plus wifi. Love it, but yes, software is crud! Took me nearly a month of experiments to discover that armoury create was killing my system every 1-2 hours (BSOD with any error you care to mention).  Finally rebuilt without armoury create and have had system running solid for 2-3 days.  Hardware, awesome Software, absolute crap
My old Asus Z170 board had issues with my 6600k, haven gotten Asus since lol
I could feel this coming last year, when ASUS prices jumped to almost 2K and the AIO's are almost $400 I had to leave ASUS and go to MSI. I haven't looked back. RIP big profit. Big businesses do not know how to be customer friendly once they hit the big leagues. It becomes money over ppl. I see it in almost all big companies now a days. I'm with you Jay. This is why I've been a follower of you guys for 10 years or more.
I have a phantom issue with my ASUS motherboard. At any moment, my memory will stop being recognized on my X570 motherboard. Hasn't happened for awhile, but I know any day now, one of my memory slots will go and my system won't boot until tear apart the PC. Still haven't been able to figure out what the issue really is, but I'm not the only that has seen this before. As far  as I know, ASUS has not addressesed the issue.
This really sucks.  My last two builds, going back 7-8 years used ASUS boards.  I'm considering building a new system next year.  I guess I gotta find a new brand.
Damn, thx for the heads up. I'm about to build a new PC and I admit I bought into the ASUS ROG Kool-Aid, I even just bought what I thought would be a nice ROG mouse (which is sort of shit tbh).  But wow, ok, no more ASUS stuff. But what now?
Didnt have any issue yet with anything from asus or rog IF I DO GET AN ISSUE THO then ill stop buying their products
Everyone's going to avoid this board like a plague
I don't think you said "stuff."
My tolerance for shoddy craftsmanship and support is very low.  The first computer I purchased myself was a P75 and I stopped building computers sometime in the late 1990s.  My time is worth more to me than the cost of the computer. While I don’t have time for gaming anymore, I understand the attraction.  I would rather spend double for a rock steady machine than play with drivers and instability issues and reading forums and Google searches.  I don’t use Windows at home, I bought a MBP. I don’t have time to keep trying Linux distros either, I use CentOS and now Ubuntu at work and I can do what the team needs.  My backups are rsync’d offsite automatically. I can restore from bare metal in a couple of hours if my local backups aren’t available, and within 60 minutes if they are.  One day that madness of chasing driver issues and tweaking Windows will cause you too much stress, and you will say hell no and go find something else that doesn’t give you so much pain.
This makes me sad as they been the company i've used with every build but my most recent one with a 7700x, an asus 670 E mobo and a 7900 xtx. I been baffled for months trying to figure out why the pc randomly shuts off on occasion and when I turn it on it won't post to the display. I have to hold down power button to force another restart for it to boot up normally. i've read countless informaiton and guides online and there just simply isn't any logs in event viewer to explain what's happening. i don't know if it's Asus or what but i been patiently waiting for more bios updates, updates to AMD drivers, and windows updates hoping something will fix it but Asus hasn't done a bios update since like Nov 2022 and it's a new mobo and new CPU, how is there no updates yet to fix bugs? my best guess at tthis point is it's an issue with some security feature of win 11 and hardware somewhere where it fails to authenticate based on logs then bam PC shuts down. I tried disabling everything I can think of on PC and in bios that may be causing PC to shut down. thee just a bunch of fails to authenticate then a scheduled shutdown by protection services or something. I've tried all 3 methods to stopping the service from shutting down with no luck. it's infuriating because sometimes it only happens once a week or in 2 weeks, sometimes multiple times in a day, which makes it near impossible to trouble shoot. anytime I try anything I have to wait a week or two until it happens again to know it didn't work. I honestly think it's because windows unable to verify something with hardware and shuts PC down for security reasons. It also only happens when it's idle, it never happens when i'm using it, I may walk away from my desk 10 minutes to heat up some food, come back and boom it's off again. I've disabled all power saving options like sleep, hybernate, turning display off, hard drives off, everything. It still shuts down when idle but only once every week or two. It makes 0 sense. Other issue I have is AMD 7900 xtx not working at all with freesync and no fix yet, I think it's a known issue with drivers though and my monitor is compatible,, it'll work actually it just causes games to freeze up when loading area's for 10 seconds often causing game to crash, but if it survives those 10 seconds, it's fine, it makes no sense. Other people online said they fixed it by lowering refresh rate but then if you lower that all the way to 60 then what's point in using feesync then when my PC can push FPS to 160 normally, it's stupid.
should be FiveCents now, inflation.......
I was trouble shooting a weird issue I had with my 4790k on a hero 7 board. My buddy laughed and asked if I had heard about asus boards blowing up cpu's, cause my errors were all "application x attempted over volt operation terminated." It was actually an issue in with windows, but I find it kind of funny.
This is so sad; as a long time consumer I feel rugged. This permanently tarnishes the brand. Looking for recommendations for the next build. Ffs
Between this and gamers nexus i guess im out for my next board with asus....last time before that it was msi...is that a good alternative to go back to? In order that was Msi k8n neo 4 platinum sli Asus p8p67 deluxe Asus z170 deluxe Asus z390 code (For my gamer rigs) And a smattering of smaller ones for family and htpc.....over now. Planning on another within a year or so, if anyone has a brand to recommend im open to suggestions, and thank you  Edit Msi Gigabyte Asrock Seems to be the wisdom from newegg, in that order.....  Would likely pair with a gpu of the same brand...as evga is out now as well.
The main question is this, isn't Asrock owned by the Asus, and they treat it as a second-class economy product, and they employed lower-tier engineers. If we know that Gigabyte products were out to the waist drain, now the Asus can go in the same hole, we have just Asrock and MSI. I still can't trust MSI because of the early day's craziness with the quality. EVGA is out of the game. We are cooked and finished.
13:49 to 13:51 needs to be a meme lol
Assholes like Asus and Newegg didnt fully underd understand that the consumer now has capable people (such as yourself and Gamersnexus) looking after the consumer.  And they are about to find out the hard way.   And i love it when arrogant and condescending people and companies get hit in the mouth 👏🏼
The problems with the products declining is one thing, but how disrespectful is that of them? I know sponsorships are a 2-way street but to send your sponsee who has almost 4 million YouTube subscribers and promotes your brand an RMA'd product? This isn't about Jay being "don't you know who I am"? Jay seems pretty down to earth. It's about respect. It's like they said "Just send 'em one from the junkpile." And the warning on the BIOS download? Fn shaaaaady. Seems like a lot of bad greedy business decisions that's coming around to haunt them.
The point is having some troubles with your partner ASUS you were keeping silence about it all the time before Gamers Nexus ashamed ASUS. And it looks like you are trying to get some points now. AsRock also belongs to ASUS. I had few ASUS motherboard for more than 10 years and all the time their software is at the edge of usability with bugs and abscent declared functions. MSI aslo doesn't care about their software and their suppord is garbage. The point is companies doesn't have competition and doesn't care about reputation. We choose only from few manufacturers.
Their routers are fucking garbage too
Asus has been a sheisty company for a long long time. I stopped buying their products back in 2006 due to warranty issues. Never again. As for Asrock. I like where that company is going. Their products have been solid, SOLID since 2012'ish Z87 era. Still have 3 Asrock mobo's in use.
Yep. Done with asus as well.
Jay only Asrock sponsor you its ok everyone knows.  Haha dont gwt butt hurt boy
The cursing is a turn off. Heck is better than saying h**l.
Was about to buy it again for upgrade, im glad I avoided this brand.
That's a bios for rich people. If you can't treat it as disposable, then don't try it. I get the reasoning. I don't like it much but I get it. Free debugging and diagnosis.
Sad to hear, I still use my really old Asus G74S for work every in 3D design 10y ago they send me a free HD when mine broke after the 3y garanty end... I just bought a new one last week I hope...
Where is the BBB? Weights and Measures? I have had similar problems with both Newegg and Powercolor...
I hope Asus sees this. If they do:  I hope you cease to exist... and looks like you will 😅 bye. .. i will be there to  teabag your grave
Holy sheesh dude you need to come back down to Earth! Get over yourself.
oh no😮
that is dirty of ASUS...im using a gigabyte mb and no problems..
One of the worst computers I ever had was a 486DX66 with an Asus board back in the 1990's. I replaced it with an even lesser known brand with a Cyrix chip and even though that one sucked, it was still better than the Asus board and I refused to use any Asus product for 15 years. Then they went and got good, but it looks like they might be going back to their roots.
I've always built my pc with Asus boards,  But in November last year I spent £750 on that x670e extreme for the 7950x and all I can say is that day 1 experience of have am5 was terrible,   Imagine having putting 128gb of amd expo ram inside and the first boot eith nothing on screen for 57 minutes, When it did show up I installed Windows 11 and when that  restarted for the first time well it was another long wait for it to post 1 hour and 17 minutes,   Then got the latest bios that took 18 minutes to install, Then to boot into windows that took another 43 minutes,   Even 6 months from launch it's still got issues such as after a windows 11 update it's a 10 minutes wait to get it to post 1st time after that update is installed,   The major problem with AM5 is you never get full speed of your ram if you use 128gb,  Had to lower the speed manually  to 4800 from 5600,   Otherwise you get a lovely blue screen of death,  I've had nothing but problems with the most expensive motherboard I've ever paid for in my life and it still hadn't improved because now the latest bios update can now kill your motherboard and Asus are saying the warranty is void,   Excuse me for saying but you make the board and you made the new bios update surely you have done some type of QA before making it public,  What a mess,   I know next time I will go MSi for my  motherboard,  If you can't trust a red dragon who can you trust?,   I certainly do not trust any republic of gamers anymore,
I've had nothing but blue screen/crash issues with my X670E Hero since I got it last september.  The only way to make it stable is to go into bios and put memory into DOCP.  It will be stable so long as I leave the computer on 24/7.  If I have to restart because of an update It will restart into blue screen, crash, etc.  I have to go into bios, change from docp to some other random memory config, start it up, let it crash, then back into docp and it's stable again.
7:00 damn Jay got Newegg'd by Asus with that RMA
What the heck. I love my Asus rog products.
other than a monitor or two i stas away fro asus already. f*** em
Since they wanted to handle thus the way they handled it i guess the x570 formula will be my last ASUS board. After zen 2 launched theyve had people doing questionable things with bios, and this takes the cake. They should have known no one with a brain would set over 1.2v vsoc..
Asus now is only For Those Who Dare
Wow, damn.  First I've heard of this...but, glad to know.
It reminds me how I was excited to buy the Asus gundam monitor only to but fed up with it after 5 months of use because the right side of the backlight will randomly turn off. They only fix is to turn it off and on again and it might go off a few seconds later. I don't get how a $500-600 monitor has this issue when a $100 one I had for years is still working with no issues. And I looked up the issue to find out it's a common issue with that monitor.
Yori Boyka Was Right: Fu***** Americans Always Talk Too Much 👀
Asus pulling a cable company from South Park,  saying "We're sorrrrrrry..." while vigorously fondling their nips
Proud of you Jay!  We cant tolerate a shady company that allows products to catch fire --- EVER. Thank you!  I hope that EVGA steps into the space and makes EVGA great again (no pun intended, but EVGA always kicked ass!)
Ps THANK you for information on Asus .i will stay a way form them to
I went MSI for my Ryzen7 and have been happy thus far. I jumped ship on Asus about 10 years ago after a bad experience. Gigabyte and MSI have been my go to.
Their customer service sucks ass!  Th8s will be the last mboard I ever buy from them!
"Fortunately I ended up with an MSI board so I'm free and clear of all this" Uh oh, somebody should let Jay know MSI got hacked and their driver signing keys are now in the wild and they have no revocation mechanism. Anyone can now make legitimate MSI drivers.
Same goes to MSI😂😂😂
Wow
Sigh, I have an ASUS board, and you're really making me think that some of the weirdness I've had with my machine, is probably because of the board. Time to think about a new one.
I just bought a brand new strix 4090 OC, what should i do? i thought i was buying a premium product and this thing was ungodly expensive. I dont wanna support a company like this but if their GPUs are reliable i will keep it. I know i will most likely be screwed if i have any issues with the card but i just want some insight into what you guys would do. I went with MSI for my motherboard thank god just praying that the strix is still a good card. I should have gotten the suprim X and saved myself alot of money but again i always believed the strix was king for GPUs
Tough life getting sent free stuff as requested and it not being brand new.
Thumb down for your video
Did NewEggs executives move to ASUS???
The MOST FAILED motherboards I have ever had were ASUS
i recently RMA'ed my 3080TI from Asus, i packaged it up nicely back into its original box with everything. they sent back a white generic box exactly like your motherboard box. like seriously couldnt have sent it in my original box or even another original box?
Pretty sure he didn't say, "keep your 'stuff'" at 1:14
I used to love Asus and they where my first pick for everything for quite a few years of PC builds but I dumped them awhile ago when their prices started to get stupid when compaired to other manufactures. On my current rig I was looking at Asus and their motherboard prices where like 50% more than the compitition and I just couldn't justify it when an MSI board with all the same features was massively cheaper and was making the diffrence on a better graphics card. Now they are doing this crap, my advice is don't fanboy for any company they are not and never will be your friend, you are their piggy bank and thats all they will ever see you as.
WHY DO YOU KEEP PIGGYBACKING/COPYING STEVES CONTENT

*Cough* *_BOYCOT ASUS_*
Damn it's a good thing I watched this video when I did. I had a new Asus board sitting in my Newegg cart and now I'm definitely not getting that.
i thing thats is double cross people who buy produit of pc for lot money , 10 years i not buying Asus , Asus you suck .🖕🖕👎. ...R(+)cKeT
I have had 2 rog laptops in the last 3 years, both developed problems just after 12 months. My next computer, if its a laptop, will be a framework
As far as motherboards are concerned I only use EVGA or MSI.  Reason being is I have a much easier time updating the bios than compared to ASUS or GIGABYTE.
Such a shame. Asus used to be my go to brand because of their after sale service. 😢
I want to get this straight.  The entire narrative that AMD's X3D's were burning up, is because one popular motherboard brand was significantly overvolting the chip by default?  X3D's were never burning up, Asus's motherboards were overvolting them and burning them up.
I chose to wait for a new build for this exact reason.  And now that I'm starting to plan a build, I can safely say that my plans will have to change - no ASUS products.  Thank you, Jay!
I have seen this behaviour with alot of companies, especially in electronics where it is hard for a lay person to see the difference between quality and garbage.  Take for example my car audio amplifier, when i was a teenager, the best quality brand was soundstream. They grew a reputaion for have great amps, 10 years later they used that reputation to sell a bunch of overpriced garbage because people trusted the brand.  LG is doin the same thing nowadays too - used to make great TV's, now they sell mid or garbage tier electronics that look shiny but bfunction like crap. Really sad that ASUS is selling out their reputation too. Have been a customer of theirs going back to my first build, what a shame.
I purchased a ROG MB using AM4 and it stopped allowing BIOS updates after 6 months. ROG refused any return or refund. Unable to upgrade my 2600x chip. I will never purchase anything from them again. Well done on highlighting this.
Maybe we should smack ASUS into the 7th wall.   They used to be king, but now they are pauper garbage
Sounds like a class action lawsuit.
who would want a $600 MB when a $200 one can do the job better...
I "fired" ASUS too earlier this year. Crap motherboard, disheartening and cheeky assistance, and literally zero support towards solving my issues. So I sent the motherboard back, got my money, got another brand. 3 months later, I have a functional PC - not with ASUS.  I have no clue what the hell happened to them these last few years, I've had crap support last year as well when I contacted them about a different product, but at least it wasn't mine and it wasn't brand new. This time it was the latest gen stuff, and not only false advertising (RAM compatibility marketed with some speeds that weren't even in their RAM QVL), but also multiple issues and zero support. They closed both my tickets, for false reasons ("garbled characters"), without helping at all. I hope they go bankrupt before they treat other customers like this. They don't deserve the money.
As someone who has sworn by ASUS for the past ~10 years or so, and whose first (and still current) built PC is mostly ASUS, this is really disappointing to hear.
My G14 up and died for no reason a year after I bought it.  I barely ever even used it, as it was a secondary computer and now it is toast.  Waste of $
This is a huge D energy. Cheers and keep up the good work !
Asus is singular. "They" is plural. Learn grammar.
Asus, NVidia, MSoft, Apple, Samsung, they all suck and don't give a shit about their Customer base.
which motherboards are screwy?
Bought an ROG Z13 laptop earlier this year and exactly 2 weeks after purchase, something inside blows up and the device blacks out permanently. It's now at Asus's Canada service centre and been waiting for over a month to have it fixed and shipped to me. I hope that the laptop works for years after I get it back because if it breaks 2 weeks after getting it back then I'm out of warranty
It's AMD and ASUS, specifically AMD. That said Asus Software is horrendous & they've had hardware issues too but amd is nothing but issues
Great job sir sticking up for the little guy! 👍 Well ASUS is now officially off my upgrade lists as well, I was getting ready to drop $1K on the MB itself.  Oh well back to the drawing board.  👎😝🤐
Bought my last ASUS motherboard after many years with the X590, still using it since I paid $450, but it boots one time in three without needing reset to even post. Still not as bad as what happened here, but I was already done.
ngl if I had money/ could replace my ASUS crosshair impact motherboard I would but can't :P (ironically is a ITX motherboard inside of a full tower so I got free range on what I can choose) On the other note I am freaking stoke to see this Megaman X build whenever that is coming.
i have a 670 extreme sitting as a paperweight and cant get help from asus to fix. f them. bought  an acer meg and it works
Don't mistake China and Taiwan
Great video and as a long term Asus user, i'm sadden by the current situation.  So for a 7950X3D what MOBO would you recommend ?
I had a DOA formula 12 when I did my last build. It took weeks of emails just to get them to replace it. From maintaining "it must be memory" to "it must be the power supply" to even trying to claim I didn't hit the power button... Or my favorite "send us a picture of the socket so we can make sure you've not damaged it"... At that point I stopped supporting Asus. Not to mention the issues I've had recently to return my ultrawide monitor due to screen issues... Initially they wanted me to send it myself to Europe from the UK at my cost in a box "wrapped in bubble wrap" with a whole load of warnings that any damage on transit would void the replacement. Did eventually get it replaced, but that was two months of fighting to get them to pick it up.
I can sort of understand the void warranty if you use a beta bios update because if the person messes it up but really maybe do a kind of recall on all motherboards no charges  update the bios themselves and then send them back to the customer ,it would be  a huge hassle to do that but then there shouldn't be any excuses personally  i would just send it back for refund get a different motherboard from not asus
As some who had a the Crosshair V Formula-Z with the fx8350 back in the day and having that board still work with zero issues, seeing how far ASUS has fallen is truly upsetting.  edit: Keep calling this s*** out man, if even a few other channels your size decide the same, ASUS will be forced to care. Respect. Been a fan since you had your own 8350 :D
I was wondeering why I get game crashesh and blue screens on top spec PC and my friends with similar builds wont.   Bruh. I been so loyal to asus and now this fk me srsly. I now see the bigger picture. All pretty and stuff but man, this is shait.
This is what happen when a company from Japan sold to China. Currently ASUS handle by China's factory and quality control so no surprise they have this issue.
I am about to do a new build to replace a ASUS ROG intel 270 chipset with a 7700k cpu. That build has been solid but times have really changed. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Thanks to your video I WILL NOT be buying another Maximus board.  I will give MSI or ASROCK a look. Thanks again Jay.
4 years ago i bought a 4000$ laptop from asus, even went the extra mile and bought 200$ extended warrenty, that was the biggest purchase of my life back in this time, the laptop was flawd from the beggining, I had to RMA this newly baught laptop for 4 times because asus refused to acknowledge the issues for over a year. They broke the case of the laptop in 2 different places and refused to admit that it was happened under their responsibility even though I had photos of the laptop from the pickup day sent to them, I have this laptop sitting like brick in my room to remind myself never get close to this company again. The biggest mistake of my life.
I've always hated ASUS for their shit and putting up with the brainwashed nerds and hated your channel for pushing their crap over priced products, funny you've just seen the light
Asus gone with glory days,i stop using them when they "rog"tag came out,over fking price quality drop create utter rubbish nonsense extra parts on motherboard.
I'm glad to see people with a platform finally catching on. A customer brought an ASUS notebook into my shop for help with upgrading to Windows 10. (Yes, it's been a while.) The machine had some stability issues and lost a couple of features, so needed an updated driver or two, but none were to be found on their site's support page for the model, so I contacted support. Their official response was, "We don't support upgrading the OS on our notebooks." The notebook was sold with Windows 7 about 3 months prior to the public release of Windows 10, so there was absolutely no excuse whatsoever for their response. That was enough for me. Incidentally, in the ten years my shop has been open, I've built many, many, MANY computers with ASRock motherboards, and every single one has been rock solid stable. They absolutely live up to their name.  The majority of my customers just want a basic home computer and won't be requesting bleeding edge hardware, but it goes a long way with me that ASRock takes just as much consideration for the lower-end price point consumers as they take for their top-end price point consumers.
Speaking of Asrock, I silently watch their brand went to avoid at all cost to top 3 on my list. Their RMA is top notch as I have motherboard returned after almost 2 year of use. They replaced the motherboard no question asked.
Well said Jayz2C. I use to rock 2 ROG gaming laptop bought 2 to 3 years ago. Quality is bad from the get go. Screw that broke the brass holder insert in the plastic mold of casing, misfiring usb port, hit and miss microphone and fuzzy touchpad............ the list goes on  When its time to upgrade recently (out of warranty Asus laptops) I went MSI because of terrible Asus experience and quality of products.
Now you tell me, I just bought a TUF 4080....😢
Oh...I didn't realise Asus was like this.  Good to know! Asus is out.
Smart. Hopefully this gives ppl like us a chance to review for Asus. I have no issues with my Asus monitor nor do I have any issues with my Asus Tuf Mobo ....sent it my way Asus 🖥️💻
I have a ROG Strix z690-E Motherboard with a intel 12900k it has been crashing like crazy lately. Late last year it was fine.  It’s super odd.
Ive ordered b660 tuf gaming plus when it came out...hella lot unstable, it worked for 3 months after tweaking, i also had to do the mod to the cpu holder bc my first i5 12400f got so bent in the socket that it died...after i got new mobo/cpu i modded the new one before puttin cpu inside...tweaked very hard to make it stable at RATED speeds...both mem/cpu...after 3 months there was a kind of short somewhere on the mobo in the middle of the game...the pc rebooted, didnt die completely unLuckily....but it was completely unstable under load after that...when i sent the mobo for refund they rejected me stating that lga pins were bent...they werent bent at all...when i was returning the mobo i found out one of the lga pins was really dark...i guess it was aftermath of the short that happened...still completely working, although not stable...also i have tuf fx505gt notebook and like 2 weeks ago i was playin game and in middle of nowhere the fps dropped from 55-60 to 10...after seeking for what could it be i got into a conclusion that some cpu thermal sensor died...repasted, got bigger ntb cooler w 5 freakin fans, repasted, dustcleaned everything...still no luck...asus used to be gr8...USED to be
I feel so cheated. I rma'd a board, and came with damaged pins. I immediately sent the board back within the week. They claim they "checked the cameras" and that it was user induced damage. I escalated the complaint but they were quite adamant that i was user induced damage, so now 2 months later, and I still don't have a board. I just paid for the repair, so maybe they can send me back a functional board I just sell and get rid of.  This is honestly the last time I ever buy an Asus product.
Thanks soo much for tackling this issue! For 3 years I tried to get ASUS to get me their proprietary “node cable” for my 500+ euro ASUS motherboard. Instead I got lies, false promises and extreme arrogance. Frustrated, I decided to send my perfectly working mobo back to ASUS, assuming the warranty would get me the cable. Big mistake. Instead ASUS, informed me that my mobo was D.O.A. They could repair it, but the costs would not be covered by the warranty. Surprised my mobo was even broken, I asked if they properly tested it. Not necessary according to ASUS. Just eying it was enough to see the extensive damage. Wanting to avoid another ASUS scam, I declined the repair and asked ASUS to return it. It did, in a plastic bag, using no protective packaging at all. When I got it back it was dented and had scratches all over. Then I actually did test it to see how bad the damage was, only to discover there wasn’t any. The mobo had no technical issues whatsoever.
Your words
So you’re anyone’s bitch for money ok 👍
What a cry baby
thank god i bought a am4 board with a 5900x cpu recently as it works and it fast enough for the next 4 years on games
F**k   ASUS
Shit, and I just bougth the asus tuf 2022
I gotta say, Jay, that I stand with you. I have had software problems with my TG H670 Pro wifi D4. I ran the fan auto-tuner in Asus Armoury Crate (AAC) because I wanted to get the best curves. It nerfed my Noctua iPPC-3000 down to a stupidly low level, resulting in my system being hotter (during winter with my thermostat at 60 F). Then, when I tried to manually alter the curves using AAC, the tuner would NOT allow them to be changed, and would not allow BIOS to over-ride it, either.  Then, I uninstalled AAC BUT THE APP CONTROLLING THE FANS WAS NOT UNINSTALLED. I had to use Task Manager to stop it, then I had to go into the startup folder to disable it, restarted and my fans were back under MY control.  TBF, on the LTT forums, I've recently seen some similar complaints with other brands' software dominating fans and AIOs.  The customer service experience that I had with them ranged from good to horrible, but mostly closer to horrible. If you use live-chat, the agents are forced to handle several customers at a time and the one I dealt with wasn't taking notes and wasn't paying attention to the chat history, so I finally gave up. The phone agents try to get you off the line as quickly as possible so that they can email you with instructions. Basically, almost every request for help or information has resulted in them sending a form that doesn't show why they're contacting me ANYWHERE, and asks me to fill out a form and send it back, even though I had ALREADY verbally or in chat told them the problem in great detail. Worse yet, if I DID actually bother to fill out the form, and I happened to have multiple trouble tickets, they'd reuse the ticket number and NOT specify which problem they were responding to, WHILE ALSO RESPONDING TO CLOSED PROBLEMS. One problem, which involved the above chat/phone/form fiasco, was in regards to why I couldn't get the H670 to recognize my SSD, which prevented me from installing Windows. It turned that, because I had Intel Rapid Storage Technology turned on, it was removed from consideration for OS installation and could ONLY be used for RAID. I tried multiple things to try to fix it, contacted the SSD manufacturer (TeamGroup, who also failed miserably to provide adequate support before passing me to Asus), and then dealt with this nonsense. THE AGENT SENT ME BAD, INCOMPLETE AND CONFUSING TROUBLESHOOTING INSTRUCTIONS, some of the steps were things I'd already told him I'd tried, and others were stupid or incomprehensible, and never identified the problem. I figured it out the SAME DAY, told them I'd resolved the issue and expressed my displeasure with their poor service (video and email). They kept emailing me about it and other things that had been resolved, although I wasn't always sure what they were writing about because they didn't indicate which topic while lumping them together on one trouble ticket despite being opened separately.  And, hey, best of all I continued to get emails about the SSD issue for the next 2 months.  In my opinion, Asus is as you say - arrogant and they've sunk pretty low. Thank you for sharing your experience with everyone!
just bought ASUS wifi router day before yesterday. now I'm nervous....
Once I start my new job and get some cash banked, I’m replacing my case and motherboard. The case is because I need a bigger one, but the motherboard is ASUS. While my power supply is also ASUS ROG, I don’t plan on replacing it. Got it for a good price and it’s 1000w.
Share price has collapsed GOOD
Boycott Asus now, These companies have been taking consumers to much granted
finally got my first 1440p monitor this year from asus and its got an unfixable stuck pixel lol
see my ryzen 9 5900x and rx 6800 build with ASUS TUF gaming x570 has had literally zero problems other than my 5900x reaching 90 degrees which i fixed by putting it into ryzen master ECO mode which deactivated 12 threads which i went back and reactivated them with Ryzen master ECO mode 24 threads. now it hits 79 degrees during intensive gaming sessions and I'm good. other than that no issues. Makes me feel better about not being able to upgrade to the 7900x and 7900xt
I got a Crosshair 8 Dark Hero X570 that I haven't opened yet. Now I'm worried as f...
This is how capitalism works, why the surprise?
I think Asus is going the dark path of the sith. It used to be a great Jedi Knight.
Does this mean the boards are about to get really cheap?
I think there needs to be a video discussing which brands are actually worth buying from
Wow, I use an asus laptop and it's terrible now. Moving from asus and gonna build my own pc with an msi motherboard seems the way to go now.
Well asus is a good company but we all found they're weakness the cant make motherboards
Knee jerk reactions are 20/20, but where does it stop, MSI should be out also for their issues, and you can only buy so many PNY products.
Was trying to decide between the the Razer 16 and the ROG G-14. After watching this Im glad I didnt wait for the 14's release. My Razer 16 is awesome.
I said this already years ago asus is scammimg.people and overpriced af. But ye all these sponsored youtubers help them out
I only fuck with Asrock now... its a shame too because Asus creates beautiful boards.
Thank you Jay. As someone who has been screwed over by ASUS two times in less than a year after trusting them while I built my very expensive bleeding edge PC.
Yep, Asus told me to kick rocks when a fan on a GPU failed on me. Wouldnt even give me info as to where I could get another one. They just told me to either give them 650 to fix it ( it was only a 900 to 1000 GPU).   Meanwhile I had the smallest of issues with my MSI laptop and they happy took it back and swapped a part out.
Just swapped my Asus Motherboard for an MSI one after I kept getting random "USB overcurrent Status" faults on start-up (with no devices plugged in!?), lost all confidence in ASUS currently.   So far so good, with the MSI Tomahawk.
Goodluck with msi . Got here 2 motherboards with strange stuff 3 graphicscard.
I blocked your Account, why tf are your videos still in my feed?
Oh man, i was ASUS fan boy
If these events continue, it would mean they may see their sales decreasing heavily. The only reasons I have seen people buy Asus even with their ridiculous prices are: Primarily because of their high quality, and secondly because of the look of some of their products.  If they don't back those high prices... then why would anyone buy from them? They can just go to another brand with more "reasonable" prices.
Who are these people in charge of the Asus company? Asus software has always been utter garbage, but the hardware was solid, I've always had Asus mobo and GPU, but this is not okay and Asus need to attone for what they've done and the way they handle the "problem"..
asus is too overpriced. unless you're doing sli or you'll need more than one or two expansion slots, why even go ATX? ive gona micro atx for 2 generations now and havent looked back. i always buy the cheapest gigabyte micro atx mb. i have a 4790k with a small fractal design case that my gf uses now and I'm using the r5 2600x with a coolermaster micro q300 case. Both cheapest gigabyte micro atx mb i could find when building. both running great for many moons. giant cases with 50 LED fans is obnoxious. ive got two black box computers with tinted side glass and each has like 1 subtle light and 1 system fan. able to run 4k titles no problem. the fractal pop mini silent micro atx case looks amazing, thats what id go for now if i was building, with a gigabyte b650m, r7 x3d
Mindfactory one, if not THE biggest Vendor for Hardware in Germany, already removed all Asus products in 2020, because of problems with Asus products.
I am no longer buying an asus motherboard until they take responsibility for their mistakes.
May 14, 2023 - The HDMI out on my ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-A Gaming WiFi motherboard stopped working after having the board for about five months. I only bought the ASUS board because I was waiting to see if EVGA would honor the RMA on my returned Z690 motherboard. The ASUS board was available on Amazon for a reasonable price, and i thought I would "upgrade" while waiting to see if EVGA would send me a replacement Z690 motherboard. The ASUS motherboard has worked for about five months, but the "HDMI out" on the board TOTALLY stopped working for both my PC monitor and my TV, when I downloaded a Microsoft Windows 11 "upgrade". I thought there could be a driver problem and downloaded ASUS drivers for the motherboard hoping that would correct the problem. I didn't download ASUS Bios drivers because I was concerned about the necessity of "renaming" Bios files. One issue I notice when building my PC, was that the ASUS board required that I install a support rack for the EVGA RTX3080 Ti GPU. I didn't have to install a support rack for the GPU when I installed it on my EVGA Z299 Dark motherboard. Thanks to Jayz in this video, I will know if the ASUS board starts to fail, and only hope that it doesn't damage other components in my PC if it does. Back to EVGA for me, and I am soooo sorry that they decided to stop selling Nvidia GPUs.
Thankyou for info i used to use asus years ago and was looking toward them with my next purchase. Thankyou for alerting me to this as i will stay well away.
I love it! F em
Got the zenfone 9 a few months back, and to make a long story short, my experience with asus was god-awful and I just ended up returning the thing. One of their reps unironically gave me the "we're a small company pls understand"
I'm on the MSI x670e x EK monoblock combo, everything is absolutely perfect.
That's me done with ASUS. Cheers, Jay. 👍
This is EXACTLY why I follow channels like these. To know when a particular brand gets too big for its own britches and thinks it can treat us like the deep state does. No thank you. Makes me sad as ASUS was my go to brand. I'm getting ready to build my first machine in a long time (I have built them for other customers but this one will be for me). Thank you Jay for this. So if I wanted to go with a new Z rated motherboard and GPU which brand does everyone like now? MSI? GIGABYTE? I'm still going with intel as well.
My z390 has been faulty with my i9 9900k , first it started making all my external audio gear stop working. Luckily i figured out the problem, did a bios update. Then i tried the ai overclock, and it did a weird 5.1 GHz overclock, with way off voltage that crashed my pc within seconds of booting. Asus has been a brand i have almost always recommended to people who build PCs. Those days are over. Especially with the silence around their problems. Most people would not even figure out my last problems. It was just luck for me that i did to be honest. I found the .exe making the issues. Then found 2 discussions about it on some forums. Thanks for telling people about their lack of costumers care. Some of us have been loyal to you for years,and this is how you treat us. Way to shoot yourself in the foot Asus..
My friend sent me this to explain why his CPU is utterly fried.
I used to have really good luck with ASUS like five generations back and now I have a b550 and it just fucking died after a year I'm going to go with MSI from now on I've never ever once had a problem with MSI
Covid is finally hitting companies. Seems like asus is about to go bankrupt. Its going to be hillarious as per that korean asus v apple skit
Another example of a company building up a great reputation, then selling out on their good name. *cough* Bethesda *cough* Every company that does this to their loyal fans after supporting them for years, deserves to be dropped like a bad habit! Thanks Jay for letting us know what's going on, information is power!!
😊same thing with motherboard driver for window 10 they not even install even if you try to installing them they suck to be homest now when come to there support and this was dark hero 570x all the drive on websites are just bad or they wont intall
ASUS going the way of Boeing.
Fire all you want, they are just the best out there.
Hey! I have the same issue with CPU socket on my brand new Asus ROG Strix Z790-H GAMING WIFI MOBO. Pins are bent, sctratches, foreign objects in socket.... The product warranty has not been accepted because it does not cover mechanical damage.
What about the gigabyte board any opinion about them?
Brutal...
Totally agree. Asus fan for years and I am done.  Switched from Asus to a Gigabyte board on my last build and I could not be more pleased with the results.  The sad part for me is that I love Asus routers.  Currently running their top of the line model and I love it.  But I don't run their firmware. Anyway, you mentioned the white box RMA board "came from China with China Post" labels but later you said it was "from Taiwan" and that may be the case. But Taiwai is not China. Taiwan is a free, independent country and not a communist republic.   It is not proper to equate one with the other and this detail cannot be casually forgotten.
ASUS, the business with one star on the Better Business Bureau.  Haven't given them my money in nearly a decade.  I got screamed at by a customer service rep for assuming that the returns and RMA departments were in contact regarding my RMA.  Got my monitor sent back unrepaired, because despite being given an RMA # after repeatedly telling the return rep that the product was out of warranty, the RMA dept saw it was out of warranty and refused to even open it.  Somehow it was my fault my monitor was being sent back to me without service because I was supposed to know those departments didn't interact, and that my RMA wasn't valid because it was out of warranty, despite *REPEATEDLY* telling the returns rep that was the case.  The manager yelling at me said I should have asked my returns rep for the RMA dept's email, it was pretty wild. Spent $45 mailing them a $200 monitor to get repaired only to have it sent back with virtually zero communication before they shipped it off, they had mailed me a return tracking number, I had to call to find out what was going on.  They eventually offered to pickup and ship the monitor back for free, I only needed to pay $99 for repairs.  So nearly $150 later, I could have had them replace the single 35 cent capacitor that had gone bad on a $200 monitor; Ended up spending ~$6 replacing all the caps to get it running again.    ASUS will never get another penny from me.
After I started building PCs in 2003, I learned a lot about what products I wanted to buy. I have stuck with most of those since, and have basically been problem free, despite watching others use different brands with many issues. ASUS is one of those, and I have used their motherboards since 2004, their 2000 series graphics card, and two monitors. Great experience thus far, so it is disappointing to hear that they may be declining in quality, especially from trusted reviewers. Always been happy to pay the minor "ASUS tax", and "Corsair Tax," etc.
I had TWO 2080ti ASUS fails and a motherboard in the pass 4 years. If you have to get A replacement with the warranty, you get a refurbished item with a bad Customize box with bad paddings around it. They keep your box for some stupid reason so I don't know what ASUS does with it. I'll never buy ASUS stuff again.
Do you know Asus have a line of Asus Mesh routers that come in 2-pack, 3-pack or 5-pack mesh system, that have advertised even on the box that it supports WPA2 Enterprise, but they actually only support that when they are used individually as a single independent router, not when in any type of mesh (wifi or ethernet backbone), extender or bridge ? That makes it completely useless if you want that  feature that is advertised on the box.
I have a ROG STRIX X670E-E GAMING WIFI and it shit itself last week. I had no idea about the drama. I was running an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, and had not used the beta bios. Starting having a multitude of issues including Q codes that were not listed in the manual. Called Asus about it, they gave me an RMA but failed to inform me about this issue even though they asked what my components were. I got a replacement board back from them yesterday and hooked it up. D7 and D6 errors, so no posting or even keyboard connection. Now I’m wondering if it had actually cooked my processor, too.  I’m really pissed now. I’m out over 2 weeks of work and 1000 worth of equipment and they didn’t even inform me of the issue they were having after I called them…
Remember there is always an alternative to asus... Dont but their crap overpriced hardware 😒
I had strangly very simlar problems with my B650E AORUS MASTER (gigabyte) first time i got it the sound chip just give up after 3 days of put the system together (never got it working again) and channel A1 and A2 never worked so dead right after building it. Strange shutdown where only the screen went black and the system refuse to even shut down (power buttons and controll are compley gone) so you have to cut the power to restart the system.  After i dismantel the board again to RMA it i notices that the pins there bend on 3 point (not same location) but only if you look at the right angle.   So not only Asus can do that Gigabyte as well. So i got 4 days ago a replacement and no of this issue show up again (even the same software is in use since i just put the same m2 in the system)
1:13 Was this "stuff" a monetizing censor? Sure sounds like you're saying "shit" or smth
I’ve always purchased Asus products foolishly thinking it was a quality product ! To be fair I’ve never had an issue but I’ll have to look elsewhere if this is the way they are going .
Hopefully this hurts them enough to wake up, they have since removed the warranty disclaimer from the beta BIOS and said they are working on an actual fix
i have a asus 3090 ti LC in my rig and its NOT better then my EVGA 3090 LC. this one is Noisy and has coil wine i i wouldent have brought it with a 21 foot pole if i didnt have extended microcenter warranty. i had the same strix LC for 6900xt and that card would shit the bed every time i played mafia definitive edition.
The warranty issue just made Asus dig their own grave. So stupid it is insulting our very existence as pc enthusiasts and as stupid as Vram starvation and the RTX/DLSS Nvidia greed show :D

ASUS is starting to get the message. They seem to have removed the "Warranty void" garbage from the download page for the 1410 beta BIOS download. Thank you for your efforts Jay and Team, and please keep the pressure on.
Why did they decide to name their company Asus?  Because sus was already taken 😜
This is sad to find out as i have used ASUS for almost a decade and have had zero issues. I even gave my mother my old PC when i upgraded and it was a 2016 ASUS MAXIMUS X build with a I7 7700K and a Nvidia GTX Gigabyte 1080 and i can still boot up games like GTAV and run flawlessly at 144Hz as of today when i was there for mothers day. Is this a case of GPU's and CPU's taking huge leaps forward and motherboard developers not able to keep up with progress....
Thanx for the video, ASUS is dead for me
Man, 13 years ago I tried PC gaming for the first time on a ROG laptop. I thought it was so cool with the bios splashscreen being the eagle eye exploding with flames. Right away I got my own, and since then always bought ROG parts. It really sucks that its all gone down hill for ASUS.
$1000 for a motherboard? Aren’t motherboards like $200 max?
Plot Twist: This Video is sponsored by Asus :D
Remember the Asus X99 boards that loved to kill cpus?
I've used Asus mobos in my PC builds for over 15 years, including my current 13700k/Strix 790-E. Never had a single failure. Very troubling to see this now.
nothing wrong with a company having problems... there is a HUGE problem with companies doing a shit poor job fixing said problems so they "hurt" other people by their greed and lack of service
After years of choosing ASUS as a quality brand name (like p5Q Pro, HD 6850, 970 STRIX), My ASUS 2060 DUAL burnt down without reason at the height of COVID/Crypto  crisis. The 6650XT Dual I've chosen as a replacement had horizontal instead of vertical fin array that made It unbereably noisy, for what is probably few $ saving. My own experience and recently mentioned blunders is what made it official: That's the end of It. Their cost savings went too far. No ASUS ever again.
Very sad to see this happening to Asus since they were always my go-to brand when looking for PC parts. They used to cost a premium but used to produce the highest quality goods.
Then its gigabyte or msi ik my next build then.
Poor products due to covid.  They would've made a killing in 2020 to 2022.  Now it's coming back to bite them.  My ROG board has had no problems but can't buy any more of thier products now.
Thanks Jay
I got inverted sound one time.... that was fun
Tbh I have a rog strix b450 -f  gaming II version last night i was watching youtube shorts then my audio kept getting really jaggy and stuttery and then my whole pc became laggy . I had to reinstal my drivers just to fix it and even the drivers werent able to be downloaded so  yea ....
Great, here I am with a new build since last month with many ASUS products:   -Intel Core i7-13700KF processor -ASUS TUF Gaming LC 240 ARGB all-in-one cooler -ASUS TUF Gaming Z790-PLUS WIFI motherboard -32 GB Corsair Vengance 5600 Mhz memory (2x 16 GB, CL36) -ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GPU -ASUS TUF Gaming GT501 case -ASUS TUF 750G psu, 80+ Gold  It survived stress testing, incl prime95 (though with thermal throttling).
Frack, Just ordered (and received)  a Asus ROG STRIX Z690-A GAMING WIFI D4 ATX LGA1700 Motherboard from amazon. I need the machine up and running ASAP, and all of the memory, M.2 SSD and CPU cooler etc. are all matched to the board. All reviews I found up to this were good...🤔
Wow was just about to buy an ASUS board for a build. Glad I saw this video before I pulled the trigger. Going to look for another brand now, thanks Jay!
wow  makes me sad.  just bought all asus items.  blah.  not good not good ASUS.....
ReSubbed after a long break from this channel
Thanks for the video. I have to confess I was a ASUS fanboy, now they are dead to me, because of over priced and bad product. Going forward will be buy parts based on reviews from quality reviewers. Current rig has no ASUS and everything is going great MSI motherboard Gigabyte monitor and video card, went from all ASUS to just the best part for the money. By ASUS we did have good thing going for over 20 years.
That's really brutal - but deserved.
2012 -2013 was the last years that asus made something I was willing to buy for that much money...I havent seen anything from anyone lately that I want to buy
I agree with your sentiments.. I will never buy another ASUS product.. I recently had an issue with the pci slot security tab that’s snapped off.. It was hell to get support from them.. TDLR I ended up buying the part off ebay and fixed it myself. Quality is crappy now
Asus is nice but seems certain time the Quality Control has realy to be improve ,  a got a laptop E410K  a had to replace it by Warranty the Display was defective with some wihte ligt spots .
That beta bios move, supposedly fixing the issue, yet voiding the warranty (in small letters) is utterly sickening and disgusting. Thank you for sharing this.
You figured that now? haha, stopped buying their PC parts long ago. Their support and RMA is awful even for their own mess ups.
Two years ago, I purchased the Asus ROG Maximus XIII Hero motherboard, and it worked perfectly until I decided to replace it with the Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Formula. Unfortunately, while removing the old motherboard, I accidentally bent some pins. I reached out to Asus Support for assistance and requested a CPU socket replacement. I sent the motherboard to them, but they informed me that since the damage was caused by the customer (me), I would have to pay for the socket replacement. Reluctantly, I made the payment, and after a few days, they contacted me to inform me that despite changing the socket, the motherboard was no longer functioning. They mentioned that it had failed during the final examination and shipped it back to me.  I was frustrated because I had explained to them that I hadn't done anything else to the motherboard besides the minor accident. Prior to removing it from my case, it was working perfectly fine. Their response was for me to try it out and see if it would work, and if not, I could discard it.  Since then, I have kept the motherboard aside as I no longer have a suitable processor to test it with. It's possible that it may still be functioning, but I cannot be certain.  I do have a positive opinion of Asus overall, as I currently have the Z790 Hero working flawlessly with my 13900K and Nvidia 4090. However, their customer support leaves much to be desired, and they definitely need to improve their post-purchase services. Otherwise, they risk losing more customers in the future and becoming obsolete.
I bought the 7800x3d & the same motherboard as you. I haven't had time to put it all together. Glad I saw the level of Asus customer service/support & pinning the problem on the consumer. I'll be returning all & going Intel & Nvidia. Thanks 4 the heads up.
I’ve been anti Asus for a minute. They’re a scumbag company.  I had the same sound issues with my 2700x build and an Asus mobo. They also have the fun “lightingservice.exe” bug that EAC detects as a possible hacking tool, so you need to kill the task before you try to play any game with EAC. It was really fun when Pavlov added it and I was sitting in a black loading screen in VR for several minutes.
I regret that I just bought a ROG router, not because I dont like it, but because of ASUS horrible anti-consumer behavior. I can assure you, it will be my last ROG purchase until they get their [stuff} together.
Fuck! I just ordered a new pc with ASUS ROG Strix B650E-F 😅   Already in contact with my provider and I hope I can switch it for something else.
😂 1:13 "keep your stuff" at least your editor noticed you said "shit" and changed it with an obviously incongruent voice-over to "stuff," since you don't want the YT police shutting you down for saying shit too soon in the video hahaha
my last build was Asus and I did not have any issues with it but I am gald I am on MSI now. I also have an Asus laptop that has problems now and then so I will be replacing soon but not with asus. I will steer clear of them from now on.
I recently had issues with ASUS as their repair service is absolute crap as I sent them my laptop which was under warranty and they sent it back to me after "fixing" it but they didn't fix the issue I sent it in for.  It took me emailing the company CEO and complaining for them to send me a refurbished computer so I'm not dealing with them anymore.  I think I'll go with MSI or someone else for my next new laptop
I kicked ASUS to the curb after they refused to RMA a ASUS TUF Gaming X570-PRO which was well within the warranty period...simply because and I quote "We have discontiued that motherboard." No offer to substitute a different board or a percentage off another board...they did offer to let me buy a much more expensive board at full retail though.
The Nvidia board of director must be very happy.
Did you say swapping motherboards is what fixed your at home issues!? (The go xlr, sound cutting out, random blue screens, mice and keyboard intermittently working) I had literally the exact same issues and assumed file corruption and did a full windows reset. I fear im seeing early similar symptoms again on the fresh windows. Any response would actually help me out a lot and the odd thing is I'm on x570!
I have been running my Asrock X370 Taichi since 2017 and it’s been pumping R3 1200, R7 3800x and now R7 5800X3D rock solid no problem.
I'll keep buying old servers when i need more compute power. Best bang for buck for pure computing (not gaming).
it took Steves vid for you to do this video so... says alot about you too
I'd say their GPU department is greedy as hell. Comparing their ROG RTX 4090 to something like the Aorus Master just shows they're trying to scalp off the top without really adding anything special.
I have ASUS X470-Pro from 2018. The best motherboard I had, costing around half of mid-range AMD CPU (a reasonable price). I think, not just with ASUS but with all brands things went south since introduction of PCIx Gen4. It is small issues suggesting underlying bigger problem... from the way company name products (WTF is RoG class?), their pricing (motherboards as expensive as prior-to-last-generation high-end graphics card?) and their quality. What these companies do not understand is that they do not protect they brand by hiding issues and pushing more ads. Those "brands" are earned by years of quality products, reasonable pricing, variety of products with different combination of features for different customer types, communications with customers and B2B with their partners (like AMD), etc. What they are currently doing is trading hard-earned reputation for money. Once they run out of reputation, they will run out of money as well.
I personally love Asus so this really sucks, but accountability is something allot of companies have lost site of. Hopefully this kicks their ass in gear. Appreciate what you do J. Much love to you and the crew.
Love the honesty and standing up to the giant companies! Thank you ❤
I wonder who left Asus to cause their product line to fall apart.  Usually when we see this there was one lynch pin middle manager who kept people honest above and below them, and the employee skipped off to a struggling brand willing to throw money at them to fix their problem.  Hardware has to work, otherwise the brand name is useless.
❤ asus. Will this stop me from buying asus ? No.  apologies to all the amd boys having this issue. Would i use a beta version bios to do some overclocking ? No. I have run into this issue whete the bios wasnt optimised, took almost a month to get an update. Cheers jay
Get Gaijined Asus
yeah i'm definitely done buying ASUS as well. had 2 of the same board from them fail the same way, the 24 pin connector either straight up didn't work, or i would have to position the connector in a certain way to get it to work. and if i bumped my desk or computer even slightly it would just turn off. their qa testing is dog shit
This is so frustrating. I've been a dedicated ASUS motherboard guy forever. I guess I'll have to find a new brand.
I have a X670E Hero motherboard and AMD 7950x. I've been getting consistent crashes of my computer (blue screen of death) and game crashes. I replaced the entire motherboard and cpu. I was suspecting the motherboard this entire time. Wondering if anyone else has been having this problem?
ASRock B450M Pro4 is a god-tier MB for me and it's been going strong in my main server/gaming rig since 2020. Had one of the older Taichi's of theirs from around 2016 and that was also a great stable mobo.
Every computer I've ever built, I've used an Asus board and its been several.  I guess that all changes today.  Thank you.
I freaking love my Asrock.
JayzTwoCents, thank you for your honesty. Truly. We appreciate you. I will be using an MSI board when I upgrade my PC, instead of the ASUS ROG board I had planned.
I work in the PC industry. When I was building my ryzen 9 5900x pc, all my friends and coworkers were like "go with Asus!". I was debating between GIgabyte, MSI or Asus. Gigabyte was going through the whole exploding PSU situation and warranty issues. MSI...I hate their BIOs. Asus was all around the one that had good looks and features I wanted. I ended up getting the ROG X570 Hero. I won't be buying another Asus product. Also at work, we've been getting Asus mobos with fuzz and stuff in it. Not many have bent pins, but it has happened a couple times.  We had a bad batch of GPUs from them recently.
I have a Maximus from 2017.  Rock solid.  I slid to home base before the throw.  Whew!
lol I can imagine Asus customer service picking up the phone and saying, "Oh, you have prahbrem? You have no prahbrem!  You penis so beeeg!  Our penis so small!"
I want to thank you, as I was going to buy an ASUS board and did not know about this problem. I shall be going with another manufacturer for a different board. Thank you Jay for keeping us informed.
I, have the crosshairs hero VIII have it 2019 constant audio, stability, and CPU overheat at startup. My apps work the shut down at random this has been an on going problem. $400 in the trashcan have to save to change out my motherboard.
What is a good alternative for asus? For premium
Their laptops are a total catastrophe right now. The AMD laptops suffer from ftpm stuttering and the new 2023 machines suffer from insane system latency, to the degree where its impossible to even listen to music due to crackle/pops let alone do any actual real time audio work. Yesterday I installed a new computer with a z790 Prime Wifi motherboard, and it had some sort of blemish on the cpu socket making me think it was a bent pin. Luckily it was just in the plastic holding the pin.
All I have ever owned is ASUS motherboards. I've given other brands a shot and never found their quality even close. The decline of ASUS is sad. If your product works, it's still the best. I built an ITX system with the ASUS Z790I + 13900KS. Zero issues and zero AMDIP. The 7950X3D requires lasso and a lot of hassle to get proper performance.
I used to love ASUS, I started moving away from them in my builds about 4 years ago after a bad RMA experience.
Expensive and prone to failure, that's what ASUS-branded motherboards have become to me now. Thanks for highlighting the experiences you have with the corp, Jay.
my friend had his gaming laptop's motherboard get destroyed because of a poor Liquid metal application.  first of all LM should never be used on a laptop because LM can drip out and still destroy the board, and second LM doesn't last more than 2 years.
Damn. I’ve been buying ASUS for over 20 years without many issues. I love that they have all their old board drivers and documentation. I just built a old pentium 233 mmx system and they had everything I needed to make it happen and it still works! I guess I’ll need to rethink them for my next build.
doesn't matter if your product is amazing, if the support sucks, then so does the product
Is that a J quick stick in the background?
Thx Jay for your honest review on this issue ❤ I had the same problem with an ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-F GAMING WIFI on which 2 pins where bend. Thankfully the seller believed me and got me an exchange board which was good.
I've worked in IT for 20 years. Built hundreds of PC's. Now I buy complete systems. And might only do a ram or gpu upgrade after its 4-5 years old. For me, an all encompassing warranty is necessary. Having to troubleshoot hardware issues. Remove parts, rma and ship it, wait for part to come and install it, its not worth it since i'm older and value my time more.
Good to know ASUS is being scumy as hell. A fallow up of this you should inform what companies are best to buy from. What companies have good RMA. Help inform us to know who to buy from to not get totally screwed. Who is best to buy from of a comapny we can trust an stand by. Is there any now a days?
It's disgusting what ASUS is doing to its customers, never again ASUS, goodbye!
All Scumbags Undermine Systems
I bought a Asus Rog XG43UQ Monitor. It was a flash sale for $699 with a $100 rebate. Having the Monitor for consoles and PC for 120hz. I'm happy with the experience. Dealing with the Asus on getting the $100 rebate. I was going to swear off Asus, but that Asus rog ally looks like to be a game changer. I'm second guess my thoughts on that now after this video.
I had a recent RMA for 3070 that was a good experience and came out thinking ASUS stands behind their products.   I bought a used gpu from fb marketplace that they replaced on rma. The replacement was broken. They provided me with another new one different model that has been great.   Not sure if it was that model gpu but at the same time ASUS wanted to rma my mobo which I said no let’s wait on the gpu cause I didn’t want to take my mobo out.  I dropped it off at their offices the first rma, and the rest has been them providing shipping.  For what it’s worth I had a great rma experience. Compared to vulcan or western digital or gigabyte it has been the best I have had aside from Sony.
Damn shame. I have always enjoyed ASUS products up until now
I just did 3 builds with 3 different ASUS boards and my biggest problems were with not having checked that a board needed a BIOS update for the 13th gen CPU (I had a 12th gen for one of the builds, so not really a problem) and a *Gigabyte* 4080 card whose software didn't want to work unless it was the first software installed. The Gigabyte customer service on that issue was quite condescending as well, so they got a bit of condescending back from me. So, I guess I don't have high expectations of ANY manufacturer's customer service now, but at least my hardware is working ok. Now, my biggest issue is that FanXpert didn't want to update in the AC. So, from a software support POV, I'm less happy with ASUS than I am from a hardware POV. It will be awhile before I do another build, so I guess I will keep an eye out for how this situation with ASUS progresses in the meantime...Fingers crossed my MBs stay good.
Dear Asus: It's been real, it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun. Farewell.
I have not one problem with the 3 I’ve  owned . That is horrible ASUS!!!😡😡😡😡. My next build will not have ASUS!!!
😏it's amazing to hear you talking about this jay. I stopped buying anything that has asus on it when they screwed me on 2 sabertooth motherboard builds. they didn't want to help then . lost around 1500.00 on them will never buy anything with asus on it
A sad thing :( I have always liked ASUS, But quality/ reliability /support are an absolutely a requirement for me when Iook at buying a MB.
Oh how i love it when im doing things right with not buying these expensive brands :D
I too fired ASUS some years back. I had an ASUS GTX570 that failed in an interesting way.  During gaming it would crash sporadically, so I purchased the Heaven benchmark so that I could put a load on the graphics card without having to sit there and play a game. It could run for 24hr on DX9 but if you switched to DX11 (or was it 12) it would crash typically inside an hour of use. I was able to repeat this by pulling the card out and putting it in a completely different PC and the same thing would happen so I was confident it was the card. I took it back to the retailer once and ASUS themselves twice. ASUS simply took the card and the next thing I'd know is it was shipped back to me. No-one would communicate with me so I could describe the problem so they could test for it themselves. It simply came back as supposedly working. I'd test it the same way and get the same result. In the end I sold the card on the 2nd hand market clearly stipulating the issue the card had and as such I got only $20 for it which was fair enough really. Time is money and the amount of time I put into testing that card and the fact that I also bought testing software to in the end get nothing was very frustrating so at that time I swore off ever buying an ASUS product again, not because of the fault, but I didn't want to ever have to deal with the terrible customer service again. I also swore off that retailer too, again I didn't want to have to deal with their customer service again either. I was inclined to think my experience was perhaps limited to my own country or the staff at the time, but this piece shows the badness goes to the top and makes me glad I've stayed away from ASUS. I recently had to RMA an Intel i9-10900K and whilst it was a drawn out process it did get resolved and I have a replacement CPU.
Thanks
Let's not forget the overpricing.  ASUS has NEVER had the same amount of features, or has poorer audio codecs, as other manufacturers.
Well said! Thank you for supporting the community!
I have 3 Asus boards in 3 systems. The oldest is the B365m-Plus, then the z690 D4 and the White Prime z790-A. I have had no issues and have all the Bios up to date. I made Asus my MB company. Now I have to seriously look at other board companies for my next couple of builds. Jay has been on point with a lot of information so I am going to trust him on this because as a consumer I don't have access to the details and information he has. Thanks Jay.
My Asus 27 inch ips 144 monitor can't do 144 without flickering so I'm stuck at 90hz freesync. Hidden recall finding out years later.
Jay greetings from Athens.A well known Greek reviewer found out Asus are ''rotating'' samples between reviewers globally.That could explain faulty hardware.
Msi mobos past 10 years we goods
I was wanting to upgrade to the Asus strix motherboard for am5 I wanted the 7800x3d but I'm not touching them now
This level of incompetency is an indication of employee dissatisfaction with the company. It could be full time employees replaced with temps. It could be diversity quotas letting in unqualified individuals to handle sensitive jobs. It could be diversity quotas creating workplace drama and retribution. It could be that someone overqualified (who carried the load of the engineering work) left the company or was fired for being a straight white male.
That's why i always go for MSI !
wow wtf  if i cant get a white 1 i dont want it
It took 7 times sending it back to get an M279Q without dead pixels.
I got a ASRock Z590 Steel Legend, it's been BOSD free since May 2021.
Wow, now I'm worried about my Asus Z690 Prime -A mobo that I just bought last year. Having trouble with the sound when plugged into the back. I'm using the headphone socket in the frnt right now and not sure what the problem is and am worried that I'll have to change out the mobo. smh. I frickin' really hate integrated sound on a mobo. Do they still sell sound cards and can I install one in this new PC?
I've used MSI boards for years. USB 3 was wonky but worked on an old H110M until bios revision.  No problems with controllers.  No problem with WIFI nor LAN.  Never had a blue screen of death - never.
MSI FTW
Working at a tech retailer, Asus has consistently been the very worst brand for warranty and repairs. They will send back a board with a fault confirmed by our techs as obvious as "no power on" with "BIOS updated, no fault found", and when we test it again it's still doing the same thing. We do not have this issue with MSI, Gigabyte, or Asrock, who will repair or replace with a new/refurb product. Asus has a QVL for literally every part in a computer and if your test bench didn't only consist of those approved parts they sometimes won't even listen to you (note that most of their own products are not featured on these QVLs). Asus has an extremely strong brand image and we constantly get customers insisting on an Asus product because they want the best and don't want an alternative from an "inferior" brand, despite our experience telling us that Asus is at the bottom of the tier list in many ways. With how much they charge for some of their premium products I expect much better service and warranty than they actually provide.
Add to send a Rog Psu back one time biggest joke of a process I've ever experienced other than AT&t they lost the stupid thing after they charged me shipping to send back their broke product can't remember if I even ever got that resolved finally had to give up complete idiots
I officially already miss EVGA graphics cards for this exact reason... They actually gave a shit about us the customer. This year for PC's are getting worse and worse.
Jesus? X670 e with 7950 x3d😢
I had many bad experiences with ASUS with their motherboards and a GPU  because their customer support is very poor and their product quality is iffy at best, so I changed several years ago to MSI
Thanks Jay - ASUS is now officially on my blacklist. Thats approximately 50+ devices a year that they miss out on.
Welp this sucks. ASUS motherboards were the only ones I would buy for years. I don't like the other brands either 🥲
Thumbs up!!  Good on you for calling them out!  I used to be a PC tech and computer consultant.  Over the decades I have seen companies QC go up and down for just about every company.  I suspect that ASUS will fix their QC issues when they see profit loss.
3/10
Jay you are a suck up to AMD and their products are trash over and  over. Their GPUs always have faulty drivers, horrid performance compared to Nvidia, loads of issues with the builds straight from AMD. Their CPUs were solid although you needed a past gen CPU to flash a 3000 to 5000 many times last gen, now this gen they explode? So yea, Intel is the better choice there too. Why do you suck up to AMD so much? how much did they pay you? Asus may be losing quality, but the board I have of theirs is running perfectly fine so I never had any issues with them myself in decades. I want to see you blast AMD how you do to Nvidia and Asus and the others, you seem like a paid actor at this point. Asus customer support has been poor, but so is AMDs
Damn I'm regretting buying a ROG motherboard for my build.... and it's a shame because it was my favourite brand
There is a very good reason for that decline. ROG mobos aren't a mainstream product, there are basically identical mobos, by ASUS that are cheaper and sell better. It doesn't make sense financially to support your least well selling product. This is why LTT always says don't buy the "best" board, buy the best selling board.
Ukrane says he don't like ASUS
I guess I'll be look at removing my ASUS TUF-Gaming X670E Plus WIFI and replacing it with a MSI MAG X670E Tomahawk WIFI.   The ASUS board also has pretty limited RAM support.  Also I care a whole log about RGB, but Armoury Crate decides what it wants to do by itself.  RGB Off is the only thing that consitently works upon wakeup, startup, or restart.  Maybe the RAM will come back with the settings you had, maybe it will be off maybe it will be rainbow, maybe it will be only one of two sticks.  Same with fans.  The leds on the back of the mother board are just doing their own thing right now.
Well, after reading a article on Kitguru about UK ASUS PR thinking it was fine to buy positive reviews...  Yeah, Asus, this isn't fine at all.  Anything else we want to find out about this company?  What's with tech companies fighting their way to the bad tech company award all of a sudden?  x.x
i'm sorry but if you're going to boycott and fire asus but then keep using their GPU you're just acting entitled. put up or shut up. nuke it all.
I'm with you when it comes to ASUS and "Quality of Hardware" (with nearly all Hardware I had/have since 2000, I got problems and even with current Hardware like my ASUS PRIME X570 Pro and ROG-STRIX-RX6700XT-O12G-GAMING Graphics Card, there are still issues). AsRock is (as you say) way better (no problems till today with different PC builds I made, equals for me or my friends)  On the other side, I can't understand that you resent about the second Board you got as replacement for the defective one. Every(!) Manufacturer has only the need of delivering a customer a working part.  It doesn't have to be new. Only whatever was in the CPU-socket should have been removed by whoever has checked and packed it before shipping.  Only in this special case, that you got a NEW Motherboard delivered defective, a NEW replacement would be nice (but is still not part of the warranty). Also you already got all additional parts with the first delivery, no manufacturer has to deliver them twice when only one part is defective.  But still, it's a good choise to separate from ASUS. I still don't know what to do with my ROG-STRIX-RX6700XT-O12G-GAMING, it works fine as long as I don't try using it with a Monitor with 144Hz or 165 Hz. Only 60Hz can be used without issues/fails, but I still don't know if it comes from the AMD drivers or the Card itself, since the problems vary a bit with driver Updates. When using a NVidia RTX 4070 TI, everything is fine (so far no problems from cables, Powersupply or Monitor, as I can see).
Asus   has   been  having issues   for   the   last  3  to  4  years.   I had  a  z690  board  go   boom    fortunately  it  didn't  damage   anything  else.  I   dropped  ASUS  a  while ago  been  using   msi  or  gigabyte.
PRIME X570-PRO I sent in for warranty last year, Asus wouldn't even try to boot it up (the issue I sent it in for) because a RAM tab was physicly broken, and I didn't care about that, but apparently, any excuse to not warranty a board, right? Replaced it with a ROG Strix B550 board, and suddenly my ram will run at it's advertised speed (It wouldn't with the X-570 Prime board) so apparently, the board wasn't right from the very beginning.  I'm not sure if I'll be sticking with them in the future or not.  All the hardware for the B550 board, I just transferred over from the X-570, and it ran way better.
It is not for nothing that ASUS quality has regressed from "rock solid" to "hitting a stone with a pebble".
The Nintendo Of Computers...
18 years ago I had a Asus highend Laptop which stopped getting software updates after 18 months and it caused no end of problems so I am not surprised by this. How ever I have not bought another Asus product since.
I've been saying ASUS is shit since like 2006.  Used to work at a computer repair shop.  We kept getting DOA ASUS boards, some of which appeared to be 'refurbished' sneakily sold as new (stickers over the stickers on the box, obvious physical damage).  ASRock has bee stable for me, every time.  Also MSI is good for motherboards... not happy with other MSI products.
RIP ASUS
Yep. That is one dirty Corp. No more asus for me too
Guy recommend me a good ddr5 motherboard for intel i7 13th gen and 4070. ( Not Asus ) Edit: Well I saw his another video where he praised MSI's quality getting better and better over the years. So I'm gonna go with MSI board. I have heard that tomahawk one's are good but  not entirely sure about that.
Meanwhile me thinking of going in deep into ASUS products...then this popped up before my decision...lol
Wish you'd done this video before I forked out for  a 790z hero that arrived with bent pins.,
The Asus tax isn't wat it use to be
i've bought a ROG STRIX X670E-E GAMING WIFI, just problems and problems. I put my ram and my cpu on an Asrock steel leggend, everything worked perfectly. x670E with 10007 still in beta bios on asus, Asrock has a bios with 10007A not in beta. My last Asus for many many time.
I have been out of the loop on your videos for the last 2 years. When I finally got my 3070ti after my cpu upgrade. I feel off the cliff for tech videos since im happy with my current build. Now that I'm about to upgrade my cpu(it's been 3 years) my uncle sent me this video since all I buy is asus rog boards, I'm going to take this with a grain of salt because I'm not quite in the loop
The importance of quality control has become a joke the same thing happen with automotive industry
BTW...I have an older ASUS MB...am I safe?   Model:  ROG STRIX X570-F Gaming.  Haven't had an issue since building this back in 2019.
Damn shame ASUS, been using components for years. The X470 board had so many I/O issues with USB devices I returned it.  Then it was SMDs mounted backward blowing up, and now this.
Thanks Jay!
I always had ASUS boards going back to AM2, i bought a ASUS TUF B450 and Ryzen 3600, my 3200Mhz CL16 RAM wouldnt work above 2666Mhz and CPU using 1.475V on desktop, wouldnt vary under load, updated BIOS, no improvement. Friends ASUS Prime B450 was stuck at 3000Mhz and 1.45V but bios update fixed both, but still worrying levels of voltage out of the box.  Whereas in partners MSI B350M Mortar, and Asrock B450m HDV in the server (cheapest B450 available at the time)  it worked at XMP just fine and voltage was more like 1.1-1.35V, it actually varied under load.  I ended up buying a substantially cheaper MSI B450M Mortar, RAM even worked at 3600Mhz CL18, and has done for 3 years with 4.3 all core OC, still lower voltage and tempts than the ASUS TUF B450.
these companies got so fucking comfortable screwing their customers base when pc hardware became ultra limited and expensive and now we are speaking up no company is your friend
JayzTwoCents and Gamers Nexus represent everything that is great about the internet and being solid humans in the process.  \m/
How can u fire somebody if like u said theres no contract. I dont recommend it but u should either lie about that or be real and say u need the drama. Or just say ur pissed off about how u got treated this video is bull.
Damn that sucks, good i watched this video but it puts a damper on my mood a lot. So i have to change my monitors too, because the newer 144 hz model cant even display 144 hz anymore just 120, because at 144 hz it began blurring the bottom of the screen. If ASUS is screwing with Motherboards, what about Monitors and stuff. I liked that company, for it getting stupid is just sad on another level ;.;
Guess i will never buy asus phone again And any of their product
you know. back in the day i had an ASUS P8Z77. it was in a massive case. with like 1000 blue LEDs. i called it Dr. Manhattan. one morning i turned it on, went downstairs to make breakfast, came back and it was going blue like normal, AND flickering red. I didnt think anything of it, maybe one of the lights is already dying. i got them from radio shack for like 10c. a minute later i smelled it. i thought i forgot to turn the toaster oven off. so i go check it. no? it IS off....  i dont smell it anymore.  oh well.  get back to my room and notice Dr. Manhattan is now purple and flashing red. ALOT. i snatched  the power cord from the wall. ripped out all the cables to the tower and ran to the bathroom with it. set it in the tub and smothered it with towels. after everything was said and done i had a hole the size of a dime in it.  after a full day on the phone with their customer support and multiple emails with pictures. they claimed that it was my fault for adding in so many LEDs. even though they were all powered by a 3rd party transformer and only switched by the mobo.  so SC then, ive never used asus. i said if this is how a big company will treat customers im never spending alot of money on a mobo again. ive been a Gigabyte fan for years now.
Thank you for this video. Much appreciated  sir.  Full respect. Keep doing what you do best.
Vote with my money I'm done with Asus and all the companies that follow this line of consumer disregard easy to go else where
I purchased 3 B450 Gaming II boards and fitted them with Ryzen 5600g chips to provide an upgrade for my family without having to mortgage my home to provide them with video... added 210x wifi modules, and everything works great with one exception - the bios will NOT display the cpu temp correctly... it shows something like - 69c (negative number)... this with the newest bios - wrote ASUS, and have not even received a response... kinda worrying....
ASUS lost me as a customer when their fan control software (for mobo) decided to stop controlling fans based of GPU temp  because I dared to switch from ASUS GPU to other vendor. Overall GPU temp is a standardized sensor there's no reason to do this but scummy client retention tactics. Then long search to regain proper fan control started, and it came down to Argus monitor for which I'm happily paying.  ASUS software was absolute trash in comparison.
Thanks, Jay, for putting some pressure on them. I have noticed something else. They have removed the driver and bios section for the 2021 and 2022 laptops from their website. Not sure, but maybe this SOC voltage issue affects moble too?
Me sweating for just buying a Asus ZenBook. ...... I do love it tho
Shame my current build is 8 years old and I was planning an AMD Asus mobo. Guess I’ll check out MSI or ASrock
I actually quite like MSI i got a white edge board for my intel board and happened to have a MSI Powersupply and gpu. No complaints from their products. funnily enough i was close to going AM5 and asus but amazon was out of stock of the processor and i wanted a build within that week so i switched to i7-13700k build.
Do you regret optimizing your build for aesthetics now?
i never liked asus stuff for some reason 😄
Where do the dislike come from?
This is strong!
Dang shame to hear this i have a asus maximus hero x wifi ac mother board and it is grest paired with a asus rog 1070 strix oc card guess when i do a ddr5 build ill go eles where. 😮
matter of fact you cant trust any reviewer that is sponsored, because they cant be truthful when a product is bad otherwise they will lose their sweet sponsorship
Sounds like their poor customer service finally came back to bite them. Too bad the other motherboard manufacturers are garbage too... Maybe EVGA can take over the Motherboard market.
Ouch, I've been using Asus since they first entered the EU/UK market places for both business and home systems. They really have a whole to dig themselves out of to cause me to look at their solutions in the future.
Utter scumbags
Thanks Jay dor keeping it transparent with community and letting them know what's going on behind the scenes. This news will totally change my product preference for sure
It's not enough to end the sponsorship. You must also stop benchmarking and reviewing all ASUS products. That's the only thing that people can do to really hurt them, because their only care is attention and market share, and as attention drops, so does market share. That's the only thing that will get them to change. I've already known for 20 years that ASUS is to be avoided. Every single ASUS hardware I've ever bought, has failed early and had tons of annoying malfunctions along the way. It's almost to the point where if everyone gets screwed, it's like no one gets screwed, because everyone assumes it's only them having problems, when it's everyone. So ASUS gets to fly under the radar even though their products are awful. They are a plague on the industry, but still manage to keep their failures under wraps and get to move on like it never happened.
Gigabyte, MSI, even ASROCK over Asus any day baby.
Asrock is more stable than Asus.. oh how the time goes by. I use Asrock, but it's because it's less expensive than MSI, Gigabyte, and definitely Asus. Asus is, like, the top of  Premium brand, and Asrock used to be "it's cheap but good enough"... wow
ROC Strix B550-I does not support the 4000 series invidia. No bios updates available and not likely will. What is a recommended alternative?
DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A = SUS!!! 😂😂😂 , REALLY THO I have a TUF mobo, and I will be going with another Brand when I need to upgrade, I was thinking Gigabyte since I have a Gigabyte GPU, but I also heard great things about MSI Mobos from buildzoid, especially their BIOS being super solid compared to other brands, so yeah, I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANYTHING ASUS AGAIN, BECAUSE OF ALL THIS, not just because of jays video either, its Steve from gamers nexus that really got me to this conclusion, and jay just cemented it!!😐best of luck ASUS, you're going to need it!
Jay is all aboard the outrage pony.  Sorry Jay, you're fired!
Couldn't agree more about the ASUS software part: it's all ass.  The CREATOR suite is wonky and provides a horrible UX. The Armoury Crate is a memory hog and leaks RAM so much it'll eventually BSOD your system. (not to mention it's basically a rootkit and has some components that are downloaded in the background and WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT that tick off antivirus/antimalware software.) I've decided I'm happy with worse RGB on my Claymore I than I am willing to put up with this garbage software.
Myself and my brother bought an Asus mobo back in 2019 for £300+ both mobos have a 50/50 chance to connect to the Internet every time we turn on our computers. Overclockers uk did offer to change the motherboards but we didn't want to be without 2 computers for a week or two. So we just put up with turning on and off our computers till the mobo connects to the Internet. Won't be using Asus again.
Jesus, another channel that feeds off misery & problems by magnifying a problem and not even mentioning anything in their defense.  ASUS is far from perfect but how about making some REAL claims: - the "voided warranty" message is on ALL BIOS updates and is there to prevent a ton of RMA-ing by people who fucked up their BIOS flash - ASUS already said that any RMA for the involved motherboards that stem from this problem WILL get honored even if the beta BIOS was used - they have removed the voided warranty message for that specific BIOS update to stop more whining from people like you  You made it sound as if they added that message JUST for that BIOS and that's just being malicious on purpose. Both you and Gamer Nexus have been feeding off manufacturer screw ups more and more to the level where it has turned into a sad pathetic with hunt. My respect for Gamer Nexus NOSEDIVED when they made video after video after video of the same problem because they knew it got views & clicks. It's one thing to point out a problem, it's another to milk it  to a ridiculous degree.  Companies fuck up - give them a chance to fix things. ASUS released a BETA BIOS,  you bitch it's not fixed. What part of "BETA" don't you get? And then you whine about why they'd release a beta. Maybe to get customer feedback to see if it got fixed? Maybe? Perhaps? You sound like you're new to the business.  Now if they don't bother releasing another BIOS and leave the half-working beta, THEN you have a legitimate complaint but dear lord, stop click baiting and view hunting like an amateur and give them time to fix it!
I have had terrible warranty service from Asus lately.  They are hard to recommend.
As a first time pc builder i was gonna go with an asus motherboard but after hearing everything that's going wrong what would be the second choice motherboard for and cpu's?
remember when all the youtubers banded together against msi and their practises? that lasted until the next paycheck lol
Got a new Asus board. it died after a few months. Just binned it and bought an Asrock board. no issues after years of hard graft.
I think you are blowing it out of proportions, Asus already said they are not voiding you warranty for the beta bios.
maybe take the extra money and get a system you wont be forced to overclock to run your mission critical applications.
Still waiting for Asus to finalize their latest beta bios....  Currently running 1303, which is also supposed to protect the X3D chips with a max 1.3V on SOC. 1401 beta limites regular 7000 chips to 1.3V on SOC. And 1410beta includes a AGESA update, and adds the  new DDR5 lay out support.  Honestly, starting to hate these companies that only do hardware, but then suck at providing any good software support at all...
Jay In 2 months: "Hey guys I have a new 1500$ ASUS board to show you! It's sooooo great. ASUS is soooooo great...."
See should stuck with EVGA EVGA did I say.?
my  bord  did not  had security stiker e670x
I've used ASUS boards for years.. idk what happening rn with their stuff.. But something i'm sure i will stay with them.. until they sort it out
in cca 2002/3, the first asrock boards we ordered to our pc shop were hilariously shit. 15 years later my preference for a new mobo would be asrock > gigabyte > asus.
Hmm It looks like it did something. Now they don't have info abou warranty avoidence.
Lalallalallalalalla ...after 1000 years comes Out the reason why it callin "Asus youre fired" ...i hate click *itches
for me this downfall began during Coffee Lake and the Maximus XI series.
damn and i was just going to buy a pg27aqn monitor....
Its funny how ASRock has actually become quality whereas Assus has become junk.  I used to have an ASRock X370 ITX board the only problem with that board was the INTEL gigabit ethernet, Goddamn Intel ethernet is horseshit its absolute junk.  But ASRock was good, it overclocked good, it had a lot of features I actually miss when I use Asus there is just clutter and overall bad design like WTF is this?  The fact I had to send back my Asus board and get ASRock back, says it all really.
who has problems with their mobo software? i still get a Asio.sys error (2)", been that way for years on lots of different models...
14:10 using an asrock board from 2019 and it still rock hard XD
finally asus been trash since ryzen 1 came out.  I switch to MSI years ago and its by far the best boards I have ever had.
I'm gonna buy Aventum X, i hope it doesn't have any issues when it comes in
Wait 5 mins and Jay will jump on another bandwagon. Here it comes get ready to jump Jay.
It takes many many years to build a good reputation. And it only takes one day or less to destroy it. Well done, Asus.
And ASUS response?
DOing a great job mate, thanks for your honesty and support
Gigabyte power supply now Asus Motherboards next MSI...?
I thought ASrock is same company as ASUS
My MB is Asus and I have no issues. But I love that you tell us to be careful about the brand and stop receiving sponsorship. That makes you guys to be trusted more and more
Now asus vs kit guru what a good news
Recntly upgraded to an ASRock 6700XT and it's been solid. Had no  idea they were ever one of the lower end brands.  I know i will be avoiding aSUS tho xD I dont really follow much if any of the whole PC/component review side of you tube(just here and LTT) so thanks for the update :)
Gave up on ASUS when Armoury Crate was conceived. That shit is basically malware.
Just buy from American companies like EVGA to avoid all of this
couldnt agree more.
I dropped ASUS from my life like fourteen years ago due to poor support, random problems, failing fans, instability.  Been running ASRock and ASRock Rack since... 2013.. steady as a rock, outstanding support. I had a server-grade board, four years out of support, got a full replacement due to an intel SOC error. My most recent build, 3900X based, I wasn't happy with the placement of the USB-C front-panel connector, as it was in the way of the graphics card. Wrote them and asked how I was meant to connect everything up, considering it's then a gaming board without room for a large graphics card, and they just sent me a right-angle connector free of charge.  They really do seem to care, both ASRock rack and ASRock - cannot recommend them enough.
Does this mean you won’t review any Asus products going forward or do you just not use them in builds etc.?
It"s very sad to hear this, I have used my maximus formula ix for 5+ years and it keeps running my 7700K @5GHZ no problems, I recently bought a strix 3070ti and it works wonders. It's very sad to be considering if I wanna use an asus motherboard again in my new build because I've alaways used asus without problems. I hope they get their *stuff* together...
i feel asham that I owned a B650e itx motherboard and a 4070ti from ASUS for my new build. 😥
Thank you for doing this Jay. We as the end user appreciate your voice and help stop big cooperates from taking a free pass on shoddy work and QC
I had ROG Phone 2 (Phone) and it just stopped working one day, SOMEHOW! and it can't be fixed 'cause the SOC died. no point contacting them 'cause that issue is all over the internet.
Honestly, at this point I am so happy to have an Asrock AM5 board. Originally I ordered an Asus board, as it was the only mini-ITX AM5 board my favourite shop could offer. The shop then had long delivery times for Asus and later got the Asrock board in stock. Asrock was available for immediate delivery and I changed my order on the fly. With all that stuff around Asus going on, I am very happy how everything turned out.
I still have asrock mother board 1151 300 series bought in 2019
Not surprised. Already found that out when I bought a B550 TUF and it doesn't even have an Equalizer built in. I am sorry but every 20 year old Mainboard had that, but Asus cheaped out on that function for some Dolby shit nobody uses. Yeah, this is the last Mainboard from Asus I will buy. I should have stuck to Gigabyte but the local store didn't have any in stock.
Asus have been top tier suk for years already. I'm amazed people haven't dropped them sooner.
Jayz have spoken.  Mad respect to you.
What a sad state of affairs. I’ve been using Asus motherboards since the 90’s. Yeah, I’m that old. Vote with your wallet folks.
Omg I literally decided against Asus right b4 this all came into light and bought Gigabyte, I'm so greatful!!!
hi i built new pc and i have 4090& 7800x3d what mobo i have to get now?? I canceled  ASUS PRIME X670E-PRO i have to Choose  MSI MPG B650 EDGE /MSI PRO X670-P/GIGABYTE X670 GAMING X .... help please????
Repairing ASUS laptops I saw a steady decline in quality. This particularly concerns the product's design and it seems to have affected their budget products long before it began affecting the more top-end ones. Like $1200 laptops with wobbly shells around the mousepad, which exerted pressure on sensitive components from simply the weight of the average user's hand. This is when I started seeing warped connectors leading to a separate PCB containing the SATA reader chip, headphone jack and additional USB ports, resulting in simultaneous intermittent failures to read either the bootable drive, the sound card or the additional USB. Right there and then it became obvious that replacing the PCB or the motherboard altogether would simply lead to exactly the same issue re-occurring with new components because of the crappy design of the plastic/aluminum shells and support post placement. I had to advice the owners of laptops that weren't even 2 years old to just buy a new laptop from a different manufacturer like MSI. It is rather unfortunate because there was a time when I could swear by ASUS quality.
When they reach the top, but then forget how they got there.
Its a sad sight actually. I love my B550-A but its sad that Asus went downhill that hard. Are there any reliable companies out there? Went over from MSI to Asus bc MSI's bad 550/570X boards.
I'm upset they inflate MB cost with expensive components that arn't used like the power control chip Steve talked about
I have a ~month old AMD AM5 R7-7700X CPU and a BRAND NEW (also unused) ASUS AMD AM5 X650E-F ROG STRIX Gaming Motherboard. I haven't even used either yet or broken the seal on the CPU, NOR started my construction of my new build yet at all. Been waiting 4 years to begin construction on my new build, which I'd slated for sometime this year. These were for the mainstay of the core components. I'm past the return policy now on BOTH board and CPU.   HONESTLY, WHAT am I seriously supposed to do at this point with these two components? They seem as though they can't even be safely, effectively used at this point. I have basically $1000 CAD$ sitting in unuseable parts at this moment.   SAD SAD SAD story after we believed heavily in AMD and in ASUS together.   Really they should just be refunding us for ANY and ALL of these components, no questions asked. End of story. Give us back our money and let US, we the FREE, AUTONOMOUS CONSUMERS, decide what we wanna do next with our renewed money.
Good on you for giving Asus the boot! We appreciate all of the hard work from your channel. I tend to alternate between Gigabyte and MSI. Always went with Gigabyte since the early 00s. I bought a couple of other random makes, one of which the company doesn't exist anymore. My last mobo was MSI, and now I'm on Gigabyte again. My problems have been minimal with all of them, save for teething problems on a new platform. I never liked the look of Asus recently, with their ROG line, as they seem to be expensive just because it's for "gamers"
From a standard typical user, this sucks.  I WAS going to get a new gen ROG Strix Scar laptop, but over the news, I went with Lenovo Legion 7i instead.  I had the last two gens of SCAR laptops, but I cannot support Asus at this point.
jesus... if you're gonna call it a beta bios then dont release the board lol
I have that mb too, but i had to take ram sticks out and reduce clocks from the rated speeds down to 4800 from 6400
I ahve exactly ONE Asus board in my small network of home pc's, I built it for my daughter and I've had nothign but trouble with it. My system is Gigabyte, almost no troubles with it. Also ahve an asrock build with no issues. My future purchases will not include Asus products, between my own experience and this BS, who would trust them to do anything?  Wish EVGA made motherboards for amd...absolutely love their products
that's communism
I just hope you don't expect a better user experience with either MSO or ASROCK with RMAs...  You want the RMA experience MSI one in a nutshell, take your faulty product, box it up by the standards set forth, pay for and print the shipping label, and just throw it in the trash, because that's about all the good I have ever seen their warranty coverage amount to, they have a tendency of getting "lost in the mail" after delivery to the warranty center, as they will insist they never received it even when the tracking says they did.  And ASRock's isn't much better.  They might receive it, but they are still going to charge you for the warranty repairs.  And it still may not work.  And all this over an issue with a specific Chipset and CPU combo, that happens with other brands as well?  And an RMA issue of getting the wrong board?  I mean, at least you got a replacement.  And it's particularly the X670E and the "7800X6D" /s.  And it happens differently on ASUS than on other brands.  They are working on a fix and haven't finalized it yet.  And you say you are for the customer, but you have made a number of statements lately that cause me to question that.  "Water Cooling for everyone!" would be a for the consumer statement, but your recent statement in another video of "You should have put that money towards a better graphics card [if you want water cooling]" is very much not a for the consumer statement, as but one example.  Show us you are for the consumer, and help us the option of water cooling to tame our 20/3060's and RX 5500XT's with runaway hotspots that hit thermal shutdown before the before the ambient die temp has the fan curve at maximum fan speed in a market where it cost more for a mid range or low end GPUs than it did top tier just a few years short ago...  $500 used to be the top tier GPUs not all that long ago, now you're lucky to get a low end or mid range GPU for that much, and they are all made with a ticking fuse of a cooling solution no matter how over spec'd the cooler itself is.  A thermal solution is only as good as it's slowest transfer rates, and those stock thermal pads are really slow to transfer heat.  And with minimal contact at that, which acts more as an insulator than a conductor of heat at the low rate of thousandths of watts per difference in face temperatures at 6 W/mK vs tenths of watts of metal on metal for IHS or metal on die (235-398 W/mK) with thermal paste applied over a volume of cubic millimeters.  And it doesn't help that windows update drivers take precedence over manufacturer drivers and take away our control of factors that affect the life of the hardware that aren't available with a windows update driver installed.  Even the mid range GPU in many people's systems cost more than the rest of the system put together these days.
When we gonna see the review of the the new Asus handheld tho? Haha, jks.  I have never been that big on Asus, was always aware of their malicious rma and customer service practices. Glad you and Steve have addressed that, the bios voiding warranty and poor performance across their products :/ bad time to be a PC enthusiast I think
What did you at 1:11 really say before it was dubbed over? :D
Sure !
I'm glad someone is finally covering this out loud. I've sworn off Asus for years now, ever since i went through the exact same chaos you did. My new Asus board died after a few months of use. RMA'd. Got a bad board with bent pins, re-RMA's. Got a DOA board.... RMA'd again to finally get a good used board. and this was a 6 month process I was without a PC. FOUR total Asus boards to finally get a good one? It was obscene, and I had to constantly fight support every step of the way, as the RMA cycles had taken so long, they tried to claim I was out of warranty at that point.... Chaos. Never ever will I use Asus again, and anytime someone I know asks for PC building advice, I always tell them most brands are agnostic, as they should be, EXCEPT Asus - and I tell them my experience.
My last ASUS product was the TUF Sabertooth FX990 Rev 2.0, which was a stable and reliable product. However after several other products without proper support, especially the ASUS TF700 Tablet, which was a real competitor for Apple iPad back in the days, when Tablets were just the new shiny thing to have, I really stop supporting ASUS. The matter that giving my hard earned money for a product, where support in terms of proper updates is just dropped leaving me with an insecure device, which I needed to flash myself (and therewith void the warranty) to have a more recent AndroidOS and benefit from better functionality, features and security updates was just such a let down, that I won't support them for a longer period of time.  Currently running on 2 Gigabyte boards, where especially the the first one had its issues, at least Gigabyte tries to be customer friendly and RMA of one of the boards went well, BIOS updates are okay, even though both are AM4 boards. Price to features that is also acceptable, for comparable boards of ASUS I would have payed hundred Euros more without any benefit besides better RGB maybe. Software of Gigabyte is crap as well, but at least not breaking anything.  Missing the days of more choice in consumer motherboard brands. Gone are the days of DFI, Epox, ECS Elitegroup and others which had all their one product to shine in a generation.  Nowadays for AMD there are only 5 brands in Europe: ASUS, ASRock, Gigabyte, MSI and Biostar. If you consider, that ASUS cannot get my money due to above mentioned, MSI got its UEFI security issue, Biostar having doubtful choice of features it only leave ASRock and Gigabyte to be the brands to choose from.  I think, when I switch to AM5 which is still a year or more away I might look into ASRock, which constantly works on quality and support of their products throughout the last 10 years. It's especially funny to see that the former "cheap copycat child company of ASUS" has better products after years of independence than its further mother company.  Summarized the PC market just needs to get down to earth after years of Mining, inflated prices and nonsense features. We need reliable products with good feature to price ratios.
Asus hasn't been good since 2011. They're hard ware and customer service / warranties are garbage.
Built a new rig with a 4090/13900k and DDR5 6400 back in November and went with an ASRock Taichi Z790 and it has been rock solid.  My previous 2 builds used ASUS motherboards and though i had few headaches, i wanted to try a new board this time around.  I literally felt "internet pressure" to feel bad about going with ASRock, but this was the confirmation bias i needed!
Just buy other brands.  Asus sucks.  Brands like EVGA, Gigabyte, Corsair so much better.  I dont know why Asus every got as popular as it did.
I had the same motherboard model replaced twice. 1st time it was a USB port malfunction, 2nd time was the RAM socket. Finally the CPU socket was over-volting but by then the warranty had expired so i replaced it with a Gigabyte board instead. A SUSpected brand quality control issues i guess.
Asus should take the "u" off their name since you (the customer) is irrelevant, the resulting name "Ass" would better reflect the quality of their products and technical support
ASUS has been living off their reputation since the 90's.  I've never bought any of their boards -- their glory days were over a long time ago.
Oh i know they care. Lol. 1 million views already.
I’ve always liked asus, especially over gigabyte. You can register for warranties after 30 days of purchase, unlike gigabyte. That aspect has always rubbed me the wrong way. Asus’s things have always felt quality too. Idk though. All of my experience was with their am4 motherboards, gpus, and one laptop (which I love). None of these came from their ROG line and I never RMAed anything.  The only brand recently to seem to have done nothing wrong is asrock.  I guess this is why you don’t have brand loyalty unless it’s for seasonic.
"We don't grade brands on their problems, we grade brands on how they handle those problems."  Everyone in business for more than 30 seconds knows this. Calling exceptions to this due to your particular corporate needs is something a business does at their own peril.
i just bought a board
Wow. Wow.
AMD and Asus make a perfect combination 😂 You’d never see these issues with an Intel build.
Asus threw their own reputation to the gutter after building it over the span of many years. Videos all of the net means more people would avoid it now going forward.
Wow, never think a Youtuber will criticize a famous brand for their bad consumer service. I wish other YT channels will do the same. GJ.
I been bitter about asus for a last couple years my friend had a zenith series motherboard $800 board the vrm went out and the rma was really bad first off the representative gave him the wrong address to send the faulty board to one of the many repair facilities they told him to send it to California he paid 2 day shipping just to find out it has to go to their repair facility in Indiana so they sent from California to Indiana the slowest shipping available pretty much they took 2 and half months to send him a brand new one the agent had very poor English he had to go get another one he can’t be without a computer because of him being in I.t so as soon as he got the replacement he sold it well the 2nd one he bought failed as well so after that he went msi but still extremely upset cause I use to be a asus fan but I’ve lost respect for them you can’t just shit on your consumers and think you can get away with it and have no consequences and now they pissed off some of their biggest partners and with them having large  channels allot of people will quit using them
i know i keep checking asus site to see if the beta version has become official but no! no more asus for me.😡
Will be interesting to see where this Asus thing goes. Consumer can always vote with wallet and i would assume this will hit Asus.
I left ASUS after 9th gen. Never looked back. Bye, Felicia. They screwed me over in an RMA, took 21 days to get my RMA back was unacceptable.
can I have one of the boards please?
I love it
ASRock is the jam
I had the biggest fight for them to right my last gen Asus ROG Crosshair VIII Formula Motherboard with issues from again there very own BIOS and them not wanting to fix it properly the whole warranty nightmare took over 4 months with them having an additional $650 of mine for advance rma fee they charged and then proceeded to send me damaged rma motherboards. I finally got my money back by involving my bank and putting a dispute on the charge. To which the whole fix was a BIOS update they sent and I ended up keeping my own motherboard and not any of the RMA boards. So sad to see been a long time supporter of Asus but after this nightmare no more..... charging premium for components and then providing scumbag warranty support straight trash and Asus can go burn in hell. So glad this is going out from big youtubers to get this out to people and make them aware cant wait to see them hurting they got to cocky about being one of the top brands in gaming relm.
ASUS still makes good monitors don't they? I've only bought ASUS monitors so far for the past 20 years. Man, this is so distressing. It was so easy having a company I could rely on when it comes to hardware and monitors. Been a few years since my last build. 5900x/3080 build currently.
I bought a $300 z790-h. It shipped DOA, pcb damage from the assembly line. I RMA'd it. They said the damage was not covered by warranty, and to pay 138 for a replacement or surrender my right to make another RMA in the future. The RMA shipping label was $30. A $300 mobo has cost me $460 so far
Good for You Jay I couldn't be happier to see you finally make a video like this jay especially using Asrock as a reference, Asrock produce's Fantastic products and has for last 10+ years and their customer service is unmatched, I'm mostly happy to see you move away from the same brand names jay we need more brand name review's. Personally I bought A Gigabyte Aorus Motherboard and I wish I could make reviews compared to other manufacturer's like MSI or Asrock VS Gigabyte and Asus. I used to use products like biostar back in the days of ddr and drr2, I have seen new biostar boards and new graphics card manufacturers jay on newegg please if there is anyway we could find out if these products are worth our time, one example....Zotac/PNY/Powercolor all have GPU's on the market and we need to know how they compare up to brands like EVGA/MSI/ASROCK/ASUS! Finally on a last note jay I have watched both of your CPU and Motherboard videos, and well I completely agree with just about everything you have to say and I only see one small issue your not covering in your video's I would really liked stressed to manufacturer's....Well the problem is that all the motherboards seem to have 3 PCIE lanes and 3 M.2 slots but in reality the CPU does NOT support all 3 of both being used, in reality You only ever need 1 PCIE x16 and 1 NVME m.2 slot, if there are 10+ sata ssd slots that would be fine because the cpu does not use 4 lanes for sata....why am I still seeing boards with 3x PCIE x16 and 3X M.2 slots when you can only use 1 of each slot EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......The only solution to this madness is to manufacture cpu's with more then 20 pcie lanes or just stop manufacturing boards this way and only manufacture boards with 1 x PCIE x16 lanes and 1 x M.2 slots reserving the space on motherboards for more important STUFF!!!!! Or you could start doing like old 775 board I have and give us a 32 lane chip to support more lanes for PCIE accessories! Also Jay i want to make a point about high price motherboards vs low price motherboards, If you buy a graphics card you do not need any special VRAM on your motherboard, remember you can only use 1 driver, so if your buying a 4090 card you do not need a motherboard with good VRAM becuase your graphics card has it...but...if your wanting to game without a graphics card you will need to go with Z or X series chipsets becuase the VRAM is meant for 4k gaming without a graphics card!!! ITS THE ONLY REASON MOTHERBOARD PRICES ARE THIS WAY JAY BUT I AGREE WITH YOU ITS WRONG!!!!
For better or worse, I've been ride or die gigabyte for the last 10 years with no issues, period.
You can say many bad things about NZXT but their Motherboard Design is sick , I wish they would more compete in the hardware space.
Going to be tough building my next PC now with all these formerly reliable companies turning into shit. Fuck.
looks like asus caved and took the wording off the bios page that says they won't provide support for installing a beta bios.
Now if the rest of the world will do the same we can say good buy to Asus.
The irony of ASRock being a spinoff of ASUS is not lost on me.
I gave up on Asus years ago when they shit on me with a monitor problem I was having.
I do like ASRock myself
We really do appreciate what you have done for us over the years Jay I was going to buy an ASUS ROG Swift 27-in OLED monitor whenever it came back in stock on Newegg but after checking today it was no longer available on Newegg and after hearing about what this company has done to so many people now over the past few months I think it might honest opinion there is no longer a point to release support this company until they get there crap together it's just so pathetic on what they are willing to do for their customers especially when it involves a 7000 series CPU exploding along with the motherboard what a joke but anyways have a great weekend and keep up with the awesome content.
Thats unreal if you had issues with support.
Asus did that so they can get out of replacing peoples hardware.
Built in gaming wifi?  -___- a serious board would have dual ethernet.
You rely on reliability and Asus doesn't have that.
Yea last HERO Board i purchased was the  hardest install ever i will never buy another way to stress full
And yet Asus motherboards are skyrocketing in price! Used Asus motherboards from 12 years ago are now hovering near original MSRP. Latest motherboard releases from most major brands this past couple years have online price listing above MSRP. Only the weird off-brand oddball motherboards on Aliexpress and Wish are even remotely cheap and even those modified micro-itx platforms are price spiking all of a sudden.  It's as if the scalpers are back and just price gouging everything computer related.  Seriously, like WTF?  Scalpers suck. Period.
My latest Asus MB has USB 2.0 dropping out issues.  Thanks for the very frank video. I'll go with a different MB for my upcoming build.
Asus products have never stood out to me, im aware they are an option but never been tempted.
Respect. Asus is no longer super high quality but they nearly doubled their prices. Thanks for calling it!
When Asrock is more stabel then one of then the other you fd Up   Runnig a 10900kf with a 3080ti  with CPU on a 360 alphacool Radiator not comming over 65°C Gpu and 90°C Cpu at the same Time running full tilt  sadly the only game i can test is NFS Heat.  Drunk greetings from Germany
thanks Jay for the info.  I want to build another rig...now I think I'll wait...my current rig has an ASUS motherboard, but it's from 3 years ago. No problems so far. We need to know this stuff.
i sent a motherboard to ASUS for being dead i wish i took a picture of the cpu socket before i sent it they rejected the repair because of so called bent pins i never did.   i straighten out the pins when i got it back and of course the board is still dead also guess what its a requirement for me to put the cpu socket protector right well when i got the board back from them crooks it was missing if it wasnt for microcenters amazeing bundle deals i dont think ill ever buy another asus
yeah it lacks the fun too lacks the quality and fun which it was taken away from the consumer too.
Lenovo screwed a bunch of their customers over as well with their "Critical" bios update that they pushed through their driver install software "Vantage". Mine, the Lenovo Flex 5 idea pad, was bricked because of their faulty bios. I went online to see if anyone else bricked their laptop with the same bios and sure enough there was hundreds and hundreds of customers on their website complaining about the faulty bios that ruined their laptop. I called support and they told me my motherboard was bad. Really? Your bios broke my laptop. Long story short, I had to reflash my motherboard again and Lenovo took 0% responsibility. They told me to go the nearest best buy to get the mobo fixed. These companies don't care about us anymore. Good luck everyone!
I noticed this back in 2010.  Asus was my go to but over the years i was noticing more and more that quality was going downhill.  But the support was the kicker.    Support was more and more a minefield.  Now it sounds like they are purposefully setting you up to have no claim by giving you a landmine of a BIOS.  And how many people have gotten smash pins and they can't get warrantied?
I have a build with an ASUS board in it, and I cannot reboot the system because the fans will start going crazy and ramping up and down. They will continue to do this forever until I completely shut down the system and start it from scratch. I know it's a minor issue but it's very inconvenient and something like that just shouldn't happen with any "high quality" motherboard. I also have to builds with MSI boards and they are absolutely fantastic. I love them and I have zero issues with them. Based on this one, and only experience with ASUS I don't think I will ever buy another ASUS product, especially after seeing this video.
I might consider not getting an Asus ROG as my next laptop then
Asus needs to be firing people
I bought 1 Asus board 5 years ago and it was DOA with a bad BIOS chip, they wouldn't refund me so I have never bought another Asus Motherboard since.  I bought an Asus Gsynk Monitor about 4 years it still works but it's horrible Image. I now do not buy anything Asus, in the late 90's Asus was the best of the best, then they went bad for a few years, and again produced great products until a few years ago, now they are completely unreliable again.
I run with a ASUS X570 for my 5900x...  Looks like I might be going back to MSI again.
(Asus has left the chat)
I entirely agree with your position.
65 thousand likes and a million views, that’s a lot a potential customers gone
So you admit that you took money from companies whose hardware you were supposed to "review?" That isn't a BLATANT and EGREGIOUS conflict of interest?   That's the real story.
I always used and liked AsRock. Stable an reliable as hell with sometimes crazy features and solutions.
"FOR THOSE WHO DARE BUY ASUS"  I began boycotting Asus many years ago after buying a motherboard and it blew up after three months. A component on the board had burned up so I sent the board in for warranty. Asus denied the warranty, claiming "physical damage" after pointing out a 1/8" long slight scratch on the board, nowhere near the burned part nor any trace. It was on a blank part of the board, so it had no effect on the board at all.   Their email said the board was "unrepairable", but near the end of the email, they said they would repair it for $150. The board had cost $99.  I requested they tell me what part was burned so I could locate one and install it myself, but they refused to do this.  Asus is crap. I'm glad people are finally starting to realize this.
Please tell  me this is only about ASUS high end Stuff? I just bought a basic  budget ASUS Ryzen 3 -5300U laptop .  They did not bother fooling with those I hope?
been with msi for years ..... costly but stable
So you assembly hardware by its colors? Really?
back in 2003-4 when I was really doin g a lot of pc building and whatnot I was always reccommending asus because they had amazing customer service. Fast forward to 2014 ish and they shit all over me with a monitor and I always avoid them now.
THANK YOU!   I have had nothing but issues with Asus products and the support is more often than not rude and massively unhelpful. I stopped buying ASUS a few years ago and am never going back. So many better options out there.
Shih's getting old and the rot he's been trimming until now has been getting harder and harder to deal with probably.  With the Chinese being general assholes, they're seeing more and more unconditional support from Taiwanese people in recent years and it's all getting to their head.  They're probably going to just drop dead if they keep at it tbh. It's really not like we can't live without them even here in Taiwan
i gave up on Asus back in 2017 after repeated, back to back issues across multiple types of products
Irony is their CS is still stellar vs  their at one time "child" aka Asrock..  and Asrock is so bad they are one of the few I've personally blacklisted (along with many other IT pros)   Long story.. but short ver..  they tried at one time to pull an nvidia re control and dictating how reviews were both done and wanting veto power over the entire content..  and their CS being such absolute shit wher I ended up helping a customer whom had bought an asrock mb.. a whopping $80 part.. and it took over TWO YEARS to get them even a replacement for it with another model nevermind a refund or any thought of the hundreds of hours wasted by their employees..   beyond pathetic.   Asus I actually picked for mb in my newest personal sys after the  letdown of MSI with their x570 tomahawk..  good hardware wise overall but their CS was seriously lacking and their bending over to hel M$ with insane crap like needing winbloze store to even download proper drivers!!!   What sort of fucking bullshit is that??  Anyhow...  I'm hoping the asus mb I have with my 7800x3d I patiently waited for actually works out properly...   but only time will tell.  (and Jay..   email me!!  I need to swipe one of your parts pls!!!!)
You will never see UNBOX THERAPY DIS  a sponsor. You go JAY.
ASUS isn't the only company sending returns out as new. In the last couple of years I've gotten two items sold as new and when I received them they were obviously used. I don't remember what one was but the other was a well known brand of monitor which I have bought directly from Amazon Canada (not a store selling through them). Amazon wouldn't allow me to replace the monitor for some unknown reason, despite their website stating that monitors from Amazon are replaceable, and they wanted me to purchase the same monitor at a higher price without refunding me the difference. I returned the monitor and, though  I would have been happy replacing the monitor, I took the opportunity to buy the next level of monitor which was on sale somewhere else and have made many other purchases elsewhere since then.
I lost interest in Asus back in 2012/2013ish. Some of their stuff looks good on the surface but the longer you use it you find it's just glorified overhyped junk. (Same with a lot of other brands these days to be honest)
Asus has been drinking the Bud Light.
So this is only happening on ASUS boards?  I'm only asking, cause I don't know. Don't  beat me up tech dudes!
Jay I have an ASUS Tuf gaming Nvidia Geforce rtx 3060. Do you feel like it's something I should be concerned with having in my pc? It's about a month old
Welp, now I have to find a new board maker. Second is GPU of ASU’s does this with boards they might do it with that too.
ashame, because they used to be one of my go-to PC company, and now I prefer Corsair & Gigabyte styling and they havent done me wrong  P.S.  I think a lot of the reason is that ASUS high end boards just dont appeal to me as far as style, even before all this lack of quality stuff.  Like the ROG "GAMER" branding is very off-putting
10 years ago in my teens I bought an ASUS prebuilt. Nothing but headaches, contacted ASUS, it turned out the system I bought new had been RMA'ed before. This shit has been going on forever with ASUS.
Thanks for being a voice for the customer, Jay. Sorry to learn of your negative experiences with ASUS recently. You and your crew are amazing! You totally (AS)ROCK!!
Too many resources devoted to developing and shipping the Ally, and not enough resources devoted to their customers. Simple as that.
Sad to know this about ASUS. My very old WinXP build has an ASROCK MoBo. It ran PERFECTLY for many years. I guess my next MoBo (or any hardware, for that matter) will NOT be ASUS.
Thank you very much for being honest, I am sure this will help many people, me included..  I will return my ASUS b550 motherboard.. f…k em 😂
ive been a small-business and personal customer of Asus since the late 1990s. and sadly, especially in the last few years, i have seen a sharp decline in their support. 7 years ago, my friend need to warranty his RoG laptop. he had his replacement from Asus in 4 days. today, you dont even know if you'll get anything back. it's terrible. i dont know what brand to go after these days. MSI was super shady, gigabyte's support is also terrible, and asrock is still sort of MEH in the space. do gamers just need to get consoles instead, to show these companies they need to pull their heads out of their asses?
I don't own a giant PC worth $5000+. However.... I did buy an Asus ROG Strix about a year ago as it met the specs I needed for class. From my personally experience it's an absolute monster, and rivals lots of PC builds today. That said there have been some problems, such as one day the laptop just wouldn't start at all. But.... that may have been because of a faulty external hardrive as mine died not long after. But I've absolutely loved my laptop.
I have been using MSI for my new 7800X3D build and its been running really well.
Well done and thank you, you are speaking up for all us little guys (you know that actual customers who [used to] buy their products) I look at them this way, Quality Control sucks costing them money, offset that loss by 'accidentally' placing returned unserviceable product back on the out shelves, now it's the purchasers problem but they recoup some of their losses, get the rest back by cutting back on their customer support. If they fail in the future Asus have no-one but themselves to blame.
when you have so much money you can afford losing clients. im sure ASUS foreseen this right? yeah for sure
This is so deeply and refreshingly forthright, and also sad as hell.  Asus, for decades, has been the brand of pc hardware that I could count on for build quality and reliability over time.  Has anyone taken their place? Kudos to you, and am very grateful.
ho nooo.  i hope there 2023 rog tablet isn't effected. as ive just got one today
so what do you think about the rog ally??
It took you guys a minute.... 5 years ago my RAM blew up because "default" meant balls-to-the-wall-super-oc-off-a-cliff-voltages-what-the-actual ****?
ASUS is too big for its own good. They have transitioned to a 'brand only' model of business where marketing and image are all that matter and the product itself is very low on their list of priorities. Oh well.  Tip for 2023: make crap, go broke.
Thanks Jay
If Linus fired Asus too, it's the end for them 😅
Dear Valued Customer,  We sincerely do not apologize for the issue you are experiencing with our motherboards. We can assure you that this is the norm and the kind of quality to expect from ASUS products. We are happy to hear that the motherboard did not work as intended when you first received it. We do not stand behind our product and we continuously strive to produce defective products and processes in order to screw over our customers. Thank you for choosing ASUS.  Best Regards, ASUS Customer Loyalty US Support
I feel like a fool supporting this compnay for years and years. I even bought the Asus RTX 4090 Strix and Asus X670-E Hero Mainboard last year. Great prodcuts but the way they are acting is outrageous. Im scared for my 7800X3D since Im still using the older bios since the current BETA bios voids the warranty.
I've used basically only ASUS motherboards with the exception of one ASRock and one Gigabyte(sold that to a friend) since I've been building PC's. From Z77 to Z97 to Z370 to my current X570 board, they've always served me well. It's sad to see them fall from grace like this. At least for the consumers there are plenty of other high quality brands to choose from.
And all the AMD shills in the comments saying 1.4+ vcore on AM4 was normal.
This is why you don’t buy amd lol
It sounds like they've regressed to how they were at the end of the 90's, at least here in Oz. I worked in a PC shop back then and remember having problems with getting support from ASUS & Gigabyte. I've not bought or recommended a Gigabyte product since, I'd avoided ASUS too but they improved and then got a lot of positive sentiment from enthusiasts. Now it looks like they're throwing that all away because they've got too many marketers and bean counters. For a while now I've found their m/b pages annoying, you go looking for the specs and they're after pages and pages of pictures with talking points carrying on about all the good stuff they've got. Steve's found out that the bragged about special protection stuff doesn't protect the m/b or CPU! It makes me think they spent more money on the marketing than they did implementing the features they were bragging about.  If I get around to building a new system the m/b choice has been narrowed significantly, only Asrock or MSI remain! There might be another, I've not looked for a while now but the other options were low end options, Biostar comes to mind but I'm not even sure if they're still around.
It’s unfortunate
Jay, thanks for this video I had just bought an Asus Z670-A for a new build. I am returning it and looking for another MB that is quality and has all the ports, connection etc that this Asus has. You mentioned MSI is that you go to MB now ? can you give a suggestion on which brand I should look at?
Your last words were they don't care. I in fact think they will when there sales tank from good folks like you making the public aware of this shit. It won't happen over night but when they start seeing the bottom dollar start taking a dive they will start to care lol. Great job Jay kudos to you.
Shout out to AsRock! LoL all of my builds have been with AsRock mobos and yes they've all been troopers.
in may 2022 I bought an asrock phantom gaming rx6800. I hesitated because of the widespread asrock image. But I'm glad I bought it, it's an awesome card
I loved asus. My rampage 6 extreme 1st edition is still running like a champ with my 7900x i9. 64gb ram. After all these years I've had no problems. I guess if and when I ever decide to upgrade for now there isn't a reason to. I will go with msi or asrock. Thks for the video Jay. Been following you now for 8 years. Also great info. Thks for looking out for us consumers.
This video has been pretty highlighting - I have used Asus for years, but switched from Intel to AMD on my last build 2 years ago. I have those same audio issues sometimes and system stability issues occassionally despite rebuilding and doing full wipes and clean re-installs multiple times and most annoyingly - despite ensuring compatability, power requirements, plenty of temp headroom, memory clock speeds etc etc, I cannot even activating XMP profile on my RAM (cannot remember the AMD term for it right now) or manually overclock to less than my XMP frequency without getting consistant BSOD all the time.  Not going to lie, I had used ASUS for many years and honestly, after trying to investigate and solve the issue by checking all the hardware etc and even rtrying another motherboard - and looking online for others suggestions and feedback, I saw people saying they had the same or similar issues on AMD builds and so I blamed the AMD and swore I was going back to Intel next... but now I am wondering if it is the Asus motherboard
I was thinking of doing a recent new build with Asus. Thanks for the heads-up. I have been using ASRock for a while now. Am sticking to it.
I bought 2 asus laptops, neither of them worked very well so I hardly ever used them, and all of the plastic on both simply self-disintegrated exactly 1 year and a few days after I bought them. That is when I decided to never buy Asus again.
The decision to put the disclaimer of "warranty void" 100% came from higher up in the management who only cares about money and not from the actual engineers. This teaches them a lesson.
ok so Asus Gigabyte MSI boycott, hmm we don't have a lot of choice left
I remember my z-390 e build and the endless rabbit hole of errors regarding basic audio functions. Feels like this problem has been slowly brewing and finally ready to erupt.
Supply a vendor certified BIOS update and then stick a label on its description "will void warranty if installed" is a huge red flag here in Europe and will be challenged legally.
ASUS RMA experience has been awful for a decade. This nightmare was inevitable with their decline.
What are you waiting for? Stop this video and go buy something whether it be AMD or Asus NOW!
Just can't imagine "how much" this is going to cost ASUS. 😮..., I have just been looking at upgrading my PC, even though I can't really afford to, I "was" going to go with the ASUS "crosshair" board again..., not now.
My Rog is  now refusing my 3080 each time i had to downgrade  gpu after a fresh install of windows. , personally im so done with it after a bunch of research . Thanks asus for maliciously  bricking my mobo for no ffin reason. indeed im done as well . They can stuff this where the sun doesn't shine.
This sucks to hear. Was hoping the ROG team was getting better. With the release of ROG phones, Ally, Harpe Ace, and Azoth I thought QC would have been improved cuz those products seem great. Won't be buying from them again in the near future.
Thanks for this video. I'll skip ASUS from now on until this has been long solved. BTW, I have exclusively bought ASUS motherboards when at all possible for the last 15 years.
My experience was lock tight on the m.2 heat sink and cheap screws so cheap they stripped the head   I asked asus if they could send replacement screw just the screws nothing else   They demanded the full board back with a estimated timeframe of 6-8 weeks   For two screws!!
i have had issues with asus for years, i wont touch them
Puchased an Asus Z77 Sabretooth back 11 years ago. Dead out of the box. Sent it back to where I purchased it from. They sent it to Asus who blamed it on a bent pin on the socket. I checked the socket with a high power magnifier - damned if i could see any bent pins before i sent it back. Store thought it was a memory controller problem. Asus charged the store $50 to 'fix it'. Store picked up the tab as they thought it was a bullshit excuse. That board is still ticking along though 11 years later and never missed a beat.
Gone are the days when you could just plug stuff in your build without testing each part separately, and the PC will just work flawlessly. 😞
Unbelievable ASUS, unacceptable. Thanks Jay.
Used to buy pretty much exclusively Asus mb's for years, now I will look else where for my next build.
1) Fuck the clickbait. I don't watch you because of it. But this video being about Asus is the exception.  2) Asus has had this same MO when it comes to lack of end user support for over 15 years now. I could give anecdotes as I'm sure many could. The only surprise here is to see them becoming so complacent that it now affects sponsored / influencer related parts as well.
im so glad asus finally got caught up harddd with bigger sources able to make a talk about it. rma experiance is horrible i work in a tech job building pc's they have declined and i dont even have our shop  get asus products for now until they get thier quality and shit together
Happy rocking my ASUS B550M Wifi II mobo and my ASUS Strix XG35VQ monitor, had asus mobos for decades now. 🙂 Sad to see they going down hill 😞
Lol. Jay dogging Asus I never thought I'd see the day
These ASUS Boards are worse in retail state than the ASRock Dual Combo DDR2+DDR3 Boards ever has been with beta bios.
send me all your asus stuff
I'm curious what ASUS has to say after hearing this.
Fired up my live stream and this happened *genshin impact add and a tic toc add*
Thank you so much for doing this video. ASRock will be my go to brand from now on.
Dear ASUS: It isn't me; it's you.
SO, I'm wanting to build my new gaming rig using the 7800x3d.  Are there ANY good motherboards right now that WILL play nice with this CPU?!
I was going to buy an x570 plus but after watching this...🤔what's my next best option?
Maybe Asus is getting rid of you
With Asus crapping out, could AMD please ask EVGA to take over ASUS's spot as mobo builder?
Sounds like they're experiencing financial woes which leads to customer service issues and a decline in quality.
For no reason other than that I wanted a change,, I just got an MSI MEG Z790 ACE. What a lucky accident. I was going to get an Asus.
There was already RAM issues with the X5xx series, you guys just BLEW us ALL off on this info, and then we're not even talking about the USB 3.0< problem with noise in the (later than 3.0) USB ports ! but yeah my X570 with 3600 Mhz RAM, got me banned for cheating ! last time I used a "trainer" was in BUBBLE BOBBLE !!  I love you descripe problems that COULD RELATE TO A NOISY USB on top !! just got a bit FURTHER into the video !!
There is always going to be problems that pop up... No one can test or plan for every possible scenario and or configuration... It's how a company responds to those issues that makes or breaks the end user confidence, in that brand. For example, the plastic around hinges on my MSI Raider laptop cracked... MSI offered to replace the laptop (for free), if I sent it back to them... I wasn't in a location that would allow me to send them my laptop... SO I took it upon myself to order the replacement parts and fix the laptop myself... MSI's reply was basically "we are sorry that we can't give you those parts for free, but if you ever want to return the laptop to us we will still replace it, even after you have fixed it yourself"... I will continue to to buy MSI products. Not because they are they best... BUT when I wanted to do something a certain way, they were still willing to stand behind their product and still honor their original offer. That kind of response goes a long way towards confidence in a brand.
I hope all influencers do this! My concern with MSI is their recent data breach.
biasness ethics. Enough said
I stopped using Asus nearly 10 years ago, sadly after they split from Pegatron the quality of the products and service has steadily declined.
LOL you change to MSI just as MSI had a big data breach and some of their secret codes to sign official software updates for BIOS and companion apps are out there public.  Be careful with your what you are installing on those MSI MoBos
The only thing from Asus I still buy are their routers, and even they doesn't work great with default firmware so I have to use Merlin modified firmware to fix damn WiFi connection drops. Their quality dropped like 12 years ago. I can't believe people still consider their garbage as premium products.
Lol ok well keep unsupporting more companies and you'll have no more sponsors and no more hardware to make builds. Remember Gigabyte power supplies catching fire?
I have a Ryzen 9 7950x3d and crosshair hero and my system keeps shutting down, do you have any advice for a fix?
Good for Jay to hold tight to his integrity.  Weren’t they hiring Jay for promotion? Wouldn’t that make ASUS the employer? I’ve never heard of someone firing their employer. Quitting yes, but not firing. The title and declaration at the start was strange to me.
I bought the x570 crosshair impact when it first came out (most I have ever spent on a motherboard) and there was an issue with the sodimm board where any m.2 ssd I put it would warp. It was clearly a engineering defect. I went back and forth with asus for weeks and at the end their answer was simply nothing we can do for you.
As you listed all the issues you were having, I'm going like, I have those issues too, all of them, though not all at once. My system works, I look at it as if it has quirks, and I have to live with them until I can figure out which brand to move to for my next build.  MSI, Gigabyte, or AsRock and Intel or AMD.  This was a fantastic video, by the way.
I got an MSI ACE MEG 670x and I love it
Il have 1 if you don't want them
i have an ASUS motheboard, and recently the USB 3.2x2 cable stopped working after a restart of the machine for no reason at all, i have tried everything to fix it, but it doesn't, this is one is the ROG Crosshair VIII DARK HERO motherboard.
That’s why i chose MSI
Is anyone seeing a trend here? Companies are willfully tanking themselves. It just seems like if you're a large, public company in 2023 a grenade bouquet must be swallowed. It's not just Beer or Disney either, it's everyone. Are they doing it on purpose? Who is asking them to do so and why?
I left Asus in 2019 for just these issues and I'm surprised you haven't faced these more. If you bought your own hardware you'd get what we're seeing and have a better outlook along with us.  It's almost as if they've been hand picking parts to send to you reviewers in order to show perfect quality and then when it's not you receive great support....and they even stopped doing that.  Well, we don't have that privilege and Asus has been kicking out much lower quality since I moved over to them when Abit went away.  A $500 board that simply doesn't work eventually gets a BIOS sent after a lot of back and forth, then the last contact was something like, "You installed the BIOS incorrectly. We'll consider this support ticket closed". I'm an engineer. I worked at 3dfx, Intel, and AMD designing...I kinda got the idea of flashing a BIOS. Anyway, done. All Gigabyte now and the more you poke around with their power delivery, I really get impressed with them still not cutting corners and having true designed layouts to meet what is said on the box. Any and all over volting is an option and clearly stated prior to selecting a profile or setting and have just been rock solid platforms to trust. How's their tech support? Dunno, never had a single issue to bother.
Well done Jay nice to see someone with ballz
computer hardware companies need to focus more on making low end and middle end hardware as high end isn't in a good spot and their just wasting resources and putting garbage product on the market
I love Jay's overviews and videos where he delivers pretty honest and trutful opinion he has - very professional! I personally NEVER had issues with Asus, and my gaming rigs are always on ASUS mobo, ASUS GPU, Monitors, in general - really really good quality and satisfaction. However, I never had to really contact support because everything worked just fine. Fine print: last time I bought something branded ASUS was about 18-20 months ago :)
I feel not just there software support butt their customer support has been bad as well. Not sure about other parts of the world, but here in India, their service has given me so many issues. I bought an ROG Strix laptop and then it starting giving weird noise and vibration issues in a few months but when I contacted Asus support they said my device is out of warranty even when I provided them with the amazon invoice clearing stating my device is within warranty and they even updated the registered products portal stating my device was out of warranty and it was very discouraging as a customer especially since there was nothing I could do apart from providing bills and invoices which they were not considering. Later after lots of back and forth, the issue escalated to the regional head. Yes, regional head for a simple service issue and finally my device was serviced. Now after some time one of my fans starting giving issues and I took the device to the service centre where they kept pushing to replace both the fans even when the issue was only present in one fan. Crazy thing is I had assigned the pcie of gpu to virtual machine which I was not using meaning my other fan(gpu one: the one working fine) fan was not even in use and I did all the changes to check the fan n the service centre itself and left my device for service but after I received my device back, my gpu fan, which was working fine earlier, was having noise and vibration issues. I raised a ticket explaining the issue but it was never resolved my asus customer support and I had to play for replacement and service charge again for a mistake they did. Worst part is, Asus actually makes good products and it is very hard to avoid such a big name, especially in markets like India where there are not a lot of options.
I'm having problems with sound crackling and snapping and failing  should i go back to original bios i have upgraded bios as they came out  my Maximus Extreme mb  also has the digital cpu temp ect. over the m.2 and its now upside down graphics so weird
I have a z490 e-gaming, no issues so far, what is the issues that have been going around?
Cancel ASUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great video.  Thanks for taking the time to make it.
i really like MSI they are the best brand imo. never had a problem with my gaming labtop. it works like a pc and runs better than a console. clean everything nothing but a positive experience thus far and i dont see myself going to any other brand in the future ^ ^
I remember the backwards Capacitor fiasco. My older Z-590 board works fine. Seems like the newer boards are where the problems lie. I guess there QC department is on vacation since last few years
Your review has sold me! I now own my last Asus Motherboard! There will be no more! Thank you for a thorough, honest review! 👍
Ive seen some nightmare stories about their RMAs on reddit. Brand new laptops that get sent back 3 times because of a bad usb, all screws stripped, bent frames, just a nightmare customer support because of out sourcing. They used to be my top pick but after hearing that I cant support em now.
Good to know upgrading from my rog b550 board to a newer model from them wouldn't solve the problems I've been having. Wonderful.
I Like the  ... "keep yer *STUFF* " ...  dubbed over
Bravo!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Asrock has always better stable performance. asus boards have always been bitchy.
I work in Tech for a MSP. Vendors need to learn that loyalty and good customer service/SLA's are what people need when things fail, no ones is asking for perfection but just ownership of their products. My job has literally evolved to helping companies avoid pitfalls created by overcomplex solutions. I'm really hoping the next 10 years we will see a revolution of consumer rights.
ASRock rocks, f*ck Asus
... you jnow what is sad.. I spend 2 year saving to build a pc gamer...and i was going with the full red 3DX team build  and asus morther bord  but decided to change to green and blue build up in the last minute.. so last month I bought my parts.... with a asus motherboard .... so i''m not sure if i'm glad that I took just half of the bullets .. or be sad because that I took the worst bullets .... so i'm just sad....
ASUS is going to end up with a class action lawsuit at this rate. Its one thing to not stand behind your product, its another to actively mislead your customers into harmful situations.
Asus still has good tech, so I can't help it.
I use to be one those guys who only bought rog stirx components at a ridiculous markup and I use to be the biggest hater on gigabyte but they have made so many improvements that I won’t touch asus or rog products because for the money I believe they went super down hill starting the 30s cards.
ur just having a bad day, tomorrow youll regret you choices XD plus   STOP BUYING THINGS THAT JUST come out,  give products time for people to find the bugs and issues  its not going to be perfect when u buy the latest thing,  no ssuch thing as perfect actually
Lmaoooo
I have always found Asus hardware to always be ropey, but hey if you want to give any of that gear away I would be happy to take it off your hands.
Im still sticking with intel, i just cant trust AMD or AMD manufacturers to not shit the bed at this point
I experienced the same issue with an MSI board. I am pretty sure that either the PSU/CPU/motherboard manufacturers are cutting corners to "save money". I literally cannot overclock ram that is rated for HIGHER than the xmp profile I am trying to set it to. 2400 and staying on 2400 because I dislike having to deal with crashes.
Thanks foir sticking up for everyone on this!
I don't get your propblem. Bios without enough training wheels allows users to overclock the cpu to self destruction. Asus fixed the problem in a timely manner when they got word of it. Do you want a Beta-bios with a copypasta disclaimer (sponsored by Asus legal) or wait another 6 weeks for the full release? There is no proof that Asus has voided anyone's warranty. Steve from GN exploits the living !"§$ out of this for clickbait.  ASRock and Asus are the same company. Asus bought Asrock 20 years ago. The mainboards are all made by Pegatron anyway. Asus charges you $50 more for rgb
Thank you Jay, for standing with the community!
My ASUS TUF x570 board couldn't handle RAM kits at XMP settings (I had to loosen the timings by 10-20% to avoid bluescreens and even then it wouldn't boot sometimes).  I returned 2 RAM kits thinking it couldn't have been my ASUS board, but sure enough it was a subpar memory controller.   This generation with an x670e TUF board and a 7900x my computer with normal CPU and EXPO settings would suddenly cut power as if there were a surge or spark.  I ruled out the PSU by swapping it, and ruled out a short circuit by rebuilding the whole thing.  I found that the only way I can keep it stable is with the CPU set to eco mode and Expo turned off.  Sucks major balls but at least I know the reason now.  Partially my fault for trusting ASUS and believing my last gen board was just a lemon.
I stopped buying ASUS, which was my favorite brand, several years ago. Had problems with memory on a ASUS board and wrote them. Detailing everything I had tried. I got a "Have you tried rebooting" reply after 3 weeks. From then on I haven't used them. Mostly opting for MSI, their customer support is quick to reply, haven't had RMA need on any of their products yet. Next AM5 build will be MSI as well I think
Asus service sucks big time! Apperciate you calling out Asus.
I think people are blowing this up to a histrionic disorder level.   Yes, what Asus did was scummy with the warranty but did anyone else discover these issues prior on their own? Doubt it! So it's a herd mentality at this point. Asus will eventually go back and honor their warranty eventually.   I remember when people were ragging on asrock and now everyone is "flocking back" to them. You guys are the most disgusting and unstable community I've ever come across!  Stick with a brand that works for you regardless! Asus has been good with their service up until now, but does it mean I am going to get rid of my Asus routers that are the most capable and functional than any other brand I've come across for years? Hell, my ac1900 with merlin still works as test equipment since 2014! Also, my hero for my 10900k and strix for 9700k along with z270 prime with 0 problems since day 1!  Asus and its issues are AMD specific because amd cpus are trash and unreliable, but you dumb lemmings keep going back to amd! AMD is more responsible for this mess before its vendors or manufacturers. I wouldn't be surprised if Asus stopped producing boards for the AMD platform, and then everyone will be crying for them to come back like the "good ol days" .  If you want to stick to your so called moral code by not supporting asus then go ahead by all means! But i doubt you will just toss or throw your expensive asus router or intel asus platform in the trash as well. Don't forget to toss your asus monitors while at it too!  I guess people forgot that Asus is in the business to make money, and by partnering up with a crappy cpu platform that's plagued with its own issues was their biggest downfall.   Not defending asus, but come on! Be realistic! Does one bad product means all their products are garbage now? Yikes! SJW much?!
ASRock has treated me amazingly for two generations
My Asrock mobo has been solid for quite a few years now.. The only "complaint" I have is that it doesn't have that much slots for mem or cards... (but that's not really a problem and I knew that when I bought the thing)
So glad I went with MSI for my 7800x3d lol, F asus
Remember when programmed obsolescence was a thing? Today's fad is induced failure!
ive been saying this for a few years now.   asus sucks, and stopped using their products 5 years ago
I have had an x570 tuff with a Tuff GPU for a bit over a year. It's been great so far but this scares me.
I won't pretend that I have any basis for saying MSI is a better company or makes better boards.  But for me, I've never had an issue.  So when picking hardware, if it is between someone else and MSI, I generally just pick the MSI.  My current build with a Z690 Edge and Gaming Trio Z 6800 XT has been perfect for me.
Proud owner of the Taichi x570. Beast of a motherboard, really happy with it.
Thank you for this video, Jay. It lets me know I'm not alone in the HELL I've experienced to get my BRAND new 4090 replaced by Asus. They sent me a damaged card that looks like it came straight out of a mining rig and was dropped and stepped on right before they shipped it to me, and it has the same issue the original one did.  Two thousand fu**ing dollar GPU is defective and they REFUSE to replace it with a new one. I will never touch anything they make ever again, and would encourage anyone that sees this not to as well, if you care about having any sort of support when your computer hard crashes anytime you try to use your $2k GPU to game.
Looks over at my ASRock B550 Taichi-based system: "We're good, right?" "I got you, dude." 😉
And I just pre-ordered a ROG Ally too 😳
Man , crazy to hear all of this. I’ve always used Asus motherboards.. will try another brand for my next build, what’s the best recommended brand now?
ASUS:  To prevent our faulty  board from blowing up and destroying everything, you need to install this new BIOS. Also ASUS:  If you install the new BIOS and it blows up up your PC, it is entirely your fault.
skip the annoying music
Jay’s consistent goal is to inform the consumer when companies (and other content articles/videos) won’t. Thanks for always having our back and calling out the BS that continues in this industry
Damn should i swap out my x670e e gaming wifi board now? Was planning to jump to an x3d chip
had an asus mobo for 10 years was going to build another pc with an asus mobo but maybe not now.
I've been using am asrock Taichi x470 for years now and it is the most stable motherboard I've had in years. Also been hating Asus for years. Even the boards I havve are not faultless.
Damnit, i used to be an asus fanboy....
Thanks for this. Started looking at MSI & others just because Asus is ridiculously $$$. After 4 strait times I built w asus. Now switching!
u lose what lil pull or your voice u had when u divorce yourself from working w/ them. just continue fighting for the consumer, put pressure on asus to do better. but now they'll disregard anything u say.
Thanks for bringing it up. I suppose that takes some balls calling out ASUS.
damn this is all hard to take man both my mobo and graphics card are asus
I'm so happy to hear good things about ASRock because I got their Sonic mobo and I was worried.
REKT.
You are a hero Jay! That honesty , and the fact you guys care so much for us consumers are worth more then ANY sponsor ;)
When there’s nothing wrong, every YouTubers/influencers accepts product and sing their praises. As soon as something went south, immediately they start stoning the brand. Why? Because as a brand themself, they don’t want to be associated with any brands that’s is ‘anti consumer’. What I’m trying to say is these are the same people that ‘worked’ together with those brands to promote their products. They are doing this now is because they don’t want to loose their credibility with their viewers. Think about this the next time anyone decides to buy any stuff because of these YouTubers/influencers recommendations/advice.
i know these issues. i hate that random disconnects
ROG Asus PG42UQ OLED firmware has been having issues since Launch.  The last update they did for the PG42UQ firmware was in November 2022.  The colors and color saturation in HDR is broken.  I run a website that hosts a settings page on getting the colors right.  It involves a lot of tweaks and steps.  Pretty ridiculous for a $1399 monitor from a "Premier brand" like ROG Swift Asus.  Also, there are issues with the monitor "wake up" since day 1.  The firmware updates still haven't completely resolved these problems.  Here we are still waiting for a proper firmware release a half a year later.  Needless to say Jay, I am not surprised you dropped them as a sponsor and, I applaud you for sticking up for the consumer.
I have a bunch of Asus products, B550-E motherboard, Rog Strix Animate II keyboard, Strix Pugio mouse, RTX 3070 TI card and all of them are working without problem. :( I totally understand Jay's point however. Maybe it's because we receive different supplies in Europe and US received another one too with different quality, which s*cks. :(
Wow, This sounds like an upper management issue. All the way up to the top. Dammm  ASUS!. Jay, I almost feel the same way about MSI, because their RMA support is non-existent. I got no response at all about an RMA on a new Tomahawk B450 board that bricked itself during a BIOS upgrade to use a 3700X Ryzen chip .  I bit the bullet and purchased a newer B550 Tomahawk  which I'm still using with no issues.
Jay talked about Asus again and got the most views out of all his weak videos...lol me ake fake news..i never have issue witn Asus motherboard. Sound like Asus never hire Jay ..haha salty lol
What’s your opinion about the mobile phone side of Asus please ?
I've been a loyal Asus customer for over 20 years. My latest build used all Asus parts - ROG Strix case, Rog Strix power supply, etc. But, after recently having issues with an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero MB I decided to switch to a Gigabyte Z790 Master and it's been running perfect.
Anybody see that ASUS tried to bribe KitGuru to do positive reviews?
I use to only buy ASUS ROG motherboards until I had to many failures without warning! PS I'm not a gamer but wanted a high end product & I did not over clock any of them!
Ass-us
Respect
Nice!
I stopped buying asus when I got a 750$ screen from them when I turned 18, it broke down 3 times in 2 years and the last time they refused to fix it.
Well damn. I have been building PCs again since around 2013 and was about to purchase a whole bunch of parts for a new build. After exhaustive research on your channel, LTT, Paul's Hardware, etc., for me the defaults were Fractal Define cases, Asus motherboards, GSkill RAM, EVGA GCs and power supplies. Now that's turned upside down. Perfect opportunity for you to make some build videos showcasing alternate parts on the low, medium, and high end with both AMD and Intel platforms. Preferrably using AMD GCs since Nvidia are c*cks as well.
Do not release any software if you will not keep your warranty promises..That is a dick move...08:50 WTF!!! imagine the average consumer experience then! so wth is left..Im writting this on a very old high end ASUS laptop that has been a awesome and probably the best computer I have ever bought so far..but looking at this gross incompetence I'm reconsidering buying new products if it is this crappy now.
What's up with Gamers Nexus they rarely posting content these days ?
I just got asus x570 motherboard like a few months ago… what’s a better x570 motherboard for R9 5900x in this case then?
Rip that explains why my Ethernet port never really worked on a board without integrated wifi. Had to get one shipped…
I got the Asus X670E-Pro Wifi with a Ryzen 9 7900x back in Dec '22 and knock on wood everything seems to be working. I'm still using the bios that came installed and I'm very reluctant to update to the latest bios.
Yeah, now I will feel that *avoid this brand name at any cost* everytime I see ASUS while shopping for anything.
I use almost everything from msi.... for no particular reason... i just never had any problems... Had the Asus ROG Strix Arion S500 ... nice idea... broke, without beeing moved after tree weeks.... it was plugged in, and used daily... the m.2 ssd showed to be okay, just that case just stopped working... 80 bucks for that shi*....
i wonder if the weird issues im encountering has anything to do with my asus prime x-570 pro board and not the 5700G that im running... i have to restart my system probably 2 or 3 times every morning just to get it to load stable. also, i experience crashing tabs often, as well as loading up games. if i load up satisfactory, and it crashes once, i have to restart the pc otherwise it will just keep crashing. sometimes when the pc boots, it will also have dll errors. it took me like 2 months to get everything to stop bluescreening and crashing constantly. but now im running into stability issues on bootup. sometimes the welcome screen will pop up, then fade to black instead of the desktop wallpaper, then pop up the welcome screen again, and back to black until i restart it... i was thinking the issue was the cpu, but maybe ill just swap out to some other board... i just really wish i could find a nice white board to replace this one...
After seeing this i only think how lucky i am with my z690 hero board to dont have any problem since i bought it 4 months ago, i love asus but i am 100% with Jay in this matter
No more Asus MoBo's from me. It takes a lot to upset Jay, so when he doesn't like Asus anymore, that means Asus is officially garbage tier. Next MoBo = ASRock.
Gets free stuff worth $100s if not $1000s, complains that its not brand new mint condition. Talk about an over-inflated sense of entitlement.
Love their new azoth keyboard but my new mobo from them has been less than great.
Pretty sure Jay said he was going to AM5 because it was way more stable then 13th gen Intel 😁😁😁
This is sad. I have an Asus ROG G750GW laptop, I've used it for 8 and a half years only recently replaced, and it still works like a charm.  This laptop is so old the GTX 765m GPU is replaceable! You open it up and remove it like any card. The fact that it lasted so long speaks to the quality of the product.  It's sad to see Asus has lost that.
back to Msi
Its time like these i am glad i did not upgrade my PC.
Good on you for speaking out.
Thank you for this video!
I had preordered the ROG ally but now I’m worried I think imma cancel and just wait a year see how others experiences go with it
I was going to be getting another ROG board for my next upgrade, but with their behaviour and how you're saying that the ASRock board has been solid, I'll be going ASRock, even though I prefer the aesthetics of the ROG board. They need to understand it's how they go about fixing issues that crop up that can either raise them up or topple their tower of Jenga. This could be the start of a collapse for Asus/ROG.
Damm asus is my favorite brand!
All the software issues you described is exactly why I switched fully to Mac eventually many years ago. It was insane how many problems and errors and software failures etc etc etc both OS and software wise and I couldn’t help but notice I never had ANY of that shit with apple and didn’t feel like finding what hardware was compatible with what etc etc
Goodbye Asus.
I have had a major issue with mine for months and ASUS refuses to help me!
I've run two Asus boards back to back in my personal rigs. Been very happy. Now though, this is not great news, and I doubt my next build will be.
To be fair, it's a typical boilerplate warning for all beta bios updates. It's just that they didn't take the context into account, so it looks really bad.
I've used a total of two ASUS motherboards in the last 8 years. The first one I bought back in 2015... Its still in use to this day in my gf's rig. Zero issues for 8 years. Seeing ASUS's decline is truly sad.
what a title
Asus should be pronounced "As Us". 😂
I'm glad somebody is saying they're done with ASUS. They're complacent and arrogant
GIGABITE is the king ASUS is crap after 2001 i was haveing problems with motherbords all way crap capasitors and all im talking from win 95 with p133 till now that i have for 10 years a GIGABITE Z77 socet 1155 10 yearsssssssssss
I'm sure China is devastated.
Had the worst RMA with Asus a few years back. It took them over 6 months for them to make it right and that was only because they got in trouble with my states Attorney General. Ever since then I have lost all respect for them and barely any influencers call them out on there anti consumerism. Thank you for being one of the few.
That's alot of products that need coverage might have given someone a channel opportunity
I don't think they realize that as the pc gaming community were very tight nit and if we wanna make em fail as a company we definitely have the power to do so. Let's squeeze em for a year or two by not buying their products and see how they like those quarterly reports lol should change their attitude about customer support pretty fast.
I had to change my build to msi stuck with my ASUS GPU because my 90 day return window closed while I was waiting for the bios on the board.
I have not seen Steve's videos in a long time. He makes very informative content, but with the way I use YouTube, his content is just not for me.
I'm not buying Asus anymore after all this. I go for msi of asrock for instance now.
I always go MSI or Gigabyte... Every time I "weeelll lets have a look, myabe its aight" asus buy like I did the other day with a headset, I get screwed over... whatever has Asus or Rog or anything with them only cuased headaches for me, let it be AMD or Intel system...
I know damn well. You said keep your shit. XD I can hear that dub.
All the problems that are mentioned seem to be a problem of bad management. If it were only BIOS problems, or only customer services, ... but all of this stuff at the same time.  Well had an ASUS board 23 years ago. Can't add anything to the discussion. Today I've a Gigabyte motherboard. But I am no power user and don't take a look too much into some stuff people care about nowadays.
Looks like ASUS is run by people seeking short-term maximums, only to screw over its lower level employees and customers.
Without EVGA and ASUS, I dont know where to go with my next build, MSI I guess :S
Asus was one of my go to but not anymore. Do I need to replace my X570E gaming or is it ok for now?
If the update to this new bios voids the warranty and there is still a risk of damaging the motherboard or CPU, better stick with an older bios and don't risk your warranty. Use the save settings, wait for a "stable" release of a new bios. And if it fails and breaks: use your warranty. And if the CPU also breaks: let them pay for a new CPU as well. And if they are not able to deliver a functioning product: get your money back. Just hold them responsible for their work.
This may just be coincidental, but I genuinely think your streaming problems are from the ASUS mobo. My intel x Asus z390 Prime mobo had the most issues launching and maintaining a connection with wave link as well as with other peripherals just dropping out of nowhere. I've since switched to AMD on a MSI motherboard and have never had a single issue with any of my audio devices or USB devices dropping or having any issues. My Quest Link would also have issues connecting to my Asus system, had to do a weird disconnect and reconnect ritual to get it to connect when it wanted to be difficult, since I've been on the MSI x AMD setup, haven't had the issue at all.
Although this is asus' fault, amd screwed up. It was always like this and it will always be like that. intel should be preferred for stability and long-lasting use.
how my asus laptop failed within a year and i never went back to that shitty brand how nice they may look..
I hated Asus for the last 15+ years, but this is first time in 15 years I took the risk and bought Asus RTX 4090 ROG Strix (crossing flinger). Recently (discovered last month) Zotac has been added to my hate list. They have the shittiest cheap quality fans & support services.
this is the FirstBuild I've done.  amd 7600 cpu, asrock RX7900 XT, asus prime b650m a-ax mobo, G.skill neo 5600mhz Ram (2x16gb) I was getting blue screens and sometimes it wouldn't even POST. I changed EXPO timing to 5200mhz. Never had a problem after that. I went to AMD  website and max memory speed is 5200mhz.  I hope this helps.
I waited and saved for 4 years to build my new rig…one month after my build I learn this about ASUS. :( gotta save up  again and get another motherboard now.
sounds like they created this bios to get out of having to replace the boards.
OMG my system is behaving like yours!   It’s an ASUS Impact VIII and I have the same odd issues with the audio/keyboard/mic randomly disconnecting.
These companies and quality control these days. Im not sure but they might be gearing up for a lawsuit because some states have laws protecting the consumer.
I have only used intel CPU’s in all of my builds. When I get a customer and they tell me that they want a AMD cpu all I do is tell them that there have been more problems with amd vs intel they have always went to intel and if you have a intel cpu and at the end of the numbers is a k I tell them that means if your gpu was to stop working for any reason you can plug the HDMI cable in to the back of the motherboard and you can keep playing your games until you can get your self another gpu and yes I tell them that the intel cpu will not be as good with graphics vs the gpu but at least you can still keep playing your games till you buy another gpu. And I have been building gaming desktop computer’s for 15+ years and I haven’t had a customer come back to me because their intel cpu burned out because I always recommend a aio liquid cooler and depending on how much they need in order to play their games I will recommend a push pull aio or the 2 or 3 fan aio loop. That way their cpu will not over heat.
I won't buy an ASUS board if i end up upgrading to AM5... probably will skip AM5 at this rate with all the problems.
I fucked off asus when I had my 1st i5 1155 board when they wouldn’t uphold there warranty after 2 boards from them just stopped working after 10 months of none overclocking use as I don’t overclock been using asrock ever since
Cancelled my ally preorder
Complains about free stuff...entitled much? You get free stuff, can call up and get replacements immediately, and still complain. Steve is out front of all this, you give him almost no credit, just wow.
i feel the same , my last build was amd /asus and i feel disappointed ! asus is a money grabing corp .. i feel more stability on a asrock board and snapier response
I miss EVGA for gpu's. I'm wary of buying a 40 series RTX card and having to lean towards ASUS
great so i have a rog strix mobo sat there waiting to be built... granted its an lga 1700 s...... but still :(
thank you for the honesty! I had so much good to say about ASUS untill I used the mobo from them and I actually hate the armoury crate software since day one :')
Is this BIOS problem just for the X670E or for all the ASUS motherboards with the M5 socket?
So I've been an ASUS fanboy for decades, and I have noticed the decline in quality and support... would you agree MSI is the best manufacturer, now that ASUS is failing us?
I have a z590 maximum hero board. I got an update for the board. After completing the update, the salt ram stopped. I tried to search for a fix, but I didn't find anything. I contacted Asus support, and they told me that the board had a problem, but hardware.
My Asus AM5 build had some hickups, but that was because of some faulty ram. Now it runs great, but the BIOS revisions and the software support just suck so much, along with the shady customer "service" I don't think I'll buy Asus again in the near future. Manually set my VSOC to 1.2V, so I don't slowcook my 7900X, because I'm not downloading their "beta" bios.
I am so happy with my r5 3600 and 2070s. It still goes strong and this new stuff is apparently being made with even lower standards.
ASUS product support is truly terrible.. Compared to other motherboard manufacturers for example on the AM5 platform, they were the last to push out latest AGESA updates.. Stil didn't update my B650 TUF because the latest BIOS version is always in Beta.
I wonder did gamers nexus get the board before you and left it unopened ?
It’s a shame cause asus mother boards were my absolute favorite.
I just dropped everything Asus from my parts order. If the customer handling improves only after publicity, a company can go F itself. F your investors and double F the stock holders! It’s about the customers.
This couldn't have happened to a more deserving company. ASUS has completely lost the plot.  I was recently burned by them when an approved BIOS update rendered my z690 an unstable mess. Did I mention there was no roll back from this new BIOS version and that this limitation wasn't mentioned in the release notes? Warranty service was denied due to a couple of tiny cosmetic scratches around a screw hole for the cpu cooler.  It's like BMW declining a warranty repair on your engine because you scratched the paint work on the bumper.
Amen!
Damn my asrock board has been rock solid. Lol
ASUS - your done. that is unbelievalbe, giving a bios to people, saying it's in beta and if you use it it's your proplem dumbass I will never, in my Life buy an ASUS Product again - i regret the 580$ for my Crosshair VIII Dark Hero for my Ryzen 9 5900X and as soon as I am upgrading, i am going to MSI, Gigabyte or ASRock
I'd wondered if this related to your own issues. That ASUS allowed QC to fall apart was bad, but their response to it--I'll be surprised if no consumer protection agencies get involved.  Much as I've really enjoyed ASUS over the years, I'm glad you're taking this stand.
My ASUS RTX 2080 ti Strix has been good and would have considered products from them in the future but after this motherboard fiasco as well as how they handled it, I will not be considering them in the future at this point.
asus has gone ROGUE.. be carefull folks
So... What brand is good for gaming laptops?
MSi for life
X670e carbon has been 100% stable with expo, an aggressive manual memory oc, and a negative per core CO
You could say it's A SUS brand
Funny, all the issues you had with the streaming computer i have on my Z690-I as if late…
Yeah I have gone from msi to asus and back to msi with my latest build. Will never ever buy a asus component again. As nice as their products look, software and bios is just crap. MSI also doesn't have the best software, but at least its stable and does what it says.
This isn't a mobo problem. Asus has horrible RMA/replacement practices. My Z13 just stopped charging while connected to my xg mobile and they refused to replace it. Instead they "repaired" it, but actually did exactly nothing to it and sent it back saying it was repaired. I'll never buy an ASUS product again. Horrible QC and trash customer service.
So basically we have entered the dark ages of pc gaming.
Agreed. As I'm watching this on two ASUS monitors. I kinda knew what I was getting with them though but they were the right price.
ASUS had been the Mercedes Benz of motherboards for years. I generally avoided them due to their price but they were good boards.
i would like the see some kind of list of the best brands at least for the moment. like support these companies, and avoid these that kind of list.  something that can potentially put some pressure on the companies. like i used asus products and had no big problem i´ve noticed at least.. but now it seems i should avoid them for the time being..
This should be doen to Fords Ecoboost engines that are ALL leakimg coolant and require a engine swap. And Ford refused to fix it.
The only RMA I've ever had to deal with was with Asus and it was an absolute nightmare, so much so that I was in a yelling match with the CSR. I've always tried to dodge them since then regardless of their top tier rep. We as the enthusiast community appreciate the honesty and the YouTube folks sticking together. Thanks Jay.
i thought Asus was a Taiwan company. Are you saying it is Chinese? Btw. are there any American company producing motherboards, CPU's and GPU's, I mean real american labour?
Never had an Asus motherboard, too damn expensive compare to all the other choices available! Bye bye Asus. 😋
Hey Jay you could assuage your conscience by sending all the ASUS motherboards to me ?
After they wouldn't allow me to RMA my Tuf B550, they can go to hell for me.
Almost 10 yrs ago I realised that for the Italian market there's just one person answering phone and emails for the motherboard assistance. I sent them an EATX motherboard for an RMA, they sent me back the refurbished one into a standard ATX box without foam to protect the sides and it came damaged and I've been lucky that one guy who managed the RMA believed me I wasn't the one to destroy the mobo and sent me another one. So nothing get better since that day!
Big respect on your name!
I think I might need to go ASRock for future builds.
My buddy has always bought Asus but I've always stayed away from them due his rig running HOT and reviews of others having that issue as well. I use MSI parts and I've never had a single issue. I'm sure issues do exist though.
I dont get the historic ASrock hate , i have never had issues with them.
It isn’t just ASUS MOBOs though 😂.  My brand, ASROCK has been killing it with Ads though so theyre taking full advantage of this ASUS hate 😂
This speaks volumes for the Asus ROG Ally, I wouldn't touch that product with a 10 foot pole, I'm good off an hour of battery life at its native res.
I put the last nail in the asus coffin in 2015 when my p8p67 MB die after 3 years of use. I changed all my hardware to Gigabyte and MSI, zero problems so far so good.
i have a tuff gaming laptop that has been RMA twice and doesn't recognize the graphics card. never again, Terrible QC.
Since Asus Ally is out they are the first company who managed to produce handheld/pc with windows 11 who can run all your games and most of the internet is crazy about it. The way it is that ur either in the train as a youtuber or you don’t so i think they will not care. Btw did you get to speak with the engineer? Or just support? Its two different thing.
This is a lesson to the update hungry people just WAIT ON A OFFICIAL RELEASE I don't even bother with betas never have never will.
"Here's a fix for our products issue. It should work, but if you use it, it will void your warranty."  That doesn't even sound legal to me
Also ASUS laptops are full of crap.
Wow, the day of infamy for ASUS have come, very disastrous for both the brand ASUS and customers who paid top dollars for the brand !! Bad karma catches up with ASUS who have been been gouging the loyal customers
"Hey, keep your ^^STUFF^^."  No way that was overdubbed, right?
I’ve purchased 13 ASUS Monitors in the last 12 months and all of them had dead pixels. The brand is not associated to quality and I done with them. Been with ASUS since the beginning, I’m over 30 years old
that's why i never update my bios with bata  solfware
Appreciate the video Jay it sucks asus was my go to for motherboards I'm glad I didn't buy asus x670. Good thing my asus x570 motherboard is good never had any issues with it.
I would love a motherboard if you are offloading them would save me some money :)
I think I've been using ASUS MB's for what must be close to two decades and never had issues with their products (including graphics cards). I'm about to create my first ever AMD build. You are not the first one I hear similar complaints from. Needless to say, I most likely will be using some other brand this time around.
I was thinking of buying a Asus Strix Rog RTX4090 now I think i'll go elsewhere. I saw a Gigabyte Gaming OC 4090 for about $1700 and a Gigabyte Master 4090 for about $1800, is this a good choice in brand or should I go elsewhere?  I'm planning to water block the the 4090 (whichever I end up with) but am open to any feedback on another brand of graphics card if need be.
I've been buying only Asus boards for almost 2 decades.  I will not ever buy another one.
Dying at the person that said they're glad they bought asrock.... You sweet child pray you don't have to RMA anything of theirs, cause the RMA can and will send you dead hardware and say that they honoured the warranty and not do anything about it
This is real petty jay.
Jay, I’m actually getting ready to purchase a new 13th gen intel board. I almost purchased the asus pro art z790 until I seen this video. What brand do you recommend now?
I am also not happy with my "old" build under AM4 - ASUS + AMD... isn't a great pair concerning stability.
Me, who has been using Asus since like forever... 6:38 ?
Thank you
noooooooooooo! i love asus... my WHOLE set up is asus. welp, time to look elsewhere
Bless you man . Normal consumer don’t have the power to be heard . I had the same issue with the apex 13 they denied it ( bent pin ) asked to trash it (£600 😢) I refused it they sent  back to me in one rubbish card box instead of the original one . I’ve spend easy half a million on this brand in 25 year . The way they treat us in Europe is awful . You’ve said it all . Thank you 🙏
Since forever Asus has had bad support, they just used to be worth it in the past because they had enough quality advantage over most competitors that most buyers didn't have to deal with support.  Now that the quality advantage  is eroded and anti-consumer practices are common across all PC component manufacturers it's clear Asus has lost the only advantage they ever had.
As much as I hate to say it, spot on and good move. The issue of Asus' cack-handed UEFI development - and abject changelog/documentation, has been festering for months. I've been dealing with a Z690 Hero that was turned from a stable platform to an unreliable mess by a beta BIOS update last December - that contained an entirely undocumented feature - the inability to remove it or flash back to a previous stable build. The only practical way to get the system back to reasonable stability was to significantly chop memory bus speeds - with the ensuing performance hit.  When I eventually got some response from Asus, the cure was long in coming, and still not as good as where it was, although users have also now discovered how to circumvent the flash block and go back to earlier builds.  In the meantime, many other users have been dealing with similar issues and been caught by the undocumented regression block - which Asus have started noting in their changelogs only *very* recently, and for very spurious reasons (supposedly compliance with Japanese wifi standards).   Language barriers are one thng. Downright shoddy behaviour and poor treatment of customers who are paying top dollar for supposedly premium products is another.  On the upside, my Hero didn't have the reverse cap. On the other, it's had a flaky and unreliable onboard NIC (another common problem) since purchase.   Next time, I'll be looking elsewhere. Probably toward EVGA, given they're one of the few tech companies that's enhanced their rep for doing the right thing over the last couple of years. If only I could still buy their graphics cards.
I just realized I’ve been watching your videos for over a year…. And somehow hadn’t subbed?! The fuck?!  This type of honesty and accountability from someone at your level is phenomenal to witness! Keep it up!
Well done Jay! Amazing fair play 👌🏻
I had a lot of bad experience with ASUS since 2011! One motherboard completely died on me in an office pc! I've sent it to RMA and received back one that was obviously used without a heatsink on vrms! They refused to give me another replacement. I just bought Gigabyte then and sold that ASUS poo. Since then Gigabyte or MSI for me and no problems since then. Seriously I was thinking I was unlucky or something since everyone I know used asus and no one believed me.
Respect! Kudos Jay for standing up for us consumers.
Glad to see YouTubers are finally starting to see Asus for the shit company they’ve been for years.
RESPECT for taking such a brave stance and protecting consumers!!   I never could stand ASUS and thier overpriced hardware - everything about them always felt arrogant and overdone.  Thanks to Steve and Jay - all of my suspicions are now confirmed.
Personally, I used ASROCK in quite a few of my builds and there have never been any issues. I only discovered the brand when my ASUS board back in the day died and my local parts shop offered me a second hand ASROCK board they had ripped out of another PC for 20 bucks that was compatible with my CPU at the time. My current rig uses a Gigabyte board, as does my wifes PC, and both run better than my prior MSI prebuild @.@
Asus hardware is top tier, but I have to admit their software has been lacking and getting worse for years (been using Intel Asus and nVidia Asus for 10+ years)
Told ya
i have an Asus b650 Tuf board in my rig right now... plan on upgrading to X670E in the near future... after watching Steve's coverage on all of the Asus bullshittery i was leaning towards giving Asrock another go... but after seeing this video i think it will definitely be my next upgrade path. i used to love Asus, but now i cant wait to get away from them
This channel has more integrity than the German government.
Asus motherboards are crap. The first and last one I purchased was an LGA2011 socket, X99 Deluxe II board back in 2016. Upon receiving the brand new board, I found a couple of the USB ports not working. It also had a super long boot time to Windows compared with the other 2011 socket boards. I didn't bother RMAing it because of the hassle and I didn't need to use all of the USB ports.   Went with EVGA and MSI boards for subsequent builds. No complaints from either so far.
Lets go to the ASROCK gang, Huge Kudos Jay :)
This is a real shame. Out of all the companies making PC hardware ASUS was the one i liked the most. Basically all my PCs for the last 7 years were made almost solely from ASUS and Corsair parts (Fractal Design cases are just too good). I tried couple of motherboards from different manufacturers but ASUS ALWAYS had the best bios in my opinion. Altough i have to admit that my last ASUS monitor is absolute garbage, it began breaking super early and i am not eligible for varranty because of some stupid pixel count bullshit that doesnt exceed certain thresholds or whatever. Ill have to start looking for something else when it comes to main PC parts looks like it.
Amazing video. Really appreciate the transparency like always
Wow!  That's damming, but these things have to be said sometimes.  I gave As*s 'the elbow' years ago and been a Gigab*te fanboy ever since: No hassles, no dramas just good quality merch with excellent customer support (GBT-Tech UK, you know I'm talking about you..👍).  As*s can go and do one for me...👎
I mean, from an outside perspective nothing here looks too crazy bad. QC control is an issue, but nothing malicious (other than the firmware).  I've used ASRock boards quite. About and never had too many issues, one of the only affordable brands left for MBs now 😂
If you have any ASUS products that are part of this issue, be sure to file a complaint with the FTC, so they can bolster their investigation of ASUS.
Hmm, same thing with Logi. They make nice hardware, but software just went to shit, but they don't give a damn
gutted just bought the z790-e
I’ve been using ASUS Motherboards for 15 years with no problems. I’m used to using them. I’m used to the layout and their manual, etc.  From newest to oldest: ROG Maximus XIII Extreme, ROG Maximus XI Hero, ROG Maximus IX, Prime 299X, Prime 99X, WSG-10X (or something like that).  I was going to get the newest ROG Maximus Z-790 Extreme, next. But maybe I’ll wait.
I wonder if Asus will respond or reach out?
Shit, I just about to build another Asus pc
I've been having a lot of strange problems with my ROG Strix X570-E Gaming board. Just random weird hardware and/or driver issues. I've tried updating chipset, tried updating BIOS, audio drivers, video drivers, crashes in games, screen freezing up in the browser, blue screens, audio glitches, etc. So finally I switched back to Gigabyte and the problems all went away. I'm even still using the same Windows install from the ASUS board. No more issues. Such a crazy thing.
Did you get the Ally review unit?
the best part about this....... is the people who won't watch this video and ask Jay in 3 months to review an ASUS product and then we get to hear Jay grip about it.
Why pay beta testers when you can get beta testers to pay you?
I don’t know whether or not it was due my rig being open air or this latest BIOS update but I had to replace my motherboard recently due to it constantly throwing a USB Over Current error and refusing to boot… despite the fact I had nothing USB plugged in :/
Thank God. First to say it thanks mate.
I have had multiple systems and somehow every ASUS ROG product I've had, 2 Ryzen motherboards and 1 laptop, has failed faster or showed more annoyances then anything else I've used.
As a long time Asus user this really saddens me, thankfully I've no need to upgrade for a few years.
Asus literally entered their Villian Arc, such a waste of a former great company..
It is very unfortunate that they responded like this. I have good experience buying asus products. I live in south east asia and I was surprised asus replaced my gpu because the gpu died one day after I bought it.
I been building computers for over 15 years and have not seen any reason to build a water cooled pc. My latest build is a threadripper 24core mounted on a gigabyte mb using the amd ryzen threadripper cpu cooler. Temp is average 51-60 deg. Has 64gb ram total in all 8 slots and a rtx 3060 temp at 28deg. I can run games at max settings and temp has never been a issue or crash. This case has 11 fans, 3 in top, 3 in front, 1 in back, 2 in bottom, and 2 facing the side glass. Fastest pc for gaming I ever built all new parts except for open box mb and a light us cpu. Build cost total with 700 watt ps $2150.
I have not seen a solid Mobo from Asus since the Z270 series, honestly............
wow everything your exprincing on the live stream Im having I thought it was a ram issues but this my make me look at my Asus motherboard
Wow and damn! So which other brand can you guys recommend ? As I will not buy Asus again.
It blows my mind that RMA's share the same room as new products being shipped @ ASUS.  Im an electro mechanical technician, and build the electronics for medical devices.  Our RMA department doesn't even share the same building as the rest of the facility.
I had an ASUS MOBO some years ago that shit itself after 4 years! I never bought another ASUS product again. I have a Gigabyte UD board that is 12 years old and still running 24/7 as a server!!! Now that is reliability.
I think they got ahead and then started resting on their laurels.  Makes me think the people who were good there have gone.
Checked yesterday to see if the latest BIOS for my X670E-F (7800X3D fitted) was still in Beta, noting that the disclaimer was still showing as voiding your warranty. Just checked again after watching this and the disclaimer has disappeared, as if by magic!
I got an ASUS RT-AX86S last year, had it just a few months before something in the radio fried and signal strength even a meter from the antennas dropped to -85 to -90 dBm. After they confirmed in mid December it was a defective unit, it took them a full three and a half months of them ignoring me for a week, me following up, and them telling me there was no stock for an RMA or even a new in box replacement and ignoring again until I followed up. I'd hear about how they were dealing with the warehouse, or how there were delays with this and that, even their apologies were so clearly scripted I knew how every call would go after the tenth or eleventh one down to the specific phrases and words they used. In March I finally got my replacement and I'll never buy another ASUS product as long as I live.
See you at the 700 series motherboard reviews
I have the ROG STRIX X670E…..the first couple weeks it kept crashing at random times….but after a while it just stopped….it might be a Microsoft Windows issue…after they collect data from the crashes…the problems seem to go away. Its been stable for a month now.
I decided to stop buying ASUS products about 4 years ago after they gave me a hassle with regard to a warranty repair. The office ultimately issued an apology, but in my opinion it was just too little too late. I'm using MSI now.
oh that sucks, been buying asus for like 25 years now. oh well bb asus gl &hf
I had enough with them when they released the Asus strix 7.1 headset.   That headset had a commonly known about issue that regarded the fact that it boot looped (really disruptive during gaming sessions).  They didn't fix the issue and they didn't allow for RMA and denied several users (me included). This was years ago. It's really stupid that this headset had this issue and that they refused to fix it because it was a really solid headset in every other way.
I've always been a big fan of Asus. I've done with them.
Respect
My 7950X and Asus Strix X670E-E Gaming WIFI running solid now for about 3 months. Going to be very cautious on my next bios update.
Didn't Asus have had some 3080 series graphics cards with missing thermal pads on the ram chips as well? I hope that ASUS gets back to their quality soon. I wouldn't "fire" them at all.
For those who dare.
So Jay bought AMD and found out, huh? Would you look at that? 😆
Seems like a bad time for motherboard manufacturers, MSI just had their UEFI keys leaked which is also really bad.
You guys rock. Your reporting on industry BS (along with Gamer's Nexus) is why I keep coming back to your channels. Love what you guys do and siding with the consumer. I feel it's only you guys who can keep these large corporations honest.
Better late than never, Asus has been demonstrably shit for many years.
I would love to see a follow up video on what replacements for the different boards that you would recommend.
I had a bad ASUS experience when i built my brother a computer back in the Phenom II days. Brand new asus motherboard, worked for like a month, and then decided to stop reading dual channel memory. Would only work with one stick at a time, so I contacted Asus to see what was going on, they basically told me "you did something wrong and broke it, no warranty replacement" and I was just baffled. I felt so bad for my brother because he saved a lot of money to have me build him a good higher end system, and asus just fucked us both over and never even attempted to right the wrong. Turns out lots of people were having that problem with that motherboard and there never was a proper fix for it, so they just swept it under the rug. I have never bought asus hardware from that point on.
I've now found out that my Asus motherboard from 6 years ago has been crashing my PC every once and a while.
Always used ASRock/MSI motherboards with intel/amd and never ever had any problem with it. Right now im rock solid on z790 asrock and 13600k. It is funny, because i've always thought asus was the top board shit and whatever.
Looks like I'm not gonna go with ASUS with my next build..... Anyone got any ideas for some good brands.???
Kudos for putting your money where your mouth is!! Strongly agree these actions needs to be done for a big company like Asus to wake up and mybe start listening.   My question is why you don't feature any Gigabyte/Aodrus bords? I have a few builds with them (intel and amd) and no problem so far.
EVGA & Asus were always my go-to brands on graphics cards. Although I have also had some great Gigabyte and MSI cards too. Motherboards... I've seen so many problems of so many kinds of so many brands, that I don't really trust 'any' brand for mobo's.
Damn, what brand can we trust these days😢
i stopped buying asus stuff after a bad experience on a laptop, screen failure, two rma, returned with different inferior screen, i asked my money back, i still have some working motherboards from asus from almost 10 years ago x79 chipset, working no problems, but new products are garbage
Massive respect for you Jay. Thank you!
I choose ASUS due to the great reviews and they used solid capacitors back in 2012, Intel board.  Did ASUS have a change of leadership lately?  Or did they switch to GREED MOOD?
genuinely terrible situation, I've been running rock-solid ASUS X99-S mobo with EVGA GTX980Ti Classified, laater upgraded to 1080Ti ASUS Strix, and now EVGA is gone (for gpus) and ASUS fucked up motherboards (I'm not paying 60% extra to have less features my old mobo had)
I bought a brand new ROG STRIX X570-F GAMING motherboard last year in an attempt to build on their AM4 platform. The board has multiple faulty DIMM slots and it took me over a month of many emails and calls to get them to RMA it. They literally sent back the same board and told me there was nothing wrong with it. This has happened half a dozen times literally. I have been trying to properly RMA this board since September 8th of last year! The last time they sent it back I was told that I could send it back in for "repair". Now I have to call them about this again. This is absolutely amazing and incredibly frustrating to say the least.
Minimum requirements to buy Asus again: 1.) Warranties are the law, not mere suggestions. 2.) Unfuck Armoury Crate - especially the Aura Lighting Service eats CPU and causes stutter like you wouldn't believe. It is just controlling a few LEDs ffs! 3.) And the most important - stop apologizing but refusing to fix anything. Any sincere apology would include solving the problem. We care about deeds, not lip service.
My Asus Tuff won’t even recognize the bios file they provided
a few words here....   Asus AI Suite ...............  That should already make you RUN! ..
I had the same issues and bluescreens with my asus x670e.  A big windows developer update fixes all. No problems so far. The Sound bug Firmware is out.
I had issues  with Asus about 15 years ago with motherboard  issues.  I  never purchased  another one since.  Asus deserve  what you have done.  Don't buy Asus . It's simple.
Huge W
It's so sad given how their UEFI is still the best while their hardware amd support took a nose dive
Just so people will know at the moment I’m doing a lot of repairs and at least 85% of them are Asus I think the problem is they’ve seen the money back on quality control and Customer service, which are the most important things in business.
I have problem with am5. asrock b650e riptide and 7900x. It boots with igpu always if update bios or clearcmos... only thing that gets my pc boot is turn off "fastboot" and disable igpu, even if its set to "use egpu".
I have avoided ASUS and took a X670e Tomahawk.   0 issues and boot at frist time. Hope the will release the final fix and not only a workaround in beta verision that reduces the Voltage
You should get ASRock for a sponsor. I’ve never had a problem with than the top end is very good. They’re mid range. Also very good and they do some very nice budget boards as well. 👍🏻
I recently switched over to AMD and built a 7800X3D system on top of the ROG STRIX X670E-F motherboard. My timing sucked as I bought everything just before burning CPU news came out. That did freak me out obviously, but I can say everything is running fine for me. I've been careful to observe the SOC voltage, and running stress tests, and it's all stable and remains within safe margins (max 1.137v). One issue I have discovered is I can only apply EXPO settings in Ryzen Master, not the bios. I'm unable to post with EXPO settings in the bios. I'm hoping that will corrected in a future bios update.  And indeed I am running the current beta bios 1410.  It's not a good situation and looks like ASUS has messed up big time when you observe all the (high😵‍💫)current negative coverage, so I thought it would be useful to share my experience as ASUS mb owner. It's not all bad out there in the field.
Well shit... I have an ASUS 4090.. if something happens, im fucked.
@JayzTwoCents if you're getting weird audio issues, run LatencyMon .  I was getting latency storms with Bus issues that were consistent as processor load came up
oh they are gonna be worrying soon
They are too big to care. I've answered the question "which mobo to buy" with "Asus" for 25 years now, but that's it! If MSI and ASRock are better, then okay! I have a new answer now.
You have my vote of confidence, because your honesty is refreshing.  Thank you Sir!  EDIT: I was literally looking into buying the Asus Zenbook Pro Duo 14.5 2023 version. I stopped for a moment and thought I should take one more look at some reviews of Asus; boy am I glad I did!
All my earlier boards around early to mid 2000's were Asrock ..never an issue.
And also Asus doesn't tend to give you good products , forget refurbished , they literally send you broken garbage and waste so much time during their bad tech support advice and condescending-nothing we can do attitude ,that you just give up and get something else instead. Same thing happened to me . I'm really pissed off with the Asus stuff. Lost all faith to this bad company.
Imagine McDonalds sold a new poisonous sauce and told you that you can't sue them if you get sick or die because it's in testing phases. Exact same concept.
Pegatron: shoot asus in the leg and raise asrock quality to boost sales on asrock real 3D chess here
I mean sounds very pro consumer to me, consumers just "consume" product and don't ask questions. As a customer I think about the stuff I'm gonna purchase. Really like my Asus ROG flow x16, but very poor quality that I had to open the laptop and fix a known hard drive issue that effects most the laptops and is solved by literally moving to the other m.2 slot, yet Asus never even tried to fix it.
Couldn’t agree more. I loved Asus, but I’ve been having so many issues with their boards, it’s driving me crazy.
My current AMD based Asus laptop is giving me so much stuttering issues recently that im getting a new intel PC without any Asus product in it . Really pisses me off when brands don't care about their customers. Good to see , Jay did the right thing too. Cheers !!
crap, I was planning to go with asus parts for my new build later this year, after having nothing but problems with the gigabyte parts in my current system. having had asus parts in the parts that have usually exceeded expectations when it came to performance, i figured "go with the thing you know". which brand currently is the most reliable overall now?
Pretty much the reason I haven't bought one of their products in years. And definitely the reason I'll be keeping my Steamdeck instead of hopping on the Ally.
Man what a fall from grace. One of my best boards was the p6t-d when their slogan was “rock solid”.   I’ve had other brands that just had poor software or bios support so generally unless there was a price difference I’d go ASUS. Now I’ll consider other brands first.   Time to find another mono
Thanks for the head's up, won't be going for Asus for my next build.
would of been nice to know in December before I got the AMD B650 AM5 ATX motherboard with 12 + 2 power stages, DDR5, PCIe® 5.0 NVMe® SSD ... when everyone said it's good poop on me
Thank you again for your 100% honesty to your loyal viewers, you are one of a kind my friend.  Like so many more i have been a 100% Asus builder. I've a full white ASUS Rog Loki wall build sat in my basket, I've been holding of listening to the latest issues, and now thanks to yourself its been emptied, I'm now currently drawing up a Asrock Z790 Taichi Carrara build with the black and white EKWB radiators to see what that looks like.
it seems new guys are in charge and they only care about the money.... poor asus will be the next company that they will destroy to suck up all the blood left from it
How the mighty have fallen...
Youytube Vanced suddenly started working again after a month of no longer working. I'm happy it came back just as this reached my feed so I could upvote it, which I couldn't have done on any alternative.
Because of the video itself I went with a different company. It's sad sad. But the only way to get these companies to do the co summer right is to not buy there products.
This is MSI's chance to dethrone ASUS! Even the cheapest products from them are solid! Unlike ASUS whose most expensive laptops have trash air flow and the most expensive GPUs have terrible coil whine. Only the motherboards were great but now this...... I have all the hate for brands that don't care about their customers and specially the ones with less money.
Isn't Asrock an Asus sub-brand?
Daum, I've literally bought the Asus B550-F gaming due to all of the positive reviews, I installed it 4 days ago. Also I had issue with the ethernet, the cable was plugged in and the lights were working normally on the back, but there was no internet. I had to get a wireless wifi card in order to fix the issue ...
No more ASUS in my builds from now on. The liquid cooler and the RTX 3080 in my pc will do it's part, and then be replaced by another brand which is less anti-consumer.
To add more to asus bs. I had to replace fans 2 times on my 3090 strix. They all wobbled horrible and made noises eventually not wanting to spin. Do better asus
I stopped buying Asus a few years back. Poor quality, issues and lack of support or solutions. I just had enough of them.
And I bought 7800x3d and an asus board just 1.5 months ago. Fking asus. Screwed me and others
They told me to warranty my board then charged me for a replacement board that was also defective. Still fighting with them for refund after three months.
There has got to be over 2 million combine views on this with Jay, Steve of Gamers Nexus. I have had exactly the same experience with the we have your money now F you attitude of ASUS I now have a system that cost thousands of pounds of my hard earnt money to have it stolen from this corrupt company. I am not confident to switch it on the Anxiety is not worth it will it kill the CPU GRAPHICS CARD 4090 (£2000). I know some will say if you can afford to spend that kind of money then so what but I saved for two years to afford this never again back to XBOX I think for me then all you have to do is pay your game pass and deal with bad game development not hardware as well.
Jay,, when are you gonna fire Nvidia ?  Long time fan and folower, but honnestly this seems a bit radicale compared to how you handle Nvidia.  No disrespect jay, just wondering can you explain this ?  Thx😊
Now if only game companies/game developers were held to this standard for PC games that don’t work on release. At $70 no less :(
I still remember the day when Asus had the reputation of making super-reliable motherboards that just worked without any instabilities or issues. Not the cheapest, but well worth the price.
I am so glad that I have not upgrade my rig from MSI board into ASUS board. Thank you Jay for stepping up. Glad that you mention MSI is still worth to use by consumer.
I disagree with Jays take. If I refused to buy from every company that screwed the pouch on handling something from the start I would never buy any product ever. I have had issues from the start with every company I have ever contacted in customer service, I had to jump through too many hoops to get things resolved, but in the end resolved they were and that is the goal. If Jay does not want to work with Asus? that's fine.. I just think it is a bad business decision. Hold them accountable, but if you take away your own leverage by no longer dealing with and having contact with them. You have now taking your influence with them out of the equation. You dun Cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.
I can't say that I've ever had an Asus product.  If everyone stops buying Asus I wonder where this will leave the ALLY.  Will they just become a hand-held company?  Or will another company buy the ALLY and release it under their own brand?  In any case this appears to be the beginning of the end for Asus.  Glad I never invested in them.
Unbelievable things like that typically happen in an environment where the mid-level management is more focused on keeping senior level management happy than the company's customer base. This usually happens out of fear and could be indicative of bad people management and an adverse company culture. I guess a good start would be to fire the senior management all together.
This makes me sad, I've been using ASUS for years and I'm about to upgrade my gpu and now I don't know what brand I should buy anymore.
I'm so looking forward to the massive class action lawsuit against ASUS for this bullshit.
I wanted to buy the ASUS XT8 mesh router but after seeing the reviews on Amazon I completely avoided. 15:52 regarding their customer support was the main reason, and it wasn't just 1 person with that experience. Went for the netgear orbi. And as JayzTwoCents explained, it's true ASUS will give you a recertified replacement after sending yours in, their RMA is horrible.
This is not a surprise for me because the Times we live in it’s go sheep, or go down with the ship because everything is so freaking expensive right now. Well I can understand why everything is so trash right now.
I've been using MSI and Gigabyte's mainboards for the past 10 years. It's good I caught this in time, as I was about to spring on an Asus ROG board with a 13900k build.   Thanks to you (and @ganersnexus) for the relentless expose, I'll likely never touch an Asus product going forward, but hope they clean up their act for everyone else.
so i just bought a b650ef for a 7700x, what am i supposed to do? i was planning on doing the build today :(
ASUS didn't just shoot themselves in the foot with this one, they put the weapon in their mouth and pulled the trigger. If they don't shape up, and *Soon,* they'll be circling the drain in a couple of years...  I bet they did the Voltage thing on purpose to be able to say; "It performs better on our boards!" Only, this time they pushed it too far and it litterally blew up in their faces.
Turns out Asus has been ... A SUS brand this whole time!!!
that beta should be removed from public access and only be tested  by actual testers so its good i never use beta bioses
what do asus motherboards have in common with russian tanks? first they look good, then they burst into flames! 😂
thank you this was very helpful i was thinking buying one , but know i think i will go with MSI really helpful video
I don't know if the model I bought (X670E-A, bought because resonably priced and white) has the issue or not but I've had it sat in the corner of my room for a while now with no parts attached or chip in it and it'll sit there until they fix this issue... but I won't be buying another ASUS part after this mess (every motherboard I've ever bought has been an ASUS one)... after my laptop issues I won't be buying MSI either (it's keyboard is disassembling itself and it overheats all the time).  I'll wait for a fix for the current issues but this will be the last one!  Asrock Taichi boards any good (it's white but pretty expensive and E-ATX so case fitment might be difficult - O11D EVO planned)?
how much did AsRock pay you to plug them ?
What's a good choice now Asus suck?
Went through 2 Strix B550s with my current build. They just refused to boot randomly. After the 2nd RMA sold it for 40$ on eBay and bought an MSI. Haven’t had an issue since.
damn thank you jayz seriously you the man for putting this out, im a msi lover but still thank you sir
was thinking of going with Asus for my next build... yikes
great vid
I was told several times that when ASUS created Asrock, Asrock inherited ASUS factories, while Asus moved their production to Foxconn.  That said, I had a bunch of Asrock boards in the past and they were all solid. I had two ASUS. One blew off one power carrying lane for usb on the board. The other one just sucked.  For several upgrade cycles I have gone with gigabyte. They deliver what I want and just work (for me).
i finished with Asus years ago. I got a laptop for a friend and then found that I couldn't install Linux on it due to a locked down BIOS. Their tech support just said it's a Windows only machine so I told them where to stick it.
Sounds like something in your agreements broke down so now you're bashing Asus (or any other company to that matter). I mean, Gamers Nexus does that too but he is consistent and has always been critical....
Me : Reads the title of the video, sees the boxes of X670E motherboards on the table next to Jay then looks over in RL and sees a box for X670E that she has put into her latest build..  Uh oh...
Wow this sucks. I have a Asus monitor that is solid but if these ASSES (ASUS) doing this crap towards customers am not buying anything from Asus again. Thank god I went with MSI on my motherboard.
it makes me sad to hear this. I have been a bit of an Asus fanboy since the S775 days. :( they need to really sort this out.
I am pretty worried at the mo as i ordered a 7800X3D and the Asus X670E Extreme (which i have not received yet due to stock issues on pther parts of my build). This issue wasn't known at the time so now i am freaking out. Not really sure what to do at present. In 2 minds whether to try and switch toally back to intel and go with a different manufactorer all together for the board. Thanks for airing the points in the video Jay.
Thank you for your honesty, integrity and courage to boot an anti-consumer company.
Didn't ASUS send earlier boards out with a capacitor backwards and caused catastrophic failures? NVM didn't watch the video all the way through lol😂😂😂
ROG = Republic of Garbage
Send me those Asus motherboards 😅😅😅, i want to build a PC but i cant afford it yet
There's nothing worse than a brand that care only about its image.  Look at Apple
I remember tests in the pci era - when ASUS was ALWAYS slightly oc'ing their stuff to 'win' tests. Of course it was detrimmental to your systems stabilty.  So ASUS being scumbags isnt really something new.
I typically don't enjoy the jump on the wagon when something goes wrong, having said that this is what happens with companies once they get their brand image. People buy simply for the brand as supposed to quality. See this with many brands eventually they don't need to put in the work. I have a complete ASUS rig and had no problems although the software is horrible just terrible. Props to you Jay for showing them the door not many would follow in your footsteps unfortunately.
Pretty dramatic, wish they put back the RMA.
Appreciate the effort, but "der Bauer" also had found problems with MSI and other motherboards. Ofcorse the void warranty thing is shity but it isn't only Asus.
Asus started going downhill when they branded every product as a rog strix product and did away with the sabertooth motherboard line among others. They raised prices and lowered quality.  I got a b550 rog strix motherboard a few years ago and the USB 2.0 headers are doa. I've been using Asus for decades and have never had this issue before.
Severing relationsip with entire company just because few (albeit important) teams messed up is I think a wrong decision. Asus can very easily fix all the technical problems in less than a month time if they put effort into it.
yeah stopped buying Asus products las gen.. this company has gone to shit
Can't wait for the class action lawsuits to roll in
Looks like I need to find a different mobo manufacturer after 20 years...
Colton works at ASUS, too? I'm confused!
Jay I am disappointed in you for going with "as solid as a ASRock" when "as solid ASRock" was right there
Well thats awkward considering i just built my first, and very expensive dream PC with ASUS parts. 😬
Even their laptops getting shittier each generation. I had A42 and A43 low end i3 laptops from 2010-2011 and gave them to relatives around 2017, they still going to this day. Their newer Vivobooks have a lot of RAM problem and guess what? They are soldered. Lenovo and HP also have ram soldered to the motherboard but I never encounter one with dead ram. Their TUF cheap gaming laptops are terrible too. Found atleast three FX504GEs with snapped hinge mounting Ala Acer Nitro 5 AN515 and one of them has heatsink mountings torn off from the motherboard.
small criticism to jay, with most boards, if not all boards having a black motherboard, and all of the "color" is from the heatsinks, jay go so hard on water-cooling and and tubing, and doing so hard as to messing and removing the retaining socket. why not just mod the heatsinks, to make the theme, and let motherboard features dictate the boards you use, instead of aesthetic or brand.
The frustrating thing about your CPU socket situation is that had it been any other regular consumer without backchannels to go through, they'd have just claimed that the customer damaged it themselves and refuse to provide any further support.
I recently built my PC and I was torn between a Gigabyte and Asus motherboard, I’m now very glad I went Gigabyte (it was cheaper at the time as well)
Weird how your video and that other long haired fellows slagging ASUS today; when the ASUS Ally is launched today. If these high end motherboards problems exist then there could be future problems with this new ASUS ALLY.  Now we need other alternatives to ASUS; so the video supports MSI.
I'm glad some people on YouTube have morals
Amateur here: should I worry with 5800x3d and Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (WI-FI)?
The Voice has spoken thank you Jay. About time Asus got told ! ❤❤❤
Shots fired
*my internal panicking knowing I have a crosshair 8 xtreme housing my 5950x*  "Im sure its fine"
Yet you said nothing when Linus was mocking the consumers with the LTT backpack. Just because he is your buddy?
Please don't go back to Intel, change the motherboard to other brand and check if the problem was with Asus or AMD itself.
i have zero issues with my Asus z790-e intel M.B w/13900k .this seems to be a AMD problem as well my z390 build was a AORUS master.dont be a slave to a brand do your home work and buy whats good ATM.
So... MSI or Gigabyte? Or ASRock? Or doesn't it matter?  My last motherboard is an ITX B550 board (with a R5 5600G) from ASUS. Most of my graphics cards, too, have usuallly been from ASUS, beside to MSI. My gaming computer (still) has an X370A-Prime with a 5700X - thanks to ASUS's BIOS upgrades.
So is this an AMD exclusive issue or is it also occurring with Intel CPUs??
ASUS had super fucked up x99 boards and refused to replace the boards that they knew were bad and break over time.
I've been saying nice things to my X670E-F hahahah, please don't kill my CPU :D
Asus has removed the void warranty blurb on their BIOS pages now. I think ASUS makes the best motherboards in general personally, but I'm glad people are calling them out of some of this BS. Gotta keep them accountable and make them own up to when they make mistakes. Especially when those mistakes could be potentially harmful beyond the single components in question. Hopefully they shape up and get some of their brand respect back up.
Asus always had a good reputation (until recently). I had issues with a new motherboard I bought from Gigabyte, but all their previous motherboards were reliable. Asus needs to change a lot of things about their company or else they might not be around a lot longer. I've switched to MSI and am very satisfied.
Thanks for this info.  I have been using an Asus Z77 Sabertooth since 2011 , with an i7-2600k. No issues whatsoever so I felt good about ASUS. I've just started looking  to build a modern system and was looking at Asus boards, then I saw these vids and got worried. Is MSI a better bet, or is this an issue with ASUS and AMD chips together?
Damn can't even recommend asus anymore for anything after this.
I am currently watching this on the ASUS G15 Advantage Edition from 2021, it's been having issues with crashing while playing games and general instability since June-July last year, I've tried everything, reinstalling Windows multiple times, lowering settings, updating the VBIOS version and graphics drivers, limiting the wattage in Armory Crate, uninstalling Armory Crate, nothing has worked, and I haven't seen this issue be addressed anywhere except one Reddit post from years ago and even that said that the latest VBIOS and graphics drivers versions are stable yet they're not, I've taking my laptop to the service center 5 times and every time they just reinstall Windows, roll back to the old VBIOS and graphics drivers versions, and hand it back to me, it's been frustrating, and it's an expensive laptop, I won't be able to afford another one in this range for years to come, suffice to say my next laptop isn't going to be ASUS, but I'm stuck with it until I'm done with college pretty much.  One of the most disappointing parts about it has been the fact that one of the reasons I went for this laptop was Linus' video on it yet he hasn't updated it in any way so it's nice to see content creators talk about ASUS and call them out on their shitty practices when it comes to customer service and the lifetime of their products. I recommended this laptop to a friend, he bought it, and he's been having the same issues.
This will hurt them. I will never buy Asus again. And many more people.
Yeeah take it Assus!
I miss white motherboards myself. Soyo used to make them on their Dragon boards years ago (20+ years ago) hopefully they'll become popular again.
does these bios updates affect the older boards h510 and b560 by asus ?
It takes balls to say no thank you.
And people were saying dell was bad lol. Ill go with an alienware before asus now. F it
Thank you for this content :)
So somehow all of this started with AMD screwing up and it all shifted to an asus blame fest. Sure asus is not handling this correct but I am not convinced yet there is not something wrong with the amd cpu.... you can throw high voltages at an intel without problems...
I experienced their non-existing customer support when trying to RMA one of my gaming monitors. They never even really got back to me. The only thing I could do now is go contact the vendor I got them from (got 2 side-by-side on a monitor stand mounted to my table) and try having them replace the one with the backlight issue. As the issue isn't too bad to be perfectly honest I'm probably just going to sit through this, spare me the hassle of sending it in and maybe then have another monitor that's even worse after a while.  As the 3-year warranty period will end in two week's I might just keep them for another year or two and throw them in front of a train when I happen to find other good monitors from some other brand that respects us as their customers 😞
Greed is destroying our world. It's everywhere... Cars, domestic techware, computers. food
Low budget boards have better support.
This is why I follow this channel. BS needs to be called out. Well done
when are you going to do a setup war/ overview
Thanks Jay, appreciate it. Can anyone explain what they feel about Gigabyte, im seeing a couple comments where people say asus and gigabyte are basically the same when it comes to customer care and quality?😅
What brands are still reliable in your opinion? I don't know of any that aren't outright malicious anymore.
Thankyou for being open and honest Jay so us regular consumers don't get taken advantage of.
1:15 I heard that.
You should do a series on AsRock. I have used tier motherboards my last 3/4 times. I have been very happy with them, no high end, cheap and medium for my wallet. Espechaly when I rather do a little extra work if that save some money.
Thank you Thank you Thank you Jay. Been on board with you for like the last 4-5 years and you helped teach me how to build a pc. I just had not 1 but 3! 3! am5 ASUS Tuf Motherboards just DOA from factory. 2 bent/smashed pins just like yours 3 just CPU/RAM/GPU loop. ASUS was trash on the ability to help and constantly questioning my ability of putting the pc together. Said screw it sent it all back CPU (AM5), DDR5, and the TUF(POS) MOBO. Jump back to AM4 even upscaled my cpu and ram. Grabbed me that BEST of the BEST ASROCK B550 Steel Legend MOBO. Wham oh. Worked like a champ right out of the box. That is after watching you vid about $200+ mobo. Got it for $189 so cutting it close. Still Thank you Jay your the man for speaking up for us. Hopefully someone at ASUS will see this and possibly have the presence of mind to really think this one over before it gets bad.
This video broke my heart because i love my asus x evangelion build  ..   i don't think i will ever go for asus again after watching this 😢
Respect Jsy and Team to have the strength in your convictions and the integrity to stand by those convictions. More people should call out companies when they act shady.
This is disheartening. Asus has been my goto brand for over 15 years. Now I need to find another for my upcoming build.
i did a RMA on a rog Strix 3050 in Jan and still have not got it back
good
This is tough, Asus has been my main since I joined the master race. But I think it's time to give MSI maybe even asrock a go
This is pretty sad. ASUS used to be the brand I trusted 10-15 years ago, the brand name of reliability. I have an ASUS motherboard in my computer at this moment from 2019 that has issues with the audio controllers not being recognized on Display Port swap, so the sound just cuts out until restart. I'm tired of this brand too and this video is bigger than they think. For my next PC build, I will not be considering ASUS any longer. For over a decade loyal customer, I am very sad at the decline of this brand.
Have an Asus B550 board and rather like it for what it is, but this seems to be how Asus insists on performing moving forward so they'll not likely be getting any more of my money if I can help it.
I've been a long-time Asus customer myself but I saw the writing on the wall and dumped them as a brand too. So sad, goodbye Asus. Let us know when you get your sh*t back together.
"The last several years have proven that ASUS is anti-consumer". Yeah, I noticed when they sent my retailer of trust a pallet of TUF 3070 Ti when they discontinued the 1st gen TUF 3080 and basically told the retailer to ask their costumers to get the "replacement" (The retailer had the documentation to proof that paraphrased statement).  F*ck 'em! Weren't they able to send the 2nd gen TUF 3080? What even is the actual diference between 1st and 2nd gen TUF 3080s?
Finally - a big youtuber said, what I am saying for years as a Systembuilder! Over 20 Years I build over 200 Gamer and High-End rigs (including a huge amount of custom H2O builds). Startet very soon often with ASUS boards and did had the most issues with ASUS. I then avoid offering them according to their issues. Over the past years there were often whises for ASUS boards (because ROG is so cool and everybody speaks from them...) and when I had to use them for a build, everytime I was confirmed in my decisions that the most problems comes from ASUS boards. For me the EVGA boards especially actually X299 are absolutley rocksolid (sure nothing is perfect and you will get some failing board...). MSI is second line for me and I did had the fewest issues after EVGA. Many PC-requesters thougt ASUS would be the best and when I am telling my stories, it was a bit annoying to speak against to this "marketing" from ASUS. Looked for me that so much Youtubers and Reviewers are buyed and speak what ASUS would have spoken... Thanks that somebody big now finally spoke the truth about them.
It's not just ASUS fault. It's also AMD. So fudge these two companies and go Intel. EVGA is supposed to be good at handling RMA's.
Kudos to you jay for taking a strong stance against this.
Let's see how this ages. Like fine wine, or fine milk? Time will tell.
Asus Sucks!
first MSI  then Asus. we'll always find out.
good stuff jay!!!!
I have been building computers for friends, family and myself for close to 30 years now and switched to Gigabyte some years ago since I was on a tight budget back then and looking at this I can honestly say that I feel very fortunate that I did. Their peripherals are junk as well, had one of their mice die on me not three months after I bought it, and the configurator for it was a nightmare.
So which brands are actually worth buying now? lol
ohh no therecall had  waitlist which they wouldn't even cover shipping even to say the least, they say oh no well your customer shouldn't have messed with it... Im just like (why even mention OC if its..... )my brain just blue screened.
I was thinking of getting a ASUS board when the AMD 7000 series came out, thank god I went with MSI, which was cheaper as well :D so disappointed that ASUS is doing this, really scummy. In the end went with MSI (2nd board ever and both work well).
Went ASUS/Corsair for my build for RGB compatibility... this got me in the lights, but I was already looking at MSI already. Armory Crate and the way customer service was when I was trying to get things set up... I'd rather give MSI, maybe even AsRock a chance. AsRock's been solid in my wife's build, and I like the simpler BIOS. MSI still has an intact rep (I think) since the B450 Tomahawk, so... worth a shot.
What needs to be done is look at who has arrived in the top echelons of Asus over the last 10 years and fire the lot of them to cleanse them and change the toxic culture. Nvdiai needs the same.
About time this is being said. I bought and ASUS Rog Strix laptop a couple of years ago and at least 2 years ago decided that ASUS will not be considered when a replacement is needed. Problems I have had are: abysmal customer service, paper thin keys cracking and breaking with daily but not heavy use, overheating since the fan vents have been moved to the bottom of the laptop, audio jack cutting in an out, and loose usb connections.  Over priced in the current market for all the poor quality it delivers.
They really did do some FUCKED SHIT!, just Saying ive had 3 clients machines freaking die! That BS had to come out of my  pocket!
Glad this happened. I was leaning towards Asus again for my next build after years of avoiding them and using Gigabyte. The reason was that a friend of mine bought some kind of 2 in 1 laptop from Asus about ~10 years back just after release day (he even waited for it to come available). After about 3 months it died, no power nothing, so he RMA'd it. Took them 8 weeks to tell him: "Mate we're sorry but we can't fix it, and we have no replacement. We can upsell you another (shittier with worse specs) laptop for 100 bucks extra. Of course he declined, and asked for his money back. Took another 2 months and threatening with legal action to get back his money.  I swore I would never buy Asus stuff again after that debacle. After 10 years that resolve dwindled, but this his reinstated it again. MSI or Asrock do look good recently. I wan't to try something else than Gigabyte this time, as I had quite a few memory incompatibility issues with my Gigabyte stuff, and had to use manual mem timings to get it running.
This is stupid. If you go down this path with Asus then you should also go down the same path with Gigabyte and MSI, they've both done BS in the past.   The beta bios voiding your warranty is general wording that is on all their beta bios pages and they have changed it, they have said they will warranty all boards with this issue.   This feels like Jay jumping on a bandwagon far too early, just to get views from it while it's a popular subject. And the views being 3x higher than Jay's normal in a 24 hour period, points to that being valid
When was the AsRock in the avoid brand? I'm waiting answer from 2JJ.
Those times are crazy Big brands deliver shitty products at prices higher than Trump’s ego and decline  any responsibility in case of failure, while small brands work harder than ever to provide high quality products, reasonable price and high end customer support
Simple answer. Big companies not paying employees enough to care. It always about the bottom dollar they dont care who suffers
Ok, thanks for your video. I wont buy an asus anymore. asus is done. i will try a msi or maybe asrock. thx for saying the truth jay!
I used to be a very loyal Asus customer, my first laptop was Asus.  It's still going strong after eight years, however I'm pretty much a desktop  PC user. Be it motherboards or graphics cards Asus was a brand I could rely on. Don't get me wrong occasionally you would get a DOA item, but that is something you just have to get used to as a PC builder.  That said, the laptop I purchased two years ago died after exactly 12 months from the date of its manufacture.  I, after proving it wasn't teleported to my house from South Korea, that it was still under warranty.  I sent that laptop back for RMA packaged like it was a Ming vase, as the instructions for returning the laptop required.  I got it back in the loose box with several dents in my laptop. They couldn't be bothered beyond wrapping it in a layer of bubble wrap.  I got it back saying they replaced my boot drive, of course it failed within a day. I'm pretty sure they replaced my boot drive with some POS they pulled out of some other RMA laptop.  It takes years to build a reputation but months to piss it away.
For the past 3 years i used an msi board, it died after warranty ran out.  Switched to asus, immediately had problems.  Returned it and upgraded to am5 with the microcenter deals.  Comes with asus motherboard and immediately have ethernet issues and other issues.  Never had so many immediate issues with motherboards before.  Some issues went away with bios updates.  Thought maybe its just my luck
I've been using ASUS boards since I started building PCs in 2015...not anymore.  Speak with your wallets people because that is the only thing ASUS cares about.  Edit: If EVGA is listening, there is a huge demand for quality motherboards right now...
b450 boards had terrible  USb 2 header like its only 1 for the gaming f II  the rx5700xt had terrible cooler design    Now it's this crap again
For some reason asus has really bad track record with AMD. For example I once had asus strix vega 64 gpu, I bought that model because I wanted to have the best cooler. Well for some reason asus didn't do any quality control and all of their strix coolers on vega cards had wrong type of screws or something so the cooler wouldn't mount properly. That resulted in very high temps even at 100% fan speed. Also the RMA process was hell and took months. At some point asus lost my card somehow and I got a new one. And guess what, it had the same exact problem since all of the strix cards had it..........
Asus software has been shit and is still shit. And this is coming from someone who's been using Asus motherboards since 2005. I was really close to go with MSI this gen. Next time I will do it.
I upgraded from an Intel Core i7-4770K on an MSI board to AMD Ryzen 5900X on an Asus motherboard. I have _constantly_ had problems with peripherals on this AMD system. Wifi device will vanish at random. Spinny hard drives connected to USB going to sleep get stuck waking up, which halts all further USB ports from connecting anything (no USB drives, no new connections, nothing). A recent Asus driver update seems to have fixed some of these issues after a solid year of problems.  It is sad. Asus has been a great brand, but this is a bad omen.
Hello x) Thank you for this video, I own an asus b650 gaming wifi. And after three months I still can't set a higher frequency on my ram memories. Support didn't help me at all, they just wrote me to wait for bios fixes. When I set the profile to higher frequencies the computer becomes severely unstable and starts shutting down.  WTF xD
Best Jayz video in a good while, appreciate your stand for principles!
Just gotta take a few semesters and understand the whole bios
I feel like they can say it will void your warranty all they want and that still won't save them, a strong argument can be made that their boards already cause serious damage regardless of this "test"
There is a huge difference between consumers and customers. We are not customers, not consumers.
In Germany there is a PC hardware seller called Mindfactory. They can be compared to Micro Center in the US, though Mindfactory is not as big and is more distinctive on the internet as with physical shops you can enter all around Germany and buy stuff. They have one physical shop and that's it (As far as I know). Anyways. About two years ago they suddenly stopped working with Asus. They never officially stated a reason for that. Your and Steve's video get me to think, that this has been the case with Mindfactory aswell.  I really like the Asus product. I myself have a GTX 1080 Strix, an B450-F gaming mainboard and some cheap-o Asus Laptoip. All of that runs without any issues whatsoever. It's a shame that Asus went down this road. I  myself will boycott them until they prove that they're worth buying again. Furthermore I respect your decision on going this route, Jay.
Ironically, i have literally just this week put my b450m asus tuf mobo in bin and put an msi back in as it was causing so many issues over last few months even with new bios updates.
I have been a huge fan of ASRock since ASRock x370 Taichi now there are my favorite brand for motherboards
i haven't even watched the video yet, ASUS/AMD are all total scum bags selling garbage. don't buy there stuff its garbage, i spent thousands on a asus amd setup and ended up wanting to throw it out the window. don't waist your money, stay safe.
I have that same issue with my ASUS Z690 P - Motherboard where my camera will randomly not show up then i have to swap USB ports to get it working again!
Jay, call me oldschool like you and I fully agree 100% with everything. This pc was my first Asus build to follow the ROG 1080TI that's still being a trooper. 8700k 16 gigs of ram and a STIX z390-h. Was great for the first year I owned it, was already older hardware when I got it and was hoping all the problems would of been worked through. Not electronic shy, been doing circuit level repair and overclocking for 20 years 🤣 To the point.  I keep getting the same usb and audio on my intel platform. I've done the fully updated drivers and bios, reverted my bios and drivers to 2019 then blocking automatic updates. Problem seems to have subsided. I think coof is somehow related, with people working from home and not having access to hardware testbeds. I think they tossing 💩 at a fan to see what sticks.
Alot of respect to stand your ground on this issue!
In my previous PC i had an MSI board running for about 10 years with zero problems, love it. Recently I bought a H770-PRO WIFI board and whenever I need to do anything with it, it's just super annoying and doesn't want to let me do anything, except for setting my f**n AURA LED bs. I can't even overclock my unlocked Intel cpu with it, with ASUS support telling me that it's not a recommended and supported thing to do (???). It's very much pushing me to look for a solution from a different brand, be it MSI or Asrock.
Well done Jay your stance is so cool and appreciated. I have watched Asus for a while and expected something like this. I would love to see them finally work out whatever it is that trips them over but again I reckon it’s gotta be only themselves, they just don’t get it. Regardless I thank you for this vid and keep your excellent content coming
Well, I was looking for an Asus Tuf Gaming motherboard because it is time to upgrade mine 17-8700k to I5-13600k. So I will have to look to a new motherboard to buy. Thanks for warning of the Asus issue I hadn't any idea that this was going on
gigabyte and msi have been fine for me, asus ive had probs with
soooo you wanted a white one.....and.....you  got a black one.......and it doesn't fit..COM ON DOES NO ONE ELSE SEE THE JOKE HERE ????   COME ON !!!!!!
I bought a few years ago a gaming monitor from Asus. 3 months later the picture started vibrating. I sent it back in the original packaging. 2 weeks later I got back one which was refurbished in  bubble wrap. When I complained they just ignored me. A year later the back light died. After this experience I will never buy anything with their logo on it
My ASUS experience. Bought an expensive ROG laptop for my kid and it lasted 15 months before component failure (MOSFET) which blew the GPU and VRAM. 15 months and I've had to build my kid a new PC. No more ASUS in my house.
I will never buy Asus products ever again
Aside from evga who we use now
My ROG Maximus Z690 Extreme toasted TWO LSI SAS/SATA hardware raid cards after I installed a Tuf Gaming RTX 3080 OC 12GB GPU. Now I know hardware raid cards run hot but not so hot the heatsink nearly burns you fingers. I've removed the 3080, waiting on an Arc a770, and added a fan under the raid card. Hopefully it will live. Here's the thing, I don't even game, this is just my personal PC that runs Linux and I do so video editing with. I have an old 3770k on an Asus board that's been rock solid since day one and has been running the same LSI card for over two years as a home backup server. That durability lead me to stay with Asus for 10th, 11th, and now 12th gen. But after getting one of the bad Hero boards now I'm not so sure.
Dudes got paid to do this 😂, the new rog portable comes out and these guys suddenly upload this video? Never trust the internet buy whatever you want
Just upgraded my PC to 7800x 3D with the 670 strix ea on bios 1303..
Well i think Asus is no longer the brand to go for mobos
Already turned my back on ASUS when they released a Spectre patch which disabled overclocking on my 6800k and the only way to fix this would be to install a Beta Bios. There never was a stable version released with enabled OC after that. Oh and the system was a bit unstable (like 1-2 bluescreens a month, and in the end it got worse) right from the beginning, but I was never able to nail down the root cause.
I have long abandoned Asus after two of my asus motherboards gets fried and that was 15 years ago.
After watching this I still would buy their products... I always buy their products and never had a minutes problem.. and many stores that sell motherboards around here also are clueless to this video or videos like this... They always say they must have got a bad board and the one guy that works at the micro center used to work for Asus... But you got to do what you got to do and I support you..
Also had some problems with Asus, since i went with Gigabyte, no more issues.
This is the reason I’m not buying the Asus ROG Ally .Crap customer service and poor hardware
Wow, those claims about them bending pins explains a lot.  I recently just paid $138 for an RMA on a Z790-F because of supposed "bent/damaged pins."  The funny thing was that it was impossible for that to have been the issue as the motherboard had been working for several months.  How does the motherboard stop working due to "bent pins" when the CPU is in the socket?  I ended up paying for it anyway since it was cheaper than buying a new board, but after getting the board back, it looks like it was swapped out for some other RMA'ed board with some weird sticky residue on the back of it.  Unfortunately, I ended up just buying another of the same board because the RMA was taking too long and not updating status, and I needed access to my computer.  Wish I could have seen videos like this a little earlier or else I would have gone with another brand.  To add on to this, when I first got the original board, I noticed something weird was happening with the voltage/wattage.  Whenever I tried to run Cinebench, the application would instantly crash(like zero seconds) and sometimes the computer would blue screen.  This was without messing with the settings.  From what I could tell, the temperatures were instantly spiking to 100 degrees and crashing.  There was absolutely no thermal throttling.  After looking in the bios, it appeared that ASUS had pretty much removed the wattage limit.  Rather then Intel's stock of 253W turbo, I believe it was well over 800W.  I have no idea what they were thinking doing this, and I am lucky that my chip didn't burn out.  Fortunately, they released a BIOS update, but even that appears to just be a lazy workaround that limits the CPU to 90 degrees when you could probably get a little more performance by running it slightly hotter.  And then of course there is the malware/bloatware that is Armory Crate that I refused to install the second time after being forced to reinstall Windows 11 due to a plethora of bugs.  I bought this board because I thought that ASUS was THE company that I could trust to buy a good motherboard from.  Yikes, was I wrong....
Asus is fking nuts, their Customer Support is just shit. Friend of mine got an rtx 3060ti from them, it gets to over 105C on the hotspot and starts to throttle and gets very loud and slow (nearly 1ghz) and they say its normal, wtf bro.
From A z To i always had Asus, but this gen (11th) for me i scored almost all the piece of the gundam (except the watercooling and the strix white screen). My 3080 GPU failed once, but the store had a spare. I manage to find a VG27AQGL1A ZAKU II EDITION and yet... it keep doing flicker. They didn't had anymore in stock and when doing the RMA they told me i'll receive the regular models that DOESN'T even have the same specs, they're lower. So return to the store  and refund. Now I put my hands on a ROG STRIX XG27A and you know what... MOTHER FREAKING FLICKERS!!!!!!!! At this point I'm just... not able to to do. I kep the screen in a box and waiting to find something else. From early 2010 to a full 8th gen intel build I had asus, but i don't know what the hell went wrong, but now i'm all in for avoiding them. This video is the last nail in the coffin.  I'm just sad.
Really impressive...once again Jayz integrity glistening in the sun.
I can say the same or worse about Lenovo. I had to change the motherboard in my X1 laptop 3 times! The last two times were because they put "new" defective MB there again and again, each time with a new problem. For the last service I had to send the laptop to a service center and it was there for weeks (despite on-site type of warranty, as it is quite an expensive business laptop), with no replacement provided of course. And finally, they managed to break a keyboard when doing the last service and because the warranty ended right by the time I received it from the last repair, they refused to admit or repair anything. Bad quality products and the quality of service is even worse.
@NorthridgeFix has multiple Asus laptops every day that he has to repair. Cheap mosfets, capacitors and power supplies lead to failed motherboards and sometimes blown CPUs
I refuse to buy anything Asus just because of the 5700xt.  They messed u0 so bad and my country doesnt have the same facilities to get the screws replaced. I had to wait 2 years just to get my 5700xt fixed. And its not. Its hot af and crashes my system. Fuck you Asus.
Respect on taking a stand
Really loved my crosshair Viii x570, definitely will be switching brands next time around
in whom to trust now??
NO MORE ASUS FOREVER. What a scumbag company...
Well done Jay that's why I watch here for years
This is So important for me. I've been using Intel, so evga MBs.  I've been planning a new rig since January to build this June. I'm going AMD so I was planning an Asus MB. Not Anymore.
what other NON ASUS boards in the same range as the z790 proArt supplies a Thunderbolt 4?
Being a pc content creator, which pc brands most boosted your career ?. If the problem is AMD's die wtf are you blaming Asus ? Because Asus wont warranty their product being broken by another manufacturers product ? When AMD should be covering the costs of the failures ?. I don't hear you say that you're going to drop AMD as one of your trusted sponsors ?. Has intels latest releases pushed AMDs manufacturing to far in the ratrace to be the best ? Are AMD users finally being humbled . . . . . Watching from the Blue team .......... Probably hi fives all round at intels board meetings atm. AGUNDIPSHTSTENCENTS
17:16 Clip and reply. This is Gold.
Asus has been getting it in their heads for quite some time, prices, low quality boards, phones and so on.... Finally is happening, Asus is going DOWN !
Gigabyte has issues, MSI has issues, now ASUS too.. EVGA left the market.. What's good has left to us in this world now?.. 😧
I've been using Asus for the past like 20+years and never once have I had an issue that Asus didn't back me up.  FYI, any Asus board you don't want feel free to send it my way.
Oh snap! It got real!!
MSI all the way.
When I first got started in PC building, Asus was the primium option at a primium price. Now i recommend Gigabyte and flippin' ASRock (no offense) over them. Sad (Trump Voice).
Asus mainboards are absolute crap. I had two mainboards for Intel both with stability problems and very long booting times. I gave them another chance because it regarded as premium brand and I couldn't believe they have such issues, I thought it is rather my misconfiguration. It is lowest quality for highest price. I'll never touch their crap again.
I don't know if they realize the stain they are putting on their brand. I was considering getting the Ally when it launched here since Steam still won't supply Australia, but now I don't know if I want to purchase from Asus because of all these issues.
Now im glad i built an all msi computer , my last two asus boards the rgb gave out
So glad I saw this video, ready for a rebuild will leave well alone.
I quit buying Asus stuff during the z77 chipsets because their prices were always higher yet they had cheap old chokes on their vrms.
Damn... I wanted both an Asus motherboard for my next PC and was considering an Asus gaming laptop for my portable device... Definitely a no for the motherboard and a probably not for the laptop now. Sad.
I just got an Asus Z790 Hero and while it works, this shit from them makes me want to stop getting Asus motherboards and switch.
MSI, Gigabyte, now ASUS.  So there's basically no brand left to buy?
👍
Bought an asus gaming laptop, found out that they were using cheap parts. So I returned it and got a Gigabyte. The nvme ssd that they use is 1.8 times faster than of asus despite being both being gen 4. Plus got a 3060 instead of a 3050ti at around the same price!
I sent them a brand new RTX 3090 still wrapped in plastic for an RMA. The GPU caused my PC to restart every time I put it under the slightest load. Made the mistake of sending it in the original retail box as well thinking I would get a replacement in the same condition since this thing was right out of the box. They sent me a scratched up pieced together replacement from their scrap parts bin. I was very upset. Had to spend weeks arguing with them and still didn't get a true replacement in the same condition. Glad to know they are picking used parts from different RMA'S and trying to resell them to other people as well. Totally unacceptable.
Holy smokes, what a fall from grace. I guess my next build will be ASRock or MSI 💀
My last ASUS was the Sandy/Ivy Bridge platform and after that switching from Intel to AMD made me go MSI instead. I think ASUS boards can be a bit overpriced for the feature and quality they give compared to other brands with similar specs.
It's not AMD. It's all we use in our game studio. 8 machines, all VR capable. 0 issues. We own no Asus but one board we just bought... guess which one? Smelt terrible for hours after we tried to host a tiny MMO server for 60 minutes. With nobody in it. Just for Ai NPC dev. 1 was running. 🤦‍♂  The dev team is all tech certified on top of it.   Anyways... we use random types of custom rigs for testing, we swap parts around and try different combos to see graphics differences FPS etc, glitches etc. Always rotating in and out new rigs, as we sell the others or scrap them for parts. Asus just gone down hill, that's all.  Nothing to do with AMD. You couldn't pay us to use Intel... gross.... those are for office machines and secretaries...  🤣🤣🤣  We will remove them from our testing field, and put a asus not tested or recommended for on our game notes in the future. We won't buy another board that cooks a CPU. So we can send it off and wait 6 weeks for a new one. And a processor. It's a good thing my CPU guy knows about this or I'd be paying for that too out my own pocket. Idiots. I don't even want a replacement they burned me for 900 bucks. Cool you got 900 bucks, it will be the last too. I won't risk catching the entire studio on fire because asus is on a bender or something. Sometimes you just gotta cut your losses, and kick em to the curb.
$
I ran with an msi for 10 almost 11 years
I Salute you for stnading up for us all
It seems Asus is more focused on their handheld shenanigans than the computer parts anymore.
And this is why Australian customer consumer laws are amazing, ASUS can't pull this shit, because they're still liable for warranty under Australian law.
Haven't had a single issue with Asus products. These recent issues seem to be AMD related products. I have only used Intel based, and also have never done overclocking, so I guess i'm lucky. Been running a Prime Z790M and a Proart Z690 mobos. Rock solid.
so what about their Asus rog ally????
Glad I went with MSI with my current build this time around.
Asus mini mesh router - 1 of 3 power bricks failed within a month of purchase. 3 months of email tag to get a $8 brick replaced on a $300 router setup.  Asus RoG Strix Laptop - GL702VM - if updated to the latest Bios (Not a beta) and you have a Samsung SSD installed the laptop WILL NOT POST. Only cure is roll it ack and prevent windows from updating it again. I was interested in the Zenbook Pro Duo but hell no, no more Asus products, not until Asus fix their issues. As you say, stuff happens to every brand, it's how they deal with those issues that matters, and Asus evidently couldn't care less.
@JayZTwoCents You need to check your AM4 boards to see how accurate their SoC Voltages are, because your USB and audio issues sound like what a ton of AM4 users complained about in the past, usually with a new motherboard fixing the issue. Has this been going on longer than anyone knew?
Surprisingly asus and asrock used to be one once.
ASUS= HOT MESS... Get it together man!
I’ve mainly done previous builds using MSI or Gigabyte, and a big reason was because Asus was too expensive. I finally went with Asus on a new personal build in 2021 using a Z590E and a ROG Strix 3070. Three bad motherboards (one free Asus RMA nightmare included) and one bad GPU later (thank God for Asurion) and I was done being their cust- victim. I think this is what eventually has to happen - companies are just fine with Chinese-grade manufacturing quality and just keeps going until consumers finally say ENOUGH!!! and their business will go up in flames.
I found Asus products to be less than what it should be. I have stopped buying.
Funny...I've always held ASUS in a pretty high regard. Every time I'm shopping for a part, I check their offerings first. In moving to AM5, I was thinking I will use ASUS over Gigabyte. Thankfully I had not made the purchase yet. I think I will instead go with AsRock.
I had a similar problem. I sent back a board for RMA because the cpu power socket was bad. They sent me back a board that wouldn’t even power on. Check with the power supply’s. I was told they would send me another board but I had to pay shipping.
This is such a tantrum.
Jay I've have been telling people and customers to stay away from Asus since the P4 days. The same quality problems, instability, and terrible support for decades. The fan boys have always been fervently attacking me for saying this, but in 20 years of building machines I've only seen these severe of issues from Asus and Biostar.
Not the first time asus selling garbage amd stuff, rx5700 / XT, worst model to buy, tuf - tiny metal sheet to cool memory doesnt work and 110+ C was very common, TUF 5700xt wrong lenght of cooling screw - problem with temps, and 5700 dual, absolute worst 5700 you can get, fans are garbage quality, I had 6 5700 asus duals and I had to send 3 for warranty issues - 2 broken fans and 1 card just died. Personally lost confidence long time ago fo SHI$SUS and I will never buy NOTHING from them.
It's about time someone's starting to see how terrible ASUS has been for over 20 years now.
i love my b550 asrock steel legend. has been nothing but reliable.
Asus with hes ROG products, has become a garbage. My Asus Rog laptop had it's entire display replaced after 2 years and 5 months. The guarranty was only 2 years. It cost me half of the laptop value to replace a 2k 17 inch 244 Hz display. Fuk Asus. I have a 10 years old laptop at work and works just fine, as comparisson.
This earns you all the credit they've burned.  We need you guys to test all your boards for safety - how can anyone trust budget boards, if the high end ones have no working safety features?
Nice to know.  I would have looked for an ASUS otherwise.  My P6TV2  has been solid, aside from a problem with one fan quitting very early.  Had no trouble getting it replaced.    Not even sure how old it is now.
I have always had trouble with ASUS boards since the first computer I ever built back in the late '90s, early 2000's. I always stayed away from them because of stability issues. I've recently inherited 3 ASUS boards. 2 am3+, 1 am4. Luckily the AM4 board is good so far even though I had to jump through hoops to get windows to install on my NVME drive, but the 2 am3 boards only worked for a short period of time before the sound died. I've always bought gigabyte or MSI, and never had an issue from them.
Appreciate you have the balls to go against arrogant Asus
I used to be hardcore ASUS motherboards for their quality. However, my last few builds have been AMD Ryzen based and I have been using MSI motherboards with them. They have all been great so far, but I wasn't aware ASUS had been declining in quality. Glad to learn that so I can avoid them on future builds unless they clean up their act. Also thanks for mentioning that Asrock boards have retained their quality. Have never used one but they do have some interesting motherboards available.
I've recently started having issues with my ASUS boards audio. Windows will no longer detect the onboard audio. It is very frustrating.
Asus is cutting from liers Youtubers. All youtubers are liers for money
I was a big Asus Gene fan-- loved the board from gen 1 through gen 6, but when the prices kept soaring I was done. I've been on AMD & Asrock ever since and haven't looked back. The latest Gene goes for what?! 600 bucks!  "Buck Off-- Asus!!"
OMG. Whose left, Gigabyte seem to be screwing things up with RMA policies and PSU explosions. ASUS messing up motherboards/CPUs and crapping on the customer........ ASRock, MSI please be good with your motherboards and customers. There aren't many of you left now.
Love you Jay, but.., I don't think you burning bridges this early is a good idea. You should have given them an ultimatum or a warning first.
good hardware hahha yaa thats funny i have a asus rogg14 2021 5900hs 3060 144hz screen laptop         and is dao dead cause i dident know about the battery trap and tried to over clock the ram from 2666mhz cause i dident read the whole page on amazon to make sure i was getting 3200mhz 32gb sodumm            and also i guess more people have killed this laptop and ones like it dou to the main battery plug metal clip flying out and shorting the bored   so yaa now i hafe to wait like 6 mounts to build up that money to replace it        cause dont seam it can be fixed i have one more play to see about
damn i just bought my ROG STRIX 4090 OC   :(
Fuck ASUS and I'm all for it
Well shoot, I guess my next build will have to be a Biostar. /s Seriously though, hasn't MSI also been found doing shady crap - i.e., scalping their own video cards?
I'd like to find out is it specifically the ROG CROSSHAIR that does it or is it over the whole range? I'm asking before I buy the ROG Strix B550-A gaming. It's a bit of a present for my wife that wants a complete white build of a PC.
im gonna build my pc in 1 week and i was gonna get an asus mobo but now im scared.....im gonna use the 7700x because the 3d chips are not realy safe to use.
100% Asus smashes pins I had it happen 2 times
i just got an asus board last year for my 12th gen intel, now im worried. its the white rog strix,
was going to get the Ally until i saw this plus the sticky x that Linus said
I have to be honest. I already watched Steve's video on calling out ASUS. I am due this summer to build a new rig, and they were my go-to. I mean, the system that my daughter built has an ASUS MB that I bought for her. My current rig and her past rig ran (Same board, similar builds) ran 3rd Gen chips. I'm currently still using that motherboard with a i7-3770K chip. But it looks like I have to find another brand now, as my next board won't be ASUS. I'm gun shy of MSI and Gigabyte because of the PCI riser fires and exploding CPUs. Looks like it's ASROCK's turn.
Rofl i had stability issues with msi years ago and lots of bad boards, switched to asus and i was still unstable, ive been building systems from 386 cpus and intel overdrives cyrix chips right up to intel i9 -13900k on launch date i ended up realizing Gigabyte and as u said asrock are way better options !!!! asrock transformed around the i7 7700k period for high end boards
There's a handful of channels that are this dedicated to the public.  And that's what makes them worthy of watching.  Great job Jay.  As a custom computer builder since the early 90s, I'll make sure to educate everyone I build systems for about the downgrade of ASUS quality and service. Keep it up!  I wouldn't mind seeing more on EVGA myself.
Appreciate you taking a strong stance with this.  I basically walked away from Asus years ago as they were not really offering the features I wanted at a price I was willing to pay. I was building more with Supermicro, Intel back when they still made motherboards, and oddly enough ASRock, which I've had really good luck with asides from a couple boards that would randomly decide they didn't want to use XMP settings after reboots. When it came time to build an AM4 gaming rig, I went with one of their TUF B550 boards and was frankly unimpressed with the BIOS and how comparatively slow it posts, which was surprising. I have another Asus board that is more a workstation machine that is quite unremarkable, but clearly not for gaming and it's fine, but they haven't really done anything to make me a regular customer. This latest fiasco is just more reasons not to bother with them.
Shame, I generally prefer Asus Motherboards for my builds, looks like MSI or Gigabyte next build, shame really.
No one has dragged their name in the dirt more than asus?  Gigglebit.... Please, don't forget gigglebit.  They're infamous for this.
You are 100% dead on. It makes me sad because it’s the only brand whose designs and bios UI that I like. Their quality control has gone to shit and their customer service has been shit for quite some time now. I had an x99 board go bad on me. Power delivery took a shit, caps blew and took my processor with it. They blamed it on me for running XMP. Then after some back and forth they agreed to RMA. First board I received several weeks later had thermal paste all over the socket. Asked for another board, board that came after that was scratched and had bent chipset heatsinks. Sold the board on eBay as is for a loss and had to buy another. I lost a couple of months of time going back and forth with them. They really do treat their customers like trash…And dummy me kept buying their products because of design and aesthetics. I know this happened many generations of hardware ago but I never forgot this terrible experience. The worst customer service experience I’ve ever had with a tech company. Intel on the other hand were complete champions and replaced my burned proc with no hassle and no bs back and forth over many emails.    Really not sure what board I will get when I upgrade later this year, never liked MSI and  have never had much faith in Gigabyte. Built some machines for friends with their boards in the past. Their RMA process/ refurb quality control sucks too! Thanks for speaking up Jay! Hopefully this encourages them to take a look at what they are doing wrong and work to actually improve these issues for their customers.
00:40 That's how you run a YouTube channel, thumbs up!
I agree ASUS has F’d up pretty big but the vsoc issue is not solely on them.  Other board manufacturers have issues and Amd is not without blame here.  I think jay may be too close to this one seeing as how he is invested into the am5 platform on a personal level.
I've got an ASUS TUF z790 plus D5 board. So far the issues I've gotten are that I can't enable XMP period or it won't post and boot. And I can't install the RAM in the A2 B2 slot or it won't boot either. Only in the A1 and B1 slots. Any time I do, I have to CMOS the board just to get it to boot.
I've used Asus motherboards for years and have now installed one from Biostar and I'm really satisfied. Great value for money.
This sucks.  I've generally liked ASUS and bought a lot of their stuff in the past.
Jay you are absolutely right about the graphics card division of Asus.  I've used Asus graphics cards for years and they've been basically bulletproof.  I can't say the same for their motherboards;  I've never really had any good experience with any of their motherboards.  I've been building PCs for quite a while, and in my opinion, MSI and EVGA have been some of the best board vendors for my builds.  I've tried asus boards and have had issues with almost every single one of them.  Kudos to you and for other tech channels like GamersNexus for standing up for the consumer on this matter.
I bought 2 ASUS CPU coolers. Both had 1 fan that squeeked like a mouse being run over by a steamroller. That's 2 fans out of 6. Like Jayz said, the designs beautiful, but QA sucks a dangling donkey d__k. This is a problem with Large Corporations. They are so large they can get away with ripping off the consumer with out a care in the world. Last year we bought a dishwasher. It lasted 2 weeks and stopped working. Called LG, sent a tech out who broke a part off and then left saying he needed a part and would be back in a week. Never showed, never called. Called LG, and welcome to script hell. One lame excuse after another. Blatantly lying. Oh you have a mouse problem. Called an exterminator, no Mice. Oh, its a known fact that the US doesn't provide quality electricity so its NOT our fault, you need to rewire the entire electric grid. Fuck LG, your warranty ain't worth shit.
After YEARS of using Gigabyte boards I got sick of their BIOS GUI.  It's not bad, just annoying AF.  So this time I was going to go with ASUS, but decided MEG X670E ACE looked better to me and got it.  SOOOO F'ing glad I did!!!  Edit: I dunno if it's ASUS....sound issues are the realm of Windows.  Constant broken sound.  Windows still kills my Creative sound card in this machine and then I spend a while trying fix it again.
Much Respect
Even I have pretty much sworn off ASUS from now on. For context, I had an EVGA 1060 since 2016 until 2023. I got an ASUS Dual RX 6750XT, the coil whine was incredible, I ended up switching it for another one and same issue AGAIN.  I ended up returning that as well and went with a MSI Trio X for $30 extra, not a peep out of it and so happy with it.   Bye ASUS, you and your coil whine will not be missed.
Told ya so FOMO's!! MSI/AM4 Forever...
This makes me depressed, my computer is 4 years old, still going well but aging. My last 3 computers were with Asus motherboards and in my mind Asus was most reliable company for pc products.
Your support experience with ASUS is what the rest of us deal with for ANY brand.  Welcome to our world.
Didn't Gigabye Just go thru this? This sounds oddly familier.. /S
Dag Bro, Jay Just Laid Down The Law!
Why are you blaming Jesus for an ASUS problem?
That warranty-voiding bit smacks of attorneys sitting in a board meeting. Thanks for your video. I had been eyeing Asus for when I decide to replace my current-but-aging model MSI board down the road.
I get what you are saying about ASUS! This especially burns because of the amount of money shelled out for their hardware. I was a ASUS fanboy, but lately, it has been one let down after another. Thanks for the much needed nail in the coffin.
Brave attitude. Unfortunately I bought a Asus MB two months ago. Hope it doesn't die
Laying down the heat. Good. Any company or brand deserves to be burned at the stake for any level of jackassery. I'm out on Asus as well. Not proud of MSI either... Or Gigabyte...
This makes me happy I haven’t had any issues with the ASUS products I’ve gotten.
This is kid of a bummer because i really like the ROG line and branding. But after watching this I may just have to switch. Not a huge MSI fan but may have to look their way..
By the way, it's funny how MSI's being praised a lot, the MSI Titan Laptop has a Bios Update that just outright bricks the machine. GizmoSlipTech is struggling with it right now.
Kudos and a big ass bow Jay..  you and the guys again holding your principles for yourselves and the consumer. Thank you
Great video.
God finally,  I've had so many issues ASUS RMA and personally I believe they bricked my gaming laptop I purchased from them to force me to purchase another. Never will buy their products again.
I have had issues with Asus before. They tucked tail and ran wanting money one week out do warranty. Fuck them
I have ASROCK and never ever ever had any problems i can even make shitty games look good as if the devs did it haha  annnnnnddddd guess what its a asrock phantom 4 gaming x570 crossfire  and i use a ryzen 9 5900x ...... never ever any problems and i game on a samsung 43inch hdr tv , turn on fast vsync in my evga nvidia rtx 3080 cx3 and bam ! i get 115-125fps with no tearing on a tv thats 60hz ..........
I have been go through the same issue with Asus Extreme vi  board, after 2 or 3 time replacement I gave up on the brand, they used be good but now a days they are not so good.
I got a $350 with amd with a i5 core from asus brand new ! There product is not only good but affordable…. Not sure why this guy is hating on them…
Disappointing. ASUS and Gigabyte used to be my go-to brands...
I have always hated how overpriced their products are, especially the “rog” stuff so 💀😶‍🌫️
Should I avoid ASUS GPUs as well ?
I have an asrock x670 taichi mobo and a arock 7900xt taichi and they work FLAWLESSLY. Asrock will be quick to take asus's spot hopefully
Hey Jay,   I just upgraded my board to ASUS and I think it may have killed my 3070. Want to take a crack at it?
Hello @JayzTwoCents can I get one or those x670e from you how much you want for it ?
I congratulate JayzTwoCents on taking this stand against a manufacturer that has shown contempt for their customers.
All I can say is these companies gauging everyone deserve the day they've gotten themselves.
my am5 buld for my rig and my wife rigs is both msi mother boards / had asus in the past but im like ya know what / msi looks powerful n seems like a cool compney / 6 moths in and so far not one issues
I recently had to return an AMD ASUS machine because the USB ports would make electric arcs and crash the machine every time I plugged something in. I'm glad I got a refund. Thank you for this info I almost made another mistake, Think I'll be going with MSI now.
I've had Asus mobos (2) for like 10 years now. I usually buy Asus GPUs when possible. I've honestly not even considered a different mobo brand with my last upgrade. I guess I'll have to find a different brand to become familiar with.
Um.....MSI's private keys that they use to sign Firmware updates was stolen by malicious actors.  So I wouldnt' say moving to MSI is a safe bet.  I have all MSI as well and every system that has its firmware signed by those keys could be compromised and new bios flashed.  No bueno.
Good on you, you’ll never go wrong repping the end users like this, especially means a lot because of your situation.  I still root for asus to make a comeback but I had to stop using many of their products due to quality issues and warranty support experiences over the past few years that didn’t exist over a decade ago when I was a very loyal client.  Msi and gigabyte have been decent for my clients since I switched.  I imagine they have a diseconomy of scale which can happen to any successful company but with your take and GN as well, I hope they reflect and make substantial changes.  I predict it won’t be fast but will see what happens
Who here discovered this gem during covid? Just wanted to say thanks for everything you do and for giving me  the confidence to build my first ever rig.  P.S.  I miss the 3000 series videos lol
I miss evega we lost a brand that supported enthusiast and the common hard working gamer a trust that was built over years. Now modiocre is the norm.
Its true..i once returned a 4k monitor worth 2500 $ and it had these gray vertical bars on the screen like some burnt in shadow marks.  Then i wrote several mails to the supporters and they could not see these bars..It endet up with a war but i won and got my money back..they are so high up on ther horzes that they cant see the ground anymore..
Asus is a Japanese company. 🇯🇵🇯🇵
Agree with this 100%... My Asus x670e gaming wifi has been nothing but instability problems
doesn't he get these for free?
literally i never spoken their name as aZues always aSus (a suspicious manufacturer) since the days of socket 7.
as a total ASUS fanboy looking to rebuild my 8700k and 2080ti water cooled build, this hurt to hear.
No EVGA, no ASUS on this channel anymore, what's left? Gigabyte, MSI? Some Corsair here and there... idk
I have been using ASRock motherboards since the Z77 Extreme 6, am on an X370 Tieche that I got in 2017 that is on the fourth generation of CPUs (1600X, 2700, 3800X and 5800X). Back then I also built a PC for a grandson on the ASRock Z77 Extreme 6, and later a B450. My wife's PC also has an ASRock B450.
Its hard to hear this. I recently bought a ROG g15 laptop but hopefully I don't encounter any issues in the near future. I was also looking to buying the Ally. Here's to hoping that they improve in the future
I so agree with Asus brand. I'm from the Philippines. Had terrible experience with a different range of products. My laptop n61jv built in webcam stopped working in less than a year and I did not get a replacement. My nexus 7 display flickered within 1 week and they did not replace it but they repaired it. It took 2 months to get back the Nexus 7. Screen was fixed but camera is not working. My motherboard Asus ROG impact 8 mini ITX went faulty after a year so it is out of warranty. I just feel like all Asus devices have poor quality that it fails early. The only product from Asus that is still working is my monitor PG279q.  I am never trusting this brand again and I just avoid buying stuff from them even thought their laptop looks good but I am scared buying their product. Imagine out of the 4 product I bought 3 failed so early. My iPad and my iPhone are all more than 5 years still working like a champ with updated software. Asus should focus on user retention by making a quality product. As for me they lost me forever and I am never ever gonna trust any product with Asus brand. if someone ask me for recommendation like my family, friends and co worker, I just advise them to avoid Asus because it fails early on. I just feel like it fails more than others.
Shame you didn’t fire them sooner I wonder if they signed the contract we wouldn’t of heard you bitch about them , 6 years too late Asus has always had crap customer care
Hi why my computer shut off when I launch the steam game sometimes?
Spot on, they make a great looking product, shitty performing product.
i finished my rog asus themed build this past xmas i was so proud of it and i still kinda am (yay me!)) but if i knew then what i know now about asus i would have gone for something else holy that is soooo scummy what asus has been doing lately.
I fired Asus many years ago… maybe 10 or more years ago. It was as bad a ultra cheap brands where I need to buy 3 to get a working machine without a strange issue. My last board was a p67 and even that would hang every time the machine went to sleep. I’ve been using Asrock. Gigabyte was marginally better. Been really happy with asrock but their warranty sucks if you don’t buy from new egg. I found out if you buy from Amazon or open box forget about trying to get a warrenty.
My Z590 Prime board has been a pain in the a$$ and so pfucking done with Asus Armory Crate. Luckily AI Suite is still available. My wife's MSI Z590 Gaming edge has been great. BUT we did have two MSI Z590 Pro boards die within 6 months before she got the Gaming Edge.....
ASUS was never the same since they moved their manufacturing to China. Prime and STRIX are just pure junk for the cost and all their higher end components end up in Maxlmus or Crosshair. I've been done with them for the past few years now. I could care less what anyone else has to say on YouTube, because the arguments will just come from the sheeple within the ASUS community.
From my personal experience, Asus has the absolute dog shit of a support for years now, and I really believe their support is by far the worst in the industry, but it helped their products were usually high quality with (relatively) low failure rate. But if this is how they are treating Jay, just imagine what kind of BS they are pulling on "the little guy".  Kudos Jay, it takes real integrity to do what you just did, and not too many people out there would do what you did.
Asus is DONE.
I don't disagree with this at all. I myself have always been an MSI fan, all the way back to my first build in 1999.
Damn, my current PC is all Asus, and was about to upgrade everything on it as well. Looking like I need to find another brand to go with. Too bad EVGA isn’t making anymore GPU’s.
I used to be a huge ROG fan but the last thing i bought from them years ago was a Maximus Hero VII back when the 4790k was a big deal. I had no end of issues with that board and it was not the first time. simple things like XMP profiles not working and causing blue screens were just some of the issues.  i had bought those ROG boards since the crosshair days when the 1100t was a big thing from AMD, but since then it always felt like i was spending more and more money but not getting anything but the "honor/prestige" of owning a name brand product in return. after that experience with the Hero VII i decided to jump ship and look into alternate options. since then i've been pleasantly impressed by both AsRock as well, who i also considered more of a "stay away from" brand and Gigabyte, who i never really had any issues with. i have two PC's right now and both are Gigabyte systems.
As someone with literally an asus phone and im typing this with it. Wonder if it will fry my hands with enough genshin gameplay when it heats up lmao
danm jay put straight lets goooo
Hey Jay! So i got an Asus z790e just after it came out. I installed it and noticed that at the top of the motherboard just under the vrm cooler the motherboard was warped. It was bowed right under where the vrm cooler was attached. I also noticed that under the vrm cooler the thermal pads that were installed were kind of folded over. I contacted asus for what is honestly one of my worst customer service experiences ever. They basically told me they only warranty failures and that they would do nothing. I got another one. Same thing. Same bowing. Then i got the ryujin 360 aio. It showed up with a fan controller that had a broken port for the power connection. The board that the pcie power plug plugged onto was cracked in half. The ryujin was on intergalactic back order so i got it to work very janky and just kept it. Again basically told they wouldnt do anything. I think i'm done with asus too? That really changed quickly. I went from kinda brand loyal to nope in a very short time. What gives?
yeah i've been AMD too and i'm over it, i'm moving back to intel for my next build.
The last few products I tried from Asus were DFOA, and I refuse to buy MSI again based on how they scalp their own products
Lets not forget, they released the ROG ally today too. Im sure nothing will go wrong with their little tiny compact handheld! of course not.
TBF, who couldn't have seen a company with cringey branding like 'Republic of Gamers' being shady.
Again like other industries a purge NEEDS to happen
Looks like I'll be going with MSI or Gigabyte mobos from now on. I still have my maximus hero x, and that runs like a dream...never had an issue with it
I liked especially the last sentence. I realy hope they start to care but i don't belive they will, at least this year. I hope I'm wrong and they start to care.
Market capitalization of ASUS (2357.TW) Market cap: $6.91 Billion As of May 2023 ASUS has a market cap of $6.91 Billion. This makes ASUS the world's 1899th most valuable company
GRANDSTANDING???
Good on you, Jay! As we say in Australia, "Keep the bastards honest!"
I am defending ASUS, but you definitely exaggregate too much in this video.
I'd been a frequent Asus customer in the past, but stopped a while back.   Basically their products have declined so much that it's pretty likely you'll need their 'support', which is does anything but - if they respond at all.
Been watching your videos for 10  years.  Thank you for standing up against this BS.  Subscribed + liked.
Been with Asus for well over a decade now and had no issues with thier products, originally my go to brand for motherboards  was ABIT, I miss those guys but since they disappeared I switched to Asus and I've never had an issue (touch wood). I am really disappointed with what's going on here and I personally think there is something very wrong with the latest AMD platform, seems like they rushed it out a little too quick without ironing out all the kinks but Asus needs step up here and  fix this situation and their customer service needs a serious shake up, what happened to the days when the customer was always right?
Damn it ASUS,
I have been going back and forth with ASUS for almost a month for a Motherboard replacement because Ram slot #1 died randomly after three months and they argued with me that my ram wasn’t compatible with the board
13:55 *shifts nervously and looks at his ASRock motherboard*
Fvcking ASUS, another good company gone to trash.
I’ve been mining for 5ish years. The only failures I’ve had is on 3 graphics card fans. When a fan goes bad I replace all of the fans on that card. All three cards that had fans fail were asus cards. No issues other than that. I have never had an issue with their motherboards or anything else.
I have only had 1 issue with ASUS and they took care of it, thankfully. I had set up a PW to access BIOS and my laptop and wanted it gone. After looking over their site, and finding the instructions, I logged in using the BIOS password then changed the NEW and CONFIRM fields to blanks. After which I could no longer do anything with it, made a pretty coaster. Micro Center was unable to fix it and ASUS came through with a "one time product issue" fix that came down to replacing my MB.
I’m in my third b550 luckily under warranty. But damn.
We need more public figures and "influencers" to act like this. Companies would be scared straight, if this was the publicity they all got, all over the web. Keep it up, and kudos!
Do you feel the same about their laptops?
I stopped buying Asus products after 2018, products went downhill in terms of reliability and the prices went sky high. I trust Gigabyte boards now and they've been rock solid for me.
What are your thoughts on the ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Extreme AMD AM4 X570S EATX? Sadly, this is not uncommon in the computer industry. Sony released updates back in the PS3 era that would brick systems and wouldn't claim responsibility for the update they released that left systems functionless... personal experience 😑
I purchased a used Asus rog strix b550 f gaming wifi ii motherboard from amazon warehouse on april 18th, tried it a few weeks later with new ram, cpu, new case & psu. got the orange dram light, so couldnt post. messaged asus, they said the ram wasnt qvl tested. so decided to return the board to amazon on 4th may for a refund, still heard nothing. so i did message amazon & they said its waiting to be scanned & processed at the fullfilment centre. Going to MSI myself, Tomahawk is tempting at the price or the wifi version. new pc builder too.
I've had a nightmare ASUS B550m plus wifi. I suspect votltage issues or spikes causing 5800X instability. I RMA'd first CPU, second CPU died in 2 months RMA'd again 3rd CPU same instability.  I wondered if ever Windows patch caused issues and sometimes a BIOS or Chipset update a couple of weeks later would fix it.  It has been stable after 2 years of trying since Feb more or less, so been avoiding Windows updates.  Mobo was last on the parts to replace list, ASUS as a rev 2 but never said anything wrong with mine.  However all over AMD forums was people with my board and mostly and MSI board and a couple with Gigabyte, mostly all mid range boards.
I will still stand by Asus never had issues with there tuf line and there warranty is very good. Rog is just overpriced rgb
I've been using ASUS for as long as I can remember. My last build ended up being an MSI rig.
I bought a Asus rog phone 3 and it bricked after a year. Now I have a Samsung and couldn't be happuer6.   Needless to say I only buy Asus products that doesn't require os level software (cause their software is @$$, looking sideways at the ally). Have a 60% keyboard works fine and is a quality product 🤷
I own a lot of Asus products and mostly had no major problems with them but the recent events of how shady and crappy Asus handles their paying customers.... I'll be stopping buying any Asus products from now on until they owe up to their faults. 😔
I bought Asus vivobook 15 which comes with HDD expansion kit, I didn't receive the kit(which does not sale separately, you can not buy it anywhere coz ASUS DOESN'T SELL IT SEPARATELY IN INDIA!!!) ...the reps at customer support kept saying it doesn't say it on the box... they kept insisting that it doesn't comes with the laptop and they were not accepting the return.....extremely disappointed with ASUS. this is 3rd time they've disappointed me.
I always saw Asus ROG as the coolest brand for the longest time. Nothing really stays constant isn’t it.
yeah honestly, I had an x570 tuf gaming and had a TON of issues with it. half the time I cleared CMOS It would also wipe my bios profiles. had a fancy list of advanced features that didn't work, and must I bring up the atrocity that is armory crate (which btw every time my bios profiles got wiped i had to deal with that garbage auto installing itself lmao)  switched to an msi x570 meg ace and that boards been awesome.   say what you will about MSI but they generally make good boards.
just use an asrock in your build and keep the amd chip my dude. :)
With ASUS losing face, which brand make the best boards and components now?
HOORAY!!!  i like someone who speaks his mind !!!  keep going dude  !!!
Well well I guess it's the time for Asus to fall from PC world after their failed attempts on their phone products aswell.
Yes the second you go livestream there's "an advertisement". 😜🤦‍♂
First EVGA ditches NVidia, now Asus officially sucks... What's next?  Cyrix coming out with a CPU twice as fast as anybody else?
Sad as my Asus GPU and monitor have been good. It’s really sad to see this issue. I will be avoiding AMD and Asus my next build.
Yep, ASUS user for... 20+ years. Not anymore.
It's a shame.  I rebuilt most of my PC in 2019, and went big into asus.  X570 prime pro in white, asus laptop, all asus monitors.  I was actually very happy with my asus products.  The asus monitors replaced some old crappy dell trash bin monitors and an acer monitor I didn't hate but was just meh with the menu on, an MSI mobo that just felt meh (it was a 370, to be fair) but their menus, UI, and quality was rock solid.  Shame they went this far down since.
you're the guy Jay, congrats I appreciate the HONESTY OF PEOPLE, things that are being lost little by little in today's greedy days and world.
ok noted. Avoid Asus and search GOOD Brands, not PAID Brands.
I use MSI and Gigabyte and ASROCK for motherboards
Well, I'm glad I didn't buy. Now I'll look elsewhere. Thank god all this has happened now. I'm a week away for a new build, and I was looking at Asus. Sorry for anyone that I'd stuck with this crap.
Well damn. I have new 13900k build with the Asus Z790 plus wifi board. It is  running DDR5 and this thing is crashing 6 times a night with some games it should not struggle with.  I have been going through ideas others have suggested for 7 weeks.  My other 3 Asus boards have been running very well over the years.  Time will tell if I can get it figured out.
time to switch to MSI and GIGABYTE
My AsRock Z790 RS Pro board has be AsRock solid as well Jay. ;)
So disappointing, I have only done 2 builds in my life and both have been solid ASUS (ROG) boards. Who do I choose now for the next build! Who can we trust!!
As anyone been talking about their laptops? I work at The Geek Squad and we get more asus laptop is than any other brand.
You can tell the views on these channels are declining when they need to make drama about everything 24/7. "Asus motherboards are EXPLODING!" shut up please.
We move Thousands of ASUS mobos cards etc, down inDIGITALIFE in Mexico and our assesment is completely opposite as yours! In our own experience the very best to get 100 fold is ASUS as a brand, and the rest are simply ordinary somewhat well made tems such as EVGA and the likes. We simply will not risk using anything that is not ASUS, so stop the bullsh😮t😊
And then Amd does not seem so crappy anymore. With all the  sugarcoating and redirection problem is still amd
This ASUS fanboy just ordered an Alienware. ASUS design decisions and quality have degraded. From bad port placement, horrible backlight issues and fans rattling on laptops that have been treated with great care. I have just sold my 2022 M16 and I am done with ASUS anymore.
Thats why my laptop goes 3500mhz at silent mode
Man, I remember my first pc build was an ROG, it ran like a dream, how the mighty has fallen. I'm looking 2 upgrade and switch to AMD in like 6 months, I just hope all of this is sorted by then.
This video was so hot I think my monitor melted. :)
Haven't built with ASUS in years. My first board away from ASUS was asrock x370 taichi, which I hesitantly purchased, but it's been fantastic. Will go with asrock again in my next build.
Nice. I'm glad I choose gigabyte mobo with 12700k. I now FRI KIN HATE GIGABYTE BIOS AND RGB FUSION BS.  I used 3 msi boards before for i5 4460, 7700k,8700k and to tell you brother, msi bios was rock solid,way ahead of gigabitos. But still glad I didn't go to asus.
I mean hey if you don’t want any of those motherboards I’ll have one 😅
Fake News
First i want to start off by saying thanks for the work you do for our community. That being said as an average consumer the best way to be heard is by the allocation of your hard earned money. I will not be buying anything Asus going forward and i am not one who buys every 5-10 years i upgrade regularly (various components and parts) so i might only be one individual but with videos like this and that of other channels in our community i think our voices might be heard
I did an rma in june of 2022 and it wasn't until February that i finally got a new board i recieved 7 bad rma boards that were refurbished boards and they were all bad 6 in a row all of them were x299 strix e gaming ii boards after sending a rampage omega in they gave me the strix 2 with bent pins one even had a x99 chipset when it was labled lga2066 basically showing me they can swap any socket they want onto a board even with bent pins they cam fix it After 6 bad boards they finally sent a z690 hero to replace the original  x299 rampage vi omega that was 1100$
I will NEVER buy another Strix product again and I’ve spent probably $10,000 over the years on Strix stuff…they won’t get my business again.
Jay, again thank you for for being our voice!!!
I found out recently that their RMA process is garbage, and that was only for a failed fan on a 3060 that came with a pre-built PC. I had a bad connection with one of their CSRs, and after they said "please hang up and I will call you right back", they fucking ghosted me.
Shame I always used asus motherboards
and yes thats me with a 7700x build with a x670e rog and a z690e rog sitting to build :( and yes i have blue screens on my 7700x build, though it was amd prob. but now i know is asus prob
y'all who buy $1000 motherboards are part of the problem.
"Dragged," not "drug."
Hay Jayz, just got an e-mail from ASUS welcoming this gamer by the name of  CouRageJD is that ASUS's way of replacing you? No loyalty from ASUS!
FOIA only applies to federal entities, FYI.
Of course and asus will do something because a youtuber called them out even tho for so many years they been giving bad service
I've said this since 2016 and no one listens till youtubers say something, I even remember trying to rma my gpu and said it was on a custom liquid loop so my warranty wasn't there and this was asus
Back in January I got a 800 dollar board from Asus which had an issue that I didn't see until I had it put together and it wouldn't post. I spent hours troubleshooting, I eventually took the cpu off and started actually looking at the pins under a microscope. Turns out a couple pins weren't just bent, they were folded over. I also noticed a couple odd scratches on the board itself that I didn't see before and from what I could tell it looked like someone dropped something on the fucking thing and still sent it out. I returned it in exchange for another and haven't had any issues since. What irritated me the most is that I had spent $3,000 on a computer that I couldn't even use for a week waiting on another board because Asus fucked up. Next time I upgrade I'm staying clear of any Asus products because that straight up should not have happened and despite the computer has worked flawlessly for 5 months I'm still salty about it. I guess it is what it is.
I have a Z690 Strix DDR5 motherboard with my 13700K. Haven't had any issues yet but this video makes me nervous about it lol
my current motherboard is an asus, moving to gigabyte after this, gonna give them a try
I’ve spent so many hours troubleshooting my new build that its made me not even want to go into my office… 7800X3D and Asus MB… this hurts my brain 😩😩😩😩
Gigabyte: Why were supposed to be the Example, not follow it!  ASUS: I HATE YOU!   MSI: Your sponsors left, turning to Asrock, EVGA, and Biostar  ASUS: NOOOOOO!
crap I just bought a refurbished 670e board
Does this only apply to amd boards or intel as well?
I have an Asus ROG 570x-e STRIX. That -E was supposed to mean that its a wireless board. This is NOT true. The wireless hardly works. It will somehow forget it even has one and when it does, only the bluetooth seems to do anything.... until it too is lost to the void.  Seriously never thought it'd be this bad. Never again.
If theres one thing that makes my whiskers twinkle its a good JayzTwoCents video.
thats a huge + rep for you as a creator. Glad you are not one of the greedy ones
Props to you Jay for having the courage to give up on a big Brand like Asus. The funny thing is I've been considering choosing  a Asrock board over an Asus one for my new build because I don't like the way Asus has been going recent;y even before this new thing happened.
So, guys... what brand should we trust at the current market that have great aftersales and reliable quality motherboard?
literally a no brainer, this was the final straw for me as well, the BIOS thing is a giant middle finger and if corpo Asus can't see that then they're screwed. It actually pisses me off how much companies don't give a shit about the consumer these days, Activision and COD, Asus and their product, etc. Its never the brand, its the mismanagement by greedy idiots at the top of the "food chain" that ruin things for literally everyone, themselves excluded. Idk what to say anymore other than SMH...
Do you think ASUS gaming monitors are still worth buying?
It's extra ironic that the spin-off company from ASUS (ASROCK) is now one of the go-to brands because their quality is much better on average.
I bought the asus z690 before it was known they mixed aluminum with copper in the VRM water block....luckily I hadn't hooked all the water cooling up yet but when I contacted asus customer support about it asking if they could send me the replacement block they were supposed to be sending out to affected customers, their response was to RMA the board with my supplier, the supplier I bought the board from had since liquidated so I was not able to return it which I explained and they basically ignored me.   They actually wanted me to hook all the water cooling up and wait for it to corrode before they would send out the replacement block! I asked them if they would be prepared to compensate me for any damage to the other blocks in the system that could potentially be damaged and they just ignored me. TERRIBLE customer service. Having used 2 formula boards in the past prior to this they have lost a customer in me. for life.   To this day I still haven't watercooled this board for the fear of corrosion so im stuck with either not using the VRM block in the loop or risking it and face corrosion with a company that will take to liability for any damaged parts.
This is why i love Jay, HONESTY
I've been so happy with my MSI AMD build. I built it during the pandemic and can't be happier. Good value, decent bios, no frills.
That is upsetting. Always been a fan of Asus.  :(
MSI Meg x670e ACE was my choice I am thrilled with it
You did the right thing Jay Msi is better and Gigabyte and Asrock is a good brand So Greetings from Finland I watched the whole video :D
Jay, are you excited for the Forest event in the game?
To everyone out there, spread the word, don't let companies like Asus get away with it: Contact whatever consumer protection authority acts in your country if your stuff breaks when you use it within spec, if you have trouble getting it replaced. That's a faulty product and in many countries either the shop that sold it, or the manufacturer is responsible regardless of *any* warranty statements they make.   ASUS Armoury Crate = worst software solution I've ever tried, after decades of daily PC use as both a profession and a hobby. It's like malware that attaches itself into everything your operating system has, service by service, background process by background process, its tendrils latch on and won't let go. It says something that due to how unstable and "dirty" the software is, they have a separate "uninstall tool" that TRIES to clean up your system from leftover Armoury Crate files, settings and processes when something inevitably goes wrong with it and you just try to do a normal uninstall which fails. But it never* succeeds in doing a cleanup, and advice you will eventually get from support after the usual back and forth is "reinstall your OS". No kidding. I've cleaned malware infections, including some quite tricky ones from multiple PCs over the years, and with full honesty I can say it was much more work and more time consuming to find out what was wrong with a Windows PC after Armoury Crate did a number on it than any malware I remember dealing with. That was in no small part due to it taking 30 minutes to install it on a fairly modern PC (Fast Internet, SSD) just to see if the problem of it neither running, or uninstalling properly still exists. I was *this* close to asking the person I was helping if we could reinstall the OS, but luckily (I will say it was mostly luck) I managed to fix things, and just have Aura installed for LED control, since it's small(er) and not causing issues on that particular system.  Okay but that's just one (albeit pretty important for the features you paid for) piece of software right? If only. They can't even get something as simple as onboard sound card's control software right, when it's one of the big "gaming" features the board was advertised with. From settings being randomly lost on reboot to mixing stereo sound (music) into multiple speakers resulting in unusable sound quality, it's a hit and miss. Yet from the software you can see someone did make a real effort. There's a lot of features, and a most of it works fine, at least according to my limited experience. The most frustrating part as someone trying to fix an issue is their attitude that is "Since only X number of people are complaining about this on the forums, we will randomly link standard trouble shooting steps, and ignore it (for years)". While other users with the issue who clearly know their stuff just say "Don't bother, just buy an old sound card for $20 on Ebay, it will do a better job". Spoiler: It does.  I've dealt with some annoying motherboard related hardware issues too (X570), but as I can't confirm if they were "Asus only", or how they were dealt with by the powers that be, I won't rant about them here.
so glad I found you! I've been a pretty normal home pc user (non-gamer) until mid 2019. My last pc was an entry gaming level Dell, good enough for my needs, which were minimal at the time. Since then, my husband has gotten into iRacing and I've gotten into heavy graphic design. My now 4ish year old PC is just meeting minimum specs and we've been disucussing 'what's next', hence finding your channel. I've learned so much in the last month or two, and truly appreciate discussions such as this, especially since I was really starting to look into going ASUS/AMD vs Intel for the base of the building....(and I'm *sure* I'm misspeaking on things a bit...lol)
Asus laptops are being plagued with blue screens recently and I sure don’t trust dropping another 3k on them again.
My hat is off to you. Appreciate you taking this stand as I have an Asus motherboard with issues. 👍
MSI all day!
Asus compan? A sus(picious) company.
is the ASUS B650E-F ROG STRIX fall under this category? I have an event viewer full of memory errors, crashes, etc.. the same as this video. I have an h150i and am running 70 degrees just sitting idle and no i didn't forget to remove the plastic.
I stopped gaming awhile ago and just getting back to it. I was about to go full send with ASUS nut hearing this makes me think twice.
Should have watch this before i got my tuf x670e, i cant get post on the 1st boot, update the bios to latest beta, fail one 1st time as the dumb mb restart itself during update, only on 2nd update got a clean installation... the problem goes away from now... but occasionally crash my cod wz with screen gone dark while the fans and rgb is still on... wtf asus
Such a shame that ASUS would do this, I used to like them ... Well done Jay, takes a lot of balls for someone like you to risk losing / getting rid of a supplier but you have always been honest and straight to the point
Love it !!! keep it up jay!!
hey jay mamby take asus under your wing! Help them out :). Make them better. force them recreate ther software!
Asus Republic of RMA 📬
May your projections support your actions.
I do love my MSI Motherboards.  Always been super solid to me.
Asus laptops with liquid metal from factory are horrendous as well, i am glad someone with some sway are willing to bring them under fire.
ASUS
Unfortunately I just bought Strix  670e-e MB and all the problems you mentioned had happened to me and after I searched for it, it’s appeared that the problems with the MB so I had to update to the beta version So I can at least see the screen work  As Jays said you’re fired Asus
I gave up on Asus in 2010.  I had one MB die after another, and I actually waited for #3 before I wrote them off for good. We had 0 support from them.
I wonder if replacing my ASUS motherboard will solve all my random weird problems. Worth a try.
I have the exact same board and cpu as u jay
I am not using Asus since years. All their hardware was just not stable :D My MSI board and my asrock board are running without any BSODs since 2016. I can totally understand the decision ^^
I built a system last year using my favorite motherboard brand: ASUS. Since bringing it up I had 2 motherboards that have caused damage to my hardware.
Now I know why Jay likes fast cars. It’s to move those huge B*lls around. Respect for your decision my man.
You failed to mention you are using 128GB of ram in a completely new platform. Doesn’t make any of the other things going on better but i bet it’s not much more stable in that config on other boards too.
So I built a 12th gen system, I used an Asus board for the first time, it was my first Intel (but Intel was helpful). I had issue after issue. I called and talked to multiple Asus customer service/techs. They all treated me like I'm an idiot. Now I'm fairly knowledgeable about PCs. I'm not you, but I know a lot about building and using a PC. So I took the board back to Microcenter, swapped it for the same board. It worked out of the box, but slowly had issues develop. So I exchanged both CPU and motherboard for AM5 and an MSI board. I thought it was crazy because everyone I knew with Asus motherboards loved them, but I had nothing but issues. So thank you for helping me know it was not just me with crummy service from Asus.
Asus is the new Biostar in quality. Last Asus board I used was on my Ivy Bridge system.
QQ
I built my first computer at the start of 2021 and the first the I bought was a asus rog motherboard for my 10700K (I can remember the socket name lol) and I’ve loved it ever since. The downfall of a company I trusted just makes me so upset and sad, then again it’s a comment trend in the entire scene that some companies just don’t care at all anymore.
He said the same thing that was always saying and everyone used to always attack me for it they make beautiful looking products but the quality is no good.
Is there a possibility we could see Gigabyte as a potential replacement for asus? I feel gigabyte has taken big strides to become kind of what asus was like in the past. Would love to see them featured on the channel some more!
Welp, there goes the ASUS board I had picked out for my 12700k build.
Oh god...I just had an ROG Strix PSU shipped, don't scare me man...
Hell they could be shipping boards intentionally they know aren't good.  That way when a customer gets it, they can just void the warranty on the spot and keep the money.  I would not be surprised.
Armoury Crate is the worst software in the history of software
ASUS is literally being the “We’re sorry” guy from South Park right now.
Was EVGA for years, and they died.  Was asus for years, and now they suck.  Where does one go for premium mobos?
Thank you! Will not be buying any ASUS products or recommending it.
Penny pinching has been the name of their game for a bit now. It’s embarrassing how feature bare their current boards are compared to the older ones
Asrock knew they fucked up in the past and know stepping up their game. ASUS became the Apple! But they couldn’t worked on their boards and laptops. Always heard people complaint about issues when they first get there boards or laptops. Asus is going down on my don’t buy list until they get there stuff together.
I've been running my PC for about a year now, constant BSODs and restarts. I've tried all kinds of things and was so worried that it's a hardware issue with my RAM.  On a whim, I uninstalled ASUS Armoury Crate. Seems stable, for now. Fuck you Asus!  (Also fuck ASUS warranty service for ROG phones, they forced me to send it to China where it got COVID locked down for literal months)  On another note - why are we saying ASRock is OK? Both are owned by Pegatron?
I am a pensioner and did my last ever Water Build  build with a 670E Hero and its been sitting in the large HAF case for the last 5 months gathering dust. It did work for a while but had memory problems of the PC kind and sent that back to HK ( a long story) and after a while it wouldnt post. Finally the GPU ( I didnt put the waterblock on thankfully) I removed and the parts I were selling I put back in an old case and thats been working fine. I just lack the motivation of getting this working again, even using the onboard graphics would be simple hookup with HDMI but am so shattered by the problems I have had with this build I would rather use it us a boat anchor ( well its is a water build )
My Asus rtx 4080 will sometimes go blank. Like no lights on the logo.
Damn I've been using ASUS since 2000.    I'm am currently looking to build a new PC and now this.
Keep your "stuff"
So I should change out from my asus stryx Rtx 2070?
I went MSI on my last build because features I got on a $185 buck ROG board in 2015 was only available on a  $350 dollar board in 2022.  Looks like my instincts were correct.
From your lops to Asus' ears. Thanks.
Ok now call out Gigabyte and Samsung as well. Virtually no warranty and/or after purchase support on any of their products in North America.
Thank you so much for defending us gamers. Always had problems with Asus motherboards and their customer service is really bad.
We have seen so many companies have ground breaking issues in the last couple of years. From Gigabyte exploding PSUs, GPUs burning and ASUS having different motherboard issues. What brands would you recommend now? MSI, PNY, EVGA or any others that are still reliable?
AMD is garbage, ASUS just has crap crisis handling. I can’t believe you said ASROCK was garbage, cmon man they always had the funkiest boards with some crazy features nobody else tried. Some of the best boards I’ve used, best being EVGA. As far as features to price I’d still give it to ASROCK, but EVGA was just soooo much better on cust support and RMA.
wtf Asus ;(
This video just made me paranoid of my 3080Ti TUF, hope it ASUS didn’t leave me in the dust I’ve had it for a year let’s just hope it means it won’t die
ASUS reached their climax in terrms of product quality and reliability with the release of the P2B (1998) and the CUSL2 (2000). After that, it all went slowly downhill, with a lot of acceleration during the past 2-3 years.
Ya know, I had nothing but stability issues with a x570 TUF board, they ruined the RMA then I bought MSI and not an issue since
I have been an Asus man for decades but I have to agree 100% they have turned to garbage, cant even do Windows 11 drivers/software for sound cards they still sell, I recently had to remove my Strix Soar because my system went randomly unstable, works fine without it now. Won't be using them again any time soon.
the overvolting issues started with the b550 strix motherboards and has gotten worst. my b550 strix board wanted to overvolt my 5900x to 1.49v on stock clocks, causing it to hit 89-90c on water. dig deeper and you will see more issues. every am5 gigabyte boards I have ever own all have died except one b550 board, msi has also been a hit or a miss. asrock is the only one that I've had no problems with. I have a fm2+ board that I spilled coffee on while still running 5+ years ago yet it still runs.
I never really liked Asus because they make very cheap products very nice looking though and they are innovative but very cheap and poorly made
So my last comment said I had 2 Asus boards fry on me building my PC, so I have to ask, does anyone know what’s a good replacement for the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme? Or should I just got back to Intel and what would be a good brand to build a higher end PC with?  Thanks
To date there are 3 brands to stay away from ( base on Jay's channel) , 1st Thermal fake, 2nd Gigabyte and Asus. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Only money matters...lets see how this goes
ASUS's new slogan should be "F$ck you, Pay us."
I just got a ROG STRIX Z690-F gaming WIFI in my new build in february and its a great board. Didn't know about all this ASUS stuff going on but guess i just got lucky . . .
Worst customer service EVER. Will not honor my warranty. And I only had a crap/cheap laptop. Now I have nothing.
For those who don't know Those "influencer stacks" are actually B-stock  companies have. B stock is normally returns, Refurbished, RMAs, and sometimes old revisions  Companies send these out when they need to give someone a "free" or loaner hardware  There's nothing wrong with B stock, it's just when you pass it off as perfect is the problem
# 6 trending as of me saying this.. Asus really dug them self into a hole that will be hard to climb back out from. If everyone stops buying there shit, doesnt matter about how much branding you can put out... your not getting as much back as your probably spending at that point. I dont buy there stuff. Have had an AsRock z87 Extreme board with my i5 -4790k and it was solid for the years I used it. Love your work and keep up the awesome content.
Thanks for saving my ass! I was about to buy a ASUS X670E-E Gaming motherboard but now I'll be going for the Asrock Tai Chi for the AMD 7800 X3D. It's good to know that they fall off in quality because my old ASUS board had been great. I would not have suspected issues with my planned new system going to ASUS so you probably saved me a bunch of money.
I do not blame this on you but I just finished one of my builds over your recommendations for one of the motherboards that you recommended sucks to know that now I'm going to have to tear everything apart and start over with no money😢 oh well can you recommend another motherboard then?
DANG!!! All the computers in my house I built with ASUS  motherboards. WTF???
Goated
Seems like a huge overreaction. 1) The BIOS upgrade was released as beta for only a few days, it had become a normal version release before Gamer Nexus' had released their follow-up video bashing Asus for having released a BIOS in beta first. (Which is something that Asus has always done.)  2) Gamer Nexus has stated the opinion out that this overvoltage protection / OCP issue was to be blamed on AMD for having failed to communicate their specs clearly to motherboard manufacturers - three of which, not only Asus, have been caught in this voltage issue. Will this channel also ban the 2 other manufacturers from its future tests?
Thanks for doing this, also thanks for explaining the asrock thing, it's a motherboard i've never bought (so I was unsure how good they were or not), but was thinking for my next build. So in this and Gamers Nexus videos hinting at it's even worse the asrock it was kinda oh no, I guess I should stick with gigabyte.  Now I'm thinking ASUS tries to a send an apology card to get Jay back.. send a happy mothersday card :I
Just a bunch of people in 2023 following each other no alpha
in modern days the good visual design and representation should not bias or aim buying decision. Believe me, I am a designer of physical products and there is no problem to fake feeling of quality in motherboard, sneaker or clothing.
99% of business failures are due to bad management not bad workers .... Try to remember that when dealing with tech support or RMA folk .... You take your frustrations out on them and that just lets management off the hook
I also got some fuzz or bent pins on Asus strix z790!!
As I put under Steve/GN's video: Just for any ASUS reps reading: I have used and enjoyed multiple ASUS products in my life and have generally recommended them. I am now never buying an ASUS products ever again and I will never recomend them again. Well done :) I do hope you can fix this!
I remember the time when noone used or bought products from asus around me because there was always rma or reliability issues. Then suddenly we would see a lot of people make trusty expensive builds with asus boards or buying whatever asus make. At this point I was still remembering their crappy laptops, tablets and such so I would not understand how this can work together. And looks like it was just a coincident for a few years
never thought that asus would do this, its the last brand to think about having quality issues,😮
All aboard, the Asus bashtrain! So where was the video about the bent pins and wrong mobos sent by Asus? I have this feeling everyone was happy to recieve free products and making money until now. Now everyone has to cancel the brand. I feel like there is 0 realisation the companies consist of thousands of people, some idiot sent an rma mobo, sure thats messed up. Does this mean every customerservice and rma center   worldwide sucks, no. Meanwhile the customer service here in EU is outstanding.  For years ive seen thousands of amazing Asus builds with amazing performances and now caus of this mess up lets just cancel the whole brand. Should it be mentioned, of course, should asus make a statement they messed up, off course. Is  this a good direction for the company, no. I remember MSI made some trash boards with the x570 release, in fact it was a GN review that mentioned the temps on vrm were insane for the price: "woops, sorry"   and Msi is still ok. I still believe Asus makes great products, perhaps the other elements of service and supply are now lacking. They lost themselves and their demographic in persuit of cash amd covering themselves. Lets see how many people are affected amd what exactly is going on.
ive built my new pc with asrock 790 and its been doing flawlessly, only minor usb port issue where my mouse disconnects every few weeks. but it comes down to the fact i got lots of usb devices a hub and whatnot, so i cant really blame them, hope they become more popular. if i ever built a new pc, it will be another asrock motherboard
I had a z77 Asus motherboard but had to change it out with ASRock because the Asus board didn't do sli with the sata ports . Never owned anything Asus after.
well thank you sir .......
I salute you... Respect for speaking the truth!
Yep, they are not listening to us I told them the same thing, after a BS RMA. I'm running ASRock now as well.
Great, now I need to find a new Motherboard supplier! Thanks Jay.
I believe that at one time AsRock made mother boards for ASUS and AsRock got a bad name because they got mad when there cheaper boards got bad  reviews and they tried to pay for good ones but influencers would not go for it
A is SUS
its crazy how far ASRock has come, this whole event made me appreciate them and I finally put the "ASRock Powered" sticker on the front of my pc, they make good stuff now and they put out a fix for this issue before the news even blew up
You know, one thing I always liked about Asus boards was their in-depth manuals. But then I wonder now if that's more a "higher-end board" thing than a "brand" thing.
Getting through your video. Nice shoutout to ASrock. I had their mobo on my last build that lasted for 7 quality years. I maintained the PC so well, it still looked as good as new and I ended up selling it with a 1070ti last year. It was a ROCK SOLID build. Zero issues with it ever in those 7 years. If they had a better white color scheme, I would of continued with them for my current build that yes, I went all white.  Now I cringe watching this video since I also went with Asus. Though it's an older board Z-590 that was on sale cheap last year. So far, knock on wood, zero issues with it.
Who is your suggested brand for motherboards in the mid to high end market considering how things are going now?
I’ve been getting USB disconnect and reconnect on my ASUS Strix X670E-A motherboard.
I have refused to use Asus for over 15 years. Everything of theirs I ever bought died just out of warranty. Absolute garbage company.
😂😂😂😂 you a sucker
Again Shame on you bro - look I get that you are the person out here willing to say whatever will get you the most clicks - but in posting this video I lost respect for you - When ASUS turns this around, and they will - remember you Fired them to gain a few extra clicks, remember that you hopped on the bandwagon in glorious Jerry Springer Fashion. Where Asus HAS closed contracts with many influencers in the Market back in December - but not you - there must have been a good reason for that. I stand by proudly with Asus as a partner because your understanding of (sometimes things just go bad) take Mercedes Benz as an example - they've had recalls yes, but you Ambulance chasers did not drag their good name through the mud., They are still Mercedes Benz - a top and well known luxury car maker - now take Asus - you dragged them through the mud backing GN without a care in the world for clicks. For an audience chasing ambulances. SHAME ON JAY.... I hope you fire all of your other board sponsors as well because this issue effected all of them equally - not just because someone in the PR side messed up and posted something they should have thought about first - Shame on Jay....
I think they had issues before then, but the last 3 to 4 years coincides neatly with the pandemic. Seems a lot of tech giants started skimping if not outright skipping QA to get product out to meet demand.  Hopefully between expensive GPUs and faulty motherboards gathering dust on shelves and just lower than ever sales overall, maybe they'll start offering good value again.
Interestingly I have an Asus wrx80 board and I get strange audio issues sometimes from the analog outs. It's a premium board which is supposed to be very isolated.   My Stream Deck creates a high pitch noise unless I connect it through a USB hub.  Twice in the last year my pc has rebooted when plugging in a usb device, which is odd because I've not had that happen on any of my previous pcs.  I don't know how many of these issues are down to the ASUS board, I do have less confidence with this expensive pc though than my previous builds.
Asus CEO turns blind eye, gives self massive consecutive raises. (probably) Great episode Jay, I have pondered buying Asus products again, now theyre dead to me.
I’ve been watching your Chanel since 2014 you are the reason I’m into pc building and gaming and recently I wanted to upgrade my gpu so I did some research and due to the price to performance I bought an rx6750xt since I took the word of someone that amd gpu’s are now great and everything is perfect long story short the gpu has an issue with stuttering a big issue so I’ve sent it back and got it replaced. And the new gpu had the exact same issue so then I googled about the issue and found out that rx6700/50xt’s very often have that issue and there is no solution I tried everything to get it to work but nothing and now I’m not able to get my money back for since this is already been replaced once they can only send me a new one so I’m stuck with only that option. So thank you for calling out companies on their bs.
Asrock is my go to for years now. Never had problems with any build. And or intel. Also only msi was close but with the firmware leak disaster ..
Thank you for an honest review and take on the downward trend Asus has taken.  This type of information is quite valuable to system builders.
Thank you Jay  Bold Man to fire a Sponser  👏👏👏👊👍👍  There is an old adage,,,, "Vote with your Wallet"  Either ASUS puts' on thier "Big Boy Pants",,  pulls up thier socks,,   or,,,,,,  they will be gone
It is a shame. Back in the 80's and 90's Asus was the go to motherboard.
Guess I won't be getting a new Asus monitor if this is how they treat customers.
To me all this Asus shit begins when I buy the Asus X570 Dark Hero and I noticed the RAM OC was a total garbage on that board, so I sold that beauty piece of shit and get a MSI X570S MPG CARBON MAX WIFI, exact the same card but way much better bay far on MEMORY OC, and I'm so happy with MSI since, Jay, please use MSI BOARDS they do the job and every single time I ask for an update on the bios someone really put hands on they even respond my emailing and give me a lot of info.
I love Asus products. I have bought a few Maximus motherboards and recently a Maximus Extreme Z690. But this hurts as an Asus fan. Iv never had any trouble with Asus boards but have had Gigabyte boards in past have problems so I stuck to Asus but yeah Asus needs to be accountable!
I've been staying away from Asus since the bad 5700xt designs. Seems like that was the right decision.
LULZ ...RIIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTTT. you get what you pay for, inflation just hit 600% since 2009, massive job cuts all over the world in first world nations, quality and warranties are the first cuts businesses make there after, quantity is the next after that, then it goes to downsizings.....thanks to covid and now the trade sanctions guess where we are at. asus has been around longer than jayz2cents. if there is an issue it means the company is about to fold, just like SOYO and ABIT and IWILL did in america. over volting by the big 3 msi asus and gigabyte has been a known issue since fcpga (flip chip pin grid array) debuted as all motherboard manufacturer were caught by tomshardware and thomas pabst himself measuring and documenting this at toms hardware since the early 2000s in all the benchmarks that started coming out since pentium2 days you clowns these days acting surprised and disgusted is pure showmanship for bribes, just like all spokespeople when it comes to 'sponsors', don't bother trying to lie to us about all the schilling. buy everything with your own money and prove it with receipts like the rest of us.
I mean this in the best way, but you referenced "I have an MSI board in there" and holy shit are MSI assholes too!
1 of the reason that im going for msi after 8 years of using asus mob. Its a shame how asus handels things
Isnt asrock a sisterbrand or asus tho?
Jay you use that arock board it's beautiful
I have their Asus Gladius II mouse that the latest firmware broke the device functionality for me. When I searched the net, clearly I'm not the only one whose experienced this. I've had to remove the firmware entirely in order for it to function properly, but then I get no fun RGB lighting. How does Asus remedy this problem? Why, bring out the Gladius III, because why should we fix a broken II , when we can ask for more of your money and hope III is better than II. Asus has gone down the toilet lately for sure.
i hate that this is true i bought my new mobo and gpu before the 7800x3d came out i had done alot of research and settled on the asus tuf 4090 and the asus rog strix z790-e gaming for my 13900k very disappointed in asus wish i would have went with msi again this time around...hopefully i dont run into trouble... thank you for speaking up for for us the consumer
Complaining about getting free stuff ?😅
Oh DEAR!!! Like wow - obvs thanks for doing this, bringing it to our attn, only .. What to buy NOW?  I mean LAST week I read how GIGABYTE (who I used to REALLY like) were avoiding RMA's, shutting down the website for returns when an issue came up ... Early ASROCK were a bit flaky for me, but that was a LONG time ago  So its like, them and MSI???   Again, thank you
I have this board with an amd 7 7700x. If I don't update the bios will I be okay? I've had it for 4 months and it's been running great. It's an x670e asus tuf board, forgot to mention
Taiwan and China are 2 different countries.
sad to see just a giant fall like this /shame Asus
I very recently built a new system, finished it a week before the first 7-series CPU's started blowing up, luckily I had no problems and on the day I read about it I saw there was a new BIOS for my board. I'm so very happy I went with an MSI board after I was doubting between that and 2 different ASUS models, looks like I dodged a bullet. The only thing from ASUS that I now have in there is the PSU, which has good reviews but I still hope they didn't pull any backwards shit in the assembly of that!
Integrity above cash, rare to see it, lots of respect for this Jay
Never been fan of Asus, even since the days of Nvidia GTX 8800 ultra. always overpriced. and meh nothing special compared to other on the market.
Back in early 2000s, I found out my Asus board I got for my b-day 1 year prior, was bad. Called them - they were closed early for a holiday that didn't  start until next day.  They opened 1 day after my b-day.  Support guys LAUGHED their asses off at me - for being the "dumb little girl" who "screwed herself" by calling "1 day too late." Pretty bad - considering I was a kid too!  I knew back then they were an evil company.  Thank you for your integrity Jay mad respect for you and Fluffy. (Steve)  Fire hazards are a big deal!
So Asus is the new Snapon a company resting on its laurels and just spewing out over priced rubbish
Just built a new Z790 build and went with Gigabyte, this videos makes me very glad I did!
Thanks for highlighting this, always had rog boards, will not be buying Asus for my new build next month.
Bought a brand new Asus laptop a couple months ago. Medium range priced. YOU CANT DOWNLOAD THE FUCKIN DRIVERS FOR IT. The drivers on their website ARE NOT THE ONES YOU NEED. They don't work. I fortunately happened on a reddit thread that led me to discover the actual chipset is not the chipset they advertised.
So with the quality of ASUS tanked, what will be your go to for motherboards?
The saddest thing about all of this is i am prolly still gonna get an Asus board for AM5 since the tuf offers the best features/price ratio  at the retailer i am buying. Lol
And to think I almost went with one of their boards for a 7800X3D build I was considering. Thankfully for me I was looking for a silver/white aesthetic which ended up pushing me to intel since more boards were available matching that theme on the blue side. I obviously wasn't going to buy that APEX board cause I'm not insane, so I went with MSI's Z690 Force for my 13700K.
Well I've always wanted to give Asrock a try, guess I will.
I have a ton of Asus gear, but all from 4+ years ago
Well at least now I know why my sound goes out sometimes 🙃
Damn shame, I've always had good experiences with Asus stuff (only had 1 board failure since the late 90s!) but this is absurd enough I'll reconsider for my next upgrade.
I agree, my last 2 asus laptops look nice, but poor QC and then support has killed my desire to use their hardware.  There is no way I would buy a 1st gen device from them or even a second gen device anymore.  I trust valve to support and be pro consumer 100% of the time.
OMG Jay! I've build a pc for my friend lately, using the Asus X670E PLUS-WIFI and it has been hell untill now; he was ready to give the system back because of the crashes, the glitches with games, random errors and stuff. I updated his BIOS to the last stable version (no Beta's for me) but he's still on the edge of 'will it continue to work'. What to do here? The board is like 3 months old almost now, any recommendations? Bought in Europe at a Europe webshop btw; thanks for any assistance from you guys here!
ASROCK over Asus...he is pissed. Huge Asus fanboy here myself, but guess I may have to go back to Gigabyte MBs after my ROG Crosshair VI Extreme dies. I understand the frustration because when I try to unzip the latest BIOS from Asus for the Crosshair (downloaded multiple times), 7-zip throws the error 'There are some data after the end of the payload data'. Not about to try updating to latest with that going on, and gun shy of online update option.
Hope people can see this video that are buying the ROG Ally. I've literally have been telling people in forums to watch out for the ROG Ally in a negative way. And they simply brush it off by... ooo he's a steam deck user lmao. Good lucky with 700$  If they can't even help you out with a $1,000 motherboard now imagine a cheaper product.
I just bought a Asus ROG STRIX Z790-A GAMING WIFI ATX LGA1700 Motherboard for my new build thats gonna be running a i9 13900k......... Should I be worried about overvolting? If so is there a fix like manually lowering voltage or is this just for the 3D chips? I never bought a Asus board before always used gigabyte aorus boards and such..... Uhm did I mess up?
You guys should do AsRock Taichi brand!
Yep, I am with ya! I quit using ASUS about a year ago when I had an issue and their customer service was garbage!
Have a ROG now, but won't buy another. Thanks!
Never been a fan of ASUS as I've always seen their producsts as similar to Apple where they charge extra just for a name and aesthetic, and boy am I glad I haven't been giving them my money this last decade. Shameful way to treat your customers.
It's really incredible that you are standing behind who you let sponsor the page. That means a lot to all of us. Thank you
I remember when the Asrock boards used to be the cheapy boards to not get. Now I run Asrock in 2 desktop systems and an Asrock Rack server board in a NAS and all have been great
I've only purchased ASUS products because everyone online raves about them. But I've had so many products from them fail from motherboards to laptops and every singletime I try to warranty they always make up some reason to void the warranty. They said a motherboard I sent in had water damage but the desktop has never been anywhere near water. Then for a laptop that wouldn't boot they said it was from drop damage but the laptop's condition was immaculate when I sent it in. But when I got it back it was completely trashed.  Don't support ASUS.
I don't understand the ASRock hate, they are awesome since Sandybridge/Ivybridge. I had more than a dozens non 24/7 ASUS boards from all generations die from ASUS since then, yet the freaking ASRock boards even when used as a 24/7 NAS or gaming PC worked like a charm and still did.
While I have used them and have friends that use them, I'm still not sold on MSI as a brand, I had a lot of weird problems with them over the years and they have not won me back. And while some people dislike Gigabyte, they are my first choice besides when I was able to get an EVGA or Supermicro board. Asus has been up there, but if this is all true they are losing my trust now too.  Asrock has been ok, sometimes hard to work with and cheap feeling but ok. I will still say that part of what wins me on a brand is reliability as well, just handling problems is not enough, having less problems is better, downtime is money and time.
ASUS has always been overrated and hopefully consumers will start a class action ...go team america
Such a shame. I've been an Asus fanboy/customer for decades. I hope they get their head out their a and fix address these issues.
Glad I got ASRock!
Asus motherboards have been in decline for a good few years now. They spend much more in marketing than R and D
I bought a $1000 z690 forumla and it was DOG shit out of the box, nothing ran right, had to sit there for a week trouble shooting every damn little thing just to get the system to boot, I caved and and went MSI, havnt looked back.
yes, that is really bad consumer treatment. thank you. and really good of you to stand by your words like this. i have been an asus user for ages (last build 2 years ago). was considering my next revision in next 6months, so thank you for warning me to look a bit wider this time.
I have ASRock Taichi 390 powered by 9900k with some custom clocks, bought & assembled it after about half of year of 9900 release. and it works very solid since . Had 0 issue as soon I got audio drivers to work correctly on Win 10(that was a little bit of pain). I got you thing about motherboard design, but what about custom coloring? Is any PC building company or case building doing it? I'm sure some may do.
The PC shop I manage has quite literally ONLY used Asus gear for our custom builds (unless a customer has specifically said otherwise) and they up till now have been THE brand that just worked and had no issue, we see MSI , gigabyte, asrok etc EVERY DAY in our workshop with so many headaches, Asus ... basically never unless it was 7 years old plus...man that is not the case anymore. The last year we have seen countless DOA boards, massive amounts of issues, failures after sale, random reboots etc etc... We are now planning to use gigabyte going forward and Asus for anything up to am4 and 11th gen Intel...beyond that....we sadly have to trust a brand that has burned us so many times cus at this point they seem to be the best somehow?? We are pretty much screwed no matter what. Gonna be a fun few years
The nightmare of RMAs I've dealt with them recently (three Dark Hero boards.) I appreciate this video.
ive only bought asus motrherboard up till this point. but  maybe I do need to make the switch to AsRock? idk that's the only other one I would probably try.
This is why i always prefer gigabyte. Yeah they are not aestetic also they dont have super colorfull stuff but they are robust and updates and stuff are only stable versions. no beta no shit
My experience with ASUS, if you pay for it it's good to go.
Republic of Garbage. I only buy MSI
I did a completely new build after 5 years, and got an Asus 3070ti and an Asus motherboard. Ive been having stupid stuttering, even with a 13700k. Only parts that could be at fault are the Gigabyte power supply, the mb, or the gpu, and im too scared to take it and get it looked at. Really sucks after upgrading from a 1060 6GB that I've been yet again, screwed, by our tech overlords who hike prices and deliver worse products. I still remember the days of $200 1070ti's in CAD dollars and how good the price to performance was. Anyone have any idea what could be up?
Not defendign them, but they are a global corporation, and a couple dud motherboards ain't their top priority. it sucks but it happens.
man that sucks...been using asus mobos and gpus for 20 years
Fair Play Jay and crew, I have as rock b550 extreme 4 with 5600x, as Jay said rock solid board. Got Asus b450 f gaming 2 for my son 3600 build. Bios is over build, and it is not same quality product that I know Asus from 20 to 10 years ago.
SUCK IT ASUS!!!
Wow. Respect Jay!
Im glad I havent been using asus motherboards since i ran a fx 8150
This kind of scares me as I have TUF x570 Plus board running my 5600x. It's been solid, and I haven't heard of any issues. But as it was I always though Asus was overpriced, over-branded, and hated them for their RMA issues. I only went with this board, as my old system died and I had to do a complete re-build, because it was the most reasonably priced back when all the scalping issues were going on and in full swing a couple years ago. Fuck Asus, and good on you Jay. This is exactly why I follow you over every other tech-tuber.
To me this is just history repeating. I remember having these discussions (Asus - yay! Asus - nay!) with my best friend when we had just graduated from school - and that was in 2000! He went Asus, I wouldn't touch an Asus mainboard in a rad-suit with three pairs of gloves on top of it. Over the last decades, he's had several boards die, I've had none. Same discussion every time.  The last time I've told him that the very definition of madness is to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result.
I know after steves vid I will never buy a part from them
I knew ASUS was crap when the very first and only product i bought from them was a motherboard that fried itself with its own header connector brand new out of the box.
ASUS Absolutely Sh*t User Satisfaction. I had my first build in years and it had an x570-f ROG board. That lasted under a year before it destroyed itself and a ram stick while saying on the diagnostic leds that it was the GPU. Now run a Aorus X570S Pro AX 1.1 with a 5900x and its solid fine. Aorus x570 boards get overlooked and for what you get they don't get enough credit for it.
What brand would you recommend to replace Asus as my go to motherboard brand for high end gaming build ???
pretty sure all industries and multi-national shareholder-beholden corporations (and private, too, just hopefully not ALL of them) are guilty of varying degrees of this. The tech journalism sector has become too smart for it's own good. I lowkey expect a buyout of the current media outfits like Jay and GN. I hope they are private..
two years ago, I made the decision to return an ROG laptop (don't remember the model) because attempting to update the keyboard drivers to get the backlight working completely bricked the system. They wouldn't do anything about it, so I got my money back and picked another option. Never again lol
This just popped up on my feed and i don't give a damn about this stuff so... your fired as well. 😂
I’m now thinking about canceling my G17 laptop on Amazon that’s currently awaiting shipping.
Spent £350 on an x670e TUF board for my 7800X3D, bios update has made it run really weird. Higher temps and crashes. Not impressed.
You know it really doesn't matter when you hit pause in a JTC video.  You are always going to get a weird, funny face from Jay...
Thank you very much Jay! I am man of principle and find it important to stand by my values. Having worked in customer service a long time, I find the behavior you describe completely unacceptable. I was about to purchase a ROG Maximus extreme and now i will def look into something else. I am recent fan of your work, your channel has awoken the sleeping PC builder in me and I sincerely thank you for this video and everything else I have binge watched in the last month. Good job 👍
Bad timing for the ally to come out around this drama
I built 3 Asus ROG computers with RTX 4090 and 2 7800X3D and 1 7950X3D and none of them have stable RAM... Latest BIOS or not
This video deserves 1M likes tbh.
Didn't ASUS fund ASrock as a spinoff to their main brand back in 2002? Makes you wonder why one is thriving and one is falling appart in terms of qa and software ripeness.
Damnit! I was getting ready to pull the trigger on a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E for my first build but now I’m having doubts. You guys think I’ll be safer with a MSI board instead?
Asus was famous for its bad customer service for a while in China. It has a Chinese nickname-打人硕（beat you up Sus）. This name came up where there was a customer went to an Asus retail store for a refund on bad product. The store workers end up beating him up really bad. Ever since then Asus tried to fix their rep in China but well, its not working well.
I have an Asus Dual RTX 3070, and the fans have been absolute crap. Board works fine but they develop a whine around 70%. Replaced the fan, same problem after 5 weeks. It's minor, but not confidence-inspiring.
Oh well, another brand going down the drain.
That's what you get as a byproduct for buying products based on Chinese slave labor (Foxcon).  Worse, you even admit to taking money through sponsorships from Chinese slave labor.
They used to be my Anakin... Now.... Heavy breathing
Brutal honesty- brilliant :) it’s what we all need!
I fired Asus when my P4 800e died after two years and I called to RMA since it had a 3 year warranty. Asus informed me the warranty started from the manufacture date, not the date of purchase (I had the receipt). I asked how I could tell what the manufacture date was. They told me it was embedded in the serial number of the board and wouldn't tell me how to decode the date. Last Asus product I ever bought and that was about 20 years ago. From then on it was EVGA, the best ever! Too bad they didn't make an AMD board when I built my last system. Now it's Gigabyte.
I've always used msi
2 times coil whine on a X670e Strix A and insane coil whine on 3 Strix White 4090s (60fps, 100fps), 2700 euro for pure bs.
This takes "Testing in Production" to a whole new level.  And everyone is doing it. Skype is no longer working with my bluetooth headphones, Facebook can't share in Messenger, and Instagram reels are turned off somehow on my phone.  So having a bios that can set your PC on fire... I don't see it as an impossibility.
Bravo! I highly admire and respect you folks for calling out ASUS on these quality issues and dumping them as a sponsor. They need to remember to put the customer back in FIRST PLACE! I will no longer purchase any of their products and will be encouraging all of my friends to do the same.
Asus is too close to Anus
When I made my build 2 years ago, I remember there was a little bit of funkiness going on with ASUS then. I have a ROG Strix X570-E and when putting it together the pin cup for the MBD USB 3.2 pins fell off. Fortunately I was able to RMA that fast and get it back relatively quick,  but ASUS was in deep 💩 even then.
my mom passed away if u like to help out jay i need yr help sir    i dont  the way i feel is crush  an than some i lost her to cancer  an i cud not stay a head of it iit was takeing her so fast with the chemo    she lost 40lbs in 38days sir i have a cpu from my mom sshe got me 5900x   i whant to put it in a good mouther bored but i dont have a lot of cash right now i have a ams b550 a pro  atc full an i am a small strermr with 1k foloeing it so i  trust u with u heelping me
So glad I had already left ASUS years ago!
Since 2015 the three last MB were from Asrock. No complains since.
I built my PC in December 2022. I wanted to go for the 670E hero, but could not gratify the difference of 400eu between that and the 670E-E Gaming variant being the watercooling ready stuff, so I went with the latter. Combined that with the 7950x and I have no issues whatsoever.  Even though I do now consider myself lucky, considering all that's been going on, if I had to build a new system today I would not have chosen Asus. I had severe issues with MSI in the past so I will be looking into Gigabyte and ASRock for my next builds.   That said, kudos and thanks to Jay for informing and taking action against self-consumed corporate giants that set the customer on a lower level than their pocket.
I remember the days when Asus was a reliable brand and ASRock was a sketchy brand that you didn't know if they would honor their warranties. Just goes to show you that people and companies can change over the decades.
Im still on the Crosshair VI Hero, glad im watching this as ill keep this in mind if i ever get off AM4 (won't be anytime soon)  What other boards have a ton of usb on the back? (I dont like usb dongles) Or what hubs are recommended if I go this route.
I can't wait for EVGA to make more motherboards.
I have been an ASUS user for like 15 years but at the start of the year my B550-F GAMING died 2 days after a bios update and after 2 weeks of emails back a forth ASUS they simply refused RMA because i updated the bios I'm never using them again
I just bought an asus tuf psu. Are asus psu also bad?
my homie had a asus tuf x570 had a broken ram slot, and then the same thing happened to my brothers b550m board
Well done Jay! Thanks for the info.
Why is anyone surprised? This is about par for the course with them. Many many years ago now, my buddy was building an mATX system with an Asus board and a P4. And the system would literally overheat on BIOS defaults and shut down. The only way to solve it was to have a startup program that dropped the voltage after Windows started so the system would remain stable/functioning.
If all influencers were as honest as you Jay, the world would be a MUCH better place. Thanks for keeping it real.
In Czech language we have a slang word for "faulty product" = Aušus (most probably derived from German Ausschuss). See what I did there Asus? :D
What the freaking hell Jay😂 i literally just 2 weeks ago purchased an x570s dark hero to build for my brother in law.   Thats still basically a solid board riiiight?  If anyone has used one fill me in.  I have a rog strix x570 e  and love it
I have a ROG x670E-E Gaming WiFi that after a month of use with a 7950x suddenly decided to blue black screen, would not post. Through swapping out parts I found the motherboard was at fault and I RMAed it.  That process worked fine but took about six weeks.  In the meantime I put a B650 Tomahawk in my system to avoid the downtime. Now I have received the ROG board back but am hesitant to bother to swap out the Tomahawk.
Really bad move on Asus part... Asus was the top Mobo manufacturer in the industry by far... now they are bottom dog... all that effort having higher quality control for roughly a decade all gone in one Mobo generation.  Guess everyone has to have a 50/50 gamble on MSI boards now.  Really sucks.
Crazy. Always been an Asus Consumer. But - yeah - they changed in the meantime.
Sad story. Asus was the one to go if u didnt know what to buy, just because of the quality..  They invested everything in marketing and estetics... And ASrock is amazing
My past 15 years of PC building has been all Asus. I even have a p8z68-v with a 2500k still working till this day. I have strix board now and Msi 3060 12gb. No problems for me to each their own.
I agree with Jay. Bad customer service = no more customers. I just built my new rig x670 E Extreme with Ryzen 9 7950x. The (x3d was too beta for my taste). I've been having fun with it. I have the expo II turned on for my Dominator Platinum running at 6000 and I have my processor running with PBO at least at 5.1 Ghz (3d mark says 5,745 Mhz). On AMD Ryzen Master it says my peak core(s) voltage is staying about 1.40649 during heavy use. No problem yet. I hope someone comes up with a fix for these asus board/X3D builds soon. yes I am a noob, but have been dreaming of building one for years and finally did it thanks to the information i learned watching Jay, Linus, Marcus, and Steve.
Asus isn’t the only one….. last year Asrock sent me some test samples for some mods and sent me Refurbished boards…… but come one dude….. they are giving you free product, who cares if they send you refurbished or rma products from time to time, if it works it works , you are reviewing them not re selling them.
Thank you for the unbeknownst to me info.
I've had shorter breakups. Joke asside; I appreciate content creators who actually stand behind the products. Therefor a thumbs up for you Jay!
i saw this over 10 years ago, last thing i bought from asus was z270 (2017 or 2018) mobo, because of half price discount. noisy fans in vga since ever :] now i see they had big marketing division,
Now I know why  i have to restart my computer 2-3 for it to post and it all started when i update to latest bios a few months on my asus board.
My first pc build was in 2020 with an ASUS b450 f motherboard. Do i need to worry?
but on a real note now that EVGA is out, ASUS has the best hardware....sorry but no ones really gonna go anywhere. Their people might be shit but their R&D is now on top whether we like it, or in this case, not.
Annnnnd... all my shit is ASUS... im worried.:,U
Just got done upgrading to an ASUS TUF 4090 and now I'm worried I messed up by going ASUS. ASUS used to be such a rock solid brand, thought of them up there with the likes of EVGA, but clearly something has changed in their management philosophy in the last few years.
I still use asus tuf x570 board and since day one only problems. First stability problems with 3800x and now ramdom restarts on 5900x.  I was fighting with this boeard for weeks and the only solution for me it all core overclock to avoid resterts. This is my last asus build for sure !!!!
Cheesus I’m worried about the b760 rog strix I just ordered for my build 😅
Never have these problems with other vendors
Jay: "I hate being called an 'influencer', because it'z bad."  Also Jay: "ASUS did bad stuff, so to look out for the consumers, we're firing them as sponsors!"  You know, Jay, there's such a thing as a 'good influencer', yo. Just look in the mirror. :3
I dumped ASUS about a decade ago due to crap warranty support. They put me through the ringer over a $200 monitor! Been seeing QC go down ever since. Took a chance, for a rush build, and bought the ROG Strix Z690i. It lasted about 2 months and the PCIe slot took a dump on me. I didn't even try going down the warranty path again and just trashed it. I'll stick with MSI, had great success with there boards for years, and recent years ASROCK has been great as well.
I would love to see a revision of your private build, same CPU, different MOBO. Wondering if that will make the system more stable.
It's unfortunate, I've sworn by Asus for more than a decade and a half but I've been hearing a lot of bad things the past couple of years.  I'm going to run my current hardware for the next few years and hopefully things bounce back but this is troubling.  Thankfully my ROG Strix B450-F Gaming motherboard has been good and hopefully that continues to be true.
@JayzTwoCents I have been a ASUS Fan boy since LGA 775 days. always bought the ROG line up. Currently sitting with the ROG Helios case; STRIX 4090, Ryujin  360 AIO, ROG z790 gaming e, etc. and ill tell you what. I have been experiencing the same exact USB cut out and audio cut out in the Intel platform as-well. Its been a pain in the @$$ and been dealing with it. I have used MSI motherboards in the past and I been extreme disappointed with them including z690 gaming edge WIFI. It's sad to hear that ASUS product support has went down hill. knowing this now I am unsure which brand to go with for the next gen z890. MSI is a no Go. ASUS is now officially a no go. I like EVGA... I have the x58 and x99 classified motherboards and rock stable. But as a brand I'm unsure if they will actually stick around. So the only brands that come to my mind is ASROCK; NZXT; Gigabyte; and MAXSUN. Which I have been avoiding all my life.   Now what do we do as a community...
It's nice to know we've got a few big guns in our corners as consumers. These corporations are getting out of control. I've been Using MSI for a couple generations now. My first board from them started going wonky about 18 months after I bought it. It was outside the 1 year instore warranty but MSI replaced it no questions asked, and sent me a new board directly to my house at no cost. It arrived in 3 or 4 days and I was back and running. I've been buying their boards ever since. I haven't had any problems personally with ASUS but it sounds like they're definitely riding the scumbag train for this latest drama surrounding them. A corporation is only as good as the folks working for it.  I'm not sure what Jay is referring to when he says he doesn't know if his AMD is stable or not, dude I've been running AMD for decades and have been running just fine. All my games run just fine and my OS stability is solid.
I had the exact same issues with the GoXLR software losing audio or failing to pick up the GoXLR Mini so i ditched my GoXLR mini and switched to the Elgato Wave XLR instead.
I am going through the same thing. I have a Crosshair hero as well, it has been RMA'd three times now and still, it takes 30+ min to get this PC to boot up, crashes, BSOD's. I have replaced every single part in this pc multiple times and no resolution. all ASUS wants to do is RMA again and unfortunately I can not spend any more money on this and will have to live with it in the states its in now. First time using ASUS products and definitely the last time.
I was checking motherboards since the Amd 4XX days. And check some gens after that. The reviews always end showing that Asus is nothing more than a overpriced shit tier. Like, they never perform well enough to merit their prices, and that's even truer for their mid and low end products.
I almost always went to Asus, because of quality. But after hearing this, maybe  Z790-P is a problem in my new pc. From now on, I will probably omit Asus alltogether from my selection.
I'm less than two minutes in and I'm already taking ASUS off my list.  If they won't give a top-tier youtuber decent support, what hope does a regular consumer have?  I'm viewing this on my gaming PC full of ASUS parts from 2019.  I'll keep watching, but when it comes time to build a new rig, ASUS will not be part of it.
I've been building my own PCs since the late 90's and I've only ever used Asus motherboards. I'll definitely be looking at other options for my next build.
Their software sucks too. Every single time I shut down, armoury crate just resets everything. And I have tried all the fixes. Nothing syncs, once I shut down, it's useless.
I know for me with Asus brand. I had a motherboard come with issues. As I didn't really care as they weren't really a big deal, but it got worse over time. To the point where I can never get to bios. So I get a ARMA request, and did all the filing then one issue happened. They wanted me to pay about $85+ in shipping. For me that is crazy, I'm in the USA as well so I don't see why that would be so expensive. So I never sent it, I waited about 5 months til I was confrontable paying it. So I had to redo the process again and when I explained it to the employee there, he was oh here then we got you covered. Your product is under warranty so you are fine. And I was like waaaa? So I could've had it sooner.   Got the motherboard and it works brand new. They gave me a new one since the one I had was that bad.
Same thing with their phones. Amazing hardware but their software destroys the phone. Bought the Asus ROG 6 Pro and their updates would break simple things such as bluetooth pairing, or even recent app button not doing anything. Took them 3 MONTHS to fix one bug and then broke more features of the phone. Switched to a S23u and zero issues. Sucks cause I use to love Asus and had 3 of their phones (out of 7 total ever) and always had issues from them.
I couldn't agree more!!! I recently did my first build after following JTCs instructions videos. I've had the worst time with my Asus X670E board. RMA process had been a complete joke and my problem will never get fixed. Wish I would have held off a while longer and seen this video before I started my build.
Man. It is crazy to see this spiral companies are going through. I almost expected to see a fire pit come up.
Watch as all of jays Asus stuff breaks down after this vid haha
Given that Asus bricked my mobo via a dodgy BIOS update only this morning, i'm very much in the screw Asus camp.
Thank you for making this video, but it’s because of you I’ve bought asus tuf gaming motherboard so dude wtf ?
This is why I have been watching your channel for the last 3 years, Jay! Huge respect to you, mate, a man with principles. So often lost by those who say they represent the consumer, but the money speaks loader.
None of this comes as a surprise to me. A number of years ago I returned 3 identical motherboards to Asus because I could not get into the BIOS - before I found out that the particular one required use of VGA for it and DVI / HDMI ports only worked once an operating system installed. This was not mentioned by any of the people at Asus I talked to nor in the manual that came with the board. I found this out because I did not want to return it again for a fourth board and searched online for the answer. And if I had not found the explanation I would have driven 7 hours to my friends' house without the computer I had intended to build for a college buddy's mother-in-law. She would have had to pay more than I asked for it. Make that much more. Edit: Needless to say, I have never purchased anything from Asus since.
Few years back even though ASUS was my favorite mobo brand but they screwed my board twice with bios Update, Chip was fried and I had give up one them.  Since then I am using either gigabyte or asrock.. But X670E Taichi I currently use isn't perfect either
Most of this is about the AMD side of their motherboards. What about the INTEL side. Are they having the same issues?  Jay?
Jay Aorus z790 extreme  discontinued??  Are there more problems then we think perhaps with all mb manufacturers?  Platform??  Something smells and its not just the AMD processors!
To be honest I have a z790 Apex board from Asus paired with my 13900k and I’m pretty delighted by the performance.   That said, it sucks for them to be in this situation but they could’ve just taken some accountability and fix the issue.
If you weren't under no contract with them this video didn't even exists so I find you a little ipocrit now mister Jay...and no, I'm not a fanboy of Asus or any other brand, they act all the same at some point
I bought a Maximus Z790 board just a few days after launch with a i9 13900k,after 1 Month of use started to get random blue screen crashes,I have a gigabyte 4090 and I thought it was that but after Long periods of time and troubleshooting I discover that the problem was with dimm slots 1 and 3,and I test it with different modules of ram and the results were consistent,the rma was a total nightmare ,I opted for the advanced rma replacement they offer since I work with my computer and can’t afford to wait for the rma process to be completed (according to ASUS around 15 days)I spent more than a month waiting for them to have some board like mine on stock so they could do the advanced replacement,long story short,I ended un buying an exact same board from Best Buy and sent the faulty one back for repair or replacement,12 days later I got back the board saying that they couldn’t replicate the issue I stated in the rma claim,I did a quick test and the problem was there still,I ended up giving the board to a friend as a gift and he’s been using it with only 2 dimm slots working,I’m crossing my fingers every day,hoping I have better luck with the board a have now ,I’m never buying ASUS products again ,hope this serves as a testimony to someone still deciding on which brand to go,I’ve used ASUS product for a very long time but that is ancient history now ,the quality is just not there anymore
I have an asus z790-p for i7 12gen its my first and only build should I be worried? 😢
So, asus is looking like the ford of pc parts. Can someone tell me who the toyota would be? So I can buy their stuff?
I have no respect for Asus I worked in it for 22 years supporting up to 3000 users , rma with Asus has always been poor , there all n . One design from about 6 years ago had a know hardware design flaw causing it to cook the graphics , but would they replace it under warranty, no so every 45 days we lost 4 different machines. It took taking the suppler to court to get our money back,   The android notebooks that most colleges got to do remote classes, they wouldn’t supply replacement parts, even the budget desktops for classes had a 10% failure within 6 months, the supplier went to msi, and gigabyte,   Now I only put asrock, msi , gigabyte ,  allran for 4  years zero problems ,
what A SUS motherboard manufacturer
Sick burn! Had it been any other brand I would have a reaction but I've never liked Asus and never bought an Asus product because I've always had the feeling of them beeing  'haughty' and it turns out I was right. Good call Jay.
Hi jayz. I'm a student from Bangladesh. I'm struggling to buy a gaming PC for myself. I really love gaming but i can't afford a decent gaming PC. Can you please help me? I'll be grateful. My dream is to play the latest AAA games at max settings. Please help me?
WOW. Just how much bad press is it going to take to get a manufacturer to get their sh*t together.
Huh...maybe I shouldn't have gotten a laptop from Asus lol.
Honestly, I don't have an ASUS Motherboard. I avoided them because of a Gtx 980 I had. They kinked a fan cable under a cable tie against a cpu heatpipe during manufacturing.  Basically, it was 1 month out of warranty, the fan over the gpu died from heat up cool down cycles & the cable fold.  They gave me 0 reassurances about it that I wasn't going to be paying shipping repair etc.   I ended up buying fans from Ali Express and rigging them to the gpu.   The 980 is still running right now, no thanks to Asus.
Been watching your vidz now and then for the last couple months.  As an amateur PC builder that has built probably 30 systems for myself, friends and/or family over the years with ASUS products, I really appreciate this info....subbed!  And Jayz got ballz!  I dig it!  👊  Oh....I'm firing ASUS too.  ✊
A few years ago I got a ROG Strix RX 5700 XT, yes, it was that one. Amazingly, it was good for just over a year when it failed as I tried to upgrade my system. No help from Asus even after the company I bought it off "lost" the RMAd card and only wanted to refund me 70% of purchase price. In the end I had to threaten that company with court and then they only gave me a full refund at the height of graphic card pricing.
I was a big fan of asus this sucks, i'll need to see big change
Well shit… I’ve used so many ASUS boards over the last decade (z67 -> Z170, as well as X79 & X99) and had solid experience. So sad to see a brand drop this fast. Thank-you for your integrity.
I thoroughly appreciate a video like this. It is not just the fact that you as a bigger influencer stand up against this kind of behaviour (and perhaps manage to make some changes, wishful thinking, I know), but also simply from the consumer perspective of what products to buy and what to avoid. I will be avoiding ASUS motherboards for sure, for the foreseeable future, and all their other products as well, if possible.  Both this and Steve's video(s) are outright shocking. Not just the failure(s) that happen, but the response from a company you have literally given hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Just terrible.
Seasonic has no problems, right?
I've had the same issues you experienced with my 10850k in msi meg unify z590. to add  the sound would drop from everything  programs/  games crash  videos would act like a crashed link graphical error of all kinds
why cant they have a warranty like Evga does!
👍👍
I guess Asus needs a new PR manager.  Because these kind of mistakes they make, and blatantly not giving a shit about their customers isn't what they used to be. Something changed, and it's not great.  So what caused it all? Who fucked up?
I installed, SEVERAL years ago, the first ASUS P2B motherboard with a Celeron 300A. Since then I've always stayed with Asus and the few times I've gone with other brands for friends with a tight budget, it's always worked out in a bunch of problems. Since then I have bought and installed at least 15 of their motherboards without the slightest glitch even pushing the overclock to the limit..... and beyond. (sometimes the VRMs were really on edge) What you tell me is a blow to the heart of an old computer geek.
No shit. I remember like 10 years ago or so, seeing all problems with ASUS service and support from Eee PCs to tablets and other products. How things have gone full circle with motherboards! They lost it since the ROG branding gone out and became huge, in the old days you could get a standard ASUS board that works well but the extra flair with the ROG stuff (I think the ROG branding started late in the Core 2 days) and that Linus video saying ASRock *was* part of ASUS...maybe the good product team moved base?  (Jay's so serious the ending isn't complete, or power ran out after RGBing it last time?)
Fuuuuuck, I just built an ASUS X670E-E with an AMD 7900X back in January.  One complaint so far, I can't overclock my DDR5 memory. The MB will train the memory every boot up making my boot up take minutes every time.
talking 1 lot of old bollocks
Appearently Asus isnt familiar with the CPA (consumer protection act)!
...the second I went live this happened.   Tik Tok ad??? 😂
Thank you! I’ve always found ROG overpriced and overrated but everyone and their mom buys one and craps on everything else.
ok, I support your decision, untill you say its ok I will never buy any ASUS product nor recommend one anymore!
Thnk you for the heads up, as i was looking to Upgrade certain parts for my Rig from Asus well just the Mother board but upone watching and hearing tish time go Give MSI a chance i was already interested in the Motherboard so now without a doubt i will buy an MSI board.... Thanks JayZ2CenT
mad respect!! always looking out for the viewers and wants whats best for us and literally cut ties with a source of income because of their dirty doings. just makes me trust jay even more for doing this. its a shame it had to come to that though
Wow, that's a hard truth, and something of a bitter pill, given the amount of ASUS gear I have. Another commenter here said they'd been hearing since their childhood that ASUS was the go-to brand when you needed reliability: I'm one of the people who has been saying that since their childhood.   But the downward slide has been some time in the making, I've been hearing more and more whispers of reliability and QC issues in the last several years whenever I would go to do a build or buy a part. So far I've been lucky, I guess, but I won't be risking it any more. I was loyal because of quality, reliability and good customer service, and if those things are out, so am I.  Now, though, who takes their place? Is there anyone else now who can fill the shoes of "go-to reliability and quality"? Or is it just a crapshoot from part to part?
I doubt this will be the wakeup call they need but I hope it happens before it's too late as, like you said Jay the products Asus puts out looks top notch. Doesn't do much good if the rest is subpar.
Ya I've been looking for a white motherboard for 13th generation intel that matches my asus Helios white edition case
@7:54 that's how I got a "brand" new motherboard from Newegg shipped to me, I had gotten a ASUS ROG STRIX B450-F GAMING II. The MB doesn't seem to have any problems but I was pretty annoyed seeing it came from China and was clearly slightly used despite paying for new.
Aloha Jay, Thank you for this video, I been looking to build a new PC and have always been an ASUS motherboard guy, am so glad that I seen this video before making my purchase, you saved me and others from possible headaches. With that said what motherboard would you recommend? I’m looking at i7 13700k processor   Mahalo for your awesome content.
@JazyTwoCents , which brand will you recommend today? Because MSI afer sale support is crap in the EU.
I'd really like some input now after watching this video!!! I've been planning an ASUS/LIAN LI build since the 13900k was released, but finances have made me buy in increments. I've got the case (011 Xl ROG Certified) and the PSU (Tuf 1000w ATX 3.0, 80 plus gold)... I was planning on using the Z790 hero board and the TUF or ROG RTX4080 and the RYUJIN 2 360 AIO (with uni inf fans on it in push/pull with the ASUS fans mounted on the top of the rad)... I've been visualizing this build complete with the ASUS/Lian Li theme all this time, then I saw this video! I respect this channel and it's opinion so now I'm hesitant... Any advice?
Pleas Asus send me the stuff he dosent want! I can use it  real good
I'm so glad I went with MSI this time around. the board I wanted from asus was 700 frickin dollars. MSI's board of similar spec was 500. so it was a no brainer. the asus ROG line is waaaay too overpriced
Hmm.  Time to switch to Gigabyte or MSI or ASROCK.   ASUS has some quality control to sort out for the next few years.
I was always an asus guy and I already spent the money on an Asus mobo and gpu.  I honestly regret using them for this generation's build.
I just build my pc one day ago with an ASUS motherboard does that mean that I can throw it away or?
A day ago, Asus was the only motherboard vendor I would have considered buying from. I've held that respect for their quality since my first build in 2006.
I never feel comfortable about Asus and their products, specially when they are Soo overpriced
That was brutal!
i have an asus board and an x3d chip, am i ok?
I wonder how this product confidence will affect their new RoG Ally handheld?
I have a Crosshair VIII Hero Wi-Fi. Should I be worried?
Asus has set themselves up for a class action lawsuit. They’re going to be forced to honor the warranty eventually. They’d be smart to just say, “We fucked up. Every customer that purchased the following boards are covered.” before it gets that far.
Why you guys didnt said that a month ago :/ and i wanted to update bios on my asus mbo dam...
oouch
Because of my OCD, I can't just throw away the ROG. But what I can do is just put off upgrading my PC until it's safe to do so. If it takes too long for them, instead of upgrading, I will simply switch completely to another model line from another manufacturer. So they will not only lose money for the motherboard, but also a lot more money for the GPU and a small amount of money for other parts for which I will no longer require compatibility with ASUS Aura sync.
Good call dude, and I know how big a part of the channel the relationship has been so it’s for sure a tough one. I hope Asus pulls their sh*t together fast, fesses up, takes the hit, and comes back fighting hard.
I'm so happy, I just installed an ASUS mobo. Was tempted to get an MSI but I went to save a bit.
I will not be buying any Asus product
Hell of a problem to have.
I'm by no means an expert on the subject, I'm just a 50 year "young" enthusiast, an enthusiasm I've carried with me since I was a kid when my parents bought me the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k... It was a passion from day one, which has lasted until today. Not being an expert, I always looked for brands that offered me greater security and reliability, and ASUS, despite always being more expensive compared to the competition, was always at the top of my choices. Today's video has shattered all my expectations... everything I've ever taken for granted has just collapsed! Personally, apart from the high prices, I've never had any problems with anything from ASUS. It so happens that I am, at this very moment, in the decision process for the renovation of my 100% ASUS gaming pc, which is already 5 years old and is already in need of renovation. Obviously I was thinking about continuing with ASUS, but today's video left me lost. As I'm not an expert, could you give me some tips on which brands i should be looking for that have quality and reliability? The renovation will be complete, starting with the ATX case, going through the motherboard, processor, ram, gpu and ending with the power supply. The only things I don't need are peripherals... I bought my monitor, keyboard and mouse very recently and will keep them. In terms of requirements, I want a pc that will allow me to play any title with full HD quality, 1440p. Could you give me some advice?
and here i am with a newly bought asus gpu.... whoopsie
It's AMD not ASUS re: your home build.  I see lots of problems with AMD.  Intel is more reliable.  MSI great product.
Big props
I posted this comment on your video from a couple of days ago but I'm gonna drop this here again as a cautionary tale surrounding ASUS.  I bought a monitor from ASUS directly (an OLED PG42UQ) and it was terrible. It showed up in a box stinking of wet warehouse, it didn't work great, flickering and all sorts of QC issues. I organised a refund because I wasn't happy with it, and it got "destroyed in transit" and now I'm out 1600 bucks and they're refusing to cooperate. The damage dealt to it was, looking at the photograph they sent me, only really possible if they dropped it outside of the packaging after unboxing it in their warehouse, but they're insisting I packaged it up wrong. Absolute scam artists. Avoid ASUS like the plague.
Thanks for the heads up. I have purchased ASUS ROG parts for the last 3 or so PC builds I did for my personal rigs and this is extremely disappointing. I would be so pissed if I got new HW and it melted down because I just do not have the cash to turn around to buy more. I watched Gamers Nexus vids as well. Some seriously shady BS there. :(
Legit I always liked Asus products, then I bought a router from them a couple of years ago that flat out died after a day. And rather than offer a refund or a replacement, their response was, "Oh well - just return it to Amazon."  And I've never bought another Asus product since.
tell me more about this megaman build!!! details please.
It must be pretty bad if Jay is making a video like this.
That's why I'm a console gamer. Too many hoops on pc to jump through just to game  and way too exoensive
Yea I recently did a build for a family member with an Asrock board and it was a much better experience than the 3 other computers I recently built with Asus boards AND CHEAPER. The Asrock board was plug and play with no armoury crate bs also Asrock has better packaging now. Them putting a small foam pad under the motherboard stopped it from banging and scratching against the box and puncturing the anti static bag(all 3 Asus boards punctured the bad and dug decent size holes inside the box). Asrock>Asus 100%
Where were you for the 50 bios updates for x570 Jay?
quality has gone to sh1t
WOW... I am not a fanboy.. but I am a loyal customer to whom does me well.. my only 2 board makers I have used in years, EVGA and ASUS.. well, yeah... They did me right on a Z690 Hero that my contact frame stuck to the cpu and then let loose and fell on the socket.. my fault.. they repaired it for 120.00 or so.. when they clearly say no repairs on bent pins. but even with that said, I have seen plenty of the USB devices disconnect and reconnect issues you mentioned, I was lucky my Z690 Hero did not have the backwards caps, I have had no issues with my Z790 Hero other than as we ALL know, ASUS puts too much voltage to the CPUs and if left on auto will cause issues.. but oddly enough their AIOC works beautifully. I now have no EVGA and no reliable ASUS boards down the road... sad times..
Good for you, Jay!  Like I said in Steve's video, ASUS was the recommended, go-to build of choice for whenever I built AMD-based systems for clients.  Not anymore.  I was even contemplating them for my own build but this is pretty insane, not counting your experiences, too.
Yeah thanks to my amd rog motherboard i mean expensive mobo i tried to boot with a 3400g of my friend! When i boot the first thing i did was playing flight sim 2020 and i put ryzen master and when i saw it was 1.65v i was like that has to be wrong! Nope it was right and soon the cpu died thanks to my mobo. I didnt oc or touch the bios at all it was auto
I was with Asus since P2B in 1998. This ends now.
Jay I do drugs all day and got my 7950x3d running on their terrible march bios in like 10mins  Retire
I've had an ROG laptop for the last 2 years and also had some weird issues that are still going on. Random blue screens every so often. I can only play videos on youtube because every other video player will mess with my system by losing signal to my external display. Messaged them a few times about it and the only response was send it in for RMA. I need my laptop for work every day and cannot miss it for 3 - 4 weeks. For me that is enough to never buy an asus product again.
We got a lot of quality problems with asus boards on the last years, i also do not buy that,I do still buy TUF , thou ! Msi is also such a "shmughole"
its not everyone that has the b@lls to say FU to asus, but Jay and Steve are not afraid to step up, thats why regarding tech your and Steve  are the man, massive respect to both of you for not beeing afraid of tell it how it is, remember LG fiasco with GN....thanks for all you do, keep it up...
One word: Respect
So for now I'm looking at any other brand other than ASUS for a future build. Thank you for the information!
8:55 No, it IS her problem if she's your Asus rep. What it isn't, is her fault.
I know this from years before, bought 2 mobos from asus with same issue (buzzy noise into earphones...). their quality is going down from times of ryzen 1000/2000 series (that mobo was b450 f rog crap). haha and swaped for asrock x470 g4 gaming fatality and its rocking 5800x3D right now.
Great words Jayz.  Think this is a problem we may see again in the future. Hope Not. Thanks for everything you bring to us. ❤
I have been failing at diagnosing constant game crashes and BSOD’s for months now on a brand new build. I have an asus x670e and a Ryzen 5 -7600x. Could my issue be this same mobo issue?
everything you mentioned is also happening on pro art boards as well ive been having issues like this for months and been wondering wtf is going on. i run a pro art b550 with a 5900x and does everything your pc is doing as well. im going with a different motherboard and my friends building pcs are returning and not buying asus tech.  ALSO: when i bought my motherboard and got everything installed on it in order to even get the computer to POST we had to do 2 bios flashes. its never worked out of the box. i have random blue screens almost daily, random memory leaks, operating system lockups, frame drops randomly on a screen doing nothing (even just certain apps), usb ports shutting off randomly, displays constantly disconnecting and reconnecting (even tried completely separate model screens same outcome), connected devices becoming undetectable until driver re-install at the registry level (razer products, logitech, steelseries, corsair/elgato, and even my internal m.2 had to manually have the driver reinstalled), ethernet ports not failing but drivers corrupting every few weeks and i have to safe mode registry remove the driver and reinstall it to work in bridged mode (makes 2 ethernet ports act as 1 for even less latency). its the only board for under $300 that runs 2 thunderbolt 4 type-c ports and 2 2.5GB ethernet ports on a single board for AMD side of things. WHY DOES NOBODY ELSE OFFER A COMPETITOR BOARD FOR THIS PRICE BRACKET & FEATURES?
Wish I'd went for an EVGA mobo and Intel new gen instead of Asus and AMD....
I had RMA’d an ASUS TUF 6900 GPU 5 times and everytime i got one that was either defective or Dead on Arrival. Shame they’ve fell so far. Bought a Zotac 3080ti and have been just fine.
This video has made me look at alternatives to ASUS now, not over the bios warranty issue, but the way the company treated you.  If they treat you that way, how do you think they will treat the rest of us? Looking at ASRock for a 13900k build, avoiding MSI due to the recent key leak issue.
Transparency is always more appreciated. And ASUS redirecting and hiding is not a good thing. Glad it's brought to attention
Just built my Itx build with a B760-I, lol cool stuff. So if not Asus, what brand would you recommend? I've heard you not care for or complain about Gigabyte before and EVGA is very high end stuff with the 2 modern boards out. So is AsRock and MSI are new saviors?
I was literally in the process of buying two new Asus monitors when I saw this video come up.  It made me reconsider, and I went with Samsung instead.   Bye, Felicia!
I have been using MSI which been dramatically better than Asus boards way back with AM2, AM3 I used MSI and AM4 too
ASRock has come a long way. My b550 Steel series is running fine since day one.
ASUS definitely stopped caring about quality and their customers. Thank you for making this video! 🎯
Asus as woke as Budweiser .
Does anyone knew of a less expensive AM5 motherboard that also is solid ass an ASSRock?
Well this sucks. Just did a new build about a month ago and went with a asus amd combo. Now im nervous turning my PC on.
Every single ASUS product I've owned has died catastrophically: 3xMotherboards 1xNvidia GPU  That was enough dead hardware for me to swear off ASUS. Now that was 10 years ago, but looks like things have only gone downhill since then.
ASUS to me has always seemed to be overpriced compared to competitors.
I suspect, they'll  wipe out the disclaimer regarding voiding warranties very very soon.  It seems likely Youtube reviewers have been receiving RMA refurbs for a long time.  Asus just got complacent.  They'll likely double down first, have a public conversation with some influencer and then make changes to show their behavior  is genuine.  They'll likely capitalize on that attention too.
Thank you, was just starting planing a new build. ASUS is now out. Looks like ASRock is my only choice. Can not go MSI due to their keys being hacked.
Finally, feel a bit vindicated after having so many issues with ASUS and being treated like I’m the crazy one.
This vid is spot on. ASROCK used to be shite low end bidget crap not anymore but I always buy MSI mobos & just recently got an MSI Ventus x3 4070. MSI all the way. My expercience with ASUS was bad. Gigabyte = Gigashite. I have an MSI z790 now. My z87 lasted 10 years and still going strong. I gave up with Gigabyte after my Athlon XP 2400. Now the MSI 4070, have seen reviews saying how good it is. 63c max on MSFS. 300Mhz+ clock on core & 1000Mhz on RAM. Superb. MSI mobos are bullet proof. VRM's are awesome. 13700K, 5.7Ghz all P core @ 1.36v.
do we need to worry about amd4 platfrom's? i know it's amd5
This hurts to watch as an ASUS fan boy. But it has to be done. They needed to be held accountable
and that's why you always go for stability instead of aesthetics. Great win for ASRock honestly.
good thing i never had any asus products
You have my support, Jay!
4:16 lol good one.
Jay thinks asus actually gives a fuck
This is only a problem in the Usa, because the politcal agenda not to buy from taiwan and china and more push brands like domestic companys like Evga. Boards in europe is prestine and coverd by warranty. Sorry dudes blame ur goverment.
ASUS used to be so good
I remember a few years ago, I went asus motherboard for my PC due to they were really solid. And, I've seen the slippery slope they've went down in about 3-4 years. Covid really made alot of people stop trying.
I respect jays opinion
I got a motherboard about 1 and 1/2 years ago and it had bent pins in the socket like 3 or 4 and I was able to fix them and haven't had any issues. It was a Z690-E strix board. I7 12700k, 32gb ddr5 and a 3080ti.
Gigabyte is the new king now, because they knew not to overvolt it and then lowered the voltage again in their BIOS updates before any other manufacturer took action.
I have the strix x570f and i sent it into asus because it stopped working. They had it back to me pretty quick during the pandemic. This hurts because ive always used asus products and hearing now they dont care hurts.
Msi not that great either their aio's have been causing problems with blockages and they just didn't want to know
We just got the new gen ASUS ROG 14" laptop with the 4060. So many weird power problems. Often it took two boots to get Windows up. With the unit closed running on battery it would reboot every few minutes. A ton of Kernel Power errors.
You see, there are several things you need to know about warranties in the US ASUS. I learned much of this from lawyers who cover car warranties but the same rules apply to everything with a warranty. The first critial thing you have to remember when writing a warranty is that anything expressed in the advertisements to sell the product, cannot be disclaimed/undone with a disclaimer. These advertizements are called "expressed warranty". These are things like, the engine displacement or HP on the advertisement, website, or window sticker for a car. Another example would be a newspaper advertisement for a TV at a department store that said the screen size, resolution, and refresh rate. This even applies to used cars. Now the other kind of warranty is called an "implied warranty" lets talk about cars again as an example. An implied warranty is that the car runs and is in good condition,  another implied warranty is that the car is legal to drive and licence in the state it is being sold(and the county as a whole) With an implied warranty, you can disclaim your obligations in almost all instaces with a warranty disclaimer like "sold as is" Again critically "sold as is" does not cover expressed warranties In other words, if a used car lot advertizes a COPO camaro that "dyno tested to 900HP, engine just inspected and will last thousands of miles" they can still sell it as is, but if it doesnt dyno test to at or around 900HP(or over), or if it breaks down after 1500 miles of normal driving, then they still have to cover their expressed warranty.  Now lets talk about something in the electronics industry For instance, lets take this totally hypothetical scenario, if the product page for say, a SUSA GOR Gunsight X670E Intensity says "supports 6400MT/s RAM" Then a warranty from say, a BIOS update from SUSA cannot legally disclaim that, not even the warranty for the X670E motherboard can disclaim it.  Another critical thing is that, if you make 3rd party parts, and your part damages a different company's part, you might be on the hook for damages, even if your part was undamaged, though with electronics this complex, damage is very hard to point definite blame, even with damage this obvious, most damage of this nature is invisible, exploding CPUs basically never happen.
Truly. SCREW YOU ASUS 🖕🖕🖕🖕 . Try to pull such a dirty handed tactic to rid yourselves of having to honor warranty claims, you don't deserve to have any customers.
This is odd and concerning. When I setup my Asus X570 Pro Art Board, I had to drop voltages way back from the base settings. Before and after updating to windows 11 I've had odd stability issues and USB issues.  Well my Intel PC is unlikely to be an ASUS based build. Shame. Ive been a fan since I received amazing customer service on an ROG laptop I bought from them in university
Hey Jay, I bought a MSI RTX 3080 Ventus 3X and have RMA'd it now 4 times with in 2 months.  I decided to go with Gigabyte and have no problems so far.  If not ASUS, do you recommend MSI over Gigabyte?
Ever since the Pandemic, people have been giving two shits less. They either don't do their job, half ass shit, or just don't want to work. This is a result stems to the many BS we have been dealing with brands and companies alike. Sure this thing has always existed but it had been exponential since Covid. Now people have that sense of Entitlement like the world HAS to give them this or that. Agree with me or not, the results we see here today with companies like ASUS is a clear example of "Fck you, give us money".
Are we certain it is a board/bios failure and not just a marginality in the cpu.
Feels good to have just put an ASUS motherboard in my new build. 😢 Already having issues with ethernet and audio.
Imagine being so absolutely shit, a Content Creator judges you unworthy of *GIVING THEM MONEY*  Fuck ASUS. Thank god my country has amazing consumer protection laws, or I'd be fucked because of them.
Been buying ASUS motherboards for myself and my friends builds since the 90s. Time to look elsewhere.
My Asus MAXIMUS VII HERO build was also a nightmare. Made my Intel I7-4790K run so hot (100C) it automatically shut down during simple tasks. My own fix was to disable Turbo mode. After I bought new PC I did a BIOS update on the old rig, and viola now it runs temps in the mid 80's when turbo is enabled, at max all core workload. This experience made me initially turn off of both Intel and Asus, but now I see it was just an Asus problem. Asus overvolted the CPU. Current platform is MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk and 5600X CPU, and it runs without a hitch. I could very well go with MSI again when next upgrade is due.
My old 10th gen intel PC had a maximus hero motherboard and I constantly had ALL the exact issues you were describing that happened during your stream. Do you think it was the ASUS mobo?
I've been building my computers personally since 1999, and I have always stuck to Intel and Gigabyte brands. None of my builds or any computer I've built for my friends or family ever had any hardware-related issues, and I can testify that a build I made in 2008 is still running! There was a time when the companies actually cared for their customers - a time long gone, I'm afraid.
Thanks for the honesty Jay and thanks for this frank update. I'm pricing up a new build which had featured Asus motherboard and GPU. After watching yours and Steve's videos I've swapped brand. A shame as Asus used to create solid products
I'm very confused as to why both you and Steve are so focused on the beta BIOS that has the disclaimer when there's the earlier 1303 BIOS that claims to fix the issue, with no beta label and no disclaimer. All you need is to click "show all" to see it.
Give AMD another shot.
Currently have an ASUS gaming laptop, was looking to build an ASUS DDR5 build this year, I guess I will be going with another brand instead.
10:09  ads pops up XD
huge respect for this one Jay
Even if the end-user doesn't choose to buy another ASUS machine or component, they - having their computer rendered damaged or inoperable - are forced en-masse to return to the market, giving the company at least a *chance* to score additional revenues. It's just good business.  Right?
Seems to me that a Beta Bios should never be released to the consumer unless it has been tested. Especially when it comes to operational voltages.
I'm with Jay.
This has got me thinking I know and and Asus are separate companies my mind is thinking do I build Intel really got me thinking.
and here i thought Nintendo was the top dog for being anti-consumer, seems asus is giving them competition.
i'm pretty sure that BIOS thing is illegal. you can't offer a solution to a problem that is inherent to your product and then say "if you use the solution you lose your warranty". i had to RMA my MSI B650 because it had issues since day one and i double checked on their site about the beta BIOS that i installed in hopes that it will fix the problem. fortunately they don't have any disclaimer about it voiding warranty.
I just got an Asus board and GPU should I just send them back?
I never tried asrock, but my next build will be with asrock.
I am so glad you finally dropped ASUS, i had to drop them back in the FX days of AMD because of similar reasons, went with Gigabyte and so far, even they have issues, but the customer service fixes everything, so I can't be that mad.
No... trash them all.... forget their response....
get a core i9 and get stability.
Dam.  I ordered an Asus z690 Hero board before I saw this video.  I have been using a  hero maximus IX board and works good.  Hopefully I don't have a bad experience with the new board.
Of my gaming group, three of them have ASUS boards, one has an MSI, and I have an ASRock. The ones who have had issues? The three ASUS ones. And this is both X570 and X670 examples.
I have always prefered asus boards no matter what, i even bought a B550 TUF gaming motherboard for my 5800X to replace my broken Aorus board, i guess i am checking out asrock now in future builds
So after games being playable after a year of patches and bug fixes.. Hardware is next now? We now need to wait a year for shit to be stable and fully supported? First the vapor chamber stuff with amd, now motherboards from asus. Whats next
Hi all is there a problem with asus usb 3.0 ports mines intermittent I'm on windows 10 on an oldish board asus z97-p
Not to mention ASUS has the worst warranty service on the market and their latest Strix cards have coil whine issues
13:16 And ASRock used to be ASUS heh
Thanks to Asus Shintel shills are crying about AMD X3D chips and Loserbenchmark will have fuel to put into the fire a long time to come. Thanks Asus
I just finished my build and I used the Z790 Asus Tuf D5. I am now terrified
Me checking to make sure the board I just bought is an AsRock and not an Asus 😅
yikes. Asus has been my go to brand for everything. They just flushed that down the toilet in a matter of days
hot damn asus i always bought asus motherboards i like there bios layouts the most and more simple less glammer than most saying that im still on a z390-a dont know what i will get in the future if i upgrade
After ABIT went tits up in I've turned to Asus. Asus Maximus Formula X38 broke after 3 years. Just died. Then there was a Sandy Bridge P8P67 I got on the day of the premiere (January 2011), which died after 15 minutes... The replacement board died after 18 months. I bought a cheap Gigabyte board, which is functional to this day... In 2014 I have decided to go with Asus MAXIMUS VII RANGER Intel Z97 which died after 23 months. The replacement board works to this day in my mom's PC.  After that I've decided to never go Asus again. My Gigabyte Z490 works fine after 3 years. Now I got MSI Z790. The BIOS is quirky, software sucks beyond belief, but it works fine. In order for me to try Asus again, they would have to get rid off the "brand tax" (which is probably 20% extra compared to MSI and Gigabyte) and be more competitive pricewise.   Why would I even think of Asus again? Their graphics cards were always top notch. I had few of them over last 20+ years, starting with Riva TNT and every card had this premium feel and build quality. I still use my Asus XONAR STX for my headphones, however my biggest gripe is verry poor support. The card's design was faulty. After certain generation of graphics card, the microphone input started producing such interference when the graphics card is working in 3D mode, that it became unusable. And to this day Asus did not solve this issue on this sound card, or any other affected.  I also got Asus monitor, as a cheaper alternative was not available at the time of purchase. It's not perfect, but works fine.  Long story short: Asus failed me on more than one occasion. They had good and bad products. Their support was OK at times, but could also be very bad. Outside of graphics cards, I cannot recommend any of their products, based on the "brand tax" alone.
So instead of taking the high road and making a video on how they can regain your confidence, you kick them to the curb. That's unfortunate.
My MSI B650 Pro Wifi died using my 7900X it's delided and capped at 95W
I just canceled my ROG Ally pre-order after seeing this and Steve's videos. I always used Asus MB's on all my builds for the past 15 years. Never again, they have destroyed all their own credibility.
it's sad that this is the direction asus is going, and this has the potential to put asus into a perceived low end brand and another will take their place
Tell Asus go have a Butt Light.
I still will pick Asus over MSI any day
Asus could be in shit now because big channels with lot of viewers  and that means  potential buyers could show middle finger to Asus
Are you overreacting?  Agreed that Asus is not being the ideal company, but when one overclocks their equipment, it is possible that bad stuff can happen, and that the warranty was voided.  So by your logic, you are making a fuss that you deliberately did something to your equipment and that you bear no responsibility????
This is why people need to ditch brand loyalty.  It doesn't matter if my asus 6900xt was RMAd so easily, with minimal troubleshooting, and  and completely replaced in 3 days.  They are still capable of shit like this.
Dear Jay: Please use lotion or stop rubbing your hands. It is a trigger for my sound sensitivity being neuroatypical.
😂 stop beating around the bush. tell us what you really think of Asus products.
What is a good alternative? I Don't like the msi bios/mobos
I'd really be interested in you swapping that Asus board in your personal rig for one from a different brand - just out of curiosity and to see if it's the 7950x3D cpu / AM5 platform leading to all the issues or if it's really the mainboard. Maybe just a temporary swap for testing - in case you still want to go Intel anyways. I'm personally running a 5800x/980Ti/MSI-B550 build and it's rock-solid. Not a single bluescreen for over a year with me using it for gaming, intensive video encoding, a lot of other random tasks/programs, sometimes running 3 days nonstop, etc. Kinda makes me not want to upgrade anything because stability can actually only get worse.
its bad that Asus made such a shitty products and in the same time its expensive!!
Glad I have never had a problem. gonna keep using them till I do
That is sad, ASUS used to be the best gear you could get, been using their stuff for 20yrs+ now, but this sounds like they lost the plot completely. Almost all my personal builds have ASUS premium level boards in them and I used to recommend them as the top tier brand based on my personal experience, and the multitude of issues I've had through the years with competing brands like MSI primarily, ABit used to work but they didn't have the features, and then went away. I have several builds with ASUS ROG stickers on the front and themed color schemes in other components. Of course I've occasionally had issues, but they were handled well by their reps, and by my recommendation many of my friends have ASUS kit, mostly ROG. Guess I'll have to reconsider that now.
Have you benchmarked some Asus boards without Expo enabled? lol.
I'm really struggling now! Since I can remember I always saved my money till I was able to purchase the needed new hardware from ASUS. Sadly I stupidly destroyed my Strix X570-F Gaming yesterday and need a new motherboard right now. But honestly going for a new ASUS is not possible, because everything besides Crosshair is out of stock and I'm not sure buying a new ASUS motherboard. The old ones I had, had always been great, but I don't thrust them anymore. It sounds to me they were raising the prices while reducing the quality! But which brand could be the new one to go for? I don't have any experiences with other brands? 15 years ago everybody was talking about Gigabyte building the best boards, but is it still the same? It seems MSI and Asrock are getting better and better?! I guess I have to go out into the hardware jungle and have to make a lot of new experiences!
Haha, I’m literally building a PC for my parents right now with an Asus B650E and a Ryzen 7800X3D (yes, my parents are both in their 60’s and H-core gamers, haha). I’ve always had good experiences with Asus, so this whole thing is a surprise to me.   But I fully expect this system for my parents to be seriously dope. Mini NR-200 case with an RTX 4080 Founders, 7800X3D, Noctua CPU cooler, and case fully loaded up with Noctua fans. It’s gonna be a dead-silent monster.
This makes me worried about my laptop. and quite thankful I bought a third party warranty
I will also say that the 12900ks with the z690 extreme combo has been crap, unstable as hell regardless what bios I have it will not do an XMP profile  I’ve tried four different sets of ddr5 , two different CPU’s I won’t be buying any Asus kit ever agian
loved the little after edit at 1:10 saying "for us to say 'Hey, keep your ~stuff~'" -probably edited over "shit" or something haha
I have a asrock b550 gaming a ac and im happy with it  I cant run higher than a 5600x but i knew that buying the board
To be fair shipping issues have nothing to do with the product, they can be transient problems caused by low wage workers and turnover at entry level positions. It's like blaming Mcdonalds corporate over a bad cheeseburger - not to ignore the other issues presented.
Such a shame, I always felt like ASUS had the best top of the line products, sure they were pricey, but they were worth it a lot of the time. They've even had some pretty good budget stuff, especially their routers. I wish EVGA would still make GPUs, I think they were the best on par with ASUS.
Well done!!! we like Truth go Jay
they're asking us to *beta test* their firmware. But if it causes a problem and the motherboard fails, they need it to examine it. But why would you send it back? You would send back, via RMA for example, if the warranty was *valid* .
I have 3 monitors ROG Swift OLED PG48UQ and the coile whine from them is wall breaking
Have had bad experience with Asus for years....
When  my Asus monitor failed it took 4  replacements before i received a working unit. The first monitor I returned they actually sent the very same monitor back to me but with extra damage from bad packaging in transit. The next two units were also broken in transit. Painful process.
AMD sucks anyway. I stick with intel.
Just RESPECT!  Jay if you are legitimately ceasing with ASUS. Huge respect! That is just unless they amend things in Jay's eyes/Asus customers. Never seen a youtuber this genuine, that his integrity digs past money and sticks up for the masses. LinusTT would not/nor would many Tech youtuber's, as money talks over integrity for them.
As a long term Asus buyer I can tell you their armoury software is total crap, I’ve yet to see a version that simple works , every time as it should - Asus have lost the plot sadly
Really the only surprise is that it took Jay this long to realize.  I've not had a single good experience with ASUS, going back as far as 2000.  Went to MSI and haven't looked back since then
i was just trying to sort a shopping list for a maxed out rig to spoil myself(complete overkill)and was going pure asus rog god tier, as i loved my old rog lappy.... last few days got me thinking with the news... now i cant afford to take a risk on maybes with rog.... thanks for the news...👍🏼 loving the channel from ireland🇮🇪
Asus = U Ass
Great to see people standing up to these brands. Consumers (and YouTubers) must stop rewarding corporate greed and putting up with this kind of behaviour. These companies make massive fortunes and treat their customers like sh1t.
Never thought I'd see the day when ASUS is no longer considered a viable brand to deal with. It's all I've been using for the past 23 years.
I love your honesty and your commitment to your viewers over your commitment to money, this is rare nowdays. Can you imagine those problems you had happening to an average Joe? They don't care about you and treated you like crap, in fact Joe wouldn't stand a chance. Thank you very much and God bless you. I'm from Brazil and almost all my pc parts are from Asus. I hope I don't need their assistance. Ha ha ha ..
Both asus prime motherboards I've purchased in the last 4-5 years have come with brand new packaging and faulty usb ports. I switched to msi last week. F u asus
damn just in time for the rog ally?
Wow, I only buy Asus cards and mobo for nearly 20 years now.  I have sent my last 2 ROG boards back to OCUK and they messed me about with warranty. FAQU ASUS Thanks JAY2C
Wow, asus was my go to for decades.
i was reading Asrock and ASUS are partners
Dude "requests" free motherboard, gets a free 800 euro motherboard replaced twice, and complains because it's not the right color :')
ASUS sucks from maaany years.... I use GIGAbyte from decade and they are just great, no matter if we talk about LGA 1366, AM3+, AM4 or even 775 and AM2...   Just buy Aorus and be happy, they are cheaper too...
Makes me sad to hear this kind of thing. I've been an Asus user for decades. 😢
As an ASUS (former) fan, this hurts. They really need to pull their head out of their ASuS. For shame!
I used to only get asus boards but the last 3 have had problems and after all the stuff that's been going on my latest system I went with a different brand. I want something reliable and just works
" The second I booted up my stream this happened..." You're fired Johnson!!
Remember when EVGA 10 series Cards had a problem and sometimes blew up ? Remember when EVGA admitted to the problem offering everyone help who came to them and told them that they had a card from Batch XYZ that could have the Problem ? yeah.... i miss EVGA too
This is why I keep subbed to this channel. Credibility and integrity. Greetings from the UK
I was using Gigabyte board for am4 and multiple people told me I should go with asus. So for am5 I bought Rog Strix B650A gaming board (because its white) and I am not happy with this choice. It started to have decent stability after third bios. But still getting random reboots. Bios returns to basic view all the time. Fan control sucks. Armory crate is directly from hell. And after this I am considering selling it and buy some other brand…
My Asus Gold certified PSU gone within 10 month!!
I also have the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670 Extreme board and have had NOTHING but issues since launch. I have been dealing with this Bullcrap for months and months and it is sickening. I bought multiple sticks of ram, NVME SSD's and tested everything I possibly could and I always knew it was the Mobo. I would randomly get blue screens, Crashes and failed startups with random Q-Codes that drove me nuts. Sometimes I would Get blue screens saying windows couldnt load properly because of missing files or just black screens with nothing. I have been having to reset my Bios almost every cold boot to get it to boot properly. I am now in the RMA process with them and waiting to see what happens but I will never touch an ASUS product again. This was my first time going AMD in like 15 years and I decided to go with the platform for the 7950x and longevity of the platform compared to Z790. Big mistake on my part as ASUS burned me and gave me a very bad experience to my return with AMD.  I am almost to the point of waiting for the RMA board, selling it and buying a difference brand.
I have known that Asus is a POS company since August 2012. In June 2012 I bought 2 Asus tf300t tablets. In July of 2012 I had to send one of the tablets to Asus because there was an issue. Today is may 12 2022 and I still haven't received my tablet back. I contacted them over 3 dozen times and all they told me is that they sent it back and there's nothing else they can do. So basically they stole $300 from me. Asus is the biggest bunch of thieves I've ever come across. I will never buy anything from Asus for as long as live.
I won’t be buying Asus again until they return back to being the best - they simply aren’t now
Yeah. If I had to choose to pick up any motherboard today, I would immediately grab ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Extreme no matter the cost. ASUS motherboards really pair well with INTEL PROCESSORS after all :) Just blame the motherboard while the real guilty is obviously in front of your nose :) Sorry, Jay. I'm also sure you will keep using ASUS components in future builds :)
Thank god we got msi
I stopped buying ASUS when I had a monitor that had several pixels out across the panel after 2 weeks of use, sent if for RMA, and they returned it and said that because the pixels weren't in the same group then it wasn't an RMA item, after they GAVE ME AN RMA FOR IT.  Yeah, done with ASUS.
I appreciate your advocacy.
I am on hold with their support for the 6th(!) time because they are literally stealing from me on my advanced RMA. I returned it with a label they gave me and even they have confirmed its return and said that they will release my funds. Then I get a system generated email saying I haven't returned it (lie) and charged me $260 for the fucken board. I hate Asus now. Its such a shame. Used to love them. But I am done. I will never do business with them again. Wow they just hung up on me.
I'm on to my 3rd dark hero and so this new gen failing like it is doesn't surprise me
Never bank a true experience on ASUS placeholder product type of design.
good to know.. no more asus for me.
so happy i stayed with intel i think if your going AMD go back to the FX chips :) why people still buying ASUS Boards after years and years of ram slot problems
Republic of fried*
Lol. Buys amd. Blames Asus for being garbage. Ok
Great video..  just wish i didn't buy my ROG Strix X670E-A a month ago... :(
I disagree. They give a warning. You agree to those terms when you download and flash it. I can not give them flak for _that_ .
"We don't judge a brand on their problems.  We judge a brand based on how they handle their problems."  OOF.    Are you going to trash all the affected Asus stock you have?  You can't sell it in good conscience and even just giving it away to your employees could set them up for failure.   If you are going to trash it, you should DEFINITELY throw it all in a grinder on film.  Edit:  This is assuming they refuse to honor the warranty due to their BIOS BS.
Another one bites the dust by the hands of reviewers..... keep it going... pretty soon there will be only Apple to purchase.
Unfortunately, my 7800x3d is already in the tuf x670e mobo. I was reluctant and almost went msi, maybe I should have.
This video may have just helped me solve an issue my Nephew has been having with his PC. He recently upgraded his build and has been dealing with random blue screens and game crashes like crazy. He is using an Asus motherboard with a Ryzen 5800x I believe.
If you're saying their quality went down and support sucks, man you must not work with HP or Lenovo alot lol. Arguably Dell is still the best IMO for support and overall quality, but asus for consumer focused products were pretty close).
Every big brand has had issues. Nothing new. Nothing will change the fact that ASUS is the best brand and one of the most leading technologies on earth. I have also the feeling that you probably asked too much funds which they refused, so you turned you against them. Typical an 'influencer' thing. Just like the SouthPark Yelpers episode 😊
Sounds like Jay isn't one of THOSE WHO DARE.  Now we can all wait for the upcoming mea culpa, the simple explanation regarding the recent confusion/mistake/misunderstanding and ASUS backtracking in the face of all this horrible press.  Gotta keep those profits coming in!
Asus used to be my go to. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.
Lucky I never bought anything ASUS in my life then.
Have been avoiding them for the past ten years, never liked them 🥲
Been saying asus has gone down the shitter the past years, for _quite some time_ .  Three monitors: one  xg32vq and _two_ replacement xg32vqr died within a year horrible flickering horrible image quality
Really hate to see Asus act like this because for a decade they've been my go to brand for motherboards. I'm currently using 3 right now but I promise my next will be a gigabyte or msi. Thankfully my b550-f and my z690-E run fine but I'm definitely not gonna get a x670 from them. Third one is my really old p6t deluxe.
So they go from top dog computer parts maker to zero? Wow. So who is the best now?
That's sad, I really liked Asus
Now I'm a bit worried. Splurged on an Asus ROG laptop about a year ago. It runs like a champ but after hearing all this I'm concerned I won't get the longevity I thought I was paying for.
Well this not good... I guess my asus extreme x670 stays with the 7950x and my 7950x3d stays on the shelf :-(
I've NEVER liked Asus.  Back...way back...in the day when Abit was still a thing, friends bought Asus, I bought Abit.  They had problems, I didn't.  Then Asus seemed to step it up and were really good for a long time.  Apparently that's not the case again.  As for ASRock, I bought ASRock Z97 PRO4 LGA 1150 ATX Intel Motherboard in 2016 and it worked fine up until this year when I replaced my wife's mobo.  It still works fine.  ASRock is a much better brand then it gets credit for.  Asus routers are great though.
As a former ASUS employee, none of this surprises me. After laying me off, they tried to push me into signing a form that said I would never say anything negative about ASUS, its current/future products, or current/future employees. If I do ever say anything negative, they assured me they would take legal action. Since I didn't sign it, I received no severance pay (they offered a paltry 3 weeks' pay if I signed), which goes against the whole "we're a family" thing that they push on you from the moment you join.  Edit: For those asking, the document was called a "Non-disparagement agreement" and while it wasn't illegal at the time, such practices have been outlawed in the US since. I would guess that they don't use this practice any longer, but they did when I was laid off last year.
Idk I feel like he just got insulted at Asus for them asking him questions about troubleshooting etc, and took it further than it needed to be. Kind of melodramatic if you ask me, they have done right by the industry for a very long time to disregard them like this over a couple of bad experiences because you feel entitled as a content creator is kind of a bit over the top. I get it,  they screwed up and aren't consistent, they are an enormous corporation. I've had nothing but the best experiences with them outside of the nitty gritty cover ups. Idk just seems silly to me.
I'm gathering information on what components to pick for my upcoming build. I've now deleted Asus from my list of potentials.
Well I guess I gotta pick a different mobo for my new build
Last good asus product I had was a m3a78 pro mobo. yes this was a very long time ago. I got the board for free from my friends dad cause he couldnt get it to work tldr he needed a beefier psu but it survived countless upgrades and modifications even a unfortunate spill this one time..
Gigabyte was gone. Now Asus. We're getting out of options. Who's left? Only MSI and EVGA? (I still bought a Gigabyte board because they were the only one having motherboard with a feature a wanted and fingers crossed its still fine.)
but it's only the 670's that is doing this? my 10 year old PC and ONLY form of entertainment and relief due to Depression,Anxiety ,and PTSD died a couple weeks ago and it's been hell
This is precisely why I switched to Asrock long ago..
Thanks for sticking up for us little guys, Jay. We overwhelmingly appreciate it.
I bought a Asus gaming notebook and the chipset got so hot it melted the plastic but getting asus to do anything was impossible. I was even willing to pay for replacement but no help whatsoever. Very sad
Thank you for taking a stand for us and keeping it real Jay! Pride comes before the fall, it won't be any different for Asus if they don't humble themselves and make this right
To be fair, I stopped supporting/recommending ASUS since 2010. I repaired a friend's ROG gaming laptop way back when, and there's a was a 5400RPM drive in there instead of a 7200. Also, given that ASUS is like an OEM to many manufacturers, spreading themselves thin, losing focus. If you want ASUS grade products when ASUS was actually good, stick with ASRock.
EVGA is behind watching all these.
Never bothered with Asus since they started with the 'asus tax' making everything they do a third more expensive then everyone else.
Well said Jay. Honesty and integrity are what we all should live by.
Because the ROG name is what the casual PC person will see, or when people buy prebuilds. Not gonna care, just push product. Plus they're focused on the new handheld. They don't care about anyone
Question: I have a ROG laptop from about 7 years ago that is at the edge of death (been using an external hard drive in place of the D: drive that went bad years ago), I was getting ready to get another ROG of the same price point, but obviously more up to date. So, at the price point of a ROG laptop (sitting around $1300 at Costco), what is a better gaming/general-use laptop alternative?  I'm not a hard core gamer who needs the latest and best. But I do still like being able to play most games made in the last few years.
so many followers... stop buying AMD and you wouldnt have any problems. Because jayz dont like ASUS, doesnt mean you should hate it,
Ya I love ASrock. Running one in my gaming rig now. Had very good experiences with their gear. I must have missed all the issues being reported about them...been running their stuff in multiple rigs for like 10 or so years now and I've never had one of their boards fail. *knock on wood*
the backwards caps was a huge thing from my perspective, that is very basic QA. Like I get that these are complex electronic devices but something that glaring should have been caught before a single board left the line and caused the whole line to stop until someone could figure out why the Pick&Place was configured wrong and fix it.
The reason why i clicked is because of aSUS
I will continue to purchase ASUS motherboards and GPUs.  I have all ASUS systems in my personal business.  I mostly buy Intel based systems.  I don't overclock or buy AMD 3D processors. If we stopped buying all brands that have issues, then no more Gigabyte gear (with their exploding PSU's), no more NZXT (H1 case fire), and on and on....
It's getting tight on reliable brands. MSI, Gigabyte and Corsair also had their BS in the past.
Well I was about to buy a asus prime board for my own, new system but I am very glad I came across this video first. No i wont buy that board instead look at other brands to mimimize the risk of getting problems and losing money. Thank you Jay for explaining this.
Their products used to be what you wanted for to tier quality.  It's sad to see them fall.
OK, Jay You can send me one of those X670 boards. I'm willing to take one for the team!
Wait! Are you talking about ASUS or ABIT? (Yes, the reference and brand are correct).
Randy Marsh gives you like for.....TEGRITY'  Overpriced crap anyway, Good Job having scruples J
Asrock has been waiting this for years. They make insane boards like Taichi yet they get shadowed so hard behind Strix series that is so much "out there"  Gigabyte is good too i guess i really dont know about the brand that much...
I know a nice white motherboard: NZXT N7 Z790 white edition
The issues you described with the usb & audio problems likely indicate a motherboard issue rathaer than a CPU issue. Could be chipset, could be electrical fault around the peripheral ports.  The CPU does not interact with audio and usb directly, and were it a software driver issue it would likely repeat across multiple cpu models.
AsRock is becoming the Champion clothing of Mobos
This is a well deserved response to their recent crap. Now I’m just hoping that there’s no future issues with their AM4 stuff, since I recently went R7 5700X and TUF B550, and reusing my ASUS RX580 Dual OC…
Putting hazardous product/software in public use is not acceptable, no matter how many greek letters you hide behind!
Simple Huge ❤
Guess I've just been lucky with Intel based Asus ROG motherboards for over 15 years and my current TUF OC 4090. Current setup is Z790 ROG Hero with a binned 13900K and zero problems for me, so sorry to hear about the issues (mainly on AMD boards?).
OK, well, time to look for a new manufacturer for my next board.
I have a Ausu mother board and i noticed that i am having issues with my xbox controller and my mouse double clicking on button presses when I press the buttons too fast. Been told that it may be a fault in the mother board. Alos ASUS monitor i bought screwed up. i sent it in and when they got it they said i had broke the screen. I told them that Fed ex handled it and it was fine when i gave it to them screen was not physically broken. They told me to basically get F ed. After yelling at them and blasting them on Twitter for a month they finally said they would fix it.  I had them send me pictures of the box, packaging, monitor, ect ect ect. When i didnt lay over and die i think they figured out that i was going to fight them tooth and nail
asus has really gone down hill
Yeah this basically solidified it for me with Asus, I feel annoyed that I have a Asus GPU at this point and just want to get rid of it.
ASUS has really had a fall from grace over the years.
Thank you for this, I'm close to purchasing new CPU+mobo and I was looking into ASUS mobos. Now I know not to go anywhere near them ever again. I live in the third world, risking a CPU being KILLED by ASUS literally means a whole sallary for me.
1k for a motherboard blows me away.
Thank you for sticking it to them in our name Jay!
If you make a video like this you need to suggest the best alternatives. I have an Asus MB which is X99 (almost 10 years old now) and was great but I'm looking to upgrade and won't be buying Asus again because of the deteriorating quality (while simultaneously vastly increasing the price) and abandoning their customers that have issues. I wonder how much of this is down to "new hires".
damn, i just cancelled my order of the rog ally
Sounds like he got paid well from companies that hate Asus.
The amount of people I’ve told to avoid asus purely just because of ROG tax is finally showing it’s truth and glad I’ve never supported it
Boycott Asus ROG Ally
Built a new AM5 Build with an Asus b650a and a 7900x. First set of ram (not qvl) would not run at 6000. Second set of ram (on qvl) still would not run at 6000. Can only get a stable 5600 on ycruncher. Anything above, BSOD. As well, I have the same issue with the usb devices disconnecting and reconnecting.  If I didn't get it in a bundle deal I would have sent it back long ago. But $100 difference at the time didn't seem worth an extra 300mhz Latest bios etc. Just a joke though, last AM4 build was an ASUS board, no issues with that. So I thought I may have been safe with AM5, guess not...
My z690e was the last build I will ever do from Asus, I already made my mind up about that when my Strix 3080 TI took a dump 4 months after building it.  I've RMA'd it twice and so far so good on the last one.  But I'm switching back to Gigabyte for my next build.
I didn't get bit by ASUS, but I did buy my first *non*-ASUS MOBO in decades.  I was upgrading from an original Threadripper to a 7950X and couldn't believe the pricing for their boards.  If the board had some kind of advantage, I don't have a problem shelling out the cheese because I make my living with my workstation, but I found the GIGABYTE X670E AORUS XTREME  was exactly what I was looking for.  Maybe I dodged a bullet.
So I'm still new to the pc gaming coming from console. I have Crosshair VIII Dark Hero what settings should I change to get at least 120fps on 4k? I'm running 5950 cpu and 3090 GPU 128GB ram but only getting  90-100fps on MW2
The only thing putting me off buying the ROG ALLY is the fact its made by ASUS. Had a horrible experience with 3 ASUS products I bought for an "Asus build" where the software would conflict with the 3 devices together. They would work fine if only 2 of them were installed, but as soon as the B550 motherboard, the ASUS AIO cooler and the Strix 5700X were installed at the same time, the software just would not work properly, and their support kept telling me to format my PC.
Well Asus ,I'im not buying your products anymore!
Strong rejection of the brand from many angles is a very good indicator that tides are turning in a big way.  Thanks for standing up for what's right Jay!
Wow. Currently upgrading from 4770k to 7800 x3d, and I was about to purchase ASUS mobo with it. Guess ill just pass. Thank you for being honest with us.
6:38 say frak. It's a good way to say what's supposed to be said without saying it. And everyone gets it.
I bought ASUS for a decade. In 2021 I bought one of their AMD Advantage Laptops and the motherboard fried. ASUS's solution was a replacement board that had the same issues. They cut corners on quality control and it shows. They lost my trust.
Respect.
Funnily enough i´d noticed the ASUS/AsRock thing a few years ago.   Had multiple Asus boards dieing over the years and not a single AsRock failing.  My X570 Prime Pro was the tip of the iceberg, when every bios update made it worse and worse.  so id switched to an Taichi never had any Bluescreen or random shutdown ever again.   The X570Prime Pro was flashed back to Version 1409 with a Clamp and works solid enough for my workshop PC so didnt scrap it. But id avoid Updates like hell and dont even care cleaning the PC anymore. if it dies, it dies.   ASUS is dead to me since 2020
You should be using Asrock. Been using 3 of them with ZERO issues
The fact that the audio jacks on the two ASUS TUF GAMING laptops that I bought back in 2020 were pretty much shot soon after I got them despite me not being frequent in removing the headphone jack (as I need it plugged in whenever I use the laptops), didn't bode well and in light of this video and can sort of see why - perhaps I got reconditioned ones. I mean, I paid dollar for these machines - I have never had this problem ever before with any other device. You would think that an headphone jack would be one of the simplest things to get right. The fact that the same problem occurred on two machines points to shoddy materials and lack of care. Seems like ASUS has got dubious leadership.
The only way to get them to pay any attention will be to complain loudly everywhere that it's possible.   Some recent issues I have had -   ASUS PG48UQ OLED screen has basically non functioning HDR on windows. No fix for this, it's been months, and it was noted in RT'ings review of the 42 inch model. ASUS hasn't acknowledged these issues either on their forum or reddit.  ROG Crosshair VIII Formula trapped my Strix 3090 so badly in the PCI-E slot because of the stock back plate that I had to snap the PCI-E lock tab off the card to remove it. When I contacted ASUS about it I was told to basically jog on, and that it isn't a problem with their designs. Despite new boards having a remote lock release. Guess they engineered a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, how nice of them.  ROG Crosshair VIII Formula 12V header literally caught fire in my case. I bought another one and asked the PC store I bought it from to credit me when ASUS gets around to the RMA. It took 3 months before they did anything. So had I not bought one myself, then I would have been without a PC for months.  I want them to do better, I don't want to shop elsewhere. They charge a premium over every other main brand and I no longer see what we are getting for that money.
Wow, I guess it takes some balls to do that ^^ .. huge respect
If you ask me their AI Suite 3 should sound something like Lawsuit-e part 3. This wannabe system control app is a f*ckin joke :D
this is why i watch your channel, consumer first. Keep it up team Jayz!
I lost a 2700x because of an X470 Strix Asus board. Over volting. False temp reporting. When i took off the pump to my H115i Platinum, my IHS was humped up and blue. Fried the chip. Managed to save my Ram and GPU. Went with an MSI X570 and. 5600x. Best setup in years. Too many years struggling with Asus Junk. Their graphics cards work great but they can keep the rest.
They were drugged!
Soo Jay when is the Gigabyte youre fired video coming up, and the other AM5 board partners? The fault is a AMD fail in the microcode supplied to boardpartners by AMD so the correct title is "I'm sorry AMD... but you're fired!"
DELETE the aura software from the market - cause has no TÜV
i regret buying my rog strix z790-i. suuuper long boot times. unstable memory and constant need to train the memory. if i had to do it again, i'd go with msi.
I'm done with Assus as well. Next generation i'm getting, it's no longer going to be Assus products.
775 board with q6600 i made it to run 3,8+ It was awesome board. Im planning to make new PC at end of the year hopelly. Not gonna have any asus as it seems to be bad now. Currently using 2016 gigabyte soc-force and im happy about it. Now its a entry price point almost :O
One thing about Asus: They used to overclock their Boards for a long time, only slightly to gain 2-5% in Tests. The Bios and their Software shows good parameters but good Software and direkt measurements show that Asus always go for the upper range of the tolerance on DEFAULT Setting. So the 1.41V instead of 1.35 comes at no suprise for me, it's literally the allowed 0.5% tolerance, Problems comes when you go at the upper limit and still have a 0.1% tolerance when a Sensor heats up, then you get a Crash. Same goes for Audiocards, they expect normal Bus Timings. They expect a PCIE Base Clock of 100mhz +- 1.5%. Asus delievers on default a Baseclock of 101.5 mhz. It improves greatly the GPU Performance, winning the Performance Crown for the ASUS Boards. But a Soundchip or USB Chip connected to this 101.5 Mhz Chip is in danger of getting Hotspots and have those Problems Jay has experienced. Other Brands do the other way around, like Asrock, they are a subsidary from the same Mother Company, but they clock at 99.5mhz. So Asus Boards are Faster and they are slower. But guess what, they are more stable. Same goes for Gigabyte, the tend to underclock ther Bus Speeds as well. Since i swapped from Asus to Gigabyte, i never had an Peripherial Error again. P5Q-Pro was my last Asus Board. I work as a Systemadministrator at Schools and have time and again Problems with Asus Boards, with components dying. Another Cheap component which don't like to be overclocked are Realtek NIC Chips. Guess how funny it is, when you have one after another Asus Board ( 2017 Models) having dying NIC when they are out of warrenty and you have a total loss, or have to buy pcie NIC Cards to keep the maschine working.
I had no Problems with asrock since 2016
Yikes. I built my asus system just a few months ago: strix x670e-e wifi, 7900x. I haven't done anything too crazy with it and it's stable, for now.
The real question is, what motherboard maker should we go with instead of Asus.  I still have time to return my motherboard and get a different brand that's hopefully better and doesn't release firmware updates that void your warranty.  I don't know of a better way to try to change this practice than sending it back to the vendor.
I have to agree with Asrock stepping up and improving over time from personal experience. Ironically, my other experience was an Asus board and I started having issues over time. The contrast between the brands is unreal.
Even going back for many years, even for new intel platforms Asus have sh!t out a poor bios for the launch and only occasionally bothered to fix the issues. Asus are only safe with Rev 2.0 motherboards
My preferences usually stands with Asus, but they’ve gone too far, in the last period. They really deserve to be abandoned…
huge respect for your honesty and for sharing the truth with us.  another proof that there are honest people and money is not everything.  another reason why we have been following you for years.  thank you
Of course I buy my first ever Asus board, and they do this shit. Not having any issues with it so far (7950x with x670e-f) 😢
Good, they've had their head up their ass for a long time now and it's starting to come around full circle.
Are you new? EVERYTHING is going to shit these days. EVERYTHING.
Got Asus sTrix B550, and i had send back two mobos, both just died random on me...  3. (this am using) random crashes with quad memory some reason, i given up going back to intel and asrock or msi boards...
I've been dealing with ASUS bullsh*t grade RMA since Crosshair VII Hero WiFi... tried a few higher end ASUS products since, all failed, none could be RMAed for no actual reason... long decided to avoid the brand.
Wow... Well now I'm less puzzled about how the frig one of my LAN controllers have died on its own. Sad but I guess the reign has ended for ASUS.
Wow.  Sat infront of my ROG keyboard, ROG mouse, Prime MB and Tuf Gaming GPU... I Feel sick...
Much respect Jay.  You putting your audience ahead of sponsorship is a rare sign of character, and speaks volumes about Asus.  I used to trust Asus quality without question until I went through *THREE* B-550 boards purchased from Amz.  I thought the first one was due to a crappy seller, the box it arrived in seemed a little sketchy.  I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't accept the bios and fortunately Amz accepted the return for a replacement.  That board starting throwing fits much like what you were experiencing with your stream, just over 2 months in, all of a sudden my sound went out and it lost sight of one of my HDDs.  Spent a week  trying to troubleshoot it before giving up and attempted a RMA with Asus.  Thought I was just unlucky, stuff happens right?  Tried to collect on my warranty via Asus'  CS.  Total shit CS, even a phone call had me cycling through long holds, drops, and the runaround.  Asked around on reddit and the sentiment was that most mobo makers have poor CS, but Asus is condemned as being the worst.    I reached out to the seller I bought it from, as the board had just gone past the Amz return policy window.  Seller was very compassionate and understanding , offering to replace it with a version that didn't have wifi (I don't normally use wifi so I didn't care) only requiring i cover all shipping costs.  That board finally functioned as intended, but it was the last Asus product I'd buy.  Up till that time, all my mobos used to be Asus, not anymore.  Sad to see, first EVGA stops making gfx cards (my heart still hurts over that) and now Asus' mobos suck.
As a long time ASUS fanboy I guess I'm finding a new brand, yeeesh.
I cannot lie--this was a difficult watch, but I had to.  As a huge Asus fanboy for as long as they've been an option, I watched Steve's recent video with a large grain of salt. After all, every company makes mistakes; it is how they resolve those issues that truly builds customer loyalty. I did not want to believe that -my- Asus would dip so low, but I watched the video in its entirety because we cannot cling so tenaciously to brand loyalty. I already swore off NZXT because of their "flamethrower" PCIe riser cable debacle. On the other hand, Fractal earned my respect even more by handling their recent issue with transparence and an eye for what the /customer needs/.  I watched this video hoping that there was new information, that perhaps the issue wasn't as bad as I feared. Turns out, no--judging from both your video itself and the comments section, Asus has fully and completely jumped the shark. I don't want to give up Asus. They've been my go-to not just for all my own builds, but as a high-praise recommendation to anyone that asked. No longer. It is clear that Asus has gotten so self-absorbed that they've lost perspective of who they work for--their customers. Until they more than reverse this current customer service failure, they won't get another dime from me or anyone I consult for new builds.  Shame on you, Asus. You were the sight-unseen, default choice, at least for me. Was the greed worth it?
when you attempt to transform the consumer into your QA . . .
Mad props to you for calling out Aorus on their problem solving, customer support and care!! 🙇🏽‍♂️
I'm really sad to hear this I have had asus motherboards for the last 9 years.
So ungrateful, money has gone to your head!
I’ve ordered multiple ASUS items from Amazon, and when they’ve gone faulty ASUS didn’t want to know about it, even when it came down to consumer law. Luckily Amazon are decent with returns and refunds so Amazon have took the hit. I’m much more hesitant to buy from ASUS anymore.
I bet you could draw a line back to the implementation of an EDI department. They hired a bunch of unqualified kool-aid hair people who sit around all day posting on reddit about how capitalism sucks.
Lol glad I’m not upgrading again for some years…
It’s inflation time. They are cutting costs. Everybody is.
Yay! I gave up on ASUS on z370 and persistent OC and overvoltage the default and auto settings did on my 8700k. Support did exactly what Jay says, complacent and arrogant "we'll have you tried this... no? Well good luck and fk off"  Went with gigabyte z690, fact that Asus owns 49% does make me a bit nervous... but auto all, load XMP and I'm above average in every bench with decent temps. Didn't even have to install the ILM from Thermalright.  Funny thing is, I gave it to a friend that has an Asus Maximus... Guess he'll need it more than I do 😮
I appreciate the honest review.  I was a big ASUS fan myself Maybe it's time for a best brand showdown?
It takes a huge amount of integrity to make a decision like this and it should be happening more. As companies get worse and worse, treat customers with utter contempt and try to be "business as usual" (Nvidia for example), it needs people like this to stand up to them and say "enough".
No mention of Armory Crate? It's more or less malware at this point.
10/10 jay, now time to have a look at lian li and their fans.........
My free stuff isn't mint! (RAGE QUIT)
Great infor what do recommend for motherboards ,7900 Ryzen cpu, for ddr5 6400 mem. Mainly used for Heavy 4k gaming and light word processing too write my mom.
Long time ago i had an Asus ROG mobo. Indeed beautiful with an external little neat display. Downloading drivers was a disaster. Never had that problem with other brands ... so ...
Oh boy I had no clue all this was going on with Asus and I just bought a b550-f rog strix mobo with r9-5900x should I be concerned with that board now?
This is why i like Jayz & Co.
The most difficult part for me about all this is the extreme disconnect there seems to be between ASUS desktop stuff and their laptops. My wife and I have both used only ASUS laptops for years and have no complaints.  Maybe somebody from the laptop division needs to manage the desktop side of things for a while.
How much did Intel pay asus to brick amd chips?
I wish I had know. Ordered parts for a new build aprox 10 days ago. Arrived today. Mobo ASUS ROG STRIX B660-F. Guess what mobo is so broken it won’t even post. Tried everything. All parts work fine on another mobo. Returning this garbage and returning to MSI. This will be the last time I go for Asus. Kudos for giving them the boot!
Man, i wish this video was 2 months earlier bc i just finished a mostly Asus build. Running fine for now🤞but ill def come back and comment if i start getting ussues.
Love Gigabyte, Asrock and MSI! Always when used ASUS board there was problems, less performance (dont know why, fastest boards are from Asrock, MSI and Gigabyte, use cheapest ones - less functions = more performance) ❤
The Xonar U5 external sound card has a problem with windows 10 and 11 where the Sonic Studio software is completely useless. Nothing you change in the configuration does anything. I tried customer support several times, there are tons of people in forums with the same problem, they are 100% aware of the problem and every time anyone contacts support they act exactly the same, as if the problem is something new they never heard about. Why am I not surprised at all with this video now?
I feel like for as long as I've been in this space, ASUS has been overpriced for the quality they give you.
mod the asrock man
It never ceases to amaze me how many companies who become successful and build a brand by having good products seem to forget, in their own arrogance, that the brand and image is an extension of the product, not marketing. Cut corners on your product development, and your brand will eventually suffer no matter how many marketing, public relations, and lawyer type peoples you throw at the problem. It is very disappointing to see Asus fall into this trap. I've been buying their motherboards for years, but no longer. I won't be giving my money to a company that feels entitled to my wallet solely by virtue of their label.
Was wondering whether or not Asus was still trustworthy, but seeing content like this will help save me a couple grand, so thanks.
hey msi, asrock, watch this! you could be the next to be fired by oncle jay.
Knowing their track record, I won't even consider buying an ROG Ally
I use MSI mainboards - BUT my K9N Platinum had seriously leaking capacitors. Sigh.
I had to exchange my Asus TUF Gaming Z690. It just died and I didn’t tinker with the bios and I don’t overclock my hardware. Luckily I have a stable one now, but I’ll rethink my next hardware purchases in the future. Thanks Jay.
It's going to affect my purchase decisions from here on out, even though, as Jay said that there's basically no manufacturer without it's problems...but I used to see ASUS as top quality trusted and top-tier mobo manufacturer, but also often overpriced, so I haven't bought from them in my last couple of builds.  Will be carefully picking based on price and rating, but avoiding ASUS more now.
I lovvvvvve my 13900 on my gigabyte z790 UD. Built a 13700 on a z790 asrock board for a friend and it’s working flawlessly. So sad about ASUS, they used to be the go-to…  Also asrock has that sonic the hedgehog board, that’s pretty effin cool 😂
send me your ASUS GPUS!!!  and it's pronouced, "Jesus"  Gosh!
So funny watching Jay attempt to ride Stephen Burke consumer protection coat-tails when Jay was caught red-handed shilling for EVGA not too long ago. To hell with EVGA and Asus both. And Jay for that matter
asus is not the only one to follow that trend to making fun of its consumer. motherboards are particularly fragiles nowadays, while capacitors can easily lasts 10 years. i always trust gibabyte durable series, for what is worth.
I had an amazing experience with my 10 year old Asus board. I fired it and they replaced it over Christmas no questions asked.   I got Asus in my new 5800x system because of it and have had zero issues. However it looks like I'll be going elsewhere when I upgrade my home server.
Jay the real one. just sucks my like whole build is asus... lol
lets see how der8auer aka Asusboy reacts xD
I have an asus motherboard and i7 12700f , which should draw max 65 W but i tested and it draws sometimes 75W and I didnt do any overclock. I will never buy any Asus product.
I recently built a system with the Strix X670E-E with the 7800X3D and things seem stable with my system currently; but now I'm wondering if I should ditch this board and grab the MSI MPG before something bad happens
Its only the second time this happen in the history of this channel, but thats 2 times too much
Is it different in US, because where i live (northern europe) ASUS have said that their warranty does cover this regardless of what the beta bios says. The beta claim isn't valid here.
yeah having bios upgrades void warrenty when the actual bios upgrade would be the cause for failing hardware is very nasty of Asus.
I've been a fan of Jayz for years but never subscribed because its not something I usually do; this made me do it. Kudos for having a spine!
I have same board and same issues. I also had a blue screen today and device issues
I use to have all kinds of ASUS hardware and it was always my go to brand but after a couple defective monitors, RGB fans with extremely short lives and a very, very expensive keyboard craping out within a year, I'm down to my ASUS X570-E mobo which luckily has been okay but all my other hardware is from different manufactures now. But yeah Jay much respect for doing this. I've moved away from supporting this company and their terrible customer service entirely.
Kudos to you all sticking up for the consumers...   I bought an Asus strix 3080TI LC last year and within a month the pump started making an extremely loud noise. I went through literally 4 months rma process 3 different returns because they kept sending me the same gpu with a new serial number slapped on it. It was making the same exact noise tho... Each time the box it came in was de.olished but the shipping box didn't even have a scratch. Each time they sent me back the GPU it had MORE scratches damages and leak marks from the radiator all over it that wasn't on it before.   50+ emails and calls and 3 escalations later they finally sent me a new GPU because I put a deposit down for an advanced replacement. I swear to God they actually tried CHARGING me the full amount of the advance because when they got the rma card back the serial numbers didn't match.. one more escalation and a few threats to sue they gave me my money back...  Never again will I buy another Asus product
I really don't understand the surprise. Asus's motherboard business was always shady. Even in the K7 era. And they have the tendancy to retroactivly modify specifications without notice. And their support was always terrible. I decided not to buy a thing from them 16 years ago. My last Asus hardware was a V3400TNT SGRAM Pure. And that had a ton of problems as well.
Well, recently I bought Asus Tuf b550 mobo from outlet. It wasn't able to detect my graphics card on any of the pcie port but I send it on warranty and they fixed it. Took them over 3 weeks but everything is fine now.
I only had an ASUS board once in my life, and I sold it before I built the PC... those were still the days of Athlon64 ....Over the years I have tried many boards from MSI, Epox, DFI, Gigabyte and the problem was only with Gigabyte for a while, now I have a second board from ASRock and no problem... I avoid Asus and it is said to be good
ASUSulutly garbage
I had a z390 Asrock for 3 years granted I never oc the cpu but I never had a problem with it. (2019-2022) I only sold it to get a 12 gen cpu and board.
Am so dissapointed with Asus. I bought an X670E-E mobo, premium price NOT premium performance. I've been an EVGA mobo person, but thought I try the Asus brand, what a frequen mistake. And your right Jay, is not about having problems with produts GOD knows that what we troubleshoot, but Asus support is competing with Corsair for the worse support ever. So dissapointed. I would trash this new Asus mobo but a $525.00 purchase is tought to do discard after 6 weeks, but I sure want to. So disgusted with Asus right now.  Call support, they said someone will call be back in a couple of days. I think they may have meant months . . . am disgusted!
All my MB from x38 till now is ASUS. And now this. Crapsus
I have a 5950 on an Asus X570 board and have been suspecting Asus is overvolting those boards as well (5xxx were on a previous node so i'm suspecting it might handle the abuse for much longer) .  Default settings can send well over 200 watts to the CPU.
Bravo
I've had nothing but bad luck with asus boards the last few years.
Sooo that's a thing.. I'll switch MSI/Gigabyte for my next mobo at least
I really appreciate that you are talking about this and made this step back from ASUS. This is not the first time when ASUS does not care about anything but their profit.
any brand that asks you to request a freedom of infomation act is a HUGE RED flag for me.
2018年組了華碩的顯卡+主機板    然後 就已決定終身不再碰任何的華碩產品
I think we are in an era in IT where we are seeing the lifecycles from unbeareable promises and everyone super-hyped, to a tremendous decay in the mid-term.   This is terribly hurting the industry in the long-term, delaying the final results of products, as the industry is running in circles.
When Jay end a video by saying "You are officially fired from this channel....but you don't care", you know what he really means is "You're fired....F*** off!"  This just makes me feel validated that I went with EVGA for my current X570 motherboard.   I have had ZERO issues with ANYTHING related to EVGA.  Support is always top notch, the one RMA issue I had went flawlessly, and they even included parts I bought over a decade ago that I no longer have receipts for on my official EVGA purchase history because I knew the exact model number of them.  I do feel about MSI what Jay feels for ASUS right now.  I had an MSI motherboard fail completely after a BIOS update that they themselves pushed out...they blamed me even though I did nothing but follow the directions they themselves published.  Then when my MSI 970 GTX died less than a week before the warranty ended, they flat out ignored me until AFTER the warranty expired and then tried to tell me "so sorry, warranty period is over.  Buy a new card" during the peak of the GPU shortage when a 3070 would cost someone over $1100!    Then when I blasted them on social media...THEN they stepped up to the plate and tried to remedy it.   Sorry....MSI lost my business for life because of this!
Thank god I rarely had any asus products, though I know they used to be top tier. I'll stick with MSI for now...
too bad they're the only gamers smartphone brand available on the market.
Will you be covering the MSI code leak? Gigabyte isn't an option because of their customer service being nonexistent, and now ASUS is out. What's left that's actually good and has good support?
Who was the first embargod sponsor? Gigabyte?
Man. Here and I just built a system with an ASUS X670E-E and a 7950X. I haven't seen any problems, but I'm starting to get really worried.
I'm still buying ASUS, this warranty voiding beta BIOS thing don't bother me because I READ before installation.  Come on man, it's a work in progress, have some patience dude, you'll be fine without overclocking for a few more days.   This over-reacting show Youtubers put on here is getting ridiculous, to topple Jay's video someone will have to run over a $600 Asus motherboards with a road roller?  LOL
is that video sponsored by asus? just kidding.
we all have to take things as we see them . & personally asus saying ( & I'm paraphrasing here)  "its your own fault for listening to us " is a real shity thing to do not to mention sending damaged products for review is more than enough reason to say " no thanks I'll get my stuff from somewhere else . well done to both Jay & Steve for speaking out & not brushing this under the proverbial carpet as it appears Asus have tried to do
Had this thing with my pc not wanting to wake out of sleep mode, turns out that my (then) high end Asus motherbord shit the bed and a 50 dollar board does the same thing better, only thing is that i have way less IO
I have a ASUS G14 and I feel the same way. It looks great, but it crashes all the time. I was starting to think that a quality laptop doesn't exist but no, it's just ASUS that sucks.
I wonder how the QC will be for the Asus ROG Ally...
I've trusted ASUS for decades and have deployed thousands of rigs over the years but that's done. I'm just an average Joe, nothing special but that trust is gone and my business with it. I cannot have even one single computer fail in the field due to a board failure or eat RAM alive like my b450-i does.
Appreciate the vid.  I bought the ASUS ROG Strix Z690-A Gaming WiFi D4 around November '22.  Coming from a different MB, I liked the AI overclocking.  Eventually i was seeing 5900 - 6000MHz.  All was good for at least a month.  Then it happened, I couldn't load Fortnite, frequent blue screens, other apps not working, typically on restart after blue screen the audio wouldn't work.  It took a lot of troubleshooting to find out that I can no longer run a stable system with Asus AI Overclocking.  Thanks to Intels XTU I can, not as aggressive...
Thank you for making this video. I have a laptop I just sent them to repair, after I shut it down and never restarted. They wanted the same amount of money to replace the motherboard as buying a new laptop. Now I'm out a PC because I don't have the money to replace or repair. They wouldn't offer anything like a discount on new hardware or anything. Pretty crappy after I bought it less than 2 years ago. Never buying ASUS again.
I am new to PC gaming and I rely on channels like yours and Gamers Nexus for your opinions. You guys have been doing this much longer than myself and your knowledge is more than mine. I can't express how much I respect, appreciate and value you and other channels standing up to these corporations by telling it how it is. High five to Phil and Jay for supporting the greater good!
Thank you im about to build my new pc tomorrow!!! Hearing this will make everyone avoid Asus products!!! Ive had issues with asus products before like my asus 27inch monitor that only lasts 1 year! Exactly the time the warranty ends, my gaming laptop that tge keyboard just died after few months of using. I thought that im just unlucky but hearing this from an influencer it will really help the community!!!
a few years ago i got a asus ryujin 360 for my 3950x and it worked great for the first month. til the lcd screen burnt out before the first 30 days which was alot of the reason i got it cause at the time it was one of the only aios to have a live readout on it. took weeks to get ahold of asus for a replacement just to get the response of "if the aio itself still works the lcd screen is not a concern of ours" an almost 300$ aio at the time i havent bought asus since. i do have a x570 crosshair formula im using on my current build but when i build a new one im most certainly going with a different company.
What is this about FOIA request?  I thought they were only for US government.
ASUS has been going down hill for years Greed, greed and more greed Garbage customer service, garbage drivers, rootkits in their motherboards to install their armory crate software on fresh Windows launches
Boy am I glad I got an MSI board 😅
Asus be taking L’s after L’s and there are the ones handing them out! 😂
I guess im lucky so far with my Asus am5 board and 4080, Next build i will avoid Asus.
Maaan i built new pc after 8 years. 8 years of MSI with no problem. Now i have ASSuS and so much issues that i start thinking of changing mobo with gpu. Well at least mobo. Not to mention their sh.tty ass Armoury BS Crate. Oh man also i recently refunded their 43 inch ROG monitor cuz i had random blackscreens and i figured out by my self it was not my PC, nor 3rd party hdmi ver 2.1 but THEIR monitor yet they still tried some shady stuff on me.
We need more public figures and "influencers" to act like this. Companies would be scared straight, if this was the publicity they all got, all over the web. Keep it up, and kudos!
i love when you're trying to stay calm, thnks for taking care of us jay ♥
Gigabyte also that bad i think..😊
It’s crazy, I’ve always used gigabyte boards, but went x470 Asrock, now running x670e steel legend. And honestly that’s crazy that I see asus how I used to view asrock
Respect. F*ck you Asus.
I put the Asus X670E Creator board in my wife's PC with 7950X quite some time back .... glad she doesn't do the ish that i do and still fingers crossed this gets figuered out ASAP. I do NOT want to buy a second stupid expensive board because of their neglectfulness.
Last time Asus/ROG was serious about their products Rampage series were leading the mobo industry
MSI. White, yes. Secure plattform? Think not.  My cynical view is that you cannot trust anyone of the big manufuckturers. So … where to next?
im not a pc gamer but i was mobile i had asus ROG phone 2 and that phone frustrated me then anything else it had so many problems initially that phone was great camera and everything was top notch but soon when rog phone 3 was near to launch then out of nowhere  few updates made battery worst and keep in mind that phone had 6000mah battery and it didnt even last for 3 hours then another update made the phone super hot and after that charging put would get hot so much that i could burn my finger and the phone also warned me furtunelty that phone had 2 usb ports for charging so i used another one so i emailed asus so many times they didnt helped me at all.. i had to sell that pieace of shit and swore to never buy asus product again terrible product and even worst customer service.. and i had asus laptop after few years they dont support old tech via software
Thanks for this info Jay,  MSI screwed me on my x570 win11 bios and bricked my motherboad YEAH MSI.......YOU FIRED ALSO..!!!! Looking for a new AM4 motherboard, what you all recommend ? gigabyte < ?
I have exactly same issue (as presented at the end of video) with Maximus Z690 Extreme. Asus did nothing to help or resolve it since the release date.
I agree with this, but want too add after building Intel for 20 years my first few amd builds ever have been God awful with stability compared to Intel experiences in the past.   My next build will not be AMD.  They have too many issues with their memory controllers
I still have no idea about building pc's and mostly lean on my friends that are into it much more than I am. They've been saying a lot of stuff regarding this channel and i can see why youre so popular. Kudos to you and im glad im subscribed
ASS-us.
As someone who recently upgraded to 12th Gen Intel, (not 7000 series, I'm aware) I'm really glad I picked up an MSI board, even if it was only because that's what was in stock at best buy. Always had ROG boards, and even the ROG Phone currently. But ASUS' lack of support here is enough to change my mind on brand loyalty to them. MSI seems to be doing better and better quality wise from what I've seen lately. Just wish I could get rid of the dragon logo 😂
My Asus x570 ProArt has issues. Should have stuck with Gigabyte.
This is something Linus would never do. He'd never stop cashing those checks. Good on you Jay.
Wonder if Asus will have any response to this and a response to Steve.
Its really sad coz ive been building a full AMD ROG build (im poor so my ROG stuff im buying is like 6 years old) and the things so stable and my pops has an equivalent gigabyte nvidia build that is currently dead and got used less than mine does 😔
Asus sucks.  I've been saying this for years.  Until they improve their customer service and RMA process I won't buy their stuff anymore.  I hope they get buried by you guys and others.
Wow, it must have taken allot for you to fire ASUS, but thank you for letting us know. I'm going to stay away from this brand too until they smarten up which could take years. Bankruptcy anyone? I've also fired Gigabyte myself for bad customer service.
My two last Asus mobo had to be returned twice each, so I was done with Asus mobo a while ago.  Now I gave a chance to MSI and no problems at all for 2 years now.  Hopefully it will be as good in the futur. I know that MSI is far from perfect but my 3 products from them are just working with no problems. P.S. I do not overclock nothing so maybe that is why I have no problems.
I don't think I'll ever buy an Asus motherboard again with all the problems I have been having with mine
Up until crica 2005 Asus was like the Nokia of computers. I remember my friends droping, leaking water, you name it on they laptops and they would just keep running. From there on it was still good enough, but i also leaned away from them...
Im glad that i wasn't the only one that also had a problem with ASUS. ive bought a mobo from Newegg (peak pandemic). built my own PC and it wasn't working properly because of bent pins, had to go back and forth with Newegg and ASUS, about it. ive sent it back for them to fix it and voided my warranty because of a tiny scratch that i didn't even notice and wanted 175 to fix it. i took my 175 and switch to MSI and dont regret it. Even after 3 years they are still doing this and its sad
you know before watching the video i was fully ready to comment about how its easy to write off using a company when you get shipped new products for "free" (not free cause you promote for them) but after watching the video ill say that i truly hope that this video, in combination with steves, forces change.
LISTEN PLEASE.   I'm new to gaming Since DEC 2022.  I'm running a  Dell 7020  (case swap) with I5-4590  26Gb of Ram . Running a MSI GTX 1660 SUPER VENTUS XS OC.  430 watt Thermal Take  and  Adata SU760 SSD, PNY SSD, Micron SSD.     Also Your cheap suggestion RGB FANS,  6x    with windows 10 and overclocked with MSI afterburner.    ANYWAYS.    POINT IS.  I lose sound gaming and get the crackles and the screen flashes.  all drivers are updated.   MY point is this has all started with the latest WINDOWS UPDATES last two and the LATEST NIVIDIA DRIVER UPDATES from GEOFORCE EXPERIENCE.   my point is ?  sound loss, crackles, can it be windows and  NVidia?   I play fortnight, PUBG, WOW,  BeamNG, CS-GO, Rocket league, Crossout,  COD season three, and Destiny 2.   So Im experiencing the same things, same games, old ass equipment.  The difference has been  windows updates and Nvidia Updates when these began in the last month or so.  Only change was more system memory.   So  Hillbillly_Carl  says  are you sure? about the boards?  I would dump a  company based on the  drama, and damaged boards alone, the bios is beyond disgusting and worthy of dumping, but not sure about your cracking and sound loss being ASUS.
17 minutes of bitching, nice job dude
I run almost exclusively MSI products now except i have a gigabyte GPU..havent run anything Asus since z170 I did recently end up with a ROG laptop that I have yet to have any issues with but we'll see
This year we have witnessed two of the major players dying. First EVGA and now ASUS.
This is impressive and I think everyone will appreciate that you are taking this stance in a very public and transparent manner.   It does lead to two questions,  1) (I do realise you did start to answer this a the very end of the video), which was how does ASUS win you back?   2) Who replaces them at the top of the list?    - for motherboards?    - for GPUs?
This is mess is just sad I'm in no way a brand fan boi but ASUS was always my go " it will just work, and I will get what I pay for even if its more" that is just not the case anymore the disaster I have been dealing with ASUS and my dead 6-month-old pg48uq  a month after it died I still don't have a replacement " they cant find a unit in the warehouse " was enough to make me look elsewhere for future builds. Their loss guess I'm giving MSI another chance.
I've dropped ASUS parts since AM3 came out, and I've been very happy.
big mistake, but respect
Was thinking about buying AsRock because their boards are rated pretty high on most retail sites by customers.  Asus though for boards.  Omg 😲 almost all toward the bottom.
Hopefully others follow suit, even smaller channels. A large scale boycott will put them in their place. I was looking at a ROG board for my next build and after all the issues i was on the fence, but seeing you and steves video has cemented it for me.. I wont be touching an ROG board, and IN FACT, i wont be touching any ASUS products. And im sure im not alone
I am sh^tting myself after this build as I too have the Hero board and 7950x3d Im just waiting for it to go pop 😪 How long do you give it before you say my system is safe ?
Using MSI boards after the hack... DON'T UPDATE THE BIOS! lol
Asus is going to go belly up if they don't get their s--- together. WTF Asus
I recently built a custom machine for a client, and he’s using the crosshair 9 hero, I think we are gonna have to return it for an Aorus board instead.
Please tell me you've a hint of getting them their punishment, for ex a class lawsuit, whatever. I don't care what it'll be as long as they get some punishment as proof to them that you're seriously pissed at them.
Whining about stuff he gets for free.
To be fair ASRock improving isn't really a suprise, I stopped using Asus products (baring a monitor in 2010) in 2009 when my second board of theirs blew up, went to MSI and been using them since (used gigabyte in a few client builds and they have been rock solid also for the most part) with that said when I was working for a small OEM back in 2001/2002 (when MSI used their full name on thier boards (Microstar International)) if I got a unit in for diagnostics that had a microstar board I would always focus testing on the southbridge chipset because 7 times out of 10 that was the fault.  Now days I never really have issues with MSI (Some scummy behaviour to influencers aside).  Could well be ASRock has pulled a MSI and is now a brand to watch.
Here I am building a 13900k all ASUS ROG parts Hyperion, Z790 extreme, Thor 1200, 4090 OC etc. 😥😥😥 I saved 2 years for this build.  I'm a bit nervous. I'm replacing an ASROCK BUILD with all kinds of problems. 😭😭😭
I was about to buy a new system (13700k). I planned for an Asus tuf board... However after seeing this video and the videos Steve published about the dodgy Asus policy. I am stepping away from the Asus board in my new build. Any suggestions for a good mobo brand? A black board would be nice, I plan to build an all black system.
That doesn't bode well for Asus ROG Ally.
Not defending Asus but nice “timing” on Jay to release this video when everyone else is releasing Ally reviews. Timed for more exposure for better or worse.
Would explain why Linus' remark about the new rog ally steamdeck competitor about buttons getting stuck wasn't fixed in the final release....
Man, I'm still running an ASUS board from 2010 on 1st gen i7. How the tables turned
Its a pity when companies fall in the arrogant category due to their i want money and dont give a shut about consumers. I believe like a fan you are of gaming in Wg World of Warships you should do a saem topic on that comapny too. They let rigging in ther game, they use loot crating to make lottery money and thye dont give a shut about their gaming community opinions. Its a good effort you made with this video. Thank you that you did concern. keep it up.
Wonderful to see that you have the integrity to be able to say these words. Respect. ps. challenge for Jay, manage to not say the phrases "It's neither here or there" or "but I digress" :D If you manage i'll give you a personalized tour of Gothenburg if you would ever find yourself in this part of the world ;) beverage of choice included..
Great video Jay. I have the x670e-e and the 7700x and had a lot of problems. Went with another brand after RMA and had no problems. ASUS will not be my go-to brand going forward. Have to look for a substitute… EDIT: After official BIOS verson 1416 for my Asus X670e-e i lost all my front IO. Lovley!  Had to revert to 1303.
Wow... When I built my new 13th Gen system a few weeks ago I was humming and hawing over motherboards. My go to for DECADES has been ASUS but the prices of Z790s was insane and I was having a hard time finding stock on one of the lower priced ones I wanted.  I ended up going with the ASRock Lightning because the price was so much better for a Z790.  So funny, yes, back in the day ASRock was the brand you stay away from unless you really couldn't afford others.  Now I'm loving this board, it's so funny that Jay talks about the same thing in this video.
I have a question, who is Steve? Should we know who that is?
Gigabyte AORUS boards for the win
Whoa, what? I've always bought ASRock and Gigabyte, it was never a brand I avoided. I have a few ASRock Rack server boards with the Xeon D154x SOC and X470/X570 boards that have been flawless in my labs. The source of my problems were Supermicro ITX server boards or their consumer line-up, that's my avoid at all costs.
So as someone who's basically got all ASUS products in his PC (and just pre-ordered the Asus Ally handheld :| ) what brand do people recommend going forward?
I almost went asus on my recent build.  I stuck with MSI instead.  Seems like they all a little discombobulated to an extent.
I am having RAM stability issues with my AM5 setup using the Crosshair X670E as well. In the past, I tried to RMA an ASUS monitor for a capacitor issue, they sent it back without attempting to fix it. The problem persisted. After this, I will gladly take my money elsewhere.
Sooooo I’m currently here with a crosshair hero mb and 7800x3d. What motherboard should i go with now?
Thanks for the heads up Jay. I support your decision. Can’t have these super profitable companies selling us trash and then wiping their hands clean. That’s a no brainer!
I've been watching for a long time; THIS is why you've always been my favourite tech Youtuber (sorry Linus). You put your viewers first and you care more about being a decent human than earning a few dollars pedaling crap. Huge props Jay, never change my friend.
Tell them to nuke that garbage Asus armory crate program, cant believe i have to install that bloatware just to change my rgb on 7900xtx.......
This sucks. Vouched for them for a while. Will be avoiding them now and not recommending them as well. Shit is just embarrassingly dumb.
Sounds like ASUS has been taken over by Apple..
Glad I stayed away from Asus when I built my pc
No Evga no Asus is very alarming to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-( Both are my fav brands
Now if we can get reporting and honesty like this on all subjects from all media outlets, we could finally move forward as a human civilization
Once again leeching of someone else's research
My experience with Gigabyte with RMA has been terrible and my 3080 TI lighting / LCD have never worked correctly.  ASUS has shown it is no better, EVGA is no longer doing NVIDIA video cards... what is left?  Who can be trusted with my hard earned money?🤬
As an x570 TUF user, I'm worried lmao. I've had good luck with this build, has made it with zero issues since building in Feb 2020. Hoping it stays that way
I Have an expensive ROG MAXIMUS Z790 EXTREME for my I7 13900ks and keeps crashing like crazy on windows they update the bios for faster memory and since then my Gskill DDR5 7800 keeps gettting errors like crazy
I had an asus board arrive a year back dead on arrival, I went to micro center to get it replaced and that one too was also dead on arrival. it took a third one for it to work, and I'm just waiting the day it ends up dying.
Big step to cut a sponsor. Kudos.  Even if said sponsor hasn't been paying you for a while, still...
I feel so bad about my ASUS PRIME X670 Motherboard now. I dont even trust their updates xd
Asus was never on my good list. Its always been on my naughty list along with MSI. I still love Gigabyte for now and may turn to Foxconn and other board companies in the future. Shall see who steps up. These things happen.
This level of transparency and honesty is the reason why I watch you Jay. I truly appreciate it, thanks.
rock on Jay. I have a TUF x570 and it has been fine. at this point I am sooo glad I am skipping the 7XXX gen lol.
If ASUS and Logitech had a baby... what would it be?
I can’t believe this beta bios shit is somehow legal. This is literal fraud
Bye bye Asus, next build will be with anything but your hardware
it feels like they didnt update anyhting in the BIOs thing and just gave you something to download to justify them adding the void warranty warning
"I just watched a video on Mental Outlaw talking about how MSI just had their UEFI security keys got hacked."
Really a shame. I used to love ASUS. My old ZenBook was great. I've used their GPUs almost exclusively. I always equated their motherboards to the quality option. I'm swearing them off too at this point.
Big Applause from me,i have stop buyin asus stuff about 7 years ago,because i think they have "used" her name to sell stuff thats not working fine,and ive i have trouble with this stuff,IAM ALONE,like nvidia... NOT ONE SINGLE CENT ANYMORE,AN THAT IAM DOING  FOR 6 YEARS,VERY EFFICIENT🤗 with GIGABYTE , and AMD(for graphics) they want my money?then,give me the stuff you are preying for,and they dont....
ASUS motherboard will always be A SUS motherboard.
Stopped buying Asus products in 2018 after having 2 of their laptops, off the shelf new, failed for the exact same reason within 2 weeks of purchase.
Asus is in effect is now loading the responsibly to the owner what the hell "get bleep"  What Asus is say by doing this you do not want to have my cash  Now I be looking to return my motherboard if I was in this hole So well done Jay.  As a normal person who is just a little tech savvy how did I learn not to make costly mistakes by watching and learning using YouTube
TBH Stopped using Asus boards after core 2 duo. Their boards SUX moved to MSI and never looked back, think MSi was called something else back then
After dealing with ASUS' RMA customer support 15+ years ago, I have written them off as a company I'll purchase ANYTHING from. Literally anything.
holy crap they sent me one with the pins bent in the same spot.    and now I am screwed because I get blamed when  it came like that.
I have a lot of ASUS ROG STRIX in my current setup so I'm hoping this is enough of a shock to get them back into shape. I respect your decisions to remove them from your channel, but hopefully other channels will continue to investigate over the next couple of years and see if they improve
Come back ABIT we miss you!
Pretty funny that AsRock is mentioned. Back when I had a i7-4770k I got a AsRock Z97 motherboard and a lot of internet talk was that AsRock weren't a great MoBo manufacturer. But for me it was within budget so I went with it. That board kept me going till 2018 without any hassle before I upgraded, gave it to my dad and to this day is still glitch-free and fully functional. I had every intention on going AsRock for AM4 and it was great to see nowhere near the amounts of disapproval online for AsRock boards as before so much so that for friends PC builds I recommend their boards and all have a good feature set and are so far proving just as durable.  I bought 1 board close to a decade ago and as a result of it being a good product they got 2 direct sales from me and 4 indirect. That is how you build a brand
GG
Hmm only you and GN talking about this, why is everyone else quite?
Same thing MSI did to themselves
ASUS pulled a Bud light,
Well... I'm switching too.
my asus mobo purchase feels.... bad... feeling bad, and feelin had.
I never had any problems with asus. Still have 0 problems with asus. Then again I dont use AMD crap 😂😂.  So im still gonna buy asus stuff. Good vid tho.
I first bought a Asus motherboard 11 years ago, it was there Tuff model caught on fire first boot up. I sent the board back paid $16 dollars to ship it back, for them to send me a used pos that the audio was broken. Never bought their products again.
Wait a second. I literally just replaced my Asus motherboard because my wifi and Bluetooth adapters just shorted. Unfortunately I did replace it with another Asus mobo... Hopefully it won't break in a similar fashion 😅
I bought a Asus Prime X570 3 years a go. It took almost 2 years to get an update to make it stable. Don't get me wrong, I was happy to get it stable. But in the mean time I lost all confidence in Asus. I would not buy it again.
@13.55 - in guitar brand terms... Epiphone outclasses Gibson but yeah, I understand your pain... Vent over to Gigabyte and never looked back...
I bought many Asus products for my builds and never had issues but I am not going to spend another dime on this trash company who screws over the consumers.
Asus has been fired, 10 years ago. Literally foxconn is more reliable and less shady.
Making a box is much easier than waiting software
I always used to have the impression that ASUS was more or less a gold standard when it came to motherboards years ago. However, the last several boards I have gotten have all had various issues. Even boards I ended up exchanging or RMA'ing, their replacements would still have USB controller issues, stability issues, etc. In particular, the B350 and x470 ASUS boards in my personal experience and admittedly small sample size have been nothing but problems.   I am willing to put up with a certain level of QC issues (which seemingly have gotten worse in recent years with ASUS), but as Jay mentioned... it comes down to how the manufacturer handles issues and takes care of their customers. If they would have just come clean and put out a notice that a big problem existed with these x670 boards, and laid out a plan to fix the problem and make sure the customer is taken care of.... this would be a much, much, much smaller deal.   This really seals the deal for me. I think I'm finally making the permanent switch to exclusively EVGA mobos, even if that means switching back to intel. EVGA seems to be the only manufacturer with integrity left.
Damn I’m glad my B550 F hasn’t given me issues
i had a Asus x570 ROG Crosshair 8 Hero die from a bios update. Even though it was still well under warranty they didn't want to replace it. I had to contact the BBB to get them to do so and when Asus did they sent me a x570 covered in GLUE! I dont know why they thought that was acceptable but i when i contacted Asus they pretty much said it was fine and RMA process was finished. I had to contact BBB again just to get them to send me a refurbished board not covered in glue. whole process took about 3 months, by then i switched to a EVGA x570 and have had 0 issues. (when i got the glue covered board asus asked me if it worked and i told them there is no way im trusting my PC components to this glue smeared board. It was all over capacitors and key areas and for all i know its a fire hazard. they refused to replace it till i tested it so i just contacted the Better Business Bureau again)
Luckily my bad experience with Asus didn't hit too bad in the wallet. I bought the Asus AP201 case, and the power cable that came with it I believe fried a power supply. When going to replace the cable it was like pulling teeth, Asus told me too bad sorry and offered no solution. They suck.
You are a legend calling them out like this. Way to many Youtubers would just let them get away with it. We as consumers should use our power to show companies like this that the best way is the honest way. That is how you make steady profit in the long run. Companies trying to scam their customers so obviously should not survive. And it is up to the experts to call them out. Most consumers have no idea.
Glad I went msi
I build my first AMD system (since 18+ years) in early 2021 that used Asus MB. Since the beginning I had weird issues with my PC failling to shutdown (fans go to 100%, code 04 "Detect HDD" on the MB screen), system starting on it's own with all boot over X and wakes disabled in BIOS, or simply freezing in Windows and showing random error codes on the MB screen. I ended up replacing both Motherboard and PSU. Some issues went away but some are still there. It's a very long story of me trying different stuff for a year. The replacement process with Asus was bad. My mint condition board was replaced with one that had bottom right corner bent and broken front power LED (0V on between the pins). Plastic cover for chipset fan was not glued properly and it was sticking. And had scuffs all over the board and cooling pieces. It took me weeks going back and forth of sharing shipping box photos and explanations to finally get another replacement (btw. the box was too small and someone forced the MB into it, otherwise the box had no damages). They replaced the board but they reused cooling and plates from the previous one. So I still had the unglued chipset fan cover and scuffed plastics and cooling. But at least front power LED was working...
My father swore off ASUS over a decade ago because of a string of bad experiences. I had gotten the impression from more recent YouTube coverage that they had improved. Guess not.
Looks like it's EVGA for me I have a TUF with my 5900x but will never go back. Learn from others and yourself
Ooooooh, this is specific to X670E. I was so scared for a moment that my board would blow up at any moment, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I have an ASUS B650E.
This is really disheartening. I have been building computers for over 20 years and the majority of boards have been Asus and have been pretty loyal to them. I guess i will take my 20k a year parts budget and go elsewhere. Now off to do research on another brand. Thanks Jay
Glad I got a MSI X670e mobo
Funny. Over 20 years ago. Athlon XP time. i had issues with asus-Boards. Then i bought my first from Gigabyte. No issues. The Athlon was running fine. Even with a smashed corner on the die. Since then i never bought a asus-board again. Was a good choice 😂
so should i not buy the ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-A??
I like ASUS too. Their software reliability has been questionable, but I don't remember them joining the anti-customer warranty club.
never liked ASUS^^ Gigabyte it is :D
😳😤 I have only ever used asus MB and Graphix cards ,,,, since My first build with GTX880 ,,, what to do,, I’ve been lucky with quality and reliability,, but this news is shocking,, 🤢🤮 last build was 2 years ago,,so hopefully got some time to research things again,, 🙈🤔
Let's hope all IT influenceers follow your lead and have a large corp pay the highest price for mismanagement and bad policy and be an example for all the other companies that are behaving in a similar way. It's time for this kind of crap to stop, not just in IT but in every industry.
I just returned, a strix 4090, x670e-e, and the ROG strix 43 inch monitor AND an asus mesh router (xt8) and will be buying another brand. I am glad I started seeing this crap BEFORE I put the build together.  I will also no longer be using asus. Fuck asus.
Jay just wanted an excuse to complain about the stuff he dealt with behind the scenes. Glad you reiterated things other channels have already said. This channel is becoming just one long whining rant on everything PC
Ill take those Apexs off your hands jay. you obviously dont want them
what would you use instead?
Just to add one more small issue, I purchased an ASUS 3060 Ti Strix and the fan shroud was loose. Turns out it was just straight up missing a screw from the factory, and a couple others were loose. Not a massive issue, but could obviously cause problems such as rattles or screws being loose in your case. I looked it up and apparently I was not the only one to have this problem. Just a symptom of low quality control.
bro, and i thought that Asus was the most trustworthy motherboard maker, at that point I'll just have to go with MSI, Aorus, or Asrock for my next motherboard. Thanks for talking about this situation, such a shame...
I wanted to buy a notebook. Asus Vivobook with OLED screen. Now I’m not gonna buy that. Thnx
FIRED! 🔥
This makes me sad.  I am def an asus fanboy.  My last 10 builds have all been Asus and all my GPUs since they started making them.  But my newest build on their flagship Extreme board has been a nightmare so I am going down the same road and probably going to pull the plug on using Asus products.  Here is hoping the Strix 4090 sitting next to me in the box is not DOA.. probably the last Asus Item I will have bought after watching this.  Thank you for your honest opinion Jay
found out that blutooth doesnt work on my asus board. cant even connect a smartphone with it.. just tought its an compatibility issue with my jbl in-ear headphones..
My last 2 motherboards were ASRock.. X370 Taichi and a B550 Velocita love both boards. Especially my old X370 Taichi it was my first AMD motherboard ever. ASRock was the Very first to support 5000 series chips on B350 and X370 Boards when AMD was still saying they can't do it....
who is bigger than ASUS and also failed?
Haven't bought or sold any Asus for 3 years now. You are 100% right !
No king rules forever!
waw’ i just spent a lot of money on an i9 creator board from ASUS. You know i have built machines for myself and others since the 90s, not commercially just because i can and i like it . But money is tight and my build is very slow, i thought that i had done my homework and invested in the correct company/ motherboard… This has made me sad . It will take me a few months to pay for and complete the build, i honestly hope that it will be okay..Really poor show , Anyway your a top guy with quality content, cheers
I can fully understand. In Austria it is the same. The German ASUS Support is fooling its customers by simply sending back defective motherboards and graphics cards without repair. At least we have the guarantee and warranty obligation here, so you can avoid this fooling around. But it still takes 1 month each time. And the Asus Software Armory Crate is pure horror. I don't buy Asus stuff anymore.
I fired these fools years ago.  they have the worst support and the highest prices.  Moved on to ASRock, and Recently MSI.  Super happy with my MSI rig.
This is making me seriously consider not purchasing the ROG Ally
They should have recalled the board. Would have been the right thing to do. I doubt it would have hurt the company.
I have a beautiful white Gigabyte Z590I Vision-D ITX board with 25 seconds  loading post screen, not boot time, post screen 🤬!!! Will they going to fix this ever, NO. They release bios update , that i didn't install thank God, because they remove it from site very fast, i can only imagine what could go wrong .
sounds stupid but i have similar issues on my strix z590f gaming wifi  and more updates that come out the more issues
Dan my entire build is based on asus, what will I do now!? DX
I've been using ASUS components for all my PC building life based on their reliability, not only for me but for friends and family. When they started focusing full time into the ROG branding and turned their TUF series into more budget oriented products by removing features from them instead of keeping their core of less buzzword filled and being reliable components without the RGB/gamery stuff, I started having my doubts. Coincidentally the first time I had to RMA a motherboard has been with my first X570 build using a Strix series one that refused to boot up out of nowhere around a week after I finished my build, without any changes at all in my PC from that initial setup. Call me paranoid, but now, after getting to know from this debacle that they are using the EXPO memory profile as a blanket to not only configure RAM but also tweak the SoC voltage, which is not part of the EXPO spec... Feels like my next build will certainly not feature an ASUS motherboard at all.  Good thing we live in a world where this behavior from a company can be brought to light and not just kept in the dark, bad thing we live in the same world where it seems like lately companies are too fond of growing complacent once they reach the top and screwing on the customers that brought them there.
I’ve been with ASUS for about 5 years now and I thought it was a fairly solid brand for a while now.   I have their gaming monitors, motherboards, GPUs and have recommended it to my friends and family with confidence over those years.   I’ve recently upgraded to a i9-12900K and had to purchase a new motherboard. Coming from a previous ASUS motherboard, I headed straight for a Z690-A Prime.   First one, DOA. RAM A2 and B2 wouldn’t work which meant I couldn’t use Dual Channel memory. I thought it was me bending pins but no I was certain it wasn’t user error. Because the second one I had did the same thing.   I returned the replacement and went to MSI. Not as fancy but I didn’t care anymore cuz I was tired of everything. Now hearing ASUS is like this makes so much more sense. No longer interested in purchasing from them.
man this is soooo sad like i just updated my system and moved from msi to asus for mobo thinking like asus is top of the notch products(im coming from a i7 4790k and back then that used to be the case) and now i learn this shit ...I'm getting a new mobo asap i feel tricked as a consumer atm. Thank you jay keep doing gods work!
Chinese products always have had crappy support and not daring to admitting when they fail. It s nothing new. We get attracted by nice design when we buy, but forget about the support.
I wrote off ASUS after my experience with the ASUS PG27AQN and it's 25 inch mode that the monitor was heavily marketed with for FPS gamers. The 25 inch mode has how been widely reported to only work for select games now and when the issue was brought to them that the mode only works for some games their customer service and research teams said to talk to the game companies instead of fixing the issue by working on a firmware update. I ended up returning the monitor and don't plan on buying another ASUS monitor any time soon
A friend of mine had difficulty with an RMA on his 5800, he also got responses like "this is customer damage" with a capacitor being damaged under the backplate or cooler in a place you can't reach without taking off the plate/cooler. So it is not just the motherboards but also GPU's.
Then please also look at the latest data leak from msi and how unprofessional they are with it and putting their customers at risk. i have the feeling you can buy neither asus or msi.
Haven't really been in the PC space recently but this got my attention. Expecting a class action lawsuit here ngl
Time for a Jay and JJ (ASUS North America) interview when?
Ddr4 ones have this issue? I’m scared 😕
"Climb down the ladder because you're heading down the wrong path!"
Is it possible that my sisters ASUS X470 board which has ram instabilities is affected something similar? There's no way that her system just starts crashing more often and post loops for no reason. At one point the system would run at 3600Mhz with 4 dimms but suddenly would never run until she dropped speeds to 2800...  I buy cheaper boards and have no issue haha   Edit: 13:50 I buy ASRock boards! HAHA I own a B350, B450, and B550 boards. Nothing but stability and ease of use
Honesty right there, good job Jay! Tech-Youtube need to call all these manufacturers, producing bullshit, at the same time pushing prices through the roof, out.
Drama about computer parts? :D *eats popcorn*
I was a day away from buying a new tuf 4070 but this is making me think twice now. I'm not sure what to get instead. Msi?
fuck asus tbh, glad i didnt buy anything from them.
Tis a pity.. everyone will make a mistake from time to time.. nothing is infallible, but over the last couple of decades I have seen lots of companies act like this, but what they forget is the customer is always right  even when their wrong... customers always remember those companies that handle issues promptly  and fairly - and tend to avoid companies companies that don't..  this one reason why with  certain companies like corsair  I will always choose their products over others purely because of customer support.. imho Asus and Gigabyte  although were super good 30 years ago have dropped the ball as far as reliabilty and overvolting  since the core2 came out...
It's a sad day. I've always liked ASUS. I have a ROG laptop and the motherboard in my desktop is ASUS. I mean really it was because MSI for some reason liked red for the longest time and I hate red lol.
that moment when this video drops the day i replaced a dead Gigabyte board with a New Asus board......
in the past, i had always had good luck with Asus stuff. i had a pc last 7 years with one of their boards with only a usb going out. And the next pc last 3 years before switching from intel to amd and going with an msi board. I recall msi having issues as well with customers. I think most of these brands have had some kind of drama or another in the past couple years. The solution is either they start moving manufacturing to other countries, who can deliver better quality control, or at the least better customer support.
I commented on GN's video as well, it's sad to see Asus behave this way because they really do have some great and unique hardware especially in the laptop space (love my Flow X16). I was hoping to use an Asus motherboard for my next desktop build.
Asus used to be awesome back in the 90/early 2000s but I ditched them years ago. Their products have been garbage for a while now and their support is impossible to deal with.
If Asus makes any changes and improves would there be any thought of going back to working together?
Good to know.  My next gamer rebuild is scheduled for 2025.  It would have been centered on Asus.  Their recent shipping of RMAs as new is just unforgivable.  It reminds me of Bethesda’s Fallout 76.
Well done!!!
So here's where I ask this question: do I rip my old motherboard out and replace it with an alternative? I'm not encountering issues as I'm using a Prime MOBO and an Intel CPU, but should I ditch Asus anyways?
I'll stay with my MSI or Gigabyte MB.
Were is Gigabyte in this picture ?
Thanks!
The first thimg I did unboxing my Maximus Extreme what inspect the socket and all pins.  Thanks, Jay
Watch within a couple weeks ASUS will call Steve in and smooth everything over..
It is quite funny to watch this video from an all ROG PC. 😀
that sucks!
And now I have deleted my latest PC build list - THANK YOU!
Literally every PC I've built in the past 30 years have had an ASUS motherboard...this hurts.  I hope they can turn it around before my next build.
My whole build is asus rog, kinda sweating right now
I had issues with ASUS many generations ago with my AMD PhenomII x4 955 BE.   Support was condescending in responses and I was deferred to their forums which didn't help.  I decided long ago to never use ASUS again.  It's sad that it's taken this long for their behavior/QC to catch up to them.
Asus has a long way back to regain my trust. This is just an unacceptable behavior from a company. I have bought a lot of Asus products over the years, such as two graphics cards, two motherboards and two monitors. No more
Fck ya Jay I'm so glad you did it the way did I was about to spend 2k on computer I'm so glad I watched this
Yep, this is why i choose msi for my last board. Asus has been going downhill fast....
I stopped buying ASUS products a few years ago. On a $15 rebate they tried to say I didn't completely fill their form out but I had kept a copy and I had filled it out.   I emailed them and they argued with me. I listed all of the ASUS products that I own which was 6 products and told them I will not buy anymore or recommend them to anyone.   I finally had a higher up email me and got the rebate but I still don't buy their products.
Great job Jay! We should deny to such companies; this is obvious a scam.
Stuck with msi never had a problem.had the tomahawk. Now I got the wifi pro max. My 5800x is slightly undervolt my 3080ti. been a solid pc since I built it.
I have held this mindset about ASUS for years now. Their RMA process has always been a complete nightmare as well as their QC. I cannot trust a brand that does not stand behind their products and weasels their way out of honoring warranties.  As someone who has built many computers over the years I am surprised it took this long for outcry. When even Gigabyte stands behind their products more you've really messed up.  ASRock was once on my avoid list, but I've had good experiences with all of the boards I've used of theirs since Intel Skylake.
Well that sucks. I've been a ASUS fan for..... well my entire PC Career.  My history of building rigs have always had ASUS in them.  I'm nowhere near like Jay of course. So its saddens me to hear this crap.  I really do hope that ASUS gets their stuff together.  With EVGA pulling out that leaves what? MSI, ASROCK, and Gigabyte (hurk)?
This is so sad!  Asus was my go to Motherboard. Who do we go to now?
You all can laugh but personally ive used asrock. 5 months ago built 1 with a asrock z690 extreme with a i5 12600k and 1 with a asrock z690 pro rs with a i5 12400 both have been perfectly fine. And 8-10 years ago i built one with an asrock z75 pro3 with an i7 3770 still running to this day never an issue. I know theyre budget boards but they work and are reliable
R.I.P ASUS !!
I've got an ASUS x570 pro Wifi motherboard, ASUS TUF 3090 OC, and a 1MS ASUS monitor for gaming. The video card died in less than 2 years and the motherboard network card failed causing system problems until it was disabled in BIOS. The monitor looks blurry when I turn in games.  I used to think ASUS was a good company but after this experience I felt like I bought cheap knockoffs.
I got a 2022 Asus g14 laptop which have a motherboard issue and wouldn't go to sleep properly, I got a replacement and immediately the sound blew up when I powered it on and made some magic smoke but it's still ran, the third one is working but has hotspots on the CPU liquid metal paste and I'm not happy, I'm just going to switch to MSI or Lenovo instead from now on
I just got a new ROG laptop and I wasn't aware of any of this. (I haven't really been keeping up with this stuff, that is my fault.) This is how it always goes for me haha! I'll get something and then a couple weeks later I'll find out why I should have waited! I guess my next purchase will not be ASUS. Thanks for the heads up!
ASUS got drunk on their success and will faltered like other brands.
JayzTwoCents respect and thank for all the quality PC/Tech content compare to others Channel.
I updated my X670E to this 1410 BIOS without realising this warranty fluff. I guess I'm boned then?
Asus has been my preferred brand ever since I got a laptop from them around 2008 or so. I got everything from them whenever I could, and recommended it left and right too. Even built my current rig in January with their motherboard (running a Ryzen 7 7700) and hoping against all hope it won't kill my CPU now. Though I don't have an X3D so it should be fine... hopefully. I'm not going to update bios until it stops saying beta. But this... yeah, no thank you. Bye, Asus. It's been nice knowing you but I won't give you money while you're arrogant and there are other brands around with quality products for a lower price.
AsRock?
I uses to be an ASUS person fan but Ive had to return my ASUS graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and mother bored all with the first months they were so hard to deal with and get answers so on that it just stressed me out and they tried to void my warranty on a $1000 monitor but due Australian Law they couldn't so they had to refund my PC now days is 10 years old but no only is everything really costly but now i struggle to trust companies products and i just dont have the money to do it anymore its come to the point where i will have to go back to console even no much perfer pc gaming end times.
I’m glad I bought an ASRock motherboard instead of an ASUS motherboard.
Swapped to MSI for my new intel rig like two months ago, fk the asus tax with worse support and products. Fk you asus :)
Asus's tagline in Taiwan is "asus quality, solid as rock". Sad to see how far they've fallen. Asus has always been the go-to for me. When my parents needed a PC, it was an asus, because what else would it be.
Literally just bought a Asus board and I’m past my return period. Well now I know my next build to avoid them like the plague.
I gotta be honest, I don't know that there is anyone else with any better rma/after sales support. The whole world just doesn't care about the customer anymore once the company has your money.  Thankfully the only part i've been screwed on warranty support was my 980 TI 2 years and 10 months into its 3 year warranty dying and after spending 50 bucks on shipping back and forth getting a broken card back from EVGA. I do think that there were a lot of compounding issues from both AMD and Intel this generation, which is causing more instability this generation than ever before. DDR5 being new, power limits and turbo limits being higher than ever, more and faster pci devices than before with gen 4 ssds and graphics cards being the norm for anyone building with this generation.  Not to mention the design for all of these parts likely happened during the pandemic and potentially work from home.  It's not an excuse for bad quality conrtrol, but the fanciest most expensive boards needed to come out when the cpus came out because the kinds of people that buy the most expensive boards and cpus are mostly trying to get them when they are brand new. I am not really defending Asus, but I can see why things are going wrong, and I wouldn't even expect the problems people have been having with Asus to be limited just to them.  edit- If someone knows a PC part company with good support let me know.
Thanks for this, Jay.  I have a build for my son sitting in pcpartpicker with an asus mobo in it.  I’ll be updating the build with another brand.
I always had problems with ASUS products doesn't matter what it is and their RMA is long as hell. Gigabyte not a single issue ever. MSI fast RMA, only had one board with them. Had an AsRock was very nice.
I also had an issue with rog b650e f gaming wifi. Somehow I can't use the wifi. But I can't be bothered by sending them back this stupid board
@JayzTwoCents Sad to see this happen to ASUS, I've used their motherboards since 1996.  For your sound dropping issue, it has to do with the USB I/O controller. I had the same problem with an X3D processor and the culprit was having USB 2.0 audio, not 3.0 - for whatever reason, Gen4 PCI-EXPRESS requires all the USBs connected to be 3.0 or it'll crackle and drop out.  Fiber/SPDIF/Out gets around this issue but it's just a bit of shortsightedness and growing pains with AM4/AM5.  See if you have the same trouble with an MSI board and USB 2.0+Gen4 to double check :)
Absolutely disappointing because out of all the brands I would’ve loved to be pure ASUS
To be honest .. wish it would be just ASUS .. but I simply am not aware of a decent hardware manufacturer now. Maybe my views are totally skewed .. but I honestly would like to see some recommendations to which manufacturer might actually not be just bad outright currently.  Because the market is just a mix of muddled carp and its so difficult to get anything fixed and go through customer support, when a problem occurs. (And they do, always)
Honestly this is really disheartening. I though that I would go to ASUS for my next GPU now that EVGA is out of the game. I don't trust MSI that much. they're the only company I've had any real issues or failures with in the past with GPU and at least one motherboard. I DO NOT trust Gigabyte at all, their customer support is possibly the worst on the planet out of everyone.  That being said I do love ASRock. I've bought 4 or 5 motherboards from them and they've all been flawless. What made me go back to them was my experience in 2016 when I rebuilt my main rig with an X99 Extreme4. I bought the board and the CPU separately and as some of us know there were a few generations with the the 2011 socket. I went out and bough an i7-6800K assuming that it was compatible, and NOPE! So I talked to ASRock support to see if there was anything that could be done, and I was willing to pay for things if necessary. I just didn't want to have to try and find and older CPU that matched up with the BIOS. Well, at the end of the call their service person said that the BIOS chip is replaceable on that particular board and that they'd be willing to send another one. I said that would be wonderful and that I'd be more than willing to wait for it. She told me that'd be perfect and that since she already has my info on file that they'd send one within a few business days at no cost to me. I was floored. Low and behold less than a week went by, the chip showed up, I threw it in, and everything fired right up. Since then every board that I've gotten from ASRock as been....rock solid.....and I'd be hard pressed to find a reason at this point to go with someone other than them (except for maybe EVGA).
Damn, i'm planning to buy a 7800x3d -  and was going with a ASUS ROG Strix B650E-F Gaming WiFi, socket AM5 motherboard.. Any suggestions on what to replace it with?
Interesting. My brother and I are both running 7950X3D chips with Strix X670E boards and we have had plenty of Hard Crash/Power cycles and a few times the audio wouldn't work on our systems. INTERESTING
Disappointing to hear as I'm building two new systems this year, and I used to use ASUS.  Hearing this magnitude of issues and poor handling was nice to know ahead of time.  Thanks!
I really want to chime in here. I built my computer with top of the line Asus  motherboard and I have top of the line router AXE16000 and Axe 11000. I had major problem with the board and the 11000. Support was nonexistent. They could not help. It was a joke. They said someone will get back to me and never did. So the person you call doesn't know anything. I would explain the problem and it was like they didn't know what I was talking about. So I returned the board and got a MSI top of the line and it was like night and day. I had a small issue with the MSI and tech support was really helpful and knew their stuff. My entire rig is now MSi....I still have to deal with the Asus routers but I will never buy Asus again.
Reputations take years to make and they trashed it in one paragraph. Take some coming back from....
LOL This will age like bad milk Jay. Mark my words.
Dude I literally just made a build with an asus prime board and somehow one of the holes for the cpu were like crooked and completely ruined a brand new cpu! Didn’t know this was even a big problem. I’ve always trusted them but now I think any future build I’ll prolly go with MSI cuz they seem like they’re at least trying to improve.
RIP ASUS.  Thanks for the heads up. No way I take the chance of a failure! Specially at those prices.
Great if they work ,no back up when they don't.
Asus should care.. This channel played a big role in my purchases over the years and because of that, my last 3 motherboards were ROG.  Enthusiasts buy these high end parts and they ALL watch tech tubers such as J2C.
ASUS screwed me over with my last motherboard RMA. Never buying their trash again
I've questioned your integrity maybe unfairly this year over your views on Nvidia, but you're definitively doing the right thing here. With the quite frankly unprofessional behavior from Asus I feel there was no other option. So let me apologize, and further say you've regained my trust Jay, thank you. It takes a lot to dig into your own pockets to do the right thing, and we should all be thanking him for his grand gesture for his audience.
Asus overpriced junk. Their mobo software software is horrible once you installed it tens of different windows process shows up and its hard to uninstall it.
Good man.
I always got ASUS but in my upcoming new machine, I'll change that from ASUS to MSI 'cos this... wtf.
Holy cow, I've used ASUS motherboards since 1993. This is a true eye-opener!
As a former Asus fanboy, I am now looking elsewhere for my wife's new build.  She wants ITX, which limits me, but what brand is worthy of our dollars?  I have sworn off MSI because of their shady ethics and review issues, now Asus is gone because of their CYA approach to warranty and bios updates.  Asus could have gotten so much GOOD press by biting the bullet and offering to replace any damaged parts, but now they have lost faith from a former fanboy.
Time to say to ASUS: GTFO.
Thanks Jay! I have been on the hunt for some new parts and now I know to steer clear of Asus. It's kinda sad since my first PC was an Asus laptop that I loved dearly, but times change and I refuse to deal with this crap just to have an Asus logo on my rig. Thanks for always standing up for the consumers Jay.
I have had 2 MB's doa from Asus since 2009 as well as a monitor that lasted about a month before it started to get lines running through it. They have always been garbage in my opinion. I think they just have had a good marketing campaign.
Other tuber's currently sucking Asus's teets right now over getting free ROG Ally's - and Jay is spitting truth over here.
RIP Asus.
Really sad to see this. Been a long time fan of ASUS, for many of the reasons Jay listed. In fact I just completed a home network overhaul where I put in ASUS routers. I’ve always had few issues with there products, but this kind of behavior is scary. Thank god EVGA still makes motherboards, I guess.
Don't buy Amd stick to intel. I'll probably stick with the rog strix board my i9-9900k z390e gaming has held up great
Kudos to your decision. That's definitely worth a subscription in my opinion. Asus seem to have lost their shit at this point, and I respect that you don't just keep taking their money, but honestly inform your viewers about what is going on. I have been kind of an Asus fanboy for almost three decades. I built countless PCs, only one time not using an Asus mobo, and my current PC also has an Asus mobo and GPU. However, after witnessing first hand how unbelievably unhelpful the Asus support was with the issues I had with the Claymore II keyboard and the Keris Mouse, your story, and the videos from GN are the final straw. I will thoroughly check out other manufacturers for my next build. Can't be worse than building with Asus is how I see it at this point. The high horse metaphor absolutely nailed it. Thank you for the video!
It's sad that many brands are trying to emulate APPLE. Where PR and Marketing takes priority over products quality and functionality.
Hi, the power is in the consumers hands.....it is time for peoples to wake up and use it!!! ASUS AND NVIDIA need to be brought down to earth, and fast. You know what to do, so do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for calling this out and banning this type of corporation! I will consider this somewhat of a litmus test for other HW review streamers. If they wont call it out and cease dealings with a corporation who has let greed get the better of them, and thinks they can either get away with fooling consumers or that we will somehow tolerate paying for garbage quality hardware (and has clearly decided they dont really want to exist as a company due to these actions), than they dont deserve views or engagement. Your move LTT and others.  I really hope this is one of the points where smart employees of the company really start looking for work elsewhere, before their work history becomes more of a black mark than a boon, and they find themselves unable to find such work due to their company deciding to trade their reputation for greed. Your company wouldnt hesitate to drop you at a moments notice, and they dont deserve your loyalty, especially when they become self sabotaging.  I am just mildly perplexed by one aspect of this video, and that is the description of the 'condescending tech support emails'. I guess we would need more context to comprehend why they came across that way (maybe the advice was super obvious, or there was other snarky comments not described), but from the description provided, it just sounds like helpful troubleshooting attempts.
This is so sad honestly, I started as being a fanboy of MSI, because of their old black and red gaming X design, but as I grew older, I started loving Asus for all the features they had on their motherboards, all the big motherboards with everything you can think of on there. Really sad, but on the bright side, I love that we are this getting this kind of support by our techtubers.
The fact they can’t even handle RMAs with even the slightest thought of the customer drives me nuts. Bought a 6800XT at launch, had to RMA it, sent it back in full packaging.   They sent me a “replacement” (I had to assume without any documentation or explanation) in just a plain brown box with a single sheet of bubble wrap.
I agree with Jay. Even though I'm a generation behind, I just ordered a new motherboard to get rid of the ROG am4 board I have.
I don't get it. Does ASUS think that letting their ticking time bombs explode later (likely before the 3 year warranty period) and still saying "sorry, we can't help you there" is the neutral ground for this problem?  Oh well, as much as I don't really think class action lawsuits help the actual class being represented, I still hope ASUS gets slapped with one, and a hard one.
As someone who literally just completed a build with a 7800x3d and an Asus Crosshair x670e hero, I have had absolutely no issues with my build since bios updates have been set in place. I have had extreme anxiety paying attention to my voltage and temps lol, but I still appreciate this video as it will shed some light on their issues and hopefully improve upcoming bios releases and quality control.
ive only built 3 computers and 2, including my latest was asus, im not buying their stuff again, my Asrock worked awesome, so ill probably go msi or asrock next
Most of my stuff is Asus. Well at least now I know what to not spend on my next build!
Damn I was legit considering my next build with Asus stuff, looks like it's back to the drawing board
used to be a solid Asus fan. But after finding numerous problems with laptops and mobos (i.e. am4 sockets failing) now moving over to MSI. Shame they were always my go to brand
I have noticed since covid and supply chain issues their quality went to absolute shit. my dark hero needed to be RMA'd - which means my brand new one I paid 450$ for I get a Refurb in exchange...(not fair). Anyways the RMA board they sent months later had the same exact issue! I took the mobo, and threw it straight in the trash.  Bought an MSI and no issues; I wrote off Asus
I've always stuck with gigabyte
I have 2 Taichi's (570 and 470) and a Platinum Fatal1ty (990FX) and havent had any issues,  ASUS on the other hand had issues from day 1 for both my 570 and my Intel 10th Gen build.
I've used ASUS in probably 98% of my builds. aside from occasionally losing a single USB port on a few I never had major issues. Guess I'll be more wary.
I had the same thing with the pins.. they refused to give me a refund saying they dont send out broken boards... so i had to thro it away,. cost £550 at the time...
Uninstalled my Asus and threw in my MSI mobo. Now I guess I'll stick with another board brand :/
The last Asus motherboard I assembled (for fun) was too good for the time. Back then 'overclocking' was a new feature and the only motherboard I noticed was capable of doing it was the Asus. I don't know, I'm 40 now and I no longer hoard electronic stuffs. lol You seem to be quite disappointed and frustrated with the product. *And the CD drives, they were phenomenal at skipping scratches and keep going.
my asus monitor 900 euro broke at 2 years and 1 day bye money
As someone who has been a diehard Asus fan for several decades now (I can't even remember the last time I built anything besides a server that didn't use an Asus motherboard in it, and typically one of their better gaming ones to let me control the hardware more directly ala server hardware monitoring level) it pains me to see them do this. They had several chances to fix things and make us trust them again, but this? Especially with how they're continuing to react in spite of everything that's happened so far with this latest debacle? They clearly show that the naysayers who kept spouting that they were just greedy and they didn't care about us, just that they could make us pay a premium by slapping a ROG label on it... They might have been right. That's what it looks like now. I'll bet they're laughing their heads off at this.  But yeah... I've been a huge fan of the channel for years, and bought several of my parts at your recommendation, so I'll be watching here before my next motherboard purchase to see who we should trust and which models excel in performance and quality. Thank you for sticking to your morals even at what I have no doubt is a huge financial cost by losing such a major investor. It's incredibly rare to see someone who cares that much nowadays. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for still being here for us all, and not being bought  out by corpos.
At some point - they will care. There‘s only a finite amount of bad publicity a tech company can tolerate.
It all went downhill when they started putting that Armory Crate BS rootkit on the motherboards.
They jumped the shark.  Been an MSI guy since the socket 462 days but have equaled out with them and Asrock.  I'm happy to stay with them.
I have always been on asus since my 1st build always AMD(never been to the darkside) but Asus has been falling off for a while now had Prime B350  with 1600, B450 with 3600 and B550 5800x always playing with STOCK settings so you manually have to fix it to bring temps down and frequency up and always having little niggling USB issues but moved to Gigabyte X570s from Asus B550 and not had any issues at all. Wont be going back to Asus for any future builds
A year ago, I wanted to reward myself with an ASUS ROG Ryujin 360 AIO because I really liked this little screen on the cooler and since I already had a ROG motherboard (ASUS ROG Strix X570-E) installed, I thought it should work perfectly together. After I installed the AIO and started my computer, it bricked my windows. Even reinstalling Windows was impossible. I thought I had done something wrong, but no, after I unplugged the USB cable from the motherboard. Everything worked like before. That's when I started questioning Asus being a good brand, and this video basically proves it.
Massive respect to you for doing this
You impressed me Jay, that's how it should be done👍
Spent my last pound with these good for no warranty ass holes. Over 10k spent with my rig and builds for friends. Soon be out of business.
It's nice to have someone hold them accountable. ASUS has been consistently price gouging it's customers for years with sub-par products like thier Strix and Prime series motherboards. Their customer service is some of the worst in the industry, and I swear their slogan is "F--K the consumer!"  If you are buying ASUS products, good luck with your future replacement parts.   Thank you Jay (and Steve) for putting a company to the test finally.
Thanks for getting this out there, Jay! Getting ready to build my girlfriend's oldest son a new rig and was just starting to hash out the parts list. Looks like I need to remove the ASUS board and possibly do as you suggest and switching back to Intel for his like I did for my most recent build.
Wow, my asus motherboard just got delivered today….. which ones were having issues?? I haven’t been keeping up with it..
Well there goes another brand. I am not going to buy Gigabyte again. The last time I brought one they immediately got hacked and never got clear on what was stolen. Next thing happening was the power supply. Apparently MSI has improved a bit but well uhhh can we trust them again now? EVGA is gone so, what's left? Asrock it seems and that's basically it? An Asrock TUF board and either a PSU by Corsair or Seasonic? I mean, nothing against a solid system. But as fare as choices go, it will be rather dull if everybody is on the same system.
I've been an Asus fan since my Pentium ii build over 20 years ago and I have never had an issue but watching this really made me think about my next build.
Feel free to send me one of those boards.
Sad times, I bought an Asus ROG Strix B650E-F a few weeks ago and a Ryzen 5 7600x + 6000MHz ram from Kingston :((((
I went with MSI in 2020. Cause the asus board for my AMD cpu kept having issues for around a year prior. Once I switched to MSI all issues went away. For some reason some companies they just go to shit over time
Yikes we loose evga now we are loosing Asus to... 😢
They still make great gaming laptops, graphics cards and PSU's, but yeah their MOBO's are gash.
this and HP
It still bothers me that to this day the 'Armoury Crate' Software ASUS uses to control/update its hardware is still by far the biggest piece of garbage. There is no way to manually control fan curves outside of the BIOS and that infuriates me.
Congrats on the video, Jay. Appreciate the honesty!
Thanks for the news Jay
This is so sad.  I've been an avid ASUS/Corsair fanboi for a long time.  I build and promote with their stuff almost exclusively.  I guess it's time to look elsewhere.    side note: I also recently had a bad RMA experience with one of their monitors.
I can attest to the terrible RMA from Asus. Bought a Zephyrus G15 that had a bad keyboard. I eventually decided to send it in for repair and after 17 days (not the promised 10 from ASUS) I got my laptop back without the top fire speakers plugged into the mobo and routed wrong (had to remove heat sinks to fix this) and the bottom fire speaker wires were pinched and shorted on the mobo. Asus just said "oopsies" and asked if I'd send it in again. I ended up fixing it myself.
Thanks for keeping it real and not overly promoting their new unproven handheld like that other channel! 😁
maybe you want to buy a cheaper board
Weirdest part about growing up, is watching how the industry has changed. I haven't even been doing this as long as many, but compared to when I started in 2013, things are very different. Glad your channel is still the same!
Love AsRock been using them since Ryzen 1 after Gigabyte exposed themselves with the FX lineup
Well done Jay!
Commented on Steve's video as well but I just had to warranty an Asus laptop because it fried the PCI bus. It fried the channel used for both the GPU and Wifi, so either one would stop working at random. This essentially made the laptop unusable since I'd be in the middle of a program and the GPU would go POOF and the program would crash... or I'd be doing something and the net card would go POOF and cease to exist.  I sent it to them in a "semi" working state and it was returned to me in a non working state. I had to do a destructive install of a new OS to fix it when a soft install failed to fix the issue.
Hey Jay. Just so you know MSI released the axact same beta bios’es, which leads me to believe it is not an AIB push but an AMD thing. Just consider this before you make your decision on their sponsorship. Also, as far as I know, it is not a new thing that beta bioses are not covered under warranty especially if they did not write it, but AMD did. Just some food for thought, that’s all :-)
I've been avoiding Asus for about 10 years now, due to reoccurring technical issues and warranty problems.  It started with my first Asus laptop at uni, back in 2011. The screens plastic bezel started to crumble and break apart, after only 6 months. I took pictures and tried a warranty claim, they responded that this is not covered under warranty due do abuse of the product. I gave up the warranty claim after a week of back and forth emailing, due to not having any proof of treating the laptop correctly. This was until more and more people at my university started to have the same issue. The laptop was sold through the university, so many students had the same model. Asus kept refusing any warranty, even after emailing them pictures of 10 identical laptops, with 10 identical crumbling monitor bezels. The laptop experienced also some overheating issues, so I tried applying new cooling paste to the CPU. Three of the four CPU heat-sink screws broke of when unscrewing them, due to being of garbage quality. Was able to fix it by drilling out the left over part of the screws, got it to work another year or so. The laptop barely made it 2.5 years and was a huge waste of money. Never have I had such garbage computer in my life!  I then had an Asus GTX1060 GPU, which failed three times within it's two years warranty period. I'm lucky to live in Europe, where each repair get's in itself a new two year warranty period. This has been going on for 6 years now.   Also had an Asus Zenbook, where the soldered on caching SSD failed after 1.2 years. They refused warranty on it, due to having to many writes to the SSD. Asus being the one that chose this type of soldered on SSD as cache disk in the first place. The bios refused to continue it's boot procedure, with the defective (soldered) SSD connected to it. This bricked the full laptop, even after installing another 3.5 inch sata ssd to it. I got it to work, after de-soldering the VCC and GND pins of the SSD IC, disconnecting them from the motherboard. This laptop still works till this day, but only thanks to my embedded electronics background.  I've been avoiding asus as the plague!  I'm happy to see that others are also getting updated on their scummy behavior.
So who do you buy if not ASUS, don don duhhhh
Thanks jay for explaining in detail the reasons why you will no longer be dealing with Asus.    I had been seriously considering buying their new ally. But after hearing about all of their quality control and support issues i think I'll pass.
This is why I love this channel.  Jay (and Phil and Nick for that matter) are real and will not hesitate to call out any manufacturer for their shenanigans.  As a custom builder (mostly as a hobby) I've had issues with Asus's customer service for quite some time now, to the point where I stopped using their products a couple years ago.  Obviously seeing what's going on with them at this time, I won't be going back any time soon.
I used gigabyte ultra durable for my AM3+ build and it worked perfectly. I bought a SECOND HAND Sapphire r9 290 and it worked perfectly for 7 years until my stupid brain decided it was a good idea to try to DIY a cpu water cooling instead of the noisy fan. Threw it to the garbage bag the day after. AMD are solid. The brands selling their parts and the users are problematic
I've noticed QA/QC has been significantly depleted from companies since the pandemic. I know it can seem that big bad corporate won't care about these types of videos but I'm sure there's heads rolling at ASUS over this (and other) videos.
I haven't built a system in quite awhile.  But I have experienced (from another PC vendor) really poor support.  Sometimes I've ignored negative reviews because I have chased the lowest price.  Your honest, informed review here is another reminder for me to consider other things besides price, features and appearance.  Support on these technical devices is super important.  Since it is about time to upgrade my router (have had a string of ASUS routers), I'll be scratching ASUS off my list of acceptable vendors based on your honest appraisal.  Thanks!
i still love my 3090 Ti OC LC but ya this absolute BS, will be going another direction especially for motherboards, sucks because Asus is one of my favorites but theyve made it pretty clear they dont give a shit one way or the other.
using Crosshair x670e Hero with 7950x No problems yet with any bios from Day 1
Hmm... If not the ASUS. Who? Gigabyte?
loseing EVGA, MSI "watercooler" and Asus Mainbords in one year ;)
Wow! Definitely kudus for speaking up. I have been a big fan and user of Asus products, but when Ryzen first came out and I was able to build my PC, the Crosshair IV X370 Extreme board had an issue and the return period for the store was up so I had to RMA a practically new board to them with nearly a month time frame. In that time I started to experiment again and purchased a Gigabyte Aorus X470 board. It was not bad with a few teething issues. I have since used an MSI X570 Godlike board (currently now in my Son's custom built PC) and I am using a Gigabyte AORUS X570 Xtreme v1.1 board mainly for TB3 as it was the first board to market for AMD. The software for Gigabyte is crappy but both MSI and Gigabyte have been solid boards. The X470 board is actually repurposed with a Ryzen 2700 CPU powering my new unraid server. I did recently upgrade my Pfsense server to an Asus B550m Tuf plus WiFi board, with this my first reentry to Asus boards. It was a little bit of a nightmare at the beginning as it was locking up at first. I thought at first it was due to placing a Ryzen 1700 in it or due to I bought an open box from Microcenter (saved like 60-80 depending where you looked and it was missing all accessories) but after several firmware updates and playing with settings, I stabilized everything. It may of been Opnsense and bad drivers as switching back to the latest Pfsense seemed to help, but cannot confirm 100%. System has been stable ever since and running the network as a headless server. I agree though that Asus' quality has gone down a lot over these last several years. I really wanted to jump to the Asus X670e Cross hair Hero or Extreme for a few reasons, including USB4 as far as I saw was only on Asus boards but haven't checked lately. May need to rethink....
I haven't bought anything ASUS in almost a decade. They've been charging a premium on products that doesn't equal to better product
I bought an ASUS tuf a couple of years ago and it's my first ASUS product. After seeing the recent developments I'm seriously considering trying to trade for a desktop or just selling it to try and buy and build something else in the future. To say my confidence in them is shaken is an understatement given everything I've seen between here and Steve's channel.
I have a X670E TUF plus Wifi and I haven't used it yet because of this issue and I want to be safe. ALSO the GPU lock came broken and scuffed. I can still use it but my GPU is hiding the damage. Also fan pins were all bent. The USB header broke off from removing a cable once and I had to reattach it. I hope I don't have any issues. Asus considered it physical damage on my end despite coming like that out of the box. I already paid too much for this so I can't just buy a new board.
First EVGA.. Now ASUS.. who's next?
Yes I remember the RMA and warranty mess from years ago also with ASUS read about it on many forums from back then mostly techpowerup. Anyhow not surprised at all always thought they were ASUCK Republic Of Greed. Overpriced glitter on poo. Call me a fan boy but good choice going with MSI always found their mid tier to enthusiast class motherboards to be very good quality.
Dang I love asus. My 570E board from them has been rock solid that was a 700 board. I’d be very annoyed if I was in this gen of pc components (5950x). I hope they fix these issues because I really like there products
serously jay? why dont you just use intel? you want to use AMD that bad? why do you want to torture self for them? just wait if they decide to release a 2nd generation 3d chip so we know its not just a gimmick to sell cpus.. there is so many issues you are having and will have that if you went with intel or even a proven ryzen chip you would not have to worry about. i hope asus gets sued for any fire caused by their messed up mobos
Based on how much asus boards wer used on this chanel i was planning build my PC around one glad i waited...
ASUS has been making lots of good boards for years. I think this is an overreaction.
So, Jay, I know you don't reply to all that many posts, but this leaves me in a quandary. I have the B650-A ROG Strix Gaming Wifi board. Do you recommend people dump their Asus mobos or should this issue be limited enough that it shouldn't be a concern? I mean, I've rendered video, gamed, and done stress testing and benchmarking. It appears to be fine. I'd prefer to not drop another $300 on the mobo. Talk about a company that doesn't deserve anybody's business going forward.
Thumb's up Jay.  Companies that make immoral bottom line based decisions need to be called out. Don't worry about Asus, Linus will pick up the slack, I mean breaking things is his schtick isn't it? Also, its funny Asus thought pulling the pages was going to go unnoticed which really is laughable. I wonder how many of those pages were backed up by the Way Back Machine? I used to only buy Asus motherboards exclusively, then the support tanked about 10 years ago and I stopped buying any Asus products and have not since.
Thanks jay , gee wiz ive just bought and built my new rig with the x670E & R9 7950x3d  and so far so good ill just run it on standard settings and newest bios for now till new bios comes out, i totally get you with ditching asus, im now on edge every time i turn pc on, my previous rig was a gigabyte x399 threadripper, motherboard packed in and to expensive to replace as is almost 3 years old.
I'm sorry for this... They are putting the sus in Asus.
Returned my order today: ASUS PRIME X670E-PRO and Ryzen 9 7900 CPU. My new build will be MSI Motherboard and Intel. After i have juse Asus motherboads for years now i can say newer agin, after this. Bye Bye Asus
So nice to see some people still have bolls and have not completely sold their soul for money! I'm not the "fan type of guy", but I've been watching your channel for a while and with this episode you've earned my respect 100%!
It's better to lose sponsorship than lose viewers due to trust issues.
OK... So no Gigglebite or Asucks.. What does this leave us? I've been using MSI but I'm not proud of it as MSI does some sketch shits as well
I just built a PC with a 7800X3D and a ASUS Prime X670E board :(
Really glad I spent $4k on an amd/asus build back in the beginning of march lmao
Hi! Thanks for the information. Personally I have had a few asus computers and yes built them myself.. yes really I did. The last one had a 5950x and had lots of usb problems and stability issues on 2 of 3 motherboards that I used. My current pc is running great but if there are any issues.... I definitely will keep away from asus. Love love loved my old Gigabyte pc. Never had issues. Maybe I will go back next upgrade. Hearts to you all!❤
I loved the "you better start climbing down the ladder now so you have a softer landing" comment. ❤  And this will absolutely affect my future purchasing decisions. Had a mobo in the cart for a upcoming buddies build. Not anymore!
Glad I went MSI for my build
Idk my ASUS-B450 PLUS works perfectly
Really bad timing on the side of ASUS… But good that you do this, Jayz!
Comment for the algo
Asus always just seemed too expensive to me for motherboards. I dropped them back in the early 2000s when I had 2 boards fail in a row on me.
Wouldn't the reason for the bios voiding the warranty be more in line with them not paying for someone that bricked their mobo accidentally because they didn't know how to change a bios though?
teardown an ally
Looks like the decision between ASUS and MSI for my new build has just got a lot easier, thanks for the heads up.
stop blaming ASUS for AMD's problems, if all of this shit was on Intel's side there would be fires
Ive been having a lot of issues with my x670e hero board lately as well, mainly with my Ethernet port, says its fast but ive experienced slow browser loading and spotty internet along with various bsod's and software like Icue and Armory lagging hard with connection issues with the rgb...wish i knew this stuff before i bought it in december
R.I.P. ASUS you have got too big for your own good and are now falling to the ground hard LOL. I have a ASUS Tuf Gaming A17(2021 version) and after a reinstall of Windows has a driver related problem that Windows claims as being the USB and Windows stopped the hardware due to problems but all ports are working I called ASUS and they was no help they said I would have to send the laptop back to them at my own cost and I can't afford that and since I replaced the SH*T battery they installed in this laptop when new that I wasn't even getting 3 hours runtime on battery saver they now claim replacing the battery with a ASUS branded battery that was designed for this laptop(the one that came with the Ryzen 7 version) has voided the warranty but yet they claim you can upgrade the memory, the SSD's but once you replace their crap of a battery bam you have no warranty. The battery is a ASUS branded battery and the same one that would have come already installed in the Ryzen 7 version of this same laptop now I feel they screwed me also. I took my laptop to the local computer shop and they think it's a custom ASUS driver that's not on ASUS's site meaning there's no way to get this driver but they told me since everything seems to be working then don't worry about it. I won't be buying ASUS again after this and I was a die hard ASUS fan since 2012 and my main computer is mostly ASUS hardware(AM4 build) Even if ASUS get's it together I'm not sure if I'll ever trust them again as a company they don't care about us and only care about their bottom dollar. Sorry ASUS you lost another customer
Finally!! The brand is from Taiwan. People who live in Taiwan have known ASUS to be anti-consumer for a long time. When people ask for recommendations, ASUS is often marked as highly unrecommended.  We have a joke here: "If you buy an ASUS product, you're embarking on a mission for warranty repair."  Obviously, it's not really a joke but rather a reflection of the truth. Sending your product for warranty repair again and again, only to have it come back with the same or even more issues, is extremely annoying and disappointing.  ASUS has been on my blacklist for a long time, never buy ASUS products.
Always knew asus was a bit shitty, ill definitely avoid.
Wow. This is literally putting your money where your mouth is. Huge Kudos, Jay! right
Wow.  Solid.  I have a lot of Asus stuff but not going forward.
my 7950x and asus 670e e is complete garbage, it is super slow and asus tech support is garbarge also, i have open case numbers and they have done nothing. .
Daaaang. Asus was my go-to brand for like two decades. They have fallen so far, it seems. I'll never buy another Gigabyte product and now, I guess Asus is undeserving of my money, too.
I'd get rid of the MSI board in your rig. Their signing keys for BIOS's have been leaked on the dark web
I'll miss you, Asus + Noctua. Here's hoping Noctua partners with some other card maker.
MSI has ALWAYS been junk, lol.
I remember during my 4790k build years ago opening an Asus motherboard and having bent pins. Then having support tell me I did and it couldn't of been them. Haven't touched an Asus product since.
Thanks for giving out the info. I was getting the same feeling after using several of their products. It was a disappointment consumer experience, the quality is just not on par with the high price I paid.
Way to go Jay! This is awesome news. A lot of times us little guys can feel screwed by these companies so people like you speaking out is huge. Cathartic, really.  Hardware problems are a thing, but how you interact with your community in the  face of those hardware problems is much more important.  Won't be buying from them in the future.
agreed man, not buying asus parts
"thanks, Steve!". I mean, thanks, Jay!
I went with an Asus X670E Hero. Seeing how they handled this situation, I definitely wouldn’t have bought from Asus if I had built my PC today.  Infinite amounts of thanks to content creators like you, Jay; would never have known about these issues otherwise.
not only the bios issue with the motherboard is crazy, but remember when they f'ed up with simple communication with ekwb about the material used in their motherboard then caused corrosion in many custom water build and let ekwb to do most of the works? yeah, they literally don't mind giving us product that will fail in a short period of time.  asus used to be a high end and great brand. but now they are on a way to become a true void shell of themself. shame...
So MSI or GIGABYTE for board?
Respect Jay
I pick up a Asus Maximum Extreme Board for 380 Bucks last decade & got 2 Bios Updates for a premium board. that was unacceptable for me, so i tryed MSI and picked up that MEG Z390 ACE for i9 9900K. MSI released 12 Bios Updates for that Board.
ASUS needs to make a u-turn and back all of its products with unconditional warranties, expedited replacements, and spend the next 12 months inculcating high standards of quality control before anything is shipped out or firmware updated.
Do these issues effect mid to low range boards? Or is it just the high end uber boards?
Apparantly Asus deleted the note now btw
I see why my ASUS strix motherboards all have issues and both run intel i9 12/13th gens none stop issues including friends.
asus stocks plummeting because of this lol
I've always used Asus motherboards and was about to start a 13th gen intel build with Asus again.  Now what? Never really liked Gigabyte, had issues with ASRock in the past, maybe I give MSI a shot?
Last decade been buying everything ASUS this ends today.
I'm still mad at them for the TPM related stuttering issues that were definitely NOT fixed by an Agesa related BIOS update like they claimed. I have to keep my TPM turned off for my 5600x B550F strix board to not cause stuttering every 5 seconds. And it has no physical TPM header for me to use my own and fix the issue. Utter trash.  Back to MSI for my next build
I never seen anyone bolder than you. Cheers
Man, its so good seeing Another big time youtuber do something like this. This is pure honesty.   But i just wonder if he'd be doing this if there wasn't other brands lining up to sponsor their videos??
Yeah I'mma think again before making another purchase from Asus, kudos to you and your PR teams from a 20+ year customer.
I have an ASUS TUF Gaming B450-PLUS II mobo. I bought it cheep in 2020 when cpus and gpus where unobtainable. only started using it a year ago and already I have a fault with the RGB. I set it in software to just stay red and that was fine for 4ish months. then the mobo controller wouldn't show up in amory crate so after taking half an hour to download and 1.5 hours to install it  still wasn't detected. I diagnosis is that the usb link fried or something.
Asus did not honour their warranty. My Asus z590 ROG Hero out of nowhere burned the capacitors and they are refusing to fix it even under warranty. I keep everything in stock at stock level
Hrmmm, I have been having some performance issues on my gaming rig since starting to get into VR. I had thought it was because my system was geared more towards 1440p gaming so I don't have a lot of grunt for VR but, I still feel like I am not getting the VR performance other people seem to be getting from a similar builds. I do have a newer ASUS board in it too.   I have been getting similar weird transient performance issues since I put the system together. I just always chalked it up to Windows doing Windows things or some other issues that I never troubleshoot because the drops are so sporadic and short it's not worth the time. Now I am thinking it might be my MoBo. I have been an ASUS fanboy forever and never even considered that my motherboard might be the issue, even through all the reported problems in the last year.
Even my X570 ASUS board has given me nothing but issues since I built my PC a few years ago. Next build I’m avoiding anything ASUS.
I've been saying this for over a decade now. They treated me poorly when I was a reviewer and I swore them off then. When I went high end I moved to ASRock in 2012 and never looked back. I took a gamble on them again with a niche product the P10S WS and received piss poor customer service which I still have the chat logs. I currently have the Z690 TUF D4 because of a Microcenter deal and regret not spending the extra cash on ASRock since the ethernet port completely died 2 weeks after install. I'm glad to see at least a couple techtubers are finally catching up with their shitty practices. Now we need the same with Nvidia and their blatant anti-consumer practices.
You saying ASUS is no longer worthy of being a sponsor for the channel means alot to me as a viewer and consumer. To know that you have us in your mind first and foremost before making a video or accepting a deal proves to me that you are a very trustworthy guy. Thank you for everything, Jay. Here's to another 11 years of content!
I've had some issues with my 2020 rog zephyrus g14 laptop. Asus is not a perfect brand by any means.
👏👏 I'm glad I didn't opt for any Asus products when building my rig a few weeks back, I went intel so likely wouldn't have faced issues but I'm glad I didn't support the brand financially.
daaamn, jay my good sir you have my respect!
Jumping on the bandwagon jay?
You gotta keep AMD and try a different motherboard, otherwise we'll never know what was wrong.
Funny (or sad), I recently got a new monitor (not asus), because after about 1 1/2 years my asus pg278qr had developed some weird bright smudges in the area of the top browser bar (stuck pixels or something). It still had warranty so I got a replacement and sent back the defective one. After only about 7-8 months the replacement had the SAME ISSUE and now they didn't want to replace it anymore, because the warranty had expired by that point. Yes, my monitors are on for 15+ hours a day, BUT my secondary monitor is a benq xl2411z I've used for over 9 years now; both are tn panels, both are in constant use, but the benq still has no issues of any kind. At least for the near future, I don't think I will buy anything asus again.
I bought an ASUS rog strix b550 mb to use with my rtx 3060 ti  but it doesn't want to run on pcie gen 4 i need to select gen 3 then only it will boot in to windows. and i have the latest bios installed.
That is why I use Gigabyte products
1:12 lol that "stuff" voiceover instead of the "shit" that Jay actually said 😂
Now off the list for my new build!!!
Thank you Jay.
I just bought a Z690 Strix 2 weeks ago, anyone know if I should be worried? Have a 12700kf in it.
The stability issues I had getting XMP going on my 12th gen Asus board with DDR5 was infuriating! Finally, they had a semi stable BIOS, and I just decided to forget XMP, which hurts me a little inside, and decided to more than likely go MSI or EVGA on 14th gen. Which sucks because I have become so accustomed to always going ASUS for my MB and GPU. But after seeing this and the continue decline in quality, the decision to change on the next generation is now a whole lot easier.
Hi Jay, sorry for asking but can you do a new Motherboard recomedation vídeo soon? The only one I had avalible to buy was this one, a asus lol.
Wow! This blew my mind! I have been a ASUS supporter for years, and can't believe that they are dropping the ball so bad! Well, MSI here I come!
A couple years ago I bought an Asus laptop with a discrete GPU. It started to give the BSOD in like 2 weeks. I took it back and try to avoid Asus ever since.
"Now I have an MSI Board in there so I'm free and clear from asus's problems"  No... you are not, MSI's intel boot guard keys have been leaked. Your chances of being hacked are higher with an MSI board where you can literally be forced to update that comes with malware and theres nothing you can do about it. Why use beta software? You should never use beta software, its always been a risk? The hell? You'd rather use MSI? A company who refused to pay hackers so they leaked their intel boot guard keys, and risk everything for small business owners? Wow.
I received an Asus mobo with bent pins last week.
so before all this started i updated all my gear to the nw stuff i got the 7800x3d and the asus x670e extreme and had the same ram problems till they did the bios update to fix it and it did i havent touched any setting or updates sense and havent had a problem so im taking this as a warning to not update any further till ive heard its fixed correctly sad i wish all this would of happened before i upgraded cuz it took me for ever to save up for the build i have now idk what i would do if something on there end messed up my computer becuse i installed an update they said would fix it but there fix voids warrenty idk i see lawsuits in there future.
I’m going ASRock for my next build I think, their boards just work, RGB isn’t great but I use rgb software from 3rd parties anyways
Well no Asus for me so long hero on wishlist.
I had an Asus TUF RTX 3070 Ti OC, I went to a TUF 4070 Ti and got intermittent black screens. I took the card back and got another.  Same thing.  I switched to an ASRock RX 7900 xt, then to a RX 7900 xtx. No problem with either.  I was told by Microcenter that ASUS switched were the cards were manufactured. QC is clearly lacking.    As you noted, ASRock has been solid.  I'm good with the xtx. I'll see where things stand in about 3 years.
man i just built my first PC last year with asus mobo and gpu.. i had thought asus was top tier and avoided assrock cause it was less known, how the turn tables
who even does stuff like this (warranty) it'd be like "this toothpaste will make your teeth super white, but if they rot and fall out it's your problem since you shouldn't have used it"
It's a shame that the corporates get too big to fail and then they slack and crash all the while burning before the crash. Just look at Craftsman. Their tools use to be great, then they went with another manufacturer to china made crap. Even the auto industry is no different... The Corporate Boards don't care - they make money in either direction and screw everyone.  Now don't get me wrong, some Corps do make a change for the better by putting the right people in the right spot! Even MSI screwed up on some of their X570 boards and at the last minute brought back the Tomahawk X570 - IT's a great board especially the thermals. I use to use the XFX boards in my HEDT & Servers - ALSO GREAT BOARDS This is why we tune into channels like yours Jay to get the scoop, and with Steve doing all the nitty gritty  gets to the root of these problems...  As they say, time to move on.....
Real sad to hear these stories, I've always used ASUS boards and only one had a fault (specific SATA ports kept disconnecting) on my i7 920 build. Currently using a Strix AM4 board, will have to reconsider when I next upgrade unless things turn around.
I've had issues with Asus products dating back at least a decade! I refuse to deal with them anymore. The problem is systemic; a metastatic cancer brought on by psychopath management. Excise the tumor! Thank you for speaking truth! You gave them a fair shot.
Now did you remove your cmos battery? 😂😂😂
algorithmus
This is bad news for Asus's ROG Ally
Actually really sad that this is even needed. But, it really is. Even still, I'm not sure how much it will help.
*asrock sits down*  "First time?"
Msi Titan or -Asus- Scar 18 xds
It is not Asus's problem, it is AMD's
Watching this with a crosshair X670e gene installed motherboard, that I paid 630 for.... Feels bad about my setup now. .
Damn Ive been waiting for the new intel chips to drop to spend 5k on an I9 build, but Im scared I didnt know the industry was so fucked up. Im gonna have to catch up on Youtube. I literally dont know whats safe anymore
Has anyone had issues with the asus z790 rog Maximus hero ?
You got bent pins? I got tiny piece of copper in the socket of X670E Extreme, which I was lucky to notice before it killed anything! Then it has been steadily degrading its memory stability used to run 5000 MT four DIMMs but now only runs at 4200 MT stable. I suppose 7950X has been pretty unhappy about the SoC voltage EXPO has been pumping it huh, as the degradation stopped when the news came out about the SoC voltage issue and I manually set it lower. But can never get the good ol 7950X back to what it was. And other BIOS issues...  ;(
Right when everyone else is releasing their gushing ROG Ally reviews, this video drops. 🔥
As someone who works in law and as I commented on the GamersNexus video. I'm pretty sure ASUS is breaching European Union and UK law. Specifically the General Product Safety Directive. Plus others. The attempt to not suppprt boards with a warranty after a very clear product defect by releasing unsupported software (BIOS). Also illegal and wouldnt stand up under consumer protection law in the courts.
Looks like it's back to Asrock.
@Jayztwocents kudos to you and the rest of the team for the heads up in the Asus Mainboards. There was a beta version for the most recent of the ROG Strix B550-F-Gaming-WiFi edition and I waited until the final version 3002 bios. This is giving insight before I build my next upgrade and yes it was going to be a Z790 with an i5-13600K
Me and my brother bought identical Asus Socket A boards, both of them needed Warranty RMA twice, each (4 RMA cases under warranty). I got a Abit instead that lasted 5 years before retirement, but still working fine. My brother got a MSI that lasted 4 years before retirement also still working fine.  2 Friends bought identical Asus Nvidia 5600 or something, one because his Asus 4600 ti died and the other was just a normal purchase. Within warranty they both had memory failures and both was RMA. Both of them chose to get it replaced by the legendary Tyan ATI 9800 instead and they lived on happily until normal retirement.  A colleague bought 2 Asus boards for him and his wife for the Intel core quad. First board died 1 month over warranty and the other died 3 month later.  I bought a Asus Vega 64, the one that has a loose cooler just like the Asus 5700xt model with the same cooler also has the same problem. The Asus RGB and overclocking utility was fighting with the AMD driver, leading to fan stop until 70 degrees followed by fan panic high speed until 50 degrees and then fan stop again. Tried to RMA the bad VRM cooling because the cooler was falling off the board, but Asus send me and article that 110 degrees hot spot is fine. When I replied that it was the VRM designed by asus, cooled by asus designed cooler and not the hot spot that was the problem, the reply was it is working as intended, RMA denied.
I just bought a TUF 4070 the other day, wish I saw this video sooner
Not just asus, they all bad maybe except asrock and evga
I've used ASUS products in my builds since around 2005. My next build will not have any ASUS components in it. It's just sad seeing what have become of this brand, but whatever, there are others out there :)
Team MSI for the last 2 years. ASUS fell off a long time ago when their customer service went down the drain.
Not defending ASUS, but I am curious if Jay talks to his Rep from ASUS before posting videos like this or does he just put them on blast?
Thank you Jayz, you are one!!  also ASUS, you could do better, You were my go-to brand for parts, not anymore!!
I repair motherboards and gpu's and by far and wide the board that comes up the most is asus rog strix x570, to the point now i see them and immediately say no fix.
It is sad to hear, a few years back ASUS was the brand that I would recommend.  I also have a motherboard and GPU from them now and I don’t have any issues with it, but hearing all these stories makes it difficult to keep recommending them. Yeah all brands have issues I remember MSI was not great but they seem to have worked on becoming better again
Every computer part manufacturer has a history of screwing the customer. I remember MSI was doing the same crap. Everyone will denounce them and after some time sneak back into  bed with them.
Sounds like my asus crosshair hero vii. I thought it was anything but the MB to begin with, but hey.. look at the ram QVL list.. it kept growing.. but my g.skill ram disappeared from the qvl list. Mysterious... When I finally got hold of another MB (gigabyte), and everything is rock stable again.. Meh. Asus.
I used to buy only ASUS mbos in the 90s. The last one I used was I think P4P800 deluxe... Since then ASUS was terrible, mostly with ram incompatibility. After experimenting, I switched over to MSI, since my Core2Duo 8400, and never looked back. I always build systems for my friends, family and customers with MSI boards and never had any issue, except that the boot slower...  I hate ASUS mobos but not the gpus....😐
My Asus tuf f15 2021's motherboard malfunctioned causing the screen to not work. 1 week after receiving the replacement that I waited for almost a month, the same thing happened
Ive been hearing since my childhood over and over again that whenever you need a part you can trust, go for ASUS. Sad to hear this era is over.
You definitely nailed the problem with ASUS as being how they handle their problems.  I've been a solid ASUS and SuperMicro fan since the 90s.  So very sad to see how ASUS is handling problems in the PC enthusiasts area, which is so connected to social media.  It is really amazing that Asrock is starting to look like my go-to brand for building PCs for my friends and family.
So disappointed in ASUS, used to recommend this brand for how solid it is guess that changed.
I've been a loyal Asus brand guy for 23 years. Having second thoughts now. But if I was a high level exec there I would call a meeting and make everyone watch this 17+ min video in full.
That board you received basically was from the "Defluencer" shelf to lower the brand :D
This is an overreaction based on your misunderstanding of the BIOS description, which reads: “… as provided in the Product Warranty …”. Installation of the beta BIOS does not void the warranty.
😮🤣🤣😍
I've always used Asus motherboards and honestly considered their X670e ProArt. But even that one got a hastily rushed out, warranty voiding BIOS. Which is just unacceptable!!! That motherboard is aimed to professional users that need a reliable system and yet they would post that POS?!? They really just changed the number in every single one and pushed it out without testing it beyond "Does it boot?" regardless of what kind of user you where...
Nice work Jay, those aint cheap motherboards you are giving up on but in the end if they create more problems then solve you are just saving time and money in the long run. Hope Asus takes this QC seriously and makes some necessary changes.
Thanks Jay, you rock!
Jay: sorry Asus your fired Me: Buys And ASUS Dual RTX 3060 12GB 2 Months Ago
Sad to see ASUS going downhill. EVGA leaving the GPU makes me sad 😢 I considered them and Sapphire to be the most consistent brands. I've had decent luck with Gigabyte and Asrock.
I've used Asus in my last 3 personal/family builds using mid level CPUs but I will reconsider my next build due to this recent development.
I had an Asus board in my old build rampage IV extreme ( it had its own gimmicks the chipset fan was only working if it was set to off … and after multiple revisions of bios updates it never got fixed, so after that when it was upgrade time decided to go Amd for a change, I was looking at an Msi and an Asus (AM4) board it was the same price so I went with Msi I have not seen a single bsod, 0 issues so on my recent upgrade I went with MSI again.  0 confidence in Asus, not much of a confidence in Gigabyte  either with their explosive approach to psu-s 😅  In general feels like qc started declining since the pandemic.
I dont know about how good modern Asrock stuff is but... Im still rocking my 5+ yr old Asrock z370 ITX + OC'd 8700k ... the cpu easily pulls 190w w/o the mobo/cpu caring, even with its smaller VRM. Its amazing to see just how crappy(in quality and polish) a lot of stuff has gotten over the years, its one reason while remain on this rig as long as it can adequately play games =) ... its simple, reliable and quality.
What a cluster. I’ve been using ASUS exclusively for ages. Now I have to decide between MSI and Gigabyte for my next build.
That sounds awkwardly like what happened to my system i delidded the cpu with der8auer tools and it worked fine at first but i had some crashes bugs and i tried to fix it because i thought it might be the 6400mhz ram which was not specifically made for amd and pretty new so i even though the board was supporting ram up to that speed i thought that this might have been it but now it doesnt boot any more i never increased the voltages beyond recommended values which i checked online and in the bios still i thought i might have grilled the memory controller now i am not so sure anymore i need to save a little bit more money to try in 2 months or so with a new cpu or new motherboard. Asus Strix B650e-e wifi ryzen 7600x and kingston fury renegade 6400mhz
I could literally listen to Jay talk all damn day. Please upload more Jay! Please!!
All new stuff us crap. Nvidia is melting, Radeon coolers failing, Asus mobos blowing away... And yet you laugh to a 10 years old computers that can still run modern stuff. Your new rig is failing, the one that you paid 2-3 grand.... And you laugh to that 10 years old system that still runs? I dont get it.
In January I built a new machine, and used a bunch of ASUS parts. Can't believe how much I regret that. Motherboard has been buggy since day 1. Onboard LAN controller won't resume from sleep, even after a bunch of driver / bios updates. ASUS claims it was a known issue that has been fixed, but the internet is _full_ of people saying they gave up and bought a USB dongle to replace their ethernet... on a $700 Motherboard! I just upgraded, so it won't matter for a few years probably, but I'll not be buying any more ASUS products.
you still need to review them 😅
Kudos Jay!! You are the man. You are a hero for doing this!!!
So is it supposed to be all X3D cpu's with asus X670E Hero because I have a 7950X3D and I use 6000 CL30 ram with expo enabled and CPU voltage never goes above around 1.21V
Finaly Jay came to his senses. And this is n-th time asus has done this shit. Like he said,it's garbage.
I was planning on buying a new asus wifi router but now I’m having second thoughts…
I appreciate you and others calling ASUS out on this. AMD seems to have a history of partner issues when new platforms are rolled out. I remember the VIA chipset days around the turn of the century (yeah, I'm old) and needing to replace my PC. Being an AMD fanboy (and previous employee) I attempted to gather the parts, but I couldn't find a stable combination. I think some of these challenges is what led to AMD to start producing their own chipsets around that same time, although VIA was still mainstream for the home/budget PC builder. Thankfully things eventually stabilized, but I went Intel for years due to the quality of available platforms to use from AMD partners -- so AMD needs to step up here as well, as this affects their reputation even if not directly at fault. I guarantee that there are people scrambling at ASUS to address this, they just have processes and procedures they are following that don't account for an issue like this. But, now is a good time to address this and be open about it with their customers.
What a bummer to hear! ASUS have been one of my fav brands when it comes to parts.. I might not buy  ASUS anymore, thx Jay!
Here in South Africa, your choices for AMD motherboards are Asus, MSI, Gigabyte and AsRock. Every now and then you'll see BioStar or Colourful, but those are minor. Here's my problem: MSI just recently had a massive supply chain attack/hack and their firmware is at major risk, mainly Intel boards but who knows. I have had endless hassles with my AsRock Taichi X470 Ultimate board and my trust is low in the brand. Gigabyte works I guess, but they always seem to cut some corner somewhere that annoys me. Asus is my go to brand, but this really worries me for future builds. I turn to Asus for reliability and quality and now I wouldn't know where to turn next 🥴
A few years ago I bought an ASUS gaming laptop. It had a factory defect, the heat pipes did not dissipate heat. Sent 2x to their service, because the warranty and 2x they replied that it was because of Windows 7 and the warranty will not cover it. When the warranty expired, I gave it to a friendly IT specialist and he said that the heat pipes are damaged. Well done ASUS. No more ASUS.
When a company doesn't warranty their products because they made a mistake, then it's time to stop buying their products.
I watch a tech repair channel, and THE NUMBER ONE most repaired item on his videos is ASUS ROG Strix gaming laptops. Bad Mosfets are the number one reason, GPU and CPU fried are the next. ASUS has been garbage for years, just took a while for their crap to jump ship from gaming laptops to desktop stuff now as well.  ASUS just doesn't care anymore, they pulled their marketing bullshit with the "Republic Of Gamers" branding, and people fell for it.
I noticed Asus has been half assing a lot of things but I didn't know it was this bad. I guess this just further solidifies my stance on the ROG Ally - there ain't no chance you're getting that thing repaired if it breaks, and probably support will end shortly.
Yeah, that is sad. I have been with Asus for years. And I really mean for years, had their card in Geforce 7xxx series times, had their motherboards, as well. They always worked perfectly. Asus was a role model back then how to manufacture computers parts. They were often more expensive than Epox, Gigabyte or cheaper companies like ASRock, but usually worth it 100%.  Right now I'm looking for a new laptop, the highest possible tier, so the pool is pretty narrow. MSI, Dell, XMG, Asus, give or take. And I got to like Asus Rog Strix G16 2023 the most, but the longer I read user's reviews, various issues, random, unpredictable, complete negligence from Asus's site e.g. denying a problem even exists while many people experience it. I am talking about GPU switching and HDR issues, stuttering, black screens, restarts, even bricking a laptop. The only company that stood up for it and is trying to help is XMG. They investigated the problem for real and explained it in details to help the users, Nvidia / Intel and laptop manufacturers. And if their Neo laptops had miniLED, I would instantly buy it. Sadly, their displays are mediocre af. So I am just postponing the purchase and waiting for Asus proper fix which isn't coming and it's already taking way too long. I no longer trust their products and spending so much money for top tier laptop that I expect to use for at least 5 years becomes very risky :( Even though on the paper that laptop is damn good.   Glad people make a fuss about it now. They should. It's not fair. I can understand cheaper companies have to cut costs somewhere, but Asus, with their top tier products, the most expensive stuff you can find and with their profits. The hell with it...
Geez ...im glad i dont have anything in my pc thats Asus related🤣...I liked the Fuck you Asus🤣
This a bad screwup no doubt but don't Bud Light Asus they do not deserve that. They have also done stuff like a bios update that made my Z270 series board compatible with Windows 11 saving untold dollars for customers who do not have to either stick with Windows 10 or get rid of perfectly good I7-7700k machines. I do hope we can get the message across that the behavior you are addressing is wrong and will not be tolerated! Thank you and Gamers Nexus for covering this.
Integrity is a rare thing. Lets hope more tech tubers do the same. When companies are this bad they need the kicking they deserve.   Dyslexic, if you can read this, great.
Its been a sad year with EVGA dropping out of GPU's and ASUS utterly shitting the bed. Imagine MSI and Gigabyte being the quiet ones this year.
That's why you are where you are Jay. Asus will need to get better, or actually get back where they were. Clearly they have management problems there that have to be fixed. I hope they do not mess up.
You were AMDASUSED
If Asus keeps pulling these scams, the only market they will have left is the Handheld market with their new successful Rog Ally lol.
im 35 years old. when i was 15 i swore off asus end never looked back
i had a asus prime x570  pro  with some failures in the pci/e slots  what caused connection losses of my gpu and nvme´s sporadically . RMA asus conclusion ..."  thats not our fault  here your unrepaired board ......  fck that shi... 200€ for nothing  NEVER AGAIN
Good to see you're willing to ditch a huge sponsor on principals rather than keep the $$$ and pretend all is okay. On the same topic, a friend has had problems with the ethernet port being disconnected when starting certain games. When I looked into it there were loads of people with similar issues on other games and different setups with one common denominator...Asus motherboards. Not surprised by this outcome after seeing that.
Well I was always sticking to Asus for the motherboard. I add one ASRock for my ITX build and Im really happy about it, also some MSI board for other build. but most of the time I choose Asus for the trust I have for us but now we'll I will change my mind and I will choose "by default" MSI or ASrock, thanks for this video. We can open our eyes on something very important. as you say we also trust a brand by how they handle the problem and Asus decide to cut the trust so good bye Asus
And I used to like ASUS... I currently have an asus card 3080 I bought like 2 years ago (my previous card was Asus too) and 2017 mobo and love them both but after this... no more for quite a long time...
I respect you more for this Jay sticking to MSI for now
To be honest, I have been an ASUS fan for a long time, my whole system right now is a full asus, fortunately it is older gen hardware (Crosshair VIII, 3070, 3950x etc) but still, this is unacceptable. I was planing to move forward with ASUS, and upgrading to the newest hardware, but after reading all the new, seeing all the videos, I just can't. Also the thing that bothered me, was their stupid software. It is so bad, slowing down the PC, not working properly. I dissapointed really.. cause ASUS has (for me) the nicest looking mobos, but anyway, I'm thinking of moving to MSI... so long partner.
LOL, Asus really wants to go bankrupt...
I feel like asus is a kid that just got yelled at 😂😂
On the Asus Strix 670e motherboard bios page they have 2 bios that are not Beta versions. BIOS 1303 and BIOS 1202, why not just flash those instead of this rant?
I'm sorry the what build? Did I just hear "The Megaman Build"?
Have a few pieces of ASUS in my setup, but when replacement time comes, they won't be.
I guess my go-to brands will be MSI and Gigabyte for now.
Seeing how Asus has been treating their customers and a video like this... I was looking to upgrade my PC and will need a new mobo, will definitely be counting out anything Asus... Sad, since I had an Asus Crosshair III Formula hanging on my wall from my first PC build.
We'll see how long this lasts, look at nord vpn that shit was "forgotten" about then people using them as sponsors again. also bet everyone still covers/buys the ROG Ally no?
Thank you for speaking out against your benefactors!  Quite pathetic that vendors in 2023 cannot even appease their influencers!
If u want to get rid of some asus stuff , send it my way :D But on the other note i had many asus things and never faced an issue
Glad I decided to go with the steam deck instead of the ROG ally.
If you are going to be fair to AMD, change the motherboard in your right and see if it improves the rig. You have been very negative toward AMD and if it isn't actually the CPU, its fair to figure that out before you go to Intel. To anyone drawing the fanboy card, personally, I don't care what brand people use. I use both. I don't have a love toward one or the other.  Very sad to see ASUS go this way though. I've not always bought it because of the price and what you actually get, but thats the brand I always look at first. My 3 last motherboards have been MSI though, since I feel I get more for my money with them. That I have MSI GPU is random though. In 2021 I just had to take what I could get. Wasn't even after a 3090, but a 3080. Only thing that I was fast enough to click buy on was the MSI 3090 Suprim X. Stupid price and not really worth it (especially since I took off that expensive cooler to make it water cooled)
I had ASUS Motherboards selected for mine and my son’s builds we were doing this summer.  Not anymore….
This video is very discouraging, I've enjoyed my ROG Phone's and motherboards, and I expected my next video card would be one of theirs. After EVGA dropping out of the video card business, and now this, who can we get good stuff from?  Also the Freedom Of Information Act, or FOIA, is a US Government thing. It has no jurisdiction, impact, or reasoning to involve a corporation. You can't submit a FOIA request to a private or public company and expect them to all of a sudden be revealing their trade secrets. That's just the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Next thing you'll hear is them denying FOIA requests because of HIPAA for fucks sake.
On the one hand, Good of you to drop them for not delivering what they preach. But on the other hand, they fuck up and you drop them, but then tbf... as you said, their Quality has been going down and they did send you multiple boards that weren't good.  Personally, I always avoided ASUS to begin with. Had a ASUS Laptop. after some years it gave up. The Motherboard was done, ASUS didn't want to send me a new board. and they'd look at it for €90, but no guaranties that they'd be able to fix it and I'd still have to pay for the actual repair if they could. Think the laptop was about 5 years old at that point, so I get that it's out of warranty. but you can't charge that much just to see it.  Used AsRock as my first MB, was great. Got an X570 Aqua, had some RGB Issues with it. Contacted AsRock, they told me to bring it back to where i bought it. RMA'd it, they got notified it was coming back to them, and they told me. Kept me up to date eventhough the webshop i bought it from returned it. Told me what was wrong and even gave me the most recent BIOS while they were in there. Fixed.  Few weeks back, built a system for a Customer, AsRock MB didn't show the Kingston NV2. Sent them an email. got a call the next day from AsRock with what was going on. CS is pretty good imo. ASUS can learn something from them.
I had to do a RMA on my ASUS VivoBook laptop for a dead M.2 SSD. They returned the laptop to me with 2 dead USB ports, cracked case by the ports and it constantly overheats with a full load on the CPU. They wanted to charge me to do another RMA to fix their damage to the laptop when it was under warranty. I'll never buy another ASUS product EVER.
Massive respect to you for doing this
Interesting. I was running a Maximus VIII Extreme and i7-6700k for a couple years, and was having the weirdest issues (random BSODs, audio and video glitches similar to what you described) right up until either the mobo or CPU died, my only clue being that it completely refused to boot out of bios... any attempt to leave bios would just turn into a crash loop. I couldn't find any info or tips or anything hopeful, but I wonder if my overclocking plus the ASUS issues nuked my chip or something in the mobo itself.
Is gigabyte worth looking at? It was a hard choice if I was gonna get that Asus DTX x570 board over a Gigabyte one. The price was the deciding factor in the end. But my gigabyte boards been fantastic, apart from me not liking their bios. And the m.2 cooling solution is a bit... shit.
Just bout a Asus X670 wifi board it is a prime board. But it came and there were bent pins on the cpu socket. I dont know if this was done by the manufacturer or buy the ibuypower tech, I ended up regretting buying prebuild. They rteplaced the motherboard but for peace of mind I just right the whole comp apart and rebuild it myself with a new case and modular psu. I went through 2 boards before I got a good one .....
I got myself a Taichi for the first gen Ryzen 5 with 1080Ti only because it was known to have less bloat than all the other motherboards (at least back then). I had to tweak settings in bios once and after that it just worked and still works. In my personal experience Asrock is the most stable mobo I have ever had.
This is a nuts video, I've been an ASUS fanboi for YEARS now, thousands of dollars to them. I guess I gotta find a new brand to talk up, hopefully more motherboard makers will put a fan curve control based on t_sensors in their BIOS!
I agree sooo much, it's crazy that Jay needed to do this video.
Now that is a brilliant review! Thanks and I look forward to more.
My rog x470F has been flawless since I bought it open box. Seems like asus really dropped the ball.
Asus, you just lost a customer
I had nothing but problems with my viii hero. Thought it was everything but the board. It's so bad I have to run my m.2 boot drive off a PCI adapter. Constant BSOD. It was unusable for months. I replaced every component except this overpriced garbage. Juuuuuust outside the RMA period.  Replacing with an MSI Tomahawk. Never, ever buying Asus anything ever again.
RMAs should not be in the same building as new product. Thanks for fighting for the little guy.
glad i got my PC 6 years ago but also sad because i might never be able to upgrade it with skyrocketing prices and quality fucking off to oblivion...
Not sure if this is right but were Asrock  part of Asus back in the day?
I am totally with you, I lost all respect for Asus two years ago and swore off them after they refused warranty on two motherboards of mine in a row.  First one they claimed had socket damage which turned out to be (I guess during cpu removal for the rma) a small chunk of dried thermal grease had fallen on the socket and they claimed that voided the warranty and sent it back after making me pay to ship it.  I literally blew it off with a can of air when it got back it was so small.  Wrote it off as my fault and bought a replacement newer version of the same board and that one failed for a similar reason (would not detect a GPU).  Tried 3 different GPU's that worked in my other machine and even a different CPU that was working in another rig and still nothing worked (Even tested memory swap).  They refused my RMA again but this time saying that the issue was user caused and sending it back.  I argued with them trying to figure out what they meant and they claimed that's all they could tell me but that it would not be covered and I could pay to repair it (Which was the cost of the board).  Went to MSI and have not had any issues since.
MSI or Gigabyte it is then ... Lol
glad you come out with this info, now i know for facts i wont be going asus at all next build. ive had my doubts with asus since my i9 10900k went bad and im glad i stuck to MSI and chose msi, always loved MSI, also : in the video you posted about the megaman buikd, the dragon do light up and leave it alone, i love it! haha (meant as a joke since im a huge fan of dragons)
Appraciate what you do Jay! So... I'm gonna have to learn how to handle the bios of another company!
I just realized recently through a RMA how Asus is terrible in handling issues. For the first time I had to open an out of warranty RMA with a £4000 desktop-replacement laptop (Asus Chimera) and from a faulty screen replacement of £350 they ended up breaking the motherboard in the process, sending a second quote with an additional £2300. Still waiting after several month an answer from the escalation team. I'm not sure in the US, but in the UK if you buy something from Asus and you'll get faulty, will be better to bin it.
This is cray-z
I've built 4 pcs since Z390, all intel. First two were MSI builds. MSI has some shady marketing practices, but the systems ran well. The Z690 and Z790 halo tier builds constantly have issues, all ASUS. Never building another ASUS system.
ASUS screwed me over with a "brand new tower" that was refurbished, and filled with garbage hardware in 2021.    ASUS sent me a rig with an 8gb and 4gb ram stick setup.   Yes...   a computer company sent me 2 un-matching cards that bogged my computer right down.   They lied about a charging bay on the top of the tower, and gave me a bloody 1650gtx console card.  A half card.  For $1469 I am hella pissed.  I go to Costco and see new towers with 3060's in them, 32gb ram with an I9 core for between$1100-$1300.   The "chip shortage" was pure garbage, and just ANOTHER way for the computer industry to corner the market and syphon the wallets with "lack of product". I am glad to see the beginning of the fall of totally unchecked consumerism.   I am glad to see this predator company at the forefront.
Had a similar problem with Gigabyte went through three boards before purchasing from msi
another wannabe want to do "content"
Welp. Asus is out of the picture for my future builds.
Anyone notice 12 hours after Gamer Nexus busted Asus in the face they announce the new “handheld” lol  Almost like they are terrified
Can attest to a personal problem. I have a Asus tuf b650 motherboard, and i cant enable an expo rated Corsair ram to 6000. It creates too much instability, i cant even do it at 5600. Sure, its not on qvl list, but their qvl list is like 20 different ram models (if you know anything about those, there're hundreds of different rams, each variation in spec counts as different ram.) Meanwhile people activate their non-qvl rams all the time usually without problems. I couldnt figure out if it was ram or motherboard, since cpu seemed to support much higher frequencies and timings from overclock videos ive seen. I guess i figured that one out.
I haven't been a fan of ASUS for over a decade.  Over priced and under supported.  I couldn't imagine how bad it is now.
I’ve always stuck with asus since my first rig, but seeing all of this happen makes me wish I could switch it all out for EVGA😭 now I’m stuck with MSI😥
I have the z790E should I be worried ?
Thank god i never buy asus stuff
I’ve been having problems with asus boards since the z170 and i just cut asus from my builds altogether then my friend build a 7950x recently he chose a asus board and of course it’s super unstable
Cancel culture example here - I'm surprised that you fell into the pit being as old as you are . Steve was in diapers when I started building computers and anyone who has been around knows you take chances when overclocking . They made it too easy for newbies to overclock  . I can't even count the ram sticks I have fried over the years by overclocking systems . I have tried all of the motherboard manufacturers and have always come back to Asus . They are the best around and are really good at what they do . Good luck to the viewers who switch it up and go with a different brand !!
Been an Asus fanboy for 15 years. Was going to build a white Ryzen 7950x3d rig with the Asus white strix mobo, white asus strix 4080, white RAM, white AIO etc. Sadly through no fault of AMD, think I'll be switching to a white/silver Gigabite Intel 13900k build instead.
Thank you, I am cussing ever having bought an Asus Z790 Hero.  The Bios is the slowest loading I have ever had, almost two mins before it starts to load Windows, (latest Bios) All we need now is you to recommend  the best board.
my x570 crosshair hero makes my 5950x and my 3700x run at over 1.4v if i keep in on auto. i have to manually set to 1.25
The problem is that it's the only Mini-itx AM5 with "decent" price, at least here. Should I be worried and avoid it?
Old Asus slogan: "Rock solid. Heart touching. Really is a thing of the past.
Id remember when Asus had ALOT of issues with thire Routers back in 2013-2014 , for nearly one month , the issue was firmware update gone through the roof ,bricked routers when people like change settings in the the interface example Upnp or NAT or just did update firmware and Asus did send out new firmware 6 or 8 times if i remember right ,since that i have stop recommend Asus router.  And i have nerly stop recommend other Asus products aswell due to now days less premium quality, few years ago they had better , now days it have gone straight down.
Really awesome integrity I love it
100% support your choices here. You're doing the right thing.
Gamers Nexus video and this one have cost ASUS a ROG Ally sale from me.   I just put together a new build with a Strix X670E-E and a 7800X3D so this hostile anti-consumer behavior from ASUS affects me directly.
I've been having a lot of the same issues like during your stream and I have a Gigabyte X570 Master with a 5950x.  Random settings changing along with missing audio/video.  hmmm
I also made some bad experiences with ASUS, this brand is imo absolutely overrated
Omg 😰 the beta bios update that also voids your warranty wtf Asus? All of these boards should just be available to ship back and get full refunds or replacements that fix the issue for free!!!  I have always liked asus in the past when I used their products more. But I will say the last laptop I got from them in 2021ish was a real let down. The way they sort of hid the fact they that it was a proper 3070 gaming laptop but it comes with a underpowered 11375h I believe I don’t remember the exact chip but the only way to realize how underpowered the CPU was is if you watch like hundreds of reviews and things online and see how underpowered it is for things and it really holds the laptop back for things like video editing and other stuff. Not to mention one of the x2 8gb sticks of ram was soldered. When I replaced the non-soldered one with an identical 16gb stick the laptop blue-screened and was not stable! Why even have the one soldered if I can’t actually upgrade it?   Anyway that laptop was like $1899 or more at the time and was neat in terms of the size and style with it being white and all. But over all I sold it a few months later. This CPU was more well suited for like a 1660 or something in my opinion and yes it did fine for gaming but got many less frames than some other 3070 laptops and simply just didn’t explain or mention these things in the marketing. You had to find reviews or someone tearing it down online to even see the single RAM slot or know about the fact that the CPU was more of a low profile CPU   This on the other hand is just horrible for a company. Like this almost feels like they did it because someone in the company said 🤔🤔 you know what we could save money by not RMA’ing all these boards if we put out a beta bios because then the failures wouldn’t be covered under warranty 😳 Asus why? 😭
I almost pre-ordered the RoG Ally yesterday but then saw this and didn't go through with it. I can't support a company that does stuff like this.
13:55 I don't know much about building computers and stuff, but even I know "ASRock is more reliable than Asus now" is a "holy ####" statement.  How the mighty has fallen.
I told u  a few videos before that ASUS is a shitcompany...I have a TUF Gaming B550E cauz my Gigabyte mobo are died...cauz of my stupidity and some misinformation. I sent it back to the shop and they told me I can choose another mobo cauz it`s dead...but it was around the Pandemic...little bit after...so not too much choices I had, I wanted a Gigabyte Aurous Elite but it was not in stock just this ASUS. I regret the moment when I choose this...MSI could be better...or even Asrock...USB instabilities Audio is a crap...I will get rid of when I`ll have money for new parts but  right now I stuck with this. I`m also in the computer industry in almost 25 years and my experiences with ASUS was not trustworthy. Of course every company have issues time to time but the ASUS is an awarded s*ithole for me...I gave a chance to them with my mobo but I regret it everyday.
It's not X3D only. My 7950X with Asus x670e-e and 6000 DDR5 has a lot of the same problems. Mostly RAM instabilities. Today I had to clear CMOS and running my DDR5 at 3600 mhz because it would'nt boot otherwise. Sometimes EXPO works sometimes it doesnt. Running 4 sticks of RAM is like throwing a dice every boot. Asus softwares has a lot of issues, ...
Well Asus is off the shopping list now Thanks Jay for the Info. Stay strong man
Asus was my usual go to for Mobos.... guess not so much anymore.
ASUS official eBay store hooked me up with a refurbished 3070 for only $350 LAST YEAR.. I’ll stick by them until they screw me over!
I don't think Jay is gonna miss a meal...
Wow. After 17 years with Asus, after this video i realy consider switching my beloved laptop brand with a other one. 😢
Sadly, Asus doesn't care.  They made $17 billion in profits in 2022.  Props to Jay for doing the right thing here.
You've tricked thousands of people into Asus products, knowing of their faults and bad support and still advertising them as the non plus ultra until today. Showing us three faulty Asus Boards you've received in the last couple of month, you've never talked about until today. And now you're acting like the savior who warns us from using Asus, trying to catch even more clicks from the Asus debacle you already know of for a long time. Really disgusting behaviour. Thank you for being bought.
Agreed!
I have a ryzen 5 3600 and a strix b450-f mobo, and i have to restart the system every day after first boot, otherwise it doesn't see the sound card at all. And the system sometimes just hangs (kinda freezes, but you can still move the cursor, but nothing works). I was thinking the cpu has a bad silicon (bought it new), but kinda second guessing now.... geez
Congratulations, Jay, for your unwavering honesty and steadfast support of consumers in the face of ASUS's declining conduct over the years. Your commitment to transparency and advocating for the rights of consumers is commendable. It takes courage to speak out against a company's questionable practices, and your actions serve as an inspiration to others. Your dedication to holding ASUS accountable and demanding better standards is making a real difference. Keep up the excellent work, and may your efforts continue to empower consumers and foster positive change in the industry.
Funny, yesterday I thought: "All three motherboards are now from Asus, and that makes me happy." Good for me, but that sort of behaviour from any company is a huge red flag saying that the leadership has no interest in customers.
Solid asrock here and I love it no problem at all ❤.
Mad respect.
I've had several problems with an Asus motherboards back in the Athlon 64 days and had been steering clear of them until recently. I had bought a 5800x and went with my usual brand of Gigabyte and was going though a little RMA hell so in the mean time I decided, what the hell, I'll give Asus a try again.... it's been 15 years lol. That was the wrong decision.... after like 2 months I started having USB controller issues with the board. RMAed it after some back and forth with Asus via email they finally decided to fix it but by this time I'd had it with them. So I'm like F%^& it. I dropped the entire platform and replaced it with an 12700KF and a Gigabyte Z690 AORUS. That was the right decision. It's been 11 months with it on pretty much 24 hrs a day and I've had 0 issues with it. I'm done experimenting with AMD for now, everytime I've tried AMD I've gotten burned.
I was actually considering getting a  X570 dark hero.. Keeping my X570 Aorus Master for sure! 🙄
RIP Asus
HI Guys, Wow., Hopefully EVGA will help you with Supply of Quality Motherboards 👍👍
Great, X670E Hero and 4090 tuf wc'd here and everything working as of today.  So much for paying the Asus tax for better quality.
Jay, I want to upgrade, i already using Gigabyte Z170 Gaming G1 with 7700k, Corsair Vengence 3200Mhz Ram, EVGA 1080TI... im waiting for intel 14gen CPUS, before i do a full system upgrade. The gigabyte board i have is solid as f***, what brand still holds up for highend montherboards... at present im using 1440p 180Ghz Gsync Asus republic full ultra wide.. im so scared...
I have an asus laptop that is 12 years old and still works great . Second battery that’s it. I know asus will get over this
Also asus laptops seems to fail frequently in my opinion.
I was putting together a new 7800X3D build but had been waiting on the BIOS updates before ordering anything but.... now I guess I should consider a different vendor for my mobo. It's funny because my last 3 or 4 systems were built off an ASUS mobo and never had issues but my current system is already 5+ years old (Ryzen 1600). I suppose it came from when Asus was still solid.   I had originally selected Asus ROG STRIX B650E-F GAMING WIFI... anyone have suggestions for an equivalent model from another vendor?
I've always had a great MSi board for my 4790K. In February for my 7950X3D I wanted a white build and went for an ASUS board. I wish tech creators where a little bit more open about their experiences with the companies before shit hit the fan. I wouldn't have bought an Asus board and would be feeling less stressed about it possibly failing on me.
I have the ASRock x570 Taichi. It's absolutely rock solid. I've never had a single issue in 2 years. No blue screens. No random crashes. It just freaking works. I bought it for the aestetic. I will probably buy them for my next build. I've lost track of the number of ASUS boards I've used in my life. It's a lot. ALL of my builds dating back to the 90s were ASUS. They have been great boards. But yeah.......no, not happening. ASRock for the win from now on.
cant wait for the lawsuits against ASUS
Ive had good experiences with ASUS back in the day, sad to hear that theyve gone down hill. I have 4 asus zenwatches that are still rockin it today. (Screens arent in good condition, but the watch itself is still very usable and nice! I have replacement screens but havent bothered to install them yet)
Have all the issues been on the X series boards and not the B?
I have the x670e-i and 7800x3d. So is it safe if I don't overclock. My PC sometimes doesn't boot up. One time the sound also stopped in a game. If I return the board, my windows license will be gone. And every time I update windows the reboot always hangs until I reset again.
The example of ASUS RMA boards being sent as a replacement got me into a conflict with the reseller and its supplier as well- who ALSO claimed it to be a new board. While I have  pictures as prove of what can be seen even better by the naked eye to any fool. I demanded back my original board, rather than keeping a seriously insulting replacement board. If already, because my original one looks more sterile than the replacement they sent.The guts to even try, it even had worn connectors and bended pins. And a completely worn box, that they called shelf damage. And fyi, my original board supposedly had burned (BIOS) chips too, that were repaired by ASUS earlier already under warranty (I mean BIOS, maybe, but really?).  Whatever is going on, there are definitely some things wrong...I'm still not convinced with it's working (X570 C8F, a high-end board for F-sake), if it weren't for also the known problems with Samsung's 980 Pro SSDs additionally, causing random crashes when gaming (the known controller and power state problem). Those latest firmware updates don't fix it either, nor do they reimburse or accept more RMAs , within warranty though. (it's all over the net) So, if anything, please nominate Samsung next, in case u didn't already :) Am a fan of your vids, keep doing what u do and spread that message...We pay them for reliable products and good service, their right to exist for all I care, or 'never' again.
2 words...  Armoury Crate.
Have you given Asrock any run Jay? I've had nothing but good experiences with them so far.
I dropped Asus when their mbd refused to boot with DDR2 RAM that wasn't on their "approved vendors" list. For the most part, I've been using Gigabyte and ASRock mbds since and never had a problem - MY build, MY wallet... who the fk are you to tell me what manufacturers I can use?!? The RAM was specced in line with their advertised parameters but simply not on their "approved vendors" list. Several years later I bought a STRIX vid card, had to return it for coil whine but aside from that, I've never purchased another Asus product.
Sucks that Asus sucks ass now. I've had the mobas since my first Ryzen(2600x) and now 5800x. Guess I won't be using them anymore when eventually upgrade to am5
1:14 Keep your STUFF
Huge HUGE respect here, Jay.  I am in the exact position you pictured. I have Asus GPU and mb in my system, it's an 7700X and I already flashed the bios. I know it's unlikely but I am so scared the thing blows up because I can not afford to build it again.  Regardless if I come out of this with an ok system or not, I will not buy Asus again.
I just bought a new 2022 G14...
I'm still using my, now very old, Sabertooth 990 mobo because my Ryzen upgrade board turned it's toes up literally 2 weeks after the warranty expired...... it's still sat in it's box while I hunt for someone to repair it. Meanwhile, my Sabertooth and FX cpu just keeps going, no overclock just running stock and it just keeps on going. Hearing all this new info from yourself I'm wondering whether it's better just to get a mobo that's much better built?.  Big respect to you Jay for addressing this
wow props! all that poteintal and willing to go to bat for the end user to force changes.
ASUS NO MORE!
i have not purchased Asus products in over 10 years so I feel great about my switch to Logitech and Corsair
Lol my asus hero vii just died without warning compelaeate dead without single led turning up, it just died realy badly
As someone who owns a Zephryus M16 2022, multiple ASUS motherboards, and other ASUS products. This completely breaks my hearts. I am going to start looking into another route. I am sad to leave ASUS but hopefully this helps light a fire
Lol you had typical amd problems while on twitch lol, all amd all generations are the problems, and its just problems, go for intel and its just peace
Thanks Jay! This reminded me to look for solutions for the USB port issues I'm having on my ASUS TUF Z690 - Plus, similar to the issues you were having, and sure enough they're common.
That's the typical business cycle these days.  Build up a brand to the point you can overcharge for it, cut costs by lowering build quality and QA, and sell for ridiculous prices until you get caught.  The next step is to hire a PR firm to fix your bad public image, then start the cycle over again.  Fortunately the technology market surrounding motherboards is far less forgiving, and it will take a lot more that a slick PR firm to fix their image at this point, but I can't wait to see them try.
As a consumer that always bought ASUS products, I had really bad experience with RMA's. The last one was about my 3090 strix card, 3 years warranty ( I had 1,5 years left). It ended up with contacting my lawyer and a lot of e-mails with Asus. This was so a shock for me that I will NEVER buy a ASUS product ever again. The videocards nowdays cost a lot of money, but if I can't trust on my warranty anymore it's not worth buying from this company.
The really crappy thing Asus is doing that nobody mentioned is presenting the Beta firmware as the primary option, and hiding the production builds. I'm not sure if this is true for all boards, but it's absolutely true for my ROG STRIX B650E-E. I updated to 1413 because it was the latest production build.
i'm sticking with asus, you guys will see they will do better.
lol stop using ASUS 5 years ago after Multiple DOA boards all ROG btw!! so your late Jay!
I have an Asus phone and love the hardware but they won't do Android updates on them, they only release new phones. It has caused me to recently switch. This video makes me feel better about my choice.
1:13 "Hey keep your sh*t.. (Stuff in a different voice)". LOL
Sad to hear this, ive had some trouble with ROG Maximus XIII Hero but never anything like this
Kudos to you Jay, most will not realise how much this will hurt your team in sponsorship etc for sticking to your principles and channel vibe. Asus have also lost myself as a ROG strix range customer for the same issues on the X series AMD mobos. gigabyte or MSI im a coming back! lol btw youtube ad break was timed perfectly when you said my live stream started and this happened...up popped 2 ads lol me > huh wtf! ahhh doh! lolol dont you think its hilarious and ironic that ASRock getting more praise than ASUS teehee (us old enough realise ASROCK was asus owned once upon a time) bet all at ASRock are glad they got sold on years ago :) asus software for example, to run aitune II in windows you have to disable memory integration in your security, uninstalled!
I've had issues with ASUS motherboards and sent out for repair only to be blamed for worse damage that I didn't even cause and had to threaten going to the BBB on MULTIPLE occasions to be treated fairly as their customer.
This is really disappointing. I have an ASUS TUF Gaming Laptop. Barely over a year old and now every couple of weeks the Nvidia GPU doesn't get picked up and it just runs through the onboard Ryzen for graphics. Then I reset the laptop and the GPU works again. Might not be related, but kind of feels like it happens every time the ASUS Software on my laptop forces an update on me.
If politics would have people like this maybe the world wouldn't be such a shithole.
Love this!
Just built a new computer last year. I was wondering if I should wait for the new AMD and ASUS stuff or go with the AMD 5000 series...... I'm glad I stuck with the old stuff with how much issue that goes on. I used to love ASUS brand too so I would've become one those that got screwed over. Scary.....
I probably have the last good gen ASUS mobos - (ROG S Z370-E). I got for my i7-8700k and has been runing like a charm.  The only issue I ever had was with the internal RAID controller , selecting the wrong raid level for some reason. Thanfully I had backup on the config so I got restored pretty quickly ,but that was it for the years of severice.
honestly, ive been having a ton of memory problems with my wifes computer that i built ive genuinely been feeling kinda bad about myself thinking im just stupid, i told myself there is no way its the motherboard something about my cpu ram or software is fucking me up, after this video i just put my gigabyte motherboard in her computer now now its fine, it was fucking asus, god thank you so much jay!!
I am watching this video just after my "asus rog maximus Z790 hero" motherboard order. :S
Bye Asus!   WiFi and Bluetooth often don't work on my Asus MoBo because something with static build up. I often have to reboot with full power cut to fix it.   Hope they get a class action lawsuit.
This is really not good for Asus.  Jay, can you update us if you decide that Asus has improved and corrected these issues?
Been an ROG fan for 3-4 years. After hearing all this id like to know what other people would he switch to as previous ROG fans
Never owned any asus products and was just looking into there roc ally. If this is the review of the company then im out.
Upgraded to an Asus X670E board after an Aorus x570 Board. The X570 Aorus Master was feeding too much voltage into the cpus and killing them, now having insane ram instability issues with the Strix X670E board, as well as times when the pcu gets stuck in memory training or just straight up turns itself off, some safety shutdown trigger while posting.  Good times. :D
While you may have said that they don't care, I'm betting they will as this news gets around more and hits them in their bottom line as people simply stop buying their products. Negative press *always* has more impact than positive so they're likely to feel this one. Kudos for sticking to your guns and refusing to have anything further to do with them.
You children are acting like it was never 2009.  Do you remember the TSUNAMI of catastrophic component and part failures with ZERO support during that recession?  The good news is, PC parts are about to be bewilderingly cheap. The bad news is, OEMs are scrambling to cut costs and it is affecting quality and support.   Grow up.
at last we can see some builds or parts by other brands like Asrock Biostar etc.
Guess I’ll go MSI for my 7800x3d.
it's a well choosen " excuse " to harm Asus in favor of other " American " brands like EVGA and of course the head of this plan " AMD "
Big fan of white components, so i spent months trying to get my hands on the apex 790 maximus and they were just out of stock, so i completely scrapped my entire build idea and am just gonna run a dual m-itx board that isn't color specific.  honestly disappointed and been a huge list of asus products i've been using for the past 10 years.
We are fast running out of companies to buy product from.    Pretty soon the enthusiast PC market is going to be a thing of the past if this keeps going the way it is.
What would they have said if you werent a youtuber though?!  I was thinking of making my next system a one-brand system, and since Asus seems to be big with gaming, I was gonna go Asus. Guess I wont be now.
That board being RMA’d and resold is no mistake. Origin does the same with returned computers and parts and you shouldn’t do business with them either.
Sad moment for PC building, been using Asus mobos exclusively for the last 20 years, still rocking an Asus Apex on my 7700k :/. Asus Apex mothers are peak design imo, just pure performance, extra features be damned.
Yeah, fits. And maybe been going on for a long time. I bought a used PC with a 7th gen Intel Asus ROG Strix Z270E that under its auto-OC mode with an i7 CPU had one of the VRM electrolytic caps literally detonate and fly off the board and across the inside of the machine. The board and CPU still work as it had a overbuilt supply but now running stock settings as the board can't be trusted. Another machine with a Asus Prime H310-Plus R2.0 board refused to recognise the second RAM stick of a Corsair 32GB RAM kit until I changed the CPU. Luckily, I was also upgrading the i3-9100F to a i9-9900K which prodded the BIOS into working to detect the second RAM stick, but I had wanted to test the RAM before changing the CPU. I was like, How can you not recognise RAM in the second slot, Asus? Why? Bad software is the answer.
I have a somewhat new AM5 build, i'm really thinking about this is a bad choice, I have been Pro-Asus for many years...but now...I'm not so sure...started with the latest BIOS I had for my Threadripper ...that suddenly "lost" harddrives.....and over time god worse and worse....maaaaan...did Asus ruin my Threadripper and I only thought it was wear and tear????
I was about to get a ASUS mobo with the 7800x3d, thanks for this info. I’ll wait.
And I bought a fairly expensive AM5 board just before all this came to light.  Sigh...   No more Asus for me.  Also, kudos Jay on the move, Asus is probably a pretty big sponsor.
So because AMD products pretty much ALWAYS have some kind of issues, it's now the manufacture's fault for not being able to keep AMD's products from not performing correctly? Maybe AMD should make products that don't need to be babied just to work.
Just recently built new PCs for myself and the wife and went with MSI for literally the first time ever after doing nothing but Asus since 2003. Glad I did!
The problem has been around for awhile now, customers are the manufacturers/developers QA testers.
after watching all the broken asus laptops on northridgefix I knew way before this that asus was on the spiral downward
I've had a problems with asus products. Support feels like a run around. The last motherboard i can put my head on a block for which i owned, was the sabertooth amd fx motherboards. After that, i felt like i didn't get the same quality.
i always prefered asus bc of their simple way to develop the bios, but seems that next mobo won't be this brand then
you could say dealings with ASUS were TUF love
Sad to see that you "lost" a sponsor, but it is more sad that ASUS drags AMD down with it. I switched to AMD when Ryzen came out, but with MSI, which is not known for high quality, but I had no problems whatsoever. Crazy to see that the brand I could'nt afford but wanted turns out to be a bad one now. So two brands are out for me now. Gigabyte let me down, ASUS is also not good anymore. What comes next? Nvidia releasing a power connector that burns up? Oh wait...
I know I subscribed to your channel all them years ago for a reason. Thank you for all you do for us consumers!! It takes people like you to call them out before any real change will happen. Again thank you! Will always be here to help support you!
great video
good to know, I've used to the quality of ASUS but not anymore
I was just about to build a 670-E motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D uhg. Now what?
I remeber back when i had a b450 motherboard and that was the only board I ever got a bluescreen on. I didn't think anything of it because it never did it again but thankfully I don't have anything Asus on my build now because of it's price.
How can we take you seriously when you wouldnt even adress the LTT warranty issue and your buddy mocking the consumers?
Auss maximus hero 7 years ago is also crap, and i just went for msi now
It’s funny, your entire video about how terrible ASUS is, you could literally replace ASUS with *Nvidia GPUs* and it would be the same video lol. Both companies don’t care about the consumer whatsoever.
EVGA need to step up and start making more verity of motherboard. I love the design of the high end ASUS boards and currently have a X570 Crosshair 8 Hero with zero issues 24/7 stable but this makes me think twice about buying another ASUS board.
Sadness
Hey Jay, great video. Could you maybe do a tier-list style video series for brands for the most common components? I think a lot of people could benefit from this when planning new builds.
ASUS RMA can be summed up like this:   Customer: "Hey you sent me a laptop that worked for an hour then turned into a paper weight"  ASUS: "Thanks for picking ASUS. Go F$@! Yourself"
Now I have to wonder if my white ASUS board from 3 years ago fried the cpu I put into it.  switched to an MSI board and bought a new cpu and had no issues.
Just _a-SUS_ company making SUS products.
Bought Asus B550 motherboard twice and returned them both becouse the cpu didnt sit well in the socket and their prices are high for no reason .
took me 3 motherboards to complete my build also, first two mb's had bent pins. This was from Amazon.
OMFG, dealing with Asus drama right now, first b650 never even posted so returned it, second one ever since I had it, blue screening and shutdowns, even after bios and driver updates, so after troubleshooting everything twice and some expense and my time and others time determined it was the board. Started an RMA with Asus, they got the board two days later then it sat in limbo almost three weeks because they didn't know where it was.  They diagnose the board, say it's fine, and send it back missing the m2-3 heatsink cover and with oily residue all over it. I email them and they tell me to clean it and they will TRY to find the heatsink cover, then multiple emails go unanswered so I call, and tell them I want another board because of so many missteps and oily residue by the on the board including by the sensitive memory  that I want another board, that flatly refuse, and say that the board is good per their tech(the guy that forgot to send back parts,and left oily residue on it)and they consider the matter closed. I called again and talked to ASus instead of listening to cool 90s rock and rap in the drive home and the rep gave me excuse no apologies and said there was nothing he could do despite their missteps. NEVER ASUS again, and I'm a rog strix mark, but went ahead and ordered a aorus x67O with a $56 off coupon to replace my b650 but going to keep fighting to get another board
So...who is the go to brand now...
Hi guys! Last year I built a rig for my brother R9 5900x with Asus TUF Gaming B550-Plus Wi-Fi by default came with 32gb RAM DDR4 now he replaced that Ram with 128gb of RAM DDR4 3600MHz – no issue – its running great with the latest BIOS update. Super happy my brother. A week back I built for myself a brand-new computer using an ASUS motherboard on the new platform AM5 – I used same TUF motherboard but on AM5 – Asus TUF Gaming B650-PLUS Wi-Fi paired with a R7 7700x, updated the BIOS (not a beta version). It’s running okay now.  Strangely it takes over 40 seconds to load WINS compared with my older build.   What is weird also, on the ASUS web site for this motherboard (ASUS TUF B650 xxxx) there are 2 beta versions of BIOS. The latest 2 updates are BETA.  Hopping Asus will fix the problems – it's still a good brand with a good RMA.
We care and thanks sir.
AsRock is owned by Asus, what an......
tldr whaaaaaaaaaaa, aa, a, a, a
as disappointing as this is, I'm not even sure who to pick now. MSi has been an awful experience. Can gigabyte be trusted to build a motherboard? EVGA doesn't do AMD. Am I supposed to trust asrock by process of elimination?
I watched all of Steve's videos as well. this is sad because my next build i was aiming for TUF products. Hopefully ASUS realizes how poor of a company they are and some internal reorganization happens.
As someone who is middle age with disposable income I guess that makes me the demographic for the higher end hardware. After the GN and J2C reviews you can bet that ASUS is now off my PCPARTPICKER build sheet. For me it isn't about "There is a problem.." its more about the "Download this BIOS but if it breaks your stuff too bad you voided your warranty". I have zero qualms about changing brands due to a company treating me like they are doing me a favour with their product. So the Asus X670E is off the list and now I'm looking at either the MSI MPG (like you are using for Mega Man build) or an ASRock. I'm still deciding LOL
Also, so ASUS had the hardware on the boards to prevent this from happening but was either to lazy to integrate it, too stupid to integrate it, just plain didn't do it to save money and advertised that protections were in place.  Un-F'n-Real
Probably other brands when you're not updating their bios: haha you're losing some performance/stability of your PC Asus: haha you're losing your PC
Makes me think of EVGA telling Nvidia off.
Jay, a few years back I had a Asus rampage IV Black edition AND IT WENT OUT LESS THAN 1 MONTH after the warranty expired, and instead of giving me a somewhat decent deal to have it repaired, they wanted to charge me $349 to look at it. I talked to their managers and basically they belittled me over the phone and I quit using their products and I returned the brand new Asus 1080 t.i. stricks edition that I had just purchased from Newegg and completely blocked everything by Asus. It's about time they received their own due punishment.
The frustrating part is Asus had a good rep so I went for a TUF A15 as a transportable termporary desktop replacement. And on top of this thing with their motherboard BIOS I've been having crashes and radnom errors after the BIOS update last week. And to think  one of the selling points was that Armory Crate has the most control features (next to MSI Bios and Alienware's CPU temp target adjustment being easier to access) but without the downsides like software (in the case of Aw/Dell, Corsair on Lenovo, etc) or hardware/afters sales support (as people complain against Gigabyte for) or HP just not really being there yet in terms of gaming laptops. Since the BIOS update last weekend I've been getting random crashes - etiher Armory Crate or the whole laptop just dying while on sleep mode  that when I power it back on it reboots from an off state (and usually I have to hold the power button to even get it to do that as opposed to not doing anything). No it wasn't unplugged, so when I woke it up the battery was still at 60%.
A three mil youtuber dropping ASUS demands huge respect. Thats integrity as it should be, wowie. :o Great job, looking forward to what comes out from all of this.
Asrock is more stable than Asus
Big call mate. Total respect. 👍🇭🇲
Instead of the Asus rog ally I am gonna save up for the gpd win max 2 with 64gb ram, AMD Radeon 780m, and PC 7840U. It's basically a laptop with controller buttons. It also includes an option to add 4g data. They also add two additional sdd slots. So u can add up to 8t. After that if u want more storage u can hockup a harddrive for even more storage. It's 1200 dollars.
Making me question my preorder of the Asus ROG Ally
I just installed a ryzen 7900x in a b-650e-f motherboard. I lowered the voltage to 1.3v, so far i havent noticed any issues but now after watching GAmersNexus and this video... im now in panic mode.
Integrity, accountability, consequences, honesty.  We need way more of these things today.   Bring back shame.  Shame on you ASUS.
10:00 Random Blue screen and a few other quirky things. Do you regularly check the Windows install. I have windows 11 on my previous gen build Desktop I put together a few months ago and Windows 10 pro on a Laptop. Each one is having the same issue. I run Chkdsk and after a few weeks errors appear but running Chkdsk /scan fixes that. Then run SFC /Scannow that's where the main issue is both the desktop and laptop this error keeps cropping up: "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log."   To fix that issue You need to go to C:Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log and delete that file (seems this file gets corrupted and might be the culprit. Microsoft is aware of this issue going on years now and haven't fixed it). Then run via again command prompt with admin: DISM /Online /Cleanup-image /StartComponentCleanup and then DISM /Online /Cleanup-image /RestoreHealth. This cleans everything up and the random Windows blue screen stops,  sluggishness and programs dropping until the errors start cropping up again.  Now this is on two separate devices from two different time periods. The desktop with the previous gen hardware and the laptop a bit older.  Other than that, both devices run fine. I know that Windows 11 is exactly the same kernel as Windows 10 but with a different gui and other tweaks. I found all those fixes due to the issues and finding errors.   BTW the desktop is: MSI MAG X570S Tomahawk WiFi Motherboard, AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-core, Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB DDR4 3200, Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB NVMe M.2 and MSI Gaming AMD Radeon RX 6600 128-bit 8GB GDDR6. The Laptop is an HP Silver Envy.
My home computer is super buggy. Asus motherboard. My work computer is rock solid. ASRock. My home proxmox server is super buggy and I can't use 4 sticks of memory, only 3. Asus. I've sworn off asus after my prox build but this just further cements it.
been a sad show from the outside looking in, I love my asus hero board... but I'm wayyyy back on z97/4th gen intel, and over the years it really has seemed like a slow fall from grace watching other people deal with them on newer and newer builds, right around 7th gen I'd say was their turning point between when people would say "ok mistakes happen" and  "come on ........really???" oh how the mighty fall
just AMD things tbh. I'm on an MSI X570 Tomahawk with a 5900X and basically from the beginning I had weird bluescreens and memory errors.  As it turns out it was caused by the RAM which was running at the advertised speeds and which is also supported (both the model of the RAM as well as the frequency) according to the manual. I had to manually underclock it to the next lower frequency and ever since then I haven't had a single bluescreen.
Jay, i want to say thank you for being so informative. Im working on my very first PC build and your channel has been amazing. Thank you for steering me clear of Asus qhen it came to my motherboard. I'm getting an MSI motherboard because of this. Love your channel, keep up the amazing work and thank you for guiding me through this process. You're an awesome teacher.
"As Rock" is growing on me. (not pun intended)
i have a b550 rog strix mobo  and an ryzen 7 5800x and now i have a feeling i wanna upgrade to asrock xD
Jayz thanks so much for this review I'm now building my new upgrade system and was searching for a good motherboard and was considering Asus as I usually do. Ialso saw Gigabite x670 Aorus Elite Ax and Master and even Msi was being highly recommended. After watching this review Asus is definitely of my list for motherboards. What would recommend as a great budget or even high end motherboard for the Ryzen 9 7900x? Also what PSU would you also recommend if I'm running g a RTX 4070 TI OC?
🖕🏼ASUS!!!🖕🏼
I have had an Asus motherboard for a while. Very flaky USB ports.
16:24 Put the fear of god even into me. I can't imagine ASUS hearing this.
Btw MSI drivers and bios are killing the b650m motherboard and they are censoring the posts. Already have 2 dead b650m motherboards sure to bios/driver updates
ASSUS
Put together a rog strix b550f system and booooyyyy if I have dealt with some weird issues, from things becoming sluggish, GPU sometimes not going over 60% utilization (same GPU for 8 years first time it happens), to their own audio drivers going crazy and bugging out windows or making my CPU ramp up for god knows why, the in game audio sometimes not even starting. I updated the bios and  it went from happening 3 times a week to maybe once a month but its fine as a 30 second restart solves it. I literally though that was because I got an AMD CPU but now I realize its been asus bs all along. Here I thought I was improving from going from Asrock to Asus... -.-
DANG!  I have been using ASUS motherboards for 2 and a half decades.  I few months ago I had to replace my mobo and CPU because of mobo issues.  I wish this video would have come out back then. 😒 I had been hearing about the AsRock stuff and avoided them.  After what you said about AsRock in this video, looks like I will be switching brands when it comes to mobos.  Thanks Jay! 🙂
I truly think that anyone that has been building say last 3 years or so, saw this coming and it was a matter of time before someone with a platform to actually stand up and say something. I was sure that if I was running into issues along with others I know, that this must be happening for the content creators as well at some level. I had just thought they(creators) had better lines of Communication and could get replacements that were good really fast where it went under the radar. I think the creators should probably band together. I’m not sure if just Jay and Steve is enough. It will get it out there but it’s gonna take a full stop to make them do the right thing. I do think they probably downsized some of the departments and don’t see the value in them and now they are running into issues just for controlling costs which equals more upfront profit.
How ironic that ASUS is acting like a sus
I was planning to get a Asus board with a 7800x3d because I'm not happy with gigabyte but seems like I better look for another brand.
so i have been in cave for a long time, so ASUS have fallen.... what the top 3 brand for motherboard for now??? i haven't upgrade my pc for a long time now, seeing this kind of problem makes me scare
I am literally 2 hours away from ordering my 7800X3D, 4090 build, i had a B650 ASUS motherboard, after this video, and thank god i watched it, i am going MSI with no hesitation, thank you Jay!!
I just got a system with 7800x3d and msi x670e and dont know what to do really, it just arrived n i set it up. I flashed the latest bios that said they put precautions against 7000 series (something along those lines, dont remember) . Anything extra that i need to do? I didnt touch anything. Could y,all help me?
This could explain why so many ASUS brand laptops are selling for so cheap.  I was looking at buying one, but now I will save more money and buy a Samsumg or an MSI.
Does this mean you will not be reviewing the ROG Ally?
I want to see Asus's response to all this. I expect crickets or they'll blame end users.
Lol @ 4:15 hahaha
It seems the only normal functioning ASUS motherboard is the ROG Maximus Z790 Apex. It has been an amazing board with no voltage problems. I have it in combination with a 13900KS
Mad respect!
The asrock thing is kind of strange to me. I didn't know they were considered a bad brand at one point. I had an asrock board in my first build in 2011, and then MSI, and gigabyte in a couple of others, didn't like them and went back to Asrock which I have now in a 5950x build. I had some issues with MSI and gigabyte but never with my asrock boards. I have another 2 in some home media pc's on the cheaper skew and also 0 issues so far.
I'm still using my Asus P8Z68-Vpro from 2010...  back when the company made good products
Asus taking a page outa Newegg's play book with the RMA jam...
I've used MSI boards the most for the past 27 years  of building PC, but have tried them all.  Was never a fan of ASUS.  I did own a X470 Crosshair, and it was ok.  Gigabyte's X470 boards were trash and MSI didnt have a good comparable board that was easy to find when I bought my 2700x back then.  Gigabyte's X570 boards were solid though and I now have a MSI MEG X570S ACE MAX.   Most of it is probably due to x470 vs x570, but the x570 MSI mb weighs like 3 times what the asus does and I have way way way less problems from it. My gf bought an ASUS pre-built before i met her and it is without a doubt the biggest POS I've ever seen.  And, these products like a strix 4090 being literally $400 more than a 4090FE are just MORONIC.  Stop being a lil consumer lemming and don't buy that over priced junk.
Mad Respect.
I won’t ever be buying an Asus board again. I bought an Asus board for my 3990x and it has given me nothing but headaches.
Dang ! and here I was thinking about buying a TUF Gaming Z790 plus ddr5 for a 13600k, does the problem exist even on the intel side of their boards ?
I agree that board ahouldnt have been sent to you, but you act like peopel cabt make mistakes.    Dont you make mistakes? As long as they send you a lerfect replacement then it should be good.   You have the accessories from the original board you bought.  I just think youre being way too dramatic
ASUS has been playing dirty for a while now. Less features for more money, forcing software from the motherboard to the C drive. I've really grown to despise this company.
i must say asus seems to have lost it's way and dusnt represent true Rupublic Of Gamers anymore. i feel like most stuff after the x570 platform has gone way down. i got a rog crosshair Viii formula x570 mb and it has served we very well for the last couple years but when i eventually upgrade i will be looking at another brand.
Makes me wonder how well their Steam Deck "killer" is going to hold up on the long term.  If its going to burst into flames after a few hours of use.
This could possibly explain why my Maximus Hero Z790 straight out the box had bent pins in one of the USB 3.0 connectors, starting to wonder if I experienced a similar situation to Jay's because I can say with full confidence that seeing that in the middle of my first build frustrated the hell out of me.
I recently bought and built a PC with a ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-F GAMING WIFI motherboard, should I be worried???
I'm glad I've only bought 1 asus item, being a 30 series gpu. I've seen many reviews when looking into asus routers that discussed the software issues and customer service horror stories. Sounds like the people have spoken! ❤
I've been using Asus for a long, long time. It seems that relationship will end next time I am upgrading/building a new system.
Completely understand your reaction...had similar troubles with razer(keyboard broken after 6 months, resending it and getting qwerty instead of qwertz keyboards 4 times in a row...)Some brands are just...out of touch...but overall,Go Jay :D
Why not just use AM4 for the time being if there's so many issues with AM5 and its boards? Have never had any issue with my 5600 on an Asus B450 ROG whatever, it's been perfectly stable. Maybe AMD and the board manufacturers (mostly Asus) can figure out stability for AM5 next year lol.
My Crosshair Formula VIII got bricked after a bios update and a restart.  Ended up with  GA-35x prebuilt after having to scrap my custom, this is probably my last ROG product as it is underperforming its components and XMP just goes unstable and crashes
yep! our company lost confidence with ASUS long time ago! the quality keeps on declining.
After 10 Years I built a new System with Asrock x670e mainboard and 7800x3d, a few days before shit hit the Fan. I really dont know what do to now. Really would like to keep it.
That's a shame. I bought one of their Zephyrus laptops a few years ago and it's been a solid performer, and the support (what little I needed) has been great. To see a brand fall so far, so fast, is just very sad. Perhaps if more creators take a similar stance, they'll get the hint... probably not, but here's to hoping.
It's easy for you to say that you don't want to be sponsored by Asus anymore. We, the consumer, are stuck with their hardware, not able to return it anymore to switch brand.
Recently I just updated my Asus board drivers on two PCs and my Realtec audio driver installed all this Sonic Suite software that I didn't consent to that created auto-start software and created new audio devices in Windows that screwed up all my software.  Left a bad taste in my mouth for sure.
That sucks about ASUS.  But not suprising.  It seems all big companies go this way.  I am still running an ASUS board in my OLD 3770k and it's great.  But my upcoming build.   No ASUS.
Well... I'm glad the last thing I bought with Asus on it was essentially a rebranded Intel piece...
Thank you Jay! I just built a new system (my original was a new i7-2660k), and after watching your channel and what you like I went with all EVGA. Except the FE graphics card. I have great respect for you and your ethics.
Ive seen enough as person who every build has been based on ROG MOBO's.  Ill move on with next build
a contract in bios form that you agree to that void your warranty... thats the lowest tactic i've ever heard of in computing
They release beta bios is so people can help test it. You knew it was beta when you downloaded it and you did anyway and you blame them?  Dude this is BS.   So if it voids yoir warranty then dont use it. Lol😂
You Nailed it with your statement. "every brand has issues, it's how they handle it  is what matters to me".  This is why I am sad that EVGA is gone from graphic cards.
Appreciate your transparency.
When I worked in a PC repair shop we had to replace so many MSI and Gigabyte mobos that I've gone with Asus the last few personal builds, and have had great luck. But this anti consumer behaviour is making me think about going with someone else next time unless they really clean up their act.
Dont use amd shit
What I find crazy is that if you buy a motherboard and it comes damaged... you RMA it and they send you a refurbished board... You paid for a brand new one, I don't understand why there's this expectation of "well the first brand new one I got was bad so they gave me a used one."  At least Microcenter understands the assignment, I hate that a retailer has to probably eat these costs themselves, but if I have a problem with something I bought there I can usually walk in with the part, show them the issue and they'll give me a refund or replacement and THEY will handle the RMA or refund from the company themselves, which makes sense, microcenter has negotiation power with these companies. Imagine if ASUS tried to give THEM the run around this bad, they'd just stop selling ASUS parts. I ended up with an ROG motherboard and my keyboard doesn't register half the time, some of my (usb) devices just stop working, the audio drivers fail on a regular basis and I had to install a third party software to get the "pump" lead to on the board to actually behave like a pump controller, that's not to mention that this board was a recent ROG board and it didn't come with a USB-C port.  Luckily I got the replacement plan, one benefit to a real computer store instead of buying if from websites that hide from you whenever there's a problem. Brick and Mortar is a commitment, and it's a commitment worth paying for.
About time. Gave you a sub for this video. I've seen ASUS's arrogance over the years. The main problem is the praise companies get, they ride off of its steam into oblivion. Technological narcissism really...
I totally remember when ASROCK was the low-end , budget build, avoid at all cost motherboard.
Respect Jay !!!
Bravo!
I like Asus. I have bought so many motherboards. I just purchased the z590 and its been awesome so far.  To thos day, I've never had a bad board or any bad experience.
9:08 Yeah, sorry..  I hear the black ones are bigger than the white ones.  I feel your pain.
I had the Asus x670e Crosshair in my cart when the 7800x3d was released and was just about to checkout. I'm so glad I went with my gut, removed the Crosshair, and got the MSI x670e Carbon Wifi. Haven't had an issue with it since I built it.
I've heard too much shit about ASUS, NVIDIA, a d Gigabyte. Jay just made picking parts that much easier! Thanks Jay! 😂
The stupidity and short sightedness of ASUS management is mind boggling.  Once you lose  reputation, it is 10 times harder to regain it.
I dont believe its the arogance at the top that made this, i think its the 'new style' their company is running. Support is no longer them 'tech guru' experts, but just a bunch of 'backoffice' people that use some program with some yes/no questions to end up with a 'have you tried rebooting' answer. They cut away all the 'added value' in costumersupport experts, mainstreamed it into a 'any dickhead can do support, just use this program' style of people. Its not only there, its happening at many companies, where the true support, true knowlegde basicly got kicked out and replaced by 'computer says no...' type of people.
Well done Jay!
I'll still take asus over gigabyte any day.
Love the Mega Man X tru force figure in the background 💪😊
Man i had asrock steel legend x570 and nothing but problems...went to intel and asrock extreme 4 and as you said asrock solid
Hi Jay,   I'm using a Logitech G pro superlight wireless headset. I have the asus rog strix b760-i gaming wifi motherboard. I've had 2 episodes when all of the sudden a loud static explosion is going on in the headset while i'm watching videos or playing games. Do you think this is a motherboard issue or logitech issue? I've video proof of the issue.
waiting for LTT's take.
It's sad to see a half decent brand allow itself to be taken over by corporate greed.
ASUS products has had a terrible lack of quality for the last years, I mean if I buy a $700 gfx card I kind of expect the fans to not fall out of it after 5 months of light use.. But apparently ASUS doesn't share my view on that.. Good on you Jay, a good show of integrity and credibility, and those things are hard to come by these days!
don't do it as  us ! :D
fired ?? ... you can't fire anyone if they didn't work for you in the first place ...  just saying -- if you didn't like the product -- just say you didn't like the product -- stop this overboard zealous post -- just for baiting for votes --- how sad ....
The only problem I have with this is that Gigabyte, ASUS, MSI and Asrock have all had garbage behaviour with products and corp reactions in the last 5 years.   So what can you build with that has 100% confidence?  Nothing.  Not even Supermicro has avoided all controversy.    I guess this means it's time for Biostar and Soyo to make a big comeback push to the consumer space! 🙂  ASUS used to carry a higher quality mark with there name.  Now they are just selling $600 motherboards that don't do anything extra.  Moar RGB ROG, and unnecessarily large GPUs.   This is the general trend though.  ASUS is just the most expensive/premium brand of them all.  They are just the biggest target that stepped into the poop pile first.  *My first premium build was on a ASUS TX97.  Then I went mostly Gigabyte for 23 years.  Latest was ASUS ROG Strix x570 Gaming E, over priced but hasn't gone wrong yet.  Except the name is waaaaaay too long.
Had to RMA my x570 tuf gaming motherboard and it was obvious that they all they needed to do was send me a new motherboard and they sat on it for 2 weeks before shipping it to me. This doesn't include the week leading up to getting the RMA approved and doesn't include the week it took to actually get it shipped to me so a solid month went by where I couldn't use my PC. Fortunately I went with a gigabyte board and that has been rock solid I'm done with ASUS.
Jay again being an idiot, shiting on entire brand just becouse of motherboard department mistakes....
After 3 Asus products failing with no way to fix them, they are now on my naughty list  -Laptop: Bios will throttle the CPU under heavy load TO 300mhz instead of BY 300Mhz to keep temps reasonable. No BIOS/Firmware updates to fix the major f'up.  -Monitor: Dead pixels. But not enough to qualify for RMA. Also annoyingly slow when switching resolutions.  -Motherboard: Faulty audio chip implementation. No way to fix it. The work around is to turn of the RGB lighting... Thankfully the retailer accepted it back and I got a refund.  The amount of research I had to do to find out... I'm just doooooone.
Respect Jay ❤
ASUS gave me the 🖕🏼 after buying the $800+ 690 formula. Which water block is copper plated aluminum. Their response is, just don’t use the the waterblock you paid the extra $500 for 🤨🤬 my first board also came with messed up pins
That behaviour especially with the release of a BIOS update that voids your warranty in the fine print ... that is relevant for legal actions. ASUS is probably facing a class action lawsuit.  But heck, now we only have 2 good manufacturers left: AsRock and MSI. Gigabyte is a firmware mess and ASUS is unreliable as heck. Brilliant ...
After watching this, I'd love to see an updated "Brands to Trust/Not" video from you. I still have notes from a previous one that I refer to when working on builds, and would be curious what you think the PC components market looks like now.
This is the Way!
I had DigitalStorm build me a Ryzen and TUF Gaming Desktop. It has alot of problems. I was blaming DigitalStorm all along, perhaps I need to blame Asus. The PCI Slot is totally screwed. BSOD constantly, I can use the secondary PCI Slot just fine.
Sounds like a class action cause of action...
Damn ASUS, I'm sitting here watching it on my PC based around an ASUS consumer mobo from waaaaaaay back. which would have been a great advertisement for your product.... But you blew it.
F@@k that means i am pretty much screwed. Will never buy anything asus again after 20 years!
Make a FOIA request? Reheheheally Asus? You're not the CIA Darling.
I love Asus.  My first gaming computer was an Asus prebuilt.  I'm rocking a g14, a g15, and I use Asus GPUs.  Seeing this hurts as I don't think anyone else makes anything that can match the Zephyrus line of computers.
I had one of Hero X670E motherboard and 7900X CPU. And I said "I had" because same issue hit me as well. And let's see what will asus do...
If this keeps up, the only shills Asus will have will be Linus.  Time for another sponsored video to upgrade his home!  gogo Asus.
Way to go Jay! love the stance and Integrity shown, we got your back! Keep up the great work!
I can understand the fault with the capacitor, simply a human error putting the capacitor feed in backwards, but burning CPUs in their socket,,, could that also be the CPU makers fault, producing faulty CPUS on the manufacturing line? CPU might be getting the correct voltage, but has flaws causing it to burn?
Reminds me of back when Zoom Telephonics was installing beta or worse versions of firmware on modem chipsets.
i recently RMA'd a 3080 gundam, they sent me a used piece of garbage that wasnt even working, like do you not test them!?!?
I have an AMD 7950X with an Asus E670E Gaming Wifi motherboard.  When I initially built this system, I had to go through 3 motherboards to find one that booted and didn't give me memory errors at stock memory speeds.  Nothing overclocked or even close to overclocked as most of the time, you couldn't get into the bios at all.  I am sure glad I purchased them from Microcenter, they replaced them with no problem.  The 3rd motherboard has been working fine so from them so far (knocks on wood).  The board is on the 1203 bios and I worry about both the board and CPU going up in smoke with this but I am not installing the 1410 bios with it being beta and the B.S. way Asus is trying to covering their a$$.  After watching Steve's video and seeing that the 1410 bios doesn't even help, I shall just wait for something non beta and tested to make sure it works right.
Massive Kudos Jay, you have our backs and we got yours.  Goodbye ASUS its depressing but they done it to themselves.
When someone like Jay says 'thank god I have an MSI board in there now' you know ASUS messed up.
For anybody who has only ever bought ASUS boards, go MSI. I've only ever had 1 bad MSI board and it just wouldn't turn on, it wasn't some explosion risk or burnt, it was just dead. Apart from that MSI have been amazing for my entire PC building life, you can just overclock their boards to the max and they are so reliable that they take it in their stride. Before I even think about going AM5 I'll for sure just max out this board with 64GB RAM and whatever Ryzen 9 is the max for this SOC. If you value stability and reliability on top of power and speed you could do waaaaaay worse than an MSI MOBO.
They only care about handhelds now anyway.
Never been disappointed by msi but I still hate that bioses are closed source, nobody has any idea what code runs their hardware, changelogs or most of the time inexistent etc. All of these could be solved by open-sourcing something as critical to the hardware and even safety. Nobody cares apparently, otherwise people wouldn't run that unknown blobby shady stuff that is windows.
I am on my 2nd ROG STRIX Z690-E and it has started failing me today. I had the sound crackling issue you mention Jay on my first board. I am grateful I got the extended warranty by Microcenter. Turns out the board was listed as a do not sell but somehow I was able to buy it.  Def considering to switch tot he Kingpin board
I will no longer be buying anything asus. They don’t deserve our money.
I gave up on Asus after i bought a "flagship" Asus Zenfone AR back in the day , and it never got an Android update. Would of thought that (at the time) a 750€ phone was a priority for them.
have you tried turning it on and off again
My current build has an Asus motherboard in it with an R7 2700. When it is time for me to upgrade, rest, assured, I will never use an Asus motherboard for it.
JAY SUCKS ASUS GOT THE BUILD PERIMETORS FROM AMD , CLEARLY TSMC TRANSITORS CAN'T HANDLE THE LOAD AMD IS PUTTING ON THEM . OVER TIME WE WILL SEE LOTS OF THESE CHIPS FAIL . THE CONSUMER LEVEL IT WILL HURT A LITTLE ONCE THE SERVER CHIPS START FAILING THAT WILL BE BAD FOR AMD.

its crazy how many companies are ending up like this. Gone are the Days where you HAD to make quality product and maintain good customer relations to make money and stay in business. Now companies have so much money etc they can burn whatever theyw ant and make whatever subpar product they want with no real consequences
Can you support ASRock? Ive been having great success with them! Also, why support Intel after they violated laws that caused severe harm to AMDs advancement? They still haven't paid AMD the full amount awarded to them by the courts. I feel AMD deserves more credit and support and exposure then they receive. Nvidia is just marketing garbage for their garbage that ends up catering to AMD and Open Standard eventually.
I used to praise Asus but the last few years they have just lost their minds. Something needs to change internal to fix the problems
haha let watch the Prices Crash like their boards
Though not on the same level as cpu+mobo meltdowns, I experienced ASUS's sketchiness & deception when they lied about specs on an ROG laptop I purchased. (2020 G15 model line) I was not fully familiar with gaming laptops at the time and I was upgrading memory. I contacted them and support to make sure the correct ram was purchased and used.... only to have the listed web support info + tech support be completely different from what was actually in the computer.  I kept on them for a long time for reimbursement/coverage of their incorrect info/error. The ram could not be returned at this point. Tons of runaround emails, phone calls, up and down through different "levels" of service/customer relations. I got everything from lies, blame, to offers of extended lifetime service, discounts or a free  backpack. One second I am the wrong doer at fault, another they are saying they "may" have made an error.... They flat out refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing on there part, unintentional or not.  ASUS went and changed the support documents/spec, told me I never was told the info I was told and changed the specs on the website.  It feels like the idea of follow through on quality, support and guarantees on any of their major tech is absolutely abysmal or non-existent. I am much wiser on this stuff now because of this crappy experience.*  *note: ROG G15 dual channel memory models take 3200MHz DDR4 ram for best performance (that was the oem speed inside) The motherboard and cpu (intel 10th gen+) will accept 64gb ram (there is no 32gb "limit")  My opinion of ASUS is now, avoid buying because it is basically a gamble. Maybe it is great or really good....until it has any defect, needs updates or support of any kind. They have done this before as a company/brand and are still doing it. And they are totally reinforcing it with these Ryzen bios updates.
Two major tech channels speaking up against ASUS really has put a dent into their reputation. The bigger they are the harder they fall, I guess. On the other hand I never had any problems with Asrock. Well, the last time I had an Asrock board was almost 20 years ago. MSI is my main go to for mainboards, but I don't want any other products made by them. Whatever happened to companies specialising in one kind of product and doing it extraordinarily good?
Also their Mobos prices have skyrocketed.
Hey, we might've fixed the problem, but the fix voids your warranty so if it doesn't work we don't have to help you anymore.
Always voice "the people"!
This is exactly why I don't buy Asus and haven't since 2005. Soket 775 P5N Deluxe. I got lucky with mine. I got some of the highest Benchmarks on Active Air Cooling. Can't say my customers were so lucky and myself to. Asus hasn't changed
I've refused to use anything ASUS. Besides their UEFI malware (basically) the only good thing was their older strix cards that were just unique and cool. MSI definitely way better since the old FX AMD CPU's.
Well said, Jay. Asus just cares about the money. I think you should give Gigabyte a try before switching back to AMD.
Welp, I'm firing Asus as my usual go-to mobo supplier. Haven't ever had an issue with any of them, but I believe such behaviour should be punished.
As someone who has been using ASUS for my motherboards since circa 2006 (I've had good quality, feature, and RMA experiences in the past) this is very useful information to hear. On the next thing I build I will very much need to look elsewhere. I hope they will turn the corner on this. They were a good brand. Sounds like they've been chasing profits too much while sacrificing that which made them worth buying in the first place. (Almost none of the ASUS boards I have bought have been the cheapest for a given feature set I wanted. So, I paid a premium for what was a better experience, in my opinion.)
Feeling a little better about using ASRock boards in builds for my dad and father in law now.  Feeling less great about having used Asus for my own builds...  But, for 5000 series Ryzen so I think those should be okay.  This has to be a hard decision to make...  Definitely appreciate you sticking to your principles on this, Jay!
A year ago if I were to buy a GPU (not that I can afford it) I probably would have only considered Asus or EVGA. Now I can't get EVGA and don't want Asus. If Noctua builds a GPU with someone else maybe I'll buy that instead
I always love the ROG products but Jay is right about how they didn't handle the bios issue sooner than later. I had no issues with rog product plus Their video cards has been top tier for me. I wish Asus can fix this and show people that they care in a certain way.
This might come off rude but, NZXT handled the H1 fire issue terribly, yet they're still a sponsor of yours. If you had a contract with ASUS, would this video even been made?   It's great that you're saying fuck you to ASUS but I feel like this would have been a little more genuine if you did this with NZXT. Now I know you said you can't just write off every brand because you'd be sitting in the corner but I personally feel like NZXT should also be a brand people should write off.   NZXT mods etc literally memed and made fun of the first person that posted their issue in the NZXT sub reddit. Both ASUS and NZXT can fuck off.
When the AM2 board with 240w socket blew up 2 mosfet rails and stunk out the house, then Asus "repaired" the board, twice (2 sessions of failure in the warranty dept. First time was return no change, second was replaced with damaged rma board), and I still have the cpu just sitting on the shelf cause no other board supported that large a chip. I went with Gigabyte for my AMD 2080super build after Asus screwed me for a $350 mobo and $400 supported cpu.
Thank you very much for this, Jay! When I do computer upgrades, I can't have the risk of expending money and having these issues. In the past, I always trusted on ROG pieces because they used to be reliable... good to know that's not the case anymore. You guys could make a video with motherboard recommendations to update what's been solid and what's been letting consumers down.
Do 'they' know how influential you, Steve, and Linus (kinda, maybe in canada) are when people buy separate hardware for builds? I only know they're brand from you guys. So they just torched their whole marketing scheme and went opposite way entirely, negative points marketing and trust.
Bought an ASUS ROG B650E-I for an ITX build and it has been nothing but BSODs and RAM instability. Plus, ASUS support really sucks. I was so excited to run AMD but running this motherboard has been horrible. Burned through 4 different RAM models and not one but TWO identical motherboards from ASUS and both had issues...
Respect!
I use DARK HERO VII for my graphics card. And use a Rog thor for my power.
FOIA requests are too easy btw. Would make for awesome content :)
MSI and now ASUS, two respected brands that have absolutely faceplanted in the past couple of generations on quality.  Pretty soon we're going to have nobody left to buy from.
I'll get burned for this. Jay is sitting there surrounded by ASUS motherboard boxes, giving ASUS marketing from arguably the 2nd highest Youtube influencer. So he seems to be supporting ASUS until you watch his video.
I just finished planning my new computer and its on its way now, and the retailer already took out all ASUS products back in ' 19. I was sceptical when I found out but now I am really glad they did, because the processor is a 7800X3D.
This s*x I have been a life long ASUS guy... Time to try other brands...
Unfortunately i just bought a asus tuf 4090.. ill change brand from now on
these corporations today are run by cowards.
I have built 2 systems with asus motherboards both doa when I received them went to Msi boards both run fantastic
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time...
Can you look into some of these motherboard manufactures forcing bloatware on the consumer. The sonic suite is just one example -- I know it can be uninstalled now; for years it was unremovable from your machine unless you swapped the motherboard. Sonic suite wasn't harmful in and of itself, but it sets a very risky precedent as informed hackers always have a backdoor if they learn to crack one of the preinstalled programs. And if the user can never get it off the system... Just doesn't make a lot of sense from a security perspective.
Wow I was going to use a ASUS Board for my next build so what should I use now? What is the best board for a i9-13900KS with an H170i for cooling and Corsair Vengeance DDR5 60000MHZ memory? I like have no clue what to use now? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!  (I also just bought their ROG Thor platinum 2 PSU so I hope that will be ok?)
Hired copywriters instead of developers/engineers.
Was gonna get an Asus ROG ally. Now I’m not.
I have built around 50 pc computers in my days with Intel CPU. Now I'm trying to build a PC with ROG STRIX B550-F Gaming motherboard with AMD Ryzen 7 5800X.  First I bought a Power Supply 650w because I read on the ASUS website that the motherboard uses 135w but in the motherboard's user manual it says 350W which is not stated on the ASUS website, so I upgraded to the ASUS ROG Strix 100G Gaming Power Supply.  I get the motherboard led lights to light up but when I press the start button or use a screwdriver on the power button pins on the motherboard, the computer doesn't start, I don't even get into the bios.  Have tried both with gamer graphics cards and a cheaper graphics card to rule out problems with graphics cards for AMD Ryzen 7 5800X has no graphics processors even if there is hdmi on the motherboard it cannot be used.  As it is now, I'll probably have to send back the motherboard and Power Supply for another brand
Every gpu i had from Asus died quicly ( never OC ) So for me Asus is dead and i wont buy anything from them ever again.
ASUS recently tried to claim my board was customer induced damage because "the pins were bent."  One of the pins was twice as long as it was supposed to be.  They are definitely looking for any excuse to not honor warranties.   "But you don't care" hits hard mans.  Right in the feels.
Hi Jay this is my opinion, and you're entitled to your own. I think you're ungrateful for ASUS sponsorship and their commitment to the industry. What you review from ASUS product range is often your narrow focus on a few component categories from what ASUS produce globally. You're being overly harsh towards the brand, you make far too many generalisations - your job is easy in comparison to a manufacturer on that scale. It seems like an inflated sense of self worth, it appears like a mistake on your behalf and an overreaction. I wish you well otherwise.
Built my son his first pc for last christmas. It has been 15 years since I was a pc gamer, but I went with what I knew - Asus! (ROG STRIX B650E-F GAMING WIFI mother board and ASUS TUF-RX6800XT-O16G-GAMING GPU).   Should I be concerned?  One other thing - a lot of the comments are saying that Jay is being consumer minded and sticking up for them. Not to troll, but there's also an element of pragmattic brand management here. How can an influencer in all good conscience ally themselves with a manufacturer that is potentially going to sullying them both?
Ass😅us
GG fairplay
Jay I had the same thing happen but it was MSI not Asus 2 failed boards in a row. Went back to ASRock So far am happy.
Asus always has had horrible cs. They failed to fix my gpu, and wanted more money than I purchased the thing for, to repair it. Needless to say, Asus hasn't had business for me since the event in 2017.
I can only say about ASRock as a pc builder, if you want cheap hardware, you can get it cheap, if you take premium editions, then you will get premium, they have both, in compared to many other manufacturers.
Well done, I have also been asus fan for a long time but I stand by your words when company does not  stand by there brand or costumers any more. Any brand more worried about profits and letting share holders dictate business etc which trickles down to poor service / quality / reliability. and the don't care they will loose clients.
This happens often in business. The second you become number 1 is the second you start becoming number 2 due to complacency. Hopefully they pull an ASRock and come back in quality.
I might have missed it.  Which manufacture are we switching to?
If you think this is the only company that only cares about it's bottom dollar to an extent that screws the consumer, you're sadly mistaken. This is the start of going down a very sad, very depressing rabbit hole.
*applause*
Asus must be owned by Apollo Scooters
This makes me really sad because I would only buy asus mothboards due to their reputation/features
Thank you Jay, I actually was planning to go full Asus on my next build, even though I've had so many problems with their products in the past as well and don't get me started on their RMA. Thinking that they have improved their products was a mistake. The only thing keeping them financially afloat is their brand and marketing. If I went with Asus, not only would I be overpaying because of their brand but I would also be paying for crap. They design products really well and it's sad to see this goto waste due to their lack in quality control. Once again I very much appreciate your transparency and raising awareness of this issue.
The last time Steve went on some rant about MSI and how they’re anti-customer and he’ll never deal with them again, I bought a few different products from them and they have been rocksolid all these years later, so take this stuff with a grain of salt..I’m sure if you buy one of these boards and use it the way it was intended without experimental bios, you’ll be just fine. I can’t tell you how many products I have received that got damaged somehow in handling or when they were shipped, that made you wonder how the heck did that happen but it does happen. Also use your products for their intended purpose and don’t push the envelope so much. ASUS built a great company over the years and they still are, despite negative publicity you might see in social media which is just a reality now if you are a manufacturer
Good. I concur with this action and hope that it scares Asus into coming clean
The only ASUS product I ever bought was a GTX 1060. And that was just because my Sapphire RX 480 had to be RMD'd  a number of years a go. Did not last long because a few weeks later, a GPU I wanted was a Zotac GTX 1070ti. Still rocking that GPU. Has problems with some games being released this year. Do not buy many modern games. And honestly, the only game that was released this year that I was having problems with was Hogwarts Legacy. RE4 Remake runs really well with this card, which was the most recent game I got this year. But what is funny is I got that Zotac card because I liked out the back plate looked.
Very respectful, Jay. 10/10.
@Jayz I bought an ASUS Chromebook that was faulty so I could fix it up and use as a android table/laptop  I rang ASUS up to see what the model number PSU they use on that model Chromebook and they stated and I quote "we can not tell you that" I wasnt asking for any component level data I just wanted to be able to source an authentic ASUS psu
After watching this video I decided to stop looking Asus motherboard from now on and buy a different brand but I will still buy their GPU
I bought an x750 mobo from ASUS (brand new) and then out of nowhere my computer started shutting down, now I know why. Never buying anything ASUS related ever again.
Thank you Jay and crew! Keep up the good work and delivering quality content!
I just put together a new build with a Ryzen 7 and ASUS mobo. Within a few days I instantly starting having CPU overheating issues. The problem, you ask? BIOS had me overclocked by DEFAULT! I had zero intention of overclocking anything and didn't having the cooling to handle it. I'm glad I caught it before damage was done, but good lord, they need to fix this shit.
Recently bought a Strix Z690-E from Microcenter that would either blue screen or fail to POST if I had my RAM in the default A2+B2 slots. Exchanged it without any hassle. The replacement has seemingly been working fine, but I have had weird IO issues. I assumed those are being caused by bad device drivers, but now I'm wondering if it's the MOBO. Between this + issues that I've had with their annoying bloatware (which needs to be installed in order for certain features to work), I think I'm done with Asus.
It's really a shame that ASUS has engaged in this type of behavior, their products tend to be damn good actually. Using one of their boards right now, and have 4 more from them, pretty much 0 issues. EDIT: Yeah their software is god awful, armory crate is such a POS, takes forever to load, I keep disabling in game RGB integrations, and it keeps coming back, over and over, and over again, the RGB goes nuts when Bluetooth is turned ON or OFF or a device is connected.
I remember 13-15 years ago, ASUS was the motherboard brand everybody wanted. ASUS remembered that and never moved forward. Now we are seeing the end result of that ASUS arrogance.
Lol Jay “the second I went live this happened” cuts to clip instantly cuts to YouTube add/commercial 😂…I don’t think that’s what Jay was talking about
Keep your "stuff". LOL. I heard that audio overlay.
It's such a shame. I was a huge fan of ASUS for many, many years. I used only ASUS boards for decades. But over he last 5ish years, they have gone downhill quality wise. I just built a new computer last month and for he first time, I choose a Gigabyte instead. Look's like I was right to do so.
Thanks Jay for telling this about Asus. I have had both laptops, keyboard, routers and graphic cards break on me. I don't even think they make beautiful products any more.
Excellent video.
Asus has already done right by me. I hear about all these stories and I still have not witnessed anything personally. I still run Asus mobos in all my builds and run Asus gpus. I mean personally I still trust them however since I have seen these issues over and over I hope that Asus fixes their ship.
last year i got a AIO Asus ryu, mini itx b560 rog strix and a 3070 tuf, so because i had a shitload of problems  i had to go with MSI products and i'll never switch i'm happy with how my new stuff is performing
I have a friend who always bought asus motherboard and he always had problem with them, thats the main reason i dont go with asus anymore ahaha 😂.
Bigger brands fail? I am curious, what brands is he talking about?
Respect to you, Jay. I've got a X670E-E that's been sitting in my new rig I'm building that I'm terrified to turn on. I'm definitely going to be buying a different motherboard though to replace it. It's really heartening to see someone I respect and have learned so much from to stick to their guns
I don't know which motherboards to buy really, in the future.  Asus is not worth it anymore since Armory Create. Gigabyte makes amazing motherboards, but god help you if the ever break and you have to deal with their warranty / RMA / support process... MSI? How's MSI warranty and post sale support? Is EVGA still making motherboards? Any AM5 motherboard from EVGA??
No one learned from Samsung, does it have to be life-threatening to make bold actions?!
My first MB was the Asus z690 d4 I loved it but when I switched to DDR5 I went with the gigabyte z790 aorus master i still can't get any xmp profile to work but at least there's no safety concerns there glad I switched
What an absolute CHAD for not caring about the Corp sponsorship and spreading the news to the consumer.
Great video
Funny you said that about your stream “game sound cutting out” when I stream on stream labs OBS on Strix 570x AMD 5800x I get odd sound issues at times. We reset my memory profile and it seemed to have fixed it
With how Asus and amd are havin a very hot time I feel bad for pep that bought the rog ally... Imagine gamin docked on turbo ultra mode or whoever is called and it goes ka boom
I have had issues with Asus for years now. small things mostly, but always something.
Dang I was excited about the new rog ally now I don't know what to do about it
My ASUS TUF motherboard has been a POS since I got it in 2020. I can’t tweak Jack-all besides setting a memory profile otherwise it’ll just crash and/never boot. And every bios update is a tiny increase. I just don’t touch it anymore. I’m not touching ASUS going forward especially after everything that I’ve read and seen about them lately.   Thanks Jay. Helping us dodge bullets.
Everything I have is ROG top end. I've not had to deal with Asus for a few years now with RMA issues but in the past I have to say they have been great. It's a shame to hear they are falling down the ladder. I will be keeping a close eye on on them and my equipment as I'm always scouting for new and upcoming upgrades.
I have had an ASROCK board for two years now. I was so sketched to use it due to their past problems, but it has worked great. I really wonder what is going on with ASUS right now. It seems their pricing continues to climb faster than other brands while their quality goes down.
This really bums me out because I have loved Asus products since back in the K6 socket 7 days and now has me looking at other brands for my next personal laptop.  But this is also another reason why I won't use Windows 11! I just got a new laptop for work and during the initial windows update it automatically started updating the BIOS! So Win11 was immediately nuked after that. That's definitely something the os should decide automatically especially if a company publishes a bad bios!!
How many $$$ of mobords are on the table? or should I say, off.
I just bought an Asus board, Z690-plus D4. Any known issues with these and what alternative is there?
Hope my x670 Gigabyte Gaming X AX with 7800x3d doesnt go up in flames 🤞
this is why you dont go with aesthetics over performance jay
Honestly Jay, I'm surprised you didn't ditch them when the backwards-capacitor issue arose.   None of these "premium" manufacturers deserve a second chance, especially when their PR and customer services are this bad.  FOIA?  That's a one-way ticket to Never-Againland.  Asus' QC has been failing to live up to expectations for years, but their customer service in this latest debacle is just... there isn't a strong-enough negative adjective to describe it...  The last time I had an Asus board in any system was back when the 4700 Intel series was the hot ticket.  2 years later the RoG Hero board I used in that build failed.  I replaced it with a Gigabyte board.  It's been running 24x7 ever since and is still, to this day, rock solid.   That was the ONLY time I've had a board failure in the 20+ years I've been building my own systems.   Haven't had an Asus product in any of my numerous builds since, and it doesn't look like I'll be using them for anything in the future either.
Sad to see what used to be a great company drop off so hard. My original build used an Asus board for my 4790K, and it still runs strong as my family home PC.
really jay "no more asus money...", what about just buy the RTX 3090 back in july before EVGA got out of the gpu business ???, i guess because of your realtionships with EVGA... just because a company makes mistakes they made up of people, just like the people works for EVGA... THIS MENTALITY FOR OUTRAGE JUST TO GET CLICKS AND VIEWS WHAT A JOKE OF SO CALLED "INTEGRITY"
It was 2013 after windows 8 came out. I bought an Asus N550 a 1000€ laptop with dedicated Nvidia gpu. After only 4 years it died. A man from assistance told me it’s normal it’s a consumer grade product. Wtf I pay 1000€ only 4 years and then died , with the same money I could buy a base macbook but I choose asus for the better specs. But I was wrong indeed. I see in all those years they don’t change. They are worst than before
I really expected more from you Jay. Seems people has forgotten what beta is. Maybe the gaming industry have made people think the meaning has to do with early access to stuff. But normal buyers should never use anything with the name beta, so i fully understand Asus statement. Don't get the part where you make it sound like Asus creates crappy products. The 4090 Strix is still at the top tier of quality and performance.
Not only ASUS, but MSI had their keys or something hacked easily recently? Just disappointing…
I used to be an Asus fan but after all this crap I don't think I'll be buying anything Asus anytime soon
Never bought ASUS, and never will :) ridiculous prices just for slapping gamer/gaming on stuff.
Left ASUS long time ago and I'm surprised that it took so long for "influencers" and tech bloggers to reveal the true nature of ASUS scumbag policy of consumer avoiding warranty at all costs, had several runs with Asus regrading motherboards 2 to be exact and one VGA . My last motherboard was Z170 Prime and never again ASUS for me  . Moved form AMD regarding the same out of the blue stability issues, disconnecting devices, BSOD's for no particular reason and here on msi boards so that part is not so much ASUS alone fault must be something related to the AMD chipset, drivers and Windows as such.
I must be lucky to get a good x650e e-gaming, with a r7 7700x
yeah I don't trust them anymore after buying a laptop from them that crashed on turbo mode. Unacceptable.
did senior management moved over to Asus from MSI??? Not to point out a conspiracy theory.. but ASUS is a partner company with WEF.. MSI isn't.. Asus is going downhill.. MSI is showing massive improvement.
You can't spell ASUS without "ASS".
Every single build I've done since my first as a teenager in 2007 has been ASUS. Sadly, my recent experiences with ASUS have been pretty dang near identical. I also fired them. I feel bad for all the new builders out there that are having these problems on their first build.
I am disappointed, i did like ROG, my motherboard is Asus ROG. I haven’t had a problem, MSI, i did have an issues with a  screen on a laptop, they took care of me, and fixed it. Took a month and a half (had to be shipped and was receved during chinese new year). But they warned me it would be a little delayed because of it. Has worked fine, keep me in the loop and let me know when to expect it, i am pretty easy to work with. Mislead and void warrantys for your equipment with updates. You lost me, hate it, but if you have no confidence in your products, why should i? Glad my current rig is good, will investigate other brands to move too, i guess.
I respect how open you are about this Jay. Thank you. I think it is rather unfortunate how many channels uploaded a video praising the Asus ROG Ally on the same day ... they are probably going to make so much money of the Ally that they can afford to weather this storm. It's really a shame, I always liked Asus for their laptop ideas - I'm writing this on a Zenbook with my beloved numpad-touchpad  right now - but the next time I have to buy a laptop it's not going to be Asus unless they start turning things around right the fuck now and stop being a bunch of cunts.
Funny you make this post... After there were known issues with the Intel I-225V Ethernet adapter l, the still put it on the ROG Strix motherboards. 2 years of random disconnects from the internet, and I have tried every possible method to fix. No additional help from Intel or Asus to fix this.
The truth is where paying way more money for lower quality products sold as high end
Sad to hear this, won´t buy from them anymore. Shame, their gear has been great for me and my friends. Currently rocking their Mobo and 3080, but next time i´ll turn to some other brand.
ASUS lost me as a customer when they failed to diagnose my USB controllers crashing my x99 platform PC and then outright refused to fix it when I sent it back in for the same issue because it was two weeks out of warranty by the time they got around to diagnosing it.
I haven't touched asus since the striker 2 extreme Era. Best decision I've ever made. I don't even do repair work on any rig that has asus products. Over priced crapware since socket 775. It's just flashy brand that pumps out so many product lines that kept it as a "top" brand.
I went through the same thing with them. Two motherboards that I purchased since they would not honor their warranty. I’ve come to the realization to cut my losses and move on. I went through extensive troubleshooting for them to tell me I had bent pins. I KNOW DAMN WELL I NEVER BENT THOSE PINS. I am extra careful when installing my processor.  2 mobos and 2 sets of ram later…. STILL THE SAME ISSUE! Going through intro support now to rule out the cpu. Hard to imagine it was the cpu this whole time from the start.
So whats a good motherboard company ?
man I just bought a asus tuf plus wifi and it breaks my heart seeing it on the pile on your desk, now im scared to put it together :/
They don't care
What Mega Man figure is that in the background?
Well done Jay. Love you. x I bailed on Asus last year. Their smartphone division is the same. Zenfones with banging hardware specs, but firmware/software jank (incompetence) only has a 14 DAY warranty. The 2 year warranty only covers hardware failures. And they can't program their way out of a wet paper bag. The Zenfone 8 and Zenfone 9 were a buggy disaster for me. Thankfully I learned my lesson on the 8, so when the 9 went funny on day 13, back it went. I'll shit in my hands and clap before I buy Asus again.
I rock Aorus/Gigabyte mobo x370, that received full am4 support, including 5950. Rocking 5800X3D now. All features on this mobo are today's standards $500 boards. It costed 150. Wtf has happened with this part of industry?
he still has a ro strix pgu in the new build
I'm going to paste the exact same thing I said in the GN video (Scumbag ASUS: Overvolting CPUs & Screwing the Customer)  Historically I'd always been happy with ASUS products. It's a shame they decided to go down this route because now I can't assume that ASUS products are good anymore.
I never ever would have thought to see the day where Asus would fall. They were my definitive go-to in terms of build quality and reliability\longevity. Makes me fear for stuff like Seasonic or Corsair.... I mean, if everyone becomes a mess-up, where can I get quality parts? (Plot-twist: I don´t.)
Moved to MSI... You have the worst luck, have fun with their recent data breach.
I have an Asus Prime X670E-Pro Wifi w/7950X (non-3d) and had my own weird issue.   After tons of weird issues (Steam games hanging before starting, Java applications, including Minecraft, with severe video issues--even causing an instantaneous shutdown of the system), I finally found a solution:   I had to force onboard video OFF.   Auto was not sufficient.   Problems went away instantly.   I have a brand new PG48UQ that had issues with the screen blacking out that I sent back for repair, but they never recreated the issue.   The above onboard GPU disable seems to have even fixed that somehow (no other monitors were ever affected the same way).
nice..
I put a comment in all major tech influences (Jay, Linus, Steve, hardware unboxing, etc etc) about an Asus monitor, a shinny new 35" ultra wide monitor that came out of the box with several dead pixels (like 10 at the time of the comment) and let them know about my situation with Asus warranty, since I reached Asus and they told me that the warranties are handled by the monitor Vendor or store not them and the vendor told me the opposite!!! So WTF, but that comment I made in all those influences channels was ignored, funny to see that now yes I was right all the time about Asus crappy products/warranty policies!!!!
really hate my board... asus z790 maximus extreme here. Its the top of the line product, I mean I could get a complete gaming rig jut for the price of this mobo. First it blackscreened on Nvidia driver installation which was fixed by a bios update which was not available right from the start... and the worst thing is that I cant really play games because my 4090 (also asus, strix one) "runs out of video memory". Almost all games crash with this error and there is no fix for that. Ive found many people on reddit having the samme issue with asus products 4090 paired with an asus board and there is no fix in sight. Other brands like msi and gigabyte have already fixed this issue but no land in sight for asus users (some people have found out that gpus with 24g of vram have this specific error). shame on you asus, never again.
Have we seen bigger brands than Asus fail?  In the economy at large, I'm sure, but Asus could easily be the biggest name in the PC component space, and I can't remember the last time we lost a bigger one.  EVGA is the closest thing in recent memory, and they're still around, making super expensive motherboards.
cant spell asus without  S U S  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
When I decide to upgrade my G14 (2020), it needs to be to another 14" gaming laptop, because the G14 just fits my wheelchair table.  There's 3 laptop series (only 1 of them updated for 2023 - that's the G14...) to pick from in 2023. I'm hoping to use the 2020 G14 for many years to come, but if I need a new laptop soon, my only choice is ASUS - unfortuanely. They are a scumvbag company. I also have a B550-F mobo in my desktop, which is amazing. Shame to see ASUS fall off a cliff!
Hopefully EVGA doesnt kill their MB line like their GPUs.  My cousin has an MSI board that had some issue with letting him enter the bios screens in 2020.  The support was super fast (probably an AI).  Sounds good.  However, very quickly they ran out of standard troubleshooting steps...you know....the stuff any reasonable person would try before even emailing support.  As soon as that happened he was ghosted harder than an average dude on a dating app.  Then add in their GPU scalping during the 3080 launch.  Gigabyte at least provided me actual support in figuring out that my corsair power supply had a known but undisclosed issue, but then they started burning PSUs down and turn off their RMA page whenever some of their hardware is breaking.    I boycotted newegg for two years, but it is not like amazon is any better.  Amazon sent me a "new" nvme that already had someone's install of windows on it.   There is no one that can be trusted.
ASUS=NewEgg
Just saying, ASUS thinks that better product must include more RGBs and fancy graphics... meanwhile ASrock just asked their rock solid ASrock-rack department to make a solid products and then spinkled some glitter on top to sell it to gaming crowd.
I feel like this AMD and Asus controversy is just like the Ford and firestone tire controversy with the explorers. AMD would be fire stone and Asus would be Ford. Ford was telling people to under inflate their tires below firestones specifications and it was causing tire blowout and subsequent vehicle rollovers.
I have always used Asus graphics cards, after this even if its just the mobo. I will be switching to MSI , I love Asus but they need to get there sh*t together.
Lian Li Asus. They are the same software wise. Both suck.
Dam i have strix x670 hero and ive had so many problems with windows all the time im now thinking is it the motherboard.....
2:35 it is also b650e boards asus
I completely understand and respect your decision but I am curious if you'll completely skip over reviewing the ROG Ally handheld. That will be a huge thing for us pc builders/gamers.
Thankfully the ProArt boards have been solid. I did 2 builds this year with ProArt boards (besides my own) one with a 7700x and one with a 7900x3D (mine has a 7800x3D) and they've been solid. No problems with voltage, no problem with memory tuning. But the seeing the Prime, ROG boards melting is concerning, considering they use the same manufacturing line. The ProArt boards aren't even the most expensive either, they're $450 compared to alot of the ROG stuff. But it's not out of character for ASUS, back in early 2016 I had to buy a completely different motherboard for my 6700k because I didn't realize my Maximus Hero VIII had a bricked bios that I couldn't update. The BIOS chip wouldn't let me write to it. Sent it in, they sent me a board with bent pins back. Ended up buying an MSI Krait in white and never looked back lol. Did have an ASUS Prime Z390-A board ship with my 9900ks though. It worked fine except for any memory over 3600MHz. Luckily I didn't need any faster memory.
I am fairly certain that installing a beta BIOS voiding the warranty will not hold up in court due to the warranty act. Otherwise all companies would state that updating any system or software from factory defaults will void the warranty.
This is going to absolutely kill sales of the Ally.
its amd bro sorry to say
Thanks for the update…I also have experience everything you mentioned in a live stream and I pretty much have the same hardware as you, minus the custom liquid cooling.
It sounds like there have been some serious changes in upper management.  That would explain quality control issues, customer service,  and the contract.  I would look up the chain to where those areas converge.
I am in the process of RMA my pg35vq monitor because of fan noise and got a replacement monitor PG42UQ from Asus yesterday after a month of starting the process. I gave my monitor to the courier company but when I opened the replacement,  I found out that the screen is broken, even though it was properly packed. My guess is, they shipped me the customer returned monitor or packed a broken monitor to cover up their mistake.
Is not just Asus.... My gigabyte am5 board is crap too ...  AM5 has tons of issues
And I was getting ripped for using an MSI MB for my 13900k and 4090 build. I had an x99 build using a MSI MB and have had no issues ever and is still running strong. Glad I trusted my instincts
Integrity is what you're showing here, Jay. This is why I am still watching after 10 years. Thank you.
Not first time quality and such drops on brand when they're on the "top" Still remember something similar happened to asus years ago, board I had was good, but after that quality and such went down, know this because friends who got asus products like a year later all had problems and MSI (I think) became the number 1 for some time after that. Problem is the brand that is at the top doesn't look down what's happening meanwhile those below are trying to get to the top and will deliver good quality and such, most resent example is probably amd vs intel
I was planning to buy an asus laptop. Should i step back and buy another brand of laptop?
Someone get me the Vince McMahon YOURRRRRRRRRRRRRREE FIRREDDDDDDDDDD gif, this is magic
shame I just bought an Asus. haven't started using it. hope it s alright
Well done! Too bad we can't fire politicians like this.
Me avoids Asus for years while everyone tells me they're great.  Me: Finally goes Asus for my latest build.  Everyone: Asus bad now.  Me: Welp f*ck me then.
Asus is trash altogether since ages ago
if you don't really have a contract, are you really firing them? i think they passive-aggressively fired you first, looks like you both win?
As I literally just built my new PC with all ASUS 😢
Well Jay now you have to keep that AMD mother the MSI motherboard with your AMD that was giving you the problems because we got to prove it now so you got to keep it in there as long as you can you can't switch back to Intel we got to see if it actually is a cyst and if this actually does solve it then it was Asus all along now we got to make the proof and if it's not AMD
Wow, are the Asus B650E-E boards still good?
So glad I didnt go for Asus for my new 2023.  I went with an all MSI + BeQuiet build!
The one thing I admire is that you at least explain why you chose what you chose.  I agree with you that ASUS's quality has been slowly slipping away for quite some time now and it's now coming to the point where they needed that call out.  I hope that it causes them to think about their quality control processes and they finally take some action.  Don't think it'll work though unless you have others who are willing to do likewise.
i was going to upgrade to a 7800x3d soon but i will not be buying asus rog again, well done asus, you destroyed your own brand
i was about to buy asus motherboard as i was just building my new PC but then the voltage stuff happened same week i was ordering parts so i went with gigabyte instead
I stop buy Asus motherboard after Asus Rampage III Extreme. I see few friends asus board RMA and die after that series. Curently using Gigabyte X399 for more 5 years still going strong.
Oh do I have a story for you. I'm in an 11 month fight now including the CEO about a ROG Maximus XIII EXTREME being broken out of box, got a replacement and it was broken too. Over 100 chat logs, 50+ phone calls and I've had to waste over $1200 getting my pc taken apart and put back together. On a $930 MOBO. And they don't let you do any troubleshooting. I'll share the story if you're ever interested because it's been a hell of a ride.
Brutal. Just brutal.  I just built my system with an asus strix 790-e gaming wifi and 13900ks. So far I've had no problems but choosing a motherboard was a real concern due to so many reviews noting LAN failures, USB problems, etc.  You've got a lot of trust and support from your viewers and hopefully a strong disavowal like this will put some pressure on asus to improve their products and repair their relationships with their customers. Cheers, Jay
I thought this was a click bait title to talk about the ROG Ally....nope 😅
i am sitting with a 7900x on a asus TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI  - the default bioas was that bad about expo, i had to setup the cpu voltoge through the bios, and the expo through ryzen master in windows, only 3 bios-updates made it so the pc would boot in under 1min, but now it is push-10sec-win10-done, as one would expect, and dont start about 3min+ first boots... at least i knew beforehand
So I currently have on order a x670e-f with a 7800x3d. Definitely thinking I should change this after all this going on. What would people recommend as an alternative? Thinking either auros master or msi carbon wifi?
I dont have much to add to this conversation but dropping a like and comment for Jay and his integrity.
I currently have 4 machines with ASUS motherboards, and 2 machines with ASUS graphics cards. I too have had enough with their BIOS bullshit. I trust this channel more than ever and I'm moving on from ASUS.
Good call Jay!   I personally quit buying Asus after they burned me quite badly about 6 years ago (They sent me an "refurbed' board that was split in half and then billed me for it three times)  It will be interesting to see how/if they recover from it.
Thanks Jay I will never purchase another Asus product again.
Evga now asus ;( all these companies I grew up seeing are leaving the scene. It’s sad to see. 😢
I got an asus mobo and GPU 😅
30 years asus fan here. Strictly asus when it comes to mobos especially. I am currently building a pc for someone, as i always do. Installing armory crate, i read the terms. They have been changed. Asus says they are not responsible if you fry your pc using their software... You've confirmed my theory of the past 3 to 4 years of lack of care coming from asus.
This shocks me I have not had issues with them my computer is mostly asus rog strix. 12th gen. MSI I have a punch of issues with there interface program/rgb/update program not finding the items hooked up to it.
Good. They've been treating consumers like shit for much longer than this last generation. It's about time they got the bad press and backlash they've deserved for the last 6+ years.
Motherboards over a 1000 bucks burning and not fixing it bad move Asus
As always, love the content. I've been an ASUS guy for awhile, but this video had made me reconsider a new motherboard manufacturer just for this AMD build
Geesus H Christ you sound like Amber Heard‼️"bla bla bla complain lots bla bla random story bla blaaaa more complaining blaaaaaaa bla‼️
Sad to see that it's come to this. Personally, I've never had an Issue in my personal builds (Thank Jobe!) but their behaviour towards their customers is horrendous. A beta Bios that can potentially fry your CPU with that kind of audacious fine-print? No thanks! If I upgrade my Platform in the coming years and nothing changed on ASUS' end, I'll gladly give other brands a shot.
I'd love to see Jay swap out his ASUS board in his personal system for another brand just to further solidify how bad ASUS's software has become.
Never been a fan of Asus, I reluctantly bought a GPU Asus branded Nvidia,a couple of years ago, that has been absolutely fine (thankfully as it was my first green GPU ever, always been team Red) (and will be going back to red next time) I have had two Asrock motherboards in the past, they have been rock solid and have sold them on for reasonable money. Still using my MSI 970A Pro Carbon, overclocking the hell out of it, while it can be glitchy while finding the limits, it has never ever failed. I need to update from my AMD FX series this year, but it ain't going to be Asus! I want to go for a Ryzen 7600, but I am a little concerned that these could be affected.
Scumbag asus showing their true colors. I’ll be moving on as well.
Why does Jay never use ASrock Boards?  I have had great luck with the last 3 I have purchased.  As for White Motherboards the New Taichi Carrea and Steel are gorgeous.  Yes I have both.  Only thing I hate about ASRock is their Crappy Overclocking and RBG Software.  They need to contract with Lian Li or NZXT
On the Asus z690i motherboard chipset reaches 88/90c, the problem also publicized on the forums, they do not see the problem..
VERY RESPECTFUL Jay, Fuck Asus. Tell them to go kick (As)rock's
Summary of video Dont buy AMD We had the same thing at release of AM3
GITEM JAY
In 6 months he won't remember and will still use asus
Respect for stading whit us Jay . Corporate bull strikes again all they see is money not the consumer
I got lucky. I usually buy Asus, however a last minute design change to my build made me switch to MSI. My brother's build is a ROG asus in the past with no issues whatsoever.
Jay at the end "Asus didnt sponsor me, but ASRock did". LMFAO 😂 ASUS MOTHERBOARDS ARE ROCK SOLID!AMD JUST NEED AN AGESA UPDATE THAT'S ALL. MOVE ON!
WE NEED MORE VEDIO ABOUT AMD FAIL BIOS
Jay at the end "Asus didnt sponsor me, but ASRock did". LMFAO 😂 ASUS MOTHERBOARDS ARE ROCK SOLID!AMD JUST NEED AN AGESA UPDATE THAT'S ALL. MOVE ON!
I’ve been using exclusively ASUS Mobos since the CLSU2 Pentium 3 chips. This is very sad.
Jay I applaud you for what you have done.  Stood up for the rest of us but then again that's always been you and please keeping being you.  As for Asus, they are much like Bud Light - they made huge mistakes and instead of doing the right thing by the customer they are doing the right thing for themselves at the expense of the customer.  I have been a long time purchaser of Asus products and will put them on hold until I get a green light form your channel that they have stopped this bad behaviour and started taking ownership for their mistakes.  Let's hope they don't stick to their guns like Bud Light did that cost them billions in profits and millions in customers.  Asus: Own it, learn from it then move on.
After 16 and a half minutes “that’s all I have to say” (says more). I totally agree though. Complacency is literally what this country seems to be riding on anymore.  I always loved EVGA and it’s unfortunate we’ve lost them as a graphics card brand. ASUS was always a rock solid brand but it is completely horrible how quickly they are to overspend on their product, which drives the cost of the product up to the customer, to then deny almost any problem with said product to save penny’s on the dollar. I’ve sworn off plenty of product myself for the same reason and I totally understand. And I’ll stick with you on this one
Weigh in on this, I had a 7950x at launch and the Asus x670e Hero. Two weeks, it black screened and never came back to posting. Ordered a Taichi to test CPU, and the CPU was dead. I returned both the asus and that 7950x and kept the Taichi and got a new 7950x. As you said, rock solid since the switch
such a shame I used to trust them. I guess it is all MSI and Asrock Tychi.
oh no asus stocks going down?
Asus? More like -Anus- !
Taiwan is Taiwan, Taiwan has nothing to do with China.  Anyhow, I understand your viewpoint and am pretty disappointed with Asus myself.
My Hardwarestore here in germany refused to sell Asus products many years ago so iam on gigabyte since 2017
Gutted i just got an Asus Z790-a which although it is an intel board so it doesn't suffer the AMD issues it is still hampered by the fact that they have not implemented the Intel watchdog so XTU will not work properly and when you use the Asus AI tool that applies crazy cpu voltages that nobody in their right mind would use daily. So effectively that makes the board incompatible with the CPU though their compatibility list says it is. This will be the last Asus board i will buy and if i can afford it i may replace it with an msi board!
Asus psu?
funny thing is i built my rig a year and a half ago ... ended up accidentally building an all ROG system because those are the parts i could get mobo psu and gfx card .. man i am glad mine has been solid ..as a user ive had serious issues with an asus prime b350 board years ago and in the end i was basically told to go pound salt..   as far as asrock i have 4 other systems that are asrock ... all PERFECT have never had an issue 2 PG's and 2 cheapo boards .. never an issue with ram timing/xmp nothing built a new asus motherboard rig to resell and have had hellacious issues with ram timings on it WITH "compatible" ram ... good for you jay!
I'm doing a build tonight with MSI newer x670e Tomahawk, it's an all black board.
I've always used Asus in my builds. I will now change.
So laptop still good?
Their last good product was Dark Hero motherboard.
I hate cancel culture.... But sometimes we need it to humble some companies and people.
"frick"  Seriously, you've earned huge points from your viewers with this video. It's so nice and refreshing to see people turn down money because a company is hurting their consumers. Damn shame for ASUS to be doing this.
AMD is 60% at fault here. I discovered these issues in fringe circumstances in X570 and explained this whole thing to the Engineering Dept, and how to fix. They said they would take a look at it. I was shocked to see it occur in X670... The drops you were experiencing = are chipset issues from X670/X670E. They will also exist in B650.
former geeksquad here.  majority of tech retail products comes from asus.  based on my experience i do not recommend asus products anymore. their Quality Control had gone down so bad
I am running I7-10700KF and upgraded from 32GB to 64GB matched memory. I started getting random freezes in games, Windows cannot load and repairs.  I rebooted and my 2070 would only output to one monitor with the 64GB.  I removed the new 32GB ram and everything works now except I am now unable to run XMP to boost ram to 3600.  I have a 750W gold PSU so that should not be the issue.  Looks like I will be looking for a new motherboard.
Built with an Asus motherboard literally a few days ago. I probably should pull it apart again and return it. Might have to regret it if I don't.. But that's a big thing to do in my world. Tight sff build it took alot out of me. 1.35v soc using expo. And unlucky for me with 7700x there is no non-beta bios to download that limit the voltage to 1.3
Fortunatelly I do not have nor use the top models of mobos and cpus so I never had such problems, both AsRock and ASUS have worked great in my experience. However ASUS and Gigabyte do overvolt the CPUs since Ryzen 1 - at least that I know of. Since that time I started undervolting CPUs and only a bit after that also GPUs, sometimes also overclocking - on any computer I could. This mobo auto-overvolting only became publicly obvious due to the sensibility of X3D chips to voltage. I realized it since Ryzen 1 because temps were too damn high the 65w chips even with more than enough cooling / big radiators, it made no sense, and by undervolting and sometimes also overclocking I'd lower CPU temps by even 15C lower than on stock voltage, wtf.
Huge respect to you Jay, sacking god knows how much sponsorship to stand by your morals. I've actually wanted to put together a new rig built on Asus, then this dumpster fire blew up everywhere. Think I will stick on my current system for a bit longer.
Well that answers that question. Been having problems with sound on an Asus Rog Intel board as well. As you said the sound just drops out for no reason.
So if we remove Asus motherboards, what are better alternatives and how would you ranked them?
Back when Abit was around i hated ASUS's quality.  They really improved there stuff for few years after Abit left the scene.  It seems due to economy asus is going back to there old roots.   I hope influencers like you Jay can get them to straiten there shit out.   I understand it expensive as hell to continue working on boards for 5 years as they said they will.   But if they just rush things and let consumers be the testers thats not right.
It really sucks, my current gaming PC is an Asus prebuilt (with new after market video card), and it's been solid for a decade. I was going to go Asus again to update the motherboard but now I know they aren't the same company.   Thank you for calling them out and being on our side Jay. Keep up the awesomeness.
Wow.  My last build was many many years ago and I trusted ASUS as a brand for the mobo.  Sad to see how they've fallen, but glad I caught this video before my next build.
I believe in ASUS
I respect companies when they say "HEY! We fucked up. Let us fix this!" does WAAAAAY more for their brand name and PR than anything else. Humility is an awesome thing.
Corporate  Greed .  Has went on Steroids  the last few years.
wow after all the support and free stuff theyve given you over the years you jump on the bandwagon and kick ASUS under the bus - just for views! lmfao. Its obvious ASUS fcked up and then fcked up again in the aftermath but they are trying to put things right. IMO the original "we wont accept warrantys" blunder was some over worked, under paid and over stressed employee trying to keep the shit from hitting the fan! ASUS as a company has made and does make some cracking hardware, as you know and this will blow over, people will get replacement, hardware will be fixed and life will go on. It wont stop people buying ASUS and im pretty sure they will get their shit in order sharpish :) After blowing them out like you have i hope they never send you stuff again :) Msg me ASUS, ill review you stuffs :) BTW, not an ASUS user, im Asrock, intel and nVidia ( always have been ), just astonished people take take take and then come out with crap like this!
I used to love Asus motherboards. It's a shame that they have fallen so low.
Glad never like rog lineup , they looks cringe and too much gamery
Everyone shaming asus but no one dunking on amd for not quality control their own partners.
5:18 "they just want you to go away." okay ASUS, i will. "its not me, its you" vibes here. hahaha, well said Jay. great vid!
I think Asus needs to clarify the warranty situation, otherwise there is no way any media can recommend their motherboard products. They certainly shouldn't review them with any non-stock features turned on, such as EXPO.
i was done with Asus products  3 years ago sick of returns and money,  now it  spreads to the motherboards
Now I am worrying about my ASUS Z690-E Gaming WIFI motherboard that I bought last year. 🤔
13:10 guess what jay ASRock is Asus just like how Lexus is a more expensive Toyota. Also i find it funny that after all these years you finally decide Asus is absolutely trash. I have had mosfets on Asus board explode in my face all the way back in lga775 era and since then I have looked the other way.
The irony of ROG calling their new portable device "Ally" is hilarious. Asus isn't an Ally to anyone.   Good luck getting anyone to feel confident spending $700 on a handheld that nobody is confident Asus will RMA if it has a problem. 😂❤  Steam Deck Dream Deck!
nice one  for putting that out jay     not that i been a fan  of asus since intell p4 days   i had nothing but problems with them aand board  and swore to this day i would never touch asus since i havent
I have been using allot of ROG for 8 cpu generations.... it was a good run, time to move on.
I have z690 strix d4, it's not been 100% smooth sailing for sure, this video has convinced me to likely buy ASRock moving forward. The taichi board i had when i was playing around with Ryzen was excellent.
Since the time they had their "Yellow" (socket A) motherboards I was never a huge fan of  Asus, and somehow never trusted this brand. You just confirm what I've always though about it.
Wow, respect for doing that.
This is the only way to get change. Its about time these entitled companies realise that they are nothing without the consumers. Keep going and they will go broke.
Respect 💯 I've been a loyal Asus customer for 20 years but no more ! I'm extremely disappointed with the decline of quality control and customer support. AMD need to have a good talk to Asus because when we build high end AMD builds Asus is usually the mobo of choice.
So Jay, I have a recent ASUS motherboard and have seen such problems. What brand do you recommend I swap to so I don't have to deal with the customer support?
I abandoned asus after my board failed.  It is my first and only mb failure, but it left such a bad taste.  No issues with the MSI replacement so far 🤞
It is really disappointing for me to see ASUS doing this as one of the reasons I used and recommended them was because of the good experience I had with their RMA department.   When my MN2 SLI died from the store and the store had no replacement they sent me a new one within a week.  When my mother's ASUS Transformer T100 got a cracked screen they actually replaced it for free.  When my Dark Hero motherboard got nuked in a freak power surge they sent a new one, no questions asked.  In every instance the process was simple, they didn't ask any questions, and they fixed the problem. I feel that all of these issues that are popping up now has to be due to someone or some group of people in upper management (prob some business major pencil pusher who only looks at numbers) thinking "statically we can let X number if customers be disgruntled because it will be cheaoer to let them be screwed than it would be to resolve their issues". I say this because this isn't the ASUS that I have interacted with before over the years.
ASRock now seeing a spike in sales after this vid
and they just realesed the first gaming frag grenade the ROG Ally
what delusional community here. wth
Boy actually scared now running Asus ROG B650 E-F WiFi with an 7800X3D - till now nothing has happened but who knows ...
I respect this video ! Good job man
I blacklisted them after a couple of QC fails. One was receiving an old gaming laptop from my brother with a a shoddy video cable issue that made the display unreliable. I tore that thing down into parts trying to troubleshoot to no avail. Then I counseled by father to buy one of their MacBook air clones. The battery swelled up and made the keyboard bed bend into a bump. I was able to replace it the battery and make it functional again but then the power brick cable failed. That was it for me. I'm a Gigabyte simp and my son has had good experience with MSI. We had a Coreliquid failure that MSI RMAd extremely quickly with their exchange program.
I ran a itx z170 Asus board. Was my Asus product and had to RMA it. Was one of the most difficult and annoying experiences. Would never buy another Asus product since then.  Been using EVGA and ASRock boards since. I personally messed up and bricked my EVGA z170 FTW and EVGA sent me a new bios chip free of charge.
Don't go Intel, change the board and see if that fixes the issues. What's better than direct experience comparison?
If my x670e strix shits out, good luck to asus for not doing the warranty claim. Ram speeds advertised on the box, it will be an easy lawsuit.
Great I just bought an Asus 1000W PSU 😒
My X670e Hero mobo finally stabilized and runs great now with my AMD 7950x!!  Stay away from the beta bios!!!
Like i said in the other videos on this subject. Ive never bought a Asus motherboard before and i will continue on this trend now FOREVER. Scummy Company
FRICK
Jay stay Jay 😅
I went almost 100% exclusive to using ASUS boards about 10 years ago after having problems with Asrock and others... and ASUS were solid. Then in the past 5 years I noticed issues as well... I had one model of motherboard that would randomly not soft reboot and would lock up. I had 5 of them and within months 2 of them showed the issue in 2 different builds. An RMA came back to me as "no problems found" so I moved to a different board and chalked it up to a compatibility issue with RAM or something. Then in the past 2 years I've built 2 personal rigs for home (AMD Zen3 and Intel 12th gen) and both boards have random freezes, stutters, or otherwise odd issues with RGB controls. I'm thinking my next build needs to go back to MSI or Gigabyte to see how they're doing.  ASUS does seem to have dropped in reliability from 10 years ago. Sad to see such a rise in stature be so quickly followed by such mediocre products and support. This feels very similar to NewEgg... Get to the top and then rest on your laurels. I spent tens of thousands of dollars with NewEgg and now no longer shop there after multiple bad customer service issues and then the resulting fallout made public with GN. I had a defective motherboard denied RMA due to "bent pins" and I know 100% it did NOT have bent pins when I sent it back. My appeal at least was successful but what a bunch of drama.  Like you said... we can offer grace on mistakes or issues, but we judge harshly on how they respond to and own mistakes... and take responsibility. Don't bite the hand that feeds you... eventually that customer money will stop being spoon fed your way.
Jay got ASUSed right in the AMD. Ouch! My ROG Strix mobo and GPU have been rock solid for years. Thank you for bringing this bullshittery to our attention. Will not be buying any more ASUS products until both Jay and Steve confirm ASUS have fixed the problem and fired whoever let the company rot from the inside.
I dealt with their customer service once  and never bought another ASUS product again!      I see you back there EVGA.
What i have to say is that, the best customer service i had was with bequiet! They immediately tried to help me with my problem, when my system didn’t want to boot up anymore. They told me that, while yes the PSU running unusually warm isn’t good, it was the GPUs fault. When i called MSI, the just told me, nah the PSUs broken. End of story: I had to replace both, as my 1000W PSU, was running too warm and couldn’t handle the Wattage Spikes well. And my GPU (RTX 4090 Suprim X btw.) had a dead chip…. After a month of using it, thankfully got a replacement, took them 2 Weeks tho.  I can definitely say that Bequiet has great products AND good customer support. MSI, good product, not that interested in supporting…
I understand the situation, I personally have never had a problem with Asus components, but it happens normally not only to Asus, but also to other companies.. I believe that they will correct the mistakes as always..
Shitz... i'm running a Asus board.... pray hard it doesn't have any issue.
Well the WAN show will be a must watch tonight for Linus' take on the whole debacle. I was about to build a new system using 7800x3d and now i'm stalling as afraid of literally burning money
hooo well and just 4 days ago i bought a x670E for my new 7950x3d chip...do i need to try the beta bios or keep them in the box waiting for an offiacial release? wich kind of problem may i have if i dont update it?
Finally bought my first ASUS board with a x670e-a Strix board for my 7950x build.  Now 50% of the time on boot most of my USB's don't work and my ethernet will not work.  Sometimes it locks up during boot and then after restarting it 2-3 times then it all works without issues.  What can I do?
It really started to sound like a toxic highschool relationship at the end of the video there… 😂 but anyways yea I ditched asus the last build that I’ve had asus is my 12th gen but now ima go with something else.
I’m still buying Asus products. The x3D issue is AMDs IMO.
ASUS just following NVIDIA's lead ....
HELP - Is this the explanation? I have an ROG Crosshair VIII Hero and I am experiencing game crashes here and there which is driving me nuts. The only thing that seemed to help was to clock down my ram from 3600Hz to 3200Hz.  I've been trying to fix this issue for weeks and months and put tons of time into it. I even sent my graphics card through RMA. Anyone else with the same motherboard having similar issues? Then I can maybe finally pinpoint the source of the issue.
I was very disappointed when I bought my ASUS B550 AMD4 mobo  nearly 2 years ago. The manual was so cut down to the basics & didn't cover 90% of the BIOS settings. What made it worse is there is no complete manual online, so how can you find out what all the BIOS settings do, i.e. what I needed to do to activate TPM so that the board was Win 11 ready (I had to google it!)
Rip Asus the world is full of bad decision that are made by stupid ppl i don't understand this at all it's a huge brand with a lot of success Rog Strix was always a good one, but this is just sad. No one should buy anything from them until they change and be more consumer friendly ... iam wondering what der8auer says about this.
Asus is in panic mode. Let them get their shit straight. Its a Corpo. And last thing you can expect from Corpo is a meaningful decisions.
Well, I'm buying ASUS for years now, it's my favourite when we speak about pc parts. In the last ~10 years I had two situations with bad products. First was the 6900XT TUF that broke down after months. I mean, it can happen and I got all my money refunded, so I bought a 4090 instead, I wasn't that mad :D The only 'bad' experience for me was last/this year. I ordered a Z790 Extreme for my new build, right on release in october 2022. I received the board in november and finished the build in mid december 2022 (cause of delivery problems on some parts). And well, what can I say. The board was running 2 or 3 weeks, then it broke down. It grilled the DIMM.2 Slot (at least not my M.2 or the 13900KF...) and two of my four Dominator Sticks. I RMA'd the board in february 2023. It was sent to ASUS and all they could say that it was broken. There was no spare for it, bc the board was already on EOL status, 5 months after release! I got all my money back (we talk about ~1.500€), but I was realy disappointed. I was so happy to have such a board in my PC and I think something was wrong with the Extreme boards too (like the 690 Hero?), otherwise it wouldn't be that fast on EOL status I guess. I bought the Z790 Hero after and I'm very happy with it, at least it can run my new 7800MT/s G.Skill's. But when it comes to bad experineces with ASUS, these were my two I can realy mention when it comes to pc hardware. But I will def never buy peripherales from them again! (other story).
Stick to your guns Jay.  Integrity goes a long way in this biz.
The Rog Ally is completely off the table at this point, I wouldn't trust Asus to support it.
You're a hero Jay. I'm going to build a big home server soon for many different applications, VM's, services, smart home control. This machine has to be damn rock solid. Seems I won't be looking at any Asus gear while all my pc's have Asus boards and cards in them today. Thank you for probably saving me hours upon hours of headaches of time I don't wish to spend troubleshooting faulty stuff.  Jay for President
the last 2 Z790A motherboards i got from ASUS had none of the drivers installed on it.
Can testify to the x670-e taichi (Asrock) being totally solid.  Probably the best board for the money.  After many years, Asus lost me with the ROG strix x570-e - nothing but issues with it.
Do you have any suggestion which bios version is the best right now for Asus motherboards?
I'm not a PC expert by any stretch of the imagination, I have a 9700k and this is my 3rd Asrock board.. Before this I had an i7 980 (1st gen) and lasted 8-9 years with the Maximus III Gene... Now my worry is that I won't find another board for this cpu (9700k) unless I play the ebay lottery.   If I get to upgrade my pc some day there's no way I'm touching Asrock and now after watching this video Asus.
I have a Z790 Hero board and in less than 2 months it completely failed won't even boot to BIOS. I'm running a 13900K, no overclocks no XMP. So far the customer service has been great they are hopefully replacing it under RMA but we'll see they're supposed to get the board today. My Z270 was rock solid and is still going on my 9900k. What happened in just a few years?
I guess my new pc are now postponed, until i find a new brand to replace asus. I also had a comment earlier about asus in anger, sry about that. Im just so disappointed with asus right now and im not sure if i can trust them again. Im using a 10700k with rtx 3080 12gb build with no issues however.
Good for you Jay!
I stopped buying Asus boards after my Intel 5960X system.  Every Asus boards I had owned up until that point all had issues losing USB ports.  EVERY ONE.  I decided I was done dealing with it.
Thanks for the heads up. I'll be in the market for a new workstation soon, and I've historically used ASUS boards pretty consistently through the years. I'll steer clear.
Learn the hard way that AMD stuff is buggy and weird the first generation, invalidating most of the "longevity" when the first gen boards are buggy and have worse memory support. It just make you upgrade more because of how hampered the first gen is.
yes, it's been a nice drama
asus? more like a A SUS-SY Baka
Release a 'fix' that voids the warranty...what??!!  Kudos @Jay for standing up for the consumer.
You should change personal build to MSI or Asrock, stay with AMD and see if things improve. Great test case.
Good thing ASRock split off from ASUS years ago. I’ve had two ASRock boards over the years and  they’re the only ones that never gave up on me; they were literally replaced due to age. I had an MSI board die(my fault) and four Asus boards(not my fault).
I've been having BSOD issues since having an ASUS Motherboard and the affiliated software (Armoury Crate). The problem persists through a fresh installation of Windows 11 and without any good customer service I've not been able to sort the issue. Down with ASUS!!!
I really wanted to buy a new enthusiast level PC in the next 8 weeks and was planning to focus my build around Asus ROG. What a shame..now I have to look elsewhere.
Just AMD crap just remember it is AMD, I notice since z390 ASUS bios problems began. With AMD not knowing what is going on don't help.
Asus were my go to for mobos for my last few builds, my next build was going to be Asus as well, but truthfully I'm done with them. I'll look around a bit more when I finally can afford to upgrade, but I know where I won't be looking.
Fck, now I’m scared … just bought 2x z790 apex I need to check the pins 😅
This is why I switched to msi after my asus 3060 died and I was not able to get an rma due to me living outside the US   note: I had to rma products from evga and msi and that was not an issue
I bought a ASUS ROG Strix X570-F Gaming motherboard november 2019 and everything was working perfectly until sometime last year when i my mic started picking up voices from Youtube and games and so on.. Been testing with different headsets, both wired and wireless but nothing seems to help.. Starting to think it was a bios "update" that screwed me over.. That or the Realtek sound drivers.. And when i plug in my card reader so i can transfer pictures from my camera it disconnects my headset usb dongle.. The joy.
My X570 Dark Hero board has consistent issues when using the 5800X3D and unfortunately ASUS support was thoroughly unhelpful. 100% L for me to eat.
I dont believe I've purchased any ASUS products for my recent (and 1st ever) PC build.  And after seeing this, I'm making damn sure it stays that way.
thats funny i stop buying Asus Motherboards because Newegg sent me 3 broken ones bad pins etc they said to me they fixed it and they lied 🤥 i bought a MSI motherboard and been happy ever since. that is crazy. everything i paid for was out of pocket. i agree Asus needs to step there game up and be legit
Glad I saw this video. I had an Asus motherboard in my parts list. Just switched it for a Gigabyte. I didn't realize Asus had gotten so bad.
I had all kinds of issues with my Asus X670e. Issues with EXPO RAM, underperforming cpu benchmarks, weird blue screens. I finally switched to a Aorus Master X670e and all my issues were fixed instantly. @jayztwocents just swap to a different brand and see if it fixes your issues also.
It's a sad situation. Asus used to be one of the ones I'd look for back in the day. I even still have two Asus boards in service....a Socket 370 in my Windows 98 machine, and a 775 board in a rig that refuses to die, haha.  You're totally right about Asrock - that have been working hard to lose their old reputation, and I've been really happy with their boards over the last 8-10 years I've used their stuff.
Yeah I got white liquid cooling from strix and gigabyte motherboard. I asked asus how to connect the RGB fans to the motherboard and the response was "Since you don't use Asus motherboard we can't help you". After that I've decided not to buy Asus products EVER again!
the "keep your (STUFF)" had me laughing my ass off....
These are expansive Motherboards and at least you get an apology etc in US or EU. Every where else on the earth these manufactures treat their customers as "you should be happy that we sold you this stuff... Now shoo away and do never come back unless you want to sell your kidney again". No support whatsoever.
Well this is a little scary.I just won a fantastic top of the line computer,and it has ASUS TUF Z690 plus wifi DDR5 motherboard in it.I guess I should be thankful I'm not computer literate enough to go messing with over clocks and timing.Thank you for the heads up on this.
I was about to go full asus for my build, I guess I'll go for an other brand
I hope this debacle has many reconsider picking up the *ROG Ally*  because will that be supported in the future? Will a BIOS update on that brick my handheld? Again they are different departments but probably closely related but only time will tell. Personally waiting for the next Steam Deck, as that would be the better play because its Valve, repairable, has track pads, etc.  With that being said Gigabyte motherboards you've done me well over the years, but I do own a decent amount of ASUS hardware (few motherboards, gpus, etc) and they've done the job but I can tell they really just don't care anymore, so I won't either.
You wouldnt believe how much shitty software Asus has been putting out recently. Armory crate? Such a half-asused piece of software.
The rot from late-stage capitalism is showing everywhere.  Some big wig is floating around on their mega yacht smoking a huge cigar whilst generating massive profits on the back of dedicated customers.  As long as the bottom line is steady and profits are churning, quality doesn't matter!
This is so peak!  I went for ASUS crosshair for my 7950x3d build because you had it in your system and now all these issues that are arising. Does anyone know what bios I should be running that won’t ruin my cpu?
damn I wish I knew all of this before I just built me new PC with a ROG Strix B760-F and a Asus ROG Thor 1000W with a Intel i7 13700k, fingers crossed that it goes smoothly
This is upsetting as I built my first pc 2 years ago and have 2 asus tuf products and have been satisfied with them, but then they do this kinda stuff and it'll never be out of my mind in future purchases. Shame.
i owned X-570 TUF GAMING plus, the blue screen is a 'regular" thing hahah basically anything usb related- mouse, speaker, keyboard, when the software of those peripheral try to do something "tricky" it will pop a blue screen hahaha never happened during a game! as long as i dont tab out or bring up anything weird
Thank you for being transparent. This is exactly what consumers need to hear!
after finding out about this Asus bs I thought it would be a good idea to check out my auto settings so I went into my bios (z370 tuf gaming ii with 9600k and 32gb of 3600mhz ram) and discovered that auto was feeding my cpu VCCIO Voltage 1.4v it now is set to and stable at 1.15v and my System Agent Voltage was at 1.42 it is now set to and stable at 1.20v both of those auto settings are very high it makes me wonder if they have been bumping up the auto voltages on the boards going back longer than this fiasco
I wouldn’t even use an ASUS motherboard for soldering practice
Honestly, I used to stand by ASUS products pretty strongly... If this is how theyre going to treat their customers, then I will find another brand. This video makes me wonder if all of my issues with my AMD computers, are leaving ASUS to blame. My 3700x is seemingly slowing down quite a bit.... Doesnt even make sense. Makes me think its the mobo.   Sad to see such a good, reliable brand-name get thrown into the trash like this... Especially when I am currently dropping Corsair as well. Not sure how I plan on having any single-program aRGB computers if I am dropping the only 2 that actually play nice together...  At this point, I think my next build will just be a noctua beast. Paint the case wood colored/textured, and just go all air, no RGB. As nice as RGB builds look, I would rather see the computer function properly. I guess I didnt realize I was taking performance hits by using aRGB hardware.
"stuff"
I posted this on HU's channel but I'll repeat it here:  I contacted ASUS and noticed the disclaimer in their quick fix bios that basically said if I use it and something breaks it's my own fault. I questioned this and asked them specifically which BIOS I should use, they told me in writing not to use the beta BIOS. I used thier AI software to set an SOC voltage limit of 1.3v myself.  With the SOC voltage limit manually set I turned on Expo1 again. Interesting observation, the cpu ran to 5050 MHz when I originally set Expo1 to on (before the problems surfaced) but with the limit applied it runs to 4800 instead. This suggests the voltage may have been exceeding 1.3v previously on my system. I'm also running 5600 MHz RAM, which was an intentional purchase choice, and the lower speed made help but I couldn't say that with any authority.
the news coverage on the rog ally might become more interesting *grabs popcorn*
Too bad this has happened, I feel bad for those with AMD based ASUS boards.  I built a brand-new system with the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero, I9-13900K, Asus Tuf GForce RTX 4090, and 64GB of G.Skill Trident  6400 DDR5 , running XMP.  No issues, have run multiple stability tests stressing both the CPU and GPU to the max, and zero issues.  Running a month now, so far so good.  Maybe the Intel boards are better quality?
Liked ASUS. Unfortunate. But I don't anymore.
Thank you for spreading the word Mr TwoCents :)
Man thats sad to see. I have an ASUS TUF RX 6800XT which I am really happy with, firstly because its one of two GPUs that would fit in my bequit 500DX with a frontmounted 360 AIO and secondly because rips through everything on 1440p. Guess ASUS just got complacent like Intel when they where marketleader except Intel had no competition and their product still worked.
One of the streamers I watch had the same sound and connectivity problem as you described. I'd have never guessed that it might be a motherboard problem. Thanks for the insight and your work, keep up what you doing Jay.
I almost never reply to YouTube video's (I do like and subscribe) but THANK YOU Jay! You are saying what I was thinking the last few weeks! Build a 7950X system few weeks back, I just emailed the supplier what their position is on it all because I refuse to install BETA Bios from Asus and I want RMA for the motherboard AND CPU because of it running 1.35 to 1.4v SoC last three weeks what probably would have got it degraded out of my knowing and will because of Asus mistakes!
Ouch!, now to see if LMG will follow your example since they also get a ton of sponsorship from them.
Gigabyte, NewEgg, Asus , Nvidia there are many others not it the tech world too like the cell phone battery debacle catching fire. Milwaukee tools has had a lot of complainants they ignore. What do you do ? Move on and tell others there products suck, word of mouth is all we have.
just eliminated all ASUS options from my new build design, thanks!!!
I honestly always have had good luck with asrock and Msi motherboards.  In years past my asus boards had blown cap issues within a few years.
Fuck Asus and their management .I have got Asus Prime  470
Wow sounds like you've dodged a bullet not having finalized a contract with (half) AssUs!  Nvidia isn't respecting the consumer space and now Asus is heading down the same path. Other brands will gladly take their place and let them feel it where it hurts most, in the wallet.  I've researched components for a new build back in january and also found a lot of complaints about Asus, it really seems to have fallen out of grace. Glad I went with MSI again, has been rock solid.
Great Video! I upgraded my Rig with a 7th gen ryzen, and instead of asus I went with a gigabyte board. The Bios and RGB Software is a complete mess compared to my last Asus Prime x470 Pro. But the system is workin fine afterall. After seein this Video my Choice got reasonable. Glad I didnt put my money on the wrong horse.
damn  it! My whole system is Asus :/
Jay weird question but if you guys have so much x670e rog boards can I maybe buy one?
So Jay, what would you recommend consumers do at this point?
Asus is a cashgrab for the last years anyways. And after z490~ they care less and less, just slap a logo on and go, and their support is the worst.
EVGA quitting the GPU market and now this... Tragic...
damn i just pre-ordered the Asus ROG Ally i hope it doesn’t blow up in my face.
Just bought an X670E Crosshair Hero... Think I will return it and get something else.
ASRock... is the mobo company everyone who actually use will stand for. For the same price ASRock always provided more and all ASRock boards I used (and I mostly used ASRock boards!) were stable as rock. UEFI on ASRock is very nice with sensible layout and they even added ReBar to older boards just in case someone wanted them now and not with new platform. My last board could OC non-K chips apparently because ASRock thought adding separate clock generator might come in handy to some people and this was one of the cheapest Z390 boards in the market. Wow, just wow! And Assus... used those too, but I remember they had high failure rates when I worked at computer shop. Probably because this overvolting thing was always going on just to have them score higher maximum overclock in reviews when they compare maximum stable overclock. This time they failed badly and they failed on multiple fronts. Heck, from AMD drama it became Assus drama... good for them I guess. Apparently any publicity is good even if its bad XD
Honestly I have a Flow X13 and a Zenfone 9. I love Asus for their ideas and that they actually try new stuff. But on the software side and customer support side of things....not great. The X13 needed multiple Bios ersions to function properly. The Zenfone has some bugs too and recently many buyers complain about the fancy camera breaking. Support always is like: Tried factory reset? Newest Version? no no no ... we aren't aware of a problem.... must be you. This sucks. I get it, sometimes there are problems and they need time to be fixed but come on, atleast a little bit of trancparency would not hurt.
Considering Asus generally charges more for the same tier of product, it is absolutely insane to not have top tier customer support. Great example of a company taking a great brand reputation and milking it to the ground.
Asus dropped the ball for me with the 680i Striker Extreme mobo. I have never bought another Asus motherboard point blank period. They never redeemed themselves in my eyes.
ive been having issues with asus mobos the last year or so, im glad im not the only one with  random stability issues. im lucky i havnt cooked cpus
Oh it's frigging sad that it came to this! C'mon Asus, put your shit together! I would go for a X670E-Pro WiFi but now... Nope!
Damn Jay! Much respect!
I have had my asrock taichi x99 motherboard running since the beginning of 2017 practically nonstop aside from cleaning here and there and reapplying thermal paste this year and it has ran superb the whole time.  Plus I have my 6850k overclocked from the 3.6 up to 4.6ghz which is really high for that chip.
I e stopped using Asus for the past 5 years I like gigabyte belive it or not
Thanks for your honesty. I had no idea any of this has been happening. Been living under a rock. I'll be staying away from them until they humble themselves. Which is really disappointing because I love their aesthetics
Wow. I have a Prime B450. It is a solid cheap mobo that connects everything I need it to. Really sad to see Asus go down this path because they have done me right for so many years. Oh well.
Good on you Jay! Respect! 👍
It sucks that it's come to this. Hopefully they fix their stuff. I'm not so worried about the ASUS problems for my current system which is Intel, but I can say whenever I decide to upgrade or get something new, ASUS is not going to be in it.
Great… EVGA and ASUS gone… my two brands for every build I’ve ever done.. at least I can still get mobo’s from EVGA
I quit using ASUS after they turned into jerks about their RAM vendor requirements for their boards.
I almost just bought an ASUS board thinking they were one of the best, glad I got the MSI MAG Z690 Tomahawk, sick of Gigabyte
Well done sir. Well done
These companies get so big, they forget about the consumer for profit. They forget that the consumer is what makes that company successful.  Jay has almost 4 Million subscribers.  If each one of those subscribers returned one of their $300+ Asus motherboards, or say $700+ for that fact, that's potentially 1.2 billion profit dollars they're missing out on.  In the end, do they really care?  Nope!  I Almost went with AsRock for a build and they have gotten better over the years I applaud them. Just my 2 cents... Thanks Jay
Asus is the largest manufacturer by a mile for many pc components. Makes sense that they have been highlighted has having the most problems. They handled the latest issues poorly, granted but I don't think they should have been removed from your channel. Based on the items they gave you for free (which looks to be a crazy amount), it might be a tough road for your future builds, to work with the other much smaller brands and their own issues. Gigabyte and MSI have been stepping it up as of late, so hopefully they continue to improve. I do hope Asus fixes their stuff and takes ownership of their past mistakes.
Thanks for the video.  I have been thinking of upgrading from my 5950X system with MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk.  This video gives me two schools of thought.  1.  My MSI board has been pretty reliable and fast.  2.  I have contemplated going back to Asus...but not now.  I have an Asus TUF 4070 TI, which I am very happy with...but perhaps until they get their collective act together...I will stick with MSI and perhaps give another vendor a shot.   This is a prime time for EVGA to step in and do something pro-active.  It takes guts to stand up...kudos for that!
ASUS is the new Bud Light
As a PC gamer, I used to LOVE ROG Stuff. For me, it was the top of quality, performance, and reliability. The price was justified. Some time ago my brother asked for a recommendation about a GPU and as always, I recommended an RX5700XT STRIX that unfortunately for those who remember, ASUS didn't couple the heatsink well to the DYE and blamed AMD, publically. After that, ASUS started to take lessons from another dirty company called MSI. I recently built an AM5 system and for me and maby out of habit, I choose a B650E-I Strix Gaming Wi-Fi, and guess what??? I spent a ton of money on quality components like Noctua fans and EK AIO to have a very silent system. Everything runs perfectly silent, cool, and smooth but the shitty ASUS motherboard has a terrible COIL WHINE. From now on I say F U ASUS and MSI.
And get rid of that armoury crate shit as well. All I need is something to control the RGB and fan profiles, fuck the rest of it off.
Why motherboard and never fatherboard? Do fatherboards exist? Like I have seen daughterboards but never sonboards. Genuine question. Sorry, new to building.
This is really sad. I have used ASUS motherboards (and GPUs) exclusively since the 90's. If I can no longer depend on them, where do I go?
I always avoided Asrock and because of esthetica I went for an Asrock Steel legend and it works like a charm!
Sad,   I build a full blown STRIX  build maybe 5 years ago.  Super high end 600$ mobo,  3080ti,  strix 360 AIO, STrix Thor PSU.     Because back then  Asus was still really solid.   The parts all went together perfectly,  no issues,  the PC runs 8+ hours a day with an overclock.      Sad to hear that they are struggling :/
I was thinking of upgrading my platform but the whole thing makes me just kind of uneasy. Upgraded to a 5800x3d and I'm just going to be happy lol
perfect to live in Norway - 5 year warranty no matter what
i used to build most systems with asus mobo. Last 2 were z690 dark kingpin and the current is z790 classified. customer systems have gotten almost exclusively msi
I believe ASRock started becoming a stronger brand during the first generation of Ryzen with the X370 Taichi. It was one of the most popular sellers during that time. I don't know if this is true or not but I heard that they were a part of Asus?
TDLR?
Asus has been a brand of choice for me for the longest time. But I have noticed the lack of polish lately, with a couple AM4 boards that I have. I've had my PC randomly refuse to POST until a failsafe kicks in and it loads defaults. I'm going with a different brand next upgrade. Sorry Asus, ya blew it.
I use to be an ASUS fanboy. Purchased many laptops over the years. But even I have noticed the quality of their products have go down hill. Have a 2007 laptop still rocking. New 2021 already dead with bad mobo. No more.
Based on what you have been going through with asus it explains what I have been and now know I need to get rid of my asus motherboard asap
This is "an open letter to JayzTwoCents", your memory controller is inside you CPU, how are you going to blame a motherboard manufactor for building a motherboard up to the specs of AMD, maybe they got wrong info from AMD and the boards are up to spec but the CPU isn't, the recent problem isn't only on ASUS motherboards... Also complaining getting wrong or damaged free stuff isn't be really impartial and i'm sorry this doesn't suit a hardware reviewer, Gamer Nexus based his conclusion on intewl gathered, also the cause of the flaw isn't determined yet to be ASUS fault at this point, it's a combination of 2 parts, as far as i see it they state not to turn on overclocking features as off now, because it's a "beta" bios...
Was planning on upgrading but this has kinda thrown me have been an AMD guy since my first build but last night left me wondering if i should make the jump over to Intel?
Unfortunately. I used mostly asus GPUs and motherboards in the past.
Ditched ASUS a decade ago, and never looked back, by far the best thing I did.
Wasn't that long ago that ASUS was considered the go-to brand for quality and durability...my how times have changed.
I used to love ASUS but recently had to rebuild few PC's with problematic ASUS ROG boards as they were unable to boot XMP, loosing connection to GPU and ASUS was no help at all, the only luck I had that they were bought from amazon and I had chance to return them. I know some people say Gigabyte customer service is bad but I had nothing but positive experience with them here in UK, they even repaired crashed BIOS motherboard that was 6 months out of warranty, I only had to cover shipment cost. So for me Gigabyte is the brand from now on.
Thanks for keeping it real Jay. Call it like you see it. Shipped bad product 3 times is bad. No contract in MAY! Yea, good call saying goodbye.
i have had to return 3 6800xt's to be rma'd everytime a new issue i currently have a card that was just DOA from the rma center after i paid to get it fast tracked
"Thank god it went down the way it did, I got an MSI board in there" is kinda funny seeing how MSI was assassinating it's own character with bad products like 12-18 months ago....
Made in China........Made in China.......Made in China...........imagine they just hate the USA because of the ongoing trade wars since Trump was in office?
I have used Asus for years and have the Asus B550 ROG Strix B550 Wi-Fi motherboard. I've never had an issue with the hardware or software. Are you throwing the entire ASUS company under the bus or just the cutting edge new stuff?
Intel Shill No one cares you’re leaving Asus…unsubbed because your channel is full of misinformation anyway …see ya
Wow - was about to get an ASUS for my 13900k - now looking at MSI - but they had the firmware hack - so confused what to get now…
Asus should rename themselves from Republic of Gamers to Republic of Garbage and TUF to The Ultimate Fire, and Prime series to Prime E-wastes
JTC, I watch, Steve and Linus, but I make my buying decisions weighted on your opinion. So help me out, MSI, Gigabyte, who should the silver haired Gen X peeps trust for the next 20 years, or at least 20 months.  Thank You for always "keeping it real"
Well, that sucks... was looking forward to that Rog handheld that's coming out. Clearly not if their quality is lacking. Especially for 700 bucks...
Hi Jay wow. I had a 3770 system cable Co killed it with a  virus now a ASRock with i5 10400 running 3.9ghz 3rd ASRock system might try them Asus was doing this years ago with displays
I have constant usb problems and I have asus ROG x299 extreme at cost on purchasing was around £1000
this is the reason when i built my new gaming rigg i went with Gigabyte, both motherboard and graphic in 3 years i have not had a single bluescreen nor any malfunctions, Asus used to be the OG brand now they are just the DOG of the brands, Asrock and Asus traded places Asrock is now OG and stay as far away from asus as you can. GG Asus
Well damn, now I need to find another brand for my future mini itx pc, any recommendations are appreciated
Well done and thank you Jay for looking out for the consumer!  Without the consumer a company is nothing!
I am suffering my b650-plus for 6 months, no way EXPO would work correctly. I will never buy any ASUS product again
I have an ASUS TUF GAMING B550M-PLUS (WI-FI), Socket AM4 motherboard . I did play normally and then all of the suddenly one of the ram slot got fried :D it did take me a lot of time try-ing to find out why my PC stop (because the LED error show that there is a GPU problem :D ). 3 mounth old motherboard.
I remember 2014 when ASUS was literally THE BEST. This is sad.
Plc I know its not about the subject but can you pls helps us to found out what is going on with the "4090 RTX - crashing/black screen" There so many users with this problem! It is a shame for such as expensive card having this kind of problem!! Is there anything that we can do aiming to solve the problem! Thank you...
Of course I just slapped an Asus Maximus Extreme into my newest build lol. I love it, minus the mandatory Armoury Crate software. Needless to say, going back to MSI as soon as possible.
This is just another spin on the bigger issue at hand... Beyond computers and just in general. Maaaaany companies in various industries ever since COVID have been a dumpster fire. Blame part of it on a lot of these corps firing everyone and then having to get talent back has been a detriment. And with the cost of everything skyrocketing and profitability falling off of a cliff, it is no wonder us as the consumer get screwed on quality AND price. So we pay more for less and then when there is an issue, ultimately it is our fault. Over time, this will get better and the companies that ultimately give a shit will be the ones that are left. Kudos to you standing by what you believe is right and being a consumer at heart. Bad business is always bad business no matter what way you cut it.
so you buy a motherboard and its messed up so the company puts out a bios update to fix that problem and it makes a bigger problem but its not the company that put out the bios and motherboard fault? its exactly their fault. Solely their fault! id never but that brand after seeing this and im currently looking for replacements for ALL of my ROG gear.
Maybe I'm the odd man out here, but I don't really see an issue with Asus putting legal disclaimers on beta bios versions.  I understand that the issue needs immediate attention, but I've been working in tech for a long time, and have seen a lot of beta firmware versions for things that generally come with a disclaimer saying "This could damage your device, and it will not be covered under warranty if you use it".  They make the beta versions so people can test them, not so the masses can use them as something that's "In production".  If you're willing to be in the test group, then generally you understand the risks.  I don't blame Jay for cutting ties with ASUS, but being mad about them putting a disclaimer on their BIOS feels like average redditor energy.
Maybe Steve just had some hair between his chip and the socket? No idea where it came from tough........
Not that long ago Steve was burying MSI's dragon in the ground now the MSI is good but ASUS sucks, a nice shitstorm seems to be a mandatory component of the "gaming HW scene".
Wow i was going to build new pc on asus board next week thank you  for information  ❤
A long time ago I had an asus issue & swore them off. I thought about how that was unreasonable & was just starting to consider them for my next build. I appreciate how they made this decision easy.
Screw ASUS. Rat bastards.
Maybe switch to intel. I have an asus tuf gaming z690-plus wifi with an i5 12600k with kingston fury beast RGB 16GB (2×8GB) ddr5 ram 5200mhz (xmp on) and everything runs fine and stable.
"The longer you sit on the throne, the more you sink in"; that's Asus issue right now
Asus should put their shit together this time.
I've literally been an Asus brand loyalist for years. My motherboard literally started having voltage issues. I've updated my bios twice still, it would fix the issue for 3 days before the issue returning.  Now I am seeing this by chance. I am so done with them.
Good job Jay!
Crying when free 600-1000$ mb has some scratches? the audacity lmao
i live in japan my water cooler ryujin 2 360 had a problem i got in touch with asus, she didn't even answer my email, asus never again ]
"For those who dare" literally
I am tempted to see if Microcenter will allow me to exchange my Asus Prime X670E with another brand.
I'm getting real nervous about the Maximus Hero I just bought. Is there any way we can tell if their Intel side is having similar problems?
huge respect to Jay  for doing this.
My 2013 X79 build was Asus Rampage IV Extreme (3930K) and it was good...  My 2020 X570 build is on ASROCK X570 CREATOR (5950X. it works <point> I left ASUS mostly because I know I need my boards not for OC-ing but high end work, and this ASROCK did it's thing for me.   I have seen ASUS as relative good boards for years, but... Seemingly this is over. Honestly I do not need a 1200,-- board anyways.   I prefer aircooling and basics (50% of max ram, enough storage, high end, but not top tier GPU (for(dual)1440p) and being able to do anything and walking away, coming back and forgetting all is still up and playing a game then remembring I have these 9 programs still running....  Can't have a crashing PC if everything is just spinning and its image is kept around in RAM.   I owned Gigabyte, Asus and Asrock parts. Gigabyte had the GPU's; that were 2% slower but affordable, Asus was mobo's and Asrock were replacement parts, Ram from reputable brands, Drives used to be mostly  WD, but with Nvme SSD 4th gen I dropped those, I have 2 early 2 gb Nvme pcie 4.0  and a 4 Gb Sata SSD now. Never have to wait, fast... Gigabyte Nvidia GPU 3080ti (cheap). I commented on channels before, I'll see if PC building still exists when this one runs out. 5-7 years uptime for me. Budget is ~2500-3000 for the whole system, and with 1200,-- mobos and 2000,-- GPU this will not happen again. Still have an optical ;) still have things which require one. And my kid can watch old DVD's from the library.
So sad. Honestly.  Always been a huge Asus fan.
the only company I want to see fall right now is Nvidia. their arrogance and lust for screwing the budget oriented customers the frikin budget oriented customers is off the charts
Returned my 650 Rog mb as iy was faulty lucky i got via amazon would never buy ASUS again. I will stick to MSI or Gigabyte for motherboards.
EVERY company now cuts production costs, its not about the quality but about the quantity. Asus, mercedes, your nearest Hospital, nobody gives a fuck about the costumer anymore!
Honestly, this entire thing makes me wonder if the problem I literally JUST EXPERIENCED an hour ago, a motherboard hang where I had to reset my computer via the power supply switch (and a problem I've experienced one other time in the five years I've been running the board), is because I'm running an Asus motherboard. To be specific, a STRIX B450-F.  It's an issue I've barely had to deal with, but the fact that I'm *asking that question now* makes me really want to start thinking about getting a new motherboard! That I definitely can't afford right now.
This makes me miss EVGA that much more
Can you do a review on the asus prime z790p?
Wtf happened to asus they used to be such a reliable brand with one of the lowest faulty hardware return rates in the industry.
I appreciate you keeping your channel and these mega corps honest to us consumers. Any ideas on who may take Asus slot going forward? MSI? ASRock?
had 2 asus products, motherboard and gpu.... looks nice, qc is trash. I dont buy asus (or msi) since 7 years+.
yeh I gave up on Asus a decade ago
I have a AM5 Socket using a X680 Tuf Gaming Plus WIFI...I picked it because I had such a great experience with the ASUS Deluxe Board and ASUS X570 TUF Gaming board for my AM4 build.  I'm having my doubts on this board though.  I've been an ASUS person for YEARS, but if I move away from this board, it won't be an ASUS replacing it.
I will Never buy Asus stuff again
Been a fan of Asus for 20yrs. Good bye Asus.
Bought a b450f board less thab 3 years ago and it just went bad! Took me almost a year to biy another one which is again asus b550-f gaming and again am seeing issues with the board when i turn it on, it doesn't come on right away the asus rgb logo on the board blinks continously fir 20 seconds before i can actually turn it on...
1:30 The reasons you listed are the exact reasons I did not build an Asus system this go-round and will not build with any Asus products.  I've built computers for other people in the past and I cannot recommend anything from Asus any longer. So many RMA's, so many random hiccups through installation, etc.
Solid confidence to YOU Jayz !
wow good point. For my next build I need a motherboard that I can connect a water temp sensor to. Only found asus ones, any recommendations?
So what will Linus TT say?? 😱😱🤣🤣🤣
This is the time EVGA to step in the MOBO market with full force and dominate
Curious if ASUS responds.  When I built my system last year my ASUS ROG STRIX Z-690E was one of the recommended boards. So far, it's been fine, and I've been happy with it.
I always use to buy Asus mobo's, I mean my Asus p8z68-v pro, is still going strong to this day, and I use that computer every day, and that motherboard i believe is almost 10+ years old. Never had any issues, really sad to see a decline in quality
Thanks for putting us first!!!
this is sad, asus use to be my favorite compant due to everything they use to stand for
Jay you are the best. U are the father figure on youtube when it comes to tech for me i like how open and thoughtfull u are. I hope that thjs wont effect your buisiness.
Really pity to hear these news :-( I have their 2 mATX budget mobos from 2014(1150) and late 2015 (1151) working since those times. Asus, how could you? 🥵🥵
Always been a fan boy for asus on all my builds but I'll think twice from now on! Thank you Jay. Respect!
If Greed Meets Incompetence! you got ALL the new modern companys today :D
My ASRock Mobo went bad about 3 months after I built my PC and started completely destroying my BIOS slowly and they wouldnt RMA it for me. I will never go for another ASRock part again.
Well glad I got Asus right before they became absolute crap. Lets hope this helps them change their shit.
I can't believe the that the "avoid the brand" Asrock is now more stable and has better build quality than his evil brother Asus. My Asrock B350 Fatal1ty is still serving me until now and probably up to two years more. It started it's life having 1600x, now has a 5600 and I plan to upgrade it to 5800x3d for my wife to use for her work and might server her up to for years to come. I can't believe that this would be my longest serving system since I started building my own PC, it would be 6 years and counting. Good job to Asrock in proving itself that it is deserving for us to give them confidence in their product. Too bad Asus joined Intel in being too complacent, they basked themselves too much on their past glory and sat too long on their laurels of previous success.
So much respect to Jay and team. I've always gravitated to asus products but with such anti-consumer behavior that's the end of that. Thank you and all the other tech youtubers who raise awareness and protect us as consumers from becoming victims.
看得出来你很愤怒，实际上我来告诉你发生了什么，华硕是台湾国民党的军方项目，而台湾国民党背地里又和中国共产党是一家的，也可以说华硕是中共的项目了，这听起来有些难以置信，跟共产党走在一起的团体和公司他们所有产品的出发点都会发生偏离，是为了腐败和权力服务的，而不是消费者。华硕自满于他在中国大陆市场取得的成功，实际上这是一种跟共产党的交易。以便于在主板中添加一些什么，比如监控电路。
As someone who wants to upgrade their PC fully in a long time, which manufacturer's products should I get? Gigabyte?
The problem is, they are all doint things like these and it's just that some issues are discovered with one brand in this generation and other issues with the other brand in the other generation. I would never put any of that stuff behind MSI or Gigabyte, while I abolutely don't like Asrocks board design for quite some while.  Just finally ordered an ASUS Prime X670E-Pro Wifi because it's the only AM5-Board with Gen5 PCIe and two x4-Slots. Fingers crossed.
Respect Jay!
I'm so glad i didn't go with Asus when I built my first pc. I went with MSI and havent had any regrets at all.
I was planning on using a Asus PRIME B650-PLUS mobo for my next upgrade in a few months, any recommended replacements?
Yes! I agree 100%! Their tech support is a disaster, Thunderbolt add-in card didn’t work for me, garbage.
my how the mighty have fallen.
Hoping this makes Asus turn it around, been using asus for all of my motherboards the last 6 years and has been great, but I haven't had any of the stuff from their latest generations. Will not be buying a new asus Mobo until they figure it out
which is why i never use or try to avoid much as i can with any asus products. i prefer evga board and gpu. but since evga gpu are no longer available i would go with amd sapphire
ive ditched asus long time ago .... to many bad board's experience.
I feel quite scammed, I recently builded my first build put the strix b550-f in with good feeling that asus is quite good company, but the opposite is true and I didn't really saw that until now, and I'm scared that my motherboard can be faulty, I know this video is regarding the newer ones and my motherboard is from the older version so it seems like I don't have to be scared that much but still
Massive respect!
Asus should care about losing a youtuber with 3.88 Million subs. thats 3.88 people he may be influencing to not buy their products anymore. But! Jay is right and they probably wont care. I think the Rog Ally will be the last product i buy and even that im debating on canceling the preorder. cant keep letting companies get away with stuff like this and the only way they will listen is by hurting their wallet
but asrock also part of asus group 😂
I haven't been following recent events so this is news to me. Good to know Asus isn't what it once was
Remember Creative Labs?  They had phenomenal products, were top in the space at the time, but also failed.  Why?  Because they also thought they were too mighty and failed to adapt when competitors did better than them (mainly Apple).  If these other mb mfg's are putting out better products now than Asus AND offer better support, it's only a matter of time before Asus becomes another Creative Labs.
Hmm im worried about ROG ally mobo quality now
I mean I’ve personally only ever bought rog stuff, gpu’s,mobos, etc. Never had an issue. I plan on upgrading to a 5090 or whatever it ends up being called from my strix 3090 and get a new mobo kit around the time it releases. I’ll keep this in mind and see if it improves by then
I just bought a Asus Motherboard, a Z690-Plus D4, because I never had problems with Asus. Is there any known issus with these? PS: What alternative is currently good for an i7-13700 ?
After my RMA experience with ASUS in early 2020 I refuse to buy anything from them. They immediately blamed me for “abusing” the board and when I asked for a picture they showed me thee smallest bit of paint missing from the corner of the board. That told me that their priority is to search for anything that could void the warranty. They had the nerve to ask if I wanted to pay for a refurb lol.
I stopped using Asus Mobo's back in the Phenom 2 days, I'd done around 3 or 4 builds and every one lost audio, I'd stopped with  Gigabyte before that and have been using MSI for some years now with no issues
So, I have a Prime x670e-pro current BIOS version 1223 updated on april 2 (most uptodate is 1413 as of 4/28) and a AMD 7950x. Currently when i turn on EXPO, my PC will be fine the whole day, once I turn off the computer and turn it back on a couple hours later i keep on getting the DRAM light on the motherboard. To be able to boot i have restart multiple times over and over again. Over these restarts the CPU light turns on or sometimes the GPU light turns on. So after a week of having this issue (i build my pc april  2) i decided you know what let me turn off EXPO. Ever since turning off EXPO my PC boots everytime. Another issue ive been facing is devices disconnecting sometimes, such as my mouse, here i was thinking my devices were going bad but turns out its just ASUS after you mention your issues!? oh and dont get me started on the bluetooth. it just doesnt work at all...
THat's good Jay, my asus tuf b650 was dead at arrival.
Such an annoying situation.. We lost EVGA.. now i dont know who i want to buy my next GPU from.  But now we have lost confidence in such a LONG standing *trusted* manufacturer...
Glad i bought an AsRock board for 13th gen, btw Jay, the AsRock Riptide had a black and purple version its called the 'LiveMixer'.
Thank you for this vid Jay, any thoughts on SuperMicro? Never see them mentioned by any of the bigger YouTubers. They got some consumer boards.
Thank you Jay for your truths and your hard work! Much appreciated!!!!!
My last PC had a Gigabyte board and an AMD FX8350 CPU and it still works even now! I upgraded to an Asus B550F board and a Ryzen 9 5900 and the CPU died in 9 months, even though I hadn't overclocked it! This was the first time I've used an Asus board in the last 20 years. I've now gone back to Gigabyte and a Ryzen 5 5600X and it's been going just over a year now with no issues what so ever!  I was thinking of upgrading to the newer Ryzen 7800X 3D, but now Asus is now no longer in my short list. Thanks Jay (and Steve) for saving me from a potential disaster!
RESPECT!!!!
I have seen the decline somewhat over the years, very sad it got to this point, thanks for the heads up.
I feel like made a mistake buying an Asus Prime B550M.   I know its not the platform that has a problem, but i feel dirty buying an Asus brand for some reason.
was gonna preorder their ally, nope.
ignore ryzen 7000 and inte 13th gen
Such a shame to see such a company due this.  It's a shame when the corporation starts making decisions on quality and production speeds (i don't have any insider info just a guess.) ASUS became too big too powerful and now they're too full of themselves and think they are untouchable.  They made too many mistakes as of recent, and are no longer a trustworthy company.  Goodbye Asus, Hope you can figure it out before you start losing too much business.
I had 2 ASRock motherboards, a Z77 Extreme6 and a Z270 Extreme4, both were totally stable but the latter did have one USB port fail.
You know that you sitting at 3.8 million subscribers and saying this about ASUS , they just lost that many sales and customers. Good work Jay. I will not be building my new PC with any ASUS products.
As someone who has been using Asus since the AthlonXP days this is really sad to hear. Perfect time for EVGA to step in if you ask me.
I bought an ASUS monitor with a 3 year warranty. Exactly after the warranty was gone, the monitor just simply broke down and didn't work.
If you think the PC hardware is bad, try and use their phones. There's basically no service or support for it whatsoever, and if you try to return it, they'll have the audacity to try and slap on a restocking fee. I had 2 generations of these phones, and while they were powerful devices, they were utterly worthless phones.
Thanks J
New donald trump for firing asus
Time for evga to step up in the amd motherboard game
I always bought Asus. My last one is ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero. Memory issues with corsair 3600Mhz using xmp (docp) profile with a 600$ 64Gb memory kit. What a garbage.  Looking for next build for a 13900K. What should i choose if i don't take asus ? I'm now affraid to buy another asus product. What brand is now reliable ?
I am torn on this one. I 100% agree that they shouldn't have released a beta bios at all... just release a recommendation on turning off EXPO and soc voltages.  On the other hand, I think they are panicking because they know this is a serious issue and are trying to do something asap to address it... which in this is case a bios that they must have some level of confidence in otherwise I don't think they would even consider releasing it.  With the intent of hopefully heading off this catastrophic failure issue.  But at the same time, I can see the side of this is only a test version and can put your warranty in jeopardy.   The logical thing to do here is disable EXPO and lower the SoC voltage to 1.3v... and wait until they release a final version in the near future.  It isn't rocket science.
This is so disapointing... Built so many systems through the years with ASUS and currently use a B550-I Gaming that's got no issues but guess i'll have to learn a new bios on my next build...
The thing I’ve been wondering with this is who do we use going forward? MSI is super risky due to their hack, Asrock just isn’t going to happen. Gigabyte exists I guess,
Jay, great information. With this all coming to light, who is your top recommended brand for motherboards at this point in time?
I give it 2 months before you are talking to them again and become a sponsor.
phew, that was a lucky swerve, almost brought a ASUS MB so glad i waited a few extra days...
Thanks for the honesty Jay . this is why i really loved youre channel .
I remember when the cross hair 6 hero came out and I had the same issues Jay had on it at release. I had to RMA and they sent me back an Intel tuf board as a replacement and then did not want to honor the RMA saying it had been fulfilled. I eventually got the board back but wished I had gotten the ASRock taichi for better stability.  I got another Asus strix b450-f for my wife but found that the CPU voltage control was really just a suggestion and it was borderline dangerous volts all the time with lowering it even slightly affecting ram and CPU stability.  Sorry Asus but after those 2 blunders you basically lost me for life. I can't imagine how the people with fried cpus feel right now.
i think its just an ASUS prob jay i have not had one blue screen with ryzen 7000 series ive had no ram stability issues not audio issues literally not a single hiccup but im running a auros elite ax board
Nobody cares about AMD GPUs
I also have AMD, ind have a lot of weird issues with my pc. But I have an Aorus motherboard
Also they really oversold their new handheld, I mean it trades blows with the steam deck but it’s the NOT the clear winner they made it out to be.
i was thinking about this recently about thermal throtaling what if they raised the tollarance and then you would have more perfomance. well ASUS has answerd that one. everyone is trying to get and edge and it would seem they are willing to risk everything to do that. when all they have to do is provide top tear consumer service as no one is doing that and it would be very wellcome and put them ahead of the pack.
My TUF X570 board bricked after BIOS update.. I know it's possible but damn. Then I had to RMA it and it took forever.. I just wasn't impressed and I've been buying ASUS boards for a very long time 10+ years and loved the ROG line but I believe my next board will be with MSI. Seriously.
ASUS has now removed the warning under the beta bios in germany, good job! 👍Just wondering why it's still visible on the us side.
As someone who loves everything from ASUS TUF series , they break my heart with their behavior. Hats off to Jay for doing this!
Wow, my last three builds were ASUS and can honestly say my next builds will not use any of their parts. Why reward such horrible consumer practices with your hard earned money.
Bro I'm having similar issues but I'm using x570 crosshair with 5800x3d. I updated the bios trying to solve issues that ended up being something else but the new bios must just be dogshit
I'm rockung the brand new DDR5 Asrock pg lightning, Ypu keep dunking on Asrock, did I buy something wrong? 0_O
So… I guess asus products will be cheaper now? Also, wth is the CMO at asus to allow this fiasco to play out?
Bit concerned about my current build now. I've got a tuf gaming x750e motherboard with a 7700x. I have finished it yet, just waiting on a graphics card. I was considering a Rog strix 4090 but unsure after seeing this video
Would be nice to have a tutorial on undervolting asus boards if ur on the last non beta bios
As an ASUS FanBoy i can just laugh ... about ASUS.  Asus wants to rip off their customers and make excuses for releasing a BIOS that shouldn't be used. Quick question for ASUS: Why are you making the beta BIOS available for download if it can destroy the hardware?  Then let us, as customers, show ASUS who has the upper hand.  First of all, you should start with the marketing manager and throw them out the door, without a doubt they didn't understand their job.
Dang, Asus always seemed the no-brainer choice for quality and reliability... Not building a PC anytime soon, but good to know
Yeah, this is why i come back to this channel. The honesty.   One would think sending out motherboards to Youtube creators, were thousands, potentially millions people get to watch, would have gone through RIGOROUS QC.   Sad to see a good company fall. Hope they act now, before everyone starts to (rightfully) avoid ASUS.
Asus got paid off by Intel to destroy AMD Processors.
omg.. I just bought X670E and 7950X3D, as well as 4070Ti.. All controversial..  am I f*cked ? It seems to be running perfectly so far
For a long time ASUS has been one of my go to brands when building a PC. I guess our U.S. friend haven't been mispronouncing "ASUS" wrong all this time, they've been ahead of the game. The U.S. pronunciation sounds like "A" + "Suce" (which is French for "suck").
Next time jay buy and pay the motherboard like everyone else! free board could have problems
Jay drops mic to the floor "were done" enough is enough.
I left Asus behind a few years ago when I had two different boards bought 3 months apart for different builds that failed in the first year due to mfg flaws and Asus refused to help in any way with either board. I had been using Asus since motherboards still has ISA slots and no one had heard of a CNR slot.
It feels like people from their laptop team ascending the corporate ladder too far….
My experience with AsRock was so bad that them allegedly turning things around doesn't even phase my opinion of them.
Asus ripped me off a few years ago, trying to charge me 115% of RRP to fix a dead Chromebook that was 3 weeks out of warranty. At the time I was like "never again" but I had been thinking of softening recently. Welp, I guess not...
I didnt expect it TBH :)
thank you jay - i will keep this in my mind when i will buy a board next time.
Respect for your decision Jay! Now i am looking at my recently bought Asus monitor and hoping it will stay as solide as it has been for the 4 weeks that i owned it... 😬
I am planning on building my first PC and wanted to got for a 3070 asus card, should I reconsider?
Glad to hear you say this. I've been watching and reading reviews regarding memory and Asus boards on current gen AMD, and as something of an AMD fanboy I'm hoping you'll give Asrock or Gigabyte a shot in your system before you switch completely back to Intel.
I really hate this... Not youre video but the fact that this has been happening. I have been on the same boat of holding out and hoping for the best with them, but this is just a joke at this point. Now obviously I can not drop all my ASUS gear because I lack money to get new stuff, but from this point on, UNTIL THEY CHANGE, I will not be buy their products.   Just sucks because I loved a lot of their stuff for so long.
I recently finished my new build and it has a ASUS Z790E-WIFI Gaming motherboard (running an intel 13700K w/64GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum Ram)...so far, knock on wood, it is performing really well for me. All this news though from Steve and your channel is making me wonder if I have made a bad decision.
My first pc build and I bought a B650e-f and installed this bios… I was told by the community that it’s what I was supposed to do. Do I have to worry about my board now?
You are a real one for this.  Much respect.
Such a shame.  I was a huge fan of Asus products, but I will definitely be looking else where in the future
I stopped using ASUS components anyway. Using their stuff is just so annoying. Can't get to the fan controls, set RGB or whatever else in Armoury Crate until you update all the updates that are there. No idea why I have to update my AIO firmware to change the RGB on my RAM. Just this week it blocked me from getting to Fan Xpert until I downloaded a freaking font from their update center... I actually had to use my old ROG ASUS Strix LC 360 a while ago because for some reason it refuses to let its firmware to be updated, which results in nothing in Armoury Crate working because it just keeps sending me to the Update Center to update that dumb unupdatable firmware. Wasn't an issue with a particular system or mainboard or anything either as I've had that thing in so many systems by now and none could update.
Are these problems on amd cpus only? I'm actually going to build my first pc, and the mobo I was going to buy was the z690 tuf (the same one on the box on the video), along with a i5 13600k.
Thanks. This remove ASUS from gpu upgrade. Still got a rog strix GTX 1060 OC 6gb from 2017.
Jay... I have to say this: I love you :D Please stay like you are.   Greetings from Germany!
It's like a phone manufacturer saying, _"Well, the obvious fix is to root your device. That will solve your problem. (by the way doing so voids your warranty and bars you from receiving any updates or support ever again)"_ Then how is that a solution!?
Thumbs up Jay for sticking up for the consumer.  Had nothing but troubles with my Asus X670E Hero.  Asus is due a class action lawsuit unless they sort their shit out.
why is asus under fire for AMD providing garbage cpu ?
My Asus laptop mysteriously stopped working out of nowhere right after a forced bios update barely as i lost my one year warranty, and now I'm just sitting on a dead laptop that I relied on for work
I’m feeling the same way about ASUS. My family has been a loyal customer for at least 8 years and recent events are leading us to move away from ASUS products.   I had a water cooled Asus ROG 3080ti that I had to RMA and was told by support to send it back with the heatsink not attached. I got an email back saying that the GPU was “broken” and a picture of the heatsink, bracket and GPU on the box I sent it back in. I called support and they checked the ticket, which revealed that there were screws that I didn’t send and I had to pay $2200 for a new 3080ti GPU. The support person told me they don’t even test the GPUs (when I asked if they were able to test with extra screws they likely had). They tell me that I can send the screws back and re-validate the warranty and I asked them which specific screws they are missing so I can send back the right ones. I am now waiting on the list of screws.
Good thing I already didn't use Asus to begin with
Very honest.  Props for the move!!!!!
Make motherboards great again
Switched to MSI in 2014 and never looked back.
Now I have to sell my Asus mobo... thanks...
Never had any problems with ASUS devices. But ALWAYS with the devices from other manufacturers.
This has been happening for a while with Asus, my ROG Strix Z-590 Gaming board has issues like crazy. Slow response with connecting to the file manager itself is a huge problem being it takes 10 seconds to respond and that's with it being on an M.2. Long boot times from start, opening a browser sometimes fail. My old Sniper Z170  with a 7700K booted in 4 seconds from button push to home page!!! I'm running a 11900K on this board and it takes 20 seconds sometimes to do the same. Asus just made the issues obvious now.
Thanks for keeping it real Jay, sad to see but you have always been consumer first and we all love and support that!💜
Jayz My setupTUF H670-pro WIFI D4, With i7-12700K, Stock bios. Should I be worried ??
Are there any good brands left? It seems like they all have problems one way or another that makes it difficult to want to support or use any of their products anymore with the major brands.  Asus was the last one I thought I could trust.
Yeah this is enough to kill Asus for me. I’ve been using only asus products for all my builds for family and friends since early 2000’s
I will give you approximately $23 dollars for one of those boards.  And a pack of Trident Layers.  I think I just bought an Asus mobo for my new build too.  I need to go check the box.
If even Asrock manages to be better than Asus these days, maybe I can get a girlfriend after all :p
Was actaully considering buying a rog motherboard, definitely contemplating now after this
Doing something like this takes a lot of courage. Thank you for doing so.
IK the X570 boards aren't effected, but I'm seriously considering just returning mine at this point and swapping for literally anyone else. Because of course I've got the bad luck of this happening like the day after I swapped boards (short version: ITX wasn't cutting it for me anymore so I switched to an ATX board). This could have been such an easy win if Asus stood by their products, giving a killshot to competition by showing the lengths they could go to for their customers, but instead they decided to take that gun they just shot themselves in the foot with and point it at their customers, fired, and then aimed for their own head.
When I built my PC in the summer of 2020, Asus was the gold standard for quality and support. I can't believe the pandemic knocked them down so hard. Such a shame.
I bought a gaming lcd monitor from asus way back in 2009 and it was defective big grey blotches on the screen the lcd layers were seperating i was told by a local tech sent it off on rma was told by rep that they would replace it even sent them pics of the problem but they instead taped up my box i sent it to them and shipped it back i then again told them the problem was still there and once again i was reassured that they would replace it and once again they sent it back to me in mty original box by now my box was getting pretty beat up from shipping i went through this rma process with them for 4 months thats 5 rma"s.......they did this so many times the warranty finally ran out on the last rma....They are a dirt bag company i can get products that are just as good as asus by reading tech reviews for instance i stick with msi very good rma service gigabyte is good but you have to be very stern with them when it comes to an rma evga now they are the best no rma problems at all just do a google search to find out which company is easier to deal with.....
I've been struggling with ASUS support as well. I have an ASUS Strix XG27AQM. I started having issues with it constantly turning off and on after being used for a couple hours in September 2022. I sent it in for an RMA they stated they changed the main board. They had my monitor for over a month. December 2022 about 2 months after getting my monitor back I started having the same issue. I sent it back in for RMA. Again replaced main board and small board this time. They had it for about 3 weeks. February 2022 I started having the same issues. They had my monitor for over a month this time. The day i opened the monitor and hooked it back up to my pc i immediately started having the same issue. I have to constantly keep contacting support to get updates. Currently I'm waiting for product replacement... they have had my monitor for a month now and i have still not received a replacement. ASUS support is a struggle and headache for sure.  (Most of my PC components, monitors, and my laptop are all ASUS.) I've lost trust as well
everyone going AMD and all these AMD CPU and boards are crap!!
Damn. I was going to go full Asus wiith my system refresh. Guess I'll be looking elsewhere.
based on this you should also drop all Nvidia products from you channel also as they screw the customer by trying to keep prices high so in m y eye are just as bad as ASUS covering up issues
I once traveled across the country via train, and took my PC along with me in checked baggage. When I arrived at my destination and tried to set up the computer, it would not boot. I checked all the obvious stuff (with one foolish exception) and finally called Gigabyte (the MB manufacturer). They walked me through a few more things to check, but it still would not boot at all. There was none of this _'find some excuse not to help the customer'_ crap. They shipped me the same MB I already had, at their expense.  When I went to start pulling things off the (assumed) dead MB, I noticed that the locking-lever on the CPU wasn't latched-down (how embarrassing!). I locked it down, and the system booted up flawlessly. Feeling like a complete ass, I called Gigabyte back, told them what I'd found and asked if they wanted me to ship the unopened new MB back to them. They were like, _"Nah, keep it as a backup. Glad you were able to get your system running again!"_ I've stuck with Gigabyte ever since. What absolute heroes! 👍
Earned a new sub by sticking to your guns and informing people.
I've had issues like this with Asus for 20 years and have always wondered why they became so popular.  Yes, when you get a board that works it works well... But with Asus when you don't you go through hell as a regular consumer.
this doesnt seem like an engineering issue, its low paid office workers fucking this shit up
Jay, I'll add my own recent experience with Asus products.  A couple of Months ago I ordered an ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi board and a Ryzen 7950x CPU to go with it.  I noticed when I got the system running whenever I unplugged the power cord the CMOS went to defaults and the clock reset.  I took out the motherboard battery and noticed that it was very grungy looking, not shiny like a new one should be.  That is a three volt battery (2032 I believe).  I put my volt meter on it and it read about .5 volts, basically dead.  I replaced the battery and it solved the problem.  I have a background in electronics so this was the type of troubleshooting I was used to, but the average user would have been looking at an RMA situation.  That was obviously and old, used, and dead battery that someone on the Asus assembly line decided to stick into that board.  The box and all packing materials still had the factory seals on them.  One issue I have is that I have had absolutely nothing but trouble out of MSI products.  This goes back well over twenty years so I won't touch them with a ten foot pole.  I've had semi decent luck with Asrock products, but they ain't anything to write home about.  I had used some Gigabyte boards in the past but had trouble out of them as well.  It truly is a rough time to be building PCs these days.
Oh the right to repair argument the manufacturers claim is backfiring on them.  “Only us can fix the ur shit” but your fix is garbage forcing us to buy new.
I never used asus anyways, cause they always made unreliable trash
Ok yup. Intel build. And now I’m not going to buy that Asus handheld
I have an Asus X570 board and its been giving me issues from day one.  Ultimately found that it was because of RAM OCing and no matter how much I've tweaked the settings, things would never work right.  Even with a different set of RAM sticks that are known to be good and upgrading to a better CPU.  After watching this, I have to wonder if its just incompetence at Asus that I have this problem.
👏👏👏👏👏 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💚💚💚💚💚
Wow. That's a shocker from Asus. Can't even send a good hardware. Seems like gpus will face similar issues in coming time.  Time to boycott? 2 big creators have shown their disappointment
I had this problem with their warranty process while in school and i switched to MSI
No More ASUS for me !
I've personally stopped saying ASUS and say ANUS now to reflect their new standing in my eyes. My two rigs are both ROG Strix and have had zero problems but  both are a couple of generations old. I will be using a different manufacturer's motherboards going forward.
Sometimes im envy how Influencer always get their product ( ik its free but lets pretend its not ) but they always complaining for what they got
this make perfect sence for what have seen personaly on a consumer side both my partner, brother ans sister inlaw all have rog laptops an all of them are killing power jacks an after a bit of looking anj basic mesureing its a total failer of qc an tolarance stacing from the factory that is baincly burning iut the center electrode on the jack like an arc welding rod an causing it to drop in an out of conectivity. litraly a 1mm diamiter difrance in the case an the power jack thats piss por given the cost of thoes things an what iss totaly possible with injection molding that is so  bad its actualy amazing.
I didn’t see this coming RIP Rog…
I just shelled out for an ASUS Prime Z790-A WiFi and now I'm feeling really nervous, will the motherboard go bad on me. I guess we'll have to see. This and Steve's reporting has put me off the brand from this point forward. My next build will likely not include anything ASUS.
Back when the AMD FX8350 came out I bought one asus sabertooth 990fx motherboard. It was one of the better motherboards you could buy. Never experienced or heard of any problems with this motherboard.  Also had a graphics card from ASUS without a single problem.  Asrock was a cheap brand but not many problems as I have experienced.  Gigabyte was ok. brand but not the best when gigabyte ga-970a-ud3 come out. It came in V1.0 V1.1 V1.2 V3.0. I think they had some problems with the cpu. volt regulator. I don't remember what they are actually called  No matter which monterboard i used, they've never had big  problems.  ASUS has also had some problems with gaming laptops. see them a lot in repair videos.  Now after the corona, I see many factories and many types of products having much more quality problems now than before.  Some brands handle the problems in a terrible way!
Well, I was going to by another ASUS motherboard.
Ive been buying ASRock boards since lga1366 and have had very good luck even when overclocking. Looks like I'll continue spending my money there
I wonder if Jay is going to replace his new personal rigs board and cpu with something else?
For a long time, I've had to avoid anything TUF or ROG. They're good looking flashy products, with questionable quality and god awful software.  Still trying to remove the remnants of the Asus TUF keyboard software from my system 6 months later.
Unreal, great to see such integrity in this hugely passionate community. I've just switched out to msi from Asus for an upcoming build thanks to Gamers Nexus and channels like yours. Keep up the hard work, it's greatly appreciated 👍
ASS US...
Dame I was thinking about getting Asus for Intel build now idk…
i think asus is great mayby not the motherbords but the rest i think is great
Jay you da man ! been following for years. love the channel !
wow, huge respect for that decision.
Another extremely annoying thing about Asus is their spamm-y email advertising their stupid and worthless Asus Webstorage service. I always have to mark their email as spam, despite already having marked it along with the associated email address as spam. But everyday I still end up getting four of those emails on my email's primary inbox 😡
Shame... ASUS us to be top notch...
i had problems with my asus motherboard ( asus rog strix maximus iv i think i dont remember ) the problem started as usb disconnects and the cpu problems and one device wass burned down be usb after getting the board to so 3party fix shop identify the problem its wass the usb controller chip that burned down and shorted the hell of the motherboard
Having an issue where my same motherboard, it freezes everything I’m doing streaming and playing a game. Comes back online and at times I have to find the downloaded game files, gpu can’t display to the monitors. I’ve been very disappointed with them. I’m running a 7700x. If I could I would return this motherboard and get an MSI or ASRock.
A.sus ... "It's in the name" TM
I used to buy asus product over all others.  I gave up on them a few years ago over a monitor.  I bought what was supposed to be a new 1440p 165hz monitor.  After a few months it developed a small cluster or bright/bad pixels.  I went to warranty it and they wouldn’t.  They told me the serial on the monitor was “used/refurb”.  They wouldn’t let me show them the receipt that I purchased a new monitor.  So now I have a $800 monitor with a blemish.  That was it for me.
I think I’m done buying from Asus after seeing this…
Good thing I went with Gigabyte X670-E Master, it has been solid since the launch.
This is FANTASTIC - all of the manufacturers need to be held accountable!!  The question remains for us current Asus mobo users - What do we do if: - We are running old AM5 BIOS? - We've updated to the new Brick-Warranty Beta Bios?
Seeing this, I'm kinda glad I chose MSI
This isn't just a computer issue. This is happening in almost every industry in the world right now. It's like lockdowns made companies lose their minds. You're seeing it in the automotive and parts field, aviation, home building, and everything in between. Prices are skyrocketing, quality is plummeting. Part of this, in my humble opinion, is the consumer. The consumer continues to pay inflated prices for lower quality goods and services, and manufacturers count on it and continue shoveling the garbage out.
I rather you take their money and keep telling us not to buy them.
They probably made their laptop department handle their motherboard department...
Good on you Jay. I bought an asus z690 strix board  from a company here in Australia called pc case gear. When I received the board, the thermal pads for the m.2's were put on ripped or missing, and the pins were damaged from the factory. Pc case gear told me I damaged the pins due to incorrect placement of the cpu. I'm pretty sure arrow on the board and on the cpu are meant to match up. Anyway, they sent it back to asus free of charge and had it fixed. The board took 12 weeks to get fixed, and this is going back in September last year. Git it back after Christmas. It's still sitting in the box and I haven't bothered installing it. Quality control is absolute dog shit.
running an asus 4070ti and z790 board and it works perfect? literally never crashed even while being used to the max
Welcome to the "Solid as an ASRocK" arc because ASUSTeK fumbled everything, including their own coverup. 💯 I've already warned a cool streamer about their Gigabyte X670e build and issues with the F10c bios. Hope it goes right. From the start I have REALLY not favored the X600 series and am likely skipping AM5 entirely. In 2019 I made the jump from (Gigabyte) AMD 970 to (ASUS) X570. I have minor issues with my SolarFlare but lucked out. Every day this month I open  and find new reasons to look at X670 like it's stupid (because it is). By definition this is not good for any involved parties. Multiple people at ASUS deserve to be screamed at (not by us) and fired. 💥
They have been doing this since day 1, it's just more obvious and blatant now. Too bad this info doesn't reach most consumers and people will still keep paying premium for absolute dog shit.
That's why we trust this Channel ♥️🙌🏻
The bigger they are ,the harder they fall!
Jays a dick but does the right thing on stuff like this.
I was done with them when I bought a B550 board that  a) would not allow for RAM speeds that were in excess of 3000. If any speed above 3k was selected, no matter what the kit was capable of, the system simply would not post.  and  b) would not allow for a bios update. SOOOOOO many attempts, and all failed. Looked online, and mine was not a unique situation.   Bought another board and haven't had any issues in over a year.
Which brand is on the top of ur list?
Lol,Your funny. Aways liked you videos
Massive Respect for Jay for doing this.
So whats the best now? can anyone recommend for a 7950x3d board.. i been using only Asus since 2004.
ASUS, U done fuct up large here.
Glad I havent bought any ASUS products since 2017, where I bought a midrange laptop. This solidifies it.
shame i love asus products but maybe its time for a change
For me ASUS has always been synonym for quality. UNTIL, back in 2017 my friend finally saved some money for a new graphics card and really didn't know what to choose. Wanted something cheap but with decent performance for 1080p. At that time RX 470 came out and it was priced really good. So I was like sure, I will recommend you ASUS RX470... After starting up a game, in 5 minutes the monitor displayed only No Signal. We tried everything (software) and nothing worked so we decided to RMA the card. We got a brand new card and guess what, the same issue! Later we found out, that the VRM on the card gets so hot that the card just powers off. Then the internet got flooded with people complaining about the same problem with the same card... They really put a tiny heatsink on the VRM, there was never a way to cool it properly like that... My friend got really mad at me because of what piece of trash I had recommended...
This sucks.  Because when it comes to motherboards. I'm asus fanboy. And I just did a brand new i9 13900k build.  I used the Asus strix ROG A. Everything is working great.  I hope I don't have regrets.
ASUS deserve to loose very many valued customers over thier attrocious treatment of customers over the AMD Rysen 5 bios issues. They are demonstrating that they dont value customer loyalty, they treat thier customers with disctain, and that they just are not a trustworthy company.
It's an AM5 problem too
I used to say ASUS was the go to brand; but i am just not sure who is the "Go To" brand now.
Me nervously side eying my RTX 3070 tuf, "You be good now, don't start nothing."
Wow, I've had nothing but good experiences with Asus stuff. One system is running a P8Z77-V Pro (Ivy Bridge) and the other is running a ROG Strix X399-E gaming (Zen+ Threadripper). I've also got two Asus 2080 Supers, and neither of them have had any issues either. I will definitely be looking elsewhere when it comes time to do my next upgrade.
Across several tech channels, some 5 million people will hear this message.  If that isn't an absolute marketing win for Asus, I don't know what is.
I really hope ASUS gets the book thrown at them with a massive lawsuit
Massive props to you Jay for doing the right thing, not just by your subscriber base but the gaming community at large. The right road is not always the easiest to travel but it is still the right one.
Asus just needs to fire some people. I love the ASUS Sonic studio and the ARMOURCRATE.
I do not spend so much time with hardware anymore, but I desperately wanted to buy 3080, now it feels like it will be 4080, but I always leaned towards TUF cards. Time went by I did not have a spare million for a GPU and while I was waiting, I constantly heard from time to time that there's something wrong with Asus. And now this. So, if a person like me hears that this brand is not ok anymore, I can't even imagine how bad the situation actually is. And this is sad. Less and less quality stuff left, more and more trash is out there.
After 7 months and several e-mails with Asus promotion team I'm still waiting for my Asus promotion ROG Chakram mouse that I was supposed to get when buying Asus X670E HERO motherboard. Well done Asus.
things happend asus is a good brand anyone make mistakes sshe will fix it soon iI think
ASUS is and always has been a shit company. Shitty "gamer" branded ROG products are a consumer idiot filter.
It’s a shame as they do some of the best looking stuff when they get it right, just upgraded my workstation with the intel 13th ASUS platform (always gone ASUS) so when it next gets upgraded, I hope they’ve made some changes otherwise I’ll have to avoid.
I don't know, my asus stuff works fine.
Idk. I feel like half these issues is people who "have to" have bleeding edge hardware. Every time we see these issues. Though I agree with the QA and customer service issues.
Wish amd had partnered up with evga and made sick products.
ASUS cares more about RGB, adding NVME drive slots, ADDING GARBAGE WIFI... TAKING AWAY SATA PORTS... HAVING LESS USB PORTS... than anything else.  They barely have at least 4-6 satas now, barely any usb ports... it's crappy.. and stop adding nvme slots.... 2 alone is good enough.. 3 at most.. stop taking away satas.. stop taking away usbs
All ASUS needed to say was, "We are not sure why the voltage were set as what they were and we will be launching an investigation in to why this happened." Then they can go off and see if they were following the specs provided by AMD. But, it looks like a lawyer got involved and said, "Deny every thing so you don't need to do refunds." If this was a car company in the US they would have to do recalls. Any time Lawyers get involved they mess things up. Maybe use a PR person instead.
Here is the thing. Master of the Universe origins figure have hair, fingerprint from the worker (from factory). Another. Neca toys have bad plastic from China that break easily. Another. G-Shock have dust under the screen, fingerprint etc. Now the motherboard. It have scratches, bended tiny metal ( not good for volt ) etc. What is going on with China factories? They have become the worst.
I literally just switched to ASUS I've been an avid MSI fan. 😢
This is why I trust Jayz two cents
Wow. When I upgraded my current system from a msi b450m pro vdh max to a ROG b550 a gaming (also upgraded the cpu) I was like "wow, I got a ROG system now, thats gonna be rock solid". Now I am not so sure anymore. I'll gonna read up on that because I dont want any smoke with some giant company 9000km away when I dont have enough money to just grab a new mobo, possibly even a new chip.  From what I heard and saw this mostly regards 7th gen but I really dont want to find out the hard way.
i agreed every time  i used  ASUS motherboards alway has problem and alway have audio issues, msi is better build.
I thought acer and asus were the same company 😂 acer has always been trash so I just assumed asus was trash 😅
Well Said Jay. In the Past Ive Always had MSI or Gigabyte Motherboards. Last Year My Wife Bought Me a New PC and It Came with a Asus B450 F Board.. But Watching This Video. I Dont Think I Be Upgrading to Asus Newer Motherbaords.
I've always used ASUS, my first card was an A7S333 going through the A8V-Deluxe, M4A79T-Deluxe, PRIME X370-PRO until I got to my current X570-E Gaming II I've never had any problems, they all work until today!! It is very sad to see a brand like ASUS reach this point.
so now top tier motherboard brands is asrock msi and gigabyte ?
How the mighty have fallen ..... Used to swear by the quality of Asus and had several of their ROG mobos. Kinda glad I went with an MSI board for my current rig now. At least Asus still kick ass in the GPU world .... maybe ....
If you need to get rid of that WiFi board there a poor UK pensioner available to look after it
This is why I take everything Jay says seriously. Highest respect
Tell me about it. I bought asus board pro art and it had 5y extended warranty. It took me 3 months of emailing Asus for them to "accept it" that its valid warranty to extend it for me. They really went down the hill :/
I was always a massive Asus ROG fan.  After all the **** over the last (not so few) months, I ditched the brand.  Like you, I have them on boycott.  You said to Asus in your video after announcing that they were fired 'you won't care'.  Well, they will if we, as consumers, follow your lead.  Kudos to you.
you know something is really wrong when they start sending shit to Jay. but what brand is the best nowadays then? I've had very much problems with msi so that's not an option for me. Aorus/gigabyte is also going down the toilet as far as rma's. guess that leaves Evga :) and asrock as jay said.
Currently using an asus tuf b550m plus wifi for my system. Now from what im hearing about asus this will probably be the last asus motherboard I ever use.
Jay I need to see you smash this Asus trash with a hammer
Oh look jay doing another video of the same thing that Steve or linus did after they did it. Stop the trend of copying Jay since you made a pissing video of trends.
The Bud Light of OEM's
This is soooo disapointing to hear. I do like Asus. I have a ROG STRIX X670E-A. What do you think of this motherboard?
That is so true. 2023 February,  I get an ASUS X670E-F motherboard with a R9 7900X and 2X16GB Corsair 6000MHZ memory. OMG, currently (2023 MAY the 0821 old BIOS is the only stable one. Everything else is causing issues, blue screen, not booting, Boot loop or not working with EXPO. So I am waiting until AMD and Asus solve the problem. 0821 is perfectly fine and rock solid (Overclock is working); I have not experienced any issues with this BIOS  for the last 3 months.
Building my first PC, and bought a ROG Strix B650E-E and was planning to pair it with a RYZEN 7800X3D. After seeing this video i would like to know if the B650E-E MoBo is good or should i consider getting a different one. Any advice would be appreciated.
Not that MSI (which i bought) is great or anything - but I've avoided ASUS for a while .... their graphics card are grossly overpriced - their 4090 ROG is like 400USD more than other brands.
I've grown up with ASUS, my first motherboard was ASUS and it was a nightmare - it was a budget intel board but it was constantly failing and needed to be replaced.. It took weeks of troubleshooting as a new builder, it was never right out of the box with niggling issues with audio and wifi and the PCIE slot ended up failing.. I've not trusted them again, their flashy stuff looks tempting but if you can't make basic components reliable I'm not trusting you with upgrades, MSI have been very solid in my experience and probably my favourite brand, even looks wise. I have a 2 year old laptop and it won't boot without power, dissapointing quality control.. I do feel bad for AIBs with limited time to rush releases but it is ridiculous with how much they charge.
Daaaaaamn! Jay let loose. 😂 crazy tho I've never had any issues in my build. (Self built) Asus tuf x570 and still grinding. Big ups tho Jay. 🤘🤘🤘
ASUS sure got a stern talking to from Jay. Good of you to stand up to this and have the customers back. I've never had a problem with ASRock back when they came out but I only do cheap budget builds so maybe that's why.
And you forgot about ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Formula ;))) I've asked to refund (because ASUS put this option for this motherboard to their official page) but my local support said that I should got the corrosion first and only after that go to the service  )))))
Wild to think that it's likely better to go Asrock rather than ASUS today.
Man the ads are getting ridiculous, just when jay mentioned the stream issue "this happens" it cuts right to commercial, im starting to think its a conscious effort by YT.
Yes, I follow you but now I trust you I have a Z790 E Gaming Wifi after 10 year working with a Clevo laptop with cero problems and I was amazing to see a new bios every month or two month, and imposible to work with 4 dimms of 32 ram until now ..... I don't have any answer from Asus about that... I lost my Gskill 64Gb 2 dimms 6000Mt/s 400€ kit ram and At less the guarantie was good and got another news rams dimms but I start to think than could be because the new bios 0904, It's the last time for Asus, yes very beutiful but I not a gamer I have my computer with out rgb, I need trust for my workstation
I also gave up on ASUS over 5 yrs ago.
Nexus went straight for the "scumbag" title. That's heavy.
So sad to see how far asus has fallen.
Great video, couldn't agree more. Been using ASUS boards for years, and not had any problems personally, but after this whole debarcle i will avoid in the future.
i stopped using ASUS years ago. they have had issues since the FX series AMD boards. I had 4 fail within a year and sent in for warranty. they said it was denied due to overclocking. i never over clocked any of them. didnt need to. MSI no issues yet
Finally people had enough of asus and speaking up about it. I legit went thru 3 x570 crosshair hero boards, 2 x570-e gaming boards and 2 x570-f gaming boards. Every single one was unstable on my system no matter how much I messed around with the bios and software. I kept exchanging them at micro center until I finally had enough and switched to x570 aorus master board and haven’t had a single issue ever since
i recently had a problem with a company not abiding to a recall and sent me out a faulty power supply i only found out when the power supply blew luckily it somehow did not fry any components i was issued a full refund by amazon plus voucher to use on amazon as the seller was uncooperative when brands or seller dont stick to recalls its there own fault for the fallout
Many thanks for this video! I had an inconvenience buying asus Strix b650e-f which came with broken flashback button, had bios issues since day 1 (it couldn't properly identify pcie x16) which were fixed with beta bios that appeared once in download center and never again and many more. Mobo died after 2 months  of work, so I sent it for RMA and after 1.5 month of waiting I received info, that mobo is not warranty covered because bios flashback button was damaged. That's just unacceptable for this price tag.
So MSI? Who’s the next contender
Even brand-name prebuilt systems have carried ASUS guts inside for decades.  This has been the weak point in many of these, both business and consumer systems.
That’s a nice mat you have there… be a shame if someone could buy one🤦🏻‍♂️. I thought the gpu shortage was bad where’s the Matt’s!😂
Never encountered issues with their z490/590/690/790 boards and their GPU’s are among the best on the market quality wise   Then again I don’t opt for AMD for obvious reasons, I mean c’mon lmao..
My 3 month old ASUS Prime B650 Plus just bricked and won't even post anymore. Tried new BIOS, made sure not to use the beta cause I was lucky enough to read the warranty part, and no life from it. I've never had an issue with a motherboard in over a decade of building computers
Bought a X670E tuf and it over volted the crap out of my 7800x3d. Even on their BiOS that says it is for keeping max to 1.30 soc and it ran 1.43 still.  Crazy. Never getting ASUS again. Plus can't upgrade to even newer version BIOS that says my warranty is void is even crazier. Luckily I at least know how to manually undervolt .. however too late as pretty sure I have degradation.  Thanks ASUS
Yeah, Companies in general nowadays are so focused productivity and profits, that they make cuts or simply  dont focus on quality anymore. i worked quality control as a profession in a different field, but same thing. i wasted so much time in meetings when i brought up quality issues that will affect not only productivity, but the business, and did not take any of my advice. it sucks asus is falling prey to this, because ive have a full system of asus hardware, and ive had no issues with it, but its also the hardware from 2016-2018 era.
Smh looks like ASUS finally fell off. Respect for not letting this slide. Maybe you should try Msi or NZXT for your next motherboards if available.
Asus has been on my "black list" for years. Their "customer service" is a joke and has been for years. I used to love and almost exclusively use Asus, but as of about 4 years ago, they are on my "black list" and I won't buy one. There "customer support" absolutely SUCKS. I had an issue with a motherboard and sent it back 4 times (twice with a basic description, once with a very detailed 3 page letter explaining my testing method, and the final time with a video SHOWING the setup and issues). When it came back the fourth time still busted and them refusing to give me my money back, I took it to the gun range and emptied a mag into it. Screw Asus!
Thank you for covering this and being down to earth about it (can’t stand the GN haughtiness)!  It’s getting harder to find a brand you can trust. Gigabyte’s and Newegg are definitely out - now Asus, and the list keeps increasing.
Where is JJ? :)
Asus, more like ASSus.
I'm slowly getting my first build together, part for part. I'll be spending a lot of money which took quite some time to save up for. I've put a lot of research time into it. So in this I'll follow your lead and take ASUS of my shortlist. Can't risk wasting money, I need to get this right the first time. Thanks for standing up for the average consumer like myself!
MSI, Gigabyte rule！My failed X99 mobo from Asus was totally disaster!
ASROCK is solid. sadly ASUS owns ASrock so ends up pretty much being the same heads.  been using asrock for over 7 years now and only minor issues.  I guess we are in a tough spot now picking good boards.
I'm using ASUS-Boards for over 20 years now. Never thought it would come to this. The growing price span was one thing but this ist just shady  ... Very disappointing.
I am returning my unopened X670E Hero back to Amazon. Wanted to put my new rig together today. I guess not today!
Well, this just sealed it. I won’t be using Asus when I upgrade to the 7800X3D.
thanks Jay,  i heard for some time now ASUS products is not what it used to be......  I'm looking for a new motherboard and I think i'll go with MSI.
@JayzTwoCents I am writing you for advice. Here the situation. I have Asus Strix X670E-E Wifi motherboard. Couple weeks ago I tried updating the bios(I bought the rig in January and has not updated since, so that is several versions behind) and right in the middle of the process there was a power failure (in the entire neighbourhood) for 1 second. Just power drop and instant back. Of course this killed my motherboard, error code 00 no boot. This motherboard is equipped with a special bios recovery feature that works without CPU installed or anything, emergency flashback. It has a specially designated USB port and a button. I used it, the bios flashed, no luck. Finally I was able to resurrect the board by removing the bios battery and letting it erase everything. The problems just start here. I THOUGHT the power failure during update messed up something in the hardware, but after this video I think it is the bios itself. The QCode displays every error code possible that ties to RAM. 37, 38, 40, 43, 44, 45, 53, 55, 67, 70, list goes on. And it never stabilizes, always changing. I had really really hard time making the system use EXPO settings (needed several CMOS clears). Aftermath: All is good besides the unstable error codes, no crashes yet. Just 3 things, all in random: Sometimes it fails to boot. I have to take the PC out from the power socket, let me totally depower itself, start again 2.) Sounds disconnects randomly, I have to switch sound output to monitor and back. 3.) Normally games run at 144 FPS. But sometimes they stuck at 15 FPS. Solved by 2-3 restarts All they symptoms kind of tick the list you said you encountered in the video. My config: AMD Ryzen 9 7950 XT AM5 socket, Asus strix RTX 4080, Corsair 1000 W power source (forgot the exact model, modular, gold), 64 GB CL36 Corsair 6000 MT DDR5 RAM, 2 TB Samsung 990PRO SSD  Question: Any chance future bios update solves these (by now minor) issues? Or are these indicators of actual hardware failure from the power outage? PS: The config worked flawlessly until the bios update. But Asus being Asus does not have the old January bios available on the website any more
Have ASUS become the EA of hardware? Shady, arrogant, and so big that quality come third to earnings and stock market flare?
Will Linus do the same
I never understood the preference of reviewers for asus boards. Their vrm solutions on the midrange are adequate at best.
I'm honestly surprised it's taken people this long to notice. I've been boycotting asus product for years now.  Overpriced, poor software and bad quality and terrible RMA service. No thank you.
Dear Jay,  I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to you today to request your assistance. I wanted to start by saying how much I appreciate the valuable content you create where you help people solve their computer-related issues. Your expertise has been a tremendous resource for me over the years.  I am writing to you with a question. Would it be possible for you to gift me a new gaming PC? Currently, I am using a PC that is nearly a decade old and has become very unstable. It tends to freeze frequently, and I often have to restart it multiple times. Additionally, I replaced the graphics card several years ago when it stopped working correctly.  I am not in a position to purchase a new gaming PC myself, and it would be a dream come true to be able to play the latest games without having to worry about my current PC's limitations.  Thank you for taking the time to read my message, and I hope to hear from you soon.  Best regards
You're opinion counts when start buying you're components like the rest of us
Thank you... I am busy looking at upgrade kits as I have a I5 3330,DDR3..... haha   Wanted to give Red a try but now... I guess I will stay by Intel as have all these years...
But put ALL Brand as garbage? Years with all my PC running Asus parts..never get any issue...
that's peraphs the only reason opensource is important...   you don't put a 300$ cpu on a 700$-1500$ motherboard, so they screw you 2000-3000$ in one wrong move..gratz the worst? if you don't follow assiduously the news, you just trust old  review..."asus is the best, it's worth every cents, upgrade bios is the best..." above trusting youtuber, you trust a  "iconic" world brand, like some trust apple ( and everybody know how many times apple screw his consummer with a hardware problem ^^)  you said asrock is more stable and reliable.....but asrock IS a spun off from  asus (the goal was the oem market)
I gave ASRock for the first time at the right time. ASUS has let me down a few times before, I was tempted by their Noctua collab and succumbed. No regrets, but as for mobos, I'm sticking to ASRock for now.
Looking at their crappy software my impression is this is another case of "then marketing came in and messed everything up." I pity those engineers who'd like to do better.
That Mega Man figure is DOPE! I have it and it's one of my favorite purchases, ever!
AMD is for suckers
We should all no longer buy from Asus until they threat their customer right.  Watch GamerNexus Video in how they reacted to the scandal. They (Asus )wanted to go on a plane and talk with them OPENLY (well open, means: Asus wanted to reduce the damage)  about that stuff, but after GN asked for that conversation to be recorded, they didnt respond. What a joke.
in 2016 I bought an Asus ROG G20 and got a free windows 10 upgrade when it released from bestbuy and after installing windows 10 I started getting ghosts appearing on my screen so I took it back to bestbuy and they damaged the computer out and gave me a brand new computer and told me after I installed windows 10 it corrupted my GPU which was a Nvidia gtx970, which at the time was top of the line cause 10 series hadn't even dropped yet. well got that computer home and downloaded WoW... same issue, took it back to bestbuy they plugged it in and had me log into my WoW account and they saw what was going on and they reached out to Asus. Asus told them it was something with windows 10 that was corrupting the gpu and so bestbuy ended up damaging out that computer and ended up giving me a 3rd computer
Never liked em. Never will. They've forever been overrated.
Hey Jay! I have the Z790 Gaming  E WIFI. This is not a cheap board. I have had constant issues with the AI OC feature of this board. I picked it out because my previous platform was Z490 and it worked amazing., I loved the ease  of the 1 click and go. Every time I update the BIOS while I have the AI OC enabled, it will completed, but then on the first reboot it will only black screen. Need to manual power off and then it boots like normal... really weird. I had the same issue on two boards now, and just decided to live with it. Its not everyday I update the BIOS. Problem does not occure when im using a manual overclock. I do test all my OC with prime 95 and cinebench... Asus tech support can only advise me to try a different ram kit or try a new cpu... mhhh okay let me just grab the extra ram and cpu for testing... I feel that Asus is out of touch with their clients. Should have bought the Gygabyte board that was $200 less expensive. On the bright side, Amazon gave me $120 back because of my frustration. But Asus did nothing for me...
Their armory crate has been trash lately. Had issues with headphones, and they didn't have replacement parts. My 2700x AMD build Asus crosshair vii board died after 4 years. I'm on the x570 chipset 5800x3D and I'll stay there. Next build will not have a single asus part.
Question is will the rog Ally be worth it if the quality of their hardware has gone down over the years
I always buy asrock and never had a problem, but recently it randomly will sit at the bios screen and won't do anything and  won't show any hard drives and randomly in the middle of the night my computer will turn on.
I used to only buy ASUS branded motherboards...... this has changed my mind as of now.  Do you happen to have a motherboard that you have tested with the 7900x that is not Asus that you recommend?
That warning message about beta bios is even hidden on the download page.. if you do not click the read more link you won't see that warning.
My 2 Asus machines have been solid...
So stick with MSI? Gotcha!
This makes me sad. ASUS used to be THE brand for me, but then they started having bad publicity and when looking for a 4070, I struggled to trust that they would protect me with RMA issues. I went with Zotac instead.
I’m super disappointed by all the negatives coming out on the Asus x670e boards. I’m just about to start my first custom build and I totally had my heart set on the Crosshair Hero because it’s ATX but had all of the capabilities (at least in theory) I wanted - all the other x670e boards either seem to leave something to be desired or are eATX (e.g MSI MEG Godlike), which won’t fit my case.  Any recommendations on a Crosshair Hero alternative? Online reviews seem conflicting!  NB. I’m still planning on going for a ryzen 7 7800x3d
Wow it's one thing when a company acts scummy like Asus has but to see this out of you doesn't paint you in the best light either as it's unprofessional in the extreme.
I have an Asus Tuf x570 mobo and a tuf 3080 10gb... Won't be going back to Asus any time soon! Literally haven't bought a thing from Newegg in forever because of their shit RMA process, similar to Asus here. RIP ROG Strix.
Avoid ASUS. Noted.
Asus is really slowly going downhill. Even the B550 ASUS Bios is weird. It has two seperate " AMD Overclocking " Sections.  One is basically the AMD one, the other one is the ASUS version. And trust me, you don't wanna use the Asus version.  While that allows you for more Mhz etc on the CurveOptimizer / PBO , the Voltage it pumps through is insane. At the same time clock stretching is real. 4.7Ghz allcore was stable but underperformed so badly it's insane.  Got a B550 RogStrix at the moment and I took the CurveOptimizer stuff reeeeeal slow. My B450 Prime before behaved a lot better.  Oh and yea, On the B550 the CPU clocks lower with the same settings used on the B450.. Like..What?! xD  I just hope the new board that I got gifted is gonna stay strong and they didnt fuck up anything with that BIOS, but since it's B550 and a 5600x I should be fine---ish... x) At least their GPUs are solid.
This year i've got PRIME X570-PRO paired with 5900x, nothing but problems, opened so many tickets (can't remember which bios was worse). Afterwards i've got 3070 TUF that was working in benchmarks, but crashing in games (tried around 20 drivers, underclocking, powerlimits, different configurations, diff bios, nothing), opened so many tickets. Swapped them for the other parts, and everything works just fine since then. Done with Asus for this year. Ps. the hardware that I bought by their terms "works", so I literally have semi-functioning hardware that cannot be used because it's unstable from the factory on default settings or even "sub-factory" settings.
It sucks because ASUS has the best looking components
A Asus ROG laptop screen died within a month. Never again!
13:53 short explain
Solid as an ass-rock  -Jay
This move is quite big when you think that Jayz won't be reviewing any Asus products from now on. It literally requires a huge courage and heart of steel.
This is why I recently went pre-built… Thanks Jay!
So happy im sitting here with my 3600 b550 MSI MB.  All your issues are Asus. Its pure MB.
Well Asus just got a severe wound.
1:00 who was the first?
6:58 It wasn't an RMA (a return), it was a board that they specifically _cherry picked_ and tuned specifically so that you get "the best" results. Which is a shitty tactic to make their products look good. And they most likely fucked up when they repackaged it. 13:14 Isn't ASRock a subsidiary of ASUS?
When ever you RMA something, make pics so you can proof what was working / not broken so the company can't screw you.
ASUS and nVidia are both right now so fucking far out of their minds and have both lost touch with the community that it’s a joke. I’ve had issues with ASUS products since 2010 when my first ever laptop kept having its DC adapter inside the system desolder itself from the motherboard. Then I had a issues with a motherboard when I got a prebuilt using mostly their parts (before I switched to building my own) I lost faith in them a long time ago. MSI did me dirty on the gpu side. But their motherboards have been the best I’ve used. If only evga stayed in the gpu market but went team red. They are and hopefully will remain a delight to work with when it comes to the rma process. Their example should be the GOLD example of what you should be doing in customer service and rma process.
I use ROG STRIX B650E-F with Expo enable the BIOS version is : 1222 02/24/2023 and the motherboard work find and stable.
Good on you for sticking with your principals and having our backs Jay!  Big thank you to you and your team.
I am so glad that in my last build I decided on ASRock after using ASUS for a decade.
guess im not going to be getting a new asus laptop. they were always my favorite laptops
All this while I've been dealing with an RMA on a very expensive AIO from them for 3 weeks now, because they're trying to send me a lesser cheaper one in place of my ryujin 3 LOL
Half of my pc is ASUS and next time it won't be the same
One other thing, Asrock was spun off from Asus as a cheaper brand for lower quality stuff. Now looks like Asrock is better then Asus.  How times changed.
I have not bought or recommend Asus since I took the cooler off my gtx970 and the heatsink surface looked like it had been polished with 50 grain sandpaper. I had bought it NIB.
______stuff. 😂
I swapped from asus to GigaByte for my last build, and very happy with it.
after this my next board will be gigabyte or msi.
I still remember when ASROCK were the "Avoid, its the cheapest trash you can get" stuff, never could have imagined that they manage to become more recommendable than ASUS
Im and ASUS fanboy and I'm on a 9th gen Intel board. I guess my next upgrade will be MSI
Asrock have always been really stable for me, i have used for them for 7-10 years now
Man just made a PC with full ROG stuff like a month ago. Been having tons of issues with what I assumed was the CPU (13900ks) and now I think it might be the MB
There keyboards and mouses are awful aswell updates never work on armory crate they just break your system more
I dono about msi is better than asus atm. Werent they "ransomwared" and refused to pay? Now their "windows trusted key" is in the air and people can make fake bios to fill msi products with malware. 🤔
Bye ASUS 😂
Asus is bullshit company very hard to make RMA to there stuff if u r end user  u pay for the name thats it
The thing is all they had to do was hold there hands up admit they fucked up and fix things. But they’ve gone into full damage control screwing over there customers and ruining there brand reputation which is going to take years to repair. Was it really worth it!!!!
so basically nothing really happened to you and yet you're already in somekind of a panic mode? Gotcha.
Disappointing, ASUS has always been my go to… But I am glad I did not upgrade to latest architecture.
What Asus already Said about This Jay?  I mean related to your and Nexus vídeos?
Had a very similar problem just a few days ago with an ASUS product that even getting a new one in return wouldn't work. And that was sad. Now I am enjoying life with another company's product
From Eisenhower High School to firing ASUS 😂😂 what a time to be alive in.
This is unfortunate. I pretty much only bought ASUS motherboards, up until hearing about this. Now I gotta look elsewhere I guess.
I started losing trust for Asus when bought my first PG279Q monitor, Dead on arival, horizontal lines, returned it got another one... same issue... reutnred that aswell and got my 3rd that worked for a few years and then again... horizontal lines...  for the price of the monitor that is just completly unacceptable.. I would expect more from a monitor one 4th of it's price
nice to see stuff like this finally come out i have been having a lot of issues with thier boards since x470/z390 got MSI boards and everything has been working without a hitch
is this the year of suicidal companies? im certantly not buying asus again
Bravo good sir. I gotta say i'm glad this is becoming more known to the consumer and they need to be called out on it. If i would have known several weeks ago of this nonsense, i wouldn't have built my new system using their mobo. Hopefully more outlets will get this out to everyone because the real power is the voice of the people.
its kind of insane because for a long time asus was the de-facto best. it's what i told everyone to buy because it's worth it.
considering i will be building a new pc in the near future to replace my current build, this is extremely helpful. I loved asus and I am sad to see that they are doing crap like this. I hope they change their ways, but I guess I will be moving to MSI for my next build.
Meanwhile Lenovo is sitting in the corner laughing
Thus truly is jayz2cents
i remember having an ASrock mobo back in the day and moved to ASUS with an am3+ platform. seems we need to head back to ASrock either MSI?
Never had a good time with ASUS for anything other than monitors since I started building 15 years ago
Well damn... That makes me take another look at what I plan on doing.. Got another build coming in about 1 to 1-/2 years....
Msi all me life.. not a single problem ever, since late 2000's
What mobo for 7800x3d would you recommend? What brand?
Nice move Jay. Now Asus have removed this warranty void thing from their bios update page.. 😂
I think the first motherboard I ever bought was the ASUS P2L97 LXI for the Pentium II.  ASUS quality and reliability were what kept me coming back to them time and again.  In light of their steady decline over the last couple years, I just bought my first MSI Tomahawk board the other day and couldn't be happier.
Hah, I love the swearing voiceovers :D
This is what happens when let arrogant mega-corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, John Deere, Ford, ... dictate policy, bend/change consumer laws and get away with practically anything in terms of consumer treatment, usually dictated or "advised" by the legal and/or PR departments backed up by lobbyists "buying" politicians. Always crossing the line a tiny bit and pushing that line more and more towards the consumer in order to erode all our rights.  Now the smaller companies have started to adopt (or like asus : have already adopted) these same business strategies to become "standard policy" and this is the result : anti right to repair, inferior quality products (that die as soon as the warranty period ends), more and more warranty limitations, refusal to take responsibility for anything (shift the blame to the consumer or another company), subscription based models for everything they can think of (airbags, anyone ???), the "you can buy our product but you don't own it"-philosophy, ...
ASUS support overhaul incoming
I have to say, I also have ram stability issues. Right now I'm forced to run Expo-30-36-36-76@1.4v kits with 36-40-40-56@1.42v to be stable, I specifically paid premium for these dominator kits because they had cl30, instead I get this... Also, if I don't turn off C-States in my 1000$ ShitSUS bios, I am not stable on stock settings in prime95, STOCK settings... Last time I buy from Asus. Oh and I'm not mentioning all the rest of the weirdness, like motherboard "AniMatrix" LEDs freezing everyday, to the point that I had to disable LEDs on motherboard... Absolute trash.
Honor, Courage, and Commitment.  Thumbs up bro.
Now im wondering if its my Asus motherboard or my Asus GPU that caused some of my monitor settings to gray out and never come back again, no matter to which I plug it in. Literally went on a holiday for a week and then came back and this happened. Neither support was able to help or even identify the cause.  In my mind, Asus products were always expensive but very reliable. Well, I guess those days are over.
I Was about to go a  asus psu  im  not  getting it  now
Well done Jay! Ive been using Asrock for over a decade maybe try them lol
I’ve been running my 3950X since launch on an Asus B450-E . Since day 1 I’ve always dealt with weird issues from time to time. I’m the type that completely shuts down my computer every night. In the last 2 months the issues have been getting worse. Everything from Blue screens to random restarts to disabling XMP to sound dropping out to sometimes my M.2 games drive or my primary M.2 C drive not loading to random failure. I’ve always been an Asus user however like you I’m done.  Originally I planned to upgrade to Ryzen 7900X3D but with all the issues with 7000 series I think I’m just gonna get a new motherboard for my current rig!   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
I'm still waiting for a viable BIOS with my ASUS mainboard. Not buying ASUS ever again, and currently unsure whether to replace the mainboard or maybe even get rid of the CPU too and go back to Intel. The 7800X3D was the first time I got an AMD CPU for my Desktop PC as far as I remember.
Asus 🤝🏼 Thermaltake -> being pieces of shit.
"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”
im worried now just bult my gf a pc using an asus rog B550-f board 😰
x570 dark hero 8 or was it 7 idk anymore 500 euro board wont turn on the next day it has power and the only fix is to turn of the PSU and w8 til power is gone in the mobo then turn it back on and now you can turn the it on again we where told at some point that it wil be fixed with a bios update it never happend i have know and seen people RMA the board 3 times only to get the same board or a new one back and it still happing also had problems on z370 intel boards ram XMP does not work at all no matter the kit it wont boot chance things by hand and now it works do some stabilty testing for 2 day  all seems good 1 month later system can no longer boot get stuck in memory loop reset bios and redo ram again it does not work any more try for a full day messing with timings nothing can only run stock try again next week (maybe i overlooked something) just loaded the saved profile again and now it works??????? ASUS is a mess cheap or high end mobo its all the same problems.....
This is such a slap in the face. I've been using nothing but Asus-boards in all my builds since... well... forever. Think my first one was the P4P800. I guess I was lucky when I cheaped out last year and went MSI for my current build - simply because their Z690 Tomahawk offered more bang-per-buck than the Asus TUF I was also eyeing. Sad times, indeed... :(
My first Board for my 7950x3d, Was Asus, and it would only boot 1/15 times. I got an MSI carbon motherboard, same cpu and same all parts boots first time without even bios update.
my z690 strix disconnects my usb ports randomly to my VR set.  dont use it anymore
Damn it, got a crosshair hero coming in a week or two... Screw it, I'll give it a chance, maybe the gods of silicon will smile upon me and I won't have to return it.
I used to sell Asus and AsRock boards when ASRock first released, many years ago, and the RMAs on the ASRock were significantly lower at the time. Not surprised ASRock has been solid.
That's my luck. For me, the look of my pc is irrelevant 🤣 When I play I lok. on my Monitor, when I don't play it's off 🤷🏼‍♂️
It's a brand that has put it's fingers in to many pies. I have been a Asus fan since the P4c800e but now worried. I haven't had a problem yet but with all this going on I am going to another brand. Some of us cannot afford to have mishaps
I think you are 100% correct in your decision.... Well done - and yes, I've watched all 3 videos that Steve put out. I was shocked at their, (Asus) arrogance!
Just when EVGA stops making graphics cards is when I start buying EVGA motherboards. I couldn’t be happier with the board and I really wish I had a card to go with it. Here’s to hoping EVGA keeps up the good work with the boards at least. 🍻
Damn  Good thing I got the MSI X670e Carbon because I almost got that Asus board. Running solid on my 7800x3d
I wonder what ASUS their reply will be on this video here and Gamers Nexus video 'Grabs Popcorn'. But it is always sad to see a big brand that everyone trusted screw (or maybe even scamming could be applied here) everyone over. I'm happy to see that you and your team are willing to take this step to make sure that you can continue be a channel that we can all trust and enjoy.❤‍🔥
I'm glad to see Jay put his two cents into this issue, now I'm curious if Linus is going to weigh in as well.
It's all about profit. No quality assurance, beta testing, durability testing. Cutting corners to maximize profits , then using lawyers to avoid warranty claims. Pure capitalism.
I have been using Asus for literally every gen Ryzen or Intel and recently with my Z790 Maximus Hero with the 13900ks I have all sorts of "minor" issues maybe I should swap a different board and sus it out.
I moved away from ASUS back in 2018 and couldn't be happier
My wife and I both use 5000 series AMD builds. Hers is an asus board and has been nothing but problematic (and apparently no warranty support). Mine is an older gigabyte - rock solid.   I've used them for decades (my 1997 retro build is using an asus board) and this is what they want to do now? Fuck asus.
The only logical picks as of 2023 are Asrock and EVGA...heck..even Biostar. Can't no longer trust MSI, Gigabyte and ASUS...oh how the mighty have fallen
Wow! Sad to see Asus go down hill like that.  Will be interesting to see if the CEO will do some house cleaning and replace certain managers with ones that will be more customer focused.
I've been using Asus since my very first build, I've built friends and families computers exclusive to Asus, Im definitely going to have to start researching Other motherboard brand's now.
Speaking of asus, the oled monitor PG27AQDM is smacked of bugs
Jay I’ll be happy to own your white board, I’ll gladly take both and try to fix it
How many smaller influencers are getting sent busted board then accused of damaging themselves & being forced to pay for them?
We all need to band together and BOYCOTT ASUS
I've had zero issues with any of my Asus products (I've owned over a dozen the last 7 years). I'll stick with them. It's not just Asus that is having issues and it's not just the PC industry. This is a GLOBAL issue in literally every single industry. COVID literally fucked the entire production chain top to bottom. And will take years to fix and get back to a "normal" state. That's the reality right now.
Take the AS delete the US and Rock. ASRock. Dwayne Johnson makes a darn good main board and UEFI/BIOS firmware. Not perfect! Yet Yet ... Has not blown up! I do like when my system doesn't HALT AND CATCH FIRE! Slightly important?
This doesn't look good for the new Asus handheld.
Well I'm glad you put out this video cuz I was about to buy at asus motherboard this weekend My friend was shopping too
Now I know what board not to use when I build my AMD 7000 system.
i just want to be able to rely on a manufacturer :( come ON ASUS
gigabyte is as bad..
After 6 months of use, my ROG 850 W PSU connectors burnt down. When I contacted them they said it was my fault altough didn't explain how. That happened like a year ago and I will never purchase anything else from them.
i wonder is this part of the climate cult agenda? meaning is ASUS a captured company, now reaching for the "greater good" as set forth by the insane "democratic socialists" fascist left wing? because they've been trying to shut down the build your own pc industry for quite a few generations now..
Such a shame i always recommended asus products to my friends after i was done with gigabyte products. Gigabyte used to be amazing back in 2005-2012. And then they started making absolute garbage! Seems like asus is taking the same route
Capitalism sucks
This is like Peter's "You Know What Really Grinds My Gears" episode from Family Guy. The video sounds more like an ultimatum towards Asus to get his contract finalized. I will be looking forward to him "REALLY" not using Asus.
Should I be worries about mine? I have a 7900x3d and x670e-f. Most of the dead cpus so far seem to be 7800x3d?
This sucks, its always incredibly disappointing to see an industry leader in quality throw their reputation in the garbage and use their name alone to chase slight improvements in profit margin as they gut the actual good parts of the company.
I am no genius in PC tech, bought a ROG Strix Z690-e Gaming WIFI in view of a new build...kinda nervous now about it.  what am i looking for before i assemble the shit together.
MSI's RTX 3060 Ti VENTUS 2X (fans were running at max under normal load. issue never corrected, users loading BIOS from other manufacturers), Gigabyte's exploding PSUs (and subsequent mishandling of the issue) and now the current debacle with Asus. I think what you are doing by cutting ties with Asus, in protest, is the way to go. But, where I live, us regular consumers don't always have that option.
ASUS... We put the SUSS back in motherboards.
I have a Asus Strix B350F Gaming that have constant audio issue. The sound will be corrupt and the screen went black. As long as you are using the sound card it will fail within 30mins.
I genuinely wanna know if there is any major brand in the PC world that hasn't fucked up so badly in this decade? MSI with their sneaky shit that GN reported in 2020, ASrock with their problematic boards, Gigabyte and their explosive PSUs + the gaslighting afterwards and now ASUS.  All of this makes building a PC into playing a hard game of Minesweeper and it will result in the PC market shrinking badly.
you should of thrown one of those boards across the room
Asus hasn't been good at least where I live in since 2012  Asrock on the other hand around that time started being the "premium motherboard manufacturer"
Makes me wonder how they are gonna support the ally a year after launch
Asrock all the way
Asrock
And I just bought an ASUS board...
Asus did a gigabyte.
Just based on the title, you can't fire Asus without firing the rest of them. MSI has been a malignant tumor on the PC world off and on and consistently for a decade, not long ago. Maybe they still are? Gigabyte has been downright criminal off and on over the last two decades. ASRock has been putting purposely dumping garbage onto the market for some time, after starting as garbage and then becomes something decent, their decent into being a garbage dealer seems willful.   ASUS is the Intel of the motherboard industry. They have simultaneously put out excellent products, terrible products, purposely offered an awful idea of customer service, yet innovated, but charged higher than necessary prices and worse, were generally anti-consumer over all. Just like Intel. So there it is. Everyone stop buying their products for a time, like a year or year and half. The length of time has to be enough to have true effect, beyond cash reserves and capital raising. Tell them why you won't buy their products. This is critically important. Mass numbers telling them this along with act of not buying will make them listen. Probably not at first, but a few months down the road, they WILL change or they WILL die. Someone else will fill the void. Nature abhors a vacuum.  It's the same with any business, service or organization. By the way Jay, anyone who has ever shilled for Intel and you have, Nvidia and you have, accept sponsorships involving their products and you have and/or shouted their wonderfulness from the mountaintops (figuratively speaking of course) and you have,  it's strange for you call out ASUS. Why? The aforementioned two have been consistently anti-consumer for decades, as in plural, multiple, continual. Regarding Intel and Nvidia, "We can't review products based on their chips because the are too anti-consumer to give them the time," is the only appropriate course of action. Yet, still, you did review and you will continue to do so. "It just works," and "just buy it." Remember?
Remember last year when Gamers Nexus called out Newegg for their shady product return process? Newegg's stock value (NEGG) has dropped over 75% since then, and it's currently the lowest that it has ever been. Their stock value is usually somewhere in the teens and 20's, but right now it's about $1.
I’m done with Asus as well the support I got was horrible sending a laptop for rma. They wanted me to give them $1600 to get a $2000 laptop fixed!
Just a disappointment. For quite some time they made such nice boards. They were always a little overpriced  but now they overpriced and acting scummy
Why I feel it's a personal problem and not related with parts.
Built first PC, mid 2020,  bought  an Asus X570 board .  Will look at other manufacturers when I upgrade to AM5.
Was thinking of going asus with my next gpu, not anymore! Ill let someone else tale my 1000$
asrock is underrated, i have a asrock taichi z790 smooth sailing since day 1 i bought it .
Been done with them since they screwed me over with an RMA in 2018. They sent me 4 DOA motherboards over 3 months.  I gave up and just bought an MSI. Almost failed a college course because I didn't have a decent computer to run the required software. ASUS Prime x370 if anyone cared.
I have an AMD rig and an Intel rig…love them both.   I recently upgraded my Intel rig from a 9700k to a 13700k and absolutely blown away with the performance.  And to think I had seriously considered waiting for the 7800X3D….dodged a bullet.
Well, for what I can see this only happens to AMD motherboards. But yeah, seems ASUS going to be shitty to their customer of something they self destroys by their BIOS Update and washes their hands, saying it is YOUR fault that your CPU burned up. I mean c'mon you just using ASUS's software, a company you rely on and have done so for years. I will upgrade my PC to a I7-13700KF, the only option for that bundle is a ASUS motherboard. I hope it doesn't go wrong when I am fixing the stuff.
damn... i just bought an asus tuf motherboard
Commenting for algo blessing bc this is a pog video
Thanks for the honesty Jay. It makes me sad- I have a 2022 G14 and a ROG Strix motherboard in my desktop build. Both have been super solid, but all of this anti-consumer behavior will definitely have me looking very carefully when I decide to upgrade in a few years. Thank goodness independent media is here to keep these large corporations in check. Thank you Jay!
I'm not current gen w my cpu(i9 9900k) so I am using an Asus Maximus XI Hero and I've never had an issue and would even say I'm happy with it up until I watched this. I am honestly ashamed to have it in my system and when I upgrade, which will be soon I will be going with a different brand. I will probably go with NZXT and their white NT Z970 w/ an i9 13900K or KS. Need to do a bit more research but, on the surface I really like what NZXT is doing and the relative simplicity behind their style. I will also say that I have stood by ASUS and anything that could have been ASUS was, at least for system hardware. I will not be continuing that trend either.   RIP RoG(Republic of Gamers) it's a shame to see you thrown away and replaced with another RoG(Republic of Garbage)
Wow. I bet Jays kids avoid screwing up a lot. On the other hand maybe they go for it just to see this shining butt kicking delivered in full.
I have the hero board paired with a 7900x. Not sure if this is an X3D problem solely but I haven't had any problems yet and hope I don't. Everything else on the board is working fine minus the usual USB dropping in and out all the time which asus is known for.
I admire JTC for having the guts to speak out and take action. Hopefully others will do the same - why wouldn't they? . Strength in numbers will send the necessary message and stop customers being treated like dirt - since it's now obvious that's all we are to Asus.  I as a former customer/mug also decided not to put up with this level of arrogance. "Give us your money, you piece of crap, take this piece of crap and don't bother us again unless you want to give us more money for more crap".  So now we don't.
Thanks for you honesty here Jay and not going after the money.
Time for EVGA to take over the motherboard market.
My asrock board has been nothing but problems... asrock x570 taichi razer edition.....
"F"
I've been using ASUS' TUF line for the last... gosh, I want to say 15 years? I always had found their motherboards to be the most stable, most efficient ones on the market. Sure, I paid a premium for maybe 1-2 FPS less, but the stability and peace of mind that came with those was worth far more to me. And when I changed my systems, I would sell my old system at a ridiculously low price to a close friend who's means are far below mine, and the systems all still run to this day. She and her family uses those old ASUS-based computers, one of which is an old 2nd gen i7. Video cards were replaced, RAM was replaced... but the boards were all A-1.  Now? I wonder where I can turn to to have similar stability and quality as the TUF line offered. Because this development really shook my confidence in ASUS' products. I always saw the TUF line as the "highest reliability" line, which is what I'm after. And I guess I'll have to look at other brands whom might offer a similar line... if they do. And if they don't, let this be a message to those companies: offer a "heavy-duty", "rugged", "high reliability" line of products. Please. Take on what the TUF line stood for, and make it even betterer. We need you.
Hehe 😄 watching this on a smashed zenfone 4. That I absolutely love. 😖
I have been using Gigabyte Motherboards and Intel CPUs since the early 90s,  I never had a single motherboard/CPU issue.  A couple of years ago I moved to AMD Ryzen and Asus motherboard.  I have USB issues and sound issues that I put down to Linux changes but now starting to doubt that.    Looking at an upgrade in the very near future, will either go back to Gigabyte or maybe ASRock.  Thanks for being straight up Jay.
AMD please made Motherboard !!!  Asus ,MSI ,Asrock and other its garbage (((
I JUST ordered an RTX 4080 from ASUS >:( welp.
I took that decision 10 years ago, because of a bad laptop with bad support. Good decision!
At this rate they might end up the next DFI.....as everyone under 40 goes, who?
I've avoided Asus for a while (circa 2018) because of random software issues I was fed up with, but I would always say it was a personal choice and the hardware is actually impressive and most people don't have issues... but it looks like I need to change that advice.
Boycott the brand.
All the big brands suck but ASUS are hands down the absolute biggest dicks in the industry. They seem to think they're too big to fail & people will buy their crap no matter what because of their ROG marketing machine.
I really appreciate the fact this channel is all about facts, and truly here to help you with modern technology. It is very informative. Please continue with great work you guys do.
So, top 3 motherboard brands now?
I got a defective ASUS motherboard. When I sent it back for RMA I was sent a photo of a crushed pin. They claimed I had damaged it. Total bull. The pin was not bent when I mailed it to them. There was zero chance I had caused the damage in that photo.
Tbh I think, eventhough yes this is not ok, Asus in general just does a better job than anyone else on the market. I had an MSI motherboard, 11900kf and a 360mm MSI Aio. My CPU would never be cooled lower than 50 degreece celsius (WITHOUT OVERCLOCK). Guess which AIO leaked and fried my (back in the day) 1k Euro 3070 ti cuz its just so cheaply made? Yes. The one from msi.   Even theoretically. The overclocking on those motherboards is so OP,  my pc wouldnt even boot if turned on on an 11900k ?!  Now Im on Asus ROG, the AIO is doing an INSANE job: 13900k overclocked being cooled down to 38 degreece, and it just works and I dont have to worry about my pc not turning on anymore.
very good, you are right
I stopped buying ASUS in 2001 due to unreliable laptop builds. Never went back, never will. It’s all about cool looking boxes, eye candy 🍭
Yeah my work Asus X670E booted once on 6400, then once on 6000, now it runs 5200 no expo and its unstable. rip to that 7950x3D. Recently upgraded my own setup to a Gigabyte x670E 7950x3D, becauseeeee **drummrolls please** my Asus AM4 Rog Hero board finally completely died, and killed a ram stick and corrupted my raid1 nvme's . Fuck 'em (the 3900x and 5950x in that setup, now both live a happy life on two MSI B550 boards)
Experienced a few of these issues, I'm never buying ASUS again.😢
I used an ASUS board for the first time for my AMD build in 2020 and it was an absolute mess. USB issues until today still. Only got better after a couple BIOS updates. Still not running resizable BAR as it leads to crashes... Tried to RMA, but the support is an absolute mess as well.
My worst build was with Asus Prime X670-P... It has caused me nothing but a headache... I'm so sorry I bought that motherboard. It is spouse to be my stable creator machine for 3d modeling/rendering, no overclock just stock settings, R9 7900, 2x32GB@6000MHz, 1TB KC3000,  RTX 4070, Seasonic PX 850W... Sometimes it boots after 1-2 minutes sometimes it take it like 5... I first thought my RAM was corrupt (Kingston Fury 2x32GB, 6000MHz, CL 40), but no...  In a last month or so Asus has 4 new BIOSes (2 beta and 2 stable), and it still not working as it should. So disappointed in Asus.
isnt asrock owened by asus?
Jay our KING 🤴
I fired Asus motherboards 10 years ago.  The door is open for someone to come in and take away market share.
I heard the dub of stuff then
Asus was my go-to when I build a new PC 😂  need to find a new brand next time
You're absolutely right Jay, I'm so glad that I didn't buy Zeus's sensibly sized 4070Ti even though fitting a larger one in my case was a pain in the butt. I commend your decision to no longer have truck with them. If every channel did this perhaps it would shock Asus into maning up and accepting responsibility for their actions. As a fellow enthusiast it was saddening to see your last build go the way it did, it must have been intensely frustrating. It's also sad to lose a trusted supplier, I hope there's someone left at Asus who can turn things around and rebuild the trust they've lost. I expect an entry level mobo to work correctly, but when you spend extra for an upmarket board at a considerable premium, it just isn't on. Some of the info that's come to light about Asus's underhanded way of dealing with customers, not a good look.
I reflashed my bios back to the latest stable build after seeing this. Thank you, Jay. Current owner of an Asus B650E-E Gaming Wifi motherboard. I had a BIOS which, surprisingly was taken down from their website and i remembered that it was an article saying they took it down because of the voltage and stability issues ( i have a 7700x, thankfully). For the first time being on ASUS motherboard, and yet, they have bigger issues than other manufacturers because of their own greed. I was shocked, and they cost a ton of money.
I fix those smashed pin boards bare eyed with two sharp needles - if none of those pins are sheared off I can make her a solid runner.
Damn. Seeing this scares me from buying the ROG Ally since im in the market for a handheld PC...
I changed to gigabyte when Z690 was released, always had asus before... i had super wierd issues since that, but after like 5-6 month and a bios update i finaly have 0 issues. I build my wife a 5600x Build on a ASRock Mainboard... it never stopped working... (LOL i started righting this before you mentioned them in the video...)  i will go ASRock on the next PC aswell, will take a while tho... 13900k and a 4090...  damn...
No surprise, since Asus boards for AMD have always been the worst compared to other brands, by far.  And it has always always felt like Asus didn't put nearly as much effort on AMD boards as they did with Intel boards, when with other brands it felt like they did actually put a similar amount of effort for both AMD and Intel. That, compounded with the quality of Asus Intel motherboards also declining... well, it's not surprising it ended this way.
I've been waiting for a BIOS update since the x3D burnout started happening. I'm running a 7700x so hopefully not a super-pressing risk for me but I'd like to be in the best position I can. But their option being pushed on the motherboard support page has been beta every time I've looked and I really don't want to touch that either.
I had the same experience with my Asus X670e Boards. Ordered them at release, had 3 boards with issues. Pins were broken and stuff like that. Thought it was an issue with the Shop I ordered from or an issue with the delivery service. I guess maybe I blamed the wrong guys?!
Can you recommend a reliable brand as an alternative to Asus?
its a sabotage from their employees 😁
Well now i have a asus tuf b560m-plus wifi and now i'm worried as I only upgraded in 2021 with the asus tuf b560m-plus wifi and intel I7 11700. Should i be worried or is it only the newer models that are problematic?
You know this sucks to hear! I don't pay attention to the PC channels much anymore and I was contemplating a new build.. my aging 9000 series Intel processor isn't holding up so well these days and now I don't know what to use since Asus played this fuck fuck game.
Not to mention how ASUS abandoned the AI-Suite-3 application with the mediocre Armoury Crate, included with an audacious AI-Suite-3 cleaner. It's all about the Brand for ASUS now. Very disappointing. I hope they get their A$$US together!
100% respect for your decision to fire them. That "Beta bios" manoeuvre, tricking people to update to fix but void the warranty is disgusting practice.
Everyone is excited about th asus rog ally and after watching you and some other peeps that been having issues with asus. I don't think Asus rog ally is going to be smooth as people think it is.
I hope their refreshed b450 boards are still quality
Imagine, the pull you have, now imagine, the pull the normal person has... yeah. Best to give ASUS the skip, overpriced trash at this stage.
Wow all those reason was why i was buying Asus Mobo. Its been over 20 years now that i, using Asus and i can confirmed what jay saying. Saddly, i will have to go to an other manufacturer for mobo now. I really don't know where to go now. I Hate MSI since the begining. They was making so much shit in the start of 2000. MicroStar. Gigabyte RMA are just insane so i dont want them too. AsRock... damn really ?
I'm so glad for this video, I was about to build a high end all Asus parts rig which I've been saving up for a long time now, as I always trusted the brand and I always swore by them, I am now going all msi now.
I had 2 gaming laptops form ASUS, first one was great and loved it, second one was much worse, I had to send it to warranty repairs because keyboard died twice, and one time when they were replacing stuff they broke cooler fans. Customer support was horrible and I promised that I will not buy their product again. Bought XMG. Screw you ASUS.
In my view, Asus went unreliable roughly around 2005. From then on, I used their motherboards occasionally when others were out of stock at the distributor, and at least once I've had to purchase a replacement retail to get the customer up and running again just out of warranty. I've used Gigabyte as the goto quality board up until a few years ago when I started experiencing mostly minor issues that could indicate design or qc problems. So a few years ago, I switched to MSI, which was one of the unreliable brands back when Asus was to of the line late last centrury early this century but is just fine now... Just as I did with Asus years ago, I occassionaly fall back on Gigabyte when MSI is out of stock. Bought 2 Gigabyte A520 boards, one of them won't even run stable on a non-overclocked DDR4-3200 XMP profile.
Consumer: Your MB has put my CPU and PC on fire ASUS: Have you tried putting it off and on again?
it's so interesting to me, it took me almost 10 Years after boicoting ASUS, to go back and get Motherboard because of bad expiriences. I went with MSI in the meantime it was never crazy but it always worked. I just got back to ASUS last year with a creator MB because of the features and now this is going on.🙈 Well the MB is going to be the only ASUS part in my system for now.
Asus doesnt even know how many people wont buy their product anymore just because of this video i have a $800 motherboard from them was considering an upgrade and now i will not be buying asus
Thx jay for the good advice  Now for sure I go for Intel for my new pc Put all I need it's a video on the Evga bios step
Thank God I moved onto msi this build. Had 2 Asus board failed on my x670 and thought I was unlucky. Guess I am not the only one.
So, it’s safe to say that you’re no Ally to ASUS ROG products?
Well I have never really trusted Asus. Especially after my TF700t Tablet stopped performing well a few months after purchasing it. Its not an isolated issue too, everyone complained that the onboard storage chip degradated rendering the device useless but nothing was ever done.   Just like I do not trust Acer quality on their laptops... mine died after 8 months of use.  Hope they come to their senses and sort this out.
Used ASRock in many builds... NEVER had any problems since 2012~2013
My TUF 690 is undervolting. Support is useless. Will never buy Asus mobo again.
Amazing job Jay  I bought an asus mobo 3 months from now and i can’t return it :/
If there is an employee who is quitting or otherwise leaving the company, how could this ex-employee do the most amount of damage to their former company?  Put a bad unusable product in front of a massive influencer.  It would be a quick way to hurt the company.  They would use that issue as a story.  Im not offering an excuse for ASUS, but I wanted to point out how influencers can be manipulated to work for others.   You dont like ASUS I dont like MSI.  I wont buy products from MSI who has done me wrong in the past. If you were to get products out of the normal channel the rest of us get our products from a reseller and had the same problems then its believable.
I usually only buy gigabyte motherboards and gpus I go with sapphire and zotac.
I am working on doing a build and I am glad I waited. I was going with an Asus ProArt but now no way.
ASUS does not care but i as a consumer do. I have had 1 asus device in last 10 years and had problem with it. Seemed long time shaky brand to me even though media praised it constantly as the best. Now wanted to buy Rog Ally but am not sure anymore. Linus had problems with his device during review as did some other reviewers. Quess have to wait Valve to make steam deck 2.
sad to think that at one point they were the top dog, the sought after product. and their overall QA seems to have gone to crap.
I just had a nightmare of an experience with ASUS Z790 Maximus Hero it took an entire month for a RMA and refund, it was finally resolved but it took a month of stress and aggravation
Damn just bought an asus gpu guess it's going back
I'm having the USD issues with my system! Been so annoying but I have a gigabyte board so idk
Glad to hear what you really think lol. Sad. Asus was always my favorite.
Respect Jay 🙏
Yeah, I sadly only have bad experince with asus, ever. Motherboads and a GPU. Different kind of things, like a fried 5820k. I am actually currently fighting to get my money back for my 6900XT TUF since it never worked correctly, but sadly they declined everything regarding RMA.. so yeah. The only reason I bought that GPU was because I needed a new, powerfull one, and wasnt ready to pay over 3000€  for a 3090 in the middle of the gpu crisis. That gpu also had more then terrible coilwhine. Nearly 60dBa of coilwhine.
Thank god was about to go ASUS with my new AM5 Build.  Now i'm switching to Gigabyte JUST IN CASE.  Kinda sad since i also wanted to go Asus for the asthetics but welp.
wow thats nuts...they send you an RMA that wasn't checked for pins?!...how...just...how. someone had to put the pin-protector on there?!  crazy. reminds me of the time another brand send out broken MBs and refused RMA or blamed the client.
Im so glad i saw this video. I swore that asus was a good brand left and right, but after this video i will not buy another asus branded anything anymore.
i don't know but this is not only a problem with amd. i think that there is a probleme with win 11. my usb stack keeps crashing in random intervals. the sound crackels and dropps out and every usb device crawls to a halt. mouse, keyboard, controller, rtl-sdr, soundcard, usb-stick everything needs a moment to come back. some software can't output sound after that until you restart the software. i really do hate win 11. i'm not shure if it's only windoof or if it has something to do with the mainboard and drivers as well.
Do you remember Asus old slogan "Rock Solid - Heart Touching"? I think ASRock should use it now.
EVGA motherboards rule!  My opinion... of course... this is subject... upon the "application."  Stay Awesome, Jay!  < fist pump >
HATS OFF for you Jay
i stopped using their mb years because of their flaky boards
Been a big supporter of Asus.  Even did right by me 2 years ago when a gpu died out of warranty and sent me a free replacement. Its sad to see a brand that went from being quality and trusted to this monstrosity.  Its par for the course though with every big business these day.  They get high on their horse and forget how they got there.
Not trying to be a hater here, but I've had issues with Asus for years...  I use a ton of different hardware and go through a lot of motherboards and so on, and the experiences I've had with Asus make it just not worth buying anything from them.  I had an Asus AMD E350 board which had a ground fault and caused arcing when inserting a VGA/DVI cable. It blew up and Asus refused to replace it whilst under warranty. I've had several Asus laptops where I've needed to apply BIOS updates to fix issues and updating it bricked the machines. Asus each time asked for me to pay more than the cost of the laptop for replacement boards.  The last nail in the coffin for me was my B350i STRIX board with my Ryzen 1800x constantly crashing and they said it was a VRM and voltage issue and supplied me with a BIOS fix. That BIOS fix didn't brick the board, but one of the VRMs failed completely after 2 weeks of the BIOS update. Once again, they refused to RMA it, so I had to return it to the store for a refund.  I get that these things happen, but I never have these issues with any other manufacturer and I nearly always have my warranty honoured by other companies. 😠
When they started launching ROG systems without MUX chips, that was it for me. Will never buy Asus again.
Using an Asus TUF Z390 Plus and my audio jacks and built in network card stopped working all together. I now have a Creative Soundblaster soundcard and a TPLink network card.
your about a 6months late for me. I moved to MSI
How dare ASUS send us freebies of varying quality! We went new stuff, we want new stuff.
I wanted to buy there most expensive x670E board from asus because of the aesthetics but i am thinking about going with the msi godlike or other board which match aesthetics
I stopped trusting Asus a few years ago when I bought a ROG mousepad that developed air bubbles in between the cloth and rubber backing after a month or so of use after emailing them about the problem they put the blame on me saying I damaged it so they would have to charge me to repair it. Good to know I made the right decision on spending my money elsewhere.
Yes, Mine Rog Strix F B450 died not too long after warranty time. I got X570 from ASUS, because it looked best for the price. But I will probably be more cautious about them.
Damn it I just changed from an Asrock to Asus motherboard
So satisfying, thank you Jay ❤
To cut off the hand that feed you is a statement to say the least. Things like this and what Gamers Nexus do might actually make some difference since you can can reach much longer and much faster with the message.
Oh no, I have got on order the Rog Strix-E Z 790 to pair with a 13700k and I see this video, have I messed up? I have only built one pc before and used Gigabyte but hearing their RMA was useless (never had to RMA anything Gigabyte so wasn't aware) I decided to try ASUS and now hearing this I am panicking a bit that I am going to get a crap MB. Is it just AMD the issues are with or Intel as well? Appreciate any responses as Jays community seems to be knowledgeable and helpful so thanks in advance to anyone who can offer any insights. Also huge thanks to Jay, Phil and Nick for the content, excellent for both information and entertainment, just wish I had found this channel sooner!
Used Asus tuff x570 as my first ever build.. out of the 4 ram slots one of each caused stability problems soo I could pick random rgb flicker or can’t use xmp because it would not even boot, top it off the battery cmos stated to die.. nerd rage over 5000 thought I had a virus. (Many windows reinstalls and troubleshooting) Upgraded to MSI MAG X570S Tomahawk MAX WiFi, zero problems click xmp click each fan to pwm ,temps are lower and everything is snappy like premium experience. Just need a graphics card now 🤔 6700 xt is the goal with my 5700x cpu vs 2070 super Asus reference card.. thanks for the vid jay it’s real and honest can’t help but to respect 🫡 that
Is there some way to know which asus motherboards this is affecting. or is it just all of them
I 100% Agree. I have an Asus S17 Laptop 2022 Version, It costed me a whooping 3500$ to get the fully speced one. 11 Months after purchasing it while updating my bios the laptop restarted by itself and it turned into a dead laptop (Note that the warranty is 1 year after activating the laptop) that needed the bios chip to be reprogrammed. Calling ASUS's hotline after 15 minutes of wait. they took my information and literally said " Not our problem good luck with that " and hanged up the phone. a 3500$ Premium advertised laptop. Never buying Asus products ever again after being a loyal customer for more than 4 generations laptop and pc side.
It sucks because my build is almost complete - only an AIO to go and I was planning on getting an ASUS LC II or Corsair H150 Elite.  If ASUS are backing out of their warranties then that would make my mind up for me 🤷
you now just figuring this out .. about ten years ago I bought a Asus motherboard , and I returned it because of bent pins right from the factory .. In turn , I had to pay shipping charges back , then wait 3 months , only for them to give me a used board that did not work .. Sent that one back , and again , I had to wait about 2 months , and got a refurbished board again .. And it half worked .. Paid around $450 back then for this motherboard .. went with gigabit motherboards right after that , I quit buying high end boards .. I have been building computers , from the time Windows 3.1 came out ..
It's not Asus. It's ALL OF THEM. Every time i buy new HW, i step in shit.  e.g. i bought a 13700KF that could only use 4 PCIE Lanes to the GPU. Solution was to RMA it and get a new CPU. And don't get me started with USB incompabilities!
To be honest, every time I've touched MSI, I've gotten bitten worse than any of these asus stories. They've been on my shitlist for over a decade (and ironically, the last one i tried was ALSO one of the rare white motherboard unicorns, which they quietly discontinued) and show no signs of getting off of it. I've also been seeing the decline of asus; and since the B450/X470 generation have gone down the ASRock route. The funny thing about having a functional RMA department: If you're building your products right, You shouldn't need it to be large. I've used G.Skill ram in the last, mmm, 8 or 9 years, and had *one* RMA experience with them. Took down my serial number, and shipped me out a replacement under their lifetime warranty. "No, we don't need it back, but you won't be able to RMA the replacement." It was so painless, I kept buying from them... Again, and again, and again... wondering when I'd get the next bad stick. Gigabyte's Ultra Durable lineup are still running -- my eldest is a 1100T hexcore that's still limping along because it just refuses to die. FSP power supplies are another brand that has never let me down. Every penny I spend with Fortron since the FSP-350 from the tomshardware PSU fires article back in ~2002,  I feel I've gotten twofold back in reliability over time. Always overbuilt, always underrated.
I also like many of us have been a ASUS customer for over a decade, i will no longer buy their boards for myself or others.  My PC is doing crazy stuff too... i'm so done with them ZERO support.
Glad people are finally coming around to what I’ve been saying for years and years. Asus was always bad. Asrock was always average or amazing.   I’ve had issues with asus going as far back as the p35 platform for my q6600. Had an asus board which cause so many bsods, instability, stuttering and loss of fps in games. I got a second hand gigabyte board and lo and behold, all my issues were gone. I had an asus padfone 2(remember those?) which had a known issue where the storage chips would fry themselves. Asus never issued a recall for that. Later on my wife wanted a zenbook pro in 2019. Despite my best efforts she still got it. The build quality is horrible and the battery loses capacity after a year of use. Now she has a proart display. Its feature set and colour reproduction is top notch but the software is horrible. It will flicker every now and then at random times and  asus won’t help is out.   Wonder of wonders, I’ve never had issues with other manufacturers. I’ve had an asrock z97 board running 24/7 in my unraid server from 2014-2022. The 4790k in it was overclocked to 4.5ghz. Solid as a rock. Now my unraid runs on an msi x570 godlike with a 3950x. Also rock solid.
I k ow this might sound crazy but I have been having every issue you've me tinned lately on my crosshair hero vii.  Random blue screens error messages, devices randomly not working, random game audio loss mic input loss, and on top of that, the raid something driver failed blue screens
Asus Rog Ally buyers, unlucky 😂
I don’t get it … Jay is influential in IT.   How could ASUS possibly send him 2 defective motherboards ???
Imagine complaining about being sent free stuff.
I hope Tesla hasn't utilized any ASUS Crap in their automobiles. Could be disasterous, huh?
J2C & GN if u know u know! Consumers Advocates ALL THE WAY! TY Sir!
I usually won't buy into new tech until it has matured. So it's always good for people who try new things out for me to determine if they're worth buying. Always have my respect for build testers and commentators like here Jayz does. What is the best motherboard now since I wont be buying any ASUS boards moving forward
Maybe I was unlucky but lately (1-2 years overall), I 've own 3 ASUS motherboards for AMD and Intel and all of them ended up having problems with the jacks at the back of the motherboard... I do not know if it was hardware related or software or BIOS because the issues where all over the place.
I bought an Asus motherboard last year for my 12th gen Intel i5 and it crashed all the time. Even though my memory was within spec, it just simply could not be stable.
Thank you Jay❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So the issues with the new AMD CPUs, has actually been Asus all this time?
Clickbait Waaaah. I await the inevitable backpedal next week. Yawn.
Asus is no longer trustworthy, Gigabye has exploding power supplies, I had some issues with an expensive motherboard of theirs and one of their Aorus SSDs died althouth SMART said it was fine, MSI had some shady stuff going on in the past (remember GN's "Killshot" video?). Which of those brands can you still trust to spend money on a high end build?  Honestly, the most stable build here at my home is my wife's PC using a cheap Asrock board. No issues for years whatsoever. But for my next rig ... I have no idea where to turn to.
Props, Jay. You are easily one of the most trustworthy YouTubers out there.
So Asus is taking the flak for AMD releasing a shit platform and products?
GPU's are either overpriced or not in stock and QC becomes worse and worse day by day. It's dark times for PC enthusiasts. Was thinking of changing my rig of 9700k/Gig z390 mb/RTX2080 for some time, but with current trends I guess I'm fine as is. At least until nextgen consoles. And even then, I will seriously consider console - even though I never ever used console as my primary gaming device since, like, forever - and it is more than quarter of century gaming experience.
Jay, thank you for explaining what GamersNexus has been going on about for the past few weeks.
They’ve had issues back as far as the Z 790 when it comes to software issues
This video makes me literally cringe. Like, how convoluted are people to have a few bad happenings with a brand and then condemning it for eternity, after being more than happy with it for decades at this point. Do you not feel bad for this hypocrisy? Honestly, I have been working in IT for 20 years now roughly and the most RMAs I have ever seen in my life by FAR was MSI motherboards. Sure, they have gotten better since like 8 years ago but MSI was catastrophic at many points before. So now that Asus is annoying you a little, you simply forget about all the shit that MSI has pulled over the years. GOD, humanity. Asus has been nothing but ultra-PRO-Customer from my experiences with them over the years, being much more lenient with RMAs than almost all other Manufacturers, even often providing exchanges after the warrenty period UNLIKE MSI. If you go with any brand, sure, but MSI are literally the biggest scumbags of the industry...
Damn it! Since EVGA decided to leave the GPU space the only other brand I trusted till now was Asus. I do currently use a Taichi in my Intel build as it's steam punk work in progress. But damn it, if this keeps going we are just not going to have any brands to trust.
I always went for Asus motherboards, now i am changing to ASROCK
@Jayztwocents I purchased solely Asus motherboards over the past 6 to 7 years. At work. I've purchased the least 50 to 60 motherboards during that time. They've lost this customer. Thanks to you and gamers Nexus for exposing this. It's disappointing because I really did love their product. I also really like their Bios layout. I guess I'll be looking at MSI
I had an asrock mobo that would blackscreen whenever I inserted an m.2 drive. Even so, their pricing and their improvement on their quality over time has gotten me to buy a PG 6800 xt. I'm very happy with that card rn, and has re-established brand confidence for me. My cousin also got a 6650 xt challenger from Asrock and that's been serving him very well too
I also "fired" Asus for my family-builds beginning of this year... ok... they will not notice the 1 or 2 devices less I bought 😉 Years ago I did two builds with MSI instead of my usually recommendation ASUS - and they turned out to be solid, with good software-support and easily to maintain. So I had a good alternative.  And Asus f**** up on me with their Soundcards - resp. the way they silently seem to have abondened any software-development for their range of cards (still no Win 11 software and more and more struggles trying to get the outdated Win10-Software to run) - BUT they are not willing to admit to any end of live while they still sell units as new! Also had a pretty mediocre RMA-experience with one Asus-Notebook... so no kudos from that side either.  I'm pretty happy with MSI parts for some years now... and Gigabyte (maybe even AsRock) seem pretty good alternatives, too.  Btw. I'm also affected by this SOC-voltage on my MSI board... they also release a beta-bios... what it seems only limiting the SOC-voltage (which was lower, than Asus' anyway) and not introducing addition beta Agesa etc... and most important no special warranty disclaimers using this beta. I even have another issue with on my X670E Carbon, with the PCIe_3 port... AND even last week got fast response from MSI-support and very good help in their forum. The issue is know, fix is already available. Will be included in next Bios-Update (not the SOC-beta... guess their aim was clearly: "focus on fixing the one important issue and keep everything else as stable as possible").
Still want to buy Ally over Steam Deck, be careful, looks over function
Dude i once bought an asus tablet, was a complete piece of sh1et , bought a laptop the keyboard broke die ASUS
Over the last 6 years i've owned an asus gpu, mainboard and 2 monitors and guess what? I've been having issues with all of them. Glad to see a reaction from a big review channel on this
We have to remember that Corporations change over time. People quit or get fired, new blood comes in. Just like your own life changes every year, a Companies Profile changes every year too. Sadly, not for the better for ASUS, but that is THEIR problem.
Ouch! Sort of unrelated I know but there is no way I'll be buying the ROG Ally now. I'll leave it for some time or just get the steam deck I think. Thanks for posting all  this.👍
ASUS is just SUS now
Maybe its a good thing i decided to save some money and go for a Gigabyte board (even though their software is awful). Also, thank you Jay. You are going to make Asus hurt for what they are doing in the right way and if they are smart enough, they might fix their mistakes.
so after they send you 2 faulty motherboards you make this decision lol nvidia blame the consumer for their 12v cables but you didnt fired nvidia from your channel jaaayyyyy....
Nice move!
Good now that I don't have to feel bad by missing on ROG Ally :D
so what brand can we trust lol
This is why I have 100% trust in your content and Steve's. I love this channel. Thank you you for staying true to what you believe.
Built a skylake desktop setup with a 6700k back in 2016 on asus’s progaming line of motherboards. Rock solid till this day. Bought a ROG phone 5 on a snapdragon 888 and it died 1 month after its first year (had Wi-Fi disconnecting issues which more or less required an entire motherboard swap). The entire ASUS official support forum for the ROG 5 model was full of people with their WiFi disconnecting problems which were exactly the same as mine (frequent disconnects, cannot turn Wi-Fi back on) . Called ASUS reps and informed them butttt… they would not do anything because I was already out of the warranty period. And despite having an entire forum filled with the same disconnecting Wi-Fi issue they refused to acknowledge it was a known issue. Never again another ASUS purchase.
the ROG tax isn't worth crap anymore...
I've also had audio issues with an ASUS X670E-E Strix motherboard (7900x CPU) using an Astro A40 headset with a mixamp using the optical and USB have to go to the windows taskbar and change the audio device selected to get audio back it's weird I've also always felt that the chipset itself runs pretty hot if I have my GPU fans set to not come on until the GPU core is at above 45C the chipset wil sit at around 60-70C while at idle and light web browsing I've also had RGB issues where the RGB I have set to the motherboard RAM and an RGB gpu sag bracket the top left of the 2 RAM sticks (G.Skill DDR5 32GB CL 30-38-38-96 Model F5-6000J3038F16GX2-TZNR) has a yellow section even though it's set to change colors to purple and green only the top left will just be a solid yellow unless I power it off and back on and sometimes it will still be stuck on yellow until the most recent updates and the RGB will randomly just freeze all together
ASUS Cards now suck too tho, just listen at the coil whine an they're overpriced af. Palit/Gainward/PNY are way better choices.  I used ASRock boards in my 4 PCs for 5 years now without problems, but I also only went for the ASUS HERO in my new build because all current AM5 ASRock Mainboards look like shit...
5600x was my first AMD CPU. Between memory, CPU, and motherboard I've had so many issues and RMAs across different products that next time I upgrade I'll be going back to Intel unfortunately.
Well...Asus said it on their boards..."For Those Who Dare "....sad!
im so glad evga still makes mobos. my ch7 is getting the boot and my evga ftw card is getting a brother❤
It's sad to see it come to this. ASUS has been my goto brand for a decade and a half. But I'd be lying if I said my experiences in the last couple of years has been problem free, but I brushed it off as just bad luck.
No more asus laptops for me :)
I been thinking my issues maybe were not my motherboard but couldn't figure out what else it could be. Now maybe it is now that I know I have an ASUS but can't fix tha issue sadly.
Something really bad needs to happen for ASUS to even consider changing things for the better. Like a huge Lawsuit all over the media of some celeb burning down theire Mansion with theire kids in it or a Gaming PC set the White House on Fire and now its Black? I bet that would do the trick! A single Tech Review Channel on Youtube sure wont be enough no matter how big it is, but thx for the effort anyway Jay.
❤
And i shall now be removing the "asus prime b550 plus" mobo from the list of  parts for my next build! ty for info
Man, I used to love asus…
Whew... my PC.. no Asus parts.. 😅
Mad respect Jay, i have a lot of those same issues with my system as you do with yours, never once did i think is was my ASUS motherboard being jank...smh. Should I change my motherboard?
So what to do now? I’ve a Tuf x670e plus Wi-Fi and Ryzen 7800x3d combo. Been warned about immediate BIOS update just this week but after some research I decided to wait.
I can literally hear champagne popping at MSI HQ
What a shame, as always had good experience with Asus products, but that isn't with modern stuff (last new board was a P6TD Deluxe and thats still running nice with a xeon chip).  As for AMD my 5600G has bee solid, and that's in an HP system. (prebuild yuck I know) .
Thanks man for sticking up for consumers. Huge respect.
This kind of BS happened to me (in a laptop, ASUS TUF FX504GE btw) no issue no problems nothing not even overheating....just straight DEAD they somehow managed to fuk up a dang LAPTOP and it was YEARS ago
I currently have an asus motherboard in my planned build, but seeing this I want to change it, what are other good brands to go with
I think you should still have ASUS boards as part of your reviews. You have to disable EXPO then put them up against the better boards with them on. It's fair in ASUS' opinion, so right from the horse's (Pegasus) mouth.🤷‍♂
Hello Jay My pride and joy has a ROGx299 motherboard with an ASUS RTX2060OC GPU do I have to be worried what do I need  to be?
gotta say, and DAMN im grateful, my Strix X570-E that i have for 2 years now kinda holds itself? Bios is probably 24-18 months old and it just works.. oh man im so grateful i dont have to deal with this shit
It's been over a week since last beta bios for my b650 asus board that made my expo profile unstable to post properly and have to stay with the regular ram speed. If by june this isn't fixed, I'll have to buy another board.  I have been using asus boards for 20 years and the few times I tried other brands they reminded why asus was my first choice. Well, not anymore.
I just built a new rig last month (before this broke) with a B660m-Plus Wifi D4, no problems so far and ordered another one to replace a failed Gigabyte B760i but will probably avoid Asus in future.
I will have to abandon mITX because of this for microATX... others just don't deliver on mITX in terms of design, or not deliver at all to Europe. Limited reach of Gigabyte saddens me in particular.
Thank god I bought an MSI
This is why we love you guys, respect, always
And then there is their horrible armoury crate software. I can install it, it runs one time, when I close it never opens again and the only way to change settings is re-installing it.
Sad to see them fall from grace. Oh well. ROG is super cringe anyways.
Now I'm even happier i went with MSI lol.
That’s a shame. As iv always recommended asus gear.
I've used asus for all my builds sinse ibm 5x85 150, But i felt it on my Am4 board asus was going in the wrong direction, And now this. Yeah im looking to upgrade now. and i'm be doing this so long, But with all the shit company's are doing right now. My next pc will be the hardest to build. Because i simply don't know anymore, Can i trust asus, Hell no. that would be a difrent motherboard fender. Do i like how Nvidia and Amd are doing videocards right now. No but i don't want an intel video card. I kinda want the cuda core's but with all the bs of Nvidia's mob behaviour fuck off. I REALLY DON"T LIKE HOW THE COMPUTER INDUSTRIE is right now. With to mutch power sucking sucky products that blow up in your face and start fucking fire's  after you have spend 2k on only a fucking videocard Or you both a motherboard of 600 fucking euro's
Huge respect. To be honest not had any trouble with my z690 hero!
But I thought msi was boycotted for being caught scalping their own products... You even did a video about it from memory.
get wrecked
the whole industry and all others, is ownd by the same company, blackrock n vanguard. basically majority shareholder of everything of this earth. and behind them a very few families buy politicians and making money, laws, everything just to gain their deluded needs. and all these honest, nice youtubers, if even dare touch anywhere near the truth, never ever do anything than looking at the needle and thread when ur sitting there with an open wound.
Good shit man!! Question what are you going to do with all your stocked product now?
I stopped building with ASUS 3 years ago. Every ASUS product i used failed me when i got returns. Cost be almost 1k as a small builder. Friends and family's with close people to them. I got 5 bricked Asus boards and one that got dropped and was a Asrock.
I had an RMA that ASUS INSISTED I do for a problem that did NOT exist. (it was a software issue, and they insisted it was a bad audio chip).  So, the RMA of my ASUS X570 Crosshair Hero motherboard goes as follows. I box up my motherboard, take photos for my own safety, and send the motherboard to ASUS. A few days go by, and I get a email from ASUS telling me that my motherboard has water damage, and that my warranty is void, and I owe them 420 dollars for repairs out of warranty.  Me being me... I flatly tell them that not only do I photo evidence of my board, but the images they sent me are NOT my board, and I will be suing the living crap out of them if they do not honor my valid warranty. The very next email I get is essentially "your warranty is being processed. your new motherboard should be in the mail very soon".  Worst motherboard warranty I have ever done. And, honestly, it has made me afraid of warrantying my ASUS Crosshair Extreme X570 board for its lighting issue (2 RGB lights are stuck red, even with RGB turned off entirely).
Switch to Apple  It just works.🤣😂
wow this video probably cost asus millions in lost sales. Mine included.
Back in the 00’s, when it was time for me to build a new PC, i chose as many ASUS parts as I could get. Around the same year I got a 17” ASUS laptop, F17 I think it was. Rock-solid parts, and they never failed me. Come 2020 I saw someone selling an almost new A15 and bought it. Quality had gone down somewhat, and cooling was not good on that. 2 months ago I decided to buy the 2022 A15… wooow, that machine is so unstable… I don’t know where ASUS went wrong… they were doing so well… Maybe when they went low-quality with ASRock…
Diversity hirelings go woke, go broke...
My last time when I gave chance to asus and AMD was at the Athlon 64 3000+ times so a FEW years back. It was all good but that time performance gains were huge with every generation and since then I used Intel for many years with MSI boards with totally zero problems.   2 weeks ago I changed my 9600k on MSI z390 gaming plus to 7950x3d with X670E-E Gaming wifi. Now i feel just robbed. For about 2 weeks my CPU was running around 1.4 VSOC. I wish I knew this voltage is too high... I'm a PC enthusiast since 25 years, I do build my PC's on my own and I do know a lot about hardware yet I wasn't researching every freakin voltage on my motherboard and the propers level of it. I had this on auto and I was sure it is running proper value. With G.Skill 6000 30-38-38 set it was running on VSOC around 1.4. I wasn't using this CPU heavily but I ran some stability tests...   Now I'm running latest non beta BIOS with VSOC set to 1.15 and it's stable (and yes, 1.15 in BIOS means 1.21 in reality) but I'm afraid my CPU is permamently damaged and I'm left on my own. I feel robbed from my hard earned money... There is no support, turning the PC on and damaging itself is my fault. It should be illegal and I think it will be but mostly in US, and I'm from Europe. What a bullshit...  They should change their branding to "For those who daren't"
You are the man, Jay!
I fired ASUS over a decade ago.  Their MOBO's always have issues.  Last 4 builds all have MSI MOBO's.
I've only bought an Asus product once - my TUF GTX 1650 Super. It has consistently had frame rates 25% less than other GTX1650 Supers and I can get no boost out of it in Afterburner either, regardless of voltage settings. Asus is, in my opinion, very overpriced, particularly their ROG range. MSI, as much as their past activity is questionable, at least their parts usually work, which, ultimately, is what gamers and users in general worry about.   My upgraded build will have an MSI MAG B550M Bazooka, a MSI RX5700XT Evoke (Used) and a Seasonic GM850 PSU, no Asus parts.
no shit brands. GIGACHAD
@JaysTwoCents Thank you for this video. You  and Steve have convinced me to EAT THE MONEY I spend on my ROG Gaming x670e and Get a MSI x670e Carbon or the AORUS Master instead
Lol been Using ASRock for a few years now. No complaints, not 'brand loyal', just a decent product for my use
Oh man... i waited until the 7800x3d came out to build my new rig.  When it came to the question which mobo i should go for i looked at as much information as i could (at that time the blowing up CPU problem wasn't known yet). I got disappointed quite fast the more i looked into the AM5 boards. They were significantly more expensive with WAY less features to boot. All of them. So i invested more time and settled on this one:  TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI with: 7800x3d ASUS TUF 3090 32 Gigs of DDR5 5600 28CL (seemed to be the sweetspot with fewer problems on boards) 1TB M.2 (OS) 2TB M.2 2TB SSD (from my old rig) 850 Watt PSU from seasonic (the new vertex one) Arctic Freezer II 360 Lian Li Lancool 216 RGB (non-RGB wasn't avaiable in my country, i'm not a fan of the bling bling)  First up: No fking jokes, i had to restart my pc around 50 times until i got lucky to get into the BIOS. So far so good. Flashed the BIOS to the newest versions with official X3D support (Had to try that 4 times too btw).  Then it wouldn't like Expo until it restarted on its own for like 10 times.  After all of that i "tried" installing Win10. Only had to do it 2 times but it was still annoying af.  Within the first week i had completely random semi freezes of my system while just browsing or idling. If i noticed it happening it was mostly while watching a video. It would start loading as if my internet connection was gone. Then the taskbar would lock up but i could still switch tabs in the browser or steam i.e. After that i wouldn't even be able to get into the taskmanager (so i was never able to see what was causing it) but i would still be able to move the mouse cursor... so semi freezes. No CPU fan ramping up while this was happening or excessive amounts of heat coming out of my rig, it was just locking up as if i had a bad virus on my pc.  Mutliple BIOS updates later and i find myself on the BIOS version 1413 (no Beta version but with the SOC update). System runs pretty stable now or as stable as one would expect. Booting up the system takes like 15-20 minutes. No BSOD since that BIOS version and the voltage for my CPU seems to be locked at 1.25 but i don't have actual measurement tools to confirm the validity of that.  What i do have: The CPU seems to still randomly go into kind of heat mode. I know that 50-60 C aren't bad for the CPU but when it happens while there is no load you start to get itchy in all the wrong places. Gaming is actually quite fine so far but the CPU is getting random heat spikes there too. Since power got expensive here in germany (it starts to normalize to earthly prices now) i locked everything to 60 FPS, sucks when you have 144Hz 27 1440p monitor... two of them but right now that is the best way for my wallet. So as you could guess my PC is bored pretty much always but the CPU still gets weird spikes for no good reason.  So if it helps at all for anybody that also got an ASUS board or the same as mine. The 1413 BIOS version seems to "work" so far without killing the CPU through voltage. Weird behaviour is still there. Asking those moon prices for shit boards is one of the most scummiest things i had the displeasure of experiencing. If your GPU is bad, you RMA that bitch or buy a new one. If your RAM is shit, you RMA it or buy a new one. IF YOUR CPU IS SHIT, it sucks balls but you RMA it or buy a new one.  Now if your Mobo is shit you potentially have to buy a completely new system since everything gets fucked from heaven to hell because the mobo handles EVERYTHING. Fucking fucks.
*“ASUS YOU DONE FUCKED IT UP!”*
Yeah, was a fanboy, now it seems like I am not going to use Asus on my next build. I am planning on a new build next month or so. I think want to go with msi or gigabyte...
Great move there Jay!!! Integrity over profit is a rare sight these days. Gotta say though it seems to me that most of the problems with asus mobos are on the AMD side of things. I'm runnning intel and had to change my MSI z690 board for a miriad of issues, including system freezing at boot if the GPU was in the top pcie slot(????), inconsistent usb connection and slow trasfer rate to my nvme ssd. Replaced it with an ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-F GAMING WIFI and it's been smooth sailing for the last 4 months. So maybe it's a bad compatibility issue with ryzen 7000? That doesn't change the fact that the way they are handling the support side of this is absolutely obscene. They seem to go out of their way to be as slimy as they can.
This! This is the reason why Jay is one of THE best, and most trustworthy tech creators on YT, or any platform really 👍
Dude my am5 Asus mainboard was like $ 400 I bought the lower end AM5 Cpu to upgrade to X3D later and now Asus is the new Gigabyte my god cant I have a break just one time
Good Call Jay!
All PC parts are trash relating to software. But this problems what you're talking about is typically AMD.
I quit wasting my money and time with Asus after their X99 Rampage killing chips bullshit. Switched to MSI and never looked back since. Oh yeah and massive respect for choosing integrity over sponsorship.
I was just about to rebuild with ASUS. Guess not now...
Even Asus laptops are extremely unreliable, most of theme have severe keyboard issues. Malfunctioning HDD/SSDs from the beginning. It's a mess
I bought a x670e board from Asus for my 7950x3d. I did at least not use expo, but my pc takes almost a minute to boot every time and I still worry that their trash firmware has damaged by cpu already (as said, they just removed the bios THEY RECOMMENDED TO INSTALL FOR THE NEW X3D CPUs). Yesterday I also started to have issues with my wireless keyboard. I started to work again when I put the dongle into a front usb 2... I am just annoyed right now. My mainboard is like 2x the price of the "high end" mainboard of my last system (the new one is even an mini ITX board while the last was a big X99 ATX board) which even boots faster than my new system. The old mobo was also from Asus and it killed 2x 6850k in 6 years XD
damn asus started to act like every other brand on the market >:(
Thank you for the validation. I bought a B650E-F with a 7700x back in January and the BIOS is barely functional at best. My 6000mhz DDR5 crashes my system if it runs at anything above 4800. I've had so many little problems since the beginning and chalked it up to typical new tech growing pains but now it feels more nefarious.
Bought an ROG strix B550 which after 60 days was malfunctioning . They refused to repair it under warranty because it didn't have a bios button .shame on you ASUS
Got an ASUS RX580 8GB OC and it completely shuts down every single time it hits those OC clocks so the only way to use it is to run it at stock AMD clocks. I thought maybe I was just unlucky but it turns out this is a common problem on that particular ASUS card and its not AMD's fault but ASUS for applying an unstable overclock on their product just so it looks better on paper.
Yes I've had a 7900X on a Asus X670 Hero since November and its been the most unstable build I've had in a long while. Asus has always been my go to but I will be definitely will be looking at alternatives next time.
now does this also count towards the older motherboards they made? i currently have a ROG STRIX B550-F Gaming, i have experienced a decent amount of problems should i swithc my MB?
Personally I'm glad that ASUS are being called out now.  I can only speak from personal experience (and everybody's mileage may vary) but I've only ever had problems with ASUS boards.  Every build I've done for friends / family / customers using an ASUS board has had problems.  I now avoid them completely, preferring MSI these days.  Like I say, this is from my own personal experience.
And I just bought a new ASUS laptop a month ago, luckly it works perfect, but I wish I had this video then :P
My computer randomly stopped working 3 years ago, and I bought an ASUS B550-A Prime board. Only to find out that it's the weakest board out of that generation. For the amount of money I could've bought an MSI board. Or anything else. This motherboard can't handle the 105w CPU's because the VRM's that ASUS marketing says are 'cooled' on this board, actually aren't, and the phases don't even work the same way it says on the box, leading to massive heat issues. I'm never buying another ASUS product.
Bro I had no idea you had a twitch channel. wtf bro just add the link in the description!
Ive been saying ASUS was basically criminals for years. Bought a ASUS Rog PG27UQ monitor for £1500 years ago. I got a panel issue after 12 months  and had to go trough there RMA system. You can’t contact them by phone, it’s only via email. I found out that your device goes to a third party company to Fix.   I looked up some reviews of this third party company and you had multiple reviews of saying “I’ve opened up my device and they fixed the issue I had but also stripped the entire thing of all the ASUS parts and replaced it with cheap third party replacements, this thing won’t last a year.   After telling them this ASUS staff member basically said it’s company policy to send it to this company and your monitor will be with a refurbished product. So you have know what of knowing what the replacement you get originally went in for, it could have had 7 faults replaced with cheap components that will break inside of a year and be worse than the one you sent off.   Bare in mind, this was a £1500 monitor I bought new. That developed a fault after 13 months and through all my research the likelihood of me getting a worse product back was very high.
For a long time I thought ASUS was THE brand for pc components. But I am not convinced anymore and all of the trust is gone. I will buy other brands in the future. Thanks Stev… äh Jay!
I use h110 asarock for so long have nothing wrong with it
I gave up on Asus years ago when I had a debacle with their support about warranty and RMA issues - never looked back. You can usually tell a companys' worth right out of the gate based on how they treat the customers (even when they don't act as smart).  When you're spending this kind of money, there should not be this kind of allowance for error.
hello @JayzTwoCents current my GPU has been down..can you recommend GPU that would be good for my ryzen 5 3600x +msi x570 gaming plus. Thank you..hoping for your response
I've been a fan of ASUS motherboards for the last 30 years after some bad experiences with 2 other brands. I don't mind spending a bit more money to get an ASUS board. I'm so sorry this has happened and their quality control has gone down the pan. I have recently built a new home gaming PC with an ASUS B550 board and a Ryzen X5800x3d. So far it seems to work fine but I'm sad to hear that there are big problems with the 3d Ryzen chips. I hope they listen to you.
i think the only one throwing themselves off a cliff is JAY 🤣🤣 You cant help change anything from the sidelines.
First it was only evident in the bloatware that they offer as Armory Crate, now that type of "quality" has reflected all over the company.
Dropped Asus last year,  went back to trusted and true MSI
Can I have those mobos?
Anyone have experience with how to return a motherboard bought from amazon after the return period is expired? I have the Asus rog strix B650e-e and I'm having all of the same issues as Jay. How do I prove it is faulty with seeming very random issues with sound and keyboard disconnecting etc. The only consistency is that Expo never works. @JayzTwoCents
I got a 7700X and an Asus 650E-F two months ago. Everything runs solid. But there are some really weird things going on. Even tho USB Power delivery when the PC is shut down is turned off in the BIOS, it randomly decides to still deliver power. 🤷 Or on every third boot into the OS, the RAM and the motherboard refuse to sync and the RGB on the RAM goes haywire. Only a reboot can fix it. Lets hope as time goes by, they release better BIOSes and software to smoothen things out.
I saw Jay kick a puppy once.
yeah my tuf 3090 is amazing, it's too bad that Asus show their greed and I am happy that Jay stands behind this and is like Enough is enough. They gotta become Humble.
im glad i didn't bought asus motherboard
Weird all this. Have a Asus B550 F Gaming and a Asus M5A97 EVO R2.0 for years and no issues. Both paired with Asus Strix RX 5700 XT and Strix RX 580 and no issues t'll today. Hardware vs OS vs drivers?......
Even their past gaming phones have SOC issue. overheating and just shutting down when under load.
When you 2 diss on a company, you know they are f'd. Thank you
Their fw for their rog wifi routers is shit also, having to go back to tp-link, can never find an older version of bios where all the functions just work and not crash.
What board would you recommend?
Asrock is owned by Asus? so isn't it weird they do better boards ?
Can't up vote this enough. Asus has been such a shit show and their tech support is so useless. Good riddance!
ASRock still has issues with their BIOS releases, meaning those take long and are quite sparse, but on the hardware side of things they are excellent. ASUS however ... well the first time I noticed something wrong is when the ASUS PRIME B350-PLUS and X370-A ended up being my only Ryzen boards with stability issues - and I built around 16 systems thus far using said ASUS boards, ASRock ( such as AB350 and even a DeskMeet X300 ), Gigabyte and Biostar motherboards ( I really love the "Biostar B550 MX/E Pro" ).  I specialize not on high-end, but mid-range cost effective builds, and those were all silent, as fast as they should be on paper and most notably stable - except for the ASUS.
thank you Jay i have been a Asus fanboi for years time to rethink my next build :0
14:06 Eh, no? People that knew their shit knew that ASRock always made some of the most reliable and solid motherboards. It's only ignorant people like you, that got blinded by Asus's branding, design & marketing, that would buy an Asus board over an ASrock Board. No way in hell i would've ever bought an Asus Board over an ASrock Board.
I haven't been buying ASUS stuff for many years. Their motherboards have been giving me issues. Asrock and MSI boards is what i go with these days.
Courage is rare. I see it in this video.
I'm currently using the ASUS X670E-F, with BIOS 1101 (got that one before they removed it from their site).  With the 7900X3D, and 32GB of 6000Mhz G.SKill Memory.  I only experienced - so far - the following issue: Long boot times whenever I'm _not_ using Optimized Defaults in the BIOS. (I.E., from testing, when I'm on Optimized Defaults, everything works well and the system boots very quickly, so fast - in fact - that I often don't even have the time to press the DEL key quickly enough to even get into the BIOS by the time I already see the Windows screen). However, I haven't had any 'major' problems with it, yet.  Regarding the SoC Voltage situation, without touching any Voltage settings at all, my SoC was detected as being set to 1.394v.  I did read about it about a week ago (this whole thing is relatively new to me but I'm aware of it now). I was surprised, because - then it means - it was defaulted to 1.394v ever since I got the board with my 7900X3D; but somehow and maybe luckily enough nothing blew up and everything is stable (so far anyway).  BUT...  For security reasons, just in case, I apprehensively decided to Manually adjust the SoC Voltage and set it to 1.250v in the BIOS. However, even then it is detected (in the BIOS) as actually being 1.314v, which is weird. But it is lower. And so far, everything remains stable. I might try to keep reducing it a bit until it is detected to be around the 1.200v range, instead. Since I'm pretty sure that it would be enough to run my EXPO2 without any further adjustments.  Basically... I'm crossing fingers because I wouldn't be able to immediately re-afford the purchase the nearly the same components twice. If it DOES 'break', I would first simply move back to my trusty AM4 system I still have (ironically enough, the previous board is still ASUS anyways) with my regular 5800X (non-3D) which ran perfectly fine in terms of stability (and has remained rock solid stable for the 3 or so years I've used it). And if I do have to re-consider another brand then I'm not sure which one I would go with. Maybe Gigabyte or ASRock? I'm not really sure since I've basically always used ASUS boards for the past 15+ years (with the sole exception of one single board from Gigabyte back during the DDR2 years).  I hope that my current system keeps stable and doesn't overheat. And since it's all stable I think I'll just stick with my 1101 BIOS, too.
My random weird issue with my Asus + X3D build is that it no longer recognises my Bluetooth for some reason.  Hopefully it's not something that's broken permanently...
I had to RMA TWO ASUS ROG Maximus XIII Hero boards. The 1st one was a new board but was having a power cycle problem and would never post. Swapped out all other components, still power cycled. Put original components in a "used - acceptable" board from Amazon Warehouse and it posted on 1st power-up. RMA'd it and received a VERY USED board that was scratched, physical issues, and was missing the chipset heatsink. RMA'd that board and received another VERY USED board that had a screw wedged in the VRM headsink, scratches all over, thermal pads chewed up, and the board was bent. Brand new board that was defective and 2 jacked up RMA boards later, I went another route to get a brand new condition board that wasn't defective. I won't be buying any PC components for a while (years), but I'll probably shift to MSI for future builds.
The irony of course is that, as I understand it, Asrock used to be owned by ASUS, but then they broke fully away. Also, many Asrock mbds have actually always been very good, eg. way back, the P55 Deluxe was excellent, and people forget now but the Asrock X58 Extreme6 was very widely used for S1366 CPU/GPU reviews. I've also had only good experiences with two X470 Taichis (both with 2700X), two B450M Pro4s (2600X and 5600X) and an X570 Pro4 with a 5700X.  ASUS was definitely top notch long ago. I have loads of Maximus IV Extreme/Z, Rampage IV Extreme, P9X79/E WS and the venerable Striker II Extreme (among others), so seeing them slide in this way is sad.  And indeed, for most newer builds I've opted for MSI, namely  a B450 Tomahawk Max II + 5600X for a gaming platform upgrade, several more for benchmarking. It's as if the whole market rep spectrum has flipped round; MSI didn't used to be that good, but they've climbed to the top aswell (sans the occasional blip as HU has covered).  Is it yet another case of somehow PR/marketing in these companies telling engineering what to do? If so then that's completely insane.
love my ASROCK!!!!!!! b550m steel legend am4 for 120 bucks...  rock solid,    2xM.2,    2.5GBLan,     M.2 WLan option,    6 SATA ports,     decent ARGB,      2 ARGB Headers,      2x Front USB3 headers,       4xchasis FAN headers.............. what do you want more for 120 bucks ?
hmmm maybe I try MSI again next time I update. But I still like the Asus ProArt monitors, not quiet anything like them at the price point
Don't break the third wall cause your hot neighbor is taking a shower, u pervert!!
I agree on ASUS.  They were my go to brand for all but watching laptop repair channels I see a lot of ASUS laptops with bad components that get replaced.  My Strix Z590 motherboard seems to be running ok but now I see all these problems online.   I need a new laptop but ASUS is not on my list to consider in 2023.  This is how a company destroys itself.
Oh well, I bought recently their Asus Mesh solution. Hopefully it's much different part of company and as it's totally different device.  Anyway, hearing Asrock isn't bad is quite interesting and something didn't hear in a very long time. Would be a good idea for future video.
gad damn it I built all the pcs I built for the last 3 years were with Asus MoBo
To have had to assemble two pc in Asus for 13700K, using the ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-F GAMING, on the two build, I had not possible problems to make it work perfectly.  On the first card, the M2 controller was disabled when installing windows. I spent almost a week to get the motherboard working properly again, spending my time testing techniques that Asus support advised me.  For the second board, same reference because the two pc were made simultaneously, everything works, except that there is a conflict between the pre-installed version of google chrome in Armory Crate and google chrome itself, preventing me to install it. This build is running with firefox.  Frankly, I have always been satisfied with Asus motherboards, but for a few years now, I have been wondering about the reliability of this brand.  For my personal build, I wonder if I will not go to another manufacturer. My problem is that I don't support the Killer network manager present in MSI and AsRock and which is absent in Asus, making me prefer Asus for the moment.
Finally pushed aSUS through the airlock after seeing them vent too many times? Amogus?
Guess no Ally coverage then.
Alrighty! Do Nvidia next!
I've been using Asus mobo's for almost 20 year, and exclusively since DFI stopped making consumer boards. Since the 990FX i've always, always, always seen higher than rated voltages on the CPU and SoC.....but i also know that reporting isn't always accurate which seems like something kinda weird that everyone just accepts. On that 990FX platform, a Crosshair Formula V, i made sure to keep everything running at default values because it was just such a hot chip, but every couple times i powered up the system, it just wouldn't boot. Unplug, watch the lights go out, plug it back in "overclocking failed" go in the bios and see the CPU voltage fluctuating from 1.48-1.52....manually set it to 1.29, restart, still shows 1.35 but it boots! Until it doesn't. Rinse and repeat.   Asus has not ever been "plug and play" for me, everything requires some degree of effort, which requires practical knowledge. It's genuinely been a love/hate relationship with the company, so it's impressive to see someone in your position tell them to go f**k themselves, and i really hope it resonates with them.   But like....i'd still be happy to take a board off your hand. =)
Wow, Thank you very much to say goodbye to a greedy brand like ASUS. I am so happy that I choose MSI AM5 Motherboard (PRO X670-P WiFi). Not the biggest high end one but now stable one after the latest BIOS update version 7D67v192. Before, a lot of the same problems you described happened to me also, not knowing that I took a big risk to fry the motherboard and CPU (7800X3D). Luckily it was you tech-guys that warned us, the customer, instead of the brands itself, which to me, is a big shame. Especially in your case with that white motherboard issue. What an ignorance from ASUS. I am definitely sure ASRock wil knock on your door to replace the sponsorship with ASUS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!
ASUS is the WORST manufacturer for the boards since ever! I always had some strange problems with their boards. Just avoid them and use Gigabyte or MSI, its that simple
This should be ASRocks new slogan.  *-Runs solid ASRock!* 😆
Why don't Asus just get Dylan Mulvaney to be their brand advocate? They seem to want to destroy their company as quickly as possible.
oh fk l just bought an Asus laptop lately ...
I have had this same experience with asus and switch to asrock for my motherboards because i just found them to be more stable
What I really haven't heard clearly, perhaps my fault, in any of the videos on this topic, what do you recommend for those of us who have ASUS motherboards, especially highend motherboards? I doubt many people can afford to just jetison ASUS after spending significant money on a highend motherboard. Personally, I choose to go with the latest, albeit Beta, BIOS as the lesser of evils. My VOC is down below 1.3 according to HWINFO, so I guess that's about all I can do. So far it's been stable and no CPU failures of explosions.
Are older asus products also affected by the problems, like rog strix b550-f?
Just curious. But i am a 3D artist by day, and gamer by night. I am planing on building a PC with a 7950X What motherboard would you recommend to get?  Oh yeah, must be able to handle 128gb Ram or atleast 62gb ram. Not sure you will even read this.
was just about to buy ASUS laptop - no longer!!
I've been building computers for 20 years. Since 14 years old. My first computer used an Asus motherboard and I've always looked for them for every build I've done. This last build I did I was shocked to see how expensive motherboards have gotten but I decided to yolo it anyway and got the 670E Hero. What a waste of $700.
Thanks, Jay! Been an Asus dude for decades. But glad to hear this before my next new build. Still have great running systems on Asus. But they are not any of the boards you're talking about.  Please do a show in the future on the top motherboards your high on. I will be building a new Video production system soon. I am a solid Intel processor guy. So give details based on the processors too. Mahalo from Cam in Maui, Hawaii.
I'm so glad youtube tech influencers are finally realizing how bad Asus is. Way back when I built my first pc I went with an Asus motherboard, it worked for a few weeks fine but then it suddenly stopped working. It was past retail return policy so I had to contact Asus. The worst experience ever. I was told to update the BIOS so I did but that did nothing. Asus closed my ticket and stated my problem was resolved. That's it. I had to buy another motherboard. My 2nd asus purchase had bent pins. I was told I was SOL. I swore off Asus since. And I've been problem free since then.
Great to see this Jay, i'm also done with Asus, had a few Asus "high end" stuff with issiuse and bad support
BIG respect from Sweden, to how you take a stand against these dragons.
taiwanese: WE WANT FREEDOM OF SPEEEECHHHH!!!!!!! FREEEEDOM!!!! taiwanese in reality: ayo shhhhhhh be quiet shhhhhhhhhhhh dont spread anything out eh
A little bit of a drama queen having a meltdown over a motherboard
so is this only about their newest boards or is there still this level of issues with there b550's?
I had an Asus board on my previous build, and as a happy customer was planning to go again with them for my new build, but so glad I went with Gigabyte.  Reason was that I saw so much more value for my money buying a Giga board, and I don't regret it.
i stopped using Asus in 2008.. After it became a marketing brand. Gigabyte all the way !
Bad customer service is standard Chinese, and by extension Taiwanese, culture. 4000 years of authoritarian governments and a repressive culture… our idea of customer service is modern and western.  Asus has been great with my one RMA in 15 years of building, but sad to see this crap.  In China, a lot of companies are way worse to consumers. (Not sure about in Taiwan) But big companies like TCL put out expensive crappy TVs and laugh when you ask for exchanges.
ASUS..you are dead to me...
I've only had this issue with the ASUS boards, but there'd always be some sort of power surging issue with their USB's on their AM4 boards, which would mes sup something after awhile: for the latest two of my TUF motherboards, they've fucked up the power usage of my VR headsets. I WANT to love and treasure ASUS, seeing it's not just me now, makes it clear I have to disown them, and that's a fucking shame.
Hear hear, Jay
9:11 HOW THE HECK DOES A COMPANY AS BIG, AS RICH, AS POWERFUL, AS POPULAR, AND AS INFLUENTIAL AS MF  A-S-U-S MANAGE TO SEND AN IMPROPER MOTHERBOARD TO ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS AND BELOVED TECH INFLUENCERS IN THE WHOLE WORLD T-H-R-E-E TIMES IN A ROW?! WHAT?!?!?!  And this is why independent reviewers like Jay, Steve, Linus are needed. As long as those guys don't call out company's on their BS and inform public on what is really going on alot of people lose money
Interestingly steve said if asus had fixed this issue properly he wouldve made a video about the issues hes had with gigabyte and asrock. Does this mean msi is the only board wuthout issues?
Good thing they’re distracting everyone with the new handheld
Fully agree with you Jay, I bought a strix g17 laptop and i am really disappointed. Putting the power cable in front of a heating ventilation opening and if you spin it to other side you are blocking the HDMI, USB c port.... having 90+ C on CPU while not being so much utilized. Fans that sound like the neighbour is using a vacuum cleaner. Fully agree not to buy any Asus products. Than you for sharing this to the end customers and also letting Asus know how this stand. Keep up the great work!
And yesterday i returned my new asus rog strix laptop for a gigabyte aorus....
I cancled the orders for my Asus Mainboard and GPU. Enough is enough.
Respect to Jay and the team, that's all I can say 🙂
Uh oh, dads upset.
This could cause someone's house to burn down.
Way way back MOBOs were barebones but functional, now MOBOs look like they're part of the marketing packaging - they sell any BS they can think of but they don't even know how their product works. I mean I get it, new tech is not easy to implement, but that doesn't mean you should just push the responsibility on the buyer, whether they do or don't upgrade the bios. It's like you buy a product, lets say a car, and it'll only be insured if you don't drive it.
Gigabyte did the same, they fried my Ryzen 9 3900X from their bios update, then a week later, wiped the update from their website. This was over a year ago.
Man this sucks. I am a big Asus fan. What is next best brand beside Asus?
I was considering finally going ASUS for my next build, but this has made me feel lucky I've been with MSI motherboards for over a decade.
Honest information Jay, cheers for this video, i will also be staying away from Asus, entirely. Keep up the good work man, much love 👌👌
No way they ratioed Asus
I never really like Asus, too flashy for my personal taste.. Now after getting some things second hand that didn't work quite right, i got new products from Asus as a test and things worked fine by comparison.. Except some aspects of the products are very much bloatware and some features seems to be very flawed.. Now this is happening while I'm still on a 3700X, so I'm just glad I never made an upgrade, because holy crap my experience could have shifted very fast..
I like Asus they are always a bit more expensive than ASRock and MSI but the quality is good and I expected a good consumer and RMA experience but lately I'm not sure if my upgrade to ryzen 7000 will get an Asus board maybe if they can fix or replace my broken 6800xt
So who is top tier now? Gigabyte?
Your details about the contract shed new lite on the latest Gamers Nexus outrage videos.  Thank you for clarifying.
From this moment forward Asus will be known as A*us. Galling that they dont stand by their product especially at $700. If they dont have faith in their product, neither do I.
well done on puting a video out there regarding your issue. However I think you should make a final video on if AMD had anything to do with these faults and if not say sorry.... Just saying I am pretty sure its Asus and not AMD and you shit talked AMD alot...
I hate to see this but it is somewhat validating.  I purchased a ZenFone 9 and love it; also bought their ROG earbuds.  I lost an earbud.  Their website clearly stated they would replace it if it was within warranty.  I offered to pay half price with their customer service rep.  They told me I had to purchase a whole new unit after speaking with her supervisor.  I'm the kind of customer that doesn't fight very hard over this stuff.  I just take note, and find another brand willing to back their product and support their customers.  Sad, I have been a long time fan of ASUS.  But companies rise and fall just like everything else.  I hope they rise again.
me who just built a pc with asus motherboard and asus gpu: -_-
If this was a car manufacturer, there'd be a product recall, with fixes fitted at the company's expense, with full warranty, no matter how rare the likelihood of a catastrophic failure would be. This is nuts. It's good to see YouTubers putting consumers before money ... again. We've seen it before with Steve, now we have Jay at it. Pretty sure Linus has cut someone's umbilical chord before now as well. I wonder, though, if smaller channels would have the same issues with ASUS as they may not be in a position to reject free products.
Damn, i was just thinking for a few days to sell my am4 pc and go for am5 platform with ddr5,to be specific 7700x, b650 strix,32gb 6000mhz.Then i saw this vid and gamer nexus one, and im not even sure what to do..Kinda thinking about z790 with i5-13600K and keeping it ddr4..
This is the reason your one of my go too tech guys 🤜🤛 no bull stuff.
Wow asus has made billions but treat customers this way , good on you jay f@!k asus !!!
Lol damn. I recently built a new computer. And when choosing a MB I saw Asus. I never trusted them. To me they always looked like a gimmick. All their advertising bells and whistles. Like they were more concerned with how a product looked than how it performed. He’ll give me a olds delta 88 with primer grey paint and tweetie bird stickers in the window over a Skyline GTR. If it performs. A company that would slap a Hello Kitty sticker on a mother board isn’t a company I would trust. So I steered away from Asus at all costs. And I’m happy with what I built.
As far as Asus GPU’s go, I believe they were collaborating with NewEgg and purposely sold defective RMA items that had already been sent for repair then placed in NewEgg’s “Open Box” deals. I’ve still got a bricked GPU that Asus told me I would have to wait for a “Repaired” card, that they wouldn’t give me a new replacement. So I was on the hook for the purchase.
ASUS is a joke now. Several years on and the fan control on two Crosshair VI Hero (X370) systems I have still completely breaks if hardware monitoring utilities try to poke the EC at the wrong time. For some reason it's only fixable if you go into the BIOS and make one of those configuration changes that causes the board to turn off and then back on when you save settings and exit--I think they're doing something weird like saving the configuration and state for the EC that controls the fans next to the microcode configuration data that gets updated when you swap CPUs. Not even clearing CMOS fixes it; it HAS to be a change to one of the options that makes the board power off and back on. Pretty sure my STRIX X570-E does the same thing, but I just stopped letting utilities talk to the controller because the issue it causes is such a pain in the ass. I think these will be my last ASUS boards. I miss ABIT and DFI, or even Gigabyte 15 years ago. One time I RMA'd a board with a blown trace to Gigabyte, but after voiding my warranty someone repaired the board by hand before sending it back because they thought it would be fun! Fond memories of a world that no longer exists.
I don't think it's all that bad. Give it some break. The issue with burning Ryzens is on all AM5 mobo makers not just ASUS. I'm with a GIGABYTE X670E AORUS MASTER and a 7950X3D. And have been updating the UEFI as soon as a new one comes out. But i've not touched anything in the BIOS and have been using the Defaults with only the Preffered Cores set to Cache. Even my RAM is at 4800MHz CL40 defaults. And it's all because i'm willing to wait this problem out till it goes completely away with new BIOSes. So i think it's all of the mobo makers fault for not following AMD's orders on how a BIOS should work. Stop bashing ASUS. They were the first ones to act on the issue matter.
darn!...if this is not hard core dedication to the viewers, I don't know what is!.... kudos to jayz and the whole team!
Great stuff Jay!  Respect for putting this video out !  Asus is my favo brand over the years but they have dropped the ball big time. And I'm not even speaking about their ridiculous pricing!
Only ASUS components I've ever purchased are their Monitors (of which I have 3).  I think my next monitors are going to be ViewSonic.
I trust Asrock and Gigabyte. Those are the only 2 brands I trust. I had a gigabyte motherboard for my i3 3220 back in the day for 7 years before dying. Asrock the exact same. They are good and reliable, I love their bios and bios update and the UI looks clean. Support is great on both Gigabyte and Asrock. By the way I have a Asrock B450M Steel Legend im still using with my Ryzen 5 and it never caused any problems.
I still don't know what happened to Gigabyte and Jay
Ok, but if i have asus now, what can i do? Turn Expo off, wsiting for bios stability?
Can i have the asus stuff?
you owe it to us to do a amd build, none asus to let us all know if amd has at least part blame. i mean you  said your here for us. but if your going intel and not bothering to long test amd in a different build , then you are failing us.  so im asking you to do a  amd build for us so we know if we should hold off builds etc etc etc
Thankyou jay. I am currently getting products for my next build. Asus are now off the list
100% respect to you J - ASUS need a reality check FAST!
Asus is one more creator leaving away from posting about cancel culture ruining their brand :D
dont forget their terrible software "Armory Crate" holy.....
I have a 7950X and my system has been solid, of course, I'm not using an ASUS board so...
Chinese sabotage
Asus = Big no no. All Asus branded things since 2012 (including modem, monitor, motherboard, graphics card, laptop) have died prematurely. Asus is one of the brands which i would never use ever again.
With many of these brands apparently making so many mistakes, as a novice in pc-building, what are some of the brands that still seem good/reliable?
most coms from windows 11
You know what jay? I should play f*** lottery. I was so close in march when i done the am5 build to get a strix mb the only reason i did not is that i got a combo deal so good that the cpu and mb was the same price as the strix. Oh boy i am glad now i was a cheapskate!  Btw jay that was my conclusion about asus till before this mess that are doing very good hardware but support not so much on software side but till recently was still in the decent teritory... but... they handle this one... i am surprised if amd does not take action against as is very detrimental for them.
2 years ago mine blew up i will just move on also thanks for posting this truth. you earned a lot of trust from me.
this really sums up my experience with asus for 15 years, nothing ive ever had has worked and they dont care, they've never stood by a product as for asrock, they were really bad....when they were owned by asus, its a really complacent brand, i was going to get an rog board for my latest upgrade but i just couldn't do it, i went with aorus, even during the gigabyte issues i trust it so much more than a company thats has a dozen failures on me and just laughs at it
So what we doing now pulling out our asus equipment and burning it all yea 😂😅
isnt msi every bit as shitty a company? gnexus had beef with them a year or so ago didnt they?
Asus, AMD, company’s high on their own farts. I’m off to intel and MSI for my next build.
Doesn’t make sense to just not have asus products going forward.  Seems like an over reaction to me.  Yes this problem isn’t good, but other motherboard vendors have problems too.  Idk, I have never had problems with any of my asus boards.  I love my Maximus z790 hero board
Since 2008 Asus was no.1for me, still have laptop that's that's been working normaly over 100 celsius gpu temp and few other pc parts.. All changed since around 300 and onward motherboard series with all the ram problems I've experienced. So yeah, even cheap asrock crap with lower performance is better.
And here I thought I was doing something wrong when I had 2 motherboards fail when I tried to build my new PC
You know ASUS is a Taiwanese brand, right? So maybe you should listen to Taiwanese people like me. Almost all Taiwanese who build their own PCs have traditionally avoided Asus components. Only the too rich or too brainless or the Chinese (not Taiwanese) build their PCs from ASUS parts. There are too many jokes about the quality of accessories on Ausu. 1. 七進七出(the original meaning is that the warrior can enter and exit the enemy base 7 times) On the Asus way, which means whoever buys Asus parts is brave, you're going to need to be in and out of 7 RMAs. 2. 華碩品質，堅若磐石(It is the slogan of ASUS in Taiwan, and the original meaning is that the quality of ASUS products is as solid as a rock.) But if you ask some Taiwanese, they will say 華碩品質，以卵擊石(meaning ASUS product quality is like you throw an egg at a stone). If you google through mandarin you can find more joke about their poor quality and shity service.
I needed a laptop for school and bought a brand new ZenBook in 2019.  Since the start it randomly shut down and rebooted and I couldn't figure out why. Sent it in for repair to an Asus facility in Poland 3 times. They didn't do anything to it except doing a Windows reinstall. So I was stuck with a 1000€ laptop which was crashing during my presentations and seminars. Asus didn't give a f***.
Big respect!  I've watched your content since I started building in 1st lockdown. Glad to see you'll put your consumers ahead of a sponsorship. As a side note I've ran MSI unify boards from z490 up to z690 and had absolutely no problems!
Perfect timing for their Ally launch.
thats sad, the last 3 PC builds ive done all had ROG mobos, i liked the boards and i was looking to build a new PC at the end of this year. I guess ill be lookin for a new brand.
Its all my fault. I decided since ASUS is regarded as one of best brands i would give them a go for my AM5 platform. Ive had two RMA's with them and now they have decided i cant fix a problem they created without voiding my warranty.
Fucking right Jay. This is what integrity looks like, try it out ASUS. I also took this board out due to it acting odd with memory and got an X670E TaiChi Carrara. SO happy with this new ASRock board.
They need to be black listed by techtubers.
i have had damaged rma from ASUS and Gigabyte that have been worse than the faults  iv had. i honesty dont trust rma from companies after being bit too many times.
When I watched  Nexus' video I hoped most Techtubers would do this but I thought of it as an unrealistic dream. I will really appreciate it if you stick to that word!
This is so sad, ASUS were the mainboard to buy back in the day. In fact every computer I built in the last 10 years used an ASUS mainboard. Thanks for the heads up Jay.
I loved Asus, until now
I genuinely hope all this backlash lights the fire under Asus's asses and they fix their attitude. I genuinely like their products but I hate hypocrite more.
My last mobo was by ASUS. The on-board sound was broken. After looking online, it was common for the model of mobo from ASUS. Now I have a nice MSI fully working board 😊
Sucks X670e gene mobo 4090 rog gpu Rog monitor  Rip
Great call!!! Bye bye Asus monster
Man I felt horrible having to process our customers RMA, they literally won't give you a  free shipping label unless you get mad , they want you to shoulder the expense, and most of the RMA goes back to the customer with the same or worst issue.
For me it all started with the introduction of "ROG".
I'm also experiencing weird issues for years with ASUS boards. My latest build with a ROG STRIX X570-E Gaming WIFI II just had a lot of random stuttering in every game and just behaves weird from time to time even in just browsing the web. Sometimes it just freezes and I got to hard reset. I had the same issues with my Crosshair VI Hero I had before but some day they dropped a BIOS update and everything was fine and working like it was supposed to. I'm hoping they'll do the same for the board I own now but after that i'll never buy an ASUS board ever again.  I always liked their design and stuff but i've had enough. I think im going with MSI in my builds to come. They truly never disappointed me in any way.
The quality is the brand, once the quality is gone the brand is dead. RIP ASUS.
I was ready to put the order in for an 7800x3d and an Asus Prime X670E mobo, because its white/silver! and I've used Asus in the past, but I didnt because the parts availability was so poor in the UK.....   So glad I didn't....  I'm going to checkout that MSI board (I do know that MSI arent that great - scalping their  own GPU's is the tip the iceberg) but ASUS really are taking the p1$$ right now.
I’ve been a loyal Asus motherboard user since the 90’s when computers really began to take off.  My new rig doesn’t have an Asus board. They’re not paying attention to user needs or supporting their customers anywhere near what they once did. So I went Gigabyte. Glad I did. As far as Graphic cards go, Asus warranty replacement is garbage and their techs that actually test cards don’t do their job. So Long Asus!
Reminds me of the Apple debacles of the 90's where it was 200% form over function = money printing machine. I felt so bad for people who spent 4,000+ 1999 dollars for beautiful unreliability before Apple somewhat got its hardware shit together
ASUS, get your act together! Z690p user here (no issues so far, fingers crossed).
Good job Jay for standing up to ASUS! I wish you and the channel good luck, hope you don't suffer from the decision <3
good job i haven't used a asus product for over 20 years lol,  there no better than Nvidia  tbh,  and keep in mind you will find that it's got a lot to do with the political crap that's going down instead of taken it out on the govs they are taken it out on the people but enough of that crap :)
Kudos Jay! Btw, changing the topic, does anybody have problems with Corsair's mouse quality? I have been replacing mine a couple of times in a year.
Likely also completely illegal behaviour by Asus in jurisdictions that have proper consumer protection laws like the UK, Australia and the EU. They don't just get to say "your warranty is voided" like that. They're still liable for the statutory implicit terms of fitness for use.
Maybe Taiwan is Chinese.
ASUS has always been a shit brand for me. I stopped buying their products 5 years ago. I had 2 motherboards, one GPU and an external sound card dying from them. I haven't encountered so much issues with any other brand. I just thought that they are shit only in my country, since everywhere else you only see praise.
I've been an ASUS fan ever since I started building PCs. These past few months has been fucking rough, and I'm somewhat constantly worried for my current ASUS build. It's wild how bad ASUS has shat the bed in terms of their brand image.
Asus will definetely feel the sales drop here in Sweden
As a long term supporter of both AMD and ASUS their current behaviour is quite troubling. I'm glad I opted out of this gen. Keep up the good work Jay.
ive had 2 rog mobos, one fried tryingt o set my ram to 3200 with its xmp settings the second one im not sure if my cpu or the mobo broke but it started having issues with the pcie controller and wouldnt recognize my gpus only my rog monitors and rog gpus havent died in the time ive had them
Weird to say, but I'm so glad I went with the Asrock B650E PG-ITX. been solid as a rock. Kudos Jay for your videos.
Man I wish EVGA boards were easier to get in the UK...
Dude my recent rma with my dark hero x570 was awful.
Another episode of Jay complaining about capitalist companies being capitalists
I think that one of the problems with Asus is bringing out to many products instead of having a few and working on the quality of those.  It's easier to have a few quality products than many.  Doing some research, my local PC stores stocks 17 AM5 Asus Motherboards, whareas MSI has 6 AM5 and Gigabyte & ASRock have 5.  It's the same situation with Intel, Asus has many more motherboards.
Beautiful Video! Thx for Sharing that experience
Amazing conviction on your side ! And this with the beta bios is complete sca,.... Next time I won't buy asus parts...
I recently went MSI as the price to features was better (still a scummy brand though) and I'm glad I did. (Still miss my P8Z77V Deluxe)
I bought an AM5 motherboard from ASUS when the 7950X3D launched. Arrived with the pump headed broken. £400 and wasn’t even delivered intact. I now regret not moving to MSI and if things continue the way they are I will be making the switch.
Good on you sir! This is the info that is needed
Wow that's saddening. Here is my story. I had my own IT business in South Africa back in 2003. Had provided a customer just over 200 systems running an Asus a7n8x-e deluxe board. Within a month 8 had failed. My supplier refused to replace saying i had built them incorrectly, so i got hold of asus directly. As they didnt have a technical facility in SA, they hired a local specialist to come and have a look. He did some investigation and confirmed board failure. This all took another 2 months and additional 35-ish board fails. Based on local engineers finding,Asus flew out one of their own specialist to dig deeper on the issue along with temporary replacement systems for my customer. In the end it was identified that the boards had a major issues. In total around 140 of them were faulty. Asus provided a full replacement of boards and rrp refund for my purchase as an apology. THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. I've used Asus ever since. Please return to this level of care Asus. I dont want to turn away from you but might have to if this is now your level of customer care.
thank you jay <3
on AMD side gigabyte/aorus has msi all around have been a problem,  but ASUS outside of their Security Vulnerabilities of their software  that GiGAboom and MSI also have, but hardware side ASUS had be solid for long time, This is why EVGA AM4 was a light in the end of tunnel.   Well I guess when my workload comes down and I can finely get around on build AM5 system  AsRock motherboard and sapphire GPU.
In 20yrs of pc gaming, I’ve never bought Asus products and I never will.
to be honest I never liked ASUS as I mostly seen there products in repair shops more than any other brand.. and I always thought DELL was bad but ROG
Does this spell out the end for a big electronics company? I hope not, ASUS used to be very reputable and solid company, good quality products. I really hope they get their shit (and management) together!   And thank you Jay for not selling yourself, but instead exposing the truth!
Extreme overreaction. How many people are actually affected by the issues you mention? You YouTube tech reviewers live in your own little overly sensitive bubble. Crazy.
Shit you not, my first Asus X670E Crosshair Extreme had a very similar issue. It arrived with damaged bent pins on multiple ports on the motherboard. What a joke.
Yeah.. ASUS, you're gone from my system. Ordered ASRock B650E PG-ITX board to replace my Asus X670E-I board. Unless Asus strightens up their act, they will never again be in my system. I dont switch just because, but because stability issues with Asus products.
Goodbye Asus. Welcome Biostar.
I really wonder what the higher-ups in ASSUS think (pun intended). Do they really believe that people are still buying their stuff after their n-th MB and CPU combo fried itself, because there is no evidence on the website that supported software was used, you just downloaded two hours ago?  I'd value their words far more if they'd pull their products and make a clear statement that they are having severe problems. And after some time if they simply stated that the problem was fixed, I would believe them.  But instead they just lose every support from people like Steve and Jay, and their fans.
hmm. You can look at the bios thing that way too, but you can also wonder if it would have been better if they waited until the bios update has passed beta test and is no longer beta to release it. You still have option to ignore beta bios and wait until it is finished depending on your situation. That kind of disclaimer seems be normal for all beta stuff for all companies and it seems it just hit harder this time because the problem they try to fix is such critical one.
Ugh, Nvidia, MSI, now ASUS destroying customer trust 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️ what the 💩! That's 3 brands I don't buy from anymore
Asus was going through some serious rollercoater since the nineties as I was watching... They had recurring issues with ~good quality parts/materials every once in a while... First experience for me was capacitors started to bulge/explode, after that they come up with a new CD drive that spinned the discs so hard they exploded, but the capacitor issues were recurring from time to time... Sometimes they were taking turns with Abit on who produced worse stuff, and yes, they managed to overcome quality issues.
I haven't touched ASUS hardware ever since I got a poorly designed GeForce GTX 470 Fermi GPU in 2010.  It was all of they hype and fanboyism that ASUS had back in the day that influenced my decision more than the bad GPU itself.  I've went with MSI ever since and haven't had a single regret.  MSI might not be as polished with their software and hardware, and MSI forums might be the extent of their customer support, but for me, MSI always got the job done.
Hi, why nobody is talking about the BIOS update via windows update ! which broke some oc settings, locked some values and Asus is not allowing to go back to a previous bios version? So who updated is already stuck!
I was always getting Asus boards, because everyone has always said they were the best boards. I don't have the luxury to keep changing out motherboards to various brands and versions all the time to test for myself, so when I did an upgrade Asus was the "reliable" board. But especially with my most recent one, I keep having audio problems (via USB audio interface connecting to XLR studio monitors). And I thought that was the problem with AMD CPUs... To the point, I've decided to switch Intel next. But yeah, my latest Asus motherboard kept having lots of problems, not even talking about long boot times, when my friends with MSI etc, boot much quicker... I'm definitely not sticking with Asus for my next purchase.
damn all the stories in the comments about people using ASUS and having problems 😵😵I think ASUS will be taking a huge dip in their stocks soon.
Asus is the Apple of the gaming industry. It started well but now they just care about is UR SCHMOOONEY.
Well, my Strix Z370 works good xD
14:54 Brrr, Bec Nvidia did made it. PLS: 3k Bucks TSCHING!!! *cash sound* :>
❤👊 respect 💯
Sorry to say this but OVERCLOCKING is a SPORTs GAME its your Fault when you Install a Beta Bios and Most of all you overclock your CPU even when it said they are still Working on it and i dont Care what anyone says this is the TRUTH
I recently switched to AM5 and went for a B650 board, I nearly went ASUS but based on Hardware Unboxed reviews I decided to avoid their boards and went for the Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX instead. I'm running a standard Ryzen 7600 along with Kingston Fury Beast RAM in EXPO to get 6000mhz speed and this setup has been amazing, absolutely rock solid and brilliant performance. My SOC voltage on auto was set to 1.245v, although I updated my BIOS just to be safe. I highly recommend this setup and Gigabyte in general.
Asus = eyecandy from a long time now...their GTX cards was garbage too... From 2 years I dont recommend any Asus products for any of my clients.
Don’t go with MSI they have a compromised firmware library
Thanks Jay for bringing this situation to light.  I currently have 2 x AM4 systems running Asus boards 1 x X570-P and 1 x X570-PRO and overall they have been fine.  The only issue I have with the X570-P board is that from time to time I hear the sound like USB is disconnecting.  I just thought this was a Windows issue as the other system I have runs on Linux and doesn't do this.  I was planning on doing an AM5 build shortly, I guess ASUS is off the parts list.
I never will buy any ASUS labeled stuff anymore. That simple.
I only just built an am5 asus b650e-e build and this motherboard is a total shit show. Expo never works for one.. and now all this crap. I'm done with Asus, so disappointed. Hugh respect to Jay and gamers nexus for standing up to this crap
Yeah, for me Asus went from "trusted brand" to "will never buy one of their products again" over the course of like two weeks.
Asus X670E Crosshair Extreme and Asus 4090 strix OC here. If Asus are gonna be like this I'll take my £3.5k for GPU and motherboard else where. This is gonna backfire huge on Asus, you wanna play with my warranty, I'll send my money else where.
I am not surprised by Asus failure.  After 5 (five) new  ASUS 970 GPU's failing on me in less than 18 months,  I new something was off and avoided ASUS like hell since then. The Gigabyte 1080Ti GTX replacing those cards still works as of today.
f*ck asus ! since 2008 with their shitty optical drives they've been trying to have their own ecosystem and break other branded products in the meantime, and the funny thing is even when having everything asus - you still  get bsods constantly....absolute trash ! When a big trash company like Asus does that, there is no real redemption ! We cant just forget and move on with such lies and deception(meme intended) and especially towards consumers that they dont grant warranty and even go as low as to BRIBE !!!  Ive got one question for you @JayzTwoCents, why didnt you talk about these problems from t he years with asus before ? because i have been professionally pc building/diagnosing pc's for 14 years and asus always has been scummy and lowkey doing shady things like that, bad drivers, bios and especially TRASH customer support and RMA.....   P.S why asrock has been one of the top 3 aways - gigabyte,msi,asrock, always have been the best ! the only "problem with asrock" in the past -2007-15 was that "they didnt match" the aestetics to which every other company and consumer wanted - more rgb and screens and leds on the mobo/gpu
No more Asus products for me too
I had the x670extreme on launch. Complete shitshow. To top it off, the bios updates from shamino have dried up.  Returned it after endless stability with a 7950x.  Have a z790 extreme now but as we all know , it doesnt touch the apex on overclocking. Weird shit show going in from them
I respect u for this Jay, and now AsRock doesn't seem like a bad option for new builds. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Everytime ive used Asrock ive never had an Issue. Im using EVGA supply, MSI at the moment and honestly never had issues. Always wanted ASUS as an enthusiast level brand. But this is insane, ASUS is more or less at the highest end for PCs its an absolute joke that they can have these issues and be fine with it. I trust what jay says hes always been consumer friendly. Looks like is time to avoid ASUS... well done lads you played yourself.
lol i just checked on the german asus support side where you can download the new bios versions and there is nothing said about that bios voiding your warranty nor saying that the new bios versions are in beta . that implies to me that they can not legally void your warranty by you installing a update wich they released officially
I've been planning to build new setup around Asus motherboard (late summer), but after these news, change of plans is in order
The last period I felt that this channel was out of touch with the content I wanted, seeing this I have gotten new found respect for Jayz, I will resubscribe sir. Kudos to you for having a back bone and putting your money where your mouth is.
i just bought a b550 strix and instantly had to return it for an aorus board, because the bios flashback button was broken and I realized it after I build my pc for 3 hours. that was my last asus product :D
Duuude. I’ve been having issues with minecraft chunk stutters and tarkov menu stutters since fall last year, and i have tried everything that doesn’t involve replacing anything. Everything other than the stutters works just fine. I have an ASUS rog b550 gaming f board. I wonder if replacing it will fix it? I have tried everything and am ready to believe one of my parts are just garbage. The board will definitely be the first to replace after seeing this video.  Games like tarkov and
My old PC still works great
It SOUNDS like you knew I was getting paid today and you want me to immediately go to your merch store and support you like you're supporting us. Message received.
I don't buy Asus products and this video makes me feel good about that.
Then I'm glad I moved away from Asus for my latest build, which I chose Gigabyte instead
Now that ASUS is officially dead to me (also had bad hardware experiences) which brand would you recommend for higher end mobos?  Are EVGA boards good? How about MSI? I've had bad Gigabyte experiences so I'm avoiding them atm. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
also windows 10 installs the bios update automatically
wow.
Still waiting for the tony hawk build 😋
I even experienced problems with Asus back in 2005 where the factory fitted coolers on the chipsets let them overheat and become unstable, been using MSI ever since.
nice one Jay about time
so, we call them Assus again...
Thank you dude :-) I am in the planning stage of upgrading to AM5 and after the problems I had upgrading to AM4 it is great to know who to avoid.
I know it's serious subject but at moment you said "is started my stream and that happened" I got YouTube add. Perfect timing. 😂
Ganz schön traurig sowas und das ausgerechnet ASrock besser ist, sollte Asus zu denken geben.
I was using asus for last 10+ years.  .. but current gen, with slogans like „for those who dare and play first, work later“ this stuff is for idiots, it’s simply embarrassing to have something like this in my system. Plus all the other issues + pricing, bye bye asus, I had enough
soooo asus is avoid brand now?
Just IMAGINE ordering an asus board, and what you recieve has already a cpu socket damaged. like bruh
A possible class action suite.
Don't be sorry. What goes around, comes around.
Shame, ASUS used to be great.
Put the asrock in your bloody rig then, so I know how stupid u look as a hardware channel live streaming and ur cracker Jack mobo is screwing you over and you don’t swap it
Thank you for exposing. Wow.
Nope jay got AMDd that's the fault of the bad memory controller build in AMD Ryzen chips you can't blame the mobo for a bad memory chip common jay you should know that bad memory controllers cost instability and all things to do some funky stuff TLDR the memory chip are build in the CPU not on the mobo if you rly did not know…  Took The YouTuber long to see that Asus ROG doesn't care any more since the end of 2016 why do you guys believe then that there is no good ILM on the intel side even if intel is first party for ASUS ROG there is no good ILM like we had the 2011 ILM - 2016 V2, and of course the X299 After all nothing will change all builders will still buy ASUS ROG because the bios and board builds.  That's my topic on that drama.
I can't even call them Asus anymore and instead i call them Assus for a while now... ROG is the worst company i ever dealth with.. They are on my DNBL (do not buy list).
This is a really hard one to hear, ive had everything Asus as long as i an remember from pc to phone to headset. This makes me sad to see. I think ill be going to aorus
So; should I update to the latest X670E WIFI BIOS 1410 (Beta), or no?
Pretty sad that one of these mobos would cost me 600+ up here in Canada.  Shame that spending that kind of money wont guarantee a superior product.
I've read that the issue is not limited to just ASUS. Perhaps AMD themselves made errors in the specifications sent to mb vendors? Either way it is no surprise to see such issues with a new product from AMD, I beleive AM4's USB issues still persist, and as this issue is so series I feel AMD should pull the products until this is corrected.
Using ASRock motherboards for 8 years and for me am having solid rock stable experience, we might agree that they not good with the design but they good on performance for sure 🗿.
Asus give no fucks about smashed pins for customers they only help those who are well known content creators. They refused to help me out on z490 mobo and still sitting in closet gathering dust, i did order a replacement socket from china but haven got someone to help remove and replace it
Such a shame, Asus has been one of my favorite brands for years. I've had so many of their motherboards and GPUs... Guess I'll be avoiding them until things improve. Good on Asrock though! They've really improved from the days of avoid-at-all-costs, and even from the only-use-for-low-end-systems days. They're now just a good brand. Kudos.
Beautifully put
Sadly i got a ASUS x670e-a … seems like I will choose another brand for the future   It was already really suspicious for me inside the bios that some functions don’t seem to work the same as others on YouTube. Got higher current than other brands and some „usually“ works 99% of the time didn’t work for me
When I was going through problems with a new build just a little over a year ago. I was trying to pin point where my problem was. One potential solution was a beta bios version with the same clause. I refused to use it because if my motherboard was actually shot I'd be throwing it away and my money. Long story short, it was actually my cpu and it took putting in a different cpu just to test and prove it.   The RMA process with AMD was even less fun. They wanted me to put the bad chip back into the system and continue to run tests I already had been running for months. In the end, I had to take pictures of the bad cpu in the motherboard along with an ID code for the ticket to be visible with the motherboard id visible in the same picture. I went a step further and took pictures of the good cpu in the same and made it clear in the pictures using a photo edit to label in the image which was the bad cpu and the good cpu. Cause I didn't want to let them get it wrong. AMD did take care of me though and I am very happy having a chip that works. The original chip had a bad memory controller.
Oh i dont like this, I haven't updated my system for a hot minute and still running a old ass rampage IV board. I have a  ASUS ProArt Z790 coming with i9 and now I am terrified. I bought it our of confidence as I have had zero issues with my pc for years. I am tempted to cancel the order.
I waited to not be an early adopter, then I started to replace my old business machines 4 old intel 4 core machines with 2 asus rog strix and 2 asus tuff. I started with 7950x in one rog strix and one asus tuff and 64gb ram. Rog strix was blue screen after 1 minute in default until I remove 2 ram, then it was rock solid. I was thinking of having 3D CPU’s in rog strix and none 3D in tuff. But now I don’t dare to install 7800X3D in the rog strix, so running 7950X and 32Gb with DOCP enabled(6400mhz), if I run default at 3600mhz and 64gb it’s half stable and works for 1-3 hours then just reboot, no blue screen.  However on TUFF and 64gb at std 4800 and 7950x it’s rock solid, with DOCP at 5600 it restart some times. TUFF also react with only 2 aka 32GB at 5600 and turn to rock solid.  I wonder if power delivery is bad. 1200w and 1000w Corsair I versions, we tried switching CPU’s and memory, strix is unstable, tuff better but not good. wonder how long before we get an updated bios that works, or it is not a bios issue it’s an hardware issue and voltage fluctuations cannot be controlled by bios, if so I spent 2000$ on 4 crappy motherboards.
I would go Intel for a while Jay, you are a professional you need your gear to work. Reviewing AMD is a lot different to running it in production when you are getting stability issues and potentially crappy issues with stuff burning up.
my 6700k asus board just died out of nowhere
Glad I went with MSi
I'm using AsRock right now, i bought their board for 8600K and was very happy with it now i'm using Z690 Phantom Gaming 4 which i got like 8 months ago and i had zero issues so far . But i don't think this is just ASUS a lot of companies are lowering their standards and quality of products. I'm on my third display in a month right now 1.MAG274QRF-QD  - dead pixels at start 2.Agon AG271QG - dead pixels at start 3. Samsung Odyssey S27AG520PPX - of all things there is actual coil whine coming from a screen i didn't even know that was possible with display  Add to my already bad month.  I got be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 750W 80 Plus Gold yesterday for my RTX 4080 and guess what a fuckin coil whine coming from PSU. Which is truly disapointing because i had nothing but good things to say about Be Quiet they never failed me so far :( At least i got 4080 for 800$ so there's that at least nice for a consolation prize :P  Also love your integrity Jay . I imagine a lot of people would still put up with ASUS to not miss out on their products. Bravo!
thats why they make you sign in and tie your account to your warranty .
This is why I follow Jay and the team! - Massive respect for calling out Asus on this! They really have gone down the wrong path  Next build will still be AMD, but will not be Asus! Not until they fix this absolute mess
Good to watch this after buying new pc with asus tuf gaming z690-plus motherboard 3 months ago.
Lucky the ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-E GAMING WIFI is good
It's great to see creators finally waking up to how bad asus are with their tech and never mind the asus tax they charge
If the problem is that serious, and catching fire, then Asus should not be rolling out a product.
I've been an Asus motherboard fan since Abit disappeared sometime 98ish and have never had a proble, now running a 7950X3D with an Asus Strix 650E-E Gaming which now has me worried. After all this I will definatelly look elsewhere in future upgrades, as you said, enough is enough, Kudos.
ASUS's corporate mission statement is caveat emptor. I was looking at the ASUS PN51. The QVL list was full of obsolete and bogus entries. I wasted 7 months trying to get technical support instead of PR flack. Apparently, they are in the process of firing their competent engineers and managers.
Start by ripping that cracker Jack peace of crap out of ur personal rig
when i built my first pc, i had the natural mentality of oh asus is high end and must be the best products given their price tags, but in building my second pc i chose to use mostly gigabyte products as i found that for the exact same performance that i needed from my system i could spend hundreds of dollars less
lul bandwagon much
Very timely with the lift of the Ally’s Embargo 😂
The software department of ASUS is actual garbage. Armory Crate and the driver and addons and bs it comes with is insane.
I don't know why AsRock had such a bad wrap... I've been using their boards since 2012~ish and have never had an issue with them... The only computer component brand I've had issues with was MSI... A 2011-3 Motherboard and a GPU...
16:09 I've gone through that with two companies. After dealing with the same thing with the first company a few years later I had a problem with a computer component so I gave them all the details they needed plus more with everything I done to try to resolve my issue in the email.   They still asked me what I done to resolve the issue despite the fact I already answered the questions they asked me in each email I received.  After a few days back and forth I got very fed up of the bs and demanded a replacement or refund. I told them in not such a nice manner that I already gave them all the details they needed and more , more than once and they were still asking me to do it again.  They went to the manager and gave me a replacement with an apology.  Another company who I bought a steering wheel from was just as bad. The first one the thing died after six weeks so in the RMA email I sent I told them everything that was happening with video proof.   It took them ten days to reply and they proceeded to ask me what I had done and what to do to try to resolve the issue. Which I already told them what I done. It took them a few days to respond after I once again told them what I done to resolve the issue. They then asked for pictures or video proof which I already sent them so I re sent it to them. Every single email was as jay said condescending bs for a month before they replaced the wheel.   Then a month later the power supply for the wheel died so I had to go through it again. And when they sent me a replacement they sent me a used unit.  The replacement wheel lasted three months before it stopped self calibrating so once again I had to go through the ringer again but it took longer to get a replacement because they were accusing me of intentionally breaking the wheel. I didn't get the second replacement for free either.  So I decided to move on to Logitech because I wasn't going to deal with such a company again.
omg its a v8 conputer
last ASUS for me was a laptop and that was over a decade ago  I haven't bought an ASUS mobo in ages for reasons and I feel vindicated now
There are people at ASUS actually making these decisions, pushing or enforcing ridiculous policy, the wrong people in the wrong positions, they need to go for the bran to survive and recover.
I upgraded to AM5 about 2 weeks ago and haven't really had any issues with my B650 Aero G motherboard or 7800x3D. I'm hoping it really is just Asus so I can maybe use Expo at some point lol
2 weeks ago I have built my new PC, Asus Motherboard... Worst decision I took in a while... Blue screen crashes non stop. So, I have to use my old PC :( Edited: I wish I knew all this before spending nearly 4k on a brand new PC that I am afraid to switch on.
Jay I will take your asus products. I could use them
Yep called this way back in the haswell days. Will be interesting to see how Asus respond tho - are they just gonna die off - or are they actually gonna make a play for a redemption arc.
Man been using/depending asus as a "sure thing" kinda brand, for around 20 years...guess they got complacent. SMH,  bad logik., ayyeeee, DAMn jayz, thanks for lookin out for consumers man I been wanting to upgrade my x570 hero to the new gen, but instincts been giving weird feelings about that, then i see the smokin 3d stuff, i was SURE it was a bad run of cpus or somethin.. , Asus, please remember, every product bought represents a REAL person, I love tech ,not just bc Its part of my career, but bc they connect real people, when you forget about the people....well, u forget bout the folks, you go broke...and a FOIA request?? JEEEEze,  time for a humbling time, sad to see them leave that pedestal...in my heart at least...Ive always gave them lots of praise over the years, lets see if this reaction is like smelling salts and wakes them from their slumber, just remember asus, the sooner you turn around after making a wrong turn, the quicker you get back on track...listen to Jayz two cents. man..im kinda bummed.
this is why i watch jay more than anyone else, hes not “hollywood” if you understand what im saying
There's thread about powerlimit problems on Asus 4070. Asus just deny everything.
Laughs in stable Intel
Excellent video, well done guys!
Kinda want to know if there has been head changes with ASUS, it could be any head changes and not just the top like the CEO. Any head that has any say on what's being done and approved to go out and even management of how things is handled can cause these problems and inconsistencies.
All the issues you said you had I got them on AM4 with asrock I think my issue was AMD, TPM used to cause loads of weird audio issues and stutters until a bios update. I still get weird minor things like audio problems. I was thinking about going back to intel because of this reason
Hah! Welcome to me, circa 15 years ago.  Everyone is going to have their own experiences of course, but I found ASUS might make performant hardware that's great 99.9% of the time with the other 0.1% completely screwing you over in random system faults that they will put on YOU as the cause. I left them for Gigabyte mostly and have built over 200 systems (this is work+home combined) that have been all rock solid.  Couldn't be happier with my decision.
Nooo make review for the z790 apex first 😑
Defective firmware and fix that voids warranty? Sounds like planned obsolescence with plausible deniability.
Jay be different and test some different stuff like Biostar and AsRock and whoever else makes boards these days, all the tech channels heavily push ASUS, MSI or Gigabyte.
When starting a white build in 2020, I got a Asus Prime and had to wait a long time to get a R7 5800 when I fanelly got it it was well over the return period for the motherboard, but it was DAI, it didn't work, but was able to test it until later that year. Amazon worked with me though, and I ended up getting a Gigbyte Vision G motherboard and an  i7 11700K.  The Vision motherboard actuall fits bette (the headers lined up with the cut outs on the case).  Sio in the end I'm happy with it.
I have ASUS x470-F1 Gaming and i have similar issues... right now some usb 3 which are not working.
You're just bandwagoning based on another creator's content LOL
The GPU in the mega man build was from ASUS wasn't it?
Wow. This is really interesting cuz tho it's am4, ever since I installed my 5800X3D in my ASUS A-520MA, my Asrock RX 590 OC is like, fried or sumn. Oh, and that was AFTER finding out about xmp and using the profile available (only 1). Now, maybe it's another issue in my case cuz my MSI 1060 is playing like a gem under same settings, still, I wouldn't expect this from ASUS. I only bought from them becasue of their reputation, but now? File 13. Ok maybe not but future purchases are a no go, which SUCKS for me, but I'll bite the bullet! Good to see a CC that actually does the same. It's gotta be a whole nother level for u tho, that's, income and resources, so kudos mayn, u did the right thing that others are afraid to do cuz they wanna continue swimming in their Scrooge McDuck money bins!^^ Thx Jay, (and THANX STEVE!)!^^ \O>
I no longer remember the details, but this is far from the first time they did stuff like that. Remember them doing shady BS maybe 10-15 years ago when I had almost pulled the trigger on buying some ASUS parts. Have honestly ignored them since... Just like I would never buy a Samsumg TV or monitor again, since they fucked us all over with the capacitor scandal...
Isn't ASRock a part of ASUS brand?
I am glad I did not buy any AM5 motherboards from ASUS.MSI and ASROCK from now on.
Easy workaround, if your board has a fault after installing the beta BIOS, before sending it back, apply some voltage to the BIOS chip - then they won't know what version you are running - gotta box clever people. If it dies a horrible death, they can't really check anyway without some serious forensics. The retailer would have refunded you WAAAYY before Asus got the board back and are they really going to be checking what BIOS version is running on a bunch of dead boards?
Man, I've been scouting the mobo market for a few weeks now for my new 7800x3d build and had eventually put my mind on an ASUS board. Boy am I happy that I havent made the purchase yet, definitely going to go for a different brand now.
Cant trust MSI firmware and software anymore, cant trust ASUS rma anymore, good thing i went with asrock^^
A like and a comment for the algorithm gods, community needs to stand up to shady stuff like this.
Asus been doing those overvolting things even before the AM5. Asus gpus and Intel chips on Asus mobos usually shoot up high as well but stabilize after a few seconds. It is just a matter of time for someone in Asus to miscalculate on new platforms and mess up pretty bad for small headstart on performance.
F Asus
There isn't even a real fix for the x570 series from Asus.
I've had loads of trouble with my Asus board. Overpriced, overrated.
What a video.
**laughs in AORUS**
It's disappointing to see shit like this happen. I always leant towards and liked ASUS / ROG stuff, as they've always been pretty good (I currently even use the ROG Phone 6).  Guess we'll see if they get their fingers out of their arses and turn things around...
I can 100% relate. Have been avoiding Asus for more than a decade now because I constantly got memory issues, sometimes even with the exact ram that was specified als working and tested in the manual. Asrock Taichi: 100% agree. Have a Tachi X470 and X570 Razer running here, both are having zero issues. The X570 has every drive connector in use, almost every USB port (some with old devices with hacked-together drivers to make them work under Win10), lots of additional devices, and all memory banks running at XMP profiles, and it is just amazingly stable. The Razer edition does not get Bios updates as fast as the non-razer sadly, but apart from that I plainly love it.
Just to be sure. I watched multiple videos now about the amd x3D CPUs exploding. My current Board is the ROG STRIX B650E-E and I got the 7950x3D. I updated to BIOS version 1413, which states "SoC voltage for Ryzen 7000X3D series limited to a maximum of 1.30V to protect the CPU and motherboard.".  In the video however it's mentioned that ASUS still didn't fixed the issue. So is it safe now with BIOS 1413 or not? I'm a little confused. If it's not safe, should I just not use my PC until something got fixed? The situation rn sucks.
MSI Fan here. I hope MSI will be doing nothing like this in the future. It's a hard hit if you like and support a brand, and recommend it to others. And then such a BS happens. So the conclusion is, it doesn't matter how big the copany is and / or how good of a reputation the company haves.  Everyone can screw it. So its better to compare all brands  against each other and don't buy every year blind of the same.
I bought my Asus x670e-f  motherboard with Ryzen 7900x  3 days  ago, and because I saw these videos i decided to go with the latest bios 1402 to be safe!  And here they say that not only it's still not safe and I'm also lose my warranty?😂  I also realized that updating the bios didn't stop the VSOC from being overvolting, it was still like 1.35 after the update with 6200 DDR5 , so i decided to lower the VSOC manually and put the Max VSOC on 1.2 , and after that when I checked the VSOC with HWINFO I saw that it was still higher than 1.2 !! It was on 1.27 😂 , So what you guys think I should do at the moment? Any suggestions? Was Updating the bios a wrong move ?💀 Because updating to 1402 version didn't even fix the problem in the first place!!!
Its a shame because aesthetics wise the higher end Asus boards have always been the best looking. Just the simple things like the cover on the right hand side of the extreme board cleans everything up so well compared to just bare PCB.
this was me.... 2011... and I vowed: "Never again will I touch an AMD product." Now I feel sad I swapped to ASUS after my MSI board was DOA... ...touch wood - the board is ok...  though, it cost more and had a LOT less features than the MSI
how many videos of him explaining that the capitalistic system is flawed does he need to do until you all realize that this free market doesn't work? and why is nobody being that bold with nvidia the ultimate moneygrabing black hole
So AMD has been getting the blame for an ASUS problem, sounds about right.
I love Asus and specially they ROG lineup so much… But yeah , overallAsus quality in all areas I face was terrible … 3 headphones replaced with new one had same issue … Router from the best lineup had issue with overheating and 2.4hz channel issue … Really , wtf ASUS …
So, if Asus now has crap boards and crap service, what mainboard manufacturer is top dog (not in sales figures)? Cause I heard similar stories before, from Gigabyte (personal experience, twice), MSI, Asrock. And I'm definitely not moving to Biostar....
Glad Australia has strong RMA policies. You don't mess with the producer, you just go to the store and grab a new part and get cleared at the register in 5 mins. I bought a wireless thermometer that broke and the company wanted me to ship to America for RMA, with no guarantee it would be replaced. Just went back to the store and got a new one in seconds
Okey, yes Asus have royally screwed up. But I do feel you sound a bit entitled by needing to get a free MB from Asus. I however don't accept they send you BROKEN ones. Holy moly they screwed up big time.  EDIT: Then again... might be in the contract
About time. ASUS just lives off its good name from the past for more than a decade now. It's incredible how hard you can f*ck up and still be seen as "the no1 gaming brand" (lol)
Thank you, Jay!
Asus has so powerful advertisement/pr division, its shame their engineer division are so poor.  I bought Asus laptop (700e) in 2016. Laptop died in 2017 because of motherboard failure. It was rmaed successfuly. I thought "okay, shit happends" and in 2019 I bought second Asus laptop (1200e). It died in 2021 with another motherboard failure. But once more I successfuly rmaed it. (I live in europe, so our  asus rma division is better, than what Ive heard about us rma) And after this two failures, I still wanted to buy Asus mb for my build for 7800x3d. I am glad I dodged the bullet and went with MSI.  Also, my Asus mouse has broken f mousewheel after 1 year. Is it really that hard to make even mouses?
I had stability problems with my ASUS PRIME X570-P w/ 3800X for months that required disabling low C-states in the BIOS (like it was stalling and rebooting).  I didn’t have another CPU or mobo to try and waited for a few BIOS updates to appear, but none helped.  I eventually got a 5800X and HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS, so knew it wasn’t the CPU.  Then, there was another BIOS update, which I tried and was kinda surprised to see it fixed the issue.  This build has been in test bench mode for nearly 2 years all because of BIOS issues.  There was another BIOS just within the past few months that I avoided out of fear it would regress, but I finally bit the bullet and installed it and still have no issues.  This whole build made me weary of Ryzen and the BIOS updates are hard to say if they are AGESA-related (AMD) or changes ASUS made, but I couldn’t find similar issues on other AM4 mobos, so I’m now leaning more towards ASUS instead of blaming Ryzen.
I've been using ASUS motherboards for quite a while. I never had real issues with them, so I am surprised to see how dilettantish they have become. Given that motherboards are not cheap anymore, I'd probably avoid them too now. What surprises me is that they think that the capital they have built through amassed brand trust in the past is enough to afford them enough arrogance to spit on their customers for the remainder of the universe's lifetime. I hope that it has strong reverberating effects.
Well done bro. Well done. I appreciate your decision to fire the Asus from your channel. I hope everyone does this .
How can I make sure that it is my MB that is at fault here and not just a bad CPU? I had suspicions that my Z690 Strix DDR4 WiFi was... Acting up to say the least.  My 12700K bluescreened on me almost daily before I turned off any and all optimisations except XMP. I disabled everything that said "controlled by BIOS" or set it to "intel default". I checked temps with HW64 but the apparent issue is voltage control when the cores start boosting from idle - especially E cores. So I went into the BIOS and set up Vdroop and such to OC levels without actually doing any OC. Since then it runs stable, but I always wondered if it's because of my MB, cooling, PSU or, as far as Asus weird SP score goes, a bad CPU that can't take any OC at all. From checking with either manufacturers, I had no reason for RMA so far as it's not determinable where it comes from, but I also don't have the money to get another MB to test it. It also takes way too much time as I could do it.  Is there an easy way I just missed or is ASUS whole AI-Bios stuff so insanely unstable that I shouldn't expect it to work at all? Isn't that what I paid for?
Glad I am running Gigabyte/Intel combos at home and work.
I've been thinking about going AMD with my next PC, and was actually looking at ASUS ROG boards.  After hearing this, I will be looking elsewhere for a board.  Glad I hadn't purchased anything yet!
I said on Steve's channel, but I'll say it here as well. 13 years ago when Asus again had problems with their votlages, i turned to AsRock for the first time and was actually surprised how solid it was. Then years later they launched their Steel Legend and Taichi series of mobos, I started building A LOT more rigs and I've had nothing but rock solid performance from them. In the last 5 years I've built more than 100 rigs with AsRock mobos and had only 1 failure which actually was due to user error, but they RMA it w/o issue. The only other brand I trusted this much was EVGA on their GPUs.
its a shame they fallen so far, asus was the go too for me for reliability and quality years ago. The people at the top don't care long as there stil making money its the poor reps and support that got to deal with angry customers, def gona avoid ASUS for the foreseeable future
Sweet Mega Man X figure.
This is why we stay here watching and supporting you. We need teams like yours to stand up for us little folk. Huge KUDOS team Jayz2C 🙏
I had started losing confidence in ASUS motherboards a while back and made the switch to MSI. I tried ASRock first but one of the boards I got was straight up possessed. I finally landed on MSI and now I've had 4 perfectly stable systems running with their boards. 2 of the last 3 ASUS boards I've had were just not good. Too many random, weird issues and instability. Just getting fan speeds adjusted have been a problem. I have right now an X670E Tomahawk (with a 7800X3D) and a B650 Edge (7700X) from MSI, both with manual undervolts on the SOC and VCORE, with EXPO and PBO enabled. Both have been fantastically solid and good performers. I didn't spend long dialing them in and have had no issues out of them.  But, geez, Armory Crate. That software alone is why I plan on avoiding ANY ASUS hardware in the future. I have an ASUS RTX 4070Ti and I've just accepted the fact that the lights on it are either rainbow or off as that's the only two things that work in OpenRGB. I installed Armory Crate on a previous system for all of 15 minutes before I was running REVO Uninstaller trying to remove that nightmare. What the hell is wrong with ASUS? I don't like MSI Center either but at least it's not as horrendous as Armory Crate.
damn asus has become the new gigabyte in crap software support....
Just facts
Software does seem to be a weak point to ASUS for me at this point. I recently replaced Armoury Crate with G-Helper (open source alternative!!) which bumped my performance on the FX506LH considerably (i dunno, 15%? tbh i was just looking to have it not use so much system resources or a whole fucking window for a few settings i sometimes touch) Now I'm starting to wonder if there's an open source BIOS that works on the F15, cuz i'm tired of the lack of options on those F7 'advanced' menus.
Had a z390 Apex which I really loved, I was planning to go for a ROG x570/x670/z690/z790 next build but wondered if the price gap really worth it over other brands, I mean asus always was at the higher side of the price list, but at least you knew it was quality. Now we are at the point where we pay crazy amounts money for parts that shouldn't even leave the factory, thats disapointing to say at least. I wonder if Linus, Der8auer, etc will still feature Rog boards in their daily content cause they have a huge influence on buyers. Anyways, big ups for you Jay for keeping it real.
Asus Warranty Service in Vietnam is awful. They reject their products with idiot reasons
You know, I’ve been trying to tell people about this sort of behaviour when it comes to discussions about the ASUS Ally. How do you expect a company like this to keep up with what the software end, in a device where it matters the most
Lol what's with 323 people not liking the video? It must be ASUS  employees.  ASUS was my go to brand for years. But my current mptherboard is MSI because when I was upgrading my computer a few years ago ASUS motherboards were too expensive. Now seeing the problems with their motherboards lately I'm sticking with MSI.  19 years ago when I worked in a computer store we called MSI More Sh!t inside 😂. But MSI is a good brand.
I stopped using ASUS 3 years ago when I tried to RMA a motherboard that had resistors and capacitors that were loose on the MB four of the capacitors where half soldered on. Since then I have used ASROCK MB's and never had an issue since going with them.
Based on the decisions and information brought forth by both you and Steve, I will not be buying an ASUS product in the near future, or beyond that, should they decide to continue their practices. One division acting shady means all divisions are now suspect. Thank you for having my back as a consumer.
13:15 I'm glad I went AsRock. My Taichi is solid. Great bang for buck board.
Offf the "but you don't care" at the end.
Dam i have Rog Phone, and ROG Laptop, and really old iPhone (and will never get apple product again). So asus you are going to same box as apple. Thanks for warning JayZ. Yes for me how company handles customers is more important that quality or prices (As long as both are around average of what competition offers).
my MSI x470 has done 5 years, 2 cpu's , 2 brands and speeds of ram, 3 bios updates and never put a foot wrong.
Z790 boards have an issue where the NICs go dormant at a hardware level. The mobo no longer can find the Intel 226 NIC. I've had this happen on 2 ASUS boards and I finally gave up with RMA/Returns and am using an Ethernet to USB-C adapter. This doesn't sound like a big deal but for a 500 dollar motherboard this is unacceptable. I made a post in the ASUS Reddit forum about this and multiple people are having this very same issue, but ASUS is radio silent.
Has anyone noticed that the B650 Prime is bent around the Socket? I also received a B650 Prime with a bend Bios reset thing
I'm personally running a Strix B650E-I motherboard paired to a 7900X3D and I personally haven't had too many issues with it that weren't self inflicted (lowering socket voltage too low, tightening RAM timings too far, etc...) But integrity is the backbone to longevity for consumers. Consumers aren't stupid, collectively they know when a brand is being deceitful and this REALLY sucks, because ASUS was the go to kingpin only 6/7 years ago in the PC industry, they seemed absolutely untouchable, but MSI, Gigabyte and even ASrock, have not just caught up to ASUS, they've managed to overtake in some aspects.
This is kinda scary especially since the soon release of the ROG Ally!
They really should care because every potential "view" on this video was a potential customer. They should know this lol.
AsRock was once Asus's budget line of product, it was created to rival other budget boards of the 2002 era. But now Asiarock is it's own standalone brand. Ive used, loved and relied upon AsRock in the past on a few boards, NEVER had any issues, boards are dependable and pretty much don't die. I had an old asrock Socket A mobo years ago, it literally blew two caps, and an IC near the USB header fried too. It carried on working flawlessly for a further 3yrs after. So yes i personally recommend AsRock as a brand.  I love Asus & i have my second full ROG build, but with what Ive been seeing and reading im shocked and feeling bad for all those who are having all this crazy BS with the brand now. As you say it's total disregard and complacency. I hope Asus can sort their sh*t out as it is such a major brand and one that will be sorely missed if they continue to drop in the market due to screwing consumers over.   Having new platform issues or issues with a product in general is common for companies. But to have a major issue platform wide, that also kills other parts, and the fix for it is an update that totally voids your warranty. -- Totally unacceptable.  Major respect to you for standing by the consumer in all this and also using your own issues as even more basis for your decision.    All i keep hearing now is what ive said to myself over the almost 30yrs ive been working with computers - The most expensive isn't always the best. Also being at the bleeding edge isn't always a great place to be. Don't jump too soon.
I have been building and selling for a little over 2 years now and I can say Asus has the worst customer service out there. one example is in my personal rig I had a z690 ROG STRIX die after a bios update and sent it in for repair under warranty. I get an email back saying that traces on the motherboard were damaged but the pics didn't show anything. They wanted to charge me $630 for a $400 board. I declined and had it sent back. When I got it back it was in a different box with no packaging. More than half the pins were smashed. When I called I was told it was my fault for not sending them better packaging. Never again... Suck it Asus
full AMD set of components, top tier on start of 2021. This use one old part of ASUS (graphics card). It was 2021 we all had problems with new graphics cards (availability and cost) ... The end of the problems is just beginning to loom on the horizon... So I stayed with the "old" (RX 570) video card. She landed my system in a blue screens, once every couple of months (sometimes more often). Changed it to a new AMD from gigabytes. Beauty and peace has come, and the complete absence of blue screens.
I had bought an asus monitor 24 inch it had the most spectacular image quality and frame rate capability for gaming and movies unfortunately no real sound ever worked on it the built in speakers were real trashy and could not hook up an external speaker off the monitor and it also caused speakers that I had hooked up directly to the cpu to not function properly what a piece of crap it turned out to be!!
For me Asus is dead after z87boards,  MSI after z490 boards !!Now im using only gigabyte...yes the bios is complicated but its stable with 11900k and solid like rock)
I've had ALOT of asus products throughout the years. Starting with the P35 chipset right through to x99 and I was very happy with the expereience. I currently have a x570 dark hero and its been a bad experience from the start and support has been terrible. I know I won't be buying asus again.
I am literally picking out parts for my new PC build and will no longer be going with asus
You've missed fart ending in this video)
Unfortunately most brand starts small, learning and enthusiastic. They get bigger and make great products and have great service. After a few years of being amazing, it's all about aesthetics and money, quality service and products goes down the drwin and consumers be damned. Hapoends ti most companies that gets big.
Appreciate the honesty and not willing to take Asus money.   Luckily there is awesome alternatives.    Hopefully companies like gigabyte and MSI also continue their high quality products and no that us builders take this seriously.  Their market is generally builders nowadays.   This isn't the 1990s when there were 30 or so motherboard brands.   We're down to about 6.   In which HP, Intel, Dell are brands.  LoL on ASRock.   First time I saw one, a new client had bought a cheap computer. Around 2002.   I open it up and saw my first ass ASRock... The CPU was soldered to the board.  It was very basic and badly designed and of course it wasn't reliable.  How bad do you have to mess up in which ASRock has surpassed you?  Now if ASRock can make their products look better.   I have their RX 6600 GPU.  The ugliest RX660 on the market.  Hands down.  Why did I buy it?   Reviews were: among the quietest of the RX6600 cards and it was about $50 cheaper than the rest by average.  XFX looked good... Not $80 extra good.   (Today, that XFX card is the same price of the ASRock)
Good on you for taking a stand and putting your money where your mouth is. I've been having issues with a brand new build since the day the 7800x3d released. Since that time, I've seen 4 beta bios, three of which were released in the same week. The problem is that these issues are EXTREMELY hard for the average user to diagnose because we don't have 6 motherboards and 20 different GPU's to try. I'm still using as ASUS board in a pc I built in 2017, using a 1070, that has NEVER crashed. I never even updated the bios or chipset, it just worked.
beta... no warranty...use at own risk that sounds very familiar......... the recent worldwide medical intervention.
I think it’s very interesting that a company will not only send you a product for free for a sponsorship but will send you MORE than what you asked for. Seems like they could be slightly less generous to the influencer who isn’t even paying for the product and splurge more for the consumer. These elaborate unboxings these companies send to influencers in the form of PR packages is really insulting to the consumer if you think about it because it’s really showing you how they treat the customer versus the influencer.
thanks man i was even planning on buying the rog ally but this changes that time to get the steam deck
Running Asus B550 E-Gaming, had a lot of problems with USB conection
this is why i love this channel !
I was gonna make a joke about maybe Taiwan should be a part of China after the Asus quality blunder over the years but then I realized Gigabyte and MSI are also Taiwanese companies, lol... Nvm then.
In my opinion MSI is even worse, everything MSI that I've bought has broken very quickly and the quality isn't there at all. I've noticed Asus going downhill as well...
Wow..what a statement.
INTEGRITY, You can't buy it. *insert long applause*. Jay, well done. Amazing.
But Jay, they do NOT make good hardware! They just make beautiful hardware, that's the entire thing here, they HARDWARE is breaking and they're not doing anything about it. I remember having bought 2 Asus phones with a design issue that caused a touchscreen failure, both phones had the issue and Asus told me to wait for a firmware update, it came and it didn't fix it, then after sending them to repair they only fixed one and gave an excuse for the other one! Also watch GN's new video on this topic, their hardware are just overvolting things always and don't do what you tell it to do in the BIOS, I uses to buy Asus back in the day because their products were higher quaility and lasted longer but lately my Asus products have been dying even faster than other brands, even Gigabyte who I had sweated not to buy anymore a few years ago, well guess what the store near here that I went to buy a replacement for my Asus board only had gigabyte boards in stock, it has already outlasted the Asus board, and now I'm definitely not buying anything Asus again for a while.
MSI for life   :)
Have you noticed that almost every Asus 3080 and 3080 cards have coil whine? The Strix edition have also many fans issues?
I have ASRock MBs in both of my PCs. Thanks Jay, it is great that you are willing to put your money where your mouth is when reviewing and giving your opinion on these products.
I picked the cheapest $70 h610 ASUS board for my i3 12100f. For last few months I have it it didn't have issues. Funnily enough i had so much issues with MSI  h81m i5 4590 system it was so hard to get into bios save settings, in one point i couldn't even post. And yes i didn't want to pick Asrock board even tho it was cheaper because I heard their quality wasn't as good.
I work in sales at a computer store, and I think I'll be recommending MSI over ASUS for mobos and GPUs. All their stuff seems to be wayyy overpriced, GPUs especially. I've always seen MSI as "luxury on a budget". They don't have the beauty of the ASUS designs, but they're pretty close, and their quality is consistent. Their GPUs are pretty great too.
I built a new AMD PC 2 months ago, and let me tell you I didn't even think of going Asus for some reason. I was locked in to go the MSI route from the get-go, and seeing this now I'm so happy I did so. The only ASUS piece of hardware I got was my keyboard (TUF GAMING K3), and that was only because I couldn't find the Steel Series that I initially wanted. Seeing this right now makes me so glad I didn't even think of going with Asus. The X3D CPU's is a very unique series of processors which seems to be too much for some of the motherboards out there, and that mainly has to do with how the motherboards are programmed, the BIOS, software, etc. Most of the accidents involving X3D processors are mainly caused because of overclocking BS, or instability with voltages (also subject to overclocking), and bad bios, and/or bad software, optimization specifically regarding the X3D processors. Same sh*t had happened with some 5800X3D's where some mor*ns were literally trying to overclock it just because the motherboard's overclocking feature was not programmed to lock out with processors of that series. In all honesty, that is the fault of these people. However, as manufacturer YOU ARE OBLIGATED to have your products and/or software optimized for any circumstances you might encounter. So, although some of these accidents are the fault of the owners, the manufacturers could have avoided that, if they could've released specific bios, and/or software, to accommodate this specific series of processors. So, all in all you are 100% right, but let's not downplay the st*pidity of some people out there, especially in this day and age when everyone is just doing all kinds of st*pid sh*t just to put it on the internet and make some rounds online. Same people who are now probably stuck with tens of PS5's crying in a corner because they can't sell their scalped products anymore. I don't feel sorry for these people, but the rest of us don't have to put up with that sh*t. So, yeah Asus needs some extended corner time to think and reflect on all their BS.
0:30   So the defining moment here should have been that Jay got everything that is NOT ASUS and surround himself with those motherboard boxes so as to further show the impact of how ASUS's actions would impact @JayzTwoCents pressing forward, BUT INSTEAD Jay floods the surrounds with all ASUS products ONE LAST TIME. lolz , trigger pulled may have been far more effective here. if done otherwise. PEACE.
I have been watching Jay's video for a long time. His show of integrity finally made me subscribe to this chanel.
Great video as always and one that I hate that you understandably had to do. ASUS as a whole has gone down hill hardcore year after year. While I know their motherboards are in the spotlight right now, their laptops have been an insane hit or miss crazy time shit show for years. Will you laptop have backlight bleed so bad it will washout part of the screen? Will it have massive coil whine? Will the fans have a grind? Will the liquid metal leak? Will their software cause all sorts of strange instability? And then after dodging that mine field, if you have to RMA their laptop, you may get it back damaged. The amount of people of Reddit posting post RMA photos with chassis damage when they got their laptop back is disgusting. They make really cool looking products, and when they work they work very well. However, they are no longer the brand of quality they were 10 years ago, and it bums me out.
And this is why independent reviewers like Jay, Steve, Linus are needed. As long as those guys don't call out company's on their BS and inform public on what is really going on alot of people lose money.
Damn dude!  I've always had such a high opinion for ASUS, I had a cheap laptop from them that lasted for almost a decade, I saw the same one used in numerous healthcare and business roles over those years and their customer service was always on point.  This is a sad sad day for what I always looked to as a Quality standard company.
Asus refused to service my zenfone 7 pro camera module motor's dying less than a year after buying it. Never buying shit from them again
NVIDIA is also on that path, money money money money money, screw you consumer, pay 4x or 5x more of product worth and becasue of that the new stuff is also ugely inflated.
I've started seeing the signs back before the Skylake Intel CPUs.  My 4790k had the turbo settings cranked up excessively on the Asus H81 motherboard it was on. I know, should be on a Z97 board, but 1-was building an ITX build, 2- the only Z97 itx mobo was long gone and 3- Asus had this model shipped with the bios for Haswell Refresh support included.  Problem is, even on a beefy cooler, it would spike the temps to 100 and force my PSU to fire off the OVP (Only realized that after I fixed the issue). Turns out undervolting the turbo values and amps managed to have it run cooler but also at the full turbo speeds advertised without stability issues. Before I did that fix in the bios I tried a bios update but the problem persisted after the update.  The Scar II laptop isn't safe from criticism as well. The battery manages to last less than 10 seconds when older laptops that I have managed to at least hold on for a couple minutes. Also the SD card reader won't read perfectly working cards and I found out many others face the same issue.  The Z690 Plus Wifi I started using in March for some reason doesn't play well with having my nvme enclosure plugged onto it's rear usb-c port, causing i/o issues when copying to the nvme, and didn't play well with my 1060 Strix, where it caused BSODs after around 6 hours of use around the time I'd be browsing the internet. Card wasn't at fault, popped it back into my 4790k build, stress tested and it didn't cause a BSOD.  I dunno. I gave up on trusting them. My dad for some reason still trusts them blindly, which is why he pushed their Z690 board into my shopping list but I'm not liking the path this is going down.  At this rate I'll turn into one of those geezers that is stuck with 16 year old hardware cause he gave up keeping up due to growing disillusioned
that's why i don't buy any amd product , because  always got problem and then she will said is normal
Massive respect and applause for doing this, people with integrity are hard to come by in 2023.
Pretty crazy as Asus used to be a top tier quality brand. I have 2 IPS displays form asus some ProArt 27" 1440p monitors that have lasted me for 10years before just recently one of them died, and they have been so color accurate through almost their entire life time. Like i have only had to correct them once and that was last year.
well its a good thing i have a gigabyte motherbord in my system :)
I'm just waiting for my x570 Tuf with a non x3D chip to explode. Oh this only effects people who want the cutting edge? I snooze. We've known for ages if you want stability you get something seasoned. But go off. I got a dead Asrock board from right before I set this system up where every single USB stopped working randomly I can send you if you think they are the answer lol. This Asus Tuf has been the most stable thing I've ever had.
Same exprience here, I was always an MSI + Intel guy, never really any issues, but the issues started when an ASUS board with the 13600k, mainly that there's no ErP power settings, because they never got it to work properly so they just removed it from their BIOS, then also sometimes when it would shutdown restart, it only half shutdown, the system would still be powered, RGB and fans on and I'd have to hard kill it.  Then I sold that system and instead got a 670E motherboard from ASUS with the 7900 (non-x), that one takes forever to POST, yes I have 64GB of memory, but on the intel CPU and MSI boards it didn't matter if I had 64GB or 128GB, it would just go through in a blink and just last week I had the same issue with this one where it powered off, but the fans and lights stayed on. Also on this system I had the same issue you described where USB items were suddenly unrecognized after startup and then came back.  These 2 builds were teh first time I took an ASUS board, but also the last time, next build will be MSI motherboard again.
Every dead Asus Mobo I've ever had was due to my own doing... pushing my old AM2 and AM3 builds too hard. My AM3+ is sitting in a box right now after serving me faithfully for almost 10 years. I went with MSI when I finally moved to AM4, because the price was better at the time. I might end up staying with MSI.
I been using a ASrock motherboard now for nearly 10 years and I haven't had one single problem with it in that time. The only problems I been having with my current board is possible overheating causing shutdowns but that may be due to wear and tear after all it has had heavy use every day for the last ten years. Currently in the process of building a new PC and have gone with ASrock again for the motherboard. There is nothing Asus here.
And that’s why I only buy MSI motherboards 😅
Another comment: Asrock? They had a bad rap since the early 1990's and now they got their act together! How long will that last.
I have happily paid a premium for asus stuff, have had alot too. But the brand tax is too much, given these recent event im happy to go over to MSI or perhaps Gigabyte. You dun fkd up Asus.
ASRock, lfg 🔥🔥
Do you think that this is just an ASUS motherboard issue or is it all ASUS products that have gone down hill? I have 2 ASUS routers that I'm using as the beginning of a wider mesh system and so far I have noticed little issues here and there which I wrote off as issues with the house and/or ISP. Is this a bigger, full brand issue or should I change out my ASUS routers before it's too late and it would cost a small fortune? Side note, I have to admit that I like their mesh network app.
Trough the years i have become very fond of asrock.. We have loads of costumers by now with their stuff and the only rma we had in the past 3 years was a single x570 steel legend board that stopped posting. And i'm still not convinced it wasn't the board but rather a pebkac bios update related thing as the user said it happend after updating the bios!
Not just the software support, but also the software itself. ASUS software is appalling.   Armory Crate is possibly the worst POS I've used in 30 years of being a PC enthusiast.  The rest of their software is not much better.  I have the Crosshair Hero AM4 board and it's fine as long as you don't use any ASUS software.
Asus is the most overrated and overhyped manufacturer on the market. Their price no longer corresponds to the quality of their products. But that hasn't just been the case since today, it's been the case for 2-3 years. They lived extremely from user hype about the brand and rested on it. Asus is no longer the market leader it used to be.
I'll not buy MSI again either. Not because of bad hardware but their terrible software.
Just threw out my second ASUS motherboard with 3 years because of failure. Dont even overclock 😕
Ummm it is federal law in the USA that if the company posts something on there own website and tell others it's "At your own risk" to install this. And it causes damage to there system that they are fully liable for that damage. "Because it's there own product." They cannot tell you it voids your warranty xD. That's illegal. The hell is ASUS thinking that saying that even with updated TOS that they aren't liable. Good luck defending that in court you can't and would lose.
I've been an Asus fan boy admittedly for years. I had maximus boards, prime boards, my son's build has a stix b450 and my prime x470 pro board finally started to show signs it needed to be replaced. Having a 5900x I wanted an x570 dark hero. I couldn't get one anywhere. I needed a board quick so the closest in spec was the MSI MEG X570s Ace Max. I ordered it and it looked great and had everything I needed. So I built it and I had the same issues with audio drops, that you had and crackling and it was system latency. It took several calls and remote assistance from focusrite for my audio interface, emails to MSI and gigabyte for my GPU and motherboard to try and fix the issue. Then on the 28th of march I think, MSI released the AGESA update for my board that addressed an FTPM issue causing latency spikes. The work around was to get a dedicated tpm module and disable bitlocker, set the bios to read the dedicated tpm module instead of the built in FTPM and all would be well. Although I could not source, neither could my retailer, a tpm chip to fit my board anywhere. So I updated the new bios and the problem was still there and I sent it back and my retailer tested it and confirmed the fault and refunded me. So I went to, Asus UK website and they showed the dark hero in stock, while waiting for my refund, I ordered the dark hero. I called Asus to make sure it was in fact in stock and they said yes, it will be with you in a couple of days. Brilliant. Came off the call and 10 minutes later I got a call back saying sorry. The warehouse has just informed me we don't have any dark heroes in stock. Oh, well do you have any x570 boards. No we don't have any what so ever so we will refund you. Great so waiting for 2 refunds, I find a Cross hair formula VIII x570 and it comes and I install it. Then my 360 copelix AIO dies with pump failure and flashes red. Ok RMA and ordered a new one and I have a copelix xt pro. So all working now and my system is beautifully stable with the 5900x at 4.75ghz all core and decent temps. What I will say is out of the box the system latency was so much better using LatencyMon to track it. The AGESA update was implemented much better than msi's but needed some tweaking to get it right down. Nvidia drivers are terrible for spikes with their drivers and believe me when I say I tried everything from core affinities, priorities, power plans, and enabling and disabling drivers, use of processor lasso, all the way to quantum timing to get my system to a point where it can handle real time audio properly. This was an AMD issue but Asus boards seem to handle it better in my experience but I completely agree with your video and justification to boycott Asus for now and they have been terrible on the new tech boards. I was thinking of buying a new x670, 7950x and upgrading my ram and would have gone Asus had I not watched yours, and Steve's videos before hand. Asus has gone down hill so much. It's great having an aesthetically pleasing motherboard but absolutely useless if it's blowing things up, catching fire. A dirty move with the beta bios. Voiding warranty to reduce rma's and people suing for other components damaged. It's drawing you in with a fix that doesn't fix and voiding your warranty at the same time relinquishing Asus from responsibility. A very dirty move! I'm glad my system is stable and working, being a previous generation but feel sorry for anyone who has had issues and is facing this fight with Asus. Very bad form indeed!
Kudos Harry Mack's father
Lol Jayz realize what i realize from 2015 , Not to buy Asus products because it sucks 😅
I've been using Asus boards in my builds for 20 years but after watching GN and now Jay's video it looks like I'll be looking for another brand. Is ASRock a solid choice?
correct me if im wrong but in my opinion it is not really the fault of asus because amd likely pressured asus to release the boards as well as the bios versions. the first bios versions were all faulty so amd as well as the community stressed asus to release a new one but they still didnt have time to properly test them. they now say that your warranty is voided if you install this new bios version and the old bios versions are no longer up to download. well, in my opinion this is exactly the right thing to do because there were major issues with the older versions and to protect the customer they said that they should not install the newer versions and instead just disable expo and wait until a proper bios is available. i still have an old asus board in use and the bios took like 5 years of updates to fix any major problems regarding some SPECIFIC cpus. this shows that it takes time to get the bios right for every chip. some of the x3d models of the 7000 series just got releases a few weeks ago (at least in my country) so what did you expect from enabling expo wich is basicly overclocking on your board? yes, you can gain a bit more performance by enabling expo but the point is that you dont have to enable it in the first place. enabling it on a system (this new) is like taking all the sliders in your bios to the max and expecting it to work. youst because you have the sliders and you can get more performance does not mean that you should. besides that the asus boards are not the only ones that have such problems. for example some gigabyte boards can also roast your cpu... maybe it would be better if asus would have waited a bit before they gave us the option to enable expo in the first place. also i do not want to offend anyone and i can understand when some of you are upset but i do not think that calling out asus in this way is the right thing nor contributes it to fixing the problem.
Thank you Jay. For a new builder, what brand would you recommend to replace Asus?
This is what happens in a Global Neo Liberal Corporate Fascism !
What is that Mega Man box in the background my boy.
Props!  In this vein, can you do a collaboration with someone like buildzoid, and find out what board manufaturer/sku is actually a decent piece of hardware. In terms of build/component quality.  That way we can have a baseline away from marketing mumbo jumbo and perceived reputational bias.
sadly this also hits the b650e boards and i currently have a b650e and i also see errors that my pc is cause by other stuff but they only appeared when i upgraded to a new mobo...
Amazon does this with products too. Funnily enough, two of my Asus B650E-I brand new boards off Amazon were used. Interesting to see how Asus operates. Makes me wonder if it’s amazon or originally Asus sending the crappy boards to Amazon.
I remember the Asus troubles with bad capacitors a while back. It wasn't pretty. I also remember the avoid Asroc at all costs era. I'm still like that with anything A-open. This is one wild turn around. Protest with your wallets. Budweiser is officially screwed because of the BS stunt they pulled.  Techs can do the very same thing but we have a hell of a lot more control over how a brand is annihilated & they know we're a bunch of savages... Don't deny it.  They were warned but spit on their consumer base... worst possible move.  Who remembers SOYO, Abit, Chaintech & many other manufacturers that were systematically killed off ?  I thought Soyo were terrific & they had cool silver boards but, until they weren't much interested in their consumer's. I wish they could have sorted thing's out but any hope has long since gone.  Hercules 3D Prophet was super cool too. The III TI was really cool but Nvidia killed them off. Damn, I'm old as dirt.
thanks for that Jay for this info.!
who do we trust and buy our computer parts from now :(  Asus - anti customer behavior Gigabyte exploding PSU ,  unhelpful towards consumer MSI - original shady in all aspects  Asrock - doesn't like reviews at all
I was once a fan boy, the P3B-F motherboard was amazing but when I went to P4P i ran into a driver issue that they never fixed. It was a common video card. I went MSI on my next build, it was the first time I put a system together that had 0 issues (I accidentally kicked a jumper off installing a header, 2-second fix but it doesn't count).
Out of all the motherboard companies, Asus has been the absolute dogshit across the board with QC. All the way from high end ROG, to WS to lower end boards, all fails and have very poor QC with notoriously bad fix-pipeline (Aka, the lack of it).  Every single Asus board that I've had, has been RMA'd. Every single of the 6 ones. All the Intel boards (those that were made with 1156), MSI and AsRock, ignoring those slight bugs in the BIOS that made some settings unstable or suddenly make the system not save them, they still have been solid and usable whereas Asus boards are just unusable due to the instability issues.  Asus Firmwares and updates are following the good old riddle:  99 little bugs in the code! 99 little bug in the code! Take one down Patch it around 256 little bugs in the code.
Regarding the memories, it seems that this problem is solved with certified memories for the AMD platform. They could be the same kitt, one Intel and the other AMD and it seems that the Intel kitt doesn't work and gives stability problems. If you switch to the same Amd certified kit, all problems miraculously disappear. We didn't have this problem on the AM4 platform but it seems that times are different now.
Ill admit ive never had an issue with asrock but ive always gone with msi really love that as a brand and honestly very stable touchwood
I have always loved ASUS and they were my go-to, but I have had NO PROBLEM boycotting companies lately
Would be nice if some of those big youtubers could make a video on what mainboard brands to buy, as I think it would help many people building a new computer like me. Right now I think I'm gonna go with gigabyte.
what is that thumbnail? why is gamers crossed out? damn dude, now it says "republic of fired" got em!
Asus has gone downhill, zero customer focus.
i'm saving up for my first pc build and just replaced all the ASUS parts on my list because of this, didn't even know this was happening
i was about to order the handheld gaming console the ROG ALLY just now then i remeberd the video of steve because of your video and now i'm like, nha i'm good thnx but no thnx
Pity. I have a Asus build at home. OK it is old. A 2nd generation Ryzen CPU and a Asus NVidia 1060 GPU, so I guess this is old enough to still be untouched with the issues. Anyway I suppose I will have to look at MSI as my next build goto.
It's a shame what's happening because I've liked Asus PC hardware for last 15 years or so. Currently my PC has an Asus motherboard and that has worked fine for last few years. I'm guessing when it will be time for me to upgrade in the future, I might have to look at other brands. I'm not super loyal to Asus by any means, but their products have been consistently good for me so there wasn't a reason to doubt them until now.
I've had a 1070 Strix, which died within the first week. Took them 6 weeks to organize the entire RMA, including me having to ship the GPU to the Czech Republic on my own cost (they just sent me an address, no actual shipping label what I would expect at an RMA on a one week old almost brand new product). They've mentioned to not put anything else into the box (by that I meant accessories), but do you know what I've received back? A completely different, beaten 1070 Strix in F_CKING bubble wrap and a cardboard box. Customer support is non-existent or absolute braindead. Yet they sell the most expensive stuff on the market. I guess they have to pay all the ads and sponsorships to keep selling their dogshit ass products. Their Aura Sync is a joke, it takes 10% CPU usage to run some LEDs? Come on, a cheap $1 eBay controller does a better job.  I already avoided them for 5 years, I guess they haven't improved since that.
Asus stock is dropping boys, get in while its low. *lol
I've had some major issues with my 7950x3d and my Asus x670e extreme. There's been times where it feels like my CPU is at 100% load and I'm running out of ram, basically my system runs super slow, but I check my usage and I'm using 8% CPU and 10% ram
Nice1, power to the Consumer! Lets do videocards next 😁
Smashed pins RMA!?! Opps I split coffee RMA! Nup. F off. And what the X that board that was RMA'd was sent out to review!?! Is there another world for Muppets?
Good on you Jay 💪Asus needs to wisen up
This proves that there are just too many brands that are TOO BIG FOR THEIR OWN GOOD!!  I think ASUS needs to break up their ego, and their "monopoly minded" way of doing things.
It seems they are doing some lean work cutting everywhere. Im right now looking for chipset drivers for my x370 prime pro and the Asus site cant even find the board. Like seriously i can google "asus X370 prime pro" and the asus support page shows up. When pressed i'm taken to Asus front page. So they basically just told me "Support? Nah AMD was too nice to have it still be a capable higher end system, with my 5800x3d, so now you're gonna have to go to 3. party sites".   Would love to have a recommended place to source my drivers from now on, as i have never tried to not have support for my hardware before.   Asus is so out, as Jay says there has been many of these high on the horse scenarios and sweeping under the rug for "brand recognition" they are simply not to be trusted. Probably hasn't for long time i feel like this is way overdue.
well i hope i never see a corsair product in your vids again. because they are evil
I never liked Asus too many useless features. Too expensive and useless.
Kudos!
This is an exceptional stand you are taking and I love it. But it will hurt your Business and it shows once more that you are a true for the customer channel. Thank you for doing this. This is not a normal thing anymore nowadays, and I applaud you for it.
Man this is very unfortunate to hear about Asus. I built my gaming rig 2 years ago around all Asus parts.
What motherboard manufacture do you think people should go for??
How the nighty have fallen.
MSI? So it has come to choosing the lesser evil... What a time to be alive...
I have had TERRIBLE life living with ASUS. I bought a Z9PE-D8 WS 600$ motherboard, after 6months of debugging and solving case with supplier, it ended up to be faulty socket after i contacted directly at asus. Received "new" one from Asus, as reseller refused to fix it and told me there is none problems in the motherboard. The one i got, was so clearly used and old. Why i did not buy used then in 1st place? Great question, i don't know.  I continue buying asus products, i buy Asus ROG Swift 1000$ 27" display. Oh man, what a terrible experience. I got all sorts of problems with it, and ended up in faulty PSU for the monitor. Went thru the hazzle and got new PSU and it happened again. This time i ask for refund. Got refunded and decided to buy ANOTHER asus display, same price category. Best specs for gaming display at the moment. Its been working to this day, but everytime i move away from my desk, display blinks. Same way like you had with your rig and it drove you nuts. The display blinks if i fire an electric lighter 1-2meters away from it. It has to be an fail in product EMC tests or something, cutting corners.  I am never going to buy an ASUS product again. NEVER!
Literally just built my PC with a 7800x3D on an Asus Motherboard and a 4090... So it seems my best steps to action is literally buying another fire alarm?
I hate that I bought an x670-P off them now, but I can only take note of this and think about it in my next build (You know, aside from remaking my build with another motherboard, which is too much of a hassle for me)
Just send me all that ASUS gear, I'll recycle it for you.
Ass-us
👊respect!
ASUS used to be known as 'the best' motherboard brand. Well, times change.
I have  had my MSI carbonx670e  board since the beginning of am5 it is quiet literally the best board I have used in a long long time same with my ASRock killer 6 z170
Put a fire under ASUS
I bough ASUS RX 6700xt for cca 585€, which should have had 100€ cashback on it, making the price go to 485€ (this was almost a year ago). Do you think their cashback claiming website worked? Nope. Tried everything for half an hour, didnt help.
On my Z790 i7 13th gen, I don't have issues like that at all xD
I remember accidentally breaking one of the fans on my then brand new GTX 980. I asked Asus for a replacement fan. And god the response "we don't sell spare parts to Europe" Really? I mean that is not a cheap GPU, and yeah I broke the fan with my finger by accident because I was checking if they were actually spinning so no warranty of course.  But no spare parts for their extravagant custom coolers they put on their GPU's?! Like a new fan at least? I even asked if I could purchase a complete new cooler then, and got the same response. "NO!"  Those GPU's also uses custom PCB's as well so you won't be able to buy any third party coolers and slap that on except maybe a waterblock. So I would have to watercool the GPU if I wanted to change the cooler. With a custom build water system. We all know what that costs and I wasn't in the mood for it. In the end I just disconnected the one broken fan and the GPU worked just fine with only two fans spinning. (as the one with a broken wing sounded like crazy)  But it was the first and last time I ever spoke to Asus Customer support, the arrogance. And actual lack of any support or even an attempt to help. I love their products but pray you never have any issues with them.
i hope LTT will also drop any work with Asus parts
Intresting that S.Y. Hsu and Samson Hu (ASUS CEOs) started in 2019, seems to align with the decline of the brand lol.
11:30 Wait, I've had these same issues with audio and USB buffering and latency/crackling on my 5950x build with an rog strix board. I've chalked it all up to bad AMD drivers, but maybe i need to try a new mobo brand first before switching to Intel...
Asus's sub brand Pegatron owns ASrock don't they?
Hey Jay, I´m watching your channel for quite a while  now, and I have not seen you often then furious about a brand like this. I was an Asus fanboy for over 15 years now. I loved the stability, reliability and the design of Auss products so much. But as you mentioned, they just took of and lost ground the last years. I´m very exited to see, to what brand the journey will go. What brand you can recommend as a replacement for Asus. Will it be MSI, Gigabyte (which I personally don´t like because of their reliability, RMA handling and customer support) or another one, that is not obvious to me now :) Great respect to you, for standing on the customer side, which I belong to. Keep up your great content. It is a plesure to whatch every single video, even if the topic is not my favorite one :) As I said, looking forward to see some motherbord vendor testings in the future on your channel.
This video has given me a lot of confidence in this channel. Already had a ton.
thanks Jay
I had to drop ASUS back when the ryzen 1 launched.  I use linux.  I early adopted ryzen and put together a system with nvme and an asus board.  I knew to expect some growing pains.  Right off the bat the CSM setting that allows you to boot non-commercial OSs in UEFI/GPT mode didn't work correctly, and it had to in order to use the nvme for some reason I don't remember now.  I didn't get mad.  I could install, but not boot.  I knew it was a software problem.  I called to report that there was an issue and see if maybe they had a dev firmware with that issue solved.  I got immediately told that they design the boards and AMD designs their processors expressly and only to run on windows technology.  I really don't know how to teach people that software development actually follows hardware development overwhelmingly, and only some provisioning is done in hardware to allow certain standards that software uses to function.  They don't seem to understand that the hardware or a hardware standard comes first, then software is developed around it for 99.8% of all instances.  I explained that I write software, and what I was asking for was not some crazy new feature, but an industry standard feature that they claimed to support.  They came back with they can't help me troubleshoot linux.  I explained that the issue was the UEFI firmware not correctly supporting an industry standard feature and I was reporting it and just trying to see if they had an update in the works yet.  It was essentially trying to force the commercial key use when booting from the nvme, but not the live image.  To top that off, if you installed to a sata ssd, the nvme drive was not visible for whatever reason.  I got hung up on.  I calmed down and called back after a few minutes.  Re-explained everything and got told after two hours of support fumbling while I tried to remain calm (the machines are my passion, probably not the support guy's thing) that all I had to do was install the drivers first, then I could install the OS....  really?  I tried (a bit sarcastically, but trying to obviously joke so he could see where the issue was) to offer the guy a fin ($5 bill) if he could show me how to install his windows drivers, without windows, on bare metal, and use them to install linux.  It was very funny, not funny, but I don't believe in being abusive to phone staff, they usually have a bad enough day 11 out of 9 times.  I've had those jobs too, once upon a time.  There was a lot more to these discussions, but yeah, I was done.  I was very upset because they were the followup to old Abit.  Been using asrock, gigabyte, and msi since.  A little more difficult to find the exact product I want, but it has gotten a lot better over the time that has passed.  I still have and use the nvme (a samsung pro device) and it works fine without any errors.  I wound up giving the machine (sans my nvme) to my wife who uses windows,  and going with a taichi.
Good thing we went MSI for our last build. Sheer luck but it's been great so far!
The contribution to consumers knowledge and right is huge here, huge Kudos Jay! Can't wait for ASUS response to it, I'll probably won't buy another ASUS product(Z97 and X570 worked perfectly and now X670E F).
Wow. I've been a diehard Asus mobo for life and if you convinced me to switch then wow they are gonna feel this video
Thanks for standing up for the consumers!
This is easy for me: NO LONGER ASUS products of any kind in my portfolio from now on. There are others that can deliver the same or even more quality products at even at a low price, none is perfect but ASUS just F*CKed the client intentionally. Lenovo (for laptops), Asrock, Gigabyte, MSI for anything else is the way to go for me and I am happy with this decision! This is permanently not just for a week or year! ASUS F*CK YOU!
my asus X540LA literally quit for no reason got it from asus directly took it to a shop they checked it out for free said everything inside is bad faulty or fried kinda sucks since motherboard fried
With EVGA no longer making video cards, and this ASUS drama, I dont know what to do when i build my next PC :( both those were staples in my last builds
in da bin. everyone is has wasted too much time on them
When I upgraded to my Ryzen 5800X I went for an ASUS Prime X570 motherboard. After a few months I had nothing but stability problems, boot errors and issues with USB devices connecting, to the point I had to pull it out of my custom loop PC & RMA it. I swapped out for a Gigabyte B550 board, been running flawlessly (touch wood) for about 18 months now. Between that and the USB issues I'd had with my previous ASUS Maximus Impact VII motherboard, following these videos from Jay and GN I won't be touching any ASUS boards ever again.
My trust in asus went out the door when i rma'd my 360hz rog screen 2 times and they could not fix the issue of the panel flickering over and over. the QA is terrible and the support is a nightmare. definitely never going with them again for a screen... and now no motherboards. Great video Jay
Tried telling you Asus is garbage and you shouldn't shill for them for years.
Soooo they released a bad product and then they released an unsupported fix that will void your warranty so in the likely event that your product fails, they can legally tell you to sod off? Wow! I always held Asus in high regard but I won't be buying anything of them in the future. Thanks for the warning!
Modern management happened, it's all over the place these days.
Well time to boycott Asus and acknowledge that ROG now stands for Recycle Only Garbage. Hopefully in a few years they turn themselves around and earn back the respect they once had.
i have the asrock x670e steel legend with a 7800x3d and a cl30 6000 32gb kit. Runs amazing, no problems at all
Bye bye asus. Idiots.
good, let the coprofags unfold xD
I wonder how AMD's X3D sales have been effected by your negativity towards them.... I bet AMD adore influences tarnishing them for other companies practises.
Asus sent my rtx 3070 rma back as an rx 580 less than half the speed and value. Without my approval. Then refused to fix the issue or accept the rx 580 back. At first they denied they did this. Then they stated it was comparable and intentional. Horrible company, I'm done.
Uh boy. Thanks Jay. I really appreciate this video. Asus is going  down the tubes. I'm still processing this.
Ive been saying this the last few years that ASUS's quality has gone way downhill, but I was ignored because of Asus's strong marketing image, the one especially built from their efforts during the early 2010s with the tech media
message to ASUS you have lost me as a potential customer,
I rarely leave comments, but this time I felt compelled to share my thoughts.  For over a decade, I've relied exclusively on Asus motherboards due to their unparalleled stability and exceptional build quality. In the past, I experimented with Gigabyte and MSI motherboards, only to be disappointed by their performance and eventual failure. However, my faith in Asus is beginning to waver.  Recently, I invested approximately 4000 Euros in new parts, including an Asus Crosshair 670e Extreme motherboard, primarily for its integrated 10Gbit network. I paired it with a 7950x3D CPU, my first x3D CPU ever. I was incredibly thrilled and even stood in line on launch day, making me one of the first in Sweden to own it. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from satisfactory. Since day one, I have encountered numerous issues with this setup, and I am on the verge of replacing the motherboard to determine if the problem lies with Asus. While I understand that being an early adopter comes with risks, the extent of the problems I've faced is extraordinary, especially considering my history with high-end systems. Random BSODs and overall instability plague my system, although it has improved slightly with the 1410 bios, which, incidentally, has invalidated my warranty. Fortunately, Swedish consumer rights laws are robust, and I doubt I will encounter any difficulties returning the board to my local retailer, Webhallen.  This whole situation has piqued my curiosity. I have followed your channel since its inception and have often relied on your recommendations for my builds because they have proven to be reliable. As an enthusiast who always seeks the absolute best regardless of cost, I implore you to delve deeper into this issue instead of resorting to an easy fix by switching to Intel. I urge you to try a different motherboard at home for a while and observe if it improves your situation. I am genuinely intrigued!  Furthermore, I have concerns about a less apparent issue: CPU degradation. I manually set my SOC voltage to 1.2V and have fine-tuned my system to achieve stable performance, now with EXPO enabled. However, I worry if this bios issues have the potential to cause long-term damage to my CPU, which may not be immediately noticeable but could manifest one or two years from now, possibly after the warranty has expired. I've noticed that my boost frequencies have suffered and may be lower than what should be considered normal for a 7950x3D CPU. What would you consider a typical boost frequency for this CPU model?
Good to know.
Lol, if GN hadn't made their video drawing a line in the sand he'd have continued to suckle at the teat of ASUS forever. This is a calculated PR decision and nothing else, all these dorks in the comments saying how brave and wonderful this is are complete muppets 😂
Damn! I just bought ASUS ROG STRIX PSU 750W Gole full modular... 😂😂😂
Thank you for this. I am in the market for a new laptop and was anxiously awaiting the release of the ProArt Studiobook 16X. But no freaking way I am gambling several thousands of Euros on a product of a company that treats its consumers and products this way.
I have an MSI B550 UNIFY in my AM4 system and it's been solid, I am really glad I didin't get any ASUS garbage.
I refused to buy a Asus board since 2012 where the drivers had a serious hard drive issue. The pc would crash EVERY single time when a drive cameout of sleep and i have 5 drives in my rig for backup and so on so it was unusable or i had to disable sleep and wear out my hard drives, raise my energy bills and worse sit in a loud af room. I ended up learning to write register keys and much more and made a fix myself. I even send it to asus and they did NOT intergrate it into drivers so the next board had the same... But for 9 months straight my pc crashed when a drive came out of sleep when i was trying to figure it out. Asus gave ZERO help.
scummy bastards, i wont be buying from them again, how the hell is it legal to seel a product yet refuse to warranty it when  its being used as intended?
Subscribed. Been watching your content for a few weeks now mate , great stuff. Your no bullshit approach has made me a fan.
And another one down and another one down, another bites the dust ... After Gigabyte and MSI now ASUS as a brand in the penalty box for me. Not planning to upgrade my system soon, luckily. Thanks for also sharing this Jay.
Wow, what the heck is going on at Asus 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I have a TUF GAMING B650-PLUS with a ryzen 7700x and boy, it has given me problems since i bought it back in march. Usually it was the ram not letting my pc boot but the worst offender was when i tried to add a second nvme drive and suddenly the pc want able to boot properly, i did a lot of testing with other MB GPUS etc but for whatever reason when the computer is unplugged to the wall or the option to give power to usb devices when the pc is turned off it wont boot and i would have to reset the BIOS. Its so werid because it was working fine before, idk if it is an asus problem(although some people have reported simillar issues when trying to boot) or an AM5 problem. I am hoping a BIOS update will fix my issue eventually and if not i might have to get a new MB and i don't really want to sped all that extra money.
Republic of Garbage
Whoaw ok... So now I know why my local shop is doing an Asus gaming pc promotion thing... They are just as scummy and just want to get rid of their inventory... Fuck me... are there still honest ppl out there in this F'd up world, other than these type of channels?
Kinda makes you wonder how many class action lawsuits are gonna spin up from this debacle!
In terms of corporate shit. I am from Romania. Eastern Europe. Minimum salary is 300$. So we are a poor country. And as a result, between 2010 and 2018 you could not buy an Asus product. They made Easter Europe versions that were cheaper, but they were also shit. And not only PC Hardware, my experience is with laptops. I fix PC and laptops as a side gig, and I had a two guys come in with a ROG laptop. Both had the same model, with the exception that one had been bought via Amazon US, and the other sourced locally. Serial number on the local one was recognised by Asus, so it was not a fake. There were PHISICAL DIFFERENCES ON THE MAINBOARD. CAPS MISSING. THERMAL PADS MISSING. The gpu had half of the memory chips. And the cooling sistem had one heatpipe less. I never recomanded Asus in Romania, I was starting to regain trust in them since they discontinued the Eastern Eu line and their products finally seemed like quality, but... Now I'm at 0 again.
And Linus is telling people to run out and buy the new asus hand held 😂
I find this funny.. for years I've been informing these channels on how APOS is not actually honest about their BIOS, their testing and how they hide things from their website...  None of it was ever checked, followed up or even remotely addressed...   It takes them fumbling the writing and wording of their always poorly translated information for these guys to wake up... Sorry Jay, but come on... They literally killed my 3990x cpu with their poor and official BIOS support and still nothing of interest. Yet, now the more popular cpu's take a stage... These issues have been around for a while, they don't test and they have unstable voltage control (guess how I found out where my issues were...). This all is part on you as well (you as in all of you tech-YT), you had years to respond and be awake way earlier.
Wow I considered buying RoG laptop I'm glad I get Legion instead. To tell the truth I got many problems with Asus parts over the years and I never trusted this brand at all but aesthetics of RoG laptops are sick imo. Uff glad I didn't step on landmine.
I almost bought their new OLED 27" - now - fuck em, I wait until another brand sells something similar
Huge respect !  Always have been buying Asus but I’m done now as well…. Hate the big corp arrogance…
Mine a is an ASUS B450 board, and I had problems with that for ages, and to fix it in the end, I had to manually undervolt the CPU because it was 1.41v by default.  I'm now thinking that may have been something similar to this issue.
I have an asrock board for x99 (haswell-e 5920K to 5960X) and it's been, well just working. No weird programs like the dumpster fire of armoury crate, it's just a desktop computer with no bullcrap. I really miss those days. I DO NOT like my Maximus Hero Wifi for a 9900K, I'm NEVER going to install AC, in fact I tried to update Aura and it wanted to change what kid of program it was so I grabbed an old copy again, just use the drivers and iCue took over for the lights. GPU Fans are on auto and monitored by afterburner. This is my ideal setup and I hate the mobo for needing extra crap and my 3080Ti is a TUF as well and I'm really not liking it for a card in its class either. While I haven't gotten any errors or issues as a result of the hardware like today's worst issues, I sure wouldn't be surprised if it dies early compared to other machines, the usb connectors have never worked right unless usb-c isn't supposed to be able to power any devices that are plugged in, making it useless; usb3x2 or whatever, the red plugs, also act weird and slow and I'm only using them for 2.0 sockets. BUT I don't have a lot of peripherals that need more than a 3.0 speed where i just use the front headers when I need them. I had some AWESOME asus boards growing up including a p5q pro turbo with a Q9550 inside. That thing was a BEAST for its time and I loved the look. Another asus board (p5n32 sli se deluxe?) let me OC a e6600 from 2.4Ghz to 3.6GHz (50% increase!) all day every day never getting too warm or unstable. It JUST worked until I needed to replace it with something faster. I guess it's MSI's are Gigabyte's turn? Gigabyte had a rough start and used to be my least favorite brand and MSI is well, shitty for sending all those gpu's straight to miners (like that wasn't happening EVERYWHERE though) but they make the program we all use for the gpu's so, maybe it's time to give them a try.
I have a ASUS ROG STRIX X570-F GAMING motherboard which has been fine... but the ASUS Armory Crate software is rubbish, and was so in a previous motherboard too. This is despite the software shortcomings being well known, even on ASUS own website.
WOW!!!! THAT DID IT! Asus can kiss my Michigan ass! (I'm being respectful crybaby YouTube)
Techtubers likeJay and Steve have greatly influenced the brands that I buy; and they still do with displays of integrity and transparency like this. My current mobo is the Maximus X Hero which I used for my current build... which is over 5 years old. I'm due for an upgrade soon, and guess what? not looking at an Asus board anymore. And i bet I'm not the only one who thinks this way.
Rip asus.
I have had ASRock boards since fx 6300 era through few intel platforms and nevr had any single problem. 24/7 stability... Then i had asus b550m tuf that died after few months.... Next will be AsRock again...
Hahahahaha Asus was doing this shit with me at Tom's Hardware like a dozen years ago.
everyone makes mistakes, but this situation is not a mistake, it's an example of what happens when a fundamentally scummy company gets outed as the scummy company they are, by a situation they caused themselves.
I've used ASUS mobos for 25 years now without fail, my last build was in 2017 with a GENE VIII that has been rock solid as the others. But with AM4 and now AM5 esp, my confidence is shattered and I will not be picking ASUS going forward for my new AM5 build.
Just dont buy asus
Asus has always made shit AMD products them blame someone .
Thx for your support Jay. But ASUS opened the box of pandora at this point. AMD has to crack down on that and force them to send their boards to them for validation testing because they are obviously unable to. And I also wonder it at stops at AMD , I would not be surprised if Intel also starts to give them a closer look. Cause in the end the user is gonna say it's AMD/Intel fault and to be fair there is some truth to that.
From now on Jay's only relation with Asus is going to be Asus chords on the guitar.
Never buying another asus product if the quality is gonna be shit!👍
Massive respect for this! Most people fold when money is involved so this is the strongest message you could have sent.
Hi Jay, not trying to defend ASUS but from my experience, I had the same USB issues like you with my MSI board on Threadripper. That's the AMD curse. But it doesn't excuse all other issues, especially how ASUS handles warranty.
Congrats Jay, this speaks volumes about your integrity and character.
I understand you Jay , I also was a "I put my hand on fire" for Asus (Asustek) , and I am so disappointed with them for the last 3 to 4 years , that I decided to stop buying hardware . And Jay (at 16:17) , they are high on the PegAsus , not horse 😁 , so like Icarus , they went to close to the sun ,burn the wings and they going down on a spiral .  I really hope they go back to be the reference for quality and reliability , transparence , good relations with the costumers , and drop the awful misleading selling tactics , I will wait until 15th generation intel if I have to 😅
Money, that's the long and short of it. I used to work for a company that makes TV's, Many times TV's were knowingly shipped with faults, because, according to the company, it was cheaper to handle the inevitable returns of those who could be bothered, than to sort the issues during production. Their thinking is that most people can't be bothered with the hassle, so why fix a TV that the owner wouldn't bother with.
Stopped using Asus for my new build back in 2019 for my AMD build due to issues with previous hardware and USB craziness so I switched to Gigabyte MB mainly cos the GPU was Gigabyte. the board and GPU were solid but XMP support has been a bit flaky for sticks off the QVL which is disappointing and the BOIS could be better next time I and feeling like going for MSI as their boards seem to be super solid these days with excellent performance especially for XMP/EXPO support
They don't care anyway, just about means you don't get the Asus ROG Ally to test. They'll find someone like Linus to do the ad for it. Asus is meh these days. When I see that company, I'd rather buy something else.
Good on you Jay, was planning on buying a super high end Asus board in the next month but will get a different brand
Get Em Jay I would like a follow up to this video if they reach out to you about this video. Reminds me of MSI’s debacle 2/3 years ago
Leider nötig, Danke.
Dang that sucks! Love asus too and been a fan… that’s good to know, much respect jay! Thanks for the content! Now I gotta do a rebuild on my pc! ✌🏻😅
I will be sure to not look at ASUS when buying hardware to a new PC. Nice to see taking a stance and based in reality, can also be done by people who make a living on reviewing products.
It’s obvious thier customer service will screw the customer down but they are very very good at putting a blind fold over their flaws
Since  switched to a b450 mobo from asus during the time 2600x was new gen. The first mobo came in so broken the rgb worked, but the system would not even try to start no sounds nada. Got a rma, that one works still, but im 100% sure it has had a faulty ram slot since the start. Already decided before all this to abandon the nice design of asus. Already did with a new non asus gpu.
Picked up a ROG X670E Gene for black Friday, no audio, getting an RMA has been a nightmare. "We don't have any in stock, you can try and check again in 10-14 days". They can't manage getting an advanced replacement RMA if they have internal stock issues, it's on the customer to keep checking back to check stock... thanks ASUS, that's awesome customer support.
i got a rog x790 and the xmp would not work,i had to geta bios from them  it still did not work, i RMA to new egg and got a MSI tomahawk and not more problems.
14:00 wisdom
To be honest this trend with ASUS is visible for quite a while. Solid move to act on them, Jay!
if this is the second time for something like this, what was the first brand to go?
GamersNexus - a deep dive in investigative journalism  JayzTwoCents - ASUS sucks! Jokes aside: if ASUS send crap like this out to a YouTuber, imagine what the everyday consumer will get.
Asus is done it’s just going to take a while. When they start putting more time and effort into their legal statements then they do on fixing their problems it’s over. When companies like this that think they are too big to fail get into these death spirals they don’t change until after they’ve gone splat. After that and usually everyone being fired and tossed out with their millions of dollars exit bonuses for destroying the company maybe someone can come in an pick up the pieces.
I haven't used asus since the x99 days. I had a board I tried RMAing 3 times and they kept sending it back with no fault found. After it finally fried my 6900k they finally replaced it. Then the replacement starting showing the same fault and I retired that board and refrained from using asus since. Before that I mainly bought asus.
When they don't sponsor you
Funny coincidence, I went with Asus Z170a with my Intel i7 6700k upgrade many years ago. I've never had a great experience with that board, but not enough that I ever ripped it out and RMA'd it. I just upgraded last April, went with AMD and Asrock, and its been solid.
~15 years ago i had some quality problems with some asus motherboards and i had decided back than that i wouldn't buy asus hardware  for some time and since then i had various motherboards by different brands not named asus .... but after 15 years and having a tempting voucher for asus i sadly decided to give them a new chance just to be (literally) burned again by them 1 month after the purchase ... so now i can say for sure that whatever happens i will never buy anything asus brand related in the future again, not for personal nor for professional usage.
Oh my 😳😳
Sheesh I hope my system holds together. I've got a 13700k in a TUF Z790, and a TUF 3070ti in a system that isn't even two months old. Fingers crossed and knock on wood. Best of luck to those of you getting screwed around by this AMD mess.
I've been having nothing but issues with 1st and 2nd gen Ryzen with Msi's B350M Mortal platform, killed 2 cpu's, 4 sticks of ram, a few drives and a PSU. I'm not a fan of them, or their absolutely shithouse software that accompanies their cheaper boards.
Despite having an Asus X570 in my build right now. I've never had issues with their boards in the past at all but this will be the last baord I will have. Next I will go to Asrock, even though its always been known to me as the cheap brand that doesn't make quality but it's obvious to see they've been upping their game so much the past half a decade.
I used to be a huge Asus Rog fan but after what I'm seeing not only won't I buy Asus any more I'm going to go with MSI for my next PC build.
Really appreciate what you are doing since a long time. Same here, with just a few exceptions I always used ASUS boards since 2 decades - sometimes Gigabyte. The only mainboard I ever saw failing completely was an ASRock. So... Lately I went with MSI MAG Edge for an Intel system, but I don't like their BIOS - just too much used to the ASUS ones. So I got me an ASUS TUF X760E plus for my brand new AMD R7 7800X3D. Well, and just after completing the build the burning and exploding issues went viral. First time since years I switched from INTEL to AMD. Great. So I updated the BIOS to the last stable version there is (said to be fixing the SOC power issue) and until now avoiding (as always) the Beta BIOSes. Did some tweaking concerning the memory context etc. in order to get rid of the long boot times which worked until now. Since then I have a srable system running on EXPO 1. Temps not above 82°C with air cooling on 100% load, mostly around 62-65° when gaming (Flightsimulator). So I'm quite satisfied but actually still worried, if I should change the board (and brand) for security reasons. Honestly II doubt other vendors will have a different policy when it comes to guarantee with Beta BIOS. I just randomly checked on the MSI page the latest BIOS for MSI MAG X670E Tomahawk. Guess what!? They have a Beta BIOS as well, and it looks like it's even older than the ASUS ones I see on their page. Did not check Gigabyte as I did not see a comparable mainboard with "E"-chipset there. So still not sure what to do.
My Z690-I Strix is borderline a paperweight because of the latest bios update. My 4090 refuses to display unless I hit the reset button on my case, then it boots perfectly normal. There is no amount of cmos clears, bios reflashes, firmware updates and windows reinstalls that fixes it. If only I could downgrade back to an earlier bios but no, they don't allow that on the latest bios revision.
"...but you don't care."  That was the PERFECT way to end that video and I believe you're 100% true in that statement.
I'm glad it finally caught up. Asus support was absolutely rubbish even 10 years ago. Never ever bought another Asus product again.
I have major issues with ROG X570-E Gaming random crashes and BSOD's, replaced everything except CPU (3900X) and Motherboard. With recent news I expect the motherboard :(. Darn, thinking buying a less budget board would give you less headache, not more.
I'm willing to bet 1 in 10 boards are sent out with faults from manufacture
Running with ASUS for numerous builds for years for myself daughter and my father I am currently running a ASUS Maximus Code Z370 with a i7 8700k and my daughters current build is a Z370 Maximus IX Hero Wi FI - AC with a i7 8700 Just got parts on hand for a new build for my daughter for a ASUS Z690-E ROG Strix with a 13600 k and I was kinda impressed enough to buy the same MOBO for myself. I was planin on doing her build this weekend when she left to go to her moms for the week . But now seeing this has me wondering if i should just return the MOBO and possibly try for another brand at this point?   I know things are mainly happening with AMD with ASUS but what is not to say this could happen with Intel as well on ASUS support for its customers? I still have a couple of days to decide for myself but honestly i dont know what i want to do at this point if i should continue supporting ASUS or not. Yes i do agree with Jay mentioned before aesthetic looks nice but thats about it, i feel that i got more features on my Z370 MOBO than what they offer now and at the price of what they are charging now with the service is what got me rethinking finally now.
Integrity...without it you ain't s**t.  Thank you. 15 years since my last build and the first thing I did was go after Asus parts until this article. Again, thank you
When I build my new 13th series desktop I was like "I love my Asus P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3 motherboard I want ASUS motherboard now too" and when I started searching they were offering same or less form much more $ than MSI or Gigabyte... And this was my nope point.
ASUS was A_Sussy_Baka after all...
Content like this should be championed and make companies pay attention to what they are do. Vote with your wallets people. If they are giving you crap, send it back and dont buy their shit.
Respect!
I recently upgraded my PC from 2018 which had an ASUS ROG Strix board. I have no particular brand loyalties although I had a shocking experience for Gigabyte in 2018. Prior to my purchases of my computer components I scanned all merchant websites, Reddit and forums for reviews and experience with ASUS and other products including intel and AMD (my previous system was AMD). I slowly noticed a pattern as Jay pointed out there: DOA boards, used boards sent to customers instead of new within 30 day period, reversed capacitors, missing components. Hence I pulled the trigger on an MSI board and an intel system (also noticed some issues with AMD using same analysis).   My advice is: Do not have a brand loyalty also if something worked for you before check if they have been consistent since last time you used them. Remember most of us have an upgrade cycle 3-5 years and a lot can change in that time.
Their RMA customer experience is awful, utterly awful.
Well this explains why I'm getting problems with my pc, my ASUS board also came to me faulty so there's that
It seems  to me a lot of new procuct are poorly assambled nowadays
@10:12 the ad placement in this section was great 🤣
Yessssss, F U ASUS! Get rekt.
Couldn’t agree more on Asrock, zero problem with my X670E Pro RS and 7800X3D since day one 😊
I got my Wife a Asus Zenbook 1 year ago, and I have to say I will never buy Asus again, nothing but trouble, blue screens, and the battery get's extremly hot, sometimes it doesn't charge at all. It is a pitty as the Zenbook is really light weight, and fast.
So basically what they need to do is take the majority of their budget away from their cringy unnecessary marketing department, and put it into R&D and QC.  I never understood why a company  ever thinks it's in their best interest to NOT be extremely generous (go above and beyond) in their customer service. Seems like a symptom of short-term instant gratification profit making mindset versus the long haul that will reward far greater at the end.
ASUS is a POS. All crosshair mobos i've tried push insane voltages to the CPU. I had several AM4 CPU silicon DEGRADED at the point they can't run stable at default clocks!
No bag?
Props to you Jay, Haven't we heard this story before with the likes of Intel and now Ngreedia. Ripping people off creaming the cash and giving less in return only leads to bad customer relations and failure. Good riddance Asus.
My Asus X570 E motherboard has been having issues with stability, even with latest bios. I'm thinking of buying a MSI board to replace it with. Thought about buying the Dark hero board but I may pass up on ASUS In the future
"brands are smashing the pins themselves" - Jayz, 2023
I will be PMing you the address to send all of your ASUS products to.
My Asus x570e 5900x build was solid, no issues at all. Though with the recent issues i avoided Asus and went with MSI for my new 7800x3d build, seems there are some bugs with the AM5 platform but i expect them to get ironed out. Sad when companies get high and mighty and forget where they came form and who provides them their success!.
Man I have had so many asus products and until recently, very few issues. I was thinking I was in a streak of bad luck with them refusing to RMA a dead board, unrelated to this to be clear. Guess it’s time to rethink who I’ll be buying my stuff from going forwards.
So Asus bascially became the arrogant Sony from years ago :D
well, i already cant afford one, now i just deleted all my asus motherboards from the cart for future updates, thanks a lot from italy, watched  your and steve video, totally no sense, how people can pay 700 for a motherboard and if you upgrade it to solve a problem you lost warranty...They cannot understand there is a lot of people out there, saving for years to get one...yes im one of them....SAD
rip asus, they got ccp'd
This is exactly why I don't feel comfortable using MSI now that I'm finally into building pcs. Back when I had my first gaming laptop in 2016 it wouldn't let me log into the system, and after contacting their support they just told me to update to whatever BIOS they said at the time. No guide, no help considering I had no idea what they were talking about. I even mentioned I didn't understand and could I get some help to guide me through it. They just reinforced the fact that I had to update the BIOS myself... however, if something went wrong it would void my warranty. Long story short, I lost all my stuff on that pc and I've never looked at their products since.
Hey Jay, we are CUSTOMERS not CONSUMERS. FFS.
That's tough. I just bought a new Asus gaming laptop.
When ASRock as surpassed its creator, you know something is going wrong with Asus.
First EVGA, now Asus off my preferred vendors list... This has not been a good year for my hardware choices.
it's a shame asus was my go to motherboard manufacture, still have a P7P55D PRO and a PRIME X570 PRO working just fine for years... will have to do some serious research on my next builds
5:16  oh we’ll go away alright. “For those who dare” showing its true colours lately
Stuff like this will probably get some attention. Good on Jay for keeping it real.
A laptop of mine kept on degrading in performance to the most sluggish, unusable thing imaginable. I'm not exaggerating, I mean it ran like a Windows 98 computer riddled with viruses.   My brother has a degree in computer science and I know a fair bit myself. We did everything we could that didn't void warranty to try and diagnose and fix the problem. I was at university at the time (in halls) so it took a very long time and it was extremely inconvenient. The best solution was to format and start over, but you had about a week before it would degrade back again. Edit: Oh I forgot to mention that the week window of "it runs better" got smaller and smaller over time. It worked as it should the first day and then got worse and worse the following days, but eventually it was it ran as it should the first hour and then got worse and worse.  Once I got home, I contacted ASUS for RMA and I told them we think its the motherboard. I told them everything we did to diagnose and try and fix the problem, and I told them how many times I had formatted the laptop.   So it went into RMA and it came back... and degraded back again. All they did was format.   I complained again, telling them the issue won't be fixed with a format and expressed how many times we had done that. It was took into RMA and formatted and returned.   I complained again and it was took into RMA, formatted and returned.   It was absolutely ridiculous. All they had to do was replace the motherboard and test it. Even if we were wrong and it wasn't the motherboard (unlikely), they should have done some part swapping at that point  In the end I got a refund.
Was on the verge of upgrading to an all Asus AM5 rig now I don't know where to go had a few hickups with msi a few years ago might try it out again otherwise ASRock or Gigabyte...
Mate,  good work.  It's great how yourself and Gamers Nexus are looking out for us little guys. Cheers from Australia
Way to go! Bye Asus o/
That's what we can call integrity.
That is such a shame for ASUS. I have been a fan of them for many years and always looked to there products first. Might be a time to start trying other brands!
Sadly this is why I'm not interested in hardware in building PCs nowadays. The pandemic, huge profits and supply constrains took their minds away.  The prices are insane across the board and the quality has gone to the toilet. Why should I spend even MORE of my hard earned money on shit quality products? These manufacturers don't give a crap anymore, why should I?
Gee i wonder if Asus went "WOKE", cuz they sure seem to want to go BROKE.
That warranty voiding is going to get Asus into trouble in several countries.
I was sure to buy the ROG Ally on launch. Now I'll just wait a few months, might drop it entirely.
I put an older "limited edition " ASRock AQUA mobo into my PC for a water cooled build as I didnt want to spend 250% more on the ASUS mobo. I had a mishap where i bought a cheap USB 2 adapter to route my Corsir Commander Pro's, next minute my rig was on fire with smoke coming out. My PC still runs just fine even after a small "fire" incident. I might just get ASrock for my next build - without the fire! :) Sad, because I been an ASUS fanboi till today. Looks like time to change the build round next time, drop ASUS and go with the other brands. So far ASRock is fireproof IMO :)
Sob. I literally just went for the Z970 Tuf wifi plus mobo for my office build. Hopefully nothing bad happens.
My last Asus experiance was horrible too. I got a 3080 Strix card a while back, and the card was behaving wierd out of the box. I made a video showing the symptoms and RMA-ed the card (all I did was take card out of the box and put it insiede the PC. Once.) After weeks of waiting I got the response that the RMA was declined because the card is damaged mechanicly. They diagnosed a damaged PCB. They send it back. The problem was that the damage was INSIDE the card and I never even unscrewed it. Did send the card to the local repair specialist, he fixed it in 24h, he said that it was savaged inside, some signs of soldering and stuff, he basicly reverted the damage. I made photos, and called RMA again. They said my fixing guy did this, because the card was not repaired by them. For me it looks like they took the card, diagnosed the problem, tried to fix it but failed or even made it worse, and than said there is mechanical dmg and nothing they can do. That was my last experiance with Asus. Ever. No matter what.
Big thanks J
I received an Asus 4080 strix OC that was obviously returned by another customer. How do I know? Because it didn't have the protective film anymore and it had slight scratches. I literally filmed myself unboxing it and breaking the seal, so it wasn't the store that sold it that way. They got it that way from ASUS.  Film. Your. Unboxing.
I've used Asus for decades. This is mind-blowingly stupid!!! So happy I stayed on AM4 and didn't jump on AM5 right away.
Dude, I just got my TUF Gaming 3060. I'm afraid of something happening to it or my build.
Asus is good, it's AMD that sucks the squared reality upscaling the bitrate ratio mathing problems, especially without that heavily advertised worldwide support and the neighbours laughing at your slower connection giving your GPU zero likes...
Sh[STUFF] like this is why I trust this channel and it's info.  I already didn't like ASUS because it's tryhard ROG branding stuff always rubbed me the wrong way, but with me looking at parting out a new system in the near future, this gives me extra confidence that the way I am / have been voting with my wallet is right.
1:15 That overdub... You did say "keep your shit" didn't you? 🤣
I have just replaced my rog sticx x670e-e with x670e aurus master.
Asus not having a part in the channel moving forward?  I guess that means no Ausus Ally review then. What a shame.
WOW. FYI , in Hebrew , Horse = SUS ( SOOS) . Asus was a working horse in the 90's 486/Pentium era while Abit were THE OC'ers dream ( and Epoch etc). So Asus went from being a working horse to racing horse ( innovation that started with EEE PC)  to.. ?
watching this in an Asus zenbook .. lol. Hopefully  no problems.
Was considering getting an ASUS gpu, that's not happening anymore
Thats why your channel and Steve's GN one are in my top list ones! Thank you and the team behind you!
Oh Asus, I'm avoiding them for nearly twenty years since I bought an ATI (yes, not AMD yet) Radeon card from them and it only worked with the included driver and not with the official ATI drivers, because the card reported itself as an ASUS ATI Radeon whatever and not just ATI Radeon so the official ATI drivers couldn't find the card. Of course asus never updated the driver so steam complained about out dated driver from the day I bought the card.
I said Jays Word for over 1 years in germany.
you forgot about Asus Armory Crate, talk about garbage software, i think it has like 10 processes active at all times, i dont even understand for what, for such a tiny thing 1 is more then enough, it has to be one of the worst softwares i have ever seen, at least it works but it feels like 20 diffrent software teams worked on it and its some sort of unholy zombie put togheter by 20 diffrent body parts
I have enjoyed your usage and content of ASUS!! and I am sad that you have decided to do this, but I do understand why, and completely respect you for it. You did a white Gundam build from ROG and I absolutely fell in love with it!! but when I went shopping I learned that the Gundam was a bit out of my price range. Then I saw you do the Lian Li Dynamic case as well as the HYTE case, well I got the idea of doing a white build in the Lian Li case. got the case, bought the white fans and a white AIO. Got a Ryzen 7 5800x, and have gottne stuck since there.  The CPU is currently stuck in a B450-F and I was trying to find a white ASUS ROG board but have hit a road block. And my ROG 1660ti, I want to upgrade to 30 series in White but again have a road block. If you have any suggestions that arent too hard on the pocket book I would love to hear from you. Or if your clearing out some of the old stuff of ASUS ROG stuff I would love to hear from you as well. I am in Canada BTW.  But again I am sad to hear your frustrations, and I will miss seeing ASUS Rog on your channel, BUT I will be still be subbed and constantly watching. Thank You Jay and everyone for all that you do, and Thank You for sticking up for the little guys like myself and many others!!!!
Not just hardware... but sketchy backdoor filled firmware for their routers that launch, released and sold to a customer with known firmware security breaches... I took my ac5300 offline due to possible risk, bought a ax series and immediately returned when I realized my WHOLE network kept becoming filled with malware due to their router in the first place. Currently on my bench waiting for homelab tests I'm gearing to setup.   They alone sent me down the path of IT.... thanks for being so sketchy I had to adapt ASUS. Won't buy again and I have a very large amount of asus tech. Screens, MB, gpus,  CASES, LAPTOPS...goes on...I'm done now....  Open-source all the way where I can. If I can't, it gets strictly monitored and updated with scrutiny... again, thanks Asus... I gained a career...because of paranoia due to assuming all business are as bad as you...  Even sent back my lucky find for a 4080 at the time of change. My 1080ti strix has worked fine, I'll sell it for a different brand.
Now this is a true channel for consumers, not selling out for large brands. Great job man!
Happy i got my B550 tomahawk 2 year or so ago with 5600x and a cheap second hand gpu never had a problem. Also planning to buy a 6800xt soon i have small concern about my 750 watt psu though pc part picker says its around 500 watt but everyone says i have to get a 850 watt psu ?
I'm a full Asus system from case to gpu, cooler and all 😢 zen2 gen guess we changing it next rebuild
I recently bought the Asus B760-I board and upon examining the board i noticed two things: 1. In the middle of system memory slot 1 there was something looking odd. Like a dirty or bend pin (it was hard to tell as it was so tiny). 2. The front slot cover for the M2 slot has three screw holes and the screw in the middle was missing.  Everything else was sealed and looked fine. I just continued with the build and in the end all worked out fine. It did worry me for a bit.
Why is it when I go out and buy my first pc built in years, i end up buying from the one company that's going down the shit pipe.
Man, can't believe the company I'm biased about for the last year is this awful Good thing I have alternative vendors if asus's product is too expensive or lack the features I want Bye Asus
What happend to T. Hawk build? :)
Clap
Its the worst case scenario the hero worked, but not properly so it's the most frustrating in terms of trouble shooting. Whilst being the most expensive computer I've ever seen.
I just got a new ASUS B550M 😢😢😢  Bro I can't afford being fkd, parts here cost almost double 😢😢
Wish I had seen this a month ago. I just replaced my old MSI board.
Damn, ASUS was my TOP brand, my number 1. I always bought ASUS GPU and mobo. So what brand is good now? Gigabyte is a NO for me, now ASUS is "gone", MSI, any problem with MSI, except with their water coolers????
Yeah been buying asus gpu`s and mb`s for a while, and my first burn with asus was with the 24 monitor VG24QE that gave me and many others eye strain. I dumped that monitor and went with benq monitors and my eyes like them.   But i also feel like asus started to overcharge for the new mb`S and gpu`S with the strix brand. Like their rtx 4080/90`s strix costing a alot vs other brands or even the nvidia Fe. I remember when i bought my asus gtx 1080 strix it was like only 100$ more then nvidia Fe, but now they charge like 300-350$ for their strix cards vs the msrp of rtx 4000.
I was hoping you'd pick up this story from Steve. Thank you Jay, got our backs.
Dont deal with a sus company! (pun intended) Picked up an ASRock RX 6600 XT, for the price I'd say it's a pretty solid 8GB card, they really have stepped up their game in recent years
I'm hopefully upgrading my MB and CPU later this year and after watching the Gamer Nexus video(s) and this one I know what brand I won't be touching ...
Had i9 9900k with gigabyte motherboard which was bad. So just upgraded to 7800x3d and did go with b650 ASUS Wi-Fi plus arrived just as this issue broke out so sent it back got MSI have had 0 issues with it. As Jay says looks like Asrock or MSI way to go for x3d.
Big thumbs up to you (and GN) for continuing to put the consumer first. Imagine it takes a lot deciding to kick out a major brand from your channel. I've been an ASUS fan boy since I got back into PC Building (2017) and still now have a b650e-e Strix, 3080ti OC Strix and Ryujin II 360 so I've heavily invested in their platform but for now its the last I spend with them. I've fortunately (touch wood) never hand an issue with an Asus part but reading about the RMA woe's does concern me.  Sounds like ASRock have gotten better in their quality, what other brands would you recommend?
Damn... Seems like the world of motherboards needs a forgive but not forget wipe... MSI has done some shady stuff in the past, but now they seem fine(ish?). Now I know that the next time I do upgrade, I'm not interested in the "launch day review" but more in the "long term review" of time like a month or multiple months...
Balzy ! But you do it for us , so we love you for it <3
:'( I have an Rog Strix X670E ......  uh oh.
Thanks for this honest assessment.  As you rightly say, every company can have issues, the question is how do they deal with it.  Message received, No more Asus.
I went from wanting an Asus motherboard with a 7800X3D BEFORE the chips came out, to just going Intel 13900K with a Gigabyte motherboard. I'm doing an all white build and the motherboard from Gigabyte is absolutely beautiful. The only issue with my build right now is the 7900 XTX drivers. I would like to use an extended display setup again. I have 1 240hz and 1 60hz both same res and having them both connected crashes the drivers. The GPU scene right now is absolutely horrendous. The CPU scene for AMD is horrendous. I haven't seen any 13X00 issues yet besides, motherboard issues (Asus) so I'm going team blue.
i used asus x570i got lemon unit switch to gigabyte aero line of mobos and quality is so good but software sucks
I have an almost entire Asus build, (doing one for my gf right now) and i really love your channel, but i indeed feel the same about them now, when i was looking if my motherboard (550) supports 980, i found a moderator stating that the "memory" is not in the support list, but according to their manual they support it... they just shrug it off. Finding memory is a horror show also for this board.  Hearing what happened with the bios stuff now, i'm most likely not buying any Asus products anymore, even if that means i have to spend more money towards a quality product.  Looking forward to your next video's :)
got a Asus TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (WI-FI) and I've been having nothing but problems lately, I need to switch asap.
I am a victim of ASUS's bad bios and software 😢 thanks for raising awareness about their scummy practices.
Nicely done! My issue with asus started as I wanted to upgrade my mainboard from x570 hero VIII to x570 Hero VIII dark. I received 3 samples and they were all defective and had to send them back and use my hero viii further. I am on asus tuf rtx 4090 and the gpu is rock solid. It’s their motherboard section that sucks
Tell it like it is because nobody wants to be Lied Too, Cheers.
I hope asus will get better from now on, because their behaviour is not good anymore. Asking top money for bad mobo's..... And then the bad warranty issues, for me no asus boards anymore
In south park voice: we’re sorry  Then South Park tech support, rubs nipples
Hi, i had similar issues with an assus b450 gaming. i have added 3200 mhz memory on docp profile. after 3 months i update the bios (to a version that is not there anymore) and it blew up all my memory. i have checke bios and the voltage went from 1,35 to most likely 1,45 and they got fried. i sent them for warranty and were replaced. i update the bios to the latest and now i notice my cpu temperature going up by doing nothing. just looking at the screen and temp goes up. i have to put the cpu in power saving mode to stop the increase. i think the cpu voltage is affected by the new bios but i cannot say for sure.
How do I solve the problem of an overvolting motherboard?
The wonders of proprietary software.
It's evga still making motherboards or did they shut down that part of the business also?
dafuq    I bought an Asus board for the first time and now I regret it  20 years i bought msi boards and now this damn shit with my very first asus board I will throw away the Asus board and buy a new msi board  fck you asus
Well done! It could not have been easy, but having principles and standards is what makes a great channel like this. On the other note, i have been running an ASRock workstation board with a Xeon cpu as a home server for 8 years with a total downtime of about 1h which I needed to clean up the server box and reapply thermal paste some 3 years back.
I have been avoided asus for the past 10 years. Got my hands on a brand new ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero (Wi-Fi) X570 on sale (from 550usd to 200usd isch in Sweden), arriving today. starting to regret it already….. oh’boy…. 🙄
Any advice on what motherboard to get for the people like me who want to go with the 7800X3D. I held off upgrading when I saw your video on your motherboard issues, and you were wondering if the 3D CPU had cooked it.  I think I want to go with the MSI B650 Tomahawk, but I was actually considering the ASRock or Gigabyte versions of the B650 as well.
ASUS only spend most of their money on the marketing team instead of dev to create those visually stunning ads, promo videos and marketing campaign... I always have problems with ASUS parts. Their parts are also more expensive than other brands. Two GPUs burned after 3 years of use... My MSI lasted till now more than 5 years.
I bought b550 e gaming brand new. I have issues with usb dissconecting. I have updated bios, drivers, chipset drivers, new cpu, new gpu. Still usb issues and no solution also my PC randomly freezes. I am sure it is the ASUS MB that causes issues. Built my brother with MSI board and no issues at all.
This is really upsetting. I've been building my own PCs since Pentium was a gaming option. I have ALWAYS bought Asus parts where Asus offered them. My current rig is the same, Asus mobo, gpu, cooler, psu, etc. The only laptops I've ever owned (all 2 of them!) were Asus, and they lived FOREVER. I have recommended their products to friends, family, and customers my entire life, and I could always back that up with the fact that that was all I owned. When I've had crazy issues with my mobo, they ended up connecting me with the engineering team that MADE the mobo so I could get it working and they could solve the issue for future customers who came across it! My next rig is gonna be a headache, because I'm going to have to figure out who makes a solid product, who will back that product up if/when something insane happens with it, and who has a consistent track record of delivering on both those fronts.  Guess I'm gonna be buying EVGA mobos from now on. I'll miss you Asus, thanks for nearly 3 decades of amazing hardware. I'm really sorry to see you go this way.
So the random usb disconnects i have is my Asus mobo, i thought it was a windows issue
the usb problem my friend has that due to a bad psu from corsair brand new rig everything plugged wheen booting psu shorted killed a westernblack 8tb brand new , since then its been a year his computer has random freeze , when the freeze happens the usb disconnects couldnt rma the board , end of the story the board is an asus one z690 A-Gaming wifi d4 coincidence hmmm?
Had so many crashing problems with x670e-i and 7950x3d trying to overcoock stuff etc it’s rly gonna kill you. It made my windows crash a million times and it took a lot of hours and lots of windows installs to fix it. Even Linux stuff crashed. For such highend stuff is just sad.I’ve owened rog for years and it’s been declining no matter if it gets more expensive. Just sad. Atm still semi happy with my experience but luckily haven’t gone through any rma stuff etc. but rly problems you have no idea why are Happening and then comes out they just ducked up and didn’t care to tell us
Here i go again .. i got my 7900X3D Delidded on the x670e Crosshair Hero with 4 sticks of G-Skill Trident Z Neo RGB running all 4 @6000Mhz cl36 without any issues ..Bios is the 1303 and i fixed my SoC at 1.22 .. if u haven't .. Go into u're Bios than Dram scroll to the end and there u need to enable Power Down Enable .. this is a "trick" i go to and had no probs with the Postcode15 anyways <3
hehe Asus wtf
Well... On to the next one.
Thanks Jay
I gave up buying computer hardware... Too expensive these days
5:16 Jay: '' Then want you to go away as a customer.'' Noted ASSUS, thanks to Jay and Steve I will bot be buying any of your products until you take and about face on customer service. I know big corps don't listen to our words, but they WILL our wallets.
I have so much respect for you most people would just try and defend the company
My experience with my Crosshair Hero VII has been pretty disappointing, especially in the months after the warranty ran out, where it started to develop issues recognising USB devices
Scrolling through the comments looking for a public reply from Asus...
Gigabyte board fried two cores on my absolutely new i5 Guess I need to start my own tech channel these days to be able to build a working fucking pc without replacing every other broken part from my wallet
Mad respect Jay. Thank you for showing your integrity.
this hurts to see pop up on youtube the day my z790 board shows up in the post
I'll stick with ASUS mobo!
I'm glad I didn't delay upgrading to a new system this year. I have an ASUS TUF Gaming B550- Plus Wifi board and Ryzen 3600 that i bought about two years ago. A friend just recently bought himself Ryzen 7900X with ASUS TUF board this year and is kinda worried about issues he's heard.
for me asrock was part of the best am4 motherboard first bra dto implement thunderbolt and since day one any drivers was stable the only downside to that stability is their rgb software that's is not the best but at the end the motherboard run like fire at any others point but really those shit on am5 motherboar and am5 make me going to intel again ^^ i'm for now on a am4 build  asrock & msi rock it's almost the most reliable motherboard manufacturer for me,  asus i have got trouble, gigabyte many customer return at my shop
I've been tinkering with building my own systems, and a few for friends, since the '90's. Started with Gigabyte motherboards. Those were good for awhile then I got into a bad patch with them and quit using them. Moved over to Asus for a couple builds. Wasn't impressed with the boards. I felt they were too gimmicky with stuff I didn't want or need. My last 3 builds have been all MSI. I love their stuff. Had to RMA 1 video card and that went smoothly. So, I'm sticking with MSI until they do something to tick me off. After that, no Idea who I'll go with.
Wow really wish I had the $ to redo my system now cus my mobo and AIO are ASUS, I always thought they were a really good mobo brand I had a ROG mobo in my last build that is over 10 years old and still going strong. I hope the one I got holds up as long. I hate the way the company has become and I would totally redo my system with a MSI or Gigabyte board and a NZXT AIO.
Is Asus pulling a Bud Light? Boycott Asus?
I have an Asus x670e Hero with a 7900x and I have had constant issues with it since I bought it. The SPDIF just doesnt work, theres constant crackles and sound bugs. I had to change to analog output for my headset, its still pops when audio starta playing from complete silence but at least theres no carckle. Its a joke for a product where the motherboard is more expensive then the processor. Now im considering a refund but it has already been months. Guess im gonna wait for 8000 seriese and buy a new cpu with MSI/AsRock and sell this one.
I was totally blown away with the stability of my 5900x + 570x black hero, really disapointing blue screen ram issues. So this was progressive with the gens…
Asus is a brand that if its A is taken away, it's just SUS.
Crazy
You know Asus is in trouble when the #1 fanboy fired Asus
That's what happens when you starts to believe that your "brand" is so strong that you can do whatever and nothing will harm it. Good job asus.
I somewhat feel vindicated by this video. I stopped using ASUS back in the 90s when their tech suggested I cut traces to the audio chip because it was limiting my overclock on my sp98-n board. I'm not sure I'm much better off with Gigabyte though - I just know my experiences with Biostar and MSI were worse than my Gigabyte experiences. I built a system a month ago though, which has been nothing but a headache. ryzen 7 with ddr5 that just won't play ball.
zoom closer to the megaman X box.
Je suis simple particulier qui à toujours été "pro" Asus depuis +10ans et c'est vrai que ces dernières années c'est devenu de la merde, surtout sur la partie logiciel. J'ai il y à un mois changer de carte graphique et je suis parti chez MSI, au prochain changement de config, j'irais probablement chez MSI aussi
This is another example of people not accepting liability and it's got 1000 times worse over the past three years after the biggest scam in human history.
Had some personal issues with ASUS myself.  The customer service did not address my issue and at some point even stopped replying to my emails... Luckily I solved the problem by myself...
Im glad i went gigabyte for my am5 build. No problem at all. expo working. 7600x
I’ve owned 3 different Asus products  2 laptops and 1 pc and they all ended in motherboard failure. Never again.
Putting the SUS in ASUS
Asus has been quality scum for a while. I have a prime x470 pro board and there is a known issue with cura slicer and a few other programs that completely crashes PCs when those programs are running. Cause is the Mainboard failing to switch C-states but still attempting to do so. I have been in contact with Asus support for months until they finally admitted that this issue is widespread and that they would forward it to their engineers in Taiwan. They said they would get back to me in about 2 weeks. It has been 2 years. This is a full system crash issue. Not even windows crash. Just screen to black for 10 seconds and welcome back to boot screen afterwards. Absolute garbage board.
I have done multiple builds and in the early days went with ASUS motherboards.  However, about six years ago I was building a machine for myself and the motherboard was a complete dead brick.  I went with a MSI board at the second go.  It was my first with that brand and I am writing this on that same computer.  When shit blows up or doesn't work I look at alternatives.
I was wondering when he would release this video.
My wife recently got to upgrade her camera and editing computer.  I always had good experience with Asus ROG and had put together an AMD based ROG build on paper as well as picking a comperable ROG laptop. In hindsight, I'm glad she chose the laptop because we do not need an exploding CPU.  Yes, the laptop is an ROG as well (intel i9 with a RTX4080) but so far we haven't really had any hw related issues with it.
Anyone else getting random screen flickering on desktop/gaming (Green/Purple)? Doesn't happen every day but still annoying asf but I can't troubleshoot the issue... I have a RTX4090 Strix, Z790 Apex and 1000W Strix PSU.
Jay I know for a FACT that ASUS's RMA department smashes pins. I have the PROOF on VIDEO of a Z390 PRIME board that had to be RMA'd because of a bad ram slot, we took date and timestamped video of the socket as we were filming and streaming the actual build live on TWITCH.   When ASUS's RMA department received the board ASUS claimed the pins were bent. We sent them a copy of the video of the livestream and ASUS was like OH WELL,  TOUGH COOKIES the pins are bent even though you have proof that the pins were not bent when the board was sent back to the RMA department.  Warranty VOID.
This is FREAKIN' AWESOME JAY.... I been stating for 9+ years that ASUS Fing SUCKS A$$. It all started with that POS AI Suite Software. For 9+ years I have not advised anyone use ANYTHING from ASUS! I'm actually surprised you waited this long to take a stand. NOW no matter what they do from here on out still do not use them!
what makes this worse is that ASRock are a spawn of Asus..........  it's sad that Asus aren't up to the task with the latest CPU generation
Amen have an Asus motherboard but running intel
It's enough for me to look at the price tag of ROG products to never consider them.
Going to buy a new rig soon...thanks ill avoid ASUS.
Thanks no more asus mobo’s for me
I have bought a x670e-f ROG in hong kong when the "First Date" launch!!!!, but asus gave me a really really bad memory to me. The motherboard always make very loud coil whine noise!!All the time! no cpu loading still have it. I try to discuss with Asus, they said this sound is normal! OMG...I will accept this sound come from GPU when heavy loading, But it is not acceptable from motherboard when cpu have no loading! And finally i have wait for a month, Asus gave me a final answere why asus have a very loud coil whine noise from motherboard but why other band doesn't. Asus said their motherboard have better quality and material than other band, so coil whine noise will be louder than other band, you need to accept.  WTF!? I need to accept if i love ROG and want to use Asus Am5 product with that Fxxking coil whine noise??? Finally, i return the motherboard and using Aorus right now, very good and quiet. ROG is now a shit!
Asus azoth keyboard and flow z13 acronym are the thing I'm looking for and only Asus can provide it. Their software suk dik though
Sounds like a company that is run by lawyers.
I got sent one a prebuilt from ASUS and keep getting random software crashes and bluescreens when I’m just on discord. I miss my old build lol
*Asus don't want to work with you anymore before your decision obviously. Their actions confirm that it seems. So i will take Asus's side if it's ok.*
Mate you won't read this, but from Australia, love your work! Love your ethics, and love your channel. F Asus, so happy your devotion to the truth and your subs is your main driver. Can't like this enough. Best of luck moving forwards without a shitty mob not sending you second hand review gear. 😂
Oooohhh... I thought they are only bad on phones...
I will never spend another cent on Asus, they make bad quality products and are bad criminal people.  Thank you JayTwoCents you are the saviour of the common man.
Thx God Asus Indonesia, has a good service center and is responsible for damage to the motherboard, and does not break the warranty 😂
Huge respect to you! BTW what are you doing with your system at home?
Good on ya.   The first Ryzen system I made wasn't bad - using an Asus board. Even had an Asus 1080 in it. Did a bios update, went to a 3700 (and EVGA RTX3070.) Found myself just using other boards for little builds (Aorus boards, actually, one for a "I just want to build a little PC" and one to use the parts left over form an update,) and an Aero board in my current i5-13xxx system... Hate seeing a brand go like this.   But on the other hand, if they treat *you* (or any non-small youtuber) like this, who can very much be an unofficial face of the company, I don't want to think about what they would do with smaller channels or just plain old customers.   The BIOS thing... when I first saw it, I thought, ok, sure, it's beta, they can't really warrant it to work... took a second for it to click in and go "... then why are they offering it to the general public?" I don't know the last time I saw a beta *bios* offered. Software? Sure. Hell, you can join the preview program for Windows (but they even warn not to use it on a production machine) but a BIOS?   Anyway. Thanks for taking a stand here.
I've been busting Asus for at least 10 years now... well done Jay
Sad to hear, but noted. You can't trust any company. Start anew with all new generations and see where things are at. I've had countless problems with Samsung over the years for a range of their products, mostly with their customer service, and at this point, I have sworn them off.
To be fair, Asus' boards have been getting worse for years, I have a B550-XE and it's never been stable from day one, to the point where I went back to my old X470 Crosshair Hero (remember when Crosshair Heros were less than £500?) with my 5800X.  For my Intel builds I've been using Gigabyte boards and they've been great, zero issues with those at all.
Damn sounds like ASUS customer support is as bad as Starlink's, which is a damn shame. You'd think ASUS would have learned from Gigabyte.
Good bye ass us ripoff of gamers 👋✌
I just built a new PC with a Z790 chipset and I was having all kinds of stability issues with a compatible ram kit, I'm finally stable now on XMP after the last bios update, but man it was hairy for a while.
Love Jay and Steve at GN! Both channels and guys are altruistic and really look out for the consumer and I love it! It is about time we really have people looking out for us rather than some that are just shills and ho's for said company. I will NEVER buy another Asus product and make sure no one in my entire family does either and we have bought Asus a lot in the past!
It's been almost painful to watch ASUS fall from being a solid brand. Was a brand I would generally recommend after HP pavilion really, really, fell from quality.  Had several of their parts picked for an insane computer I'll probably never get around to actually making.  Now it's weirdly looking like Acer is the best available-in-stores-near-me brand to recommend generally. They're cheaper, and they don't seem to have that many issues at all. If issues do come up, they're uncommon and you don't feel like you've been failed by a premium brand, because you at least caught a good deal and they aren't failing a bunch. Been really impressed by some of their build designs as well, not all of them but a few have really surprised me in a good way.
I'm planning to buy ASUS TUF RTX 4090, should I buy?
Wow, i never knew asrock had a bad rep. My current build is with an Asrock and its great and better than all my past builds (last 4 years- other 5 builds).
AMD needs to sue ASUS. I'm not buying AMD or ASUS for the next 3y
Saying their GPU's are fine is wrong too, they screwed up the 5700XT strix.  I had this issue, exlpained in the video "Asus Strix Fix, Another Defective Radeon RX 5700 XT" by upside down Steve. There was word you could get replacement screws to fix the issue. The problem being they would not send you the screws, but but you had to post the card to the seller, and they would send it to ASUS to fix the cooler. Quote: "ASUS are therefore completely independent of these procedures and we have no further influence on this" This would have left me without a working PC for weeks for something they unacceptably "screwed" up
Respect Jay👍🏼👍🏼
I had a horrible experience with an ASUS Strix GTX 1080. I had to work my way up to corporate to get it resolved. I had RMAed the video card and they sent me back another defective card that was an RMA. Idiots. That kept telling me I must have a driver issue. Eventually somebody higher up (I won't mention the name) was put into contact with me and it got better from there and I got a working card. I went with MSI when I got my 2080 Ti cards, only because I didn't like the EVGA look. Did have to RMA one of those MSI cards, but MSI didn't cause me trouble. 3080 Ti cards, I went back to EVGA. As for Asus, they make nice stuff, but god forbid there's a problem and you need to RMA, you'll have an easier time getting an AMD cpu to work on an Intel board. Good on you for cutting out Asus. I'm disappointed in Linus for spending today promoting the Asus Ally.
At this point, all the major brands appear to be gauging customers. Meaning, choosing the lesser evil sometimes.
Fire EKWB when??????
I am very happy that I went msi for my z690 now and msi got hacked recently
Hopefully ASUS gpus are still ok. Just got a TUF 4070ti and its too late to return...
It's really sad that basically (one of) the most expensive Hardware Manifacturers can't handle problems and has overall terrible QC. Had some personal issues with Asus as well and for the prices they demand for their (ROG) stuff, it's really sad what they are doing.
That explains why the C-states cause problems. When entering C-states, the voltage drops, and it then rings. The ringing voltage causes the CPU to lock up. To prevent that issue, you have to disable C-states.
so what do you recommand for hardware stuff ? MSI ?
i hope asus can get their head somewhere with fresh air, because the rest of us can see it stinks where its at, they were a great company. other divisions, hopefully, still make good hardware and software but how can one support them when this is the stuff they pull.
so glad I stayed with DDR4 and B550 lmao
So which motherboard brands would you consider to be reputable at the moment?
Idk, all I can say is this past build with all the progress amd's made I was seriously considering them. I ended up sticking with intel and can't say I'm sorry. Obviously asus plays a big role here but this isn't the first time amd's had stability issues. Just not dependable unfortunately, it's either plagued by gremlins or runs really great and which you get is a roll of the dice. Asus wasn't the sole mb brand amd had problems with. They've had flaky ram support, they've had this issue and that issue. I can do without it, for real. People wonder why I've stuck with intel even when amd does have a product that outperforms it slightly. This is why. Even as shit as asus has been lately (no skin in the game, running an msi board) on intel's side with the backwards capacitor it got solved. Intel's not been this touchy with voltages and unable to make use of higher speed ram and issues with 3d vcache on some or half or this quirk and that quirk.   It's not always the same issue but it's often something within the amd ecosystem that's just a problem child. They've been around long enough, they should have this under control. And why isn't amd testing the boards made for their products? An amd board isn't just 'a board' that's used for a bunch of others including amd, it's ONLY made for amd products. I won't give asus a free pass but not giving amd one either.
Just goes to show, MSI new GOAT. really REALLY proud of asrock man. ever since their little deskmini a300, everything I've gotten from them has been AsROCK solid, just like you said! 😂 my b550-c running my 5600x (granted, in eco mode bc stock cooler in an itx enclosure) has been holding up really well, and has been honestly more stable than my old intel 10600k build. (which had an asus z490i WHICH CAME WITH THE VRM THERMAL PADS LITERALLY BALLED UP UNDER THE COOLERS!!!!!!. LUCKILY I caught it but even then the usbc front IO header didn't work from the factory, it had a WHOLE host of stability problems, I actually had to underclock the 10600k *running on water btw* to 4 ghz at 1v for any kind of gaming workloads.) all in all, glad to see I wasn't crazy for feeling like asus really is just falling the hecc off.
Asrock had a bad reputation..? I got one of their mainboards back when it was relevant for the, I think, I7-3770k and it never let me down
😂😂 Asus is like a Samsung catching fire 🔥 should have gone gigabyte
Thank you Uncle Jay! Glad I went the Gigabyte Route :D
I pointed out weeks ago in the comments that you were a SLOW learner with all the problems you're having and still clinging slavishly to ASUS while throwing AMD under the bus at every opportunity. I think you also owe AMD an apology.
Thanks for your Vids. I am 100% agree with you that since Z490 ASUS has less quality at double the  price. Even the it/tech stores tells me to avoid Asus now here in Denmark.  To expensive and way to many faults.
Glad I went with MSI on my new rig. Sheesh. Crazy
13:20 Ironic since ASrock is an spinoff of ASUS. I used to think of ASrock as being subpar knockoff brand cheapo for budget build for grandma's PC, and Asus one of the best manufactures for high/best performance.  My how the tables have turned.
Yep, also personally done with any Asus products. I've had non stop odd intermittent issues with my Asus board. Also my memory won't run at speed and asus doesnt care.
I am an EVGA fan and I was sadden that they stopped making GPU and they make top-line motherboard only.  Next brand in line that I know make good products is Asus but I already know their customer service is terrible.  If I have to rank on product, EVGA > Asus > MSI > ASRock (honorable mention: Zotac > PNY) > Gigabyte.  For service, EVGA > MSI > ASRock (honorable mention: Zotac > PNY) > Asus > Gigabyte.  My opinion, of course.  However, if Asus does not change, I will have to rank them lower.
Holy cow, ASUS is so shady....
i can really understand your frustations etc. the only thing im annoyed by this video is that you had an issue with the BETA Bios. Ofc a beta bios isnt finalized yet and i deal with a lot of betas outside of bios and there the same things can happen like void agreements etc because you use something that is out for testing. which they said they still do. other than that its understandable that you choose not to go asus anymore. but the issues you had with asus is something i had with the other x billion branches and compared to some asus software is a holy grail. for instance i had to go back to caseking 5 times the same day cuz they kept giving me a msi board which pcie 16 slot was defekt even tho i bought it new. a gigabyte 3090 died playing league of legends or getting an msi intel board which bios update killed ram of my brother.  overall i got a x670e hero, ryzen 9 7950x and 6ghz ddr5 corsair ram. both working perfectly fine since launch.
You know I upgraded to a ryzen 7 5800x and a pro art board thinking my motherboard was going bad from random black screens. I now have USB issues with this board and was about to throw out my tower. Might have to grab an AsRock or EVGA board and swap it out.
Asus : "I got 99 solutions but a BIOS ain't one"
Thank you! I was just browsing for a new MB.
ASUS today is all about looks, no substance. I stopped buying ASUS stuff 3-4 years ago after getting conned with the Zenith Extreme motherboard and the networking equipment (switch and NICs). I've had a ASRock motherboard in my home server running for I don't remember how many years now. And in my current ITX build, I'm giving MSI a go. For over 10 years I used ASUS motherboards! Mainly TUF line ones and the last was an absolute ~600€ garbage ROG board DoA with a bent pin and when it came back after one month it booted but the memory controller was obviously fucked and the chipset cover was ruined with some sort of dark substance I couldn't get off. It wasn't a new board, it was the same one. What a ripoff. And the support? None.
Respect from Germany for calling out the truth !
I hope other creators  do this as well
I haven't used Asus for 20-25 years... I got a motherboard back then with a feature which didn't work. I can't remember which one... They promised a bios update... after 2 month I gave up.... Made a new build... They wouldn't refund anything... So after a year or 2 I checked again...still no update of the Bios which fixed the issue....  My point is ASUS has been screwing customers for over 2 decades. It isn't a new thing.. You can put in a lot of swearwords here:  "%¤##%¤#" ¤%¤"#% "%¤¤% #¤" ... and it is how I have been feeling about ASUS since then.  Great you follow your sense of justice in this matter Jayz.... It isn't worth loosing your brand over ASUS !!!!
The difference between Jay and Steve is that Jay was happy to take their money until it affected him PERSONALLY. Then he jumped on the bandwagon. Steve built the wagon.
So, MSI and ASROCK you say…, bet.
why would anyone install a beta bios in the first place though? sounds lke a stupid games stupid prizes sort of thing
aaaahhh i have this board
Looks like whoever was running the ASUS Webstorage got promoted to Influencer Customer Relations
There is a reason I don't go for ASUS hardware - including their Ally handheld - and that is their quality control which is all over the place.
It's so weird to see that both Gigglebit and Asus fumbles the ball with their products this hard. I have an ASUS board right now, and I have always enjoyed their motherboards, safe to say that I'll go with MSI or ASRock next time.  That they completely refuses to honor any warranty because of their beta bios is honestly the worst way you can treat your customers, especially when they have not fixed the things they said in the beta bios.
SAME! I had such a terrible experience with them. I got 4 ROG products, 3 of them broke within the first year.  But my experience trying to fix / repair Laptop, that after I finally got a refund (credit to Wootware for going the extra mile there, and NOT Asus) I swore never to buy anything Asus again. It's that bad!
I am an Rog Fan, my first pc I’ve ever built is based on Rog, problem is since I’ve built it I’ve had never ending issues of random crashes, sometimes my system lags for some reason or files being removed. I’ve done bios updates everything I can think of. I built another pc for someone else same type of build but with an MSI board and no issues with performance. Super strange. Oh and recently my £1,600 laptop from asus, battery randomly died on me so now I’m stuck with having to use a power supply.
I have a 7950x (non-3d) and a asus x670e-e gaming wifi mobo. Only got it ciz a bundle at micro center. Tbh while playing games it will really randomly crash saying that the display device disconnected when though it's clearly being used. xD Not often, but I'm definitely attributing this to the mobo, since it literally immediately goes to desktop with display, and the igpu is turned off through device manager. I never had this problem with any other kind of mobo and i'm using a asus 4090 aswell, kinda regret buying asus stuff now ahaha
If anything, this will make their main rival, MSI, look like the brand to go with.  I mean, I think I definitely see MSI being in my next build (which WILL either be this year or next).  I mean, I've been going to ASUS motherboards since the Windows Vista era, now to see THIS happening?!?!?  Pfft...
WOW. I was about to do a completely new build with mostly ASUS components. I think I will revisit my component selection now. Thanks Jay
Asus is no longer my primary choice for computer related things, maybe ill try Gigabyte or something.
😢I was a fanboy of ASUS ROG, who am I kidding, I still am, but ASUS you need to make some changes, take responsibilities, be the brand who we need and you once were...   Maybe, put some leather boy behind the wheel...
Also gigabyte was the one to avoid not asrock
I always loved the videos you make Jay , but this time i think ur overreacting a bit  , dont u think ? Maybe cool down a bit for a few days , and on the next reviews , dont compare other products with Asus . U will see u miss ur best friend Asus
Asus have had poor quality control for a lot longer than the last few years. I ditched them ages ago. Whilst they generally don't overclock as well, I have had much better reliability with Gigabyte.
Want to know whats crazy? Just yesterday my computer froze by just watching youtube. This is a nice build too (12th gen intel with guess what ASUS MOTHERBOARD, and 4070ti) I noticed that all my lights on my computer were on and monitors were fine but guess what? Motherboard blacked out with not even a flashing red light. Guess I will be replacing mobo. In an unrelated note. Anyone want to buy a z690 r4 gaming mobo?
1:14 Well that was weird lol  EDIT: nvm, I get it haha sheesh I'm dumb.
Ive been having problems since crosshair on 1090t bad boards, bad support, ever since i got on gigabyte ud5 it was amazing stable, asus on amd sucks
That's worrying. My new Asus Zephyrus M16 auto update its bios on a regular basis.
Asus are like the Italian car of motherboards
So I'm a bit confused by the problem, Are CPU spontaneously blowing up, or are people attempting to overclock when this occurs?  From what I recall this isn't just with ASUS motherboards.
I agree with everything since I went team red and with the x670e hero mobo and learned the hard way that I picked very VERY wrong. All I wanted was a stable switch to PC from console. But your censor sound is awesome, thanks again for saving me from asus that STUFFING company
nano computers
Thanks Jay for the heads up. I’m finally committed to building a new pc. It’s been awhile so I just found your channel while doing research on newest tech and company brands. I’m glad I found your channel cause some of my build lists definitely had asus products. Now I will stay away asus in the mean time
Jay relieved he has an MSI board? ummm. has he not heard about the MSI hack?
Something I’ve noticed ASUS doing recently is releasing a board and getting it reviewed with glowing reviews and then quietly replacing it with a “Rev 2” board with inferior components once the reviews are out.  My partner bought the X570-E gaming WiFi as we believed it had an Intel WiFi controller but he received a Rev 2 with a Mediatek WiFi controller which is complete junk.  Really annoyed with that.
Glad i was never interested in the ROG Ally. After watching this video, i can only imagine what some consumers are gonna suffer when they buy that garbage.
In the middle of building my next pc on pcpartspicker and just removed Asus from the list. Hmm... what motherboard manufacturer should I pick now?
You did the right thing.
My Asus rog z690-A gaming wifi D4 has gone worse with every bios Update. My ddr4 4400 VIP’er kit could easy do xmp 4400 MHz i. The beginnig. Now 5 bios updates later it can barly do 4000mhz and I cant revert back to the Old bios that worked.
Huge respect to you for sticking by your integrity on the channel and your trust to us, the consumers. Thank you Jay.
I have a ASRock B450 Steel Legend it's 4 years old and I've never had a problem with it , started with a  Ryzen 2600 in it now it's got a 5600x in it and it's never missed a beat . Just cos you pay a fortune for something dosent mean it's a better product
While the way Asus handled the last two major issues has been abysmal, it is also one of the reasons why I avoid "bleeding edge" components.
I have been a big Asus fanboy, but they have always had crap software. Happy to see you have finally said this but, what brand do we go with now? MSI have horrible support....
I just bought a STRIX MOBO for my 7900X am i in trouble?
This is clear hint to other mb manufactures like AsRock or MSI ect, make beautiful white boards for AMD and we can shelve ASUS for long time to get their s*it together. I dont have any asus products for years after they refused to RMA my 970 graphics card
It's good to know that if my 4090 dies they'll do nothing about it without serious pushing. I'm never buying an ASUS board, and I was skeptical about buying anything of theirs, but the TUF 4090 got great reviews
People say vote with your wallet when it comes to games etc. I like to think this is the same. Well done Jay and Team.
Not only ASUS but since you are fan boys its hard not to speak of.   MSI and the AIO problem went under the rug, people were getting no feedback after complainig and some sistems died
Brave of you to do that.
If you have to go through a FOIA then you know theres something to hide
how are you going to afford the 5090 now?
My motherboards personally have always been MSI never had any problems thankfully. Best of Luck ASUS, if you don't take care of your consumer they will go elsewhere.
I could have told you stories from more then ten years ago about their shitty products. I've owned three different products from ASUS, the Garmin Nüvi phone, a  64gb tablet (can't remember the name), and a GTX 970 GPU, ALL of which have been a disaster performance and functionality wise, the tablet was touted to be faster than a speeding bullet (at the time), but was slower than a dead cheetah, just a stuttering mess all the time, it was even advertised as having Gorilla Glass (which i incidently broke with one punch after getting REALLY frustrated one day, so NOT Gorilla Glass) . The GPU had random issues with disappearing COMPLETELY from BIOS, causing my PC to claim no GPU was present (even though it was sitting snug in its socket). The phone was just an all out mess of random issues all the time, ranging from being slow like the dead cheetah, to crashing randomly, and most issues you can think of in between. Now whether that was a result of combining a smartphone with a GPS of the technology advances at that time is hard to say. My point being, I have avoided ASUS like the plague ever since, even skipping other types of products simply because they had ASUS components or parts in them. I think it's time to Bud Light them, and I'm danish so i don't have dog in that beer fight.
The true measure of any company is what they do when things go wrong.... Asus are a complete failure in that regard and do not deserve your money.  I used to swear by them until about 8yrs ago... quality went into the toilet and I stopped using them after their disaster of the R9 280X GPU's and their refusal to recall faulty cards.  My last Asus purchase was an X570 MB in 2020 that had to be returned because of USB controller issues. Switched to Gigabyte and my system has been rock solid... I know Gigabyte have a reputation for shitty customer service. But I've not actually had anything from them fail or cause issues... and for me... the first line of this post is the point at which my personal opinion would change. I have however decided I will never purchase a Gigabyte PSU ever again (only buy EVGA now)  This scummy behaviour is enough for me to now say... Asus are a dead company for me. They will never get another penny of my money ever again. Once I make a decision like that it's a permanent one. I've boycotted companies because of actual problems I have had with them... this may be the first time I've had a company on the 'try to avoid them' list move to the 'Never buy anything from them ever again' list.  Nice to see content creators taking a stand against this kind of bull shit... you and Steve should be applauded for say enough is enough and that shitty anti-consumer crap like this is unacceptable.  Thanks Jay (and team)
Jay, I've just recently started watching your content, (I was missing out!) but I've come to respect you and many of your positions greatly. Having you stand up to ASUS like this, that's big respect from me man. I feel like you're really fighting for US. I've been an ASUS guy for as long as I've been building. My first build ever was mostly ASUS stuff; so watching them fall like this has been very disheartening to say the least. I just built my 13th gen intel rig; and for these reasons I avoided any and all ASUS components, down to the last nut and bolt. One of my close friends even got rid of his brand new Z790 board because of all this; so.. it's already happening. People are jumping ship, and they need to start taking accountability fast.
Starting with Z77 and the arrival of the OC Formula by Nick Shih series of ASRock boards ASR overall quality has improved greatly overall. When I first got into competitive OC / XOC halfway through Z87 becoming 97 I tested the MSI M and X Powers, Gaming 7, M Gaming + Z87 G45. The Asus Extreme and Impact VI + VII boards and Gigabyte SOC Force Z87 + 97. Sure some were OK but the weekend I got the Z97 OC Formula I immediately started destroying every other board I tried in terms of Mem OC and more specifically won the Haswell Low Clock Challenge ( as amatuer, open class) followed up by finishing 2nd for the Skylake version of the Comp. Even better as Z170 was ending I was contacted by Nick Shih himself and was offered a sponsorship on the spot. Those boards are dead simple to use and to do so at the highest level. I was ready to give up on my XOC dream until I gave the underdog a chance and never looked back
Good job Jay! Not just the PC boards from Asus but also their ROG Phones. Most tech reviewers never point that out.
Sad. Asus mainboards have been in my builds forever, my latest being the Strix x570-E board with generally good results. What is going on over there?
I've always maintained that Asus made too much stupid product SKUs for them to be reliable and well designed.
That has been my experience with Asus as well - I was super happy with their P8P67 board more than a decade ago and have been buying their stuff ever since - their mobos, GPUs, sound cards, laptops, any hardware I needed I was automatically going with Asus. I did the same with their AM5 X670 E-E and it has been problems all the way, mainly with memory (and I had to RMA the first board, because 3 USB ports did not work). After a long exchange with Asus support about Expo not working they told me it's my CPU that is the problem. I will not do the Asus mistake ever again!
Gigabyte all the way BAAAABY! and Corsair of course...
i have too many problem with asus because they hiding behide stupid wall about quaily issues which laptop that every customer bought in my shop show me how fragile keyboard was and i reach out to asus make recall or replace this mess they say nothing but block me oh really man and this time cut asus out of my list and make sing on front of windows about asus refuse fix they mess fragiles crap and customer have return asus stuff got other brand like asrock or gigbyte and dont feel comfy about msi because they too sus and more liar on the table which you dont see it but i do msi will blackmail anyone dont ask how i know this
i have used 3 asrock boards in my 3 last builds, one asrock z77, asrock b450 steel legend and now asrock b550 steel legend, those boards have been rock solid even in overclocking, no issues, no bsod, good perf, and great price for the perf, im currently using a 5800x3d with my b550 steel legend and it works great
That’s a shame. I’ve always liked ASU’s over the years and liked to see you work with the stuff I could never afford to get. But it also opens up an interesting road to see what products you will use going forward for various things. If you have a spare ASUS top end intel 8th gen board you want to throw my way, I’d love it 😂. I could only just afford to upgrade from a 3rd gen i3 to 8th gen i5 when the pandemic hit. Mostly because I had to sort something to work from home and got a clearance NVidia 1060 strix as well so I could run some games on it.
I am disappointed now for buying an ASUS board instead of the MSI one i was planning on and i dont know wahr to do. I also habe a 7800X3D
I have literally just brought an asus motherboard bundle but Intel platform. Have I made a mistake?
In my 2 decades of experience with tech products, no other company's product had a higher failure rate than ASUS!
Maybe they started using robots?!
Sounds like Asus got some people from another total anti customer brand. Hey it's broke because our fault. Yeah repair is...just buy a new one
Wow! Thanks for being so hornest in why, and what led to this.
Glad I went for the MSI x670-P, with the 7800x3d first thing I did was upgrade the bios to mitigate any voltage issues.
I'm sad you have to do this. They are my favorite MBO brand and I've had nothing but a positive experience with their ROG STRIX B660-A GAMING WIFI D4
Nice one. I just cancelled my Asus RTX 4080 and bought another branded card
Wow that makes sense, i have the same z790 i keep getting blue screen and system freez.  I did all the tests and all seam normal.. heck now i need to change the MB  Thx jay
Lets hope asus learns from this.
I have an older Asus monitor, and a newer Asus monitor, both times, just the basic trouble of trying to get the colors correct in windows made me nearly lose my mind. Did not buy an Asus mobo like I usually do for this build I did last year and will not be buying Asus crap again. 😠
13:18 missed opportunity to say ''solid as rock''
honestly you're in for some ish if you go with MSI, like the hardware is undeniably dope, but the software is worse than poo.
Well i have a Strix X670E E Gaming paired with a 7800x3d and i have already went through one rma process, because the first batch did not even poat into bios and got stuck on debug code 00. The replacement board i got is at least working with beta bios, but hearing this i regret my decision to stick with asus. I saw the label saying it was a beta bios, but the rest of description concerning the void of warranty is hidden und more details.
With smashed pins being such a problem, you would _imagine_ someone would have the foresight and wherewithal  to include headers that interface the socket using a series of pins which are orientated to only go in one way so that an RMA fix can be simple as popping the damaged socket off and replacing it. _Even better_ — let the end-user do it! Then include standoffs to account for the extra Z-height.  It would screw up cooler clearance and cause performance issues where directly soldering it to the board would be better, but my response to that is _Ha ha, 🎶your board have smashed pins! Wait for RMA!🎶_ when if it were a socket on a series of headers it'd attach to, the broken part could be removed without fancy tools and heat to be disposed of.
I had an asus x570 tuf gaming motherboard at it was lackluster for the price. No usb c header, when other motherboards had it in the same price range, terrible rgb software that would quit working if you didn’t have it updated, the custom effects are set on a loop and randomly kick the rgb off for a second then back on. If you didn’t know what it was you might think you have defective equipment, like rgb hubs, bad motherboard. I’m glad I went to gigabyte, sadly I got the last series of evga cards so I won’t be able to upgrade with another one down the line.
Huge shame. Been a fan since the mid 90s. I could always count on ASUS to make good products as I always bought that brand and never had an issue. I guess brand means more now
Roger that!
Their gaming laptops have poor  quality motherboards
If EVGA comes out with a itx board. I will buy it in a heart beat and replacing the current ASUS I have.
Intel has EVGA boards (pricey), but y'all knew that. They're amazing quality. 7 panel display, CMOS and power buttons, plenty of headers, plenty of USB 3.2 type As, plenty of features just look into them. They're on sale often too. If nothing else, EVGA is the exact opposite of ASUS with customer support in my experience. I've never had trouble RMAing with them even when it turns out that part had no issue. Just get a whole freaking new box. I felt bad really. And their boards are multi LEDS. I remember thinking the classified was going to be only red and yellow because that's all they showed. Nah fam, it's total RGB. Turn it off it you want.
This is textbook the kind of backlash that can kill a brand. It's amazing how Asus leadership could let that happen.  Kudos to GamersNexus and JayTwoCents for providing the facts and taking a principled stance.
Oh boy the timming... I just switched From from MSI x470 Pro Carbon to ASUS Z690-A Rog Strix after having Audio and USB stuttering issues with a Ryzen 5000 series processor, now I'm scared my brand new Asus Z690 (that I bought to avoid MSI) might fail...
Their video cards are pretty good 😬
This video makes me feel a bit better, for having just bought an ASrock graphics card. (an AMD card, because.. nvidia are scrumbags too... ) i will probably buy a motherboard from them next year, for my CPU upgrade - we'll see. I also like MSI (they've made my current mobo - only issue i have with that is, the bluetooth is rarely detected in windows and thus i cant use it)
asus is literally the best motherboard brand LMFAO. just because u amd re-t2rds have ur cr2ppy chips blowing up doesnt mean its asus fault
Luckily my ROG X570 board has shown no problems so far with the 5950x (other than shitty memory compatibility). But my old X470 Asus board had so many issues, and even when i RMA'd it they sent it back saying "we didnt see any issues", and it kept fucking up so i had to send it back AGAIN and they just sent a new one.  Hopefully they get their shit together soon.
Asus getting high from smelling their own farts.
Thanks for save, Jay! Assus was foundation of my all computers since ‘90’s - and was about to get another refresh.
You can't even reach those Guys until you already own an ASUS Product. Maybe you can get a response on Twitter, but when you have a Question about one of their products and want to write in a Mail... NOPE
Oh ASUS was going into the shitter for quite a few years now. About 10 years ago I would recommend ASUS to pretty much anyone. It was always solid gear. In fact I still have p8z68 board with 2600k in it that no longer is being used but the MB is still working and always has with no issues. But the last couple of years they degraded so much that I recommend everything but ASUS. Not to mention they are the most overpriced brand out there... Price tags on some RoG pieces are just a fucking joke.  Huge respect to you Jay!
I used an Asus mobo for my 5950X build 2 years ago and it's been nothing but trouble. Nothing major but constant small issues that randomly come & go. Will not be using them again.
I will never buy Asus again
Been gaming for 30. I was always Asus, Intel and Nvidia - until about 2 years ago. Im now full on MSI and AMD and its prolly the best rig Ive ever had. The reason I boycut ASUS is because I think they become more and more about profit and less and less about actual quality, what they were known for back in the day. They had amazing products, especially the Maximus series! Today though, all bling and RGB. Customers can go F themself. RIP another formerly known as good.
I regret that I bought an ASUS board this gen. I manually fixed the SOC voltage a few weeks ago to 1.15V, I hope it won't die. "Handling" these things by ASUS is ridiculous. I won't buy an ASUS board in the future, even though I don't have any issues with it, fully stable.  Respect Jay for backing us!
Asus stopped existing to me after ZenFone 8.
asus stock went down 3% after this vid
Jay, you are a legend and have my full respect!
Your honesty is more than appreciated.   The customer support for 'normal' customers is also kind interessant at the moment. I recently bought an Asus Strix Motherboard via Amazon (new). Recieved it without its OVP and in a Box in which the mainboard had to lay diagonaly to fit. I texted the Asus support. Their response: "We checked your problem. It is impossible, that a mainboard could have been send without OVP.  I have send it back. Happily for me the Amazon support is more customer friendly.
I really appreciate the hard work and honesty of channels like yours, Hardware unboxed and Gamers Nexus. Invaluable information when picking parts for your own rig (or even more important)...a rig for a friend or family member trusting on your judgement.  Meanwhile on LTT...a review of a ROG Ally Z1. Let's see how they will respond to this. I chuckled when reading their video description....something about not entirely truthful marketing by Asus....😂😂😂
I am currently planning on building a new PC using AMD (have always used Intel as may not be the best but also very few issues if any) and have used ASUS products quite a bit. I am glad I have been dragging my feet on pulling the pin and may have to stick with Intel and try someone other than ASUS.
THANK YOU JAY - I've given Asus too many chances. Bit me in the ass with an RMA and now defective parts on my most recent build. VOICE FOR THE PEOPLE!!!
Some time ago I got my B550 Strix shipped, it wouldn't work due to some RAM issue, I sent it back to ASUS waranty service and they sent me a new piece. How shocking it was to realise I got a used one, when I registered the board on ASUS website it said I only got roughly a year of warranty left - and it should be 3 years. Great job ASUS, you just lost a customer for good. Only MSI.
Im sure they couldn't away with the warranty thing in the Uk surly not   I sent a Board back in 2009/10 they recieved it and i never got it back in short was told its in for repair but never did get it back and ive never bought an Asus product since  I thought ASRock was a side company of ASUS?
i thought they have premium products with quality in it. im glad i bought MSI mobo instead of asus.
Thank you for your honesty! Best wishes from Sweden!
Ive been using Asus motherboards for decades, does this action warrant throwing away that trust? Do any brands deserve loyalty, or do we need to be vigilant with every piece of hardware?
Thanks for this! And great work standing up to companies not giving good service no matter how big they are.   I was on the brink of buying an Asus mobo and a Ryzen 7 7800x3d combo, I would have been super bummed if I had to pay the price for Asus not caring about consumers. MSI seemed to jump on the issue quite quickly and I would then rather support them, so would an MSI mobo work with the same cpu or should I look at another cpu? I can't tell if the cpu is also causing the problem or just the mobo alone
I was hating on Asus before it was cool!
I'm also just halfway satisfied with my Asus Z790-H.  The Hardware seems to do its job fine so far with a 13700K, but some things i will never understand.  -Why on earth does a 400€ Motherboard not have a Pump Header (It only has an AiO-Header, that for some artificial reason can't be speed controlled)? Why do i have to pay over 100€ more to get a dedicated higher-powered Pump Header, but no other features that are worth that money?  -Also, why is the MoBo unable to safe and recall RGB-settings after being completely powered off? Why does it need to boot into windows and start the Armoury Crate Services first?  -Speaking of Armoury Crate - what a peace of crap Software. Way too convoluted with fancy crap, not user friendly at all. With Armoury Crate, function follows form. It should be the other way around. Everytime you start it and there is an Update, you need to Update first before you can do anything. The best part is that for example FanExpert doesn't just run along until you update. It kills the set Fan-Curves as soon as you start Armoury Crate, switches to some kind of auto control and only recalls the prior settings after you not-so-voluntarily updated FanExpert. -What i learned from my Research about the RGB problems is that ASUS doesn't even look into their own support forums. The users have to help themselves. Some users do an awesome job with that, but ASUS doesn't do crap. I have no idea how to even tell them that there are very annoying problems with their software.  My Problems are more because of software, rather than hardware. I can control my pump just fine via a fan-header and run it just at about 50%, never overpowering the rated fan-header-power. But the software will annoy the hell out of me for years to come, until i need to upgrade again.  You need to do better Asus. With that kind of crap, my next MoBO will be from another manufacturer.  If EVGA would have put out some Z790 Customer Boards for humanly prices, i would've bought it right away.
Maybe they will start producing rog strix garbage cans
❤👏
My current build is Asus. My next build will not have a single asus component. Not even that free cable tie that came with my graphics card.
Hey I have TUF gaming MB, GPU, corsair dominator RAM and I will be buying bequiet rgb fans (I am still waiting for my Fractal Design North case) I am struggling to make RGB consistent. It would be nice to watch a video about different software for RGB. Using Armoury-Crate even though I installed aura sync plugin and my ram is recognized by the software I still get default rainbow. Using iCUE I can set MB, GPU and RAM but then when I launched Chernobylite, only my RAM is getting integrated with the game and switches to green flickering effect. Using OpenRGB out of the box my RAM is recognized as different ram and it does not work, do I need to update some database of devices?
Great video. Zero filters, just straight up facts. Well done man.
Learning that ASUS was driving out of spec voltages to SoC was bad, but if they had stood behind their brand it could have reinforced their image as they would have shown they would do the right thing. Instead they took the sleaziest possible path by trying to rob the users they had damaged of any warranty support through abusive terms on the 'fix' bios. Oh you want our $500+ boards to stop destroying your CPUs? Then sign here to void your warranty.
I've felt like this about Asus/Rog for a while, sadly Asus is still the only company producing certain products, so there's not much choice but to live with their BS until others step up. I can't get a Micro-ATX/Mini-ITX motherboard from anyone else if I want X670 and neither could I buy a 1440p monitor with 360hz from anyone else. They will only start noticing this if the returns are bad enough to where it's hurting shops and through that them, but so far not even their ridiculous mark ups have done that, so I doubt shit quality will get them there so soon.
Nvidia dump evga influencer dump asus. 🤣😂
Hope this video gets the attention it deserves. And Asus starts to make the relavent changes.
This is like Gigabyte's exploding PSUs again.
asus fired? but you will still buy their products and test them so that we know the issues? because if you dont then asus got what they wanted...silence :)
Oh shit! Just bought an ASUS motherboard for my new build! Now I'm worried 😥
I was going to buy an Asus 6650 XT. Now I won't, I will also vote with my wallet.
The way this has to be handled, so that we are not testing the software for a month when there is a critical issue, is that an already tested software has to be taken, and a really minimal change must be made that is designed to fix the issue, and the test scope can be reduced not to test absolutely everything in regards of your product. Idk, like you would not test the WiFi and the onboard audio. I don't know a lot about motherboards, but the last thing I would do is to integrate a new AGESA version, which I am not quite sure is doing what.
Is ASRock under a different management from ASUS even if they're the sub-brand?
I have a bad reputation with ASUS as a customer also. I had just problems with their products in the past 10 years. I used to blame AMD because of it but the more I tested the more wrong I was. I'm talking about graphics cards that give you red screen and green screen in the first month of bought, laptops that you can't install drivers and a lot of crap bloatware,  phones that died randomly or overheat. They just couldn't resist even 1 year without problems and got sick of it. First time when I gog A-SUS-ED was with my first new graphics card back in 2013. They just sent me over and over no more than 5 bad products with promises that it was tested 2-3 days before...and still crashed or overheat or blue,red,green,black screen over and over again. The second one was even worse. I mean when you send your phone on warranty you would expect to be repaired right? How wrong I was... .When it arrived they said that it was needed to change the motherboard, proof that it was a hardware issue, but it wasn't the same. I got so A-SUS-ED that from 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of ROM then it went to 2GB of RAM and 8 GB of ROM... .How can you get officially scammed? Only ASUS knows... . ASRock and MSI wasn't and angel too back in the day but at least they tried to do something about those really problematic hardware issues. My experience with MSI wasn't that good also, from z68 to B450 chipsets and still felt the cpu limitation with bluescreens. Something wrong was going on with their bios and I stopped to believe anymore in them and now is even worst because of their key leak. Just moved to Gigabyte and end of the story. From then until now ASUS and MSI was a no go and even ASRock because I had 2 motherboards that random blew up. But you know what? My mind is changing..never ever forever hell no to ASUS and also MSI and I'm willing to give ASRock a solid chance in the future. Thanks you because you're always on the costumer side and thank you for getting the hell out ASUS from our lives! Your the real MVP! JayFTW!
I was a solid ASUS motherboard buyer for at least a couple of decades, but I quit ASUS motherboards when they took away the troubleshooting codes from all but the top tier boards to force anyone who wants them to spend 2-300 more for the privilege of having a little LCD screen to make it easier to troubleshoot.  Hard to fault Strix GPU's though.
So glad that you made this video, had been planning to buy a 7800x3d, certainly going to avoid an asus mobo like the plague
Think that you have visibility, and you can report. I was 2 months waiting for RMA. 2 months without being able to work with my pc. Asus must fail
would you sell the smashed one? i would buy it
Thank goodness that around here people don't have to deal with manufacturers when it comes to computer parts. You'll contact the shop you bought the product from and they have to deal with it.
Ist asus and asrock same firm ?
Keep up the great work Jay!
Good for you,  i dont touch asus anymore, sent a replacement monitor to me where the bezel wasnt attached to the back bezel spent 3 weeks battling for a working monitor
my asus tuf x570 killed the memory controller on my 3900x.. couldn't use memory in the A channel.  memory was fine in different computer. borrowed a known good motherboard and still had same problem. So thought it was just teh cpu. while it was at amd they agreed the memory controller was bad and sent me a new 3900x. I couldn't wait for the RMA  so i bought a 5900x. anndddd the same thing happened to it  after few months. memory channel died again. only thing i didn't change during the whole process was the motherboard. the ram was fine in other computers..
This video is not helpful when I'm trying to sell a B650E-E board 😂
I always went low tier MB beforei saved and splashed on a maximus hero z690 for my current build. Never been more disappointed, random issues constantly but I didn't know enough to prove it was the MB.
It could just be me, but Asus have been running on the ROG label for far too long. AsRock was the avoided brand, yet they become solid without any media. Please do more AsRock boards
This fairly hurts. Twenty years ago, Asus was well established as the reliable constant. Consistently among best performers while not being too terribly expensive as all the rest (Gigabyte, Chaintech, DFI, Abit, Soltek, Tyan, MSI, AOpen, etc) jockeyed for position. To see the once proud brand be reduced to this? If they cannot repair this blemish it will truly  be the end of an era.
Havent been happy with ASUS parts in my PC  BUT  My ASUS Zenfone 9 , is honestly the best smartphone i've ever had, and  had a lot of flagship phones including, iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus and LG
asus have bad quality control .. yes it is.... good video... for now I will avoid products from asus either motherboard or gpu. Thank jayz for your information .
What can we replace it with?  I think MSI.  Are they still good?
You said this was the 2nd one. What was the 1st company? I need to know what not to buy
I have been a loyal supporter of ASUS since I got into gaming.  I have one PC with a AsRock x79 with 3820 CPU that currently runs night and day 24/7 and it has outlasted 3 ASUS boards, B150 and two X99 boards.  I am Right behind you Jay.
Samsung was just as bad with me about 2 soundbars. One had been returned to be fixed before, then it broke again, and they wouldn't accept the same receipt I showed them the first time it broke that they did accept!! so I sent them 4 diff ones, finally they said ok.  now on 3rd time in a year and now the warranty is out as of 6 days ago, but it's in their hands now.
Good move, I already became suspicious of them after searching for my b450 motherboard a long time ago, their options were just mediocre and overpriced
Huge respect Jay
Feels like many companies fired their best coders, or having trouble keeping/hiring talent.
I've never really had an issue with asus, I would call myself an asus fan boy, I own the 49" ultrawide by Asus, the 360hz Asus Monitor, Asus Mobo and GPU , AIO cooler and rog phone 6 ultimate d by them. Never had an issue with any of them.
After watching tones of your videos on this channel, I am proud to subscribe to it. I used to be working in ASUS service years ago, back then the brand was rock solid but it turned out to be worse piece of crap you could get into your rig!!
I gotta respect this. Man is literally refusing money so he can live up to his principles and is doing it publicly.
JAY! I watch your videos on youtube from your chanel beginings and i learned most of my gaming pc build skills from you and till now i build over 15 gaming pc's for me and for my friends and the most brand i trust really is MSI. My gaming pc is from 2018 and all the builds i made also fot the MB and Graphic cards are also MSI and till now i didn't have any issue with it! So in my opinion and from my experience that i had i see MSI is the best brand ever and EVGA is the best power supply also. Thank you JAY for your honesty.
well F. been a long time supporter of Asus.hard to let them go but you can only dig so far before you bury yourself. rip
If you haven't already, you might want to add MSI to the list of people you won't allow to sponsor your channel. I bought a board from MSI that went bad in 2 months. I sent the board back to them, and a MONTH later, I got a new board. That board was warped, and both m.2 heat sinks were broken and just hanging off the board. The threads on the board itself were stripped out and there were scratches all over the board. I sent that one back, and ANOTHER MONTH LATER I got a board with nonfunctional argb headers.  Never again.
When it comes to fire, most companies will lie and won’t be responsible or liable. All over money and being sued. For them to not warranty any update that does not fix the board, is pure greed. Lawyers run the company. Not to mention, them not paying Jay through contracts.
Currently on B550 STRIX-A and 5900x. Updated the bios for the first time in a year and now it will randomly crash. Thought it was the cooler and replaced it with a beefier one (Phantenks 240 AIO) and still the same issue. Gonna replace the board when I turn this into my theater PC after my next build. Super disappointed since the board worked great and looks amazing in the white G360.
I've found out my memory overclocks on my board doesn't support 4 sticks of 3600 DDR4 and have had issues at the start. Definitely going back to Gigabyte and Intel next year.
Hahaha everyone is shilling for their handheld at the moment as well
I have nothing but problems with my Z790-E motherboard….. switch to MSI and everything works out of the box😅
I'm glad that my New build is with msi morherboard  en msi gforce 4090
Strix GPUs has coil whine much often then other cards. For their price I think this is unacceptable
ayo that mega man X figure box in the background
Recently i got a brand new rog Z690-A GAMING WIFI D4 board and the pins for the restart switch were bent not snapped just bend but i am assuming that it was the pc part store where i ordered it but still runing strong and i am pretty happy with it although i run a 12600k  in and still using my old 1050 ti
Man, I'm sick of seeing cash-grabbing companies like this... They work so hard to establish a good brand and then f*** it up when the going's easy. Good video Jay and thanks for always standing by the right thing!
Sill gona buy the ROG ally though....
I got a 7800x3D and a Asus B650 at the launch, now i'm stuck on this isht, in HWInfo Vsoc (in the CPU tab, which is 0.04V higher than Mobo tab) seems to peak at 1.28V with EXPO on, and keeping it without Expo for now and can't return it ...
Huge dump on ASUS, and on their day of the official Ally reveal 🤣. To be honest they deserve it, I also had bad experience with them the past year, ROG and ASUS is not for me anymore and my 2 budding gamer daughters who unfortunately think ROG is the best thing since sliced bread. I will be showing them this video.  Keep up the excellent work!
Jay never change my friend respect bro
Why are companies making decisions that could completely destroy them en masse recently... I always liked ASUS products but this is just... worse than a cheap scam
This is what is called doing your job. Asus take note, not shortcuts follow Jay-Z2cents example.
Their stupid Armory Crate garbage was enough for me to really dislike the brand.  If I install W11 offline it shouldn't be able to self install their crap control software.
Thanks Jay for making this video and helping the distraught Asus customers. It seems something is goin on with Asus, they are not the same as they were, their quality and their customer experience is not what it was.  I bought an ROG strix B-650 E from Newegg back in October for the next generation AMD (7950X) back in October 2022. Everything worked fine.  Until about the 3 month mark. I shut it down one evening about 4-5 pm. And tried to get back on at 8-9 pm and it never came back.  I tried many things. New power supply, new chip from AMD, and nothing.  They charged me twenty something dollars just to RMA and send it back! And then they claimed there were two bent pins and wanted 140 something dollars!  As a PC builder since the late 90's with many successful builds, this insults me as a PC builder.  They claimed I had a right to disagree, I disagreed, they sent the board back to me. Now it dwells in the box behind the seat in my truck. I may never use Asus again now!
I used to always use Asus boards, but I had a bunch of issues with my last build and went MSI this time. Genuinely my most enjoyable build (not all msi/asus obviously, but it played a part) and it's been perfectly stable so far.
Really love to see when someone stood up to corporate bs
Much respect to you for not selling out and staying true..... New level of respect for you and the channel ! Just kudos to you, a hugely refreshing move.
"the graphics card department has been really solid" idk man Ive seen countless *EXTREME* coil whine videos on their new 40 series cards.
Glad I’ve switched to MSI for my new build. Seems like their reputation for bad RMA support is back
My latest iteration of my self build (7950X) was sat on an ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero, my first purchase of an Asus MB (which cost a fortune). Never before have I had so many problems with a build. Lots of different parts were used to identify the problem - which ultimately pointed to the MB. The faults were varied and inconsistent - so the return RMA didn't show the problem I listed. As such I then approached Asus who basically told me it is nothing to do with them as their products "are exceptional and go through strict quality control, and through the tone of their message told me I'm an idiot." I vowed there and then never again to buy any Asus products. Good on you Jay.
Trash company.  Their Z690 lineup was total disaster.   It is good time for MSI to shine ! now.  Their 4000 series GPU PCB is amazing. 4090 Suprim have the BEST PCB among all ( excl HOF ) and best looking  MSI also have the most stable motherboards aswell. I hope Kingpin goes to MSI and revive kingpin brand there.   Long live MSI 🙏
Even more of a reason to not like asus 👍
It's pity that their new handheld just came out. That might cushion the share price impact, which is probably the most potent mechanism for their board to actually do anything to address this behaviour.
Man, i really should have waited a couple mothns before buying my computer so i could avoid buying asus products. Didn't have any problems with it, but they clearly they don't deserve money.
Not surprised by this. Asus took a year of having my ROG board and countless emails to finally refund me. I’ve boycotted them since.
My asus rog strix 670E-F wifi has not blown yet 😊. Have the beta version 1404 beta with expo enable and manual SoC 1,22-1,25V.  Really hope nothing have happened :(
My take on it from ASUS is you you screwed up by Asus AM5 board which of used will kill your CPU and board but we will try and help you here is a bios you can down load but if you use it you can't claim anything if the board still dies and kills CPU. Then try and pass whole problem of as AMD to be at fault.  Basically we got your money now go away.
next time put hints of it sooner... we always get info when its really widespread problem. I have built all asus setup because everywhere I looked it had good reviews.
Im so glad to life in germany. I can just send stuff back without saying why. Saving my ass in a bad case. Asrock was bad back then. So funny there are better then asus now.
Why would ASUS even mention FOIA? That's for requesting documents from Federal agencies only.
Is that Megaman X back there?
I’m still a fan of ASUS boards, but they have without a doubt had an increasing number of quality problems that have been very public. I think the AM5 problems are overblown somewhat, in terms of number of effected users, but it’s obviously not a good show. I think ASUS like a lot of companies have spread themselves too thin, they also have way too many products on offer especially on the motherboard side. It’s no wonder their quality is slipping, frankly I think they need to get back to basics.
My X670E Hero gave errors, when I removed the CPU the pins where bent, when I put my CPU in it it was ok, send it ro RMA hope they will replace it
lol i just cancelled my ASUS motherboard orders i don't have time to deal with this shit  Awesome Jay thanx for the Heads up
ive been having crashes/blue screens asus z690 hero/12900k.. anyone else?
Well done Jay!! Asus will be falling not from a high horse, but from a skyscraper if they don't change their attitude. Late 90's and early 00's I only used Asus mobo's for builds. Now I avoid them like the plague.
Oh man, I know what you feel. I had a couple of new boards with bent pins and it is extremely hard to prove who is to blame :( Here is my story with Asus which is still ongoing :( I work in a company that rents gaming computers. Last year we built a fleet of a 110 brand new PCs with 12700K/32GB RAM/Asus RTX 3070Ti TUF OC. We got the card recommendation from Asus representative who helped us with our prices/shipping etc. and he knew exactly how are we using the computers which means they are made for travel in special cases with wheels and foam inside. We always took their Dual (150 pcs) series but since we wanted to make more premium looks we went with TUF series. Of course such big cards had to be properly supported so we took Lian LI Anti sag brackets that are simple and stealthy. After the first come back from an event that took around 3 months I had to sent over 25 cards for RMA. We contacted Asus and they told us its not possible and we sure were mining on them!! That was the sign that they are starting to back up from every responibility and we had to explain to them that these GPUs were sitting in computers and traveling from one event to another. Turns out their (GPUs) quality is so low that they start to bend during the shipping even with addition anti sag bracket (go look JayZTwoCents video about GPU sag and check for Asus and you will know what i mean). It has been almost a year and I sent them over 60 cards with unique serial numbers and many of them went over 2-3 times for RMA. Since we are a company and not end customer we cant simply return them so the game is still going. Anyway, whoever is dealing with Asus right now I wish you all the best because lately it was a nightmare
wow just brought a asus strx z790 f gaming and felling really worried for my pc
"....but you don't care."    Nice touch snapping the end shut on this one.  Love you guys.
This is why i haven't used asus in any of my builds in the past 18 years. Got tired of crappy quality and their BS customer "service".
👍
Asrock is quality these days and still innovative.
This is nothing too surprising for me really. Years back i had a Asus 970 Pro Gaming Aura and that mainboard had Issues all over the Place, Drivers cant be updated, CPU wasnt initialized properly and so on and so on. Now im using a TUF Gaming and im impressed on how easily Updating and shit is with TUFs Armory. Works absolutely solid.
welp, makes it easy for me. I've been on Gigabyte boards for 13 years (with no problems, btw) and wanted to try out ASUS this year, but nah, I'll pass.
Respect. I haven't used ASUS since the 7700k on a TUF mobo and it worked perfectly for years at 5ghz. When I finally upgraded to use the new AMD chips, I RMA'd 2 mobos and returned the 3rd before switching to Gigabyte. The only thing I have left that is ASUS is a 27in gaming monitor I use as an 2nd screen. I'm now more open to trying different mobo brands.
Major props jay….
Several years ago my new ASUS laptop lid broke due to a faulty hinge. ASUS's response was that because nobody else had a problem with the hinge then it's not a warranty problem 🤔
The pandemic made things worse, QC went down to hell
I mean, their brand name is Asus. the word SUS is literately in their name. lol I have an Asus AM4 motherboard, I always have problems with that one too.
I saw the issue with JayZ replacement z790 gun metal/white board was a shorted bent soldered pin set up so it was a bent pin that was also bridging to 2 others that is a crazy socket screw up shame on Asus
I applaud this decision and will not recommend or even get anywhere near Asus for me and friends, family as by principle i cannot recommend a company that is so far up its own arse, it devalue's their quality and charging high prices. My latest product i bought was the Asus Thor 850watt and it has a noisy bearing in it, i could send it back for that but i will know i will get another noisy unit back because it's, well Asus!!!!  What a shame.
Never really liked the logo show off and other non sense wrote all over their products and it's why i never picked anything from them and now glad i never did.
Thanks Jay now I will go with Gigabyte motherboard for my AM5 build
I almost bought an Asus board when my Corsair PSU killed my pc second time... It was too expensive to its features so I bought an MSI Mpg x570s edge for the same price as the TUF B550. It looks like I dodged another bullet there.
Ugh this sucks for me. I'm looking to upgrade soon and I've loved ASUS for over a decade. My current build ROG STRX 2070 Super, ROG STRX Z-490-F Gaming mobo for a 10700k, and three ASUS monitors. Was looking to get an ASUS TUF Z790-plus with a 13600k and a TUF 4070. First nVidia disappointed and now ASUS, so there goes that potential build. I may just wait till November to upgrade and hope my 2070 can keep chugging lol.
Commenting so more people see this. F anti consumer companies!
Asus never give a f... Sinple
Was looking to build an ITX AM5. Build this year I will be giving ASUS a wide bearth now.
Well done! Jayz - this is what is expected from YTbers! Some credibility - and this is great to have a spine you can keep your head on! Well done! We can live without A$$us products reviews!
I came , i saw, and i don't do ASUS anymore.
Applause!  Applause!  I think you did a fantastic service to ALL Asus consumers present and future.  Thank you!!
My personal rig is Ryzen 9 7950X3D with ROG X670E-E, and I'm terrified. I put a lot of money into this build and I don't know what to do any more, I guess I'm done with ASUS.
Would be nice if this were a reality check for @ASUS, but they don't really actually care.  Only thing that matters to them is if they can line their pockets by putting out the CHEAPEST, yet most OVERPRICED garbage they can...
Is the ASUS ROG Ally the Steam Deck killer?
Okay so I avoid buying asus stuff especially their motherboards but which motherboards of other brands should I buy instead?
Too much drama about getting your free board white board, could you not have bought it? Seems a bit of toys out the cradle 'cos you're not getting what you want. This aside, for us that are less privaleged, ASUS have slipped with their quality which is a shame as, for me, they have been reliable and my goto for the last 3 decades.
Ok, so no more Gigabyte and ASUS for me then.
Now I'm scared to go through with building my pc cous its gonna cost me 10k but now idk if it's gonna work
Pretty solid video. That last setence though... oof. You're right. They really don't care, until it starts affecting their wallet.
Their UK RMA support is a shambles! Sent a 3 month old laptop for repair after a motherboard failure and they sent a different laptop back with a scratched screen and missing screws 😂.
I'm glad I bought an asrock gpu lol. Asrock being better than Asus is hilarious.
Go get a playstation 5 instead of this box with crape stuff inside and with RGB lights and cannot get 30 fps at 4k and with that prices like 1000 s $
super respect Jay!!
I feel you on this, I built a system in December with a Z690-E and Everything about the board worked great and worked excelent EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!! The Line in On the Audio of the board, is LOW LOW LOW volume despite the windows settings being normal volume levels and SOMETIMES the volume level JUMPS back up to where it SHOULD BE One of my Primary Functions I use my computer for is Digitizing my Collection of Vinyl Records which I NEED to haveThe following Audio Chain Always functioning  Technics EPC-U25 Phono Cartrigdge > Technics SL-D212 Turntable > SU-V16 Stereo Integrated Amplifier Phono Input > SU-V16 Stereo Integrated Amplifier Tape 2 Output > My PC  Previously I was on a I7 4xxx machine in a gigabyte board and The LINE IN worked perfectly Previously to that I was on an E8400 Machine with an ASUS P5Q-Pro andf the LINE IN worked FLAWLESSLY  MY solution to this for this motherboard was to add a SoundblasterX AE5Plus PCIE Sound card to the system for $200CAD Just so I could get PROPER LINE IN LEVELS.  No amount of googling or updating etc etc could get it working properly. Sure I could force windows to absolutely crank the line in volume just to get normal levels but that doesn't help when 3 minutes into a recording it jumps back up to normal levels and stays there for about a minute before falling back off... It was MADDENING and thankfully My entire collection had been digitized already except for ONE SINGLE new album I just bought at that time so I wasn't out a lot of time, I just was forced to listen to the same Eagles track (Witchy Woman) I selected as a test recording (As I knew it was a song that I knew every note of intimately) over and over and over again.  Every post I found online said "Do xyz" and every time I tried "xyz" there was no fix, and the posts I made myself just said "Do XYZ' and when I said I allready tried that they were like "Well I don't know then"  And since everything else about this build has been solid I said screw it this is one time where throwing money at a problem is easier than throwing time at it (via an RMA) and just bought the sound card.
As a system builder, historically I've build with Asus for 26 years... My current personal rig has a Asus Tuf b650 in it. I'm not only going to swap that board but move to another brand for all my builds for customers. I have very little confidence in their boards now. Steve at GN nailed the investigation into the exploding 7800x3d chips, Jay has rightfully dropped Asus and I would expect a lot more folk dropping them too. Its a real shame. But they have to put customers first!!
I have only bought ASUS products ever since Aopen dissapeared from the market...and thats a pretty long time ago.  Will be looking elsewhere in the future for sure.
Sweeping their own Shit under the Carpet has now become a Hurdle too high to overcome🧐
Well done Jay 👍
I really appreciate my MSI MB… except the look and it’s RGB effect, lol. 😂
Hey Jay what mobo from another brand would you recommend to compete with what the X670E Hero is supposed to be? I just refunded mine and refuse to buy another ASUS product ever again. I really wish EVGA would come in clutch and release a X670E mobo.
To get the same "quality" and especially the basic FEATURE SET of the previous gens I had to get the top of the line INSANE priced top end model motherboard for my 7950. It's insane. Luckily I work a job that lets me afford that kind of thing, but I am not happy about it. ASUS. Been using their parts for well over a decade now but this is really dissapointing from them. I guess the writing was really on the wall then they started pushing their malware-esque "armoury crate".
Jay is one of us. I don’t understand how people can hate on him and the team behind him when they do things like this and they’ve been saying it million time that they stand by us first and foremost then the brands. Love this channel and what it stands for.
Well done for the video Jay. Another choice is not to buy amd stuff.
been subbed since 2014, haven't been watching much content so i missed out on alot, but this video solidified why i always loved this channel, no BS or filters, Kudos Jay
And I guess no no more Asus then.
Fun facts: In SEA region, its 99% impossible to get RMA/warranty. They only care if its a high end product line. All mid to low end they just shaft you support and website links. Funny this is also quite similar with Samsung behavior in SEA
Just another reason not to waste money building a PC in the present climate ...
I have been a loyal ASUS customer for the last 13 Years but after having trouble with both of the last two Mobo's I purchased from ASUS my zeal for their products has pretty much completely faded. I used to be SF Hype on all the products I bought from ASUS, I had nothing but good experiences I would've recommended them to anybody. Now, in good conscience I can't recommend them, it's too big of an investment to build a custom PC there are cheaper, and more reliable options.
This is true Asus products are very low quality. I bought ROG Keris mouse and it is a good mouse but 2 side buttons on the side sometimes work and sometimes dont. I set them to work as copy and paste, it is mostly Armoury Crates fault.
I have always been an ASUS supporter but in the last 2 to 3 releases I have seen multiple problems and shitty customer support!!! They had a reputation of great customer support but this has been eroded to a point of a negative. I am looking for a replacement for my next build but haven't seen a stand out replacement. The only motherboard that I have seen to be decent is ASrock Taichi. I have never liked them before but I have seen the least problems with them.
But it took you this long to do something about it lol.
i had 2x ASRock boards, never had any issues, 1 Gigabyte - same, and i bought Asus x570 board for estetics, asus soft is garbage with lot of bloat, not speaking that it sometimes not boot on cold boot, weird RAM oc problems after BIOS updates, problems with RGB control and so on
Damn, I have an order for Asus Strix X670E F coming in. Seriously considering in just sending it back. The only reason I'm in this situation is because Gigabyte x670E aorus master is E-ATX and I have no idea if it fits the case or not. Gigabyte is solid in terms of board quality, no complaints on x570s aorus master. Love that board
Maybe they dont care. They will notice. I have been over Asus and Nvidia since lockdown and their contributions to the massive upswing in prices and downfall in consumer respect and products that are minimal upgrades. I buy my kids components and it will not be either of these brands ever again. In the future they will buy their own and their kids components and it wont be forgotten they got more from amd and asrock/msi.
I cant wait to see the I'm sorry NVIDIA... but you're fired! when nextgen AMD gpu's release and AMD have their ryzen moment with gpu's
I was going to upgrade to an ASUS ROG B550 motherboard. But this video has changed my mind. I think I will stick with Gigabyte and get a B550 from them.
easy fix for me my next pc will have no asus products inside it simple
Bud Light Assus
My first choice to upgrade to the AM5 platform was the ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi motherboard. After seeing all the ASUS shenanigans, I settled on the MSI MPG X670E CARBON WIFI.  Thank you for the info Jay!
Bruh,   Exactly like you said Jay “Asrock used to be the brand where you go ‘ah! Avoid that brand!’ And Asus’s ROG bull crap prints money”  100% Before this video, I’d have stayed far from Asrock, as in the past (x370, b350, B450, z99, h91, h97) I had issues with their boards  Had nothing but great things to say about Asus, though my last Asus board was a x370 one  Looks like I’m sticking with MSI, I have a x570 from them that has been nothing but perfect, and I won’t be going to Asus, might even try Asrock again for friend’s builds
I would stick with AMD and ditch ASUS for your home build if for nothing else than to see if you continue to have these problems. If replacing the ASUS components results in the stability problems being solved then you will know and we will know soon after. 😉
Good on you Jay , could I have the Asus gear you don't want 😂
I realy hope my ASUS bord woun´t kill my CPU, i actualy wait for the case to start my build. IF it happens i gues i ll never buy again from ASUS.
So what's the best alternative for motherboards? Gigabyte? MSI?
Good
Well show me a AM5 ITX Board like the B650e from ASUS that has the same specs from a different manufakturer. No choice but to go asus.
The latest bios v2305 on asus z690 strix is also causing instability with xmp causing crashes and BSOD
he said asus software support... they've never supported crap.
ahhh....I wanted to get an asus newest board for a 13th gen upgrade to replace my old asus z270 board but dang......oh asus was my goto brand back in 2017
Solid credibility - full credit to you
Dont Delete this video , After 1 year you gone have again ASUS ... Money speaks to most of Youtubers
Dang I just had my gigabyte board fail on me and got an Asus. Not a huge MSI fan. Running out of vendors!
If only I have other choices for the build I'm aiming for with my budget :(
That started a while ago ... Undervolting Raptor Lake on B-Boards .. works fine on MSI, Gigabyte... on Asus you need to change to the older Microcode in order to run a undervolt of 0.05V+. If you use the latest microcode.. there will be a massive Performance Impact... Clock Stretching at its finest...
Respect Jay for respecting the consumer
Yes, problems happen. Alot of things went wrong in the last while. I personally installed and managed over 30 asus mobo based pc's and had 0 issues. It's not representative, but I do wonder if the situation of Jay is also representative. Protect us, yes, mock and comment on quality and all the insane price bumps, yes. But it's not as black and white. Asus is the biggest producer and I expect better. Jay also knows they might improve and things could change over the time, so lets come back to this video in a year or two and see if the "blacklisting" stuff by Jay is still relevant.
For years and years I have always said 'in ASUS we trust', turns out they stabbed us all in the back, thank you Jay for keeping it real and looking out for the little guys as always,
Wow...Lets hope Asssus doesnt do business with Pinkertons 😅
At least no one uses ECS any more... lol
There are only two words anyone needs to sum up how terrible ASUS is with software (and firmware): Armoury Crate.  I rest my case.
My last 3 builds... everytime i had issues with my Asus Motherboard and had to return it.   1. USB connecting and disconnecting sound every 10 seconds 2. LAN port didn't work. 3. Crushed pins on the CPU socket.  I really don't understand why asus has such a good reputation. And on top, every time i returned the Boards i had problems with the customer service.
Yep, that's why I switched to Gigabyte for my AMD build ! 👌
I just sent in a Rapture AXE 11000 and they RMA said replaced due to no power. The device was just swapped out. They didn’t look at my issue at all. I specifically told them Wired speed and 2.4 GHz wifi issues.
Are they hiding a bigger problem and want to wash their hands of the liability????, hoping new users infected with this problem will choose to go for that BIOS and wipe their warranty.
No more ASSus
Lmao ASUS mobos are garbage, 2 generations (possibly more) and they still haven't fixed their ethernet port/drivers. Nothing but problems from my experience. Only product I have from them is a 1440p 270 hz monitor. And I am praying to god nothing goes wrong with this monitor.
My takeaway from this video: Jay is streaming, time to follow.
That looks like backwards power diode, which makes it very bad 😅
I had an old ASRock board for my i7 3770. That thing seemed like it would last until the heat death of the universe.
I had similar issues for the past few generations of AMD boards from ASUS. I had been using their boards since Intel 2000. I ended up bailing to try new vendors and I'm so glad I did, I've had 0 issues with my new boards.
AMD should still do something about this and ask their partner "WTF ARE YOU DOING?" because this is their brand image as well. Anyway, thanks for both informing us and doing the right thing Jay!
I have always said and will continue to say MSI all the way
My Z790-E has been buggy as hell since I got a few weeks ago. Sometimes it just doesn’t post.
Steady decline huh? Remember the early 2000s even Asus were the flagship brand? I wonder if ESG had anything to do with it. Affirmative action, corruption and effective negligence of what really matters.
I have built every PC in my life with Asus boards since 2004. Unless Asus seriously owns up to this, the X670e Hero will be my last.
Didn't Steve of Gamer Nexus do this with MSI a few years back? I wonder how long it will be before Jay puts out a similar video for MSI
That´s a huge move for you Jay, i respect that. But for me personally i lost interesst more and more for ASUS especially the Rog Versions of every Product. The Prices are way, waaaay to high. They elivate themself above the market and in Germany you need 30-40% more Money if you want to buy the Rog stuff and that sucks.
I am stuck with my Asus B650 A Gaming wifi board for now but thanks for the video :D
I fired Asus as a brand back in oh 2002/3 due to Asus A7V motherboards having the chinese buldging caps problem... I haven't used a single Asus product since. Fired MSI after several boards bit the dust for 0 reason back in 2007-10.
What is your opinion a gigabyte boards?
And all this right after I spent $700 on ASUS product ...
there RMA support is non existent  i still have a GPU that's dead and they just don't respond in a timely fashion  they just don't care anymore
This is f*ckin´worriesome now that I just ordered an Ally...
its such a pity really. used ASUS parts for years and my Zenbook Flip13 is a really nice OLD display laptop. I had the same dilemma getting a whit motherboard for a build. I went for the nzxt z790. really nice looking board, behaves well. gives a very Monty Python murder rabbit/ imperial storm trooper vibe coupled with my jonsbo white mod 3 case
Unfortunatelly I can relate to the ASUS brand issues... Have a ROG Zephyrus G14 2022 and ohh man it is sketchy. Have it sincs November and driver issues up and down, the processore base settinng is set to aggressive boosting which caused by CPU to run at 1350mV all the time (at 90 C), display had to be changed after a month due to pixel issues, fan is clipping after it was changed, my webcam died a month ago(cannot use face recognition), crashing every few days despite having the latest drivers all the time. I am an engineering student who uses the laptop for a lot of stuff and it is annoying to deal with this sort of stuff. If you know a small laptop powerful enough that isnt 2500 bucks also please let me know, cuz I am looking for a change. I hope everyone will have all there pc in one peace while running ASUS parts. ASUS good advice: Less fricking models, more engineers and developers on each product and maybe you wouldn't be in this deep shithole :D  Have a nice day everyone!
4:50 I had one of those. Wery dissapointing when all your build is done and motherboard just burnout at first day. Good that i not do anything with bios (i wanted but motherboard burned faster.  Like in general Asus was a decent company for long years and seem that they forget what gives them their position.,
Thank you.
I respect this channel and have followed it since I started into pcgaming. I am spending $5k in June on my new build which for me is A LOT of money!  I had planned out my build and was going to buy a Asus motherboard. Not anymore! MSI here I come. I am still going to get the 7800x3d tho.
The problem is you're using AMD a dog shit platform.
Software support for ASUS? AI Suite 3 anyone? That thing is so annoying....
Money is the root of all evil 😈 😈 thank you Jayz
Asus and Gigabyte are really falling off
Thank you for an this info. Sadly, I have a asus board right now. If I didn't I wouldn't get one now for sure.! Thanks again!
I have a asus rog strix b550-f and got a ryzen 7 5800x3d i updated my bios a week ago after i got the cpu, should i be worried? I haven't seen any stability issues. The only weird thing is my temp shot to 83 celcius but then went down back to around 45 - 50 which is where it idles. I have a 360mm gallahad AIO push pull config cooling it. Im now nervous to use my rig
i use to always love asus. recommended to family for prebuilts laptops.. this annoys me. i stopped buying them are the b450 cus i got 2 or 3 dead boards. so i went to gigabyte and MSI.. i cant even recommend them anymore.. they have fallen. alot
Dodge z690 formula boards asus is all about money not quality or performance
Shots fired..
And here We've been thinking Gigabyte was the bad one .
God damm just as I brought a Asus GPU I find out all this 😢
just bought the x670e extreme last month. no problems so far. feels bad man. i'm nervous now. :(
2016 I bought a new shiny ROG G752VY Laptop - the ascetics were of the charts for me. It had a price of 2300€ and for that I got a 6700HQ CPU and 980M GTX GPU and I was happy. I was until they had to replace the motherboard only two weeks after I bought it, dont remember the problem but it was something that was widespread so not only my laptop was affected only to get it back without the keyboard backlighting - ok this was the fault of the repair shop but still left a bitter taste in my mouth. The two left USB ports NEVER to this day worked properly in supplying enough power to the external WD drive, I still using a 0.25m USB extension cable because when I don't, the ext. disk disconnects couple of times in a minute. Also weird sleeping issues where i put the laptop to sleep and it wakes up all on its own for no reason.  They never fixed it, never cared so I am also done with this brand.
I payed 400$ for an x570 strix board and I get this like intermittent crashing or stuttering like once every week or 2 ever since I built the system.  Never going back to them myself either.  My last gigabyte and asrock systems were 100% solid. I'm going back to them or msi next build. My audio drivers from the asus website also don't install correctly. Their stuff is complete overpriced garbage.
Not just their motherboards, their laptops are plagued with issues too and on top do nothing to fix the issue.  I’m mainly referring to my issues with their Strix Advantage Edition with a 6800M.  My current set up has zero Asus product, and I’m glad.  MSI hasn’t let me down and my Dell 3080 10gb 😂 is amazing!
I'm so glad ASUS raised their prices for their new motherboards that made them too expensive for my build (literally almost 200€ more than their competitors). So I went for an MSI board with A LOT of features that ASUS had not on that price range. And it has not been without problems, but nothing they didn't fix ASAP. In just 2 days they solved my issue. I only had ASUS products for like 15 years... Never again as they're selling "premium" products with crazy high prices built like shit.  Massive thanks to you & Steve for standing up against shitty anti-consumers companies!
I'm happy to see this type of content because I just wanted to buy a AM5 Asus motherboard. At this moment I probably going to switch to a Gigabyte or a Asrock. Because I don't have the money or patience to deal with something like this. Rather safe than sorry.
This is disheartening to hear as someone who has been using/liked ASUS stuff for 10+ years and hasn't had any major issues. But if they are going to down the anti-consumer -apple- route, I think it may be time to try different companies.  Covid really fucked up the tech space hasn't it? (Obviously not the only thing) The big price hike of 2020/2021 *cough* -nvidigreed even till now- *cough*, companies being lazy and/or having more QA issues when they were at acceptable levels before, lying nivigreed -and AMD- selling mining cards but saying "wHaT mInInG cArDs?"
I'm gonna change my motherboard to Asrock Taichi next.....LOL
+ 1000 Respect 👍
I went Inno3d this time around because i needed a SFF 4070ti, 2 months in and my top fan just exploded under normal use. Great warranty tho.  Asus has been like this since the mid 2000's btw... they used to be THE brand for good stuff but just started phoning in the quality.
Basically this is why you should not download beta bios updates; am I correct?
Great... I regret buying an ASUS MoBo and afraid using my PC...
I called up Asus when the BETA came out, they said yes it's safe to install, I stated what they stated about making the Warranty Void, they said "well you can always roll back BIOS" I asked him how am I supposed to do this if YOUR Bios FRIES my MOBO...their response was NOTHING! Call them and see for yourselves - I suggest RMA their crap back until they decide to actually FIX it without screwing over the consumer. Even Better GET YOUR CASH BACK - A FULL REFUND ;) Screw the RMA process if U can hit them where it HURTS!
good call
Woah, my planned build involve Asus parts, guess Im going to look for another brand then
Lookin forward to the class action for the people they manipulated with their warranty.
Finally, I didn't comprehend how all of the tech space was defaulting to them with all the bad stuff I kept hearing about them the last five years
I have an Asus Prime X670E-PRO WIFI. Coil whine for days. Never again.
This whole thing reminds me of the ASUS B350 board I had and how I was constantly getting blue screens with it. All this makes a lot more sense now. I know B350 was AM4, but it shows a lack of effort on their part to try and address problems we have with their products. After talking to many other users, I found that B350 was a shaky platform to begin with and ASUS didn't help. Time to move on from them.
Will ASUS be Bud lightend? 😂 They should
I have an ASUS laptop. It's about 4 yrs old and I have had no hardware issues.
Jay this is why we watch creators like you, thank you so much!! Do you know where I can get a list of problem boards? I want to know if mine is one of them. I have the Strix B550-A Gaming
Really makes you want to buy a ROG Ally.
Yesterday I check update for x570 am4 crosshair hero and realize that my actual bios version got remove from the web, gone, delete. It was a official realese no beta version. Since i update bf 2042 ain't a better game 😅 but atleast I don't crash every 30 min of Playtime
If one doesn't want to support such scammy practices, which manufacturer should you go with? There basically are only 4: Asus and MSI are out, I don't know about Gigabyte and AsRock is owned by Asus... I only found one Biostar (x670e) and 2 NZXT (x650) motherboards as alternatives.
The problem exists across the electronics retail industry and software companies, they do not test properly anymore and push it out for customers to test for them saving the cost on testing, while saying they have customer service but it's a sham they do not really care about you as a customer, they just need to have to prove they have customer service for the Government Standard they need, time for Government surprise auditing of these companies.
now that is what you call: "putting your foot down". integrity up there.
As you very well may remember, it was about 4 generations ago, maybe more, asus said something about aiming to charge more for products, When a company says that, i simply think, well, Nothing has got better so it will just get worse, Look where we are now.  There really isnt any pride in the brand the past few years IMO, part of this is why i have ended up with intel, (nuc) because their products often get supported for ages, even if you dont need it.
i mean providing a broken bios to the public and having problems getting free hardware are very different kind of issues 🤣
Last time I ever buy Asus, last thing I need is to waste days trying to solve problems.
waiting for Maxsun to come out with  a am5 motherboard so i can swap out my Asus motherboard I wont be using this company anymore.
Rip asus.
Got to love privileged 1st world problems eh?
It seems to me that AMD should drop Asus like a bad habit
Been with Asus, there were some issues, next 3 builds based on gigabyte parts - no issues so far. 10th egn, 12th gen, 13th gen intel, RTX 3060, 3070, 4090 no issues so far. Basically much better experience for me.
I find it very odd as my experience with Asus has been nothing like this, Except bad hardware at times, but its always been RMA'd & no issues, Obviously I didn't touch the AMD this time around & not denying the obvious current  issues. I've had far more issues to date for over 20 years with Gigabyte/Aorus But they also have RMA'd everything even after warranty at one time, But even the brand new RMA replacement has had issues before. So yeah I find it Odd, I will still be buying Asus, but not AMD or Gigabyte after my last set of issue so much.....
I have a bad experience with the motherboard I have in my new PC. Exact same RAM and motherboard being used in machines I built at work and those are all good. But for me. I can't OC my RAM. So I told ASUS end of last year to dive it and won't use their hardware in New machines
I literally got my Asus motherboard the day the first 7800x3D CPU got destroyed. Fortunately I have had no issues with the board so far, but damn man. Asus was meant to be that solid brand, literally everyone on reddit would recommend it for most build queries. This is sad, now I'm forced to open up my pc this weekend, just to make sure my CPU isn't slowly getting cooked. Really hope I don't have to go through this whole RMA process
It's totally ridiculous that after paying the ROG Tax since everything Asus is the most expensive on the market you get absolutely shafted.... Starting to regret having a X670E Hero now.....
Not long ago, I experienced some of the same issues.. and then my windows user profile got corrupted.  I think now I finally know what the source is. Jay thank you for your open and honest content
Also for 7000 owners. Set the SOC yourself. I have mine at 1.25v while running 6200mhz ram. You don't even need 1.3v either. Silicon lottery aside
But what fix voltage problem is not beta bios. I have to know I install it 5-9 days ago. So I'm confusede. It's  BIOS 1303
Fair play sir!
Anheuser-Busch, ASUS, Toyota, what happen to those big brand lately?
this is why stability is more important than performance, and that's why I prefer Intel if I was building for my friends or colleagues PC (if they didn't know anything about computer). It is more stable and freaking usable.   I know I sounds like an Intel fanboy or anything, but I also build several AMD based system and based what I saw, Intel is much more preferable from most people prespective.
Wanted to buy an asus motherbored, now will go with asrock
Thanks to you and also Steve and everyone for trying to raise awareness and to protect the consumer, when brands plan to double cross them.
Complaining about free product seems weird
Sad to see asus go this route. Hopefully they see the light soon.
ASUS is charging premium for their products and they act like a badly managed startup... Just... Last time I've been buying ASUS was because I really liked their products a couple of years ago but I just bought a mobo and I chose another brand over ASUS because of ridiculous pricing AND the fact that before making this decision I saw a few gripes with their products. I had no idea they went this far though...
I wouldn't stop at ASUS.. Had exact same problems with ASRock regarding bios updates. About two years ago installed beta bios on my AM4 taichi board and it stopped posting after that. ASRock refused to replace board saying that my warranty was void because I used beta bios. I did manage to get it replaced after about a week of arguing with them. My wife has x670 Aorus elite ax which has bottom most row of USB's randomly losing power. And oh boy I was happy to find out about the exploding issue 3 days after my x670e hero + 7900x3d arrived(im on  1303 right now and it looks fine so far)...  But what gets me really mad is that this issue is affecting all vendors due to AMD providing wrong specs and only way I heard about this stuff is because I regularly watch tech videos.
Personally I've had always issues with Asus stuff, it was always garbage in my opinion. I was always happy with Gigabyte and MSI stuff, those are brands I go with every time.
lol I was going to start with "Wow" also but it seems everyone else has already. I have to say Jay If you ,and Steve were to start a Gpu/Mother board company ...... Just saying... We all know we could trust your products. This is what I respect about both of your channels is the fact you call'em like you see'em. That says Integrity, trust, and care for you customers above all else. Mucho respect for you both.
This is so off topic and a bit random, but feels like The Cycle: Frontier. Yager needs to be schooled like this from someone big.
Their B450 boards killed me. Random never being able to boot. Trying 10 times. Sent it back they said nothing wrong. And yet. No amount of troubleshooting would get it to boot. Changed to gigabyte. Was very happy. And now. B650 on MSI. Other than the bios battery being DOA as the box pushes the reset button continually. It's very smooth. Lol
I was going to upgrade to Asus gaming laptop but not now lol.
i wonder if this is impacting my X570 F-Gaming board. Been having stability issues since the december of `22. Random crashes and shit, tested everything and all components seem ok, but never tested the mobo. i havent turned on my pc like 3-4 months now for that...
Call me a brand fanboy, but I have exclusively been running ASRock boards in my builds since 2007 and I have never regretted it once. Not a single dead board. Except from onboard LAN ports saying sayonara, they have worked flawless for me.
pure definition of "How to put yourself into the middle of a sh*tstorm". Well done, ASUS! in the last 10 years I had only boards from them (for Intel CPUs). next won't be. but then what?
When asrock is a better product than asus, they fucked up big time.
Thanks Jay, I have used Asus for my last 2 PC's. Now looking for an upgrade and will look beyond Asus
Well this is a kick in the nuts. I've always liked ASUS products and still use an ASUS 1070ti + MB, because they were the most dependable and sturdy in my experience. This is sad, because I wanted to upgrade to a 3000 series later on.
I was thinking about upgrading my rig this year... but i guess not.    Thought a new AMD CPU sounds good. Has memeory stability issues because it is a new generation.  Though a new ASUS mortherboard sounds good. Fries your CPU and lights your house on fire.  Thourght a new NVIDIA cards sounds good. So overpriced that I have to sell both my lungs to get one. Heavy enough to break a mortherboard slot. And will also lights my house on fire if I bend a cable wrong.    Geussing I'm just gonna stick with my GTX 970 and Ryzen 5 2600x... I must that my almost 10 year old power supply is still working hard, and properly will for another couple of years 😅
you have the same setup as me at home - im not experiencing the sound issues etc you are having. but its concerning. I will not install any beta firmware on mine tbh
I'm glad we will see much less Repugnant of gaemers bullshit.
The rog products are a bunch of expensive unreliable crap
Definitely not buying anything ASUS at this point.
Dam jay I normally look at your reviews for a lot of my own parts and to see you standing up for the consumer in this way is epic.
Good job. Massive respect from this move.
Got 5 mid level PCs to build over the next 6 months. Asus mb's were going to be in all of them. Now they won't be.
Sigh...the disclaimer says "we cannot guarantee this BIOS works, we're pretty sure it does, but there's a chance it could fail; we're not forcing you to update, if you choose to do so, you do so understanding the risk." It's there because people are too stupid to know what a beta version is. Nowhere does it say anything about voiding your warranty or that you will no longer receive support for the product if you use it. Not sure why nobody seems to understand this. Also not sure why nobody is mentioning Gigabyte or MSI, whose boards are also burning up the 7xxxX3D CPUs for the same apparent issues (which points to a larger issue with the design of the AM5 socket)...MSI also released a beta BIOS to the public, without any warning/disclaimer attached, while Gigabyte literally has "updating your BIOS is risky, we strongly suggest you don't do it unless you're having problems on your current version" as their advice for the issue, yet nobody's saying anything about either of them. Why is that? By all means, blast Asus for the poor QC and support (especially that dumbass "just turn EXPO off" statement they made), but if you're gonna blast one company for it, don't turn a blind eye towards the others that are doing the same thing.
I remember having some issues with an x570 asus tuf board in 2020 for my 3900x build. And during the early days of the pandemic so making things abit toughter to obtain things.  I managed to swap that and go back to MSI where i have had boards for years.   Find myself again back with ASUS mainly i guess because of cost as every x670e board is crazy money. And all this is happening ha. Thank you for the video and sheding a light on this as its crazy to think all this money on these items and they dont seem to give a crap. I guess i should plan to swap this board if amazon will allow it and go back to msi or gigabyte
Those constant donations by US to screw China getting to Taiwan's head
im so happy i went with asrock b650 live mixer this gen lol. soc voltage 1.24v at most with expo and pbo. if both stock disabled (til this blows over) then its onl 1.01v soc voltage peak.
Subscription earned.
I know this is a serious video, but "yo, get Asus on the phone and ask them WHAT THE FUCK" is just hilarious and a-grade comedy materiał.
Outrage! Disgust! Drama! Get some help! Steve can set a snowball on fire, but you Jay... You've just gone bananas! 🍌🍌🍌🍌
Breaking news guys ASUS has stated that responding in this comments section will void your warranty on an ASUS keyboard
am using AMD Ryzen™ 7 7700X Desktop Processor with Asus B650E Chipset but not X670E lucky I have not used it I B650E will be better for Asus had no issues using it if I used X670E I will complain  to Asus about this issues
What happens, when the marketing department gets bigger than the engineering department
Is no mobo-manufacturer good anymore? Asus doing this, MSI getting hacked, gigabyte... releasing untested power supplies. What the hell is happening in the industry??
always had Asus motherboards in my builds, but always combined with intel CPU's and never had issues. only with my latest build, I could not get XMP to work on a TUF GAMING Z690-PLUS WIFI D4  so I switched to an MSI board without having any issues...
I’ve had better experiences with MSI and ASRock. After trying to use an ASUS P6T Deluxe mobo with my Nehalem i7, I dropped them faster than a bad conversation.
Msi ftw
I moved over to MSI for my motherboards when this all started to blow up - "there's no smoke without fire" as they say.  Asus' response to users has been disgusting to say the least.
Sadly, they are the only MB manufacturer with ECC memory support.
Hmmm maybe I should cancel my Rog Ally 🤔 wait for others to test it😂
for the past 20+ years I've always been an Asus fan, had 2 Gigabyte boards and 1 MSI but always went back to Asus especially for monitors but as far as Asus has fallen in the past 3 months they might as well merge with Gigabyte, when it comes time to upgrade to am5 and a new monitor it won't be from Asus!!!!
asus is now a sus
Is Asrock really good? The high tier motherboards of them?
Im glad you done this video, i was holding out until 50 series cards and 8th gen amd or 14ths intel to build a complete ROG build, now ill just use that money and build a gt86 track car haha. Thanks, Jay, Phill, and of Nick for being legends.
Respect man.
EXPO no longer works on my Asus Strix X670E-E Gaming Wifi. I updated thr bios from launch 0514 to 1410. Then downgraded to 13, 12 and 11, my Ram only works at base 4800mhz.  6000mhz was working fine until I updated the bios. And none of the older bios versions are available from asus anymore and I can't find any bios prior to 1105.
Dang I just made a build with the x670e hero and I’ve been having a weird issue where every single day when I first turn on my pc the WiFi will not work until I restart the computer like 4 times. Every single day for a month and I cannot figure it out
let's see how they overcome this PR nightmare
We need to stand up against these companies or they'll take us as pushovers. And hate being called a push over.
I remember when ASUS meant QUALITY.  God I miss those days.
Hey Jay Asus is a Taiwan company. I was about to get the zenfone 9 not sure now.
Interesting that ASRock, a ASUS spin off for cheap boards to compete with Foxconn in the OEM market, became a renown manufacurer while ASUS is doing such a crap. Maybe, if they continue, they will become at one point what ASRock was. A cheap OEM manufacturer.  With this behaviour, they deserve it.
boycott ASUS, problem solved. to teach them a lesson
Recalls are respected. Doing a recall does cause people to wonder why it was released but you gain respect by taking responsibility to fixing a problem with your product. If you think keeping it quiet is better then you have no respect for anything but money because sales will obviously slow till we know the recall issue is fixed.
If you can find a non Asus board that fits the athetic and functionality you want in your personal rig, I'd really like to see if you could stick with AMD just to see how it pans out down the road. Just to make sure any issues are caused by the motherboard and not CPU!
Wauh........ So this system im on, is the last ASUS im on for shure, strix x570 -e, 360 aio and strix 3070 ti, i was a BIG ASUS fanboy, but not any more!!! actually i might go to playstation after this, i really did not like other brands... best video of the year 2023
Even though MSI did a scummy thing during the pandemic with their GPU supply, they make some superior boards in terms of pure performance and connectivity. ASUS has them all beat with aesthetics, except maybe some Aorus stuff for some people but then you have to deal with their crap software.
Here I am with a X670E-A, been running default settings since these burnout started happening.  Hope there comes something soon.  "Good ol'" ASUS ain't what she used to be.
So I just purchased a ASUS - TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI and a AMD - Ryzen 9 7950X3D from Best Buy.    Should I be putting the latest BIOS - the Beta BIOS - for it or not?  This is really annoying.
Thank you Jay.  This is a tough one.  I've been an ASUS fan since the late 90s, and it's so disappointing to see what has happened to the company.  Huge respect to you on putting this out so bluntly.  I just finished an amazing build for myself 2 days ago but instead of going with the 7950x, I went i9 13900K to avoid a meltdown, from what I've heard from you, Steve and Linus lately.  Argh.  But, my Gigabyte AERO Z790E and AERO 4080 built is amazing!  Cheers, keep up the good work.  PS, this drama is approaching the level of Artisan builds 😮
Why would anyone spend that kind of money on a motherboard? Just why??
I almost went Asus and AMD this time around, but then my old rig had a radiator leak in January before the X3D processors came out.  I ended up building a Z790 Classified 13900k rig instead and it's been solid, in fact my favorite build I've ever done.  It's said all things happen for a reason, and damn did I ever dodge a bullet from that radiator failing, I would've been sitting on a fried board and processor right now if it hadn't.
That's the way to do it Jay. Kudos to you Sir.
I wont be going ASUS for my next build. It's the underhanded approach. I like to compare to the more established car market. BMW have recalled my car from me 3 times it is 13 years old 2 of the issues were not dangerous but costly both fixed for free one was on the other hand potentially dangerous. BMW did all of this sending letters and asking in 2 cases for me to come to a local store and 1 case demanding i did so.   The thing is i bought my car second hand and again 2 recalls were arguably not essential. Meanwhile ASUS buries it's head, effectively lies and then buys people off in the hope Gamer's Nexus dont hear about it. No just NO im done thanks ASUS.
Had a friend have issues with Asus back about 16 years ago with customer support, then when I went with my current board Crosshair VI Hero, I was worried but it was the cheapest x370 board I could find made by a "reputable" brand. Worked well with my 1700 and my 5800x3D so far. But after watching this I kinda wish I'd have spent the extra $40 for an ASrock board.
Quit ASUS few years ago. They were just pointlessly overpriced.. This is definitely last nail on the coffin
I'm glad I'm on ASRock.  But they do make nifty routers, guess I'll have to build my own WiFi and router with LTT tutorials
This is unfortunate (for ASUS), but also validating for me. Our wee computer repair shop has just a few brands (or sometimes branch of a brand) on our "suspect" list where if someone's having a major issue, and a suspect could MAYBE cause that symptom, we start by ruling out that part first. Saves us so much time. I'm just the admin assistant, and had very little computer knowledge when I started. I wanted to like ASUS, but our repair tech just shook his head, "No, they're only about looks and hype." After building with a variety of boards at different price points over just the last couple of years, I'd come to the same conclusion (I handle new computer sales). Also, their laptops leave something to be desired when it comes to longevity and reparability (statistically in our shop, anyway). We usually lean toward Gigabyte or MSI depending on the build (I know Gigabyte gets a hard wrap when doing an AMD build, but their BIOS options are the most straightforward and tweakable for Intel CPUs that we've seen, IMO). When building tower servers, we usually have ASUS motherboards, but I'd be lying if we didn't just yesterday retire an entire server because the freaking motherboard died. Like WTF when does that happen in a server, especially one less than 10 years old??  When it comes to RMA, we've had customers have to RMA MSI and Gigabyte for this or that, and it's always been smooth. (Like MSI pump going out, or Gigabyte board needing a new CPU socket because PINs.) For us, how easy it is to handle a defective product is more important than pretty much anything else. For instance, Silicon Power SATA SSD's: not super fast, but they are super cheap, and their RMA process cannot be beat. We track percentage of failures and set our customers up with back-ups, and with hundreds of drives sold, RMA rate hovers around 3%. We choose them for our average mom or pop with an 10-year-old HDD who needs their computer to just work again. We like Western Digital but getting through the RMA process is like pulling teeth, and a bad batch of SA510's have soured us to their blue SATA SSDs (rebranded Sandisk??). I gave up last time I had to RMA RAM to Crucial; zero response. Corsair wants you to run Memtest and then they're like, BAM new RAM for you. Samsung is also pretty decent on RMA, didn't even give us a hard time when a drive only needed a firmware update to fix I/O, and we couldn't smash it into the Magician software right.  I could go on, but, I'm up past my bedtime obviously. Sorry only 10% of this post was on topic. D:
Well that's a turn for the worse. I did my last build around 3 years ago with ASUS and haven't had any issues.  It's sad to see that the company fall so quickly into just another tech company fleecing its customers. Good to see a strong moral stand from the JayzTwoCents team.
Yes the sponsorship from AMD is much bigger LOL....
Wow thanks for waking up to what they have become in the last years. Try other brands gigabyte AsRock msi. All solid options. Gigabyte has also improved a lot I have 3 z690 boards running with 0 issues and one b660 running 24/7 without a problem uptime now 44days running 6 vms.
I wold love to get those boards i can repair them easy got access to microscope to repair electronics.
I’m seriously considering Amazon returning my asus board and getting an msi one even though I’d haves to rebuild most of my build
I have had really bad support for a monitor from them, like 3 bad in a row and then they wanted to replace it with a Used Repaired one and I found that unacceptable as 2 weeks sooner I dropped full price and then they just stopped trying to replace it
So sad that Asus became... this, I liked it, a bit overpriced but looked nice and good quality.
Damn man is this permanent or until they treat consumers better?
you just earned my respect big time. surreal that someone would cancel their sponsorship like that. 99% of other people would just silently never use asus again while reaping the rewards of the sponsorship. massive respect
my x670e crosshair hero looking sus...
Damn, just a few years ago Asus were one of my preferred manufacturers for quality and support. And now with EVGA gone too who takes the number 1 spot? (Do not say MSI, they suck)
Thank you Jay & Steve for speaking up and for pulling a based move! Not a lot of people would choose to (so openly) "fire" their sponsor like you've done.  I've recently built my first PC, and grabbed a couple ASUS parts (ASUS Dual RTX3060Ti & Prime Z690-P Wifi D5) before I'd really jumped into the PC building community/was aware of these issues occurring and being highlighted(?). Catching up with / reading into this whole situation makes me regret my choices to go with the brand & although I can't yet afford to switch parts, once I'm able to, will definitely look into different brands. (also might explain some issues i've been experiencing)
BOOOOO BOOOO ASUS....😮get your pants on straight!!😮😮😮😮
This is not the first time, z390 and 490 from my own exp where overvolting on vccio on auto settings.... i didnt know this, but thanks to a buildzoid video i figured it out.  really awful mistake by asus, because there is not a problem in the beginning, but over time it will burn up you're memory controller...
that doesnt sound like a beta, sounds like an alpha if it causes part failure
Glad i went with MSI on my AM5 Build. First Board of them... everything worked perfectly fine out of the Box. Had issues with Asus and Gigabyte before.
Jeez, I guess my next build will be asrock then. I could never have dreamt this. Wtf is going on at these brands. It's baffling that they don't learn from their mistakes in this day and age.
It's going to take 20 years before I even consider ASUS hardware for any of my builds. This is a company that does not consider it's users as anything other than suckers. Shame on you, seriously shame on you ASUS.
Asus have been having this volt issue for years i have a asus z170 asus default cpu volts are set 1.410 the cpu i have is a 6700k default is 1.2v for that cpu.
FFS i only just bought a n asus mobo , thoughts and prayers.............
Good on you jay Asus seems to believe they are untouchable now hopefully this will cost them and make them step up and put the consumer first
Holy crap, the last two ASUS boards I tried to use in builds had issues with the sockets! I thought somehow during assembly I, myself, had gotten lint into the socket and discovered it was socket damage. After the recent wave of video's I'm off ASUS for the foreseeable future for myself and the streamers I build PCs for.
Wow I can't believe it. Haven't been watching your videos for the past few months since I had a lot going on in my life parenting you name it and I just wanted to recapture up on everything that deals with computers and I see this video. This company was always at the top and for them to do this stuff is insane and completely unethical I'm glad that you guys ditched them
To be slightly offtopic, I recently got a job to be a second level supporter in an ASUS support center. I went into the interview, we talked for around 20 minutes, talkin about what would be expected, what I would do, what the pay would be, etc, etc. Standard business stuff. Then they drop that they actually removed that position but they just so happen to have a new, similiar, one available and if I would be interested.    I of course said of course I am still curius, so what will I do in the new position and how much will the pay be?  Turns out the new position would be way more work at slightly less pay than the 2nd level support would have been. I politely declined, unless they pay me more.  Three days later I found the old job offer for the old job back from Asus on the web.
I’m building with an ASUS mobo today  It’s AM4 but I’m still terrified 😟
Well Done & Thankyou!!!!
I think I am done, too... I am not going to risk it. Do you recommend an Asrock board, or MSI one? Price is about the same. ASROCK X670E Steel Legend or MSI PRO X670-P WIFI ?
“Keep your stuff”
MSI, and their anti-competitive practices, Gigabyte and their Exploding PSU's NZXT and their bad case accessories (riser cable), and now ASUS & this B.S... I'm running out of brands I can safely trust. Guess I'm down to Zotac, AsRock, Sapphire, XFX, and EVGA (RIP EVGA GPU's). Hell, I'm upset I have an ASUS motherboard in my own system (Threadripper 1950X & ROG Strix X399 E Gaming).  Thank you Jay for refusing to support them until they hopefully clean up their act!
what do I do if i currently have an asus motherboard? should I get a new one???
That is really really unfortunate :( I loved the Asus stuff, even the RoG stuff.  I recently had to rebuild part of my system, and bought Asus motherboard, based off of past purchase. Sounds like any future purchase I make in the family, I might just had to add Asus to the avoid list
Ok, now for real. My system Ryzen 5900 x is in an all asus system (power, Main, CPU AIO) only my graka is MAinly 4090. all biossssss of witch i have installed all on my asus 570 Gaming E make my cpu go to 1.47-1.54 v It has been like this for 2 yeras or so. thats not new. buts till shiit
Good job Jay, respect.
Taichi gang FTW!
Although i agree with the Asus standpoint, i dint have so much luck with the taichi bord. Mine fried 2 sets of RAM without ever changing a single voltage setting. I guess i got one from a bad batch. RMA was denied because i enabled XMP...
What a coincidence, your relentless use of clickbait titles means you're now fired from my subscriptions and recommendations. FYI, people like to know what you're on about before they click.
MSI rubbing their hands together smelling a takeover because they’re products are actually really good as of late
Asus is no longer my bff.  ASRock is my new bff
imagine spending 5 grand to build your pc only for your $1.200 motherboard to fry the system lmao.
damn, why did i buy a asus board for my 7800X3D. ... i byed asus boards since the 90s and always thought, they were a decent, quality brand.
Opinions on Gigabyte?
Jay thank you standing up for the cosumer i got the asus prime amd motherboard
Thank you for your honest insights on the whole situation. I am building my first PC with the 7800x3d and a rx 7900 xtx. I was going with a asus motherboard. I will no longer.
still not sued? :D
RMA EXP, ASUS replaced my monitor 3 times with a dead pixel, waiting for my 4th replacement if I will still get the same issue.
ASrock are great and cheaper...used their MB for a decade already
expect the same corporate apology soon.. "we take these issues seriously bla bla bla"
ASUS has been going downhill for years.  Is Asrock the new ASUS?  I remember when ASUS had great customer service, no questions asked RMA policy, and made affordable hardware with tangible differences from competitors.  Now ASUS makes boards with a lot of bloat and bling, has awful customer service, and is priced astronomically.  I paid more for my last ASUS motherboard than I did my first entire computer.  The motherboard cost almost as much as the GPU, which was a 4090!
I have a ROG Crosshair VIII HERO WI-FI paired with a 5950X, as well as a ROG RYUJIN and a TUF RTX3080. Since day 1, the WiFi on the board only worked in 2.4GHz, 5GHz is not working at all. Coulnd't be bothered to return the board though as I needed the PC and I simply added USB WiFi. Armoury Crate is a huge piece of shit software, that cost me so many life hours that I think ASUS should pay me a year of retirement :D On the Ryujin, the OLED screen flickers all the time because that's the only solution ASUS found to prevent burn in. As soon as I do upgrades or other changes on the PC, it won't be ASUS anymore. I was quite interested in the ROG ALLY but seeing that it also runs Armoury Crate turns me off massively.
Well, i currently have ASUS B450-F Gaming mobo atm paired with 5600x cpu, so far it is doing fine, but i disabled any PBO shenanigans and have a NH-D15 as a cooler. Maybe i  should add and offset -0.020-0.030 miliwatts undervolt too?
Any gigabyte board that can replace proart?
I'am using a ASrock Steel Legend with my 7900x3d since i build it a few weeks ago.... and im very happy with it.
I'm done too with Asus, their after sales is shit
holy based
Respect! This will also be my last Asus board that I'll ever purchase. My Z790i is having boot issues with USB peripherals connected to it, I've been going back and forth for a month and a half now just re-explaining my problem to customer support and to forum moderators while they throw half-assed conclusions and troubleshooting steps at me. At this point I might as well take in the loss, and go MSI.
Just yesterday I've updated my Asus system drivers on my 2021 Advantage laptop... and it stopped turning on. I had to wait for it to cool down and then it finally started. After I've installed older drivers and removed the device, that had problems in the device manager, the problem was gone. Beware
I had issues with AMD and Asus back in the early 2000's never feel Asus and AMD a good match!
this hurts because i am a very heavy ProArt product user.
Annoyingly i have the same X670-E hero board. Its expensive and i bought it at launch thinking, it will possibly be supported for the next 2 generations of Ryzen CPU. But seeing how it was at launch and now with the bios updates for the x3D cpus. I have little confidence it will work well on future generations of CPU and now i fear its resale value has dropped off a cliff. Luckily I'm running 7900x and it is actually solid at the moment.
I need to know Gigabyte and MSI are still good!!!
i've an prime x470-pro and nowhere to find driver nor bios on the asus site... it's gone
Also dont forget Asus knowingly shipped out probably thousands of motherboards with faulty Intel® Ethernet Controllers like the  I225/I226. Years later and still no fix! I recently purchased a z-690 board from asus and got a faulty one. I had to purchase a pci network card to fix my brand new $500+ motherboard. I will never buy an Asus product again! I am glad Jay is exposing them, they deserve it
Its good see at least your open and honest. The only thing you are wrong about though is, there arrogance aint going to end them, they just wont get away from selling a $150 product for $500.  I only ever buy from companies that have great customer support, so ASUS is off my list now, thank you Jay!  Cheers,
Great that I went with a diffrent Manufacturere for my latest AM5 build. Something other than ASUS. Had a strange gut feeling and it turned out to be ture.
This is integrity
Don’t forget the new Strix laptops with terrible QC and blue screening. I was going to pull the trigger on a G18 after Dave2D’s glowing review, but then I looked at the customer reviews that came flooding in after and I am glad I held off.
Never use Asus motherboard, Asrock is my love.  ROG overpriced. TUF not as good as other brand. PRIME cheap out    But I have a Asus Router... Oh I am sorry.
Asus have been riding their brand name and marketing for a long time. Their quality has been going down hill for at least 10 years, but people have been blinded by their excellent marketing. I even think Jay stood by them for too long, but good to see you finally reaching past the point of no return. I hope Asus will wake up and start being on the consumers sided, or die, if they don't.
Good job Jay. This is the kind of attention that's needed for a company to change anything. It's vindicating to see people realize what I've been saying for years: that Asus thinks they're Apple and charges accordingly when they're not better than any other AIB.  Hey Asus, you don't get to treat your customers like Apple or Nvidia until you offer something no one else can like Apple and Nvidia. Right now there's several companies people can choose over you for equal or better product at far better prices. You should be offering unparalleled customer service in light of your prices, not the other way around. It's mindbogglingly insulting shit like this is going down on f*cking $700-$1000 motherboards. That should be an instant "Never Buy Again" ban on this brand.
My asrock motherboard has been still running for the past 12 years 😂
Imagina how much bullshit was uncovered by our YT heroes and that it's the impact we need to protect our rights. Pity you, ASUS... and especially in those tough times, with incredible hardware pricing! OMGGGGGGGGGGG
Ty Jay
Good, one of my x570 motherboards from ROG failed because the usb was damaged by pendrive and motherboard would not boot anymore. ROG didn’t wanted to replace the motherboard. It’s time to change this fail of company
I've bought an X670 Asus board back in january, mainly cause they had a cashback going on in my country. I then waited for the 7800X3D come out to complete my build, so im well outside of the return window for that board.  Will I be fine if I just set the SOC Voltage manually to 1.25 or 1.30 at max?
2 to 3 generations? 2 to 3 GENERATION S??? Try 30+ years! Seriously? They reserve the right to replace any part that is "functionally equivalent." Their idea of functionally equivalent has been laughable in the past. ASUS has been known to cut every corner they can without affecting functionally, then continuing to cut corners that do affect functionally.  My personal favorite was when the chipset supported 4 PCI lanes, there were 4 PCI ports on the board, but to save costs, on their top of the line board, one of two PCI ports were shared and the one lane not hooked up at all.  I"ve had people defend them saying that if you happen to configure your board just right, it will keep working. NO, I should be able to put in any card and not have to worry about what port. I should be able to put memory in the proper slots and it should just work!
wow and i wanted to buy a 4090 gpu from asus ... guess I'll look somewhere else, unfortunately I bought a motherboard from them like a month ago ...
im not even in the end of the video.. Thinking of replacing my ROG build!
I loved the Asus stuff too.. but shut down and no start issues with the x570 dark hero board and how Asus seems to have swept that one under the rug,  was when i saw this trend starting. (wont link it but search "dark hero wont start" and its easy to find.)  Ive held off on am5 and looks like it was a good move.  Ready to get a Tuf 4090 but now i am not sure.  I am just glad i can come here and 'see what jay thinks' and know that's a pretty good bet and on what to go with next.  The rant may not matter to asus, but it sure as hell matters to a lot of us!
I can't seem to find any product page for the x670e Apex to figure this out... why only 3 DIMM slots?
I had to design and print a new nice joy button for my ROG Chakram mouse which deteriorated and split in half after 4 months. I barely use that button so it just deteriorated by itself.
my eyes are glued on the megaman x box in the back and wanna know what kit is it
I have a asus motherboard and gpu and now randomly like 6 months later im suddenly getting random fps drops condtantlyyyyyyty in games.. i have no idea hoe to fix it or if something broke i have a 3080 and games should not be fps fropping from like 120 fps to 2fps every couple of seconds..
Wow, I really am behind you and will not, for the foreseeable future, get an ASUS mainboard myself.
AsRock was the budget brand for Asus at one stage, this doest necessarily mean that they were unstable, but that they were cheap. MSI on the other hand was the brand that were/are corrupt and released bad product. MSI is the brand that is doing everything right at the minute. If you are being beaten by MSI, Asus you are complete trash.
Anything ASUS i ever bought, didn't work properly. Latest was their TUF motherboard that I couldn't even stabilise my 3600mhz ram on
Didn't MSI get hacked recently?
Part of me is super disappointed by ASUS's fall from grace but the other part of me feels super vindicated. When I was first really starting to get into PCs, something seemed really pretentious about ASUS and I avoided them because I just felt like they would be super condescending if I ever had a problem. (Turns out that was true.) While I'm not big on the ultra-gaudy esthetic, I ended up going with MSI for my first dip into PC gaming and got one of their laptops. After a couple of years, I was ready to get my first desktop but wasn't ready to DIY. I'd heard about how reliable ASUS was so when I found a prebuilt with an ASUS motherboard, I bought it and an ASUS monitor. Those things were rock solid. They still actually work (that whole PC does tbh) and it's being turned into an HTPC/NAS hybrid machine. I still use the monitor too. Since I had such a great experience with ASUS on the old PC, I figured I would be safe to use them for my new PC and got a 3090ti and a combo deal for a 12th gen Intel and ASUS motherboard at MicroCenter a few months back. They've all been super solid so far and I was really looking forward to having a really reliable brand to trust. I figured that my gut was finally wrong for once and ASUS actually wasn't taking the scenic route to Scamville but here we are in Scamville after all... Well, ASUS got lucky by getting a few solid purchases from me and I got lucky by not having issues yet. I'm happy to stop betting here.  The whole ASRock thing unearthed a long lost memory for me though. My dad got really into computers before I was born and even had a leadership position in a PC users club of sorts. (Thinking about that feels really weird now. It'd be like creating an IRL, local group with a permanent meeting space leased out and everything for discussing AI and ChatBots and such lmao.) He was still tinkering with PCs well into my teens before technology started improving way too quickly for him to keep up as he got older. He used to bring home ASRock products and mess with them to try and figure out why they were so bad. He passed away a couple of years ago and I'm only now going through his home office. I found some old, broken ASRock things just the other day, along with a ton of other older tech. Man was a horder but so am I and none of that stuff is ever leaving, even if it is junk. No, I technically don't need five (5) 3.5" floppy disks that, all together, make one boot copy of Windows NT3.1 or the Lian-Li hot-swap hard drive bay that's older than I am... But they're cool. Plus, he had at least 2 broken 5.25" internal CD drives and I've been needing some cupholders for my desk.
In regards of a rampage vi extreme, I am still waiting for improvements on the aura sync, is a shame their quality assurance for product support.
Guess I'm buying ASrock for my next build.
What a shame. I love my z390 Maximus hero so much, next build will be msi mobo I guess
Sad.
The affect of theese videos is really huge so Asus should be really think of what they are doing. I bought New AM5 motherboard... expensive one :( and I wanted the best of the best and now I don't feel confident in it and honestly I feel a little like I own crap that may blow up anytime...
Thanks for keeping it real and not trying to just put content out
Asus has gone to shit.
i really wonder if they did some bullshittery in AM4 too but the socket voltage was too low it couldnt actually do any damage...
i'm guessing asus just went full china mode, trying to make everything as cheap as possible while ignoring quality going down at the same time, and then just trying to cover it all up with a fancy paintjob
Gotta get another brand for motherboard then~
Thanks for this video.  I'm planing and getting parts together for a build later this year. I now know to stay clear of ASUS.  Thanks for the integrity!
I installed some 3600Mhz CL16 DDR4 into my ASUS X570 TUF gaming plus a couple of days ago. It wouldn’t boot. Then it would boot. Then it wouldn’t.  I went in and updated the BIOS and now it runs perfectly stable until it randomly hard reboots. memtest86 passes but Windows Memory Diagnostic doesn’t even seem to start. The percent complete indicators never display a value at all. That happens even when I run JEDEC config 2400MHz.   I’m going to put the 3200MHz kit back in and if that is stable, I’m selling it and going to ASRock.
Well that's that brand out the door, almost every build i did was a Asus MB, but now seriously looking at other manufactures.
Not gonna be surprise if Jaytwocents and Nexus dies from car accident couple of weeks 🤣
ROG = Ridiculously Overpriced Garbage
I took a speech class with a guy who worked with Asus in Taiwan, and he was very impressed with their build quality as it was much higher than any other company in the same business. I think they're now letting their quality slip because they're so trusted. It happens with a lot of companies.
I'm using an ASUS Tuf X570E Plus (WiFi), AMD 5800X, Sapphire Pulse RX 6700, 32 GB G.Skill DDR4 4000 CL18 (Running at 3733 CL16)... CPU boosts to 5ghz avg in CB23, 6700 is undervolted/OC and it took me a minute to get it all stable. Manual voltages and offsets to reduce the likelihood of spikes and the memory... don't get me started on timings. Anyway, having built many many many many man ma... a lot of builds, I've come to the somewhat educated and experienced opinion that ASUS is lacking. Integrity fixes all of this. Period.
This video is nothing but a big dose of hysterics. He received 2 free motherboards which were faulty and in the end not the desired color. Also, it has not yet been possible to agree on this year's sponsorship contract. Also, the GN video is going big right now and they need something to talk about. What follows from all this: ASUS has become shit, you are fired. Ridiculous.
I remember when I did a build like three builds ago I had to RMA the same motherboard three times (Maximus VII Hero)before I had to yell at them on the phone and tell them to stop sending me the same board. I took pictures of the serial numbers and they kept lying and telling me they sent me a new board until I finally got in a chat on Twitter with them and sent them the serial numbers every time they sent it back. I tried again because I was a huge ASUS fan(Maximus IX) and had to RMA that one twice out of the box. I switched to gigabyte that build and never looked back.
I was an Asus fanboy since Am2. I had so many issues with my Asus Am4 boards, that I switched to ASrock for AM5 and have been pretty happy. Having to install their bloatware to get ethernet drivers on B550 was the last straw for me. Not even the act itself, but the fact that they didn't tell anyone ha. Edit: I posted this before I listened the whole way through, But wanted to add, The X670E Tiachi is what I went with too and its been amazing. Was having some trouble setting up lane bifurification on the 2nd pc slot and got answers instantly from Asrock. They actually contacted me just based on a comment.  Being able to use 4 m.2's in 1 pcie slot is pretty sick tbh lol. I also bought my board 2nd hand and Asrock never held that against me, still just wanted to help.
Yeah! ASUS ROG Boards look good and are expensive. That's it ! More appearance than reality. Crappy software and the worst Support. I use ASRock boards all the time and have no problems with them.
Asus, you’ve been cancelled
Good, the best way to show your displeasure with a company is don't buy their product.  That also includes Bud Light, and Disney products.
Guess I'm not buying that new Asus GPU I was planning to 😅
I am currenrly holding an Asus Z790 ROG Strix in my hand for my new build. Wondering if intel boards are stil fine?
@Jay I suggest checking your power supply, the issues you are having I had once and the psu was dodgy. After I replaced it I stopped having bluescreens, ram issues, and sound issues. just a out of the box suggestion.
Just built a new PC 2 weeks ago with 7800X3D and Asus X670E Mobo. Gota love my timing
i followed your vids and tutorials like it was the pc building bible. so if its fuck asus now…. fuck asus
I got a 7800X3D, upgrading from a 9900K and got an Asus X670E-E board. My first and last time I'll deal with Asus boards. Once these BIOS issues get 100% sorted, I'll go with MSI like the last few boards i've had because I've never had any issue with them at all, or Perhaps jump to Asrock or Gigabyte. FML.   Good thing I have choices.
This entire era of PC building is a nightmare, as Jay pointed out recently.  The product quality is in the toilet, customer support is terrible, prices are through the roof, it never ends.
What a gigantic fall from grace. Sad!
I like jays videos, but this is ridiculous, this is being blown way way out of proportion and cancelling asus like this is so cringe, I’ve not had a single issue with an asus product in the last 3 years since getting into pc building.
I built my first PC back in 2020 with a 3800x with an Asus build, and now I'm starting to wonder if the random funkyness now and again is because I did something wrong or if it's the mobo. Which is sorta sad because they were supposed to be reliable
I have only ever used ASUS motherboards and currently am looking to upgrade my Rampage VI extreme encore. I am now for the first time ever, looking at other brands. I also think ASUS are asking crazy prices for the current gen motherboards.
ASROCK has very super shitty software. I wouldn't say their software is more stable than ASUS. However, they're not frying CPUs AFAIK.
To Asus: I don't know you anymore. Asus, you're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow.
"You don't care" is 100% accurate. They made their money and that's all that matters.
I've been watching you Jay since i was 16 and i wanted to overclock a GPU and found your videos, and i don't even remember anytime you were as frustrated with a brand like this. Nice to see someone telling it straight, I hope they learn the lesson here and get their sh-STUFF-it fixed, and probably lower the prices from here on in.
so far no issue with mine!
I bought an ROG 2 phone and within the span of a year and a half I had it RMA'd 3 times (didn't RMA it the 4th time even though it was within warranty because I was just tired of dealing with their shit...the spent more time with my phone than I did...) In that same year of the final failure I had  brand new 2070 and 3060 from Asus go bad on me (building computers for friends of mine that are not tech inclined)...I swore to just not buy anymore ASUS products in my life which is a shame but fuck em, I remember a time when ASUS was that reliable brand that was the safe choice....
Tell it like it is Jay!
Half Assed Effort?!?! But I was using my whole ass!  - Homer Simpson...
Thank u Jay for standing up.   I hope msi treats u good.   More builds with evga boards. Evga customer service is number 1 lol. I know I push evga alot. I just don't want to lose the brand.   I still miss tyan motherboards, bfg tech graphics.  Inwin used to make amazing cases for the normal customer.
I'm glad I chose MSI again, I don't like their mystic light but that's nothing compared to problems y'all have with asus.
At this moment, ASUS is the Land Rover of the motherboards 🤣
Sitting here watching this video on an ASUS monitor with my rig that has an ASUS ROG Dark Hero X570 board and is filled with Corsair cooling and RAM (that's had constant bugs and problems due to iCue being hot steaming garbage) and realizing just how blindly loyal I've been to brands that have suffered from "inflated ego syndrome". Was literally about to build my wife a little rig for her office using Corsair and ASUS components. It's all going back. I'm switching future builds to other components. Enough is enough.
Hey, I have 7700x and Asus TUF x670E does it fall in the same category as everything?
Im annoyed and angry. Im on my second z690 formula. Corrosion and USB gremlins. My second board has new and different USB shenanigans. I heard the LAN port is borked on many of these boards also. First we lose Nvidia to sheer corporate greed. Then we lost EVGA cards to that greed. Now we lost ASUS to what will probably be their own version of greed. Are the best years of PC consumerism really behind us? I hear Samsung is having serious Solid state issues. Are they the next to fall?
I used to love Asus. I'm now glad I watched this video and glad my current comp isn't built with anything from them.
Anyways ROG are Scumbags but their logo is cool tho only richhead clueless pc builder will Buy ROG 🤣
👍nice
Hey, Jay.  I'm posting this on the off chance you notice it.  I'm trying to build a pure AMD 7800X3D system to replace my current 4790k + R9 380 build and my choice for motherboard was going to be the X670E ProArt Creator.  With all these ASUS 7800X3D issues, would you happen to have an answer on what would be a good plan B for the motherboard?  I was going for DDR5 AMD EXPO memory and the ProArt Creator also happened to have both and Marvell and Intel Ethernet (which is amazing).  Even had plenty of internal connectors and M2 slots.  I feel like I'm at a total loss for what motherboard to go with now.
looks like after my tuf board nuked 2 cpus, and i went to an msi board i apparently made a good decision.  Guess we shall see how this plays out!
To make it worst, I realized that he is referring to a motherboard that cost a grand.... no warranty on a motherboard that cost that much with fucked up heating that kills your cpu? Oh yea im avoiding this brand + am5 motherboards so far looks bad in terms of products and fuck ups
If armoury crate could be fixed to the point it’s actually usable… I’m running a croshair hero mb and recently bought the Ryuo iii 360 aio. Their Anime matrix is terrible. The animations lag and crash all the time. Armoury crate crashes or won’t even load. By now I’m so frustrated that I just disabled all rgb
I'm very sad to hear this. I LOVE my ASUS monitors and I can't see myself switching to another brand. My PC still has an i7-8700K with an ASUS motherboard, but it sounds like I'll have to go with a different brand of motherboard for my upgrade.
almost 3.8 mil subs, guy is rolling in dough. so he couldn't care less
Yeah, this is really disappointing. In 3 years time had them replace 2 different LED monitors as both were giving issues. Had a 10 year old LCD screen from dell that outlive them both. Luckily both were under warranty, but the way their operating now, one wonders when will they remove warranties on everything and anything.
I now have an ASUS motherboard (B660M-K D4) that freezes randomly, BIOS updates does not help, swapping components does not help, tweaking memory does not help. Disappointed.
Oh no I have one of those z690 boards for my 12th gen lol
It’s always a shame to see a company grow complacent like this. Asus absolutely had the market cornered as far as hardware/aesthetics were concerned, and decided to put the absolute bare minimum into their software. And now it seems they’re putting in the bare minimum on their QA as well. I’m keeping the 3080 I got from them, but I’m not buying any more of their products until I see a solid effort on their part to care more about the people whose money got them where they are.
5 years ago I attended a local media event for enthusiasts here in TW and witnessed their PMs get on stage & shamelessly plug their $200+ M.2 external enclosures & mice with ungodly amount of xmas lights, with an effort more ludicrous than Ron Popeil with his food dehydrator & bald spray paint. I knew right then that this company was going to go down in flames at some point in the forseeable future.
Im using an Asus MB A520M Tuf Gaming in my build (AM4 Build).  Because of this channels recommendations, I think last generation i'm ok, but for future.... noted for future though.
I bought an 'AMD Ryzen 7 7700' version CPU and the 'ASUS ROG Strix B650E-I Gaming WiFi' motherboard about 3 months ago. So far, I haven't heard about any cases with the 'non X and X3D' version CPUs yet and haven't had any issues my self so far either.  Do I still have to be worried?
I wouldn't be shocked if the Asus shit in my computer was the issue behind my performance problems. I dabbled with that crate software once to change the lights and HOLY FUCK was that a chore. Never again.
Gigabyte: Lights on fire MSI: Leaks UEFI keys (unfixable) ASUS: Drops the ball on BIOS revisions, blows up CPUs, installs capacitors backwards NVIDIA: Fire burning on the GPU connectors EVGA: Peace out  We're running out of vendors guys...
Again Jay MSI got HACKED! Be  VERY careful where you get your drivers from. Only the offical site is "SAFE" at this point.
Used to run ASUS only, however - after dealing with their support a couple of years back I started realising how little they cared. Then came some poor support for other ASUS products afterwards, slow BIOS updates to fix 'basic' stuff and the likes.. and I just stopped buying ASUS products. Had already jumped on EVGA for graphics, and on my first non-ASUS mobo for years.
I was wondering what the biggest german pc parts seller Mindfactory was on about when they quit working with asus, well now everything makes sense
Glad I chose MSI over Asus on my new rig. Just over a month old, no issues so far with 7700x
Many years ago two Asus motherboards I had purchased at different times gave up the ghost. The problem was corrosion under the IC's. Fast track 30 years on and have never bought Asus again.
My two latest Asus boards, X670E-based have failed. Got a Prime-wifi that was DOA. Lots of troubleshooting blind, because no diagnostic Led. My second was Pro Creator. On this one the second memory channel wasnt working, so that is also going back. This at least got the 4 diag-lights, but for a board that cost 500 USD plus VAT that should been the full led display.  My 10 year old ROG Z87 board got it. For what was half the price.  So it is gonna be some other brand I will be using onwards. Both at home and at work. I used to have a saying I used, no one has ever been fired for buying Asus... Well, not using that phrase any more.
I’m pretty excited for their Ally haha . I just bought one  .
i love asus and really hope they bounce back :/
I gave up on Asus 2 years ago. Thanks for showing this.
I’m on the asus b650e-f my 7900x runs fine out of the box. Waiting to overclock until bios is stable with their updates.
I wrote to ASUS with request to get my money and return mobo I literally just bought... I'll buy something that will not melt my PC
Total agree.  Had a really bad RMA issue with a ASUS ROG 34” monitor.  Had 2 broken monitors sent to me before I got a full refund.   I then had a issue with a Hero XII that died and could get a replacement for so was offered a Hero XIII instead.  When I come to my next upgrade.  ASUS isn’t going to be part of it.
I am impressed Jay! Not many that have an impact, actually use it for the right thing. Kudos!
Almost pulled the trigger on an 8K AUD build a few days ago, which started based on a bundle from a local shop that offered an AMD 7950X3D, the RAM kit that was 'X3d' Ready and the x670E Hero... So glad I didn't make the purchase. I guess I'm lucky being in Aus where I can take the board back and get refund/exchange etc etc.. but still.. I've had the odd issue with Asus in the past, but my main issues were always with AsRock.. Now I find myself thinking AsRock might be a better alternative when re-checking the board I select...
Totally agree, Asus really needs to step up and fix these issues do better and remove the x670 warranty void immediately.  While my Pro WS x570-ACE been rock solid some of their boards are absolute garbage, especially when it comes to memory and cpu compatibility, to the point where things just refuse to work. Even memory and cpu combinations they have on their website listed as working.
Good on you, Jay for calling them out. Saw Steve’s vid too.  Was ramping for a new build and I’ve been using ASUS MOBOs for 20+ years. So I’m considering a different route now without ASUS.  What a shame.
Thanks for your support and effort
Given that they provide the board and they provide the fix I can't imagine their claim of voiding warranty would stand up to consumer law??
Asrock : "Hey thanks for the free advertisement Asus"
built a basicly "full" asus PC in 2020/2021, been regretting it ever since, changed 4 gpu's and psu' still coilwhine, pc randomly crashing, overclocked cpu out of the box bluescreen for first 2 days, etc etc,.,,
I use(d) ASUS Boards in my builds for almost 10 Years straight now - and in general for like 25 years (some switching in the first 15 years, so not straight). Unfortunately my most recent I built just in the beginning of march, so like a lil over 8 weeks back. That means, I am stuck to it now for a while. Ofc it is an ASUS Board with a 7000 Series AMD CPU. And I regret it so much. If I could turn back the time I would not buy ASUS again. And I feel ashamed that I did not realize sooner what has happened to ASUS - or let's state it more clearly: What they have turned themselfes into. That's my fault, but I will learn from it. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. @JayzTwoCents thanks for being consequent, I like.
Jay, if you're willing to sell some ASUS boards cheap I would like to buy one for testing purposes
Yeah they're scum and that's why I don't have a single asus product in my pc, which is a shame because imo they have by far the best mobo bios
I hope ASUS eventually is getting this right. One of my favorite company in the world :,-(
Well done Jay! This is exactly the only way these giants listen. No one buys their products and that is the bottom line.
My first Asus board was 920 i7, it was already v2 because v1 design was broken, the board still had issues. My first Asus laptop had overheating issues, Asus stuff has had issues for decades, just reviewers never seemed to care. Its overpriced junk. Stick with MSI or ASrock.
ASUS used to be my fave brand, my first gaming laptop I got from my mother was made by them. Their quality was top notch from my experience and the customer service treated me well, that did a 180 a few years ago and I dropped them ever since. My peripherals now stem from corsair, they've been pretty solid to me for the past 6 years. ASUS seems to just be spiraling down the drain of their own free will, it just doesn't make sense. Well, thx for making your feelings heard loud and clear jay, its an echo of what a lot of people feel but don't have the platform to express and reach out to others.
Tbh my last gaming notebook was so bad that I revamped the idea to make a gaming desktop, and I did. I had an asus zepyhrus 501gx. Brilliant genius design with keyboard on bottom side, block-num as touchpad and the floor opening to improve the airflow. First to use this amazing ideas. Intel of 7th gen, and a 1080. I still use it.... but: The audio jack broke after 1 month (problem I've seen in other asus laptops), the battery after just 2 years, started growing and raised the keyboard to a point where I had to remove it. Plus some most used keyboard keys stopped working. I've seen other high end Asus laptops with similar problems. Very bad quality, even if the hardware was "in theory" very good. I won't get another asus product ever. As for this reason, for my desktop I got an MSI motherboard and I'm very happy with that.
The strongest statement is exactly at the end of the video, the point of the whole video itself: "but you don't care". That's getting very, very evident.
Asus has been "managed" by MBAs too?  Seems anything that employs an MBA goes to shit
We need to call out and bring down Nvidia next
I am so unhappy with myself for having gone to asus for my 7950x three weeks ago…  I don’t experience many problems, even with the 6400 ram which isn’t even expo but Xmp, except for when I tried the amd overclock software, somehow it played havoc with the boot process ….
Respect. Team MSI
I'm happy I went Gigabyte with my latest purchase, Gigabyte B450M DS3h Wifi. It's the first motherboard I literally had to do nothing and it just performed like a champ. I love ASUS, but I've not used them in many years so, after this video anything I get from ASUS I'm going to be very picky on the product.
I wouldn't be surprised if it's all down to bad managers and poor decisions from very high up.
hi jay iv built 6 computers know i used ASUS mother boards for every computer i built i built them all this year in 2023 i have a ASUS board in the computer I'm writhing this on no miss up works great i love ASUS i thank they have great mother boards sorry u hade so bade luck with them
Time for Asus to be sued.
I haven't used Asus since  the am1 socket to many bios update issues. I have bricked more Asus boards updating bios than any other boards. I have used Asrock  since the Ryzens came out  and I am using 1 now a b550m-c it is an oem board with an 8+2 phase vrm  and wifi 5 bluetooth  2 usb 2.0 and 4 usb 3.0, 1 usb 3.2 and 1 usb 3.2 type c  1 hdmi for the  apu's for $109 at micro center new I am just running a 5600x in it and is rock solid my other Asrock boards were Asrock Taichi  x370 x470 and x570 i had to sell them due to lay off during the shutdown
So who is the best then? EVGA, MSI ???.
What  has happened to the motherboard Z790 Extreme?  is it completely gone !!!!
Finally did a upgrade from i7 5930 to 7800x3d. I like to use extra money for higher tier boards than needed, my old computers still working pushing 9 and 13 years. And I got the crosshair hero, same board because Jay had it. 🤣
ASUS Quality Control has been garbage for years, I'm sorry you had to go through this to finally realize that but I'm glad to see you putting your money where your mouth is. Too bad the switch to MSI aged poorly, what with the source code hack.
My last motherboard was asus. It was shite. Never again.
Ya know this was the same thing they did back in 2010 and was why I walked away from their video cards(how they handled the 580 matrix snafu) I'm about to build a new rig and yeah I've been fully msi or Asus rog... hearing this I'm gonna research some more before I buy my motherboard
This video is gonna cost Asus so much money
Big balls ! thank you for stay with us Jay  :)
So glad I went MSI for my 13th gen build
Damn, the last Asus AMD mobo I had last 10 years, always on and overclocked 24/7. They have fallen hard!
Funny because I had 0 issues with the 13900K. I see many influencers saying they had nothing but problems with AMD. I am so glad I stuck with Intel this time around.  Intel gets such a bad rap but they have been golden for me.
Seems like I bought the wrong MoBo, if I was about a month and a half later I would have went with MSI, or Asrock. Shame on ASUS, I've been such an ASUS fan for so long its sad to say goodbye for now. Lets hope the heed your advice. Well spoken.
I just cant try MSI again. They screwed my and my friend over a long time ago over DOA parts. I wont touch them. And now Asus is doing this? EVGA gone and Im thinking my current build is going to last the next decade because I have no trustworthy "high tier" brand to go to.
All these problems plus absurd price tags on all of their products (actually that's a general problem but ASUS is going a bit further) like a 5000 euros laptop.. non more ASUS products and genrally no new pc until the industry get the point to NOT be greedy a**holes whity sh*tty products and customer service
I just bought a computer with a z790p board in it from cyber power. How worried do I need to be and do I need to ask for a refund/ new board because of it?
I hope Asus will listen to us consumers, because i loved their brand, but their products reliability is really shitttyy, i bought their Asus Rog phone 5 ... 6 months after i bought it, the motherboard went kaput... Unfortunately i didnt learn my lesson and bought a Asus Strix Scar17 ... Fast friggin machine but it hangs so many friggin times !!! Totally not responsive at all not even ctrl alt delete does anything ... Ahh i shoulda bought MSI instead
holy shit jay is 1st man in history to fire a sponsor
I built my 12th gen intel and decided to use an ASUS motherboard. I have never fought with a new build so much before. Just figured it was the cutting edge tech at the time that wasn't playing nice....now it makes me wonder
I've known for YEARS that Asus is scum to work with. They do everything in their power to deny warranties and refunds. Gotta love putting Linus on the spot, having just ran a sponsored shill video for Asus
Another terrible company bites the dust 🫡
asus single handledly making intel looking good
Company name/brand, complacency and profit over product specs and reliability. This will will lead to failure in the end, same thing happening with the German car manufactures.
I've got ASUS NOCTUA 4080 and while idle it is silent. Once under load, the extremely audible coil whine makes it a complete waste of money, literally the loudest component in my silent build
such a shame. i've always relied on asus motherboards for almost 2 decades now and they have been the go-to for all the pcs i've built for people. I've never had any issues ever with them and i sung their praises non-stop. I'm having a very hard time now of not knowing what brand to rely on. I hope other channels drop them as sponsors and whatever executives are responsible for their horrible policies get the axe and someone who can restore the brand reputation is put in their place.
Okay so , i repair exclusively asus computers ( mostly laptops ) and it can litterally take months ( been fighting with them for 3 months now ) to replace a laptop , they asked I basically changed everything i could change and they still ask me to swap the motherboard again ( so far its the 5th lmao ) . Not really desktop computer related ... But god damn their fucking rma system is so shit even for techs that works for them . I dont know how it is for consummers to rma their broken components
I, absolutely, love videos like these it reminds the customers that the only valid weapons they have against shady business practices is to NOT spend your money on shoddy products and give an honest to god feedback on what you find.
I wonder if this all started when Asus switched OEMs from Pegatron to ECS (yes, *THAT* ECS, the ones that used to make utter bottom of the barrel boards way back in the day)
Thanks for this light on this subject. Seems to be a trend of big bucks and poor products. Now I'm in the fence for a build. I won't go Intel he'll no to apple and this man is just bad business.
Love you man
Ived used every crosshair from the original ryzen to the 5000 series and then to the z790 rog for my intel system. This makes me want to switch brands like you jay.
I have an x570 asus board, I switched from an asrock b350 board. Asrock was super solid and great but I wanted to try asus on amd, since the last time I had an Asus board was intel x79. I deeply regret going with asus, I've had the board for like two years now or something like that and I am considering switching to another brand. The board is technically fine but I have two USB ports that come and go, and a few other clearly motherboard related issues. I think you're making the right call Jay.
Talk about burning bridges,…phew.
7-8 years ago i had a lot of issues with asus both mobos and gpus, and the lack of support i received for their garbage. havent used them since.
Jay, what's worse than being let down by someone whom you grew to trust? Fock!!!
Freaked up AAA games launches, hardware prices skyrocket to the moon, hardware issues everywhere. Seems like we are doomed.
Jay, the man of the people🫶🏻
And lets not talk about that dumpster fire called Armoury crate xD
Holy fuck... when i built my 2013 pc i got an asrock and it fucked me over and i dreamed of a asus, and then now i got an asus and i needed an asrock..    Cant return my mobo tho, its been 45 days. Fuck
Now please send a poor man an x670e please 😅
I ditched ASUS for use with AMD Products during their K7 days due to issues with K6 and K7 processors, so this was back in 2001. I'm not surprised to see them back at having the same problems all over again.
bless jay.. champion of the consumers
13:36 Haha, that's what you get for being a fashion bimbo. When it comes to PC's the most important aspect ever is performance, looks don't matter. If colors or whatever didn't match and was annoying to you then put it in a case without clear panels. Out of sight out of mind. Heck, place it under your desk, in another room even.
I used to swear by Asus. Wouldn't touch their crap with a stick now.
Corporate greed is running rampant this day and age. Not just Asus, but all sorts of companies. Higher rent prices, higher gas prices, higher grocery prices. It's bad enough we got companies like Apple who lock things down tight-as-a-drum and allow no upgrades at all, but now we've got companies just turning completely shady and screwing their customers. When profit becomes the sole focus of your business, you are doomed for failure.
What's the top of the line brand now for MoBoard as alternative? Not like "decent" but what's the best?
Thats why im a msi and evga fanboy, just sayin....
sounds like they need a bit of the bud light treatment
With the Release of the first ryzen gen i used a x370 Crosshair VI with the x1700 ryzen 7 cpu. Great looking Board, but i have much Problems with stability and overlocking ram + cpu. Over the next 2 years they drop around 10 Bios Updates where one Problem is fixed and 2 New Problems where generated. At this time i thinked asus have a good working Support because where they drop 10 Updates the other Brands only Released maybe 2-3 Updates for Bios. But the fact is, the other Brands dont have These stability issues like asus. Later i put a ryzen 5 3600 on that Board but still dont have a Solid running System so i moved to b550 platform. I know i dont want to go again with asus so i decided to go with MSI. On this System maybe i updated the Bios over 2 years 2-3 Times only for up to date reasons because the Board and Software are rocksolid. Since a few weeks i go with the 7600x cpu on a b650 tomahawk Board and have again no issues. Its a midclass Board with "ok" Funktions but it works fine. Iam missing the diagnostic Segment display but hey What do you want to read on it if the system works great? The cheapest Board with diagnostic display Coasts at that time 350€ and is an asus Board (yeah they realy need the display..) so no Option for me to pay 100€ ontop only for the display to get an asus Board.
funny thing is all the other brands are just as stingy with their warranties, is there even any one reliable...
Asus is horrible for RMA and their software is ass.
The fact that if you by mistake purchase an Asus MB and you casually live outside of the US, basically you avoid the warranty gets me nuts, thank you, Jay, for speaking for all of us here that Asus was careless about the actual customer the ones who made them rich. 😎😎
someone must have taken over some years ago to cause this.
As a ROG fanboy I'm really sad.
when the 5900x launched I got an asus board for it and it was so buggy and ran like shit and needed many "beta" bios updates to fix, ever since that they are on my "no buy" list
Asus deserves everything bad that happens to them. Scumbags
Well done for standing up for us poor consumers and having the balls to call out asus. I built a full asus pc and monitor over 4K build with them and had nothing but problems with the monitor pg27vq after 5 RMA s and claims from asus that i did not send it one time and that i had stolen it from the delivery guy i gave up and switches to another company
Worst board I ever owned was an ASUS Slot A K7M, and it was pretty expensive even back in 2000. Serious POS.
So boycott Asus and Gigabyte? ✅
Ok quick, I need an AM5 board with USB4 that doesn't have a ticking time bomb feature. Is asrock taichi good?
Asus is Taiwan based company, there is about to start a war with China, if you seek it out, it has been like a year long warm up over there.  Related ?
Great paranoid mode on now 😢I had a corrupted file leading to lost of all audio (it's fixed now) but I am paranoid now because I build a system all around the new Asus ROG Str x670e motherboard including getting a 4090 to match it. Pardon the french but wt.freak i am worried as hell the whole system was build around the fact Asus has/had the so called best version of the 4090. Sorry
All of the ASUS hardware had issues, I will be honest. RX480 had coildwhine. Vega56 had coilwhine(also there was an issue with thermal pads). Crosshair 6 had coilwhilne, Z270I had coilwhine... Last one was so loud, that I swapped it to Asrock board, despite it working totally fine.
Maybe I'm just lucky but I haven't ever had problems with asus boards. Will definitely take this stuff into consideration next time I upgrade though.
Shit I just orderd an ASUS board XD
Looks like we need to Make Asus Great Again, truly
💩so now there is no manufacturer left to buy . . .  i would buy EVGA if they do a normal $200,- board and not a only $600,- overclocking boards
Jay, I have my own PC repair business and have been using and recommending ASUS for nearly 20 years. It's sad to see this happen. I recently built a daily driver for myself but went with Gigabyte instead for the first time ever. Never thought I'd see the day. My suppliers also don't stock Asus currently. In South Africa it's sometimes hard to get access to some brands as it is. So to loose Asus is a big blow. I hope they can get their act back together.
That beta bios sounds like a company trying to get out of being liable for a known failure they caused buy pushing a bios update that will void your warranty.
Aye for a few years back in the Sandy Bridge and Ivy bridge years Gigabyte were the bad guys blowing up chips and entire systems first time I thought it was a fluke second time with the G1 sniper there was no doubt They were not to be trusted now Asus is suffering the same QC issues. But they have their fingers Crossed that You forgive the fried CPU's buy A ROG ALLY when it launches!!
They have been this way for a few years.. Heads got too big and their products rubbish ...
AOURUS make very good boards, but the software especially RGB Fusion it's kind like a 💩💩💩
I ditched them after my X570 crosshair hero started crashing and failing randomly. Switched it out and everything was rock solid.
I’ve had nothing but bad experiences with MSI and their customer service made the situation worst.  I got a new MSI motherboard that wouldn’t boot, turns out something was wrong with the memory slots and they ruined whatever RAM was installed in them.  MSI refused to investigate the RAM issue, refused to replace the RAM, and sent me a refurbished motherboard that also ruined RAM. For both builds I had to buy another motherboard to get the builds done and everything worked fine except the RAM that was used in the MSI motherboards.  They acted like they were doing me a favor replacing the bad brand new motherboard with a refurbished one.  After they refused to investigate the issue so they can see the RAM issue was their fault I didn’t bother asking for another motherboard since that would have been a potentially forth kit if RAM their product would ruin that they refused to replace.  I would rather spend more money on a brand with good customer service than buy another MSI product.
Awesome job Jay, l wonder if Linus will say anything about this as the more content creators stand up the more chance we have that action might be taken.
Omg what a piece is this. I allsways tought Asus was the best. Last build I used asrock and it was great geuss asrock is my new GOAT.
I'm currently using the ROG-Crosshair-X670E-Hero, my third consecutive Asus motherboard. So far, it's functioning as expected and I hope my luck continues. But if this is what they consider 'premium', I'll likely be switching brands for my next build.
17:20 - hah! perfect ending.
Well... two months ago I switched from Ryzen 7000 to Intel 13th because of the pain it was causing... and last week, my B660I Strix randomly and without warning had it's second DIMM slot die. Burn-smell included. So yeah... feel we're in the same place. Funny enough, I also switched to a MSI B760I board, and so far, it's been as solid as it can be, minus some Ethernet weirdness that ended up being much more a ISP issue than board issue.
Never liked ASUS from the time they had this capacitor scandal amd the fake chips to fight the more advanced Gigabyte. For me Gigabyte was always better and more stable motherboard manufacturer. Look at the ASUS vs Gigabyte case and you will understand.
Just bought a new mobo, ram, and cpu the other day... Glad I dodged a bullet and none of it was Asus 😬
Amen Bro!!!
To start,  I've used ASUS for decades. I decided to build a home server and chose ASUS, which was a horrible choice. the motherboard I chose was picked specifically had 3 16x physical PCIe slots. I put a 5600 cpu and 64GB of Gskill 2333MHz memory into it. The machine could not run proxmox and trueNAS. So I built a 2nd server for trueNAS thinking i had a compatibility issue.  Even with just proxmox it was still having weird, random issues until i updated the bios. The machine was fairly stable. until one day it said one of the cpu's was locked. I figured that I'd reboot to check that the bios wasn't weird from the update a few weeks earlier.  this is when i found that the USB keyboard was not recognized during post. luckily i had an old PS2 keyboard that mostly worked (some keys weren't recognized, like the main enter key). I was now able to enter the bios, but the USB mouse didn't work.  i started talking to ASUS support about no USB  detection during post, but as soon as the OS started to load the keyboard and mouse would work. Every single CSR tech blamed my issue on the cpu, then ram, then hdd, then the keyboard and mouse.  i had to complain to a supervisor to get an RMA.  after we realized that i couldn't reload the bios because of no USB. I asked for an advanced replacement but was told there was no stock. I bought an ASRock motherboard so i could return the ASUS motherboard. When the ASRock motherboard arrived I moved all the hardware to that motherboard, except the NVMe standoff fell off the ASUS motherboard. I could see no damage, so I put a tiny amount of glue on the standoff (ASUS had originally glued it to the motherboard, I'd never seen that before). Before I returned the ASUS motherboard I tested it and it was still able to recognize and boot from the NVMe.  I then moved all the hardware to the ASRock motherboard which ran flawlessly (including the USB).  I again asked for an advanced replacement, but was told there was no stock. The next day I shipped the motherboard back, with all everything that came with it.  A few days later I got an email from ASUS informing me that they couldn't repair my motherboard as I had damaged the NVMe standoff. I contacted multiple people fighting this over some weeks.  I explained what had happened. I just wanted them to at least try to put a bios that worked. They refused. Everytime ASUS contacts you, they say that there will be a response in 48 hours. That is a lie, they NEVER respond.   When I got an email saying that I had to pay for the repairs (the invoice showed that I would be charged for a new motherboard, a repair fee and return shipping)  or it would be returned, I demanded to talk to a supervisor. I was told that the RMA department did not have a supervisor. Multiple more email complaints and I got a response from a RMA supervisor. It was always "you damaged the motherboard, we can't fix it".  I then asked to talk to a manager. Multiple emails demanding that I talked to a manager and one day I got a phone call from someone at ASUS informing me that a manager would be calling me with in 48 hours.  Not only didn't a manager call me, I got a "final warning" about my motherboard, saying that if I didn't pay for a replacement that my motherboard would be replaced. Within hours I sent an email saying not to send my motherboard back while I am still waiting to speak with a manager.  2 days later, my original motherboard arrived. It was in a white box and did not include anything that I sent them. I string of further complaints to corporate and I got a response from a supervisor. The new offer was a "discount" from the full MSRP of the motherboard. I told them I didn't want to pay more for a replacement motherboard, plus repair fees and shipping than I paid for the original motherboard.   Eventually someone from corporate contacted me. I asked her why I couldn't get an advanced replacement, but as soon as my motherboard arrived at ASUS suddenly there was a motherboard available, 2 days later. She claimed that it wasn't different stock. The motherboards at RMA can't be used for advanced replacement. This is when I found that ASUS wanted me to pay full MSRP, repair fees, and shipping for a "repaired" RMA motherboard. I was also told that the RMA department throws out the manuals and accessories because they don't have room for them. She had no reason why ASUS forces customers to send all of that and pay extra to ship it if the RMA department is going to throw it all away.   After weeks of fighting, I finally gave in. She had agreed to a huge discount, no repair fees, no shipping and ASUS would pay my shipping. I figured it was worth it just to have a spare on my shelf. I insisted that I got a NEW motherboard, not a refurbished one and that the new motherboard's warranty be extended to the date it arrived plus some for my troubles.  No one that I spoke to cared that I have been buying and recommending ASUS for years. They didn't care that I used to sell their products. I think that the only reason they gave me a replacement motherboard was because I posted my experience on their facebook page where thousands saw it.  Guess when I'll buy another ASUS product?  They sure were not on the list of contenders for my gaming laptop that I bought last November.   All they had to do was turn the motherboard on, put a new bios on it and see if the USB would work. They refused to do it, even if I sent my motherboard back a 2nd time.   15 minutes of a tech's time could have saved decades long customer.   Except, they didn't have stock on the motherboard. She offered a different one that didn't have 3x physical PCIe slots. I found a motherboard that was a bit higher priced that had the 3 PCIe slots. I offered to buy that one and pay the difference and was told that that was impossible.  this is the tldr; version. I condensed the horror story as much as i could if not too much.
Not gonna lie, I was kind of hoping Jay would push those stacks of Asus boxes off the table in a dramatic outro as he said "you're fired". Either way, he absolutely hit the nail on the head with Asus caring more about their appearances than actually making a solid product. It's really ironic, they care so much about making money off the ROG brand and having good looking ROG hardware, that they forgot the core tenets of what got them there in the first place. It's all just lipstick on a pig these days. Meanwhile, I'm getting ready to upgrade my old Skylake rig with something from Ryzen 7000, and I'm seriously considering ASRock. The biggest reason why? I've been running an ASRock X470 Taichi in my home server for the past few years, and just recently put a 5950X in it. Besides the stock voltage being a little higher than I'd like, it's been a rock solid performer, to the point that I never even have to think about it. Unraid has been quite happy on that board
Z690 Formula. Had vrm block from aluminium, all of them have corroded. Not a single word from ASUS. EK going around putting fires out.
Think you should change motherboard on your personal rig. This will show if its Asus or AMD.  AMD should get the blame if Asus just are lazy.
I think I dodged a bullet by deciding to stay on AM4 for a while. Except for the TPM thing, but then, several hours of unfettered physical access needed to actually exploit that is more than secure enough for what I'm using my AMD PCs for...
Moronic cluelessness...shame on them.
I'd agree on ASUS comments. Got a TUF build and latest few bios cause no end of troubles. I've found an older bios that didn't cause any problems, CPU runs cooler, and don't get random freezes. There is something weird with ASUS bios not just latest gen but previous years - it's been going on for years.
My asus z790 apex came with a whole line of damaged pins and was badly bent.
Just canceled my ally pre-order. Was kinda on the fence after impulse buying anyway. I feel like I fell for the pretty products and marketing more than I should have as well. Big eye opener.
Swap your rig mb to the Taichi and see of it works better with your ram.
Unexpected tbh, but really brave step. Kudos, Jay.
And i was about to jump to am5 with asus motherboard,guess il stick with msi since i have no problems with x570 mb
Well hopefully they will care when hopefully millions of people will go another way when upgrading or building a new rig.. here’s hoping only the consumer can make companies change by not accepting bullshit. Whether it’s this or not pre ordering games when publishers think patch broken crap is ok.  We need to not put out money where our mouth is 😂
EVGA MOTHERBOARDS?!! is that still a thing?!?!?!?
There products are pretty and all but incredibly overpriced for what there selling you. In some cases it's fine but in 90 percent of the other products there way overpriced I personally think theres better options in all categories especially there motherboards. When I built my current pc and my first high end desktop I knew for years before while planning I wouldn't put a single asus or ROG branded product in my pc just because the pricing is so bad it's borderline insulting
Yeah yeah and then there is everyone going crazy over their overhyped handheld
Dude, you are just a glorified advertiser. You literally just take free product to advertise on the net then you get paid according to the views your advertisements get. You don't get to demand anything.
ROG more like FOG, F@ckery of Gamer's 😅
They don't care, but we do! So....... No ASUS for me! That's it. I'm done with them. How do you like them apples?!?!
*Everyone liked that*
This is sad cause Asus use to be so good now there gotten this bad
Love you, love you'r channel, thx for staying client oriented, thx for doing what you do, gritings from Russia! Kuban state krasnodar city waching ;)))) ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Now I feel dumb fur buying an Asus card. No coil whine tho”
I highly considered going with an Asus motherboard for my 7900x build I built last year and last minute, I went with MSI, and I do not regret my decision one bit at this point.
Well, now I'm nervous I've got an H470 Tuf motherboard running an older Intel i7 10700F and an Asrock B550 Taichi with a 5900 x 5900x was giving me issues so I'm using my 10700 until I can fix it.
Proud of you Jay. Thank you so much for all the work you do. Greetings from Austria
I've been building systems since 1993 and used to swear by Asus for not only my personal rigs but for my clients as well. Built a lot of industrial PCs, Non-gaming PCs and Gaming PCs all withh Asus motherboards and GPUs. I was quite the fanboy up until the last batch of workstations I built for a local medium sized business around 2014 began to fail, one after another. They were 4th gen 1150 boards with the Intel B85 chipset. Built 12 PCs for the company and within 6 mo. all but 2 failed with dead motherboards. 1 failed about a year in and the last one is still running today, surprisingly. Before that, I had only had one other Asus MB fail between 1993 and 2014. Switched to MSI for MBs and GPUs and haven't had any failures yet. Companies change hands, management changes, people that actually cared about the product and the consumer leave/retire etc. Still, it's a shame to see what used to be an awesome brand die. C'est la vie though, I guess.
I'm so happy you and Steve have come out about this. Like you said, ASUS has been doing poorly for awhile now. For me personally, I've had issues with the 2 ASUS boards I've owned; my friends have had issues with all of theirs; it's just a mess of a company. There's a reason there's so many open box ASUS boards on the market.
That really sucks :( are there even any good brands anymore?
I left ASUS about 3 years ago. I currently have an MSi x570 MEG Godlike with a Ryzen 9 5950x. No issues since I bought it 😊
This is like Ferrari offering a engine mod that boosts HP, but it might blow up the engine since they didn't test it thoroughly and than they can sue you afterwards for using the mod they were selling.
I completely agree. Asus was my go to for every component that they made when I built my first desktop in 2013 or so (Z87 chipset TUF mobo w/ i5 4590, Asus 1070 GPU) due to excellent quality and stability I got from my gaming series laptops I had bought from them before. My next PC was built at the tail end of 2nd gen Ryzen, right before 3rd gen was launched. chose the strix X-470F board paired with a 2700X,  since I still felt Asus was quality. My friend ended up picking up almost identical parts to me after I showed him my build. My build was like the devil PC. Random crashes in certain games constantly. His build was rock solid, out of frustration I ended up replacing different components over the next year to iron out the issues since I spent hours troubleshooting and swapping parts. The final change was the MOBO. Went to the ASRock steel legend B550. Followed by a change to a 3800XT CPU shortly after, but the 2700X was stable once the Mobo was changed. I would have written that experience off had I not done a ton of reading and learning about components in my quest to get my PC stable. After seeing the quality of Asus's parts go way downhill and seeing other people's experience with Asus support. I had already decided my next build would use ASRock or gigabyte Mobo. I did recently upgrade to the AM5 platform, I went with the 7900X and strix B650E combo micro center had for a ridiculously good price with the bundled Gskill ram. I really wanted the ASRock steel legend B650E Mobo, and considered leaving the strix sealed and selling it, and now I wish I had. I can say my system is very stable though, i updated my bios to the one they had released right before the X3D compatible one as I built my system a few weeks before the X3D's were available and flashed to the latest bios before ever installing windows. I was able to run the Gskill 6000 kit on expo 2 settings no issue, but hopefully my CPU didn't get damaged. I never paid attention to my SOC voltage levels as I just turned on Pb2 and left everything on auto untill I had time to do the negative offset curve optimizer tuning. I just updated my bios and still run expo 2, SOC voltage is safe, and I set up an 85C temp limit, -30 curve optimizer, 180PPT, 480TDC, 640EDC profile and it has been stable, so I'm sure I can undervolt it even more if I want to spend the time.
Jay, by now we really desperately need a video on who the good manufactures are. Everyone is either leaving the market or has a history of fucking things up
I was recently denied a warranty on a PG32UQX that I stupidly bought. The issue was in no way my fault and after going back and forth for a month about it they told me that I could pay somewhere around 1600 to have it repaired. I then received the monitor back in worse and completely unusable condition. So now I have a $2500 piece of trash hanging out in my attic because it'll probably make me puke to throw it out. So between that and having an x99 Rampage Extreme (this board took me 3 tries to have them send me a replacement) and Maximus 8 be the only motherboards I've ever had to RMA they've lost my trust. I just used an Asrock and Gigabyte motherboard in 2 new builds I just did and they're working great. For the monitor I honestly bought a decent korean monitor and I actually had an issue pop up and I sent it to them and had a new one in like 12 days after honestly great communication. So... I had way better support with a no name $600 monitor.
normally i use gigabyte and msi lol.  and asrock. last asus board i used the front usbs stopped working. switching cases didnt help the ports themselves didnt work.
Paid 50$ more for msi, hope its not a dud like asus
I'm so sad!  Asus had a decent run going compared to their competitors as far as avoiding scandals.  *sigh*
Now imagine politicians, policeman or health sector workers having the same attitude. Wait what … ?!?
Was gonna get an Asus board for my upcoming AM5 build, but.. I'll look elsewhere now.. 😱
I'd rather buy a BIOSTAR-, HUANANZHI-, ERYING- or MACHINIST-MoBo instead of an overpriced Gigabyte-, MSI- or ASUS-MoBo 😂😂
I began not using Asus' stuff a good while back. Ever since that presentation they had with AMD that time, where the dude from Asus stated some shit fact on stage that only Asus would be able to tame the AMD CPU's or some crap like that. Lisa Su replied "well, and a few others I think" ..  The point is, right then and there I already knew what Asus had become, they were SO high up on their own horse couldn't see where they shat. Take a guess where all that would land? Oh yeah. ...  I saw it then, said to myself, time to get out and havn't bought a single Asus product since that moment. It took a while to get here, but welcome to the same conclusion.
I bought a brand new $350 AM4 motherboard that didn't work. I did an RMA and they returned much older and scratched up version of the same board. So... I paid $350 for a new board and ended up with an old used scratched up messed up board that still didn't work.
I have a full AMD, MSI build (minus Ram, Corsair) and no problems. It IS last gen though...
Built my first pc 8yr ago and my asus mobo worked great so when I recently did my new built, I decided to go with asus again.  Now I can’t say it’s 100% asus fault but my pc was crackling when I would play games. I could physically hear it crackle. I undervolt   my cpu and my gpa and it fixed the problem but now I am wondering if my mobo was the actual problem.
This is big.  No Asus anymore? Guess I'm going Taiichi? someone please help me,,,
For them to put a premium on all of their products and have stuff like this happen is ridiculous.
Ive alresdy bought asn asus rog b650e-i mini itx motherboard last month ready for a build that i cant return 😑  So i need asus to fix everything 🤣
My friend had a 3080ti which was overheating and performaning like a 3060ti. We rma ir to msi and they sent TWICE the gpu untouched and then one that didnt even booot... At the 3ee attempt they finally had to send an actually new gpu. This is not just asus... This brands are all rediculous at this point.
I've used AsRock boards in ALL of my budget builds since the AMD RX300 series. Bios was pretty terrible to navigate back then lol but it's gotten better and most importantly I have not had any hardware issues whatsoever. For the price you couldn't beat em and now? Definitely a solid choice. All this being said I personally like the features you get with Gigabyte boards.
It seems that companies still have a pandemic era mentality where they think that consumers will put up with all kinds of crap just to get their hands on anything.
I'm really curious how long it takes Asus to buy it's way back into all the influencers builds.
i feel so bad for myself now that i build a full asus system in November 😅 unfortunatly i don't have any issues 😅 Strix B650-A 7700x Stock Strix Ryujin 1 fire extinguisher Strix Rx6900xt Lc (undervolted) ddr5 6000 on expo 1 (cl40) Strix sq7 m.2 ssd
I don't really mess around too much with LGA platforms but doesn't the PGA socket seem more safe? I mean, yeah there's a bunch of pins on the CPU that could get damaged but at least there's a sort of plastic housing on the mainboard for all the pins to slot into. LGA just seems to be... free floating? to some degree, just seems very fragile. I mean I know it works but damn, if there were some support substrate between each pin, seems like it would be a lot less prone to damage.
So get a Asrock gotchu
All this lack of quality control from PC manufacturers will inevitably lead to Microsoft taking over the whole market and supplying their own parts for gaming PCs
I was an Asus fan for maaaaany years but yeah i also abandoning it im switching to MSI. Also remember the Asus mother boards where a chip was in backward and it killed the Mother board ? loool when was it ? previous gen ? Also their Top tier Oled displays and the damn horrible broken Firmware updates they were pusing out to them constantly talking about the Asus Swift Oled pg43uq and pg48uq. one of the firmware update outright BROKE the display lol. Btw they are started to cheap out on the high quality chips on their Video Cards also just noticed it on my 4090 Tuf. Asus right now is at the level of Razer and Alienware, Big names shit products they all grown big in the past because their stuff was Quality and great now look at them bunch of overpriced trash.
I've engaged with them a few times over the years from both marketing scenarios where they were looking for people to make their promo videos and potential collaboration work with their hardware team to engaging with their customer service for their mobile products. It's usually been a race to the bottom in terms of funding things, where once they've released something, the whole team leaves and works on the next product removing support for their recently released hardware/software. As a kid I always trusted in their reliability in the motherboard marketplace but this feels like a nail in the coffin.
Asus quality has gone downhill for quite some time now my next upgrade will not be Asus
Dang, that's salty.       Salty as rock.
I don't believe in Asus crap excuse that the board with mashed pins got mixed up with the Influencer batch. Bull. Shit. Asus just don't give a fuck about their customers anymore.  Damn recently I just upgraded my PC after 8yrs and got a Asus Z790 TUF DDR5 board. Hope it doesn't catch fire and burn my house down.  Maybe PC enthusiasts need to start boycotting Asus products, just like what happened to Bud Light. Let them learn Customers are Kings.
thank you, honestly
Thanks Jay and Steve for informing us of this slimy behavior of ASUS.  As a first time builder (ariving from 14 inch 1080p APU laptop) who finally bought all the parts, some of which I acquired over the last 6 months (including my Asus ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI II) mobo to pair with a 5600X) and which I haven't been able to test out beyond looking for defects, I'm really hoping to not encounter issues. I absolutely would've went with a different company had I known this information given I'm aiming for 0 maintenance, 0 hassle, and 8+ yrs longevity. This is also why I choose an aircooler instead of AIO. Luckily I went with the previous generation (5000 series) knowing it's well tested (and cheaper than new platform) but I must admit I'm concerned ASUS implements a new bios and disregards their own warranties as they've just done for 7000series AMD CPUs.
Crazy my ROG STRIX 790 blow up YESTERDAY 😢😢😢🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 was wondering why I couldn’t enable XMC to get the full advantage of my ram
Damn this is heavy.  As a ROG fan it hurts.  I was planning an all AMD ROG build look like i have to reevaluate.
I sent out a Strix 3070 for RMA three times. Twice they sent back defective replacements. They finally resolved the matter by upgrading me to something beyond anything I was expecting, but this still bothers me.
Interesting. Regarding the device connectivity issue. I'm still running 3700X on ASUS ROG STRIX B550-I. Since the day 1 when I bought it in 2020 I had a usb issues for 2 years. I thought the AMD is who to blame but maybe the Asus has also something to do with that...
me watching this on my rog strix 17inch 4080 laptop
All the "shipping" problems could be a single guy somewhere who isn't happy with his $7.5 hourly pay. 🙂
Bullstuff 😂      Glaad I saw this video, building my dad a new computer and will look at other brands! You have been using Asrock for years so I will lean towards them 😊
❤
Had issues with Asrock as well with the x570 taichi.. RAM issues, volting etc. then the panel on the heatsink started to peel off. Thats computers for you lol
Good to see these failures. To be honest such humiliating catastrophes is good for their OVERBLOWN ego!
I really have to say Jay, this move just proves why I respect you so much. I truly hope others follow suit to help send a message to Asus. Great call on standing up for what's right!
Last armor crate update for me consume 10% of cpu even with solid rgb color, so i decide to remove armory crate and now I use signal rgb for the ram/mobo rgb
Man, this whole Asus debacle is such a bummer for me. I properly built my first PC three months ago and went with an Asus mobo because they had a good track record and in the last 6 years MSI, my previous mobo brand, kinda got a bad rep. Now I switched to Asus and got a B650X board (perhaps it is free of any potential issues) and now I'm kiiinda worried :c But I'm glad that the issues got revealed and that Jay is really putting his money where his mouth is.
I'm not about to do a new build just yet, but my Crosshair XIII Extreme is garbage too. The OLED display hasn't been working since a month after I got it. The 10 GbE NIC crashes my enterprise switch half the time when I download at speeds of 1 Gb+ for some reason. Finally that same NIC stopped working altogether and I tried to get an RMA, jumping through way too many hoops. None of the suggestions helped, of course, but they still didn't want to approve the RMA. Then one day randomly the system crashed and didn't want to power on anymore for half an hour or so. Eventually it started working again magically and the NIC as well as the OLED display were suddenly working again?!? A few days later the OLED started displaying garbage again, but the NIC is back to its crappy old self. Suffice it to say the firmware is terrible.  Not to mention that I had to completely change all the memory timings to get the system running stable at all. Ah well, not sure what to buy for my next build anymore.
I just worked 2 hours overtime. I came home to grab my excess ram on my new build, drove half an hour in the middle of the biggest rain storm. Got compensated and drove back... i have an asus motherboard sitting in a box... now i am wondering if this is the canery in the mine. Maybe just... go to the store and change the board out. Buy something better... it would remove the bundling and thus make everything more expensive as well as make my already headache inducing moments being there, probably give the next microcenter employee i speak to have an entire migraine... but that's a lot of time and money to have in my build to just go to waste. I will have to find new ram for example.
I'm loving Phil's soundboard of alternate curse words for Jay's rants.
I've been a long time ASUS fan - but not anymore. Their products were sh*t for a while now but I'm glad to see it finally blowing up in their face.
👍
Aside from a two or three posts, how big is this problem? Does anyone know how many AMD CPU's have gone Chernobyl?
When you start cutting cost to improve profit over everything else.  When you rely on the wealthiest consumers as a business model it is best to provide the best kind of customer service.
awesome video jay!  yea I started to see a problem when their TUF series boards about 5 years ago started reducing their warrenties.  I always look for boards with a 5 year warrenty but they are very hard to find now :/
Never liked their motherboards... Do like their laptops.
I was about to make a build with asus z790 board. thank you!! guess I need to find another board
I appreciate you and GN holding Asus to account but so far nobody has said what x670e Asus owners should do? Should we dump the boards now? It's costly but it can be done.
I built a system about 10 yrs ago using an asus motherboard. It was so unstable it was a nightmare. Tried everything. Swapped memory multiple bios. Nothing worked. Never purchased anything asus since.
One thing i am trying to figure out are all am5 asus boards subject to the over volting? Or is it just the extreme ones? I have a b650e-f and my 7900x and idk what the voltage is supposed to be.
Goddamn, I thought Asus was the most reliable brand.  I just started upgrading my rig, starting with GPU which is asus 6700xt dual. Hopefully it doesn't have any problems since it's on the way. I was going to upgrade to Asus TUF AM5  a620 matx before end of the year along with all other new components, but it seems like I will stick need to look for other brand. Which is such a shame, I think quality of the manufacturing itself and the looks is the best. But it seems like whatever they will make something good with that is on the air
Damn, and they were my fav brand.  O we’ll time to move on.
Glad to see you're moving away from Asus Jay, when i was using a Asus motherboard i was having constant back to back problems and eventually said enough is enough sold the motherboard and bought an EVGA motherboard. I am very happy that i went to EVGA and so far I've had a really great experience with team EVGA.
I have Asus Rog Strix B550-A Gaming. Is that MB affected as well?
Ive had no confidence in ASUS for a while now. Hardware software and laptops that die so quickly. High rate of failures per sale of any manufacturer. Terrible support i refuse to use them anymore.😢😢
Asus is the new Bud Light.
I have an Asus x13 with their (stupid) proprietary XG Mobile 3080 and have had nothing but issues with it, all relating to the Asus setup. Their factory overclock with the XG mobile is completely unstable. The wifi chip they used (MediaTek) has nothing but issues. wifi throttling from 800mbs to about 2-4mbs, and bluetooth cutting off completely every couple minutes. (which is made worse by the fact that the previous intel one they used was great and they only changed it because the new one is cheaper) And their soldered memory running unstable at XMP profiles. I have tried everything from bios updates to full reinstall of both windows 10 and 11. Their customer service has been truly a nightmare and honestly insulting at times that even though I was really looking forwards to the ROG Ally I doubt I will get it as I've had so many issues with Asus hardware for years now and this is the last straw for me.
shoulda kicked evga to the curb a long time ago with all their failing cards
Reminds me of the thermaltake situation all over again 😬
Enough, it's Made in China! That's the problem and that will be a problem until we build our Technology here in the states. All of our motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, memory, SSDs, audio cards, routers, switches etc.. should be Made in the USA from now on because we are at WAR with the Chinese, North Korea and Russians and the Chinese don't want us to progress, they don't want us to have a secured system, this is something we need to alert our U.S. Senators, U.S. Congressmen, NSA, CIA, FBI and mostly our trade agreement partners. Expect garbage from anything Made in China. They are laughing at us right now. Intel should make their own brand of motherboards but they haven't tried it yet. I feel sorry Jay it's the Chinese that don't like us.
I run Asus TRX40 extreme and ASUS Strix 4090. As a big fan of ASUS for high-end product stack, I refuse to buy any more ASUS products until they respond officially on how to address all these concerns.
I am currently researching upgrades to my motherboard, CPU and ram.  I've been using asus for a long time and it was a lock as my motherboard choice until I watched this video and the one from gamer nexus.  I'm done with asus
To be honest, MSI is the only company I trust out there. I have been using MSI parts since Pentium 4 age (not so far back, but any way) and everything works flawlessly even with excessive overclock over these years. MSI for the win and my head is quite.
I recently replaced my Strix Z690-E after having constant freezing issues, RAM issues, and literally RMAing EVERY piece of my system aside from the processor. I basically got the attitude of, we don't care. I replaced it with an MSI MEG Z690 Unify board and magically most of the problems went away. I'm still having some stability issues that I'm working with Intel on(I've had the same 12900K in my system through all of the issues since I built it a little over a year ago), but other than that, it's been a solid experience since replacing the motherboard. I did buy the TUF 4070ti, but honestly, as was mentioned, their graphics arm is pretty solid. Having said that, when I upgrade in a few generations, there will be absolutely no ASUS products used, and that's kind of a shame.
I'm going to buy a gaming laptop from Asus. I'm glad that I heard this crap before actually put my money into their pocket. I'm moving a lot and I want a gaming laptop that I can play and work every where, I saved up 2 years for this one. That laptop is 2 fking grands and if Asus did shitty warranty like what they have for their mobos, I would be screwed big time. Thank you Jay, you did a big favor for me and everyone.
I guess I've been lucky with ASRock motherboards. I've used them for years with no issues.
My ASUS Tuf F15 had been nothing but a nightmare since I got it. Daily blue screens, bottlenecking a 3070 with a 4 core CPU. This was their top tier Tuf laptop on the intel side. I’m never buying from this company again.
i fired asus way back after they failed to do a warranty anything on my a8n-sli deluxe. fan on the board failed within a year and they bounced me around for a month, did nothing. ironically some years later the same customer support agent climbed the corporate ladder and was my contact while working as a bench tech. she was just about as useless as she was as a support agent. 🤦‍♂
Does anyone know if this has been the case with ASUS AM4 boards/CPU's as well?
isn't the bios download considered entrapment more or less?
I don’t comment often Jay, but I just wanted you to know that I really respect your ethical principles. It gives me confidence in you and in your channel. Thank you.
They really f*cked up good. They are considered a top tier manufacturer, but when you go about your business like this they really lost touch with reality. It's a shame really... I've used many Asus boards and cards but now i'm definitely steering away from them. Thanks for your honesty Jay!
I used to exclusively run EVGA boards because of the company but then went to Ryzen 1 before they had a board available. So I went for an Asus Crosshair 6 hero and the board was good... after at least a year of bios updates. I still have random USB dropouts with the board. If I could have gotten a EVGA X570 FTW board I would have jumped ship, but I'll wait to see if EVGA releases a board for the X670 or X770 chipsets then I'm jumping ship again back to the loving arms of EVGA. PS my ancient P55 Classified motherboard still works flawlessly over a decade later. Glad to see the community call out a large company for their BS when it seems like they believe they're too big to fail.
So,I have a new asus x670 board with a 7800x3d. Gladly no problems. I limited SoC to 1.25v due to RAM overclocking anyway. Anyway, I saw that bios update and decided not to install it a few days ago before the media reported about it. That description of voided warranty made me back off,gladly so. It’s my first asus mobo,I always thought they earned their high reputation. My board was the best value for its price compared to other brands,so I don’t regret the decision,especially since it’s working normally. Just wondering if I made my switching am4 to am5 platform decision a lil bit early
There are problems with asus z690 too. I'm lately have a struggle with a bunch of PC's on rog strix z690-f we're using in my job workstations. USB ports are just not working correctly (especially 20Gbit ones), random disconection, only charging without data, not working at all or adding a lot of latency when you plug a keyboard...
I'm building a new computer soon and I was once a ASUS fan and now I'm not thanks for the Info Jay means a lot to me and I'm sure the community as well.
Hey Jay, my Intel 12900k build has been unstable too, so I don't think it's AMD, switched to an MSI board from my z690 hero and no problems at all, cheaper board too.
Wow, I'm surprised by this. I've been using Asus motherboards for 20 years and never had issues with them. Heck, I have an old AMD A8 on an Asus board running as a media server. I guess I'll look for other brands for my next build!
When Jay says he switched to micro star you done goofed up.
That's a shame. I used ASUS ROG boards in my last three builds especially when I had major problems with MSI boards in a store bought computer. But my latest build I was advised by my supplier not to use an ASUS X790E Maximus Extreme board. Instead the supplied an MSI X790E Pro WI FI board with a Ryzen 9 processor and touch wood no problems.
I got a Strix B650E with a 7900x and everythings running nicely.  I stay away from Beta BIOS tho
Really they are less problematic than world of warships 🤷🏻‍♂️  The outage!  So bad that hardware is hard but pay to win crappy games is ok lol  Time to cancel asus
I wish Jay ended this with “And Armoury Crate SUCKS BALLS!”
Someone high up at ASUS seems to be shamelessly maximising profit - or hiding huge losses. Not many brands with a solid financial situation would scam/cheat their customers out of their warranty, that kills their customer base AND has legal repercussions, so there's either a situation where someone wants to make the numbers look good, or extract every single penny before the company crumbles. ASUS has put themselves on a piedestal, and now they've fallen off of it.
Their laptops are GARBAGE!
I hope ASUS finally gets their ass up and think about more of customer support and the software side of their products.... Also, the prices compared to other brands is just stupid...
For me this is unfortunately a bit too late, am running a 7900x with a 4080 on an ASUS B650-Plus since just a few days ago... having sooo much trouble, desperately trying to fix it. So I guess I'm just gonna swap out the mobo. Thanks for the honesty, Jay. This is good to know.
Good on you Jay. I am switching on MSI. Still on AM4 but i dont care!.
Blame AMD sorry ass products
Let's hope it's not the same with the Rog Ally
Good. Love you taking a stand and gald you are able to take the hardline on Asus suss BS.
If ASUS sucks now which brand of motherboards can we trust?
Has gigabyte bought asus?😂😂
Honestly we should've fired Asus over Armoury Crate ages ago. It's malware. Gotta love when your Z690 Prime _Wifi_ installs Armoury Crate onto Windows, yet _doesn't_ manage to install the driver for the _wifi card._
I love the edit. Stuff. Gold. We're all thinking it, don't worry our minds substitute the original dialogue back in :D
I'll stick with MSI and ASRocK as I've never had issues with them.... ever.
Isn't ASrock a subsidiary of Pegasus (Asus**)?
I was actually looking at an asus board for when i upgrade to am5. I got everything else in white, chrome or acrylic. Was looking at asus for a white motherboard. I dont wanna have to paint anything but looks like i might have to now.
ASUS was my “to go” brand since my monitor  in 2014. Ever since I always consider them as a number 1 while searching for anything I need from tech world. And now I am gonna to build my first pc since 2018 (which is from ASUS) and there won’t be a single part of this company in there. I’ve seen enough in the last month or so.
Between this and your "Dear PC industry" video, the state of things is... not good
I‘ll boycott Asus from now on!
ASUS Shares droping...
I'll be avoiding the Republic of Garbage from now on.  I've been an Asus customer for 10 years since their FIRST ITX ROG.  My last ASUS rev 1 board had wiring issues making 5.1 audio impossible.  They also removed SPDIF from their B550-i board..  I was so happy that they fixed it on AM5 and I promptly built a sweet ITX machine with a B650E-i. Now I have SPDIF cutting out while watching movies and I can't use EXPO anymore?
Ive always used msi boards, but went with Asus for z690.. aside from the Hero debacle (yeah, i had a bad board), my experience has been solid.  Went with the z690 Apex as the replacement, and I've had no issues.
I think the only brand that is forever solid is nintendo. Nintendo is full of piece of shit that hate their customers, but they put out good product that people will forever buy
Hmm I don't have these mobos but this is a bad practice. Gonna stay away from Asus Brand in the future. My current mobo and GPU is Asus Strix.  Gamer Nexus also released a video bashing Asus today. Well done Asus you are doing an awesome job XD
@JayzTwoCents I have their rog zenith 2 extreme alpha and I had the same issues with playing games I would lose my audio only!!! So this is happening even on a 3970x still! On a what was a 1000 dollar motherboard…. One thing I was thinking when you said you didn’t like the MSI Dragon I was like what about ROG ITS EVERYWHERE on anything ROG.. they have to say the quotes they made up like 100 times!! Lol
I have a all corsair and asus build and I guess it's time to make some changes in the future when I upgrade. I just don't know what other company to go with next at this point.
This is why I've stuck with ASRock ever since I started building my systems. I haven't had any problems with ASRock stuff (aside from me borking my own stuff) in the last 5 years.
good to know, i been a asus buyer and system builder since 2005.  i had no idea things were this bad...
i hope that they DO care. i hope someone well up the ladder finally sits up in their fancy chair and goes "wtf are these idiots doing to my nice brand?" but i doubt they will, until it costs them a LOT of money. but then again, i feel like that part might not be too far away. if they are hiding behind "make them do a FOIA request for it", there's almost certainly something they don't want people to do a lot of talking about.  but even if ASUS corporate has it's head too far up it's own butt to care about you doing this, i know that as a long-time watcher, i sure appreciate it. like you said, it's not about having problems or not. if a company gets big enough, it's eventually going to have problems. but when that company handles the problems like THIS? yea, that doesn't cut it. none of us single end users has a chance to see as much as you people do from working directly with these companies. big props for sharing it like you see it.
I respect the decision. I have already bought an  ASUS board for my latest upgrade and hope it works out. That said, if you click show all then there is an official BIOS with the protection as well. It's version 1303 for the crosshair
My Z690 Asus Formula board blue screens randomly all the time. I thought it was normal or Windows related till I saw this. Not buying Asus anymore after building exclusively with Asus components for a decade. Bye bye Asus!
I always wondered why Asus had some of the most complicated and stupid RMA forms on their homepage. I'm not far of from ordering new parts to my new system and I will no longer be sticking with Asus, which has always been my go-to brand. Gigabyte here I come 🙂
This was so sick!  I'm gonna tell all my friends building new pc's to avoid asus hardware
I just bought all Asus Pc parts... You should have been abit faster :D
I pretty much gave up on Asus in 2020 when I went thru FIVE boards and all of them would die within hours... I went to a Gigabyte Aorus Elite Wifi X570 board, and I haven't had any issues with it yet..
I used to work at a place that got pc parts for rma. We used to bend flat the pins on the motherboards and cpus because it looked neat. We had no idea about the voided warranty. I'm sure we ruined things for hundreds of people.
Well is ASUS my problem with my 7900x build. I can’t even get windows to update without constantly giving me blue screen of death. I even had to format the drive and start over at one point. 😢
ASRock doesn't have a valid warranty policy and rarely support their own GPUs. I've had multiple bad 6900xt GPUs from them in a row and they never honored the warranty.
Thankyou Jay and team for the fantastic report. Keep fighting the good fight! 💪
Asus's brand is in the dump and they should care because they are not only losing you Jay as a customer, but they are losing the average customers like me.  I bought an Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi motherboard and one of the hot spot temperature gradually went up and up over months until the PC was crashing at first just from gaming basic games to eventually just using basic tasks like surfing the web or watching videos or just turning it on.  I did got Asus to replaced it with the new Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II motherboard, but one of the hotspot temperature is even worse than the previous motherboard.  So I don't even want to turn up the game settings because I don't want to burn out this motherboard.  This motherboard will probably last until the 3 year warranty is over starting from the previous motherboard before it burns out, even though I am babying it.  I am so disappointed with Asus. I thought the motherboard would be rock solid and last me at least a decade or two, but now I am already thinking about building a new PC in a year or two.  I have lost all confidence in Asus.  So I am following PC techs just so I would know which parts I would want to use in the upcoming build.  American car manufacturers build into their cars an expiration date so consumers would have to spend money to fix it or buy a new one.  The Japanese however focused on quality and durability, and Americans are now buying Japanese cars instead of American cars.  I'll be damn if consumers would buy anything Asus in the upcoming years.
Hello, as Jay has said. I didn't adopt a new platform. I have just upgraded my RIG. I went from ryzen 5 3600 to ryzen 7 5800x3d and I went from rx5700xt to rtx4080 I also have upgraded PSU from EVGA 650W to Seasonic Vertex 1200W. I'll stick with this for next 2years. I was afraid to move from AM4 to AM5. Great videos Jay, thumbs up!
Good for you, Jay.  Well done.  Ive had to get 2 x570 ITX boards from Asus for my SFF build. Audio issues and USB header issues.  They took months and months to get it repaired, and they didnt make it easy to RMA.  Going with EVGA and MSI for now on, and MSI arent a great company either. Only motherboard manufacturer worth the money and ACTUALLY seems to give a shit about their customers is EVGA. Ive had two EVGA boards: my x58 board lasted 7 years before I upgraded my i7-920 to an i3-8350k and an EVGA mATX z370 and I've had that board running 24/7 since 2018, over 5 years without a problem. 5.1ghz OC and its been running as my Plex server and my wife's gaming system.  EVGA needs to move to the MOBO business, because that's the kind of mfg I want to support and devote my money and builds to.
For years and years I've had a rock-solid view of Asus. My current build from 2017 has a B-350F and a 1070 Rog strix. I was dead-set on upgrading later this year and going all-out Asus. Not anymore though, not after seeing how much trouble people are seeming to have suddenly. I might as well take MSI or Gigabyte if I can't get that "feeling of trust and solidity" that Asus has given off earlier. Bye Asus.
I was just going to buy a Z790 extreme motherboard to pair with my i9-13900KS and strix 4090oc too but wow not anymore. I'm lost in what to buy now.
Interesting I have been blaming AMD for my constant USB issues with my current system. I'm now thinking it could be my b550 strix mobo. It's a shame evga don't make AMD mobos
Respect
Heh get Linus on bann wagon jay heh
I’ve been using an Asrock Z170 board for 5 or 6 years and I have no complaints. It’s sad what’s happening with ASUS; they used to be my go-to company.
I'm pretty sure that 'voids your warranty' part wouldn't hold up in court. As its offered by the manufacturer themselves and would probably violate lemon laws
Glad to see you and others taking a stand.  I had a terrible support experience with them years ago that made me boycott the brand for myself and any PC build for friends/family.  And for the cost of some of these products, there's no excuse for not providing real support.
It would be an awesome video to see you change the motherboard in your personal rig from ASUS to MSI. Assuming MSI  would fit your build (colour and size), then comparing stability
Yes have to agree Asrock is solid Asrock, though technically Asrock is owned by ASUS in a roundabout way.   I currently use the Asrock Phantom Gaming X and my experience with support was actually great, I was having an issue with the chipset fan, it was super noisy and kept stopping so I contacted support, I was told that the chipset on this board was supposed to run kinda hot and the fan maybe not be needed anyway.  But the guy asked for my address and sent me a replacement fan anyway no muss no fuss.   I have been using Asrock now for years and have never had an issue personally motherboard wise though I have no experience with their other products.
Recently purchased a z790-e, serious system instability. Games just closed, took ages to boot, just unusable . Sent back for rma, received a credit, after a month….. complained about it and got another board with damaged pins. Eventually went elsewhere and got the same board where I could look at the damn thing. I can honestly say for a £600 board it should have been perfect from day 1… ASUs will not be my first choice in future builds. Well done jay for being honest and for that your one of the most reliable “influencer” out there
ASUS about to end up on the wrong side of the bell curve
And the thing is, the CPU killing bug is something you can TEST WITH A MULTIMETER.  Like, what the actual F, once it's been pointed out, how freaking dumb do you have to be to not fix it correctly when literally the most basic piece of test equipment can tell you if you're still screwing up.  The mind boggles.
It's a shame companies chose to go down this route. Razer have done the same, cheap rubbish now.
MSI. Gigabyte, Newegg, Asus.. etc.. one by one, they lined up for Summer Roast!
Here we go again. Another youtube hate train.
I know this video is mainly in regards to ASUS but man AM5 has had the worst launch I’ve seen for a new platform since I’ve gotten into the PC scene over 10 years ago. Glad I just upgraded my Asrock Taichi X570 system with a 5800x3d today. Going to run my AM4 platform for awhile after hearing about all these issues with the AM5 platform. What a nightmare to go through, especially with how expensive these new boards are.
Btw beware with MSI Firmware. Hackers published the private keys and can enable malware.
Yes, come and join the Lucky Dragon. Mwa ha ha ha.  Or the Aorus / Mechanical Bird Gigabyte use.
Been a msi fan for years and I think that'll stay that way for years to come
One "bigger brand" than Asus from history who utterly failed is IBM within the consumer space (see OS/2 history).  Those who don't heed the warnings of the past are doomed to repeat mistakes, even if those mistakes were made by a completely different group of people.
So my next Mobo choice is now reduced to Aorus or ASRock
Meanwhile Linus   ASUS ROG ALLEY
Wow Asus has always been my go to, as was EVGA.  So much research to do before my next upgrade.
Ah so you have made OC and that is why you have had problems with ASUS maybe :) ?
Roast Time !!! 😂🤣😁
I've been on Gigabyte since 2005. Zero problems.
Jay, I can tell this is an emotional piece.   Good on you for speaking up. Your're doing the right thing. Thank you for looking out for your viewers, as you always have.
The 570 Taichi I got from ASRock originally BSODed like crazy, long story short, after trying to fix it for a few weeks, 1 week of waiting and they sent me a new one.  Been stable for like 4 months now.  So yeah, ASRock has come a long way.
Lol I had a ton of issues way back when I built my z370 intel build. Asus Board. Replacing the motherboard made it 10x more stable. Same parts in a MSI board and it's been running perfectly stable for years. Haven't bought assus since then for anything.
@JayzTwoCents - I just sent a motherboard to ASUS for repair.  They took over a week to tell me that the board was too old and that they could no longer get parts for it from their head office.  They charged a diagnostic fee to send it to them when they could have determined the parts availability before having me send it to them.  I wanted it repaired because all my software is licensed to the processor and board.  I have had to resort to purchasing from the used market to get a board to work with my existing hardware so that I am not forced to pay thousands of dollars to re-purchase all my software and new hardware.  I asked them several questions as to what may have caused the issue incase I could claim it through APC's insurance (was is surge related?), and they would not provide any details.  I have had other problems with asking about parts from them before too.  They are very anti-right to repair.
Every 10 years I give them a try....  In the past 30 years, every time I've purchased a Asus MB, it's failed.  I don't overclock,  I use properly specs mem, and their MB's just fail.  I've always ended up going back to Gigabyte. I do like Asrock, and have used them many times in the past.  They make fine base motherboards that just work.  Asrock just hasn't had the higher end specs of the more expensive lines.  I'm glad to see you won't be pitching Asus any more....  ( their video cards have been good to me though... )
god damn... i just upgraded my PC when 7600 came out and bouht b650-plus from Asus.
Remember DFI LANPARTY Boards?, they came with dualBios ^^
I bought the Asus Ryujin II 360. It went out after about 6 months. I sent it in for a repair just for them to tell me they can't fix it and have no replacements so they are giving me my money back. That's great, but I actually wanted the Ryujin II 360.
As much of a pain that it is.. I'd keep the AMD CPU and change out the motherboard and change up the theme.
You say they don't care, but they will.. I've been a loyal Asus supporter for years and years, my experience with the x670e has been poor, this has been the first time I used AMD processors in close to 20 years and it's been the most unstable system I've ever had, and watching how Asus has handled this has made it clear to me it's time for a brand swap. I'm sure others will be joining along as well. I don't wish them to fail, but I sure hope they feel a sting and learn and course correct.
Guess this means the next mobo i get will be something OTHER than asus (yes I used small letters 🤣)
At this point id rather go with Biostar than asus. In fact. I think i'll put my money where my mouth is and purchase a Biostar mobo.
I have been an ASUS Fanboy for YEARS, This is Disgusting to hear. I also have been a JTC Fanboy for just as long. I'm going to take Jayz word over Asus every time though because he is here to not only entertain but Inform buyers and builder on products all over the spectrum. Its sad, I'm heartbroken to hear, but I'm glad you made this video before I went out and built my wife a new PC because I was going to do an all ASUS build for her as I did with mine in 2019-2020 (Z390F, intel 9900k, 2080 super and Ryujin 360) now ima have to look into new companies. Thank You Jay For Being So Honest And Truthful and Not Afraid To Call Out Big Companies. We Love You.  P.S ASUS Fix You're Sh!t, You Just Lost a Customer after hearing this. Do Better, Builder Better, Game Better. ASUS DBG Edition*
it sad to see I have been a Asus customer since I built my  intel i9 haswell.
I tried to RMA a motherboard for a customer that had the same issue as my x570-E with a 3800x. They had a Prebuilt Motherboard that was a Strix x570 rebranded. I spent hours on a phone and eventually got told to screw off. Issue was it would crash if more than one stick was in the board, overclocking immediately fails.  My new x570 board now gives a weird ssd error. tried components in another computer non asus board no problem. It hitches like crazy after bios update.   Glad that it’s not me it’s Asus
This is the reason why I stay subbed to Jay and Steve and other tech channels that call brands out on their bullshit. It's not acceptable to be so at the top and forget that you need to do right by your consumers.  Glad your willing to tell em how it is and let em know that you're no longer doing business with them.
Not fit for use
Yeah recently I don't even know what to buy anymore... ASUS has been pretty high quality so far with whatever I bought from them.  But recently Z690 Hero, Z690 Formula (VRM Block and a bug driven NIC) and so on and so forth, have really let me down.  Especially for such high end and costly products, this is not acceptable
Ure Fired
If anyone is getting ready to throw away some ASUS monitors tho
Asuck Republic of Garbage
Glad I bought a MSI GPU, RIP EVGA
Eh.. kudos for going hard but banning ASUS forever is probably going a little hard? Their actions are hella scummy but they can still turn themselves around
I am using MSI, and I haven't experienced any problem like this for years. The first time I setup ASUS system, I felt something wrong. That computer is not having lot of problem, but I just not comfortable with it. Therefore I always use MSI since. I don't know, feels fragile.
ASUS really have been dropping their game on QUALITY and focused a lot on HYPE and QUANTITY. Just make a _few_ very good MB ya know.
Hi, JayzTwoCents store?  Yes, I'd like to order a set of Jay's titanium balls.
Then I buy AsRock next time lol
I love the sign off "but you dont care", I'm sure ASUS will care now when 4 million subs know not buy their product.
Totally appreciate this! It shows ASUS that they either need to work on correcting this, or just go broke.  BTW, Jay... If you want to donate your old ASUS stuff... I'll take it! My kids often need parts... They break things often enough.
I just got an asus tuf 4090 it’s great but I think I was having issues and I called them and THEY TOLD ME IT WAS CUZ MSI AFTERBURNER cuz THEY USE GPU TWEAK!!! Lol that’s the gpu technical support they give!!!!!!!! So I do have time to send it back but I don’t think now it’s that I just think games crash time to time cuz every triple A game is total trash for optimization when it comes to PC..
The 5th Wall .. your Roof.  Remember “We’re so sorry, Uncle Albert. But we (ASUS) haven’t done a bloody thing all day”.  Actually, most, if not all the lyrics fit the topic here.
I have a ROG Strix X670E Gaming WIFI motherboard and a Ryzen 7 7950X3D and have been experiencing issues with the sudden Blue Screen for no reason whatsoever and then getting the 0d error code which takes me ages to eventually fix.
This is ASUS's Bud light moment.
I have an X370 and X570 Asus TuF boards and both have had their Realtek NIC die.  I am done with them...again.  I don't know  why I have to spend $800 to get an Intel NIC but that's where we are, I guess.
Wow! I got the X670E for Christmas/Birthday. Haven't done anything with it yet still in the box since I need a card. Am I safe to use it still?
Asus laptops work fine,luckly
Wow this is sad. Asus has always been my go to. Guess that's changing.
omg sane my motherboard was the ROG Maximus hero z790  motherboard and I had to ram it 3 times the first time 3 cpu pins were bent on arrival the 2 time the internet on motherboard won't work and the 3 time the usb on the back would now work and the 4 word they sent had like big scratches on the back plate and looks like track damage near ram but I dont care any more just whant my 850 dollar motherboard to work. also the RMA was super hard and like 180 dollars is shipping 3 times bad experience never again picking ASUS also ASUS Was always know for good stuff now its bad lost trust in brand never again.
Never buying ASUS products again tbh after I looked into more of their past too. Dodgy as
others "ROG Ally pretty good"  Jay: "IM DONE."
YESSSSSSSSSSS!!  Say it as it is brother!  I'm on an ASUS X570 board:  So far, so good, but it may be my last!  To me it's a matter of principle, and I don't like companies that do shady shit!  Been on Linux exclusively for over a decade because of it!, and have stricken many disingenuous companies off my list over the years and willing to pull the plug on more in a heartbeat, when I hear good reasons not to trust them!  They do it to themselves and if more people wouldn't take it up the you know what and instead tell them where they can stick it, they wouldn't be out of freaking control in the first place!  Jay, you kick ass!!!
Tapping my foot here nervously after getting an ASUS bundle from microcenter.
I bought their intel board quite recently and I regret doing that. Actually I’ve been using their boards since 2011 and I loved them, but I’ll never buy an Asus product after that. That’s just disgusting behavior.
I went with Asrock for my old 4790k Z97 Extreme 4 build. and my god that board was great, its still going. its now a media centre pc that sits under the big screen and occasionally plays emulators.
It's 2023, and my wife's ASUS ROG mobo with a 5950x still has issues with the back USB ports. I'd also like to fire ASUS.   I'd like for all 10 ports to work properly all the time, not just when we only avoid using any of the ports at the very top.
Stop using the brand on my last cpu of intel I had 3070k. Back then I  told many for years great motherboards bad software all of it the AI suite & bios don't even get me started on Armor crate that auto downloads auto downloads  whether you want or not want it's on in the bios by default like a dell extended warranty.   I help pubg pro e-sports players as a moderator on Twitch. I help them fix there pcs & tune them.  Can't tell how many times Armor crate has caused conflicts with the gpu & other pc parts in the rig where in game it shows high FPS of like 200 plus yet feels like less than 30 fps in game.  Once all of Armor crate is removed and never installed again the system you could say is like fixed.   Now other motherboards have crap bloated like spyware apps & software but Asus takes the cake with conflicts & problems.  Do you self a favor if you can never use software from any motherboard brand it's all like spyware to sell your data via services.  it's in mice software corsair razer Logitech  motherboard apps. Put this way just like Windows selling your data so are they at the cost of your pc performance in FPS resources.   Things that these apps report you ask ?  Ok then what monitor  you use & it's resolution, What game your playing What mouse you use how much ram you have what gpu you have. What motherboard you have.    The hard part is getting so many loyal customers of the brand to do so as they always say oh but I love them I have been using them for years in till they have there first problem but by then it's to late.   it's sad they had a brand name up there almost with like Sony & Asus made a name for them selves being a top brand but let them selves go  at the cost of there name.    Thanks Jay for standing your ground on this matter & standing up for the consumers & viewers.  ✌❤
Damn, I returned a 5700x ex just recently, did not even consider rolling back the BIOS, but the CPU worked for a least 1 day so it may be the CPU, but still wish I had checked if BIOS was the issue first
Lenovo did the exact same thing to me so , i will fire them and never buy from them again . Big like for this video , brands need to do better , pc hardware is so expensive now that crap like this should never happen , but it does very often .
Ok let’s say Axxx sucks now, then which big PC component brand do you trust now?
Had a terrible time overclocking RAM with the TUF B650M. Switched to the ASRock HDV, no issues.
That is a example of standing up for yourself and for other . Applause for you
Love my Gigabyte Aorus!  Thanks for the heads-up on Asus.  For shame for shame Asus 😠👎
ok. then ASUS mainboard is deleted out of my wishlist for my next PC (sadly 😔, cause i have ASUS Z87-A and it never had 1 error in almost 10 years )
Thank you for making this video. I am currently in the market for a motherboard and I was going to get an Asus but after all this there is now way I am giving them my money. Any suggestions for Intel 13th gen motherboard?
This is just tragic. I moved over to Gigabyte after X370 and am on the Aero x570s currently.
Hats off to you sir. But if I may ask, you going to use that TUF X670E plus mobo right there?
those pins smashed look like a perfect thumb print lmao.
Thanks for standing up for us Jay.  After watching GN and you, not only do I no longer shop at Newegg, I also am no longer purchasing ASUS anything.  Thanks!
Only thing ASUS I use is their monitors and GPUs
Thankfully I have chosen MSI boards for my two builds that I've done.
hahahaha, welcome to the party pal. i've been saying this for 10-15 years now.  Asus is a trash ass producer of PC parts, customer service, and responsibility.
Is this Axxx vs YouTubers lol xd
I had the same problem with a motherboard 3 years ago as the apex, but it was on maximus hero one and the pins where smashed in just about same spot, but didnt get any from either supplier or ASUS cuz the motherboard doesnt get sent like that they just responded, so it was money down the drain, had to buy a completely new one.
Asus has declined so much its not even funny anymore. I remember baxk in x58 days asus was like the only option. Then reports for x99 asus boards killing cpus. Msi is what asus used to be
Agreed. This isn't just for some $60 motherboard. Some of them are $700. For $700, I expect the red carpet to be rolled out. This makes me worry because I have an ASUS TUF motherboard.
I got the white apex board as soon as it was available. Came from china warehouse. Soooooo Nice $800 kind of well spent.  But my Corsair AIO wont keep my 13900k cool enought when overclocking. This board makes a Sweet all white build.
i bought a asus motherboard a while back and it 100% just didnt work amazon wouldnt even keep the reciept for it still sitting in my fucking cuboard
Just built an ASUS x670e 7950x3D rig, with an ASUS 4090  in an ASUS GT-502 case. Last time I used an Asus mobo, it was nothing but problems. This "second chance" build is as well.   There won't be a third chance after this.
Jay is the best.
I’ve always bought MSI MB never had issue in 4 generations of builds.  Still on MSI AM4
Steve's video and this should be the FINAL wake up call for ASUS to get their act together!
this is a bummer since i wanted to make a mini itx build soon and asus looked like it was the best. but im not trusting their am5 platform, or anything else they make
This is good to know. I've had Asus motherboards for a few decades as they have been reliable. Have to see if they up the game or keep this sh*t going. Thanks Jay.
I haven't considered anything asus for a long long time now and im happy i did.
Were there some VRM or capacitors also missing on that board near the ruined pins? Cant wait to see ASUS' bulls**t response non-apology to this.
It's really depressing and frustrating to see Asus take this path.  I've been using Asus since my Opteron 148 build...that's 20 frickin' years.  Sure, I've had Supermicro and ASRock in server builds during that time, but the last time I used anything other than Asus in my primary, watercooled builds, was during the Pentium III era.  And given the evidence we're seeing, that trust, and that relationship, seems to be over.  I won't dwell on it, but they need to think about whether it's worth losing a generation's worth of trust in their product.
I won't buy Asus anymore no no no nooooooo dont buy
stonks 📉
I bought my wife an Asus G14 laptop last year and it's had non stop wifi connection issues that require restarting to fix.  I tried all all the fixes.  I've chalked it up to Asus is just not that good anymore.
At first I was like "who cares about whether the bios is beta". Then I heard the words "void your warranty". Yea that's bad. Now if I try to fix the problem with your solution I exclude myself from support.
As Rock just needs to start making more white products and off they go...
Kudos on standing up for the consumer. Hopefully other influencers will also drop ASUS until they overhaul their product quality systems and support systems. I also hope consumers get word to just avoid Asus until ASUS gets their act together.
Jay, they don't care because they aren't smart enough to care. The decision makers who think its ok to post a beta bios to their website intended to fix a critical problem they created and tell customers they are voiding their warranty by using it; aren't smart enough to grasp that you've just told a potential 3.88 million people that their company is no longer a trustworthy place to spend thousands of dollars.
ASUS don't care, they have a new baby the ROG Ally.
ASUS is sh*, I have a lot experience, thank you asus, bye-bye. Asrock is NOT better. F em both.
I dont know why so many people are suddenly realising how shady Asus is.. I have had awful experiences with 2 of their products (and warranty servicws) over the last 5 years. On top of that their Armory Crate software is absolutely disgraceful and they should be ashamed of themselves. Vowed to never purchase from them again.
I don't always agree with Jay but the one thing I agree with him is an important point he touched upon in this video: the problem is not really about the language that ASUS used regarding beta BIOS - as Jay said, beta BIOSes have existed for millennia, and they are beta because they haven't been tested as thoroughly as final release.  The important thing is beta BIOSes are often for stuffs that aren't as serious. Regarding the SoC voltage of the current issue, that is very serious stuff. I would expect that to be covered under warranty that is worth any salt.  I don't want beta BIOSes to go away. I don't want the suits in ASUS to say "we ain't doing beta BIOSes from now on". I think beta BIOSes have a place in the world.
Hello there! I have a question - can anyone confirm if the issue with the 7800X3D is caused by ASUS or AMD? I've been using Intel for 20 years but I'm considering switching to AMD and purchasing the 7800X3D. Have there been any reports of similar issues with other brands like Aorus or MSI? If the issue is only with ASUS and not AMD, which brand would you recommend? I'm personally drawn to Aorus because of their board appearance, but I would appreciate any suggestions or guidance. Thank you kindly!
Armoury Crate is a P.O.S. and forcing driver updates through that slow, self promoting bloat is reason enough to avoid Asus. It’s serious junk. On the other hand, my ROG Maximus Extreme Z690, ROG Strix RTX 3090 Ti 24MB WC OC and ROG Thor 1200P is flawless & super stable with a i912900 KS processor and 32 GB Kingston 850 6400 Furry Beast memory.  And it better bloody stay that way. My first and last foray into Asus.
I keep hearing a lot of comments about Asrock being a ‘bad’ brand, but it’s actually founded by former Asus employees. For reference, I’ve been running a Taichi x570 rev 1.0 board since 2019 launch, and it’s been rock solid. Kudos Jay for drawing the line. I also recently dumped all my Asus wireless 6 gear for Ubiquiti/Alien too.
Thank you Jay for sticking your neck out for us consumers!!  I'm glad I caught your video, and Steve's videos when I did. I was just about to pull the trigger on an ASUS Z790 mobo this weekend. I will now go with one of the competing manufacturer's boards. I will always try my best to not support a business when they're doing shady things like this.
Makes me question if the micro stuttering crap I get on my build was due to the MOBO. Who knows.
Come back to us, EVGA. 😭
Are the Am4 boards a problem as well?
Several years ago, I did and upgrade, ASUS MB ... and it had a MUST DO, BIOS UPDATE.   The update fried the MB ... took it back to the store .. got a second MB .. same thing fried MB ...  too kit back 3rd time.  Store tried to blame me!!  So I told them . ." DO THE BIOS UPDATE YOURSELF."  FRIED MB!!  I replaced with a Gigabyte ...  no problem!  I got a phone call about 6 hours later, the store telling me they got a call from ASUS, telling them to NOT use the BIOS update .. it'll fry the MB's.  Hav'nt touched an ASUS MB since!
Here Here!  Well said Jay!
Something happen with their quality control. The Coil Whine Story? My TUF 4090 is so damn loud it should be labeled as sound card. What the heck Asus?
I've had stability problems with my PRIME B650M-A WIFI, swapping out memory, defaulting timings instead of EXPO, flashing new BIOS's, ... suddenly it remained stable and I have no clue why, but I don't dare to touch any settings anymore fearing that it might just f*ck up the system again. Luckily it's not with an X3D, but I know I'm leaving performance on the table and am running a months old BIOS which may very well have the potential voltage risks 🥵  It's been my first Asus board in years and I was like ok I'll just go with the "reliable one" instead of Asrock (reviews weren't out yet) and now I'm getting the same feeling, but am "stuck" with it for another couple of years until I need a new system performance wise😔
Huge respect to you Jay! This is why I enjoy your work, you are always on the consumer's side.
Well I was excited about gathering funds to build in my new tower, but I think I’ll wait now. Glad I bought a 6950XT though. My 3080 in my other build is doing amazing though.
Also get Intel ;)
I haven't bought anything from Asus for 15 years. I had once bought a laptop from Asus it broke down, I had to wait 3 months for a new one. I haven't bought any of their stuff since then
I have Asus since 16 years, not a single issue, currently have a Rog Strix z60-A gaming Wifi (DDR5) not a single issue? lucky? it must be AMD im sorry
If it was a 3rd party bios, I could understand it. Anything for your product(s) that you get from their website shouldn't ever void a warranty. Shit move ASUS.
Has anyone heard if EVGA will be releasing any latest AMD Ryzen motherboards?
I just finally pulled the trigger on a Tuf 4090 and the vram is gimped. Or at least one of them. I can get 900+ max. Asus would never take it back but lucky I got it from Amazon and they will. I had a lot of issues with my Maximus Extreme XII a few years back as well. Nvidia has 4090’s available straight from them so maybe I’ll go that route. Best Buy is out of stock here.
I have a b450 board with a 2700x that absolutely refuses to play nice with my SSL 2+ DAC.. have been trying to get it right for over a year. Will never buy another asus board.
Back in 2017, I got an Asus ROG laptop to run CAD software for school; it is solid as a rock and is honestly still going strong today. When I went to build myself my first custom tower, I went with an Asus B650 motherboard because of my prior good experience with Asus products. Let me tell you, I did not have a good experience with their product this time around. The board I received was evidently defective upon arrival because the m.2 standoff sheared off the board with me just screwing it on (which they then proceeded to immediately deny my RMA for "user-induced damage") due to what I guess is faulty soldering. Furthermore, after completing the build, my system had such extreme memory instability that it frequently would not boot, or stay on for at most 15 minutes before entering a fit of BSODs (diagnosing this was extremely tricky because Asus also cheaped out and didn't include any form of debug LED on the board). In the end, I ended up swapping it out for an AsRock motherboard and my system has been stable and functional ever since. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with Asus now, I company I used to respect, and because of this experience I decided to swear off of any other Asus product in the future. It's comforting to see that I'm not alone in this experience and not being extreme in deciding to not do business with them going forward. Thanks for being a beacon of honesty and responsibility in the face of Asus's behavior, Jay, it means a lot to the little guys like us!
Also have weird issues with my asus amd build sometimes doesn't post, random blue screens, programs not working or taking forever to load even though they are on a 7000mbps m.2. Nearly everything I load on that pc I can load faster on my old i7 5960x and sata ssd build
FYI Jay, Audacity also has bean very buggy as of late. On another note, they screwed me over with customer no service on a router too.
Well it is sad that a period of time on the throne will make Anyone much worse than what they were initially.  It happened to Intel and still happening with NVIDIA and ASUS.  In the end what we need as a consumers is a constant competition between manufacturers, so that they will try to become better overall to win.
I never purchase products that said for gamers as it's a joke.
I'm doing a Mega Man build as well. Just the case but, I got some cool weird fans that might junk. I hope to see it!
Yeah, my next system will be made without Asus parts. I have three Asus laptops which I'll get rid of over the next year as I can find suitable replacements for. I'll hang onto my Flow Z13 as there is no real machine like it other than a Surface which don't have dedicated GPUs.
It is Time for Asus prohibition
Yeah, I have an Asus board (PRIME Z790) and GPU (4090 TUF)..... Random crashes to desktop for games (XMP Profile issues - fixed now), Restarting PC would result in black screens (Hit reset button to fix), a couple of random blue screens and the Armory Create Software is massively bloated and kill's VR Gaming (Stutter - Uninstalled).
Seems like the issues became more common since AM5 came on for ASUS.  I have a Ryzen 9 5900x running on an ASUS B550 board and ASUS 6700XT, no problems whatsoever.
I cannot believe ASUS is doing this to people.  I've not really used their products before, been an MSI, or Gigabyte fan for a while now, just seems bad because I never had a negative opinion of ASUS before.
It's really unfortunate isn't it.. I'm rocking Asus for my still current, first personal build.. first gen Ryzen B350F board.. steady as a rock and ticking over nicely. It saddens me that they can slip like this. They have an opportunity to accept a fork in the road and change their ways. ALL companies have an opportunity to accept a fork in the road and change their ways.
Well..Asus needs to care because I've been a fan for years and I'm done buying their boards as of today and I will pass the word around. Hope you're listening ASUS! Good riddance!!
two company's i wont use is asus and asrock
This has got to break some kind of consumer law, trade, BBB filing...
My ASUS + 7800X3D build is sitting on my kitchen table until this whole thing blows over. I'm glad you're putting your money where your mouth is. Hopefully they come around soon.
I fired asus for this build. So I’m good for 15 years. Jay said Asus RMA! Lol he knows!   Asus has been sending customers back bad products for 20 years! Both customers and businesses. Personally I have gotten bad products and the company I worked for at the time. Channel partners have been aware of it forever. Asus has no insensitive to change. Just boycott them.  I avoided Asus this build because literally every other manufacturer has a better VRM than Asus on the current gen.
Releasing a beta build and saying it may be a fix and then turn round and say "by the way this voids your warranty" sounds HIGHLY illegal IMO
well... that was unequivocal.  side note: I've been using ASUS products for at least 20 years and haven't seen an issue directly related to them in any of my builds. I only just started to play with OC settings recently and found that the performance gains were reasonable, despite unning a few degrees higher (AIO). thanks for the heads up, not sure if ASUS will pull its head out of its ass in time for my next build.
I have a maximus z790 hero and have been having a bunch of ram issues. I was so certain it was the ram, until now.
Good thing I watched this video.   Thank for the information.
I haven't been sold on ASUS for years. I always feel like they're over exaggerated products. I've been using ASRock and honestly, I never hear anything bad about ASRock. Maybe there's a reason why...  BTW, Jay, ASRock has the Taichi Carerra which is white.  ASRock is a damn good company.
I have used ASRock boards since 2019 in multiple builds and never faced an issue. Also, In my opinion their BIOS is user friendly compared to other brands.
WTF I didn't even know about the capacitor thing AND MY SHIT IS BACKWARDS, I bought 3 MB's and 2 were Z790's 1 (the first) which cause all the issues was the z690 and upon my entire system failing they still refused to replace it and I had no idea that the is what could have been the thing causing issues. I am so pissed. I sat there for weeks just smelling the burning plastic who knows what that did to me. I am seriously fuming. I have a true debilitating phobia of chemicals as it is due to my time in the navy and the extremely dangerous amount of chemicals I was around with cheap, poor and sometimes no PPE, I have PTSD based off of that alone and to go through this I am truly done. My dad was saying no dude your fine its just dust, you think these manufacturers would put you in harms way like that?? Im pissed.
Makes me want to change my MOBO.  I have x570 Asus.  Great video!
man, I've been with Asus for quite a while. mobos, zenfones, monitors, etc. but I knew I had to move on from most of those, and now it's time for me to move on from the mobo.  I hope you guys will be able to upload a video of the top brands to buy mobos from for the 800 series!
I'll stop by  Asus a long time ago. They're overpriced for what you get and frankly MSI does a better job
I’ve had some odd issues with my recent Asus ProArt Motherboard with an AMD Ryzen™ 9 7950X CPU build, but lately, it has been stable after reflashing the BIOS and one update BIOS flashing. Now I’m not sure if I want to go with an Asus-branded Nvidia 4000 series GPU
I havent been watching Steve's videos very much in a while, maybe I should.  If this is as bad as you say, this is extremely horrible for a top brand.  I have an x470 F gaming and it's an awesome board, I might go back to MSI or try ASROCK in my next build because Ive been hearing good things about them over the last few years.  They send you bad/ wrong parts because they aren't paying enough attention to their own processes, of course they don't care.  Maybe videos like this will give your viewers, as well as any tech youtuber, the awareness of what's going on and maybe the drop in market share will hopefully someday wake them up and realize they need a serious overhaul somewhere in their organization.
ASRock was originally spun off from Asus in 2002 in order to compete with companies like Foxconn for the commodity OEM market. Since then, ASRock has also gained momentum in the DIY sector and plans for moving the company upstream began in 2007 following a successful IPO on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.[3] It was acquired by Pegatron in 2010.[4]  As of 2011, ASRock is the world's third largest motherboard manufacturer,[5] having cooperated with professional esports player Johnathan Wendel in the development of a gaming-oriented enthusiast motherboard in 2011.[citation needed]  ASRock established itself as a server motherboard affiliate in April 2013, having received orders from 10 mid-size clients for server and industrial PC motherboards and forming partnerships with system integrators.[6]
I'm so disappointed... i have way too many of their products, and I was about to buy the new hand held even though i have a steam deck that i was going to give to a family member. My wife even has a 2022 g14 laptop. I've probably spent somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 to 15k in the past two years on ASUS products. They better get their s*** together, or they're going to lose a valuable customer. Beyond unacceptable behavior and then the motherboards being damaged and sending them to an influencer. Wow, icing on the cake. If they're sending board like that to an influencer hell yeah it's happening a regular people.
Am I safe with my  ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS  I know very little of what's going on.
So are users experiencing these cpu burnout problems ONLY when utilizing the EXPO profile or the regular out of box stock settings or both?
They're too busy buddying up to Microsoft with the ROG Ally. Not enough profit in components, stick with systems.
The flashback feature gives me confidence to update the bios every time a new version comes out but once I saw this one was beta I refused to risk my $1600AUD motherboard.
Good video covering a cumulative list of problems leading to the conclusion "Their QA and customer support are no longer sufficiently reliable to want to do business with them." We depend on folks like you Jay, who have much more interaction with a specific company or brand, to help us be informed by your experience of changes in a company's reliability. Thanks for the video.
I got a asus mobo when I got my first computer back in 2020. Its strange because certain stuff thats happening now, with these boards makes me wonder if its been happening with mine. I'm running i7 9700f and when I first got it, it ran insanely hot. So I got myself a AIO which now keeps the temps at 56. I was still having thermo throttling happening though, which was causing all sorts of issues, which I found, was due to the vrms, on the board not having heat sinks on them
OMG, this makes me really glad I decided against the X3D and opted for the i7-13700K for my new SFF PC that I'm building.
My maaaan 😂
Oh look more asus bs.  Remember the Z7S-WS garbage?
lol wtf asus. what genius in their company said, hey lets release a POTENTIAL fix, but its a BETA and it will VOID the customers warranty. oh and if they dont download it, their cpu will blow up anynways. GGs
If i am AsRock, i would make a custom all black X670E motheboard and give it to Jay for his custom build. ASAP.
Purchased the MATX Gene motherboard with a 7800x3d, was already gobsmacked that such a high tier expensive board only had a single speed controllable chassis fan header! The rest are all forced 100% speed, ie. absolutely USELESS - you shouldn't have to micro-analyze a board specs with a fine tooth comb before buying to know that whether it has more THAN ONE speed controllable chassis fan header)..   But the beta bios rubbish, and still weeks later having no actual reassurance from them as to whether the problem has truly been fixed and the board isn't going to melt both itself and the cpu is utterly ridiculous.   Would not surprise me if there is some kind of coverup going on for major hardware design fault on Asus boards that can't just be fixed by a bios update, as admitting fault would either end with them having to mass recall, or risk facing a class action suit.
This type of thing does damage a brand and hit their bottom line, I've just upgraded and moved away from an ASUS motherboard for the first time in over 10 years. One less board sale will not hurt them, but how many other people are doing what I've just done?
Here I am hanging with my 8yr old Gigabyte Ultra-Durable, still going strong with no issues.  I always considered ASUS to be more expensive for the same thing I've always found from Gigabyte for way less cost motherboard wise. And their Japanese caps never give up, even in high heat for years.
I have hade a bad RMA experience with Corsair and now ASUS seems like they don't know how to run a company / take care of their customers. And now we hear this from ASUS 😉 Just as Jay says, both company have created some cool products, but warranties and customer care are two big things for me.
Is that a trueforce megaman X in the background?
Jay, what were those purple/pinkish lights in your home office at the back? Looked sick!
Poor rog ally gonna grow up an orphan
last experience i had with asus customer support was over a x99 board and it's m.2 slot. Needless to say the next board i bought was a ASROCK board, my current rig has a Gigabyte board, and i built two other machines with MSI boards. This just confirms my experiences as well.
Try a gigabyte aorus master jay you can't go wrong with it
Good to know, I own a RoG z690-E gaming wifi board with about 2 grand worth of parts, not counting the board being 500 dollars MSRP at best buy. My original z690-A had the same damaged pins problem, thinking back on it now I probably should of gone with MSI instead.
Has jay talked about the msi hack? if he's going msi now might be a notable subject.
I've had an Asus gaming laptop, since i got it, it was always ridden with problems, and whenever I went to service centre they would say " it's working, it's fine " i took the laptop again and again but they never fixed it's issues. I was so fed up with the service. Just after my warranty ended my laptop's mobo died. And they said that we will charge 70% percent of the laptop's cost to replace the mobo. The whole experience was so shitty, i always felt like I owed them something whereas their shitty product was riddled with issues from the factory. I don't recommend this trash brand to anyone. My friend had bought she faced the sam issues but her laptop didn't even survive few months, it just bricked. And they didn't fix it or have any replacement. Stay away from Asus it has the worst service and products.
Well done guys. For the people. Massive respect. God I’m gutted. Only ever used asus boards. No longer will that happen.  It’s becoming a bit of a list now of shitty pc companies. Asus  nvidia
You know, also my Ryzen 3600 has kinda high voltages with ASUS B450 Tuf Gaming Plus. Stock
Thank you and all the other people leaving comments on this video. It's good to see these horror stories about ASUS customer service come out.  My motherboard is old enough (8th/9th gen Intel) to predate ASUS's apparent decline in engineering & QC standards. It's never had any issues, so I was fully ready to go ASUS again for my next build (whenever that is). Bullet dodged.
BOYCOTT ASUS!
I bought an ASUS laptop in 2017. 4 months later, the WiFi was dead. Call in to RMA, and the rep straight-up insults me, saying I'm an idiot who just can't log into a WiFi network. Spoiler, the motherboard had failed and was replaced.  When I get the laptop back, they've messed up the screen so that tge bottom-left corner has this weird spot where it looks as it someone's mashing their finger into the screen. Two months later, the WiFi's dead again.  I returned it for a refund and never bought or recommended an ASUS product since.
so far im happy with my x370 asus crosshair board. runs my 5900x "fine" even with the first gen ryzen stuff asus has slight problems. like software crashing, fan software just getting stuck at low speed or getting lag spikes or long shutdown times because : How DARE you run hwmon.. yea.. when i finaly upgrade to am5, ill not get asus. just not worth it to risk a cpu/ram/ssd on that brand
can confirm similar problem with my asus am5 board 4x usb slots not working correctly like lot of other guys mentioned in forums. Send it in RMA bougth a new one with same problem lol not sure if bios updates can fix this
My 5900X + ASUS X570 Dark hero has major USB issues ever since i plugged in my GoPro in charge mode. I've had ASUS+intel since Core 2 duo. Safe to say, as much as it hurts, my next system will be intel+MSI/ASrock...
After being a rog fan boy and never having issues this concerns me :( there quality was just something else, really hope they lift their game.
This both made me feel better about how many hoops I had to go through getting my Gigabyte AMD build working (they eventually did fix the BIOS) and made me immediately change my mind on the Proart board I was about to buy!
This sucks... ASUS and MSI are my go-to brands for quality. I guess it's only one now...
It's a shame. I had a barebones AMD Piledriver mobo from Asus that was a real workhorse and was super solid. Enough to pseudo-inspire a pick for an ASUS board on my new build I just did this past April for the first time in like eight years.  And then this happens, and one of my boards is the one of the ones at risk. What a way to fall all at once in my esteem. I was never very confident in any mobo brand, but now ASUS is at the bottom of the pile.
big props jay
MSI is just as crappy as ASUS and a lot of others when all is ok then no problems but when somting is wrong like doa's then goodluck getting a good one. Even shops not only webshops nut also real shops have trouble getting it fixed. It's so frustrating :(
Holy smokes the BIOS warranty stuff is shady at least. I feel sad since I liked the Asus Strix parts.
I remember others saying Asus is the way to go, think it was 2018 when I ordered a pre-built for my dad when I just started out learning about PC's and needed one so he wouldn't be bored 😂 and picked a Asus board, the motherboard was dead after 3 years, initially thought it was the PSU so I bought another one. Good thing I had another mobo to identify to issue.  Still new to PC building, so I wasn't expecting the mobo when nothing happened just a basic system.  Glad to know to avoid Asus boards for now. And that I a MSI Mobo.
Asus motherboard, Asus graphics card, Intel CPU, Nvidia GPU, Corsair RAM and PSU was my ultimate PC building combo since 20 years. Seems I will need to see elsewhere for my new rig in 2024. Shame on you Asus.
An average gamer does not need anything beyond a $150 MoBo !!
Ooohh! So that’s what Asrock means, thanks Jay
I just purchased a Strix X670E-E gaming wifi board this week with a Ryzen 7 7700. Haven't even started the build yet. Not feelin' too good now...
I was going back and forth between ASUS (IO), GIGABYTE (BIOS) and MSI (overall build quality) and ended up choosing MSI. Boi, dodge a bullet on that one. I hate ASROCK because I contacted them and they being coy about their warranty. Updating warranty by myself OR by retailer will void warranty unless ASROCK the one that update them (aka. it came out of the factory updated). Mind you that warranty void status or law is different from region to region.
My first Asus board was the x570-E Strix. 3900x cpu and 16GB kit. I had so much instability with windows saying it was cpu and memory errors. I changed the CPU and only had memory errors left. I changed the memory out for some I had lying around at home, still had instability... Pulled everything apart and warrantied the board. Refused the return as it had bent pins, hair and some sort of glue around the socket. I got the same board back with the pins straightened but the glue and hair remained. Had to buy a cheap gigabyte board to get my system running again for work, no issues the past year. Won't be going back to Asus. Asrock will be the next I think, built two systems in the past year using Asrock boards for other people and I was pleasantly surprised with the whole experience - and they've been flawless.
You can tell its a very upsetting video for Jay if he didn't put the fart sound at the end of the video.
As part of troubleshooting a failure of my recenlty purchased ASUS ZenWiFi AX6600 to connect properly, ASUS service support as one step to recieve escalated support asked me to send them a screenshot of the VLAN tagging control in their router software when I contacted them to ask where/if VLAN tagging controls existed, since I wasn't able to locate it on any of the screens I thought it might make sense to put it on.  If I knew where it was to take the screenshot, would I be asking where to find it?  That's the point where I concluded they were just completely wasting my time and not actually trying to solve anything.
Excellent decision, Jay, you are really really honest, fair and loyal to your subscribers, i real appreciate, well done, 10/10
I like this
I haven't had any problems with my ASRock mb yet 😅
Jay I’m curious. I just bought a full new pc upgrade, Rog strix b650e-f, ryzen 7800x3d and team group 64gb 6000mtu ram is there any advice you can give me? Kinda worried that when it all shows up Tuesday I’m gunna kill something because of the x3d issue :( any advice at all would be super appreciated.
That was rewarding to watch
I have the asus x670e-f. 5600mhz kingston ram and a 7700x and cannot run expo without the system crash during coldboot sometimes. then i get error during post press F1. settings are not changed. and its still expo. i continue to boot. ram runs on stock speed, but with same voltages. HUH?!  i even made sure its QVL Ram. :(  my previous board was a Asrock x570 Steellegend and it ran the whole Am4 generation like a charm without any issues.  i guess i'm going to pick Asrock or gigabyte for my next build.
Considering the ROG Ally is up for sale now, this doesn't fill me with confidence. There are way more moving parts on a handheld. I'm not sure if I trust Asus to stand behind the product.
Is this affecting Intel platforms too?   I’m scared since I recently build my first system using ASUS mobo and now im scared
True story. I had a buggy ASUS ProArt B550-CREATOR motherboard that eventually failed. They wanted me to pay $299 to RMA it because the GPU clip was broken. Just a little plastic piece unrelated to the rest of the board's problem. That's the same price as buying a new one. I had to buy a whole new board. And I did. And that one had all the same bugs. And then after about 8 months that one died too. No troubleshooting lights or beep codes or anything. Just cold dead silence. Warranty was void because I purchased it outside the U.S. So that's over $600 I spent on basically just art to hang on my wall. "PROART"  I went back to using my MSI MAG B550M Mortar and I haven't had any of those bugs ever since. No boot loops. No system freezes. Just smooth sailing. Don't use ASUS motherboards!
@ASUS  warranty policy = "Fk around and find out!"  Company motto is Leeroy Jenkinnnnnnns!
I don't buy MSI or Asus motherboards or laptops.  I buy Asrock, Gigabyte so far.  I had a dead x570 board from MSI.  I submitted an RMA and got declined even though it was less than 10 days of purchase and had reciept to show.  Then when I took it to Reddit I got my RMA approved.  I had to buy another motherboard which was a Gigabyte motherboard.  To replace and make sure my other parts weren't the issue.  All worked fine.  I sent in a pissed off mood the MSI board inside of the gigabyte box.  MSI Sent the board back to me stating it was "fixed".  A few months later a relative was building a computer for his bro.  I gave them the spare MSI board I had.  It was dead.  Did not power on.  I purchased an Asrock board and sent it their way and worked ever since.  Gigabyte and Asrock push out motherboard updates more than MSI.  MSI does not keep up the pace and drops about 3 or 4 updates within a year and calls it a day.  Gigabyte and Asrock after years still push out updates to their products.  Bought a MSI Laptop years ago.  To upgrade RAM, HDD or even battery I had to break the "Warranty Void" Sticker on the last screwhole to work on my hardware.  Acer on the other hand says go on an open the laptop and upgrade if you wish to.
Or don't buy a AMD- you're fired AMD
Do you guys even play games anymore ? Or just fuss about hardware?  ***closes benchmarks*** ***closes forums*** ***opens solitaire*** sure I game ! ***hides multiple gpu boxes*** I said I game !
Bummer Asus took a crap.. I prefer their bios over all the other ones, that is the main reason I use asus on most of my builds.  My 7950x on an asus hero has been rock solid thanksfully, I have a new build with a 7950x3d on a strix x670 board and no issues so far but it's a brand new build and have not had much time with it yet.
Thank you Jay. ASUS is dead to me.
Thanks for this! I was upgrading my PC and I was considering asus for my motherboard. Because of this video I'll just consider other brands.
13:35 The additional Problems you create yourself when you try to make your PC interior "stylish". Im quite thankful i dont have any sense for style - "crap works" is enough for me :)
Now I know why my Asus Rog Strix B550-F Gaming Board bricked from one day to the other, without me doing anything. I had to RMA the Board, but they said it was all my fault without saying what I had done wrong. Also because of the "this was my fault" thing they denied my warranty, this is by the way illegal in the EU and special in Germany. We have laws against this BS that they tried. If a product does not work within the first 2 years I can always return it, but must prove that the defect was also there when it was manufactured. Within the first year, that I was in with my board, than the manufacture must prove that the customer damaged something. Most of the time they can't and provide a new product  Long story short, I filed a payback from Paypal, got my money back and bought a different board. FCK Asus!
Wow I have always used ASUS boards. Gonna switch after this debacle 😢
I realized the quality control of asus after buying a $2200 laptop from them. It has grounding issues on USB ports after being RMAd for other issues. The software support is horrible and I will not buy another one or ever recommend them.
A$U$
Thats why uou watch Linus he knows his stuffs these dummy dont know anything.  Haha
Yep, can vouch for the Asrock X670E... I own the X670E Carrara (Taichi variant) and it's been working flawlessly with my 7950X for 7 months now :D AM5 boards from ASRock are actually some of the best out there! You should definitely switch to the the Taichi for your main rig.
Great decision! Gigabyte with their PSU issues, now ASUS after their motherboard issues are on my blacklist too. Never buy from these shitty companies again.
I have a Asus Strix motherboard, 7900X,  and DDR5. I’ve been waiting day after day for the BIOS update to take my startup time from 120 seconds to 15 seconds which is what MY 5900X and DDR4 setup did!!!! Does anybody else have a fix for that BS, is it Asus that’s dragging their feet because other manufacturers has fixed that ram timing cycling issue, or are we just screwed with startup time with the DDR5!?
My original 2070super bricked for no reason, RMA'ed it and i think they simply flashed the bios to a 2080 bios and sent it back, all it said on the paper was something about the BIOS (im not very tech savy sorry and i cant find the paperwork). It wont hold ANY OC and my original 2070s had higher FPS at stock settings by a good 20ish FPS in games like siege. So ive been stuck with a lower end\higher end GPU since last year and theres no chance i can afford even an ACTUAL 2080 right now let alone any actual upgrade :/ And now asus is apperently no longer user friendly and i just upgraded to x570 last year also lol i know i know but i dont need anything past a R7 5800 which is what i plan on upgrading to eventually from an R5 so i didnt see a need to jump to current gen mobos nor could i afford the DDR5 RAM upgrade either lol
Sad I've been using ASUS for 20 years. Mobos are more expensive than ever and failing hard like this is unacceptable.
Jay, I walked away from ASUS back in the Athlon 900 days for customer service issues. Been through _two_ MSI boards (790FX-GD70) that patently refused to run my Sapphire RX580 Nitro+ (blue model) at PCIe x16 - I could only ever get them to run at x8. MSI blamed it on me. and when I finally upgraded to an R7 2700x platform, the long derided ASROCK Taichi x470 had the best reviews and exactly the feature set I wanted.   Yes, I've RMA'd the Taichi board, but I also RMAd the Corsair Vengeance RAM and the original Ryzen R7 2700 (non-x) because of what turned out to be a failure of the memory controller on the CPU. _ALL THREE_ brands were happy to work with me and AMD even replaced my R7 2700 with an R7 2700x _under warranty_ two months after the warranty expired because I could show an 18 month long  chain of events trying to diagnose the problem.  So yeah, while ASRock may have began life as a "budget ASUS", their customer service is far better than their parent company. Yeah, ASRock may not have all the bells and whistles that ASUS does and may have lower-tier specs compared to other brands, but the fact of the matter is that _their products work exactly as advertised._ and do so at a lower price point.   My current system is an ASRock Taichi x470, R7 2700x, 32G Corsair Vengeance RAM at 2900 (mismatched pairs, so it's my own damn fault they can't go faster), Sapphire RX580 Nitro+ SE. I get 60-90 FPS in CP2077 with custom 'low' settings, 65-100+ in Scum, and similar in Elite: Dangerous and No Mans Sky. I'm very happy with the system.
Overpriced but under-engineered 😂
Wow. I don’t think I’ve ever heard Jay be that upset with a manufacturer. Well done for saying it straight
Good job ASUS screw gamer nexus and jayz2pennys fanboys and all scumbags who are watching and supporting their channels. Once again GOOD JOB ASUS !
This is. . . actually sad. Also, I feel awkward typing this using one of their Falchion keyboards. I mean sure, their peripherals are fine and this is for their PC components, but still. . . God damn, ASUS really has fallen.
I bought a very expensive pc not even 6 months ago. It has an asus rog strix 790 e wifi gaming motherboard. Yesterday I had to send the pc away to repair, because the motherboard is broken. Seems like at least the RAM slots don't work anymore, as the pc was constantly crashing out of games, when I switched ram, I didn't even get a picture anymore. This is a 700 bucks motherboard.
I've also experienced their bad backend support. I sent in my laptop for a faulty hinge replacement which I paid for during the warranty period (I agreed as it was my fault, for dropping the laptop). But the tech broke the other hinge during my collection when demonstrating the service was completed. When I finally collected my laptop, they charged me for two hinges repairs. Literally had an argument with the manager at the Service Centre for half an hour before having the charge reversed.  I'm glad I had switched from ASUS to AsRock for my motherboard use. Their recent move is a totally unfair practice.
shots fired!
Huge respect for this
👏 Well done Jay
so, wasnt any previous beta bios exactly like that?
Do i think ASUS deserves a chance? i dont think so..they didnt fix their mistakes and even tried to bribe people. When given a chance, they give u a BIOS update that voids your warranty, nice. Their support takes ages too.
The music annoys me. Just loud enough to be heard, but not loud enough to be enjoyed.
Boycott Asus
Oh no! My free stuff has scratches! Spoiled baby.
Wow. I wish this kind of crap had been known when I bought the Crosshair VIII Hero. It killed my 3950x and ASUS was garbage about getting it fixed. I ended up buying a MSI board and a 5950x. No problems since. I've bought several MSI boards over the past twenty years and never had a problem. They lasted forever. To date, I have only purchased a total of TWO ASUS boards and both have been garbage. I will NEVER buy another ASUS product again.
I've had Asus boards for literally a decade. I just built a new system for my friend using an Asus B650E motherboard and 7800X3D, and now I'm seriously worried I've just given them a pile of crap. I picked Asus because of my previous experience with them...  I had them update to the last non-beta bios prior to Asus removing it, one that it said on their page fixed the voltage issues (guess not), and I also had them restore bios defaults (so no EXPO). It's still heads and tails faster than what they upgraded from, but now I don't trust that their board won't fail on them later on. I've built many systems for friends and they literally last a decade or more. My kids are using a computer that I built for my brother a decade ago that he gave back to me for them when I built his last upgrade. All Asus motherboards. Ugh, thanks Asus. This sucks.
Dang ASUS was my go to.  Got their monitors too!
I'm very frustrated with asus for a different reason. My issue was that EXPO would never work when applied, through 2 different CPUs and 3 different memory kits on a particular board, and there was a terrible coil whine. I sent it to them for an RMA, paying $25 to ship it out, just to have them send it back and say they couldn't replicate the issue. Completely blew me off after that and ignored when I complained that the issue persisted, only offering to do another $25 RMA. I don't have words for how mad I was, and still am, after that experience.
Oh no I just built a system with an asus prime x670e and an r9 7950x… am I safe?
I've run Asus stuff for a looong time, never a problem till the last couple of years.  My 3090 ran hotter than hell, reworked the cooler and it was fine.  Support was worthless.  Bought a new ROG laptop and it has tons of issues, support is beyond worthless.  Was going to give them a 3rd strike, but you just sealed the deal for me.  Won't be buying their stuff anymore.
I recently switched to MSI because my last two ASUS mobos gave me trouble.
It really sucks because I used to recommend ASUS to my gaming customers in the late 90's to early 2000's. They had some solid gaming hardware. I'm glad I got MSI when I upgraded last year. Although my video card is an ASUS, but no problems there.
Is this a issue only related to ASUS?  Been an ASUS fanboy since forever!
Jay, I have been very happy with my X670e Tiachi board with AM5.  I have played around with 3 CPUs and all have run great.  I can run tight timings on CL30 / 6000 30-38-38-30 ram.  I have not been a fan of Asrock in the past, but this thing has been great.  I was glad to hear you had the same results from yours.
It took the world a long time to catch up! I got burned back when they cut up the RX 560 chips, and then still sold them as RX 560 GAMING GPU's under the same SKU!!!! But it was us lonely low level pos gamers, so we didn't count, we don't have a voice to you!!! Funny how now the RTX 3060 is one of the most popular GPU's on the market, if the RX 560 was just coming out, you would have backed us up!!  well, now you get burned by them too!  The only difference, I'm not hurt, because I wrote off ASUS LONG ago!!!  P.S. Yes, I complained about ASUS ROG and the RX 560 a lot! def ears everywhere!!
Just loved it
I am so happy that I choose MSI for my current mb. I originally wanted ASUS because my last rig has an ASUS mb and I has ran reliably for the last 5 years. Chose MSI because it was cheaper than ANY ASUS options.
Regrettably, I experienced the same issues as Jay did. Towards the end of 2021, I purchased an ASUS ROG STRIX Z590-E motherboard, only to discover that one of the m.2 slots was defective. I recorded a video of the setup to demonstrate the issue and requested a replacement for the brand new motherboard I had purchased. However, I was only offered a refurbished motherboard, which I reluctantly accepted.  I went through the RMA process and was assured that I would receive a replacement motherboard, which was eventually shipped to me. However, after several weeks had passed without receiving the replacement, I reached out to support once more. To my surprise, they claimed that the CPU pin was bent and that I was not entitled to a refund. I was baffled by this response, as I had only requested a replacement for the faulty m.2 slot, not a refund.  I had to engage in a lengthy exchange of messages, providing chat records, videos, and images as evidence to support my case. Eventually, ASUS acknowledged their mistake and provided me with a refurbished motherboard as a replacement. However, I did not receive any compensation for the trouble that I had gone through, despite paying top dollar for a new motherboard and ending up with a refurbished product.
I have loved ASUS since my first ROG Laptop.  I bought two laptops, three monitors, two GPUs and one motherboard over about 12 years.  However, every one of those products died in some way within a year.  The screen died on the first laptop, GPU on the second, motherboard failed next killing an entire system with it, first monitor tinted green permanently with everything except xbox one oddly enough, second monitor black screened, and most recently the TUF curved black screened within about 4 months.    I always assumed it was me up and until the TUF monitor when it occurred to me that all my ASUS stuff went the same way.  Then I realized, I've been building PCs for two decades and I've never had ANY other component break or fail on me.    I have just whitelisted ASUS in my head because I loved the brand and always heard good things about them, but finally realized their stuff just did not last.  I was going to get the ROG phone and was excited about the Ally, but it's impossible to overlook that track record.  I really just thought it was just me being really unfortunate.
i have ana sus motherboard and the usb 3.2 dont work (they are super slow) but i couldn´t send it back because my 3080 ti got stuck on the motherboard after i discovered the malfunction u.u
Its not asus...its called anus
But Asrock is Asus as well.
I've been through 8, EIGHT, asus rog x570 crosshair viii formula boards to find two that work, kinda, with random lockups, despite all the hardware components working just fine on a ASRock board. And it  can't be drivers  - leave it in the BIOS for a week and at some point, it'll lock up. Of the 8, three were RMA's from ASUS. They've become a joke, I gave up, will NEVER buy ASUS anything again (and their shipping packaging on the RMA boards was a bad joke too!)
the tuf x570 i have now is the last asus mobo i will have bought it seems...
Outdated info
Built my first ever pc not even a month ago glad the asus board I was gonna get was out of stock it seems I've avoided a lot of the recent headaches
so no problem DONT BUY ANY ASUS products. problem solved
I have 3 ASUS MB's 2 z790's that are malfunctioning, it won't read my GPU, 2 shops have told me the same thing that the motherboard is faulty they have said they replaced every part through process of elimination and when replacing the MB it is fixed, yet ASUS accepts the RMA and send them back broken saying nothing is wrong with them. I am not wealthy whatsoever and hope to be by using this somewhat premium hardware and they just won't do a thing about it.
asus technical ko'd once again. what happened to the "rock solid, heart touching" ????????? asus what happened to you ??!
I wonder why people keep putting ASUS on the throne thinking that they are the bees knees when they are just overhyped and overpriced garbage. I've been stuck with a X470 CH7H that is just a buggy mess and structuraly weak. Just get something from brands like ASRock and tell ASUS to suck a big jonh.
I solved these hardware/usb issues when i lowered the mounting pressure on the cpu  Also, thank you for looking out for us… unfortunately i just bought the GENE like a month ago
yeah asus kind of sucks nowadays... i've recently used they gpu tweak software and it's been crashing my pc when i load up games... uninstalling that and using afterburner made my pc stable again... guess i will never buy asus products again
I was thinking of going with an Asus motherboard again, since my last computer (now server) has been really good so far (X370 Prime), but now I'm probably going with Asrock.
I used to recommend Asus as well for years but I agree with Jayz they're going through a mine filed the seeded themself. Even their non motherboard hardware is breaking for no reason. I had one of their true 5.1 surround headphone the wire was breaking in the same way on 2 of the same headphones. WTF Asus!
I was going to buy a tuf board when this stuff blew up, phew decided to go with gigabyte instead.
I am almost in relief that I am not the only one that has encountered weird blue screens with Ryzen 7th gen on an X670 Asus board, bought at the worst time it seams.
it's very interesting because my rog strix G17 is having some internal issues. I bought and refunded the same product 3 times. The last time I opt for the rtx 3060 laptop and it is still having issues such as dramatic and consistent lag spikes, game and application freezes. Now, thank God best buy has a great return policy so I returned it several times thinking I just got a bad apple but fast forward the issue still persists. I had to buy a ethernet extension and for the game and application freezes I am left speechless 🙊. I wrote my comment because this seems to be more than a coincidence and likely I am suspicious they cut corners for this laptop too
looks like I'm going to boycott ASUS for my next build when I go to upgrade. I'm still rocking AM4 5900X with an ASUS ROG MB. So when I upgrade there will be no ASUS.
since my last AMD board (AM4+) broke 1 month after the warranty, I switched to Gigabyte and I have to say: I have no regrets xD
I am glad I use MSI. They never disappointed me.
Cool video, I'll stop buying Asus hardware from today
Well feck, ASUS was the company I was going to migrate too insofar for GPUs now that EVGA left that market.  Any suggestions on the nVidia side of things for AIB manufacturers then?
More money for shittier products and services! Boy! I sure do love the times we are living in!
You're fired! Clean out your locker at the club.
Okay, this makes me curious about my asus motherboard and how it fried itself.
Thank you for 100% solidifying my choice to go with an Asrock z790 board, I haven’t felt comfortable buying Asus stuff for a while, so I’m definitely just going to stay away from all of their products.
What's worse is the issue also make amd look bad on top of there own issue
Perfect timing with their new Steam Deck alternative. Their customer service has been terrible for years with turnaround time and overall support. Thank you for your views. Their RMA service is and has been for a while, terrible. And to release a public BIOS as a "BETA" that voids the warranty.... this is just asking for a class action.
Never had any issues with ASUS.
I feel like the reason they released these untested BIOS, is so 1. They can claim they did something and 2. So that they end up saving a ton of money in the end as they'll no longer have to RMA anything nuked from this problem
I can't remember what motherboard my first PC had, I only remember that American Megatrends screen and then the Windows 98 boot. But the first motherboard I remember using was an ASUS. A P5KPL-AM EPU, that symphony of colors. Never failed once. Last year I took my spare parts and built a secondary PC with Windows XP specifically for old games. Guess what's housing it? That exact P5KPL board. A little over 15 years later, it still runs like new. I didn't expect it to last that long, just like I didn't expect ASUS to sink so low when it comes to quality of both products and services.  Right now I have a Gigabyte Gaming X and I had actually planned to switch to a Z690 from ASUS because of the darker color and the great past experience with ASUS. Thanks for literally saving my money, Jay.
Thank you for the information about asus I’m about to start a new pc build I was debating to get a asus motherboard I heard they were having problems but for now I’ll use another motherboard until they get act together I won’t buy asus motherboard again
I used to buy nothing but ASUS boards many years ago.  Then I tried an ASRock board and had a solid experience with it and used those since that point.  Cheaper and from where I'm sitting has worked just as well.
I understand the reasons for you getting rid of asus as a sponsor. but if you avoided every company who does something sleezy.  then nobody would buy anything at all.  I mean Gigabyte has a checkered past with the exploding power supplies and putting up a stink about RMAing them. I think that is worse than what asus is doing.  don't get me wrong asus needs to improve but they haven't lowered themselves down to gigabytes level.  YET.  But theat is just my opinion.
Well this changes my mind about asus
ASUS customer ever since i bought my GeForce 2 GTS 32mb card. Well guess its over... happy i switched from ngreedia and bought a 6750xt Red Devil from my old 1070 strix, (would never have gone with asus for GFX their new strix looks is atrocious). 2 shit companies that havent gotten my money now. Man things just keeps getting better and better haha.
My MSI smokes and it's old r5 set up
This is a shame. Asus has been my go to for years. I don't want to think about it that hard when I build. I just want to know that what I'm going to get is going to work, and if it doesn't, they're not going to fight me.
they used to be sooo good when they first blew up and the quality has been dropping year by year. I mean their tuf brand has been all over the place for quite a while
Oh, while you’re at it, DHL made a tangential appearance here, f— DHL too. Another company that does not have the consumer’s back.
Yould have better luck with Biostar at this point
I have a x670 asus board, was the only "white" theme board at the time fml lol
Funny enough that AsRock used to be ASUS subsidiary and now they are making better quality products under Pegatron management than their founders.
"Your Stuff" at 1:14 sounded dubbed over almost like you might've said something else lol
Nicely done Jay! I would like to ask something. Why are most motherboard packages not sealed properly. I pay for a 500+ usd motherboard and receive a box, which literally has no seal, just a box I can open. I once received a damaged board (entire row of broken pins) and immediately started the rma. The seller accused me of being the person who was responsible of that damage.. in the end I got what i deserved...all this happened because of open boxes
ASUS went from the best to a complete mess in like 2 generations of products.
Jay, so what the safe motherboard for 7800x3d?
As always, mad respect, Jay. Thank you for the talking head vid.
I built a new system based on Asus X670E Extreme because of this channel and the builds you was doing feel some what sick now, I have a never used Asus before MSI was my go to board so far the SOC on 1202 has behaved the problems I have are system will not boot after restart USB drop outs and a system crash that I had to clear Cmos to get it to boot only setting I have changed in bios is expo 1  I'm glad you can just drop Asus but a lot of us are not in the position to do that we are stuck hoping they sort this out here's hoping that large YouTube's like yourself doing this will force Asus to sort their shit out.
I have alwalys used MSI boards and never had a problem, planning out my next build and was already looking at MSI but certainly will not be using ASUS boards any time soon
I will not buy or recommend anything from Asus every again unless they honor warranty of all the effected users plus pay for the cpu that's burnt also. Also they must publicly apologize to the world by admitting how stupid they were to release an untested bios that warns users about voiding warranty. That's really stupid and really really low. I don't know what the hell the people at Asus HQ were thinking. Were they high or something? They probably were. Also I have a rog flow x13 the 2022 variant with ryzen 6800hs and rtx 3050. Since the purchase I have tried both windows 10 and 11 with multiple different versions of their firmware. I still sometimes get BSOD. That device utterly is broken. It's DOA. Because I'm an experienced user I set the processor power state to low so I don't quite often get BSOD but it's an annoying inconvenience. Asus has really became a stupid company that releases stuff that are under engineered or untested at best. Also not to mention that they had these "mining rx 470's" with only 4 VRM power stages instead of 8 of them that existed in the gaming variant of the same card that comes with the same PCB which ran extremely hot because of the stupid removal of 4 power stages. That's such a cheap corner to cut to save money.
Thank you homie.  This is another reason I love your content.  Standing up for the little guy.
Time to give Biostar their fair shake. Their boards are over the top.
This fucking blows too, I have some ASUS boards for x570 and x299 and they are rock solid. I have had so few issues with ASUS boards from previous generations.
I used to run a lot of asus. Until last gen. I bought both a 6800xt and b550 motherboard from asus. Both of them had major issues i had to RMA. The GPU i had to RMA multiple times for 2 separate issues. I received next to no support from asus during either process.  I decided then to not buy asus anymore.  As per my issues: 6800xt STRIX LC 1, unstable at stock settings, constant crashing unless i downclocked by 200mhz  6800xt STRIX LC 2, RGB LEDs damaged, having constant seisures.  Strix B550 gaming F, i/o drivers keept crashing and whole system would have major intermittent stutters that last for 2-3 seconds.
ASUS isn't going to give a crap until they fall.  They might put out a message to play the "we heard you" chord but it will be just words.  I applaud big channels that call them out on their BS.  I've always stuck by brands that take care of their mistakes and are honest about those mistakes.  But, here we are, ASUS is playing stupid games and we all know what the prizes will be.
Is there a video on current quality motherboards you'd recommend? I have an asus motherboard and am concerned i need to go ahead and look for a replacement.
gaming companies want you to pay $70 to basically be a beta tester and report issues so they can be fixed down the line. now manufacturers want you to try beta bios on your pc?
You have my respect for this decision. As a consumer, absolutely appreciate this stance.
Hey Jay! Have you heard about the MSI hack that puts BIOS from certain MSI MBs at risk?
Does this voltage issue also apply to the proart version of the asus x670?
Should I upgrade to ddr5 or just upgrade to 5800x 3d and stick with ddr4?
The last stable boards from asus were the Z270 and the Z370, afterwards everything started going downhill, my personal rig with a ROG STRIX Z590-E works like a charm one day, and some other days my headphones just start disconnecting and also my keyboard, some apps wont start overall a huge mess.
I've had so many Asus boards over the years, Strikers, Rampages, Maximus's, Crosshairs..after this shit, no more, in the bin Asus.
Swap out the ASUS board on your personal build and verify that it fixes your problem please! Lets get scientific with it.
proud of you
I'm done with asus anyway.  Msi boards are my favorites for both intel & amd.
I agree about ASUS going down hill.  I've been buying their boards for years.  Everything used to be great.  Customer service was amazing, and now...."we will be forwarding your problem up.  wait 2-3 days for a reply". I went through 3 z690 extreme boards, and now I'm done.  This is my last pc internal part I buy from that brand.  I'm not buying their screens anymore either, but that's just in spite.  I'm still dealing with DDR5 issues on boot.  One of the problems was if I had my razor keyboard plugged into USB-C it would be stuck in ram boot scan until i unplugged my keyboard or completely disconnecting all power to the computer.  And now the last couple days its been doing it again.....  Still haven't troubleshooted it.
Oh ffs. My Asus crosshair prebuilt arrives tomorrow. So... So great that all this comes out now... Lol Can someone actually tell me if I need to worry if im Using a 7950X non 3d. Is it only the 3D chips? Is it easy to update bios? Should i drop memory clock to non expo as a precaution until a new non beta fully tested bios is available. How to do that? Who's affected and what to do video might be the most productive thing to make right now. Rather than ASUS baaad. Bad asus. Naughty!  If this is just 1 board and 1 chip. And its high end board and one sorta high end chip, how many people have this combination, a few? Why would ASUS want to cover their backs so hard if it is such a low number of boards and just one type of CPU??? Is the board overvolting all CPUs to their detriment? This is typical me. Dont upgrade for 10 fricken years and the moment the trigger gets pulled...
God dammit first EVGA now ASUS well crappo. At least EVGA makes motherboards still. I have an ASUS TUF board but when I upgrade unless I see massive improvements will probably be switching brands. Not sure where to go but EVGA and Asrock seem like good choices
About Damn ⏱ Jay❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕❕Asus buys all their components from Vietnam and Cambodia and builds their boards there complete garbage👈👈👈👈👈👈
Thanks for calling them out on their bullshit. I'll now know what not to buy. Fuck the greedy bastards. I hope they go under just like the banks.
Have the same problem here with my asus board with the random disconnecting usb and usb-c.
I just had to RMA a brand new X670E Motherboard with Asus... It took me about 6 phone calls, 7 Live chats, and finally a letter to an Executive in the US. The Motherboard was new and used maybe 3 weeks, 3 dead RAM slots, and also it not shutting down...  I have the replacement MB from them in there now, still same shut down issue, at least the RAM slots work... I so want to get rid of this board and move to Gigabyte or MSI....  I am done with ASUS!!!
Wow thats really disappointing since I have been an Asus fanboy for years ever since I built my first PC on an AM4 platform years back their products were the only ones that weren't garabage out of the box. I had issues with EVGA, MSI, and gigabit and was frustrated until I came across Asus. I honestly have never had any hardware issues and even the software worked really well.  I had always heard people complain about the Asus sof which was unfortunate. But now they are failing in the hardware side wich just makes me sad. I really hope they change and get better and fix the issues they have.
Asus fucked up big time. i threw away all my asus shit.
which boards do you recommend then?
i remember the day my asus b550 caught fire because of an rgb connecter that didnt even have anything plugged into it
Sad coil whine noises over at Asus 😢 from maximus hero to maximus villain
Hey Jay, I have been planning a white themed set up, with an white Asus motherboard, have you any other suggestions for a reliable white motherboard (ddr5 compatible)
Loved this video!
also talk about a perfect marketing tagline "Solid as an Asrock"
@JayzTwoCents so can someone clarify with me..... Is this just the 3d chips having issues with EXPO "OR" The whole of 7000 series of AMD Chips? Would love to know whether to get a 7950x non 3D or a The 🌞 i9 13900k 🤔
I went with Asrock for my AM4 build last year. Absolutely stable.
Here in Brazil we use an expression that i think that has the same "weight" as in english, which is "Bad Character" they are freakin malicious, they play within the rules but in a way that dont have any consideration by the other (clients) and this is so discusting to see in not only Asus but a lot of other companies...
Well after Nvidia we're now at ASUS.... Feels like the bubble of massively overpricing and blaming all to the pandemic and the war is bursting now. A theme that was well expected and is happening more and more - not just with hardware. I get the feeling that this is far from over. I'm just glad that it happens rather sooner than later and we get rid of all this "really overpriced gear" and soon return to realistic pricing and quality products.
It's rather sad that the board quality went downhill, I just thought their gaming laptop lineup with the machine applied liquid metal and substandard thermal pads they're using were terrible.
Maybe mirroring some comments below, i have an x570 dark hero for 3 years now...updating to 4304 (2 years+ in without issues) gave me random 00 codes even on stock settings (i thought it was my overclock) for several weeks straight, i tried to update to 4402 before rolling back to 4006 (last stable) and it worked...but they have also lost my trust going forward, looking at ASUS forums, it seems it wasnt just me...  Anyway, user sentiment is very bad, just look at their RMA emails etc...steve mentioned that too
Absoltuely zero excuses. They have the clientel and have super premium prices. Guess the bugs are features now
Are both AMD and Intel sockets affected? I've a TUF Z690 board but haven't had any problems thankfully.
I was thinking on buying a rog zephores g14 (2022) laptop. Should I still follow with this purchase because of this current situation?
I fully agree, i had stability issues with my 7950X on a ASUS TUF Gaming X670E Plus board as well - especially with running EXPO. It me over a month to solve the issue, by swapping out my CPU with a new one (seemed the memory controller got killed) and replaced the memory with a 2x32 GB Kit. The mainboard was not swapped, but i had tried dozens of ram configurations with/without EXPO and several BIOS updates until it settled. It was a real pain, but since then my system works perfectly. In addition i locked my PPT to 135W to not instantly get a 90 degrees hot CPU with a (Liquid Freezer II AIO), when the CPU is under load. Yes i am aware, i loose performance with that, but i can´t negative offset the PBO curves - not even the slightest. No idea, if this is a ASUS/Mainboard problem or poor silicon quality.  But looking at the HWInfo i see that my CPU is constantly running with voltages over 1.4V, so i am little bit worried that i wear down my silicon more quickly. But i will only update the BIOS when it is not BETA and fully fixes the voltage problem...
1.35v SOC....not great , not terrible....
This is why i sub
i'm so sad since i was asus fan for so long
I have been saying this about ASUS since the 1990s. I used to be a electronic technician working in many things.  Hype saved ASUS but their MBs have always been iffy.  I also feel the somewhat the same way about AMD, those chips always ran too hot for my liking.  GPUs and CPUs with third rate drivers for their GPUs.  Just my take.  KISS.. keep it simple silly.
Man, this is really upsetting for me. I've always loved ASUS's motherboards and their recent behavior, while it didn't affect me as I didn't upgrade, has been extremely disappointing.  I hope ASUS can grow some balls and recognize what they have done wrong and fix it. Going forward it will be very difficult for me to support them.
👏 Well done Jay for taking a stand. I'm glad I've stuck to Gigabyte gear the last few years, their quality has improved heaps and I've had no problems at all with Gigabyte gear. Both of my PC's have Gigabyte MOBOs and Gigabyte GPU's too.  That would really suck to have a new PC that fries the MOBO and CPU, crap like that shouldn't even make it to the shelf for sale. I really feel for you guys and gals that have to deal with this crap. Cheers
I dont know what you signed but, i hope you dont get sued for this. Usually you cant talk bad when you sign a contract
It took 9yrs of hard use for my PG278Q to finally die and my Rampage IV gene is still chugging along though the age is showing. This is some sad news. Its been fun. The EVGA not making gpus news a while back hit the hardest though.
Man, that's a bad experience but I build over 100 systems a year with various Asus boards and rarely have an issue. I ended up with Asus as over the years they have been the most stable boards in my experience. Just throwing that out there. Maybe the issue is with the department that works with media outlets?
Also the Bricks you get on Asus is redicioulus.
Recently sent in my laptop for repair (in canada). Got it back (now with no warranty from their one time fix) with some cpu cores at the temp limit. Opened up and the liquid metal was all corroded. Met someone else today (believe it or not!) who is also in canada and has the same issue. Is the repair centre full of aluminum debris??
Typical Chinese warranty.  Burning and fire sounds more like a problem than an issue
Ive been such an ASUS fan FOREVER, i have asus monitor, asus laptop, asus board in my system atm, wanting to upgrade to AM5 w/ a new ASUS board and then i start seeing this. dodged a bullet? I loved ASUS, i dont know what to do now
Asus has screwed me over in RMA. I can never recommend them. Such a crappy company
time to go MSI or Asrock now ig. i always always recommended asus to my friends who ask me for brand recommendations and now i'm no longer confident in recommending them anymore.
I'm on AM4 with an Asus motherboard and will be for some time, since I don't need to upgrade for a few more years at minimum.  I've had Asus for 3 generations of builds.  I have nothing but support for your decision after watching this and GN's videos.  My next motherboard will likely be AsRock, as I have had nothing but stability from them in my Proxmox system, also AM4.
I'm scared cause I run a Asus board but don't have the money to switch it right now Shiiiiiiiiiiiiittt
what was the other brand Jay was referring to that he cut ties to?
I figured out 13 years ago that their RMA system consists of sending the same product back after doing nothing and calming it works or sending out a product that was sent in by another customer. They will allow you to re-RMA for 90 days and keep sending other peoples RMA's till you get tired of dealing with them and paying to ship the broken products they keep sending you.
Just switched to meg ace 670e/7800x3d from rog strix z790e/13600k. Its like night and day difference. Seemless installation from intel windows to amd windows as close as you can get to plug and play(previously when i switched my 12600k/msi mb to 13600k, asus bios forced me to wipe out my ssd for it to recognize me. Perhaps i did it wrong, but i shouldnt have configure my ssd/download other bios beforehand on a $500 mb). My asus mb couldnt xmp or auto overclock the cpu let alone manual. Tried using 2 ramsticks instead of 4 still didnt work.   Good thing microcenter warranty is a thing, i figured something like this would happen as my gf’s 12600k/asus prime z690 was such a pain to install and configure. Otherwise id be running my ram on default 4800.  This is highly unacceptable as that dam motherboard cost $500  Keep em honest and asus quality is not a thing anymore from my personal experience
Can everyone sue Asus now?
ASUS needs to get back to the quality they were known for.. Fix your audio ASUS, 11-band EQ !!  AM3+4EVR
Hey, I know you’ve given Gigabyte a pretty solid rest since you’ve used their stuff—but maybe closing the door on ASUS leaves a cracked window for Gigabyte to come back into your channel?  I know you had a bad experience once upon a time, but you also said you didn’t really like the MSI dragon that’s on everything—so there’s always an eagle flexing it’s biceps or whatever ASRock has for their logo.
Thanks man this means a lot I’ll be changing the board and gpu in my cart, also not buying the handheld!!!!
I wish EVGA would pivot into Motherboards full time. But it just seems like EVGA is slowly shutting down it's brand now. Which is a shame since they have some of the best engineers in the business.  BTW, i was watching Hardware Unboxed reviews and their budget boards overview scared me away from the ASUS TUF brands. I eventually decided on ASrock Riptide based on the reviews.
Yeah just got here from GN.  Looks like people are finally tired of the shenanigans.  I hope ASUS takes this as an opportunity to really re-organize how they're treating the consumer.  Being at the top has led to complacency.
Problems don't seem worth burning bridge with huge customer. Instead of saying you're fired, I'd say until some things are fixed we can't work together. That way the door stays open and viewers don't say wtf if you ever work together again. But I wonder if it's more about the brand deal not being finalized. And both of you sitting on your high horses. Almost 4mil subs could give anyone a big ego. How do you check your own ego at that level I wonder. But it may be more of a ego build up in some of the staff that affects their communication with other companies on both sides. Seems like it would be a hard thing to manage. Maybe training staff on how to handle condescending people so it doesn't escalate and harm productivity. Anyways, just my thoughts.
When I went to download the newest BIOS for the prime x670e-pro wifi and saw that beta bios that said they aren't responsible, I laughed and said to myself "are you kidding me?"
let me  get this right, does AMD not have the onus to make sure their CPU actually work on a given mother board- If your laying the blame solely on the mother board and letting AMD Off the hook, I think you're misguided-  I have no fight in this game I don't make s*** from either
Crazy thing is that this whole ASUS problem pops out right when they launched ROG Ally last night. Welp, they're different division but good luck for them because one major issue from one division in regular peeps eyes would make the entire company look bad. I did have a really bad feeling since that wrong capacitor placement issue in their Z690, looks like my fear is confirmed and they went beyond and far more than just downhill this time
Damn. I was still hoping Asus would fix it. And isn’t there a version that doesn’t void your warranty?  I saw 3 versions, the 2 most recent were warranty voiding betas, but the version before that has the ryzen 7000 soc 1.3 “fix” (not a true fix) and no language about voiding warranty. X670e hero
I had a ASUS board on my most recent build, and it wouldnt work with my ram, wouldnt recognize my gpu unless i turned on csm. Currently working on finding a new board that isnt asus
Speak Two Cents to Power !
I stopped buying Asus products a long time ago. Maybe I've had bad luck, but every Asus product I've ever bought has had a major issue or has failed prematurely.
Everyone buy Jays merch to support
Once again, your integrity speaks for itself. I'm have been an adamant ASUS builder for about 20 years. Both AMD & Intel and with the last system I built, (my own of course) I have seen a huge decline in software/BIOS support.  TUF gaming X570 Wifi Plus. Bought in 2019. Just within the last 2 months they finally put out a solid BIOS that fully supports D.O.C.P. running 3600mhz without Bsod. Always Just docp with no oc or  PBoverdrive enabled. 🤦‍♂️ The days of ASUS being a masterclass are long gone.
Show normal available settings and melt a chip down. Just show it how it is. For the real reaction
It's kind of funny when I build system often I get asked what MB is the best to go with #1 has always been Asus. But times have slowed down and parts are still 20 to 30% over priced. People respect my opinion due to working day in and day out with all kinds of name brands land seeing the problems that needs repaired. But what people don't understand not only do we see the work we also spend lots of time watching and listening to others in the field. So where customers respect our knowledge we as tech respect our fellow tech comments. And the past 5 years a lot what your covered in this video I've noticed as well. So at this point I have to agree with you and will no longer be recommend Asus as the goto brand. Keep up the great work Jayz.
You totally changed my mind, I am in the stage when I select parts for my new gaming rig and I removed all ASUS products from my shopping cart, I will go for MSI even for the GPU, I will take the MSI liquid cooled.
Earlier this year I had to warranty my $1000 ASUS WRX80 Workstation board due to weld issues with the included quad m.2 card causing the BIOS to brick itself and other than having to pay to ship it to them the RMA process wasn't too bad.   My first AsRock board was an AM3+ board for my AMD FX-9590 Black and it was rock solid.  You are more than welcome to send some of those ASUS boards my way. LOL.
I have the x670 E it has been the worst board I’ve ever owned. Once x700 boards come out I’ll be upgrading and it won’t be Asus again.
That is the right move from you thanks for doing it
1:13 Hey, uh, keep your [STUFF] 😂
I've been thinking on buying a ASUS TUF gaming z570x for my r7 5800x rx6700xt build, should I take a look at asrock x570 pro4 or asrock x570s pg riptide?
Had an ASUS motherboard in my online cart at Micro Center until I saw this video. Happily switched that out after seeing this video. Thank you for saving me the potential hassle.
I'm joining the boycott. As a lifelong ASUS fan, and with my entire current PC being ASUS (mobo, gfx, cooler, mouse and headphones). They have seemed to care less and less over the last couple of years. I'm done with them too...  Their software has been a splinter in my head for over a decade now. I'm so tired of dealing with Armory Crate's nonsense and every update is scary. Their drivers and bios is always a massive stress point too.
And to think that the salesperson at Microcenter that was helping me pick out parts for my Ryzen build told me to avoid ASUS like the plague. I don't even remember his name, but damn do I wish I could go back to the store and shake his hand and tell him that he helped me avoid a hell of a lot of headaches.
Thanks Jay. I've been on ASUS autopilot for 15+ years building PCs, as they've never let me down. I just bought a 670E-E board, thankfully waiting on a GPU block before I build, and have been seeing so many issues with these boards, it's made me very apprehensive. Once I saw this video, I knew the fates had decided...went on Amazon for a return and I'm dropping the board off to UPS first thing in the morning and now giving MSI a first try in my system.
There are simply too many shitty things going on in the world right now 😕
Well, shit. Now I feel like my ASUS ROG STRIX X570-E GAMING is a ticking timebomb.  :(
Have to admire his honesty in a corporate environment. Well done Jay for making a stance and not compromising on sub-standard products!
should I get MSI MEG X670E GODLIKE
Very nice! Asus definitely needs slap on the cheek.
I don't know if my components are in that list but  mine has been running very well.
You know it's a bad situation when MSI is the better option!
I had a cross hair vii board in onenif my systems that worked great one day then the next would dram crash out of nowhere. Switched everything cost me tons of money only to find out once I swapped mobos the problem went away lol...I'm not surprised one bit by this neither should any of you other enthusiasts out there
Lol bent pin i had a Sabertooth X58 with bent pin and i was force to unbent them or buy a new one they refuse refund.
It's a shame. I wanted to upgrade form my ROG X570-F to an "X770E" Hero or Extreme for Zen5 as I like their hardware and wanted to avoid early adopter issues with AM5. But now I'll either go with an MSI or ASRock Mobo
I ditched ASUS products in the mid 2000's . AsRock hasn't let me down yet
I happened to read reviews for the x670e strix(months before all this), most were bad, and now this is all happening is crazy. I built a brand new AM5 system for editing, & i'm still gaming on my  b550 i strix motherboard... Asus always been one of my favorite brands, such a disappointment to Asus.  I went with Asrock x670e Carrara, it's so pretty in person, & a q led which i've never had on a board before.
but regardless what asus and amd trying to match intel ddr5 high bandwidth that both are long way to go with ps5 system ram bandwidth is over 250gb /s  that share with vram ...intel barely touching 98gb/s vs amd sluggish hitting 65 gb/s ...not great , not terrible
Here's me, having avoided Asus for years now, due to constant issues with motherboards. Glad to see its finally hitting mainstream
Thank you for the great video J. Rant warning* I was going to buy an asrock x670 board when I was in microcenter, but an employer strongly advised the Asus x670e-plus wifi and I bought it because I knew Asus from their good reputation. I'm starting to seriously regret my decision at this point. I did not pay 250+ for a board that could kill my cpu at any update. Voiding my warranty for updating to their latest software should 100% be against the law. If this board kills my cpu I'm screwed, because I can't afford to replace my cpu and mobo and whatever else it takes with it. These are not problems we should be dealing with in 2023. Get your crap together ASUS!
My overall experience is the same. ASUS in decline, Gigabyte going up (again), MSI standing still, ASRock standing still.
It's a shame, i was a fan of crosshair v formula z when i bought one and i think of asus as the go to for the better boards. board manufacturers need to stop playing stupid games
Been buying Asus boards since early 2000's, this is very disappointing. I guess I stick to ASRock? Very disappointing.
ASUS is fuckin up
i was nervous when i bought my tuf gaming x670e board that they couldn't afford to even put debug led's on the thing. board just died one time i tried to fire it up been in RMA for two months now. last time i had to RMA a motherboard was 2003. Even the RMA process has been really hard. only bought ASUS for everything for the last 15 years. my rose tinted glasses have fallen off I now trying to think what is the next best brand to support going forward.
It's a 700$ board!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! nuf said. love you guys. it's sad. they were in a good light even with problems years ago. Sounds like not so much
So Asus is down the shitter, Gigabyte is horrid RMA processes, MSI is blacklisted for shady review bullying practices. Where does that leave us? ASRock, EVGA(limited choices), NZXT(ASrock clone)?  This keeps up and we will all be forced to just buy a SteamDeck or some such to play games ...
"1:12 Keep your stuff" sounded like a bad TBS TV edit of a movie... hehehe
Been repairing computers for 25 years, and  I haven't bought Asus, because I read the reviews of all the motherboard manufacturers for motherboards in the price range I'm interested in, and Asus always had the strangest issues being reported by users. Now, apparently, after many bios updates, they fix those issues, but till then you have to deal with a unstable system, and when you trying to sell new computers to customers, you don't want them calling you all the time with random problems, because it make you look bad, that you sell crap computers. I have a reputation for good quality computers that last basically forever. So you can trust any computer I build, because I use only quality parts, with solid reviews, by computers that give the best warranties, that stand behind their products.   Asus never gave me the vibe that I should trust their motherboards for the reasons stated above. Even their TUF series has those kind of strange problem reviews, and I would think, they would be their most solid product they could make, just based on what the line is suppose to be, and they still can't get it right. smh  MSI makes some pretty boards, but I've had bad experiences getting them to stand behind their product. I've always like Gigabyte, but the last few years, they seem to have gone down hill.  Asrock has been good for me, and Biostar was always a solid board makers for me as well, though I haven't really gotten anything from for quite awhile.  It really seems like all the Manufacturers have let the quality go down, and the price go way up. It's like trying to win the lottery on what to buy today. smh
Funny i never had a problem with ASUS and Intel- maybe just maybe part of the problem is AMD
I ran an Asrock Z97 with an Intel 4690K and had it overclocked to 4.4 ghz from 3.5 stock for many years. The only issue I had was my "D" drive SSD and my "E" drive mechanical would swap letters every time I rebooted. So I just got in the habit of rebooting 2 times to keep the drive letters correct and all shortcuts working right.
Massive props for standing up and saying it like it is (as is Steve). ASUS is a product of it's own greed, just like Nvidia.
I have problems with my ROG Crosshair VIII Hero X570 mobo as well... usb issues. I tried every f**** bios and it doesnt help.
WOW you just saved me!! I am just about to purchase one of their Z790-Plus WiFi D4 motherboard... No more Asus!!!
sorry jay it sucks...  i know how it is i got a evga 2080 ti and had alot of issues and rma it and then the fan went out i had to replace the fan and not sure how much longer it will last me
I got ROG STRIX X670E-I with Ryzen 7 7800x3d sitting in half competed build waiting for final bios... Now I'm so dissapointed that I didn't went Intel :(, but I was so exited for 7000x3d series.
My favorite hardware channel lately. Interestingly enough, just a week ago i decided against ASUS for my coming upgrade, and to stay with MSI. It all checks out. :)
Question, are you just not accepting AMD boards or Intel too ?
They're even worse then Cooler Master lol
I gotta say J I’m really proud you are standing up to Asus we all know how hard it must be considering that’s really all you use in your personal builds I personally stopped using Asus 7 years ago when I got messed over by them and would get asrock over them for years now it’s nice to see others haven just as good of luck with Asrock as I have they are getting pretty good my last 3 MB have been gigabyte masters and had zero problems with them
I've felt similarly about ASUS for a few years now as well. They used to be my default choice for motherboards, GPUs, and laptops. In the last few years I've had an ASUS PSU fail, and a board that was DOA. Not a huge deal, both were returned to and refunded by the retailer, but not particularly confidence inspiring.  Most recently I bought a ROG Zephyrus m16 with a 3070ti, a relatively expensive offering in the ASUS ROG lineup. Within about a month of light usage (normally I run an external keyboard and hardly ever even touch the one on the laptop itself), one of the keycaps started popping off, the problem is that one of the tiny prongs that hold it to the key switch itself broke.   I reached out to ASUS support, explained the issue, explained that this is the computer I run my business from, and asked for them to send me a singular wafer-style keycap so that I can simply pop it on and fix the issue. The response from not only the phone rep that I was talking to, but also their supervisor, was that the laptop needs to be shipped to ASUS for a full RMA and repair process, the cost of which was TBD (everything still under warranty of course). I offered to send pictures, video of the issue, they did not budge. I'm sorry, but I don't think it's reasonable to have to ship over an otherwise fully functioning laptop over a 5 cent(?) key cap.
I had an AMD 5500 went crashy and ended up freezing even in the bios after 2 weeks. I had put it in an old ASUS B450 board I had sitting around at work that was new.  I had to upgrade the bios,  I was excited to reuse a board that was just sitting unused but somehow ended up killing the cpu  or it was bad from the start.  I changed out PSU and used a MSI gaming X570 gaming board and still locked up.  The replacement cpu has not had one issue but I am undervolting it slightly.
I installed the update and my PC keeps taking me back to bios because it doesn't want to boot. X670 hero has been trash ever since I got it. Boot times are way too long. When I finally get it to boot the PC is recording my ram at 3600mhz. I got Asus because they were the best.
If I ever be so financially irresponsible to buy a $700+ motherboard it is better to be perfect in every aspect. It is crazy to see Asus's quality to go from top notch to Gigabyte level.
Kinda surprised this broke. It should have been when Mobo caught on fire
Asus taking a page out of Apple's playbook 🙄🙄  Asus been overpriced crap for a LONG time this isn't something new. Any company selling overblown coolers on a 60 class card for over double MSRP can fk right off. Corsair has been the exact same for a long time. Marketing is the most powerful and it pulls in the most no offense suckers. Corsair besides their rebranded power supplies are mostly overpriced junk. I go for the best for the money period. IDC the name at all, I research the product and most of the time I find it's a main supplier to begin with that is just now selling under their own made brand like T-Force for ram or ADATA for SSD/nvme.
Asus been doing bad support since AM4 x370. Deliberately left bugs in BIOS, no Zen3 support / rebar until AMD forced it. Before this Asus added *DRM* to block crossflashing. Wifi routers junk firmware, open source is just community bug fixers. Do not pay premium for Asus, garbage company.
Never liked them anyways, the ROG brand seems like a façade to trick gamer bros into spending more money.
I have just watched GN's third video on the matter and just knew at least some of the big Youtube PC hardware reviewers would have to take such a step. I am glad now that I opted to NOT upgrade to Ryzen 7000 this year yet, but just going for the 5700X ... Question is just, WHO is left as a maker? Gigabyte's support is dead as well...only MSI and ASRock. EVGA only has one board for AMD...but that's for AM4 iirc.   I have used ASUS since the PVI-486 SSPG board around 1995? .. or so. But the more ASUS got the marketing frenzy with rubbish ideas like the COOLPLUG logo on the boxes (ASUS used hollow sheet metal pins in the ATX power connectors plus a few massive ones for 12V, but ASRock had no logo and simply used the much better ALL massive pins! ) and lots of other logos all over, I had drifted away from them. My AM4 system uses an ASUS board currently but that's the odd exception nowadays, because it was during the days when MSI's X570 boards had the bloody hot CPU power MOSFETS and ASUS just reused the very good regulation from the Crosshair-Series...  Where are the old days when ASUS still had good and unique ideas like the extra onboard MOLEX power connector for PSUs that didn't have the P4 power plug just yet....
the real truth is , amd users want to run at 8000 ram sticks on AM5 boards ...and thing is that they don't support it but with expo it can by running bus clock little higher like 2500 mhz that requires voltage increase and also ASUS came to amd for guidance on how it is done and AMD was so certain their zen4 cpu's are capble on running 1.3v on their SOC memory controllers only problem is ...they only have 2 vs intel have 4 ...its easier for intel to get supporter higher memory speeds by spliting by 4-way memory contoller or 2-way that it can max out to 4800 mhz on their uncore bus
I'm glad that I'm resign from ASUS PC components and Laptops couple years ago after warranty issues with factory broken laptop. I'm Star Citizen player in free time and I need at least woking PC because game sometimes don't work :D
I have had good luck with Asus in the past, to bad they have good down hill since then. Looks like I wont be buying anything Asus for a long time.
i just bought a rog strix 4080 oc is that still worthy or should i return
Due to unfortunate reasons I haven't been able to get off the asus z390-f board in my build - and no matter what I do I still get wild vcore spikes that have been seen as high as 1.45 on a 9700k... she's gonna kick the bucket sometime - atleast it's alive yet for me to type this on - should it kick the bucket back to the msi gaming 7 / 4690k for a little while xD
I have been having trouble with my build I gave up on playing any game with high specs if you will like warzone kind of game because it would crash and restart my whole computer, I been suspecting the motherboard but now I know and I appreciate this info. It's been a headache one after another but it's about time I get rid of it and once again Thanks.
Can confirm that the ASRock board in my Ryzen 7700X build has also been rock solid. Really considering moving my 5800X build to ASRock as well (mostly for more x16 PCIe ports for storage and USB-C front panel support).
Wow, this is unacceptable!!! Thank's for informing us all Jay!!!! Crazy this crap happens in 23!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢 When I built my last pc I used the asus gaming E wifi ddr5 board and it's been great with my 12900k.
I want to build use most asus part after see this video i think i need to chance my list🥲
Wish this clip was made 3 months ago.  It would have saved me soooooo many headaches - in the end had to return the X670E and go with Gigabyte instead
I've seen this coming for years since the whole GPU scalping and price hiking started Asus has cared more about profit than product. It is nice to see others openly talk about this and see higher end Youtubers like yourself actively start rejecting companies for their bad practice's towards consumers.  This in my eyes only increased my respect for you as a content creator because the only way companies like Asus will change and learn is if more people are informed and the companies get a very loud wakeup call from consumers NOT using their technology.  PS: I also switched to Asrock a few years ago and can agree the products they make may not be the most spectacular looking but in the last 10 years I have not had a single problem with one of the motherboards I have got.
I have a z-270 that had damaged pins in the socket I tried to rma it and they said its my fault. It was like that from the factory. Its still working just fine since 2016 with a 7700k but Im still mad about it. Currently I have a B550m TUF and a x570i rog strix and I hope those are OK. I am glad I went with Ryzen 5000 series setups instead of 7000 series
Suddenly, the issues I have had after updating my bios are starting to make sense.
Thank you for standing up for those who won't be heard. Good use of platform and showing consideration for others against predatory practices. Good show.
I'm all for abandoning ASUS despite them being my goto source for well over a decade. The trouble is, doesn't MSI's data breach leave their boards vulnerable!?
Day after day, ps5 and xbox series x looks more appealing.
Been a long time Asus (motherboards) user, now whats the company i can move to?
ASUS... Always had issues with their stuff since the Sabretooth-series. After a while, the USB2 Controller for the front-panel stopped working. RMA'd it, same issue again a year later. Foolishly choose to ignore it, as the rear IO-panel USB2 were still working fine. WLAN-cards. Purchased three for a number of builds I was doing for family and friends at the time. None were working. RMA'd and ONE of the three replacements I got worked. Decided to go with a Crosshair 7 Hero in my latest build a few years ago. Guess what? My front-panel USB2s stopped working just after the warrenty-period was over.
I recently got a z690 strip, with an i13900k, will keep my fingers crossed
That's a shame, I love my Asus 32-inch curved 4k monitor. The PS5 looks mad crispy on it.
Are their power supplies okay? 😅
You can't have ASUS without the SUS
Jay just taught me a life lesson. Judge by not the problems they have, but how they solve them. Thank you :)
The cynic in me can't help but think offering that beta BIOS might've been purposefully concocted to deny warranty claims for their known faulty product. I'm usually the kinda person that'll give the benefit of the doubt for something like that, but they've simply gone too far down the wrong path to be afforded the presumption of good faith anymore. Thanks for not being afraid to stand up against them; too many people've been (literally!) burned.
This is all comes down to the on going increases in wattage of everything cpu, gpu, ram extra.   Again I am totally skipping this era.  Over priced,  no stability, could smoke or cause fire hazard.
I hope they learn from this... that ANY customer could possibly have the influence as much as Gamer Nexus or Jay and they should treat us all accordingly... but they all care about their profits and nothing but... so let em burn.. I cant WAIT to see their damage control for this video
This is what CCs should always prioritise CREDIBILITY well done guys and thanks for being OUR voice! Cheers
Before I ever buy a 1000 board from asus I would buy evga boards I love them they are just expensive and the overlooking software with evga is just fantastic in my opinion bring back the graphics cards please evga!!
i already have bad history with asus mobo..only 2 years of usage already failing then went for rma but it failed after several months of usage..then i change to gigabyte..no problem whatsoever..for that i will avoid asus pc parts..
My last Ausus MB died on me. RMA it and it died again and that was a few years ago. I did some research and they knew about the issue that casued it 3 generations back and did nothing. Asus has gone to hell since at least the 8700k generation.
I just picked up a FFXVI + PS5 bundle.  I'm done with PC, its no longer worth it.
Thank you Jay, and huge thank you to Steve @ GN, always looking out for us. I've been an IT tech in healthcare for 16yrs and the last 3yrs for the gov't. And i can tell you, i have an axe to grind with Dell at times ..
I guess they put SUS in the name for a reason. Their products really are A SUS products. Lol
My has the mighty fallen. At one point Asus and Abit were the top of the top brands out there. Abit is no more and Asus is turning into a stay away.  I'm curious, what are your thoughts of the other major players such as MSI, Gigabyte, and Asrock? Ironically, I've used all brands (including Abit) except Asus for motherboard builds over the years. I always seemed to find the features I wanted at a lower price in comparison with the other brands.  I'm also curious how good the minor players are anymore. The only ones I can think of atm that is still around is Biostar and ECS.
Asus Motherboards have gone downhill the last few gens. Removing SATA ports, BIOS Debug LEDs and raising prices 30% more than everyone else
But what about the ROG Ally?
Bububu whaaa? But gamers! Im a gaymer!! I love gameeeeessss. Cringe. Asus has always been cringe.
I can't say id but Asus again. I have a B550-plus Gaming Wifi motherboard, when I first turm my pc on after shutting the power off at the psu to protect it for storms, it wont post and shows the red light on the motherboard. I turn it off by holding the power button down, then back on and it works. I'm guessing its the motherboard as my MSI one doesn't do it.
Have had an x570 asrock since my 3900x when it came out... Been rock solid...
This is what happens when you start believing the hype yourself... We can do anything as everything turns into gold. This is what happens when you let your sales guys make decisions and everything is aimed at maximizing your profits... I hope they wake up sometime soonish...
started on computers since 98 when we wer barely starting on good computing  hardware,,, used many brands including  Asus , the only time i used the brand in my life nd abandoned it cuz of obvious issues.. used many other brands including  the longGone USA brand ICS , and many other crapy low end which  worked better then thet one.. since then i got stock on MSI for my builds,,,, nothing  to say besides;  keep on trying for new horizons but keep the ones that gavs u the best deal for ur $ nd needs,......
This video is exactly why i have been a big fan and supporter since the first skunkworks. Hats off to you Jay
They are a Chinese brand?
I love Asus's products but man, i'm dissapointed too. Pre-ordered z690-f board and it came with bended pins on cpu socket and also bended pins on the bottom of the board for power etc. Returned it and got a new one which was good but now i'm having issues with PCH temperature too high, some usb-s not working everytime and other small problems. It's not really serious for 500$ mobo...
As a current user of Asus motherboard. I'll never buy any of their products since it is overloaded with features (gimmicks) without real functionality. And don't me get started on the CPU hogging Armory crate, Aura and Ai suite
Political or not, see what happened to Fox and Budweiser, these companies will learn the consequences when you screw over your base!
I have a Asus 3060. It's goona be ok right..
It _almost_ looks like Asus agreed with Intel to kill the sales of AM5 CPUs🤔
also the price of their brands is stupidly high
Looks like my next build will not be Asus!
We know theres some ceo up there that pushed it out because of bad optics.
This bios issue hit right home... I am using an 7900x with a prime x670e-pro wifi. I am currently on v.1223. Which yes, it is removed from their support page. Not really feeling comfortable with that to be honest... I am checking frequently on asus support for an update after the whole x3d issues and they offer 2 different bios versions on 'beta version'. Which is the weirdest thing. 2 different versions on beta? 1414 and 1602 are on beta. Completely normal to offer the newest on beta right? But when you release an updated version of your previous beta and have both as beta??? That is 110% done to avoid providing support for any damages caused by your software... Who on their right mind would use a beta bios about a serious voltage issue that says this "ASUS is not responsible for direct, special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from using this beta BIOS." This is bs.
Good gravy those 2 messed up boards alone are more expensive than my car and I trust my car to carry me and my fiancé at 80 mph every day to and from work. I don't have an asus products anymore and my build is an MSI/Ryzen3800x build so my problems are only coming from my AMD GPU now. I wish people luck with the boards the y have I suppose.
Jay obviously doesn’t play video games that much, the entire industry is becoming anti-consumer and it works because the new generation doesn’t care and just buys whatever they see. They don’t understand quality of anything.
If more companies would quit trying to pull fast ones, rig things, they would be makin' money, instead of crumbling down in failure. Money is the root of all evil. If a company tries to manipulate, guess what the root of it is: money. & the more you think about that, the more you realize the answer is easy, simple, obvious. If you see or hear about a company trying to pull stuff, you know the answer & the consequences.
ASUS came from Acer.  ASRock came from ASUS.   All are Taiwanese brands.
I just bought an asus laptop last month thinking they are a good company and now I find them being so shitty
Ima white box builder and have been avoiding gigabyte be.cause of warranty issues. I guess I need to add as us to the list as no warranty cover means the product isn’t worth touching
I wanted my next laptop to be a high end ASUS. But we vote with our wallets, and by now I want to vote for Framework.
This is so disappointing. I've been building PCs for 10 years and have always used ASUS motherboards.
I had bought an asus rtx3070 retail. Out of the box gpu was dead. At least i got it exchanged on the spot and the  second one worked. Speaks for their QA though..
Wow, I just built a PC for a buddy, 7800x3d and Asus strix b650e-f, I feel like I let him down! I think I've built a minimum of 10 PCs in the past 25 years with Asus motherboards. Not just mine.. they've really gone down hill in the past few years. Sad. I guess continue looking at their competition from now on.
So what company is reliable nowadays? MSI? Gigabyte? I'm in the process of upgrading my pc, don't want to end up with components from a company that doesn't support me if I run into any problems.
Hell yeah. I support the MSI switch for the mega man build. I have been using MSI ever since my first build when I was 12. I’ve never had any notable problems with their products and I will continue to use their products until they do something stupid also.
About 7-8 years ago, I considered ASUS to be one of the more trustworthy/reliable picks for motherboard. They've however now burned their reputation. It'll take a long time, even with the best of behavior, for them to rebuild a reputation in my eyes.
Funny you mention ASrock as they are owned by the same parent company as ASUS, and were even started as an off-shoot of ASUS lol.
А я всегда говорил - Асус говноеды
Because you care is why i watch.
I hope Linus do this same move, and other YouTubers.
Tnx man greedy brands
Asus has been my goto for a while for personal builds and recommendations because they were solid in the past. Sad to say that's changing. This literally just happened before I upgraded, and helped a friend with their first build, so that's at least 2 builds Asus won't be a part of.
Tell EVGA to get their asses back in the game on MOBO's and they can take the market share
FINALLY! After so many years of them being pathetic you're telling the truth! Atrash republicofretards
Between Jay, and Steve, plus Linus's review of the Ally, I can literally hear Asus's stock declining. lmao
I stopped using Asus and Gigabyte for my customers who wanted x470 and higher Ryzen systems.  So far MSI and AsRock have kept me warranty free 2 years going.  AsRock does have memory controller Ram issues when using all 4 slots but it's a minor thing if most folks are buying 2 stick sets these days anyway.  Asus used to be my go to brand and Gigabyte is still a preferred with Intel builds but I'll no longer Buy Asus products till they fire whoever took over their CS and QI departments and decided to go cheap and quantity over reliability.
I will never buy Asus again. I bought the x670e hero. Thankfully I never got any of the 3D chips and I undervolted it straight out the box.
you are reson i'm saven for a ps5 pro (its not out yet but I will be ready) you where right they do sell 3070 cards with only 4 gigs of ram I'm one the unlucky folks with one still good but misleading to call it a 3070
I've always kind of run ASUS and MSI boards of similar spec side by side, and my impression was always that the MSI boards are a little more reliable, but gamers like ASUS boards because they are better for overclocking and can be driven harder. That always gave me the feeling that ASUS likes pushing things to the edge, and since CPU manufacturers don't have the headroom for overclocking they once did, that mentality is leading them to be much riskier than before. They are used to the old days when you could reliably get another 10% or so out of any CPU you buy if you only jack up the voltage like crazy, and that's just not how it is anymore in sub-10nm world... now you really have to stick to the spec or bad things happen. In my view ASUS is the main one to blame, of course, but I can tell that CPU manufacturers increasing power draw and running CPUs with less headroom hasn't made things easier on them or any other board maker. Let's just say that some of the kind of components that used to be high-end are now pretty much a bare minimum for running a modern CPU, and what you need for overclocking more insane than ever. ASUS kind of backed themselves into a corner by being a "gamer/enthusiast" brand known for overclocking boards, and that's not a good place to be in 2023.
i love the honesty Jay, Asus will no longer have my backing when i build people gaming rigs and always went with Asus from now on that will never happen again!
Hell yea, Keep on keeping it real!!
Every PC I've had since Christmas of 1998 has had an ASUS Board, starting with the HP I got as a gift that year.  I started building my own in 2004, and am currently on my 5th ASUS Motherboard in my personal builds.  I've got an ASUS Monitor, Phone, Mouse, and even a really old Laptop (like, 2nd gen Core old XD).    When I rebuilt my system *last month* I was already questioning if I should look at other brands... and only didn't because of the Microcenter deal that had ASUS Z690 boards for $70.  I'm seriously questioning that now.  And rebuilding my Dad's system with an ASUS Prime B660 board a couple months ago.  I've been buying their stuff for literally almost 20 years... and right now I wouldn't buy a mousepad from them (especially since when I did, it fell apart really fast.)  Just to illustrate *how much* ASUS Stuff I've bought, and am at this point now:  ASUS Motherboards I've owned: Whatever K6-II Motherboard was in that HP I had P4S533 (Socket 478) A8N SLI Deluxe (Socket 939) M5A97 (AM3+) Z170-AR (LGA 1151) TUF GAMING Z690-PLUS WIFI D4 (LGA 1700)  Other ASUS Products I own: Zenfone 6 Gladius PB277Q (27" 1440p@75hz monitor) K53SV-XE2 (Ancient 15" laptop) E818A6T (SATA DVD-ROM Drive, going away when case is replaced 'Soon')  Formerly Owned: ROG Whetstone Mousepad (came apart, replaced with first a Steelseries then one of Steve's)  ASUS Products I've directly gotten others to buy: M5A97 Rev 2.0 (Socket 939) PRIME B660-PLUS D4 (LGA 1700) Zenfone 6
I'm really impressed by this. People SAY a lot "This is for the consumer " But you really have stood behind that.
Yep sounds like ASUS, had the worst purchase experience of my life with the Zephyrus M16 2022 GU603ZW:  - For starters, the laptop coil whine is beyond tolerable, it's extremely noisy and has gotten worse since I purchased the laptop in April, the coil whine sounds like there's a fly stuck in my laptop EVEN AT IDLE, this worsens when using the windows ui and in general this was the start of my terrible experience with the laptop  - Echoing combo headphone jack: output feeds into input no matter what combination of adapters/hardware I use  - Trackpad clicks feels like absolute dogsht for a £2.5k rrp laptop, the right side of the trackpad is uneven/recessed more than the right, the trackpad feels extremely different depending on whether you click on the middle, left or right of the trackpad.  - The display has developed a fault where there is a "cloth effect" or warped lines all over the panel, which disappear like 95% when used for 40-60 minutes... But the warping still appears in the middle of the display  I'm honestly sick with this laptop, it's been awful, I've rma'd an asus laptop before and received it in worse condition that I'd sent it with nothing repaired (zephyrus g14), I sold that for a decent price fortunately as I'd bought it at a huge discount from the get go, and replaced it with the m16 hoping it was gonna be good, but this laptop has caused me more problems if anything. I'm done with ASUS, the coil whine problem isn't only on their laptops, my ASUS TUF 3070 Ti in my PC sounds worse even when I undervolt the GPU...  I'm done
I've been running my ASRock X570 Taichi for about 4 years now, 3800X and then upgraded to 5800X3D currently, and I can honestly say it's been a solid board and overclocked well for my 3800X. Their RGB software is hot garbage though..
Same like razer. The quality is just pure shit… I will NEVER going to buy any razer product ever again in my life
Ballsy move Jay and kudos to you for taking a stand. Personally I have had a lot of weirdness with my ASUS motherboard, its an older AM4, but just refuses to run my RAM at anything past stock so as you have said I am leaving a lot of performance on the table. Based on recent events I will be swapping the ASUS board out this weekend for an EVGA one I happen to have. EVGA one "only" has 2 slots rather than the 4 the ASUS one has, but my bet is 2 slots running at their rated speed will be way better than 4 crippled slots. I have been an ASUS fan for many years, but this has done it for me now.
Love these curse edits😂😂😂
I personally haven’t had any issues with Asus products, but firmly believe that the only way to ensure improvement is to make companies feel the pressure through bad press (looked after by outlets covering the issue and consumer sentiment) and financial impacts through people not buying their product. I will ensure no Asus product purchases until I see/hear improvements have been made. I encourage others to do the same. Great video Jay and team.
Oh f me lol
Daaaaaaaamn
Mmm, now I have doubt if to buy the ROG Ally, because if something goes wrong then ,are they going to be responsible?
If you don't know what to do with all this asus stuff. I can give you my Adress 😘
Wow...
Welp, I've bought nothing but ASUS boards over the past decade, dozens.  I was aware their quality was declining, but this sealed the deal.  I won't buy another ASUS product until they change their ways and prove it repetitively.
Can I have all the Asus stuff you don’t want anymore?
"We don't grade companies on their problems, we grade them on how they *handle* their problems."  Biggest chunk of wisdom for consumers and companies to hear.
Why would they care? your only a small 3.8m YT channel.       lol. I don't even wanna know how "well" asus PR section are doing as of this moment tbh!
Honestly my original build had an asus board in it and eventually had crashing and usb connectivity issues about a year after, i then purchase another asus board for my brother for christmas to upgrade his set up... needless to say he had a dram issue and crashing no matter what we did nothing worked and we both have aorus boards now... personally i love the aorus bios so i'll be sticking with them
I've always ranted and raved about how perfect ASUS has been for me. Boy does this scare me. Unreal. Thank you Jay for this video. My next upgrade will now go elsewhere.
Really admires peoples who have Integrity. thank you Mr. Jay dan Mr. Steve, and to ASUS : Glad I bought  Asrock
I always thought they were A SUS brand.
Well, I was saving for a Asus TUF B650, now I will probably get Aorus B650
Thanks for making this video. I had an awful experience with ASUS. I bought an ASUS ROG STRIX SCAR 15 a year ago and it was nothing but a headache. Annoying screen flickering, the wifi card just stopped working randomly and the charging brick would get dangerously hot and overheat after playing 45 minutes of Civilization 6.   I had it for 5 days before it started to malfunction on me. And as bad as the quality control on the laptop was, the customer service was so much worse. I played phone tag with their delartments when I initially wanted them to fix the laptop. They told me NewEgg was responsible for the warranty but then when I spoke with NewEgg they told me that ASUS was responsible but actually had receipts to backup that claim. All of these back and forth phone calls took over a week to fulfill but eventually ASUS reluctantly took responsibility.   They said that the repairs could take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. That was too long so I said I would rather take it to a local repair shop but they said that would void the warranty. So with the proposition of a 2 week plus repair schedule I debated on wherher or not it was worth it. It was day 21 after initially receiving it that I decided I would rather refund it. I lost a little bit of money on the shipping costs but otherwise got a full refund.   Probably the only thing ASUS was competent at was streamlining the return policy. Which, after doing some independent research, i found out that ASUS' quality control and incompetent customer service were far worse for manu other people. It's tolerable yo have poor quality control if the customer service is stellar and if the quality control is great then I frankly wouldnt need customed services' help anyway... But to be incompetent in both areas is reason for concern. They lost my business due to how long and draw out that whole process was and how they fought with me to not have to fix the laptop they sent me.  The silver lining though is that the laptop I got instead of the ASUS junk was the Lenovo Legion 7, which is perfect for all my needs. It runs everything I throw at it on max settings, the heating is manageable, its lightweight, it looks better and it shipped without any problems and is still running just as strong as the day I got it. Lenovo is much more reliable than ASUS is these days. And Acer isn't too bad either if Lenovo is out of your price range. I have experience with both and they are great laltop makers.
Thanks
So should we be cautious of their new handheld?
Yeah Asus sucks everyone please send me all your Asus GPU's motherboards especially any 4090's and anything else made by them I will dispose of them properly
asus is into heat nowadays, the asus tuf also runs hot
yeah i have a asus rog strix z490-E gaming board and if and when i uprgade my board im not going with asus at this rate
I've been favoring ASUS for, if I remember correctly, over twenty-five years, and almost exclusively loyal for the past decade. Sadly, this video only confirms my own conclusions of the past few weeks.
Thank you, Jay. Glad to see content creators like yourself and Steve from GN caring about us as the consumer. I have been a long time Asus consumer and have seen this brand starting to go down hill. Don't think I will be buying Asus motherboards for now on.
You gotr Assused  .... i stopped using Assus  after X99  ...
Great. Thanks alot Jay! Appreciate your position and integrity (why you have so many fans).. but now what am I supposed to do? (As an Asus mb owner and not so tech-savvy 59yo trying to keep up with you)
ASUS f'd up sending 2 bad motherboards to a tech YT channel with nearly 4 million subs? That is disgusting in of itself. Imagine what they do to some schmuck like me. Is there a tech company that I can actually respect?
wow, i guess Asus just toppled on top on its own weight. i still have an old H61M-E board for my I5 3rd gen, i'm so sad but i guess it's time to move on RIP asus 2023
Under Australian consumer law their little blurb that say's "we are not responsible for damage" blah blah blah means less than nothing. Our laws even say they would be responsible for the CPU too. The website for our laws gives a nice easy example, you buy a washing machine, the washing machine leaks all over your carpet, the company who made the machine is responsible for the carpet, any Australians who have had problems with an ASUS board keep this in mind, and in emails just mention Australian consumer law and they should be a lot more helpful.
Don't fucking tell me this now, I just got an ASUS MB and GPU...
Thanks for this info Jay - Great channel. I was going to get: ROG Flow Z13 (2022) GZ301 And ROG XG Mobile (2023) But now NOT so much.  I am starting to learn 3D content creation. I figured that would be fantastic. But because of the brand I am starting to look elsewhere. Again thanks for your great videos. And sorry Asus is crap !
Thanks for your opinion, i was thinking on moving out from Asus for differents reasons but you gave me the last information i needed to know. I'm definitively not paying a premium price for a non premium quality product.....
I've  been an ASUS fanboy for several years.  I love their aesthetic and the durability of their hardware.  For a long time I never bothered with the Armoury Crate software.  Last year, I decided to screw around with it a little.  This is when I realized that negative things I'd read about in forums was not so far from the truth.  I not only found the UI to be not to my liking, but the actual functionality left a lot to be desired.  Hearing experiences like Jay's has me thinking that being a fanboy is something that I fell for, hook line and sinker.  Their marketing is very good, but hearing about experiences like this have convinced me to be a smarter consumer the next time around.  If an "influencer" like Jay and others are having this bad of a time with customer support , how bad is it for the rest of us?
i just built a z790 strix and 4080 STRIX system should i be worried
Wow, I mean, I did have Asus boards screw me over a few times... interesting
i have an intel 9th gen system that is all Asus and i did have some weird issues back when i put it together. mainly the bios would not let me put my m.2 drives in raid so i had to do it through windows, as well as some aura/armoury crate issues but ive learned to work around it. i went with them cuz they had the coolest looking hardware and heard it was good but next time i upgrade i will probably be looking elsewhere unless they get their act together
Never been a fan of Asus. Always seemed like you were paying more for less. Was gonna get the b550 gaming f but went x570 taichi. No regrets
for me Asus was a one time experience, I'm running 2080ti, Maximus XI Hero and Thor 850w and, while the components performance has been stellar, I guess from when the brand was still passionate about high performance and quality, since Asus has been going downhill since Armory Crate, first the software, now bios, and DOA hardware issues being more and more common, on my purchase I decided they were dead to me and I got the last good stuff they did... THAT SAID with Asus out of the game and EVGA(sadly) retired, what are the options? Gigabyte, MSI, Asrock or weird chinese stuff with anime prints? I guess WAIFU BOARDS LEEEEETS GOOOOOOO!!! It's going to be the modern version of the 2000's enthusiast PC nostalgic swag/cringe
Holy poopenschnitzel. You tell 'em, Jay!
I can tell you one thing if Jay is done with Asus then so am I.
Not a fan of Steve,  brah.
This isn't anything new with asus.  quite a few years back their boards went to crap.  After a few years they cleaned up their act and started making quality again.  Well, looks like history is repeating.  Anyone know what other brand has a decent bios?
asus was known for instability issues due to heat in most of their components but i never imagined they'd be so dumb as to put a capacitor in the wrong way and destroy boards and cpus with their bios overvolting and destroying both the board and the cpu in place or sell a board with broken pins.
Thanks Jay. Cancelled my Amazon order for my new build revolving around same asus board. Shifting to Intel too. Not worth the risk and heartache.
-- This is the same thing ASUS did with the A7N8X back in the day.  Remember that debacle well.  This shady stuff is nothing new from Asus.
I have several Asrock boards.   I have been nothing but happy with them.  I have my three servers all running Asrock Rack server boards.  All sorts of good features with IPMI and tons of PCIE slots for controller cards and network interfaces....  I have a very basic Asrock B450 pro4 for my music studio system and another Asrock z370 pro4 for my cad design PC... All solid 24/7 reliable...  The rest of my systems all use gigabyte and also have been great.
Asus new name  ASSus   Pronounced as (ASS-seuss)
Huge respect Jay just wish this had all gone down before I built my computer any recommendation for a replacement for rog strix x670 ee I was thinking of the msi x670 p or x670e
I love the fact that the board cost is skyrocketing yet the quality is just going down lately.
I've been a long term fan of ASUS with multiple products over the years, my current build which includes the Maximus z790 Hero & Ryujin II 360 AIO have been giving me issues since I built it in March. Sad to see what's happened to this company to be honest, they were my go to manufacturer but now I'm looking elsewhere for my PC parts needs.
stop touching your nose please
It's not about getting it right every time, it's about how they handle things when it goes tits up and Asus are failing miserably with this situation 🤦‍♂ Kudos to you for dumping them my dude. Much respect 🤗
I just upgraded my PC, bought the ROG B550 Gaming-F, all this stuff coming out of the woodwork kinda makes me regret the purchase, but well, for future I'll know to stay the hell away from Asus unless they change their attitude, Asus used to be good, what happened Asus, who hurt you
When I get a chance I type about my Impact sfx morherboard.
Always liked asrock. Never had an issue
From the company that fixed Intel's 486 motherboard without having a 486 chip to test with, to this... how far the mighty have fallen
Someone said Asrock doesn't sell some of their motherboards in the US
Maybe i do need to give MSI another chance...
i am actually thinking that my last asus mother board is the reason my pc was having problems i changed to gigabyte and i have had no problems now!
I sent a faulty asus motherboard back for rma, they claimed it was fine, and just sent it back to me. Now i buy MSI boards instead.
You just saved me $700-$1000 on a new motherboard and headache. Thanks for your honesty
The AsRock Taichi Carrara board is beautiful. Maybe that will work for the all white build you’re working on. Sucks to see yet another company pull this type of shit but it’s high time we as consumers start to hold them accountable. Well done.
Every company has problems. That's part of mass production. But, it's what they do after the problem is discovered, how they handle it, how they compensate their customers, that is the difference.   Issuing a beta patch, then going "We haven't tested this, we don't know if it'll brick your board, but if it does, you're SOL. Have a nice day!" is wrong. And on top of complaints others have had regarding ASUS? I've got an Asus monitor that I pulled out of service when I upgraded, and that's the last thing from them I'll buy
I had an AsRock motherboard when I had my AMD Phenom II system and another AsRock motherboard for my Intel i5 3570K system as well. Both boards were dependable and had nice overclocking features. Meanwhile, my roommate had gone through an Asus motherboard that was popped before I got the i5, hence why I ended up with an AsRock board, and then when I upgraded to my AMD Ryzen 5 1600X, my roommate had yet another Asus board fail, so this time I ended with a Gigabyte board. Asus, as far as I am concerned, has been unreliable, overly sensitive, overpriced garbage. Pretty sad that in my personal experience, the "manufacturer you don't buy from" was not AsRock, but Asus for the last, 10 years or so. If AsRock was making garbage, I guess I got lucky three times in a row. Hell, a good friend of mine is STILL using the same AsRock motherboard I bought (8 years ago) to replace his (at the time) garbage MSI board that died while I was installing Windows on his machine.
Wow! Proud of you Jay!
A beta BIOS that voids the warranty....that sounds illegal
Getting the parts together to build my son's new system. I picked up the 7800x3d at launch, so glad I went Asrock X670E Steel Series! Dodged a major bullet there!
I don't change my rig so often, last time was during the pandemic, for sure and older model, haven't had any problems yet. But is sad to hear this, I think I've been buying products from them since the early 2000s. Hopefully I won't have to change my rig any time soon and will have time to evaluate what brand/model will be good enough for me by then
Finally we can see now on other manifacturers motherboards than asus. Asus is kinda overpriced too. and they messed up badly this time. Seems they care about money only, not customers.
Massive respect to you Jay!
It's interesting to see all these issues crop up around the same time as the ROG Ally launch. Let's see if the good PR from that will mostly hide this.
Super disappointed.  Got some great value from them in the past. Really hope I don't need any support from them anytime soon 😳
Jay change boards in your home rig with whichever brand u think would be best and let's all find the right board for us all !!!!!!!! Lol !  Seriously though help Jay  don't give up on the 7950x3D !!!
I was about to pre-order the asus ally after this nope!!! I love Linus but you have more power in my wallet them him.
Love the integrity jay
"They want you to go away as a customer."  I can sure do that. Asus has been my goto brand since 2003. But I guess that's over now.
Asus always demanded a premium price. But they don't deliver a premium quality. Just don't buy Asus products.
ASUS deserves everything that's coming to them. Good on you for having the integrity to do the right thing. We know there are plenty of "influencers" that would take the pay check and stay hush-hush.
Msi
And the sad thing is that asus was what microcenter kept doing the am5 cpu bundles with ..
So glad I went asrock for amd 7000
I had an Asus Tuf Gaming X570 motherboard that died suddenly 1 month past the warranty, earlier this year.  I don't overclock, apart from xmp, so it didn't make sense. Obviously not directly related to the current issues, as my cpu is a 5800x3d and not a 7800x3d, but still points to their inability to catch shoddy bios and/or hardware defects.
Bye Asus! Been nice knowing you!  Much respect for your stance on this sir, WP!
That's Asus off my shopping list form now on
JJ where you at?
My last two motherboards (x-570 Crosshair Hero Wifi and x-670e Crosshair Extreme) have been Asus and my current gpu is an Asus ROG Strix 4080 OC. Those will be the last Asus products I ever buy unless they completely correct things not just now but continue a trend of actually caring about their consumers moving forward. Thankfully I haven't had ANY issues with my current mobo and CPU. HWINFO64 shows my SOC voltage at 1.25v and I haven't updated the bios since the first full release BIOS since I got my mobo and 7900x on launch day. I suppose we all should have known Asus would have screwed up Bios considering how utterly trash Armoury Crate is, especially with x670e.
So, basically, all MB manufacturers in the last few years have been caught doing fishy stuff except EVGA... 😢
Don't forget all the bloatware that comes with an Asus mobo
Now a days Asus armoury crate is literally like a piece of malware.
I am sorry, but Asus has not been good for a while now. This is just the cherry on top.
I bought  an asus monitor. Vg27aq and upon plugging it to the wall i got some broken picture. I returned it and the salesman said: dead on arrival. I noticed how it was not so well packed as my previous 2017 benq monitor. If it was phisical damage from tossing around i dont know but in light of all other info i will stay away from asus.
asrock being more stable than asus is crazy
The first thing you gotta do with all their Excrementitious Boards is enter Bios and set Voltage to Manual 1.1 so it doesn't kill your CPU in a Week.
Taiwan is most defiantly not China, and if it does become part of China in the near future, pc gaming will become too expensive for literally everyone. not to mention the US will stop being the dominate superpower.
Their products have been getting worse every year, and yep they don't stand behind their products at all. The push the blame on you when something goes wrong with their product. Ran into issues with several of their monitors, laptops and gpu's over the past few years. Sent monitors back for dead pixels only to get monitors with more dead pixels, and guess what they blamed us for it. Had to write off a few laptops for dead mobo's, less than a year old, they claimed water damage, we inspected found no signs once again. I don't know what's going on with Asus but I'm moving customers to other brands these days because of their attitude towards customers and repair techs.
Run an MSI x670 carbon in your home build. It's a sexy build
This is bad news for them trying to do a handheld like the ROG ALLY. I don't trust them. Especially not now.
They’ve got the Rog Ally to drown out public outcry
Still sad to see after the pandemic so much company do not care anymore, Nvidia with EVGA, now Asus, who's next:(
Just dawned on me that the real problem could be the sad fact consumer Mobo business is being cannibalized by other high margin, high market share products.  Look at ROG Ally and their laptop business.  Retail Mobo is becoming the unwanted kid.
I am going to say what bothered me more than anything? It was when they scrubbed the product pages of many motherboards that are still used widely and now all you get in meaningless support pages. As if to say, we didn't want to pay for the storage to host those pages. Even when so many people still use and sell those motherboards. Scrubbed. That rubs me the wrong way.
Wait! I just purchased a prebuilt Asus computer for my daughter and and had the issue were her mouse and keyboard kept disconnecting. I went into the bios and changed the USB Legacey to auto (as it was "On") and that seemed to fix it. Not sure if I should just have her keep it or return it after watching your video now? @JayzTwoCents what would you recommend? this is the computer  ASUS (Renewed) ROG Strix Gaming Desktop Computer  Intel 8-Core i7-11700 up to 4.9GHz 32GB DDR4 RAM 512GB PCIe SSD + 1TB HDD RTX 3070 8GB GDDR6 WiFi 6  Bluetooth 5 USB-C Windows 10
Watching this im like is the Asus B650E-F ROG safe to use???? I dont want it to break my cpu (R9 7900X) or components
The last time I used an non-Asus board in a build was back in the Nforce2 days.  Welp, all good things come to an end...
I noticed they have been overvolting on my Skylake system so I proceed with undervolt to ensure I can use it to its last breath
I just went through 3 DOA boards in a row from ASUS. They used to be King, now they're just trash...
I know ive had a lot of issues with Armoury Crate and the weirdness it was bringing to my PC, and so when i did a fresh install of windows i made an effort to not install it. I havent experienced the same problems as others with newer hardware, but my experience and seeing others is already making me question what other brands to go with for my eventual next build.  I guess Jay's experience just helps makes my decision easier in not sticking with the Asus brand.
Asus is an expensive brand, we pay money for quality not for shit, thanx for the video much love, the next companies that needs to be set straight are gpu gougers
I was going to do a 7950X3D, Asus build 2 but f*ck that ! ,which board should we go with Instead ? Knowing that everybody is tring to figure shit out on the 7k AMD's
It sucks, I have an ASUS TUF board in my system now and while I’m not worried about anything blowing up it definitely is disappointing to see how they treat their consumers these days. Looks like I’ll be going with MSI from now on.
Microcenter did that to me with a MSI Motherboard luckily I had the store warranty double check before your return expires if you didn't add protection (Bint Pins On MSI H510m-A Pro)
Who do you think is the safest company to buy a GPU from now that EVGA no longer sells any ?
Asus have made the mistake Mercedes-Benz did in the late 90s/00s and shifted from over-engineering to focusing on bigger profits and ruined their reliability reputation and brand chasing dollars.
I went to MSI and intel exclusively for 5 years now.  I am very glad I have.   The right price for the right performance. they dont seem to have the quirky issues that many brands have.
To be honest if I was running a business in computers the 2nd month 3rd at most, of non-payment Asus would have been stripped from all advertising. the fact that they then went and potentially voided all warranty's with a bios update provided by them would be an instant ban, I bought an ASROCK mobo 11 years ago, still runs like the first day of installing it "flawlessly". if Asus cannot show simular commitment then I would never go with another Asus product again after myself, and my friend getting dodgey graphics cards that never lasted more than a year at most back in the days of the GT8800, and this just proves that I have, and always will do the right thing of avoiding Asus at all cost.
ASUS was one of my go to brands.... sad.
Looks like I’m removing ASUS products from my wish list lol
VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET, people! That's the only language corporations understand...
Why are only you an Gamers Nexus talkin about this. PlayStation did the same thing with the PS5 GPU they cut cost in corners and did a cop out with NO FSR VRS LFC AND FREESYNC instead going with the more generic HDMI 2.1 VRR that doesn't even work on anything below 48fps.. it might be RDNA2 based but it's RDNA1. That's like Nvidia releasing  4090 but giving you our  3090 capabilities.. But not many people are talking about that neither
Omg.  Wish this was out a month ago.  I bought 2 ASUS gaming laptops in the last month for my DD and I.  Waited about a year to be able to get the flow x16 and its been utter garbage.  1st x16 had a stuck CTRL key at 1 week old.  Exchanged and 10 days into new one, if any pressure applied to front right corner, it goes in and out of sleep mode.  Now it won't power on at all.  I could not believe it.  DD Zephyrus seems ok so far but I am worried.  Spent a lot of hard earned, saved money on these.   Seems like there should be a class action lawsuit.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but ASRock is owned by Pegatron which is a spinoff of Asus. 🤔 I’ve had no trouble with any ASRock boards but I’ve had quite a few Asus duds over the years.
13:00 it’s probably a mix of both. AMD has always been a royal pain in the ass when it comes to memory.
Welp, this may change future brand loyalty in any new rigs of mine. Have always used Asus GPU & MOBO'S.
this makes me second guess the rog ally because of this
I washed my hands with Asus MANY years ago regarding support for defective motherboard support back in the Pentium 4 days.  After too much of my time on the phone was waisted, I switched to EVGA which has the best support by FAR of any hardware company I have ever dealt with. Never looked back from then and have stuck with EVGA ever since.  Been completely satisfied!!
I’ve been considering the Ally recently, but all the talk lately about Asus has me reconsidering
I had to get that Z790 Apex when it came back in stock, sorry 😅
I'm so happy for not having chosen the Asus TUF b650 last year when upgrading and going for the ASRock PG one Even if it's a b650 with a 7600X, there is room to upgrade into a 7800X or even a 7900X if I want to in the future
Alienware 4 Life Boyz!
Props for standing on morals and defending the consumer, Now will ASUS fix and make things right or is this going to be their Bud Light moment because the impact will be much greater it's a small specialized market.
ASUS' software has been a weak point since the beginning. 20+ years later, not only hasn't the software caught up to the quality of their hardware but since the 10 series of cards, the marketing department has poisoned the kool-aid of the entire company.
Same experience with the ASRock x670e Taichi here at home. It DID match my black/gold/walnut aesthetic. And it's been a phenomenal board.
So your your cutting off a supplier that gives you free parts 😂
Asus pissed me off when they advertised my laptop as having 2 nvme slots but it only had one. When I called them they said only certain variations of that model have the extra slot. They wouldn't give anything to compensate either. All I got was sorry.
Thank you so much Jay. I've been building my own PCs over a period of 30 years and this generation of hardware has been the absolute worst for quality control and RMAs. I did an upgrade over the '22 holidays and I'm still dealing with the fallout of defective products. My Zotac 4090 graphics card had a nasty subtle failure from Day 1 where it wasn't stable for some games and some benchmarks at factory default clocks until you heat soaked it on a compatible game for a few minutes, like an old beater car needing to be warmed up before it worked right. Getting to the point where I could spot and reliably duplicate the pattern was an incredible amount of effort and frustration.  My first Gigabyte motherboard bricked itself during a routine BIOS update and their recovery method failed. Fortunately I was just inside the return window - I returned that and got an Asus Z790-P PRIME WiFi Motherboard. It was NEVER stable and would BSOD itself constantly even though I tried two kinds of memory, including one from their qualified memory list, and wasn't even running XMP. It cost me $40 in shipping to RMA it and after weeks went by, Asus sent me back the same board claiming everything was fine and all they did was update my BIOS.   Here's the thing though. I had replaced the Asus motherboard with a high-end Gigabyte Aorus Master. That solved my motherboard problems and when I got a replacement 4090 from Zotac, my graphics card problems went away. So now I'm out $300+ on this Asus board and I'm constantly going back and forth with their customer service. I know this particular serial number is junk, so I can't even sell it at a loss in good conscience. I need them to send me a new replacement board so at least when I go to sell it and try to cut my losses, I'm not knowingly selling a defective board to someone.   Either way you slice it though, this has been six months of troubleshooting and customer service hell. Asus deserves a smackdown for this and the industry in general does too, just to a lesser extent. I can't blame anyone for throwing their hands up and buying a gaming console instead of putting up with this nonsense.
i have a spare 7700x on a rog asus x650 mb. that i wouldn't give to my worst enemy. it bsod everyday. put it in a asrock x650 and works perfectly. been done with asus for about 3 months ain't going back for a long time if  ever
Looks like everything is leaning toward Asus being the problem with all that has been going on. I forgot who told me this but a rule to stand by is to not touch the bios (upgrading) unless there is something wrong with your build that does not work. That might not be the best advice but when there is a problem with updates with bios at least you can skate by for a while.
EVGA has always been my favorite brand their customer support has always been good at least with my experience and I'm sad they no longer make graphics cards but I was excited when the started making AMD motherboards. I have literally been hung up on by MSI customer support because they didn't understand the question I was asking about MB bios and in the middle of me rewording my questions they hung up. I know that's harsh to judge because it could of been an accident but this had been my third time calling and been transferred to multiple people to where when they hung up that was it I returned the MB and haven't bought MSI since.
Steve is under the earth
i been trying to tell people asus customer support has gotten horrible for years now. people wouldn't believe me. asus used to at least make great products but it sounds like they no longer even do that.
That's sucks Asus such a great company for PC components but it's a big punch in the skull, I still use my x570 hero wifi with 5800x no issues
Wow, such a legacy product line. I've had nothing but Asus boards for the last 20+ years. Next one wont be. That's a harsh decision you can't come back from.
Respect, Jay. That's a good stand. Also, past 5 Asus motherboards I tried had atrocious vrm noise.
Who is left for motherboards at this point? Every vendor of AM5 boards seems to be utterly unworthy of money. Gigabyte had exploding PSUs which they refused to address. MSi has an extensive history of shady crap. NZXT could not be bothered to address their hardware being a literal fire hazard. And now we have Asus retroactively making chips unsupported and voiding your warranty if you use their BIOS update that is supposed to stop their boards from melting your CPU.
Sooo when does Lenovo release some boards. Like this start going weird, I had tons and tons of problems with MSI and Gigabyte boards in the long run, Asus was more or less the only 1 left for me where ports didn't Harakiri themselves after a while. And Asrock simply doesn't have the ports I want, so I either stick with Asus Creator or literally ask Lenovo if they have a board available.
I'm actually proud to run an Asrock Steel Legend B550M now because of all of this. I originally "settled" on the board because the MSI Mortar I wanted was being scalped, but the PCIe layout makes more sense, the I/O is more in line with what I want, and the aesthetics were easy to theme the rest of my build around. Not that "black and silver with some cyan and cold-white lighting accent" is a difficult theme to build. Been debating re-tuning the RGB to match the cold white on the GPU. If the BIOS RGB let me turn like ... ONE or TWO LEDs red to match the "RX" brand mark I'd so do it.
Truthfully EVGA needs to make AMD boards fast lol. I don't trust MSI or Gigabyte and now this with ASUS. I feel like I am left with just ASROCK which isn't a bad choice just wish they made a decent white board.
Isn’t asrock owned buy asus?  I’m on an asrock board and it’s been great for last 3 years
It's been real, and it's been fun, but it not been real fun.
Thank you Jay. Your honestly, your integrity, is why we take you at face value.  I had already specced a MSI board for my next upgrade, based on your recent experiences. I have exclusively used Asus boards for nearly 20 years, not this time, maybe not next time either.
I was an asus fan for years. But their support that Ive gotten (or not gotten) in recent years is ridiculous. Ive actually moved on to other brands with better warranty and after care.
Welp, I have used ASUS in my last 3-4 builds, and in my latest build at the begining of the year I went with MSI, simply because of the EK Monobloc version of the 690 Carbon. So glad I went with MSI this time.
BASED
I've been actively boycotting Asus for around 8 years now so it's good to see Jay join in lol.
I also received a Asus Z-690 Tuf board with 2 bad scratches by the screw holes. Luckily everything work but Imagine if it didn't work. I can promise you that they would have blamed me scratching it with install. I love Asus but unfortunately you are fired from my side to. Then you have 2 pay a arm and a leg for their parts. I guess I'm going to Gigabyte or MSI next....
Not had any confidence in Asus since I had a ROG TYTAN cg8890 D.O.A and they took two weeks to say they'd replace it. I would have understood if I had it a week but not returning it the same day. Yay me not a single Asus purchase in 9 years.
Man oh man, just as I was settling in with the right pc gaming brand. After experiencing issues with Gigabyte Mother board I went with Asus Dark Hero X570S MB, and Asus 3090 OC GPU for my gaming rig. Next build might just be MSI brand? Now that I'm saying all this, I just got Asus ROG Zephyrus 16" gaming laptop. Still got time to take it back, cause this sucker gets to hot between the bottom bezel of the monitor to the top of the keyboard. Live and learn. Thanks Jay, keep-up on being 100% dude!!!
With all this going on, I’ll put my pc building on hold.  Get a laptop, and wait for 14th gen later this year.  Had real high hopes for am5…. Sad to say goodbye
thumbs up Jay
I just bought my asus mobo a few hours before this video dropped. I guess I need check it now. Also, I agree that rog is overly expensive, I was thinking that when I've decided to build a new pc, with my current one being a 6 year old rig where Rog stuff was priced more reasonably
I’m glad ur taking a stand on this Jay and j2c crew but honestly this isn’t what I needed to hear cuz I just recently a couple months ago upgraded to an AMD 5800X and got a crosshair mobo so if there is a fault down the line they may not support the RMA. This is the reason I abandoned gigabyte as a whole too. If there is a mobo failure I can’t afford to replace the cpu and mobo again.
Are these issues with asus boards frying cpus only a problem with the X3D cpus?
Watch their PR team panic now 😅
Jay. Can I get one of those 670 boards? xD
Gigabyte has been my go to for motherboards since my Phenom II build. Glad I stuck with them and did not go for ASUS.  Though….the 2060 I have from them is too damn noisy so I won’t be going for any of their GPUs again any time soon.
[insert the interview of Steve jobs on why xerox failed]
This is kinda sad. I just built my first computer using an ASUS motherboard. Granted it is a prime b550 plus. But still. Hopefully these boards aren't a problem.
Had a horrible issue with ASUS myself. Defective DRAM slot on the board, they kept the board for 2 months for “testing”, sent my board back pointing out a small scratch that was not on the board when I sent it and refused to correct/fix it. Stating it is now damaged. Never bought from them again.
Just watched Steve's video. I've been watching ASUS decline for a few years and felt like they stopped caring. This all just highlights that. Also, was waiting the whole video for you to sweep all the motherboards/motherboard boxes off the desk.
I have owned 3 ASROCK boards before I went with ASUS for the 7900x. And, the ASROCK boards have had no issues beside where they located the motherboard USB C connector on the x570 Taichi. Why I went with ASUS on the x670? Well, like JayzTwoCents I decided to go for aesthetics this time around lol. Though I will say this I have had no issues with the ASUS board so far, besides having to update the bios first thing after buying it because of memory training issue. Maybe that is because I have  7900x and not the x3d. Just because I have had no problems doesn't mean ASUS get a free pass on this issue.
Isn't Asrock and Asus the same thing (company/parent company)?
Back when I still had my own business and was building custom PCs, servers, etc., Asus was one of my go-to motherboard companies. It's sad to see their products having become shoddy.   New Egg, Cyberguys, TigerDirect, and XOxide were the places I used to buy from...now they're either out of business or soon will be, hardly carry anything, and just like Radio Shack used to be a go-to place for electronics hobbyists, these places are heading down the tubes. The chain store some buy parts from, the one that YouTubers tout has 75  locations across the U.S. -- they're not up here in Alaska, and some places refuse to ship up here, making things worse.   I guess I should be glad that I retired from the I.T. industry when I did after more than 30 years of working on computers and networks. I saw something about we may soon no longer be able to custom build PCs. It sucks. :(
Asus is the literal epitome of "Beauty is only skin deep" idiom. The one we have in Finland goes like, "Many a cake is beautiful on surface, but there's only crap inside." All their products are meant to look like a million bucks, but the actual quality is *questionable* at best. It's all about looks, which, I admit, are good. But extremely overpriced and poor quality and so on. Will further avoid this brand with all costs. It never was among my favorites due to bad experiences and horror stories in the past. And they seem to be true even today. More than ever, actually.   "You can't make a good cake if you cover a pile of shit with whipped cream!"
They've now erased the Warranty void legalese from the BIOS download page!!
Saw the GN video, then this one. Can surely say that I will not be buying any of their products in the future.
I had problems with my asus x570 motherboard too. i like too tinker offcourse.. but this onstable.. wasn't normal.  the first half year i was searching for a fix and everybody blamed the 5700XT for the bluescreens/restarts, but i noticed the LED-Lightning software Aura shit did'nt remember the settings always.. sometimes it crashed and resetted to the original rainbow puke colors..  i have been fighting with the software/drivers for half a year, even tried different 3th party one's (that stayed stable).. but in the end i just disabled the fancy led colors from the motherboard,  i'd rather have stabilty then rgb puke..  no critical system failures since, this is gonna be my last Asus Branded mobo aswell.. i had that one figured out after half a year of drama.  i should have RMA-ed it since day one of problems.. (in pandemic time ;p)  but a pc that Just Works.. since day one of the build? maybe that is boring too.. One thing i can say.. i got smarter from the Asus ROG x570-E motherboard in problem solving..  still it should just work not only advertise in flashy LED on the motherboard, but it should have worked..  this is off course a Minuscule Problem VS the Socket or CPU burning because of too high voltage (driver controlled).  but i feel yah Jay, luckily there are brands enough to pick from, in the future
So let me get this straight, Jay and Steve, as YouTubers, are fine with NVIDIA charging insane prices, having melting connectors, and overall skrewing the customer with their ridiculous business practices, but when ASUS has a Bios issue that affects people who have gotten a CPU and motherboard combo that nears $1500 dollars, you immediately throw them under the bus? Let me ask you, who, besides YouTubers, goes out and buys these expensive products, and immediately decides "Hmm, better mess around in the BIOS so I can get a 2% increase in performance". Did MSI not just have everyone's private keys get leaked? Did Gigabyte not have exploding power supplies? Did NZXT not have cases that lit your house ablaze? Where is your dropped partnership with NVIDIA? If everyone is so insistent on AMD being more price effective and better for the consumer, then why buy NVIDIA products? I'm sick of yotubers like GN showing off how horrible NVIDIA's practices are, then installing the products like they didn't just watch their own 40 minute long video rant about it? Also, experimental BIOS = EXPERIMENTAL. Don't go out and think that it will be perfect, they are trying to work through the issue. I get what you mean by ASUS response though, but seriously tho, cut them a little slack. I get it, you don't expect a motherboard to blow up once you pump extra volts into it, but some things are not meant to be tinkered with. Think of all the innovation that has come through a brand like ASUS (ex. ROG Ally, Azoth (repairable kb), Flow laptops, TUF Gpu's actually being MSRP, etc.), and to drop them just like that because Steve gets a little grumpy?
Great video, subscribed.
I never had a issue with Asus
Asrock was the brand name for Asus low end boards originally. It was spun off in 2002 ish and they made hella improvements while also providing some very handy unique mobo configurations. I have been buying/using ASrock boards since LGA775 and they've been rock solid for me. I had a g41m-s3 with an ebay q6600 OCed to 4ghz run 24/7 in the texas heat for 7 years straight no issues.  I ended up throwing that setup away a couple years ago because I couldn't even find a use for it anymore.
I didn't have "stop being an Asus fan after 2 decades" on my bingo card for 2023 but here we are.
Man ordered a 670e the day the vid went up so excited to consider not opening tomorrow
ASUS, ANUS, shit comes out of each.
Asus needs to fire their PR guys
the first time i upgrade to 7000 series i use the asus tuf b650m motherboard and i received a dead motherboard :)
Disgusting, and to think i was just about to slam some good money down on a new build, only because my 1st build about 10 yrs ago were mostly Asus parts and never betrayed me
Try and get something replaced from any tech hardware company, as a consumer. It is nightmare for consumers to get heard at all.
it makes me sad because Asus where the last brand I thought could be trusted 😢  in the past owning stuff from Asus was something people could brag about
Just to recall back your memory Asus have been always:  1) rebranding the Asus logo on AMD GPU to Ares, due to favour Nvidia shill.  2) laptop on rog/tuf being half ass effort on cooling in zen series...where using back the Intel design in the frame cover.  3) rog crosshair can't get the bios for support zen 3 5000 series ( understand that is AMD decisions) but later AMD already release agesa that support it...Asus only the late guy come into the party where gigabyte/msi already done.  4) and now this debacle of am5 frying the CPU...
I can't wait for rog ally failure rate😂
7hrs b4 this went out Linus does a review on the new asus hand held 😅
reminder that evga was a pretty big deal a few gens ago and now they basically don't have new stuff.
i'm honestly suprised this whole situation isnt leading up to a class action suit against Asus.  surely there is a case for this if a significant % of people are getting issues that arep otentially destroying multi thousand dollar systems + they are displaying very hostile reactions to their consumers by attempting to trick them into giving up their warranty rights.
Glad you're doing this. Hopefully your actions and other creators actions will force them to improve their products.
Hopefully Asus watches this and it will be a wakeup call to get their shit together.  I really love Asus and have had their mobos in my systems for many years.
I guess i lucked out in buying a gigabyte motherboard instead of the asus one i was looking at.
After seeing Steve's rant, this is quite damning about Asus. It's funny, both you and Steve brought up the ASRock thing. How times have changed. Thanks for the integrity Jay, that's the most important thing in these situations.
Yeah, I'm done with ASUS myself. I've had 4 motherboards for the price of 2.  My original AM1M-A was DOA, and as a 13 year old I had to literally play personal advocate fighting their team to RMA the board. Their team was royally disgusting telling me that cuz I was so young it was likely my fault it was dead. They eventually caved after I explained that it literally was tested by the store I bought it from and they said it was DOA.  My most recent ASUS board was the Tuf Gaming B550 Plus (WiFi). Both of the SOC VRM phases blew up. When I say phases, I mean the entirety of the SOC VRM blew up. Holes in the PCB, in the MOSFETS, under the inductors, with burn and scorch marks riddling the inductors. A white flash from the case, a bang loud enough to give me ringing in my ears, and an instant hard shutdown with no response or warning.  The SOC VRM explosion severally screwed my R5 3600X to the point where 2 DIMMs / channel (I.e. my 4x8GB kit for 32GB of RAM) cant even run 2133 JDEC timings without errors. It can't even run 1800 with JDEC 2133 timings.  Their customer support was useless then, fighting me like "Oh did you try this? Or that? It's probably a power supply issue", after I literally told them I had the store test both parts. The PSU was literally prestine.  Apparently the SOC VRM failed due to a series of internal shorts to power from the MOSFETS on the high side. So if they used any better of a MOSFET, my 3600X probably wouldn't be alive.
It's been several years since I bought an Asus product, be it a motherboard, graphics card, or whatever.  The most recent Asus board I bought was an X370 (now dead), and the most recent Asus graphics card was a GTX 1060 (given to my daughter years ago), both within a few months of their initial release.  So my no longer buying Asus is aligned with my no longer buying Bud Light -- can't stop buying now a thing I already stopped buying years ago.  I have one active Asus board (the X99 system on which I'm currently typing) and zero active Asus graphics cards, and it's going to stay that way.
Graphics card side in my country is exactly the same as  motherboard division in the US, plain garbage and treat (not to mention TRICK) users,resellers, and even distributors, like shiet. I've stopped using them for more than a year now, after more than 10 years of lotalty. I was so proud when I have that long of loyalty (hell anything over 10 years is impressive to me) but now I feel so dumb and embarassed when I mention that. Bye Asus!
I'll just chime in here, I have a 3700x on a Mortar B550. The rear USB ports are completely unreliable. But, going through the motherboard header, it works just fine. I had a header to PCI slot cable/bracket to run it out the back and moved on. Still, making me second guess the MSI brand choice.
My great aunt and uncle have a fridge that has been running since the 1960s without a single issue. Meanwhile my Asus board comes DOA. maaaaan what a time to be alive.
Me with my asrock steel b550m: You are doing great buddy :)
I'm going through my own RMA hell with ASUS, that "might fix the issue" but I will from now on speak louder with my dollars and ASUS . "You're fired"!
I went with ASrock with my new build cos my main PC just keep crashing all the time and now i do belive its my ASUS Mobo.  Fk ASUS
Thank you for your video as well. As I said on Steves video I don't spend tens of thousands of dollars on PC components to be gaslighted by component companies. I am done after these last 3 years of the BS in the PC manufacturing side of things... Got enough of my own problems in life, don't need a computer to be one any more than it already is. So after this system is outdated, I will go back to prebuilts or laptops so I can do internet stuff and that is about it. Hats off to you for shunning them. Much respect!
about time, their boards and the *AUDACITY* of their pricing sucks more than a blackhole with loose morals. All Asus care about - Literally - is MONEY and wringing as much as possible from customers.
It's a shame. ASUS used to be top quality when it came to boards. There software was always *meh* though. My last build is based on AMD and MSI. I originally looked at ASUS, but they're pricing really has become out of control, especially if they can't back it up with quality assurance and support.
I had a Z97X Formula board from Asus, and RMAed it multiple times.  They kept telling me socket pins were bent when they weren't.  Ran me around until the warranty ran out, then essentially told me to eff off.  I got tired of bad boards from ASUS, which has happened several times.  I've been building PCs since the early 1980s.  I know what I'm doing.  Screw ASUS.
I was REALLY REALLY hard on HP and Dell because of their shit "high end" pre-builds, always recommend asus to my customers. But this is kinda up there when it comes to anti-consumer behaviour. So no more asus recommendations and no asus rog ally for me sadly.
I haven't had any issues with my asus b550 f gaming mb. Should I be worried. I just built my first pc last July.
Sooo...about the ROG ally?
I dont make youtube videos but I’ve tested alot of higher end boards as I build enthusiast level pcs locally and I gotta say honestly in my experience MSI boards are just the way to go.
Aaaaaand, I'm done with Asus.
Respect Jay \m/
There's a reason I went with another AM4 board when my mobo bit the dust last week. And there's a reason I'm going to wait a while and see how the ROG Ally does out in the wild.
had my asus tuf board just not take more then 1 stick of ram...
I was having issues with ASUS motherboards. I went with an NZXT on my last build.
That's a shame, I remember when I built my first computer back in 2005, first year of college and I needed something for CAD and the occasional gaming that I did on my free time. I got a Pentium 3 with an Asus motherboard because back then, Asus was synonymous with quality. It was true, thata PC lived up until 2017 when one day, I fired it up and it never POSTed. Now I'm running MSI on the gaming PC and AsRock on the work PC and zero issues whatsoever. So yeah, the "unreliable " brands of yesterday are now the reliable ones and the household name is just shamelessly ripping its costumer base. Hope they get their act together, the more brands we get to choose from, the better for the PC enthusiasts as a whole.
What's sad is the hardware from Asus is usually very good. Its all the other "stuff" that makes Asus the worst of the worst. Bloated Armory Crate is just the beginning, covering up issues, voiding warranty for bios "fix" and the list goes on. Most consumers are willing to forgive issues as long as the company is honest and open about them and willing to make things right.
I love it when Jay and Steve back each other up.
Owned Asus boards for about 15+ years. Always rock solid and reliable, my Z490 TUF board is the same, My water loops 15 months running now and due a rebuild soon as I'm changing to a 4080 from a 3080 and my systems been perfect for 15 months, no issues at all with the Asus board. Very happy with it.
Never had any reason to even try an Asus product because my previous and current system have been Gigabyte MOBO with AMD and MSI grfx have been problem free. If a brands product is reliable stick with it that's my opinion. The only problem I had was memory related on my Ryzen 1700 under XMP but I fixed that by manual setting memory timings and not using XMP
Wow they send you a lot of free crap to try and keep you happy.
Im so upset that I chose asus when i built my 7900x build in december, should have gone to Gigabyte :(
Question: so is there a problem with just the higher end ASUS motherboards or all of them. I ask becasue I am about to build a PC and I decided to go with the ASUS z790-A. Is this a motherboard that has been causing issues as well or is the Z790-A alright to buy. Also I am thinking about putting the Intel Core I9-13900k with this motherboard. PLEASE HELP ME I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO HERE.
Bout to go buy a new motherboard right now! Lol
The memory issues you’re experiencing are probably from the Asus board throwing too much vsoc at it, permanently degrading memory stability.
if asus doesent step up they done
agree with u on how Asrock brand being way better than before. been using 3 of their mobo and only have problem in 1, also RMA process is really fast. definitely my fav now.
That's a shame.  Been using 2 Sabertooth z97 boards for years without issue.  Sad to see them do this to themselves.
HAHA yessss. Everything Asus I have has/is broken. Asus 1080ti strix broken, underclocked vram for a while to make it work back in the day, eventually ran out of slider and it constantly crashed, asus x99 deluxe mobo, 3 broken on delivery, kept the third one cause it booted after 3 or 4 attempts as it was better than the other 2 and couldn't get a refund. Asus notebook within 3 years touchpad didn't work, wifi was dead, cpu was overheating, but would have to take the keyboard off to repaste. Asus z690 tuf mobo, Ethernet crashes the computer randomly. Constant ram issues if I even breathe on one of the dims. Meanwhile, Msi 11 year old gaming laptop, perfect aside from the battery, been in countless backpacks, left on for literal years at a time. Msi gtx970, perfect just outdated. Msi ryzen motherboard, perfect and has bios flashback. Msi ultrabook? Works perfect. Fucking hate asus, and that everyone tries to tell me they're the best.
Wait... suddenly just the game audio go out... that sound familiar! I have had this issue once a couple months ago. I have an Asus strix from z370 era board. Might be just coincident, I has this board for almost 5 years and I believe this is among the first time it happened. I updated the BIOS only once since I have it, I think around end of 2022. My OS audio setup is quite complicated thou, so so many thing can goes wrong.
I like ASUS over any other brand out there ,I do not like MSi and I hate their bios with a passion and as far as any other brand goes Gigabyte is the only other brand I care for at all I will never use ASRock I hate their products more than any other brand I had many problems in the past with them so idk what to use next build if not ASUS or gigabyte !
Glad you have the guts and morality to take this decision ! Also almost all the products these days are garbage from premium cars to TVs etc... It seems the humankind is going down with all its creation
I almost switched from Asrock to Asus with my most recent build, but I decided to stick with what has always worked for me. Glad I did!
The end of Asus. Sucks man, they really went down so far from what they used to be a few years ago even. Well on to gigabyte and asrock I guess.
Meh. I will still stick with ASUS. So shoot me.
The PC system I'm using right now is using a Asus motherboard. In Aug of last year I ended up buying a i7-8700 processor & Asus ROG Strix Z390-E motherboard used locally for $50 dollars total.
Ive been saying Asrock for 3 years now. DU iT!
Bad time to be on AMD and using Asus boards. Intel + Asus has flown under the radar... biggest problem I've seen was memory not being able to run , or the Apex arriving bent as hell
THANK YOU for calling Balls and Strikes in spite of your relationship with them. They have completely abandoned "Support", if you can even call it that. Their public face Juan Jose Guerrero has become a salesman for the company using their format on Facebook. Time and space devoted to bringing everything from power supplies, to mice, keyboards, AIO's, game consoles, routers, fans, coolers etc. etc while abandoning their core business of MOTHERBOARDS. Heavy handed moderation of anything critical is met with hostile plants that are posing as users but they are shills, unmarked moderators, and stealth group that kills anything uncomplimentary to their brand.  They make obtaining SUPPORT near impossible. When you get them to respond,  it is in the form of emails that bring no value or solution to your issues. There seems to be ZERO interest to help you solve your issues. I have thirteen emails from 13 different support agent who has no interest in taking ownership and seeing the problem through. EVERY follow up is from someone different who has not spent a minute to read the previous tickets. How do I know this? After two weeks of emails regarding my motherboard ROG MAXIMUSZ790 EXTREME, next email I receive from someone who is offering solutions for ROG CROSSHAIR VIII DARK HERO??? An AMD board. Never again will I buy another ASUS anything after this $1000 board they can't even replace because it is now discontinued. I guess it was easier to kill the board rather than take care of the customers who bought one.
imagine a motherboard manufacturer just making a product that doesnt suck and can actually stand behind it.
Stop buying new releases people. Stop pre ordering. Give everything time to work out the bugs. And if they still don't fix issues go another brand. Make these big companies make good products again and bot charge a fortune.
yeah i noticed when i got my latest pc i had a power surge i small one it cooked it and sure it enough it was an asus board never again.
Well that definitely saves me some dollars by doing with ASrock.
ASUS TUF cards has been underwhelming since the first cards they launched, their low end was always far to phoned in to be worthwhile I’m from the breakdowns I’ve seen
Asus Beta BIOS/UEFI releases *always* have this disclaimer. Until they're fully vetted and released they're... well, they're... beta releases. It's at your discretion if you want to use an experimental BIOS or a your current one. The former entails you taking a risk and the latter will guarantee warranty support for you.
The only real vote we have is with our dollars.  Good on you for holding them to a better standard.
Kinda sucks to see Linus posting videos on the ROG Ally today...
Asus lost my business when they rootkitted their bloatware.
I really like ASUS products (especially their gaming laptops), but they have screwed up hard this time. I hope that they will rectify and resolve all this issues asap to all of you who had bought their motherboards (or any of their product that suffers from their bad quality control).
Something else no one else has mentioned is how quickly in the RMA process they are wanting claim Customer Induced Damage.   Even if the damage is unrelated to rma, they will not cover the warranty repair for free. They explicitly told me this is their policy via email. Absolutely scummy.
I feel you on the "Have you tried this" line before from a vendor. I told them to come pick up their trial copier that they couldn't even make sure had updated firmware before we started testing it.
It's been five years since I upgraded my builds, but Asus has always been by favorite in Motherboards and G-cards. this sucks to hear.
U should still review the ROG Ally
WOW really shakes my confidence in ASUS, a brand a swore behind. Hope my X570 and B550 builds where before the issues as I have 1 left to assemble.
When an asrock is more stable than Asus you know Asus is fucking up something.
I got an ASUS RoG laptop <2014 g751> and it was a beast, still going strong. I got a brand new Asus Rog S17 Zeph and it nuked itself just weeks after the one year warranty, I no longer recommend them as a company to work with as well.  Their customer service ran me in circles for about a month with me needing fans replaced under warranty for them to argue the date on my purchase invoice....
Micro Center has a open box Z 690 Prime Pro for just over a hundred bucks and is a monster deal and then this video comes out.  All my computers have ASUS motherboards and have never had one fail on me.  Such a conundrum.  I've always had a love for ASROCK so I might have to go for that even if it's more money.
Jeffersonville, Indiana. That's the MB Dis center.
My next built is still far away, but I'm looking at MSI MB for the first time ever for me.
That’s it , I’m going with intel . AMD isn’t worth the headache
Thats why I prefer Gigabyte over asus from the very first day.
Great stuff. So much for my plans of getting a 4070 from asus when the prices start to drop 😂. When evga hit the bucket last year I turned to asus’s hardware as it had a good track record in past from memory. Having used a am4 Strix motherboard for last few years I can honestly say even-though I hadn’t run into any catastrophic problems like the am5 users, the softwares that came with it has been absolute garbage.
"I'm being a little dramatic" Jay You should be dramatic. This is serious!
I've been buying ASUS since the 90s and I too have see a drop in quality. So you've convinced me - they are out.
This is why I will never stick with one brand for anything.
To be honest, Asrock has been killing it for a while now and can easily take Asus's place if they just tried a little harder with aesthetics. Everything else is rock solid from them and currently rolling with a b550 phantom gaming-itx/ax in my AM4 build
I have the z690 hero that had the recall, I've had no issues, but my next board will not be asus.
That closing lol, Asus might not care but we care about people like you Jay, nice job ✌
I subscribed because of your Mega Man X figure in the background and also PC stuff... I guess.
I didn't know it's legal for a company to void their warranty with their own product
Kudos Jay and other lads making channel/content. If someone makes a good product be all means pump the tires. When brands play these kinds of games they should get burned/scolded like this. Get your house in order ASUS!
EVGA stops making GPUs, Asus stops being viable, AMD burning... this is  not my year...  So who should we be looking at now?
Hell yeah! Always said MSI had the better BIOS. Fuck ASUS. Been a long time coming. Never buying another Asus product ever again!! If anyone i know ever buys an Asus product in gonna beat the living shit out of them!! No more asus!! Time to go!! Down forever!!!
I work for a retailer.  There are currently 2 Asus laptop models where I'd say 80% of the ones we sell, come back due to no longer powering on or no display.  I can post the exact model numbers if anyone cares, but I don't recall off the top of my head.  Both are ROG branded gaming laptops.    But it's been the same story for about 3 months now.
Wow! I was not expecting this, way to go Jay. I respect the fact that you decided to publish this video in light of what's been happening with the Ryzen 7000 series chips and Asus motherboards in particular. It is a big deal when a tech channel like yours comes out and talks about their own personal experience and issues on the matter, much appreciated. The timing of all of this is just crazy. I am planning on upgrading to the am5 platform and was thinking about purchasing an Asus motherboard but not anymore. I'm currently rocking a msi b450 tomahawk max since April of 2020 when I built my system and it has been rock solid. I guess I will go with a b650 Tomahawk wifi motherboard for my upgrade. Tnx again for all you guys do, much appreciated.
Not many people on YouTube are as transparent or have the integrity as Jay. Thank you @JayzTwoCents
My second system had a TUF b550m and I cant really say that it was a pleasant experience for me either. Just a couple months after use my system just started to show a weird annomaly where it just wont turn on... at first I thought it was maybe my other components like RAM, CPU, or my PSU, but turns out it was actually the mobo components not being soldered properly... this was a YEAR later after heating it up with a heat gun.
No board is worth 600$ , I don't care if it works or not.  Just like no NVIDIA 4070 card is worth 600$. BS
Thanks JTC for putting this out. I also cannot support a brand that behaves like this - was a fan of the brand but will get back to ASROCK again!
This is why I originally sub'd to Jay... watching out for us. Thanks again!
Can I have all your Asus parts they sent you. Since you will no longer promote them ? Need to finish my build. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Just saying.
I put a lot of money into ROG Strix components and laptops- but lately really losing my appetite for it. On the hunt for the next best thing.
I've been off Asus since about 2016/17 MSI and Aorus are SIGNIFICANTLY better boards for the money.
i lucked out getting the last good gen of asus products in the 2080super and maximus 12 hero, sad to see my favorite brand as far as design just stop caring about the consumers...
Just got my Ryzen 5 cpu today, was planning to get a ASUS motherboard later this month i just changed my choice for a MSI, thank you Jay :)
neat....give it 6 months and jay will be doing Asus reviews/previews again....... :P
What was the first brand that was "fired?"
Exactly my experiences with ASUS. They are also fired by me. My system for over 5500,00 EUR is a disgusting peace of unreliable shit with so many mysterious problems and the whole support is a damn club of brazen and clueless idiots. For me everything what happens there is going in a highly criminal direction. I'll never buy this bullshit crap again... I tried and tried and gave new chances what is also over now. They don't take any word serious when you tell them even in an absolutlely unmistakable way and should have to deal with the consequences. I take it as a teaching and no chances any more. Some other brands will get their chances and my money... ASUS can go down the river and I will celebrate. By the way... I'm not sorry !
So for my current rig, the first mobo I used was an AsRock X570 Phantom Gaming 4. Considered a LOW budget mobo now, it's def not "top of the line". But let me tell you, I went through 2 X570 ROG mobo "upgrades" and 2.5 years later, guess what? That AsRock budget mobo is back in my rig and has been LOYAL to all the bs I put it through, Dual booting, triple booting with an nvme pcie adapter, handles the 7900XTX really well with a 5950x... it just WORKS. When I first got it, I was like "sucks I can't afford anything fancy right now, so this will do". Now, I don't even want to upgrade unless I really have to.
So I've never owned an Asus board, but I currently own 4 ASRock boards and an EVGA X570 DARK in my main rig. All my board's work flawlessly regardless of what I do with them. One ASRock itx board is in a htpc build in my living room for 7 years. I don't even remember what Intel chipset it is. Always works perfectly.  And my EVGA X570 DARK is un-freaking believable. What a wonderful BIOS!  I do hope EVGA keeps making motherboards for AMD. But otherwise I've never had a bad experience with ASRock.
Asus  Made a Microsoft Patch For older Model motherboarrds that have been outdated to updated bios updates = { prior to and  x370 and Some Low End x470`s  = yes a  ? quality update  ? untill i reset pc , new downnload of windows . and a driver roll back with Only the Security patch usb drive insntalled = disabling windows auto update on That , then and only then did the vlt on ram hit 1.58 +  cpu was 100% all the time and i Mean all the time + topped out at crash state @ 1.68 and some even 1.74  on cpu and memory crashes @ 1.60 = just basic overclocks in bios 1.35 set Purposely = over rode setting / would Not recognizeram installed to proper  format  , so windows did indeed try and over write another bios over my motherboard bios and brick boarrd = i got it back up and running on a damaged memory channel = yes , acctually played apex and cod on it for 6 months till system started crashing everywhere and i dismantled board , 2 phases nearly burnt , shows degregation on bottom of caps  close to board , was an Open Box Item , sooooo , ran that board for nearly 5  years , 1rst gen zen 1700x x370 pro prime ,the rest doesnt really matter , the bios is bugged out and the memory channel is gone + one pcie lane , i forgot about that , gpu would Not go into 16x unless i  placed  card into second lower top slot boot . off , back into top 16x slot and reboot , same board i ran a 1050ti to Over 2050 mgrz ,was nice while updates where updated fell off after x470  series  and i feel they are lost in this current gen and need a complete redisign of bios ui  , wouldnt take much but better monitoring , and better conntrols in ui of bios for fine tuning that actually recognize your commands and doesnt allow windows to over ride your settings , and = yes that is a thing as well /microsoft cant keep updates to products to labeling errors in naming changes , actually will bugg out a registry to the point you Have to reset pc wiping drive or replacement which is actually better ,but with pre bloatware installed , doesn`t leave much to the imagination when its about a store or an app instead of an os
Super well said. Honestly I'm a bit disgusted now that my pc I built a month ago has an ROG z790 and psu. If I had to rebuild it now, I'd undoubtedly go with EVGA
Now it is Nvidia’s turn on gouging consumers.
Let’s buy the new ally guys
So, as someone who has usually bought ASUS mobos, what brand should I be buying instead?
"...But you don't care."  i felt that in my soul and i didn't even do anything wrong. @.@
So if not asus or gigabyte where do I go from here?
Do the ASUS motherboards come with ECO modes to limit the CPU voltage overall? Guys listen! Limiting the CPU voltage with ECO mode (if it's available on your new motherboard) could possibly fix the issue (at the cost of serious performance)!
Asus turning itself into the motherboard equivalent of Gigabyte PSUs over here. Explosions and all.
I bought an ASUS mini itx board 2 month ago. Should have gotten the Msi board instead. It’s awful to hear this shady stuff as a consumer
This is sad. I've been building PC's for over 20 years and it's almost always been that ASUS was the highest end motherboard maker out there. Asus needs to get their crap together.
Im using asrock b360m pro 4 since 2017 with my i7 8700k, open power limit still rock solid until today.
About 16 years ago I had a motherboard problem. The shop's first question was: is it an Asus board? That was the time when the electrolit capacitors dried out in Asus boards
I LOVE my ASRock B550m Steel Legend and Taichi 6900 XT! No issues
I think it's time for me to take a break from buying ASUS.  I've bought their motherboards and laptops for a while.
Is this also the case with Z790 or just X670E ?
I agree I"ve already dropped ASUS on my last two builds, using just MSI now... seriously considering ASRock now.
I dont think we should shit on Asus..... Why Cuz for along time they have had great products. And Yes WHO ever Is handling this Mess with AMD chips Needs to be FIRED. They are a Huge company there are tuns of moving parts Plus employees in and out everyday and when you have that you make mistakes. And sometimes the person handling these mistakes need to be fired and called out. I bet if the REAL people at the top of ASUS new how this was all going down and watching these youtubers shit on them they would do something. Its the People at the End of the SHIT stick trying to cover all this up and un fix and stick in there ASS before they get fired lol.
I purchased a 4080 from ASUS, and I like it. But be careful, ASUS. Us consumers watch all sorts of tech channels.
Thats really disheartening. asus has been my go to brand for Mobo's for almost a decade. The fact this is how they are now really sucks.
Wellp, time to keep an eye on the MSI Tomahawk I was looking at alongside the TUF Z670 I got in that Intel 12/13th gen cpu bundle deal Microcenter was doing. Just in case...
I have a B550 e gaming that has been giving so many issues since I bought it and in hindsight I probably shouldn’t have bought it during peak Covid. I want to RMA it but can’t afford to be without my computer right now 😢.
I steer clear of ASUS have for years.
Used to love Asus, but their ecosystem got too big, and they managed too much. They're like Walmart or Amazon now. Just in pc components, and plastering RGB on everything. You'd think that being so big, they'd have resources to make their platform as stable as possible with the buckets.. Err... Barrels of cash, but they got greedy. And on the topic of Asrock, I've never had a bad experience with them. Going back to lga775 days. They were always cheaper, but the price reflected premium features you'd lose. It still worked, though. I'm certain my first board by them was 775, and had both ddr2 and ddr3 support. It lacked robust features, but it was rock solid until I retired it for a newer platform.
Good, they will reap what they have done... Thx for sharing. I went from Sabertooth to Gigabyte, not looking back ollolololool
Damn, that's unfortunate. My past mobos and current mobo is ASUS. I even vouched for them amongst coworkers, but now my eyes have been opened. When I finally upgrade, I'll look elsewhere.
can i have the asus stuff you don't want jay
This is sad to see. All of my builds have had Asus boards in them and I’ve had great luck. My current build is a 9th gen Intel board that’s been overclocking a 9900k for about 4 years. Hopefully they get their stuff together before I need to build another rig
Nothing like an easy public service decision like first getting butt hurt by the brand. 😂😂😂
the fact they make the most expensive mobos too is insane when they have issues like this
Thank you for speaking truth to power!!!
I think you shell make a video that you crash/destroy the Asus board and give them the finger.
i have a lot of audio problems with my asus motherboard :( after sending it in for RMA they told me that "its fine" and i shouldnt worry about it... Like wtf my Audio has been crackling, it has a lot of stutters when the cpu is under load and im 100% sure that it is the motherboard and they refuse to replace it....
This is the predictable result of a conservative-appointed federal judiciary stacked with Federalist Society judges interpreting our laws in favor of the rights of capital over the rights of consumers and labor.  Corporations' sole remaining legal incentive is to provide a return to shareholders by whatever means possible, which has led to a race to the bottom in QC, R&D, and customer support, the results of which are becoming evident not just in Asus' products but across the spectrum of industry.  Products have been continually getting shittier in quality for the last couple of decades while simultaneously getting more expensive in price, and meanwhile inflation-adjusted wages have been stagnant since the 1970s, because Americans are so thoroughly and passively brainwashed by culture war bullshit that they can't even see they've been voting against their own self-interest for fifty years running.
Amazon will also send you used shit.
Hey jay have you tried using intel xmp ram sticks instead of docp sticks
And I just bought a TUF RTX 3070 ti 😢
I've been having issues with my ASUS motherboard (rog crosshair viii formula) causes random unrecoverable freezes, the only thing I haven't changed is the motherboard,  also had issues with my last 2 motherboards which were also ASUS,  I still have old motherboards in working order from the 90's still work no issues, I still have running a p3 slot cpu pc in a Gigabyte motherboard my retro pc.  I use to be a ASUS fan boy but now I'm not sure what to go for next.
thank you, just now purchase a GIGABYTE X670E AORUS Master for my new gamming rig
This is just total BS Asus, I just built a 7800x3d system paired with a Asus x670E-e wifi mobo I updated my Bios to the 1303 (where i also thought was bs i had to check a disclaimer to void my warranty to update to a driver that supported my cpu)  and i havnt had any personal issues, never seen my volts go above 1.1v with Hwinfo64, but this is definitely the last time ill be using any of their products. I brought Asus because like Jay "benefit of the doubt" as they have been reliable pc's for my wifes & i's last few builds. If only all this had come out on a couple of weeks earlier i to would have  went with one of the other competitors.
Well. Ive come to trust your experienced judgement in a lot of things. When I got my build I was satisfied with my Gigabyte board and also not but that was pedantically because of RGB Fusion 2.0 lol. But that program has been fixed for my board. I kinda wanted an Asus board and felt them to be a teustowrthy quality product.  I'm now a year and half into my PC's life with zero issue. Going to continue being happy with my choice of going with Gigabtye. Will question Asus in the future and definitely look for reviews of product.
When the alternatives are a hacked MSi, Gigashit and Assrock. I think ill stick with Asus. They'll get their shit together. The others have been shit for decades.
I am just now, as I type, hearing about this. I have NEVER had any issues with dealing with ASUS and I've been buying their stuff for over a decade. Using the TUFF 68800XT now. So if MSI is off the table, NVIDIA is off the table for their scumbagyness, now ASUS joins that list...Who else do we have to buy parts from? EVGA makes awesome stuff, but they don't make all the parts I need and do they even make AMD GPUs? Even though I remember they cut ties with NVIDIA. I know how to build a PC, but I don't know how to make the circuit boards to just make my own parts too.
Hey Asus, yer poo is smelling really bad right about now. So per the Wiki, ASRock was the OEM side of Asus, looks like all the talent went with ASRock.
This is really disturbing.  I built a PC for a co-worker a few weeks ago.  I went Asus because I trusted Asus.  And, to be fair, the current PC is running like a champ.  But I am really distressed at Asus going low quality.  It seems a typical move companies do where they trade on their former good reputation and go cheap.  Some suits will make big bonuses in the short term and, when it all falls apart, they walk away wealthy.  They show no interest in maintaining the quality the brand had been known for.  I really hope the PC I built continues to work.  I am not sure I will choose Asus again in the future (probably not).
I think this is a good occasion to help support the channel by picking up something from the merch store :)  Not because this is going to hurt the channel at this point, but if J2C is going to take the high road, that deserves some additional.
Nice. I have used ASRock for very long time in many builds over the years and yea, they've always been stable. Aesthetics wise not so hot in the past years but have come a long way in recent years in terms of physical appearance.
Hmm..interesting. I bought an "open box" Crosshair X670E Extreme from Newegg that came to me in a white box.
Holy..... ASUS, I hope you pay attention. You are the board partner that I was going to after EVGA. Maybe not now.... I can spend my $$$ elsewhere.
Between this video and Steve's video, I had no idea ASRock was supposed to be so bad.  I've had my ASRock Extreme4 X99 since the 5820k launched (2014) and it's what I'm using right now.  I've never had a single issue. 🤷 Thank you for calling out Asus though, I'll steer clear until they decide to treat their customers better.
Actually was planning a mini ITX build to have a backpack ready PC for LAN parties,  with an ASUS board, then lately stuff happened and I also found myself leaning towards Asrock, a brand where I have had plenty of issues with on my B450 Steel Legend back then. Hearing from you that Asrock definetly made improvements in quality, says enough for me.  You are the voice of reason in this, and you are handicapping yourself by doing this video but you have to stand behind a brand that is there for the consumers.  Right now Asus just feels like a moneygrab machine, and that's a shame. In my current rig I use a X570 Crosshair VIII Hero and that board been solid so far but Asus as brand has been so damaged I'm actually considering replacing this mobo with a Gigabyte AORUS.
Looking at that massive pile of hardware, and realizing that's all recent hardware, from one vendor, just blows my mind. I'm sure as a tech YTer you just get used to it. I also suspect that once you have 2 or 3 motherboards, the marginal value of another mobo to the channel is almost zero.
Damn and I just bought an ASUS B550 Prime Plus gaming, reviews are good so hopefully it’s not a turd , paired with a Ryzen 5700x
Yeah!  F Asus
Just had to deal with ASUS as well, had to send in a Z690 Formula as an RMA. Took them over a month to ship, and three separate times they claimed they'd give me a 24-48 hour update and they never would. They didn't even replace the exact motherboard, and wanted to swap with a board completely in a different price point with significantly less features. Eventually the motherboard just showed up without warning or update
I was initally sad my new AMD system could only get a msi board. It has its issues (you cant reboot it or it locks up in memory testing) but other than that it works fine. I guess I dodged a bullet there. sort of.  My work pc had an asus PROArt AMD board, but when we added more than 2 sticks of memory the whole thing became unstable. Turned out one of the sockets was bad, so we had to switch to a gaming board. It works but I'm now paranoid about updating it.
Reviewers are part of the problem. They glorifies OOB AUTO OC benchmark score hence board vendors are competing for that useless praise.
Well I’ll put it this way. ASUS has not let me down yet. I’m running a Z790 Hero board. Still rock solid.
Covid era has screwed us over for the next decade or more.
Yeah every single AM4 ASrock board I've ever had or used has failed. So I was kind of leery about recommending it to a friend an ASrock z790 riptide for his build. Come to find out that the board is flawless. And seeing that ASrock looks like they fixed their AM5 boards, is giving me a little more hope for them again.
I've had so many weird issues with this build and spent so many hours troubleshooting, and then all this BIOS nonsense started and it all just made sense.   I have the Crosshair X670E Hero with a 7950X.   Windows 11 still sucks, but I can stop blaming Microsoft now.
Has anyone noticed similar issues on Intel's platform? My wife has a 13600K on a Strix Z790-F and she's been having random crashing with XMP and AI Overclock enabled. Turning them off seems to fix the issue. Temperatures haven't seemed to be a problem at all, but I noticed the VCORE requesting 1.51 volts and actually getting 1.49 right before it crashed at least one of the times.  And friend of mine just built his very first system on a 13600K with the Strix Z690-F at my recommendation and is having the exact same issue.   It only happens in some CPU-intensive gaming scenarios and it's not a hard crash with a BSOD, It's a soft lock with a gray screen, or color bars, and an unresponsive keyboard and mouse, where the computer needs to be manually rebooted.  Seems reasonable to me that if ASUS is pushing it too hard on AMD's platforms, it might be a culture thing and bleed over into their Intel BIOS as well.
Hey @JayzTwoCents if your personal rig uses Corsair sticks, try swapping them out for Kingston or some other "reputable" name. Im pretty sure youll find the issue fixes itself.
Asus sounds like Apple.
I hate what the pc building community and ecosystem has become
Nice stand your ground video…. Running the 670e Asus Prime Pro board with an 7700 myself and so far no issues.
Good thing amazon doesn't play that and I can return my asus for the gigabyte 670e-a with my 7800x. I'm having no posting issues and this isn't my first rodeo . First pc of 10ishbthat hasn't worked.
Just got the Apex.... mine was new, and I always inspect for good condition. Admittedly this is my first Asus board. I usually use MSI, and the boards boot fast. the slow boot of the ASUS board took me back a bit... and the fact it ramps my pump to 100. So far it has been fine though.
OK so we all now don't buy an Asus POS motherboard for AM5. Be good if you Jay could do a review on the better AM5 motherboards.
On the day ASUS drops the Ally officially making me consider staying away for that device now.
Wow, GG Asus.
well, i was thinking of switch boards because I am very much due for a new CPU and will need to update the motherboard anyway. looks like I will be not going asus for once
Good. Good riddance.
looking at my two 40 series Asus GPUs a little nervously at the moment
I've helped 2 friends with build problems lately. We couldn't figure out the issues, troubleshooting everything. They had ASUS mobos... Swapped them for ASRock and now it's smooth sailing
Well ... that might explain all my fked up AMD builds in the last year lol i used only ASUS for them. Now im on AORUS (Gigabyte) with a 13700k and have no probs xD
Bought the $1k X670E Crosshair Extreme and I’m still within the return period so I might just do that and get the MSI godlike or something similar.
I'm having issues with rog asus strix 670E-A and 7800x . My system want boot often but works fine when it does . It took me 5 hours to get it working the other day . I'm just replacing the parts . This isn't my first build, I know how to trouble shoot but something is going on .
I used to buy Asus as the default good brand but I’ve had a couple issues with my Laptop and trying to get them to fix it (5 months old at the time Flow x13) was like trying to Connie a toddler to share. Now I will be buying asrock, had rock solid performance with the couple Asrock boards I’ve put in a couple builds now. Disappointed as all of my personal stuff is still Asus and I don’t know if i trust them anymore.   PS: Funniest thing ever, as soon as the video stopped it auto played a Jayztwocents review of an Asus board.
Big step, too bad
I recently bought an Asus Prime Z690-A after *years* of avoiding Asus like the plague. Why? My Asus EEE Pad Transformer: failed in week-- touch pad stopped responding. Asus Zenbook: charging port broke, monitor would only work at certain angles: (it was a friend's laptop, not sure how long they had it).  There were a few other things I don't remember at this point that had made me averse to ever touching an Asus product again, but then I was gifted a Nexus 7, and then bought myself a Nexus Player--though i had no clue at the time it was made by Asus.  Nexus 7: Screen randomly cracked, and touch functionality failed completely. Nexus Player:  constant hang ups and stupid amount of lag *just* by being on the home screen. Found out later they were Asus, and was like... ah yes--blacklisted. Then my friend bought an asus motherboard and seemed like smooth sailing, then ROG became a thing and things seemed to be fine, so I went in to give it a whirl. Memory stability issues right out of the gate-- and now this stuff?
Thank you, I am building a new system right now and have been saving for an ASUS board . But in light of this I will not be supporting that brand so I now will be  buying an MSI board , possibly an ASRock even .
When I built my pc together with a friend back in November, I got two things from Asus: A 144 FPS monitor with Nvidia G-synch, the  ASUS 27" XG27UQR ROG Strix monitor, aswell as an  AM4 motherboard, the Asus Prime X570-P on which im running an Ryzen 7 5800X3D. So far it all works fine but good lord I hope I never get problems with it. Must admit, I didn't know ASUS seemed to be this anti-consumer now.. glad I did not get more from them.
Great now im already staying away from MSI specifically their aios now ASUS 💀 with their motherboards.
Well, what a disappointment... I had high regards towards ASUS for always being top of the line when it came to quality, but I guess Jay hit the nail when he said that ASUS is too high up in their horse to care anymore, they used to be the "cool" guys... not anymore! 😒  Their greed is blinding them badly, and they don't realize it yet.
And you just know how detailed the bios change logs are... :|
You’re requesting free shit bro shut up
I am going to join to this boycott to. I am not going to buy this ASUS equipment ..........that I couldn't afford in the first place
Its honestly getting hard to know...who to go with. Ive been planning my new build and was thinking of going mainly with ROG stuff but now I'm seriously reconsidering, but dont know what the alternative is. Ive heard "dont go with"....Asrock, MSI, now Asus. Did Gigabyte become the "go with them" choice? Cuz Ive heard horror stories about them too, mostly with support. I just dunno anymore, lol.
wow, i've been having random issues with my asus tuf x570 board since i got it. just randomly locking up with orange light on the board. chaged my ram to gskill neo thinking maybe i needed amd ram instead of xmp, but no diff
Yeah I’m done with asus. They lost my business
AMD 5950X and the MSI meg x570 ace and not an issue one
This is what happens when the executives are so divorced from the product and their own customers that they just don't care if they are selling trash or using shady practices to avoid responsibility.  They are just out for themselves, probably trying to do anything they can to maximise profit margins and reduce costs so they can get their bonuses.  I can imagine being a fly on the wall at one of their corporate meetings, when they listen to the lawyers and accountants but not the designers or customer relations. When they quickly read through a synopsis of a report because they are too important to spend time learning what is actually going on.  And I bet they do it all on macbooks.
Too late for me. I already am running on an ASUS board, B650 TUF WIFI. So I need to be locked in for the rest of this board's life. I cannot afford to kick this board to the side and grab the next best thing.
I have been using Asrock for 6+ years without any issues.
My asus strix e x670e died after 4 months of normal usage just happy it didnt kill my 7900x
This is crazy cause I have a ROG b450 f gaming and I’ve had it since a 2700x, now I’m on a 5800x3d and I don’t have a problem. But when I upgraded to a 7900xt I was seeing a lot of frame drops , but that could be due to the fact my monitor was gsync. This is still wild though can’t believe republic of gamers has fell to this level.
asus has been going downhill for years. Started my pc journey back in 2014, loved asus for how they overbuilt their components. The Maximus hero IV was one BEEFY board when it came to power delivery. Now? Bare essentials and buggy software/hardware.
Thanks… guess I’ll be taking them off my preferred vendor list.  Next upgrade…no Asus… Dam, your an influencer. I guess they don’t know what that word means.
Well Damn! whelp that killed that. I was just at Best Buy today looking at ASUS products. On to the next I guess. Thanks for that update Jay we appreciate your through input. Keep up the good work standing by the consumer.
I love my Asrock boards these days.  They have come a long way.  You get a solid feature set for your money, and the bios' have been solid.  Warning though, if something goes wrong with the board, support is still dogshit though.
I think it's adorable that YouTube influences are just finding-out Asus mobos are often hinky... Anyone who has been building for real for a long time knows this, like Jay says their gfx cards are great, but like sooo many manufacturers now that: There is a lot of stuff they suck at EG: BIOS, But I guess it could be worse, anyone with an MSI rn.....
Just to be clear, is it true ASUS boards are actually having trouble with 6000 mhz or higher ram?
i care nothing for aesthetics so Asus have not been on my radar ever (didn't think they made quality stuff, just gimmicky) and I'm glad to have avoided that mess. Always just stuck with MSI, gigabyte, evga where I could and haven't been disappointed
And to think I just built a PC with the ROG Strix Z790-E. Now I'm worried about stability issues and other potential problems.
good on you dude
Is asus rog laptops bad too?
what was the other brand you fired?
Are Asus under new leadership or something?
I had failure with a 670x HERO and am in the process of RMA with ASUS....This is awful
Thank you Jay for speaking for the consumer when they try to silence us! Will be avoiding asus from now on.
I use the Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus with 7800x3D. "Newest Beta Bios"  Sometimes while gaming my screen go dark and my Discord Disconnects? First i thought it was my GPU "7900 XTX" But now iam worried its the bord behaving bad :S
Ive always had issues with asus bioses and software, heck even their pcie wifi card i bought back in the day simply doesn't work on newer platforms. Why no idea.
Asus didn't get the message of white motherboard privilege.
I recently built a 7700X system with an Asus TUF X670e motherboard. Other than it taking forever to boot (AMD issue) my WiFi and LAN drivers need to be reinstalled once a week. Plus the system isn't stable with the RAM clocked to its advertised speed. It has been frustrating and disappointing to say the least.
Very sad to see.  Asus used to be the gold standard on AMD and Intel platforms for other manufacturers to live up to.  What the heck happened?  Currently running MSI on my current build but the previous AM4 (and AM3 before that)  I had was an ASUS.  I applaud Jay and this video I just hate the reason it was necessary
Ohh i love asrock, since i use these board in family and friends pcs its such a relif i can tell you compared to aorus (gigabyte) and tuf (asus) boards to not deal with weird issues all the time. And with all 3000-series chiplett ryzens replaced since they die in a weird way that make it look like you have gpu issuse (artefacts and screen flickering to cpu-usage) i hope it stays that quiet for a long while.  also use a asrock board for a server i host all gameserver on and with a minimalst windows on it it runs now for over a year without a restart, bluescreen or something else.
does this affect their AM4 motherboards too or just the AM5?
I've had nothing but good experiences with ASRock myself.  Have one of their boards in my current main system and have an older system (like DDR3 old) still running solid with one.
Maybe this explains my mic issues. I've tried 2 different headsets and for some reason my microphone will randomly quit working. It's still recognized in the windows input list, but zero activity will register unless I disable and re-enable the input. I assumed it was a windows issue that persisted from 10 to 11, as I also updated windows in an effort to fix it. My rig is an intel setup but I have the ROG Strix Z690-A Wifi D4.
Agree 100%, like Kodak, Nokia, Black Berry, ASUS RIP
I have a tuf gaming x570-plus that had ram stability issues, I couldn't overclock it, so I had to leave it on the xmp profile only, but once in a while without notice(months apart), the system would just not post and the diagnose ram led would light up. I would have to clear CMOS, and would only boot up again with one memory module installed sometimes (I had 4x8gb) and reconfigure everything all over again(and asus motherboard BIOSs suck so much...). It appeared it got more stable with BIOS updates, but one day it happened again, and nothing would make it revive as before... The motherboard turns on, rgb lights up and stays stuck with the orange ram led on... tried different ram and nothing. I bought a msi tomahawk b550 to replace it, zero issues, rock solid for 2 years now. I have the asus motherboard being used as decoration on a shelve 🤷🏻‍♂️ asus motherboard for me, never again unless something changes.
keen to see more from msi and asrock. is gigabyte worth looking at again?
ASUS motherboards are the clickbait of motherboards. They look so sexy and amazing, however, what lies underneath is a steamy pile of poo. Alot of people should switch to ASRock, they have really turned things around and you get so much from their highend boards for way less cost. MSI and Gigabyte are also great options. Hope ASUS looses alot of money from this, as the consumer will win at the end. Id say the only down side with ASRock is their bios, however, however that really only affects you if you're into extreme overclock, which 99% of PC consumers are not.
Bravo Jay!!!  Its difficult to give up on such a well respected brand.  So disappointed, I've been a big fan of Asus as long as I can remember...  Let them self destruct
I've been using ASRock parts since 2004, never had problems. And if there was some problem, it was mostly just software that got fixed over time.
aww man... after the bs MSI pulled I made the choice to no longer support them. Then EVGA pulled out of the GPU market just as I was gearing up to go from Pascal to Ada Lovelace. I Chose ASUS as I lost confidence in Gigabyte with their exploding power supplies. So much corpo greed at a time where people are beginning to vote with their wallets.
I fired ASUS last year. Everyone should!
id like to see that shit company, try to  void the warranties in the eu like that, they gonna get into trouble for it... telling consumers to use that bios on cs, to fix an issue that can wreck the cpu and board .. and then voiding the warranty in the same process ? that aint gonna fly with eu regulations
I gave up on Asus since 2010 moved away from all their products. Random issues  with Asus. Haven't had a single issue since I've moved to using ASRock.
My X670E might be the last asus product for me. Unless they make a total 180 and admit they really screwed up. Won't hold my breath on that one.
Thanks for your video i was literally about buying a Asus motherboard, i can now look for a alternative thanks Jay&Team 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I recently bought a Z-790 Plus WiFi D4. its been fine so far, but this has opened my eyes for what I might be in for in the longer term  :(
I’ve seen 2 sides of ASUS videos today: RoG Ally & their lack of quality control. Got a bad feeling for the Ally
I would have Frankensteined the two white ones haha
'we have an MSI board now its okay' inb4 he hears about msi's recent driver keys hack
My AMD build is still working. Can confirm!
I'm done with asus! +1
Thanks Jay!
After watching the GN video today, I will NEVER buy an ASUS product again. Screw that! They are literally scamming people who are worried about their components into voiding their warranty & then, the customer service response on top of that... NEVER!
I just ordered a 7800X3D and an Asus X670E TUF board like a week ago, waiting on the postage... Then found out about all this drama, pretty worried about my purchase now :(
Now I regret buying the ASUS ROGLC 240 AIO.
I have only really ever bought ASUS MOBOs and now I wont support them any longer.
Assus
WOW! I have been an ASUS only fanboy  since 2000. This is rally depressing to watch. Well my next build will not be an ASUS MB. Sad man
RMA shellgame lol
lol I just bought one of these on account of the ProArt being one of the very few Ryzen 7000 boards with 8x/8x pci slots. ngl I've had troubles, the RAM test at boot is the most absurdly long thing I've ever witnessed, and it's a huge mess.
I think this generation, it's mostly asus but also AMD at fault. Lots of people have been having horrible stability with AM5 on non-ASUS boards, including gigabyte boards that blew up chips. Either way, I would stay away from ASUS and also AMD products. AMD is historically known for having poor stability.
Bought a 3070ti and 1 dp and 1 hdmi decided to crap out about 7mo in.. asus points the finger to Amazon and Amazon pointing the finger at asus so I'm screwed as far as that goes.. kudos Jay for standing up for the lack of quality control
Wonder what they're support system will be like when the Asus ROG Ally comes out. Not gonna buy it since I love my Deck.
My last 2 builds were all asus, last one my of my 8 mem slots were dead, and they wouldn't rma it because I installed a waterblock. The Board came with a bad memory slot. I learned to test everything before adding blocks. Waste of money.
Welp! I was going to buy a Asus  gaming laptop for my birthday this weekend, but going to look for at other brands
I like the smooth voice over edit at 1:14 I wonder what was originally said.
While I recognize some of the recent issues with ASUS, I personally have never come across any issues, have had more than helpful support, and things have been super stable! I understand not everyone will have the same experience but I have no reasons to hate. Gigabyte has had plenty of issues recently as well, and things get better over time! That being said, I’ve built with MSI and ASrock boards and have also had no problems with support or products! Will see what the future holds. ASUS certainly could have handled things better but it also could have been far worse.
AsRock has been a solid MOBO for my 2nd gen Ryzen setup and it's going to be something I strongly consider for my next build.
I love how LTT posts a video telling everyone to go buy an ROG Ally before they sell out, when JTC and GN post videos telling you to stay away from ASUS. XD I love LTT content, but damn. They really have some bad timing with video releases.
I couldn't get my ASUS Z790 Strix to boot. Lmao. I returned it and went with a board I didn't really want to use - the MSI Z790 Edge. ASUS is a joke.
asus amoury has been absolutely dog shxt for years but they never tried to fix it lmao
I was looking at that exact board you got twice there, for my new rig I'm building, just wasn't keen on dropping 1300 for a board on Amazon, thats only msrp at like 800.  Only reason I was holding out.  Just don't know what to use now. LOL.
I haven't used Asus motherboards in over a decade for all sorts of reasons. ASRock continues to earn my business
"it takes 7 boards to get a good one from ASUS!" that burn will be burning for a while 🤣
Can confirm: Bought a Strix 2080ti pre covid and it came brand new out of the box with broken RGB. lights never worked. I gamed with it anyway and it already died. Got barely 4 or 5 years out of it and it just randomly crapped out. Oh and I had to buy replacement fans because the ones it came with wobbled and crapped out too. I have been very happy with my MSI motherboard, my new GPU will be MSI instead of Asus for sure now.
Sounds like my AMD issue with stuff not working and i have a MSI motherboard that i didnt have with Intel makes me want to jump off of a Freaking bridge but cant afford to fix it as i feel like banging my head against the wall
I feel this too. I have been an Asus guy for years, just automatically buying their motherboards for every build. But the last board I had was ok, but it had bugs and the ASUS software just crashed all the time when I tried to install it. So this time I got a Gigabyte motherboard, and it's been rock solid.
I'm kinda sweating rn...with my 7900x3d and the 1410 beta bios version i updated to....
EVGA, please come save us!
Asus has gone downhill so fast
Interesting that you mention nice hardware and crappy software because I've been thinking the same thing about this Asus Flow laptop ever since I bought it
Well crap.  I just built a new system with a Asus Strix B450 board. Guess i was lucky in getting a " Older" board. I guess next board with be MSI.
ordered an Asus ryujin aio and the 2 fans it came with didn't work at all and the fan controller shorted and broke both the fans and with this coming out a day after I'm def gonna avoid Asus from now on
in fact i still using asrock z370 gaming k6 with 9900k until today, it can run 5.2ghz 1.365v
Hmmmm this is interesting. I've gone through 3 sets of RAM on my dad's computer that I built him that uses an ASUS ITX board. The RAM kept dying and made me think I was the problem. I'm so damn tired of business not doing the right thing and making a quality product. If you would just make a quality product you'd dominant the market, but ZERO C-suite people have a spine anymore.
Yikes! I might have to reconsider what brands to use next time I build a computer. I've actually been using Intel/ASUS combo for over 20 years and never had any issues. This does seem concerning though.
The only thing that is going to light a fire under ASUS' ass is one or more class action lawsuits for LOTS of money.
Well... I didn't think ASUS was going to do an MSI... They really effed up this time.
so buyer beware for an open $700 board. mb
I gave up on Asus ten years ago, always some problems. Since then I only use Gigabyte for motherboards. I've built over 50 PCs for people and with Asus there's always something, m2 doesn't work, expo or xmp, a lot of problems in the bios, etc. I've been trying to explain to people for years that it's just one big marketing and I hope someone will understand now. Until now I always had Intel and now I took the 7900xd for a change to be a bit on AMD which works perfectly for now but on the Gigabyte (Aorus) board, expo and everything else works perfectly.
I just bought a ASUS motherboard a couple months ago, I feel dirty and polluted. Will never touch the brand name ever again.
So it sound like a Newegg Fiasco
well this sucks...  ive used asus only for my motherboards for decades due to them being bullet proof.  So seeing this video and the z690 box on your desk which is the same mb i just built in my new rig spring of 2022 has me nervous now.  Bad enough i no longer have evga video cards as a option going forward , now i cant use asus...  my next build i have no idea who i will end up going with when ive used asus and evga for sooooo many years... its stressing
It must suck to get all your computer equipment for free and have some quality issues that need to be RMA'd.  New products are why people watch your videos and when you do a build or find an issue during the build that is what everyone out here want to see before purchasing a product.  When you say you wont work with a company and their "fired"  then I guess we as the consumer will never know if they bring a decent product to market because you threw in the towel.  Myself, I would want to get as much of that product your having issues with so you can determine if they have fixed their quality control issues or it was a one off.  By doing what feels good at the moment hurts the people out here who want to see real live stuff happen even when something is bad so we can make our determination if we want to take a chance.  Every build is not perfect and that's what makes this channel so special.
I went through 2 Z790-E Gaming Asus motherboards because them coming with messed up pins. the first one I got all the way home and found them and had to take it back to Micro Center the second one was pulled off the shelf at micro center took up to the check out where they let me check the pins right there in front of them and wouldn't you know it had messed up pins, so they went back and brought up 3 boxes of the same motherboard and they all were just fine but the fact that they had two asus mother boards on the shelf with messed up pins was shocking and now I'm having a lot of Q code problems with the one I ended up with.
I think everyone is over reacting. ASUS realizes there is a problem, and QUICKLY released a new bios which is obviously untested. A disclaimer is somewhat warranted until testing is finished. Also, the problem isn't with the over volting, the problem exists only when the motherboard hangs on post and issues a 01 code, where the resistor arrays don't get set properly because the board hung. Almost nobody will have an issue, and those that do, leave their boards in a "hang" state for too long which causes the CPU burn out.
Sounds like AMD is not the way to go.
First Gigabyte, next ASUS, wonder who will be next.
I thought it was just me. My first mobo was Asus. And lemme tell you it was terrible. Wouldn’t boot with certain ram, XMP didn’t work even after I updated the bios. Then another series of problems. Returned it and switched to MSI
The decline has been overall, not just Asus.  Burning Nvidia GPUs, PSUs blowing up... remember the motherboards with the backwards part on it that made it fry?  I used to use EVGA boards, then Asus boards but when the i9 came out, I think it was the VRMs that were overheating on most the X299 motherboards, causing throttling and some people reported that Asrock's Taichi XE wasn't, so I crossed my fingers and bought one and built a nice little gamer.  Never had Asrock before, but it works great, rock solid.  Almost 2 years ago now, I built a new gamer/content machine, with a 5950x... What motherboard.  I always avoided MSI...  But that's the way I went (X570 MEG ACE).  Very happy with it.  The world is up-side-down.  I have no Asus computer.  My gaming laptop is Gigabyte, and my rigs are Asrock and MSI.
Ya know if you go back to 2021, I left a comment on one of your videos trying to warn everyone of the really big issue I had with my first buys from Asus.. I bought a Z490E and x2 Crosshair Z490, the 490E BT 3.0 header pulled loose from the board (had to be superglued, and now I've had to do that to every Asus board I've had and worked with) Fan headers from their shipping bag were snapped clean off, one crosshair was completely bricked, and the other crosshair had dead fan headers ( I had to repair), bad ram slots and a janky m.2 port.. And everyone basically told me to shut up, which is also what Asus did after taking it to the BBB they called me (Don't know how they got my number!!??) I talked to a guy and by the end of it I told him don't worry worry about it, I'll eat the cost and you guys lose a customer ( I had been with EVGA up to this point, and still would be if i could afford their boards)  Now let's fast forward to 2 months ago.. I'm building my first  High-Endish ITX build and the only board that really made sense from cost and me always liking to go with something proven (Z490, bit older but has proven itself to me) I bought a ROG Z490I and guess what? It's hormonal as fuck, and has gone through a set of dominator RGB, Trident and 2 sets of LPX before I got a set of RAM to work with it without have major errors (BTW the other ram kits are living happily in other systems right now because I had to sell them to make up what I lost) Was it stupid for me to go Asus? Yes, but I do what I can because I'm not made of money not even close, actually most of my parts are used most of the time.. Does having this board in my new system make me nervous. FUCK YES.. will i possibly lose my $250 investment in this board? More than likely. I tried telling you guys this stuff almost 3 years ago and nobody wanted to listen, and yeah I find it kind of funny now especially when Asus tried to act as if this was my fault (I know build PC's for people because I'm known for clean builds, reliability and not breaking shit) So no Asus it wasn't me.. it was YOU.  When people try and bring things to attention don't suddenly think they are just bitching or they did something wrong and they are just trying to push it off on the company, yes that happens but it's not always the case.  And Jay if you see this.. Thanks for all the good advice over the past 6 years I've been watching you, and yes what you do and say really matters.. The Fractal Celsius+ you reviewed years ago has been my favorite  for AIO's so much so I've now bought and had over 5-6 of them and other parts over the years. it took balls do to what you just did and i thank you for that and honesty is something I take serious in the business.  Asus.. I really hope you get what's coming to you. You can't treat people this way and expect it to last long.. And anyone from EVGA that happens to see this.. please start making FTW "Cheaper" Boards again so folks like myself can stop buying shit parts from these ass clowns.. I can't afford your $700+ dark boards, but you start making sub $300 boards again and I'll do things your girlfriend won't =)  Watch your ass everyone, and don't put up with with shit like this.. They can't continue if we don't buy their junk boards. -Love Neptune
*sigh* except for the niche motherboard manufacturer EVGA, all the mainstream others have really thrown it down the gutter with bad practices, ASUS, Gigabyte, ASRock, MSI all have had issues, mainly how the issues were handled.  It has ruined the overall experience of a custom build for the end user.   It doesn't help that we're being price gouged too...   I think we need to slow down technology releases a bit since by the time a platform gets issues ironed out the next gen is already there for pre-order. 🙄
WoW how bad have you gotten when " Dude i got an Asrock board" is somehow a good thing - RIP ASUS
MSI ain't great either. They recently screwed all non-North America customers out of warranty repairs when their water cooled motherboard got all corroded.
I was a loyal Asus builder for a very long time from GTX 480 to GTX 980 TI with matching high end mobos. Then I stopped being an IT Support manager and moved to being an account manager that involved a lot of travel so got myself an Asus Zephyrus GU502GV. It's a POS. The keyboard randomly became unresponsive and I finally linked it to the RGB implementation. If I disable it, its fine. If it's on in armory crate, the keyboard will not work and requires a hard reset which then triggers windows to lock me out for a few hours. Their support don't care and wanted to charge me to diag it. I went from a Asus fanboy spending thousands of $$ every system upgrade to avoid at all costs. It sucks when a company you trust f$@cks you over. Republic of gamers my a$$.
Good lord, my Asus G15 JUST developed an audio crackling issue. No idea how to fix it but it happens with or without headphones, with latest windows update, and latest audio drivers.
i'm somewhat overdue for a new build and I was wanting to use a ASUS board because of how much I remember you praising their stuff a few years ago...but glad i'm hearing this info now before I willy-nilly went for one in a few months or something!
At least my motherboard from 2019 holds strong.
I was planning on building a complete ASUS gaming pc then this all happened.
Wow. I feel lucky I've never had a problem with my ASUSTek PRIME Z590-P then.
i wonder if there are similar issues with their B550 boards and the 5800X3D....
The only Asus product I've ever had was an X570 Tuf board I got when I upgraded to Ryzen 5000, and it was really lackluster. I upgraded to it from literally the cheapest X470 board that was on the market before B450 even launched, thinking that a higher end board from a more trusted had to be a worthwhile upgrade for me. I should have done more research though, as the Asus board was more than twice as expensive and lacked in a lot of ways. Maybe the hardware quality was actually better, but my old board never gave me any issues on that front. It had far fewer USB ports (which actually was pretty frustrating for me), no front panel type C header, noticeably worse fan control, and the front panel audio stopped working on it. I decided after getting that board that Asus was just relying on their hrand name to sell their products and that it probably wasn't worth my time to bother with them in the future, and this video really just serves to confirm that.
I bet they intentionally want to destroy your Hardware. So they should be Sued for Fraud.
Crazy I remember when I built my first pc back in 2014 I was so bummed that I couldn’t afford an ROG motherboard. Now I only go with MSI, Gigabyte, and ASRock now. Crazy because I was going to buy an Asus motherboard for my last AM4 board.
i have been using asrock MB's in my last 2 builds and have have 0 issues! both amd and its great! one is my main gaming pc and the other is my wifes pc. both used everyday
Yeah I'll be honest, ASUS is really hit or miss with me and my dad. My dad built his system with an ASUS TUF x470 board paired with a ryzen 9 3900x. He was on an early bios and wanted to gain some memory stability. So I instructed him to update his bios with their specific tool that they provide. I think its called EZflash, dont remember and dont care. I had him get the correct bios and we began the flashing process (through windows. They had a tool that would work that way ig.) Mid way through the patch, the whole system locked up, and never came back after hours of waiting. Eventually, we killed the system, and it would never post again. My dad had to spend another 120 bucks or more on a new Asrock x570 gaming board because that board decided to fail. In fairness to Asrock, me and my dad both use Asrock boards now. They have been WAY more reliable than expected. I will likely buy an asrock board when I move off of my 9900k.   What bothers me is that previous gen products, like my ROG Maximus IV board from 2011, still works just fine and is still being used to this day, zero issues. The chip in that board is an i7-3770k.   I'm just at a loss for what has been happening. I do hope they come back with super reliable products in the future as they do make cool looking stuff.
This may sound odd on this video and I don't want to trash Linus too much, but LTT seems too big at this point. When you compare what we are getting from LTT compared to what we get from Steve & Jay they are just starting to feel too out of touch with the regular PC gamer.
Right when the Ally comes out.
Not even negotiations after that? Wow! That's ultra impressive
It's been a few years since I built a PC. Ive installed seven mobos in my life, two of which were replacements for failed boards.. both Asus. I swore in 2008 I'd never buy Asus again but I stopped buying all of it around the same time sooo yea.. take that Asus. 😅
Been an MSI guy forever.  Thought I would finally try ASUS this year on a basement / backup rig.  (Had a few parts laying around.)  So I went with an ASUS board for the first time, since I heard so many good things from... everywhere.  So I didn't expect any hiccups.  But, the onboard wifi just wouldn't be detected.  Simple fix, but something I don't expect in the ROG Strix line.
Was heavily considering a tuf gaming motherboard, now I'm going evga 100%.  Fuck those dirt bags.  I'm not supporting fire hazards, and neither should you.
In Brasil the Asus Prime b450m is the most repaired MOBO.
Is ASUS' laptop division just as bad, was looking into a Vivobook recently.
Asus used to be cheap shit now they are expensive shit
I will NEVER buy Asus for anything
So...what brand do we go with now? Every MSI board I've had always dies right at or around the warranty ending, and Gigabyte seems to be hit and miss now?
It should be criminal for them to release a patch, regardless if it's a beta, but using it suddenly voids your warranty... Like we're not talking about some 3rd party modification. We're talking about something released directly from the company to its own users...
This whole situation and how they seem to be dealing with it has me wanting to look to other MB makers now I just need to figure out who else is good.
ASUS poor quality control!! I received my Z790 with blue plastic in between the components that are not supposed to be taken apart. It was about to be a nightmare trying to RMA it when i finally decided to use the hair on my peaches and just start taking stuff apart and hoping not to make things worse. In the end i got the plastic out and it worked out fine....for now.
Asus used to be the brand that was the best...from socket 7 to a Slot 1 to whatever I've always been Asus til X58 then I went Gigabyte for shits and giggles, been with that brand since as any recent Asus build has been shaky at best. What the Frick happened Asus?:
Longest breakup video
It isn't just the motherboards they are screwing up.  I ended up buying an Asus RTX 4090 and it has such horrible coil whine at completely stock clocks.  I guess I've been spoiled by all of the quality EVGA product I've had in the past.  I think this is the nail in the coffin for any future Asus builds for me.
honestly glad I saw this, my last few builds have run asus mbs and I planned on continuing that at the end of this year but I'll likely look at other brands to see what everyone else is offering
Wow am I glad I got out of the PC game.
I mean the Hardcoded "MALWARE" in the Bios should give enough of Red Flags to anyone smart enough.
I was still planning on going forward with an Asus board after X3d-gate... But this is the final nail in the coffin.
I had similar problems you had with the asus motherboard  Constant BSOD crashes, etc.
its a dark day when asus cant be relied on
Zotac is another company that has apparently tried to repair their brand.  Apparently the 4090 zotac is amazing.
No, ive been having issues with my Asus 6750 xt too.
Message recu, fort et clair .... je repasse chez msi  Merci à tous pour le boulot😉
Has MSI fixed their slimy scalping practices with their second hand retail subsidiaries? If so I’ll go back to MSI but at this point it’s ASRock and Gigabyte for me on motherboards. Wish EVGA didn’t pull out of the GPU market, I’d buy their GPU’s damn near exclusively at this point
My crosshair x670e hero also have strange issue. When I'm using my speakers, the sound suddenly swap to headphones and all the led on the board shut down. Sometimes it comes back to the speakers and then back to the headphones but led don't light up again until I restart the PC . I also had crashes using expo so I'm not using it anymore. I might return the board and go for another brand. Sad that that the only brand I have been using since I started building pc 15 years ago will not be the one I use going forward...
Oh my.  I just built a system with a B650E-F motherboard.  I hope it dosen't have problems.
I went through this sort of thing with MSI over a decade ago. Thier CS rep was literally yelling at me and telling me I had voided my warranty by doing what another CS rep had said to do over the phone to try and fix the mobo before sending it to them. The fix didn't work, they told me to send it in, then I got it sent back still non-functional. Back then I had a land-line and a recording setup and I just sent all of it, the mobo, the recordings, and emails on to the FTC.
I really feel like I dodged a bullet with my new build. I almost bought the Hero board.
Family of 5 we have 8 computers all running rog boards must higher end ones well no more switching to gigabyte or msi so good job already stopped buying there monitors years ago because of there crap support was hoping the boards would stay good
I'm glad I'm only just looking at upgrading. If not, well I was an Asus fan and they would have already had my money.
My one, as rock was quick and solid.
I learned a fact about Asus from an electronic repair man... their products keeps them in business.
More like ASSus
I bought into the newest gen cpu and got an asrock board, I thought I had chose a lesser board by not going with like a Tuf board but I guess I made the right choice
Yep, this earned you a sub. I appreciate the honesty.
I've got a high end X570 Asus ROG board with my 3900x and so far the only issue it's had is the damn software that tries to control all the extra goodies included for features you can play with. I think it's old enough now that it's not affected by the issues your talking about and other than the issues mentioned it's been stable and solid. Before I found the one app that was locking it up it had gotten pretty frustrating but back to good again and it hasn't locked up or anything in a while since fixed.
Imagine a normal person buy a new mobo with bend pins... (owners fault)
I stopped buying ASUS when they lost my laptop mid RMA for 6 months. They refused to do anything except blame UPS when it was delivered...and I had phone calls from asus saying they recieved it and they just asked for the XGM with it (even tho it was purchased separately) Six months arguing with corporate support. They finally sent me a refurbished replacement, and then 2 months after my OG laptop suddenly showed up at my door in a box without any padding just bonked around in shipping in a big empty box. How...
My Hell started when i bought the TUF B550 Board while the Z77 Ivy Bridge One was Rock Solid. A Massive difference from then. They have gone straight to Shit and give exactly 0% of Fuks about Consumers.
Maybe a blessing in disguise. My build is mostly ROG, but is a few years old. I have a hard time trying other brands but will now explore others
I am an ASUS loyalist. All my non-enterprise stuff is ASUS.   There isn’t a good manufacture other than the big prebuilt OEMs which have great, and efficient RMA. It’s the entire reason you don’t build machines in the business environment, bc you can’t just replace these components. But Dell and HP, will send a tech out same day to replace devices or a component of device.  ASUS doesn’t care about me, or you, that’s why you never order from Newegg. And put everything together IMMEDIATELY when you get the parts from Amazon.   It sucks you had this experience, but to say any other company in this space is immune is not true.   RMA sucks. On a car. A Peloton bike. Or a computer component manufacturer.   Some of the best laptop innovations comes from ASUS at CES.   But I like that you stick with your convictions on this bc ultimately you are sticking up for the little guys.
A-SUS is now SUS so what now? Which mobo maker is the best now?
Jay starts off with I'm not disappointed, I'm mad. I'd exclusively used ASUS MB products for YEARS! probably built 14 machines in total for family members etc. I'll no longer be using this manufacturer.
I've been locked on ASUS motherboards for sooo long now.....sad to see this happening.  Hopefully they realize what's going on before it's too late....
tbh I have never had problems with asus. I've bought 3 motherboards in 3 years their customer support is alright when I rma a part for a friend it's hard to find another solid brand to use if evga makes standard mid end motherboards I would go with them
They slowly became gigabyte
'Asus sucks, so I moved to MSI' I understand why but MSI ain't better 😅
My asus board keeps crashing the wifi built-in. I literally have to windows repair at least 3 times a day. Plus the random blue screen once a month. Everything was fine up until the bios was updated. Whatever they put in that update has royally f**k my stuff. Next time I'll stay with MSI
Well *frick*, I just ordered a Strix board.....
Hummm My A4 board has given me zero issues....strix rog x570-e...A shame if they are slipping.
Independent reviewers & Tech Tubers are the voice of a new generation. Stepping up & calling out the companies trying to steamroll customers & release downgraded products that result in downgraded experiences.
Asus's laptop after sales/pre-sales service is just as bad as their other parts........they broke my shit and called it CID (customer induced damage) while i had an ADP AND ITW on a $2k laptop  High time somone points out on their shit
I just got an Asus mother board because of microcenter deal. Can’t return it anymore. What the hell do I do? First and last time customer
Prices are way up, QA/QC is way down. Plus Newegg went down the shitter. It's a lousy time to be into PCs. It seems like all those job cuts in the industry came primarily from quality control. I've never seen it this bad before.
Wow lolz!  I was wary of the uptick in Asus trouble reviews even going back to 2022. That's why I went Gigabyte on my build and my system has been rock solid since the first boot. Infact I haven't had a single crash since and going on a year.
Thanks for clearing up a few things for me. I've thinking about a new build recently for my slightly aging 9900k setup. Been an Asus user since the P5N-SLI 775 LGA. Looks like I'm going somewhere else.🥲
OOOOO Dad Jay coming out swinging..   if this doesnt prove Jay isnt a shill for any brand then i dont know what he else he could do to prove it.
no drama llama , click bait #2
A thousand times yes. Particularly - ASUS ROG.
My ASUS board with my 5600X was blue screening in games about a year after purchase. I tried a bunch of stuff but it kept happening. I thought it was the cpu so I got a 5800x on sale and the same issue occured within minutes. Went and bought an MSI, never had an issue since.
Kinda worried about my Prime Z790-A wifi now. I don't think I've had any issues but I simply might not have noticed them or thought they were something else. Is it specific boards or Asus products in general now?
And I thought MSI was king in the ongoing prevention of technical and customer support! 😳
So, what other motherboard brands do you recomend that have a decent warranty?
Republic Of Grifters... Sad to see Asus acting this way.
I had a Asrock Z77 Extreem 4 and that board was rock solid. I'm now using a Asus B550 Tuff Gaming, and I get odd USB disconnects and reconnects. Tried everything I could think of, Bios updates, driver updates, fresh install, even changed PSU. still get the USB disconnect/reconnect bloop.  Just dont know.
I swore off asus in the early 2000’s after ridiculous rma turn times and overall inferior products.  Everytime since then, when I try and use an Asus product,  it bites me.
Nailed it Jay, so glad I went Gigabyte for my new build after using Asus for years.
All my RMA products are always asus never not a problem with them always disappointed, wasting money, and time.
Just built my first system in almost 10 years with a Z690 TUF board. I hope I won’t have any cataclysmic issues with it soon.
Mad props Jay. I'm not a high end builder and as such I've typically not used their boards. That being said, I use their routers and Zenfone as I've had great luck with them. But this situation really makes me question buying from them in the future.
i dropped them 2 years ago, i used to love'em but i had a very bad RMA experience. The best customer experience I've ever had was with Sapphire. if I'm ever getting an AMD card it's Always Sapphire. I know Asus does a lot more but my point is good support is everything
I'am here with my mind getting just one line. "If Asus to it to Jayz, what they do with all us peasants?" I mean, you are a big market space for brands, and we are just folks that buy time to time a single motherboard in some years to use as personal computer or almost that, the average consumer has less importance to a brand than some of they "influencers" (i know you not like this word, as i do) soo is kinda terrible to though about how they deal with people, with storage management and all those stuff arround, really bad
Damn screw Asus I swear. I dodged such a bullet waiting to decide between Intel and Amd for my upgrade. I had Asus in mind for AMD and MSI for Intel. Thankfully I choose the latter.
Built my first PC back in Jan with a Strix B-650 board. Had to buy a whole new one 2 months later...
❤
More like A-sus.
That's sad to hear being an ASUS fan myself. Give the terrible experience many have had, I have to shout out that I just had a fantastic RMA experience with Rode microphones, where they not only replaced the defective product but sent extra as well
Doesn't the Mega Man build have a ROG 4090?  This sucks cause I finally bought Asus because of all the praise the they have been getting the past year. Mainly went for them because the the X670E-A silver/white board.
Thank you jay for voicing the frustration from the little people and taking action from the evil corporations
ASUS sucks
So happy my MSI board borked on a BIOS update brand new out of the box. Microcenter only had ASUS in stock so I got that. Its been fine so far minus some minor stuff. But siiiiiiiiiiick they're scumbags. Wish MSI could make a board that can take a update.
Of course i literally JUST bought an asus rog scar 17 laptop... this is a fucked up situation
It's just better when Jay stops being a Shill and drops some Honesty.
Just saved me nearly $2,000. Was going to put together a new build this year and was planning on using an ASUS motherboard and GPU. Didn't know about any of this! I don't care if their GPUs are still decent, I'm not giving them a cent.  I really wish EVGA was still in the game. One of the only companies that has some business ethics.
I left asus 5 years ago because the price do not match and components are basic and standard component, and cheap too. Rog is a SCAM, and anything related asus gaming. I am very happy that my decision is correct.  THOSE WHO DARE will buy the board 😂
Around 2002 I sent an Asus Motherboard in for RMA,never got the motherboard back and was out a few hundred bucks.They have always been anti consumer
I really wish people wouldn't refer to us as "consumer."  It's pretty degrading.
Hey jay I have a ASUS TUF B650 and a ryzen 7950X I've not done any of the bios updates should I look at replacing the mobo?  been running ASUS since 2007.
And this is why I am loyal to this channel. Feels like a big bro watching out for me
I had that experience where one of their gaming laptops and the mother boards went dead and I did not did anything. I charged it and used it a little and power it off when I am finished with it. When I turned it back on it did not turn on, I did the "plug in the charger and turn in it on because I forgot to turn it off," routine. Nothing, I carried it to a computer agency because where I live there is no Asus store or main supplier on the island. They said that motherboard is not working. So I will have to send it back to the store, but it came from the UK which was a gift from my aunt.  So it sucks.
Bro,  my setup is almost entirely ASUS.
Wow… I bought a laptop from asus that was pretty respectable as far as specs, power and use ability and I was goin to build a Asus computer but now I’m rethinking it. Honestly, this is no way for a big computer hardware company to behave. Download the program so it does not fry your CPU but now we are not liable for nothing cause we don’t give a $h!t just update your bios so we are not liable. That’s cold blooded murder with an excuse.
releasing a bios to fix the problem they created, THAT ALSO VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY AND MAY NOT EVEN FIX THE PROBLEM!   Asus used to be the overbuilt reliable brand, now theyre just clown shoes.
Guess I have to switch brand now . Everything I have is asus sad.
Man what a shame... I still have X570 Wifi for my 5800x but it makes me sad to see them dropping so low. I don't care for MSI Motherboards, and always felt Asus had a strong reliable product.. not so much now it seems....
Asus only will wake up just like Asrock in the pass, when consumer all reject one brand, then they will focus more on their problems
Thanks!
So glad someone can keep these brands accountable. Keep up the great work guys.
Danggg. I just got a new rog board  2 months ago.  Now I have to blow it up 😢
I once had Two separate Asus motherboards die on me in the span of 3 months. I said I would never buy another Asus motherboard for the rest of my life. It has been Gigabyte only ever since.
This is the kinda thing that makes me like my $100 msi b450 that much more. Sure msi isnt perfect, but at least their bios isnt bricking systems and voiding warranties.
oh your comment about Newegg talking known bad RMAs and reselling them. I got an Amazon certified refurbished Razer Basilisk wireless mouse and the damn thing had a defective battery in it! However silverlining, Amazon refunded it and let me keep it, so I just ordered a replacment battery, but still I shouldn't have had to go through that hassle. Damn the Corpos
nice take a stand
Yes.. Also got problems problems with ASUS last years. My Crosshair 6 hero and Zenith Extreme both had problems with thermal sencors - sometimes it showed CPU temperature -50 and stopped cooler. Meanwhile CPU was trottling and overheat. Nice :/  Also my GPU (RTX2080ti Strix OC) got very noisy coil whine after 2 years (I could hear it other room, through concrete wall). Official service center told me that they did diagnistics, cleaned it and changed thermal grease, but it was no any problems with graphics card.. Yeah, sure :/ I sent it to unofficial service. They replaced some coils but didn't remove noise completely (as they said). So, they apologized, that they can not fix problem completely (actually could, but repair price will be too high) and didn't charge money from me. And they found no new thermal grease inside and but found some dust - graphics card was not cleaned, like official service said.  But, when I tested graphics card at home I found that coil whine was almost gone. Few minutes of undervolting removed it completely. Nice ASUS. Official service center did nothing. Unofficial repaired it for free.
Not sure if I can share as well as let ASUS know. Product quality is one issue, here in SG.  Unfornuately aftersales is horrible cuz in SG, most call centers including service center are manned by several outsource vendors.  Thus I doubt ASUS review or handle any complaints from customer since it is usually routed to the vendors/system integrators.  Generally I will avoid ASUS products like laptop, router as well as phones.  I lost count how many times I need to send products like router for servicing in the past mainly due to no internet issues.  DIY parts TBH in SG usually people will avoid is not because of product quality but rather high price.  Usually budget builds people will use either Gigabyte or ASrock motherboards than ASUS.  Point here users like myself face other issues with ASUS than just product quality.  I won't forget feedback to "ASUS" for any issue whether BIOS or Drivers, the vendor will always give very standard reply.  Example driver compatiblity issue which I had on my ASUS Maximus XI Hero motherboard.  Not sure why the Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology Driver Software when I switch to Intel RST/RAID, Windows  setup will inform me that it is not compatible.  When I email "ASUS" they told me to install previous Windows version than update it.  What kind of reply is this? Since "ASUS" didn't acknowledge my feedback, this issue I had.  I can only use AHCI mode than the driver will install but even so the Intel RST software will not install  as it will freeze during installation process.  If my this rig failed on me proably I will switch to brands like Gigabyte which have better aftersales support.  Especially Gigaybte drivers as well as BIOS are more robust than ASUS in my opinion.  PS ASUS you can outsource to vendors but my question is do anyone listen to customer complaints/feedbacks?  And also please review your team handling BIOS as well as driver, if other manufacturer can do way better  job why isn't ASUS doing the same?
yeah i bought an asus mobo for my 13900k build and probably will go back to MSI after my experiences so far
good ole aye-zeuce, lol this only happens to fanboys guys so dont worry.
I am going to stay away from ASUS products. I am staying with MSI from now on. It sad to see how from ASUS has fallen.
Also ... remember ... the peaple that made asus great ... left asus to start asrock ... and now asrock has built a good reputation & asus has continuously had there's fall further & further down the crapper.
This has me wondering now if some of the random stability issues Ive encountered lately with my 570 board are related....
Used ASUS exclusively for a good... 15 years or so.   Last ASUS build was my Haswell build.   Dumped them with my Zen 2 build a few years back, and it looks like I won't be returning to them in my next build, or anytime soon thereafter.  Saw this coming from a mile away.
Asus has garbage products since z97. Asrock make better products  than asus...  ever
We love unbiased honesty.   Thanks for keeping it real, Jay.
This is so disappointing. Asus has been a great brand for years. It's sad to see them go downhill. Hopefully they can learn and improve.
That sucks. But they suck even more. "fixing" and the potential "fix" kills your stuff and they go "ooooppps! your fault... even if we said we did it!" is total BS. Fan of the brand, have never had an issue so far. But in the coming years when a new build is a possibility, then we'll see if they still get my money.
I may not have the most current, which with all the issues I've heard and seen with the latest Gen AMD Asus boards I'm happy. Also I do agree Asus used to be great at looks and function, now all they are good at is the makeup, to make what crap they make look good to the eyes.  Sadly I can't say MSI is the best either as I have had to many of their PSU fail with brown outs, and one just out right would stop functioning at 1/3 the wattage, it was 5 years old so sadly warranty on those PSU lapsed as it was before the new 10 year ones.
Jay is full of negativity lately, can’t stand him anymore.
Asus was my go to for years, until a fan fell off a GPU literally and going down the rabbithole on forums and hearing so much bullshit about asus from others.
Thanks for the info Jay, was planning on buying a z790-e asus board for a 13th gen build. and now I think I'll just skip the 500$ price tag and stick with a different brand.
Jay Motherboard support is not everything, have you tried using their mouse like Chakram, software is as bad as Gigabyte's RGB software. It's not even funny, these mice are damn expensive.
Just bought an ITX motherboard from ASUS now seeing this video. Wtf should I get now ? 😂🤷‍♂️
I have the Asus Crosshair x670e Extreme. Never have I regretted a purchase more. All kinds of random issues. I've had to reinstall windows 3 times now. I'm so damn mad. I dont know that there is even anything I can do, aside from never buying an asus product ever again.
I am impressed.
i had a asus tuf b450 board and my mic wouldnt work at all, external audio was messed up unless connected via USB and, xmp? the amd version for 5000 series wouldnt work... i then got a asus strix b450 gaming f 2 or something and i had constant stutters which is odd but mainly on games that required more cpu. Swapped to intel and msi its been super smooth and dont need to use my blue yeti as the only source of audio now
I had a 12th gen asus board... i needed to reboot it constantly. They wouldnt replace it because i couldnt explain how to reproduce the problem, its been purely random bullshit All the same parts in an Gigabyte board, at the same speeds, rock solid the only difference, the board. i said then ill never use asus again... sad, since its all i used since Pentium days. and prior.
Asus before Bud light /Asus after a Bud light.
I was a major fan of ASUS since 2006 when I bought my first laptop for school with an amazing warranty and features. ASUS wasn't in stores yet in the US but I gave it a shot and loved what they had, started recommending and buying Asus ever since my current rig (Crosshair VIII Impact, 3070)... it's a shame to see this company fall. Hopefully they act like a 10 year old and learn a lesson.
"hey, keep you STUFF" looooooooool!! G Rating bender
Speaking of condescending, Razer is worse than Asus in this regard. They need to be taught a lesson just the same.
I'm off to buy MSI now after almost purchasing an ASUS motherboard, thankyou for keeping it real Jay!
Thanks for being an advocate for our hobby. Hopefully ASUS will get their act together.
Everyone go put in a support ticket to asus saying you saw Jayz video and complain about voiding our own warranties out of fear of our computer catching on fire due to their shitty hardware. Maybe if they get 50 thousand tickets they'll decide to change
Thats a great way to shoot yourself in the foot as a company. Yeah we send out units that people have returned in the past to influencers whom we expect to rep our brand...what could go wrong.
Honestly my last board was a strix and it wasn't that great whatsoever. Back to Gigabyte and really like it. 7700X and pro AX
I had an ASUS Z790 fail last November, but was lucky with their Z690 I ended up using with a 12th gen.
Hate to confirm it, however yes, horrible customer service from ASUS. Too bad because I really liked my 2013 ROG laptop.
Finally others are seeing Asus for how they really are.  Had many bad experiences with them over many years.
Someone needed to do this, and its sad that it came to this. But, it needed to be done, and thank you Jay for putting ASUS in their place. Wonder if Linus and other channels will do the same/similar, hope they do.
Gotta say, super happy I invested in a good rig last year, all previous gen. I'm going to skip everything, cpus, gpus, ram, motherboards, this generation. It's nuts!
I was like nice, its a good thing i went with godlike instead of extreme and went to with 3090 suprim instead of rog strix . but then i realizes i got the asus thor psu -_____-
Asus F$%cked me with warranty on two products and since then I've not purchased nor recommended Asus to anyone, this is NOT a new thing from Asus!
im curios to know if this is all of asus motherboards because im upgrading my pc with the rog strix b550-f and r9 5900x and i already have the motherboard so i just wanna know before its to late and fries a 340$ cpu
Their thinking probably was to save money by doing this and that. The problem is doing what they have will sink their pc division as they focus on other portfolios. Seems pretty intentional but people like us will refuse to even look at anything Asus branded product because of our experience in the pc space. Like their handheld that just launched, probably will have problems and who knows if they'll be there to support it.
Asus....Really?
Jay, Phil,or Nick what are your opinions on the ROG Ally? Do you have any faith in it?
Interesting on ROG ALLY day...lol
What are some trustworthy alternate brands? I’m not huge into PC gaming but I definitely know of Asus. Honestly if I didn’t see this video I probably would’ve kept blindly buying their products.
Between nVidia, AMD and a number of the AIB’s…it’s really hard to want to be a PC Gamer anymore.  Quality is near non-existent and pricing is completely f’ed. Seems like it’d be so easy for just ONE to step up and gain hearts and minds…yet none of them to care enough or are capable of it.
I feel sorry for JJ that  Has 2 work there
This is why im so sad about evga leaving the gpu market. They always stood behind there product and there customer service was excellent.
I was actually thinking of upgrading my monitor to a newer ASUS display recently, but after their recent behaviour i'd rather send some money to their competitors ngl
Asus has been putting out great boards for many years. Now it’s “you’re fired”. Every multi national company has recalls.
Still waiting for them to get sued over the Armoury Crate (malware) enabled by default on their boards.  Hell I'd have tried to start one myself if I wasn't broke and knew more than elementary law stuff.  Been with ASUS for most of my IT career; switched over to Gigabyte for one gen and it blew up 3 of my Intel CPU's (damaged IMC, probably Intel's fault too), but after upgrading my system to Zen 2 and having to deal with an entire YEAR of them not improving the memory compatibility with my older RAM despite numerous contacts with support, forcing an unnecessary purchase of new RAM, which now STILL HAS ISSUES AFTER UPGRADING TO 4 DIMM's (and on Zen 3)... and their arrogant price hikes to cost far more than ANY other brand, and all the other issues people are experiencing.. just, no.  It's over.  By comparison: MSI, when I used one of their boards, had a RAM compatibility issue.  I sent a support ticket in, a week later they sent me a beta BIOS that fixed it.  ASUS is utterly shameful.  Haven't tried ASRock, honestly scared to, but it's either them or MSI now.  EVGA aint really in the cards anymore..
I've been an Asus fan since forever..  I even bought their Asus ROG phone 2 that I use to this very day.  The reason is because its newer versions do not come with a dock.  THIS a very tell tale sign that the company has been heading in the wrong direction.
I have an Asus prime x470.... should I ditch it for another board??
Really no good viable option for mortherboards left tho, I dont like gigabrick, since i have experienced the most mobo failures with them. Asrock lies aobut their products and changes VRM doing a boards life cycle without letting anyone know @ + sends special samples to reviewers. And now this whole ordeal with Asus as well.  LIKE who to pick in europe where EVGA is either to expensive or not an option in the first place. i gues i have MSI to go to, but i donno if they are good these days.
I was considering upgrading my cpu and mobo this year and had been looking at ASUS. Now I think I'm going to go with MSI.
My experience was with Gigabyte.  But I was able to refund my board without a problem through amazon. But the real PITA is being AMD, who is not being very nice about RMA'ing my CPU, a 3wks old 7800X3D, which blew up thanks to Gigabyte's 1st BIOS not working either.  I'm told the F5c finally works, but by then my board and CPU were blown and burned out.  I ended I substituted my 650I for the ASRock X670E Steel Legend... Cheapest board I could find that supports flashing the bios without booting the PC.
My asrock is liquid...
The X670E Hero (699.99) was my first Asus motherboard, I'm feeling pretty disheartened right now.
For years we have used nothing but Asus boards for our customer builds. For the last couple years we have had more trouble than we had the entire 15 years prior. I chocked it up to the pandemic and a collection of isolated incidents. Now I'm not so sure. I guess for now we will be using other boards.
Not entirely related, but would like to add my 2 cents as well: Asus has been... somewhat "special" towards their windows-using customers lately. Their proprietary app, armoury crate & aura, is intrusive beyond ANYTHING I'd seen before - and that's including razer and even nvidia side apps. It comes pre-installed on asus laptops and is HEAVILY promoted to install instead of drivers for any ROG product. You got a keyboard and wanna download the drvivers? Don't touch their site and just let windows do it. Otherwise look through the download links carefully before installing their software which would most likely still get downloaded before you find the drivers page.  It's a suite of host programs designed to regulate your RGB and (supposedly) all the Asus products. And by "a suite" I mean you'll see a NUMBER of services, processes and registry markers installed with it. The RGB one(Aura) actually affects your performance a bit, strongarming quite a lot of cpu for some reason - even if you have 0 asus RGB products in your system at the time.  Want to uninstall it? Google "armoury crate uninstall". They have a FAQ on the official site telling you "well you COULD try to uninstall it manually, but honestly just find the support page(we won't provide a link here, on the same support site) and download the Armoury Crate & Aura UNINSTALLER TOOL." Which is a glorified name for a series of command line scripts that clean up your system of ALL the bloat this one program pumps into it. And trust me: that cmd.exe is gonna RUN for a bit until it's all gone.
To be fair, memory stability issues are a standard feature of AMD CPUs so you can't blame Anus (yes intentionally spelled it like that) for that one.
I was asus lover ages ago... shifted to gigabytes and has no regrets about this change LOL
Darn. I just replaced some other brand parts that I was having difficulty with and went all ASUS. All working good for now.
Gigabyte motherboards reign supreme!
Hey Jay, there is black motherboard from MSI called MSI MPG X670E CARBON WIFI for your personal rig.
Glad I didn’t pull the trigger on parts for my new build. Going to removing the ASUS bits and finding something else.
guess it's time to fire them from my PC builds too I have used an Asus board in my pc since 2011 or so,i have had my fair share of just dealing with the issues that Asus had, I just built a new pc for a friend and used a gigabyte board and I can say it is so much better in stability than mine.   its time to talk with our wallets guys!
I hope people stop buying from them.
I mean, I have an email chain where they tried to replace my new Crosshair VIII Extreme motherboard with a used Crosshair VIII Impact.  I love the aesthetic of my build, but I've had zero confidence for a while.  I hate to say it, but my next build almost certainly won't be ROG.
So I got a MB back from RMA, where only communication was note with returned board stating they could not duplicate issues however we updated bios/frameware/software for optimal performance
About time for ASUS to fall off from the premium brand grace.
You know what you should do is, send all the Asus product you have in your inventory back to them collect!
I'll say the same thing here since you and Steve clearly chose to overlook the fact that version 1303 BIOS is out for this specific board. It was shown in the screenshots in Steve's video. I have the same X670E HERO board and I'm running the same  6000 MHz CL30 kit that pretty much all reviewers got. I have a 7900X3D that was overvolted before the update but now runs at 1.24v for the SoC after applying the firmware update. v1303 isn't beta BTW and doesn't void your warranty. Why the both of you keep highlighting the beta BIOS is beyond me
If they don't care about our happiness, neither will we care about their company.
O U T S T A N D I N G   Asus 109k likes we are the people buying your stuff stop trying to scam us
Whoa, I hope I dodged a bullet.  I almost bought a z790-e but chose the gigabyte aorus master instead.  I hope I made the right decision, :-\
Here I am, watching on my 2nd ASUS laptop, with an ASUS 6900xt card in my desktop system, and now very sad about my choices.   I've had good experiences with their products so far, but it sounds like I've been very lucky.
I found that running certain Asus garbage software has caused a lot of issues with my system thus showing me that their software digs into the Windows install creating several conflicts (Armoury Crate is the worst and Cooler Master's mouse/ keyboard software takes a close second in digging into the system and crashing it at random points). So far my MSI MAG and ASRock Steel Legend builds have been running 24/7 for months straight without issue.
nothing but problems with my new asus rog laptop...usb, audio dropouts, audio crackling, and weird stuttering issues on power, really sad that im considering intel and apple...
I have a 7800x3d and an asus x670e-a mobo and im running bios 1303. So far 0 instability and i can’t find any evidence of voltage being too high.
4:27 SO BASICALLY, what you are saying is that ASUS is 100% becoming Apple by saying SCREW YOU! GIVE US YOUR MONEY!! WE DONT CARE ABOUT YOU
Thank you for calling out these companies and making big decisions swiftly about who you are willing to work with.   I am so glad i used a Aorus board instead of the highly recommended TUF board by multiple youtubers and reviewers.
I have bought 2 asus vivobook oleds. They were both DOA. I won’t be buying from them again.
ASUS still wants to charge people more for their products (especially at the mid-range and high end), but they don't want to go the extra mile for customer service or product support anymore. At that point, what reason do you have to give them extra money for their overpriced crap? You can have the same (or better) experience with another brand for less money. ASUS seems to be coasting on their name alone these days, but that only lasts for so long.
I really wish another company would step up and replace ASUS as the "top tier" board.  I recently built a 13700K system and went with the ASUS Strix Z790-E because it was one of the only boards that had the features I wanted.  Gigabyte was the other but they have their own issues with VRM coil whine that I cannot deal with as someone with Asperger's and being sensitive to high pitch noises.  The MSI Z790 Carbon had most of the features I wanted but their memory overclocking is behind other brands atm.  ASUS seems to have really dropped the ball with their AMD boards this gen, but when it comes to Intel, all the other brands have issues that are IMO, worse.
Yep, beta bios 1601 here on a TUF x670e & 7700x and it's STILL trying to pump more than 1.3 V_SoC. Even manually setting SoC it STILL goes well above what I manually set it at. Last time I ever buy from them. As my first team red rig ever (got a 6950xt at the same time) this is putting a VERY bad taste in my mouth. F*&# Asus!
This is why you NEVER buy AMD...NEVER.
Im a Linus fan but its kinda off putting that theyre pushing Asus' new handheld.
Well they are Blacklisted Forever just like Gigabyte.
If the market is already supporting a $700-$1000 price range for an upper tier Chinese gaming board, doesn't it seem like there is opportunity for a U.S. manufacture to domestically produce and support a competitive product?  A "great product" doesn't need poorly translated-branding, paragraph-sized product names, hideous logos, whimsical slogans or catchphrases, or preinstalled bloatware and other wasteful gimmicks.  It just has to work as advertised, last as long as the software running on it, be a fair price, and be covered by a comprehensive warranty and support lifecycle plan.  Is there anyone ethical left still headquartered AND manufacturing in the U.S.?
I have asus for a long time, and have started making a new PC with a Asus motherboard this scares me juuust a little bit,thank you for the great videos and for standing up for everyone.
Asus suxxed on Software side since forever. Asus aura? Never worked.
If I had a nickle for every time ASUS motherboards started blowing up I'd have two nickles. Which is A LOT IN 2 YEARS!
I'm just about to pull the trigger on a new system to finally replace my ageing 7700 build. I've been an avid ASUS customer for _many_ years now. This is so sad. Looks like I'm about to become an MSI or ASRock customer…
I regret buying my asus gpu
Shit I just built a PC for my buddy with an Asus board and the one thing I can't get figured out is getting a stable ram speed. I got him a 6600mhz kit and it wouldn't even boot with those speeds, but I've been slowly lowering it trying to find where is stable and so far 6000mhz is causing stuttering in some games.. At this point idk if I should keep lowering it until it's stable to return the board and get an MSI or Gigabyte board or somthing.
I quit ASUS about 2 years ago due to RMA issues and them sending me a MB that had worse problems than the board I sent them.
So you can use Asrock ... wasn't that founded by Asus to mess with the OEM market?
Thank you. I will not be buying/supporting any ASUS product in the future
I’ve been rocking an Asrock B550 Phantom Gaming 4 /ac board in both my video editing computers, I’ve been very happy with them! Never had a crash/bsod, even when rendering for long stretches with Adobe!
The last two asus laptops I've bought have been complete garbage right out of the box.
MSI FTW - My entire rig is MSI, never a problem.
man ive liked asus for so long.  i always tried getting asus when i could, like for my newest pc.  but now ive got to look elsewhere.   i feel like Garth when ron burgandy said f u on camera and he was my hero.  but he screwed up big time.  poop mouth asus
I totally agree Asus has gone down hill. From a trusted brand to failure. I had the strix 5700xt with the bad cooler screws. To 4 motherboard across amd and Intel from all the modern Gen not having support for the new Gen when the box has it printed on it that Gen ready.
The last asrock board I gave away was a hybrid board with an E6600 c2d , (conroe) I was the 3rd owner and it was 9 yrs old. (It still runs but is a spare pc now 16 years+ old)  My current board is a b550 phantom gaming 4 A/C. The last board (still works fine with a locked i5 4460) is an h87m-+ asus board.. cost me 75 gbp retail.    They were good for the money. The B3/4/550 boards from asus were a bit 'pants'. So I switched brands. The idea of buying  a $500 + motherboard to build a pc is just fxck1ng laughable. . Thats the real 'who do they think they are? Q_  Then they actually release this hyper price crap before they refine it? They are taking the buyer for granted and I switched ages ago.  (In fact their radeon rx and vega gpu cards left a lot to be desired ) Right now they dont give a crap about my opinion but when many stop paying them £100 for a 7xxx motherboard after the new tech price boost dries up they will backtrack and try to fix the damage to their brand but 'fxck it', I wont give them my trade again, too many others try hard so they can kiss my hairy ..AAAAAAHHHsse.
I have a x670e extreme and I think you are over reacting. I also have a z690 hero and the flipped resistor is a non issue. I always ran under 1.25v because it was widely known that running high soc voltages was dangerous. Igor’s lab recommended a max of 1.45v. I think a ton of blame is also on AMD for making people beta test voltages that don’t hurt the cpu and they probably only gave ASUS recommendations and not hard limits. I have a 9940x that I ran 1.275 vcore on that degraded and can’t run faster than 4400 MHz. Is that Intel or asus’ problem? No. It is part of the overclocking game. To be fair we don’t even have 100% guarantee that the 1.3v +0.08 vdroop is safe 24-7 for 3 years either. AMD is just guessing. My 7950x can’t even post 6000 Xmp at 1.25v without tuning the whole bios. I am not surprised they pushed the voltage to have the best memory overclocking because that’s what asus always does with rog boards and there was zero documentation this was unsafe. I’m also not surprised any beta bios has this language in it. I’m sure they will release a final bios eventually and before then just don’t run expo and run less than 1.3v. Why is this hard? My 7950x literally is slower in some 3440x1440 benchmarks compared to my 1950x threadripper because of how crappy the memory overclocks on this platform. My 12900ks and z690 is a ton faster.
Doing the right thing in scenarios like this takes guts, and everyone takes note. Thank you for doing the right thing here!
shoot I loved the ASUS and ROG branding. Bad press for them before their Ally, I was going to preorder one.
I have a 7950X build with a ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme motherboard, past the return window. I've been experiencing the same issues you have been experiencing on your stream, I also have crackling audio and intermittent peripheral connectivity. All I can do at this point is RMA for another motherboard. Spent $1000 on the damn thing. If I could go back in time I'd get a MSI Z790 mobo and a 13900K, but MSI's aesthetics are so corny, even with their Godlike. Seems like I'm stuck with an expensive product that doesn't work very well. Also been dealing with all the "have you tried this?" questions and everyone blaming something about my setup that isn't the mobo.
I used to fanboy this company pretty hard. Not gonna touch them now. At least for a long long time.
Wait the most greedy motherboard brand is all about money? Damn I had no idea, better late than never.
They need to learn that the consumer is king, fair play for standing up to them.
They have always treated AMD customers as second-class for years. Glad it's finally caught up to them.
Wow... Asus becoming the biggest scumbags of the earth.
Which asus motherboards are having these issues? I just built a pc with this one in it ASUS Prime Z790-P WiFi LGA 1700 (Intel 13th&12th Gen) ATX Motherboard
Sounds like I got lucky with my Apex.
Gotta put those money laundering corporate in line.
Thanks Jay! That’s why I’ve followed you since the start. You always think of us. ❤
I hope more tech creators jump in in this bandwagon exposing Asus for what it is. Personally, 2 out of 3 Asus products I bought recently (last year or so) had to be sent back for catastrophic failures. I can't tell you how angry I am at this company right now.
Hey Jay,   Honestly I have been using Asus for a long while but haven't really been happy recently, what brands would you recommend as solid competitors all anti consumer stuff aside. I'm just hoping for a recommendation for when I move up to Ryzen 7000 series if I end up deciding not to wait for next gen. Appreciate any input and I appreciate you being willing to talk about the anti-consumer practices. It helps me as a consumer see who does and does not care about receiving my hard earned cash.   Respectfully and Appreciatively, -Michael
This means a lot actually - between Steve and Jay I can honestly say I will be avoiding anything Asus puts out going forward. Actively working against the consumer is indefensible.
Problems like this is why I’m happy I went with a 5800x3D and didn’t go new gen.
easy fix dont buy asus stuff anymore in a year or so they wake up maybe
They'll start to care when Jay calls Linus, Steve, Marques, Hardware Canucks, and so on down the line and gets everyone onboard.
Asus had gone down hill since the knife incident; never will trust that brand ever again.
Thanks!
Asus literally bent pins on my board 10 years ago. If I didn't have a recording and a bunch of pictures of before I sent the board in for RMA, they wouldn't have replaced my $500 motherboard. I've bought a bunch of ASUS boards ever since because their bios is usually much smoother to work with than my other boards, but It's definitely a fact that they bend pins to void your warranty. Once they had my board, they just said "pay for a replacement or pay for the shipping and handling to get it back" (plus the s+h that was free to send it to them) because it's not covered if you void the warranty. Eventually after a couple of months I received a replacement because I sent them my videos and pictures of the board before they received it. After that, I never tried to rma anything with them again, I just pay for the 2 or 3 year replacement plan at microcenter. This is crazy that a decade later I see a video like this one.
Call me crazy, but MSI seems to look better and better.
ASUS outsourced their RMA process to Newegg???
boycott Asus
I basically fired ASUS as a computer brand back in 2013 when my ASUS N71 laptop quite literally melted down on me.  I switched over to Sager laptops ever since and have been pretty happy ever since.
I haven’t been super up to date with the problems ASUS has had lately with their motherboards so I’ve gotta ask, what does this mean for me? Obviously I’m not gonna make business with them seeing how they’ve handled the situation but I’ve got a Z790 E GW…should I be worried? I haven’t used or opened it since I’m waiting for my case…should I just keep it? Should I return it? Should I wait till problems do arise which I think hasn’t happened yet….
Fuck, I have the same ASUS board in my machine , and I constantly have slow boot ups and problems with M.2 drives being stable on it.. I am going to trash this board and get MSI
I've been using the Asrock X670E Steel Legend. It's been "rock" solid for months.  To be fair my other system using the ASUS X670E-F has also been solid except. 1. The rgb lighting is choppy no matter what I do and a small percentage of games run bad on a 4090.
So.. i won't lie. I'm a Asus fan. My entire build is rog. Down to the fans.   My lap top is also rog.  Like 10 or so years ago, when laptop hard drives were only just on the cusp of being 1tb, Asus had a recovery software that would burn physical recovery disks to "factory settings" or whatever you set it up to that moment.  I had been using it on a few of their laptops at that time now without issues.   My process was buy a new laptop, set it up, run the recovery, and test the CDs that same night.   Worked every time. Untill it didn't.  This time, it was my first 1tb hard drive laptop. And i ran the same steps.  It never got past the splash screen on the test cause the hard drive was corrupted by the software.   I spent HOURS on the phone with Asus.  I told them that computer was less then 12 hours old and that it worked fine till the recovery process was initiated.   He mocked me for doing a recovery on a brand new computer.  I told him I was getting rid of best buy bloat ware.   On my second laptop I looked up the issue and many users were also having the problem and stated it was cause the software was only compatible with hard drives 500 and below. 1tb didn't work.   I asked the rep if that was true and he said no, that that was a stupid reason and that their software wouldn't be affected by something like that cause it was "the best".  After another round of trouble shooting he gave up and said "you know what, call your mom and cry about it" and then hung up.   I've never once contacted Asus about anything again.
I watch most of your videos as you are very informative on computer products.  I appreciate your opinions, with that said all my motherboards, 5 of them have been ASUS.  My Z690 D4 had a glitch in it and I replaced it with ASUS Rog Strx Z790 E Gaming Wifi has been solid as a rock.  I'm going to miss your instructional videos on Asus products but I'm still a fan and will continue to watch your channel...
my asus motherboard just broke like fully no saving it and then this video comes out thats so funny i feel heard asf
Im on an Asus P6T (non deluxe) X58 x5680 OC and thank god I got a dam great board from that era. I love Asus but kinda has me thinking now.
I've been a fan of asus since the amd fx era and been using asus on my build since. I'm in a verge of upgrading (waiting for rtx 5000 series) and actually have asus motherboard on my wish list when im ready to upgrade my computer. But now with asus doing dishonest to the customer. It may have to reconsider a different brand. Anyone got any advice on which MOBO I should get?
This is a crazy development. I didn’t finish the whole GN video but wtf was Asus thinking.
I have a b550 meg unify and it has been fantastic, never had an Asus anything and clearly I'm safer not having bought any
I'm really pissed at these Scammer Assholes.
ASUS has been having issues with BIOS and USB connection since Z490 platform.  I have a Z490 A Gaming board and it is a nightmare keeping USB connected and every BIOS update I have to lower my memory speeds more and more to get away from blue screens and boot loops.  I am not one to RMA stuff unless it is unusable so I've been dealing with it for 2 years.  I am done with ASUS also and I have a lot of ASUS stuff.
And boom asus ad at the end of video thanks youtube lol
Would love to see EVGA take a proper crack at the motherboard market, take on the mantle as the go to mobo brand now that theyre out the GPU game
Why ever use a beta bios.. what's the point of using a test bios... nope nope nope..
And some people say Asrock is a "cheap" brand.
Asus, man, what happened? You used to be cool. :(
I swear this really chaps my ass! I have loved Asus's products for a long time, but it has been nothing but a stuggle with their stuff lately...The only thing I have bought from them in the last few years that didn't have some sort of issue is my monitor...To be fair they did replace the parts that had issues, but it took way too long to get back to me...With everything else going on with them, I guess I'm gonna be done buying their products until they make some significant changes!
i just got part for an upgrade and I swayed away from an asus mobo to msi and im glad
Damn...really couldn't have come at a worse time for the ROG Ally, preorder cancelled 😬
We so sorry in Asian accent?  Hmmm.. Is that your Taiwanese accent?  Pretty bad.
So I'm guessing you won't be reviewing the ally
This video is interesting about your issue, because my issue is their curved monitors or specifically the screen is starting to "de-glue" themselves from the frame and if I didn't put painters tape over the spot where it is coming apart, I know I wouldn't have a monitor anymore and I would rather not go through their customer support and just deal with my fixed problem instead
Thanks for holding ASUS accountable.
wow this makes me want to swap out my x470 board for something else. i started thinking about it and i have had ram issues and weird issues popping up lately. hmmm.
As someone who has this exact motherboard but with a 7700x cpu and a Tuf 4090 this is disappointing and concerning especially being a long time Asus supporter in every system I have built since 1996. After seeing these videos I wish more than anything I could return my board for a refund and get away from Asus for good or until they can fix their BS. I have odd issues too but can't seem to track down anything.
Nah it is Asus jay Their software is absolutely garbage I’m very disappointed in this company. I have been using them since the early 2000s. I have a 7800 X3D. On a x670E-F gaming wi-Fi with a 4090 I haven’t experienced the same exact issues that you have, but I have definitely had some witness specially with some of the supplied software is like the armoury crate for years and years, the AI sweet has been a buggy mess, and if you are forced to uninstall it, you have to download some crappy uninstall tool which doesn’t work properly this software is just a complete state of disarray I have experience quite a few bios related issues with this particular motherboard, and I am wishing I had not upgraded from my 5800 X3D which was on the asus crosshair. X570 it is definitely not AMD’s fault and I don’t think it’s AMD’s fault about the CPUs. Failing I think the motherboard manufacturers have just not done what they were supposed to do I spotted the high SOC voltage, even before that it was publicly known and lowered it just from experience, as I am also a computer technician it is such a shame because as you rightfully say they make a very nice looking product. The warranty support and the software just is not up to standard and I am very much considering moving away from ASUS brand and when are used to have clients come to me and asked me what motherboard should I use I always used to point them in the direction of Asus but after seeing this video and having experienced a lot of issues with customer computers, I  I am going to stop recommending them. Asus sort your shit out because people will not take this crap they will just simply move onto a brand that doesn’t do the sly Shady shit
So it come down to Asus not wanting to pay this jerk .. bravo to Asus do not sponsor this guy...haha contract terminated..lol😅 one experience..... ASRock paid this guy forsure lol
I have purchased ASUS for years. This explains why I have been having weird issues with my latest build!
I appreciate bringing attention to this. I honestly didn't know because I have been busy and not actively building a system yet. With this, I'll avoid using asus for my next pc build.
A SUS company...
going to build a new pc last 2 pc builds was a asus board  next build after this cluster fuck ill buy asrock befor ill buy asus again
I just ordered the Asus ROG Strix Z790-E gaming Wi-Fi board for $500. Two days ago. Should I be worried should I return it? 🙈😳
Asus used to be the only brand that I trusted due to having multiple issues with other brands around 4th gen and 6th gen Intel sad to see thier downfall I hope they get this sorted and go back to making quality products
Shit, I bought the X670E HERO and I plan to buy a 4090 rog strix oc to replace the 4090 SUPRIM X.  What do I do now? Go with Gigabyte?
Damn, I just bought an Asus Z790-E (intel) a week ago for my future build (I expect to finish buying everything by the end of the year). I can't even test it yet since I don't have all the hardware. 😢 should I return it? Or is it ok on Intel?
Jay, when can we get a video of you donating all your asus hardware?
thank god ive looked at this video before i went and bought my new pc/pc parts. i wanted to build a pc with the new amd 3dx cpu and an asus mb, asus gc, asus liqiud cooler, everything asus. as ive seen this video, my fanboy status is now in search for a new company to fanboy. i stand by you jay and your words. f them, that is a really scummy move. becouse i woud have done the bios thing and prolly burn the cpu and waste over 3-4000 euros becouse of asus`s scummy marketing tactics.
Its saying something that Gigabyte looks better than Asus right now. At least Gigabyte has released timely BIOS updates and is willing to take back bricked AM5 boards (even with their lackluster customer service).
Jay: "Now I have an MSI board and and I'm free and clear from all this crap"   MSI: "Hold my beer"  News: "Intel investigating BootGuard security key leak following MSI hack"  It's always something with these manufactures.
Last 2 builds x570 crosshair hero and x570 tuf wifi were flawless.  4070ti oc tuf runs flawless.  The AM5 variant sounds like it needs time to flesh out.  Sad really.
i love asus
14:00 when was ASRock every a "brand you avoid at all cost" brand? I've had them since the AM3 990FX chipset. I've never heard even back than people saying not to purchase ASRock. BioStar? Sure.
After watching this video, I just told my friend, who's building a 7950x3D build, to remove all ASUS products from his build.  It's just not worth it.
Asus been falling off ever since socket 775 I had  sabertooth board I sent it in for a audio problem and they rejected it because it was “bent” never again Msi ftw
I came to this video after watching hands-on rog ally videos😝 thx yt
Thank you! I've been with Asus for many years now, a few builds with their GPU's / Motherboards. I finally got a Asus 3080 Strixs a few months back and one of the fan bearings is already making noise.  Their quality is just slacking lately. And I find it unlikely I'll go with Asus for the next build.
OOOOOO spicy title lets go.   okay personal experience 3 ASUS motherboards from 3 different builds all from amazon. every single one had issues on delivery and need to be R.M.A. In comparison 2 gigabyte motherboards both fine on delivery..... and still being used right now
To be honest this explains sooo much with my own issues. Used to look to ASUS for quality....guess not anymore.
Okay that doesn’t sit right with me…  I was going to use an ASUS board for my next build. What would you recommend for an i9-13900k and a 4090?
i didn't have any problems with asus motherboard in the past from the  amd am3 and am3+ era. the reason i choose asrock because of their success rate of no failure on their hardware like motherboards and gpu. and my pc rig as been good on my amd 4 x570. but i did had a issue with their software which is minor but it was abit annoying. but after seeing what been happening for the last six years i am glad i didn't go with asus. my next pc build will be asrock but in a micro-atx but i am enjoy my current rig as of now.
Heads will roll in Asus.
"O' brother, where art though creditability?"  SHIT!
im speechless
Since ur off Asus Jay can you please send me an asus rx 6900 or 6950 you don't want M8? I said please
Asrock B450 legend with 5800x3d 32gb ram (4 sticks) Solid as a Asrock for a couple years now. Like the UI more than other brands too.
any issues  with asus gaming laptops?
Well, back to M.S.I it's is then.
Well Jay, I’d take a board or 2.
My Dark Hero ran fine for two years and then went flaky. My board is now with ASUS and they seem to be handling it according to process so far. I have a real beef with AMD though. Trying to send back a 7 5800 and getting nothing but the run around. First they said they couldn't read the serial number and model number on the chip. Then they needed a copy of the sales receipt. Provided both and now it has been a week and they refuse to respond to my emails. PC support just sucks! I am considering going with an Intel build now. Which boards and chips are you recommending?
This is great news for the guy that just purchased the new G14.... F
For years I have exclusively used ASUS products but not any more. Good video. Thank you.
luckily I went with GIGABYTE for mobo the only thing I can give credit to ASUS is for the graphics card and their monitors that's it really!
OMG 😮
Wow, way to piss off exactly the wrong people. I remember Asus being a top brand since looking for a Pentium I board in that huge Computer Shopper catalog. I now have a ROG Strix X470f board that's been working fine for three years. Guess it will be the last Asus board I buy...
last video you said MSI are getting pretty damn good tho on that friends PC .. built.. i was thinking the same way a week before coming from an asus board  fan here..  We all as gaming pc builder.   We cant let another NEWEGG thing like last time.. EVER HAPPENED again ,  I for one will only consider AVGA ,  MSI , AND ASROCK... I Had problems for gigabyte one time and their warranty isnt that  good ... Thanks for standing up together on this... LETS STOP BUYING ASUS our beloved gaming community ...
Shame. The ASUS 3080 tuff I got has been great.
To think asrock used to be a subsidiary to asus
You do know Asus is spelled with “sus”? 😂
Good thing I chose a MSI motherboard over an ASUS motherboard when I upgraded my PC last Friday.
i was done with asus and amd earlier this year, after my issues with usb 2.0 not working on b550 and with a 5700g, then issues with loss of audio on my 6700xt if i dont leave a 1500mhz low limit clock speed. my intel and asrock board does great. stuck with this 6700xt for now though, msi afterburner is my constant fix for that by just raising clock table.
Feeling pretty conflicted learning all this having just preordered a ROG Ally...
I've realised a few years ago that Asus motherboards are crap.
Companies that are still staying in china must be avoided as much as possible. Their QC is crap .
This is why gigabyte is and always will be better.
I have an x670e Crosshair hero that I received with bent pins. They had me send it back to them which cost 100ish bucks with shipping. When they got it they told me that it was my fault. And wanted to charge me. As it was a 700$ board I said fuck it. I’ll pay I just want it back. They sent it back to me without fixing it….
No issues here with MSI, thankfully
Glad I saw this today. I was about to go to Microcenter this weekend and get an Asus graphics card. Back to the drawing board on that one tho 🤷‍♀
Honestly, I'm considering buying a completely different motherboard for my am5 (7900x) system, even after the new bios revisions.  There stupid decisions lead to my 7900x regularly getting blasted with 1.416V for no good reason. It's probably far more degraded than it has any right to be, and all because they couldn't bother to be less aggressive on the voltage for what, stability? A bit of extra performance? I don't know if it's laziness, that they don't care about the consequences, or prioritized that last 1% performance to top charts, but it doesn't matter. They've completely spat in the face of their customers, and I'm not buying another one of their products in any category until they get their act together.  To put into perspective how this is going, the AMD subreddit is typically recommending ASRock and MSI boards for am5 (and really just not Asus in general). The fact that ASRock is a major recommendation says a lot, both that ASRock has come a long way (which they have) and that people are really, really mad at Asus and do not trust them at all. I don't, and you shouldn't either.
I wouldn't be surprised if this video makes their (ASUS) stock price drop 10%.
I'm sure because of sponsorship u can't do this... But, I would love a tier list of PC part manufacturers of reliability/customer service/ price/ performance/ future outlook/ history vs now. It'll even give u a reason to fan boy more on EVGA :p.
Had to recently send my 3080 rog strix white to asus warranty and told me they cant replace nor repair and would only give me a % of what I spent lmao
I was about to buy an ROG monitor but now I’m like ehh
I thought my stability issues might have been CPU related. I realize now that my old Gigabyte board may not have been incredibly stable as a whole, but when it had an issue I knew how to fix it. I will not be buying another Asus board.
I actually stepped away from ASUS with my latest build. AMD 7950X3D, MSI MPG X670E Carbon, G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo 64gb @ 6000mhz EXPO enabled, XFX 7900 XTX. Had some issues with running Horizon Zero Dawn on PC, some random Driver crashes. But lately, its been running flawlessly. Zero crashes with the latest driver 23.4.3.
I had to give up on them as well. I bought a expensive gaming laptop for school and to use. Was a pretty decent build and all of a sudden after the 11th month the whole system died. Sent it in to RMA or only to be told since I upgraded the nvme and ram I voided my warranty. Long story short got a full refund from Costco and now I avoid anything asus their pr and customer service department is by far the worst part of their brand
After this video ashrock products got a 20% uplift on the price from the vendors JAY You Killing Us Here !
kudos !
I've got a 7950X3D in a Strix X670E-F that from day one has been giving me issues. Not PC breaking issues, but I run a PCIe x4 USB expansion card in the in the bottom most x16 slot and sometimes it just refuses to initialize on cold boot. Always sees it on a reboot, but it's a coinflip on cold boot. This is absolutely infuriating as I have a ton of peripherals (obviously, that's why I have the card) that NEED to run for this PC to be useful as the racing/flying sim rig that it is. I've got probably 15 grand tied up in all of this and to have a premium board that you can't trust to work 100% of the time is ridiculous. I sat around and waited thinking they'd fix it with a BIOS update, but now all of this VSOC crap is going on and there's no way PCIe slot initialization is high on their to-do list. Now I'm out of the return window. Great. Part of me just wants to go buy an MSI board and throw this one in the trash but I'm not really trying to eat a $450 board. I wouldn't want an RMA, I'd want a refund, and I have zero faith that I would get one.
Thank you, Jay. For being the voice of a lot of consumers
so now i gotta trash all my ASUS stuff Come On MAN!
Amazing,  this is why I trust you
I remember when I subbed to you, a month later you announced you were doing a case for Terry Crews, and was like, wtf cool. But your integrity as a person has kept me watching pretty near every video since.
This been a long time coming asus fell off hard, also I like when you do this content and msi hasn't failed me yet I've used several of their boards now and recommend them to my friends
Jay Is this Asus ROG STRIX B550-F Gaming motherboard bad as well?  It is the second one that I have purchased from Microcenter, this year a lone.  I have 2 of the same motherboard from Asus, it is for the AMD CPU build.  It was overheating like crazy and it would shutdown, just because the CPU was not protected and it would automatically shutdown to protect the board and the CPU.
I was about to buy asus mobo but then I see this. Is gigabyte good? Do they have good mobos?
literally just bought the top brand AMD processor and an ASUS board. Just received the parts to finalize the computer today. guess what part I'm replacing before this thing gets assembled?
Ok!!!!! MSI it is!
Now imagine being a normal consumer without a personal contact with these companies. You get to talk to Habibi or Akmed after waiting on hold for an hour, you get to pay for the RMA to replace something messed up with something used that may also be messed up. From what I have seen, they're all the same except EVGA. That company has always been amazing to work with.
I own a few businesses. I can’t imagine not standing behind my products/services because the damage to your brand is far greater than any money you spend on making the customer whole again. Take the initial kick in the nuts and gain customers for life.
So...motherboards...time for someone to bring Abit back to life?
From best to worst in one step!  Where do I go to for my next PC build?  I was relying on ASUS because they have been good.  But, they have trashed their reputation, so I cannot use them.  ASUS, you are fired!
I hope ASUS will soon feel a massive sales loss
I've been running an Asus X670-E Gene, and a Ryzen 9 7950x, since the release. So far, the BIOS updates have made the system more stabe. That being said, I recently upgraded to the Beta BIOS, I guess i should probably revert before anything goes wrong... 😬
With asus and gigabyte in the fired category, which motherboard brands will you be featuring???
Eh. Asus will correct these issues. MSI and gigabyte have burned me with items and support.
I've been sayong this everytime you have a problem with an ASUS product - "you should test tue RMA procedure and not use your rep". You and other youtubers who always have ASUS problems but use your reps to sort them are making ASUS look better than they deserve. Also making other non youtuber customers fall into the trap...
In 2003 I used my first ASUS motherboard in my own build and haven't used any other motherboard brand since, in computers I built for me and others. My current ASUS motherboard will be my last unless the company takes a serious turn for the better. They really need to return to reliable products and at least decent customer service. If they can't get their top tier products to be reliable, why would anyone expect they would pay more attention to their mid tier products? This is the straw that broke the camel's back. This is a sad day.
Damnit Jay... Now I'm going to be forced to go outside of a brand that I used to trust and get some weird ASROCK motherboard for my new gaming build lol. Thanks for saving me some headaches!
I recently ran into an issue with my Zephyrus duo laptop after only 2 years all the sudden not having a battery. Their "support" diagnostics says yup theres a problem with you battery do you want to start a ticket....That's it, just a standard M$ blue screen this is the problem... I'm hoping the battery i ordered fixes it. I cannot afford to have to send it in for repairs by them. I found this out while on a trip which ended up cutting my trip short as I had to get back home to stay plugged in to get some work done. The first thing suggested to fix this issue is a bios flash. I guess luckily for me there is no bios for my laptop. Over the last 2 years I have grown to despise the invasionivness of their my asus and armory crate software, to me it's almost to the mcaffy level of things. But good to see some of the more reliable names calling out Asus for their antics these days. I for one have lost all confidence in their brand.
I've been building gaming rigs since the late 90's and ive always used ASUS. I'm actually in the market now, and I agree, they're fired. Point being even fan boys like me are never buying from Asus again. This is INSANE, I have never seen this is all my years of gaming. Only problem is who should I buy from now, MSI, Gigabyte, asrock, evga? No clue lol
Isn't AsRock part of ASUS?
I have had an ASrock mobo for about 9 years. gigabytes fail all the time, Asus has had some duds and some great boards in the systems that I have built
ASUS quality has been going downhill for year last time i bought an ASUS ROG board was in 2011 and it was still had minor CPU issues with that board after that ASUS board i've never touch that brand after that and never had issues again.... they used to be a good brand back in 2005 but now they are pretty bad motherboards imo..
Last 3 pcs have been with asus mobos/gpus. I can on hand say I had VERY bad experience with their RMA with a GPU, eventually my re-seller covered my warranty not asus. Once my current system has its time I dont think Ill be going back to asus
I guarantee it was greed from "cost cutting" which likely came from getting rid of staff, procedures, cheaper components and outsourcing as much as possible! Love the video! Hold more shady brands accountable!
Oush asus. Looks ill need to change my intel asus board out and possibly the asus tuf 4090 that i have.
Keep the good work, this is really appreciated.👍✌🤟
Great job! Asus had a backdoor in some of their wifi routers a couple years ago. Guess the problem has now infected their company hahaha 🤣
Love how you replace all the f words with Asus graphics. 😅
I have an ASUS board and one RBG header has already shorted (the board still works!) and the GPU tab holder on the PCI slot broke off (which is a blessing because it was stiff and stuck as Excalibur's sword).    I definitely will go with another board maker next go around but....they kinda all suck in their own way.
Rethinking this Rog Ally preorder...
Similar story. I got a ROG Z690 F last year to upgrade my PC. 1 month after, my PC started crashing, blue screen, unable to boot etc... I suspected it's the RAM module which the store confirmed and agreed to exchange. The thing is it took over 2 months and I still didn't see a replacement. So I ended up getting an Aorus Master 790 and it has been rock solid for half a year. When they finally sent me the replacement, I sold it at a loss even though they offered to start over my warranty. Just tired of dealing of Asus. At the price I paid for the Z690 F, I would not have to deal with the entire warranty thing.
Mic drop at the end
Please check your soc voltage and make sure its not above 1.3 volts
I bought 2 laptop from asus till now. Vivobook had the worst battery life with bad build laptop. Later I thought lets buy the higher quality zenbook, so it doesn’t have problem like cheaper vivobook. Bought zenbook 14 oled and ohh boy, it failed me real good. Build quality worst than plastic build, overheating for no reason and now worst of all, trackpad stops  working or behaves weirdly in every 40 to 60 minutes. Sometimes touching outside of the laptop also moves the cursor(though can’t control it). Guess what my last mb was also from asus(strix z390h) and that also failed after just 3 years. This level of quality control from a named brand like asus, no one will accept it. Never buying an asus product again. Done being a Asus fanboy.
I hope Asus gets sued or slapped by the EU
Kinda looks like Asus has become Nvidia. Its all about the money. I am using a B550 motherboard which works fine I wish I had bought a Msi or Gigabyte board only because I hate Armoury crate.I haven't seen a bios update in almost a year. Makes a person wonder. Glad to see you sticking up for us.
I’m glad I got in early, I have a 10th gen system in an ASUS board. I think it’s okay, although my CPU overclocks aren’t “sticking”. With this clusterfck situation, AMD is just as culpable.
I haven't bought ASUS stuff in years.  I don't feel bad about this now.
I own the x670e motherboard and it's been absolutely terrible memory is super unstable it burnt out one of my cpus luckily it was replaced I wish I had the money to swap to the godlike I will be msi from now on
It’s funny that my ASRock B450m fried my Ryzen 7 2700x then I switched to the ASUS Prime X470-PRO and it’s been mostly great. How the turn tables
You know what's the fucked part of all this. Asus was the only manufacturer really putting effort to make top of the line AMD boards. I wanted a 7950X mini itx with asus strix board.... but i guess i will have to go to intel for a proper mini itx board that has all bells and whistles, huge IO in the back panel and looks decent
Good job having a back bone. You should only back companies that back the consumer. Let all these greedy crappy companies fail. Companies only learn when they start losing money. If everyone stopped using ASUS, ASUS would have to change and or fail as a company.
keep your "stuff"
ASUS Strix 3000 video boards were the best of the Nvidia 3000 boards. Is there any problems with their Nvidia Strix 4000 boards?
I've used MSI for decades. Motherboards, GPUs, etc. Always made cheap reliable screamers for me. I always felt like Asus was a tad overrated at their price point but generally did offer a better warranty than their competition. Now I understand why. Their QC/Support has been on a steady decline.
Good for you Jay! I’ve never owned an ASUS product and never will.
Back in 2020 during the height of craziness, the only board I was able to snag was an Asus Rog X570, after installing everything and it went to bios, I changed XMP and then black screen. Tried everything and just returned it and waited till another brand came in stock cause apparently those boards could do anything above 3200mhz(even though it stated it supported up 4800).  Later on bought a 2k asus monitor and within 2 months had a rainbow stripe pattern appearing at the bottom edge of the screen, and that’s when I was officially down with Anything Asus. Thought the board was just a lemon, till I read  about the XMP issue, but it’s a bummer cause my old intel Setup used an Asus board with no problems(i7 4790k) such a shame
I use Asrock for more then 8 years for mine and friends and family build without problems. I converted after 3 failed boards in year.
I had an ASUS Tuf RTX 3070 die/ fry. It’s the first card I had die out of the 4-5 gpu upgrades I’ve done to my personal/ gaming rig
Who else was waiting for Jay to throw out his arms and send all those motherboards flying?
Lwt us also not forget x370 ASUS board self bricking March 2017, which is why when my failed three pre-order mobos failed I was oh wait I have a microcenter 40m away do they have stock? Yes. ASROCK and ASUS, so ASROCK x370 Fatal1ty Professinal Gaming it was otherwise I sit on all my parts for WEEKS more... yeah I got my 1800X launch day but no mobo, then still no mobo, and again no mobo, so above... And yes ASUS boards were bricking although by the time that I went o microcenter there were officially unofficial? official unofficial? beta BIOS that apparently fixed that... I guess that it got swept under the rug pretty well, but it should still have info out there... also ASUS GIGABYTE abd BIOSTAR were three mfgs that I have experience with that liked to have their defaults when FSB mattered more to be overclocked a few(or more) megahertz as 'stock'... which back then yeah it gave you a boost in perf...  Anyways my ASROCK x670e PG lightning 7900X 2x15GB g.skill flare x5 running ancient 1.07 Septembert BIOS SoC voltage 1.014V, updated last weekend to 1.24AS02 still 1.014V 2x16GB g.skill flare x5 6000, ran expo SoC voltage 1.24V, yesterday added two more 2x15GB g.skill flare x5 6000 still 1.24 running expo(32GB and 24GB and 48GB are still way too expensive but 16GB sticks seem to have fallen nicely in price and oh yeah I was happy EXPO 6000 with 4x16GB worked yep meanwhile I fought my x370 to reach 2933, XMP never worked and I gave up tuning more after hitting 2933 stable... 3000 3200 would boot but would fail stability or BSOD)  Next up why does a770 bug check 0x116, so I can't sleep or screen lock my computer but OTHERWISE it works A OK, hey Intel WTF is up?
And ASRock was spun off of ASUS :P
Asucks has been overrated for many years.
Best Buy did that to my wife, sold her a drone that was returned, which was tied to someone else’s email account, we couldn’t change. So we returned it, and got a DJI instead and fly more kit.  Sorry ASUS sux so bad. They were pretty good in the 90’s, but stuff didn’t get so hot back then either ;-)  Welp toss ASUS off the potential dual processor multi-GPU selection list! Bad enough they burn up one processor don’t need to give them two to eat!  Sorry ASUS, you’ll have to go he successful somewhere else.  My pockets ain’t that deep to keep feedin you, with no returns. Gas, Grass, or move yer ass out the door!
how to get respect and trust in one video ->
You made me feel a lot better after watching this. I bought a ASROCK board last week, just wanting to try something new. Thank you for the honest content, you rule!
very well said. thanks for the statements given. truly.
My brother ASRock with 2600x was really solid, no bsod, no errors, nothing, steady vrm monitoring and voltage, i though one of my PSU was dying on my z170 aura, still work but is about to die btw, and tested on ASRock mb the voltages was all perfect.
Yeah, damn Asswipes destroying your Hardware with Defective Shit Mobos. They should get Mass Lawsuits.
Thanks Jay.
Never understood how corpos will throw away all of their good will for the sake of profit.
I'm so sick of Asus' crappy software.  I can't even get Armoury Crate to launch the past year after it was updated at one point on my Dark Hero.  It's Bullshit.
I have seen this throughout the years from different motherboard companies and other mfgs. Beta is just beta and if they move it out of beta is the question. Asus knows of a issue and is trying to correct it. Until that time. Anything is at user risk. I remember at one time you never every updated the bios unless instructed by the motherboard mfg or a last ditch effort to fix an issue. Then over time you did it just to see if the machine ran better.  Even if the mfg website said only use if you was having issues. This was not even beta bios. So I'll wait to see if a final bios update fixes this or if they recall the motherboard.
its been like this since at least 2017. 1st Gen support for Threadripper with Asus boards were garbage. Terrible long term investment for gaming and productivity.
Ohh NO!!! I've been an ASUS fanboy since 2005, and now I really, REALLY got to think ahead.... WTF??? 😭😭😭
I had an issue with my 7700x and my MSI B650-P board not playing nicely and MSI has done everything they can to help me fix the problem.  I also had a M.2 drive die and they RMA'ed it quickly and turned around delivery in 3 days total.  The last time I bought anything from Asus was a TUF laptop that overheated and throttled after 2 days of use and their only response was return it for a refund.
Never will I buy anything for asus again.  And I’ve bought thousands of dollars of their boards and gpus
Today: ASUS you're not my friend any more Next week: Me and my BFF ASUS are hanging out wanna come?
Since the early 2000s most of my builds have been using Asus boards, well before they started glamming them up. In the past year I’ve worked with four different Z590-690 motherboards and three of those were the most finicky wastes of material that I’ve ever dealt with (and one had a stealth recall). Literal days of time spent troubleshooting ram (four sticks? Too bad!), unstable bios updates (as well as not being able to revert bios!?) and some really bizarre hardware issues.  I loved the brand in the past, but they’ve cost far too much time and money with this nonsense. If I spend $1000 on a motherboard I expect the darned thing to work.
does anyone know if the 650 chipsets are having isues like the 670s? so far i havent seen any voltage issues on my 7800x3d but idk how long it took for other people on 670 chipset
I had actually already "blacklisted" ASUS kind of symbolically or principally years ago, after having seen and experienced different negative things with them. - Now, I haven't had many ASUS-products, other than a motherboard (a Pentium 4 one) that actually died (during the Core2-generation, which means it wasn't that old), and perhaps a GPU or something long ago. - Other than that, my sister had a laptop of theirs and it was actually pretty bad, to the point that the hinges of the monitor basically broke (and it was just super loud). - But even unrelated to me directly, I've seen too many questionable things come out about them that I seriously started to just avoid the brand when selecting parts. I would just see those... well, as an option, but also not an option, even if the product seemed like it fit my needs. I just had too much doubt and I couldn't give them the benefit of it anymore. - So, basically, I agree. Fuggem!
I bought one Asus motherboard an have to returned cuz a leaked capacitor and the PCB was bent a bit, when i received the replacement the PCB was noticeably bent also, sadly i couldn't do RMA for that reason and they were Z690-E motherboard and the quality left to be desired.
Thank you for sticking up for the consumer! My rig has an Asus Z170 with my i7 6700K and I was looking at Asus again when I upgrade, but now I think I definitely need to look elsewhere
Go back to Intel... love my AMD for specs, but random issues like lockups when using high bandwidth through USB, 4K webcam, is at least a monthly issue.  My wife's Intel 13700K I built  did simply never has these issues.  Two AMD builds in a row make me think it is an AMD issue for me.
well feel free to send me all your asus stuff you dont want lol
Eh... I take what a social media influencer says with a grain of salt. I build a couple systems a year for me and those around me. I have had zero issues with Asus.  Zero. Granted I have not built an AMD system since the K5. So maybe I've been safe be only using intel based boards and cpus? I don't know.  I'll take my experience over that of Jay.
Burning bridges is so stupid. Sorry but this feels like putting the cart before the horse 🫣
I've only used asrock boards since bulldozer I've been a amd fan boy since then dk why just always felt amd just was always gonna turn it around but I've always felt asus was over-rated and over priced my motherboards always been asrock and up till my current gpu that is a sapphire I used xfx I was gonna go for 7000 series both cpu and gpu and I'm kinda glad I stuck with my 5800x and 6900xt and did my first hard line custom loop sad to see this that asus has taken such a turn for the worse even though I stated I've always felt they were overpriced and over-rated can't say that I wouldn't build a pretty all asus rig till the past few generations
They want you to help them beta test a driver ,  like you're to be their Guinée pig and sacrifice your motherboard .
LOOOOOOOOOOL, I've been calling out Asus for years now. Even in the video where Jayz was recommending the TUF A15 Laptop from asus, they are a garbage company only interested in money grabs. Better late than never though. Kudos to Jayz
Im still waiting for a replacement VRM for my z690 formula cause of the corrosion with EK blocks.
forever is harsh, revisit this in 1 year of 2 maybe.  stuff can change
I am so glad that I decided to put off building a new system using a 7950X and a Asus Pro Art MB. I just bought a 5900X to replace the 3700X in the old system. It has been a good upgrade. The new system will wait for a year or more to let the platform get settled down.
Feels like I'm stuck between a disappointed and frustrated dad and their delinquent kid that's fucked up
Does this also include the X570 series motherboards?
Finally, Ive always thought they were garbage.... and yeah it turns out they are garbage...
JJ and Jay should fight!!
Just watching Northridge Fix and his commentary on how many ASUS laptops he fixes over and over again (HP Spectre being a close second) was starting to put a bad taste in my mouth and MY rig is a complete ROG STRIX fanboy build. Black & Chrome/Sliver hardware w/complete system custom loop with red coolant lit with dim white LED on the the waterblocks and res. BTW... If anyone can point me in the direction of a "new" Core G3 Thermaltake case I'd appreciate it. HTPC case market sucks for those in one room condo's with only TV stands for the case. (yes I case mod'ed it for a 360 rad, want a do over with a better idea... but I digress) 😉👍 I hope MORE tech "influencers" follow your lead if they feel that they have have cause.
Jay mentioned the backwards cap recall and how Asus didn't want to talk about it. Funny to mention Steve at GN had Asus reach out asking to talk about it but ghosted GN once they asked to do it openly.
WE can file a " Class action Lawsuit" :)
I had a system that crapped out with several peripherals disconnected. Turned out to be a powered USB HUB that died.
just dumb luck i went with an asrock mobo for my 7700x build instead of asus. feel like i really matrix'd that bullet.
I'm honestly really happy to see this. I'm not happy that we're in this situation, but ASUS has just gotten worse and worse and worse and worse, year over year. It isn't just the motherboard division either, we've seen the worst issues there of course, but we've had issues with laptops(shout out to Hardware Unboxed holding their feet to the fire about the cooling vents on the TUF 15 a few gens ago; ASUS handled that situation HORRIBLY), we've had issues with half-baked monitors(Linus used one for, what, like 2 months or something before replacing it with an LG IIRC?), this is something systemic going on within the overall business structure no doubt. Just like 5 or 6 years ago they had a pretty damn bulletproof reputation, you could always go with ASUS if you wanted a brand that you could be confident would "just work" and wouldn't give you any problems. Now, my 1st gen Ryzen system started out with an ASUS board and was replaced with an ASRock board shortly after because I was a lil disgusted by how little ASUS gives you in the way of features & I/O on their budget offerings, ASRock offered a lot more board for the money, but luckily I haven't had to stop using ASUS for a product failure. Helps that I've largely chosen to stay away as more and more of these issues have revealed themselves though.    And this really sucks too when their actions are damaging other brands, like AMD in this latest instance. Even if AMD has nothing to do with the fault, it still puts that kernel in peoples minds that "...well, I'm probably likely to just have less issues if I just go Intel...", which is obviously a bit of a problem(and it's not like ASUS has exactly shown any 'equality' with their handling of AMD products; they were the first to sign up for Nvidia's 'GeForce Partner Program' a few years ago that would've really undermined Radeon after all). We can't have this, it's terrible for the market in more ways than just the obvious ones.
Hey EVGA here's a market sector you can step into and save us.
Cuz of this stuff with asus I am sending a MB I got (x790 itx with the dac) back and getting the asrock PG MB.....I haven't gotten to build the new system yet cuz it is in another state waiting on me to get home......this sad cuz I love asus GPUs and love building systems around a single brand when I can
ASUS motherboard in cart ——-————> removed
I am so annoyed I got an ASUS Mobo just before this all came to light. Feel gross having it, feel unsure if my 7800X3D is safe. I will never buy ASUS again.
I think you are way overreacting so is everyone in the comments - I have built PCs since 286's, and while do I definitely agree that there is an issue with quality control, that issue is spread across the entire industry, companies are cutting corners, customer service is not what it used to be, and quality control is not what it used to be, I can go over a huge list of fuck-ups companies made in the tech industry, ASUS is definitely NOT alone.  I would definitely choose ASUS for build quality and stability hands down - I've used ASUS for so many years on systems that are on 24/7, some even used for heavy loads and editing, rendering, development, and I could never be happier.   There are MANY companies out there that fit the description in your video, in terms of warranties, fighting, bad support, etc..   As far as the inverted capacitor, well yeah that is unfortunate, but there are other big brands equally responsible.  There have been WRONG capacitor types and voltages used on Samsung Smart TVs, causing premature failure, the list goes on and on, once upon a time you could buy an appliance and it would last you for 30 years +, not anymore, so yeah   You might as well drop Intel too for their 1700 socket design, for the connector catching fire issues, etc.  Poor quality control is everywhere.   There are millions of systems being built on ASUS till this day without issues, and certainly will not stop using ASUS from your video - Having used many other boards, I will stick to ASUS for my motherboards and ASUS for my graphics cards.    I used EVGA before that, but unfortunately EVGA parted ways with NVIDIA.  I've had so many issues with other graphics card, never with ASUS, I've had issues with other boards, and the only failure I had with ASUS in ALL those builds I have made, is ONCE, a faulty BIOS, and board was replaced promptly.
I was literally going to buy an Asus mb since amd chips are on sale, but this changed my mind. Thank you for doing service for the community. We really appreciate it.
Last year I did my build and really wanted that x570 hero motherboard but it was too much money so I went with msi now I’m glad I did
My Asrock X570 Taichi MB is solid.  They got better.  This is the first Asrock board I have used in a long time. I started having problems with ASUS many years ago, and never went back.Thanks for being truthful, even though it impacts your business and channel.  Thank you again.
Jay yelling about his free shit
I had only problems with Asus with the last few years. My gaming laptop from Asus randomly decided that it was no longer going to have a functionional display or wifi. I tried everything under the sun to fix it and it was the first and only time some technology had me completely stumped. The best part is it failed right outside of warranty. My brothers also had issues with their hardware right outside the warranty. When I built my PC I refused to use any Asus parts cause it's clear they don't care about longevity.
Sounds like a right to repair violation for the warranty void created by their licensed software. Also I have the Sonic the Hedgehog ASRock Mobo & have had ZERO issues. So glad I got it for my Sonic themed PC.
I have a x570 dark hero, i went from years of Aorus boards to it when I went 5800x3d cause it was rated to be the best, it's been good but has the infamous won't boot unless you power cycle bug that Asus STILL HASN'T resolved after countless reports (just google X570 dark hero start up issue, it's like #1/#2 hit). my recent 2nd build has been a MSI Tomahawk and I think i'll likely go MSI or maybe Aorus in subsequent builds. the reports of Asus QC has started to question if Asus can make anything good anymore considering in the past people said they were the Apples of the PC world.
When you spend 1000+$ on hardware you expect great services.. If not people start going else where. What's sad it's been barely year since the 12th gen Z690 board issues and they still not being careful
so it seems that ASUS mobo's have problems with AMD, but not intel boards?  And the GPU side is still solidly ok.  As for ASRock, they were sort of the mid range 3rd or 4th string guy you would pull if your first string companies didn't have what you wanted or were too far out of price range.  ASRock RAM has been good for a while along with Corsair, as for brand familiarity.
I’ve been through 2 Asus laptops in the recent couple years. Nope nope nope. Do not recommend
Dude, I'm so pissed off about all this. The PC I use for my day job doing utility design, editing my youtube content, playing video games, and editing photos is a 7950X/Crosshair X670E/RTX 4090 and it's been nothing but problems. I can't run EXPO, Dr. Debug has all kinds of fun error codes. Boot loops and stability problems. You Name it. Now I have to worry about how much the board degraded the CPU because of voltage. I almost went with Asrock for the mobo too because my TV gaming PC has the Taichi 7900XTX and it's fantastic. After blowing all the money on the epic build, what the heck and I supposed to do? I guess just keep running it without EXPO and on the Beta "this is gonna void your warranty" bios.
I was an Asus Fanboy up until two years ago. Bought an Asus laptop that failed within a week. Thankfully I got it from Best Buy and got a replacement right away. That died only a couple days later. Ended up returning that thinking man what bad luck and got a different kind of Asus laptop... Third time was not a charm, this new laptop has had the wifi 6e die right after my return window with Best Buy and Asus was literally no help with their customer support. Can't trust this brand anymore.
Not long ago, everyone was moving away from MSI due to shady review practices and ethics. People have short memory....it'll take only a few months for this to be forgotten
not susre how safe msi is at this point. Didn't they just get hacked and had their private signing keys leaked and even their intel boot guard keys
I have a 7900x build with the ASUS TUF Gaming x670e Wifi mobo, and a lot of these stability issues and RAM probs sound VERY familiar. Disturbingly familiar. Might be time to look into an MSI mobo swap...
This is really cool to see dude. I already looked at you as a trusted source, but this really solidifies that for me. Keep being awesome dude. It's appreciated.
I have a ROG Crosshair VIII Hero with a AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and have had issues with a few random resets or instead of "power off" it reboots. I have not been happy with the motherboard and know that my next build in a gen or two will not be on an Asus motherboard. Just have to put up with the crappy software and hardware until then.
Ok, so don't buy Asus anymore. Got it!
I never liked asus all that much so many people would always recommend me them when i got into the PC scene but EVGA always caught my eyes
Now then, lets see how Asus is going to respond.....
Really happy to see this, I was thinking the ALLY news was going to hide this from a lot of eyes.  This anti-consumer nonsense is unacceptable. Love to see you guys are taking a stand
My z790 strix e has problems with usb
This has Harvard MBA written all over it....
Asus products are the most expensive. Paying a premium for their brand name when thr quality has significantly decreased. MSI are one of the cheapest brand names but with exceptional quality products
They'll have plenty of company at the bottom of the cliff, i.e., Bud Light?😆😆
My Crosshair x670e Extreme was killed by the 1410 update. It will run for 20-50 seconds and completely lock up. Downgrading back has failed. Pretty mad about this right now.
I'm glad you kicked Barnacules to the curb. What a fucking flake!
I find this kind of strange, as when I put in the wrong timings for my ram through Ryzen Master (which I told Asus) and couldn't boot my machine, they were great about replacing my motherboard.  Could be a regional thing, as I live in Canada, but I have had nothing but good experiences with Asus.  Again, could just be a regional thing.
Does this effect the z690-f???
I guess I'm lucky. I have an ASUS motherboard. It has been good for me so far.
Something that worries me is the many "unless they turn this around" in the comments. it's over, there's no turning around to wait for. Any turnaround at this point should be met with huge suspicion

As a long time ASUS user/fan, I'm gonna plan my upcoming 7800x3d build on MSI.
MSI isn't much better. They tried to bribe influences when they put out crap gaming laptops.
Asus has rubbish support in asia. they literally tell u f off if something goes wrong for at least the past 10 years.
i was actually looking at this board i wanted to upgrade to Am5 Jay What mother board would you recommend With A ryzen 7900x 3D?
My asus mobo just looses all connected usb devices every few weeks
have been using ASRock Steel legend mb without any problems at all
i had a asus a88xm-a mobo dead after a year. For my next/current build i am using msi x570 tomahawk. also asus has really high price across all of their mobos even on the lower end and that is crap as well with zero intresting feature.
I've been an Asus fan for many years, they have been my No 1 preferred brand. Clearly they have started to look after shareholder interests first, as many companies do once they have ridden the wave long enough. Time to pick the next brand I guess
I have Asus and am glad
gonna check the stock prices of ASUS just out of curiosity because the people that buy their products watch the channels of the content creators and that affects their $$$
This has been my experience with asus for 20 plus years. I had always heard asus was the one to get but after 3 different problematic boards i bought an MSI and now I have an ASRock and I couldn't be happier.
👏👏👏
I’ve recently been running into issue with my 2 month old prime z790 A and now all this info coming out really worries me
I used to have asus zenfone and their laptop, this was before rog was a thing, around 2013 i think? Yes they was teribble back then for warranty so that why i avoid them. Seriously i think rog was just cosmetic than quality
dammm asus wtf
I feel I got burned with my z690 DDR4 gaming  board. The first bioses were not stable at all, and the standard settings put way too much voltage to everything. Really expected if I bought a $600+ motherboard the settings would have been optimised.   Good to see it confirmed that they don't care, maybe Ill give asrock a go next time.
1:12 "say hey, keep your "Stuff"…" Video editor needs a raise .
damn I have an old Asrock motherboard and it won't let me turn off the OC lol stuck at 4GHz or more on my 8th gen i7 loool
Wow, ASUS gave me the run-around with their Armoury Crate installing automatically - it was disabled in BIOS - and without my permission. They basically just said sorry but just keep eying what we keep telling you. I bought an MSI board. Still have the one with that issue but oh well.
Jay, thank you for your candor on ASUS.  Sad to see ASUS in thisbstate, but you almost certainly saved a lot of builders a lot of heartache. I have a lot of ASUS laptops and mobos in this house but looks like that's coming to an end.
Asus is litterly encouraging you to destroy you computer components because then they HAVE to replace them Legally under Warrenty
ASUS followed Samsung and Intel in the sense they rested on their name.
Over the past 20 plus years I've had more issues with Asus and MSI products than AsRock, Gigabyte, Biostar, DFI, and Epox. The only Asus products that worked correctly was their monitors. The motherboards and graphics cards have never worked correctly or flat out died long before their warranty ran out with absolutely ZERO support from the company.
My ASROCK z690 Phantom Gaming 4/D5 has been great.  I have no problem with it. And my ROG fans are great.
I had 2 Asus 24in monitors from 2013 that i dual screen and my last outdated mother board is a Asus Prime B450 and ive been happy. What happened Asus i thought id be able to still love ya products and upgrade to ya products...
Asus has been bad for years,   thing is  I thought Asus was the shit when the Hero VIII was new   good quality and good price,    not impressed with anything newer
This is frusterating... Looks like my next build is going to be not ASUS.
Lol when the lower end motherboard maker the parent company buys makes better board than the original brand from the parent company
Republic of Gacha
Perfect Jay!   More need to do this.
Lifetime ASUS user here they just lost
Five 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Jay!!!!!
Bravo
Much respect Jay, after this decision!
100% agree with this. I have an Asus maximus 9 hero (bought years ago now). Came to me with the audio drivers not working with the board. Flashed in the fix Asus support gave me. FRIED MY AUDIO PORT (aux). Got a hold of them again, they said there was nothing i could do because i modified the board and it voided the warranty. I have to get audio for my speakers from my aux port on the back of my monitor....
"Recalls are supposed to be loud"... have you met manufacturers? Unless it's life threatening airbag stuff no-one will put it out loud, just a note on their website that you should be checking xD
Good to see you and Steve speaking up about this. Then you've got shills like UFDTech talking crap...
I feel you JAY Asrock is KICKING butt
This is why i watch JayzTwoCents
Hey, happy to hear that ASUS is finally getting caught on something like this. My gaming laptop has been having issues from day 1, and no matter how many times I update it, switch it out, or get it repaired, the laptop refuses to work properly. I've been using it for 3 years now, but I have some weird workarounds for it. Example: I can't play a media format sometimes in the forefront while also having a game running. I'd have an 80% performance loss. If I put it into the background, it fixes itself. A good way to recreate it is Facecheck's ads and LoL, though YouTube and Twitch can cause it too.
Asus is in decline for sure, the last time I had an issue with them was with a motherboard that has .... and I kid you not (I can provide you with video or picture of this thing) an INVERTED front panel connectors/pins, when I built my pc I had to figure out the actual location of power switch and reset etc with screwdriver,  and no I didnt contact support for replacement, it was covid and I had no PC to work on
They should not be this arrogance when dealing with problems, at the very least. The problems are happened all the time, that's normal, but if it happened they should at least take responsibility, but they want to save face first, I have nothing to say.  Maybe waited for a bit longer, they will make a fix quietly after the news died down, like they always did. It's not a good practice but I think I should wait for it.  I've been using Asus motherboard since I have entered PC building. I have a lot of their board since 440BX until Z590 on intel side and from Socket A to AM4 on AMD side and even collect almost the whole lineup of their ROG board since X38 Maximus Extreme. I rarely have any problem with them. But the latest generation have only bad news come out about them. If this generation ended and the problem doesn't really have been mentioned much anymore, I think I still keep collect their products for this generation onward, but if they're still not putting themselves together in next generation as well, maybe I should stop althogether. Still, I think they already know what they should do but it's only hope at this point.
I will not be buy ASUS again.
Are the B650E boards okay? I had bought one before this all came out and haven’t used it yet
So if not ASUS then which one is the one to buy?
Someone call the fire department, ASUS just got BURNED!
Somehow I totally missed their response… I guess I’ll be excluding ASUS in future builds… ugh… now the ASUS Ally looks like a risky purchase
Ain't no QC in the PROC.
You should not accept any money or free products from any vendors - EVER. It leads to a conflict of interest. I must wonder if you would have fired ASUS if your sponsorship contracts were completed in January. I wonder what other brands are giving you grief, but you _need_ their money.
Good call Jay  Anecdotally as I have a ProArt z490 MB and all this talk about drivers, I was curious whether there were any updates I should know about for my board... hey wtf there isn't a single page on the Asus websites, regardless of region, that have any drivers for my MB, there isn't even a product page as though they never made and sold it. Currently the only boards that have drivers available are: Z790, Z690, B660, B760, all others are greyed out.  Asus MB devision have clearly lost their collective minds... may the lawsuits begin.
Yeah ASUS, about that warranty thing you just pulled, that won't fly in EU.
Yes, have also rough problem with the Support years ago only bought one Bord and again between and again crappy Support, that will never happen to me again, no more Asus Produkts
I’ve stood by ASUS products for years.  I’m with you, Jay! Until they start standing by their products and taking care of us, their customers…I’m out, ASUS!
Well i used to love them my Strix 970 vs built like a tank and i had it for 6 years even i sold it
I feel so much better not having bought an asus motherboard last week for my first build. Thank you for taking about this, Jay
I think he should keep reviewing Asus Boards but don't use them personally if he feels that way.  I've had 6 expensive Asus Boards without any issues.
My x370 Asus board has been dying and the memory support sucked. Switched to x670 ASRock and this just solidifies my choice was the right one
Im kinda glad i didn't upgrade yet. Im still rockin AM4 with a 1080ti😂 still great in my opinion.
This whole debacle sucks.  But, at least you stand by us consumers.  Thanks for that.
on laptop side. i have seen many Asus X412 and X409J with intel 10/11th or ryzen 3/5 died. just a few months after warranty expired.  mostly the problem is the cpu side. if you used heat gun on it fo a few seconds. it will run again. for a few hours until it died again.  in contrast. laptop from either acer, lenovo or hp with same exact cpu. doesn't have that problem. well actually some of their other products does have that problem. it just happen at less frequency.  also. asus laptop cooling system is kind of a joke. long distance relationship between fan and heatsink plate that didn't used any heatpipe to move the heat away at all. can't even keep R3 2200U below 87°C under heavy load.  that heatsink design is actually already exist with asus older products such as X441U that makes i3 6006U runs at almost 80-85°C at gaming load. while the other brands that used heatpipe could hold that i3 at 70°C under gaming load. even their X441B that equpped with A9. sometimes cannot boot to windows due to overheating .  bruh. i do have several other asus laptop. mostly from Haswell and Ivy Bridge era. it does run better than newer asus systems. and the quality feel better too.
Wow I'm impressed, to turn away their business is a serious commitment. Hats to Jay for standing up for what's right.
Some of the issues with Asus are why I switched away from Asus to another MB manufacturer for my latest build. I once bricked a system with an Asus bios update.
x570 dark hero which is an expensive board still has USB disconnect issues when PCI lanes get saturated.
i've been happily buying asus for years—since before 2010. bought the tuf x670e as part of my upgrade to AM5. when I read about everything that was going on with the X3D, I went to update the bios. saw the disclaimer that the beta bios voided the warranty. it was also the only bios listed on the page available. so ridiculously scummy.   i'm never buying asus again. absolutely decimated my reliance on their brand.
You know shit is real when Jay's video doesn't end with the fart sound.
Man I'm so sad... I want to upgrade my 8 year old system but there are SO MANY things that can go wrong and there are SO MANY different components... it's so confusing :(  I don't have much money and I want it to spend well, but after diving into this whole PC building topic I feel super insecure...
This is insane back in 2015 they were the goat
I'm shocked, because I've had Asus motherboards since I've started building, and have had zero issues with their Motherboards.  I am a bit disappointed because I've been looking around for new components to upgrade from my current build which is a Asus ROG Crosshair VI Hero, and now I'm having second thoughts about going with Asus now.  I hope for Asus' sake, they do a 180 and fix their issues and make a comeback, or replace whatever higher up pencil pushers are making these decisions.
Idk wtf you're talking about, ASUS has the best RMA compared to any other brand.
Its great to see someone like Jay, and his team, really making a stand with something like this. It is the sort of thing that us consumers usually have to just cop.. personally i will be replacing my current plan to build  with an ASUS board with AsRock or similar.
As someone who is currently sporting an asus tuf board for zen 3, I wonder if I need to be worried?
Seems like asus caught a variant Intel's previous 'complacency' bug.
ASUS RMA sucks.  Just did a new build.  Two bad boards before finally one without issues.  They keep getting insanely expensive and quality goes down.
Really wish EVGA would jump into the AMD mobo game with current hardware. We're running low on good component brands who stand by their pproduct.
I love asus but i really does feel like they are sticking to their high horse bc i had a problem with one if their motherboards a while back im not no big youtube influencer any of that but i do build computers and i sent in a problem basically all they told me is go thro ur normal pc resolve issues like you would do with any issue you would get with a customer repair service and it ended up begin a bios issue that went i kinda lost respect for them as well i have a laptop from asus i bought it has been solid but seems like their newer stuff is crap thank you jay for just laying it out on the line
Stay with AMD so we can see it it's stable. Thanks.
When I was building my new PC I went with the the ROG edition Lian Li case and I wanted to go with a matching Asus ROG motherboard.  I wanted to do this and then name it ROGue One. (I did that anyway but a matching mobo with ROG would have made that cooler!) However, the ROG case has 4 front USB 3.0 ports (type A) and one USB C front port. I couldn't find any damn Asus motherboards that had two USB 3 headers on them unless I went with the stupidly expensive stuff.  MSI came to the rescue with a several options that had two USB 3 headers on the board.  This was kind of my first sign that Asus wasn't really giving a crap when their own colab's with other manufacturer's didn't even have good compatibility.
I was a big Asus fanboy around the early 2010's era and it's such a shame to see how far they've fallen and to add insult to injury is that I'm not a fan of any other major hardware vendors (mobo/gpu) except for EVGA and given that they've stepped away from GPUs, my only option I'm comfortable with these days is to just buy first party models.   One other note I would like to add is that I've only been a fan and avid watcher of your content for the past year or 2 so I'm not sure the other vendor you're referencing but I was disappointed to see you platforming Asrock's products semi-recently given the whole reviewer debacle that occurred. I will never buy any product from them no matter the quality or price based purely on principle so when I see something from them in (anybody's) videos I immediately tune out. This is just one guy's stance and matters little but I do stand behind that stance and I'm sure I'm not alone in that.
Damnit ASUS why'd you have to Fu*K around? Now you have to find out!
I'm glad you're doing this, but I'm just hoping they learn from it. Asus makes some really good stuff, and I've had no problems with any of it in the 15 years I've been building PC's. Let's hope they change for the better and you can come back.
After the LAST issues and problems they gave you AND Steve, I went with a Gigabyte for my last build... glad I did, they sunk below that now. No problems so far.
"We've done stuff"
After having watched your and Steve's videos and owning an ROG Crosshair X670E Hero with a 7900X I will never buy another ASSUS product again. I paid more than AU$1,200 for my useless MB. Very bad customer relations. I will be sure to tell all of my friends and colleagues also to stay away from ASUS products. I didn't even mention the ROG Premium Ethernet cables (2 of them) that never worked. Shame on you ASUS. MSI from now on.
Jay just cut a badass WWE promo right here lol sucks this kind of thing is happening now with a lot of different products (not just pc related). QC for damn near everything has shot way down in recent years.
In the last 20  years  got two bad  Asus boards. Never from other brands
Always had a bad roll with ASUS products and customer support. They have become overconfident with their sales and defective products.
Sounds a lot like a Intel mind set for Asus now !
As the general techie in my area I usually have a huge influence on what my family, friends and neighbours buy for their laptops and desktops and a range of other gadgets. And like me many of us techies watch channels like Jayz2cents. We can make the difference by for example in this case, NOT recommending ASUS and making these massive companies feel the sting and neglect that they have brought to their consumers.
NOOOOOO!!! I have everything ASUS! your busting my balls here J!
MSI all the way. Armoury Crate is terrible anyway. Cancelled my ROG ALLY pre-order too. How does some idiot smash that many pins on a socket?? XMP is so much better than Expo.
Sadly ASRock will likely forever be on my do-not-buy list due to multiple issues with a z87 extreme6 board which ultimately ended up with them ghosting me.  I have a Gigabyte laptop and the quality of that has be very underwhelming with poor fit and finish, constantly crashes and more, so they aren't high up.  And now it looks like ASUS won't be in my next build whenever that happens.  Options are very limited and everything seems like a gamble and all these companies senior management are looking to cut corners.
Jay thank you so much for putting this out there. The fact that you are willing to fire a sponsor in the interest of protecting us consumers speaks volumes. I am picking parts for my first gaming build and had the Asus Prime B550m as my MB. It took me less than five minutes to find and replace it with a MSI Mag B550M Motor. Thank you for saving me from perhaps a huge headache/mistake with Asus.
I guess I'm the exception here.. I've never had a problem with ASUS RMA support.  But, the issues highlighted here will be a consideration in my purchases of future ASUS parts.
Love your channel BUT, you dont pay for any of this stuff PLUS you have made a living from all this free stuff in the past. Sorry no.  3 or 4 walls of MoBos,, please gimme a break. Try working with Asus instead of abandoning one of your freebies. Haters can hate all you like .
I commented on GNs newest video regarding my experience with Asus. I sent my Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme for repairs because my system became unstable. PC worked fine for first 3 days and then later it started freezing, restarting and shutting down for no reason. Anyways, Asus has my motherboard for over 1 week and received no communication from them. I'm pretty sure the board damaged my 7800X3D because I can see faint burn marks or stains under the CPU so now I have to RMA my 7800X3D and hope none of my other components got damaged. Good stuff, also had to pay $28 shipping to send $1000 motherboard for repairs after having the board for about 2 weeks, troubleshooting and trying auto/default settings, latest BIOS, up to date OS, drivers with no luck. This sucks...
i havent seen anyone cover the MSI leak recently. have you covered it yet?
My ASrock X370 Taichi is running since August 2017, no issues at all.  Gonna have a Taichi again coming with the Ryzen 8000 Series.
I'm glad I saw this before building our 2 new PC setups.   Also can I have some of your less beat up stuff that you won't be using?  New PC stuff is expensive lol  I doubt it but you need know. XD
Damn I jumped bought a z790 strix. Haven’t opened it. Now I better check the pins. 😂😂
I've never really been a strong supporter of Asus... Good thing there is still some competition in the tech market.
Shame. Asus used to make some really good mobos and were known to be good back in the 2000-2010's
its also pretty hilarious that they don't mention anything about the beta bios affecting warranty unless you click the description. any normal person would be like hey look a new update.. read the important bullet points that are right in front of you then proceed to install it.. the fact that that is hidden behind a "show more description" button is pretty poor too
Damnitt mann......Love  you man!! Just.. keep ..being you..
I recieved my strix Z690-E with bent pins, brand new in the box and when I did the rma it cost me an additional $150 because it wasn't covered. I paid it rather than having to buy another board.
I just built a ROG Strix B650E-F Wifi Gaming with a Ryzen 9 7900X. I feel like a fool now. I talked to Amazon, and they said they will take it back. I told them about the issues, and they said they will flag their boards. The retailer MUST put pressure on ASUS!!!!
....aaaand 0 fuks were given by ASUS Corporate
I've had my own troubles with ASUS and their terrible RMA process for a monitor. I've been through 3 of the same monitors and now the one they left we with has a dead pixel and they refuse to replace it. I just hate how bad their QC has been over the past few years. A premium monitor shouldn't have a dead pixel.
You are right it is Asus boards causing problems best to dump them i have had same issues with Asus switched to MSI ,Gigabyte , Asrock no issues it has to do with ram timings on Asus they are not stable enough still their bios sucks they are really bad a bios coding and anything software related. Really post a beta bios that has voltage insatiability issues, ram timing issues i no long use them as well in builds.
I've always bought Asus motherboards going back to LGA775, including my current x470 but ASRock or Gigabyte will get my money next time. MSI is still in my doghouse too for trying to pay off YouTubers to keep reviews positive and scalp their own products.
I've been a ASUS die hard for the past 20 years. The last 2 boards I got had issues which seemed really odd to me. They were builds for friends, so just got new boards a delt with it later but I'm pretty PO right now.
Thanks Jay!
"Thank god I have an MSI board in there." 10 min after filming: MSI hacked, unpatachable mobo security flaw in the wild.
Respect +2
Thank You. I have been using ASUS for years. I am starting a new build soon. Time to look at other brands.
Msi are just as bad
Sounds more like ASUS is just fed up with AMD and there dodgy CPU's
ASUS - man... used to be one of my go-to.  I guess it's MSI and Gigabyte now...
Idk man I’ve been on intel with asus for years and it’s been smooth
I used to be an Asus fan for years. However, in the past 5 years, I have become a ASRock fan. I have had to help my buddy help RMA 3 Asus Prime boards for his new Intel build. The last board even took his CPU and memory out.
the bud light of mobos.... kek
My current PC is basically an all ASUS PC, I used to trust that the brand would keep its quality high but in the last 5 or so years the prices keep going up and the quality has either stayed the same on some products or went down. Now that EVGA isn't making GPUs anymore I don't even know what GPU manufacturer to buy from. I already don't even want to buy NVIDIA anymore after I essentially got screwed over with the 3070.
Asrock has some great motherboards
No wonder we have  dead and refurbished products  from asus in algeria.  Now  ROG stands for  republic of gaymers
I was going to get an MSI motherboard but all this PC channels convinced me to get an ASUS 🤦‍♂
Wow, sad. I always like ASUS stuff, I think they more often than not have the best looking hardware but all this is just dumb. Unless I hear anything different I’m going MSI, at least for the motherboard.
Evga card sitting behind him like... MISS me yet fkrz 😎
it only takes a few days to completely destroyed your reputation. Maybe even less
Man, I've been  trying to understand everything going on and after watching this...its very disappointing on Asus' part. Have a B650 Strix-F in my current system and was just starting to look at parts for a new build later this year with Asus as my 1st choice. Gonna have to find a different brand to go with unless Asus turns this around.
Man this make me really concerned seeing as i was seriously considering buying the their new Asus Rog ally....
Ex-Asus cust omer who supports your position.
LOL just dont by AMD is all i am hearing
I have the MSI Z790 Edge with 13700f also having in game sound issues loud cracking then no sound.
I agree.  I’ve been building PCs for over 20 years.  Had phenomenal stability with EVGA boards but in 2020 I ventured out to ASUS ROG and went with the Rampage VI Extreme Encore MB ($750 USD).  Hughe mistake.  Still running but can never just turn on the PC and run.  Always Detect Memory or Load VGA BIOS boot messages on the OLED display.  Takes 6 - 10 restarts to finally boot. Flashed BIOS v1401 but that didn’t change a thing.  Running 64GB of g.skill Trident Z 4000 DDR4 memory ( 8 x 8).  Just funky shit happening with this MB.  Would have returned the MB but in 2020 you were just glad to actually have received what you purchased.  I am still running an EVGA 2080TI and have read posts about incompatibility with this card but ASUS publicly announced BIOS upgrades would fix this issue.  My ass they did!  Lol. I would have scrapped this damn PC but have so much $$$ in it I just can’t -  remember I built this demon PC in June 2020.  Not cheap to do.  Hell the CPU is an Intel 10920x and that was $1k in 2020.  So live and learn.  Jay, based on my nightmarish experience I will have to 100% concur with your decision.
At this point I’m buying a NUC and will test eGPU with it.
I bought an ASUS laptop in 2015 and it’s still kicking. It’s frustrating that companies get a great rep then just put out over priced subpar products.
This is EXACTLY why I still take everytbing you say seriously. Because so far you've always been honest wether it hurts you and the team or not. It's a shane asus is losing one of the top pc tech reviewers at this point. And for good reason. I've been a lifetime fan and user of mostly asus products and I've run into an issue with an x299 tuff mark 1 board that just stopped working on me after I turned it back on after it being powered off for 2 years. I was considering getting a 12th or 13th gen intel with a prime board and now I'm considering msi or asrock instead. Within the last 3 years I've spent $5k on rog laptops. Had to warranty my newest one 5900hx w/ rtx3070 from microcenter because of a display cable failure and keyboard keys that stopped functioning. And they returned my unit after being rma'd with a whole new top plate (keyboard track pad assembly) AND THE MOUSEPAD ISNT FLUSH. The top right corner of my track pad is sunk down. They fixed it as fast as possible quality be dammed. (And I know they swapped the whole unit cause when my laptop came back to me it no longer had a worn down trackpad, and the ryzen and rtx stickers were gone. It's a shame. But Jay, you're right. They've climbed the ladder into the ionosphere and can't even see what's happening with their brand back on earth. Shame. Keep up the great content guys!
I just had an X299 motherboard fail due to an issue with power. I sent it in because it was under warranty, and ASUS took it in. They fixed the main issue, but somehow the CPU pins were bent in transit. It definitely wasn't due to my shipping because I was very careful. So I had to pay $130 to 'fix' the board which I agreed because the CPU pins are not covered by the warranty. I assumed I would get a replacement. They did, except, it wasn't really a replacement. It was a Z590 board, which forced me to replace my 10980XE CPU. I also have to drop four of my old sticks of my memory because the new board only has four slots. I had all eight slots populated on my old board. So now if I want 64GB again, I need to replace all my memory in order to get back there. This was my workstation and not really very old. Now I am forced to spend a bunch of money just to get back to something near my old build. My wife hates my spending as it is, and this is just too much.
I am curious if folks feel it is all ASUS or just their mother board side of things? I ask because I was considering one of their computer displays but may reconsider...
My first and only asus board I have now is a pos. Over 20 yrs of building and it has been the worst board I've ever used.
Thought it was just me having issues with how Asus are doing things especially with their latest firmware update on my oldest PC. Updated to PRIME B350-PLUS BIOS 6042 BIOS and now I have to do a hard shut off after a cold boot just to get to Windows successfully. Granted that this is a very minor inconvenience, I'm pretty sure that there is something else that's broken in that update that I am yet to discover
Didn’t even know Asus had customer service department 😂
Me with 4 different ASUS products in my system right now:      *D A M N*
I just got an ROG motherboard for my 13900k... random blue screens happen to me too, think I'm gonna look at another motherboard instead.
I already write them off for me about 3 months ago. Had a horrible rma experience, never again asus
Thanks Jay...
well, i feel better about my choice now, even tho i'm on the intell side of things. almost bought an ASUS ProArt B760-CREATOR D4 but decided to go with the ASRock Z690 EXTREME WiFi 6E. had a bit of an issue at the start, but ASRock responded to my email quickly, with the info i needed to get everything working. best customer service i've experienced yet from the computer world. and now i see all this going on... yeah, i'm glad i chose as i did.
I'm currently worried about my own build even though my mb is a X670-P Prime. I just don't want that to happen after waiting so many years to build my pc. I lost money on that board and I've accepted.
Thank you 🙏
Respect
I was Asus loyal for about 20 years. Starting with a thunderbird socket A where you could do the pencil trick to unlock the multiplier. Their quality control in the past 5-7 years has tanked.
Tell us how you really feeeeeel !!! Jay:)
This is why i always buy used motherboards on ebay. They're  cheaper and i know they'll work!
Tbh I'm surprised all u tech guys havnt noticed that asus board fudge things so there mobo makes better benches out of the box vs the competition like forcing the boost clocks to stay boost longer ect ect ram frequency ect ect ect
MSI source code just got hacked bro be careful with any bios/update etc
I got a Gigabyte B650E board for my 7800X3D over Asus this time round having using their MB for more than 2 decades. Shame they're more of a marketing than a hardware company these days
So I guess Y'all won't be reviewing the New ROG Handheld? Lmao
I was going to buy the Asus Rog Strix MB on my intel 14000 series build. Guess I will go elsewhere ...  I don't want MSi.  So... Gigabyte, ASRock... guess that's what I'm left with.
Thanks for sharing. I'm starting to plan my next upgrade, I guess I'll avoid ASUS for the next couple of years.
Oh noes!!! The "influencer" got pricey boards FOR FREE and doesn't find the fact that he had to contact them "acceptable". Poor guy....
nobody give a shit no more from your Dunkin donuts coffee maker to company selling you shit its like this every were no one cares.
This is big decision. Kudos
Thanks for doing the right thing and advocating for the consumer Jay!  You showed how much integrity you have.
This is the exact reason why I stopped building systems using ASUS 15 years ago. Getting burned by several obviously faulty boards in a row, having to wait for the RMA only to get back mostly faulty boards and any that did work died within a year. No brand is a saint but their quality levels have always been a roller-coaster 🎢🤷‍♂
This is great time to be a tech YouTuber. Asus I’ll take your ad money hit me up baby😘
First time buying Asus this year and I immediately regret it.
Oof, the "But you don't care" was a nice touch.
My 7700x & Asus x670e-a build has been a nightmare. Would not recommend.
I moved away from ASUS when upgrading to Z690 and finding out they had no BIOS flash on their basic boards. Easy swap to MSI.
I applaud your decision and reasoning behind it. I never judge a company based on problems with their devices, no matter how good a company is, things sometimes go wrong. I bought an Elegoo Saturn 2 resin printer and less than six months later half the screen failed. I contacted them and after providing some pictures they sent me a replacement that they got to me, from China, in five business days! They also apologized and I told them how a company responds to problems speaks volumes about the quality of the company and I am happy with my purchase.
Now this is how consumers can force companies to either do better or go out of business.  There are too many companies out there that would love to have our business to put up with this from a crap company.
Are you goin to have a "fire sale"?
I just preordered the handheld this morning 🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥
I mean they’ve ruined their own brand with bad products. My laptop has been overheating since day one and they said it’s working as intended. Really? A 1500 dollar laptop overheating and throttling is ok for you? Strix Scar II - i7 10750h, rtx 2070…The only asus product I still own is an old b350-f motherboard. Stay away from that brand. I’m so happy people like Jay and Steve are realizing that Asus is no longer a premium brand but a dogshit packed into a nice box.
As a heavy user of Asus motherboards, I've yet to have one kill a CPU and every motherboard I have starts with a conservative voltage and then you can adjust it however you like however to get above 1.5v which the max the manufacturers of the particular CPUs in question I used,  you have to set a physical jumper, otherwise the BIOS won't let you, so frankly I don't understand your issues unless you are just grossly incompetent.  But you're the same people who push AMD CPU's that melt down if you don't have adequate cooling for the clock speed and computational load rather than simply de-clocking like Intel so yea so much for your credibility.
Tegridy!
Well this certainly made me think twice about getting that new ROG Ally handheld...customer service is a big factor for me when I buy a product. It's the reason I gave up on playstation after the PS1.
I still regret the notebook I bought 10 years ago... thing broke down frequently, followed by a long repair process that only could be done by ASUS (no repair parts on market).  Never again.
Props to you guys
to anyone thats installed asus armoury crate, good luck removing it, i had tried it for like 2 days for my ssd lighting and even after using the uninstalling tool i had to kill processes in task manager jsut to delete more residual files that would stay active and start on pc startup and it would try to repair itself and reinstall those files, it is genuinely virus like, and i had to remove it bc on top of it just being complete ass it would bluescreen my pc
Thanks for the heads up. Year ago I quit buying Sony for the same reason. Even though they are probably fine now, they lost me for life. My last purchase a couple years ago was a ROG laptop. It's been fine, but I'm looking for a big desktop system now and I will avoid ASUS.
I'm a noob that's been consuming your content for 2 weeks.  I was sold on ADUS motherboards.  Now I need a recommendation.  Is there another brand you trust?  I need to build Intel 12th gen for Davinci Resolve that no longer runs on my 9-year old JP laptop.  I'm told I need PCIe 4.0 or higher + 32GB min to run Fusion.  Also need several SSD slots to separate OS, Cache, & project storage.  What motherboard do you suggest?
I'm totally with you on this one Jay. Dropping such a huge sponsor and passing up on the revenue and perks is quite significant. Massive respect!  I just got an ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A Gaming motherboard with a 7800X3D less than 3 weeks ago, just about a week after the CPU lanched. After watching Steve's videos and now yours, I have massive buyer's remorse.  I'm on the latest BIOS right now and everything seems to be working fine (for now!), but all of this kerfuffle has me worried sick! I can't afford to buy another motherboard/CPU combo if this one fries, so what are my options here? The board has not failed, (yet) so I can't RMA it,  obviously... Then if it does fail and Asus gives me the runaround with their RMA crap, then I'll be out both a motherboard and a CPU!  I guess I'd be better off just buying an MSI or Gigabyte board, eat the loss and be done with it. Sure I'd be out some $600 canadian rupees, but that still beats burning up both the motherboard AND the CPU. What sucks is that I don't have 6 "Sir Robert Borden's" lying around after spending nearly 3k on a brand new system!!  The fact that a company lets their customers go through this kind of stress and uncertainty, with very little communication and no action whatsoever to reassure the users, says a lot about how they actually care.
Well, are you going to blow it all up?  lol
shame, but if people want change, it may be the only way to make it happen.
I have that exact model of said Asrock taichi board. I love the thing, had an Asrock PG Velocita b550 previous to it and no issues with it either.
ASUS support has never been great but this is insane and over the top B$ ... I'm done with them too now.  Fortunately my B550 appears to be fine so far but who knows?
just did a build with an Asus motherboard 🤣🤣🤣
*Republic Of Garbage* 😅🤣😂
by no way an excuse for the highhorsing BUT the chinese are REALY fuking with them in the logisitics and it space....for a few years now...and from the latest Xi statements and troop trainings i can only asume that the digital onslaugth on them keeps mounting. After all its way easier to invade a coutnry of its economicly declining ...but thats just my twocents :P
I want to thank you for making this video. It has been very confirming, because I have also completely dropped Asus for my experience with the company. I saved and saved to buy myself a higher end laptop, telling myself year after year I'll get one next year. Finally I saved up enough money to buy a laptop and because I've always had a good experience with Asus, I dropped $2000 on a Asus Zephyrus M15. I absolutely loved it and I babied it like crazy. One morning I went to use it...   ...and nothing, no power, no charging lights, nothing, it was completely dead.   I took it to an Asus repair depot and they concluded that it was a defective motherboard. Completely a problem on their end... and my warranty? 13 days past the 1 year. The quote for repair? just over $1000!  Half the price of the original laptop just a year after I bought it. I called Asus and I went 3 levels up the chain looking for something, anything that could be done. I'm not blind to the fact that past the warranty date is past the warranty date... but 13 days! The most they were willing to do for me was a 15% discount. it took me years to save up for my computer and I just couldn't bring myself to pay that much more for nothing... I even got the email address of the vice presidents office of Asus Canada and very compellingly summarized my experience and pleaded my case, just to be told "15% is a great deal". Maybe I'm in the wrong, but after that I lost all faith in the company and their product.  (also thanks to anyone who actually read all that, just wanted to put it out there)
My question is, why aren't these companies selling those MB's through their websites other than shareholders like Newegg and Amazon? they keep giving them those products so one day we won't catch them slipping with their products. but always blame the other guy.
A-sus (suspect)
Nah Jay's big Asus will come begging no cap. They need the reach
I'm grateful for my MSI and 7800X3D build.
Well, I bought my first and last Asus board with this AM5 build. Hopefully my Strix B650E-F board doesn't fuck my 7700X up. Got it with a microcenter deal. Should have just paid more and gotten the MSI Carbon as I originally wanted.
I lost all confidence in Asus when I send my 1080ti Poseidon to warranty and got the worst responses. Years ago.
Sounds like a AMD problem should have stayed with intel because never had a problem.
Respect
thank god i never gave them any money
I’m at a loss for words actually. Just a week ago I wanted to upgrade my entire system to 12th gen and I got an ASUS prime motherboard, it was dead on arrival. At first I thought I was my PSU but I just so happen to have another one and I tested both PSUs on my old motherboard and I got a signal on my old board (a rog one) now I’m scared that the board did something to my NEW cpu.  I honestly don’t know what to do at this point, I have always chosen ASUS for both graphics cards and motherboards. I just don’t trust other boards but the main reason and call me shallow on this one, is that I love the aesthetics of the boards. It seems I will have to turn my case so that I can’t see through the glass panel.
Asus was my go to brand for motherboards and graphic cards... until i got my brand new 980ti that shit itself after I tried to hook it up to a tv 2 days after building my brand new system. Newegg gave me the middle finger and I had to send it to asus... got a replacement a month later... i told myself EVGA is my next graphic card brand... well we know where they are now... this friggin sucks. I'll never buy Asus again.
Asus products have had terrible reviews for years,(seriously for close to a decade at least) I never understood why Jay liked using their garbage products.
I have a tuf gaming b550 plus wifi 2 board. About once a month or so I will lose all audio and have no idea why. I tried reinstalling drivers thinking it would help but it hasn't. I even reinstalled windows when I upgraded from the 5600x I originally had in there to the 5900x I have now. And it still happens sometimes. Restarting the computer gets the audio back so I haven't really cared too much because it happens so rarely, but I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the board. After dealing with this, then another issue I had with a board of theirs where the wifi on the board didn't work, and with all the other news on them messing up lately, I decided to not support them anymore unless they get their shit straight and start doing better. It's really frustrating to see companies dig holes like this when they have so much more potential to do better.
yeah i had a bad expirence with an asus laptop had to send it back it was a brick in the end i ended up with eluktronics laptop
this is insane, i feel lucky to have gone with an Aorus X570S board instead of any Asus one. not that Aorus is perfect but damn they set the bar to the lowest.
if you'd told me 10 years ago that ASROCK would be a higher quality company than ASUS by now, i would have laughed and bet my entire life's savings on that being false. but after so many failures on Asus's side eg. customer service, build quality, scummy methods, etc. its hard to even put them in the 'would recommend" category. Other brands have shown that it is completely possible to be a quality manufacturer, AND be in morally good standing such as evga. why cant more companies be like evga?
well, that's a burnt bridge that will never been rebuilt
I have always been a msi guy
Hi, asus has done me dirty as well. I won a contest sponsored by them for one of their routers. They wouldn't send me the prize until I had documents signed by a notary. I believe it costs about $25-50 to hire a notary to sign documents. I am not paying money to get a contest prize that probably won't come in the mail in the end anyways. I have entered many sweepstakes and never was a notary required to claim a prize. Also it was not mentioned in the terms and conditions of the contest that a notary was required to claim the prize.
My experience with Asus has been bad also. I have had 2 boards die, and since switching to MSI, i have had no issues. Im still on a 2600x. With Asus, it was like every 3 years the board would just start going bad. I put one in my moms computer, and it also went bad relatively fast. I just, am not a fan of theirs. Even my monitor I got from them a long time ago. The mg248q. Has tons of issues. Sometimes flickering at high refresh, and other issues. Im just, not a fan of theirs.
Are Asus laptops an exception to this?
Rip. My brand new build is a rx6700xt Asus card and a tuf z690
I have an ASUS x670e-F. I'm not such a fanboy thst I will stand by this as well. My build is table with a 7800X3D but between this and the slew of bad PC ports, I feel like I picked the weing time to go bleeding edge.  ASUS, don't think for a minute that I'm buying another one of your boards after this. I could have got an AORUS or MSI board and chose this not knowing this would be the PR mess it has become.
Respect! Asrock is not big in adverting land, I don't even remember them being featured anywhere.  But my board is "rock" solid 😏 for a few years and it's been running 24-7.  My ssd heatsink fan broke after a few weeks... no questions asked, 2 days I had a new one.
Steve and Jay both that influence Millions of people in the PC world are saying the same thing about ASUS.  That is not good for ASUS at this point.  Right now I think ASUS need to re-think what they are doing because they are going to fail and fail hard!
I abandon Asus back in my Riva tnt 2 days, kept them out of my retail store for 10 years, and 15 years in IT after that, got tired of the "physical damage" excuse for a tnt2, Geforce 256, and countless motherboards. Cant sell stuff too customers or a business environment with the support they offer.
I have had similar issues on two mid-range Asus mobos(AMD & Intel) within the last year(+ my current Asus board).Audio kick-outs & crackles, usb disco’s…going with MSI & EVGA mobos from now on.
I had issues with ASUS mobos back in the Z170 era, and I switched to MSI and Gigabyte and never looked back. I’m glad this was addressed way to go Jay!!
Every other board manufacturer:  “Thanks for the free market share, Asus.”
"I have an MSI board in there, so I'm free and clear from all this crap moving forward."  Narrator: _"But what Jay didn't remember was that MSI's secure boot firmware private signing keys had been recently stolen and made public."_
Not sure what I should do as a consumer now. But this might explain what's going on with my PC with ASUS ROG Strix X670E-E and 7800X3D. Weird random reboots. My USB wireless headset randomly stops working and only fix it to reboot. And I can't seem to turn off USB power when PC is off, even when I changed settings in BIOS and my GO XLR still lights up the dark when it's off. Not sure if I'll do ASUS or AMD again.
I've always bought ASUS motherboards since my first build 15 years ago. I guess I'll be switching.
thank you for using your platform for good.
and thats why I bought EVGA Jay, get back to what you know!
I do wish EVGA would make motherboards for AMD.
Does this effect asus a4 motherboards like e gaming?
They just rideing on they own coat tails they have been doing shady shit for years all the way back to the fx days
Thanks for the great video Jay! I've had a few issues with Asus products over the last 2 years and I'm glad to know I'm not just being paranoid. I was planning on buying a $500 mb and a $300 psu from Asus, but I'll be looking at altenative options now. Keep keeping it real my guy!!! 💯
So sad. I used to buy only asus. Sounds like its game over for them.
Kudos Jay! I've been saying this for a long time that Asus is absolute moronic brand. Prices are always on "premium" level when other brands does better job. Thank the god for their own downfall!
Now if Linus join in on this Asus  would get the kiss of death on the gaming enthusiast side
I spent nearly $4,000 on an Asus Rog Zephyrus s17 and it had issues for everything from the power randomly shutting off, the sound randomly going distorted and to where it just eventually quit working just over a year after owning it. Of course they didn't want to help resolve the issue. Never again will I get a nAsus product.
I've got a system with an Asus main board that I've been having constant stability issues with ever since I built it. (2021) I've replaced every component except the mobo, CPU, and RAM, with no improvement. It can run just fine for days, and then randomly hard-freeze in the middle of just normal activities that it was fine with 5 minutes before. The only reason I've avoided replacing the mobo is because that's what Windows uses for activation. But now I'm very seriously considering it.
I agreed with your response to their actions.. but gods damn I can't get a break... My ASRock X570 Taichi that only worked on beta BIOSes and polychrome bricking my windows install and their response was uninstall and reinstall it... even after explaining I couldn't get into windows.. so I buy an Gigabyte Aorus Master X570 and a Gigabyte RTX 2070.. and the RMA scandal... End of Feb, the wife and I go Asus as we both bought the Microcenter Strix B650E-F, R9 7900X and DDR5-6000 bundles.... I'm too broke to replace hers and my boards and I don't dare move off the 0821 BIOS due to how unstable 1222 was.... Sadly my pre-ASRock boards were MSI.. and I have a number of dead ones of those... whose left?
Asus...NO
3 or 4 weeks ago I ordered my new Mobo Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme!!!!! I dont know when will arrive but daaaaaaaamn!  what the hell is wrong with Asus, its a Ultra Premium Product  its the same with a lot of brands! holly Cow
I was thinking about buying an asus laptop. Gonna steer clear now.
Just Dayum! I've seen you upset but I NEVER thought I'd see you fire a sponsor. Thank you so much for your integrity, sadly that is lacking but not here. I know you'll do fine.
I hope the motherboard hasn't damaged your CPU.
Customer Satisfaction or even just helping customers have been thrown out the window by most if not all corporate companies. Profits is what they are pushing and everything else does not matter to them
I have the X670E Strix board atm and this is quite alarming... I have enjoyed it so far, but now I have to wonder how long that will last. Hopefully nothing blows up 😐
Thanks for doing things right.
Damn... I've been eyeing the Ally for a while and these revelations about Asus as a company is not looking great. I would have been fine dealing with experimental and in development software as they ironed things out, since the matured hardware was all I was interested in, but not even that is safe it seems... I might just wait on pulling the trigger on that...
My last RMA experience with Asus was god awful, I had to go full blown bad reviews after getting a 4th graphics card back as a refurbished with issues.
Coming from Steve's video I feel more proud as owner of AsRock motherboard Asrock is the only winner emerging from this lol
The only 2 motherboard brands that I've ever used in any of my builds is Asrock or GIGABYTE. Never had any issues with them.
Steve is very much a mainstream media for PC geeks, and sometimes it feel like CNN ... but Jay always felt like you dad sitting down with you telling you "just remember to pull out with asus"
Ouch I was getting ready to build my 5th high end AMD machine in 18 months. I have used Asus for the last 7 years. I am having strange issues with two 7950X, Asus keyboard/mouse.   Now I think it is Asus, not Logitech. Looks like bye bye Asus.
been saying this about asus for the last decade
More than a bit of the blame falls on AMD.  Call it like it is and hold them responsible for crap communications with manufacturers.
What's ASUS smoking? WTF
DAAAAAAMAMMMMMMMMNNNNN
That's why I like ASRock and MSI I haven't had any problems with. (Knock's on Wood)
Thank you for integrity Jay. From another Jay. I gave up on ASUS a long time ago.
You forgot about the defective Z690 Apex with the A channel problem. And a whole batch of that boards released to retail to scam customers, and after people found the problem with memory overclocking, Asus quietly offered RMA.
The sad part is you can buy a MSI or Gigabyte board CHEAPER then a Asus board with better components in it and NOT PAY FOR THE NAME and get OK parts in it.
I bought a Strix-E X570 (or whatever it is called) also based on reputation, thinking well, I had an ASRock, which was okay, but I wanted to treat myself. Well, not quite. From dumb design decisions for looks to problematic BIOS releases ASUS didn't exactly wow me. It's mostly fine, these days, but that took a while. And by the looks of it they have gotten worse and worse. In general ASUS seems to be having trouble on multiple levels. I think I'll just avoid the brand at this point.
This is why gigabyte gets my money has for years
The irony is that ASrock used to be a part of Asus. Looks like the student has become the master.
My current system has a few ASUS components, but it's looking like maybe next build I try a different path.  I had some misfortune with my ROG Strix GPU that had a terrible thermal paste application from factory, leading to shut downs from extreme hot spot temps.
Its really sad because i use to be an asus fanboy but after all this new information my new build will have zero asus.
Your Fired Asus!  I am with Jay on Asrock because I am still running B450M-Pro4 with Ryzen 2600 and I've had ZERO issues for the years I've owned it. Great Job Jay and keep up the awesome and amazing work protecting the little guys that buy tech stuff.
I like Intel.. I like Asus.. They didn't create the AMD chip! Maybe there's more behind the scene between the two companies? But to jump on gamer nexus band wagon and hate the Mobo company that put out a BETA update and gave a warning? Well what if they put it out and there was no warning you would be saying the same thing.. Beta means there's more to come and you know that.. They are also not the only mother board company to have issues. So what have the other brands done? why aren't you talking about them? LOL  get you shit together and talk about the issue as a whole with all brands.. Its also not happening to only 3d chips soooooooo! You need more info on the big picture not just a youtuber that sent his stuff to a lab and has not seen every brand mobo that has had  issue with the same chip. FAN BOI you are!!! make your own content stop biting off game nexus!!!
Asus and MSI were by go-to mobos for more than a decade. But I'm dropping Asus. And being on a fixed income, it may a very long time before I can replace or upgrade either my own machine or the identical one I use for our small country church. But when that day eventually comes, I can pretty much guarantee there won't be anything Asus in it. And that makes for a sad day.
How are they hiding something behind "freedom of information act"? That's meant to make information held by the US federal government publicly available.
I wish there was other white x670e motherboards. I got the prime x670e but I haven't had any problems with the SOC with my 7800X3D. If there was other white motherboard I would absolutely buy them
I "upgraded" to a ROG STRIX board for my 5800X, had tons of problems getting ram stable, got random resets, and my voltage was absurd (vcore) to the point where my AIO couldnt keep it cool. Then I went back to my MSI board, same performance, none of the issues. Ya it isnt as pretty, but I get the same performance with none of the issues. Asus def went down in quality.
well thanks man as a 7800x3d and Asus board owner as for the topic between voided warranties fake AGESA updates failed OCP random voltages idiotic statements like dont use EXPO my vitriol is a bit too high to stay nice now so i will say less
Didn't your original Asus board start it's failure by freaking out until you regressed memory settings? I hope it doesn't degrade your cpu, whatever the problem is.  Steve's findings weren't just about the soc voltages, but their "failsafes" also did nothing to catch the issue once it started cascading.
I personally have had issues with my ASUS PRIME z690p motherboard, almost a full year of being unable to use my system due to rampant instability. Initially I blamed 12th gen instability but after replacing everything but the motherboard i was proven wrong. Then when I contacted ASUS for advice on how to progress, they recommended updating to a Beta bios. Thankfully, I noped out after seeing the warranty void and replaced my board through my original retailer, a far less painful experience than dealing with ASUS
Thank you for the video.   I'm ready to build a new system; the last one was an i-7 Ivy Bridge (3rd Generation!) on an Asus P8Z77-V Pro/Thunderbolt.  I've NEVER updated the BIOS. It's still purring like a kitten - great quality back in the day. Not one single problem.  I want an Asus Prime Z790-A. I want this next build to last as long as my previous one. The reviews I've read look good, so far, but...   ...Asus, you're not inspiring me to commit.
they really became A Sus company... (sorry i had to)
Recently purchase ASUS Swift monitor PG32UQR nothing but problems monitor wasn't working out of the box keeps turning on and off, similar problems to PG32UQ had to go through like seven monitors in order to get a working model. Asus you need to step up the quality control and triple check your products before they get delivered to your customers because this is unacceptable.
Wat? Hey, you know, that this looks like a clickbait!  Asus has normal release bios that fixes voltage issues, well, at least they say it does. For tuf it’s 1413, when 1601 and 1414 are beta. Just use the release bios if you care about warranty. I’m not an asus fan boy, but if you state something, back it up.) Nevertheless, if Msi are still solid boards, gigabyte, asrock and other biostars are total shit with tons of issues!
It's not just the desktop versions, but also their laptops. I've had three ROG Flow X13's that I purchased from Best Buy. One blue screened whenever I revved up the CPU, another lagged whenever I went to tablet mode for several minutes, and the one I have now will freeze key strokes, stop typing, and then throw all the typed keys together randomly jumbled. I've sent it in to Geek Squad twice, and one time they just replaced the WIFI card 😂. Their quality control has crashed into itself somewhere.
I’m pretty sure their RMA department is just a bunch of humans testing refurbished boards. 🤣
It seems like ASUS' communication has gone to oblivion. I have an ASUS B550-E, but after everything going on, I am NOT updating BIOS or ANYTHING related to Armoury Crate, or the ASUS App.
I'm happy my hot water tank blew up and I was forced to hold on on my X3D build. Apparently it worked out, now I need to reconsider my board brand. I wonder who the new go to will be.
well this probably explains the bs thats been going on with my pc the past few months...
All they really had to do was not do or say anything until a real fix was made that works, and let that out. Problem solved. Am I wrong?
Don't dog pile me but damn I have always had brand loyalty to Asus. My dad and I built my first computer with all Asus parts and I have always used them since but I don't think im going to go with them any more.
Meanwhile MSI keep releasing Beta bios non-stop and no one cares, two of my bios was pulled off from their website on top of that msi doesn't even say its beta, you need to figure it out yourself
Are you alan sugar
But what's a solid brand that we should buy instead of ASUS? I had bad experience with MSI, and Gigabyte customer support is famously bad. I don't know much about ASRock. EVGA doesn't seem to make anything other than classified/kingpin for intel. I don't know what I would buy if I had to buy something new now.
Isn't Asrock an Asus (okay, ORIGINALLY) company? Pegatron is generally an OEM for HP junk.  But yeah if it's better than Asus branded stuff that's pretty telling. LOL, the devil's in the details.  :)
I did my first PC build a few months ago and i was considering getting an ASUS motherboard because i thought they were a reputable brand. When i was going to start buying parts Gigabyte had a good sale going on an the board was perfect for what a wanted so i bought that instead and im so happy i did because i've had zero problems.
The "but you don't care" at the end was perfect. Almost daring them to prove you wrong even though they've shown that they don't have any interest in doing that.
ASrock really wasn't bad, even a few years ago, but their bios patches were klunky and their documentation was really hard to follow.
Thank you for remaining honest to yourself and to us viewers of your content.
Ouch! Just wow , bravo jay. Bravo brother.
Asus is a cunning company. When I got my G14, the battery drained like flushing toilet. ( It was later discovered as a BIOS issue). The service center person said that there isn't any recommended guideline on battery life. Then I checked their website and there was really none. Then I realized that those messages, outstanding battery life, USB 4 support were delivered by influencers. This is smart to minimize the commitment on printed tech spec while leveraging marketing on all product differentiations. 😕
Building PCs for years. Never had an issue with Gigabyte. Asus is another story. Returned 3 motherboards back because of QC. Personally, I would never buy another Asus MB.
Thank you, it's clear that the sentiment and reason for making this video is because at the heart of this is your care for the consumers.  I don't plan on making a new build anytime soon but it's always nice to know that the resources are there to get honest information on these very expensive products.
I've had no end of memory stability issues running 4x16GB in a ROG Strix B550-E, I wonder if it's actually a motherboard issue rather than a 3900XT Memory Controller issue as I had been assuming.
In november, I purchased an AMD system: Ryzen 9 79550X with an ASUS mobo. After tons of trying to figure out weird problems, it turned out the mobo was defective. I replaced it with another (better) ASUS product. Same thing happened! I have since switched to an ASRock and my machine is now as solid as an ASRock (so far).
man this really sucks to hear about how bad ASUS is sucking. i got to pick some other board to build now
Woooow I really appreciate what u did for us and others. Asus is a big name but u showed everyone who's bigger and it's about time this happened as us the customer are the ones that get shatt on..ty for this most helpful information this makes it a lot easier now for my first build so msi or AsRock will be getting my money BTW ASUS YOUR FIRED!!!!!!!!!!!!!💯💯
Yeah.. I'll stick with my b550 and 3700x thanks.
Since you hate them now can I have your Asus Rog Ally?
Damn wtf ASUS. They made such a big brand with ROG. Got everyone spending more when they don't really need to (like Apple). Now they just throw it away. I hate MSI too.. so what's left? Asrock and Gigabyte?
Ot sucks to see asus fall from greatness. In 2019 I got a ROG 2070 and ROG Z390 mobo. It was top quality brand at the time. The only issue I had was that I couldn’t overclock my ram without crashing
so if asus motherboard are bad all asus hardware is bad  ? even gpus ?
I think a pretty good sign of a brand don't giving a shit about consumers is when their low end prodcuts are straight garbage... And oh boy if their prime stuff isn't the worst kind of trash out there I don't know what is it.
Jay over here making pearls with sand in his vah-jayjay. Lol j/k
I lost confidence and respect for Asus a couple of years ago when they refused to provide any support for a laptop I bought...What was supposedly a "NEW" "Gaming laptop " has been completely unusable for games...I paid >$1,000 for what's basically a normal non gaming laptop...I bought it during Covid because I couldn't find any parts to build a simple gaming desktop...and I got royally F*cked...now I'm stuck with a laptop I can't use for gaming and can't sell because it's defective
I bought an ASUS board for my i9-7960X system I made several years ago... and I bought it without hesitation based on their reputation and trust I had in them... Next PC I build, I will be REALLY hard pressed to even consider their boards at this point- not after this BS.
different industry, different companies, but that final "But you dont care" caused me to have a flashback to a similar situation where i had to publicly cut ties with a company... they really dont care.. but this issue seems to be staying "lit" , and may be the final straw.  keep doing what you are doing man.. we appreciate ya
"I suggest you start climbing down the ladder now so you have a softer landing" is such a great line. RIP ASUS.
now im having 2nd thoughts on the Ally especially its their v1 of handheld. maybe ill wait 6 months for the kinks to be fixed or just buy the deck now.
I've used ASUS motherboards for over 2 decades, including my current TUF-Gaming X570-Pro. Next motherboard will not be an ASUS.
WoW, just when I was about to give Asus a chance again and try other hardware out other then EVGA. This happens 🙃
Asus getting cancelled in real-time, and it's absolutely warranted. Every brand is going to have issues, but it's the way ASUS has handled things for years now that has me looking at other vendors for my next build.
all I hear is WHEN YOU SEND ME A FREE BOARD MAKE SURE ITS NEW!!!
Ive used ASUS since building my first pc in 2001, I noticed them slipping more and more over the last few years, so when i went to build my new 7000 based system, i went ASRock's Taichi board. I can echo Jay's comment. It has been flawless. Very happy I chose them this time around. Just kinda sucks that my two favorite brands ASUS and EVGA arent really options anymore.
Good job, Jay! Enough!
Damn! Capitalism is becoming ridiculous!
Well said Jay 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This is the same as the Covid jab! Get use to it!!!!
Thank you J . We need to stand up.
With your nearly 4 million subscribers Jay and Steve with nearly 2 million subscribers, who a large majority are going to be people that know a thing or two about computers and have influence over the parts friends, family and their own customers choose, Asus should care and be scared, but the word is going to spread FAST and business is going to be lost for them. Hopefully their hubris will yield to humility and they right the ship quick like a bunny.
i only buy ASUS probably since 2006, is this ONLY overclocking? Because i never overclock. Or is this actually an issue stock standard default settings? Im leaning towards ASROCK for my next motherboard for the 14900 intel cpu's. I really dont give a sht about aesthetics.
bro what is happening, EVGA is gone and ASUS is evil... What motherboard do I buy???
Nice balls man. Good job putting the power in the people. Yea, people and sponsors listen to Jay. But end of the day people are going to be the ones who stop buying their products because of Jay. I have a full ASUS TUF build right now just finished it and now I feel wary. Its a 550 board and a 5850x3d but still need to look into moving to another brand. ASUS has been an industry leader for a long time, as an industry leader they should pioneer the market in everything they do this is proof they don't.
Wow... As of right now i have a ASRock B450 gaming... well thats what it says on cpu-z lol . I was looking at ASUS boards z790 but after all this...yeah thats not happening... i would love to have a better MB then whats in my rig ... shoot it needs alot of upgrades.. as it only has a 2070 ...but yeah i wouldnt even use this if free with these problems... Even some of my friends ASUS laptops have been acting very odd...but they switched to MSi laptops so meh on those. I dont know if the ASUS problems was what was also affecting the laptops as well ....but it makes me really wonder. As those was having sound ,memory and among other problems.. Hats off too you Jay for doing this...i do not blame you at all.
When he was like we’re sorry the first thing that popped in my head was the cable guys from South Park rubbing their nipples going “we’re so sorry”
@JayzTwoCents beside ASUS wich company would you recommend.  I am or was a ASUS guy!
All of this seems to ne a natural consequence of making people managers of systems/departments/skill areas they have zero knowledge of!
Wow……..good job Jay. Giving up sponsorship is difficult to do……..but their stuff and service has become junk. Good for you and your channel.
Should have made a special note how you are having issues on $500+ motherboards.
lmao "thank God I have a MSI motherboard" That had me chuckle. I think Jay forgot all of the past MSI drama already
Why i dont buy amd stuff
I’ve never liked how Asus stuff looked and I’ve been happy with Gigabyte but it’s amazing to hear your personal experiences. Can’t imagine spending over $600 for a mobo that will fry my CPU. Great video!
I first noticed Asus was a problem around Ryzen 1.  The slide is older then you think.
What does everyone think of gigabyte? Asrock? Just getting an idea of what to look at.
I was a fan of ASUS motherboards for 20 years but I'm an MSI guy now as far as motherboards go.
Their laptops have gone to shit also. Never ever again!
I was a ROG guy. My PC is all ROG outfitted. Z690 Hero (with a good capacitor in right direction) and their 4090 ROG OC card, and unless they turn this around I will be going elsewhere for upgrades. I am also glad you and GN are covering this when certain other massive tech youtubers are ignoring it.
7:15 did Asus NOT see Steve's Newegg debacle? that was a learn opportunity for ALL Brands on proper segmented RMA's.... here we have a Tier 1 NOT GIVING A F##$!
guess ill get that nzxt motherboard instead
great, I wouldn't go with Gigabyte or MSI either... so what now? Asrock? really?
And they want us to trust them buying that steam deck competitor portable?!
Every ASUS product I ever purchased (motherboards, tablets, laptops) has died prematurely, usually from an ESD zap.  The last straw was when my kid killed a laptop by walking up to it and touching the touch pad to change a song.  ASUS will never get another dime from me.
I was considering an rog motherboard and 7800x3d. I changed my mind by going intel and msi/gigabyte
i appreciate the integrity
The problem is the only GOOD vendor in this area that has ever existed is EVGA and they barely make motherboards anymore and don't make GPUs. I have had MASSIVE issues with pretty much ever vendor in this space other than EVGA and picking vendors for PC parts these days is starting to feel like voting for president. You only have shit choices and you are screwed either way.
I love when people like Jay will tell companies like ASUS that they need to wake up and fix their FU's! Until I rebuilt my Ryzen 7 3800X system the ASUS - ROG Crosshair VIII Hero, I had been using Gigabyte motherboards since I believe 2010. Hell I still have my AMD A10-7890K with the GIGABYTE GA-F2A88X-UP4 and I'm using it as testing rig for Unraid, Open sense, and other programs. Still running like a champ. I even stop using MSI when I went to Gigabyte cause they were screwy and more headaches... One of my testing rigs is using a MSI - Z590 PRO WIFI with a  i7-10700K and is running ok, but I can't say I will jump back on their bandwagon! Between Jay, GamerNexus, & Linus, I'm definitely going to pay a lot more attention to what I put together.
Shocked to see this, I've only heard amazing things about ASUS from friends so far who've gotten laptops from them. There's a chance it's just the PC parts and not the laptops that have these type of QC and customer help issues, but frankly I'm not taking that chance. Was deciding between an ASUS or a Framework for my next laptop, but it's not gonna be a hard decision anymore.
I ONCE bought an Asus motherboard that was DOA from the box. Returned for an RMA claim and denied. NEVER bought another Asus product.  It’s sad to see that Asus after 23 years still don’t back their own products.  Talk about throwing yourself under a bus.  Pay a mint for their products and get a premium price dodgy service.  I’m so glad I’ve stuck to my values & standards avoiding the shit show Asus now dishes out.  Their products look good but shame about the price and moreso, shame about the lack of a backed service.  I’ve owned Gigabyte, Asrock Taichi & MSI products with only 1 ever RMA claim quickly resolved by the company concerned. Asus take a leaf from these manufacturers as they leave you for dead.
I thought iFixit can fix it.
This really makes me question asus as a brand, I have a desktop and a laptop from them and thankfully I haven’t really had a problem with them but the laptop I had before my zephyrus g15 had major design flaws that resulted in the laptop breaking down twice, once with the hinges that came loose and chewed up the cable and then the thermals in that were so bad that it cooked my gpu in the laptop
soooo I should avoid buying a TUF Rtx? :/
Way to go Jay! We need stuff like this to happen otherwise the brands will keep pulling this crap
Asrock since 2011
I'm so glad this has finally been brought up!! The last 2 motherboards I had were both by Asus. Both of them caused cpu stability issues, flickering, crashes, usb failures, and posting errors where they wouldn't recognize my drives until they both quit due to "usb overload." None of my peripherals were fried or broken so I tried getting an Asrock motherboard after and it fixed literally every flicker, crash, you name it that I'd been struggling with for the past year. Asus lost my business
Glad to see that you're willing to lose a sponsor to support your viewers. This is why I trust this channel this community.
Really wanted to use an Asus board for my next build but I'm hoping not to Gotta have something with 2 ethernet ports tho Hope I can find something that's not MSI
Looking at my steel legend that I choose instead of a Asus mobo.....you did good kiddo, you did good.
Why are you guys trying so hard not to blame AMD for this? They reviewed and approved every single board that Asus released, they literally released cpu's that they said could run at 95c without any issues, and then, they come up with this x3D much sensible to voltage chips. What the hell?
I had a terrible time with ASUS tech support a few years ago. Will never order from them again.
You sure Jay? keep talking don't let them catch you slipping around The Microcenter store in Tustin. It won't be pretty and you will be fired aka smoked! Where my G at?
Can't spell Asus without the words SUS and ASS so yeah.....
Yikes... as I look over at my X670E Crosshair Hero. Asus, hope you learn from vids like this and make some changes.  Videos like this make me reconsider my purchases going forward. If one of your competitors can match your aesthetics, you are going to be in trouble here.
I really respect your decision Jay. I have 370X MB cross hair Hero 6 since 2018 it work really well until Asus decided to break it with bios update version 8601. Every single program installed juste freez once I turn on the pc even ASUS app (AI suite the aura sync the sonic studio had conflict with bios versio. In my own experience MSI MB ARE very solid and stable more than any other brand I have used I still use MSI A88X from 2012 on one of my work desk and it still run with ZERO ISSUES
I am literally right now, in the process of warranting my motherboard due to memory instability issues and it's been a nightmare for the past month and a half to get this even started. I am waiting for the board to be mailed to me and I am sure it's going to be a refurbished one since they mentioned it may be, much like the one you showed. Can't wait to see how ASUS makes this experience worse...
as rock is still working. lol.
Shame ASUS. My ASRock X99 Extreme 4 still going strong.
I've been a big Asus fan for over 20 years, after this BS on Asus part that romance is over. I'll add them to the list of other manufacturers I refuse to buy from. It seems like they build in failure points that take effect shortly after the warranty runs out. And it's not just computer manufacturers, it's a whole gamut of manufacturers who are participating in this scam just to make money at the consumers expense. Thanks for calling them out Jay!!!
very disappointed
ASUS should be forced to do a total recall on all motherboards blowing up cpus
I just built a new PC at the end of  after 6 years and I'm so glad I went with MSI. ASUS was my first choice but I went MSI instead. I'm really enjoying AM5, it's my first time with an AMD processsor since an Athlon in 2011. I think I accidentally dodged a bullet there.
I have an ASUS ROG board and a 3950X, I cannot run the memory above 3200 because it randomly crashes. Could be seconds/hours/days but it WILL crash when you least expect it. Connecting USB devices is pot luck also, sometimes it works and sometimes it won't. I think its another brand on my next upgrade.
I already said this on Steve's channel, but I used to be a total ASUS fanboy until I noticed what appeared to be a lack of quality a few years ago. I switched to Gigabyte and have never looked back.
well, looks like my current 2 rigs will be my last asus rigs for a while then, until they can get their stuff together.  its a shame because I have used mainly their stuff for the last 10yrs or so because I have always found them to be reliable in my builds... seems like times have changed.
Respect. I guess there will be no ROG Ally review?
I own a Asus rx 6800 gaming tuf oc and its the best cooled gpu ive ever owned
Sounds like the bean counters fired the engineers and took over ASUS! Semper Fi Jay
I am sad because my last 2 motherboards have been Asus ROG mobos. Current one is a white ROG Strix Z690 D4 and has been working great so far. I don't know if the bad customer support is just on the US only, but I understand why they have to go.   Next build (hopefully in about 5 years) I'll consider using MSI instead
I never owned an early era ASRock product back from when they were the "OMG avoid them at all costs" brand. But I do have an older ASRock Z75 board and a i5 3350P, the board itself was always stable and never gave any issues. As far as white motherboards I think Gigabyte has one with the AERO series model. I've considered an ASUS board for when or if I go over to AM5 but with this nonsense it looks like I can remove them entirely from the list of choices.  My current AM4 build is built upon a MSI X570 MPG Gaming Edge Wifi which has also been a very stable board as well. As much as I'd love to have a $700 motherboard to say I bought one the last time I revamped my wish lists I went with boards in the $200 - $250 range instead. As much as I like MSI I don't like their board choices in that price range, they look like cheap budget boards going for way too much.  But as for ASRock I really love the looks of the their Live Mixer boards, both the B650 version in orange and the Intel Z790 version in purple. The graffiti style looks nice and the color of each board would add a pop of color in a white case. Plus they have a decent amount of USB ports for their price range. 😁
Personally ive never had any issues with any of my asus products bht hopefully this is a wake up call for them and i end up with better service and products because of it.
It would be cool if you continued with AMD just to prove that the problem was in fact with ASUS. but I imagine that could cause further headaches, so I would understand if you went Intel
My friend bougth a ROG Zephrys G14 (with the lighting back) that just self-destroyed itslef by shorting inside layers of the PCB. After a RMA, she now has a laptop with a dying display. It needs to be locked at 60Hz (while it should be much higher) because the bottom part of the display gets shaky and covered in black. That ,the content of this video and much more (notably a 'spicy pillow' laptop that wasn't a year olf and saw very little use) is  the final nail in the coffin for me. Very sad to see this brand slip so much. Hope they can rectify their ways. Thanks for the content !
Damn, all this right when they open up the ROG Ally for preorder...
Yes, every brand/company/manufacture does bad. Yes, it's how they handle it that matters. MSI IMO is just as bad as ASUS, CURRENTLY I'm using Gigabyte. If something goes bad, it happens, if they do me wrong then I move on.
Yeeeeup. This kind of complacency has always been an issue, but these days it seems to be really pronounced. Almost to the point of criminal in a lot of cases. The only good news is the consumer is finally starting to say no. i
Crap like this is why, when Newegg deliberately sent me a $800 Asus board when I'd ordered a $400 ASROCK board.  That ASUS went BACK!
I was originally planning an Asus build since my AsRck B450 Pro4's PCIE slots stopped accepting input after 2 weeks, and the GPU was massacred by unknown forces (AsRock Challenger Pro). This video has convinced me to not use Asus.
I've always had issues with ASUS products, from their laptops, to phones, to motherboards and GPU's. I've never ever have had a good experience with them what so ever. Most of the issues are software related whether it's extremely buggy, to where it doesn't work what so ever. Hardware wise I've had two RMA's with their B550 Strix boards with the first board having a bad M.2 NVME slot and the RMA board a bad PCIE slot. It's crazy how awful their QA is.
Had one experience with an ASUS motherboard. A B550 Pro TUF gaming and I got a DOA board. Meanwhile I still have a Asrock B450 HDV 4.0 (which can’t even handle a R9 3900x most likely) and it still runs a R5 2600 perfectly. Stuck with Asrock and my 7700X and running stable with aggressive timing DDR5-6000
Just got my MSI Meg z590 unify motherboard! Needed a new one since my last motherboard refuses to post. Was awfully tempted to get an Asus motherboard but glad I made my pick!
It's videos like this that make me wonder if we're ever gonna hear an uncensored Jay....I actually want to. lol
its a shame to hear all this about asus, they have been my go to brand for many years now but all this stuff is gonna make me think again in the future for sure.
Techtubers like you, Steve, Daniel Owen, PC builder, and many others are where I get my info on parts buying, and I hope companies like Asus understand what they're doing by making enemies of you all As an aside...Man it figures my on Asus product is a motherboard from a few years back...
Your right, Asus have ALOT of innovative ways of packing their gear, and provide ALOT of branding material - Stickers, tiedowns, magnets etc. I have their white 360 AIO, and the box was so over engineered. As you say, Meanwhile - Their actual products have been on a downward spiral
Well said JAYZTWOCENT 👏👏👏👏
5:40 An MSI motherboard, whoops. After their recent hack they might not be a great option either.  Light fun aside I'm happy to see this video come out. Buyers need to be aware of just how serious these issues are getting, and there's no better way to get that across than publicly rejecting their products.
Wow. I'm glad I didn't get a bunch of "popular" parts. ASRock B550M/ac since January 2020,  nary a problem. Never updated a damn thing. None with my 3700X. My PNY 3080 has been flawless (except for performing better than it's supposed to). 32g of Ballistix 4x8 cl 16 running fine at 3800. RM1000x...I'd say it's purring along but it's silent. Everything seems to play well with each other, nothing is straining. I went for good power, staying in that 50% zone is best. The most trouble I've had is my cheap ass 43" TCL 4K TV died. Got a 32" LG 1440 165HZ for $200 Black Friday.
Nahh yall tech channels been d-riding asus for years. Def knew about these problems for a long time and decided to stay quiet.
I wonder if ASUS will realize itself, and wake up. Or if they'll just let their troubles grow.
Treating your customers unfairly, especially in the PC community where people spend a lot of time watching and reading reviews is really stupid. I really doubt the money they will be saving by voiding warranties is worth the harm to their reputation.
I need to know if I am safe to use my ROG Strix B550-F gaming Wi-Fi II. I currently don’t have it in use because I’m still waiting on my power supply so I can build my first build but now I feel I have made a mistake
i got a rog strix b550 mother board and after 6 months it had damaged my SSD and hdd and causing all kinds of damage and Wi-Fi cored had shorted out to causing problems so after that i switched to mag x570s tomahawk and it was a lot better than ASUS motherboards never gave me a problem
a few months ago my lan port died out of the blue on my pc, and it's a asus board, never buying from asus again
Thanks for standing up in behalf of us the little people
ASUS has always had the Best ITX boards, but I will not be buying from them again. this is a pretty big blow for SFF.
Asus has always been / shush shush / put it under the rug / over the years. First time they did that, that I've noticed was back with ASUS HD 7850 and 7950, when heatsink wasn't touching / sitting on GPU die properly, resulting in crazy GPU temps and failures. They kept selling that stock, like nothing happened and they silently released V2 of those cards. Don't get me wrong, I have two ASUS mobo's and their motherboards were always solid up until this point. Their software was always garbage (AI Suite for example) but BIOS overall was solid. What they are doing now, washing their hands by telling their consumers "fuck you and your warranty" is just dirty.
I want it to be known that Gigabyte seems to have had the same issues but Gigabyte is taking care of their customers 100%. I can confirm this personally as we spoke to Gigabyte today for my brother-in-law's motherboard and they guaranteed us repair or replacement is on the way.  He had the same thermal issues with his 7900X and visible heat damage on the bottom of the CPU as well as bent pins from the CPU flexing. He was running the same G-Skill 6,000 that Steve used but had it at stock clocks and it's still burned up the CPU.  Mad props to Gigabyte for taking care of their customers the way they should have at ASUS.
As much as people like to shit on msi, I have had way more trouble with asus motherboards than any other component.
CLICK BAIT
I'm less than a month into using my new AMD rig. Coming from Intel + Nvidia, I was lost on which AMD board partners and such are the most trustworthy. Who's the EVGA on the AMD side? Nobody stood out to me. I felt I should avoid Asus 'cause I could see their customer service/support was withering, so I picked ASRock. I had no idea ASRock was the 'cheap' brand. But today? I'm more hopefully that this system will last... although I could cook eggs on this 7900 XTX.
I thought Asrock was just Asus’s budget line. Are they a separate company now?
While this problem may prove out to be fully ASUS, this is one of the types of reasons I always buy Intel if it's in budget. I've used AMD for builds over several generations and while performance would be ok, I would get all kinds of weird stability issues and problems compared to since I switched to Intel/Nvidia exclusively for my last 3 builds. Never looked back.
I wish i had the money to switch I bought a 7950x3d and a ROG crosshair extreme saving up and going for an all out build just to get usb issues, os install issues, havent updated bios yet to avoid voiding the warranty so im just praying mine doesn't die.... 1500 down the drain basically just hoping i dont get screwed further at this point.
swap boards confirm that its asus
Love the dubbed "stuff" at 1:13.
Asus also has begun to lose my trust after they shipped my 1 month old 3080 Strix RMA in a plain box without padding and ended up coming damaged and screws missing. They wanted me to ship it back on my dime.
I'm getting a sense of dramatics
Consider this Bios a booby trap
A Long time ago, My advise to ANYONE when building a PC was: Asus Boards, Seagate Drives. That was my rule. My Last 3x Builds have all been Gigabyte boards. They might not be the best for everyone - But have been perfect in every iteration of my systems.
Oof. Between this and EVGA being gone gone...  the market is looking sad. Thinking my decision of amd vs nvidia just got made. Sapphire or XFX better make a killer 7700 or 7800
Glad I went with ASRock for my first build back in January. All it took was looking into customer support reviews to turn me off asus.
I caught this earlier. I've used ASUS as my main go to board. I've used others but have favored them more. I've not done recent builds in this format in about 8 years. After seeing this most recent debacle, I would never (NEVER) trust them again. There is a lot of better options available with responsive and responsible dedicated board options.       I think ASUS is prime for a class action lawsuit. Stock holders beware.... .😢
Well done Jay. Kudos!
I think they will care. I bet with your uturn on them and the amount people that rely on you for reviews. I'm guess there sales will dip enough to notice.  But will you still be using there other hardware in your builds or going all out avoid on them
AsRock really stepped up these past generations. Rock solid boards. No flashy BIOS GUI, just functional, intuitive, and STABLE - while keeping costs down/competitive
I whish you had posted this video about two months ago.  I just finished building a ASUS 670E Strix system based upon input I had received from various you tube clips.  Did I make a mistake? Time will tell.  I do know that I am having problems with my video card and now I don't know if it is a ASUS Problem, Viideo Card problem or Monitor issue.  I always find your comments very honest and your concern for builders genuine, but after spending a couple grand on a ASUS  AMD 7950 system I am very disenchanted.
Bad press can ironically make companies better. I saw this happen with the whole _Gran Turismo 7_ fiasco. I think ASUS will get better in the future, considering the PR nightmare they're going through now. When things like this happen and people jump ship, it's a wake-up call to the companies. I was planning to do an ROG build, but it's probably just as well that I don't have the money to do so right now. It's going to take at least as long for ASUS to right the ship as it's going to take me to save up for that build.
I’m worried now. I bought a ASUS ROG Strix B650E-I  a few months back when I built my ITX PC. It’s been fine but after seeing this I’m worried
I've had my Z590E motherboard that is in my system currently crash on me multiple times, having to wait a while for the motherboard to even detect my M.2... No other issues so far...
I always loved Asus products but lately I just saw how terrible their customer service is. Firstly they don't even deal with you directly and they tell you to contact the retailer if you have any issues. Disgraceful company and they always overcharge for everything. Time to move onto Gigabyte.
asus has been nothing but disappointing my asus g15 G513RW-XS91-CA 2022 still has FTPM stutter as they never fixed it even tho AMD gave them the fix to implement with any of the laptops. and now after owning it for 6 months or so its rebooting while left idle or on paused video on youtube sometimes. sad thing is i checked and im almost certain its software related as I have stressed all the components in meny ways and found no issue with any of them, it seems to be thermal triping when not hot at all.
As someone new to the PC game and got a lot of Assus ROG gear this makes me sad.  Ever since joining the master PC race i feel like im running into way more problems and trust issues than when on consoles.
EVGA! Baby, come back! You can blame it all on me!
Yeah I have had nothing but issues on Asus motherboards. My current one is defective, usually being unstable with anything other than xmp or default settings and if using A1 and A2 ram slots? Computer becomes unstable. Enable asus's performance mode quick setting in UEFI also makes my system unstable. I already replaced my ram and I know it's not my CPU nor CPU temps. I really need to replace this B550 board with another brand sometime.
I've recently become a MSI fanboy after a couple of bad ASUS board.  I thought I was just unlucky.  MSI -- It just works (without blowing up and catching your house on fire)
I have had 3 Asus boards die on me, one of them being a pre-built. The pre-built got repaired on warranty and on the return shipping the cpu cooler broke off, and then they didn't activate windows on the new board in that pre-built. Luckily I could fix that issue myself but I had been the average pre-built buyer it would have been another warranty fix issue. I won't ever buy another of their products.
Asus is a marketing company that sometimes makes computer components.
Absolutely shocked asus is this bad for motherboards on amd. My z790 e gaming is amazing and never had issues that im aware of 😮
Good on you but it will have a minimal impact on ASUS for the time being and will be completely forgotten about by the time next Gen hardware comes around. Just like all of the messes MSI were involved in and have gone completely forgotten about now. Since you’re using an MSI board in your build.   ASUS will do their PR spin and will keep it moving. With their main focus being the ASUS ROG Ally atm.
Good job Jay. Got to keep it real. If they're going to treat people like s*** then they should get treated like s*** sorry about their luck. They don't want to make good products. Why should you endorse them?
It's a good thing I'm too poor to upgrade into these new age problems 😂 They should be able to figure out these problems over time.... Right? My current PC is 5 years old so by the time I'm able to update... Hopefully in 5 years time... These problems will not exist with today's issues. Right?   Right?!😢
I've had constant issues w my rog strix b650e-f gaming wifi after an rma. I am willing to buy another windows key to get rid of these problems.
Well shiTe! I hope nothing fails in my rig. This year I went Intel and 790 mobo(Asus Rog Maximus) so far no problems but if I do have one, with ASUS attitude,I may be screwed.. And I simply do not like most others,except for Evga. I may just go ahead and order 790 mobo from them, just in case.. Not a gamer this is a studio/ production rig, but yeah a fine rig too game on if I have some time. This is worrisome..
the beta bios's have always been that way even on am4 (viods warrenty) and even intel beta ones from asus ...
I'm so pissed at every brand in the pc space. MSi can't be trusted because they were hacked and ransomed and had their intel keys stolen, Asus has nuclear motherboards, Asrock is known for having almost exclusivley shit products, gigabyte has shit RMA practices, Newegg sucks, Nvidia is over priced, AMD, can't get coolers or drivers right, NZXT wants to burn your house down. Is it so fucking hard to just be a decent company AND make money? EVGA knows how, but they get fucked by Nvidia so one less product for consumers. Go figure.
Went MSI for Z690, and Z790, will continue doing so.
When I saw Steve's video, I suggested boycotting i the company till they change in the comments (doubt anyone saw it, lol). I am beyond happy tech tubers are calling out on their BS and now even going to the extent of boycotting the company themselves. You have reached new heights of respect in this community.  Now we need Linus on board too. The ROG Ally that otherwise looks great, is from the same scumbad company and who knows what they could do next. Those can't sell out and needs to sit on shelves, every product, from ASUS, till they change.
I'm with you 100%.  I have a 7700x with an Asus b650e-f bought at launch.  I have not updated the bios at all.  Just wondering when my chip will explode since I don't want to update the bios because its a beta and voids warranty.
im guessing u probably have but test the intel boards see if they are crap as well of if its just amd side either way asus has screwed up badly
Not to say, that i bought years ago for the Hero ix Edition Just 220 bucks and for the z790 Hero Edition almost 600 bucks for no reason. Yes ddr 5 This and that, its Okei if it would costs 450 bucks when i Look to other Brand prices but, thats to much for shit.  Always though asrock is like the bottom ground and asus is the heaven, to See that Video, i should Go into myself and question me where they Stands rn.
Sucks... I bought a X670e extreme on release and been waiting to build with it. Just picked up a 7950x3d on release and waiting for case and aio...
Here here. Hit the nail on the head. My experiences with Asus sound similar. Took 12 months to get a refund for a crappy laptop.
i wonder what happened inside the company for this kind of stuff to become so prevalent in the past year or so, with no real statements or news about any of it. really sucks because asus has always had great hardware and were always one of my top picks, but i'm definitely not sure now. have actually been planning a new pc build and i had a z790 maximus board picked out; good thing i didn't buy any of it yet lol
lol "keep your ...obviously edited in over the feces...stuff"
MSI baby😂😂
As a long time ASUS customer (motherboards and video cards), I've seen the quality of their software (the Windows applications) go downhill consistently over the years.  The number of posts just on how to install AI Suite/Armoury Crate is mindblowing.  This has now spread to their firmware.  Add that to their attitude toward their customers and you have a brand not worth spending money on.
Legit, I'm chill with companies screwing up.  That happens.  But when they pull the crap Asus is doing.  Nope.  I'm done.  But I've noticed a serious drop in quality myself.  I'm not sure who I'm going to throw money at for my next board but it won't be Asus.

Yikes! I'm glad I stuck with my 570X that's rock solid.
Legend
i’m not you i’m not in your place but the only issue i have is my old b550-f gaming has a top pcie slot that’s dead i have to use the bottom slot. My new motherboard is great though i had to get new ram corsairs ram was bugged out of the box.
Ok, So I paused the video at 2:00mins to write this comment. So what I saw of the 2mins and my reaction is YES, More BIG YouTubers have to get together and call out this crap and show that the buyers are not going to put up with it. If we continue as buyers to accept this, then the PC enthusiast is doomed and inturn will have a knock on affect for the Big Youtubers and their content. Now I willl watch the rest and hope Im not wrong. Edit, I now watched all the video and I was right. We need to get behind this and stop it no matter what side of the fence you are on. Thank Jay, Best Video Yet.
not so funny thing about it is way back 20 years ago I had bad asus mobo and never purchased one again, that is until the 7800x3d came out and I thought would give them a chance again and got the strix x670e-e gaming wifi,  now i dont know what to do,  stay on the bios and cross fingers or update to a beta and cross fingers.  I wish I would have went with intel.  I deal with a ton of older systems and there are a ton of intel systems that still run and very few amd systems..  I wanted it work and now I am stuck with it.
and you know what will hapen its all AMD fault,  because intel have no issue with asus.... at leats thats what intel fanboys will claim....
My first issue with Asus was after a bios update, where audio over hdmi would not work (wouldn't even detect it as an audio source) took weeks of canned troubleshooting responses before they gave me the answer I wanted "how do I rollback my bios"turned out that bios after a certain version canned support for earlier ryzen (1st 2nd gen) CPUs. That's when I decided Asus wasn't for me and went back to ASRock.
I had a similar experience with a z690 board the tracers were all scratched luckily I had builders insurance so rma wasn't a issue.
The ending: "...but you don't care."  I think that sums it all up perfectly.
ive had asrock and it was a great mobo, goo asrock
Maybe intel and nvidia gives money to asus, amd gpus suck to. I have full asus system but hate asus u can see on my videos even cpu cooler was asus but its suck and overpriced. Also  I bough asus mouse rog harpe broke in 2 week its also overpriced shit to. Fuck asus
8:34 Fuzz or something clearly visible.
Oh dang i just acquired a asus board. 😳
I only had two ASUS motherboard my current b650E and a b550 strix and ASUS boards are know to work good and then suddenly just stop working also all the crap it gets downloaded in the background like armor crate, that software might as well be an antivirus like Norton.
ive been trying to rma an asus mouse all day but the only way to do it is by phone and whenever an agent picks up the first thing they say is "we can't provide any product support today please call back in a couple hours" and it's been like 10 hours now and they're still saying that
Ever since Sandy Bridge era I've been using ONLY Asus ROG mobos. Unfortunately their quality and price has gone to shit, now they're just an overpriced RGB "gamer" mobos. My current mobo is a Gigabyte and for the first time not an ROG.
I wanted to choose asus rog for a 4080 as well as for the mb 7800x3d. I will choose msi and moreover they are less expensive =) Thanks Jay
That explains my random Ethernet disconnects all the time on my b550 board :0 😮
I've been waiting 9 months with over 20 emails to get my Asus club rewards and a promo gpu holder from AUGUST. Something that should have been automatic had been stretched out with excuses and non replies  Awaiting a final email then going to ACCC to put in an official complaint
Tragic I guess no Ally review!!! Now am wondering if I should keep my preorder 🤨🤔
That's the problem when good companies live off of their name.
7:20 not the first time i have heard them sending used or RMAd product to ppl. i have heard when ppl ordered GPUs that where DOA and had to RMA the card just to get used card in return or straight out not taking responsibility when product was damaged by the faulty accessory that came with the product.  i my self hate how quickly they stop supporting some products after launch like barely giving any driver updates or even working drivers. i my self got a asus sound card that got barely any driver updates and latest one was a beta driver that disabled dolby and caused Bluescreens, meanwhile Creative sends new drivers to their over 10 year old products  and latest issues ive had with them is with my mobo "Asus ROG Crosshair VI Extreme" where the newest audio drivers makes my PC unresponsive and sluggish after few mins of restarting. literally everything stops working. opening a folder takes like 20 mins what makes it totally unusable. and only after rolling back to the older drivers fixed the issue
making a new 7800x3d build. I went Asrock Steel Legend. Big Skip on Asus for me
I had this with Asus back in 2012. They denied reposibility. Had to take them (as a reseller) to small stuff court - and I won. The board came from the factory with bent pins...
I agree ASUS has a big problem. I RMA a board and ASUS refused to refund or send a new board because the cheap plastic holder for the GPU  was broken which they poionted out.MB ASUS Rog Strix 570-E Gaming $320 at the time of purchase .  Obviously the GPU plastic holder had nothing to do with the board being bad. Never buy ASUS again.
Is it cause there’s someone new in charge of asus or in their qa department?
It's the issue of not Losing Face. We can't be wrong because if we are we will have lost face.
I recently got a rog strix b550-f WiFi mother board and was really happy with it tbh
Asus change a lot for the past years.. gonna switch to Gigabyte on my upcoming build. Thank you for this review, you really help a lot of people choosing a reasonable and good product.
Almost can’t trust any hardware these days. So is Asus doing this to AMD mono’s on purpose?
I wouldn't put all this on asus, yes shady shit there doing at the moment regarding this issue and admittedly i'm not a AMD user, however just going by 12th and 13th gen intel boards, I've used personally both msi and asus boards, all overvolt the 12th and 13th gen cpu's like crazy, even other manufacturers like asrock, gigabyte ect that i have seen in reviews online all overvolt like mad to, however I now have the asus z790 hero which I have been running for about 4 months and has been the only one I have managed to tame voltages with, my msi apex z690 and carbon z790 would pump 330w into the cpu, even undervolting it would still hit 290 - 300w.  The hero board runs around 265w once undervolted and Im hitting 82c max with 10min of R23 cooling with a 420mm aio where i would be getting around 89c to 92c on the msi boards, there must be some information that board manufacturers are receiving from Intel and AMD that are making them drastically overvolt the hell out of cpus, it can't be a coincidence that there all doing the same thing.
Just when people started shilling the ROG handheld lol
AMD is trash. Always has been.
To be honest I have never liked ASUS. The motherboards are fine but I find the quality control on their laptops, monitors and accessories, etc. to be absolutely terrible. The GPU's are also overpriced and more likely to have QC issues like coil whine in my experience. I also think their support is bad.
@JayzTwoCents Ive bought an X670 Extreme from Asus only to have a brand new board not working. But Im based in a little country in Africa with no method to send it back without incurring a phenomenal fee and now I have a $1000 brick
Damn Asus is going from bad to worst...
Thank you for doing the right thing. I can remember since the days of A8N-SLI(my 1st asus motherboard) this manufacturer didnt provide a good support and their product quality always has been questionable.
I owe a b550 for my 5600x and even I'm kinda worried about it but haven't seen or heard anything about failures with this yet.
Audio crackling is 100% an FCLK stability issue.   In Zen 1 through to Zen 3 raising your IOD voltage helped with stability on this.   I just don't know what safe ranges are for voltages on Zen 4 yet so 100% don't just yeet it.
I always saw ASUS is overpriced garbage. For the past 15 years I had only one ASUS motherboard. The rest of my about 20 builds were MSI, AsRock and Gigabyte in the order of quality.
Damn I'm not too deep into anything PC review in the last 5 years, but if well known Youtubers are hating on Asus, perhaps I will avoid the brand.
Thank you for the video. Now I'm going to overhaul my build list to remove Asus and go with a different brand. Was going to do an Asus build with a strix 4090 card but seems like that won't be the case anymore.
I was a big fan of asus for years my first ever gaming pc was an asus rog g750 sucks to see them fall down this way
wow... I ALWAYS loved ASUS brand boards and it "was" reliable at the time. Now this sucks...  I dont like MSI,  I guess ill try Gigabyte from now on.
Can't wait for an hour of WAN to be talking about this haha
I received a motherboard for my new 12900KS build last year that had some damaged pins straight out of the box. It took months with an insane amount of emails and phone calls back and forth before finally getting a chargeback to go through with my credit card. They tried claiming it was literally impossible for a board to leave their factory with any damage whatsoever. It was beyond ridiculous. Months and months of fighting with them and the store I got it from before my CC finally decided it was worthy of a chargeback. Never dealing with Asus again after how hard they fought that and how hard they tried to claim I damaged it myself.
ASUS has always been a problem brand and don't get me started on their software. Remember when they made a graphics driver that gave you a free wall hack in games.🤣
Phat L Asus
My Asus is literally on fire 🔥What should I do?
Asus GPU's are not OK. Most have coil whine!!!
Funny you are doing this. AMD sent me an email today trying to sell a processor with ASUS motherboards and I responded to it that AMD should be distancing themselves publicly from ASUS.
I noticed during CES that ASUS was high above the consumer; they were targeting the prosumer.  If you are going to cater to the prosumer, you had best have exemplary service and support.  Imagine if Apple started treating its customers this way.  The reality distortion field would quickly crumble.
Well I hope my asus board doesn’t kill itself.
Do you know what is sad - I have an ASUS laptop and really like it.  However, ASUS is acting like a piece of ish.  That laptop may be my last ASUS purchase.
<Applause>  Way to go Jay! We should all show that devious, greedy company that we're not gonna put up with anymore of their BS!
Arctic had problems with their AIO coolers, and they actively let their customers know that there was a problem, and offered free express RMAs. Hell, they even _taught_ us how to fix the problem ourselves if we were so inclined to do so! Now Asus here just up and goes "Hey, download and update to this BIOS because its necessary. Also, when you do, you void your warranty. So when your parts release the magic smoke, *FUCK YOU AND FUCK OUR PRODUCT.* Buy Asus." ... Asus deserves the boycott in this case.
Asus out here thinking they’re too big to fail and all I can think is “so did Commodore, Amiga, 3dfx, Cyrix, Netscape, AOL, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera”.  Although, it would be REALLY hilarious if you made a video shooting those motherboards like you’re Kid Rock mad at Bud Light 😂
...and in solidarity, I've been trying to decide between an Asus X570i and the Gigabyte x570 for my sunset AM4 build. Looks like Gig's is getting my green.
I'm curious if other ASUS products are shitting the bed or if it's just their motherboards ? Either way i'm not buying anything of there's again
ASUS Sucks! Been saying it for years, hate them.  Turned me off PC actually, gone full Apple and love it, not a gamer.
I'm so disappointed with ASUS, as I've been a big proponent of their products since I built my first PC using an ASUS Black Pearl motherboeard more than 20 years ago.  My current system, built about 18 month ago, has an ASUS mobo but ASUS may not be in the picture moving forward.
Much respect Jay thank you again for the info. on the new ASUS system boards. Sorry you had to go through that mess
donate one to me 🥺
Thanks to you and GN for covering this and taking the steps you are. I have not been the happiest with my X570 Aorus Xtreme, so I was lookin g at ASUS for my next system, but I may go MSI now.
Anheuser Busch: This is a nightmare for our brand. ASUS: Hold my Bud Light...
If you don’t read the “fine print” that’s your problem. I swear YouTubers just look for shit to be mad about anymore.
That's why I don't but shit on new platforms until it's been out for like a year
I've been a huge Asus fan over the years but this turned me off of buying their products for my builds anymore.  So Asus may not care but I sure do!
you wont cut every brand with a problem, bud do you boyxot transmission juice budweiser!
I have been using ASRock for 10 years now I will never look back...
100
Finally some karma for Asus. 👍 I was a victim of their G1 laptop that melted the GPU, Transformer Prime with useless GPS/Wifi because of the backplate, and a couple more. ( I was also a victim for the Dell XPS 13 that melted its GPU. They were as bad as Asus when anyone tried to get some support.)
love it. love when big people in the community can take a stand against the shadiness and hold the big money leeching corporation accountable.
Thats a shame.   Ive been a huge Asus fan since my first AMD build (amd athlon 2600) when i bought an Asus A7V8X board, and i loved it.  Ive been buying them ever since.  I am building a new machine with a 7950x3d, and was going to go Asus for the MB and PSU, but after this?  No thanks.
10/10 criticism here. There are already other videos in other languages about this calling it a shame. It might spread. Asus better do something fast.
I recently helped upgrade my son's I6700K, 16GB, GTX970 system to a 5700x, 32GB and 6750XT. I chose an MSI board due to Asus "Issues."  it's been rock solid.
LTT just called them out for misrepresenting the ROG Ally, too. ASUS, come on. I've been putting your products on my recommended list for over 10 years. Get your shit together
Wait!? Asrock better than ASUS? I mean anything is better now 😂
First world problems...
This is kind of heart breaking, some of my best overclockers have been asus boards. Oof...
These problems sound very familiar. I switched from a MSI to Asus motherboard and now it's all going downhill. Same cpu and ram too btw.
I've been planning on making a new system and was planning to get a Asus board and gpu, but I'm definitely avoiding them this time around.  I'm not much familiar with MSI or gigabytes as a brand, have they been pretty good?
Well done & full respect for your support  towards the consumer Jay 👍👍👍
Asus is A sus
I was excited for the Asus ROG Ally... but with all the negative news and how they are handling it, I will pass.
The sad part about  asus also is in their phone department  they don't even care about their consumers, I'm a victim  when I  bought their  rog phone 5  it was full of bugs... the performance is a disappointment  , a lot of people  complain. but asus doesn't even care to address the issue. They just want your money  💰 that's why I change brand to Xiaomi
I stop buying Asus products and Gigabyte products 8 yrs ago because this company do not care for the consumers. They don’t period. And if i don’t mistaken ASRock was part of ASUS years ago and was in charge of the quality control. Since they move apart Asus has gone down hill and ASRock up hill. Maybe this is the issue Asus have in quality control.
You just told 3.88 million subscribers that you are disgusted with their Company and products. They better care as this situation could bankrupt the company?
I don’t remember what game specifically but back in like 2010-2011 I put my foot down as a low income earner and stopped buying games from companies that kept pushing out half ass products. I’ve stuck very true to that and have carried that mentality to all hobbies I pick up. I literally have $1400 of brand new ASUS hardware in my office I’ve received over the last week. I’ve always used ASUS hardware. I’m tempted to send it all back.
Planned on having an Asus board in my gf mid tier build but not anymore. My next build will be back with Asrock which is now imo a superior product
It’s doing tons of rep damage to AMD unfortunately. I used ASUS for every build up until Intel 9th Gen, when they inexplicably dropped RGB support in Armory Crate (and yet advertised on the box). Software support indeed
So... As someone who's avoided MSI since the early 00s due to their (then?) poor quality, are you trying to say that [Asus 2023]=[MSI 200#] and [MSI 2023] = [ASUS 200#] ?
First the GPU market titanic's itself and not motherboard market...what's next
what brands do you recommend? i had a gigabyte board previously but i had trouble with getting tech support. asus tech support did answer the phone very quickly.
Its aSUS. A sussy company.
👍👍❤️❤️❤️
After watching Steves video. it seems as though the problem is Asus not AMD. AMD told them to lower the SOC max voltage to 1.3V and the Asus Beta bios still doesn't. Asus is also trying to blame the consumer for the problems and saying AMD said this and that to which AMD told steve that the statements Asus made was not from them. I have been using Gigabyte and Asrock Boards for about 3 years now for my build and customer builds because i've had too many issues with Asus, especially there support when it comes to RMA's
I’m out ASUS! Been a customer for 15 plus years for every build. Time for a new brand
Glad people are holding companies accountable if they mistreat their customers. A lot of solid tech tubers giving us the info we need.
Built 6 PC with Asus boards the past year....2 of which were faulty costing me a lot of time and additional effort to prove that it s actually the boards and none of the other components that were faulty. The truly catastrophic experience was the Asus support though which nowadays is handled by one of the big call center companies called Majorel (at least here in Central Europe....recently this company is also handling most of the Amazon support services which have gone down the drain these past 2 years....) and the experience has been shocking- especially compared to the past where one of Asus´strong points was the support.  It was like talking to toddlers time after time that very evidently just went through their standard computer aided assist program. You could clearly see they don t understand how things work and that issue A excludes issue B or what it means when issue C arises. The first two calls resulted in requests to write an email to sum it all up (I bet it s meant to be their 2nd lvl escalation) just to get a reply that even clearly showed the email hasn t been read...with an increasingly nervous me going: look I already did all the testing for you it s either A or possibly B and in both cases it s a hardware issue with the board which again was ignored and I got standard questions that were answered by myself in previous mails.  I ended up jumping that line ignoring their "process" at this point, contacting ppl from Asus directly (am responsible for the IT of three of our company s sites but commonly don t wanna mix that with things I do or purchased as a normal, private customer but yes, I do have a more direct line to their corporate department). The next day I got a call back... but even that left a bitter taste as it was like, "checked what you described in the email, sorry for the inconvenience, send it back, we ll replace it"....but no interest whatsoever when I pointed out sth along the lines of "do you actually realize what the process I ve been through means to a company like yours???!!!" ...and no, they don t seem to care...it was replied by a "sorry, we ll send you a replacement asap"....
Now you must use only american computer parts!
Interesting timing on this... Rethinking getting the ROG Ally
I got same bullshit with my Oled screen pg27aqdm who is dead after 1 month ..
I have always used intel/Asus since early 2000s and have had flawless results. My last build is a 10850k build. This is heartbreaking to hear a good company go down like this. I feel they will bounce back. They better. MSI and gigabyte look really good compared to Asus right now with their past mistakes.
ASUS is about to lose out on a LOT of money after this, as they should. It’s total bullshit. Also, IF they can’t get their act together, I hope they crash and burn as a big life lesson.
Some people really love to kick their lunch box.
Jay in an slightly different universe "It makes zero sense for a motherboard manufacturer to release an update that messes with voltages to fix an issue a few people are having and it not be a beta". This drama for clicks and he will be hawking ASUS again before the end of the year.
Thumbs up for 80s Miami synthwave! I was planning on coppin a new ROG mobo but now I'm giving it a 2nd thought. So what's the best mobo now in terms of looks and reliability?
When I bought my Sabertooth 990FX R1 I didn't have a way to update the bios for the FX 8350 I planned to use.  One email to Asus and they mailed me a new bios chip free of charge (not even shipping) that showed up in three days.  I'm still using that hardware today with zero issues, and of course heavily overclocked for the life of the system.  That quality and experience with support from Asus has led me to purchase and recommend more of their products over the years.  I sincerely hope they can get back to that level.
As noted on Steve's videos, blame must be shared between AMD and ASUS for lack of communication.   I loathe to see companies behaving like ASUS is at the moment.  I have an ASUS ROG rig which I bought many years ago and have respect for them for what they have done in the past.  The future of ASUS will be settled on what they do next.
isn't Asrock started as the "value" brand of Asus but separated, back then? How the turntables
Well i have asrock riptide b650, no stability issues, but i have been having big problems with   microstutters in vr. Either it was caused by usb A ports and lan port being somehow bad, because i had problems both over wifi router  and usb cable, or its sometin with the drivers, oculus recently released a new beta drivers, and i can finally at least play beat saber without microstutters over a cable.
Thats what you call BACKBONE
Although these issues are related to AMD,as someone that got an Asus M/B for my Intel I5 Build last year has me nervous for a future unknown time bomb.😕
Nice
Way back Gigabyte was considering discarding their motherboard division because of the bad product quality. It was literally a choice between getting out of the business or double down and revise their complete motherboard product line. They chose the later and in a year they went from incredibly high to extremely low return rates. That was a long time ago and I can't vouch for their quality today.  A few years back ASRock had a very bad run. Their motherboards were crap and they black listed some reviewers who exposed just how bad they were. This last generation of their motherboards are actually pretty decent.  Point is manufacturers seem to have a problem keeping the quality constantly high. I want to blame bean counters as I hate those. Marketing departments are not much better, but they are often in cahoots with each other. The problem is that continually keeping quality high can build brand recognition and loyalty, but when it is mostly smaller volumes and aimed at enthusiasts adding more RGB, flashier heatsinks, and bold colors often give a higher ROI than spending a dollar more on components and software that works.  Once it get so bad that they are called out like this it's is quite likely that the engineering department will get both better design budgets and more resources for firmware development an quality assurance. But that will only last a few years, until the immediate management moves up the ladder or swap companies, then the circle repeats again.
my Jay my pc has been actting up i have a B550a motherboard do you think this is one of the issues or what are the affected motherboards for Asus
if u dont want it u can send it to me... hihihihi
Problem is AsRock is a subsidiary of Pegatron, which was spun off, from Asus!  I have not found any definitive information, that they are truly separate entities. Them directly competing does not mean they are truly separate.
I remember back in the day when ASUS was THE BRAND to get for motherboards. Its sad to see this happen.
Well it's really good to see people actually open their eyes to the reality of all these corporations, what reality? THEY DON"T GIVE A SH*T about us consumers until we start to voice our opinion, frustration, discontent, etc and etc with our WALLETS! But like Jay says, sometimes fanboy-ism get's in the way and clouds the judgement enough to not be neutral and objective when things like this happen.  And yet you have the guy that runs the fcbk group silencing and deleting every post about this topic, way to go JJ, keep adding more fuel to the fire, you're doing great!!
Well, you've convinced me. I was always an Asus Fan boy, but not any more.
Good on you Jay and Steve.  Thank you
It's a shame. I've almost exclusively used asus products ( only brand I've tried that hasn't given me issues running linux) and asus doing stuff like this really makes me question the money I've spend on them.
Ill also not buy another Asus product! Im up in canada here. Ill make sure all my friends are on board too.
I was a loyal Asus fan and usually had good luck with their stuff. Then I their WRX-80 board, and for such an expensive board, some of the features were disappointing, and the few BIOS updates they offer did not bring any improvements. I thought that board was just a bad apple, but now I realize this was part of an overall downward trend. Okay, goodbye, Asus.
I have a 5950X on an ASUS ROG STRIX X570 and I recently upgraded my BIOS to address a RAM issue only to immediately notice my CPU temperature was up by over 10C. Upon inspection of my BIOS settings I found that my motherboard now has the CPU at 1.44VDC idling in the BIOS menu?! I had this CPU undervolted and the latest BIOS sets my computer to oven mode! Fix my BIOS ASUS! Thanks Jay!
I agree and stand with you ive recently moved up to a am4 5500 with a asus prime 550 board from a old fx5300 am3 cpu and i know people who have had problems and in the end theyve moves to msi with there am5 ryzen cpus
I used to be a VERY long time ASUS user, ever since I first started building PCs. My last and final purchase from them was the ROG Centurion 7.1 headset: the connecting part between the earcups and headrest was only a flimsy  plastic tube of approx. 5 mm diameter and 0.5mm thickness which broke within 4 months. Trying to get an RMA ASUS kept sending me to the reseller and the reseller (Ebuyer) kept sending me to ASUS. after 2 months of chasing both I simply had to give up. I am sure not RMAing one product is worth losing an over a decade long customer who purchased thousands of pounds worth of your products...
Wow - thanks for the heads up.  I was thinking of upgrading to an Asus B550 MB.   Any issues with  MSI or Gigabyte MBs?
❤
Was planning to let my 7900x ride for some years and eventually get the best and last compatible cpu for the platform. I can only hope mb can last enough to be worth it. Not sure I'd wanna risk a new cpu in the future to asus mb.   I would have otherwise went with the 13700k combo with azrock board(my old mb was one too, and was solid for 5 years) if im upgrading the whole platform in 3 years(or otherwise 5).
Hate to have to say it but…  Asus had wasted to much of my time and money, too casually!  It’s been a fun ride with the ROG  brand over the years.
I've always used ASUS PRIME products, they advertise them as business tested. Never had a problem with those but its unfortunate to hear they are slipping in quality.
Hmm wonder how this drama will affect the ROG ally launch?
My maximus came in broken as well, came to me fried because there's no anti static bag lmao. Took me a bit to figure that one out
msi board or asrock board is best  i like asrocks bios more looks less jank
Is Asus turning into the Konami of PC parts? 😱
Asus-sy brand indeed! Thanks Jay and team for having our backs. God bless.
Unrelated but I knew the ROG branding was BS and price inflated from the start when I got the same 4K monitor ROG sells for 3k for 1k... and it's the exact same panel and features
This reminds me of the Athlon X2 days. I gave up on both Asus and Gigabyte back then.
What changed at ASUS? 10 years ago they were the Toyota of motherboards and MSI and Gigabyte were the Fiats.
Asus lost me back in the day with the fan on the early s939 nForce 4.0 boards.  My Asus A8N SLI Deluxe was simply the perfect board for the upcoming change from IDE / P-ATA to SATA III (the usual IDE / P-ATA ports and additionally 2x4 SATA ports, 4 of them were even RAID capable) and the first PCIe graphic cards. In addition incredible 10 USB 2.0 ports, 1 eSATA, 2x IEEE1394 FireWire and on top of that two 1 GbE LAN ports.  Simply perfect, despite the outstanding high price tag (here in Germany the board has cost at that time ~140€ / ~175US$ incl. sales taxes, while boards were normally traded for 60 to 80€, in the extreme case perhaps up to 100€ / 75 to 100US$ in the extreme case up to 125 US$ incl. sales taxes)!    When the measly 6000rpm fan died in the first 8 months, Asus lost me forever. The board was simply too expensive for this pathetic little fan, and Asus hesitant admission of this faulty design simply took too long.
I've had a few Asus boards in the last 6 years. One being an Asus X99 A II, and then a Strix Z490 E gaming and both were piles of junk with audio drivers having issues, causing games to crash, suddenly becoming less stable for no apparent reason while never eluding to what was going on via bluescreens, etc.   I work with computers all day every day and am considered the hardware guru at work. I used to do warranty diagnosis and repairs on campus and am certified in numerous brands including Lenovo, and Apple. Between those Asus boards, I had an X299 FTW K from EVGA and it was super solid, and now I have an MSI Z690 Edge Wifi which has been doing great.   The Strix just one day stopped working at all when I attempted to open file explorer of all things. So I think, hell probably a corrupt OS, or bad SSD or storage somewhere in the system. I unplug every drive I have minus the boot drive, and reinstall Windows to find the same thing. Swap SSDs, and having wiped now 2 good SSDs, find the same thing on the second Windows install. Luckily this is a work from home day for me and I say screw it, drive to best buy, and buy the MSI Z690 and an 12700K. I was extremely annoyed that I was ditching a supposedly good brand and a 10850k that I'd only had a year and a few months. It had acted oddly the whole time I owned it unfortunately. The 10850k now lives in a family members computer, which definitely isn't in an Asus board...
Wonder if MSI has gotten better than the last time I dealt with them...
Want to go for a solid Asrock board... I've been looking at the ASRock Z790 PG Lightning Intel LGA1700 board. It's mostly black. The Riptide looks pretty sweet as well but you might not like the blue accents. I, however, still... very much... dislike the Asrock RGB controller but you have the tools to work around that, lol.  Keep the honesty coming. I love your opinions and information. You have influenced several of my choices when building systems. Thank you!
I think my ASUS X570e is going out. Having issues with my BIOS taking a few minutes to POST or my SSDs take a few minutes to boot. You've just unlocked more worries for me lol.
I know this might not be the exact place but I have had kernel security check failure on opening some games (does not even do it every time, sometimes it happens once and sometimes it just wont work that day), its atm only a few specific games that cause this issue (Rainbow 6 seige, Escape from Tarkov, Destiny 2 and Fortnite) I have looked everywhere only I have updated everything, bios ect I bought new RAM and a new GPU and the issue still exist I have done full fresh install of windows, I have downloaded windows on other drives, and I keep having the issue, is there anyone out there that can help me, its very upsetting to be unable to launch some games when Im about to play with friends.
Honest question: which mobo manufacturer is the considered the most reliable in terms of quality assurance (hardware and bios)?
yeah, i stopped buying asus stuff since 2019 when i tried to RMA my 3 month old ROG Claymore because one led was gone and a few others were freaking out and they not even gave me a "Go f#%$ yourself". Still have my X570-E but when it stops working and needs replacement i'm gonna be looking at what good offers other brands have. And couldn't agree more, their software (Aura) plain sucks...AURA Sync? more like AURA Sunk
My last build was ASUS and Gigabyte components for motherboard and GPU respectively. I've grown to greatly despise these two companies and will never purchase from them again.
LOL!!!!   Conspiracy theory for ya..... Intel Paid off ASUS to eff with AMD chips..... LMFAO🤣😂🤣
It'll be interesting to see how ASUS unscrews themselves from this.
I built an all-ASUS system about a year ago… it’s been a lot of trouble.  My main concern was their Armoury Crate malware.  When it loaded on system startup, it auto checked for updates and if it found any it would - without notifying - cease to monitor system sensors until the update was applied.  It didn’t tell me there were updates, or download them itself… it just checked and if they were available… stopped monitoring sensors.  This happened version after version. As it was in control of the AIO speed and pump, it nearly fried my system a few times as it stopped monitoring the temps.  I ditched the silly ASUS AIO and put on a big ol’ Noctua double stack and CPU temps have been rock solid since.    Eventually the update issue was patched (and the issue with the RGB controllers…), but I still hate that annoying program.  Then, after continued full system crashes I pulled the cooler off the (ASUS) RTX 3090 to find that the thermal compound was only applied (poorly) to half of the GPU.  The rest was still perfectly clean, shiny and probably well-cooked.  Repasted and no more crashes, but my confidence in ASUS is now pretty low.  Next system won’t have any ASUS in it.
ASUS makes a Biostar Valkyrie look like a legitimate option at this point
Im utterly terrified that my Z690 Hero is gonna just brick itself and I am so far out of the RMA window, I am screwed.
DANM!!i love the ROG, funny but you cannot fire ASUS
Thank you for your kind words towards my brand. Hope to have more of ASRock on your content - sincerely from ASRock (MY).
I'm with you guys on this one, Asus used to be my hardware of choice, but every single Asus product I've gotten in the past five years has either had extremely annoying problems, or catastrophic failures. I don't know who to go with in the future, but I know it won't be asus.
Damn so now not only Gigabyte sucks but now Asus too fuck :(
but can you fix it, WITH IFIXIT?  DUNNNO IF YOU CAN WITH IFIXIT...
ASUS:ROG From Republic of Gamers to Republic of Garbage Coming to Netflix 2030 🤣
Damm now i regret buying an asus z690 wifi d4 :(
I think this video was unnecessary, seems like a case of sour grapes to me. If they do not want to give you review units, move on. Focus on the competitor. Sometimes, these can be marketing decisions, these teams can also change in the future, why drag the company in this. Found this video to be thoroughly self serving and unprofessional. Bad mouthing for their response to your team is not doing us a service, it is being self serving.
This reminds me again of when I purchased a Asus laptop during a pandemic and almost burn down the apartment I'm living at due to the laptop. Seems they like playing with fire, which is really a bummer as on how cool and good their GPUs are.
16:21 OOF Shot through the heart with that one. Especially since Asus seems to be taking the least respectable approaches to handling things.
Let's be real, their support has been absolute garbage for a while, lots of shady stuff for a long time that don't get mainstream traction.
Now im terrified that my laptop will crap out. I just bought a new TUF A17 and now im scared it's gonna bite the dust and I'll get screwed out of my $1500
I've been anti ASUS since about 2007
Thanks Jay, I moved over to Asus because of you, (hope you read this ASUS!??!!!?!?). I've used MSI, Gigabyte, biostar, EVGA, asrock. I was really hooked on MSI and Gigabyte, BUT both, in my personal experience have a short life spans. I have replaced my MSI boards at least once on each of my builds and OMG Gigabyte, I have 7 total of the same board,( I could not let the two builds go, they were HIGH end boards and had all the I/O I needed and liked), so instead of just replacing it with something else I just replaced it with the same board. My last two replacements were from EBAY, because the board was no longer being built, (they were more expensive than brand new). Same for two of my MSI builds. ALL that is on me, eyes wide open. Now I have three builds with ASUS boards, two amd and one intel. They haven't given me any problems, but I'm at a point where I was thinking about updating at least one of the AMD builds with a newer board. Then I saw this video..... great!  Well thanks for the heads up! If any hard core builder can recommend a good brand to go with please do! My thanks in advance!!
Thank u for doing good work
You know it's amazing you're all just now figuring this out about them. I've been saying this for over a decade.
I worked for ASUS in the past, ever since then i made sure every friend, family etc stays away from them with a 10ft pole. They are absolute scum when it comes to customer support and especially RMA. They let u pay almost full price for minor repairs just to make u buy something new instead.
Customer gets a smashed pin RMA board.... ::laughs in ISO-9001::
Man someone needs to moisturize 😂
Me and my buddy both got the ROG Strix b450 at the same time. His MOBO bottle-necks every game he plays and mine randomly crashes the PC due to shitty m.2 integration.
I have some AsRock boards and some MSI Boards that work great for me!
Fucking LEGEND! ❤
Thumbs up for standing up to corporate shenanigans.
the more and more I hear about this issue, the more im glad that I went intel this time around. while I do have a Asus Tuf z690 d4 (same one as one of the boxes shown on the table at the start). Im over all happy with the board I got,  there are things about it that are cheep even though its a 260 dollar motherboard, like the cheep and horible audio chip set, USB 3 header pulling out of the board, poor lighting software. etc.
And people think the ROG Ally is good. Asus is terrible when it comes to quality and customer support.
1.88 Million subscribers. 53 thousand views per HR............. They SHOULD care!!!
At this point its just pick your poison ... MSI , gigabyte , ASUS , Asrock .... each have issues of their own. PC building just got worse over the years.
This is so disappointing. ASUS has been my go to brand for laptops and pc components for like 20 years now. My own personal purchases and recommendations to friends and family, I have always said if you have the option go ASUS. This hobby and career for many just seems to be getting worse and worse. So now the $3000 question is, what brands CAN we still trust?  PS- thank you for being a voice for us even when it's news we may not want to hear. Transparency is so important, especially now with so much BS, positive review buying, and selling out for ad revenue that we have to sift through now.
I gave up on Asus back in the Nforce4 days with the launch of the Athlon 64. I had two Asus boards die because they used a little heatsink with a tiny fan on it. It sounded like a bee. They both failed within 6 months, which caused the chipset to die. Unlike the CPU fan, the Chipset fan has no speed monitoring and thus I had no warning the fan had died.  Now my current board is again an Asus, but I bought it in mid 2020 and it was this or nothing. Shockingly it's been a very well behaved board, though it has no fans and just large heatsinks. Generally I bought Gigabyte but even their boards has had issues with a lot of half implemented features. Honestly not sure what board I'll buy next. Kinda wish Abit / Epoch/ Chaintech were still around. Even DFI.
I have been noticing voltage issues with Asus boards since Zen 2 and have videos addressing it. I have had such bad experiences with Asus since x370 that I moved to gigabyte aorus. Not worth the money
Are you going to review the ROG Ally? Despite these issues
Sounds like they were trying to make a scapegoat to remove themselves from responsibility.
similar thing happen in SEA , Asus  has tendency to refuse warranty on gpu , claim that it's a mining even thou it's not. You come back with the receipt from which retailer you bought the gpu , still asus doesnt care , it's still a mining card
I got a 2080 TI from ASUS and will never again buy from them. Always had an issue with the card and the customer support experience was a nightmare. For the company that charges MOST for their parts, its unacceptable.
THANK YOU, I've owed a lot of ASUS products and just ordered the Rog Ally, but I always get warranty with my ASUS stuff their warranty SUCks, and customer service is really bad.
This is very disappointing. Disappointing that a brand as reputable as ASUS (used to be) has gotten to be so crap. ASUS was always been my go-to brand for motherboards, without question. their other peripherals... meh, not so much, except monitors... but not so much for those either recently. I've always had excellent results with them, regardless of the negative reviews on multiple vendor websites. It is very, very disappointing to know that I cannot trust my (and yours) expensive components with their components anymore. I've not had any good luck with G or M brands, so what do you do for AMD stuff? E brand doesn't make AMD boards, yet...... soooo. ASUS... get your shit together and bring back the quality you charge for! I hate that this video has to exist, but glad you made it.
your mobo is shot!
ASUS is shaking in their boots.
I bought a B-650 wi-fi tuf gaming with my 7800x3D. What should I do? It’s been running fine for a month now. I did update my bios not to the BETA version but the one previous to the beta. The bios I updated to says it fixes the voltage issue. I didn’t feel comfortable using the beta that would void my warranty. Newer PC builder, would hate to have to eat the 250 I spent on the motherboard. Someone help! Lol
Been Asus customer forever. Never again! So, what’s the next top/best MB I can look to get in the future??
I am sort of wanting to jump ship from Asus myself, I had the Rog phone 2, had it 11 days the screen broke falling 2 inches in my car onto THICK carpet, I then had to pay for a new screen, something falling that far and onto something that soft shouldn't break. So I jumped to the Nubia red magic 5s (Jesus that was a bad choice, customer services never got back to me for a month over an in house fault they broke when replacing the motherboard after 2 months! I sent the phone back got my money back and they then email me 6 months later saying they have got it back and are going to repair it) I then went to Lenovo and that was a good phone, just I got it too hot and caused a few issues, so decided to go back to the Asus, went for the Rog phone 6d ultimate, had since Jan, and the internet keeps dropping out, shows connecting but not working, turn WiFi off and run on mobile data and same issue. I contacted Asus and there response was "reset your router" and "turn airplane mode on and turn it back off" if that fails it needs to come back for repair. So to keep any data working I have to either reboot the phone or keep messing with airplane mode. It's getting annoying, all the issues are since their latest may software update and they won't listen
That is oddily weird that this video comes out because i was going to consider a rog board too i watched one of your mobo videos about brands and pricing now all sudden this. Well asrock it is over had a asrock board before not as bad as everyone makes em out to be.
Damn.. glad i built a new rig.. my last 1 had the asus mother board
I'm really concerned I got thr asus rog x690e extreme updated the bios to Beta latest in a blind panic and I know voided my 1 week old £1200 motherboard? Please advise guys
I gotta say I agree 100%, if there is a failure there should be a FIX BIOS and nothing else, not a test one, test that in house, or don't and accept the RMA's do not expect your consumers to do it!!!
👍Glad to see tech gurus standing up to companies that are screwing over the public. I have built with ASUS for over 12 years and my last build just didn't go right. Features on the board are flaky at best. Looking at Asrock and others to replace the board. Thanks for bringing this to light.
EVGA#1🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 whAT ARE ASS ROCKS ? LOL JK
I wont be touching asus until they get there act together software wise I will be avoiding them here I come MSI
I swore off ASUS 13 years ago and gave them a decade to improve. 3 years ago I gave them another chance thinking that ten years would maybe get their shit back together.... Well I made a mistake thinking that. I will never buy an ASUS product again and I make sure everyone I know that they need to avoid ASUS at all costs.   Respect to you for dropping them as a sponsor when they keep screwing you and the consumer.
This isn't too surprise.  ASUS has been known for 20 years to have horrendous customer service.  Their motto has always been "fuck you, buy another."  But people kept buying it because their hardware and QC had always been top notch.   Now that they have multiple products that not only fail, but literally could kill you, all they have left is some of the worst customer service in the entire economy, let alone the PC industry.  Like I think you have to go to payday loans to be screwed harder.    Its time to toss them into the bin of garbage companies like Gigabite.
Ahh makes me wonder if ally was planned maybe
Software and Hardware Engineers hired by companies haven't got the skills or brains that the OLD SCHOOL Engineers had. Schools and companies promote diversity instead of quality and skills...sorry, but I don't see any advance unless the company "ELON MUSK" type!
With the Ally just releasing, HOOLYY
I decided many years ago never buy anything again with their name on it. I haven't bought a lot of asus boards, but everyone of them has been junk. Things like "the problem is that add-in card is not  approved'. But everything works just fine changing just the motherboard. The last time was... got a board that had problems that a card would not even be reconized as plugged into the PCIE slot (yea PCIE-1). The drug it out over a YEAR sending me a total of 3 boards all of which were other peoples returns.    First had been dropped on the corner bending the corner and cracking the board  Second seemed almost like an earlier prototype because while it had the same name, it was a bit different layout and parts used. It had a lot of dust from fans blowing, it had some kind of oily residue and most of the electrolytic caps had domed. They were going or had gone bad.  The 3rd was one that had had extreme cooling that from the condensate etched much of the traces on the back of the board under the cpu.   Had a very hard time even talking to them, Not responding to emails and spends hours on hold on the phone. At one point they said "we had a server crash and lost all our emails". Then thye said the board was now out of production and they didn't have any new boards to replace the new defective board. I pointed out that Newegg was still selling them....  I got a new boxed board, but.... I had picked that board because it supported ECC, but when I turned it on, memory check would failed. It also could not recognize the AMD CPU. I sent them the part number the old board called the cpu as well as all the numbers from the cpu and complained about ECC not working. (Was something they had done in the newer bios it had, I think). They responded "We have not technical support contact with AMD"...  WHAT!!!! How could then be making boards for AMD CPU's then??? And not a peep about ECC no longer working.  So I always tell everyone stay FAR away from anything with their name on it. And anyone who raves about how "great" they are, I say has no idea what they are talking about.
I have an Asus TUF Gaming B550M-Plus for my Ryzen 5 5600x (Thank god it's AM4) and it took me forever to save up to purchase the more premium brand as I've had less than ideal experiences in the past with Gigabyte and ASROCK but next time I'm needing to upgrade feel like it may be smart to avoid Asus again since all of this is really scary for the end user especially the poor ones :(
Its shit! 2 Bad boards! Never again! Love your vid
I would MUCH rather have a company do a loud recall "HEY EVERYONE, WE BOTCHED THIS! PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU PURCHASED XYZ!!!" than to find out lots of people have had issues and the company has been sweeping it all under the rug. All companies will make make mistakes, owning your issues and making it as easy as possibly for your customers to get fixed earns respect. It's certainly not fun or comfortable to do but if you don't take ownership then your ass is "Asused" when people find out.
Thought it was just me with the audio issues on my asus mobo, after switching to a gigabyte motherboard for aesthetic reasons I've had less issue, only component that i changed was the motherboard, same windows install and everything
Don't know if Jay answered this or not but. Are ASRock boards affected by these issues as well?
thank you for your tireless work in standing up for us consumers, we really appreciate the effort and time put into your content. thank you.
Asus has always gone after the gamer crowd. Marketing etc. All the wonderful bios settings of which you could never figure out! Even owners of these fancy boards would never admit they had a high failrue rate, it was like how dare you say bad things about my new Farrari in the grage, even though it lived at the dealer's shop. For years influencer's prommoted their products as the ultimate! Glad you made this dicision. Let's just hope that credible youtube influencers stop taking money, products or sponships. I think it's time to remember that is your followers that got you here not being a corporate shrill. Time to set up  a buy me coffee account as well as promoting more of  your go fundme pages. If you really want to become a genuine part of the community, then become a good citizen of it.
OK, re-subscribed, great stuff.
I remember when Asus was a brand you could trust... Sad to see them fall apart.
i bought 4 asus rgb fans for 800000000 dolllars and they only work if i unplug them and plug them back in after each shut down
I’ll never buy an asus board after all this
ASUS have been fucking up their BIOS's for years, back in the X58 days every single mobo didn't have proper IOMMU / VT-D support. It was impossible to run Xen on those boards.
wow
MSI has always treated me rite. Gigabyte used to do shady crap just like ASUS is now doing. ASROCK used to be known as the budget brand boards much like ECS Elitegroup. RMAing an ASUS motherboard or GPU has always met some sort of difficulty. It should be No Questions Asked when you RMA a defective component.  1 of the fans on my Asus RX580 8gb (DUAL-RX580-O8G) video card quit working about 2 weeks after I got it and it caused the memory to overheat. It started artifacting really bad by the time that I realized what had happened. It took almost 2 months of BS for ASUS to send me another card. Turns out that there was a bug in the firmware that it shipped with that allowed the card to run at full clock speed no matter how hot it got. And a design flaw in the dual fan design (both fans were wired together on a single 3 pin header) It could not detect that the fan directly above the die and memory had quit working.
every big brand is all for the money how simple is it they don't care..
Thats it im dumping my asus strix x670e😢
I stopped using Asus boards back since before x570 and was a MSI only guy and thought I would give the $1200 xtreme x570 out but nope it was trash and haven't looked at Asus again. MSI for me have always had the fastest and easiest mem compat. I always wondered why most youtubers seem to be Asus ROG fanboys it nice to see they finally realize they are trash lol.
...i just bought their RTX 4070 Ti.... *sweats*
Thank you for standing up for the consumers once again Jay
Start using EVGA boards now!?!?
With GN and Jay I want to see the cascade of punishment to a brand that is so poor with support deserves. I don't have money to waste investing in brands with this kind of support, good for the people who can switch brands and just say, alright I will move to MSI or Gigabyte and so on, some people buy stuff that need to last and not be a hazzle with our savings. Bye Asus.
Ive had nothing but problems with my rog strix scar g553 since i updated the bios and used my aw3423dwf. It crashes 5+ times per day but its not a bluescreen, it just plays extremely loud static and freezes the screen until i manually shut it down. No errors pop up in event viewer or anywhere else ive checked. Definately not buying their products again until this is all fixed
I was never even aware of Asrock having issues or being seen as the brand you steer clear of.  Been building with their motherboards for 10 years and never had any problems.  The only thing negative I can say is that the rgb software is really bad.  I pretty much let it only control the edge of the taichi boards rgb and then put everything else onto a razer chroma rgb controller.  Watching northridgefix videos though - they seem to have more asus stuff come in for repair than any other brand it seems.
Anyone wondering if Jay realizes ASRock is owned by the same company that owns ASUS?  Yeah, separate management, but still the same ownership.
It's somewhat of a relief to see that people have been noticing more quality problems from what was a reputable company and it's such a shame because they'd been my go-to for last 15 years for everything from Mobo's, to GPU's to even phones,, but the build quality or even the support just seems to be getting progressively worse the later we got through the 2010's. Two Flagship phones I bought (Padfone Infinity, ZenFone 3 Deluxe) both had memory go bad, conveniently when the warranty ended. The Z390 Strix gaming E mobo couldn't run my 9900k at stock, serious instability unless I underclocked and set a manual power setting (A case for 4x4 vrm being a terrible idea).   Honestly, consdiering Asrock this time around, I haven't had one since the Sempron years, I suppose it's time to go back.
I don't understand why it's taken this long to fucking finally accept how bad ASUS' software is. Their hardware is good.   Their quantity and availability are also good. Their software is fucking crap, and I am solely basing that off of Armory Crate. What fucking software fucks over your registry soo hard that you need to fresh install it? I also think that my 3600 inability to handle XMP is ALSO a software issue.  Seriously looking into my ITX build and ASUS is definitely not one of the mobo components that I do not want to use And that goes for their AIO's too, if I need to download armory crate
Wow shit just got real. Cya Asus.
I’ve been building an AM5 system for the past few months. It’s my first cpu/mb/case upgrade since the intel i7 5960x that launched back in 2013.  I saved up and splurged getting exactly what I wanted over time whilst reusing the 2080ti for the time being, as this is how I built my last pc that’s lasted 10 years.  O11 XL Case EK Distro Plate & AM5 velocity block EK Watercooled 2080ti All the new EK satin titanium fittings  2x EK 360P Rads 9x Corsair QL120 fans  7800x3D X670e Crosshair Trident Z Neo 6000mhz 2x 16gb   I’ve got everything installed except for all the wiring and cutting tubing. I’m legit thinking about removing the top rad (which I have connected directly to the distro via fittings making it a royal pain to install and remove) in order to disconnect and remove the mb and replacing it with something else or going Intel AGAIN…..and replacing motherboard, CPU, RAM, and buying a new EK Intel waterblock. I don’t want these issues, and I thought I was buying safe by going with Asus whilst giving AMD a shot. My Asus x99e WS for my i7 5960x has never let me down, and I love the bios….but to see this. To see Jay abandon Asus speaks volumes.  I have no idea what to do. I paid for the 2 year Microcenter warranty on both the AMD cpu and the Asus motherboard, so returning it wouldn’t be a problem beyond the work to remove everything. It’s never even been powered on (welcome to the world of building a pc w/o having an air cooler to test the system beforehand).  I just REALLY don’t want to buy another cpu block and ram.  I stupidly didn’t get the MC 2 yr warranty on the GSkill Trident Expo RAM. For now, I guess I’ll wait and see for awhile until I do something drastic. Regardless how they respond, even if they do a complete 180, the fact that it took this much has me rattled in the Asus brand….which I had on a pedestal until I began this build.   PS. Every MSI motherboard I’d want (6 sata ports) is eATX, and I’m not sure if the added size will conflict with the case grommets or anything else…not to mention I hate the dragon bs.
Wow, first EVGA gone and now Asus gone. Wtf? Just wtf.
I am sorry to hear this.  I have been buying Asus products for 20 years.  Mostly Rog laptops though.  I'm about to buy a new desktop build and since EVGA is no longer in the game I was going to buy a new Asus 40 series and probably a 300 dollar AMD5 motherboard from them too.  Guess I'll pass on the Asus gear this gen and go MSI or Gigabyte.  Takes balls to bite a hand that potentially feeds you.  But in this case it sounds justified.  Just really sad to hear it is Asus shitting the bed they usually make decent stuff, not the best but decent for the money.
I really am sad to see asus fall like this, but even my z390 and 9900k motherboard has a bunch of asus over locking stuff you can’t turn off. Evga has always been my go to brand for graphics cards but with their departure it’s making my next build harder and harder to find products I like.
so since youre  moving forward without asus can i get a 3080ti strix and a z690 motherboard
you should really reach out to ASUS to confirm your assumptions before making a video. apology video in 3...2..1...
I've been using server boards now for over 20 years in my gaming rigs, none of this overpriced consumer plastic crap with cheap chipsets.
I am disappointed that i just got an ROG MOBO and 12th gen cpu, and I definitely don’t want to have to buy a new MOBO just to keep using 12th gen. I do still have my old ryzen combo if it goes downhill
Now I am having second thoughts about ASUS Ally and an ASUS router😢
This kind of STUFF is why I subscribe.
I seriously regret buying an ASUS RTX 3060 now  Hell, I regret installing an ASUS dvd burner in my dad's PC, lol
As a small shop, we saw this coming for about a year. The industry gossip is great.
I remember buying the Asrock x399 fataly motherboard because ASUS and, I think MSI or Gigabyte taking manual CPU voltage settings as "Suggestions". Never thought it would get this bad.
I bought an ASUS AM4 board for my current build based on their reputation but I'm definitely staying away from them in the future. This whole ordeal has been eye opening
Asus, gigabyte and corsair are companies that due to stuff like this and personal experience I will not be buying anything from again
Maybe EVGA can pick up some motherboard business and designers. Jacob, please try to explain to Andrew this is the opportunity to get back at them. You guys literally do right what they've screwed up.
love my asrock steel ledgend board and didnt have to pay asus rog tax
this was of course the year i decided to switch to asus
“That’s anecdotal, I can’t prove it. I digress…” not as good as your regular catch frase :D
Gigabyte and MSI are rock solid in my opinion with all products. ASUS are assholes just after your money for their share holders. 🤬
I appreciate the potential impact this could have on your channel, and i love that you decided doing right by yourselves and your audience is worth more than putting up with bullshit.
Man seeing this makes me so happy that the average consumer is being given a voice thank you. I only wish I could return my Asus strix 670e-e at this point I’m afraid to even use my pc. It’s just a $3500 paper weight on my desk right now.
NM, it wa spun off by Asus.
I've had exactly ONE Asus mb. Had to RMA it 3 times, and finally bought a different board. Asus never gave me my money back for that board  either. It was an LGA 1366 board. They were anti-consumer then, and haven't changed. ASRock may be one of their sub-companies, but they are way more friendly. My first ASRock board was a Z77, and since that did so well, I kept getting them. Have a B650 running a 7900X right now. Not much fuss, updated the BIOS, no warnings about warranty, and seems to be rock solid at Expo for DDR5-6000.
I’ve avoided asus since the Bios flashback button issue you and other YouTubers pointed out on board. Got a 470 taichi and 570 Taichi razor edition in my builds and I’ve never had any issues with the MB personally. Good choice for the test bed
I've been using asus since the 90s... hate that my next build will have to be something else...
YES!  Hulk Mad!  Bang, Bang, Bang!                       Thank you.
True Story
So as an owner of a x670e extreme what bios should I be running?
Oof, makes me reconsider my ROG Ally preorder
Steve would be a way better front person for a heavy metal band than you.
with new Pc build time getting closer its almost a shame to know Ill have to figure out what parts to get as it wont be anything asus.. I dont have the patience of the care for brand behaviour like this, but am not naïve enough to think a stern telling off will make a big company like that change, only way to stick it to them its just dont buy their crap and even then this day and age they will probably behave like that till they go bankrupt.
Thanks Jay for your transparency.  I'm soon to be building a new pc and I will join you in the fight and not use any Asus products! SHAME ON YOU ASUS!!!
How are people just finding out Asus are shite pc parts I have been telling people for years overpriced shite
Huge decission, thanks for the hard work to you and all of your team, massive respect ❤
I've been using Gigabyte boards for a very long time now. I've never had an issue with them. Good informative video. If I ever do stray from Gigabyte, it surely won't be to ASUS...
and here I was stuck on which 4090 to get  Gigabyte OC here i come!
Wow... Jay's really pissed
Where should we go then? Is MSI the only good brand left for AMD motherboards?
I had issues with the Asus that I had and I went MSI and never looked back
Dang, the Ally looked like a cool device. However have another reason not to buy one. That and the steam deck I own is good enough to stick with it.
And this is why Jay has the support from the enthusiast community. Now consider this, imagine you work for Asus and one of the KPIs around hardware quality is the number of units that have had a warranty triggered. It is no coincidence that most of the quality issues are in areas that void warranty.
All these youtubers can keep making these videos dumping on Asus. All it shows me is stay away from AMD in totality for any reason, shape, or form to expect issues. I've never had poor support from Asus, and I'm a loyalty member. Of course with that being said they sent me an entirely new laptop when I had a dead sound card, psu and motherboard beforehand and if you have a bios issue it's not that hard to get a rma. Its being blown out of proportion. idk all guys in tech know the Golden rule if you jump on the newest gear especially since AMD dumps cpu constant stay away the drivers are third party garbage.   Thanks for pressing the issues for putting pressure on Asus though.   Personal rig having issues we all know it's based on AMD issues WITH Asus boards that's the bottom line. Google the difference between AMD and Intel they are paying them to say the experience is the same lol no way.
This is why I love J2C so much. I feel like these guys are enthusiasts that think about consumers first rather than getting sponsors. And sacrifice their own money to keep their morals. Steve is the same way (I just don't have time to attend his daily seminars)
i recently bought a asus b550f gaming wifi II motherboard, it lasted a WEEK, and it was done, had to set ram to lowest settings just to be able to enter windows to get all my data and folders onto a laptop. Asus is horrible, never will i ever buy an asus product again.
My X570 Crosshair Hero keep crashing when I turn on XMP setting, and I call up asus they don't know wtf what to do...
I'd been getting a bit fed up with asus the last couple of years. Then my asus B550 board died after using it for only 2 years. I'd been through their RMA process before and had zero interest in dealing with it again, so I just scrapped the board and bought a new msi board. Been happy with it ever since, and honestly I was a bit surprised how good the bios was. I was expecting it to be a step down from asus bios but it really wasn't. This was my first non-Asus motherboard I'd ever bought and at this point I don't see myself going back. If Asus doesn't want to take care of their customers, there are other companies who will.
Note to ASUS: Goodbye, and up yours. You should clean up your act NOW.
Man the state of the pc market right now is depressing.  I know tons of people that want to get into PC gaming, but man...  Between things being priced out of most people's reach, and then when you do drop $500+ on a mobo from what should be a safe bet like Asus you end up with a situation like this.  It's sad.  I'm not loyal to one brand because why would you be, but I've bought more Asus products than any other brand because I've never had significant issues, and the one board I got from them that was DOA, but it was no hassle at all to RMA it and get a working one.  But with a move like this... unless they make some reverse this decision and apologize, I don't think I'll be buying from them anymore.
I actually swore off Asus products a LONG time ago.  Back when I had my AMD 3800+ Manchester build, I went through 2 Asus A8N-SLI Premium motherboards due to black screen.  Once the 2nd one black screened, the Q6600 was out and I did a build with that CPU and a Gigabyte motherboard.  Also bought an Asus router back in those times and after a week, it would lose connection and would have to be restarted daily to re-connect to the net.  Since then, haven't bought a single Asus product.
Just remember he has better customer service access (direct access to a brand manager) then most, so if his experience is bad that means the general public it will be 10 times worst with 10 times longer to resolve any issue even when spending like he said 1000$ plus dollars. My recent experience with Alienware was so bad that I had to make a BBB claim before customer service would actually provide service. these tech companies now just deny you service to save a dollar in the case you give up.
I blame evga, since they stopped making their great gpus. The whole industry has gone to shit...bad evga...no...bad evga
Honestly Jay just switch your Nebula build to AsRock and work around the aesthetic to it, AMD honestly is partly at fault too but at least they addressed it and told the vendors to follow this criteria they listed it's just ASUS being too hard headed about it. I honestly will probably either switch to MSI or Asrock for my new 7950x3d build I'm doing I just held it off cause of the blowing mobo and cpu news.
It's videos like these where your character and morals shine through that build my confidence and trust in you. Thanks for another great video, will be going to another brand for my new motherboard.
This is how a channel gets respect. Thank you for this video.
ive had two asrock mobo in a row, both super solid, older pro series, and steel legend
If LTT follows suit, Asus will lose big.
I was going to buy a ROG 48" LED 4K OLED to compliment my upcoming build. I guess I am going to go back to the drawing board.
lol...fired
massive respect for this
I don’t know this brand. Well I just pre-order the ROG ALLY..should I cancel it?
Jay, thank you for standing up for us little guys 💯. You chose us over free money!  I always thought the STRIX boards looked really nice , but since the 12th gen capacitor incident. They just haven't sat right with me.   Brands need to realize us PC enthusiast know when buying a part, there is always a chance for it to be faulty. All we ask is if it is faulty help us get it fixed or replaced. The whole fighting warranties and RMA's is ridiculous.
I stopped having anything to do with asus when i had to rma my x99a mobo and they sent me a broken one, and then one with actual BITE MARKS on it. Like, from a human.... Trash company.
May I introduce you to Gigabyte which is infinitely worse than Asus?
Yknow I was just looking into good motherboards for my build, and was about to go with one of their x670 series but I am so unbelievably happy you made this video because you saved me a LOT of money, Jay. So imma get an MSI mobo instead lol
how tf does FOIA apply to a company? that's for government stuff? wtf? they can just tell you to gtfo and there's absolutely nothing you can do other than sue them and get it in discovery...
It's bad enough games being released as late alpha, buggy messes, but $700 motherboards? Hell no! How does this give any confidence in their new hand-held either? Appalling behaviour.
The Asus fan boys are in tears right now. I've been steering people away from Asus for awhile now. I haven't owned an Asus product since the 1080ti launched. I just never believed in them as a company who cares for their customers as much as others do. They're greedy and inconsistent. None of this surprises me one bit. It's kind of relieving that everyone can stop telling me I'm full of shit now lol.
"Asus does not give any warranties whether express or limited as to the sustainability compatibility or usability of the UEFI, its firmware, or its content. " this section does not mention the product or its hardware. it says no warranty on FIRMWARE. thats fine. *"*Except as provided in the product warranty and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Asus is not responsible for direct, special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from using this beta BIOS." lets rephrase: Asus is not responsible for [...] damages, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN WARRANTY and permitted by law" This section specifically excludes anything in the original product warranty and permitted by law. The product is still covered by its original warranty. Asus however will not provide any additional warranty on damages resulting from this BIOS. Example: if this BIOS caused your motherboard to damage your graphics card they would not warranty your graphics card, or corrupted your hard drive due to the use of this BIOS.  The exception of the original product warranty would have them warranty the motherboard . This is a nothing burger. your Product Warranty is fine. nowhere does it say VOIDS PRODUCT WARRANTY. it says the FIRMWARE has no warranty.
i have a asus x470 prime pro....hope it will be ok or is it just the latest ones?
Kudos to the big YouTubers that call out a companies bullsh*t. Ive always bought asus motherboards but after seeing this and Steve’s video, I’m done with ASUS. They want to screw people well they’re going to really feel it when people stop buying their trash.
I had this exact same thing happen to me. Asus Crosshair X670E Gene, "brand new" in box, opened it up, took it out of the antistat bag, and bam. smashed pins in the socket. After a fight, I managed to get *half* the cost returned.
I am 100% Asus right now, but I am on the AM4 Platform and it has served me very very well. I’m sorry to hear that they’ve gone this way.
Damn, Asus has always been my go-to for mobos, and now with EVGA not making GPU's I was planning to use theirs for my next card.  Guess I'll be using EVGA mobos and when it comes time I'll figure out which manufacturer to go with for GPU's (damn sure won't be MSI, don't like their business practices).
Keep your personal amd build and switch motherboards.
I don't have to worry. I don't use AMD.
maybe linus will respond ON THE WAN SHOW!! and luke cause lukes better than linus.  fite me
This hurts 😢 I've never had a problem with Asus, 2 builds first being a Z370 i5 and my current X570 5800X3D. I've got an Asus laptop too with no issues with any of the products ive purchased over the years.Honestly though, after all this, watching how poorly people have been walked over and disrespected by Asus I will probably go another route for my next build. Always loved their MoBo's with the clean looks and great options but the SERVICE NEEDS TO BE THERE TOO. I am greatful to not have had that experience, but I feel bad for anyone that did.  Bye Bye Asus, you did it to yourselves
As the owner and user of the Asus TUF GAMING X670E-PLUS WIFI motherboard, I have to wonder if I would be better off switching to an equivalent from, oh say, Asrock!
Hey, keep your... **STUFF**.
I am so happy, was just about to buy a new crosshair board!
So Steve and Jay say "wtf Asus" and Linus says "I'll take the cash" ? Maybe I'm confused but didn't LTT just drop a nice review of the Ally handheld? That's an Asus RoG product right?
"My disappointments with Asus began with my X99E motherboard when the last BIOS they released remained in beta version forever. After that, my Asus ROG laptop failed - one day I was using it and it simply shut down with only three months of use. In a hurry to deliver a pending job, I rushed to the store and bought another identical laptop, which had the same failure more or less at the same time. Today, my personal computer has a Gigabyte motherboard, and my wife's has an MSI."
My ASUS Prime X670E WIFI board is turning out to be a $350.00 doorstop. As I said before I won't ever buy a product or service from them and I have been faithful for a long time  to the brand. My issue is memory the board will not accept and run stable enough with 64 gigs. With all four slots filled it will not even boot. Contacting their C.S./ or tech support is a laughing joke an I think you're right Jay, even Goliath fell.
I had problems with the ROG Strix X570-E board, and customer service sucks I need 2 of them and had to wait 6 months
Well this sucks I have Asus tuf gaming b650 plus wifi motherboardz hope it doesn't blow on me.
Yeah, I pointed my friend to Steve's vids, and he actually is gonna building his roomie a 13600K system instead of a 7800x3D one.
Next hot take 'Asus is Back'... Coming soon.
I have an Asus x570 Prime Pro and have been having similar audio issues! Sometimes during a raid in Escape From Tarkov my audio will just cut out and devices will reset, and I have to reselect them in discord.
Ouch..Asus was one of my favorite brands and is rampant through my current PC.  Which I invested around $3.5k in parts for when I went to build it.  I really hope it holds together until I decide to upgrade it.  As an avid watcher of your channels, you’ve been highly influential in my PC part choices and guiding light in how to go about building a PC.  So, thank you for your testing of so many products.
Asrock is asus subsidiary right?
Just opened an asus prime b-650 with a broken bios flash button as I started watching this video.
I used AsRock Mobos for years on all my builds up until my last build I got an asus but its a z370 so a while back now. It has been solid for me. I know now my next build will be with AsRock again or MSI.
Wow, really surprised.  Thanks Jay.  My only two builds have been ASUS motherboards using Z97-WS almost nine years ago and recently built w/Z790 Hero. No problems to mention with either of them to date. I appreciate your thoughts and would not have used ASUS after hearing this news because I've been watching your videos for years and have learned so much from them.  I work in the service industry and know that it's not the problems which cause you to lose your best customers, it's the way your customers perceive how they have been treated to resolve those problems.  Hope ASUS gets their act together and you can work with them again at some point in the future.  I do agree, it's ultimately up to ASUS.  Thanks Jay.
So far my ROG Strix B650-E with the 7600X has been working but might start looking to change later once see what Intel does next.  Only reason at the time went back to Asus was for the AMD rig.  Glad to see this and holding to your values and not just taking stuff from vendors.
Damn this was a strong statement. ASUS needs to wake up. Way to go Jay!
id say they can wright all of this  by fixing their shit btw id recommend as-rock
"keep your stuff"
Finally you have seen the light. I have been talking about this for atleast 10 years on youtube. Asus quality is horrible. Also the smashed lga pins is the reason I will no longer be selling computers because I find this common regardless of the manufacturer. Those pins are worse then on PGA chips and are constantly breaking and the manufacturers claim pin damage and void the warranty. They cost me $1000 once because I had to cover the cost of a new board twice with broken pins out of the box. I replaced it with a Ryzen AM4 CPU and haven't had a problem since.
But.. the ROG Ally... 😢
Wow that is so unfortunate, I now know with my next system build I will not be getting an ASUS board. MSI here I come
Thank you for the video. I was just going to use an ASUS board in my brother's build. But now I will be using MSI.
Asus pulled the Intel.
damn i should RMA my asus motherboard with microcenter and try to go with a new brand. just because LOL.
It's sad, because I have legacy ASUS hardware that's amazing. The problem started with the B450/X470 line - I have a B450 board that randomly crashes after I added more ram from the compatibility list, matched to what I already had in there. It'll lock up randomly sometimes, only showing an amber DRAM light. Or my ASUS laptop that's from 2020, right before the pandemic took off. I recently had to replace the cooling fans for it, got replacements from a third party that are designed differently, dropped 20 degrees celsius on my temps. SMH.
asus has been like a time bomb
I wouldn't go so far to shit on ASRock which split off from ASUS in the early 2000s to try and compete with ECS, Foxconn, and BioStar. I have built several mITX pcs with ASRock, and their ASRock Rack server boards are one of the best (support and features). It sounds like the decision was pretty much made up (contract negotiations did not go well, multiple ASUS boards running poorly).   Shame, hopefully their next generation of boards are better or they come out with a revision (ver 2+).
This combined with the memory speed issues I had on the ASUS Prime Z690 and I'm done with them.
This is huge news Jay. Great work.
I am sorry to hear that this channel will not cover asus anymore. I hope that if asus fixes these issues, the product will be covered again because I still think asus is the best regardless of these issues. It seems to me that the asus bios is just not working well with the new 3D chips; I am sure this will get fix in the next few months.   I am glad my asus x679 is running great, and I will not have to do anything else with my pc for a few years.
I bought the Asus Crossshair Hero VI and we had to wait years to get a BIOS update to "resolve" USB issues. All, while MSI and Asrock released BIOS updates that allowed for Zen 3 Support. Asus sold a premium product and didn't support it. No more Asus for me, other manufactures actually take care of their customers. My next motherboard will either be an MSI or Asrock.
Asus ROF Strix
This is so sad to see.  My most recent upgrade and new build for one of my kid's are using ASUS boards based on JTC recommendations.  Thankfully, they are Ryzen 5xxx series, so it's all good.
ASUS always acts maliciously. They can't program worth a shit and they will break your devices intentionally. If you dare to confront them about their updates breaking their own devices, they will ban you from their "community" forum. I will never buy an ASUS product ever again, especially if they put ROG on it and I will tell everyone I can to avoid ASUS like they're the plague, because they *ARE* a plague on technology.
Asrock now the hyundai where asus is the kia
you real for this Jay. ASUS have been steady fucking up since Z690 onwards. and X670E of all things (especially considering the price point) is a ridiculous fail on their part.
My Gigabyte Aorus z390 Master had bad pins on the cpu socket and they still repaired my board under warranty. Amazing board, amazing hardware and one of the few ones that had 3 m.2 slots for coffee lake.
Seems to me you are blaming ASUS for exposing a fault with AMD's processor design.
CANCEL ASUS - Nothing but problems with my z790 build since day 1 and I've been working on PC's since the 1980's.   I appreciate Jay's work and decision to do this.
I'm intending to get a £2,000 PC this year. Thanks for the warning about this company.
I am so glad that I watched this, as I am probably going to be buying a new board in a few weeks and was actually looking at an asus board because of the old ROG board I had. Looks like I am going with MSI then.
I dont have money to donate so i just keep replaying this video and not skipping ads 😂
I used to use Asus all the time and then I sent a 390X in for warranty repair(in theory it should have just been replaced at point of purchase) two weeks after purchase. It was returned to me and I was told the board had water damage and that it was my fault. This was an outright lie and they never saw another cent from me. This was when the 390X was their flagship board and so over the many years since then they lost over $40000 dollars. Fsck Asus to moon. EDIT: The only reason they have released an unwarranted Beta BIOS into the world is to have innocent users do the testing for them. That is complete BS behaviour.
i basically stopped recommending asus boards like 3 years ago and ive hated dealing with them for at least 5 years now the only non asus boards ive had any issues with are garbage bottom tier cheapest of the cheap boards but those are just hardware issues however every asus board ive dealt with has had some kind of issue regardless of price tier   even my old busted ass Z97 msi board that wont boot in dual channel the ethernet port is dead and you cant install windows directly on the motherboard but if you install a drive with windows already on it it works and even with all of those issues you get the thing running and it works fine was able to overclock my 4690k and was stable never had any kind of bsod nothing
👍
I've been an Asrock fan for years. Glad to see them getting some credit! Asus can still take responsibility & bring themselves back...IF THEY WANT TOO!
Is there anything wrong with asrock? They don't do many sponsored videos by I also don't hear anything bad about them.
Shoot dont know if i should get different gpu or still get it thinking of getting asus 4090 oc edition 😅
I just built my 7950X system and I'm afraid now because of my ASUS ProArt X670E board. Can I do anything in the BIOS to prevent any of this?
I've been very happy with my Gigabyte motherboard and graphics card I've been using for three years. I almost upgraded to AM5 and even considered an ASUS motherboard. I am glad I didn't. I'll stick with my slow old (but very reliable) system for now.
Pepperidge farm remembers when asus made the best motherboards
Yup the last 2 motherboards from asus trash. One blew up my cpu 7800x 3d. The other was DOA.  Also,  we need to place blame not only on ASUS but Intel,  AMD, Nvidia. The way they handle their GPU, Motherboard vendors. I'm sure allot of that cost cutting, less QA. Is due to there really small profit margins. Doesn't mean I'm defending them.  But I'm sure it's issue.   Also MSI same issues.  I had a Tomahawk the m.2 fizzled out after 3 months.  RMA was hell. But also had a DOA. I'm using Gigabyte now,  just waiting for them to F up also I'm sure it'll happen.
My MSI MPG X670E Carbon wifi with the 7900x has been rock solid ..ASUS screwed me years ago and have used MSI ever since
go off king 🫅
Try the MSI MEG X670E ACE. That is what I am using after having one ASUS Crosshair  X670E HERO fail with the replacement one now having a bad memory channel.
We've been an ASUS family for over 15 years, but this is enough to permanently lose us as customers.
It's reasons like this is why I always go for your opinion on tech first because I know that it will be unbiased and no bull shit. Really appreciate you guys!!!! keep up the good work!!!!
That's why when choosing pc parts, I don't even consider Asus due to their crazy pricings. They are no longer as reliable as before. Again, their prices for their stuff are just crazy high.
Asus was my go to for motherboards... what is everyone's recommendation now?
I'm now having reservations about building my AM5 build in November around an ASUS motherboard. I want it to last the better part of a decade but now... I guess time will tell
Asus may not care, but I do.  I've used Asus motherboards for 15 years in all my builds for myself, my wife, and friends.   I won't use anther one until they prove themselves worthy again.   Thanks, Jay.
Asus has been going downhill for a long time now. I just never figured they would let it get this bad.
The amount of money some of these boards cost,  they shouldn't have support, warranty and product issues this bad.
I just bought an x670e-i from asus for my new build. 🥲
They wanted to terminate their connection with you long before your decision it seems :)
I think ive used my asus product for awhile.
My last build was Asus but for years Asus has been very unstable for me so I gave up on Asus and my latest rig doesn’t have anything with their brand on it.
I am so glad I went 12th gen hardware when I built a new rig last Dec. Should last long enough for this hardware chaos to work itself out.
Yeah I don't think I will buy buying asus anymore.
Well jay you sold it was going to upgrade always use Asus but not now.
Is this just mobo wide? I just recently had massive laptop issues with them. I got a ProArt (H7600) with a 3080ti in it because I do photo and video creation for school and freelance. Microcenter had a great deal since it was discontinued and I really wanted that OLED color accurate monitor. It was such a nice laptop but Microcenter had it for a month and a half for repairs because of many many issues. I had the laptop for less than a week before giving it in for repairs (not a return because of the great price I got it at). They returned it with the same issues (they did nothing) and when I came the second time Microcenter basically forced me to return it. Saying that it was most likely going to cost more to fix than they are willing to spend (mobo most likely). So they forced me to return it and now I'm looking into the newly launched and revamped ProArt with a 4070 (H7604JI) and plenty more features. I'm stressing because I'm unsure of what to do, and seeing this only makes me worry more about a purchase I was going to make in the next few days. I DONT WANT A MACBOOK LOL...
So I just bought an ASUS motherboard (ASUS TUF Gaming X670E-PLUS WiFi 6E ) should I return it and get something similar ? Or just wait to actually build my pc(first ever btw) until the bios is working properly?
This is sad... I got my start building 10+ years ago, referencing videos hosted by JJ from ASUS.  It's awful to see how much they've declined.  They've been my go to source for cases and MBs over the years, and even their GPUs.  Won't need to do another build for another couple years when my son needs one, but it's not guaranteed ASUS will be my primary hardware source at this point.
And that's from a person that have/had contracts with them.... Imagine what a regular costumer must suffer😢
My problem with Asus is they stopped AI Suite to replace it with Armoury Crate. Armoury Crate is slower, heavier, has less usefull features...  And is filled with webstuff that are useless. I like the brand , but damn why dropping AI Suite that has been rock solid and reliable ??? My actual mb is an X570 Strix E and will be the last one to support it.
When it came to building my 1st PC (before all this stuff happened) I was torn between an ASUS and ASROCK board for my 7950X3D. Flipped a coin in Microcenter and that decided Asrock. Everything is great and it's rock SOLID. I've heard many things of how bad ASROCK was and how their boards were bricks but I think they came a long way.
Asus has been on top all the time that they became complacent and arrogant like Nvidia and Intel. With that I too had issue to with asus boards at 1st I thought it was just a one off thing, but then from mid to top end I had stability and other issues. During the days I was a big Abit fan but when they went down I did use asus. And asus was the brand to get, but was the years pass by brands i considered 2nd class (like gigabyte, msi and asrock) started to catch up.  So finally I took a chance and started using gigabyte and msi plus it was cheaper too at that time.
love my mag tomahawk b660, those asus boards were crazy overpriced anyways
Thanks for letting us know JayTwoCents & GamersNexus I will never buy another Asus products again.
I have only had 3 PC builds so far in my life and 2 have had ASRock boards. They are super solid.
I bought a ASUS hero during COVID, got over charged (of course) and the one that showed up on doorstep was dead on arrival.   ASUS turned off all phone lines so you could only correspond with some asshole through email.  They told me they were out of repair/return stock but told me they were still selling them to new customers.  They made me wait for weeks for them to email me when one was available.  I will never buy another ASUS product again.
I've been starting to waver on Asus myself .. but this confirms it. Thanks Jay!
I've always been ASUS (mobo/GPU), but I'm willing to change the next time I upgrade, because this is dodgy as F*** and quite a warning sign we all should heed. I'm thinking Gigabyte, what are people's experience with them, yes, no?
It has been gotten bad for every manufacturer. They all fucking up in some way or another. Leaders for now are MSI and Asus. But even Roccat and Corsair peripherals are not what they used to be anymore if it's not their top notch line.
Jay pulling an EVGA!
Damn! I lost EVGA cards and now ASUS boards, I don't know what my next build will look like! Thank you for the video.
An ASRock board more stable than an ASUS one. RIP ASUS.
"uh hey, keep your *STUFF!!!!*", lmao
Good job Jay!! Thank you for looking out for us!!
Over the last 10 years or so, Asus has been going from bad to worse and then repeating that cycle.
Really standing up, even though I'm sure it hurts a bit financially, or equipment-wise for build options!  It's a little annoying that so many of these board manufacturers trade blows with bad practices and PR at offset times. I've had some horrendous issues with a couple Asus laptops and warranty troubles from them, so ultimately decided on MSI for my AM4 Desktop build a year or so back; but that wasn't without the feeling of some guilt as MSI was in the middle of some terrible stuff going on (I remember Steve burning the MSI mascot stuffed animal in a video around the time, maybe a bow and arrow was involved?). Before then Asrock was put to the coals as they were using some strongarm and blacklist tactics on a lot of smaller media outlets (a fairly common practice in some eastern markets from what I understand, but definitely NOT how you successfully interact with western media). Gigabyte/Aorus seems to be mostly quiet, but I don't see a lot of outlets covering them nearly as much so maybe they've had some issues I'm unaware of.
If you want to offload an Asus board, I could use a Z790
That's so sad, Thanks for the info Jay.
Everyone crapping on Asus and it's bad mobos that killing x3d chips  Me with x570 and 5800x3d and latest BIOS update: *heavy sweating*
I never thought I would see this, kudos to you jay thank you for doing the right thing
I broke down and spent the most I have ever spent on building a PC all ASUS ROG and I have had nothing but problems, the ROG monitor was the most pain in the butt item I ever had to RMA.
I bet one of those boards is the one I had to return!
Kinda sad, isn't?
Guess I'm sticking with my Ryzen 7 5800x and Asus AM4 B550 board.
We love you Jay, thanks for being open and honest with us. Your unwavering dedication inspires me
Thanks Jay, so boycotting Asus along with Anheuser Busch / InBev 🤙
I miss ABIT.  Those folks made the whimpering celeron into a monster in the 90's and my standards have apparently not met up with reality, since.
so stay away from ASUS stuff is the bottom line
I have Asus tuf z630 🥲
Wait... I have a High End Asus motherboard a few years old and Ive been having those same problems. Devices disconnecting my switch sound going outm just a lot of weird problems like that. I also had a Rog phone 5s pro and the wifi died on it. Had to beg them to fix it and they had to replace the motherboard. This turned out to be a common problem on the Rog phone 5. Asus has been my favorite brand but they have gone down hill...
I stopped buying ASUS MB's since 2013. I had issues with Asus P9X79 Pro.. 3 defective boards(2 were replacements).. I kept the last one since it was the least 'defective' one and was able to work around it(ram slot issue). I remember the 'fake board' excuse the last CS gave me.. like he didn't read his notes that they sent me the board.. Hehe..
hmmmm...well over the last 25 years I have only used ASUS or MSI.  I currently have an all ASUS build...  I may have to make a change in the near future for my new build.  I am really sorry you had to make this decision @JayzTwoCents.  Thank you for always communicating with us and giving your honest opinion on what these companies do and do not do.  God Speed to you and your team.
Amen!!!!!!!
There video cards are heavily controlled by NVIDIA etc so they can’t troll as hard. But there video cards even seem to have a higher failure rate
Does this mean no ROG Ally content?
I have the exact Tuff Z790 D4 board in my new 13600k build that you have on your table. I guess I'd better keep my fingers crossed.
I got a asus prime b450 and the power delivery was terrible, the xmp settings didn't work and couldn't do the advertised ram speeds. I took same ram shoved it into a MSI motherboard and it could run the ram speed, and the same cpu could clock higher due to proper power delivery vs improperly. It would randomly bluescreen with a 2600x. The only thing good I can say it does support is the athlon 3000g's intergrated graphics.
ASRock did me dirty and I lost out on 1400$ thanks to a crappy RMA experience, after buying their RX6800 during the shortage. ASRock is not a good example! They also returned me a refurbished or used GPU to replace my broken GPU, and it only lasted 3 months. They even tried to charge me extra for it because it was a RX6800XT. Imagine if I had to pay 60$ to ASRock not knowing how to tell a product is not new. 1400$ is a LOT of money to lose when you're a single dad with a modest job. ASRock is forever on my shit list! Sad to see Asus go, but I have been suspecting their quality was going downhill since Armory Crate being so terrible.
that's why I stayed at AM4, works great, performs great and it's stable
J the hardware issues started 4 years ago with Drivers them putting wrong ones on their site for other parts
i had 2 brand new 4090 strix bad straight outta the box and took asus 3 rmas to fix my z690 asus Maximus extreme.... i thought I was loosing my mind
I dumped ASUS back 10- years ago. I'm mianly MSI now days and I'll use AsRock as well. Both MSI and ASRock has treated me good in the past with RMA. ASUS told me to pound sand.
IDK if this is a motherboard issue, but I upgraded pretty much everything including my motherboard. With the new ASUS motherboard, I can't run 4 sticks of ram at 3600 (or 3200, or 3000, or 2800...) It could only run it at 2400. Super weird. Luckily I only need 32gb, so I just switched to x2 16gb sticks.
I've had constant issues with ASUS's motherboard software. It never works but the only part that does is their garbage game store they shove in it. I regret ever buying an ASUS motherboard or GPU.
This makes me so glad that i went with the gigabyte z690 aours master motherboard then the gigabyte z790 aorus master motherboard, all most went with an asus border very glad i didn't.
ASUS sucks but now MSI's signing keys have been leaked AsRock seems to be the one to stick with.
I had an issue with my Asus mobo a few years back (2010). I live in NZ and they had to ship it to Australia to fix it. It took 6 weeks and I had to build a new PC because I couldn't just not have a computer for 6 weeks. I made a decision not to buy mobos from them again... although I haven't actually bought anything from them since.
Man, im glad these issues dont seem to be a thing with their X570 boards, im probably jinxing it by saying that. but my rog strix X570-E gaming wifi II has been rock solid. sounds like im probably going with an MSI board the next time i upgrade with all this.
Hmmm ASRock makes Radeon GPUs and motherboards... so I will have to consider ASRock.
Asus: "OKAY BYE JAY" clearly contract dispute. Jay sounds a bitter ex
I just bought a Asus board. Gonna look into returning it.  Edit: Got 15 days! I'll be retuning tomorrow!
Sapphire is probably as bad.
Wow!  😳  I've only ever used ASUS motherboards and I mean for decades. After watching this, I won't be.  Well done!  👍  On a side note, I remember the early bios' for the i7-5960X used to fry them.  I know, I have one!
I rarely feel bad for giant companies but I feel really bad for amd lol asus is really making them look bad and you know most normal users dont know whats going on and just see "amd"
Does anyone know a good looking white mobo for AM5? Preferably around 200 to max 250$ Was gonna get a "ASUS ROG Strix B650-A Gaming WIFI" but im very unsure rn. Ive got a couple months to go til i will actually get all the stuff so maybe ASUS will have fixed the software shit by then but if theres a viable alternative id be glad to check it out
I’ve always found Asus made great hardware but their software/firmware sucked hard. Definitely not the best customer service either. And I’ve built a few hundred computers typically with Asus boards. Will be looking closer at alternative going forward. Hopefully others do the same and maybe Asus will smarten up someday
Rog Ally would have been a great product if they didn’t lie
I recently bought a ASUS TUF 650 PLUS AM5 for my Ryzen 7 7700x and as been very unstable, i already updated my bios for that beta version, seems to have solved the issue, but i didnt notice that i was voiding my guarantee, what a shame for not saying another thing...oh well....last ASUS  product for me. Thank you for the vídeo.
I've posted it a dozen times on this channel, ASUS RMA and QC is absolute garbage and I've been waiting for them to finally be called out. A quick trip to r/ASUS will show you how horrible of a company they are. Any time I see someone about to buy anything made by them, I just ask them to check the subreddit and read through the horror stories.
I’m quite gutted tbh, I used recommendations from your channel and Gamers Nexus to build a system using ASUS x670e-e and 7800x3d just a few days shy of this news breaking, now I’m super worried about my system
not me watching this and literally having a Z790-E Strix mobo waiting for me to unpack it next week, fingers crossed everything is going to be ok lol
Maybe Asus had a change in management usually it's the people behind the brand that usually fucks up a good brand.
Asus was great a long long time ago. But as of the last 5 years I have seen way to many of Asus's motherboards go bad for my friends and myself.
Agreed Jay, agreed, but whom do we buy from now cause MSI is no good for me because they have a history of board fails and now the recent msi Intel boot guard keys hack and i hate Gigabyte Aorus branding.  Thanks a whole heap ASUS.
frick asus over priced faulty products, i say boycott them until they learn
And This is the reason I still RESPECT you so much! Very straight up, to the point. Spittin FACTS!
Bro that really sucks, I thought asus was on the way to repairing themselves after the z690 incident, so much so that 2 months ago I built a PC with a z790 apex like in this video and a white asus 4090 to match. I guess I was lucky with my components cause I personally had no issues, but I did hear a lot online about the Apex boards arriving bent like a banana brand new. Super disappointing to hear this all come out now
I recently got a new system from NZXT BLD, and they only had two AM5 motherboards available at the time I ordered, an MSI and an Asrock, both mid-range boards.  I got the Asrock, and was disappointed when I ordered that I had to settle for Asrock because they didn't have an Asus, my previous brand of choice.  I am no longer disappointed.  My 7800x3d ran a little warmer at idle than I liked (mid 40s), but after replacing the glass front panel with a mesh panel and installing a new bios (one that did not void my warranty because my warranty is for the system as a whole through NZXT and because Asrock aren't being assholes), it's idling in the low 40s and mid to high 80s when under stress.  I can't believe I'm glad I got an Asrock rather than an Asus.
customer service is the very point of business let that go and you let your business go i dont have any asus products but after this im not interested
Funny I don’t trust any company anymore. But asus HW is not even good anymore. Looks good but there PCB layouts are really bad
EVGA please come back to us!!!!!
Imagine that. Companies cutting corners to reduce costs and increase profits. Reduce quality, layoff staff, increase prices, ect. Capitalism baby.
Don't forget the 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports on the Z790 ROG Maximus Hero that crashes the connection every few seconds and 7 months later, they have yet to fix.
Love it. I know that wasn’t easy.
glad i went with a gigabyte bord this time around first time in 10 years im not running asus
i think this kind of behaviour was the reason why minfactory doesnt sell asus anymore at their store. i stopped buying asus when they didnt gave me the dvd-drives which were promoted for buying a b450 board.
I respect your decision to end your relationship with them.  For $600 you can buy 3 motherboards from other manufacturers.  They may be a generation older, but they are much more stable and trustworthy than they are at the moment!  AMD and ASUS have pushed the envelope too far and now it will be time to settle accounts.
Are there any white AM5 motherboards with a decent amount of rear USB other than Asus’s ROG X670E-A? I was planning on getting it for my next build, but I’m getting more and more afraid of going Asus.
I don't know the truth, but I heard MSI had a major security breach. Any information on this?
Man if there was ever a time for EVGA to make a triumphant return...
Every company goes through these phases, it's just like Western Digital vs Seagate HDD's. etc
No longer an Asus customer, good to know where their intentions lay.
My main reason for never having bought ASUS is summed up by current GPU prices.  ASUS Tuf 4090 - 1800 euros. Strix, 2100 Euros.  Cheapest 4090 being 1600 as of writing this. The ASUS tax is borderline insanity. Especially since they released the 4090 strix for 3000 fucking euros.
Well done Jay. Asus not so much fix ya shit
Asus sucks. They screwed me over with an RMA for a motherboard that had known issues and used an unrelated issue to weasel out of the warranty. Luckily I used my credit card to file a warranty claim. I WILL NEVER buy anything from them again.
well..goodbye asus, thanks for all the fish.
If Jay had a loooong time issue with Asus, why wait till now to part ways and vent? After getting all this TUF and Strix motherboards and RTX4090s and also for personal builds…. Asus has screwed up big time, I dont disagree (I’m also using a ROG x670E-I mobo +TUF GPU) but this is just a Jay rant for ratings imo as other techtubers are complaining about Asus and Jay needs his 2c worth noted as well.
Would anyone recommend getting a new board? I’m using the same processor and board that jay mentioned and while my cpu hasn’t blown up yet, the other day it just stopped posting and for whatever I couldn’t get a signal through my display port (don’t know if that’s related to anything) post codes were saying ram issue. My system is functioning normal now and hasn’t had any problem since (about 2 weeks ago) but all of this has me very concerned to say the least.
I'm a closet Asus fanboy. Time to start rooting for another team, me thinks. Thanks for the info Brother.
iv ben waching this channle for about 4 years and he has the best explanation you can think honestly
Now Asus is just giving away their broken boards.. to Jay of all people. 🤪
Asus used to be such a reliable brand. Guess I'm gonna stay clear of their products for a few generations going forward.
Now I wish I had waited a few weeks before buying my motherboard.
Can't wait till this week's WAN SHOW because linus is the influencer I associate with Asus. Like i associate Steve and in lesser extent you with evga
Asus used to mean something. you were paying for a confidence that you had some of the best hardware.  now its just bad.
It's a shame about ASUS. Every computer I've built for nearly 20 years has always been with ASUS motherboards. I'm glad I went with MSI for my last build a few months ago.
R.I.P. ROG
*thinks back to his traumatic experience with armory crate*  all that shit for a gpu color and removing that shit is even worse and and... AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH !!! srsly tho asus buzz off
Greeeat....saved for 2 years for a $fu$  build and sure enough it has a asus board. Good thing Digital Storm has 3 year labor and 1 year parts warranty.  🤨
now this is just sad to see from asus especially sense i daily drive one of their laptops...
damn Makes me question my ASUS products..havent had issues yet....Yet is the question.  Im on a last gen system tho...ASUS x570 TUF Pro WIFI  Nvidia 3080ti EVGA  AMD 5900x
Bruh the ending 😂. Leave them hanging like they do to you.
Yay....  recently purchased a strix 670e-e and 7800x3d.. now im scared as fuck 🥲
If I was AMD I would remove Asus'  ability to make amd compatible  mobos
Jay WOW wtg to. Stand up for the little guy now I need your help I was just ordering a Asus board for I9 13 gen what board would you recommend? Now I can not support a big business that doesn't care about their customer so please give me a recommendation please
Lol i had issues with asus last year with a warranty. I told them you never getting another penny from me again. They changed there tune quickly. I got my new board and then sold it and got a different company board. Still not getting another penny from me
Jay, you are a man of "Tegrity", and I respect that. I use to swear by Asus, I would never buy anything but their motherboards, During the pandemic I couldn't get the Asus board I wanted, I ended up with an MSI board with blew me away and it has lasted me two CPU's, if and when I upgrade I will definitely buy MSI again, but I no longer trust Asus after all the stuff they have pulled over the last few years.
I have spent 200 dollars to fix a notebook asus didn't care to - bad mounting pressure on heatsink, terrible liquid metal application ect. It's an endemic problem with this brand. They stopped caring. They have become Dell.
ASUS just became A SUS
I've been buying ASUS boards and computers since 1995. Never had an issue. Don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Jay isn't finsihed with Asus either - lol gauranteed. Of course I'm running an INTEL CPU.
I’ve had plenty of ASUS products and haven’t had any problems. I’m sorry your experience has been different.
Hai jayz, asrock now makee veryyy goooddd mobo, best interface in bios, easy to use
The quality of ASUS is no longer there they are lazy with BIOS stability, PCH overheating, Z690 Hero capacitor blow up debacle. now their boards are killing CPU's. Zzz
Wanted to build a rig with rog card and mobo but will use other brands now.
MSI may supply test bios but it is o on a case by case and has to be requested A policy I think is good for the end consumer.  But  In all my years of PC building started back in 1990 I have never ever seen this happen where Firmware voids you warranty. I have and use ASUS GPU thank the stars I stoped buying ther mother boards several years ago,  The ROG branding is actually what put me of using ASUS in the first place
Oh my gosh
Is it just the x3d cpus that’s the problem on the boards
Thanks Jay.  Keep the public eye aware.  Shout out to Steve too for the work put in as well.  I will no longer support ASUS until they can prove to customers that trust is guaranteed.
It takes a lot of balls and an absolute metric FUCK LOAD of integrity to not only cut ties, but PUBLICLY cut ties with a dedicated video. not a tweet, not a short, not a community post, but a full video.  Hopefully this pimp slaps some sense into Asus, but they have a long LONG road ahead of them before they earn any level of trust back
THANKS BOYS
I just ordered all the parts for a new build this week with a new 13700k and an Asus tuff board 😢  wonder if I should send board back and go to msi
been done with them back in 2016
I never would have thought in a million years that ASRock would turn things around, but I'm glad they did, because they couldn't have picked a better moment to shine than right now.
Based
So I think it was a good decision to get an ASRock  x670e PG after all. Running AM5 for a month now, working like a charm tho
Disappointed
I have been building PCs since 2006. I have to agree with Jay. ASROCK has come a long way. ASUS has really fallen off in support and QA with their motherboards. I now have a X670E Gene with a 7950X. I am thankful that I don't have any issues whatsoever. I am staying away from AMD on ASUS and I am not recommending it. This was an issue with MSI on X570 with DOA boards. Both companies need better QA and RMA procedures.
Jay, learn the lesson. Asus, MSI, and GB ALL have serious issues in their past they don't take care of. The ironic thing about all this; the Asus spin off brand, ASrock is the brand adhering most closely to specifications provided by AMD on AM5 and they were the closest on AM4 also. Which brand isn't having issues..... oh yeah, ASROCK! The Taichi is a monster board and slaughters the Asus boards in many ways.
Asus has become the joke of motherboard world…not what they once were, especially gpus
So what about b550f gaming motherboards? Are they still safe to own? I really don't want to have my system fail due to something I don't have control over...
I have the 670E HERO for sale if there are any takers :)
"Hey, look, this bios will fix our problem" You mean it will fix the problem? "No, it will fix our problem" Like, the royal we? Mine and yours, right? "(Silence)" Right?
Losing eVGA GPUs and now Asus has become lackluster. After 20+ yrs of brand loyalty, Gigabyte is filling my boxes lately.
more and more overpriced bullsxxt is the way to go! So it seems.......
I got the x570 Taichi Razer Edition and it's been absolutely stable as hekk.
I fell in the exact same problem hole as Jay. Needless to say, ASUS has gone all the way down on my list and I shall never recommend ASUS again, UNLESS they actually show improvements. Luckily for me, I figured out how to fix the EXPO RAM instability, which was an insane hassle to find out. But I do have other issues that Jay mentioned that I also start to have. Like my Wireless mouse keep disconnecting and reconnecting, can you like not do that, ASUS MoBo?
damn
this is so sad i have been a big fan of ASUS i have always trusted them all my AMD Rizen builds have been with a ASUS Crosshair Hero 6 & 7 motherboards and my present build is a  AMD 5900X with a Hero VIII i have a ROG Claymour Keyboard that cost me £200 because i beleived in the Brand so much i even bought a ROG Strix VEGA 64  but I Replaced it with a Gigabite Aorus Master 6900XT and my next build will be a 7900X with a Gigabite AORUS Master Motherboard i am also done with ASUS the same as Jay i saw what was going down a long time ago but it was not untill this Video Jay posted that i realised that i was not the only one that dose no longer trust ASUS   R.I.P. a once Great Computer parts manufacturer
If you been with asus for over 23 years, it been up and down, in quality and service,  over the years, you dump a  board, get next gen one.  Msi have gotten better,  but their rma is bad in Australia.  (Esp in 2008 2010.).  I when to asrock, when they board when good, but it went down, I when back to asus.(asrock z170, x99 was ok).  (Gigabyte release a matx board z170m) that have massive compatibility problems with standard ddr4).  Asus mboard have been getting worst in value for medium to top boards.  Best last good board was geni z170, and strix z270, then price when up.
Dude, way to jump into the band wagon... not posting anything good other than "Look at me, I had problems with ASUS too". Good damn this is why I don't watch this channel, you bring nothing to the table other than complaining.
It's funny ASUS is closing and deleting any comments on this or the AM5 issues on their ASUS PC DIY Fbook group. They said ASUS will be in contact with Jay hahaha
I like ASUS. I stopped watching.
thermaltake, asus ... evag video cards... you goping to become a car channel now?
I don’t normally “Like” any YT Video. But, today, this video has pushed me to do so. In the hope that my acknowledgment will push for change. Even if fractional.
Wait but ASUS came out with a non BETA version for my board
Amazing. They screwed me on the Dark Hero mobo. And NOW you are done pocketing ASUS money for your bogus reviews. You suck just as bad as ASUS.
Their AI Optimization is also crap.
Thanks for the info! I built my latest system with an ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero and that will be the last ASUS motherboard I use because of all of the mess people are experiencing. Thankfully I have thus far not had any problems with my build. For me, one of the key decision points I use when selecting what to use is how the customer service is. I had nightmares with HTC for example around my old Vive VR Headset. It was so bad that I will never use any of their products again. While I haven't experienced ASUS customer service, I have heard enough to know it's time to move on to another brand (and I've used ASUS for decades).
You aren't free from MSI, their source code got released and all motherboards are now vulnerable to malware.
So going Intel I'm safe?
MSI 💛and Gigabyte 🤍
Stuff
All manufactures make mistakes there no avoiding that, but most understand this and get ahead of the problem. Asus response is so utterly brain dead it is frighting in it's arrogance and it doesn't need to be this way.
I was wondering when Jay would weigh in on this.
As someone who bought a asus board a few months ago for my 13900K and I’ve honestly regretted it. Just the poor customer support and everything else that’s been happening I’ve truly regretted my decision.
I just love how prices are getting higher and higher, yet quality keeps getting lower and lower.
finaly openig your eyes after armoury crate being a built in virus breeking boards
Ouch. Respect it though.
Intel…We run hot, but we don’t explode… AMD/ASUS…Hold my beer
Just wanna say my X570 Crosshair hero has been solid for 2+ years. Not a single blue screen or freeze.
💪👏👍🖖
Asus was always my goto for pc builds- and every motherboard and GPU I ever built with was Asus.  Strangely, my last build was the first time I used other brands.  Now I'm really glad I did that, as it's obvious the warranty would have been useless.
I have never been a big fan of Asus.  Respect!
I said it in the comments in your personal build video but I have only ever had problems with ASUS motherboards. Not that they're bad but I haven't had the best luck with them.
Wasn't MSI also in the dog house?
Glad to see creators like Jay and Steve step up and take a stand against these scummy corporations in the name of informing and protecting consumers, while true to form, Linus is too busy raving about and shilling Asus stuff the same day this video goes out.
Thanks for sharing this. I have been feeling the same way toward where I am working. The managements care more about their bottom-line than their own staff employees. To the point that some people work 12hr work shifts and they still say that they are not working hard enough... it is quite discouraging when companies care more about their bottom-line than what they say they care about... and like how you ended that video, "but you don't care"
It’s in the name. aSUS.
I have purchased 3 Asus motherboards, two Asus laptops, one Asus tablet and one Asus video card.  I have had zero issues with any of these products.  After bad experiences with EVGA and MSI I am not sure where to turn for my next build.
Yeah, was considering getting the ally even though i have a deck but with how shady their rma practices and putting blame on consumer is insanity, i will not be getting one
Funny you mentioned MSI ! Sound like their updates may be compromised after being hacked. Asus quality has gone to seed and I do not know if I can trust an update from MSI. Ngreedia is trying to bust everyone's wallet. Microsoft forcing everyone to 11 and most people do not like it. I guess I'll have a bud light and take it in the can. P.S. Biden is still are fearless leader.
Pride comes before the fall… Asus
Wauw that's crazy. In Europe Asus gives best warranty support without paying for it like with apple care of Dell version.
I have a Crosshair Hero sitting unopened in the box. Planned to build tomorrow. Now I feel like it's back to square 1. Ugh!
I am currntly using a ASUS vivobook gaming series laptop and over the years, the maintenance I had to do for this laptop made me into a PC/laptop repair person. I can now literally fix my friends' laptop/pcs just because I had to put that much time and effort to keep this laptop going.
Wild. Ok, I will stay away from ASUS from now on. Screw them.
Hey Jay since when was Overclocking a right, as for manufacturers not warranting things, I remember an IBM ISA modem card that had the No Warranty printer on the board! In the white silk screen. Over clocking is an entirely at your own risk, didnt someone mention that AMD didn't recommend OC for the new 3D chips?
Never bought Asus before... It was great. I buy Asus... Everything goes to hell :(
WOOT Team Blue for the WIN :)
This whole fiasco has been par for the course every time I've given ASUS another chance since at least the FM2 era. I will not be buying anything from them again, and I haven't in 5 years or so, I wont even buy used parts they've made. The last good part I've gotten from ASUS was a GTX660(11 Years ago). It's a shame because they were the only parts worth buying when I started  working on computers back in the Pentium 3 era.  My Gigabit has had ZERO issues that I didn't cause my own dumb self.
I have an Asrock Z690 Phantom Gaming D4 for my I5 13600K. It was the cheapest Z690 board. I haven't had any issues and still have BIOS updates. So, that board seems good. I didn't know they had a cheap reputation lol
Got to show these outfits that “you’re mad as hell and not going to take it any more!”
Was considering waiting a bit and getting an ROG Ally over a steam deck, guess ill get the steam deck after all...
Thanks Jay, you giving non-biased reviews on the current tech and the issues with certain items or even brands led me to going away from Asus for my 13900K build. Happy to say I am thoroughly satisfied with my Auros Elite AX and it's in huge part to you. Thanks for not steering me wrong and keeping me from wasting hard earned dollars with my first upgrade in over 11 years, old rig is an i5 2400K w/Asus Maximus IV Extreme-Z.
I was seriously considering getting an Asus board for my 7950x3d because I loved my Zephyrus G14 I got a few years back, running a Ryzen 4800HS. Ended up going with the Asrock Taichi Carrara for my build, and I'm so happy with that decision after hearing of all the problems people are having with the Asus boards. Rock solid BIOS and performance (this is what I heard before making my decision, and I have found it to be true), quick boot times, and all around just no issues. Plus it looks sick in my mostly white build.
The fact they announced their Steam Deck competitor whilst all of this is happening is awful. Their stocks skyrocketed today after announcing their newest product. It's so sad to see them get rewarded for cool new products when stuff they made not even 10 months ago is literally catching on fire.
RIP. Right when the Ally got officially announced and presented too
I guess I should count myself lucky that I haven't bought anything from Asus in years, only because I'm superficial enough to think "Republic of Gamers" is way too cringe to have anything to do with.
Jay - "Second I went live this happened..."   Linus interrupts video in a Build Redux ad.  I laughed out loud.
After a bad experience with an ASUS MB in 2014, I stuck with MSI which I have been using since early 2000s. Honestly wouldnt buy any other brand. The day MSI becomes junk is the day I leave PC gaming.
bye bye ROG Ally.
What the heck, Asus?  I requested a FREE motherboard, and you sent me a FREE motherboard... although used.  When I ask for something for FREE, I expect it to be brand new!!!!
To sum up this video. Fuck Asus
Asus might not care today. But when sales drop they will all the sudden "find" that backbone....
i honestly dont think you should wash away AMD from your personal rig, i know my word means nothing but saying youve been "AMD'd" because of asus puts a lot of distrust in AMD users. the chips are solid, the board wasnt/isnt. id go for another board and then you can give an unbiased opinion on daily driving an AMD system
Guess you'r'e going to need a new chair as well, considering it's a IKEA/ASUS chair 😅
Meanwhile at MSI - "So JayzTwoCents is single now? Uhm Ok". Sponsoring incoming I guess.
Idk, complaining your getting used parts as a free handout and making it sound like you’re an angry customer is cringe. I get jumping on the hate bandwagon, true or not everyone is doing it for views winces GN’s video.
Asus was so top of the line for so long.  Crazy how they have let themselves go.  I was Asus only for 15 years. But the last 5 years ive watched them drop big time. I switched 4 or 5 years ago.
I really wish DFI would reboot the lanparty series and come back to the consumer sector. This is the perfect time for it.
I agree. I've been in supporting ASUS for 15 years. I'm done with this company.
I stopped buying Asus motherboards for me and my customers a few years ago.  Lately I have been buying a lot of MSI boards for builds, but still buy Gigabyte boards occasionally.  As for AsRock, I have honestly never had any issues with their boards like ever.  Most of the time I pick them for simple builds, but they run pretty solid.  Gigabyte is a mixed bag, but usually I have good luck with them.  And MSI boards have yet to fail me.  My latest build is running a basic Z790 chipset (Pro Z790 P WiFi DDR5).   Lower price point, but so far, solid.  Running a 12th gen i9 on it, no issues.  My last 3 systems have all been MSI based.  One of which is an MSI laptop.  All of them have been solid so far.
I'm running an Asus strix 690 and it makes a popping / crackle sound through my speakers.. Pulled my sound card and had same problem. Looking for a board replacement
Wow!  Thanks for being a voice for us "little guys."
Unfortunate timing to hear ASUS doing this right now.  While not a motherboard, currently looking to upgrade my video card and an ASUS is the closest one in my budget, but as you stated, their actions are causing harm to their consumer confidence.   So, I may end up moving up the price range and getting a MSI or EVGA if I can find one.
I guess when I'm ready to upgrade to AM5 or 6, I'll go with MSI or ASRock. Also probably going to watch carefully and not jump on Asus' Steam Deck competitor
Not to dogpile, but I've had stability issues with several ASUS boards in my last few builds - X570 and then Z690.   I put in an Aorus X570 board recently (that I got for a steal used) and it was rock solid stable.
Looking to get a mother from Asus the Asus Prime z790 wifi 6 E for Intel !!! Will it be in the safe zone to own a Asus motherboard or get something else!! I don't want none of these issues for my first build!!!
FOIA or NDAs?
The reason I usually avoided Asus products mostly  because of the price. People say more money can buy nicer things but as you have shown here, that's not the case with Asus. Nowadays brand like AsRock and Biostar still in the industries because they are reliable in product quality and functionality, and that's what Asus need to be too instead of just making a better looking products.
So i have asus motherboard that is effected what can I do? I can write them, but I'll never see a dime back. What's my next move?
Dang, of course this happens right after I make a near full Asus PC build.
I've currently got an Asus motherboard in my rig and I've been thinking of moving away from their products for a while just because of their AWFUL Armoury Crate software, so this makes that decision so much easier. Thanks for calling them out on their bullshit!
As someone who works in the industry... They all suck.
there’s a tech repair guy that CONSTANTLY fixes asus laptops, like the most devices they see is asus laptops
slow clap, great job J
This really validates my struggles with ASUS back in 2020 when I was trying to build my first computer. I got an ASUS ROG Strix B550 that had a messed up ethernet chip (was getting like 5 mbps up and down stream) 3 different motherboard replacements before the 4th finally had a working chip.
ASUS is becoming the "West Coast Customs" of the industry, all looks and no reliability
It's ridiculous how Asus has fallen.  There was once a point in time when people lauded Asus, and even I was considerimg their stuff heavily.  Hell, still am, as I'm hoping/ assuming/ observing they SEEM to take their workstation stuff more seriously, ala HP lol. Will stop that as it seems like Threadripper Next may actually be a bit more public facing.  No issues with my old Asrock X79 Profesional, and been really wanting to try a Gigabyte mobo lol.  Edit: I stand by their ProArt displays though. They better not F up there as that would be messing with a few industries as opposed to "just consumers." Even Apple couldn't get away with that BS
Ngl i love asus stuff and this is just so disappointing, i just bought a Duo 16 as well. Was thinking about getting their new portable too but this definitely makes it a pass.
I’ve always had good luck with ASUS in the past with both motherboards and gpus. I sincerely appreciate the heads up here. This is especially tough with EVGA leaving the gpu market (my personal favorite gpu maker).That said, this is enough for me to look elsewhere moving forward. Any recommendations on brands of boards and gpus? I’m considering a new build within the next year. I’m an intel/Nvidia guy only.
I have a system I just built a few weeks ago using an ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi with an intel 13600k, I have an issue where it wont recognize the onboard PCI bus. I have tried every driver Asus has and have even tried third party driver software to see what it can find as well as Asus's useless system check software and nothing fixes it. I tried to use their trouble shooting online but nothing made any differnce and they dont have a support email or phone number, I can only find messaging through their site which has hours that dont really work for me. I have used Asus for many builds for years now but something has changed and its not the same company making quality products it was 10 years ago. Sad.
I remember when ASUS was not only cheap, but very feature competitive for the dollar even at the flagship level. The last few years they've had a bit of a price creep, but on top of that, the various motherboard lineups seem to have made the ASUS brand seem a bit less-so than before. For example the ROG Boards just seem grossly overpriced, while ProArt ends up sporting a lot of the peripheral/IO needs, while TUF seems "cheap" and more cut down compared to other options...  The warranty thing is pretty unacceptable. Don't post software onto the website if it voids the warranty. Especially if the board doesn't have BIOS Flashback (oh yeah, that's another feature that has disappeared from the inexpensive boards). Make that sort of thing require a support ticket, so that if provided to a customer for testing, it's not only warrantied, but they can get the product back for failure analysis as part of the troubleshooting flow!  In the past I would put up with ASUS's software (AiSuite usually being garbage) only because their BIOS Interface has otherwise been solid. To this day their BIOS Interface is still pretty good in my opinion... but Armoury Crate and support for older boards running newer operating systems with said tools is just garbage. My board for example supports the 5800X3D and Windows 11, but the last update for AiSuite 3 was a few years ago, and it's so old that various Anti-cheat programs block the drivers for it due to vulnerabilities. Armory crate just doesn't provide the same controls, and I've had to move to open source software to get Windows Fan/System Monitoring support.  ASUS has a lot of work to do it seems, especially if they're going to charge $1,000 for a board... That's worse than Apple pricing at this point.
Well someone at Asus is getting fired today
I used to only buy Asus for my personal rigs/builds in general. Last mobo (x570) had 3 ram slots die in less than 8 months. I wont be buying from them again until a few generations pass and they prove themselves again. Sucks because they have the best Bios. MSI will do for now.
Please make a video on how to swap out a motherboard,.What you have to do on the hardware side, and software side. How to move your Windows key from the old motherboard to the new one.
Agreed. Asus, I've bought your boards literally my entire life (which is 5) and I'm also done with your bs. Join the bottom of the pile where you're welcome to anything that isn't my money. It's been good but I hope you pay dearly for this.
I had the unfortunate experience of trusting others opinions and got a prebuilt acer predator with the intention of upgrading a bit at a time (i know prebuilts usually have crap stuff they put in there to just get rid of it).  however, when i went to upgrade, i found out its all 'proprietary technology' and i would have to get acer parts to upgrade anything.  I had to have the 3060 ti replaced TWICE and now i get this burning smell coming from it (to varying degrees).   If I want to upgrade I would literally have to get EVERYTHING upgraded at once (basically get a whole new computer).  I will NEVER touch anything Asus again as I am now stuck with a potato board throttling my performance of the other parts (that will need to be replaced anyway).  Thanks ACER.  I hate you and you suck. Edit:  I am poor.  it took forever to save up enough just for this and now... yeah. Edit number 2: sigh... sorry it was acer not asus my mind got it mixed up with asus word being used so much in the video lol still sucks hard though beware acer they are con artists.
I get that you cut them from your AMD builds, but that is also your main complaint, the AMD side. Would be nice if you could describe the Intel boards from Asus, as Intel has always been more reliable. It honestly sounds like you are siding with AMD solutions because that is your flavor, and any company that dare not favor AMD solutions is out the door.
Worry their routers are next to go bad
Thank you for this video. I always had Asus mainboards in all of my systems.... with the next build I will finally make the change to another brand, maybe MSI. I always thought of them like _"well thats the best brand, mainboard is pretty important, lets go Asus",_ but I *always* had mainboard problems anyway, lol. fired 🔥🦿
hasn't that been decades ago that ASRock was the cheap company that one better avoided? in 2011 i built a pc with an asrock 970 extreme4 and that worked perfectly until i upgraded from a phenom II to a i5 6600k and bought an MSI board
On your personal build, check your Vdd IO voltage.
My asrock Steel Legend x670E with my 7800x3d is rock solid.
I've been waiting for you to respond.   Thank you Jay. Asus really doesn't care about their brand image nor their customers. Take responsibility.
Crap.  As hard as it has been for me, a soon to be new PC gamer about to buy his components, now I have to make sure to avoid ASUS and ALL related companies.  Sigh… seems as though I’ll never get the hang of this stuff…
So...Who do we get hardware from now? It seems like every board manufacturer has become a scumbag.
Your level of honesty and integrity is much needed in this space.
Video Idea for you.  Building a PC Using only "Private Companies".  No Publicly Traded Corporations ! I've Learned after a Decade in Finance that Every Publicly Traded Cooperation is Only Focused on Share Prices and Share Holders.
it takes 7 boards to get a good one from asus lmao  but in all serious ness i thought asus was second too evga who even is a good component manufacturer to go too anymore? for gpu's motherboards and other lol
I'm in a big issue with Asus at the moment they refused to honor the warranty on Thai exact issue.
I dont trust Asus cuz Bios I dont trust Gigabyte since PSUs blew up I dont trust ASRock because they are are ASRock I dont trust MSI because of personal RMA bs i had to go through I dont trust Aorus cuz they are Gigabyte I dont trust intel cuz no Innovation I dont trust AMD cuz AM5 I dont trust Nvidia cuz of 40series pricing  So What remains?
thank you so much for this video. I was adviced to go MSI for mobo around 20 years ago and are going for that again after watching this video. going for intel again aswell.  20 years since last build  for me 😳
I've been saying Asus puts out crap for years, Owned a small shop and the amount of failures I would see with Asus is a joke might as well buy a prebuild.
Asus would have a hard time with their current stance in Australia. Our consumer law operates with or without a warranty, so Asus can say it voids the warranty all they like. If they have suppiled a product that is not 'fit for purpose' (per the terminology used here), they will be legally obligated to repair, replace, or refund depending on the situation.
Glad i got asrock steel legend insted of an asus board
Very disappointing. Loved every product I've purchased from ASUS.😢
Fair enough! Hope they step up their game!
I've had nothing but problems with my ROG 6900 XT LC.  I've ended up reverting to a Vega 56 with an EK water block so I can play new games
Thank you for putting the audience first. Hopefully this will help them realise how this behaviour will destroy the brand.
Will you let gigabyte out on a conditional parole?
Is there any reputable corporation anywhere?
As far as your home PC.  I think a lot of people would like to see you to find a new X670 board to use. That way we all can see if it was Asus causing your issues.
Really sad to watch this video. ASUS is my brand of choice, has been for many years. I'm also looking at upgrading my pc in the next 12 months and if I hadn't watched this video and the Gamers Nexus video from 11 hours ago I would have automatically looked at ASUS as a priority. They've lost my money, but as you said at the end "they don't care", well I do, farewell ASUS, from a long time fan.
Support you bro, these companies that lose sight of their core purpose need to be told that it's not okay
I remember when I first started building a decade ago now (geez, I'm getting old) and the Asus Crosshair line was top of the line no compromise. There was nothing else like that unless you moved over to HEDT. Now everyone has motherboards for every price point and they all have quality stuff. Asus has become insulting to its customers even just on a personal level. Remember "game first, work second" line for one of their products/lines? Like, seriously, I'm an adult who likes to game in my spare time. I don't mind being called a gamer, but imagine bringing a date home with that in your office. Whole company is sitting on its laurels while the rest of the industry has caught up. /rant over.
I love this is all happening right at the same time the ally is being reviewed, real awful time to shit the bed.
I 2000% agree with you. My last 3 ZenBooks have shit the bed. I've had the last 3 models. From board issues, gpu, and screen issues. I was such a huge fan up until now. I am done.  P.S. I have an ASRock MOBO in my Sim Rig and it is ASRock Solid!
Hopefully more channels will pick up on this and give Asus a big slap in the face.
My Asus ROG Strix B650E-F Gaming WiFi does have an non beta BIOS fix that makes the VOC limit of 1.3. First I though there was only a beta version but I clicked on show all to get the non-beta.
ASUS is DISGUSTING and Garbage. Figured it long time ago, and stop buying their products. Never again.
correct decision. if a company is not going to get on top of its problems and blame customers for what is a problem with the product and management and executives then yeah, stop promoting them. they had the time to sort the problem. they are selling premium products but some are having quality issues and expecting the customer to pay for it. as Steve (GN) said, its like sport mode in a car but the engine overheats and explodes, what is the point in having that if it does that, why put it in there in the first place? big companies will only respond when they start losing money hand over fist, look at WotC (wizards of the coast) and the ogl thing, they took a big hit from people un subscribing and then the management changed there tune and let the ogl be available for everyone, saving all the companys that use it to promote the DND product that WofC sell.
Well done! Appreciate the honesty and your integrity to deliver this to the consumer. You are the voice and we hear you, hopefully ASUS have ears!
I stopped buying Asus years ago because of their horrible customer service and QC. Haven't missed them at all.
Well I picked the wrong brand of motherboard
Ive never been a huge asus fan. Every time i use it. I have weird issues.  MSI has been improving over the years.its my go to for pretty much anything. Like you say.. even Asrock stuff… really isnt that bad
Are x3d cpu's still ok with other brand boards? This hit at the wrong time for me while buying new hardware.
I agree. I built my last system on asus, ill go to msi
Also jay, since you dont have a contract with asus, show us the emails they sent you, they cannot sue you since you never had any nba to stick to
I have been using Intel Asus boards for many years with zero issues.  Your problem is AMD and lack of QC thanks to covid.
It's almost as if things are breaking down at a more rapid pace. Oh wait, it is.
Which sucks cause my rig uses a Rampage Extreme V and Asus 2080TI.  Both superior products. Now after watching this I'm very wary of today's ASUS
people need to clas action asuses asses they need a lawsuit to get their heads out of their asses ime done with asus for future products the dark hero will be the last board i buy from these morons
I also was shocked when i viewed the gn video.I rely on reviews from experts when i purchase computer parts and not the manufacturer advertising.Thank you for recording this and standing up for the common person who has to beg and borrow to buy these expensive components.
I guess bad customer service is like a virus and spreading all over. I had a terrible experience with OriginPC...so terrible I asked for a refund instead of an RMA and even with the refund they took almost 4 weeks because they made some mistakes processing the refund. To me ASUS and Origin PC are dead....I just hope the others learn from this experience.
Even back on the X79 platform I was having a lot of the same issues that persist today. Asus is trash.
Thank you for having such high integrity.
They're literally getting people to sabotage their machines and then laughing at them. This is worse than "anti-consumer" this is an outright evil practice. They know what they're doing.  Thanks for having the integrity to stand up, Jay. I've learned a lot from you over the years. I've built several PCs for my household and other family and friends since learning and you're legit one of the 3 dudes who showed me how and gave me the confidence to do it. Keep up the good work, sir.
They make nice looking stickers!
I don't know about all of this.  We all have issues with these companies.  I've been burned badly by Gigabyte with bad motherboards and Bios issues as well, and all the crap MSI did a few years back.  ASRock isn't what I would call high end quality....  So that leave me with ASUS which I still to this day have had zero problems with their products or their support.  There just isn't really one manufacture that is overall better than the rest.  What's next ZOTAC 😂
guess i'm avoiding asus then.
This is what happens when lawyers run your company.
well, and to top it off they charge so much more for this generation motherboards too,  and to provide this level of crappy service makes no sense.    I'm wondering how much of these troubles is due to resourcing parts during covid, and  if quality control in general went down because of the resourced parts.   I have an RMA story like others as well with ASUS.   X570-E board wouldn't boot,  had EVERYTHING else to relplace (RAM, CPU, PSU, GPU)   everything,  and it was the MB.   Sent it in, and they just sent it back,  same board,  said it was working just fine....  I got on them, and finally got a working replacement.  took way to long,  but fortunately I had another full system.   This generation, I've been holding off.     The much higher prices on GPU's MB's and RAM were enough to give me pause.
damn bought the bundle 7900X + Asus rog b650e-f, nothing happen for me yet since i got it 3 months ago but im scared, i may need to get a MSI or Asrock mobo
Bravo Jay. So glad to hear you say all of this.   Within the last 2 weeks I had a bad out the box Asus Thor 1200w and a X670E Hero die after 3 boots. I came to the exact same conclusion as you last week and now refuse to use Asus products anymore.(And I was a self admitted huge Asus fanboy before too)
Should have gone with Intel.
I'm  Asus  user man gotta say  that ant right  might have speak to Jay Jay
What a mix of good and bad press today for ASUS. I'm actually glad some of you are speaking out about this, especially on a day when so many others are simply promoting the new ROG Ally from them.
Me who just got a good deal on a pair of ASUS monitors, worried.gif
Gigabyte prolly swooping in to sponsor him rn
Asus has been the worst company BY FAR to deal with when I have to do a claim about warranties. Haven't bought from them for years and I am TRYING to persuade a friend who does buy from them, and his last 3 troubled RMAs (all in motherboards) have been ASUS).
Good on you for no longer partnering with them, I'll quote what I also posted on GN's comments, because it's apt (especially since you're talking about consumer confidence):  This whole fiasco is disappointing on so many levels. Building my current PC I prioritized not getting MSI products (because of their shit behavior) and went all ROG because I've had nothing but good experiences with them, but I'm guessing I'm going (whenever I build my next PC, which'll be a minute) to be shitlisting ASUS as well. Which is disappointing, since my Sabertooth X58 lasted for a decade and I've been nothing but satisfied with my Rog Maximus XII Extreme. Hopefully by the time I'm in the market for a new mobo, ASUS will have unfucked themselves and I can feel secure buying their products.
But baxk my x670
I've always used ASUS boards since Pentium 2. The only time I didn't use ASUS, was when Athlon 64 come out, I went with DFI. Then when Core 2 Duo came out, went back to ASUS. Last ASUS board I used was Prime X470 Pro with my Ryzen 5 2600x. I always had wonky BIOS issues with it. Back in July 2022, I decided to upgrade to Ryzen 9 5900x *got this for $280 new*, and MSI MEG Max Ace X570S. Only issue I had was out of the box, it didn't like my G.Skill Trident Neo 32GB 3200MHz CL14. But I flashed the BIOS and now it works flawlessly running at 3600MHz CL14. When I brother wanted me to build him a PC back Dec 2021, he wanted a ASUS board. Told him to go with the MSI Tomahawk X570. Both my MSI and my brother's MSI board have been rock solid with zero issues.
Just got my Asus Zephyrus G14 back from it's second RMA, finally fixed.
My Asus x570, b550 and 4080 tuf have been solid no issues. I had really bad luck with gigabyte b450 where the board died after 2 months , rma d the board said faulty bios chip worked for a day and died again and their software is much more worse then Asus.
I'm fighting with Asus RMA for past three months. I bought thier the best laptop and it has multiple issues like WiFi/Bluetooth card issues, poor assembly quality and backlight bleeding. They say that they do not see issue...
That’s why I move to AsRock motherboards.
I can't believe this is happening! I literally put my Pre-order in for the  ASUS ROG Ally and then see that ASUS can't be trusted to back their hardware, software, and or warranty? Bro! Really? I canceled my pre-order! After watching videos about it all day I will do what I knew I should have done which is wait for the product to fully release and see if and or how well they support it and help users conduct fixes on the handheld if needed for example thumb sticks break! I got so hyped from Linus' video on the Ally but I clearly need to wait and see if this product will actually be any good or if Asus will push It to the waist side for users to work through issues themselves. Hopefully, they get their act together because I wanted that product... But will they pull something like this on that product if something goes wrong?
I hope that no one buys Asus anymore and hope they go bankrupt that is all they deserve
In b4 ASUS pulls an AMD.  EDIT: Also in relation to the Mega Man build, it would be funny if you used something resembling lemons for the buster shots because many Mega Man fans lovingly call the small shots "lemons" as from the 16 bit editions on thats exactly what they resemble. Lemons.
Is it the BIOS that's unsupported or does your entire motherboard warranty become void? Because the wording doesn't seem like the warranty of your board is voided to me, just that the BIOS itself is only provided "as-is" (which is dumb, stand by your work ASUS).
my 2022 G14 ($2,000) STILL doesn't have official USB4 support 15 months after launch..... it was HEAVILY marketed by asus via Reviewers!
I’ve always been a msi guy, I know their customer service sucks but I’ve never had to use it lol.
5:35 apple has a recall page and they have a program up from 15 years ago. I don’t know if they’ll still honor it, but I did one of those from 5 years apart from when I bought it and they sent the replacement.
I haven't paid the Asus tax since x79.  Been running ASRock boards and haven't looked back
I bought my hardware the first day for Asus strip rtx 4090, Asus e670 extreme crosshair with the 7950x cpu. Been too afraid to finish the build. Plan on getting an ASRock m/b  thank you Jay
If you have an asus 12th gen boards you want to unload, I'm happy to help ya out . Lol
"When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."
All I can say im glad I went with an ASRock x670E Pro RS ..it's been solid and have had multiple 7000 series CPU's in it including a 7900X3D and all of them have been solid and handled overclocking and EXPO without issues.
i gave up on ASUS a long time ago.. in Europe they are allways overpriced and for me there are better choices in other brands
Im not a huge pc build enthusiest I've only built a couple computers over the years, my last computer i put in an asus motherboard and it just completely died suddenly one day with no warning. It was then I learned asus mobo's have a signifigant failure rate and not to be trusted. Switched to ASrock for the replacement board and for my current rig and no issues for many years.
How are the Gigabyte boards for 7000 series?
I think for Asus to get the message all the techtubers needs to band together and drop them not just Jay tho
I have totally opposite opinions about asus. I think it's just bad luck with you. Negative energy. I hope at least as I'm just about to build a full asus pc
Lol must be nice getting thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of computers for free. Here I am a disabled veteran unable to even afford the cheapest pos laptop because my body is so broken the act of walking is a miracle  to me. Must be so hard getting so much free stuff that you get to build computers without dishing out a penny. If you have so many parts just sitting g around help me a disabled veteran out. But we all know no one gives a damn about the men and women that keep this country free.
Man on my wife's PC I got her a 7900x and an Asus Strix board. It's flakey AF. It's like it memory trains every boot up
I had usb dropout issues with ryzen 5000 and an asus motherboard, took them literal YEARS to come out with a bios that fixed it. Really lowered my confidence in them
Wonder how the Rog Ally will sell based on this horrible customer service. I was really gonna pull the trigger and get one but not now.
Had a 2060 ROG Strix with a bad fan. RMA'd it. Got a crappy 2070 dual mini with the wrong heatsink (hitting a choke and not making contact with the core die properly, causing overheating). I complained in the survey since they had already closed my RMA, so they cross-shipped (advance replacement with a hold on my credit card) a second 2070 dual mini with a dead fan as the replacement. I swapped the working fans onto the card with the correct heatsink (that didn't fully contact all the video memory, but at least the core isn't hitting 80c now). They also billed me for not returning the card I shipped back to them using the return label they provided. It took several weeks to get my money back when they finally found the missing card in their receiving warehouse or something stupid like that. I was hoping it was just the support that sucked, and as long as you didn't need to RMA anything you would be fine, but now this tells me the whole company is in the toilet. I guess I'm looking for new brands for my next build too.  RIP EVGA, you will be missed on the GPU front. Had done several RMAs, including an advance replacement on a 3080ti that killed itself after a month, and they were all smooth as long as I had my receipt ready to go to submit the initial ticket requesting an RMA and had already done my detailed troubleshooting to determine the component at fault.
Thank you for taking a principled stand. I’m sure it was an incredibly tough call, but it shows you value your integrity.
Lots of respect from our end, Jay! Thanks for standing up for the community, and being a great Tech Tuber!
Some one tell em about the MSi firmware keys lmao
Thank you for this video and the support! I just built my first PC a couple weeks ago with a strix x670e-e and 7800x3d and am EXTREMELY frustrated by what has transpired with Asus. Literally the first night I fired up my system, I saw the first report of this issue and it's only gotten worse from there. Knowing what I know now, I obviously wouldn't have bought an Asus motherboard and probably would have gone the Intel route as well, but I'm committed at this point, unfortunately.   I'm going to be patient for a few weeks and hope that Asus gets a solid bios released. I don't even want to think about what my next step will be IF that doesn't happen which will involve trying to get a refund for the board and maybe the 7800x3d and ram as well.......uhhhhhhgg! I hope it doesn't come to that as I really don't want to deal with that AND tear down and rebuild this computer which I'm thrilled with otherwise. This sucks. :(
Love it, thanks Jay!
Yeah I have an ASUS M16 2021 version with a 3060. It’s been a solid laptop, travelled, worked and gamed on heavily throughout Covid.  It’s seen better days. I got a cracked key. My warranty had just expired a month prior. Their support referred me to a 3rd party seller for a SINGLE KEY!  The third party did NOT sell single keys, wanted me to buy a new keyboard for $150.  Been making due with a cracked “S” key for over a year now. No other problems but I’ve decided next year to avoid ASUS for anything related to laptops or even a potential PC build.  This video only solidifies my decision.  Thanks Jay and keep gaming gamers!
I think it's high time people start understanding that this is simply business. There's no such thing as a pro-consumer business. They aren't your friends, they don't care about you. All they want is a profit and your money. The reality is that people will forget about this and continue buying it, and you're just shooting yourself in the foot by playing the hero for the little guy in the moment.
I think you're looking the horse in the mouth. Complaining about sponsorships from a multil billion tech company will never get you anywhere, especially with the barrage of negative heresy.  On the other hand, since you'll most likely be dropped for being ungrateful, it doesn't look like your channel has much room to go with (unamed) receiving sponsorship after sponsorship, including exclusive ASUS products. However, I get what it's like being frustrated with a product if you are paying, however at the end of the day you are just a content creator. You are not an electronic engineer, you do not work in silicon fab, you have no experience in electrical engineering. You are a hobbyist, at most.  Technical and mechanical failures happen all the time. It's not to late to delete this and try to salvage your brand deal. Hell, the boys at the Beitou office are in and would most likely pick up the phone.  Jay, its okay to be upset.  However, its not okay to be ungrateful about product you are given and then stress test beyond the average consumer's scope of use. Stuff like that and claims of misuse are what will end you up in trouble with the legal side of things.  Anyway, hope you can find a better product since they are all made in the same 6 factories from the same two silicon refineries.  Best of luck to ya.  -Taiwan
This whole asus thing is what made decide on getting a steam deck instead of the new rog ally, I don't trust them as a brand anymore
Man... I have an Asus EN9400GT 1GB board sitting right at the left of me, it used to be father's. I collect old Asus original boxes and modern Asus RoG Strix ones cause I used to love Asus. Remember that time when they had black n' red RoG logo and stuff? Yeah, I used to be a fan back then. My main rig still has an Asus board and Asus card in it. I've been noticing more and more that Asus's hardware has started having more issues than ever, and now this. Sad.  I really appreciate you being the voice of the community today. And you're right about ASRock and other brands, like Palit etc. There's a lot of ASRock and Palit hardware in my country. I've seen stuff fail. But man, these smaller brands that people just dislike have been nothing but perfect. I build PCs for a living and if I just go by statistics from my own experience, Asus has given me the most problems, at least when it comes to motherboards, might not be true for other products. I wanna have old Asus back.
Well said Jay hopefully a whole lot more will follow and do the same, I have a x670e hero board and i'm scared to use it now, it will most likely go to ebay and i will jump to another brand.
Cleary wrong people are at the helm and  top brass of Asus needs to be replaced. Need someone like Pat Gelsinger or Lisa Su equivalent to steer Asus towards the right  direction  who has a keen vision for the future but also strives to earn back community  trust.
Pretty extreme stance Jay, hope you don't wind up regretting this!
Yep. That is why I buy Gigabyte now. My last Asus I bult the mother board went bad. Bought the Asus 42 oled and it went bad after having 2 of them now I bought the KTC oled and happy with that. Never Asus again. Using Gigabyte boards last 12 years.
Hot take. Inside job. Employees are doing these things on purpose to sabotage these companies.
Ohh boy... This is very surprising for me, and woaw... I have watched this and think this is very serious for all consumers... I myself use a ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Hero (Wi-Fi) motherboard (AM4 socket) and have only had one little problem... Using 4 G.Skill TridentZ Neo DDR4-3200 32GB ram sticks,  and a few times where the hole system froze when using 128GB ram... Using only 64GB it is just rock solid until now... I can not figure it out why, but hey i am not as experienced as you are... But i want to thank you for your great work in trying different things and teaching us, not so experienced people out here, a few things... Please continue in my hubble opinion... BIG FAN of this teaching us different things...
I really love Asus as a brand and I always recommended them to customers at Best Buy, but nah. No more
I'm upgrading my platform in a couple weeks and was planning on going with Asus because I love the TUF series but, seriously thinking about going MSI or AsRock because of all of this and also the Aura sync software is trash
I gave up on Asus a while ago. As rock is my go to now.
thank you jay!  who do we choose then?  all i use in asus, but now i dont want to lol.
That's very unfortunate....I wish I had learned this 2 weeks ago. I had a gigabyte MB and vanilla 7950x fail. I don't know which caused which but they're both cooked. So I RMA the cpu and bought a new ASUS board...😢😢😢
Your videos are so important to us Jay and I'm glad you are calling them out. They only care about fancy packaging and logo's and grabbing your hard owned cash with no support. respect
i allways like msi
Jay are you looking into the Icue 5.1 ram issues?
Gawd. DAMN! Thanks for standing up for the consumers Jay!
The failures of AMD related products will echo throughout eternity. Every organization that has "stability" as a core requirement, uses Intel. But, everyone here knows that, so, meh...
Fuck I got a asus tuf plus Wi-Fi x570 board and it’s been solid for 3 years …guess next build gonna be something else
Dont actively like many, if any, YTers but today you earned that as well as my respect. I get it may not mean much in the scheme of things but just wanted to say it.
After your audio issues I am starting to think there maybe issues with the 570E as well as I get similar situations with my system
Just days ago bought a Tuf Gaming B550-Plus WIFI II, bad luck for me :(
time to find another favorite Brand 😅 any recommendations ?
I can smell a very expensive lawsuit coming to asus for this bios scummy move
Crazy. I have an asus b550m plus, asus 3060, asus monitor, asus laptop and asus keyboard/ mouse set up. And it's all junk now
Man I've been a big fan of Asus for years. They've always made quality products up until these past few releases. I have a 5950X with a Asus Crosshair VIII Dark Hero that's been very stable. Hopefully they can get their shi-"stuff" worked out.
Asus screwed me over 3 years ago with a laptop ... I will never ever get an Asus product again .... they are scumbags through and trough
Yea i went with MSI in the last 3 builds carbon,tomahawk,edge...
Thank you for staying loyal to the fans !!!!    I have always followed your recommendations and will continue to do so.   I have been a ASUS fanboy for years. My 2022nbuild was all ASUS.   I hate it when companies forget what's important and how they handle the problems.  (Budlight)   Keep up the great work Jay and team.  We will always have your back.
good job Jay and Co. thanks for looking out for the little guy.
If you have been around long enough, it was surprising when Jay started working with them.  Kudos to him for holding his integrity of his company over the easy money grab.
So basically Jay is mad because he's not getting new free product in the color he wants.😂 He said it himself, that was the straw, not the ocp.
How refreshing to hear/see someone calling it out as it is; no mealy-mouthed weasel words, no political pussy-footing, no corporate-talk euphemisms. Thanks for this @JayzTwoCents - your own credibility has just taken a *huge* jump because we *know* and *trust* that you're not afraid to call things out.  So, that's crossed ASUS off my list of potential mobo replacement brands.  Will now have to look further into suitable products from MSI, ASRock, EVGA and Gigabyte.
Jay, stop it. My wife is jealous of my crush on your integrity.
hell yes, loved this...power to the enthusiasts ✊
kinda happy im done with pc's now for gaming  consoles all way..  im done with this overpriced fucking gimmick   and im a qualified game dev.
Time to return the laptop and cancel ally
Im surprised ASUS quality has gone down so much because their boards are not made in America.. I can honestly say American's are the worst workers on the planet. We've lost most of our jobs in large part because we're the most expensive in the world to employ and you get the least out of us. Bunch of crybabies
I had memory issues as well on my Asus X-670E TUF with a 7900x. After much troubleshooting, the FIX was loosening the CPU waterblock mounting screws 1 turn each! Rock solid stability now. Go figure...🤦‍♂
I absolutely love Asus Motherboards. I hope they figure this out and get the issues fixed.
Surprised by this I have an Asus z490 for years with no issues as well as a z370 prime still running good in a friends pc after more than 5 years.  After the latest ASUS controversy, MSI's past, ASRock being bad overall and running CPUs to 115, GIGABYTE having garbage RMA process what are you guys buying LOL
Let's keep this one going, we have numbers over Asus.
I have been noticing this happening to large companies across the board. I don't know if it is the diversity hire quotas or just hiring under qualified people because they are cheaper, but quality across almost every brand and company I used to trust is going down hill. Over the past year I have had to RMA more things than I have ever had to before in my life.
Was confirmed to get an Asus ROG white motherboard for my build until I saw this. At first is was very skeptical about going Asus because my current board is is a B450 Tuf with a 5800x and it blue screens. Now I know and we all know Asus is shit. Thanks Jay, saved me an expensive mistake that I would've made again, upgrading solely because my current build has problems.
I have an X570-I that if I change anything in bios at all, if I shut down I lose the nvme. Hard reset cmos, nvme magically shows up. Can shutdown and no issues. Asus support claimed it was the nvme.
Stick with AMD and use the Asrock (I've had a great experience with mine) or go with Gigabyte or MSI.
I was looking forward the the ASUS Ally but when I saw Steve’s video … I canceled my preorder.
Just curious but is this just AM5 board's suffering this or AM4 as well ?
After EVGA stopped doing gpu's I moved to MSI for gpu's, and now, I have an Asus motherboard, guess what? my next upgrade will be all MSI at this point
Way to go. I have watched you for quite awhile now. And you have commented on ASUS before for have issues. I watched Steve's vid. What a mess. But kudo's to you as well for taking a stand. Just keep being honest. That's all I want. My current build is working outstanding. I have you to thank for that.
guuuuuuuurl
Thank You for Standing Up and Kicking ASUS in their AS_s. Companies need to realize that consumers will not put up with their crap no matter how much PR spin they want to throw at you and pointless Lawyer Letters and legal cases because of them not producing a Decent Quality product. I hope more youtube channels follow your lead and as many Influencers as possible because the only way these companies feel anything is when their profits and sales decline drastically. ASUS was once King, Now The KING is DEAD.
Ending a sponsorship, especially one as large as Asus, is a pretty big deal.  Do what u gotta do.
I just dropped 750.00 on the Ally, what are the chances that the handheld starts showing glitches after throttling,  etc, etc?  Do you think the boards in the handheld could end up facing similar issues? Im absolutely crushed over this whole situation as i was in the midst of buying the gaming laptop of my dreams from asus but have now decided to go with MSI.   I can only hope you get this and respond. What a real knife to the heart. I have loved the ROG brand and the mobile aspect has been kick ass but to discover its all total horsesh@t, wow!
Bad timing for them with the ROG Ally release
Sad to hear that ASUS has gone into the toilet. I have a few of their older MB's and never had a problem. Also LOVE their monitors.
I’ve been extremely disappointed recently with my Strix X670E-E.  With the very first “supported” BIOS that “supported” the X3D chips, I wasn’t able to get my old CPU and RAM to work in EXPO.  I asked for support in the FB Group run by one of their own folks, and they were already on the “well that’s overclocking and it’s not a major issue, must be you, by the way, it’s not supported because overclocking.”  Now the talking and warnings about overclocking are only louder with all this.  Sad, now I have no confidence in anything they put out, hardware or software/BIOS.
Asus is a.... Sus company from now. Fire the CEO immediately.
Heh, ASRockChads.......we're getting the last laugh.
The bleep over audio inserts had me laughing!  hilarious. “stuff”
I always favor MSI for motherboard, they served me very well. The only thing that put me off is that cringe dragon logo. Man they need to update that, pronto!
i really appreciate you for doing this! i'm glad that you've always been on our side as consumers and have our back. thank you so much!
It's a shame. I was rocking a TUF p67 motherboard for 10 years without any problems. I run a x570 Crosshair VIII Hero, again, without any issues. When I upgrade next in a few years, I might no longer go to ASUS anymore. FYI, isn't ASrock a sub brand of ASUS?
I mean, Asus is flailing apparently,  but you should go Megaman X for the build theme. Get a Zero figure to accompany Megaman. That would be amazing in that build.
I feel so screwed for buying Asus mobo.
It honestly feels like all of the new ASUS AM5 socket MOBO's were rushed to get to consumers and severely overlooked  for quality and performance! I built an all ASUS B550 w/5600xt/6900xt and it has been so good that I have no reason to upgrade any time soon. I love ASUS for the reason of having solid products but this is really getting crazy!
My last few builds have used AsRock and MSI boards, been totally happy with them both. Haven't used ASUS for years since I went through 3 boards back in Sandy Bridge build.
Thats funny i just bought a d4 board
Hi friends, I watched the whole video but do have a question. Is this a problem with just Asus mobos or is it the whole brand now? In time to come ill build another pc, as we all do, and i wanna make sure if its sooner rather than later, I go with a proper brand. If the whole brand is going to the dogs, whats a next good stable brand to go with? Asrock is one as mentioned by Jay. Anything else?
So uh....you gonna send all that crap back to them....right? Or if they get shitty just have a livestream of it all going through a shedder...
Less choices now.  No more EVGA.  No more Asus.
So ASRock or MSI I'm an Asus guy myself. Great vid mad respect. I have loved Asus for years and I'm 100% with you Jay.
This is why I didn't jump right in on the next gen pc stuff. lol I'll continue to support the company :)
I'm done with Asus as well... (Nvidia too) Stand up n say F**k em!
Still rocking my 990FX Sabertooth from over a decade ago and was planning on doing a full update. I greatly appreciate Jay putting quality over quantity and preventing me from making a huge mistake going back to ASUS.
The thing about Asus’ position with the BIOS and XMP and Overclocking is that it is the industry standard. CPUs, Morherboards AND RAM. I think also GPUs. You need to hold all of them accountable for their warranty BS. Don’t do any overclocking when doing benchmarks. As companies change their standard warranty to include features they advertise you can include those results.
Sounds about like my experience with NZXT, they give zero F about their customers.
Do you know 60 FPS?
The whole " if you use our product, you void the warranty" bit is a huge PR disaster.
I have a b650e aorus master on my 7950x3d and I’ve had zero problems. Have my ram at 6200mhz tuned and it’s been great. I will miss evga they had some of the best support I haven’t tried gigabyte but you never hear good things out of any of the current brands when somethings breaks. Also just preordered an asus ally I know this video is about asus and how they have went downhill but i have to say the ally looks pretty cool.
man ASUS has fallen hard
I only use Asrock products nowadays. I'm not looking at asthetics. I have a black case , no window , and i dont care what people think it looks like.
Try the Gigabyte Aorus Master, I love this thing.
ASUS took decades to build it's brand and destroyed it with swiftness! It will be a long time before ASUS regains the trust of consumers, if ever.
ok if you don't like your Asus  send some of it to me so I can build a computer lol
"Because of the arrogance," you nailed right there. There is the actual problem with Asus. They think they are the best and they only one in the market. Congrats for your decision in joking the community and not a brand.
All they need to do is say "sorry" and issue some discount coupons.  People will forget all about it.  Don't you remember the MSI laptop review debacle?   What about Nvidia banning HUB?   AMD banning Gamer's Nexus?   Asus is just the scumbag flavor of the week.
Thanks for looking out for us, Jay! Asus: I was about to build with you on your platform, switching to your competitors. Just hearing about your lack of customer service (I work in that industry) put me off. Asus, I have bought your products for a long time and I hope your change your attitude towards your consumers.
I've experienced the same type of issues and half arsed support from Asus with my x570 I bought and ended up just dealing with the issues in the end because they were so painful to deal with.
I remember when ASUS used to be the kit you would buy because you knew it was decent.  Regarding the warranty issues and offering out fixes that will void your warranty, I doubt they will get very far in the EU with these sort of games, which will mean that retailers in the EU will be held liable and will then stop stocking their kit because they don't want to be liable.  Also, I can see a lot of claims being done via Credit Card Chargebacks which will cause them even more problems.
Proud of you Jay. Excellent work my friend!
Asus has always been a turd wrapped in pretty tin foil I remember I had an asus x551m it had bought a new 65w power brick to replace the junk stock one I ordered the 65w power brick from asus and I loved it when I RMA’d the laptop and got it back they gave me the stock power adapter and threw out the one I paid for fuck you asus I’ve been happy with my MSI x570 gaming plus board it’s been solid for years and I love it
¡Bravo Jay!
I regret going with an ASUS board on my 13600k build.... I am also getting those annoying ass USB disconnects
Sounds like asus has focused too much on looking cool and brand recognition rather than product performance.
NOOOOOOOOOOO
I’ve been saying asus has gone down hill for a very long time. I had two separate boards and nothing but ram stability issues. The old board (b650) stopped turning on completely after the 5th cmos reset and bios upgrade. The second board did not support my ram(blue screened), until bios update, then it would take forever to boot and bluescreened 50% of the time I turned it on. And bluescreened during operation. 5 cmos resets later, I had it working for 1 day, then bluescreen the day after, did I mention no wifi drivers for some reason and took 1 day of troubleshooting to get  the wifi working?  I went msi. NIGHT AND DAY difference. With msi I still have an issue with memory training, it takes 1 min to boot from off with memory overclock.
im so happy this is happening , asus screwed me on a rma , they are f'in thieves.
i have a asus b660m -A D4 lga 1700 should i change my motherboard to a different brand or no?
I realized this about Asus back in 2021. My Asus 1080Ti's VRAM died, and since it was on its 4th year, it was just out of warranty. I requested a quote for a fix/replacement, and was quoted $910 for a replacement. I paid $770 for the card at the time.... I got lucky with an EVGA 3060Ti during the pandemic on Newegg Shuffle for $540. Will never go back to Asus again, especially with this stuff happening to Ryzen builds, which I also run.
I have a Asus x399-a Prime and it seems like they pulled it from there site, so i cant even update any of the drivers for it anymore... its not even that old and they seem to have yeeted support
JJ should start abandoning the shop, the ship is going down.
I bought a asus rog phone 5s pro and in a couple months the screen just started flickering while i was using it blacked out and then would not light back up, I sent it back for an RMA which was a nightmare at every step. They received my phone and for two weeks they told me they never received after showing it was delivered by the carrier.  The accused me of  shipping  it to an incorrect address. I read the correct one back to them that was from their own RMA office. They finally "found it"  and tell me it was never lost, then tell me the screen was cracked. It was not before I shipped it and they sent me a picture of a massive crack that somehow myself and two others did not see. They refused responsibility for breaking it and tried to pawn it off on Fedex...no one wanted to take any type of responsibility anywhere. I had to pay for a repaired screen and didn't even get my actual phone back they sent me another phone instead I had a small abrasion on the side of the phone which wasn't there so i know it was a different phone.  They forced me to pay to fix a couple month old phone failed and that they cracked the screen.  As a parting slap in the face they didn't even have the decency to put in my correct address when shipping it back to me. I have additional issues with Fedex service, but it was because of their failures I was able to find out Asus screwed up again before some random person said hey...free phone! I used to appreciate their products...but I don't care if its a solid product because their customer and rma service is so nightmareish, its just not worth risking every dealing with them ever again, I am done.    Thank you for speaking up about their unacceptable products non consumer-friendly actions  and taking a stand to say this is not ok and we should not accept it.
Kudos Jay, tell Asushit where to go. My money won’t be going there. I’ll be buying your merch instead.  Much respect given.
It's crazy how the quality of Asus has crumbled lately... When I see that my original Rampage 2 Extreme that I bought 12 years ago is still rock solid and overclocking the crap out of an i7 980x... And I see I already have a dead x570 strix board in my closet, but my Asrock board has been rock solid on my AMD system.... BTW, I have always noticed that Asus never really supported their products for very long, and always wondered why.... They've gotten so cocky and now they're gonna lose what they have worked really hard to achieve in the past.....
Bravo.
ROG fanbois are FULLY to blame for emboldening ASUS.
Asus quality has gone to hell, while the prices of their products have gone sky high. And don't get me started on their AI Suite and Crate software, because it's total garbage and has been for the last 4 or 5 years, and they've done nothing to correct it.
I'd have to double check, but I'm pretty sure that bios voiding warranty crap is illegal in Australia.
I find it amusing that somewhere in Taiwan there’s a team that has worked their asses off to make the ally just for some stupid managers to f up customer service, confidence and their credibility. I’m really sorry for them.
Love it Jay.
When Asrock, a middle of the road MOBO is better than yours. It really is time to not buy Asus boards.
Report them to Bureau of Consumer Protection. Ever since I started to watch Buildzoid value review motherboards, he always points out how ASUS and Gigabyte just massively fail with their parts and asking price. My last rig will be my last with ASUS parts if they don't course correct. Here's hoping EVGA gets back into improving their motherboards
Asus hasn't had a stable enthusiast board since Skylake x launched. You can meme and for the memory stability problems all you want but imo at the end of the day if the partners aren't following spec or finding/sharing problems with the spec than no amount of work and puts in will help
Y’all, please like this video and comment.
All this time you kept saying ASUS, when it turns out it was actually A - SUS.
Doesn't NZXT have a nice white AM5 motherboard?  I never hear NZXT mentioned on the channel unless it's a case. Something wrong with their motherboards I should know about?
Its good to see that you and steve over at GN are among the few that remain dedicated to the consumers rather than shilling for companies.
As expected from a Chinese company, it is better to support an American company like EVGA
There company is now All look no power
HELLO ALL MSI RIG?
Damn. They were my go to for a long time.  Glad my current build is all older parts.   Will see what the landscape is when It's time to update.  On principle - I wouldn't do business with a company that would small print *voids warranty* on a defective and potentially dangerous gear.
Kind of regretting buying a tuf 4080 now even though I did get a good deal via work, makes me wonder if I may encounter issues with it beyond the random coil whine
Great video, Jay.  I've been having strange issues with Armory Crate updating stuff and causing issues.  My next build will be with MSI.
I'm so glad I went with intel/MSI for my latest build, other than a few driver issues that have been easily fixed I have had no major gripes. I'll take a stable power-hungry setup over CPU killing unstable setups any day. thanks, Jay, for keeping it real with the community, much respect!
I bought a bad power supply and because take 40 days to get my RTX 4099 my warranty of 30 days past now I have to a rebuild power supply that I pay over 700 us
our national laws goes over this so doesn't matter to me, but if you live somewhere like USA with weak and near nonexistent consumer rights, I can see this being a real problem yeah
@jay... what about Gigabyte, AsRock and MSI who are NO BETTER THAN ASUS... and even said by Steve... so you should have no issue repeating it. come on...
Stories like these make me so happy to still be rocking on with my AM4 5900X, and 5800X machines which have been trouble free from day 1 for me. I am Getting ready to upgrade but its from 5800X to 5800X3D not to next gen and way happy with the 5900X I do my editing with
I’ve hated them for YEARS !!!
I hope every single techie stops using ASUS and announces it. maybe then they will react.
After dealing with ASUS support and SCUMMY RMA process with TRX40-PRO-S , only getting it resolved by a $40 card from amazon. I AM DONE WITH ASUS! and with GIGABYTE both brands are SHIT and both brands support wise is utter trash!  ASUS can kick rocks now.. NEVER WILL I SPEND ANOTHER DIME on that company products , I went to MSI Tomahawk and it IS SO STABLE and WORKS so well.. I dont need ASUS!  and it was a sub $300 board.
ASUS used to be the "king of motherboards" back in the GTX 500 Series days. Now, it is the company that everyone should steer clear of.
I'm in the process of building a new PC and had planned on using an ASUS board for an i9-13900K, I have everything but the board and CPU, what brand should I turn to next for a high end robust motherboard?
i am with you. ASUS took forever to get the win 11 bios fix for my board when on my gigabyte board was ready in 1 month. I also hate ASRock for not releasing the Bios fix for my A300 mini. Thay also lied to the BBB that they would give me a bios update if requested. Request ignored. I will never buy them ever again.
Just finished Steve's video then watched this... you gents are so great.  I'm glad to have you two on YouTube!!
Went with intel this generation just because I could get an EVGA motherboard. So tired of Asus and all the bloat as well as other issues.
Finally went back to asus for x570 after having bad experiences with b450. I haven't had issues with the x570 granted it was a crosshair formula not a low end board. But after this crap my next board whenever I modernize will not be an asus board
Integrity is everything.. You never fall short. Thanks Jay!
Also the game audio cutting out is something I'm facing on a x570 Dark Hero right now. Every time a new round starts I have to open Sonic Studio and click a drop down box to get the audio to come back. Every. Time.   I will never ever touch another ASUS board. This one was supposed to be bomb proof. Yet the state of the drivers is laughable. And this late in the game for this board...
My go to brand has finally crashed out. Sad.
When I got my AM5 setup I went with an asus tuf gaming as my AM4 board was great.  Picked up a Founder’s 4090 and it would not run on asus. No bios updates fixed it. After a month I found myself on the asrock site and saw that they had multiple 4090 bios updates.  Ordered an asrock and it’s been solid.
That's a shame. I used to only buy Asus motherboards. For the past 2 or 3 builds I had Asus, but this latest build I'm using ASRock.
LTX 23 is sponsored by Asus. I wonder if LMG will drop them last minute. I doubt it.
I’m on team steve and jay, won’t be buying any asus products until they make it right
This sucks cuz I basically have an all asus gaming set up 😂. Like come on. Take accountability for ur bs asus!
The first PCIe Slot on my "Dark Hero" just randomly broke in half a few months ago. Understandable as a GPU holder supported 6700 XT is quite challenging to be lifted. Ass the Fsus support told me to git gud and stop trying I decided to sort of fix it myself. Now it works again with the introduction of a permanently attached vertical mount and all it took is only as little as almost the entire resale value. Also base settings are horrible and fan control is even worse. Seeing my CPU Idle at 1,6V isn't really something I wished for, not even for a quick test of the stock performance for later comparison. Wonder how many CPUs they assassinated last gen. Certainly not a new Fsus problem. Did I already mention Armoury Crate?
So what MOBO manufacturer is the best?
😮
Respect.
My current rig I built a little over two years ago about 2-3 weeks before the chip shortage: Asus prime z490 p motherboard, I9 10850k, rtx 3070, 32gb ddr4-3200, 700w PSU, 1tb ssd, and a 2tb hard drive. I love this build! I built it with a plan to not need an upgrade for at least 3-5 more years.  With the issues facing newer generations, I've grown to understand that newer isn't always better. With the prices of everything these days, building a moderate to high end system can be out of reach for many people. That said, some may not be able to drop $700 or more on a very high end motherboard or on the latest CPUs/GPUs.   This leaves customers stuck between a rock and a hard place because you shouldn't go too cheap on PC components like power supplies. Cheaper components often skip out on quality and performance. They function great at first but fail after a short time. When they fail, they tend to kill  components connected to them as well like CPUs and GPUs. Ultimately costing much more than you expected to replace.
Massive respect for you dropping Asus and Steve for the investigation work. You guys are fantastic
Thank you for doing this, Jay! I was concerned the GN video wasn’t getting enough traction because of the Zelda reviews and ironically the Asus Ally.
I too have had problems with ASUS products over the past 5 years or so. Shame on them.
Jay please stop saying it a "X3D" problem.  This is happening to ALL 7000 series CPUs. Der8auer did a post mortem on a 7900X weeks before this story started blowing up on the Web.  It looks bad when you keep saying the Problem is with X when it is actually with Y.  Also while I do not wish to excuse the bad behavior of ASUS here I would just like to point out that you are abandoning a company that is at least warranting their product and trying to fix their issues.  When Gigabyte had issues with their GPU they just took down their warranty page until streamers started complaining about it and MSI has been caught many times hiding their problems and paying reviewers to either lie about a product or to not air the review.  Lastly I would like to point out that even through many of us have finally gotten our lives back to normal from the pandemic, many supply lines and products are still fubar'ed.  I work in IT and I am currently dealing with a Vendor that is on Hardware revision L of a product that still has the same fatal flaw in it that I found in hardware rev C.  The company I work for has been working with the manufacture to get this issue resolved but they can't seem to do it.
Thanks for the heads-up Jay. My last 2 builds had an ASUS MoBo.. the Sabertooth for my FX build back in 2014, and the Crosshair Extreme X570 AM4 build at the end of 2021 when that MoBo first released.  It'll be a few years before I even think about a new build, and after this, ASUS will not be an automatic first choice.
my luck just bought a z690 strix my tuf board was a so good trhese companys never learn untill they go under
i totally agree with asrock, i use to dabble in older socket 754 motherboards etc and every asrock board i used just stopped working , but ive purchased seeral am4 boards from asrock and they all work pretty well i can tell they have come a long way from the early mid 2000s till now , honestly im shocked to say ive had a successful ECS b350 motherboard working just fine as well , never thought id say that considering all my older motherboard platforms like X58 ,X79 etc are predominately asus due to the overall success i had with their products then
What about Intel boards?
Asus has become the Range Rover of the PC world…expensive and looks good…that’s it 😮
Steve is the MVP here.
Totally support you Jay - lately they are too much on everything sadly they dont care about anyone..
I had tons of problems with USB audio interfaces on my AMD rigs. Both a MOTU M2 and a PreSonus Revelator would both have random audio dropouts. I was able to find some information about it being related to certain XX70 series motherboards. I wound up going back to intel during 12th gen and all of my DACs and interfaces have been trouble free.
MSI been way higher quality than Asus for a long time. MEG boards just have so many more features at a lower price point
They can't even fix the fast charge notification bug after lots of people have been complaining for a year. No explanation, no action at all.
f**k no more formula boards for me then :( well s**t was gonna upgrade easily with next gen cpu's now i need to do research
Stoked to be a Gigabytye owner, yes their control center software blows, but their boards are solid as a rock, and I haven't any any issues with their service.
I've been saying this about Asus for quite a long time now, glad Steve and Jay have seen it too as hopefully it will break through some of the blind fanboyism that people have for them!
I am shocked Asus would so this, I've used their products for years, back before the b550 released the Ethernet port on my b450 rog strix died i had the board over year at this point, so i called customer service and asked for the driver for it because it was reporting an issue in windows Asus offered me an rma right on the spot
and go away i will now from Asus, same as i did with MSI, guess gigabyte is now somewhat the only reliable brand out there, so gigabyte let me tell you this, MAKE GOOD MOTHERBOARD AND DONT FUCKING SCREW US CONSUMERS OVER
So, may I get one of those motherboards? I’m willing to take the risk for a free, high-end motherboard.
I was considering buying an ROG Ally. Think I'll pass now.
Jay we need the influencers like your self who depend on us viewers for to get together and use the influence you have to eather start a computer parts company with a more stringent qc befor sales. Or creat a company or governing body that protects us the consumers against bad actors in the industry
Don't ASUS realize me as a Comsumer spending $200 dollars and up is a lot of money I'm giving up to enjoy your product that ends up being a  heap of crap you just lost a good customer thanks ASUS.
The strix 3090 coil whine from Asus was the last straw for me. Always used MSI boards since 1156 even though they love them some jacked up voltages as well.
i jsut boguht a asus 13th gen intel board and already having ram issues and having to take it back
Make a video of you pouring bud light on Asus motherboards.
So which X670e motherboard should I buy? I'm really wondering
Thank you Jay!
I can't remember any ASUS hardware that I've ever decided to use.
is the asus z790 hero maximus board fine?
i used to like asus before i got my ryzen 5 2600 and asus prime b450m-a mother board had so much issues with the hdd controler ans usb controler , i was loosing my hdd at boot and some of my usb devices was reseting while i was using them so when i decided to buy a new ryzen 5 i went with msi for the motherboard im done with asus
I was planning to get an asus mlb. I guess i will just buy msi.
I have had a similar situation with their C204E chromebooks. Out of 450+ we have had over 100 have their USB-C charger ports break. Around a 25% failure rate in 2 years. Yes these were for kids but we have other USB-C chromebooks in use and have had maybe 2 ports break in a similar way. The port is obviously different on the replacement boards. Until recently they weren't replacing them after warranty. Evidently are now. No official recall.
this is really upsetting to hear as I always went to ASUS because they were top of the line and highly regarded.. this sucks.
Every PC I’ve built in the last 25 years has been Asus - and NOT  cheap ones….. I have ALWAYS built absolutely over-the-top PC’s every 2-3 years ($3-5k builds) and multiple multiple “Extreme” motherboards. My less than 2 year old AM4 /x570 rig just died (motherboard) and I had decided to just build a new x670E - and I have the $700 Asus board in my cart along with a 7800x3d - I have never had a “great” RMA experience with Asus, but only had to RMA a board once, so they got a pass, in spite of their premium prices.  Sooo glad I saw this video - Thank you Jay!! And thank you Steve for finding the issue….. I’ll be looking into other brands and staying away from Asus.
here's a question ...if it weren't for YouTube and the other partnerships where would you be?
Been saying this for YEARS! Asus is a horrible company. Got a brand new mobo from them a few years ago that fried (2) 2700x's and I had to fight them to get the mobo replaced... And I had to pay for shipping!
This makes me glad I didn't go with any asus hardware on my build; dodged that bullet. Luckily the only asus product I have is a 4k monitor.
All the hype of the the ASUS ROG Ally... I wouldn't trust ASUS to support it, improve it, or offer repairability for it.
I feel like 7th gen Ryzen has been shitty with Asus boards and it's sad cause I love Asus but I will not go with MSI again but ASRock I use to mess with back in the day worked flawlessly but doesn't Asus own ASRock as well
I TELL YOU WHAT JAYY I LISTENED TO STEVE BEFORE 12TH GEN DROPPED AND GOT A I9-10900K AND THIS CPU HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING IVE TROEN AT IT AND I MULTITASK I EDIT I USE BLENDER ALL THE WHILE RUNNING GAMES SOMETIMES OR 20 BROWSER TABS WHILE EDITING LOL AND THIS CPU HAS BEEN PHENOMINAL
Thank you. I respect this a lot. Thank you for representing gamers, and enthusiasts.
ASUS Sucks so hard they almost Helped me to Forget What a stable System is. ASUS BIOS & Memory Topology is bad for about 10 Years Now.
Time to see if I can cancel my ProArt motherboard
Ditched Asus boards around 2008, never looked back.   But i remember how asus almost was porsche-like when i came into pc building.
Well this sucks as I've just made my verry first build for myself using an Asus motherboard. Guess I just have to cross my fingers and hope that nothing bad will happen, since i cant afford to just swap it out with an other brand at the moment. because my build is only 2 weeks old. I was planing to make an all out Asus rog strix build and so far I have gotten an Asus rog strix b550-f motherboard, AMD ryzen 7 5700x cpu.  And was planning to get an Asus rog strix ryujinn II 360 aio, and an rog strix gpu an psu. I think that I will have to re-think my options as to how i will proceed with my build now. Sutch a shame, because i really like their overall design and was really looking forward on getting the aio as i think that it is the coolest one on the market right now. but seeing you guys as content creators struggle so mutch with Asus, I'm kinda scarred how us regular customers will probably have an even harder time if something goes wrong.
Eh, anyone who has been around computer hardware long enough knows this isn't the first time that ASUS (or any other brand) has gotten themselves in hot water. Just like the last couple of times ASUS made the shit list in the last 25 years I've been involved with computers, we'll avoid their products for a short time and then they'll be back on the good side. Remember when MSI fucked everyone over? Or Corsair's absolute garbage quality that pushed people away? I applaud standing up for consumers and I applaud Jay for not putting sponsorship above morals. That lets me know that his endorsements mean something beyond money. Looking forward to seeing what we should be buying instead for the next year or so, as ASUS has been my go to for the better part of 25 years (minus those couple of times when I had to buy Gigabyte boards because ASUS was making garbage those years lol).
Yea, I dont plan on buying anything with ASUS on it. MOBO i've always went with MSI and Gigabyte. I bought a ASUS Z87 A if i can rember back in 2013 ish. IT was DOA, went through their customer service and I got a big f*** you in lamest terms. Ever since, I've stayed away from them.
I've had a few issues with them sending me damaged mother boards as well. I'm so happy I made the switch to MSI!
Wow, just WOW... I do not even know even know what to say... I just don't... 25 years, I have used ASUS... it's the ONLY MOTHERBOARD I have recommended to anybody, ever, because of their good solid rep... but to watch this... I am almost in tears at this point... this is so freaking sad, disappointing, and grotesque from an industry lead of so many years it is literally heart breaking. If this holds water -- and I have no reason to doubt you Jay, then I am no longer going to recommend people buying ASUS hardware at all --- not until they shape up BIG.   ASUS, you massively disappoint me. You really do. Completely and utterly!
Really crazy how willing these companies are to just piss away years of good brand representation like it won't harm them.
banana republic of gamers.
I purchase a $1400 Asus laptop recently total trash. Crashed within 1 hour of using it , wifi unstable keeps cutting out ,touchpad lags.
So what brands do you recommend now? MSI and others seems to have poor pr recently too
Asus QC has gone down hill the last few years. Glad you are taking a stand. EVGA Set the bar high for quality. I've seen many faulty Asus boards in the last few years, and even had the backward capacitor one, uhg. I was there with the Mired Media raid, but no one can talk... for a month :(
I had issues with both Asus and Newegg back when I had the AMD FX series processors. That was about 10 years ago and I haven't dealt with them since I was sold a Asus board that litterally blew a hole in the board when powering up. Not to mention I bought the board from Newegg just because they had the white version I wanted.I have been using MSI since and have had no issues. Asus customer service back then was horrible to deal with back then and to see that they have gotten worse is a shame as I did like the look of the boards.
Thanks jay we already know asus sucks, rip off and scams customers, no warranty???? Amd and asus ahould be ashamed… I gave up on asus long ago, msi is my go to….
But who is better let's be honest
never buying asus after this video until they get their act together
Interesting timing of this video and all of their issues with current gen products given that my ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (WiFi 6) AMD AM4 Zen 3 Ryzen 5000 ATX board is dying on me. It’s been giving me problems after a few months of purchasing. It started off as little things and now it is much more serious one year later. I really need to get the mobo serviced soon.
What is the Best MB for a high end i9 build? I was planning on using the ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Hero? Who makes a Comparable MB?
Asrock also improved heaps recently, their mid to top tier AM4 and AM5 boards are rock solid, they surely do not deserve the reputation they have anymore. Sure the budget boards are hot garbage but that is true for any board maker.
Asus has been a horrible brand for years, it started with their "cheap" products with the worst design decisions and the most mediocre component choices possible, and slowly make its way up to their high end, as people kept pretending nothing out of the ordinary was going on, so they had no problems.  Asus had to practically self-destruct their high-end components for people to realize their decline.
I’m seriously considering switching out my Asus B550-E and my son’s Z670 for MSI boards…. Are ours working?  Yes.  Do I trust them to keep working?  Not at this point.  If I could return them, I would in a heartbeat.  F Asus…
Tomorrow, I am going shopping for the parts for a new 7800X3D or 7950X3D system. I was considering the purchase of an ASUS mobo as I have been using the X570 Strix Gaming E Wifi with my 3900X and then 5950X for a few years without issue. Had a B350 Plus before that with my Ryzen gen 1 1700. Rock solid. After viewing this and Steve's video, however, ASUS has been removed from my shopping list. Thanks for your work, both Jay and Steve. Educating and illuminating as always.
We need more people like this out there in the world, generally. We all need to let the big corporations understand that they’re not running the show. We are! We, the consumers, who are putting money in their pockets and making them have their jobs. It’s not the other way around. I have also watched Steve’s video earlier and this is absolutely unacceptable! This comes from someone who was a huge fan of (nearly) all Asus products in the past. With this move they’ve made, they have one customer less.
You can send your ASUS boards my way
I really regret getting the  latest Asus motherboard and monitor. Seems like hardware is going in the same direction as games. We getting the early access and stuff is breaking and not working. ASUS how about you get a real QA team and stop using us for that.
literally just canceled my ally preorder because something is fishy about how all of the reviewers have been reviewing the ally..all ive been seeing is a lot of edited clips showing game play but not some of the more technical things about how it functions during normal use and  i just dont feel like they are being honest about how some of the key features of what makes me love the steamdeck will work on the ally...p.s. i feel like valve separated desktop mode and gaming mode for a reason..and that same reason is why any videos ive seen demoing the ally have been edited the way they have..because it doesnt work like they want you to believe
I posted this on GN's video, but I figured it was a FYI.   Just like they've slithered out of fixing the random crashes on their G15 AE they've sold through Best Buy (this is a very common issue for this laptop).  Instead they point you to Best Buy support, which aren't knowledgeable enough, and don't have the access needed to solve it.  So basically, most people are stuck with a brand new laptop that has CTDs for no good reason.  I have one, and I believe I have circumvented the issue, but it's not a realistic "fix" for everyone.
I picked up a Colorful CVN Z790 GAMING FROZEN V20 for a white build, they have it at newegg, its every bit as nice looking as the Apex (white pcb etc) and half the freaking cost too.
You should try swapping out your at home systems motherboard with a different brand. Then you could see if you still have those EXPO issues.
I guess it's convenient you only have to listen to GN to decide which brands to drop.
This gen is weird. I've slowly been buying parts for a build since jan this year.  I purchased a fractal lumen aio and it was recalled so had a 5 month wait for a replacement.  Since then I almost purchased a samsung 980 mvme, 4090, asus x670e hero mobo and 7800x3d that when I was about to buy that day some issues have came out.  P.c building is expensive and fucked it seems.
A reasonable but "TUF" decision to make...I'll see myself out. Anyway. The recent behavior of Asus that GN Steve and you talked about is somewhat mind boggling and scummy.   As an "Asus guy" for the last odd 15 years, it is extremely dissapointing.  Ironically, I have never had any serious problems with my Asus products, mainly MBs and GPUs, outside of some headaches from dealing with their "RBG software".   - edit - Actually, I have a secondhand Z170 Maximus VIII Ranger with a delidded 6700k that will boot ONCE with the iGPU and then get stuck at VGA debug LED until I clear CMOS after which it will again boot ONCE but then will be straight back being the stuck with VGA LED unless I use an actual GPU in the system. I don't know which one is actually to blame since it's such a weird problem though.
They have been doing this for years. The Asus Z170 also blasted io sa over 1.35v on 6700k it was so bad it black screened no post.
Just tried building a rig for my ex wife's son.  Got a brand new ROG Strix B550-F II and it was dead on arrival. That's the last time I recommend their boards. Not really sure who to go to now as I've had bad experiences with MSI
Great, my first new build since 2016 and I go AMD and got a good deal on an AM5 Mobo from ASUS. Just great. Wish these videos would have come out 4 weeks ago so I wouldn't be stuck now
So complacent that they'll sell $2,000 4090 strix OC cards with mediocre binning no better than $300+ cheaper cards. I wish evga was still around
Sheeeesh! Glad I went with an MSI board, ASUS riding brand loyalty straight into the ground
OMG what a bad decision I made I was between asrock taichi and x670e-e wifi and ended with the asus one e.e
ASUS has been a great brand for me even coming from MSI motherboards I left MSI after the x570 GAMING EDGE WIFI had heating problems with my R9 3950x and got the ASUS ROG CROSSHAIR VIII HERO no problem with them pc boots fast I don't need the lastest updates for bios but I know if I have to go through support issue with ASUS like in 8 years for my next PC build I won't use them but they have time to make a comeback by then
I’m happy i decided to try Asrock this go around. I’m really hoping i don’t have issues.
Well damn, Asus is going to feel this one.
Wow glad I haven’t bought anything for my build yet because asus was the brand I was going for with amd cpu and graphics.
Just dont buy a x3d processor
Jay thanks for taking a stand on this but make sure you very clear that this is an AMD platform issue and not an intell one  for those less informed.
I've been almost exclusively using ASUS motherboards for almost 10 years now, as I felt their bios was more mature / well made than most other brands, and for a while they seemed way ahead on build quality. I had some specific issues with Gigabyte and EVGA about 4-5 maybe 6 years ago, but at this point, I have to agree with everything said in your video - it's a shame to see what WAS a top-tier brand rest on their laurels, and yeah, they can be kind of cocky - imagine what it's like to be extremely technical and capable but NOT a big name like you, the condescension is no joke. "This board is clearly bad because of X Y Z repeatable and provable things" "... but have you tried... " UGH.   I hope this is a wake up call and they improve.
Yeah, after this recent bs, you should defintely tell ASUS they can keep their sh*t lol
This is making me Reconsider getting my Tuf 4090 Now... Might Just Go MSI...
i rock an asrock x570 phantom gaming 4 motherboard in my pc wit h a ryzen 7 3700x (hopefully upgrade to a 5800x3d or 5950x depending on price/which one will be better for games/unity stuff) laptop wise its an asus tug gaming a15 2019 model  think when i have the money im going to get me a better gaming laptop that isnt asus since they been forcing their bull stuff software via windows update and i always have to disable/uninstall all of it
I bought a 7800x3d and a rog x670e just not long ago. I am happy that the store i bought it from was not scummy, and the recomand me to return it and help me find somthing better. All thnx to gn reporthing this. And u 2 jay for doing this. ❤
Boy this shit wouldn't fly in aus and the ombudsman would say nope, you fried their component you are responsible to compensate them
I find this very very sad, but also important that channels like this an GN stand up and are counted, holding even some of the biggest brands to account where you see wrong being done. I have been a loyal follower of ASUS for well over 20 years, no matter how big your brand gets the days where you can simply rely on that and start treating consumers badly are gone. Some of the biggest brands ever have vanished because of poor customer service and product, just ask Syquest and others how that went for them. Thanks for keeping your integrity.
Yea i hope evga has an amd board by the time i need to upgrade i plan on riding out my x370 crosshair and 3900x till the give out so they got time
I have been running MSI boards for the past 10 years after having one bad ASUS board in my very first build. I have had ZERO issues with MSI. They just work, in my experience.
Bruh, Wendell reps Asrock hard. I trust Wendell.
It's always some d1ck head manager.
Ill take that strix 4090 off your hands pal.😎 Its the new gen stuff and a failure of the rma dept. The build quality is outstanding on my x570 dark hero and Asus wasn’t the only board brand to blow up a 7800x3d. Don’t you think your being a little tough on them? You always have said every company has their issues from time to time. Part of this is on Amd. But, I totally agree on a 700 dollar board any issue should be covered.  Sounds like asus lawyers got involved and put out that screwed up statement on a bios that may fix a major issue. They will certainly respond to you and Steve putting the hammer down.
I had a ASUS ROG Strix B550-I in my rig for over a year that worked perfect hen 3 months ago I started having issues with my computer having extreme slowdowns. Practically frozen but I could move my cursor but nothing else opened.  I had to shut down via power button. I started googling and people have had the same issue with the board for a year. Tried changing all kinds of settings in windows, in bios, etc..Reinstalled windows. Nothing ever helped. I could never reproduce the issue manually, it just happened at random. Could happen 10 minutes after turning on the computer and booting up a game or I could play a game for 6 hours then it would happen. It started happening 2 or 3 times a day so I gave up and bought a new motherboard. Not a single issue since.
technically didnt Asus buy Asrock a few years  back?
Not to mention the absolute shit-show that is Asus bundled software... Armory Crate is one of the worst piece's of bloated shovelware I've seen., and the problems induced by their lighting control software... Historically, I have always preferred Asus products right up to the Rampage VI Extreme. But That was the last Asus product I have ever purchased. IT was becoming clear at that point that Asus were becoming increasingly committed to being anti-consumer along with the sacrificing of QA (how else do you manufacture and launch entire ranges of motherboards with components mounted back to front) and their products have been getting increasingly unreliable since that time.  Asus are sinking their reputation, with terrible software, worse QA, worse Consumer support, and now their software failures are creeping into the UEFI/BIOS code too. It's not good enough.
I have RMAed my monitor (PG32UQ) 3 times in the past year and it's still not fixed. I have been buying ASUS products (monitors, mobo, network) for years. 100% finished with them.
They can’t be worse than gigabyte there warranty process is a failure on every level
And this is why I won’t be upgrading my B450 Motherboard anytime soon
exactly... if they put out a bios version no matter the stage it is in, they must honor their warranties in my opinion.  That is so messed up the way they treated  you.  All I know is, in a few years when I should want to upgrade this current rig, I will not be using ASUS parts.  I just built my rig using ROG STRIX B550 F a few months ago now.  😞
I've got 2 Asus motherboard's, one I've had for 10 years, and one I've had for 5 years, and I haven't had any issues with either of them. But I'm done with them too. Releasing faulty products that cost that much money is bad enough, but basically baiting people into voiding their warranties by using Asus' own software is downright despicable. I can't put money in the pockets of a company that does shit like that.
Mad Respects. Us gamers and long time Asus fanboys, Have left asus a long time ago.
My Asus P 790 came with a bent pin and they wouldnt exchange it but rather me pay to fix it lol. I ended up getting a msi 790. No more Asus for me.
I told you a while back it was the motherboard when you started having issues.   I forsworn ASUS tech for almost 10 years because of quality issues.   I'm glad you are finally coming around to the realization that a lot of people did. We aren't just “haters” we are pissed.   ASUS used to be a great company. It's not anymore.
Buying 7800x3d next week and mb was planned Asus strix. Guess is it still Asus mb in my basket. No it’s not.
"...and the second I went live, this happened:" AdSense Best Buy ad with broken fridge!
Asus wants to think they're Apple, and charge premium prices, but the quality of their products have been suspect for a long time.  They still think it's 1999 and that they're selling P3B-F motherboards by the truckload.  Back in 2015, I bought Asus Zenbook laptops for my mother-in-law and my father, and they both broke due to stupid reasons.  On one, the LCD screen just glitched out and created a giant horizontal gap in the video.  The other one had adhesive (!) holding the screen to the hinge just crack and caused the hinge to break the screen.  This is all from regular opening and closing of the lid!  These laptops weren't treated any rougher than a laptop should, but they failed just from regular use.  Utter garbage.
i really wish i hadnt bought this asus rog strix g18 bc now im afraid that this is gonna get borked as well
Get em jay 😂
Yeah I built an AM5 build about a month ago using an asus board and this whole thing is making me regret it, and I probably won't use their boards anymore either.
ASUS was my favorite brand. ASUS what are you thinking. Jay replace ASUS with Asrock.
My 7950X3D was the first system that I used an Asus board in long time. I always used Gigabyte and never had issues. I'm regretting my decision right now after this video.
This sucks because Asus makes the nicest looking boards. MSI is always getting hacked and all the others look bland.
FFS, even Biostar has better customer support than Asus. Assrock is an actually solid brand now, MSI has pretty much stopped acting like Evil inc, WTF is going on?
the funnier thing is that the embargo for the new asus portable just dropped and LTT were the first guys to review it   Linus for sure is crying in the bath due to all of this
I love Apple, buy a mac mini for streaming
So what does that mean? I shouldn't buy  Asus Motherboards right now?
I've always been an Asus fan, but I've experienced the same stuff in recent years. I agree with your sentiment entirely, the only Newegg "bent pins" out of the box were... Asus... So... Yeah... Interesting...
PC building has gotten too big and popular, and greed has caused everyone to start cutting corners. When I started building during the Pentium 3 days, there were not nearly this many widespread problems with new generation components. All of this is disheartening to anyone who does this for fun or necessity.
Arogant and incopetent... these are often tight together
Yep. I was an ASUS faithful for nearly two decades. No more!
All of my personal builds over the last two decades had Asus motherboards. My current build has an Asus motherboard (Prime B450m-a I'm not a super gamer or anything like that). I have never had to RMA an Asus motherboard in any of my builds and several of the boards that I passed on to friends lasted over 10 years before they were replaced. I'll probably use my current system for another year, at which point I will build myself a new system without an Asus motherboard. They were sooo good... man this really sucks.
ive been all ASUS for the last about 15 years.. the straw for me was last summer when i was looking for a 400w 3080ti and ASUS's were about 200-300 more than all the others.. So i went with EVGA for the 1st time.. and the 1st time my entire pc wasnt all ASUS in a loooooong time
I just bought a z790 hero hope I dont run into problems.
Sitting here terrified that my z690-plus wifi D4 board is just gonna spontaneously combust one day when I turn my PC on now
Damn.. i always used to run asus mobo and evga gpus.. boy my next build will be something totally different.
Good thing that ROG Ally came out today, it’ll save them from any real financial loss since we can trust them to build quality devices
i have never had luck with asrock, the first board i used was for a customer when i was at a computer store in the early 2000s. i have also never had good luck with asus over 3 of my own boards. but i do not like to say that they are bad brands, i just had bad luck. i have only owned one "bad" gigabyte board, but the only problem is that the argb doesn't work. these companies all have issues, it can be a lottery, but this issue is VERY MUCH over the top, an entire series of boards that they aren't willing to own. it is a slap in the face.
Since 700 MHZ i have never had a MOBO die on me ( knock on wood ) and TBH in the older days i used a lot of ASUS. BUT ! Yeah judging from all the flack out there, it seem like there are some truth to it all. MSI - ABIT - DFI - ECS - ASUS - Gigabyte, been there done that, and FYI i am contemplating a Asrock board for my next build.
I'm pretty concerned. I just finished a build with an asus mobo and asus gpu. Appreciate you putting your viewers ahead of sponsors for real though.
I haven't trust asus motherboards for years there mobos are so low quality all the way back to intel devils canyon launch.
Love your stuff Jay, welcome to the club, I went through FOUR of the Asus Rog Ryujin II 360 coolers, and they are not cheap coolers, each one failed, the last one is barely hanging in there, but I too am done with Asus. Fortunately I stuck with MSI MBs.
Asus F'ed around and found out.
I wonder what JJ is thinking.....
My strix b550-i motherboard crapped out after just downgrading my gpu to an older model. Asus won't even accept it to take a look as a RMA and won't specify a reason so down my baby till I scrape together a new motherboard.
the ASUS website is sketchy now too, when i click on saved bookmarks to check to see if there is an update for one of my family's routers, the site will take too long to load and then usually give me "we'll be right back" message. it seems like they've stopped supporting all their AC routers and only supporting their AX routers. my brand new budget i5 pre-build i just got from CC, has an ASUS MoBo and GPU.  i hope those products don't fail on me.
I gave on ASUS in 2018 when I took over the computer store I run and saw how cheap they've been going. My previous rig was all ASUS and it's the last time. Current rig is all MSI. Not sure what I'll do if I have to give up on them.
THIS... THIS video is the reflection of my Asus experiences since the ASRock/Asus split (They were one company that was split in two by their parent company).  Terrible RMA experiences, friends getting screwed with Asus (The old Asus Extreme for the Intel Quad series was a NIGHTMARE), and for my one friend the SAME WHITE BOX TREATMENT with a replacement motherboard.. except they "upgraded" him to the Asus Extreme 2 but failed to give them ANY accessories, including the back-plate, sound card riser board (which was completely different from the Asus Extreme).. it took him another six months of emails to get that sorted and have those things sent to him.. meanwhile he gave up and swapped in a Gigabyte board and stopped having issues.
It took three Z790 Maximus Extreme's for me to get a working board. First was just bad out of the box, wouldn't post. Second was a sorry excuse "Open Box" product from Newegg that had bent pins in the socket. Crazy QC to have a board like that be bad.
Money over quality. Shouldn't have to undervolt.
Thank You, Thank you, thank you. After I had 3 ASUS ROG AMD X570 Motherboards fail in less than a ONE Month period, along with a total lack of help needed getting answers from ASUS, I decided to use another brand.  By the way we appreciate your adds for Microcenter. If it wasn't for your adds directing us to them in the first place. I would not have been able to return them.  P.S., Microcenter offers protection plans that cover just about everything they sell.. So please use this service it has been well worth it.
for those you younger people in the crowd, asrock was a budget brand from asus. they split ways in 2002.
Dude your gonna miss a lot of handheld content
But....Ally Ally Ally....
Msi and gigabyte is way better fuck Asus
My AMD PC build is using ASRock for motherboard, and yes, it never had an issues
I started building computers 24 years ago and I have always used Asus boards. From time to time I would use intel, gigabyte but they always had weird issues which never made any sense. Working in PC retail for 7 years before becoming a network admin I was exposed to lots of different hardware including the first Crosshair and Rampage boards which were successors to the P5W DH. The high end boards from Asus always seemed to have issues which is why I always stuck with the entry to mid level boards, even to this day. With this issue and the way they handled it, I have no idea what I am going to use now since they've always been rock solid and now I can't trust them with my customers anymore.
They messed up big.... why would I trust that the ASUS rog ally or Rog 7 would be any differnet. ASUS just killed there whole product line.
I feel like I've had more misses from them than hits over the years.   Had a Z87 motherboard of theirs in my first custom build. Reset it to defaults one day after about a year, and suddenly it would only boot in hyper-specific RAM configurations. They "repaired" it twice, with me paying the shipping to them both times, and still wouldn't boot unless it had one specific configuration. Threw the board out when they said I could ship it to them and they would attempt a repair again but would not replace it. Ran a Core 2 dumpster dive build the whole time it was pending and until broke college student me could get a cheap B85 board.  Got a router of theirs used but in like-new condition from a co-worker, and 13 months later I came home to it totally dead. Got some lights... but recovery flash was a no-go. Contacted Asus to see if I had any warranty based on serial number... and they recommended I pay for repair services that were more than the street price of the device. Real helpful.  Put one of their low-end, low-profile GPUs in a family member's PC that had old and terrible integrated graphics. It was out of warranty at this point, but it did something glitchy one day, I tried to reinstall drivers as troubleshooting... and it just never loaded any driver ever again.  Bought a USB-to-2.5Gbe adapter from their subsidiary Asustor, which was good. Tried to buy another and it was DoA.   Bought a router from them, which after hours of attempted setup and connectivity problems all over the place I returned as DoA. Was sent a replacement, which was ALSO just as disconnect-happy and got returned as DoA as well.   Got a ProArt monitor that's been good though!
Thanks!!! @JayzTwoCents for that good or BAD info about ASUS..
Looks like I dodged a potential bullet when I switched a Ryzen 7000 build from Asus to MSi 3 weeks ago, just before the exploding CPU thing started gaining traction. Was my build likely to have problems?  No.  But I'm still sleeping a little better at night knowing my house isn't as likely to burn down.
i stopped buying their products after i had 2 mobos die for no reason 11 years ago and 1 mobo just have its soundcard flop for no reason, all of these boards were super babied  /shrug.  I switched to ASrock after and never looked back, their stuff lasts and they are solid.
My original X670-E Crosshair Hero had a broken pin on it. Yeah, they're on some bullshit.
Spend a few hundred dollars more, and overclock for 5-10% performance gain is meaningless & stupid,  it generates more heat, more fans more noise, and cause instability. Overclocking is used to save money (Celeron 300A OC to 450), not to show off. Prime & TUF series are less problematic than ROG, because they have less parts.
i have A B650M-PLUS WIFI with Ryzen 5 7600.. I UPDATED WITHOUT READING.. i buyed ASUS all my life, even laptops, but this crap i dont like
bummer that asus is sponsoring ltx23
@JayzTwoCents what itx am5 motherboard should get now my build is getting so mess up now.... Damm Asus!!
The only interaction I had with ASUS is because of my laptop. My keyboard's LEDs sometimes didn't turn back on after opening the lid,. Also, the WIFI adapter was not always being detected after waking the computer... I tried all their firmware and nothing changed. So I left a bad review about that laptop. A rep replied and said I should have updated the firmware before posting my review... So I contacted their customer support and never heard from them. I changed from Windows to Linux, since then the WIFI problem have completely eliminated but the keyboard issue is still happening.
Cheers mate!
I had an asus prime x399a arrive dead, ordered a zenith extreme alpha board and it had bad led lines. Their rgb when set to white turns yellow (had this on the zenith board and a 3090). The bios on my x399 zenith board is fucked. And their lighting software is beyond shit. (even 4 years ago)  Next rig will have to go with another vendor, I just can't be fucked to deal with the quality of parts and lack of software support.
150 max on a board especially for gaming, imo just rediculous
Looks like Asus launched their SteamDeck competitor on the worst day possible...
waaaaaay back (guessing around 2010) I dumped ASUS for build quality... never went back. So far I have been relatively lucky with the Gigabyte boards since then... but the current environment with 7000 AMD CPU's seems like its going to be a wait until stuff gets sorted... which is fine for me... I may even debate staying with the 5000 Ryzen for my next build as I want to do an ITX build next... and heat is already a challenge in those builds.
I swear if mines or brother motherboard goes wrong for this upgrading to new ryzen 7000 I never get asus . I’m so scared of my PC breaking Bec it  long time to save up
I just started getting into PC Building two or three months ago, planned everything in detail and decided to go with the new 7800x3d and the strix 670e, because a white board would fit my overall look perfectly. Then out of a sudden things started rolling…Guess that’s called a jackpot 😅
Asus trying to buy back just the boards  Gamers Nexus  was after is some really bad behavior. Trying to bribe just the people that Steve was trying to get and not any of the others with the same issues that's shady AF. We all know what they were trying to do. I look for manufactures that send all the boards to Steve to get answers and solve real problems. NZXT has been an amazing company even years after purchase and out of warranty even. When they don't have to do anything. Asked for a case panel I was willing to pay for and they just sent it to me. That's the kind of business I want to deal with. I just wish NZXT made more stuff.
with you on this, time to try other brands!
If I have a B650E-F MOBO for my future build already procured, should I be worried? My CPU is a Ryzen 9 7900x.
It's so funny to see these videos on the launch day of the ROG Ally.
I had to check my calendar to make sure it's not April 1st.
"Solid as a ASRock" lmao. 13:14
Ok so looking for advice on what I should do.  I have a x670e crosshair hero and 7800x3d that I haven’t put in a rig yet.  Should I try and get rid of the mobo and go with a better brand? Or see what happens and hope ASUS sorts their shit out??
Ohh let’s watch as they blame it on covid and supply issues and not own it.
I’ve only had good things to say about ASUS’ internals. It’s a different story about their peripherals, though.
I have an asus rog curved 32" 144hz monitor that takes 5-10 mins to warm up, seems like its broke, lines/ flashing, mouse will work/stop- then once it warms up- everything works fine. problem is, when its really cold- it can take forever.. and it's an every single morning thing. I've dealt with it for the last year+ because I can't afford a new monitor right now for me lol.
Easy, no more Nvidia, oh and no more Asus. I stopped using their shit years ago. Gigabyte, MSI and ASRock motherboards are much much better then the trash Asus releases.
Longtime MSI customer here. Never any issues. Kudos for standing up for consumers.
Thank you so much for your honesty! I used to only use Asus ...no more
I'll put my 2 cents that someone in the logistics department was out or fired from Asus
This bites after just buying a new ASUS mobo without hearing about this... fingers crossed that this one is fine and I'll be going to other brands after this PC. Thankfully I'm using Intel and not AMD
Never had a problem with an Asus product and even my new 760b board running an Intel i9 13900 is doing great, it just sucks that AMD users are experiencing this.  Edit: It's hilarious how people are down voting my comment when I literally said nothing wrong. Internet mob mentality, gotta love it.
I haven't bought an ASUS product in over a decade as they refused to RMA a very expensive 144Hz 1440p monitor (one of the first on the market) because it was a Spanish model and I lived in the UK. I bought it through Amazon UK but it was over a year old when it died, but within the manufacturer warranty. Completely identical to a UK model, only it shipped with a different power brick
ASRock rubbin their hands rn 🤝
MSI is garbage though.  Never received a good board from them.  5 RMAs through them.  Nag.  Aorus going forward
On my Asus board (b650e-f) my lan drivers delete on their own. I’ve tried every single bios aside from the last and the problems persist.
I'm sorry JayzTwoCents... you're fired! Guess won’t be much content here for me to watch now….
It's sad, because Asus has ultimately risen to the place where it's at off of decades of good will on the part of the builder community. I've been building systems with their equipment and recommending them to people for at least 20 years now, and immediately when I saw the 7000 series explosion problem I knew there was a motherboard component to the whole thing. To watch GN's videos and just see how badly Asus has designed these REALLY expensive boards and even left their own so-called protections on the table without effectively using them... it's just shameful.
what's happening with these companies bruh.. 1st was msi, then gigabyte, and now we have Asus.
Havnt checked Gamersnexus for videos yet... But i cant wait to watch him rip asus a new one. While providing all the examples, facts, evidence behind it.
I was going to get an Asus board for my 7800X3D build, but ironically I found the AsRock Taichi Carrara that fit the aesthetics I was going for. Looks like I dodged a massive bullet (although still have to update that BIOS though due to the same SoC issues with the 7000X3D cpus). After all this that's going on, and the fact that Armory Crate is the buggiest piece of software I've used for mouse button customization, I'm no longer confident in buying anything Asus.
So is this ASUS going Bud Light or did Bud Light go all ASUS, followed by ASUS going ASUS again? 🤣Oh man has it been a crazy number of weeks of major well known brands shoesting themselves in the foot...and then to "fix" that they amputate the opposite leg.
I've bought loads of ASUS stuff over the years, including lately B450 & B550 motherboards and RTX 3080; they've all been great purchases (I usually stick with ASUS MB's because I know and really like their BIOS). While I already consider reviews before buying, even from trusted brands, this is a wake up call.
I did a 7900 build last year and against my better judgement bought an asus board and it has weird issues I only bought it because it was 1/3 the price on clearance I kick my own butt because the last Asus board I bought had the same type of Issues and that was in the late 90's
Im impressed. That is all.
I had to actually go to the BBU after ASUS sent me 3 physically damaged X370's... it uh, was interesting. One had a coffee stain.
I'm running an ROG Strix X670E Gaming board with an7950X  for a customer. It constantly disconnected it's onboard network card as well as wifi. There are many users with the issue. But Asus won't fix it, because linux is not supported and error reports from windows are ignored. As of the OS would matter, if the device suddenly disappears from the pci express bus. Intel (the provider of the NIC) blames the bios and mainboard. I have to manually disable power saving and tweak other stuff to have a reliable network connection. I've put Asus off my and any of my customers or recommendation to friends list. But to be honest, there not much vendors left. asrock was ok, but not great. My gigabyte board is not properly supported, the voltage and temp readouts are not working right, because GB changed things and does not publishes the specs. I'm not due for an update soon, but the choice gets difficult when it comes to the point.
Honestly, much respect on standing up for what you believe in. myself on the other hand can I get one of those MB? (haha)
Blaming ASUS when it's your fault for going AMD lol.
I love when the YouTube ads play in your videos.  Jay: "...you guys know the second I went live, this happened."  BOOM YouTube ad.
This is why I love old hardware. the lack of QC in todays hardware is so disappointing. 😞😥
My dad fixes computers for a living and has told me for about 3 yrs to not buy ASUS.  This will be my last ASUS mobo, the X370 that's in my system now. Thank you for the content and solidifying my decision to not support them anymore. When I upgrade, I will be avoiding them like the plaque.
Who remembers when Asrock was shit, at least they finally stepped up
Glad I went MSI on my recent AMD build, I've had a gut feeling something was wrong with ASUS
Thank you so much for posting this. I am having an absolute NIGHTMARE with ASUS RMA process, they are trying to make me pay full price for a board that was defective and damaged on arrival.
I've had to send back 2 X670E Hero motherboards both had so many issues. And they didn't care I will never shop with them again.
OMG The "E" has NOT been standing for Extreme!, But has been standing for EXPLOSIVE!!
WOW much respect here. When almost everyone keep shilling Asus (even Linus today...), it's a ballsy move to put your money where your mouth is. For what it's worth your channel gained a lot of respect from a lot of us.
Haaaa!! My 4090 Strix 🤣. (Got it launch day minute one) had no issues and i hope it stays like that. (Ive always had EVGA's 980ti(sli) and 3080.)
I was just thinking recently that this X570 motherboard was going to be my last Asus product. Which is kinda sad. The question is... Who's the replacement gonna come from?
With all the shady business tactics and/or lack of customer care with these companies... Makes me second guess on whether or not to build a computer..   Who/what is the more "trustworthy" company?
no thats not just asus because thats happening to me.. i have a asrock x670e Taichi and i was getting those sound glitches and everything!!! i really thinks its windows because it happened after the windows update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What board manufacturer is left to go to? MSI and Gigabyte did the same thing not to long ago with their issues, who do we choose now? Unless EVGA starts making boards we are out of luck.
BOMBOCLAAATH
I think ASUS would find it hard to not give replacements under warranty in the UK under Trading Standards which are very tight. They will have no choice but to do something at least for the UK, which would mean a cascade anyway, most likely. Basically, you can NOT sell something that is NOT fit for purpose and I believe that would extend to BETA BIOSes for motherboards, since they know the issues, they would be hammered.
Last month I’ve received a huge amount of inheritance that I was going to build an extreme gaming pc. Good thing I’ve decided not to buy the crosshair, and do go the mid-high build and bought the ASUS ROG Strix B650E-I, it’s been working fine for me so far
Would JTC consider doing a video on how to file a complaint with the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection
Yes, ASUS RMA is horrible. This is known. I once had to RMA the RMA three times before I got a working board.
This is sad that Asus is still having problems. My last Asus product was their Transformer Pad TF700T about 10 yrs ago. That experience was so bad that it put me off the brand.
I miss EVGA
I was planning to do a new build with AMD and Asus MB & GPU... I'm glad that this bullshit got exposed before I got a chance to order parts. I'll probably never purchase Asus products again.
I’ve been using Asus only in my builds, but this video will help me try something new next month when I run up to Denver’s Micro Center.
oh no linus, what about the ally
This is why I've always respected Jay.
Well, I just built one with an asus mobo and so far so good.  Maybe they'll turn it around in a few years when I upgrade again.   I hope so, I'm not using MSI
Mannnn things are getting wild when asrock is technically better than a ROG
So sad.  Asus has been my goto for a really long time.
Never had any experience with ASUS. My first build was a MSI 945GM2 LGA775 that supported pentium 4. (Certified ripper) and it worked flawlessly. 4-5 systems later still on the MSI train with no issues. Guess was just lucky with my first pick
I've never been an Asus fan. When I was in business, I rarely used Asus boards (usually when there was no other "brand name" board available). Over 1000 computers later, turns out that hunch was correct. KUDOS to you and GN and others who stand up to them!
I find it very suspicious that your build has all of these strange memory stability and usb stability issues, while you're seeing "normal" vsoc. I'm starting to wonder if their board actually cannot function with lower voltages, and they're trying to hide it.  Disclaimer, I've been using ASUS boards for a long time, and never had one that didn't had one weird impossible to fix bug. The last board I got them them have a defective asmedia USB controller where if anything is plugged in into the *only* usb 3.2 gen2 port, the board refuses to POST...
Damn.. Shots fired.. Good on you Jay!
they dug them selves in hole,should of sucked it up, recall them all until further notice.retailers should also think, hey we should hold this item back .
Isnt Asrock owned by ASUS??
For AMD borads then, its Taichi for the 670E, or is there something else worth looking at?
One day in want to get my first computer ever but make a desktop
Lol just went over to Linus page didn't know ltx 2023 is backed by Asus Rog.....hahaha ha bet Linus is hating his life right now hahahahahah
There'll be no ASUS anything for me after watching this. I was looking into possibly getting a Zenbook Pro. My Surface Pro 2 is on its last leg, so I need to replace it. Thanks for looking out for us, Jay!
Asus lost me as a consumer when they wouldn't fix my gpu. It was a 5700xt asus tuf. They wouldnt accept my rma so i was just stuck with a gpu that would over heat and shut off.
Me staring at my ASUS Z790 Maximus Hero w/ 13900K that I just finished a build with...and keeps giving me erratic BSODs every couple days.  Also the CPU_FAN and CPU_OPT register backwards in bios.
No more ASUS products for me either.  Not after trying to weasel their way out of warranty support for broken hardware.  That's a non-starter.  I wish you a very go out of business, ASUS.
Yup! I feel the same way. A $1500 ASUS ROG laptop I bought from Best Buy, didn't realize the critical reviews were about the lack of fans to mitigate the heat that it produces. 6 months later my internal WIFI card goes out and I can only imagine it was because the heat buildup burnt it up. Yeah never again will I purchase anything ASUS related.
It's too bad, I've loved their products for a while now.
A. S.hitty U.naware S.ystem. ha. thanks for the info Jay and crew!!
Willing to bet half of ASUS employees are diversity hires right now. ESG kills, don't fall for it.
My first and current PC have been Asrock boards. The X570 Taichi has been mostly stable for the past few years, nothing catastrophic. I was recommending an Asus board and GPU for my friend who's building a PC soon. I have a 3070 TUF. Now I'm going to recommend new hardware for him.
Asrock has genuinely improved so much, I’m very happy with my board and my gpu.
I never had good luck with AMD, but what Asus is doing is just trash.
there's been lots of complaints about the quality of their gaming laptops this year too
As an owner of a x670e hero, I thank you giving us customer’s a voice.
I think you should consider gigabyte. I’ve had good luck with their mobos. Not sure why but I never see gigabyte boards on YouTube channels.
i have a mid tier asus mobo with an i5 12600k only issue ive had is with xmp
This video is why I keep following you. Hard core integrity. Thank you.
In a movie script, it'd look like inside sabotage. 🤔
Maybe this will get them to shape up. Asus used to be my goto for quality affordable stuff......  Looks like they have a ways to go to convince us otherwise.
a far cry from back in the days of doing norton ads lmao
I'm glad tech reviewers are standing up for the consumer and holding ASUS accountable for their poor behavior
I always thought Gigabyte was the better mobo brand.
I agree. I'm done with ASUS. I've been building with ASUS almost exclusively for 25 years. Their RMA and support have always been terrible. For what they charge, top quality support should be part of the deal. I'm going eVGA from now on.
It's interesting that this comes out now of all times. Just last week I was in the market to purchase a new motherboard, and the two I was looking at were ASUS and ASRock. I decided on the ASRock board, because it had a better deal despite being the "worse" brand. I can say now that I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
I started to make a all ASUS build when I upgraded my PC....Glad I dodged that bullet....
Who makes great AMD motherboards with an easy to use BIOS? i have always used ASUS products in the past, but i guess i wont be anymore.
Thank you for being credible and an honest to goodness average Joe. I've never been against Asus, they've just always kinda been priced a bit higher when i'm looking.
A few years back I got an ASUS WS board (as they made the best boards from my personal experiences). Installed a supported Xeon with the latest BIOS. Things were running fine set up Windows 10 it did some updates then asked me to reboot to install the updates.When the motherboard re-booted suddenly during POST the CPU just began to smoke!? I quickly shut the power off. After inspecting the source of the smoke I found a similar issue - the motherboard had sent such a high voltage/amperage to the CPU that the socket pins literally had spot welded to the CPU. I sent the board in for RMA to ASUS and they claimed "socket pins damaged no warranty" when I explained the issue they argued with me that their technician claims I personally damaged the pins. (Despite it having obviously melted pins/socket). And that was it. They sent the board back to me and I lost a $500 Xeon and a $500 motherboard.
ASUS has always been trash. I don’t know how people haven’t known.   I prefer the ECS K7S5A. I don’t know about those VIA chipsets anyway.
I stopped using Asus back in the gen 2 Intel days. My wife built an amd system for herself, first build and she picked all the parts. She knew i used ASUS so that's what she got, it came doa. We sent it back and they destroyed the motherboard in their shipping department, admitted to it, but because i didn't pay for insurance they said they won't rma it or send it back. I fought with them for 6 months to get the hardware back. Finally bought a used 1080ti strixx many years later and regretted it but it's what was available at the time. I used to love asus but decided to not ever touch them again. Which sucks because i don't like MSI either. Every msi part i recommended or ordered died within 3 months and were refused for rma through them, but Amazon accepted them thankfully.
thanks for this
Funny asus and msi's gpu sucked this year. Literslly the loudest coil whine units for thr 4090. So what msi asrock or gigabyte boards this year?
I have loved all my Asus products, whether it be PC, Android phone, or peripherals/accessories.
With all of the problems some companies have been facing lately, you'd think they'd get a clue. Consumers can be pushed only so far, and when that limit is reached, it's reached. No matter how big or popular a brand is, there are always others to choose from.
I had been shopping for new PC parts recently, and ASUS was coming up as potentially the best option, but I kept seeing mixed reviews, especially with regard to support after a problem was discovered. So, I guess I'm looking at MSI now, because I am not going to trust a company that doesn't consider their customers worth informing of legitimate fire hazards.
For me it was the fact that they actually had the nerve to blame some of their warranty language on an AMD NDA’d directive was the moment I really realized a titan has fallen
What about the MSI UEFI signing keys leak? Does that not also imply that maybe MSI MB's aren't to be trusted for the next little while?
I have been using ASROCK for years and they have only been getting better.
I saw it coming. Hardware Unboxed tested a lot of AM5 MOBOs and the Asus ones were always the worst in VRM temperature and memory compatibility.
Well I guess I have to rethink my first build...
I really appreciate vids like these
related to newegg
asrock is underated ive never heard of an asrock anything failing and i know its used in ALOT or prebuilds maybe the best board maker in a weird turn of events
I had to go through 4 white Asus RTX 4090’s before I got one that had no defects. The first one I received had chip marks all on the inner parts of the GPU and and a dent mark. The second was even worse. The whole GPU heat sink was completely warped and bended and the outer rear shroud was bended downward. The third GPU that I received had scratches all over the top shroud and had terrible coil wind. It ran hot and loud with all fans going on when I was just watching YouTube or surfing the web. The last one being my fourth one is in perfect condition no psychical damages what so ever and no coil wind. I never had to go through this before with PC parts and I have been building PC’s for 8 years.
thank you for saving me a ton of money, i was having problems with my asus builds for the last year and tbh since b550 - i can't even describe the horror i felt for some of my friends who built an am5 platform lately and are going through hell right now. Everything getting more expensive and asus roasting our parts and not giving a shit - msi and asrock really tried to place better products and in fact they did for good parts.   Lets hope more and more tech yt channels are calling out asus for their bs as well as other media. This has to end somewhere.
ROG = Ripping Off Gamers
I got an asus gl12-cp prebuilt in 2019, and the bios doesn’t even let you adjust XMP settings
No more ASUS, got it. Thanks Jay!
After 9 years i was finally able to upgrade my pc. I got ASUS ROG strix B650E-E and now I'm stuck with it scared AF for my R7 7700x CPU and my PC in general. I don't have the budget for a new one
Brass accents might give you a "cyberpunk sunset" feel, like in Bladerunner.
Well guess I need another MOBO for my build 😅
i rather have a gigabyte psu time b*mb than any ASUS ROG products
i bet the beta bios is just a renamed previous bios with the fine warranty void print to act as a get out of jail free card for them. instead of admission and fixing, they just take the no accountability route. i will never buy another asus product. there is no way back from this. luckily i only ever purchased one product of theirs.
all the problems with amd is caused by asus. i test many asus motherboard and all of them go wrong and fail. then i went msi and all my problems gone, i made so many builds and no more problems whith amd or rams
I never thought i'd see the say. I have a tear in my eye...My boys grown up!! I'm so proud! lol jokes aside, sucks for a good brand go down the toilet!
They will when people stop buying what's Linus take on this
Better alternative to ASUS in terms of gaming pc/laptop: Lenovo
All this right on the launch of their biggest product to date! RIP Ally
AM5 is a terrible platform full of bugs, not all Asus's fault.
I have so much Asus gear.....
watches great video while preordering the Ally*
Cheers, here is a big fuck you to ASUS and their arrogance.
24 hours later ,Jay gets all kinds of white board from all over.
is this happening with their other boards or is it just the new Gens?. i ask because i have the Asus Maximus Formula XII
Why not just switch your current motherboard out for another brand that fit's your motif??  If you're happy with the performance but the bugs that seem to be more Asus than platform...  better than building a whole other system this soon after the fact.   The irony here (for me) is that I was all but an MSI fanboy for the longest time and your channel got me to switch to Asus (TUF Gaming X570) and it's been solid.  But the new platform (6xx series) I'm still on the fence right now.  I really need a new video card before I go upping the base platform. (still running a Vega64).  Too many other things to get caught up on to be able to save for one of these overpriced video cards...
Good reason why I’ve used MSI boards, some of them suck but at least it ain’t killin my cpu
Thanks for this. What a shame. Ive always used ASUS boards. I certainly will not any longer. Much respect!
Done! No more Asus for me...I trust the ones that do this for a living.(YOU)
2:06 not surprising! I have a prebuilt that was gift from family for being a caregiver for them back in 2020. I'm now putting my own money into this computer. The MOBO is an Asus B450m and  man did they cut corners! Ram slots alone was a heart attack to get the ram into, has only one clip but that clip feels cheap af! The fucking PCI slots and GPU slot have tiny cheap piece of plastic to get a GPU in and out of. Butwhy! like GN asked! justwhy! the onboard wifi is flaky, 2 of the usb ports are flakey. All that is jank for no reason.
Long time filthy casual viewer, just now finally pushed subscribe. Appreciate the integrity and speaking out against a brand that otherwise should be one hell of a sponsor. Keep up the great work!
This is why I stop fucking with their mother boards
For sure my new system already has 0 Asus parts, I am done with them.
Asus, you can send me the stuff that Jay don't want! I will review your products.
kudos to Jay, too many creators or influencer are talking about issues when the issues are "tha talk of the moment" and after that, the real next video "look at this product it's no cool" like they forget everything about just to have a collaboration... This is the way to do things, they sucks? This is the door, thank you.... good job Jay
Looks like EVGA will be my very first motherboard purchase when I build my 4K PC. 😎👍  I wonder how badly the ROG Ally will suffer in sales because of this shitty behavior from Asus towards consumers? 🤔  My 2013 Asus Windows 8.1 laptop will be replaced later this year. Any good brands that aren't Dell, Asus, and HP?? Acer? Framework? Lenovo?
ASUS is dead for me ... and since i am the go-to-tech-guy, also for all my friends and family. I bought a bundle, because of asus-cash-back ... i did all the "paperwork" and got an email by asus, that they accepted my request and that i will get my cash-back-money in about 6 weeks ... 14 month later: I did not get a cent or an email ... what a Scumbag move
Respect
At least their monitors are good.
The biggest thing I like about Jay other than his knowledge of all computing things...is he is not afraid to tell the truth about things.  He has no fear to tell us what is what in the pc world.  That is rare in a world where many sell out.
Even if you were to install the beta bios you would probably enable expo which also voids your warranty for both CPU and MB
The FTC will be after ASUS pretty soon for bad or shady business practices. Be careful ASUS on how you treat your customers.
i would absolutely love a follow up on the armoury crate software, a real deep dive into how the software inbeds inself into windows and only a fresh install can remove that junk piece of software
as Steve from Hardware Unboxed made full AM5 mother board review, asus was mostly in bad position, i think only $1000+ boards were better ones, but still bad value, going any other brand than asus is just wise and normal at this point, asus became overhyped company with bad products, something like razer, whose mouses have highest RMA across many shops, you can buy "new" mouse with bad click, works iffy etc... meanwhile there's cheaper logitech option with almost 0 rma... so it kind of is like that now  tbh dunno if razer was ever any good or just good marketing and branding, but kind of popular opinion is that it's over priced and average quality products for some years
They want it to void your warranty because they probably know they're going to have ALOT of returns happening soon and don't wanna lose money by swapping so many boards for free
That RMA story reminded me of Newegg and GN lol. Edit: I should've waited a few seconds before commenting
My Crosshair VII Hero would power off if a specific sensor was read using a application like Hardware Monitor or iCue. Then my Maximus XI Hero had the memory slots stop working was the last straw for me. That’s why for Zen3 I went with a MSI Prestige X570 Creation and a MSI Z590  Unity-X replaced my Maximus XI Hero. Both have been amazing boards. It’s too bad because back in the day my P5N-D with a Q9650 was amazing supporting four cores and SLI for such a bargain price.
Coming from Jay's video about mega-manning his friends new build and he got on Asus a bit there. And also lots of the ROG Ally review videos . . . so this will be interesting
I feel the value of my AM4 systems are going UP! And I was about to sell them to build a new system...
Those USB issues are probably not an Asus thing, can’t speak about the rest of it but AM4 and AM5 have usb issues.
Ive always had trouble with ASUS boards idk what the surprise is. A year ago a got a budget TUF for a build, the board came doa, RMA'd it, this one was alive but had stability issues. I got tired it of it and got a Strix board thinking ok, this is more mid to mid high tier and i bought it from a different retailer.  Memory instability issues that forced me to turn off the PSU directly cuz the entire sysyem went unresponsive.  I got a MSI Ace the next week, its still going strong.
Between Jay and GN Asus is scrambling for a statement. Sucks for them it happens when they released the Ally
Does this bios affect the ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-E GAMING WIFI Motherboard?? Or does this board have any issues?
ASUS took the Steam approach to software, just call it a beta and you can weasel out of any legal liability.
The brands need to understand, it's not about being perfect and not having any issues with your products, it's about the willing to solve those issues, and the way you treat your customers in the process.
Pfft  it’s all the same with all manufacturers, had major issues with MSI motherboards, went through 3 of them, Gigabyte issues and a few others…. Out of all of them I trust Asus more above all
Had 2x Asus x570E Hero, from 2 different shops, fail on me when i last upgraded my system, said screw this... Bought a x570Elite from Gigabyte, worked out of the box and was cheaper... and its still going 100% stable... So ye FU Asus... and Thx for an awsome video Jay and team :)
Dang the early adopter tax sure took one helluva giant hike... 😅😅😅
i cant use my nvme ssd on my z690 asus evangelion mainboard for 1 year now. A lot of people have this problem
Sadly, you're about a decade late.
H E A R D
Bye bye Bud Light, Bye Bye ASUS.
Good info. Consumers need to know what the fuck is going on!
When will you be firing nvidia an amd for being anti consumer?
W Jay
Mmm..Linus? ur turn bub.
The only Asus product I trust is my Asus optical drive 🤣
I been using MSI for years it was reviews from Hardware Unboxed  i been using the pro series its had great reviews and i have not had any problems with MSI good quality at a fair price.I had got a h110 asus motherboard years ago i installed the cpu and ram and it would not boot tried everything even going online for support i got nothing now it was a 50.00 motherboard i just throw it away that hurt 50.00 burned up will i never bought asus again after that some gigabyte and asrock but msi as done me very nicely through the years thats where i am staying at least for now.
This isn't enough to say "Screw ASUS!" The truth is many companies make anti-consumer mistakes, yet everyone continues to use them including Android, Apple, JPMorgan, Bank of America, McDonald's, Walmart, Kroger, Costco & you name it. ASUS still makes quality products other than the motherboards & I'll continue to use their products because just a beta bios update isn't going to outweigh the overall good they have done as a brand since 1989.
are there other white motherboards that will pair well with 7800x3d?  is the 7800x3d worth getting?
Just got my first Asus motherboard in like 5 years (do a lot of upgrading in that time) and haven't had any issues except for ICUE (which troubleshooting with corsair now not totally asus fault yet) but they have been increasing pricing and decreasing quality for years now. Literally the only reason I got the board was because it had a post code on it, open box from microcenter so pretty cheap, and msrp was cheaper than the Taichi eatx motherboard.   Asrock is a good alternative. I don't like this gen of Ryzen motherboards but it seems like everyone is doing the things I don't like so it's not just them.
damn, wtf happened to ROG? They were freaking awesome and now just falling apart.
Man. I’ve always bought Asus mobos. So which brand am I supposed to buy now? 😞
Damn as soon as you went live your viewers got a febreze add. What is asus doing that sucks.
I have an Asus ROG laptop. I like it. However it is the first, and last Asus product I'll buy. The Ally looks great, but I don't trust them.   The Steam Deck isn't as powerful, but man has Valve stepped up for their customers in everyway. I'll enjoy my Deck and wait fir the Deck 2 someday.
I just built a 13100f on a ASUS Prime Z790M-Plus D4 LGA 1700 and NEVER HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE TIME! Load windows and the Network port doesnt work. so use a generic usb wireless adapter ok better. Then for the next day 24+ hours the damn thing goes to sleep and no display! Then randomly I hit the space bar and HOLY SHIT it friggin is all working! WTF . Mind you I built a X570 Taichi 5800x3d a 5600x on a MSI B550-A PRO ProSeries Motherboard Because my ASUS B450 gaming crapped out during bios update for the 5600x! Last Asus I ever buy!
WOW. Much respect for this video
I was a huge ASUS fan boy, MOBOs, cards, monitors, routers, the works. I bought an ROG Phone 5 ultimate when it came out, loved the phone, and used it for over a year, one day it suddenly stopped working, Asus RMAed it, and contacted me to tell me it was water damaged, long story short after much back and forth asus sent the phone back unrepaired. They sent it back with both the front and back glass broken, and sited the likely cause of the water damage was from going into and out of my house during the summer, refused to fix it under warranty, and only got resolved once I got paypal and the BBB involved. I haven't bought an ASUS product since, and won't again.
They better do care because oh boy this is gonna hurt their reputation. Thanks Jay (and also Thanks Steve) for actually caring about the gamers problems.
i was about to get a new ryzen cpu and strix bored but i thank ill keep my r9 3900xt longer
I've had issues with ASUS boards dating back to the socket 775 days with my Core2Quad.  There was a local mom and pop computer shop who said back then that they stopped working with ASUS because of their RMA issues and screwing customers.
I'd say it's more Asus not trusting AMD CPU hardware to stand up to what that update was allowing.  Get rid OF AMD then your problems and Asus's waining confidence in them wont be an issue
Well this sucks lol. I got the microcenter 7900x combo with rog strix b650e-f awhile back. I haven't had the issues that a lot of ppl have. I checked my cpu and mobo all seem well but now i worry for how long. I dont download beta bios because of that crappy rule they put on there. Unfortunately I dont have the means to swap out a AM5 mobo or CPU if AMD if part of this fukery...
Shame, i just bought their ROG Strix 4090 white, hope that at least holds up..
Thats a damn shame, i wanted to use an Asus ITX board in my next build. I guess ill go elsewhere. I loved Asus.
What about auros gigabyte ?never have issues with them
I've been using gigabyte boards for about 15 years.  Haven't had one problem.
Asus quality is poor I got an Asrock Taichi instead
Your channel has definitely earned my respect and it has continued to deserve my respect. Much appreciation to the thought and care you and your team put into the JayzTwoCents channel
New brand name crApSUS 😂😂😂
J.J..........WTF? Pull your groups head out of their ass!
I still have my EVGA GTX295 with LIFETIME warranty.
I just built my last two builds with Asus products. I'm hoping they get their act together for the future or else I'll be switching.
Last time I bought an Asus motherboard was in 2005, I had to RMA the board twice and was never able to get it working properly.  All the same components with another companies board worked fine (with the same chipset).  So never again and I'm glad for it
I stabbed you, here is some bandages but if you take the bandages you cant call the police
Asus think they are Nvidia and that they have no competition. Sorry but no. Bye bye ASUS.
All of these pc companies got a ton of shady things goin' on. When Intel is the last shady, things have gone wrong...  I've limited or underclocked some of my stuff in hopes that it survives beyond this PC Dark age.
I am very surprised. Huge amount of respect for doing this.
"I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed".    The fix to the problem voiding warranty is such a scum move.  Hopefully someone at ASUS will listen and get them back on the right path.
did asus get a new head honcho right before the decline started? i wouldnt be surprised. sounds like they are going through the newegg cycle
Ah ASUS, the Nvidia of motherboards.
Puts on ASUS!
Que fuerte (Mexican slang for daaaaang)
well glad to know thanks for the info i will not buy asus something as important as a cpu and smashed/destroyed cpu pins is unacceptable i would be absolutely pissed even catching fire dude oooh yea got fucked up
I fully agree with what you're doing, f asus. that being said I have a 12th gen ddr4 white mb from asus but eh next time ill just get a different white one 😂 thanks for the info jay!
5:15   "...they just want you to 'go away' as a customer." Maybe we all should just go away?   Love to see their quarterly report when that happens.
Yikes, making me feel buyers remorse for buying my Z790 STRIX-E. I've been a long time ASUS supporter/customer since the Maximus IV days, running alongside with EVGA GPUs and eventually their own. Feels awful that I too in a way have to fire ASUS from my "go to" brands. Their GPUs of course, are rock solid, and for any 3000 series based build I would be okay with a STRIX card, but aside from that, might have to return to MSI or ASRock at this point. Anyone wanna trade?
Subscribed  just because you didn't sell out your fan base for few dollars.
Chinese company, what do you expect?
I love AMD, but when i upgraded my cpu from intel to amd, it was a stark difference in quality and reliability. Not on amd's end, but on the company's they have to rely on. For some reason intel is just taken more seriously and is generally more reliable from my perspective.
Thought about finally trying ASUS MB and GPU on my next PC. Certainly won't do that now or ever until I hear trustworthy people say their products are reliable again.
If this doesn’t persuade anyone that Jay has no loyalties to any one company, I don’t know what would. Jay has ALWAYS LOVED Asus for years! And the fact that he’s axing Asus, says A LOT!
Look at your Asus laptop's how much times they come up in the repair videos all over YouTube they just want your money and they give you absolute garbage... 💰💰💰
respect!
Really makes me question my ROG Ally pre-order.
great video. I was gonna get Asus but I kept on hearing problems from this year but held on hoping they were fixable and quick solutions to be dealt with.
EVGA going good bye in video cards, and my now experince with ASUS makes me not wanna buy stuff from them they been doing shit for years and the fact of the matter msi and gygbyte isnt much better but I feel like I had a better experince with gygbyte stuff then i have with asus. I wish these companies would just stop I get that market is hard but customers buy your product to work  not blow up on them if it does just cover it give them a new product that will god damn work.taking money for low qaultiy product and not guaranteeing that it will work for at least 3+ years .... please. I feel like I dont have any rights to my money and ill just get taken advantage of and they say oh you gave us the money you got a product welp there it is while giving me a piece of metal and plastic that doesnt do anything
This is why I will never be a first gen / cutting edge tech buyer.  Fuck this noise.
Customer service has been so bad! Warranty my ass! They want nothing you if you need help with one of there products!
Ive got a hero and 7950x3d. Its been almost flawless running 6000mhz expo so far, but now im wondering how long thats gonna last. Maybe i should just buy a taichi. I dont really care about the money, ive got enough of it; im worried about asus’s nonsense knocking ssds out if it explodes.
The problem with going with the freedom of information act is that is for government information, Asus product info is still protected.
Asus S*Cks Now...I'm Not Buying anymore Asus Motherboards or graphics Cards.....or Any product they Spit out!😮😮😮
We no longer have rights as a consumer. Companies release unfinished games and expect us to be happy about it. They increased the premium of the price and we're expected to be happy. I intentionally repeated that statement I am not happy.
Yeah I heard bad things about asrock after I bought a couple of their boards and I didn't see it, my cheapo b450, b550, and h670 have all been solid.
I have an ROG 4K Monitor that doesn't perform to spec. Has a whining fan. Really bummed about the performance of it.
I almost bought an Asus mobo for the new build im working on, but opted for an msi instead. Miss me with that shit.
Good for you, Jay.  Thank you.
I never expected someone, much less Jay, to ditch Asus in favor of ASRock. That says pretty much everything you need to know about how serious this AM5 motherboard issue is.
Im wondering why Newegg only has Asus X670E itx motherboards appearing when you do a search for these boards. I dropped the  $400+ for the X670E-I WIFI Gaming, so now I will have to decide whether to stick with it and pray it doesn't blow up on me or spring for a competitor's itx motherboard. It's too late to ask for a RMA or a refund, I got the board shortly after it become available for purchase. I've clocked a lot of hours on the board and expo I seems to be working. This will probably be the last Asus product I ever spend any money on. I will be looking for a replacement in the near future.
This is why I watch your channel. Real honesty.
Bookmark this video! If anyone says Jay is a sell out, direct them to this video. Dropping a sponsor say a lot both to the brand and the people buying.
I kinda like asis tho ._.
Man with evga gone, my next "go to" WAS asus.......not anymore.
I had to RMA 3 Asus Laptops for quality problems a year ago: Always-on pixels on display, display frame coming off and trackpad not glued properly and coming off (!). I even got banned from the retailer for doing this as they believed I was over-exaggerating. Not ok on a 2000$ laptop.
Thanks for saving me money. I was going to spend a thousand. Now I’m saving it.
I remember the days Asus was pretty much *the* brand for high quality parts. Sad to see them fall like this.
🎤💧
ASUS boards are typically more expensive than everyone else's IMHO.  ASUS will likely need to drop their prices thanks to their drop in reputation, and may be seen as a budget brand until they can get their 💩 together.
huge respect for you to stand by your word. you could just not make a video and take their money for sponsorship, but no. you decide that enough is enough, and you called them out on their BS. i have a huge amount of respect for you for prioritizing standards over profit. it shows me that you understand the average consumer and you will stand with us through thick and thin. despite having 3.88M subs, you really should be getting so many more views than you are getting currently.
Riding the cancel culture train lol. Grouping AMD and Intel MBs as all day is stupid. If you actually used ASUS Intel motherboards, you would know this isn't a problem. You really think ASUS is the reason why the MBs are melting CPUs, your an idiot. ASUS uses AMD recommendations. Its generally a copy/paste from the engineering team for voltages. Also PBO OC has never been covered by warranty EVER. Well Jay is about to loss some $$$$$.
If I  upgrade my BIOS I constantly get crashes... ASUS is fuct now days.
EVGA, there's a slot. Now it's your chance, save us !
Yeah, Power Color done me the same way over a card they had problems with, gave me a black box card, had me called them , so there wouldn't be any written documents of transaction.  So I've bought 4 GPU's since, and fixing to buy a 7900xt to replace my main pc GPU. I'll be going to MSI, XFX, or Sapphire from now on.  Had Asus Mobo problem, but just gave up on RMA'ing it, and just bought a MSI.  I will only get burned once,  I'll just switch brands.  When I rocked Nvidia products it was EVGA only,  now that they're gone I would only trust MSI.  Asus and Power Color can kiss my A**!
Would be a shame if ASUS has something big to launch in a month or so
Asus is a huge PC company (Motherboards, GPUs) thats a big blow to consumers. I for one, wont be buying anymore Asus PC parts
AMEN Jay!!!  Way to stand by your guns and fire a sponsor. You did what you had to do --- and I will always be a sub of this channel.
They use to have amazing customer service and support. They refused to warranty my 2080 that hasn’t been released long enough to have the warranty not be valid. Also claimed CID on a port that was never used. The replacement was quoted at $1200 for a referb
I've been a MSI guy for a few years and no they're not perfect either but they have never treated me any where near this bad. AMD or Intel Mobos.  i'm getting ready to upgrade my system again. Sticking with MSI.     😎
Theres seem to be a growing trend regarding tech gaming companies and chinese manufacturers and it seems to be that they just dont give a shit about quality assurance as long as you buy their products. The gaming community needs a 1on1 talk amongst yourselves if this hobby is worth losing time and money for because these assholes are benefiting from the fallout.
This makes perfect sense as I have been exclusively using all ROG products in my latest system build 2 years ago and this is the PC where I have had nothing but issues from the MOBO and USB, MOBO just not even Identifying the CPU, GPU issues with only some games, and more.... thanks Jay I am now blackbanning ASUS and buying a new system when I can afford to remortgage the house to buy parts!
Asus was pretty impressed with helping me with my first build last Christmas. I worked with them over Facebook messager even during odd hours. I'm not defending anything that you're reporting. I  really trust your channel. I'm just sharing my experience as well. I have been a fan of Asus since they started branding there own components and producing there own branded computers. I really hope they get back on track and get back to there original quality.
I just built my new pc with the 7800X3D on a ASRock X670E Pro RS board. I wanted avoid any issues, so I didn't pick Asus board this time. I haven't experience any issues with the ASRock board with the 7800X3D.
I guess asus is like apple. Entusiast will still drool over it. If it is expensive it must be very good way of thinking
"keep your stuff" haha
I recently build a new PC last month and I'm really glad that I watch your videos because I was going for an ASUS monos, but instead I got a gigabyte!
I love the fact when you talk about your stream and start to show it sayin as soon as I went live this happened! and I get an ad 😂
exactly I have several Asus motherboards, Extreme Glacial, Crosshair and Maximus that thank God not having this problem, two are Intel 13th gen and one Amd 7950, but after this hit the air I switch to MSI.
This reminds me of when HP switched to non led solder and it would get brittle and fall off the board, I had a less than a year old laptop fail due to it. When I called customer service they suggested opening the laptop myself when I said won't that violate the warranty they said yes. They will never get a penny from me.
Ya, such a shame. I put Asus MB's and GPU's in a bunch of systems for people, always considered them rock solid while MSI and everyone else was screwing up and getting into trouble ... and here Asus goes, f'in up all over the place.  Whats a person to do?  Still cant go MSI, maybe its time to look up Asrock stuff.
I would think that AMD should be concerned with their brand equity because this ASUS issue directly affects AMD and makes them look bad as well.
asus suck
You use MSI with the BS scalping shit they did though? suspect.
this sucks because asus has been my go to for mobos :(
came here thinking that was a ROG Allly .... uhmmmmmm..... I am... Fvcked ..hahahahah... welp.. Back To my steam deck i go
Im glad you made this video. Im planning my next build and Asus was in my pcparts picker.  Maybe this will be like eating at a place that was closed for a health violation after they open again, but i doubt it.
I am also done with Asus.  Been having nothing but issues with their z690i board and their support is the most useless group I have experienced.  So frustrating wasting $$
I could care less about brand loyalty. Unfortunately, I will run an Asus board because the Apex is the best Z790 board when it comes to raw performance. I just buy the best board available. MSI was showing promise last gen but sh*t the bed hard with their Z790 boards. Gigabyte's bios stops me from even humoring them. Hopefully other brands step it up, we shall see.
Bravo, sir (as I'm looking at my Strix Gaming G Z690 :\ hope it doesn't s*** out on me)
I was considering switching to asus when I go to update my aorus hardware, but given what you’ve dealt with as far as rma process I think I’ll just stick with aorus or msi when I upgrade
My how the tables have turned between ASRock and Asus.
Damn and I just preordered an ROG Ally.
It will be interesting if ASUS does talk to you. Love to hear what ASUS has to say for themselves. Great videos I am not a tech guy at all and I watch you alol the time and find myself challenging myself to build my fist pc when prices are more resonable lol.
I stopped using Asus personally and within our company after they went insane on pricing with the  launch of  z390 ROG Maximus XI boards and went up ever revision since.
Was shopping between the new Asus handheld, steam deck and oled Switch. Now I'm down to a steam deck and oled switch. Prolly going switch just for some titles I can't get on pc.
I wish this happened sooner for Asus. They've had many years of free reign to rip people off of RMA.
I running a ASUS ROG Strix x670e-a board it works well. I went to it after my gigabyte board would just randomly power on. I am running 7950x cpu in. Seem to working actually very nicely. However if they keep sending you bad boards that problem. Don't disagree with Steve video or you video about.
I can guarantee I won't be buying an Asus product ever again, traded an Asus 30series for a gigabyte 40 series it's nice not having malware software
13:19 - Missed opportunity for "has been solid AsRock".
*IN 2023*, Asus replaced my defective 2021 Apex with another 2021 Apex.  Neither one could do the 6600XMP on the QVL.  $800 board that barely does jdecs max rated speed.
This is the exact reason I watch JazTwoCents.  Straight up honesty and integrity to the viewer!
At this point hiring Dylan Mulvaney would be an improvement for ASUS, as that's how much they are screwing up.
@JayzTwoCents Are you selling the Asus motherboards??😂 Seriously 😳
You can send me all the Asus stuff u dont want or anything they send u from now on...
I wish EVGA was making AM5 motherboards, probably be the best on the market right now
Sounds like htey are making the consumer the beta tester.
Who was the first company u fired
Kinda like "Kimetsu no Yaiba: Computer Age Manufacturer Madness Arc". 😆
i stopped buying them a few years ago. been using asrock, gigabyte, and msi in the last 3 builds this year. thanks for always keeping it real Jay!
Ive got some older ASUS stuff. Definitely wont buy their stuff next upgrade.
It’s sad because I love ASUS products but man they are out of minds being anti consumer. 4:22
Is there a clean company out there?
Back in the dinosaur days of PC building (late 90s and early 2000s) Asus was generally a "gold standard" company, particularly with motherboards that performed well, were reliable, and with a very low out of the box failure rate.  I built systems for myself and for friends, the P4 and P5 series were generally good products.  Fast forward a decade or more, and I had a bunch of Asus stuff still working.  Then I bought a router / wireless (a maybe a 66u, I think it was) and it was trash.  Poor signal, horrible firmware, bugs galore, drop outs, you name it, it did it.   It was a disaster or epic proportions.   A couple of motherboard failures later, and I ended up replacing with MSI, who's AMD boards seem to work pretty well without major fireworks.    I recently had to replace the motherboard in my son's older AMD build because of an odd boot failure, and the only board I could get readily local market was an ASUS board.   It's working out okay, but it's not all that I would want it to be either.  Firmware will always be their failure point, that is for sure.   I am hoping it lasts out a couple of more years until next gen stuff is out and I can move him up properly.
I wonder how this bodes for their new ROG Ally devices. Will they actually support it? Will we hear about exploding Allies? Will there be nightmare RMA stories?
Really annoyed I went full ASUS for my AM5 build. I'm lucky that I only had my 7950X3D for two weeks before voltage limiting UEFI came out, but its still frustrating, especially after my 4090 Strix had to be RMA'd because the card would crash going into lower power states.
I ran a computer company from 1996-2006 before selling it and moving on. During that time, ASUS was the flagship and go-to brand we sold. Even years later it was still my top choice - until about 2 years ago. It was obvious then that their quality control was quickly declining. I had 5 (yes, 5!) defective ASUS monitors in a row - multiple dead pixels and display issues. I had a $1000 TRX40 board that died 1 week after use... and more. I gave up on them as a trustable brand. My Threadripper PRO system I recently built was an ASRock WRX80 Creator, and it's been perfect.
Such a bummer, I’ve always like asus products, I have the prime x570 and two laptops from them. But after these shitty moves I will definitely avoid them, probably indefinitely.
i bought an ROG rig from an estate sale. it crashes all the time for no reason. been trying to fix it since. nice ass headphones don't work because the program doesn't jive with the audio routing let alone DAW's.
Damn, what a dire warning Jay gave ASUS here.  "We have seen bigger brands than you fail because of the arrogance that exists at that level."  Here's to hoping corporate heads that are behind this kind of nonsense roll away and never touch gaming hardware again. Chances aren't great.
Asus lost me a long time ago. Now its either MSI or AsRock, as the last Gigabyte Board literally fell apart by lifting it out of the Box (chipset cooler broke off, like wtf). Gigabyte may build nice Boards too, but i just dont trust them anymore. Not as long as you have a choice.
Damn .....Asus was always my first choice. Not anymore
Haters gonna hate. As steve said "Its for those who dare"
I swear, I was about to spend 2k just on MB, CPU and memory, from Asus of course, it was my first bet, now I'm done!, thank you for the head up Jay!!!
I had the same issue with the Zenith Extreme II MB. It was leaking fluid from a capacitor. They said it was my fault, CID(Customer induced damage) without even looking at it. Which it wasn't. When they did replace it they said it was a bent cpu pin which was BS. They didn't even mention the leaking. I went through 7 customer service reps. It took around 3 months to finally get a replacement. Pattie from Asus was really friendly and I felt bad. The RMA replacement, was in horrible shape.  I sent it back and they sent another one. This one was missing the M.2 screws and the thermal pads were all used. But it works. They really lost my trust. I've been building with them for over 20 years. So sad.
wow... i can't believe it. i've been an ASUS customer for 20 years... my Mobo, 2 monitors im looking at right now... i feel dirty
Thank you for this info !! Not buying again until they fix their shit
as long their factory is still in China at the moment, it is just going to be worth, the situation there is pretty bad. I don't think their local management can do much.
Time to boycott just like we did with the beer 😎
wtf happened?? comon asus
Not only Asrock, great board the Taichi. My MSI Ace x670 has been rock solid too,  with a 1.15V soc voltage I can run 6000C30 ram and a 7950x3d. Not a single crash in a month, I also have PBO -15 all cores and fclk at 2133mhz. Glad I dind't go Asus. On MSI board if you set 1.15V soc it means 1.15-1.16V real. Watching Steve videos we can see Asus pumping way more volts than the value in bios. Even with the patched bios limiting at 1.3,  the real value I think is more likely closer to 1.4V XD Finger crossed,  after all the Steve analysis Im not 100% convinced a 1.4-1.5V can burn a cpu in such a catastrophic way.
Let’s get to the real deal here… what do I buy to sync up all my RGB now?
Awesome content!
Too bad ASRock's parent company is Pegatron, the same as ASUS
Man.. and I love Asus. I have bought more Asus over the last 10 years than any other brand. Damn.
what is everyone's thoughts on Gigabyte, especially for their laptops?
I'm building 3 AM4 machines with ASUS parts right now. I'm not going to switch, but damn this sucks and in future I will make different choices.
The ROG B550 WIFI Gaming Strix broke my GPU and RAM in less than a year. Idk if my CPU is also affected, I'm buying another board, hopefully it works
This is why I love these guys. They drop-kicked Nord VPN when they lied about a data breach. And now they've drop-kicked ASUS for slithering away from their responsibility towards good customers.  Rock on JAYZ2CENTS & GamersNexus 👏😎
Bold move, AND I LIKE IT. Keep corporate snakes on a short leash.
Man, respect for that Jay
I think for me, ASRock has the most simple motherboard bios ever. I just had an asus a320 fail yesterday and my x570 asus is not my favourite board, it’s just really weird. Thinking of switching to ASRock  Here’s what’s happening.  Asus x570i strix  Blue screens about once a month.  It locks up sometimes, and usbs drop out.  Msi boards have been good too
Boycott ROG ALLY
Kudos and thank you, sir.
I used to love Asus as a brand and their products.  But in the last couple years I've had 2 high end WQHD IPS gaming monitors from them both have issues out-of-the-box.  1, ok everyone has a bad item once, gave a second one a try over a year later and that one also has issues.  I'm done with Asus for the foreseeable future.  They have to prove their worth my money and trust before I'll give them another shot.
i also wonder where the 1000s of Tuff x570 boards that are refurb / open box that is on sale on amazon and ebay... 1000s  the audio problem he has i have on the x570 tuff plus wifi ... it sucks!   my z370 8700k system i changed out to Asrock too thats funny   just think win 12 is coming next year and Microsoft hasn't even fixed 11   time to stop saying XMP is OC when the company shows performance from the XMP settings
Thanks!
any asus x570 motherboards going spare?
I trust ASUS about as much as Ngreedia.
Shame, I really like ASUS.  It is too bad their corporate governance is so terrible.  Sounds like upper level execs need to be replaced.
Asus USED to be good. My old P9 X79-E WS is still going strong.
Well yea, microsoft havent cared about end users for over 10 years but no one seems to care about that, if you stand by what you say then put a hammer through all those motherboards.
Asus offered to fly out to GN headquarters to talk about this to Steve and his team. When Steve said they would record the whole conversation, Asus never responded.
this is why mba's should not be allowed to run companies and stick to admin.
Yeah, I've always favored ASUS and had some good mobos in the past. Got burned with Gigabyte in at least one board and kinda stayed away from them. I have build 2 systems a few years back, one Intel and one AMD, cheaper stuff, no RoG bells and whistles or whatever and it seems they were worth their price, but when I need to build a new system to anyone I'll stay completely away from ASUS, since they're behaving like some con artists'shitshow and they can't be trusted to make good products or give basic support. Even if someone guarantees a specific product, I'm not touching their crap on a matter of principles.
guess i need to change brand on my next build
This really hurts man. I’m still rocking my asus crosshair v formula z board. 12 years later and no blue screen ever. No errors ever. I know it’s bulldozer platform lol. But damn this really hurts bout asus. I have no idea what my next build brand will be now. I have some research to do. Damn this hurts. Every build I’ve done has always been asus branded. Hurts
i built my newest computer with an asus board and a 7900x3d and its been fucking awful. blue screens, errors, inconsistent ram performance, etc. simply a terrible experience that i havent had with another manufacturer, but this is my second issue with an asus mobo build.
I don't know if it's intentional or not but i bought Asus B650E board a week ago and i can not register the board on Asus website. Do you think they doing this on purpus to stop people from RMA their boards!!??
Funny how this shit comes to light when I am about a month away from building a new machine.  Was going to get an Asus Maximus Z790 board.  Now granted all this hubub is with the AMD motherboards, but not sure if I wanna take the gamble and have the same stuff happen over on the intel side.  And MSI, which is supposedly the next best thing, has their fair share of garbage behind the scenes as well. At this point who do you go for?
I am so proud of you Jay for doing this. I have been subscribed for a few years now and wish I could subscribe twice! (Well, I could create another account...or 10, lol). Guess I will do a "thanks" instead!
If Jay doesn't end his video with a fart sound and "subscribe" then you know its serious
Well damn!
I have a X670E-I and has been nothing but hot garbage 🗑️, I'm on bios 0822 because every bios since then crashes my expo , new bios comes out I update , enable expo ,does not post revert back to 0822 and has been this way
The random usb disconnects of usb devices are likely partly to blame on usb hubs. Unfortunately some manufacturers use usb 3.2 hubs for the back io instead of using the actual usb 3.2 ports that are integrated into the chipset. Msi for example does this. They use one or two 10gbit ports from the chipset and then use a four port hub for the back io. That is so stupid and reduces reliability, increases power consumption, latency and causing potential connection problems. USB 3 is much more vulnerable to inteference.
I regret buying the PG42UQ from Asus. They haven't released a new firmware since late November and even on the newest version this thing still has wake-up issues and Asus just doesn't give a shit about fixing it.
Now I have another reason not to buy any Asus products, aside from not being able to afford them.
Yeah, I had to drop Asus about 2 years ago.  Their warranty support is  a joke.  Don't get me wrong, I've had good luck with their boards, but if I'm gonna drop 400-500 dollars on a MB, I expect the company who made it to stand behind it.
I'm not even on the BETA bios. I'm on the previous one that's a full release and it still has Voltage hitting up 1.380. Not even under 1.30
Shall we line up down in Tustin again for some cheap Asus extra warez?
i myself  have an asrock z790  taichi carrara, the white board , u would of liked, but its dead. on that note, as i was trying to put the cpu guard back , it slipped onto the pins. 1 pin broke. =( i want another board lol  its a beautiful board. im hoping for a RMA. coz board is dead , but their going on the one pin thing , grrrr
I built my rig about 6 months ago with an ROG strix board. It absolutely refused to allow me to update the bios to run a 5000 series processor. Their support was useless, the RMA process would of taken weeks which I did not have so I returned it and went with an MSI board. Good riddance ASUS.
Ive used to know 2 things asus and evga was always great experience. Well this changes today
I guess the end of AM4 is the end of my Asus mobo streak, as well.  2012-2023 RIP.
I bought a NEW rog x570-e gaming wifi ii and found my motherboard rgb to be blueish, no matter the  color. ie.. yellow is green ... white is blue and so on. Curious, I ask their support if it was normal. They told me to Rma the board because it was under warranty still , after seeing the pictures I sent. So two weeks later I get a REFURBISHED board with the same "problem". Wasted my time. I feel like I wasted my money. I basically bought a refurbished board for the price of a new one plus shipping for rma.
The true irony is that if these companies supported the consumers they would get more money lol
Vietnam factory for US boards is absolutely a nightmare for QC.  If you buy ASUS mobos, make sure the board is from their Chinese factory.
damn this sucks built my ASUS ROG PC 7 years ago now its been kicking ass still 1080 ti with maximus ix mobo. also got their AIO and its been a killer pc havn't even felt the need to upgrade yet. and just recommended asus rog to my friend 2 months ago for his new build. damn hopefully they shape up by the time i need a new pc.
If somebody would step up and release boards to compete with the ProArt line, something else but Asus would certainly be an option in the future. Without invalidating any other claims, my few experiences with Asus have been great so far, including a recent RMA.
This explains Why I've been having issues with my 3 week old ASUS ROG Strix Z790-F Gaming. Damn....
NICE MAN
thank you for bringing this out to light for the community
I really like asus cause they were doing some good products. Sucks how they shit on themselves. I got multiple asus stuff right now, so im stuck hope nothing breaks lol, no motherboard though. MSI thank God
I agree with not buying Asus anymore... but now who's the runner up? MSI are a bunch of cry babies, Gigabyte are far worse than Asus, and I know nothing at all about AsRock. So do I just risk it with AsRock for a while? Cuz I have a few PCs I need to build for some clients of mine and I need to know what's good for them. Also, I've been having problems with Asus boards going back all the way to B350, B450 and B550. Problems have always been random hit or miss, and their support has always been hit or miss as well, which is why it's so easy for me to give up on them completely.
Bought rog laptop couple yrs ago. Died one night. Went to sleep, turns on but never booted up. After tech support told me it was most likely gpu or motherboard. I asked to send it back while in warranty period. They said the period just expired after telling them I bought it a lil under a yr ago. They said no... It counts from the time the seller bought it, Before it was sold to you. That was the very last asus product I will every buy. Didnt even last a yr
5 bucks says ASUS will be back on the channel before the end of the month
At this rate I'm going to have to buy MSI boards and I FUCKING HATE MSI and their shitty bios interface. It's getting real shit building pcs when all these companies keep releasing literal bombs as products.
Class action will fix the voiding of the warranty. ASUS is stupid to think the courts will somehow not see it for what it is. I had 5 ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme with damaged pins off the shelf from MicroCenter 4 were sealed boxes. We opened the last one in the store opened the next one and it was clean. But ASUS kept telling me I was full of chit that it wasn't possible that I got new boards with bent pins
1.41v stock! SEND IT! -cries-
Stopped using Asus since the X58 boards because their support was terrible and I got sent 3 boards that were broken. I've switched to using Aorus and MSI and I've had nothing but good things to say with either of them.
Back in the early - mid 2000s, I was building towers for myself and co-workers and I distinctly remember there was a general 'stay the hell away from ASUS' advice from other people in tech. Overheating was the deal at the time, if I remember, and honestly that stuck in the back of my lil brain for years. Even when people were recommending their stuff, that little 'ooh, but have they *really* changed?' remained. So I'm not surprised.   I am happily surprised that you and others in the industry are calling them out for currently failing standards. It's nice to see people try to hold these companies responsible, as much as possible. Thank you for that.
It's such a shame, I absolutely have loved the aesthetic that Asus boards bring to the table. But they use to be reliable and if that is going out the window then I will no longer purchase their products.
Funny you mention the grey/white motherboard with the bent pins and Newegg in trouble for reselling RMAs,  was building a system for my brother in law (last one I built for any family member mind you) and got a board with a bunch of bent pins, and I was like ok.. I'm sending it back, and Newegg denied my RMA request saying the damage was my fault.  The long and short of it I bitched up an ever loving storm and vowed to never use them for purchases again (which lets be honest I wasn't like I built new system every generation, or hell every other generation) but eventually they relented and refunded my money.
This is the kind of "cancel culture" we need more of.
Nice.
I ain't proud. If you have a x670E Hero you want to throw my way, I'm willing to take my chances and roll the dice.
Thanks for standing up to these large corporations that forget about the customers that spend their hard earned money on garbage products.
Dang that Newegg stuff hits different 😔
You know, back in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Taiwan was the butt of the joke that everything made there was junk.  It took them a long time to come this far to actually be trustworthy in product quality.  Seems like they've taken a play from China's playbook to cut corners and quality, and is well on its way to becoming the butt of that old joke again.
Asus I was going to allow you for easier to boot with  But you are doing with motherboards is wrong. I had dealt with MSI motherboard with legacy bios and made for cyberpowerpc. I might go to ASRock or Gigabyte.
My dumbass that bought a r9 7900x with a tuf gaming 670x board 🫡
Have loved ROG for years but have also noticed the decline in QC.
I hate the word "consumer" it makes it sound gluttonous, it should be "customer"
ASUS needs to go back to being Rock Solid and Heart Touching.
Bad hardware, Huge price.
I hope more channels do this
Asus+Newegg = death of the hobby
so in other words...................... ASUS your F***ING Trash, your FIRED!!!
I have had issues wit my asus board z690 plus wifi d4. I would love if you could test it for me to confirm that the issue is with the board and not user error or the hardware connecting to it. (Pd firmware or drivers)
Wow this ASUS situation really has gone from zero to 100 real quick. PR nightmare.
I cant run my 4000mhz 32GB RAM kit in my Asus z490 motherboard. I get restarts. It does not happen with my 3466MHZ 16GB kit.
Ouch, I have a Hero 670e with a standard 7950x. No issues thus far but I'm now a little concerned.
I've personally moved entirely to ASRock since Asus boards were almost twice as much. No issues here even on Intel.
Funny only a short time ago i asked myself why does Asus still has such a good reputation. They just screwed me on every of my last purchases in some way. 3090 Strix blown mosfet and coilwhine from hell. 4090 strix coilwhine. z790 apex bend like a banana and stability issues down to some issues on the dim.2 port. cashback deals where the cashback wont be paid if you are not asking actively for it several times till they pay out. Asus lost me after buying their stuff for like over 30 years starting with a eisa 486.
Seems like every company has these woke bafoons making these big decisions and not just components it's food company's gaming company's coughcough budlight coughcough. Get these idiots out of your company's so we can get back to normal.
Glad to hear u do this. Sub to this man
I agree.  My Asus build has been garbage for 3 years.  I can't even survive a reboot without having to flash the bios again.
Cutting any sponsor that significantly contributes to your brand/channel is a HUGE leap forward! It is a very tough decision, but it also sends the message to your viewers that you care more about the average consumer than money. It's a breath of fresh air that there are still people out there that care about more than just themselves.
Hey, Jay uses the same overlays as me for Twitch streaming... Great minds think alike! Also, good on you Jay for standing up against a major corporation, it seems most content creators want the money and don't care about corporate ethics.
Im a ASUS/ROG customer. I have actually bought and endorsed to friends. I have has great experiences with them but today I'm reconsidering  my buying decisions with them.  My Crosshair X670E is probably my  last ASUS/ROG purchase.  GN Steve doesn't lie. So ASUS my love affair with you is over and early adoption with you is over. My AM5  system is something I was planning for 2 1/2 years to build. Now I have regrets! 😅 Thanks ASUS
i've been on the gigabyte train for literal decades, but none of these companies are perfect and i actually do hope that asus can make a comeback.
just what i like to hear as I have just got a new Asus motherboard.
Imagine when the bios showed up and you downloaded it from the official site and it melts a expensive cpu and they said basically "that's rough bro good looking out" then try to slide the blame on US ON US for downloading something that says fix from the legit site that they put out for us WHERE'S THE LOGIC for something *premium* they act like sketchy dealers when its time to fix stuff imagine ASROCK ASROCK has been better this year that's CRAZY
I've always been a MSI user for pretty much any GPU or motherboard, the handful of times i've had my own or dealt with Asus boards or GPU's there's always been quality problems, or very short-lived products and the support is just atrocious.  Had 2 generations of Asus laptops too, and man that was the biggest regrets i've ever made for tech purchases, 2 years into my asus zephyrus laptop i had to replace both fans, as 1 was grinding and the other just entirely quit. and the asus laptop before that i had to replace one of the fans and replace the touchpad.     Just absolute garbage quality, never again. my current Asus mouse will be my last ever Asus product.
trust me, do not follow Steve... Steve is the guy in school who causes trouble out of nothing just to cause drama and get popular. Probably you're following his footsteps because you didn't get an ROG Ally?
the day this starts ramping up to being an ASUS issue, is the same day i finally for a 4070 card, upgrading from a 1660ti, its an ASUS Dual, its so far working great, now im going to have to scrape and see if its liable to be a problem card in the near future. %&@#$@$!
Your 4 mil following, 4 mil potential costumers cares about this. Yiikes!   Good job Jay! ❤
Well I was an ROG fanboy but after my ramslot failure and the lack of support I will be changing my board when I can.
Thank you for maintaining your integrity and making this clear, honest, effective statement. Asus has demonstrated the risks of brand loyalty, I wish I could say I'm surprised. I used to recommend them to anybody in any price range, due to their reliability in my early 2000's build. This makes me wish EVGA would get into AMD and budget mobos. Looks like I'll go Asrock next???
NGL i was going to buy a ASUS board for a new build in a few weeks lol, guess it's back to shopping around for me.
I just upgraded to 13th gen from 6700k. Had ASUS/EVGA - went with them again. It scares me that after I built this higher end system with water cooling that I might have a board problem and will need to take it all apart. Worst part is that ASUS might simply slip with their warranty for "reasons" and I am out a ridiculously over priced mobo....
1st pc build and of course I went Amd with an asus x670-e........super pumped hahaha
Two ASRock B550 Steel Legend builds in my house. Micro for the wife and ATX for mine have been solid as well.  Looking to upgrade my friends build and debating on ASRock or MSI.  Have never had any problems with MSI boards either.
I bought a WRX80 Asus board a few weeks ago.. I hope I'm fine..
ASRock was garbage about 6 years ago. Now, they are very reliable over the past 2 years.
I wonder which brand will use this blood in the water to take up market share...
Every board I've ever had was Asus. My Sabertooth 990fx r2 has been rock solid since I got it 10 years ago! and it's still running!! So whoever was employed/in charge back then, can they please come back to Asus to put them back on track!!
Sucks to be me who only buy Asus then te more i hear the less i want to buy anything : /
Glad I didn't wanna spend the extra several hundred on Asus products on my new high tier build.
It is common for many Chinese companies to cover mistakes rather than admit them and make them right.
Well they're still the best option for PC parts compared to the rest....
I bought a few ASRock Server boards and they were absolute garbage, had to return most of them. I have had the least amount of issues with Gigabyte
I wanted to build an all ROG PC :(
My recent experiences with their mb's are why my z790 is a MSI, something I never thought I'd do.
I think asus has just shot themselves in the foot with this one.  I seriously doubt they can just void your warrenty by installing a bios especially one they released
I'm so glad this news broke before we began my kids build because a ASUS board and 7800x3d was the plan.  Good on being pro-consumer.  Been happy with the 2 MSI boards and LOVE the gigabyte board we have in the house now.
Jay I'm scared as fuck now!! 😭😭 I recently did a full ASUS build with a ROG Mobo, ROG 4090, and a 7950X3D!!! 😭😭  Edit: it was fucking expensive!!! (Also went with ASUS cus all white!). Thankfully haven't had any problems at all so far..
Only have built 2 pcs so far. I have only used asus, msi, Corsair, and g skill and nzxt. Can anyone tell me what the best brands are? Or at least the brands to stay away from.
I use to be diehard ASUS, but after 2 asus mother boards dying with in a few months of each other and stability issues with both of them for several months before they died it turned me off, now most of the pc's in my house are running AORUS gigabyte boards that have been rock solid, with one running an asrock board that has been rock solid as well.
bought a z790 maximus hero and it came with a bunch of bent fan pins, other than that the MB works amazing LOL. Didn't RMA it because I built my pc after having the parts for months.
Dam, this is kinna damming. Cause now they are releasing a new product and this doesn’t make people trust the brand. That being said, I am sad… I always was cool with their laptops 😕
Okay so... they ask you an extra kidney when buying their products compared to other brands and what you get is: A board that is prone to breaking, that you can prevent with a BIOS update that they make available for TESTING to their customers to get data on potential bugs, that voids your warranty on a product you paid a premium for?  Did I get that right ASUS?  I'm glad I didn't go with anything ASUS in my new system, went MSI all the way!
This will be one more JayzTwoCents follower no longer buying asus products. I had to go to Better Business Bureau several years ago to get them to replace my 2 week old laptop. Thanks Jay. I think this might hurt them more than we know.
What's a good motherboard manufacturer then is gigabyte any good
Asus and EVGA were my go tos. I have no idea what to do now
love you guys for this, fan for life
ok... now what am I suppose to do !!
This all feels oddly similar to my previous experiences with Razer, had an old Deathadder mouse from around 2007 that still works today, the 3 mice that I bought as upgrades (2 were warranty replacements via Amazon) all developed some fault or other within 6-12 months. Both seemed to get too successful and cut QA in search of ever increasing profit margins.
My 5 year old  $60 gigabyte motherboard has preformed better than a modern asus motherboad😂. Thats crazy
I was always hesitant to go with MSI and Asrock, but after going with MSI for n x570 board I was blown away by not only its rock solid stability and software support, but their customer support. I saw an asrock 6950XT for sale and took a gamble, by far the best experience ive had with radeon graphgics to date.e  Absolutely upset that ASUS has gone slowly down hill to the point where I had to sell my asus 10Gbps nic and my ASUS X570 board. The only thing asus that i still use is my 4 year old Pro art display which still hasnt given me any issues
Well said
and ASUS is gonna launch a new steam deck competitor soon called ROG Ally. i was kinda interested, not anymore
I don’t trust anymore… I brought laptop for my cousin the Wi-Fi card broke and battery lost charge because we were in two different continent shipping was bit expensive when got the laptop the warranty for over they did not do anything to help . They were blunt that they will not help and they gave me quote of $1500 to fix issues with laptop …
Thanks Jay
I have been a big fan of ASUS over the last couple of years. Before that it was MSI. There was the fire issue with MSI, now this with ASUS. Not sure where to go now.
They all suck anymore, it's all about quantity and not quality! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
EVGA anyone? Hopefully EVGA steps up on making good quality boards and make them avaialble globally..
I was a ASUS fanboy. Most of my stuffs are from ASUS; Monitor, motherboard, GPU, mouse, pc case, etc. After some terrible experience recently, no ASUS for my next build.
So A-sus is the Tech scene version of Bud Light? Minus Get woke go Broke. Well I guess the ROG ally wasn't a steam deck KIller at all.  It may sell Poorly due to people's reception of the company
Either asus has some sabotuer among them. Or they are just trying to scam people out of their money.
Guess who's the  lucky guy who just order and receive a Asus rog strix b760-f for my 13400? My first build is gonna be epic. Thanks you Jay for the warning.
Preach it brother aye jay has become one of my favorite YouTubers just as much as the hoonigans thanks for your content
CEO>QC. $*10^-2.
I am using a Asus Prime Z690-A and it runs rock solid it takes everything I throw at it no problems. Guess I am one of the lucky ones. Will use Asus Prime boards any day but I will only use Intel on them.
I miss you, EVGA.
Daam.... i wasn't expecting this
It’s such a shame, because so few board vendors make boards as rich as Asus boards. Nevertheless, none of that matters in light of everything they’re willing to screw you on. Here’s me throwing in the towel too, I’ve just had a horrible experience with their X570 Dark Hero that they won’t replace so no more Asus for me.
Thanks for standing up for us
ASUS Maximus
They are called "A SUS" for a reason Jay... Can't be trusted
Just bought a motherboard two days ago.  Really glad I went with the MSI now after leaning toward an ASUS for a while.
Asus Armoury Crate software killed my Trident Z Neo ram memory.
Damn.. Seems like Asus might get Bud Light'd.
i didnt take notes... but as i remember... this bullshit marketing all started up with the ROG "branding"  .... for gamers!  or in other words: look, other color, some led... so giff +30% for the uberness
I have been an MSI guy for years. They make some great boards and the BIOS is simple and easy to navigate and from what I have heard they make a lot of the best Intel boards especially for memory overclocking and recovering from bad settings.
What significant mgt changes took place at ASUS around 4 years ago. Find those people and throw them out.
Maaaaaad respect for this video
asus = best bios awful quality/awful mb layout msi = best mb layout (useable slots and ports I mean) awful bios, me sad buyer, I wanted to buy the asus oled monitor but...I know I'm going to bend over if I do so no thanks (my 800$ z690 rog extreme burned and ruined my entire year 2021 of gaming as it slowly degraded until it barely booted great customer experience)
I had exactly two ASUS products in my life; an 250€ Monitor and a GTX 1050 Ti, the Monitor died after 1 year, the GPU lost its Display-Port after 1,5 years of use. Since then I switched to MSI (GPU and MB wise) and never had issues again. ASUS seems to be heavily overrated and their products, compared to the competition, are heavily overpriced as well.
Bullet dodged. Just saw the Gamers Nexus video and now yours right before getting ready to do a system upgrade. Had an Asus board spec'd out but won't touch another thing with their name on it now.
I am going to have singularity computers build me a computer and I am going with a 7950x with a ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Extreme should i be worried
seems AM5 is just turning into a expensive joke. guess im sticking with my 5800x and 6700xt for awhile.
I have an ASUS 32" curved VA 2560 x 1440p Monitor, and I love it, but DANGIT, you make me wonder about ASUS and if I ever DO have an issue with it, as to what kind of treatment I'll get from ASUS. I can only hope this monitor, the only thing of my rig that is ASUS, lasts long enough for me to upgrade later to another brand. (sigh)
This is more of a US issue, here in Europe the laws are very strict, for example the Z690 Maximus situation was non existent here, all boards had proper QC been done.
"They want you to go away". I couldn't have said it better.
I trust Intel Dell and MSI I kinda loosing trust for Nvidia cuz of their prices
MSI BABY
Asus may not care you are fired from your chsnnel but I do care.   Another brand on my blacklist.
Glad I couldn’t afford an Asus board for my Ryzen 7600x. Fukn wow!!! Wonder how many of their Ally’s will fry themselves before too long.
so I see this video and Steve's video right after I buy an ASUS Z790 Apex...will have to check it out once received, but now I'm a little nervous.
ASUS used to be my go to brand for motherboards and graphics cards. I've even just bought an ASUS TUF F15 laptop because of the glowing review it received on this channel. It is working really well and I haven't had any issues with it except for Windows 11, but it is an RTX 2050 year model and the problems with ASUS stuff seems to have started over the last 12 months. After this last report, I'm going to choose a new manufacturer for my boards and GPUs in the future.
I have bought 4 monitors in the last 10 years and 3 were acer predators and 1 asus rog the predators have always been perfect, the rog had a green dead pixel. I kept it but shows asus has quality problems.
That was such a hard line.. “climb down the ladder now so the landing isn’t as hard” that caught me off guard from Jay. I’m glad to see the people that get free items/get paid by X company are standing up to complacency. I wish more people were like this. Thank you Jay, Nick, Phil, etc, for placing yourselves in the limelight to ensure the pc community isn’t taken advantage of anymore. Couldn’t be more proud.
I look forward to more MSI and ASROCK builds !
This video makes me even happier that I got the MSI board over the ASUS I almost did for my recent build.
13:53 OOOOF 🤣
In the 15 years I've built my personal PCs, Asus as always been a problem.   1st, overclocking my gpu would make me loose internet connection. This was so old I don't remember the series. Was my first build. 2nd, Sata controller died 1 year, so instead of like 10 sata ports i have 4 with 6 drives. 3rd, Sli Water cooled 980ti at 48c unable to overlook passed 100mhz offset, and ive checked the thermal pads/pasts countless times. They been out for me for a while. It's too bad I'm stuck with the dead sata controller and lemon GPUs.
Damn, and I just completed a build with a x570 TUF motherboard and a TUF 3090 OC...
Pretty sad when prices are going up since covid and places coming back online and factories up and running and now quality is sharply going downhill. I have some asus stuff and I'm thankful it doesn't have issues. I just know they used to be a big name and confident but not now. I was an EVGA person until I went to AMD and at the time they didn't make the x570 stuff
Pls stay AMD at home and try another board. After this Video MSI, Asrok or Gigabyte will take you with kisshands and even build you a custom board. Stay AMD and try it with other boards!
Cant use MSI due to their dodgy scalping "stuff". Cant use ASUS due to their dodgy AMD explosions.... Back to Intel and brand X then.
Covid tolerances strike again. Heading into a recession. Sky high coats, record profits?. Charging more for less.
Interesting to get video notifications the same day showing opposite sides of the coin for ASUS. Linus had a lot of high praise for their handheld today, Jay says he’s not going to let them sponsor his videos anymore. Crazy.
Thank you JayzTwoCents for taking a stand... I hope that your stand is enough for Asus to make a corporate 180 and to provide us consumers with a good product and support that we deserve.
Jay, thanks for this video. As you stated, I love the way the boards look. Just too bad they don't stand behind their product
this is why buying a rog ally is risky lol
Is someone going to tell him about the MSI news today?
Wow, I have been planning to build my first PC this year and was planning to pickup a Asus TUF X670E motherboard, time to find another option Huge respect to Jay for keeping it real despite the cost
I was about to buy a ROG phone now I'm doubting tbh. Asus is killing himself sadly
I would swap out your ASUS board with something else for your home rig, give that 7950X3D a fair shot
Well here’s hoping they don’t screw up the ally because I bought one. I guess I’m going to risk it 🤷‍♂️
Stuff like this is what makes you the  most down to earth tech tuber there is on YouTube. That's why people love you so much bro.
My issues with AM5 are starting to make sense. Stability, weird shit with NVME's that just felt wrong, inconsistent boot times. I wonder if MSI hare having these problems.
ASUS needs some Bud Light treatment. BOYCOTT. I don't think I am the only one is saying I am F-ING DONE with these PC companies in general. Their greed, their incompetence, their negligence. Everyone needs to agree NOT to buy anything for at least 12 months. Enough time to kill their profits and make them suffer. They need to learn WHO THE ACTUAL BOSS IS. The customer. We should be DEMANDING the sacking of many CEO's.
Boy do I feel dumb for buying an Asus board two weeks ago and immediately voiding the warranty.
i almost went with the hero but now im so glad i went with the msi ace wow just wow
Naturally my new computer came with an Asus mobo (their Strix 670E-E) and a 7950x3d.  I'm running on a beta BIOS they don't seem to have any real intention of updating any time soon, where I still had to MANUALLY change the voltage because their UPDATED BIOS was running the SoC voltage too high at 1.36V.  And then tried to void the warranty with their bad BIOS?  It's now manually set to 1.19V and I'm hopeful that the monitor is accurate and not overvolting.  For now, as I trust little to nothing, I'm power-limiting the board to 65 W.  Asus, try me.  Just try me.
Using ASRock for my 7800X3D. Updated the BIOS when the update dropped to be safe. It's been going great so far
I wonder what MSI board Jay has now. I ended up going with a MSI MPG X670E CARBON for my 7800X3D Build and love it!
sad that the Asus ally pre orders came out today. ah well looks like a lot of people will get to know Asus QC soon enough
Yet people pre-ordering the rog ally. The MC rep tried convincing to get an asus tuf mobo over the aorus mobo i had picked. I'm not sure what his intentions were, but there was a shelf full of tuf mobo returns.
Well said Jay. Asus needs to wind all this BS back and actually support its customers again. I certainly won't be buying any more of their products after this.
i have 2 asus components, a z690i strix motherboard and an azoth keyboard. both purchased used and sub 70% and 30% of retail cost respectively because I have always been of the opinion that warranty does not exist as a word in the vocabulary of asus or the process will be long and painful. the moment I consider the brand asus, I base the purchase on the inevitability that the warranty will not be honoured.
Damn, Jay on a rampage of calling out the BS. Keep up the amazing work!
At this point, we just waiting to see what's the next company that will disappoint us as they grow larger and we deposit more faith in them. PC has become so non user-friendly lately it seems. More choices but also more compromises we should have to make.
Please send them to us. Dont want it go to waste...
Yeah, Asrock was an eye opener this year. I built my wife a PC in a Hyte Revolt 3 and I used the Asrock Z790M ITX board. It turned out to be a real sweet build and has been solid as a rock. Asus who?
Asus will send Jay a complete pink top-of-the-line build for his daughter, then they will be the top recommendation.
Maan, this takes A LOT OF BALLS to do, well done Jay! To ditch such a huge company and talk about their wrongdoings, well done! I honestly dont understand modern ASUS at all, I am still rocking P8H61 R2.0 in my system paired with i5 3470 LOL, never had any issues with it, so seeing them fall down this much is ridiculous. P.S. If anyone wants to discard some ASUS B650 Tuf Gaming MB, I will gladly take it 🤣🤣I really need an upgrade, even if the warranty is voided 😅
Wow, huge kudos Guys. So proud of you standing up for us all. Love this channel so much, keep it up lads.
Thank you for informing us on this.  I've used and trusted ASUS for a very long time... like 25+ years... After seeing this, I will be using another motherboard brand for sure.  It's sad that currently I use a motherboard and videocard in my current rig that are ROG ASUS but... I've already talked about hating armory crate with a passion before and that will help me change.  MSI, you've always provided the free GPU overclocking tool so I guess your next on my list, plus the cool dragon logo is always nice.
Damn, this is going to make the Gigabyte boards I buy more expensive.
As someone who is effected by this nonsense, and maybe having done damage to my 7950x3d, thanks jay! Its great to feel your support, and it sucks the messaging we have all received from Asus, despite me spending a crazy amount of money on their product.
This makes me feel so good about not going with an Asus board for my recent rebuild. I really wanted to but I couldn't justify the cost. I'm glad I didn't shell out for a while z690 board and went with my gigabyte.
Let me tell you a true story that just happened, but could also be considered a fable (like Aesop's Fables). Our roommate was about to take the garbage out. There was a dead mouse in the bag. Nobody had put it there. We surmised that the mouse got too greedy and accidentally committed suicide. That is what ASUS is doing right now. Note: The mouse problem is a different story. However, we think we're down to one mouse that, for whatever reason, loves to eat bar soaps (it's eaten 3 of them).
I do not reccommend or buy ANY Products from ASUS.  The HW is good but it does not help when the CS is horrible and a joke, when you need help the Most.
it kinda amazing how they release a cool item like the rog ally just in time to be real shit
WOW, then who can we trust to buy from?
I have the ROG STRIX B650-A GAMING WIFI and my system constantly blue screens shortly after I turn on Memory context restore.  On occasion the sound is crackling which fixes itself after a reboot.  I'm not very happy with this.  I'm using a 7900 non x with precision boost overdrive on.
And this is why I'm concerned more on the quality an support of ASUS Rog Ally and I've used asus since am2 to am4.... they aren't the same company that they were back in the day
I remember a time when Asus meant slightly more expensive but reliable and feature rich... granted the customer service has always been slacking. These days, its like i shop around for the manufacturer that will screw me over the least.
He just Thermaltake'd Asus lol!
ya I know what you are saying... Asus bios for tuf B450 mother boards do not work with windows 11
bravo
Such a shame. I had to wash my hands of Gigabyte for not giving me good support back in 2017. Now after seeing this and seeing issues that a family member had with an ASUS mobo at the end of last year I think I might look for a new board maker when I start my next build. I currently have an ASUS board and it's been rock solid since 2019 but things change.
Fired or fried?😅
Steve did elude to still having to check out the other board makers...so maybe the problem will be more widespread?  Time will tell if it is just an ASUS issue...
Asus just had a  bad case of when keeping it real goes wrong.
its a real shame i liked asus boards :(
asus, if you are reading comments, i have asus monitors, motherboards, graphics cards, etc.  I won't be purchasing anything from your brand until you have re-proven yourselves in the industry. I have in the past, and will continue to, spend more to get from a brand i like, and that brand is no longer asus.
Covid funny enough had exposed the true nature of a lot of companies. Ofcourse we always knew it in the back of our minds, but now it's in your face obvious they don't even try to hide it anymore.
This really makes me think i have been a asus fanboy for a long time,mainly because i had 3 gigabyte boards in a row let me down in less than a month and i really like the look of the rog crosshair line but i have a brandnew x570e crosshair hero that i paid almost 500$ for still in the box waiting on the right case to find me for a build i been wanting to do for a while now with a rx 6950xt and an r9 5900x  and the return window is about to close i feel like i shouldn't even risk it at this point i should just send it back
Dang ... "snif snif" .... yep ... Massive code brown at Asus HQ!
Been saying this for years now, good on you jay and team ❤
Glad to see you do this Jay! I had experienced issues with my ROG board a couple years ago and after multiple RMA's and hassle I made the smart move and bought an MSI board.
Here's a story for you Jay.  4 years ago I sent in an X99 Rampage V Extreme with a few damage pins on the socket for replacement.  They were well aware of this prior to me sending it in, I took photos prior to sending it and I fitted the Foxconn cover when I packed it.  I received it back, with a big dirty thumbprint of crushed pins and they told me that it was damaged on arrival.  Ever since then, I have not touched an ASUS product and Corsair is heading down the same path with their lack of helping the consumer with issues.  I've sent you an email about that, hopefully you get it.
My Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero has had nothing but problems with ram stability. This is my 3rd board from RMA and just finally gave up and living with it crashing once a week or once a month whenever it decides to. I will not be using Asus from here on out until they can prove to the community that they care about their customers again.
For me it sort of started when they stuffed aura sync into armory crate. I hate that software. It comes with so much unneccesary crap and all I wanted was to change the color of my strix gpu.  Now this is pretty eye-opening and depressing, because to be honest, I've been an Asus fanboy to an extent. Maybe better explained would be; I prefered them over other brands. Now I'm like: What's next? What's going to break next time? This is just sh$t. Stuff like this just makes me question all my products / loose confidence in the parts that are from Asus. Now, my pc will probably not spontaneously catch on fire or explode (lol) but the afterthought is still there.  Also i wish they would fix their godamn motherboard driver downloads, half of them work (somewhat) and the other half DON'T.  For context: Last time I re-installed windows I wanted to do a (100% induced ocd) clean install with everything up tp date, that includes the somewhat outdated drivers and software on my cd that came with the motherboard (YES, A GODAMN CD XD) so I downloaded all the neccesary stuff from their website and like I said, only roughly half of them even worked, some needed roundabouts like using a batch file instead of the .exe file. The rest I had to let windows download. And I didn't even want to think about installing Armory crate for just the drivers!  Stuff like this drives me Nuts 😠
I dont think i'll ever trust Asus.  I never really did care for them.  I know i'll get laughed at here for this but MSI has been solid for me.  That's just been my experience.
I had always used ASUS for motherboards in the past. Then I realized I always had one ethernet connection go bad. I switched to ASRock for my last build.
got my asus maximus extreme z790 flawless . Soo intel is shit amd is shit asus is shit evga is gone . soo close the channel ?
None of the brands really care about consumers, all they care about is making a profit. But publicly stating that they don't give a fuck about consumers is next level!
Hell yes! Hats off to you Jay and friends!
I will fire them too of my wallet. THX
I remember the day when both channels announced evga departure from nvidia. Same amount of feeling today
I bought two x670 heros and now regret it.... I appreciate what you're doing Jay.......
Was between a x670e hero or a giga master. Glad I went with the master.
Man I miss Evga!!!!
Yeh I gave up on ASUS a few years back when I had 2 RMAs I had to do and the 3rd board had a few issues but were work-arounds.   Getting those RMAs done tho was a MASSIVE hassle....holy cow.   These days I'm rockin the ASRock Taichi, just like you.   Solid board, zero issues, easy BIOS, great layout and have been very happy with it!!
I’m so glad this is exploding. I’ve been having issues with my Asus x570 board for a few years and I’ve been troubleshooting every single thing and it has to be be board at this point. So God damn frustrating and the fact the boards are so expensive, they deserve all the negative press they can get. Cheers 🍻
it is not the Error itself, it is how it is Dealt with. Arctic and Fractal really led by example.  Both of them communicated well.  And stood by their warranties.
I have a ASUS ROG Strix Z490 with a 10900k in my main comp right now and it´s my last Asus product i will ever own!
I trust gigabyte
I have owned generations of Asus products. Laptops, monitors, motherboards, their phones. Yea, not anymore.
I got abought a laptop from them and it was bad. I only had it for 2 days. I rma it they said it was fixed and everything was a fresh install but i put a stickes on the keyboard screen and over 2 screws. Not one sticker was movers nor damaged. So asus held my new laptop for over 3 months without ever looking at it before sending it back to me. When i told the rep about this is when they wanted to give me a refurbished one and not a new one. I told them that was not going to work for me. In the end i had to call my bank and told them what happened and got my 1200.00 usd back. They i called asus and told then to keep it
aSUS
Jesus 2 min unskipable ad
Jesus 2 min unskipable ad
And asus has not updated their Wi-Fi routers in years.  Ax86u is still top one.  So I have tplink now which has a better UI and has 6E.
I'm glad I haven't started my build yet. I'm now looking into msi or asrock
Buh bye Asus!
Man, who is left for motherboards?  Gigabyte's rgb software is rickety in the best of times.  MSI got hacked and their uefi global key go shared onto the webs so their bios updates are sus.  Asus quality and service is in the pits..  Asrock and evga?  And sticking to itx because I like desk space takes evga out, who are more focused on eatx boards anyway.
Damn! Much respect!!!  Enough is enough!
To be fair I still can't run expo on my Gigabyte board either.
isn't asrock owned by asus? whats now the best budget motherboard for the 7800x3d?
I bought an ROG b550i - out of the box wifi is broken and the Bluetooth had constant disconnects. Besides that works great 😊. Love the post screen, but my next one probably won’t be an Asus. Love the branding though.
I have an Asrock GPU and Motherboard and it was a great bargain on both.
This is what happens when you focus on branding instead of making a superior product.
Running out of content that you need to borrow ideas from GamersNexus? 🙄
This is why I don't buy top shelf shit... It sends the wrong message to companies about what I need vs what should sell.
Jay, use your EVGA contacts to talk them into building a microATX B550 or X570 AM4 motherboard with onboard VGA Video and IPMI (KVM-type Server Management over LAN) for Home Lab/Home Server guys, or even DASH management (similar to IPMI, much cheaper as it's Realtek). If priced right, I bet they can sell a shit ton. There are a boat load of guys who would love to be able to use 3950x, 3900x, 5900x and 5950x CPUs on their Home Lab Servers, as the AMD CPUs/Chipsets already support Standard DDR4 as well as ECC Memory right out of the box.
I got 2 bad boards in the last 3 builds from Asus.    I was brand loyal but no more. There are plenty of good boards out there.
Great my motherboard is now super sus. 😢😢😢
So I came from a gigabyte motherboard and I loved it when I upgraded to the 5950X I decided to splurge and get the Asus strix board.  My PCI ejection lever on my motherboard is broken and I only ever tried to pull the graphics card out once.   This is really important to me because I literally use my computer as a test bench to make sure parts are working when I build computers for other people  So right now I literally can't test any parts without potentially ruining my board.  I still have that gigabyte board so I might actually put it back in  Honestly I think gigabyte might have the highest quality at least from the 5000 series era. I don't have the new AM5 7000 series yet.
Respect the decision Jay.
I just ordered 7800x3d  this week and was thinking of going maybe with an Asus MB, but with the issues you had with your crosshair hero and Gamers Nexus video from tuesday (haven't watched today's video yet where he goes after Asus) I went with the MSI Carbon wifi board instead. So Asus lost a sale with me.
This would be a hard hit for Asus loosing someone like Jaytwocent... I think any rewiever will follow his steps and send to hell Asus... Honestly i never liked Asus, too expensive and for me nothing special.
You have all those issues and you are a youtuber... imagine us... they don't give a @$#%? about us.... Samething as MSI... it's pathetic they are all @$#%?? compagnies
So no asus products moving forward in your videos? If so im on board. I just don't want to see lot of videos moving forward about how bad they are. I expect you to dump them and then not talk about them again.
never went with ASUS at all, had used PNY, EVGA, MSI, Corsair, and I'm gonna be using Sapphire in the future. so there's that.
I will be holding off on any future Asus purchases until they get their act together, and it is well documented. I have usually been a fan, but this has gone way too far.
F**k me! I bought my Asus Mobo and Ryzen 7900X a couple weeks ago and now this...   I trusted Asus, but now, seems like I can't trust them, anymore!
How the mighty have fallen..
Appreciate you being real with the community Jay
The problem you were having with the usb devices cutting out and turning off happed to me to With my z-690 board. I’m glad I’m not the only one I’m gonna contact them immediately.
This is the same path that Abit died on
I wish every other reviewer that has been through this and hasn't stepped up to let us know that Asus Mobo's are crap shame on you, props to you Jay. And by the way if you feel like donating that mobo with bent pins, I could definitely fix it, I've fixed worst one's.
Right on Brother!! Thank you for standing  by us your viewers.
bravo and THANK YOU
I wonder how many other commenters have said you ought to send those last 2 MBs to Steve from Gamers Nexus and see if Steve starts doing the Grinch's smile at the thought of doing another ASUS video?  🤣
Massive respect jay, glad to see asus getting called out for this
Armory Crate.  Garbage.
If ASUS is not going to "make good" their behaviour within a week, their DIY motherboard business is OVER. Some vendors think they are serving themselves rather than the customer. Hey, without your customers, you DIE!. Simple as that!.
Me looking at my x570i itx and tuf 3080ti
That is nuts and sad to see about Asus. Good on you for choosing the honorable path. An ever rarer commodity.
I left msi when they had that 16k rom debaucle years ago.
Mahalo Jay for your integrity and standing up to the corporate world that seems only interested in how much they can make off the backs of the consumer.
RIP ASUS 💀⚰️
Glad to have caught this vid now. I am up for a full build upgrade. Guess I am switching to Gigabyte.
Well I feel screwed. I just spent 2k on an Asus build 2 months ago.. :(  Bluetooth randomly stopped working since the last update and it's saying its not compatible with my motherboard B650E-F. I am pretty sure I have integrated Bluetooth and WIFI. I wonder if the update is part of the problem.
I bought a brand new z790 Asus and the pins were bent from the factory. Luckily I bought it at microcenter and they saw it too. The way they were bent wasn't from contact but bad manufacturing as they were twisted slightly. Got a new one that was good.
wow... I feel lucky now... my B550 has been solid even with overclocked 3600mhz ram with super tight timings cas14,trcd13,trp13,tras26  Only blue screens I ever have are when I am folding on my 6900xt with smart access memory enabled... now I'm thinking it might be ASUS fault and not the 6900xt drivers.
Thank you for voicing concern and dropping asus for us. I used to look at asus as a quality brand but with the recent stuff, I cant look at it like that. With everything happening as well, I'm wondering if the rog ally is a good product to buy, even know it checks most of the boxes I wanted in a gaming handheld. What are yalls thoughts/concerns with the new product?
wow and they had that handheld release stream today too... oof
My current motherboard is the last asus motherboard I will ever buy.
I have been having the same goxlr issues , stream deck and my mouse and keyboards randomly turn off then back. I have the z590 plus Wi-Fi board.
Props. I was curious if you’d go this far. Glad you did. Now I’m out $750 on a paperweight that freezes 3 times a day, to the point I have to power cycle the psu because the power/reset buttons (even the mb power) don’t respond.
I lost all trust in asus when my brand fucking new b450 motherboard started SPAMMING EVERY KEY ON THE KEYBOARD EVEN WHEN NO KEYBOARD WAS plugged in. it only happened when in windows and reinstalling it did not fix it and getting a new motherboard did fix the issue. Asus sucks ass. my new 7800x3d pc uses an asrock board which I SAW APPLIED THE CORRECT 1.3v
I've never had issues with asus boards and recently got one (just before this whole issue) and now I'm worried about the board I've got
Yeah! Fuck da ASUS!
I respect you and Steve so much for all this videos outing ASUS for their bullshit, and im currently using an Asus board with my 5800x3d... Well, thank you Jay!
I've never had anything but issues with asus products. I've also had negative experiences with gigabyte and asrock. The one company I've never had issues with is MSI. I had an asrock taichi that had all kinds of instability issues I bought my msi meg ace and have had 0 issues.
Good thing EVGA still makes motherboards....
Next build I'm switching to a full asrock build, their quality seems better than Asus as far as I'm concerned
When people are saying "glad i went with ASrock", you're doing it wrong!
I see possible lawsuits here. A class action suit if you will. ASUS should be sued here.
Linus is still simping on ASUS and their gaming deck "ROG Ally".... But seriously, people should have concerns with their product support moving forward. Asus has literally fuc*ed themselves.
Cancels my Mobo order, now I have to find a Z790 board with OLED that isn't ASUS
Been waiting 8 months to build my dream PC. I bought the 7950x3d,. Asus ROG crosshair x670e extreme, Asus ROG strix 4090 oc, Asus ROG ryujin 2 360 , rest parts are not Asus. And now I hear Asus is crap while I thought it was the top. Yey I can be depressed now🥲🥲
Not a good chapter for Asus but is it worth dumping them forever? I don't know how well other companies would handle this situation but my guess is not perfect and my guess is that Steve from GN and his team would be hard at work destroying their reputation.  Let's have a little tolerance guys and if all you reviewer's don't want any of the free hardware you got I'll take it.
thats why i switched from ASUS rog strix  to Gigabyte aorus.
I would like to point out that as an avid PC building enthusiast, motherboards are the reason that I haven't upgraded my CPU in 3 years. I'm still on the Z490 platform because (i) new motherboards are too expensive, and (ii) the stability is horrible. I'm fine with buying a super performant CPU, but I'm not dropping $500+ on a board that will lose support in 2 years.
This horse sh*t makes me really glad I am not using any ASUS components in my system. Basically telling consumers that they can either get a broken board with a warranty or a "not broken" board with no warranty for the same price...such horse sh*t.
Well, those audio issues explain my audio issues I guess? Gotta get rid of my z690 then I guess
I am waiting for reports of the ASUS ROG Ally exploding.
My new Asus Z790 Gaming Wifi-E board arrived with bent pins in February because the cpu cover wasn't installed correctly and was just bouncing around in the box hitting the pins. My replacement has been mostly fine but I have been having weird USB issues even after a BIOS update.
HEARTS.
I had an Asrock Fatality board back when the A10 APUs were new. Great board, machine worked well till I dropped the damn CPU during a repaste and bent pins.
This sucks, I have 5 Asus builds in my house with the latest being Z690.  This also includes an Asus GPU in each as well.  I wont be buying another Asus product again. Thank you Jay for standing up for us plebs.
I'll stick with Asus for now thanks.
It feels like everything is going to shit in a hand basked real fast.
boycott rog ally, that will fire your hands
shots fired! gg Jay
Thanks for the warning; I was planning on buying an Asus Rog Strix RTX4090 OC GPU and Asus Rog Strix Z790-E GAMING motherboard, but I won't now.  Jay, can I ask which RTX4090 and motherboard you would recommend for a no holds barred top of the range AMD 7950X3D CPU based ultimate 8K gaming system, which I plan to put into a full custom waterloop for all components?
14:00 Asrock has actually been better than Asus for well over 4 years now my dude.
Jay and co.. thank you for putting the consumer first .. and standing shoulder to shoulder with GamersNexus and others who try and represent the community. I hope this rattles Asus' cage and gets them to do better.. and serves as a message to other greedy corps that put profit over people.
i had so many problems with asus with monitors with motherboard with gpus that i never go back to it anymore im now steadly siting at gigabyte and never had any fail on me or do stupid shit
You are correct , it has been a steady decline. They always pumped too much Vcore and Vsoc into their mobos but they have gone crazy and just did not test or engineer the mobos correctly either.  I was done with Asus after I had 5 Intel mobos with a 6700k die in a year. I gave them another chance with an X570 but it died in under a year and been using Msi mobos since and touch wood all good so far.
i have had so many issues with ASUS that i refuse to use them.  I bought a Gaming Laptop from them and when it showed up it booted up for about 3 min and crashed and i had to send it back to them.  they had to replace fans. hard drive ram and something else.  but after a month i had not heard anything.  after calling every day and finally getting a supposed supervisor they admitted they could not find the laptop i supposedly sent them.  after another week they found it in an office.  apparently they replaced the parts and put it in there to "test" it and forgot about it or where it was for weeks.  I had purchased it to bring with me when i went overseas to work and they took around 7 months to send it to me fix it and send it back.  i got it 4 days before i left for Iraq.   No sorry no anything.  And that was only the first issue.  I was so mad.  and still am.
Hi guys, so a good alternative to an Asus ROG STRIX X670E-A GAMING WIFI ? Thanks for any advice.
Heck yeah,  bout time something was flat put on them,  no it might not matter to them now, but it will in the future
I emailed the EU and my country's customer protection agency about this.
My  current rig 8086k 1080ti Asus build new build will not be Asus
I hate this being an Asus fanboy but I appreciate the honesty from Jay.   Microcenter warranties are a must!
Jay, you shouldn't be sorry.  The situation is inexcusable.
wait sooo your gunna call out asus for there motherboard but not corsair for there vengance ram that litterally did not work out of the box for any of the amd chips and caused blue screen and hard crashes.???????????
Imagine selling computer parts and screwing with the pc builder youtubers who can destroy you in one video
Dont get me started on their RMA process.. back in 2021 I picked up a RoG strix 2080ti from Newegg, after a month it started showing artifacts, reached out to newegg, was passed the return window, reached out to ASUS and despite the fact I bought it new from newegg, they would not honor my warranty. Same thing happened with a X570 Strix board I picked up last year. a BIOS update bricked it (flashback wouldnt even function) sent it to ASUS, they sent it back saying it was unrepairable and my warranty was void despite the fact I didnt absolutely nothing to the board that would void it. and no I didnt use a the Beta BIOS.  One thing I learned about the RAM timings/speed is that Zen 4 doesnt like anything over 6000. some have got lucky with 6200, only the best silicone can do 6400, anything higher the infinity fabric just cant handle.
Don't go back to intel change the board and see if it change's anything seems unfair to throw AMD under the bus for no reason.
Gave up 5 years ago, now MSI all the way
why are motherboards so expensive? what the fuck does it even have in it to cost $1000 is it made out of pure gold WTF
Good time for EVGA to step it up! Done with Asus
Just sent my 3070 in for rma had my strix hero MB sent for rma twice...
yo Jay, how do u feel about gigabyte? I've been using their stuff for 8+ years and haven't had any issues. I've heard things about their earlier power supplies but I mean for mobo/gpu I've never been done wrong. I did own 1 asus x470 board and the cpu core voltage was regularly up at 1.45. Didnt keep that board for very long... lmao
Does anyone know if the B650 bios is the same issue??
Thankfully I have not had issues in the past but I have always seen ASUS as a reliable brand.  Seems like things have really gone downhill, or at least come to the forefront.  I have been running an X470 ROG Crosshair VII Hero for several years, through a CPU upgrade cycle, and currently have a Strix RTX 3080.  I will be seriously looking for other options for my next hardware upgrade.
The Asus bios has deteriorated considerably in the last 3 years, which is why I no longer buy a motherboard from Asus since the 9900 k. It was one of the easiest bios on the market, but the last year it looks like Asrock first year bios
I was already deliberately ignoring ASRock products for the last few years, entirely because they elected to ban and not sample [ hardware unboxed / gamers nexus / buildzoid ] due to reviews od their weaker products, pointing out their weaknesses.  If Asus chooses to start doling out hardware bans, instead of correcting this failure of process, blacklisting them from my shopping list may well be the easiest thing i ever do.
This is why I have a MacBookAir M2 and a Mac Mini M1. I don’t have to deal with all this crap. I don’t game much and Windows 11 is crap also.
I disagree. Bios revision 1303 was the one that implemented the “quick SoC voltage fix” - you don’t need to install 1410 to get it. You just need 1303, which is NOT a beta
what do you expect from companies from CHYNUH?  Nothing but RICER GARBAGE.
Asrock ftw Gigabyte is decent and Msi is King as always
Has anyone had any issues with the Asus Prime X570 Pro boards? Or is it just the AM5 platform boards?
I have been playing with PC's since Windows 95 and I have always preferred Asus products but lately I have noticed the quality has gone out the window. For me the last straw was the Z690 M board which didn't work out of the box so I exchanged the Asus board for an MSI in my latest build and its as solid as a rock. Asus no more.
another PC gaming L...the more time passes the more big brain EVGA looks. What a meme this is....
That “keep your stuff” sounded like a voiceover covering up “keep your s***” 😂😂
Never understood why tech tubers used ASUS's sponsored junk. They're overrated, overhyped and overpriced. Esp. their motherboards; absolute junk. Can't count how many client MOBO's i've RMA'd. Don't buy ASUS: they're shady, but more importantly, overpriced junk. Stick with MSI  Great job Jay! ASUS fucked around and are now finding out. Hope more major tech tube channels drop these tards as sponsors
Unfortunately I did  a build with an 670e hero motherboard recently amongst my previous 3 asus builds ,gotta look elsewhere in future
If ever we needed EVGA to save us it's now
I have been dealing with an rma issue since march 10th on my strix z790 d5. I paid to ship my board back just to get them to send it back, not fixed. I then requested and paid for an advanced replacement rma. They shipped me a prime z690 as a replacement.. wtf? I had to pay to ship it back. Now I'm waiting on my refund for the first advanced replacement so I can possibly pay again to get another advanced replacement..... now I am out $50+ in shipping. I have used asus for 20 yrs now. Granted, this is my first issue, but I am done with asus.
I have a asrock pg velocita x570 motherboard and absolutely love it. If i didn't need a stronger gaming pc i wouldn't be using my am4 board as a streaming pc. I loved the ability too utilize both wifi and ethernet for different things. Wifi for background updates as you use ethernet as your gaming
h/w enthusiast love some jays spit....  not me of course?   lol
Asus 1440p Monitors (vg27aq family) constantly cut out too with DP and rarely with HDMI.
Go gigabyte!
Asrock has been better than Asus for like six years or more now.
ASUS has become too big and arrogant for their own good. ASUS has turned into a company of arrogant morons who only cares about profits with no consideration to the customers.
been going on years that , all the way back too the A8N32-SLI i had what a nightmare 4 boards on that one had a wire linking traces on the back of the mb and tape covering it, went ballistic, I'm on and asus now i.e 490 but its first time since then only due too the nightmare of finding a solid mb also a recommend from people that went backwards on boards i.e 590 even 690
This is so sad, I've always prefered asus. 😭
Some days I mourn only being able to afford cheap, low-spec shit (Ryzen 5 3600, Gigabyte B450 AORUS M, RX 6400). Other days, I celebrate all the bullets I've been dodging lately. :P
I haven’t taken a ROG branded item serious in over a decade. It’s just a badge for up charging for useless addons and gimmicks for their products.
So, this is interesting considering the number of people who are all hyped about the ROG Ally haha. Gonna be more Asus garbage. I bought a motherboard from them, somehow during a routine NVME swap the leads connecting the port to the motherboard BROKE. Like literally snapped in half. They really do produce some garbage.
MSI <3
Last 2 builds one 4 months for my desktop. A new one 1 month ago for a future desktop. Both have been AMD with Gigabyte MB. My gaming pc is an ASUS / AMD working fine (so far).
Thanks! What a move!
Thank you for putting consumers before companies, I am pretty sure Asus paid well
Love that Asus is getting dragged like they should, but Gigabyte is literally doing the exact same thing and everyone is letting them away with it. In a post on r/Amd, a Redditor posted their interaction with Gigabyte customer support when the Redditor asked why they're removing BIOSes and Gigabyte support said "they are not supported and use at own risk." Asus at least half assed released a statement and put in one of the new BIOS descriptions "Old BIOSes were removed because x." Gigabyte has made ZERO statements explaining why they keep putting up BIOSes and taking them down. ZERO!!!! Idk if they're doing it cause there was a major bug, or if it's just policy to delete the old beta BIOS when a new beta BIOS comes out. WE HAVE NO IDEA!! There has also been reports in Amazon reviews of Gigabyte boards having bent pins out of the box  The post on Reddit is called "Gigabyte has removed the latest "safe" BIOS' from their X670 pages. CS says they are not supported and use at own risk."
Seems like amd is trying to blame everything on asus. Man, asus helped u amd so much and now u throw asus out of the bus. What a bich u are, amd😂
Don't give up on AMD quite yet. Put a different mobo in and prove who's at fault 😈
I've sold all my ASUS products and have told all of my customers I will not support ASUS products in my builds anymore.
Wow,  Jay not pulling any punches.
thank goodness I hadn't bought all the parts for my new build which was going to be mostly Asus, time to switch manufacturers.
At least it is still less worse than Russian poisoning... I guess..
I get the hate but I still like the look of there stuff and it all runs good for me. So I’ll still be using them. I get the hate though.
I actually stopped using a lot of their products back in 2016-2017. The last gaming laptop I bought from Asus had overheating issues and I sent it in and their RMA dept determined that their was no issues, but they sent me a refurbished one anyways and that one still overheats. There ended up being a class action lawsuit against them for this particular laptop
Hey guys off topic but i found a gtx 1080ti for $200 where i live, it looks pretty new and im considering buying it lol i have a 1070 fe. Should i go for it?
Better fire Asus than AMD 😂😂
I've been running the 700$ asus x570 and the Lan ports drop connection at random for 20 seconds. Can't use it all. Enough to be aggravating. Can only use the wifi
This is quite upsetting how Asus is doing this. Looks like I'll have to revise my pc build that I'm currently working on.
I'm from Taiwan and my home only 3Km awaly from ASUS HQ , and I also purchase hell lot of ASUS high end ROG products , but I can no longer bear with their products , the Z690-I is last MB I buy from ASUS , no more , too many issues ,also the F... Armoury Crate OMG , just purchase a MSI board to replace it today , hope MSI doing better.
ASUS, what the living hell? These guys used to be a great company. In the past, I have owned a couple of ASUS boards. Hell, the latest one I bought was an ASUS A8V-X motherboard back at 2018, for a classic Windows XP computer. I never had issues with them, ever. But with their latest board, not only does it cause overvoltage on a CPU and destroy it, but they try to cover it up by lying and deceiving their customers! Until ASUS straightens up, i'll be blacklisting them from my purchases. So congrats, ASUS. You played yourself!
I have an ASRock x670e pro in my rig and a asrock b650e steel legend in the gf's, been solid since day one. Jay, I would love to hear your thoughts on asrock's mobos or your personal tier list on mobos in general
Got a bundle from Micro Center R9 7900x, Asus ROG Strix B650E-F Wifi and GSkill RAMM, with all the problems with Asus, should I consider getting a different MoBo. Thoughts Jay thanks
I’ve bought two ASUS routers and they’ve went out before 6 months and never worked again I’ll never buy another one of their products. The rma process is horrible took me forever to get anyone that knew anything and they didn’t know much.
I wish they would open an exchange program for us. I'm now worried about my non x3d cpu
Is over ASUS, Jay have the high ground.
Dope
15:09 I'm dying 🤣
Nevermind it getting mixed up onto the wrong shelf or whatever, what I want to know is why the hell it would leave the factory like that in the fucking first place.
I said F___ Asus after getting stuck with a horrible Z690 Apex.    The first production run had issues,  and mine was expensive trash.     Then I learned about how they binned Apex boards and sent good ones to the release reviewers.
We need to stop using their language. "Consumer" is a term that inherently degrades people investors and CEOs don't respect using their money to buy something they are selling. Go back to calling people buying their goods customers.
Damn shame. Every time I have faith in a company. Should have known.
Im an Asus fanboy because they've been so good to me.. but this.. is awful... EVGA we need you :(
I hope they fix stuff ASAP; I have an X670E ITX board sitting on my desk unopened in the plan for a new build. Bought it based on my old Maximus Vii Impact, which has performed great since 2014.
massive kudos. Thank you for looking after us.
Thanks Jay...  Just say it like it is (as you always do). No ass kissing. No fluff. Just the facts. Thank you.
I'm so over them. Same b450i board needing to be rma 3 time. Yeppers it's over.
ASRock all the way. X570 Steel Legend Wifi. $189 solid as a rock, and bios updates regularly.
I smell a lawsuit with the whole void your warranty bios update.
Asus been on a downhill ever since Z370 release, which was just a laughing-stock quality wise, they should have been gone out of the brand trust ages ago, but oh well. It's not new, that people look at a brand, not a product and then create tons of mythologies around them.
Understandable why you would take this stance. How can you recommend their products if they don't even stand behind them. You wildin though and I stan it.
It is really upsetting for me. I have an ASUS AM4 TUF Gaming X570-Plus motherboard an ASUS TUF Gaming VG279QL1A 27 (2022) monitor and a ASUS VG278HV 27 monitor (2017). So clearly I have had a good relationship with the brand but here they are running off a cliff. 😮‍💨  I have watched the Gamers Nexus video about it and I expressed the same sentiment there as well.
Let’s not forget the problem with the z690 formula, when a lot of people like me still doesn’t have a solution and they want to charge you to give you a replacement. 😂😂😂😂
Jay complains about asus all the time, but exclusively uses their MB on his main build every time :/
Are there any ACTUAL DECENT COMPANIES left in the DIY PC space???
I have been fighting to get a replacement water block for my Z690 Formula for the past 3 months. I'm done with ASUS I think
This is the second time today where honestly I wish tech reviewers would read the EULA. Every software you use BIOS, Drivers, etc has a AS-IS AS-Available with no warranty in it. It's standard  Software boiler plates stuff. It does not void hardware warranties due to defects and workmanship which is what the hardware warranty covers. Like Asus should be getting a lot flak for a lot of stuff the voltage being high to begin with etc but the BIOS having standard boiler EULA warning especially for a Beta Bios that while should not have been available to the public does make sense.
As for MSI, i had THREE boards arrive dead from them in late 2015-ish. Never touched them since
So glad the only Asux products I have, and use, I didn't pay for.
Hi Jay, new PC builder, would this also impact ASRock? I saw online they're owned by the same parent company. Do they have similar manufacturer processes/designs
The 2 times I gave ASUS boards a try they both had issues. I have been a Gigabyte guy ever since. No issues at all.
thats why guys switch to intel.   Less problems.
My X570 Dark Hero was overvolting my 5800X3D to 1.34V and causing stability problems and slow performance due to too much heat.  I had to manually set the voltage to 1.225V (1.254V in reality) to get it to run well.  I even had a similar issue with my Core i7 8700k on a Maximus X Hero, voltage too high, too much heat, and not getting the best clocks.  Their habit of overvolting is long standing.
Isn't this more of an AMD issue? I've been using Asus motherboards for nearly 20 years and I've had no problems at all (I only use Intel processors).
Soon ASUS will join Nokia's fate....soon
I've always hated ASUS MOBOs
It's funny you should post this now. I built a Ryzen 7 5800X gaming rig roughly 2 and a half years ago, using my first Asus MoBo, a Tuf X570 Gaming Pro WiFi and have had lots of problems with stock BIOS settings, overvolting things. If they were great before, they aren't anymore. (old man grumbling) I've tried several BIOS's and always have to turn down the voltages manually to get the temps down and oddly enough, the CPU actually runs faster, because it's cooler... Asus is dropping the ball on BIOS settings for sure.
I've had a problem with Asus since 2005 I've never had a motherboard with a Southbridge died on me before
I’ve never had any problems with ASUS parts, my only issue is how overpriced they are 🥹
Wow ASUS. Was the go to Brand
Its serious when Jay says "youre fired" and i mean that as out of most tech youtubers you give the most benefit of the doubt to most companies and their products. I guess im sticking with MSI.
I would never install a beta, especially bios...but Asus this is serious, you will lose the people you need to sell your product...reviewers.
I am really happy I went with gigabyte for my gpu and mb choices this last go around
I am so so soooo happy that i went with an Asrock X670E Pro RS board for my AM5 build, and not Asus
Don't put your trust in any company...
Evga boards added to the basket now.
dam it jay. i almost spit out my coffee when you said "solid asrock" while using an ASRock RX 6700 XT Phantom Gaming GPU and, still in box, ASRock B550 extreme4 mobo.
Is that also the x570 also?  I have noticed issues with with crashes. I have changed things thinking it was the cpu. Could it have been that? Would the MSI 570's work better?
Is RoG bad? Is the proart mobo still good or is it affected as well?
Honestly I've been an avid ASUS user since what feels like forever and it pains me they've been declining all the way to this point.
It's too bad. I used to love Asus stuff. In fact, I just bought an Asus 4080. Well, crap. Now I have to find another motherboard manufacturer for system builds. This is what happens when beancounters take over the company. First NewEgg, and now Asus.
.. im going to go out on a limb here and say that I reckon you should maybe hold on these videos for a few days.. re watch it.. then decide to post it
I built my pc using a basic ASUS board a year ago instead of going GIGABYTE or anyone else. When I saw Steve's video earlier even though I couldn't afford a board that strong I kind of regretted the ASUS buy even at a basic level. I definitely know I won't be getting any of their laptops when the time comes to replace this one, and considering it's age that's sooner rather than later. Is it bad that I kind of feel like foregoing a processor upgrade from a 10100F to a 11400F (and I'm not even on AMD or the latest gen) when I can just to get a different brand's motherboard? (I would be partially using gift cards that are just basically waiting to be spent anyway). A board would actually be cheaper to get than a processor and the 10100F is just fine as it is.  The board that I did receive from ASUS btw came with a bent capacitor that thankfully turned out not to affect anything. I probably will end up keeping what I have and upgrading the processor but I will be looking elsewhere if I have to replace this motherboard/when I build my next pc. I knew beforehand Asus wasn't perfect but this is just scummy and sucks how they are handling this (if you can call it that).
jay you play star citizen they do this shit all in the game here the new update good luck
My last two builds were Asus. I had nothing but issues with both boards. Never again.
Asus has never been good at customer service.  I've been listening to horror stories for over a decade about it.  I still bought their products though because to date I've never got a faulty product from them but lately, I don't know if I'd chance it.
You have more respect from me then anyone else when you stand up for the customer/little guy with very little cash, and big companies who take our money and screw us at the same time. All my respect.
I mentioned this in a tweet to Steve and the GN guys, but I personally would love to see a video on a brands these days who we can actually trust quality wise, who's had issues but learned from them to get better, etc etc.
10,000 views in 10 minutes, wow Jay your definitely doing it right!
I was done with Asus back in May 2020 when I got two DOA motherboards from Newegg.  The second board was to replace the first.  Both boards were DOA, and both had no anti-static bags.  I bought a MSI board through Best Buy, and couldn't be happier.
I knew you'b be dropping this after Steves video. I said to a friend I bet you're making it right now.... haha
I'm legitimately excited by this, and I'm only a few mins into the video. This means we'll be able to get eyes on alternative options when building, rather than jumping to ASUS boards, which often default as the most expensive. As for having trust in ASUS -- I've had the hardest time having complete faith in them when the past decade has been filled with reviews containing "Don't expect help from their customer service" -- and that has not changed since.  Good riddance.
Asus was one of my favorite companies back in the ivy bridge days, and even earlier. But as of last year, I’ve decided I’m no longer interested  The less pressing issue is that my B450-F is having some stability issues. I can’t find any updated bios revisions for it at all, but it’s not buggy enough for them to care.  The much worse thing: I bought a G14 Zephyrus laptop in 2021. In February of 2022, the hinge fucking MELTED. The vents shoot heat at the hinge , and it got so hot (while playing tf2, an incredibly lightweight game) that it warped. I fought Asus for 6 months, sent my computer in 3 times, and eventually had to threaten legal action. I emailed the CEO’s office and the only reason why they finally replaced my laptop was because of the potential fire hazard. They wanted to make sure there wasn’t gonna be a recall problem. To compensate, they did give me a higher-specced laptop. But at that point, I was too frustrated with Asus to bother so I sold the laptop for $800 on eBay (originally paid $400!!)  I’m completely done with Asus. Will not be buying anymore boards or laptops.   Are ASRock and MSI boards any good nowadays? If not I’ll just go with Gigabyte
I want an office style video of Jay smashing up Asus motherboards.
I have the Asus ROG STRIX B650E-F Motherboard and I have been trying everything under the sun to update my BIOS and it keeps failing. I've used different USB sticks,different USB ports,and have quadruple checked to make sure I have the correct BIOS files and I have had nothing work. Makes me wonder if my board is faulty.
I feel the same way, Jay. I wasn't happy when I checked to find out that my Asus x670e Gene has been running my 7900x at 1.419 v ever since I got them at launch
Hey Asus, I've bought my last Asus product due to this dumpster fire!
Now asus is going down again?? Who do we trust :(
looks like they were screwing their customers with confidence.
ugh this sucks. I'ma ROG/Asus "fanboi", I really hope they get their stuff together.
SAy what??? I am a BIG supporter of ASUS..... Those look like Intel boards. I don't care.
What happens when they change? I had power supply problem they replaced it twice?
It is almost unbelievable, how far ASUS has fallen. Way back when I 1st built my 1st PC (Pentium 50 CPu for reference), ASUS was the go to manufacturer for motherboards. If you wanted stable, solid, reliable...you went ASUS. How they managed to flip 180 degrees, will be the subject for case studies in MBA, and post graduate work.
Should I disable Asus auto optimization in BIOS ?
I’ll never buy their shit again either.
I've been saying it for the last 6 years. ASUS has changed. Their quality has declined, and the support is awful. They used to be good, 10+ years ago, now one of the worst.
my ASUS B550 -F motherboard came with a dead ethernet port. I decided instead of sending it in for RMA and being down for a month i bought a wifi adapter and called it a day. I have always been ASUS motherboards for every build but Im gonna try a new brand
So moving forward, would getting the ASUS ROG MAXIMUS HERO with my i9-13900k be a bad thing? I don't know what other board I should start looking at
respect, ngl good move!
me looking at my b450 TUF 2 chilling
I absolutely love that tech youtubers band together and call a company out on it's bullsh*t.  Average people get screwed and have zero power to do anything about it.  But you guys have such a big reach to so many people that it gives a voice to all of us and holds these guys accountable.   So thanks.
Motherboard were the last thing I trusted ASUS to do semi-competently.
wow, still on AM4 and Asrock.  never felt better about that!
this should never happen, this is absurd and unacceptable!
Call some repair shops and see who's gear they are repairing the most.
Asus has been a pain to deal with. They’ve sent me 3 straight broken graphics cards
still rocken the asus  b 550 f 5800x  sapphire nitro 6700xt still good  who can by parts every 6 months  nothings free
Good thing I bought a Strix 4090 yesterday lmfao
"Republic of gamers" is a cringe slogan anyways. Time for a whole revamp for Asus
Yep I am not gonna grab a Asus product for a very very very very long time. Good thing I got my sister to get a MSI board instead of Asus for her 12th gen system upgrades. :)
It was so easy for them to address this.  “We heard about the reports.  We are looking into it.”  “We identified the cause, we f’d up.  If you were affected don’t worry we will cover you.”  “Bios is still in beta while we QA.  Feel free to install, if you have any issues we will cover you.”  So simple.  Is the bad media worth the handful of boards at most to rma?
Steve: Asus is Bad, Jay: Asus youre fired, Linus: I LOVE this from Asus -_- Boi
All of my Asus boards and cards have been rock solid, guess im lucky.
It makes me very happy when all creators pile on when these companies act this way. Thanks Jay.
ive actually been a pretty loyal customer of asus for pc parts because they made good products and one of my motherboards was DOA and they took care of it years ago pain free. but if they dont man up to this shit im never purchasing their stuff again.
This all sucks because I’ve always had great service out of my ASUS mobos. But I’ll probably be looking into other brands for my next build.
"○○○○○○ Items featured in this video available at Amazon ○○○○○○"  Might want to change that description lol
Man asus really has terrible timing for this with them just announcing their hand held that is a strong competitor to the steam deck…. I really want to try the ROG ally but how they have handled this really makes me think twice
That sucks. I have bee pretty Asus loyal for probably a decade. Not anymore. Stupid companies doing stupid things. Oof!
I have a support ticket in place regarding the possible return of my Asus X670E Hero after it killed my 7800X3D. Thankfully, Microcenter returned my CPU but my motherboard was purchased back in October, so they couldn't return it. Hopefully Asus comes up with a solution for me. I am planning on moving to a Gigabyte X670E board.
when the terms form is like 50 pages how the F do we do our due diligance to find these clauses that void our warenty ? -.- this is such a breach of trust from asus its nuts we cant file a lawsut because of selling a product that could burn my damn house down because because of that "voids warenty" bit hidein in a bucket of techno jargon -.-
_Looks at my ASUS motherboard, 3080 and keyboard_ o.O
Bought an Asus x570 board back in 2021. Been fine so far. But I don't wanna buy anything on this new platform with these shannagins going on. They done messed up. They dug their own grave, kicked their own rear end and then grabbed their own collar and shoved themselves into that hold they themselves dug.
sucks cause I just bought a new Asus bored last month for my i9 based off all the good stuff i heard over the years.
I wish we could go back to saying "customer" instead of "consumer" because it sounds a lot less dehumanizing. But that's just my opinion on these matters.
I just want to say, that the CPU melting because of to high SoC-Voltage happed on 3DV and non 3DV CPUs and on Asrock motherboards too. Even der8auer says it in his Video about that thing on his german channel. Im a AM4 user so i don't know how ASUS motherboards are today, but im realy happy with them on AM4. Besides the 6800XT Tuf was shit because of the insane coil whine. So probably I am not fine with there graphiccards.
damn i just bought the rog ally a couple hours ago
Just in time for the Asus ROG Ally to release!
I have used gigabyte for every single board I bought and they have not failed me yet. I genuinely hate micro ATX board they are so tiny.
Now i know why my comp die...
Asrock and Gigabyte boards have been doing really well for me lately. Had bad experience with msi and asus boards, weird problems or sudden death
All this shit makes me nervous about my just a month old new rig... Thankfully none of my parts match the affected parts but fuck man... just having things close to it make me feel uneasy...
oh damn, will i be safe? i got the new AM5 board (the TUF one in the vid) for a ryzen 7 7700x, just scared if it does fry as i cant afford a new cpu or mobo
I bought an ROG Crosshair VIII Formula motherboard that unfortunately gave me issues with my M.2's that I had to RMA it. I took extra care of that board because of how expensive it was and because I considered a main show piece in my build. After the RMA, ASUS sent me back a refurbished version of the board because they couldn't fix mine original one. The refurbished board was full of scratches and strange black marks that look like some wrote on it with sharpie. It took nearly 4 months of back and forth with their support and three refurbished replacements later for them to get me a board in the same condition that I provided (They ended up just giving me a brand new Crosshair VIII Formula board). I purchase the board for around $600 at the time, and for them to replace mine with three other boards that were visually abused was unacceptable to me. I had to go all that time without my computer. I won't be buying any ASUS products anytime soon after that experience.
All companies give a damn about anymore is the almighty dollar. I am just tired of electronics being built to fail within 5 years. I have a 386 that still functions..... where the hell is this kinda quality?
Also the REPUBLIC OF GAMER stuff is extremely cringe.
My Z690 experience has been horrible. Maximus Z690 recall(I was the affected who had a board pop, and now I get constant BSOD with my replacement board. I used to love ASUS and ROG, I’ve replaced everything slowly. MOBO is the last part. I’ll probably do a CPU change when Intel releases 14th gen
How do companies keep putting out worse quality products while makingmaking More profit and paying workers LESS. Late stage capitalism fuckin sucks
Pretty sure Asus "Crosshair" is actually referring to a hair across your anus. Same results.
since March 2020 it's turned into the bare minimum planet. everyone is just putting out garbage, even the soundtrack sucks. the quality of the asus z390 board I had and the recent z690 I recently put in my new system feels like why was it $300 more for a post code and flashback/clear cmos? Msi is not much better. updating msi center erased SPD on 1 ram module and win11 doesn't support thaiphoon, so I have to rma now. Asrock ftw?
I have had nothing but issues I need HELP i spent so much on the x670e board it was one of the few to fit my block and I hate them so much and always chose MSI as it has good quality and performs well!  Really upset I am stuck with a broken asus board now and overall ashamed.
Never thought I'd see the day
Well, hopefully my 3070ti TUF will be good for the years to come.  But companies do have events of bad directions.  Maybe future fixes but how long till people will come back to buying a Asus product.  Might see a breakup of company assets, who knows.
Asus is going down!
Asus RIPBOZO
When greed meets reality at its finest
ask EVGA
Will be doing my first pc build come fall. Won't be using any ASUS products, thanks for the honest vid.
Had you enough components, I'd build every single one of the those mobo's with all the "$1000" options enabled, show up in the Asus lobby and have a live demo.  Countdown to the smoke show in 3, 2, 1...
14:39 ROG phone update anyone? Exactly the same pattern with their Phone. Their updates are destroying internal hardware by just simply performing a system update and they refuse to take responsibility for out of warranty phones.
had an ASUS board blow a cap and nearly catch my apartment on fire about  20 years ago - never bought them again.
And to think I was kinda embarrassed about having an all-MSI build 😂 Let's go Dragon Gang
The few Asus stuff I bought all died.
I'm a/was an Asus fan, currently running the X670E Crosshair Hero w/7800X3D. I'm very disappointed in this. Asus, you need to do better.
This is exactly why I almost never adopt a brand new platform.
the support they've given their armoury crate was an indicator to me years ago, so bloated and basically filled with crap and lack of care for the user
Dang, I used to write/video a LOT about ASUS motherboards (that actually worked with VMware ESXi, at good prices), sigh....
never bought any assus stuff.
wish i didnt buy the z690 b4. so i wil trash it and buy a msi or something else
Steve videos lol
Yikes...and the ROG Ally seemed awesome.
ASUS has been overvolting AMD CPU's since 3900X as far as I can tell. That thing still runs at 1.4v+ at idle just sitting at the desktop on an ASUS Strix X570-E Gaming motherboard.
Wow. This is literally putting your money where your mouth is. Huge Kudos, Jay!
The beta bios is literally “this may fix the problem, but if I doesn’t it’s your problem, not ours.” Unreal.
soy boy won’t buy a brand for 3 weeks until the new product to shill for comes out …wow.
Remember £57 Soltek boards? Ahhhh good days.
I used to buy Asus components at a premium price because I trusted their support and customer service. After this fiasco I will never do this again. There’s no such a a thing as reputation and brand loyalty anymore. Everyone is trying to screw me, so be it. Price is King, nothing else.
Asus is the pinnacle of overpriced bloated hardware.
I haven't trusted them since armoury crate gave my PC cancer and 4 of my tuf z390 replacement boards refused to let me use xmp. There tuf GPUs aren't terrible in my experience but I've only  dealt with 5 of those in some recent builds I've done for people.
Asus used to be the brand of choise for me.. something i would almost trust blindly..  Not so much anymore
Hopefully you see this. But has the issue been contained to the crosshair heros? Bc I recently build my brand new rig, weeks before this came to a head, and I went with the Asus x670 prime. Want to know if I should just put the system to the side and buy a new mobo and use my old PC until the new comes in.
i normally go with asus, but i went with MSI this time with my high end build for no particular reason, dodged a bullet i guess
Glad that I have a Gigabyte MB in the new PC build 😂
and I bought an asus gpu after u said they are more trustworthy than gigabyte and msi :(
I lost a lot of respect for Asus after looking at the quality control of their laptops. I went with Lenovo this generation.
Actually upset that I have an ASUS GPU now... But it will be the last one.
Dat censorship dub @1:13.
Sheeshhh
If only EVGA made boards and such for the budget/standard consumer market.
Um jay. The x3d latest bios for my x670e-e gaming wifi board fixed the issue after couple other setting changed
I was going to buy a new Asus motherboard for my new build, but I'm going to have to go with the experts on this one.  Now to figure out which motherboard to go with.
its kinda crazy as asus is the only brand I haven't had issues with
Watching this on my ASUS monitor smh
Yes. I have my 2nd Asus Monitor and it also has a pixel failure, starts to flicker for no reason more and more... It is like a Ferrari, it has the performance and looks good but is breaking down all the time... which basically robs the fun... potential, looks and performance is nothing without the reliability!
First
Have the Maximus hero had all the issues and Asus is impossible to deal with, doesn’t acknowledge the problems. Also, once armoury crate stops working forget about ever using it again or getting help from them.
look forward to seeing how many other creators follow suit
Thank you. The trouble I've had/have with my 2070 laptop from them is unreal.
Is msi still good?
i never used asus
Thank you Jay for supporting us pc enthusiasts and gamers. 👍
I hope Gigabyte is still good. Still using an older Asus motherboard from 4 years ago and it's been very reliable.
😮😮😮😮 Asus is in trouble now.. Come on Asus, you should've known better & done better!
Rest in urine
I've had so many problems from Asus motherboards (mostly just weird bugs) but none from gigabyte, weird because gigabyte is bashed for being crap
Oh boy, this will be a spicy one!
.... bruh I just bought an asus rog last Friday...
I'm running out of tech companies to rely on...
I experienced that with their phone support. It seems those guys took over the company. Sad.
Fuck I have an asus prime board
This is absolutely not surprising to me at all. I've been saying this about them for 17 friggin years, they've been doing this behind the scenes the entire time and somehow managed to avoid getting a rap for it until now. Thank you Jay (and Steve) for speaking out about it. I know of entire companies whose IT departments have sworn off any business with them.
Well crap, I have a lot of ASUS ROG stuff..
I don't think I ever clicked on a video so fast in my life
I think I will be returning my ROG STRIX X670E - E GAMING too, I don't want my 7800X3D to fry and I want my memory to run at 6000Mhz
Its times like this, I'm glad I moved to apple. Asus, you have done screwed up son! 😂
👍
I've been dealing with their awful 48 hour customer service turnover just to get a response for my Z690 motherboard issue. They've totally lost my respect and the brand is officially tarnished for me.
First
Feel worried about my Asus AM5 board now 😅  Not even started the build yet, but have the 7950x3d and Crosshair mobo like Jay did
notification in 30 sec😮
You know it’s bad when GN boots you
Shameful how the mighty have fallen
Hey I'm early for once
Msi here I come! Always loved Asus but this is just unacceptable!
